Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,Disney,1930,1937,Animation,"Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space. Through wind and darkness, I summon thee.  Speak!  Let me see thy face. What wouldst thou know, my Queen? Magic Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? Famed is thy beauty, Majesty. But hold, a lovely maid I see. Rags cannot hide her gentle grace. Alas, she is more fair than thee. Alas for her! Reveal her name. Lips red as the rose. Hair black as ebony. Skin white as snow. Snow White!    Want to know a secret?  Promise not to tell? We are standing by a wishing well  Make a wish into the well  That's all you have to do  And if you hear it echoing  Your wish will soon come true  I'm wishing I'm wishing  For the one I love  To find me To find me  Today Today  I'm hoping I'm hoping  And I'm dreaming of  The nice things The nice things  He'll say He'II say       I'm wishing I'm wishing  For the one I love  To find me To find me  Today Today  Oh! Hello. Oh. Did I frighten you? Wait! Wait, please. Don't run away.  Now that I've found you  Hear what I have to say  One song  I have but one song  One song only for you  One heart tenderly beating  Ever entreating  Constant and true  One love  That has possessed me  One love  Thrilling me through  One song  My heart keeps singing  Of one love  Only for you   Take her far into the forest. Find some secluded glade where she can pick wildflowers. Yes, Your Majesty. And there, my faithful Huntsman, you will kill her! But, Your Majesty, the little Princess! Silence! You know the penalty if you fail. Yes, Your Majesty. But to make doubly sure you do not fail, bring back her heart in this.  One song, I have but one song    Hello there. What's the matter? Where's your mama and papa? Why, I believe you're lost.  Oh, please don't cry.  Come on, perk up. Won't you smile for me? That's better. Your mama and papa can't be far.  There they are! Can you fly? Goodbye. Goodbye!  I can't, I can't do it. Forgive me. I beg of Your Highness, forgive me. I don't understand! She's mad, jealous of you! She'll stop at nothing! But, but who? The Queen. The Queen? Now, quick, child, run. Run away, hide! In the woods! Anywhere! Never come back! Now, go. Go! Go! Run! Run! Hide!         Oh! Please don't run away. I won't hurt you. I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. But you don't know what I've been through. And all because I was afraid. I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made. What do you do when things go wrong?  Oh! You sing a song!          With a smile and a song  Life is just like a bright, sunny day  Your cares fade away  And your heart is young   With a smile and a song  All the world seems to waken anew  Rejoicing with you  As the song is sung  There's no use in grumbling   When raindrops come tumbling  Remember you're the one  Who can fill the world with sunshine  When you smile and you sing  Everything is in tune and it's spring  And life flows along   With a smile and a song   I really feel quite happy now. I'm sure I'll get along somehow. Everything's going to be all right. But I do need a place to sleep at night. I can't sleep in the ground like you or in a tree the way you do. And I'm sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me. Maybe you know where I can stay. In the woods somewhere?  You do?  Will you take me there? Oh, it's adorable! Just like a doll's house. I like it here. Ooh, it's dark inside. Guess there's no one home.  Hello? May I come in? Shh! Oh! What a cute little chair! Why, there's seven little chairs! Must be seven little children. And from the look of this table, seven untidy little children. A pickaxe. A stocking, too!  And a shoe!  And just look at that fireplace. It's covered with dust.  And look, cobwebs everywhere! My, my, my! What a pile of dirty dishes!  And just look at that broom!  Why, they've never swept this room. You'd think their mother would...  Maybe they have no mother. Then they're orphans. That's too bad. I know! We'll clean the house and surprise them. Then maybe they'll let me stay.  Now, you wash the dishes. You tidy up the room. You clean the fireplace. And I will use the broom.  Just whistle while you work   And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place  So hum a merry tune   It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace  And as you sweep the room  Imagine that the broom  Is someone that you love and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune  Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub. When hearts are high the time will fly  So whistle while you work  Uhuh, uhuh! Not under the rug.         So whistle while you work     We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig  In our mine the whole day through  To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig is what we like to do  It ain't no trick to get rich quick  If ya dig, dig, dig with a shovel or a pick  In a mine In a mine  Where a million diamonds Shine  We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig   From early morn 'til night   We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig up everything in sight   We dig up diamonds by the score  A thousand rubies Sometimes more   Though we don't know what we dig 'em for  We dig, dig, digadig, dig     Heighho  Heighho  Heighho, heighho  Heighho  Heighho, heighho It's home from work we go   Heighho, heighho!

She's mighty mean! She's an old witch! I'm warnin' ya. If the Queen finds her here, she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us! But she doesn't know where I am! She don't, eh? She knows everything. She's full of black magic. She can even make herself invisible. Pfft! Might be in this room right now. Oh, she'll never find me here. And if you let me stay, I'll keep house for you. I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook and... Cook? Can you make dapple lumpkins... Uh, lumple dapplins? Apple dumplings! Eh, yes! Crapple dumpkins. Yes, and plum pudding and gooseberry pie... Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays!  Ah! Soup! Hooray!   Uhuh, uhuh! Just a minute. Supper's not quite ready. You'll just have time to wash. Wash? Wash? Wash? Wash? Wash? Hah! Knew there was a catch to it. Why wash? What for? We ain't goin' nowhere. 'Tain't New Year's. Oh, perhaps you have washed. Perhaps we... Yes! Perhaps we have. But when? When? When. Uh, you said whe... Why, last week. Why, recently! Yes, recently! Oh, recently! Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands! Why, Doc, I'm surprised!  Come on, let's see them. Oh, Bashful, my, my, my! And you?  Worse than I thought! Oh! How shocking!  Goodness me, this will never do. March straight outside and wash, or you'll not get a bite to eat.  Hah! Well, aren't you going to wash? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?  Oh! Did you hurt yourself?   Hah, women! Courage, men, courage. Don't be nervous. Gosh, it's wet!  It's cold, too! We ain't gonna do it, are we?  Well, it'll please the Princess. I'll take a chance for her! Me, too! Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work. But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch, and they'll walk all over ya! Don't listen to that old warthog. Come on now, men. How hard do ya scrub? Will our whiskers shrink? Do ya get in the tub? Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show? Now, now, now, don't get excited. Here we go. Step up to the tub 'Tain't no disgrace  Just pull up your sleeves and get 'em in place  Then scoop up the water and rub it on your face and go...   Pick up the soap Now don't try to bluff  Work up a lather And when you got enough  Get your hands full of water and you snort and you snuff and go...   You douse and you souse Rub and you scrub  You sputter and splash all over the tub   You may be cold and wet when you're done  But you gotta admit it's good and clean fun  So splash all you like 'Tain't any trick  As soon as you're through You'll feel mighty slick  Bunch of old nanny goats. Ya make me sick going...  Hah! Next thing ya know she'll be tyin' your beards up in pink ribbons and smellin' ya up with that stuff called ""perfoom."" Hah!   A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be. I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna.     Get him! Hey, let go of me! Get him over to the tub. Get him over to the tub. Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose! Get him up on the tub. Get him up! Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him! Get him up on the tub! On the tub. That's the tub. That's the tub. Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited! Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...  Get the soap! Hey, steady, men. We'll get him there. We'll get him. Never say die. Never say die. You don't...    Now, scrub good and hard It can't be denied  That he'll look mighty cute as soon as he's dried  Well, it's good for the soul And it's good for the hide to go...     Ain't he sweet? Smells like a petunia.  He sure is cute! You'll pay dearly for this! Supper!  Supper! Food. Hooray!  Hah! Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all? Over the seven jeweled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all. Snow White lies dead in the forest. The Huntsman has brought me proof. Behold her heart. Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land. 'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand. The heart of a pig! Then I've been tricked! The heart of a pig! The blundering fool! I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage in a disguise so complete no one will ever suspect. Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak. Mummy Dust to make me old. To shroud my clothes, the black of night. To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.  To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.  A blast of wind to fan my hate! A thunderbolt  to mix it well. Now, begin thy magic spell.      Look! My hands! My voice! My voice.  A perfect disguise.  And now... A special sort of death for one so fair. What shall it be? Ah! A poisoned apple! Sleeping Death.       I'd like to dance and tap my feet  But they won't keep in rhythm  You see, I washed 'em both today and I can't do nothin' with 'em  Hohum, the tune is dumb The words don't mean a thing  Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?    I...     Oh, gosh!    I chased a polecat up a tree Way out upon a limb  And when he got the best of me I got the worst of him   Hohum, the tune is dumb The words don't mean a thing  Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?              Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch... Watch... Watch...  Thanks.   Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  Hey! Hey! Hooray!     That was fun! Now you do something. Well, what shall I do? Tell us a story. Yes, tell us a story. A true story. A love story. Well, once there was a princess. Was the princess you? And she fell in love. Was it hard to do? Oh, it was very easy. Anyone could see that the Prince was charming. The only one for me. Was he strong and handsome? Was he big and tall? There's nobody like him anywhere at all. Did he say he loved ya? Did he steal a kiss? He was so romantic  I could not resist  Some day my prince will come  Some day we'll meet again  And away to his castle we'll go  To be happy forever  I know  Hah! Mush! Some day when spring is here  We'll find our love anew  And the birds will sing  And wedding bells will ring  Some day when my dreams  Come true     Oh, my goodness! It's past bedtime. Go right upstairs to bed. Wait! Hold on there, men! The, uh, Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs. But where will you sleep? Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in...in... In a pig's eye! In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean... We'll be comfortable, won't we, men? Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable. Now don't you worry about us. We'll be all right, ma'am. Go right on up now, my dear. Well, if you insist. Good night. Good night, Princess. You're sure you'll be comfortable? Oh, yes. Very comfortable. Well, pleasant dreams. Pleasant dreams.  Let go! I saw it first! Now, men, don't get excited. Remember, share. It's share and share alike. Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!  Bless the seven little men who have been so kind to me. And... And may my dreams come true. Amen. Oh, yes! And please make Grumpy like me. Hah! Women!  A fine kettle of fish!           Dip the apple in the brew. Let the Sleeping Death seep through! Look! On the skin! The symbol of what lies within. Now, turn red to tempt Snow White. To make her hunger for a bite.  Have a bite?  It's not for you. It's for Snow White. When she breaks the tender peel to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal. Then I'll be fairest in the land!  But wait! There may be an antidote. Nothing must be overlooked. Oh, here it is!  ""Love's First Kiss."" Bah! No fear of that. The dwarfs will think she's dead. She'll be buried alive!  Buried alive!  Thirsty? Have a drink!    Now, don't forget, my dear. The... The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft. So beware of strangers. Don't worry. I'll be all right. See you tonight.  Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men. Be awful careful 'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I... Goodbye. Oh, gosh! Hah! Disgustin'! And be sure to watch out... To wa... To wa... To wa... Watch out. Thanks.    Well... All right. But that's the last... Wha...  Oh, go on. Run along.  Heighho, heighho  It's off to work we go   Heighho  Goodbye! Goodbye!  Now I'm warnin' ya. Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house. Why, Grumpy, you do care.  Hah! Goodbye, Grumpy!   The little men will be away and she'll be all alone with a harmless old peddler woman.  A harmless old peddler woman!  Some day my prince will come  Some day we'll meet again  And away to his castle we'll go  To be happy forever I know  Some day when spring is here  We'll find our love anew  And the birds will sing  And wedding bells will ring  Some day when my dreams  Come true    All alone, my pet? Why, why, yes, I am. But... The, the little men are not here? No, they're not, but... Mmmhmm.  Making pies? Yes, gooseberry pies. It's apple pies that make the menfolks' mouths water. Pies made from apples like these.  Oh, they do look delicious. Yes! But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.  Like to try one?  Hmm? Go on. Go on, have a bite.    Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away! Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.  Oh, I thought I'd lost it. There, there. I'm sorry. Oh! My heart! Oh, my... My poor heart. Take me into the house and let me rest. A drink of water, please.  Heighho, heighho  Heighho, heighho It's off to work we go   Heighho, heighho    Hey, look!   Stop that! Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo! Go on! Get outta here! What ails these crazy birds? They've gone plumb daffy. Yeah, they've...   And because you've been so good to poor old Granny, I'll share a secret with you. This is no ordinary apple. It's a magic wishing apple. A wishing apple? Yes! One bite and all your dreams will come true. Really? Yes, girlie. Now, make a wish and take a bite. Go on, get! These pesky critters won't stop. 'Tain't natural. There's something wrong. They ain't actin' this way for nothin'. Maybe the old Queen's got Snow White. The Queen! Snow White! The Queen'll kill her! We gotta save her! Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her! She'll kill her! What'll we do? Yes, yes, what'll we do? Come on! Giddap! Wait for me! Wait for...  There must be something your little heart desires. Perhaps there's someone you love. Well, there is someone. I thought so. I thought so!  Old Granny knows a young girl's heart. Now, take the apple, dearie, and make a wish. I wish... I wish... That's it, go on! Go on. And that he will carry me away to his castle where we will live happily ever after. Fine! Fine! Now take a bite. Don't let the wish grow cold! Oh, I feel strange. Her breath will still. Oh. Oh. Her blood congeal. Oh.   Now I'll be fairest in the land!  Hurry, hurry. There she goes! After her!      I'm trapped! What will I do? The meddling little fools! I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones! Look out!      One song  One song  l have but one song  One song One song  Only for you For you  One heart  Tenderly beating  Ever entreating  Constant and true So true  One love One love  That has possessed me  One love One love  Thrilling me through So true  One song One song  My heart keeps singing Keeps singing  Of one love One love  Only for you...  And away to his castle you'll go  To be happy forever we know  Goodbye. Goodbye, Grumpy. Goodbye. Oh, Dopey. Goodbye!  Some day when spring is here  We'll find our love anew  And the birds will sing  And wedding bells will ring   Some day when my dreams  Come true!  "

Then why don't I ever see them? You will, sometime. On the meadow? Perhaps. Hush now. We're almost there. The meadow! Wait! Bambi, wait! You must never rush out on the meadow. There might be danger. Out there, we're unprotected. The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us. So we have to be very careful. Wait here. I'll go out first. And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you. Come on, Bambi. It's all right. Come on. Good morning, Prince Bambi. Good morning, young prince. Hello. What ya eatin'? Clover. It's awfully good. It's delicious. Why don't you try some? No, no, not that green stuff. Just eat the blossoms. That's the good stuff. Thumper. Yes, Mama? What did your father tell you? About what? About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens? Oh, that one. Eating greens is a special treat. It makes long ears and great big feet. But it sure is awful stuff to eat. I made that last part up myself. Watch out. Watch out. That's little Faline. He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama? Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello. Hello, Bambi. I said hello. Well, aren't you going to answer her? You're not afraid, are you? Well, then, go ahead. Go on, say hello. Hello. You! He stopped and looked at me. Yes, I know. Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow? Everyone respects him. For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long. He's very brave and very wise. That's why he's known as the Great Prince of the Forest. Faline! Bambi! Mother! Bambi! Bambi! Mother! Mother! Mother! Come on out, Bambi. Come on. It's safe now. We don't have to hide any longer. What happened, Mother? Why did we all run? Man... was in the forest. Mother, look! What's all that white stuff? Why, it's snow. Snow? Yes. Winter has come. Hiya, Bambi. Watch what I can do. Whoo! Come on! It's all right! Look! The water's stiff. Yippee! Some fun, huh, Bambi? Come on, get up. Like this. No, no. Kinda wobbly, aren't you? Got to watch both ends at the same time. Guess you better unwind it. Arghh! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Flower! Is it spring yet? No. Winter's just started. What ya doin'? Hibernatin'? Uhhuh. What do you want to do that for? All us flowers sleep in the winter. Well... good night. Winter sure is long, isn't it? It seems long. But it won't last forever. I'm awful hungry, Mother. Yes, I know. Bambi. Bambi, come here. Look. New spring grass. Bambi. Quick! The thicket! Faster! Faster, Bambi! Don't look back! Keep running! Keep running! We made it! We made it, Mother! We... Mother! Mother! Mother, where are you?! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Your mother can't be with you anymore. Come. My son. Let's sing a gay little spring song  This is the season to sing  So I'd like to suggest That we all do our best  And warble a song about spring  Spring, spring, spring  Let's get together and sing  Let's sing a gay little spring song  Just like the bird on the wing  Things always seem right When you're cheerful and bright  So let's get together and sing  Sing, sing, sing  Let's sing a song about spring  Let's twitter and tweet Like the birdies in May  Get into the mood And be merry today  Forget all your troubles And warble away...

And you, too! Hello, Friend Owl. Don't you remember me? Why, it... it's the young prince. Bambi! My, my, how you've changed. Turn round there. Let me look at you. I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers. You know, just the other day I was talking to myself about you. And we were wondering what had become of you. Hello, Bambi! Remember me? Thumper! Righto! Hi, fellas. Flower. Yeah. Well, what's the matter with them? Why are they acting that way? Why, don't you know? They're twitterpated. Twitterpated? Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time. For example... you're walking along, minding your own business, you're looking neither to the left nor to the right, when all of a sudden... you run smack into a pretty face. You begin to get weak in the knees. Your head's in a whirl. And then you feel light as a feather. And before you know it, you're walking on air. And then you know what? You're knocked for a loop. And you completely lose your head. Gosh, that's awful. Gee whiz. Terrible. And that ain't all. It can happen to anybody. So you'd better be careful. It could happen to you, and you, and... Yes, it could even happen to you. Well, it's not going to happen to me. Me neither. Me neither. Ha! Twitterpated! Oh... Ahem. Oh. Hello, Bambi. Don't you remember me? I'm Faline. Bambi. Bambi. Bambi! I bring you a song  And I sing as I go  For I want you to know  That I'm looking for romance  I bring you a song  In the hope that you'll see  When you're looking at me  That I'm looking for love  I'm seeking that glow  Only found when you're young and it's May  Only found on that wonderful day  When all longing is through  I'm seeking that glow  Only found when a thrill is complete  Only found when two hearts gently beat  To the strains of a waltz That's both tender and new  I bring you a song  For I'm seeking romance  You're by my side There's a moon up above  It shines with a light That's so mellow and bright  It's easy to see That tonight we shall fall in love  I bring you a song  For I'm seeking romance  And you  It is Man. He is here again. There are many this time. We must go deep into the forest. Hurry! Follow me! Faline! Bambi. Bambi, where are you? Bambi! Bambi! Faline! Faline! Faline! Listen. He's coming! Hush! Be quiet. He's coming closer. Be calm. Don't get excited. We better fly. No. No, don't fly. Whatever you do, don't fly. He's almost here! I can't stand it any longer! Bambi! Bambi! Faline! Bambi! Bambi! Quick, Faline! Jump! Get up, Bambi. Get up! You must get up. Get up! Get up! Now... come with me. Bambi. Hoo! Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl. Wake up, Friend Owl. Oh, what now? Hey, what's going on around here? It's happened. Happened? Yes. In the thicket. Hurry up, Bambi. Yes, Papa. I'm coming. Oh. Well. Look. Two of them. Oh! Well, I don't believe I've ever seen a more likely looking pair of fawns. Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud. Love is a song that never ends  One simple theme repeating  Like the voice  Of a heavenly choir  Love's sweet music  Flows on "

Oh, that's very true. Oh, well, I suppose that's mother love. But it's certainly no excuse for what she did. Mother love might cover a multitude of sins. It's true, my dear, and she has such a streak in... A guy can't eat in peace. Yes, but mother love does... Gab, gab, gab. Always gossiping. Girls, girls! Listen! Have I got a trunk full of dirt. Well, darling, tell us all. Go on, go on. Well, I heard today that they have put her in solitary confinement. No! You don't mean it! Oh, how awful for her! Well, II must say, II don't blame her for anything. You're absolutely right. It's all the fault of that little... FREAK. Yes, him with those ears that only a mother could love. What's the matter with his ears? I don't see nothing wrong with 'em. I think they're cute. Ladies, ladies! It's no laughing matter at all. Oh. Oh, she's right, girls. Don't forget that we elephants have always walked with dignity. His disgrace is our own shame. Yes, that's true. That's very true. Oh, indeed it is.

Shh. How do ya like that? Giving him the cold shoulder. Poor little guy. There he goes, without a friend in the world. Nobody to turn to. Oh, I'll do something about this. A mouse! So ya like to pick on little guys, huh? Well, why don't you pick on me? A proud race. Overstuffed hay bags! Boo! Still afraid of a mouse. Hoho, boy. Wait'll I tell the little guy. Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo. You can come out now. Golly. Maybe I scared him too. Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend. Come on out, won't ya? You're not really afraid of little me, are ya? Ya are? Must've overdid it in there. Don't know my own strength sometimes. Dumbo. Look what I got for ya. Uhuhuhuh. Ya gotta come out first. Too bad ya don't trust me, 'cause I thought... uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we might get your mother out of the clink. Oh, but I guess you wouldn't be interested. So long, Dumbo.

I step out. I blow the whistle. Yeah. The trumpets are trumpeting. Yeah. And now... comes the climax! Yeah? What is the climax? Hmm. I don't know. I knew he never had nothing. Well, maybe it comes to me... in a vision while I dream. Good night, Joe. Good night, Boss. Climax. Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax. I'll be back in a minute. I'm gonna take care of your future. I am the voice of your subconscious mind. Your inspiration. Now, concentrate. Remember? Your pyramid of elephants... are standing in the ring waiting for a climax. Climax. You are now getting that climax. Climax. How's the reception? Coming through okay? Good. Suddenly, from the sidelines, comes your climax. Climax. Galloping across the arena. Arena. He jumps from a springboard... to a platform. At the very pinnacle of your pyramid, he waves a flag... for a glorious finish! Finish? And who is your climax? The little elephant with the big ears! The world's mightiest midget mastodon! Dumbo! What? Dumbo. Dumbo. Dumbo. Dumbo. Dumbo. Dumbo. I got it! I got it! Ladies and gentlemen... we will now present for your entertainment... the most stupendous, magnificent... supercolossal spectacle. On this tiny... little, insignificant ball... we will construct for you... a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone... To hear him talk, you'd think he was going to do it. But a living, breathing... The stuffed shirt. Pyramid of ponderous, pulsating... pulchritudinous pachyderms! I give you the elephants. Aren't we a bit clumsy? Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey? You're no cream puff yourself, dearie. Quiet up there. Tend to your work, girls. Take your foot out of my eye, clumsy ox. Steady, girls. Boy, that was a close one. They're almost ready now, Dumbo. Don't forget to wave that flag. Okay, okay. Don't wave it no more. I saw ya. Now, look. All ya gotta do is run out, see? Jump on the springboard. All right, now show me just how you're gonna do it. That's it. Attaboy. That's the stuff. Come on. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Dumbo! Oh, those ears. We gotta do somethin', quick. Ladies and gentlemen... you have now seen the impossible... accomplished in front of your faces. Seven jungle giants... each one weighing not... That windbag! Why doesn't he come to the point? 7,500 pounds! And now, I present... the world's smallest little elephant... who will spring from this springboard... in one spring... to the top of this pyramid, waving his little flag... for a grand climax! Ladies and gentlemen... I give you Dumbo! Go on! Get goin'! What's the matter with you? Dumbo! That's your cue! You're on, Dumbo. Out of my way, assassin! Dear! Ohh. I never thought I'd live to see the big top fall. Because of that Dumbo, I never can show my face there again. Oh, look at my beautiful tail! I'd just like to spank the daylights out of him... Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh. Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie. They fixed him good. What do you mean? WhWhat did they do? Did they beat him? What is it, darling? Tell us. Come, come. I demand to know. Oh. Well, they've gone and made him... Oh, dear, I just can't say it. Out with it! Made him a clown. A clown? No! Yes. Oh, the shame of it. Let us take the solemn vow.

Pinocchio,Disney,1940,1940,Animation," When you wish upon a star   Makes no difference who you are   Anything your heart desires   Will come to you   If your heart is in your dream   No request is too extreme   When you wish upon a star   As dreamers do   Fate is kind   She brings to those who love   The sweet fulfillment of   Their secret longing   Like a bolt out of the blue   Fate steps in and sees you through   When you wish upon a star   Your dreams   Come true  Pretty, huh? I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that, about a wish coming true, do you? Well, I didn't either. Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth, but let me tell you what made me change my mind. One night a long time... ahem. Pardon me. Wait'll I fix this thing. There. One night a long time ago, my travels took me to a quaint little village. It was a beautiful night. The stars were shining like diamonds, high above the roofs of that sleepy old town. Pretty as a picture. As I wandered along the crooked streets, there wasn't a soul to be seen. The only sign of life was a lighted window in the shop of a woodcarver named, uh, Geppetto. So I hopped over... ...and looked in. It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste. So what do I do? I go in! I looked around. Of course, being in a strange place like that, I didn't know what to expect. A cricket can't be too careful, you know. Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home. As I stood there warming my... myself, I took a look around. Well, sir, you never saw such a place. The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on, and all carved out of wood. And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art. And shelf after shelf of toys and... And then something else caught my eye. A puppet! You know, one of those marionette things, all strings and joints.  Cute little fellow. Ding, ding. Going up? Good piece of wood too. Well, now, it won't take much longer.  Just a little more paint and he's all finished. I think he'll be all right. Don't you, Figaro?   Ahh! Beg pardon.  See?  That makes a big difference. Verrry good. Very, very good. Well, you can't please everybody. Now I have just the name for you. Pinocchio! Do you like it, Figaro? No? You do, don't you, Cleo? Well, we'll leave it to little woodenhead. You like it? That settles it! Pinocchio it is! Come on, now, we'll try you out. Music, Professor!   Hey! Ouch, ouch! Take it easy there! Oh, break it up, will you? Whew! Lotta down beats in there.   Little woodenhead go play your part   Bring a little joy to every heart   Little do you know and yet it's true   That I'm mighty proud of you   Little wooden feet and best of all   Little wooden seat in case you fall  Ohho! How graceful!  My little woodenhead     Cleo, meet Pinocchio. Say, ""How do you do?""  Say hello to Figaro. Oops! Ohhoho! Up to mischief already. You see what happens?   Boo!  Up we go!  Ah, you're a cute little fellow.  And that smile! You know, I...  You rascal! Jealous, huh? You know, Pinocchio, I think Figaro is jealous of you. Don't worry, Figaro. I sti...  Uhoh.   Cuckoo, cuckoo. Cuckoo, cuckoo. Gobble, gobble. Gobble, gobble.    I wonder what time it is? It's getting late. Come now. We go to bed. Good night, Pinocchio. Little funny face.  Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.  Figaro? You say good night too. Go on! Now go to sleep, my little mermaid. Good night. Oh hum. This is my idea of comfort. Solid comfort.  Look at him, Figaro. He almost looks alive! Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy? Oh, well. Come on. We go to sleep. Ah, Figaro. I forgot to open the window. Oh, Figaro! Look, look, the wishing star! Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I make tonight. Figaro, you know what I wished? I wished that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy. Wouldn't that be nice? Just think. A real boy. A very lovely thought, but not at all practical. A real... ...boy.    Quiet!  After all, enough's enough. Now what's up? Hey, what's going on here? As I live and breathe, a fairy! Mmmmm! Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others. You deserve to have your wish come true. Little puppet made of pine, wake. The gift of life is thine. Whew! What they can't do these days. I can move! I can talk!  I can walk! Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life. Why? Because tonight Geppetto wished for a real boy. Am I a real boy? No, Pinocchio. To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you. Up to me? Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish, and someday you will be a real boy. A real boy! That won't be easy. You must learn to choose between right and wrong. Right and wrong? But how will I know? How'll he know! Your conscience will tell you. What are conscience? What are conscience! I'll tell ya! A conscience is that still, small voice that people won't listen to. That's just the trouble with the world today. Are you my conscience? Who, me? Would you like to be Pinocchio's conscience? Well... uh, I, I... Uhhuh. Very well. What is your name? Oh, Cricket's the name. Jiminy Cricket. Kneel, Mr. Cricket. Huh? No tricks now. I dub you Pinocchio's conscience. Lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong, counselor in moments of temptation and guide along the straight and narrow path. Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket. Well! Hohoho! My, my! Mmm! Say, that's pretty swell. Gee, thanks! But, uh, don't I get a badge or somethin'? Well, we'll see. You mean, maybe I will? I shouldn't wonder. Make it a gold one? Maybe. Now remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy. And always let your conscience be your guide. Goodbye, milady. Goodbye.  Not bad, says I. Oh, yeah! Hohoho! Almost forgot about you. Well, Pinoke...  Maybe you and I had better have a little hearttoheart talk. Why? Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you? Uhhuh. All right, sit down, son. Now, you see, the world is full of temptations. Temptations? Yep! Temptations. They're the wrong things that seem right at the time, but, uh, even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things...  ...may be right at the wrong time, or vice versa. Ahem. Understand? Uhuh. But I'm gonna do right. Attaboy, Pinoke, and I'm gonna help ya. And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle. Like this.  Like this?  No, no. Try it again, Pinoke. Like this?  No, son. Now listen!   That's it! Come on, now. Let's sing it!  When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong   Give a little whistle    Give a little whistle    When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong   Give a little whistle    Give a little whistle   Not just a little squeak Pucker up and blow   And if your whistle's weak, yell  Jiminy Cricket?  Take the straight and narrow path   And if you start to slide give a little whistle    Give a little whistle    And always let your conscience be your guide    Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh      Take the straight and narrow path   And if you start to slide   Give a little whistle  Yoohoo.  Give a little whistle  Woohoo!  And always let your conscience be your guide   And always let your conscience be your guide  Who is there? It's me. Ahhh! It's me. Huh? Shh, Figaro! There's somebody in here.  Shh! Careful now, Figaro. He might spring out on us at any time. He's in here somewhere. Here I am!    Ohh! Pinocchio! How did you get down here? I fell down. Oh, you did. Ohh! You are talking. Uhhuh. No, no, no, no! Yes! And I can move too! No, no, you can't! I'm dreaming in my sleep! Oh, wake me up! Wake me up! Now we see who's dreaming. Go on... say something. Gee, you're funny. Do it again! You do talk! Yes! The blue fairy came. The blue fairy? Uhhuh, and I got a conscience. A conscience! And someday I'm gonna be a real boy. A real boy! It's my wish, it's come true! Figaro, look! He's alive, he can talk! Say hello to Figaro. Hello to Figaro. Oh, Cleo! I almost forgot. GEPPETTO Look, it's Pinocchio! She's my little water baby. Isn't she cute? Yeah, cute!  This calls for a celebration! Music! You start one, Pinocchio.  Tralalalalala Lalalala    Oh, boy. A party! Mind if I cut in? How 'bout sitting out the next one, babe, huh? Whoops! Hey! Whoa! Lemme out! Lemme out!  Come, Cleo, join the party! Dance!  Ooh, nice!  Tralalala Lalalala   Tralala Gathering toys   Tralala For my little boy   Tralala, lalala  Look... pretty! Oh! Help! Ohh, where's the bucket? Help! Water!  Water! Here it is! I got it! Here's water. Here's some water. Help! Where's water? That was close. Maybe we'd better go to bed before something else happens.   Little man, you've had a busy night. Now, close your eyes and go to sleep. Why? Oh, everybody has to sleep. Figaro goes to sleep, and Cleo. And besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school. Why? Oh, to learn things... ...and get smart. Why? Ahh... because. Oh.   Oh, look, Father. Look! Wait! Stand still now. What are those? Huh? Oh, those! They are your schoolmates, girls and boys. Now get in. Real boys? Yes! But hurry now. Oh, wait, wait! Here's an apple for the teacher. Now turn around and let me look you over.  Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. Here. Run along now. Hohoho, wait, wait. Come back here, Figaro. School is not for you. Goodbye, Father! Goodbye, son. Hurry back.  Tralalala Lalala   Ah, Gideon, listen. The merry laughter... of little innocent children wending their way to school. Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge. School, a noble institution. What would this stupid world be without... Well, well, well! Stromboli! So that old rascal's back in town, eh? Remember, Giddy, the time I tied strings on you and passed you off as a puppet? We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time!  A little wooden boy. Now, who... A wooden boy! Look, Giddy, look. It's amazing. A live puppet without strings. A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone. Now let me see. That's it! Stromboli! Why, that old faker would give his... Listen. If we play our cards right, we'll be on easy street or my name isn't Honest John. Quick! We'll head him off. Shh! Now's our... No, no, stupid. Don't be crude.  Let me handle this. Here he comes. Ah, yes, Giddy, as I was saying to the duchess only yesterday... Oh! Oh, how clumsy of me! My, my, my, my. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I do hope you're not injured. I'm all right. Ah, splendid! Well, well. Quite a scholar, I see. Look, Giddy, a man of letters. Here's your book. I'm going to school. School! Ah, yes. Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success. Uhuh. No? I'm speaking, my boy, of the theater! Here's your apple. Bright lights, music, applause! Fame! Fame? Yes! And with that personality, that profile, that physique... Why he's a natural born actor, eh, Giddy? But I'm going... Straight to the top. Why, I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high. Uh... what is your name? Pinocchio. Pinocchio! PINUO... Uh...  We're wasting precious time. Come. On to the theater!

Get me outta here! Ohh! All right then, here's what we'll tell 'em. You can't go to the theater. Say ""Thank you just the same."" You're sorry, but you've got to go to school. Mmhmm. Pinocchio? Oh, Pinocchio! Woohoo. Here they come, Pinoke. Now you tell 'em. Woohoo! Oh, little boy! Ah, there you are! Where were we? Ah, yes... on to the theater! Goodbye, Jiminy! Goodbye? Huh?  Hi diddle Dee Dee An actor's life for me  Pinoke, you can't go!  A high silk hat and a silver cane   A watch of gold with a diamond chain  There he goes. What'll I do? I'll run and tell his father. No, that'd be snitching. I'll go after him myself. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude the performance of this great show, Stromboli, the master showman... that'sa me. And by special permission of the management... that'sa me too. Is presenting to you something you will absolutely refuse to believe!  Well, looks like a sellout. Introducing the only marionettea who can asing and adance absolutely without the aids of astrings. I hopea so.  The one... and only... Pinocchio!  Hmph! What a buildup.  I got no strings to hold me do...   Go ahead... make a fool of yourself! Then maybe you'll listen to your conscience.    Cute kid.   I got no strings to hold me down   To make me fret or make me frown   I had strings but now I'm free   There are no strings on me   Heigh ho the merryo   That's the only way to be   I want the world to know   Nothing ever worries me I got no strings...  What I told you, huh?  They got strings but you can see   There are no strings on me    You have no strings Your arms is free   To love me by the Zuider Zee   Yayaya if you would woo   I'd bust my strings for you   You've got no strings Comme Ci comme Ã§a   Your savoir faire is Ooolala   I've got strings but entre nous   I'd cut my strings for you   Down where the Volga flows   There's a Russian rendezvous   Where me and Ivan go but I'd rather go with you  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  There are no strings on me    Huh? They like him. He's a success. Gosh! Maybe I was wrong. Well, guess he won't need me anymore. What does an actor want with a conscience anyway? What could have happened to him?  Where could he be at this hour? I'd better go out again and look for him.  And remember, nobody eats a bite until I find him.    I gota no strings but I gota the brain   I buy a new suit and I swinga the cane   I eata the best and I drinka champagne   I gota no strings on me   Bravo, Pinocchio! They liked me! Mmm! 200! You are sensational! You mean, I'm good? Ahhh! 300! You are colossal! Does that mean I'm an actor? Sure! I will push you in the public's eye. Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue. Will she? Ye... Huh? What's this?  Ahhh! For you, my little Pinocchio. For me? Gee, thanks! I'll run right home and tell my father.  Home? Oh, sure. Going home to your father. Oh, that is very ""comeecal."" You mean, it's funny? Oh, sure! Yes. I'll be back in the morning. Be back in the morning! Going home?  There, this will be your home... Where I can find you always! No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! To me... you are belonging. We will tour the world. Paris. London. Monte Carlo. ""Constantinopolee."" No, no! Yes! We start tonight! Mmmm! You will make lots of money... for me! And when you are growing too old, you will make good firewood!  Let me outta here. I gotta get out! You can't keep me! Quiet! Shut up! Before I knocka you silly! Good night, my little wooden gold mine.  No! No, wait! Lemme out! I'll tell my father! Hah! Giddy up!  Get along there. Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy!  Jiminy, where are you?  Jiminy Cricket!   Well, there he goes. Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet. Oh, well, I can always say ""I knew him when."" I'll just go out of his life quietly.  I would like to wish him luck though. Sure! Why not? Pinocchio? Pinocchio! It's me, your old friend, Jiminy. Remember? Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya! Pinocchio, what's happened? What did he do to ya? He was mad. He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye. Yeah? And just 'cause I'm a goldbrick, he's gonna chop me into firewood! Oh, is that so? Now, don't you worry, son. I'll have you outta here in no time at all. Why, this is just as easy... as rollin' off a... umph!  Kinda rusty.  Needs a little oil. Needs a little oil, needs a little oil. That's what I said.   Woohoohoo! Must be one of the old models. You mean, you can't open it? Yeah. Looks pretty hopeless. It'll take a miracle to get us outta here. Gee. Pinocchio?  Pinocchio! Giddy up!  Pinocch...  A fine conscience I turned out to be. I shoulda listened to you, Jiminy. No, it was my fault. I shouldn't have walked out on you. Guess I'll never see my father again.  Oh, buck up, son. It could be worse. Be cheerful... like me!  Aw, take it easy, son. Come on, blow. Attaboy. Oh, well, it stopped raining any way. Hey, that star again! The lady! The fairy! What'll she say? What'll I tell her? You might tell her the truth. Why, Pinocchio! Uh... hello! Sir Jiminy! Well! This is a pleasant surprise! Haha. Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school? School? Well, I... Go ahead, tell her. I was going to school 'til I met somebody. Met somebody? Yeah, two big monsters! With big green eyes. Why, I... Monsters? Weren't you afraid? No, ma'am. But they tied me in a big sack. You don't say! And where was Sir Jiminy? Huh? Oh, Jiminy? Psst. Leave me outta this. They put him in a little sack. No! Yeah! How did you escape? I didn't. They chopped me into firewood! Oh, look, my nose! What's happened? Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth, Pinocchio. Perhaps? Oh, but I have! Every single word!  Oh, please help me. I'm awful sorry. You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing... until it's as plain as the nose on your face. She's right, Pinoke, you better come clean. I'll never lie again, honest, I won't. Please, your honor, uh, I mean... Miss Fairy. Give him another chance for my sake. Will ya? Huh? I'll forgive you this once. But remember, a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood. We'll be good, won't we? Very well, but this is the last time I can help you. Gee, look, Jiminy! My nose! Hey, we're free. Come on, Pinoke.  I buya new suit and I swinga the cane   I eata the fish and I drinka champagne   I gota no strings on me  ToodleOoo, Stromboli. Goodbye, Mr. Stromboli. Shh! Quiet! Let's get outta here before something else happens.  Hi diddle Dee Dee An actor's life for me   A high silk hat and a silver cane   A watch of gold with a diamond chain   Hi diddle Dee day An actor's life is gay   It's great to be a celebrity   An actor's life for me   And the dummy fell for it. Haha! Hook, line and sinker!   And he still thinks we're his friends! And did Stromboli pay! Plenty!  That shows you how low Honest John will stoop. Eh, Giddy?  Now, Coachman... What's your proposition? Well, how would you blokes like to make some real money? Well... and who do we have to, eh... No, no! Nothing like that. You see... I'm collecting stupid little boys. Stupid little boys? You know, the disobedient ones what play hooky from school. Ohh! And you see...  Yes. Oh! ...and I takes 'em to Pleasure Island! Ah, Pleasure Island. Pleasure Island? But the law, suppose they... No, no. There is no risk! They never come back... as boys!  Now I've got a coach load leaving at midnight. We'll meet at the crossroads and no doublecrossing! No, sir. Scout around. Any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me. Yes, chief. I'll pay you well. I got plenty of gold. Yes, yes. No, sir, nothing can stop me now. I'll make good this time. You'd better! I will. I'm going to school. That's the stuff, Pinoke. I'd rather be smart than be an actor. Now you're talkin'! Come on, slowpoke. I'll race ya home. Well, well, Pinocchio, what's your rush? I gotta beat Jiminy home. Oh, hello. Well, how is the great actor? I don't want to be an actor. Stromboli was terrible! He was? Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage. He did? Uhhuh, but I learned my lesson. I'm going... Oh, you poor, poor boy. You must be a nervous wreck. That's it! You are a nervous wreck. Ahem. We must diagnose this case at once. Quick, Doctor, your notebook. Bless my soul. Mmmmm! Mmhmm! My, my. Just as I thought. A slight touch of monetary complications with bucolic semilunar contraptions of the flying trapezes. Mmhmm! Say hippopotamus. Hihohotamus. I knew it! Compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion and spasmodic frantic disintegration! Close your eyes. What do you see? Nothing. Open them. Now what do you see ? Spots! Haha! Now that heart.  Ooh! My goodness! A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller with a wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy! Quick, doctor, that report. Oh! This makes it perfectly clear. My boy, you are allergic. Allergic? Yes! And there is only one cure. A vacation on Pleasure Island. Pleasure Island? Yes! That happy land of carefree boys where every day is a holiday! But I can't go. I... Why, of course you can go. I'm giving you my ticket. Here. Thanks! But I'm... Oh, tuttuttut, I insist. Your health comes first. Come, the coach departs at midnight!  Hi diddle Dee Dee It's Pleasure Isle for me   Where every day is a holiday   And kids have nothing to do but play  Pinoke? Oh, Pinoke? Now where do you suppose he... Huh? Pinocchio! Hey, come back. Giddy up.  Well...  ...here we go again. My name's Lampwick. What's yours? Pinocchio. Ever been to Pleasure Island? Uhuh. But Mr. Honest John gave me... Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint. No school, no cops. You can tear the joint apart and nobody says a word. Honest John gave me... Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink. And it's all free! Honest John... Boy, that's the place. I can hardly wait!    Right here, boys! Right here. Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream. Eat all you can. Be a glutton. Stuff yourselves. It's all free, boys. It's all free. Hurry, hurry, hurry. The rough house, the rough house.

Being bad's a lot of fun, ain't it? Yeah, uhhuh. Get a load of that stainedglass window. All right, now. Hop to it, you blokes.  Come on! Come on! Shut the doors and lock 'em tight. Now get below and get them crates ready. Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.  Pinocchio! Pinocchio?  Where is everybody? The place is like a graveyard. I don't like the looks of this. Pinocchio! Hey, where are you?  Where do you suppose all the kids went to, Lampwick? They're around here somewheres. What do you care?

Lampwick says a guy only lives once. Lampwick... Hmph! Come on, come on. Let him go. Lampwick... Hmph! Lampwick! It burns me up. After all I tried to do for him. Who's his conscience, anyway?

Pinoke, the kids, the boys, they're all donkeys! Oh! You too. Come on, quick! Before you get any worse. This way, Pinoke. It's the only way out. Hurry up before they see us. You gotta jump! Jiminy? Jiminy? You all right? Sure!  I thought we'd never make it. Certainly feels good to be back on dry land. Come on, let's get home. Father, Father, I'm home! We're home, Mr. Geppetto. It's me, Pinocchio! I'm home to stay.  Here he is, Mr. Geppetto. Home at last. Hey, maybe he's asleep. Father? Father, it's me. Pinoke, come here. Look. He ain't here. He... He's gone. Yeah, and Figaro. And Cleo too. Maybe something awful happened to him. Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far. Hey! It's a message. What's it say? It's about your father. Where is he? Why, uh, uh. It says here he went looking for you and was swallowed by a whale. Swallowed by a whale? Yeah, uhhuh. A whale? A whale named Monstro. But wait, he's alive. Alive? Where? Why, inside the whale at the bottom of the sea. Bottom of the sea? Uhhuh. Hey, where you going? I'm going to find him. Pinoke, are you crazy? Don't you realize he's in a whale? I've gotta go to him. Hey, Pinoke, wait! Listen here, son... But this Monstro, I've heard of him. He's a whale of a whale! He swallows whole ships alive! Tie it good and tight now. And besides, it's dangerous. Bye, Jiminy. Goodbye? I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya. Come on... let's go. Look out below! Gangway, down there. Gee! What a big place. Come on, Jiminy. All right. Soon as I take on some ballast. One side, sister. Well... so long. Hmm. Put it in the wrong end. Hmm! No more privacy than a goldfish. Ooo! Chilly. Father? Hey, Pinoke, wait for me! Father? Father! Huh! He ain't my father. Uh, Mr. Geppetto! Hey! What the... Hey, let go! Run along, you little... squirt. What's the matter? Can't a fellow... I was only... We were only looking for Monstro. That got 'em. Father? Oh! Hello.  Oh! Can you tell me where we can find Monstro, the whale? Gee! They're scared. Uh, pardon me, pearl, are you acquainted with Monstro, the whale?  Whoa, hold it there. Hmph! Father? One side there, son. Come on, boys, break it up. Break it up now.  Hey! What the... Whoa, quit shovin'. Don't crowd. Take it easy there.  Whoa there.  Steady there, Nellie. Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them. Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro? Whoa! Whoa, boy. Sakes alive. Father? Father? Mr. Geppetto? Not a bite for days. We can't hold out much longer. Ah... Ah... Ahchoo! Ahchoo! I never thought...  ...it would end this way, Figaro. Starving to death in the belly of a whale. My poor little Pinocchio. He was such a good boy. It's hopeless, Figaro. There isn't a fish left. If the monster doesn't wake up soon, I'm afraid we... we are done for. Here they come! Tuna! Oh, tuna fish! Food! We'll eat! Here's a big one. Keep them in there, Figaro. Wait! Wait a minute! Have you seen... Monstro! Ohh! We gotta get outta here. Woohoohoo! Come on, Pinoke. Don't wait for me! Never saw so many! Whoops! Hahahaha! Here's another one. Enough for weeks! Here's a big one. Keep them in there, Figaro! Hey, blubber mouth, open up. I gotta get in there. Looks like the last of them. Here's a big one. Only a few left. We gotta work fast. Hey! Here's another one. Hey, Father! Father! Don't bother me now, Pinocchio. Pinocchio? Father! Pinocchio, my son! Hey, Father, here I am. Huh? Oh, oh, yes! Pinocchio, my boy! I'm so happy to see you. Me too, Father. Whoops. Figaro! Ah, Figaro. Cleo! Oh, Cleo! You're here too. Yes! We're all together again. Ahchoo. Oh, you are soaking wet. Yes, Father. You mustn't catch cold. But I came to save you. You know, you shouldn't have come down here. But, Father. But I'm awfully glad to see you. Let me take your hat. Oh! Pinocchio! Wha... What's the matter? Those ears! Huh? Ears? Oh, these! Oh, that's nothing. I got a tail too! Heehaw! Pinocchio! What's happened to you? Well, I... I, I... Oh, never mind now. Old Geppetto has his little woodenhead. Nothing else matters! I gotta get in! My pal's in there. Come on, ya big moose! Open up, I tell ya! Hey! Cut it out.  Hey, beat it, you buzzards! Get out? Oh, no, no, son. I have tried every way. Why, I even built a raft. A raft? That's it! Huh? We'll take the raft and when the whale opens his mouth... No, no, no, no. Now, listen, son. He only opens his mouth when he's eating. Then everything comes in, nothing goes out. Oh. It's hopeless, Pinocchio. Come, we make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish. A fire! That's it! Yes! And then we'll all eat again. A great big fire! Lots of smoke. Smoke? Oh, yes, sure. Smoked fish will taste good. Quick, some wood. Pinocchio, not the chair. Hurry, Father, more wood! What'll we sit on? We won't need it. We're getting out! Getting out? But how? We'll make him sneeze! Make him sneeze? Oh! That will make him mad!  Ah... Ah... Ah... Well, it's about time! It won't work. Hurry, Father. Climb aboard. We'll never get by those teeth! Yes, we will! Hey, which way you going? Wait for me! Hang on. Here we go!  Gesundheit. We're going back! No, we'll make it. Faster, faster. It's no use. We're done for!  We made it!  Look! Now he is mad! I told you he'd be furious! He's gone. Where'd he go? Look out! Hang on!  He's coming back. Hurry! He's trying to kill us! Paddle, son! Let's go back! Look out! Jump! Father? Father? Oh, Father! Pinocchio, swim for shore. Swim for shore. Hang on, Father. Save... yourself.  Pinocchio... save yourself. Don't mind me, son. Save yourself... Pinocchio. Pinocchio? Oh, Pinocchio! Pinocchi...  My boy! My brave little boy. Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish and someday you will be a real boy. Awake, Pinocchio. Awake. Father, whatcha cryin' for? Because... you're dead, Pinocchio. No! No, I'm not! Yes, yes you are. Now lie down. But, Father, I'm alive. See? And I'm... I'm... I'm real! I'm a real boy! You're alive and... and you are a real boy! Yea! Whoopie! A real live boy. Haha. This calls for a celebration!  Professor, lots of music! Well! This is practically where I came in. Thank you, milady. He deserved to be a real boy. It sure was nice of you to... Huh? Wha... Wh... Well, I'll be! My, my! Solid gold too. Oh, I think it's swell!  When your heart is in your dream   No request   Is too extreme   When you wish   Upon a star   Your dreams come true   You'll find your dreams come true "
The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad,Disney,1940,1949,Animation,"Ichabod and Mr Toad  Ichabod  Ichabod and Mr Toad  Ichabod, Ichabod and Mr Toad...  If you chose the most fabulous character in English literature,  who would it be?  Robin Hood? King Arthur?  Becky Sharp?  Sherlock Holmes?  Oliver Twist, perhaps?  Any one of them would be an excellent choice.  But as the most fabulous character of all, I nominate  a toad.  J Thaddeus Toad, Esquire. Have you never met him?  You'll find his story in ""The Wind in the Willows"".  Toad was the one disturbing element.  Incurable adventurer, mad, reckless, tried everything.  A positive mania for fads, and he never counted the cost.  He had a host of fairweather friends.  But there were only three who had his best interests at heart.  One was a badger. MacBadger.  And then there was a water rat.  A bit stuffy, perhaps, but really a fine fellow. And a mole.  A gentle creature, kind and sympathetic.  They all made their homes in a quaint community along a riverbank.  On that particular day, Mole was in a hurry because...  because he was late for tea.  A regrettable habit, but Rat had learned to put up with it.  Sorry, says Mole. Quite alright, says Rat. Two lumps?  Then, just as they were getting settled...  Special Delivery, Mr Rat. Thank you, Postman. How's everything on the river, sir? Dashed quiet, as usual, thank you. Mole, listen. ""Dear Rat: You and Mole must come to Toad Hall at once."" ""Urgent!! A MacBadger."" Rat was certain Toad was making trouble again.  The answer to that lay just around the bend at Toad Hall,  the ancestral home of J Thaddeus himself.  This impressive structure was the finest home on the river.  The animals were tremendously proud of it.  They felt it gave the whole community an air of respectability.  To lose Toad Hall was, of course, unthinkable,  and yet it was no secret that Toad's follies  had brought him to the brink of bankruptcy.  So, MacBadger had volunteered to put Toad's house in order.  Smashed fence. Two guineas. Damage, lamp post. Four pound six. Destruction of hen house... How can a man figure with all this hubbub? I'll not be put off! Pay my bill! I want my money! Silence! You'll get your money in due course. Now, go along with you. I'll pay no more today. Why did I assume the responsibility of looking after... Didn't I tell you...? It's you, Rat. And Mole, too. Thank goodness, lads. You've come at last. Poor MacBadger. He'd reached the end of his rope.  As he said himself...  I'm practically a nervous wreck. I say! What seems to be the trouble? Summat's got to be done about Toad! This time he's gone too far! But he promised us... Promises? What good are promises when wild manias take him? Now, look, you're his closest friends, are you not? Yes. Very dear friends. Then you must find Toad and stop him! What's he doing? He's got a new mania. He's rampaging about the county in a canaryyellow gypsy cart. With a horse named Cyril. Tallyho! Are we on our way to Nottingham, to Brittingham, to Buckingham  Or any hammy hamlet by the sea? No!  Are we on our way to Devonshire, to Lancashire or Worcestershire?  I'm not so sure We'll have to wait and see  Are we on our way to Dover? Or going merrily over  The jolly old road that goes to Plymouth Ho?  No! We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily  On our way to nowhere in particular  We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way  Though the roads are perpendicular  We're always in a hurry We have no time to stall  We've gotta be there We've gotta be there  But where, we can't recall  We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our way  And we may be going to Devonshire, to Lancashire, to Worcestershire  We're not so sure, but what do we care?  We're only sure we've got to be there  We're merrily on our way to nowhere at all  Hello, you fellows! You're the very animals I was coming to see! Come along! Hop up! We'll go for a jolly ride! The open road, the dusty highway. Come! I'll show you the world. Travel, change, excitement... How stupid of me! I want you fellows to meet my noble steed Cyril. Aye, that's me. A bit of a trotter, a bit of a rotter. How do you do, how do you do, how do you do? How do you do? Say, guv'nor, your friends seem a bit on the stuffy side. Toad, we want to have a talk with you. A visit! Splendid! This is serious. You must give up that horse and cart. Give up my... But my dear Ratty, this is my career! You can't mean... I do! You must stop this foolishness! No. You must! No. I won't do it. Your reckless behaviour is giving animals a bad name! You're becoming a menace to society. At least think of poor MacBadger! And as for that horse, no good will come of gadding about with such a fast and irresponsible beast! Get him, Mole! Come down, Toady. Stop it! Let me go! Giddy up, Cyril! Giddy up! It's no use. You'll never get me to give this up! Tallyho! Yikes! Look! Gad! What is it? Lummy, guv'nor, it's a motorcar. Motorcar? A motorcar... Gad! What have I been missing? Ratty, it isn't... He hasn't... It is, and he has. A new mania. Motor mania. Mania.  That's it. That's what it was. A positive mania.  No telling where it would end. Might linger for months.  And with Toad Hall at stake, Rat and Mole had no choice.  Only one thing to do.  Lock the poor chap up until the poison worked out of his system.  Hold him, Moley! That's better. And you can't escape. Simply no use trying. Let me out! Open up, I say! Please! Open the door! Playing jailer to one's dearest friend wasn't pleasant.  In fact, Moley immediately wanted to call it quits, but Ratty said no.  This time they must be firm.  It wasn't just a matter of saving Toad from himself.  There was MacBadger to consider, and Toad Hall and all it stood for.  There was only one thing wrong with Ratty's cure for motor mania.  It didn't work. You see, Toad was far too clever.  And, at the moment, completely mad. He was determined to get a motorcar,  even if he had to beg, borrow or...  Toad arrested! Extra! His Majesty versus J Thaddeus Toad, Toad Hall, Riverbank, DoodleBunton MaxonMorton, Surrey. 24th day of August, set forth in the following brief. Accused is J Thaddeus Toad, of stealing a motorcar, and with it, endangering sundry subjects of His Majesty, their life and limbs. Counsel for the Crown, proceed with the case. My lord, I call, as first Crown witnesses, Mr Rat and Mr Mole! Is it true that you had the accused locked in his own house because he had threatened to get a motorcar? Did you, or did you not, have him locked up? We did. Thank you! That is all! Next witness. Mr Angus MacBadger! As trustee of the Toad estate, you knew of the prisoner's mania for motorcars? And due to his extravagance, you cut off his allowance? Then he was, to the best of your knowledge, without funds? That is all! Thank you! Gentlemen of the jury, the Crown rests. Counsel for the defence will present his case. My lord, with the court's indulgence, I rise prepared to plead my own defence. Stop it. Gentlemen of the jury... I call, as my first witness, Cyril Proudbottom. Are you acquainted with the defendant, J Thaddeus Toad? Lord love a duck, yes! He's one of the jolliest chaps I've run across. And simply tons of money. Good fellow? Throws it away. But he wasn't throwing it away that day! You heard Mr MacBadger testify that his allowance was cut off. Then how did he get a motorcar? The only way a gentleman gets anything. The honest way. And what is the honest way? I thought you wouldn't know! Your Lordship, I... The witness may testify in his own words. Righto, guv'nor. I'll just give you the facts. When Toady escaped from his boudoir he headed straight for my place. Soon we was off down the highway,  but we hadn't gone far, I confess, when, with a rush and a roar...  something passed like the London Express.  It was big, it was red, it was beautiful.  A motorcar, a bit of alright.  Toady was transfixed with... rapture.  You could tell it was love at first sight.  The motor pulled up to a tavern, wherein was located a bar.  And we watched while some toughlooking weasels  got out of that lovely red car.  Now, weasels, I know, are deceitful.  And not to be trusted, at all.  But how could I know they'd stolen that car?  I didn't have no crystal ball.  The guv'nor is not one to dally.  He made up his mind like a flash. He says...  Try it for size, my good Cyril,  while I see what they'll take for it, cash.  Into the tavern he saunters, where the barman was back of the bar.  And he said,  Cheerio, tavern keeper. Who's the owner of that... hotlooking car? The barman, a codger named Winky, leaned over the bar and said,  Why? The guv'nor answered,  That car must be mine! Whatever the price is, I'll buy. But Toad found he hadn't no money. So, he promptly offered a trade.  The weasels appeared to be willing. In a moment, the bargain was made.  Toady drawed up a paper, with almost incredible speed.  He called on old Winky the barman  to... pop over and witness the deed.  Now, the guv'nor is not a bit stingy. He never does anything small. The weasels gave him the red motorcar, and he gave the weasels Toad Hall. Traded Toad Hall? An estate worth £100,000 for a motorcar? You expect me to believe that? I don't expect you to believe anything. Fortunately, I can produce a witness. Call Mr Winky! My lord, gentlemen, facing you in the witness box is a citizen of substance and standing. A man of unimpeachable honesty. Now, Mr Winky, do you recall an incident that took place in your... establishment last August 12th, that I was a party to? Yes, sir, that I do. Well, then... just tell the court what actually happened. Well, guv'nor, you tried to sell me a stolen motorcar. That's a deliberate lie, you monkeyfaced rum pot! I've been framed! Let me go! Help! Toad guilty! Toad's disgrace rocked the nation.  The court was determined to make an example of him.  Toad's friends tried to help him, but were always blocked.  They must've reopened the case a dozen times.  Appeals to this court, that court any court. But the decision stood.  The case of J Thaddeus Toad was closed.  Merry, merry Christmas time  Bind every heart with happiness Let everyone...  Yes, once again, it was a white Christmas.  Melodies of Yuletide hung sweet upon the winter's air.  Hearts were gay and spirits high.  Indeed, in all the city,  only one spot was untouched by the warmth of Christmas cheer.  The Tower, grim monument to  despair. Cold, cruel, forbidding,  and the abode of Toad for a good many Christmases to come.  Poor Toad. Alone with memories of his wasted life.  What a fool he'd been!  With many a pang he recalled the kindly face of Angus MacBadger,  and his sage advice, so often scorned.  A tear for Moley, too, for his loyalty, sympathy, understanding.  Toad wept for Rat, and all those little lectures so often laughed at.  Yes, within the dark confines of his miserable cell,  a new Toad was born. A reformed Toad, a repentant Toad.  In a flood of remorse, he vowed to forsake the follies  of the Primrose path.  Never again would he give way to those mad, foolish manias  that had brought him to this sorry end.  As it's Christmas, you're allowed a visitor. Your grandma's here. Grandma? Merry Christmas, sonny! Granny wouldn't forget her little Toady boy! Look, Christmas gift. What is it? Don't you get it? A disguise. All you've got to do is put on this natty little costume and... Alas for good intentions. Toad was incurable.  One whispered word and all his high resolve  vanished in the mad whirl of this new adventure.  This new mania! Escape!  Toad's escaped! Halt! Good evening, ma'am. Good evening to you, Officer. We're merrily, merrily, merrily...  Begging your pardon, but you... You fellows, do you see him? Gad, what perfectly ripping luck!  Trap Toad, would they?  Never!  There he goes! Where? Over there! Blockheads! Let them scour the countryside.  Once more, J Thaddeus Toad had the last laugh.  That Christmas Eve, along the riverbank,  the name of Toad was banned from conversation,  lest the memory of his disgrace becloud the merriment of the season.  Yet there was one home, at least, in which two loyal hearts  still held the warmth of Christian charity.  Bless this good food we are about to enjoy. Bless us, every one. And... bless poor Toad. And may he get time off for good behaviour. Why, it's a poor old lady. Let's take her over by the fire. What are you doing here? I was just sort of... Well, this is a merry Christmas! But... aren't you afraid of the police? Afraid of the police? I, Toad, afraid of the police? Open up, I say! The police! Hide me, Ratty! Sorry, but you owe a debt to society. And you've got to pay. Mole, let them in. But, Ratty, don't you think, maybe... Open the door! Hi, lads! I've just made a very important discovery. Toad Hall is ablaze with lights  and in possession of a pack of weasels.  And the leader of the gang is none other than Mr...  Winky! Hip, hip... Hooray! And so, you see, he did trade Toad Hall for the motorcar! Toad was innocent all the time. Aye, lads. And if he were only here right now... Toad! Angus! Sorry, Toad, I misjudged you. I hope, someday, you'll find it in your heart... Not another word. To err is human, to forgive... Not so fast! You're still guilty in the eyes of the law. To prove your innocence, we've got to get that paper away from Winky! Now, I have a plan. We'll sneak in through the secret tunnel. It was an expert plan, cunningly contrived but extremely dangerous.  It would work only if each did his part. There was no margin for error.  The odds against them were tremendous, but the stakes were high.  But now, steady's the word...  One false move and four lives hang in the balance.  Careful, lads. There is a guard. I'll pop him off! Don't shoot! Who goes there? That was a close one.  Trust Toad to start things off on the wrong foot.  No turning back now. Nothing for it but to push on.  What new and greater perils lay ahead, no one could say.  Toad had already got out of hand, so anything could happen.  Look. They're all asleep. Lads, they're drunk. They've been hitting the bottle. But where is Winky? There he is! He's got the paper on him! We'll have to climb up on the balcony. The paper! It's gone! Get him, you blokes! I beg your pardon! Over here! After it! Just one more! There he is! Get him! Where's Moley? Well, laddies, we saved our skins, but we didn't get the deed. Well done! Hip, hip, hooray! So, it was a happy ending, after all.  Toad's friends were dreadfully proud of him. And why not?  He was a new Toad, completely reformed,  through with gypsy carts and motorcars for ever.  And so, on this happiest of New Years, a toast was in order.  To the New Year and... To the new Toad! Hello, you fellows! Come! I'll show you the world. Travel, change, excitement... That was the fabulous Thaddeus Toad.  But let's weigh our judgement carefully,  we Moles and Rats and Badgers. Don't we envy him a bit?  I know I do.  When we speak of fabulous characters,  the most fabulous will always be, to me,  the master of Toad Hall.  Yes! J Thad was quite a lad!  Speaking of fabulous characters,  England has produced a bumper crop.  But here in the colonies, we have a few of our own.  Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, Johnny Appleseed, Black Bart,  Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone.  And, of course, the one and only Ichabod Crane.  Ichy was the country schoolmaster dreamed up by Washington Irving.  He had a way with a yarn did Mr Irving.  If we could journey back to that period in history  when Manhattan was but a market town,  we would discover, in one of the coves  which indent the shores of the Hudson,  the little village of Tarry Town.  And just beyond, nestled deep in the low rolling hills,  a sequestered glen.  It's a quiet, peaceful place,  and yet, somehow... foreboding.  It abounds in haunted spots,  twilight tales and local superstitions.  The bestknown story concerns an itinerant schoolmaster  who once frequented these parts.  Some say his melancholy spirit still haunts the vicinity.  The pedagogue was described as a most unusual man.  To see him striding along,  one might mistake him for a scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.  He was tall, but exceedingly lank.  His head was small and flat on top, with a long, snipe nose.  It looked like a weathercock perched upon his spindle neck.  Altogether, he was an apparition seldom to be seen in broad daylight.  Late one drowsy autumn afternoon,  this strange figure first approached Sleepy Hollow.  As usual, there had gathered  at Ye Olde Schnooker and Schnapps Shoppe  a group of rustic lads, the Sleepy Hollow boys.  Their selfappointed leader, Brom Bones,  was a burly, roistering blade, always ready for a fight or a frolic.  Though Brom was given to madcap pranks and practical jokes,  there was no malice in his mischief.  With his waggish humour and prodigious strength,  Brom Bones was quite the hero, all the country round.  Odds bodkins! Gadzooks! Look at that old spook of spooks. Who's that coming down the street?  Are they shovels or are they feet?  Lean and lanky  Skin and bone  With clothes a scarecrow would hate to own  Yet, he has a certain air  Debonair and devilmaycare  It's the new schoolmaster  What's his name?  Ichabod  Ichabod Crane  What a name!  Kind of odd  But nice just the same  Funny pan, funny frame  Ichabod may be quaint  May be odd, and maybe he ain't  Anyway, there's no complaint  From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane...  Though the arrival of the pedagogue gave rise to mixed emotions,  the townspeople all agreed they'd never seen anyone...  Like Ichabod, Ichabod Crane  The schoolroom became Ichabod's empire,  over which, with lordly dignity, he held absolute sway.  Truth to say, Ichabod was a conscientious man,  and ever bore in mind the maxim spare the rod and spoil the child.  Still, he was careful to administer justice  with discrimination.  For it behoved him to keep on good terms with his pupils.  Especially if their mothers happened to be good cooks.  Who's the town's ladies' man?  Gets around like nobody can  Has to be none other than...  As time went by, it may be seen that the pedagogue  got on tolerably enough.  Moreover, Ichabod found ways to increase his slender income  and, at the same time,  awaken the cultural interests of the sleepy little village.  It was inevitable that a man like Ichabod  would become an object of ridicule to Brom Bones and his gang.  Yet, to Ichabod, these were small matters.  He possessed a remarkable equanimity  which remained quite undisturbed until  that fateful day, when his path was crossed by a woman.  A certain woman.  Katrina Van Tassel, only child of Baltus Van Tassel,  the richest farmer in the county.  She was a blooming lass, plump as a partridge.  Ripe, melting and rosycheeked.  Once you have met that little coquette Katrina  You won't forget Katrina  But nobody yet has ever upset Katrina  That cute coquette Katrina  You can do more with Margaret or Helena  Or Anne or Angelina  But Katrina will kiss and run  To her, a romance is fun  With always another one to start  And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina  You've lost your heart  There was no doubt the fair Katrina  was the richest prize in the countryside.  The schoolmaster, being an ambitious man,  began to fill his mind with many sugared thoughts  and hopeful suppositions.  Katrina, my love.  Who can resist your grace? Your charm?  And who can resist your father's farm?  Boy, what a setup!  There's gold in them acres, and that ain't hay.  Not to mention that lovely green stuff.  Katrina, my sweet. My treasure.  Treasure...  That barn's a gold mine.  How I'd love to hit the jackpot.  Dear Katrina. Papa's only child.  Papa!  The old goat can't take it with him.  When he cuts out, that's where I cut in.  Sweet Katrina, poor little rich girl.  But don't worry, Katie, Ichabod will protect you.  Yes, Katrina, you've won me.  I surrender.  And yet when you've met that little coquette Katrina  You've lost your heart  Every portal to Katrina's heart was jealously guarded  by a host of rustic admirers.  But Ichabod was confident he'd soon ride roughshod  over these simple country bumpkins.  But the most formidable obstacle he had failed to reckon with.  That was the redoubtable Brom Bones.  The ease with which Brom cleared the field of rivals  both piqued and provoked the fair Katrina.  She often wished that some champion would appear  and take the field openly against the boisterous Brom.  A wiser man would have shrunk from the competition,  but love is blind.  Ichabod was aware only that Dame Fortune  was at last thundering at his door.  It's true that Brom liked a joke as well as the next,  but enough was too much.  It was time for open warfare.  He'd double that schoolmaster up  and lay him on a shelf in his schoolhouse!  But this was easier said than done.  No doubt of it, this was Ichabod's lucky day.  The schoolmaster was a man of hidden talents,  a rival to be reckoned with.  Still, wars are neither won nor lost at the first encounter.  The highflyer might yet be brought to earth.  For Brom Bones was never a man to cry quits.  On the occasion of her father's annual Halloween frolic,  Katrina chose to stir the embers of the smouldering rivalry.  One invitation in particular carried a most personal summons.  The worthy schoolmaster was in a transport of joy.  To him, this could mean but one thing.  Ichy, you sly old dog, you!  What is this strange power you have over women?  Well, tonight's the night, boy!  Just turn on the old charm.  The fair Katrina is yours for the asking.  Gaily bedecked and nobly mounted on a horse he had borrowed,  Ichabod issued forth like a knight errant of old  to keep a tryst with his lady fair.  There was nothing to equal the merrymaking  at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm.  To Ichabod, here was a perfect field for his endeavours.  How would he put his best foot forward!  Beyond all his other talents, he prided himself upon his dancing.  Unhappy Brom, already bested at every turn,  saw himself once more outmatched.  For as he watched the posturing pedagogue,  he had to admit that here was a flawless picture  of ease and grace.  There was no doubt that Ichabod was the man of the hour.  Brom had to concede his rival another victory.  Yet, there was still a chance his time would come.  For when the hour grew late, Van Tassel would call on his guests  to tell him ghostly tales of Halloween.  Brom knew there was no more potent believer  in spooks and goblins than Ichabod Crane.  Just gather round and I'll elucidate what goes on outside, when it gets late. Around about midnight, the ghosts and banshees get together for nightly jamborees. Things with horns and saucer eyes, and some with fangs about this size! Some are fat. And some are thin! And some don't even wear their skin! I'm telling you, brother, it's a frightful sight what goes on, Halloween night. When spooks have a midnight jamboree  They break it up with fiendish glee  Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed  Is the Headless Horseman, he's the worst  That's right, he's a fright on Halloween night  When he goes ajoggin' across the land  Holdin' his noggin in his hand  Demons take one look and groan  And hit the road for parts unknown  Beware, take care, he rides alone  And there's no spook like a spook who's spurned  They don't like him and he's really burned  He swears to the longest day he's dead  He'll show them that he can get ahead  They say he's tired of his flamin' top  He's got a yen to make a swap  So he rides one night each year  To find a head in the hollow here  Now, he likes them little, he likes them big  Part in the middle, or a wig  Black or white, or even red  The Headless Horseman needs a head  With a hiphip and a clippityclop  He's out lookin' for a top to chop  So don't stop to figure out a plan  You can't reason with a headless man  Now, if you doubt this tale is so, I met that spook just a year ago. Now, I didn't stop for a second look, but made for the bridge that spans the brook. For once you cross that bridge, my friends The ghost is through, his power ends  So, when you're riding home tonight  Make for the bridge with all your might  He'll be down in the hollow there  He needs your head  Look out! Beware!  With a hiphip and a clippityclop  He's out lookin' for a head to swap  So don't try to figure out a plan  You can't reason with a headless man  It was the witching hour of night as Ichabod pursued his travel home.  The sky grew darker.  One by one, the stars winked out their lights.  Driving clouds obscured the moon from sight.  Never had the schoolmaster felt so melancholy,  so utterly alone.  The nearer he approached the hollow,  the more dismal he became.  Once inside the murky glen, Ichabod's anxiety increased onehundredfold.  The forest seemed to close in behind him.  Every small detail of Brom's awful story  returned to haunt his recollection.  Headless Horseman. Beware! Once you cross that bridge, my friends,  the ghost is through, his power ends.  Next morning, Ichabod's hat was found.  And close beside it, a shattered pumpkin.  But there was no trace of the schoolmaster.  Shortly thereafter, Brom Bones led the fair Katrina to the altar.  Rumours persisted that Ichabod was still alive,  married to a wealthy widow in a distant county.  But the good Dutch settlers refused to believe such nonsense.  They knew the schoolmaster had been spirited away  by the Headless Horseman.  With a hiphip and a clippityclop  He's out looking for a head to swap  But don't try to figure out a plan  You can't reason with a headless man  Man, I'm getting out of here! "
Alice in Wonderland,Disney,1950,1951,Animation," Alice in Wonderland  How do you get to Wonderland?  Over the hill or underland  Or just behind the tree?  When clouds go rolling by  They roll away and leave the sky  Where is the land beyond the eye  That people cannot see?  Where can it be?  Where do stars go?  Where is the crescent moon?  They must be somewhere  In a sunny afternoon  Alice in Wonderland  Where is the path to Wonderland?  Over the hill or here or there  I wonder where  "". . wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.

""And even Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, agreed to meet with William and offer him the crown. "" ""William's conduct at first was... "" Alice. Will you kindly pay attention to your history lesson. I'm sorry. But how can one possibly pay attention to a book with no pictures in it? My dear child, there are many good books in this world without pictures. In this world, perhaps. But in my world the books would be nothing but pictures. Your world? What nonsense. Nonsense? Once more, from the beginning. That's it, Dinah. If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. And, contrariwise, what it is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would. You see? In my world, you wouldn't say ""meow"". You'd say, ""Yes, Miss Alice. "" But you would. You'd be just like people, Dinah. And all the other animals, too. In my world...  Cats and rabbits would reside in fancy little houses  And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers  In a world of my own  All the flowers would have very extra special powers  They would sit and talk to me for hours  When I'm lonely in a world of my own  There'd be new birds  Lots of nice and friendly howdydo birds  Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds  Within that world of my own  I could listen to a babbling brook  And hear a song that I could understand  I keep wishing it could be that way  Because my world would be a wonderland  Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit with a waistcoat... and a watch. My fur and whiskers! I'm late, I'm late, I'm late! This is curious. What could a rabbit possibly be late for? Please, sir. I'm late, I'm late for a very important date. No time to say hello, goodbye. I'm late, late, late. It must be awfully important, like a party or something. Mr. Rabbit. Wait! No, no, no, I'm overdue. I'm really in a stew. No time to say goodbye, hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late. My. What a peculiar place to have a party. You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't... be doing this. After all, we haven't been invited... and curiosity often leads to trouble.| Goodbye, Dinah. Goodbye! Oh... Well, after this I shall think nothing of... of falling down stairs. Oh! Goodness. What if I should fall right through the centre of the Earth... and come out the other side where people walk upside down? But that's silly. Nobody... Oh! Mr. Rabbit. Wait. Please. Curiouser and curiouser. Ow. I beg your pardon. Quite all right, but you did give me quite a turn. I was following... Rather good, what? Door knob, turn. Please, sir. One good turn deserves another. What can I do for you? I'm looking for a white rabbit. So, if you don't mind... Eh? Oh. There he is. I simply must get through. Sorry. You're much too big. Simply impassable. You mean impossible. No, impassable. Nothing's impossible. Try the bottle on the table. Table? Read the directions. Directly you'll be directed in the right direction. ""Drink me. "" Hm. Better look first, for if one drinks much from a bottle marked ""Poison"", it's almost certain to disagree with one sooner or later. Beg your pardon? Just giving myself some good advice. But... Tastes like cherry tart. Custard, pineapple, roast turkey. Goodness! What did I do? You almost went out like a candle. But look. I'm just the right size. No use. I forgot to tell you. I'm locked. Oh, no. But, of course, you've got the key. What key? Don't tell me you've left it up there. Oh, dear. Whatever will I do? Try the box, naturally. Oh! ""Eat me. "" All right. But goodness knows what this will do. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What did you say? I said a little of that went a long way.| I don't think it's so funny. Now I shall never get out. Come, come, now. Crying won't help. I know, but I... I... I just can't seem to stop. Hey. This won't do. Oh, oh, oh... This won't do at all. You, up there, stop! I say. Look. The bottle. The bott... Oh, dear. I do wish I hadn't cried so much.

Don't step on the fish. Watch it. Stop kicking that mackerel. Brilliant. Jolly well done. Mr. Rabbit. Oh, Mr. Rabbit. Oh, dear. I'm sure he came this way. Do you suppose he could be hiding? Hmm. Not here. I wonder... No. I suppose he must have... Why. What peculiar little figures. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know. If you think we're alive, you ought to speak to us. That's logic. Well... It's been nice meeting you. Goodbye. You're beginning backwards. First thing in a visit is to say...  How do you do and shake hands, shake hands, shake hands  How do you do and shake hands, state your name and business  That's manners. Really? Well my name is Alice and I'm following a white rabbit, so... You can't go yet. No, the visit has just started. I'm very sorry. Would you like to play hideandseek? Or Button? Who's got the button? No, thank you. If you stay long enough, we might have a battle. That's very kind of you, but I must be going. Why? Because I'm following a white rabbit. Why? I'm curious to know where he's going. Oh, she's curious. The oysters were curious, too, weren't they? Aye, and you remember what happened to them. Poor things. Why? What did happen to the oysters? Oh, you wouldn't be interested. But I am. Oh, no. You're in much too much of a hurry. Well, perhaps I could spare a little time. You could? Well... ""The Walrus and the Carpenter. "" Or ""The Story of the Curious Oysters. ""  The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might  He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright  And this was odd because it was  The middle of the night  The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand  The beach was wide from side to side, but much too full of sand Mr. Walrus, said the carpenter My brain begins to perk We'll sweep this clear in half a year if you don't mind the work Work? The time has come The walrus said To talk of other things Of shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings And why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings Caloo, callay, no work today We're cabbages and kings Oysters, come and walk with us The day is warm and bright A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk would be a sheer delight And should we get hungry on the way, we'll stop and have a bite But Mother Oyster winked her eye and shook her heavy head She knew too well this was no time to leave her oyster bed The sea is nice, take my advice And stay right here Mum said Yes, yes, of course, of course. But, haha, the time has come, my little friends, to talk of other things Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, cabbages and kings And why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings Caloo, callay, come run away With cabbages and kings Well, now, let me see. Ah. A loaf of bread is what we chiefly need. And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh? Yes, yes. Splendid idea. Very good indeed. Now, if you're ready, oysters, dear, we can begin the feed. Feed? Oh yes. The time has come, my little friends, to talk of food and things Of peppercorns and mustard seed and other seasonings We'll mix them all together in a sauce that's fit for kings Caloo, callay, we'll eat today Like cabbages and kings I, er, I weep for you, I...| Excuse me, I deeply sympathize For I've enjoyed your company much more than you realize Little oysters, little oysters But answer there came none And this was scarcely odd because they'd been eaten, every one Hmm. Well, er... The time has come  With cabbages and kings  The end. That was a very sad story. Aye. And there's a moral to it. Oh yes, a very good moral. If you happen to be an oyster. Well, it's been a very nice visit. Another recitation. Entitled ""Father William"". First verse:  You are old Father William, the young man said  And your hair has become very white  And yet you incessantly stand on your head  Do you think at your age it is right? Do you think at your age it is right? In my youth, Father William replied to his son I'd do it again and again and again... I wonder who lives here. Mary Ann. Drat that girl. Where could she have put them? The rabbit. Mary Ann? No use, can't wait, I'm awfully late. Oh me, oh my. Excuse me, sir, but I've been trying to... Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Mary Ann? Don't just do something, stand there. No, no. Go get my gloves. I'm late. For what? That's just what I... My gloves! At once! Do you hear? Goodness. I suppose I'll be taking orders from Dinah next. Hmm. Now, let me see. If I were a rabbit, where would I keep my gloves? Oh. Thank you. Don't mind if I do. Oh, no, no. Not again. Mary Ann! You see here, Mary Ann. Help! Help! Help! Monster! Help! Assistance! A monster, Dodo, in my house. Dodo? My poor house. Steady, old chap. Can't be as bad as all that. My poor roof and rafters. All my walls. There it is! By jove. Jolly well is, isn't it? Do something. Yes, indeed. Extraordinary situation, but... But... but what? But I have a very simple solution. Thank goodness. What is it? Simply pull it out the chimney. Go ahead. Pull it out. Who? Me? Don't be ridiculous. What we need is a... ... a lizard with a ladder. Oh! Bill! Bill, we need a lazard with a lidder. Can you help us? At your service, guv'nor. Bill, me lad, have you ever been down a chimney? Guv'nor, I been down more chimneys... Excellent. You just pop down the chimney and haul that monster out of there. Righto, guv'nor. Monster? Come now. That's better, m'lad. You're passing up a golden opportunity. I am? You can be famous. I can? Of course. There's a brave lad. In you go, now. Nothing to it, old boy. Simply tie your tail around the monster's neck and drag it out. But, guv'nor... Good luck, Bill. Well, ... there goes Bill. Poor Bill. Perhaps we should try a more energetic remedy. Yes, anything, anything, but hurry. I propose that we... Yes, go on. Yes? Yes? I propose that we... By jove, that's it. We'll burn the house down. Yes. Burn the house... ? What? Oh, no.  We'll smoke the blighter out  We'll put the beast to rout Some kindling, just a stick or two This bit of rubbish ought to do Oh, dear.  We'll smoke the blighter out  We'll smoke the monster out No, no. Not my beautiful bird house.  We'll roast the blighter's toes  We'll toast the bounder's nose Just fetch that gate We'll make it clear that monsters aren't welcome here Oh me, oh my. A match. Thank you.  Without a single doubt We'll smoke the monster out  We'll smoke the monster out  No. My poor house and furniture. Oh, dear. This is serious. I simply must... A garden. Perhaps if I eat something, it will make... me... grow small. Ow! Let go! Help! I'm sorry, but I must eat something. Not me, you... you... barbarian. Help! Monster! Help! I'm late. Oh, dear. I'm here. I should be there. I'm late. I say, do you have a match? Must go. Goodbye, hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late. Wait. Please wait. Ah, young lady, do you have a match? No, I'm sorry but... Mr. Rabbit. No cooperation, no cooperation at all. Well, can't have monsters about. Jolly well have to carry on alone. Wait. Please. Just a minute. Oh, dear. I'll never catch him while I'm this small. Curious butterflies. Breadandbutterflies. Yes, of course... Hm? Who do you suppose... ? A horsefly. I mean, a rockinghorsefly. Naturally. I beg your pardon, but did you... ? That's nonsense. Flowers can't talk. But of course we can talk, my dear. If there's anyone worth talking to. Or about. And we sing, too. You do? Oh, yes. Would you like to hear Tell It To The Tulips? No, let's sing about us. We know one about the shy violet. Not that old thing. Lovely lily of the valley. A daisy duet? She wouldn't like that. Girls. We shall sing Golden Afternoon. That's about all of us. Sound your A, Lily. La! Me, me, me, me, me! La, la, la, la, la!  Little breadandbutterflies kiss the tulips  And the sun is like a toy balloon  There are getupinthemorning glories  In the golden afternoon  There are dancing daffodils on the hillside  Strings of violets are all in tune  Tiger lilies love the dandelions  In the golden afternoon  The golden afternoon  There are dogandcaterpillars and a copper centipede  Where the lazy daisies love  The very peaceful life they lead  You can learn a lot of things from the flowers  For especially in the month of June  There's a wealth of happiness and romance  All in the golden afternoon  All in the golden afternoon  The golden afternoon  You can learn a lot of things from the flowers  For especially in the month of June  There's a wealth of happiness and romance  All...  In the golden afternoon  That was lovely. Thank you, my dear. What kind of garden do you come from? I don't come from any garden. Do you suppose she's a wild flower? No, I'm not a wild flower. Just what specie or shall we say genus are you, my dear? Well, I suppose you'd call me a genus humanus Alice. Ever see an Alice with a blossom like that? Come to think of it, did you ever see an Alice? And did you notice her petals? What a peculiar color. And no fragrance. Just look at those stems. Rather scrawny, I'd say. I think she's pretty. Quiet, Bud. But I'm not a flower. Ahha! Just as I suspected. She's nothing but a common mobile vulgaris. Oh, no! A common what? To put it bluntly, a weed. I'm not a weed. You wouldn't expect her to admit it. Can you imagine? Well, goodness. Don't let her stay and go to seed. Go on. Please go. We don't want weeds in our bed. Move along. All right. If that's the way you feel about it. If I were my right size, I could pick every one of you if I wanted to. And I guess that'd teach you. You can learn a lot of things from the flowers. Seems to me they could learn a few things about manners.  A, E, I, O, U  O, U, E, I, O, A  U, E, I, A  A, E, I, O, U  Who are you? Well, I... I hardly know, sir. I've changed so many times, you see. I do not see. Explain yourself. I'm afraid I can't explain myself. Because I'm not myself, you know. I do not know. I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me. You? Who are you? Well, don't you think you ought to tell me... ... who you are first? Why? Oh, dear. Everything is so confusing. It is not. Well it is to me. Why? I can't remember things as I used to. Recite. Hmm? Oh, yes, sir. Erm... How doth the little busy bee improve each... Stop! That is not spoken correcitally. It goes: How... How doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail And pour the waters of the Nile on every golden scale? How cheer... How cheerfully he seems to grin How neatly spreads his claws And welcomes little fishes in With gently smiling jaws. I've never heard it that way before. I know. I have improved it. Well... If you ask me... You? Who are you? You, there. Girl. Wait. Come back. I have something important to say. Oh, dear. I wonder what he wants now. Well? Keep your temper. Is that all? No. Exatically what is your problem? It's exatically... exat... It's precisely this. I should like to be a little larger, sir. Why? After all, three inches is such a wretched height. I am exatically three inches high and it is a very good height indeed! But I'm not used to it, and you needn't... shout! Oh, dear. By the way, I have a few more helpful hints. One side will make you grow taller. One side of what? And the other side will make you grow shorter. The other side of what? The mushroom, of course! Hmm. One side will make me grow... But which is which? After all that's happened, I... I wonder if I... I don't care. I'm tired of being only three inches high. A serpent! Help! Serpent! Serpent! But, please, please. Off with you. Shoo. Go away. Serpent! Serpent! But I'm not a serpent. Indeed? Then just what are you? I'm just a little girl. Little? Little?! Well, I am. I mean, I was. And I suppose you don't eat eggs, either. Yes, I do. I knew it. I knew it. Serpent. Serpent! For goodness' sake. Hmm. And the other side will... The very idea. Spend all my time laying eggs for serpents like her. Goodness. I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it. There. That's much better. Better save these. Let's see. Where was I? I wonder which way I ought to go.  'Twas brillig and the slithy toves  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe  All mimsy were the borogoves  And the mome raths outgrabe Where in the world do you suppose that... ? Lose something? Oh! No, I mean, I was just wondering... That's quite all right. One moment, please. Second chorus:  'Twas brillig and the slithy toves  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe Why, you're a cat. A Cheshire cat.  All mimsy were the borogoves Wait. Don't go, please. There you are. Third chorus. No. Thank you, but I just wanted to ask you which way I ought to go. Well, that depends on where you want to get to. It really doesn't matter, as long as I... Then it really doesn't matter which way you go.  And the mome raths outgrabe  Oh, by the way, if you'd really to know, he went that way. Who did? The white rabbit. He did? He did what? Went that way. Who did? The white rabbit. What rabbit? But didn't you just say... I mean... Oh, dear. Can you stand on your head? However, if I were looking for a white rabbit, I'd ask the Mad Hatter. The Mad Hatter? No, I don't want... Or there's the March Hare in that direction. Thank you. I think I shall visit him. Of course, he's mad, too. But I don't want to go among mad people. Oh, you can't help that. Most everyone's mad here. You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself.  And the mome raths outgrabe  Goodness. If the people here are like that, I must try not to upset them. How very curious.  If there are no objections, let it be unanimous  A very merry unbirthday  A very merry unbirthday  A very merry unbirthday to us  A very merry unbirthday to me  To who?  To me  A very merry unbirthday to you  Who, me?  Let's all congratulate us with another cup of tea  A very merry unbirthday  To you  No room. No room. No room. I thought there was plenty of room. It's rude to sit without being invited. I'll say it's rude. It's very, very rude indeed. Very, very, very rude indeed. I'm very sorry. But I did enjoy your singing. I wonder if you could tell me... You enjoyed our singing? Oh, what a delightful child. I'm so excited. We never get compliments. You must have a cup of tea. Yes, indeed. The tea. You must have a cup of tea. That would be nice. I'm sorry I interrupted your birthday party. Thank you. Birthday? My dear child, this is not a birthday party. Of course not. This is an unbirthday party. Unbirthday? I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand. It's very simple. 30 days have Sep... No. An unbirthday... If you have a birthday, then you... She doesn't know what an unbirthday is. How silly. Well... I shall elucidate. Statistics prove, prove that you've one birthday Imagine, just one birthday every year But there are 364 unbirthdays Precisely why we're gathered here to cheer Then today is my unbirthday, too.

Now blow the candle out, my dear, and make your wish come true A very merry unbirthday to you  Twinkle, twinkle, little bat How I wonder what you're at Up above the world you fly Like a tea tray in the sky That was lovely. And now, my dear... You were saying that you would like to see... Pardon me. You were seeking some information of some kind? Yes. I'm looking for a... Clean cup. Move down. But I haven't used my cup. Clean cup, clean cup, move down Clean cup, clean cup, move down Would you like a little more tea? I haven't had any yet, so I can't very well take more. You mean you can't very well take less. Yes. You can always take more than nothing. But I only meant that... And now, my dear... Something seems to be troubling you. Won't you tell us all about it? Start at the beginning. Yes. And when you come to the end, ... stop. See? Well, it all started while I was sitting on the river bank with Dinah. Very interesting. Who's Dinah? Dinah's my cat. You see... Cat?! Get the jam. Put it on his nose. On his nose. My goodness. Those are the things that upset me. See all the trouble you've started? I didn't think that... If you don't think, don't talk. Clean cup. Move down. But I still haven't used... Move down, move down. And now, my dear, as you were saying... ? Oh, yes. I was sitting on the river bank with you know who. I do? I mean my CAT. Tea? Just half a cup, if you don't mind. Come, come, my dear. Don't you care for tea? Yes, I'm very fond of tea, but... You could at least make polite conversation. I've been trying to ask you... I have an excellent idea. Let's change the subject. Why is a raven like a writing desk? Riddles? Let me see, now. Why is a raven like a writing desk? I beg your pardon? Why is a raven like a writing desk? Why is a what? Careful. She's stark raven mad. It's your silly riddle. You said... Don't get excited. How about a nice cup of tea? Have a cup of tea indeed!

Well, no wonder you're late. This clock is exactly two days slow. Two days slow? Course you're late. My goodness. We'll have to look into this. Ahha. I see what's wrong with it. This watch is full of wheels. Oh, my poor watch. Oh, my wheels and springs. But, but, but... Butter, of course. It needs some butter. Butter! Butter! Butter? Thank you. Butter. That's fine. No, no, no. You'll get crumbs in it. Oh, this is the very best butter. What are you talking about? Tea? I never thought of tea. Of course. Not tea. Sugar? Sugar, just two spoons. Just two spoons. Thank you. Please be careful. Jam. Jam. I forgot all about jam. Shows you what a person'll do. Mustard. Mustard, yes. Mustard? Don't let's be silly. Lemon, that's different. There. That should do it. Look at that. It's going mad. Oh, dear. It's going mad. Mad watch. Mad watch. Mad watch. Look. There's only one way to stop a mad watch. It's two days slow, that's what it is. My watch. It was? And it was an unbirthday present, too. In that case...  A very merry unbirthday  To you  Mr. Rabbit. Oh, Mr. Rabbit. Now where did he go to?  A very merry unbirthday to us, to us  A very merry unbirthday to us, to us  Of all the silly nonsense. This is the stupidest tea party I've ever been to in all my life. I've had enough nonsense. I'm going home, straight home. That rabbit. Who cares where he's going anyway? If it hadn't been for him, I... Tulgey Wood? Curious. I don't remember this. Let me see. No, no, please. No more nonsense. Now, if I came this way, I should go back this way. Oh, I beg your pardon. Goodness. When I get home, I shall write a book about this place. If I... If I ever do get home. Oh, erm... excuse me. Could one of you tell me... ? Never mind. Oh, dear. It's getting dreadfully dark. And nothing looks familiar. I shall certainly be glad to get out of... It would be so nice if something would make sense for a change. Oh! ""Don't step on the mome raths. "" The mome raths? A path! Oh, thank goodness. I just knew I'd find one sooner or later. If I hurry, perhaps I might even be home in time for tea. Won't Dinah be happy to see me! I just can't wait till I... Oh, dear. Now I shall never get out. Well, when one's lost, I... I suppose it's good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you. But who'd ever think to look for me here? Good advice. If... if I'd listened earlier, I wouldn't be here. But... But that's just the trouble with me. I give myself very good advice.  But I very seldom follow it  That explains the trouble  That I'm always in  ""Be patient"" is very good advice  But the waiting makes me curious  And I'd love the change  Should something strange begin  Well, I went along my merry way  And I never stopped to reason  I should have known  There'd be a price to pay someday  Someday  I give myself very good advice  But I very seldom follow it  Will I ever learn  To do the things I should?  Will I ever learn  Learn to do the things I should?   And the mome raths outgrabe Oh, Cheshire Cat, it's you. Whom did you expect? The white rabbit, perchance? No, no, no. I'm through with rabbits. I wanna go home. But I can't find my way. Naturally. That's because you have no way. All ways here, you see, are the queen's ways. But I've never met any queen. You haven't? You haven't? Oh, but you must. She'll be mad about you, simply mad.  And the mome raths outgrabe Please, please. How can I find her? Well, some go this way. Some go that way. But as for me, myself, personally, ... I prefer the short cut. Oh.

Huh? Oh! Well, the fact is, miss, we planted the white roses by mistake, and...

Since this is the thought we dread We're painting the roses red Oh, dear. Then let me help you.  Painting the roses red We're painting the roses red  Don't tell the queen what you have seen or say that's what we said  We're painting the roses red  Yes, painting the roses red  Not pink  Not green  Not aquamarine  We're painting the roses red  The queen!

A cat, Your Majesty. Cat? Where? There. There he is again. I warn you, child. If I lose my temper, you lose your head. Understand? You know, we could make her really angry. Shall we try?

Cinderella,Disney,1950,1950,Animation,"Ahh, ooh  Cinderella  You're as lovely as your name  Cinderella  You're a sunset in a frame  Though you're dressed in rags  You wear an air of queenly grace  Anyone can see  A throne would be your proper place  Cinderella  If you give your heart a chance  It will lead you  To the kingdom of romance  There you'll see your dreams unfold  Cinderella  In the sweetest story  Ever told  Once upon a time,  in a faraway land,  there was a tiny kingdom,  peaceful, prosperous, and rich  in romance and tradition.  Here, in a stately chateau,  there lived a widowed gentleman  and his little  daughter, Cinderella.  Although he was a kind  and devoted father,  and gave his beloved child  every luxury and comfort,  still, he felt she  needed a mother's care.  And so, he married again,  choosing for his second wife  a woman of good family,  with two daughters  just Cinderella's age,  by name, Anastasia and Drizella.  It was upon the untimely death  of this good man, however,  that the stepmother's  true nature was revealed.  Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous  of Cinderella's charm and beauty,  she was grimly determined  to forward the interests  of her own two awkward daughters.  Thus, as time went by,  the chateau fell into disrepair.  For the family fortunes  were squandered  upon the vain and  selfish stepsisters,  while Cinderella was  abused, humiliated,  and finally forced to become  a servant in her own house.  And yet, through it all,  Cinderella remained  ever gentle and kind.  For with each dawn, she  found new hope that someday  her dreams of happiness  would come true.  Well, it serves you right, spoiling people's best dreams. Yes, I know it's a lovely morning, but it was a lovely dream, too. What kind of a dream? Mmmmmm. Can't tell. 'Cause if you tell a wish, it won't come true. And, after all... A dream is a wish  Your heart makes  When you're fast asleep  In dreams you will lose  Your heartaches  Shh. Whatever you wish for  You keep  Have faith  In your dreams and someday  Your rainbow will  come smiling through  No matter how your  heart is grieving  If you keep on believing  The dream that you wish  Will come true  Oh, that clock. Old killjoy. I hear you. ""Come on, get up,"" you say. Time to start another day. Even he orders me around. Well, there's one thing. They can't order me to stop dreaming. And perhaps someday... The dreams that I wish  Will come true  Da dum da da dum  Bum bum bum  La da da da bum dum  Ba dee  Ba dum dum ba dum dum  Ba dee  La la la la la la  La la  Ahhh  No matter how your  heart is grieving  If you keep on believing  The dream that you wish  Will come true  Look what I found. Over there, Cinderella. Wait a minute. One at a time, please. Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about? New mouse in the house. Brandnew. Never saw it before. Visitor. Visitor! Oh, a visitor. Well, she'll need a dress... No, no, no. It's not a she, it's a he. He, he. Oh, that does make a difference. He'll need a jacket and shoes... Gotta get him out! It's in a rat trap. Where? In a trap? Why didn't you say so? Now, now, calm down, everybody. Oh, the poor little thing's scared to death. Jaq, maybe you better explain things to him. Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly. Now, now. Look, little guy. Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about. We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too. She's nice, very nice. That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk. Uh, uh, zuk, zuk. Well, that's better. Hmm. Well, let's just slip it on for size. Uhhuh. It is a little snug. But it'll have to do. Now, for a name. I've got one. Octavius. But for short, we'll call you Gus. Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it? GusGus. I've got to hurry. See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq. And don't forget to warn him about the cat. Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat? Cat, cat? Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him. Meany, sneaky. Jump at you. Bite at you. Big, big. Big as a house. Zuk, zuk, Lucify? Duh, Lucify, zuk, zuk. Here, kitty, kitty. Come, kitty. Come on. Lucifer! Come here! I'm sorry if Your Highness objects to an early breakfast. It's certainly not my idea to feed you first. It's orders. Come on. Uh, Lucify. Is that Lucify? Zuk, Lucify. That's him. GusGus take the Lucify and look at! No, GusGus, no. Now, listen here. Lucify not funny. Lucify mean. Bruno. Bruno! Dreaming again. Chasing Lucifer? Catch him this time? That's bad. Suppose they heard you upstairs. You know the orders. So if you don't want to lose that nice, warm bed, you'd better get rid of those dreams. Know how? Just learn to like cats. No, I mean it. Lucifer has his good points, too. For one thing, he... Well, sometimes he... Hmm. There must be something good about him. Bruno! Oh, Bruno. Come on, now. Outside. I know it isn't easy, but at least we should try to get along together. And that includes you, Your Majesty. Breakfast time. Everybody up. Hurry, hurry. Come on, everybody, breakfast, breakfast. Come on, let's eat breakfast. Breakfast? Ooh, breakfast! Uhoh, Lucify. How're we gonna get out? Let's see. Listen, ibbydibby. Got an idea. Now, somebody's got to sneak out, get Lucify to chase him, run over to the corner and keep Lucify there. Then we all run out. Zuk. Yuk, yuk. Out. Now we choose the one to do it. Ibbydibby hop. Hop. Uh, hop. Ready, hop. Hop. Hop. Now... Hop, hop, hop. Uh, hop. Shh! Oh, there you are. I was wondering. All right. Breakfast is served. Uh, uh... Take it easy, cluckcluck. Duh... Let go! Let go, now. Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo, shoo! Poor little Gus. Here. Help yourself. Hmm. Where's GusGus? Well, guess he got away. Cinderella! All right, all right. I'm coming. Oh, my goodness. Morning, noon, and night. Cinderella! Coming, coming. Cinderella! I'm coming. Cinderella! In a minute. Cinderella! Cinderella! Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well? Huh. As if you care. Take that ironing and have it back in an hour. One hour, you hear? Yes, Drizella. Good morning, Anastasia. Well, it's about time. Don't forget the mending. Don't be all day getting it done, either. Yes, Anastasia. Well, come in, child, come in. Good morning, Stepmother. Pick up the laundry and get on with your duties. Yes, Stepmother. Oh! Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother! Mother! Mother! You did it. You did it on purpose. Mother! Mother! Mother! Now what did you do? Oh! She put it there. A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup. All right, Lucifer. What did you do with him? Oh, you're not fooling anybody. We'll just see about this. Come on. Let him go. Now the other one. Come on! Oh, poor little Gus. Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn? Cinderella! Yes, Stepmother. Humph! Are you gonna get it. Close the door, Cinderella. Come here. You don't think that I... Hold your tongue. Now, it seems we have time on our hands. But I was only trying to... Silence! Time for vicious practical jokes. Perhaps we can put it to better use. Now, let me see... There's the large carpet in the main hall. Clean it! And the windows, upstairs and down. Wash them! Oh, yes. And the tapestries and the draperies. But I just finished... Do them again! And don't forget the garden. Scrub the terrace. Sweep the halls and the stairs. Clean the chimneys. And, of course, there's the mending and the sewing and the laundry. Oh, yes. And one more thing. See that Lucifer gets his bath. My son has been avoiding his responsibilities long enough. It's high time he married and settled down. Of course, Your Majesty. But we must be patient. I am patient! But I'm not getting any younger, you know. I want to see my grandchildren before I go. I understand, Sire. No. No, you don't know what it means to see your only child grow farther, farther, and farther away from you. I'm... I'm lonely in this desolate old palace. I... I want to hear the pitterpatter of little feet again. Now, now, Your Majesty. Perhaps if we just let him alone... Let him alone? With his silly romantic ideas? But, Sire, in matters of love... Love. Bah! Just a boy meeting a girl under the right conditions. So, we're arranging the conditions. But, Your Majesty, if the Prince should suspect. Suspect! Look, the boy's coming home today, isn't he? Yes, Sire. Well, what could be more natural than a ball to celebrate his return? Nothing, Sire. If all the eligible maidens in my kingdom just happened to be there, why, he's bound to show interest in one of them, isn't he? Isn't he? Yes, Sire. The moment he does... Soft lights. Romantic music. All the trimmings! It can't possibly fail. Can it? Yes, Sire. No, Sire! Very well, Sire. I shall arrange the ball for... Tonight. Tonight? Tonight! Oh, but, Sire... Tonight! And see that every eligible maid is there. Understand? Yes, Your Majesty. The pearshaped toad  Ooh  Sing, sweet nightingale  High  Above me  Oh, sing, sweet nightingale  Sing, sweet nightingale  High  Above  Oh, sing, sweet nightingale  Sing, sweet nightingale  High  Oh, sing, sweet nightingale  Sing, sweet  Nightingale  Oh, sing, sweet nightingale  Sing, sweet  Oh, sing, sweet nightingale  Sing  Oh, sing, sweet nightingale  Oh, sing, sweet  Oh  Sing  Oh! Oh, Lucifer! You mean old thing. I'm just going to have to teach you a lesson. Open in the name of the King. An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty. Thank you. From the King! What's it say, Cinderelly? What's it say, huh? I don't know. He said it's urgent. Ohhh  Maybe I should interrupt the, uh, music lesson. Sing, sweet nightingale  High  You clumsy! You did it on purpose. It's her fault. Girls, girls. Remember, above all, selfcontrol. Yes! Cinderella! I've warned you never to interrupt... This just arrived from the palace. From the palace! Give it here. Let me have it. I'll read it. Well, there's to be a ball. A ball! In honour of His Highness, the Prince. Oh, the Prince! And, by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend. Why, that's us! And I'm so eligible. That means I can go, too. Ha! Her, dancing with the Prince. I'd be honoured, Your Highness. Would you mind holding my broom? Well, why not? After all, I'm still a member of the family. And it says, ""By royal command, ""every eligible maiden is to attend."" Yes, so it does. Well, I see no reason why you can't go. If you get all your work done. Oh, I will. I promise. And if you can find something suitable to wear. I'm sure I can. Oh, thank you, Stepmother. Mother, do you realise what you just said? Of course. I said ""If."" Oh. ""If."" Isn't it lovely? It was my mother's. It's pretty, but it looks old. Well, maybe it is oldfashioned, but I'll fix that. How do you do it? Wait a minute. There ought to be some good ideas in here. Uhhuh. This one. Oh, very nice. Nice. Like it. It'll be easy. I'll have to shorten the sleeves, I'll need a sash, a ruffle, something for a collar... Cinderella! Oh, now what do they want? Cinderella! Oh, Well. I guess my dress will just have to wait. Cinderella! Cinderella! All right, all right. I'm coming. Poor Cinderelly. Every time she finds a minute, that's the time when they begin it. Cinderelly, Cinderelly. Cinderella! Cinderelly, Cinderelly  Night and day it's Cinderelly  Make the fire  Fix the breakfast  Wash the dishes  Do the moppin'  And the sweepin' and the dustin'  They always keep her hoppin'  She'd go around in circles  Till she's very, very dizzy  Still they holler  Keep her busy, Cinderelly  Yeah. Keep her busy. You know what? Cinderelly won't go to the ball. What? Not go? What did you say? You'll see. They'll fix her. Work, work, work. She'll never get her dress done. Poor Cinderelly. Hey! We can do it! We can do it  We can do it  We can help our Cinderelly  We can make the dress so pretty  There's nothing to it, really  We'll tie a sash around it  Put a ribbon through it  When dancing at the ball she'll  be more beautiful than all  In the lovely dress we  make for Cinderelly  Hurry, hurry, hurry?  Gonna help our Cinderelly  Got no time to dillydaily  We got to get it goin'  I'll cut it with the scissors. And I can do the sewing. Leave the sewing to the women. You go get some trimmin'. And we'll make a lovely  dress for Cinderelly, whoo  We'll make a lovely  dress for Cinderelly  Follow me, GusGus. I know where to go. It's gonna be pretty, this dress. Cinderelly will be surprised. Surprised, surprised. Very surprised. And this, too, my slippers. Don't forget... Take my dress. Here, mend the buttonholes. Press my skirt and mind the ruffle. Cinderella? Yes? When you're through, and before you begin your regular chores, I have a few little things. Very well. I don't see why everyone else has nice things to wear, and I always end up in these old rags. This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it. You should talk. These beads! I am sick of looking at them. Trash. Oh, I hate this. Come on and be careful. Yes, yes, yes. Real careful. We can use that, GusGus. Pretty, pretty. Shh. Look out. Lucify! Oh! Beads! Very pretty beads! Shh! A dream is a wish your heart makes  When you're fast asleep  In dreams you will  lose your heartaches  Whatever you wish for  You keep  No matter how your  heart is grieving  If you keep on believing  The dream that you  wish will come true  Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Whatever you wish for you keep  All right. Heave, ho. Heave, ho. Heave, ho. The dream that you  wish will come true  Will come true  Yes? The carriage is here. Oh. Why, Cinderella, you're not ready, child. I'm not going. Not going? Oh, what a shame. But, of course, there will be other times. Yes. Good night. Oh, well. What's a royal ball? After all, I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and boring, and completely... Completely wonderful. It's my... Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Happy birthday! No, no, no, no! Well, I never dreamed it. It's such a surprise. Oh, how can I ever... Oh, thank you so much. Remember, when you're presented to His Highness, be sure... Wait! Please, wait for me. Isn't it lovely? Do you like it? Do you think it will do? Cinderella! Mother, she can't. Oh, no. You can't! Girls, please. After all, we did make a bargain. Didn't we, Cinderella? And I never go back on my word. How very clever. These beads, they give it just the right touch. Don't you think so, Drizella? No, I don't. I think she's... Oh! Why, you little thief! They're my beads. Give them here. Oh, no. And look, that's my sash. She's wearing my sash. Mine! Oh, please. Please, no. Thief! Girls, girls. That's quite enough. Hurry along now, both of you. I won't have you upsetting yourselves. Good night. You will lose your heartache  Whatever you wish for  You'll keep  Oh, no. No, it isn't true. Have faith in your  dreams and someday  It's just no use. Your rainbow will  come smiling through  No use at all. No matter how your  heart is grieving  If you keep on believing  I can't believe. Not any more. The dream that you wish  Will come true  There's nothing left to believe in. Nothing. Nothing, my dear? Oh, now you don't really mean that. Oh, but I do. Nonsense, child! If you'd lost all your faith, I couldn't be here. And here I am. Oh, come now. Dry those tears. You can't go to the ball looking like that. The ball? Oh, but I'm not... Of course, you are. But we have to hurry, because even miracles take a little time. Miracles? Mmmhmm. Watch. What in the world did I do with that magic wand? I was sure... Magic wand? That's strange. I always... Then you must be... Your fairy godmother? Of course. Where is that wand? I... Oh! I forgot. I put it away. Look at what she did. How'd she do it? Now, let's see. Hmm. I'd say the first thing you need is, um, a Pumpkin. A Pumpkin? Mmmhmm. Now, uh, the magic words. Uh... Oh! Salagadoolamenchikaboola  Bibbidibobbidiboo  Put 'em together and  what have you got?  Bibbidibobbidiboo  Salagadoolamenchikaboola  Bibbidibobbidiboo  It'll do magic Believe it or not  Bibbidibobbidiboo  Now salagadoola means  Menchikaboolaroo  But the thingamabob  that does the job  Is bibbidibobbidiboo  Salagadoolamenchikaboola  Bibbidibobbidiboo  Put 'em together and  what have you got?  Bibbidibobbidi  Bibbidibobbidi Bibbidibobbidiboo  Oh, looky. Isn't it wonderful? Oh, it's beautiful. Yes, isn't it? With an elegant coach like that, of course, we'll simply have to have mice! Mice? Oh, this really is nice. Why, we'll have a coach and four when we're through. Just a wave of my stick and to finish the trick, bibbidi, bobbidi, boo. Gracious, what did I do? I was sure there were four. There should be one more. There you are. Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo. Oh, poor Lucifer. Serves him right, I'd say. Now, um... Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes. You can't go to the ball without, um... a horse. Another one? But tonight, for a change, you will handle the reins, and sit in the driver's seat, too. For instead of a horse, you're the coachman, of course. Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo. That does it, I guess, except for... Oh, yes! The finishing touch. And, that's you. Yes, Bruno, that's right, you'll be footman tonight. Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo. Well, well, hop in, my dear. We can't waste time. But, uh... No, don't try to thank me. Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but... But, don't you think my dress... Yes, it's lovely, dear, Love... Good heavens, child. You can't go in that! Now, let's see, dear. Your size and the shade of your eyes. Mmmhmm. Something simple, but daring, too. Oh, just leave it to me. What a gown this will be. Bibbidibobbidi. Bibbidibobbidi. Bibbidibobbidiboo. Oh, it's a beautiful dress. Did you ever see such a beautiful dress? And, look, glass slippers. Why, it's like a dream. A wonderful dream come true. Yes, my child. But, like all dreams, well, I'm afraid this can't last forever. You'll have only till midnight, and then... Midnight? Thank you. Now, now, now, just a minute. You must understand, my dear, on the stroke of 12:00 the spell will be broken, and everything will be as it was before. Oh, I understand, but it's more than I ever hoped for. Bless you, my child. I... Goodness me! It's getting late. Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait. Have a good time. Dance, be gay. Now, off you go. You're on your way. With a bibbidibobbidi  Bibbidibobbidi  Bibbidibobbidiboo  Princess Frederica Eugenie de la Fontain. Mademoiselle Augustina DuBois. Daughter of General Pierre DuBois. The boy isn't cooperating. Mademoiselle Leonora Mercedes de la Tour. Daughter of Colonel and Madame de la Tour. I can't understand it. There must be at least one who'd make a suitable mother. Shh. Sire. A suitable wife. Mademoiselles Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine. Daughters of Lady Tremaine. I give up. Even I couldn't expect the boy to... Well, if I may say so, Your Majesty, I did try to warn you, but you, Sire, are incurably romantic. No doubt you saw the whole pretty picture in detail. The young Prince bowing to the assembly. Suddenly he stops. He looks up. For, lo, there she stands. The girl of his dreams. Who she is or whence she came, he knows not, nor does he care, for his heart tells him that here, here is the maid predestined to be his bride. A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire. But in real life, oh, no. No! It was foredoomed to failure. Failure, eh? Take a look at that, you pompous windbag. Who is she? You know her? No, Sire. I've never seen her before. That's one thing in her favour. The waltz. Quick, the waltz! Lights. The lights. Failure, eh? Well... Now for a good night's sleep. Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too... You will stay right here. See they're not disturbed, and when the boy proposes, notify me immediately. Notify me immediately. And remember, if anything goes wrong... La di da di la di da di  La di da di  La di um um um  Ba dum ba do  Ya dum ba dum dum dum dum  Who is she, Mother? Do we know her? Well, the Prince certainly seems to. I know I've never seen her. Nor I. But she certainly is... Wait. There is something familiar about her. Oh. Ahem. So this is love  So this is love  So this is what makes life  Divine  I'm all aglow  And now I know  And now I know  The key to all Heaven  Is mine  My heart has wings  And I can fly  I'll touch every star  In the sky  So this is the miracle  That I've been dreaming of  So this  Is  Love  Oh. Oh, my goodness. What's the matter? It's midnight. Yes, so it is. But why... Goodbye. No, no, wait. You can't go now. It's only... Oh, I must. Please. Please, I must. But why? Well, I... Oh, the Prince, I haven't met the Prince. The Prince? But didn't you know... Goodbye. No, wait. Come back. Please come back. I don't even know your name. How will I find you? Wait! Please wait. Good bye. Oh, I say. Young lady. Wait! The Prince! Just a moment. Guard! Guard! Stop that coach! Close those gates! Follow that coach! Open those gates! I'm sorry. I guess I forgot about everything. Even the time, but... But it was so wonderful. And he was so handsome, and when we danced... Oh, I'm sure even the Prince himself couldn't have been more... More... Oh, well, it's over and... Cinderelly. Look, look! The slippers! Yeah, your slipper. Your slipper, Cinderelly. Oh. Thank you. Thank you so much, for everything. Your Majesty, I see no point in beating about the bush. I regret to inform you, Sire, that the young lady has disappeared, leaving behind only this glass slipper. Yes. I'll do it. No. I just can't. Well, come in. Come in! Your Majesty... So, he's proposed already? Tell me about it. Well... Who is she? I didn't get a chance... No matter. We've more important things to discuss. Arrangements for the wedding, invitations, a national holiday. All that sort of thing. But, Sire... Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more. But... Better practise passing these out, eh? But, if you'd only listen. And for you, my friend. Your Majesty, please... A knighthood. I hereby dub you Sir... Um, uh... By the way, what title would you like? Sire? She got away. Sir ""She Got Away""? A peculiar title, but if that's what you... She what? Why, you... You... You traitor! Now, Sire. Remember, your blood pressure. Treason! No, Sire. No! Sabotage! You were in league with the Prince. I tried to stop her, but she vanished into thin air. A likely story. But it's true, Sire. All we could find was this glass slipper. The whole thing was a plot! But, Sire, he loves her. He won't rest till he finds her. He's determined to marry her. What? What did you say? The Prince, Sire, swears he'll marry none but the girl who fits this slipper. He said that, did he? We've got him! But, Sire, this slipper may fit one of any number of girls. That's his problem. He's given his word. We'll hold him to it. No, Your Highness. I'll have nothing to do with it. You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom. And if the shoe fits, bring her in. Yes, Your Majesty. Cinderella? Cinderella? Cinderella! Where is that... Yes? Here I am. My daughters, where are they? I think they're still in bed. Don't just stand there! Bring up the breakfast trays at once. And hurry! Wow. I wonder what's the matter. What's the matter with her? I don't know. Let's find out. Come on. Drizella. Drizella! What? Get up. Quick. This instant. We haven't a moment to lose. Anastasia. Get up, Anastasia. What for? Why? Everyone's talking about it, the whole kingdom. Hurry now. He'll be here any minute. Who will? The Grand Duke. He's been hunting all night. Hunting? For that girl. The one who lost her slipper at the ball last night. They say he's madly in love with her. The Duke is? No, no, no. The Prince! The Prince! You clumsy little fool. Clean that up, then help my daughters dress. What for? If he's in love with that girl, why should we even bother? Now, you two, listen to me. There is still a chance that one of you can get it. Huh? One of us? Why, Mother, what do you mean? Just this: No one, not even the Prince, knows who that girl is. We know! We know! Cinderelly! Cindere... The glass slipper is their only clue. The Duke has been ordered to try it on every girl in the kingdom. And if one can be found whom the slipper fits, then, by the King's command, that girl shall be the Prince's bride. His bride. His bride! Cinderella, get my things together. Never mind her. Get mine right away. What's the matter with her? Wake up, stupid. We've gotta get dressed. Dressed. Oh, yes. Oh, we must get dressed. It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me... Mother, did you see what she did? Are you just going to let her... Quiet! So this is love  What's she gonna do? Shh. I don't know. Gotta watch. Come on. Cinderelly! Cinderelly! So this is the miracle  That I've been dreaming of  What? Oh! Oh, no! No, please! Oh, you can't, you just can't. Let me out! You must let me out! You can't keep me in here! Oh, please. No, no. She can't do it. She can't lock up Cinderelly. I'm gonna... Shh. Please. Please. We gotta get that key, GusGus. We just gotta get that key. Whoa. He's over here, the DukeDuke. Yeah, yeah. Who? The Grand Duke, with the slipper. We gotta get that key quick. Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick. Oh, Mother, Mother, he's here, he's here. The Grand Duke. Do I look all right? I'm so excited, I just don't know what I'll do. Girls. Now, remember, this is your last chance. Don't fail me. Announcing His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke. You honour our humble home. Quite so. May I present my daughters, Drizella, Anastasia. Your Grace. Yes. Charmed, I'm sure. His Grace will read the royal proclamation. ""All loyal subjects of His Imperial Majesty ""are hereby notified by royal proclamation in regard to a certain ""glass slipper. ""It is decreed..."" Why, that's my slipper! Well, I like that. It's my slipper! No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper! How can she stand there... Girls. Your manners. A thousand pardons, Your Grace. Please continue. Yes, quite so. Eh, um... Oh, yes. ""It is upon this day decreed ""that a quest be instituted throughout... ""The sole and express purpose of such quest to be as follows: ""That every maid throughout the kingdom without exception, ""shall try on her foot this slipper of glass, ""and should one be found upon whose foot this slipper shall properly fit, ""such maiden shall be acclaimed the object of this search ""and shall be looked upon as the true love of His Royal Highness, ""our beloved son and heir, the noble Prince. ""Said Prince will, upon bended knee ""beg, request, or if need be, implore ""said maiden that he be granted her hand in marriage. ""Whereupon, should the aforementioned maiden ""look with favour, shall the couple pledge their troth... ""And in due course, upon the inevitable demise of His Majesty the King, ""succeed to the throne to rule over the land ""as King and Queen of our kingdom. ""So be it."" You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace. May we offer you some tea? What? Tea? Thank you, madam, no. We must proceed with the fitting. Of course. Anastasia, dear. There. I knew it was my slipper. Exactly my size. I always wear the same size. As soon as I saw it, I said... Oh, well... It may be a trifle snug today. You know how it is, dancing all night. I can't understand why. It's always fit perfectly before. I don't think you're half trying. Mother, can you... Shh. Quiet, my dear. We mustn't disturb His Grace. Young man, are you sure you're trying it on the right foot? Oh, it's the right foot, but... These glass shoes aren't always reliable. Come on, hurry. Up the stairs, up the stairs! Lucify, Lucify. Up, up, up with it. Oh! Here. Shh. Why can't you hold still a minute? Oh! My word. Enough of this! The next young lady, please. Did you hear that, Gus? Yup. Gotta hurry. Shh. Come on, come on, hurry. GusGus, GusGus, come on. Look, look. Just up there. Come on. Us is coming, Cinderelly. Us is coming. I can get you out. You've got the key! How did you ever manage to... Lucifer! Let him go, Lucifer. Please, let him go. Let him go. Let him go! Let him go. Let him out, you hear? Lucify, you... Bruno. Yes, Bruno! Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno! Oh! Of all the stupid little idiots. I'll do it myself. Get away from me. I'll make it fit. There. It fits. It fits? No! Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry. It shan't happen again. Precisely, madam. Come on, come on. Get up, GusGus, get up. Don't, don't, don't, don't. Let go, let go. You are the only ladies in the household I hope... I presume. There's no one else, Your Grace. Quite so. Good day. Good day. Your Grace? Your Grace, please, wait. May I try it on? Pay no attention. It's Cinderella. From the kitchen. Ridiculous. She's out of her mind. Just an imaginative child. Madam, my orders were ""every maiden."" Come, my child. Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible. The King, what will he say? What will he do? Perhaps, if it would help... No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing. But, you see, I have the other slipper. Have faith in dreams  And someday  Your rainbow will  come smiling through  No matter how your  heart is grieving  If you keep on believing  The dream that you wish  Will come true "
Lady and the Tramp,Disney,1950,1955,Animation," This is the night  It's a beautiful night  And they call it bella notte  Look at the skies  They have stars in their eyes  On this lovely bella notte  So take the love  Of your loved one  You'll need it about this time  To keep from falling like a star  When you make that dizzy climb  For this is the night  And the heavens are right  On this lovely  Bella notte  On this lovely  Bella notte   Silent as a snowflake in the night  Holy is the spirit of this night  All the world is calm and peaceful  All the world is bright and joyful  Spirit of love  And child of peace  Love unending  That shall not cease  Peace, my children  Of good will  Peace, my children  Peace be still  It's for you, darling. Merry Christmas. Oh, Jim, dear. It's the one I was admiring, isn't it? Trimmed with ribbons?  Well, it has a ribbon.  Oh, how sweet. You like her, darling? Oh, I love her. What a perfectly beautiful little lady. Come on, Lady. Over here. That's a girl. There, now. A nice little bed for you. But Jim, dear, are you sure she'll be warm enough? Why, of course, darling. She'll be snug as a bug in a... Uhoh! Almost forgot something. There. Good night, Lady. Now, now, don't worry, darling. She'll go right to sleep. No, no, Lady. This is where you belong, right here.  Oh, look. She's lonesome. Don't you think maybe? Just for tonight? Darling, if we're going to show her who's master, we must be firm from the very beginning.  Lady! Stop that now! Stop it!    Lady! Quiet, now. You hear me? Back to bed! Quick, now. Not one more sound.     Jim, dear.   Aw, Jim. Hmm? What?   Oh, all right. But remember, just for tonight.    All right, Lady. All right. I'm up. I'm up, Lady. Oh, no! What's wrong, Jim? What is it? Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?    Have you noticed, darling, since we've had Lady we see less and less of those disturbing headlines? Yes, I just don't know how we ever got along without her. Say, she must be about six months old. We'd better be getting her a license. Hope it fits. My, but it does look nice. So grown up. Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?   Four steps straight and then to the left  And right to the place where I marked it  With a bonnie, bonnie bone that I buried for me own  In my bonnie, bonnie bank in the backyard  Aha, that's a grand sight. Jock! Oh, Jock! Hello, Jock. Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie.  Notice anything different? Eh, uh... You've had a bath? No, not that. You've had your nails clipped? Mmmmm. Guess again. Well, I wouldn't abe knowin'. Whyo, lassie. A bonnie new collar. Do you like it? Aye.  Mmm. It must be very expensive. Have you shown it to Trusty yet? No. Ah, we'd best go at once. You know how sensitive he is about these things.    He's dreaming. Aye. Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days when he and his grandfather were trackin' criminals through the swamps. They were? That was before... Before what? 'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie. It shouldn't have happened to a dog. But, well... Trusty has lost his sense of smell. No! Aye. But we must never let on that we know, lassie. It would break his poor heart. Uh... Which way did he go? Which way did he go? Go? Yeah, big fella. About, uh, sixfoottwo. No, uh, three. Wore a striped suit. No collar. Why, Miss Lady. You have a collar. Mmhmm. And a license. My, my. How time does fly. Aye. It seems only yesterday she was cuttin' her teeth on Jim Dear's slippers, and now there she is, a fullgrown lady. Wearin' the greatest honor man can bestow. The badge of faith and respectability. That's right, Miss Lady. As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say... I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before. Aye, you have, laddie. Oh, yeah.  Ooh, it's Jim Dear. Please excuse me. Hello, there, Lady. Come on, beat you home. Oh, you win again. Steady, now. Steady. Well, what have we here? Oh, big girl now, huh? All right. Oh, ladies first. You know, darling, with Lady here I'd say life is quite complete. Yes, dear. I don't imagine anything could ever take her place in our hearts.      Ah! What a day! Well, now to dig up some breakfast. Hmm?  Aw, cute little rascals. Cootchiecootchiecoo. Now. That breakfast, let's see. Bernie's? Mmm... no. Francois... No, no. Nope. Too much starch. Ah! Tony's. Oh, that's it. I haven't been there in a week.  A beautiful day to make pizza  Hey, still we call it bella notte   Well, buon giorno, Butch. You wanta your breakfast, eh? OK. The boss, he's asaving some anice bones for you. Breakfast comin' up from aleft field. Good catch!  Whoa, boy, whoa.   Hey. Psst. Psst. Blimey. Look, Peg, it's the Tramp. Shh. Hiya, handsome. Come to join the party? All right. No time for wisecracks. I've got to get you out. I'm telling you, the pressure's on. Signs all over town. Gee, thanks. You're a bit of all right, chum. OK, OK, get going. Hey! What's going on there? Scram. And be careful.  Why, you mangy mutt. Hey. Let go. Let go of me. Well. Snob hill. Ha! Hi, gals. How's pickings? Pretty slim, eh? Yeah. I'll bet they've got a lid on every trash can. Uhoh. And a fence around every tree. I wonder what the leash and collar set does for excitement. Lassie. Lassie! Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am. Miss Lady! Ah! Good morning, lassie. 'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day. Uh... ...day. Why, Miss Lady. Is something wrong? Aye. Tell us, lassie. If somebody's been mistreatin' ya... Oh, no, Jock. It's something I've done, I guess. You? It must be. Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...   Jim Dear and Darling? Hush, lad. Now, lassie, get on with the details. Well, I first noticed it the other day when Jim Dear came home.   Down, Lady, down! Darling, darling! Are you all right? Of course I am. Why shouldn't I be? I just can't help worrying. After all, in your condition, alone here all day, and walking that dog... That dog! That dog? He's never called me that before. Well, now, lassie, I wouldn't worry my wee head about that. Remember, they're only humans, after all. That's right, Miss Lady. As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say... I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before. Aye, you have, laddie. Frequently. Oh, yeah. But now Darling is... Well... We've always enjoyed our afternoon romp together. But yesterday...     No, Lady. No walk today.   No, Lady. Not now. Lady! Drop that, Lady. Drop it, I say. It didn't hurt, really. But Darling has never struck me... before. Now, lassie. Do not take it too seriously. After all, at a time like this... Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady, there comes a time in the life of all humans when, uh... Well, as they put it, uh... Birds and the bees? Or... Well, uh... The stork. You know. Uh, no? Well, uh... What he's trying to say, lassie, is Darling is expecting a wee bairn. Bairn? He means a baby, Miss Lady. Oh. What's a baby? Well, they resemble humans. But I'd say a mite smaller. Aye. And they walk on all fours. And if I remember correctly, they bellow a lot. Aye. And they're very expensive. You will not be permitted to play with it. But they're mighty sweet. And very, very soft. Just a cute little bundle.  Of trouble. Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears... Aw, but shucks. Any dog can take that. It's what they do to your happy home. Move it over, will you, friend? Homewreckers, that's what they are. Homewreckers, that's what they are. Look here, laddie. Who are you to barge in? The voice of experience, buster. Just wait till junior gets here. You get the urge for a nice comfortable scratch, and, ""Put that dog out! He'll get fleas all over the baby."" You start barking at some strange mutt.  ""Stop that racket. You'll wake the baby."" And then! Then they hit you in the room and board department. Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef? Forget them. Leftover baby food. And that nice, warm bed by the fire?   A leaky doghouse. Oh, dear. Do not listen, lassie. No human is that cruel. Of course not, Miss Lady. Why, everybody knows a dog's best friend is his human.  Oh, come on now, fellas. You haven't fallen for that old line, now have you? Aye. And we've no need for mongrels and their radical ideas. Off with you, now. Off with you! OK, Sandy. The name's Jock. OK, Jock. Heather Lad of Glencairn to you! OK, OK, OK. But remember this, Pigeon. A human heart has only so much room for love and affection. When a baby moves in, the dog moves out. Uhhuh. Oh, let's see. That'll be about... Oh, well.  Darling? There isn't any way we can tell for sure what it's going to be, is there? I'm afraid not. Nobody ever knows for certain. All we can do is hope.      Darling, are you sure you want watermelon? Mmhmm. Oh, and some chop suey too. Chop su... Oh, all right, darling.   ... the cutest thing. Those booties! That bonnet. Adorable. Don't you love showers? I've never seen you more beautiful. Isn't she radiant? That's just what I told Bill. ""Bill"", I said, ""Darling looks positively radiant."" In all my days, ""I've never seen anyone as radiant.""  Aw, Jim, you look terrible. Absolutely horrible. I never saw you look worse. Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never lost a father yet.   Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy. Uhhuh, a boy. And... What's that? Eyes? Oh, what color are they? Well... Oh, gosh. II forgot to look. A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor! Doctor, it's a boy! Yes, yes, I know. Uhhuh, a boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy! It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!  Hello? Hello, Jim? Are you there, Jim? Central, we've been cut off. Hello? Hello? Hello!   What is a baby?  I just can't understand  It must be something wonderful  It must be something grand  Cos everybody's smiling  In a kind and wistful way  And they haven't even noticed  That I am around today  What is a baby, anyway?   Oh, what is a baby?  I must find out today  What makes Jim Dear and Darling  Act this way?     Oh, my little star sweeper  I'll sweep the stardust  For you   Little soft, fluffy sleeper  Here comes a pink cloud  For you   Little wandering angel  Fold up your wings  Close your eyes   And may love be your keeper   There, now. Little star sweeper. Dream on. Well, that should do it. We've got enough here to take us halfway to China.  Darling. Darling! We haven't much time. Jim, I just can't leave him. He's still so small and helpless. He'll be all right. Now come on. If he wakes up we'll never get away. Jim, I feel so guilty deserting him like this. Nonsense. Hey. What's the matter with Lady? She thinks we're running out on him. Oh, don't worry, old girl. We'll be back in a few days. And Aunt Sarah will be here. With you here to help her...  There's the old girl now. Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming! Sorry I'm late, dears. Hope I haven't kept you waiting. Let me take your things. No, no. No fussing. I know my way around. On your way, now. Mustn't miss your train. Have a good time, and don't worry about a thing. Goodbye, dears. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye. Now to see that big nephew of mine. Cootchiecootchiecoo.  Oh, you adorable little... Good gracious! What are you doing here? Go on, now. Shoo, shoo. Scat. Get out of here.  Aw, there, there. Aunt Sarah won't let that dog frighten you anymore. No, no, no.   Rockabye, baby on the treetop  When the wind blows  We are Siamese if you please   We are Siamese if you don't please  Now we looking over our new domicile  If we like we stay for maybe quite a while  Do you seeing that thing swimming round and round? Yesss. Maybe we can reaching in and make it drown. If we sneaking up upon it carefully...  There will be a head for you, a tail for me   Do you hear what I hear? A baby cry.  Where we're finding baby there are milk nearby  If we look in baby buggy there could be  Plenty milk for you and also some for me     What's going on down there? Merciful heavens! My darlings. My precious pets.  Oh. Ooh, that wicked animal. Attacking my poor, innocent little angels. Good afternoon, ma'am. What can I do for you? I want a muzzle. A good, strong muzzle. Oh, yes, ma'am. Now here's our latest. Combination leash and muzzle. Now, we'll just slip it on like this, and... No! No, no, no. Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle. Steady, now. Now... Now, now. Careful, you little... Watch out. Careful, doggy. Come back! Get over here, I say. Come back here.         Hey, Pige, what are you doing on this side of the tracks? I thought you... Wh? Aw, you poor kid. Oh, we've got to get this off. Hmm. I think I know the very place. Come on. Well, here we are. The zoo? Sure. No, no. This way. Follow me.  Oh. What's the matter, Pige? We can't go in. Why not? The sign says... Yeah, well, that's... That's the angle. Angle? Look. We'll just wait for the right... Uhoh. Here we are now. Just lay low.   Hey, you! I beg your pardon. Were you addressing? What's the matter? Can't you read? Why, yes, in several languages. Oh, a wise guy, eh? All right, now, what's this creature doing here? He's not my dog. Oh, he's not, eh? Go away. Get down. Go on. Why, certainly not, officer. I suppose you'll be tellin' me next it was the dog that was whistling, eh? I'm certain I don't know. Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I? Well, you listen to me. Aha! Resisting an officer of the law. You're gonna pay. Ow! Pull a knife on me, will you? Trying to assassinate me, you are. Carrying concealed weapons.  Come on, Pige. The place is ours.  We better go through this place from A to Z. Apes. No, no. No use even asking them. They wouldn't understand. They wouldn't? Uhuh. Too closely related to humans. Uhoh. Alligators. Now there's an idea. Say, Al, do you suppose you could nip this contraption off for us? Glad to oblige. Whoa. Whoa!  Ha! If anybody ever needed a muzzle, it's him. Timber! Pigeon, look out! Now what harebrained idiot would... Hey, look. A beaver. There's the answer to our problem. Let me see here. Sixfootsix and sevensixteenth inches. Pardon me, friend. I wonder if you'd do us a little... Busy, sonny. Busy. Can't stop to gossip now. Got to slide this sycamore to the...  ...swamp. Well, this will only take a second. Only a second? Listen, sonny. Do you realize every second, 70 centimeters of water is wasted over that spillway? Yeah, but... Gotta get this log movin', sonny. Gotta get it moving. Think the cuttin' takes the time? It's the doggone haulin'.  The haulin'. Exactly. Now, what you need... I'd better bisect this section here. What you need is a log puller. I said a log puller! I ain't deaf, sonny. There's no need to... Did you say log puller? And by a lucky coincidence you see before you, modeled by the lovely little lady, the new, improved, patented, handy dandy, neverfail little giant log puller. The busy beaver's friend. You don't say? Guaranteed not to wear, tear, rip or ravel. Turn around and show the customer the merchandise. And it cuts loghauling time 66 per cent. Sixtysix per cent, eh? Think of that. Well, how's it work? Why, it's no work at all. You merely slip this ring over the limb like this, and haul it off. Uh, say... You mind if I slip it on for size? Help yourself, friend. OK. Don't mind if I do. How do you get the consarned thing off, sonny? Glad you brought that up, friend. To remove it, simply place the strap between your teeth... Like this? Correct, friend. Now bite hard. You see? It's off. Say, that is simple. Well, friend, we'll be on our way now, so... Uhuh. Not so fast now, sonny... I'll have to make certain it's satisfactory before we settle on a price. Oh, no, it's all yours, friend. You can keep it. I can, eh? I can? Uhhuh. It's a free sample. Well, thanks a lot. Thanks ever so... Say! It works swell. But when she put that horrible muzzle on me... Say no more. I get the whole picture. Aunts. Cats. Muzzles. Well, that's what comes of tying yourself down to one family. Haven't you a family? One for every day of the week. The point is, none of them have me. I'm afraid I don't understand. It's simple. You see...  Hey.  Something tells me it's suppertime. Come on. I'll show you what I mean. Now take the Schultzes here. Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige, makes this his Monday home. Monday home? Ach, ja.  Monday is Mama Schultz cooking der Wiener Schnitzel. Mmm. Delicious. O'Brien's is where little Mike, that's me again, Pige, comes every Tuesday. Every Tuesday? Begorra. And that's when they're havin' their darlin' corned beef. You see, Pige, when you're footloose and collarfree, well, you take nothing but the best.  Hey! Tony's! Of course. The very place for a very special occasion. This way, Pige. I have my own private entrance. Wait here. Just one minute. I'm acomin'. I'm... What's amatter? Somebody's amakin' da April Fool with...  Oh, hello, Butch. Where you been so long?

Oh, dear. Is something wrong, Pige? It's morning. Yeah.  So it is. I should have been home hours ago. Why? Because you still believe in that, ""in the faithful old dog tray"" routine? Aw, come on, Pige. Open up your eyes. Open my eyes? To what a dog's life can really be. I'll show you what I mean. Look down there. Tell me what you see. Well, I see nice homes with yards and fences. Exactly. Life on a leash. Look again, Pige. There's a great big hunk of world down there with no fence around it. Where two dogs can find adventure and excitement. And beyond those distant hills, who knows what wonderful experiences? And it's all ours for the taking, Pige. It's all ours. It sounds wonderful. But? But who'd watch over the baby? You win. Come on. I'll take you home.    It's a beautiful night  And they call it...  Not to change the subject, but... Ever chased chickens? I should say not! Oh, ho! Then you've never lived. But we shouldn't. I know. That's what makes it fun. Aw, come on, kid. Start building some memories. But we... We won't hurt the chickens? Hurt 'em? No! We'll just stir 'em up a bit. Just look at those fat, lazy biddies. Why, they should've been up hours ago.   Some fun, eh, kid? Hey, what's going on in there?  What's that? That's the signal to get going. Come on.  This is living, eh, kid? Is it? Come on, Pige. Follow me. You know, there's a little bit of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige? Pige? Pige? Pige? Where are you, Pige? Pige? Pigeon? Oh, Pige!     Hey. Hey, Dachsie, how we coming? Just one more chorus and we're out. OK. On a downbeat. One, two...  Put her in number four, Bill, while I check her license. OK. All right, baby, in here. Well, look yous guys, Miss Park Avenue herself. Blimey. A regular bloomin' debutante. Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel she's wearin'. Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart? Putting fleas on the butler? All right, you guys. Lay off, will you? Aw, what's the matter, Peg? We was only havin' a bit of sport, we was. Can't you see the poor kid's scared enough already? Pay no attention, my little ochi chernye. That's right, dearie. They don't mean no real harm. It's like Gorky says in Lower Depths, quote: ""Miserable being must find more miserable being. Then he's happy."" Unquote. Boris is a philosopher. Besides, little bublichki, wearing license here, that is like waving, you should excuse the expression, red flag in front of bull. My license? But what's wrong with it? There ain't nothin' wrong with it, dearie. Confidential, there's not one dog here who would not give left hind leg for such a knickknack. That's your passport to freedom, honey. Without it...  Hey. Hey, yous guys, look. Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk. Where is he taking him? Through the oneway door, sister.  You... You mean he's... Oh, well. A short life and a merry one. Yeah, that's what the Tramp always says. The Tramp? Now there's a bloke The Tramp? Now there's a bloke what never gets caught. He's given the slip to every dogcatcher in this burg. You won't believe this, dearie, but no matter how tight a jam he's in, that Tramp always finds some way out. I can quite easily believe that. Ah, but remember, my friends, even Tramp has his Achilles heel. Pardon me, amigo. What is this ""chili heel""? Achilles heel, Pedro. This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses. Oh. Oh, the dames. Yeah. He has an eye for a wellturned paw, he has. Let's see. There's been Lulu. Yeah, and Trixie. Und Fifi. And my sister, Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua. I think. What a dog. Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg. What a dog! Peg used to be in the Dog and Pony Follies.  He's a tramp  But they love him  Breaks a new heart every day  He's a tramp  They adore him  And I only hope he'll stay that way  He's a tramp   He's a scoundrel  He's a rounder   He's a cad  He's a tramp  But I love him  Yes, even I have got it pretty bad   You can never tell  When he'll show up  He gives you plenty of trouble  I guess he's just a nocount pup  But I wish that he were double  He's a tramp  Bumbumbumruff  He's a rover  Bumbumbumruff  And there's nothin' more to say  Bumbumbumruff  If he's a tramp  He's a good one  And I wish that I could travel his way  Wish that I could travel his way  Wish that I could travel his way  Yeah. But he never takes them serious. Ah, but someday he is meeting someone different. Some delicate, fragile creature who's giving him a wish to shelter and protect. Like Miss Park Avenue here, eh, matey? Mmhmm. Could be. But when he does... Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya. Under the spell of true love... The poor chump grows careless... The Cossacks are picking him up... And it's curtains for the Tramp.  It's the little cocker, Bill. In number four. OK. All right, baby. They've come to take you home. You're too nice a girl to be in this place. Courage, man. Courage! But, uh... I've never even considered matrimony. Nor I. But no matter which of us she accepts, we'll always be the best of friends. Now remember, not a word about her unfortunate experience. We don't want to hurt her feelings. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Lassie. Miss Lady, ma'am. Please, I don't want to see anybody. Now, now, lassie. Don't feel that way about it. Of course not, Miss Lady. Why, some of the finest people I ever tracked down were jailbirds. Quiet! You great loony! Uh, please, lassie. We've come with a proposition. For helpin' ya. Help me? What do you mean? Well, now... You see, lassie... Neither of us is as young as we used to be. But we're still in the prime of life. Aye. And we've both got very comfortable homes. That's right. Where we know you'll be welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady. So... So, to come directly to the point...  If you could, uh, find it possible to, uh... To, uh... You're both very kind, and I do appreciate it. But... Oh, Pigeon. Oh, Pi... Oh! Oh, hi, boys. Anything new in the kennel club set?  A little something I picked up for you, Pige. Hmpf. Looks like I'm the one that's in the doghouse. If this person is annoying you, Miss Lady... We'll gladly throw the rascal out. That won't be necessary. Thank you. Very well, ma'am. You... You... ...mongrel! Aw, come on, Pige. It wasn't my fault. Hmpf. I thought you were right behind me. Honest. When I heard they'd taken you to the pound... Don't even mention that horrible place. I was so embarrassed and... And frightened. Oh, now, now. Who could ever harm a cute little trick like you? Trick? Trick! That reminds me, who is Trixie? Trixie? And Lulu and Fifi and Rosita Chiquita wh... Whatever her name is. Chiquita... Oh! Yes! Well, II... As far as I'm concerned, you needn't worry about your old heel. My heel? I don't need you to shelter and protect me. But... If you grow careless, don't blame me. I don't care if the Cossacks do pick you up! Goodbye. And take this with you.        Stop that. Hush, now, hush.  Stop that racket! What's wrong? A rat! Where? Upstairs, in the baby's room! How do I get in? The little door. On the porch.            Merciful heavens! Oh! Oh, you poor little darling. No, no, no. Thank goodness you're not hurt. You... You vicious brutes. Back! Get back! Go on! Get back! The pound. The pound, that's it. I'll call the pound.  Come here, you. Come here! Come on, come on. Come along. I'll call them this minute.  I won't sleep with that brute in the house.   Hello? Hello!  I don't care if you are alone there, young man. I insist you pick him up immediately.  Darling, look. If you want my advice you'll destroy that animal at once. Don't worry, ma'am. We've been after this one for months. We'll take care of him. What do you suppose? What's going on here? Just picking up a stray, mister. Come on, giddup.  Caught him attacking a baby. Heavens. My baby. Aunt Sarah! Aunt Sarah! Aunt Sarah! I was certain he was no good the moment I first laid eyes on him. Yeah, but, uh... I never thought he'd do a thing like that. I got there in time. There they were... I'm sure there must be some mistake. Lady wouldn't...  Watch out! That dog's loose. Keep her away. Nonsense. She's trying to tell us something.  What is it, old girl? What are you try... Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here. What is it?  Aaah! A rat! A rat? We should've known. I misjudged him. Badly. Come on. We got to stop that wagon. But man, we don't know which way they've gone. We'll track 'em down. And then? We'll hold 'em. Hold 'em at bay. Now what? The scent. Follow the scent. Ach. Let's face it, man. We both know you've lost your sense of smell.     Get out of here.  Go on, get away.  Easy. Go on, get away. Watch it now. Watch it!   Hi, Pige.   All right, everybody, watch the birdy.   Steady, now. Hold it.  I guess I used a little too much. Uhoh. Darling, visitors. Visitors? Why, it's Jock. And good old Trusty. Careful now, man. Careful. It's a wee bit slippery. Yes, it is. All right, boy. We'll let 'em in. No, no, not you, young man. You're going to take a nap. Well, Merry Christmas. Come in, come in. If you'll just step into the parlor I'll see about refreshments. Oh, darling, where did you put the dog biscuits? The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas. In the kitchen, Jim dear. Oh, no doubt about it. They've got their mother's eyes. Aye.  But there's a bit of their father in them too. Well, and I see you finally acquired a collar. Oh. Yes. Complete with license. Oh, yeah, a new collar. Caught the scent the moment I came in the house. Trusty, I says, Trusty, somebody's wearing a new collar. 'Course, my sense of smell is very highly developed. Runs in the family, you know. There'll be no livin' with him from now on. As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say... I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before. No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty. Huh? I haven't? Well, um... As Old Reliable used to say... He'd say, uh... He'd say... uh... Uh... Hmm. Doggone. You know, I clean forgot what it was he used to say.   Peace, my children  Of good will  Peace, my children  Peace  Be  Still  "
Peter Pan,Disney,1950,1953,Animation,"The second star to the right. Shines in the night for you. To tell you that the dreams you plan. Really can come true. The second star to the right. Shines with a light so rare. And if it's Never Land you need. Its light will lead you there. Twinkle, twinkle little star. So we'll know where you are. Gleaming in the skies above. Lead us to the land. We dream of. And when ourjourney is through. Each time we say. Good night. We'll thank the little star that shines. The second from. The right. All this has happened before. And it will all happen again. But this time it happened in London. It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury. That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family. And Peter Pan chose this particular house... because there were people here who believed in him. There was Mrs Darling. George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't be late for the party, you know. Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan was the spirit of youth. But Mr Darling... Mary, unless I find my cuff links... we don't go to the party. And if we don't go to the party, I can never show my face in the office again. And if I can never... Ouch! Well, Mr Darling was a practical man. The boys, however, John and Michael... believed Peter Pan was a real person... and made him the hero of all their nursery games. Blast you, Peter Pan! Take that! Give up, Captain Hook? Give up? Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand! Oh, no, John. It was the left hand. Oh, yes. Thank you, Wendy. Wendy, the eldest, not only believed... she was the supreme authority on Peter Pan... and all his marvellous adventures. Oh, Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic? Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog... kept her opinions to herself... and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance. Take that! Insolent boy! I'll slash you to ribbons! And I'll cut you to pieces. Aha! Ouch! Careful, Michael, my glasses. I'm sorry, John. You'll never leave this ship alive! Oh, yes, I will. Take that! Scuttle me bones, boy, I'll slit your gizzard. Oh, no, you won't. Back, back, back, you villain! Insolent pup! Wicked pirate! Aha, I got ya. You didn't either. You never touched me. Take that and that! And that! Boys, boys, less noise, please. Oh, hello, Father. You old bilge rat. WhWhWhat? Now, see here, Michael... Oh, not you, Father. You see, he's Peter Pan. And John's Captain Hook. Yes, yes, of course. Uh, have you seen my cuff... Oh, Nana, for goodness sake! Where are those cuff links? Cuff links, Father? Yes, the gold ones. Michael, the buried treasure. Where is it? I don't know. The map then. Where's the treasure map? It got lost. Good heavens, my shirt front! Hurray! You found it! You found it! Yes, so I have. And hereafter... Don't paw me, Michael. This is my last clean... No! No! George, dear, we really must hurry or we'll be late... Mary, look! George. It's only chalk, Father. Why, Michael. It's not his fault. It's in the story. And Wendy says... Wendy? Story? I might have known. Wendy! Wendy! Yes, Father? Would you kindly ex... Oh, Mother! You look simply lovely. Thank you, dear. Wendy. Just my old gown made over. But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't... Mary, if you don't mind. I'd like... Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt? What have I... Oh! Now, George, really. It comes right off. That's no excuse. Wendy, haven't I warned you? Stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories. Oh, but they aren't. I say they are. Captain Crook! Peter Pirate! Peter Pan, Father. Pan! Pirate! Poppycock! Oh, no, Father. Father, have you... Oh, you don't understand. Absolute poppycock! And let me tell you, this ridiculous... Now, George. ""Now, George. "". ""Now, George""! Well, ""Now, George,"" will have his say! Please, dear. Mary, the child's growing up. It's high time she had a room of her own. Father! George! What? No! I mean it! Young lady, this is your last night in the nursery. And that's my last word on the matter... No! No! Oh! Poor Nana. ""Poor Nana""? This is the last straw! Out! Out, I say! No, Father, no! Yes! There'll be no more dogs for nursemaids in this house! Goodbye, Nana. ""Poor Nana."" Oh, yes, ""Poor Nana. ."" But ""Poor Father""? Oh, no! Blast it! Where is that rope? Oh, thank you. Dash it all, Nana, don't look at me like that. It's nothing personal. It's just that... Well, you're not really a nurse at all. You're, well, a dog. And the children aren't puppies. They're people. And sooner or later, Nana, people have to grow up. But, Mother, I don't want to grow up. Now, dear, don't worry about it any more tonight. He called Peter Pan ""absolute poppycock."" I'm sure he didn't mean it, John. Father was just upset. Poor Nana, out there all alone. No more tears, Michael. It's a warm night. She'll be all right. Mother. What is it, dear? Buried treasure. Now, children. Don't judge your father too harshly. After all, he really loves you very much. Oh, don't lock it, Mother. He might come back. ""He""? Yes, uh, Peter Pan. You see, I found something that belongs to him. Oh? And what's that? His shadow. ""Shadow""? Mmm, Nana had it. But I... I took it away. Oh? Yes, of course. Good night, dear. But, George, do you think the children will be safe without Nana? Safe? Of course they'll be safe. Why not? Well, Wendy said something about a shadow, and I... Shadow? Whose shadow? Peter Pan's. Oh, Peter Pan... Peter Pan! You don't say. Goodness gracious, whatever shall we do? But, George... Really, I... Sound the alarm! Call Scotland Yard! There must have been someone. Oh, Mary, of all the impossible, childish fiddlefaddle. Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the children to grow up and be practical... George, dear. When you're as bad as they are. Please. No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas. Over there, Tink, in its den. Is it there? Must be here somewhere. Tink! Shh! Stop playing and help me find my shadow. Shadow. Oh, shadow. Huh? Aha! Peter Pan! Oh, Peter! I knew you'd come back. I saved your shadow for you. Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled. You know, you look exactly the way I thought you would. Oh, a little taller perhaps. But then... Oh, you can't stick it on with soap, Peter. It needs sewing. That's the proper way to do it. Although, come to think of it, I've never thought about it before. Uh, sewing shadows, I mean. Of course, I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it. And I said to myself, I said, ""I'll put it away for him until he comes back."" Oh, he's sure to come back."" And you did, didn't you, Peter?"" After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later. Uh, don't you agree? But what I still don't understand is how Nana got it in the first place. She really isn't... Oh, sit down. It won't take long. She really isn't vicious, you know. She's a wonderful nurse. Although Father says... Girls talk too much. Yes, girls talk too... Hmm? Oh. Well, get on with it, girl. Uh, my name is Wendy. Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl... Wendy's enough. Oh, uh, but how did Nana get your shadow, Peter? Jumped at me the other night at the window. Well, what were you doing there? I came to listen to the stories. My stories? But they're all about you. Of course. That's why I like 'em. I tell 'em to the Lost Boys. The Lost Boys... Oh, I remember. They're your men. Uhhuh. I'm so glad you came back tonight. I might never have seen you. Why? Because I have to grow up tomorrow. Grow up! Tonight's my last night in the nursery. But that means no more stories. Mmhmm. No! I won't have it. Come on! BuBuBut where are we going? To Never Land. Never Land! You'll never grow up there. Oh, Peter, it will be so wonderful. But wait. What would Mother say? Mother? What's Mother? Why, Peter, a mother is someone who... who loves and cares for you. And... And tells you stories... Good! You can be our mother. Come on. Now, just a minute, I... Let me see now. II have to pack. Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be back. Of course, I couldn't stay too long. And then I'll have to... Oh, but Never Land. Oh, I... II'm so happy I... I think I'll give you a... a kiss. What's a... a kiss? Oh, well, uh, II'll show you. Oh! Stop! Stop it, Tink! John, John, wake up! He's here. Huh? Jiminy! Ooh, what in the world was that? Tinker Bell. Don't know what got into her. Hello, Peter Pan. I'm Michael. And my name is John. How do you do? Hello. Oh, look, a firefly. A pixie. Amazing! What's the pixie doing? Talking. What did she say? She says you're a big, ugly girl. Oh. Well, I think she's lovely. Well, come on, Wendy, let's go. Where are we going? To Never Land. Never Land! Peter's taking us. ""Us""? Well, of course. II couldn't go without Michael and John. Oh, I should like very much to cross swords with some real buccaneers. Yes, and fight pirates too. Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders. Aye, aye, sir. Me too. But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land? Fly, of course. ""Fly""? It's easy. All you have to do is to... is to... Is to... Ha! That's funny. What's the matter? Don't you know? Oh, sure. It's... It's just that I never thought about it before. Say, that's it! You think of a wonderful thought. Any happy, little thought? Uhhuh. Like toys at Christmas? Sleigh bells, snow? Yep! Watch me now. Here I go! It's easier than pie. He can fly! He can fly! He flewed! Now you try. I'll think of a mermaid lagoon... underneath a magic moon. I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave. I think I'll be an Indian brave. Now everybody try. One, two, three! We can fly! We can fly! We can fly! This won't do. What's the matter with you? All it takes is faith and trust. Oh! And something I forgot. Dust! Dust? Dust? Yep, just a little bit of pixie dust. Now, think of the happiest things. It's the same as having wings. Let's all try it just once more. Look! We're rising off the floor. Jiminy! Oh, my! We can fly! You can fly! We can fly! Come on, everybody. Here we go! Off to Never Land! Think of a wonderful thought. Any merry little thought. Think of Christmas Think of snow. Think of sleigh bells off you go like reindeer in the sky. You can fly, you can fly You can fly. Think of the happiest things. It's the same as having wings. Take the path that moonbeams make. If the moon is still awake you'll see him wink his eye. You can fly, you can fly You can fly. Up you go with a heigh and ho. To the stars beyond the blue. There's a Never Land waiting for you. Where all your happy dreams come true. Every dream that you dream will come true. Come on, Nana! When there's a smile in your heart. There's no better time to start. Think of all thejoy you'll find. When you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye. You can fly, you can fly You can fly, you can fly. You can fly. There it is, Wendy. Second star to the right and straight on till morning. When there's a smile in your heart. There's no better time to start. Think of all thejoy you'll find when you leave the world behind. And bid your cares goodbye. You can fly, you can fly You can fly, you can fly. You can fly. You can fly, you can fly You can fly oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life. Arovin'over the sea Give me a career as a buccaneer. It's the life of a pirate for me, oh.

Here we are, collecting barnacles on this miserable island. While his nibs plays ringaroundtherosy with Peter Pan. Look out. It might go off. We ought to be tending to the business of looting ships. Why, I've almost forgotten how to slit a throat. Better hop it. And tell the captain... we wants to put to sea, see? Peter Pan... Blast that Peter Pan! If I could only find his hideout, I'd trap him in his lair. But where is it? Mermaid Lagoon? No, we've searched that. We've combed Cannibal Cove. HHere! No. No, no, no! That's Indian terri...

Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was only a childish prank, you might say. Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile! That cursed beast liked the taste of me so well... he's followed me ever since, licking his chops... for the rest of me. And he'd have had you by now, Captain... if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock. But now when he's about, he warns ya as ya might say with his ticktock... ticktock, ticktock. Smee? Smee!

Want to hear about the time I cut off Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile? Oh, I've always liked that one. Me too. Well, there I was on Marooner's Rock surrounded... Oh, Peter! By 40 or 50 pirates. Who's she? Huh? Her? Oh, that's Wendy. A girl? What's she doing here? And in her nightdress too. Come on, dearie. Join us for a swim. Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it. Oh, but you must! We insist! No, no, please! Too good for us, eh? Peter! If you dare to come near me again... Wendy! Wendy! They were just having a little fun, weren't you, girls? That's all. We were only trying to drown her. Ya see? Well, if you think for one minute... that I'm going to put up with a... Shh. Hold it, Wendy. Yep, it's Hook, all right. Hook! Hook! Hook! Oh! Quick, Wendy. They've captured Tiger Lily. Looks like they're headin' for Skull Rock. Come on, Wendy. Let's see what they're up to. Now, me dear Princess, this is me proposition. You tell me the hiding place of Peter Pan... and I shall set you free. You dog. Poor Tiger Lily. Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee? Oh, yes, always, Captain. You'd better talk, me dear, for soon the tide will be in... and then it will be too late. I'll show the old codfish. Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun. ""Fun""? Remember... there is no path through water... to the happy hunting ground. This is your last chance, Tiger Lily! Manatoa, great spirit of mighty seawater, speak! Beware, Captain Hook! Beware! Beware! Did you hear that, Smee? It's an evil spirit, Captain. Stand by, Smee, while I take a look around. Spirit of the great seawater, is it? Psst! Wendy. Watch this. Mr Smee! Uh, yes, Captain? Release the princess and take her back to her people. Aye, aye, sir. Release the princess... But... But, Captain... Those are me orders, Mr Smee! Aye, aye, sir. Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses. Odd's fish! I told him all along you Indians wouldn't betray Peter Pan. And just what do you think you are doing, Mr Smee? Just what you told me, Captain. Carryin' out your orders. My orders? Why, yes, Captain. Didn't you just say to go... Put her back! You blithering idiot! My orders. Of all the bumbling... Mr Smee! Just exactly what do you think you are doing? Putting her back like you said, Captain. I said nothing of the sort! Oh, but, CCaptain, dddidn't you? I thought that... For the last time, Mr Smee. Take the princess back to her people. Understand? Understand? Understand? Understand? Uh, aye, aye, sir. Oh, and one more thing. When you return to the ship, tell the whole crew... to help themselves to me best rum. Peter! Here's your spirit, Smee! Why, it's Peter Pan. Scurvy brat! Thank you, Captain. Come down, boy, if you've a taste for cold steel. Watch this, Wendy. Oh, Peter, do be careful. Try your luck, Mr Smee? Let him have it! Well, come on, you idiot! Blast him! Right here, Mr Smee. Hold it, you fool! No! No! Captain? Oh, how dreadful. What a pity, Mr Smee. I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain. Captain! In the back, Captain? Give it to him, Captain! Cleave him to the brisket. I've got you this time, Pan. Well, well, a codfish on a hook. I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do! I say, Captain, do you hear something? No. No! No! Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish? You do? Oh, Peter, no! No! Smee! DDon't go away, Captain! Uh, stay right there now, sir. I'll save ya, sir. Smee! Smee! Smee! Ow! Captain! Captain! Smee! Smee!

Making a fool out of me. Oh, my head. Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life. Your hot water, Mr Smee. Shh! The poor Captain has a splitting headache. We mustn't annoy him. Well, Captain, it's nice to see you smiling again. Brings back the good old days when we was leadin' a healthy, normal life. Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats. Oh, Captain... why don't we put to sea again? You know, there's trouble brewin' on the island. Women trouble. I wouldn't want this to go any farther, but... the cook told me that the first mate told him... that he heard that Pan has banished Tinker Bell. Whoa! Why, you doddering imbecile, I... Did you say Pan... has banished Tinker Bell? Aye, aye, Captain. That he has. But why? Well, on account of Wendy, Captain. Tink tried to do her in, she did. Tink's terrible jealous. Well, well. That's why we ought to leave, Captain. This ain't no place for a respectable pirate. That's it, Smee! That's it! I'm glad you agrees, Captain. Quick, me coat. Me best dress coat. Aye, aye, sir. The sooner we get going, the better. Ah, yes, a jealous female can be tricked into anything. My case of hooks! Aye, aye, sir. Here you are, sir. Your Sunday set, sir. If we impress the pixie, convince her we're eager to help her... the wench may chart our course to a... certain hiding place. Our best hiding place is the Spanish main, sir. I'll set our course... And where do you think you are going? TTo tell the boys we sails with the tide, sir. You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell... and bring her to me. Understand? Aye, aye, ssssir. How! How! What's the Chief doing, John? He's delivering an oration in sign language. What's he saying? He says... ""Peter Pan, mighty warrior. ""Save Tiger Lily. Make big Chief heap glad. "". Well, he certainly doesn't look ""heap glad. "". Make Peter Pan heap big chief. You now Little Flying Eagle. Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle! Hurray! Hurray! Oh, how wonderful! Hurray!

I'm glad to hear that, Captain. I'll tell the crew and... And that's why I asked you over, me dear... to tell Peter I bear him no ill will. Oh, Pan has his faults, to be sure. Uh, bringing that Wendy to the island, for instance. Dangerous business, that. Why, rumour has it that already she has come between you and Peter. But what's this? Tears? Then it is true. Oh, Smee. The way of a man with a maid. Taking the best years of her life and then... casting her aside like an old glove! Ain't it a bloomin' shame? But we mustn't judge Peter too harshly, me dear. It's that Wendy who's to blame. Mr Smee, we must save the lad from himself. But how? We've so little time. We sail in the morning. Sail! That's it, Smee! We'll shanghai Wendy. ""Shanghai Wendy, "" Captain? Take her to sea with us. With her gone, Peter will soon forget this mad infatuation. Come, Smee, we must leave immediately. Surround Peter's home... But, Captain, we... we don't know where Peter Pan lives! Great Scott, you're right, Smee! What's that, my dear? You could show us the way? Why, I never thought of that. Take this down, Smee.

Yeah! See ya, Peter. They'll be back. Peter. Goodbye, Peter. All right, men. Take them away. And now, Smee, to take care of Master Peter Pan.

But Captain Hook is most insistent, Wendy. Yeah! He says we'll walk the plank if we don't. Oh, no, we won't. Peter Pan will save us. Peter Pan will save them, Smee. Peter Pan will save them. Oh, Captain, you did it. But a thousand pardons, my dear. I don't believe you are in on our little joke. You see, we left a present for Peter. Sort of a surprise package, you might say. Why, I can see our little friend at this very moment... reading the tender inscription. ""To Peter, with love from Wendy. Do not open till 6 o'clock. "". Huh. I wonder what's in it. Could he but see within the package... he would find an ingenious little device. Set, so that when the clock is like this... Peter Pan will be blasted... out of Never Land forever. No! But time grows short. We have but 18 seconds. Fifteen seconds. Thirteen seconds. Twelve seconds. Well, I guess I can open it now. Hey, Tink. Look what Wendy left. Hey, stop that! Stop it!

I knew Peter Pan would save us, and he did. And we all called him a codfish! Uh, Captain Hook, I mean. And then we sailed away on a ship in the sky. Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed. Oh, Mother. He really is wonderful, isn't he? See how well he sails the ship. George. George! Now what, Mary? Nana, ddid you see... You know, I have the strangest feeling... that I've seen that ship before. A long time ago... when I was very young. George, dear. Father. When there's a smile in your heart. There's no better time to start. Think of all thejoy you'll find. When you leave the world behind. And bid your cares goodbye. You can fly. You can fly. You can fly"
Sleeping Beauty,Disney,1950,1959,Animation,"I know you I walked with you once upon a dream I know you The gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom all they seem But if I know you I know what you'll do You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream In a faraway land long ago... lived a king and his fair queen. Many years had they longed for a child, and finally their wish was granted. A daughter was born, and they called her Aurora. Sweet Aurora Yes, they named her after the dawn, for she filled their lives with sunshine. Then a great holiday was proclaimed throughout the kingdom... so that all of high or low estate... might pay homage to the infant princess. And our story begins on that most joyful day. On that joyful day On that joyful day Joyfully now to our Princess we come Bringing gifts and all good wishes too We pledge our loyalty anew Hail to the Princess Aurora All of her subjects adore her Hail to the King Hail to the Queen Hail to the Princess Aurora Health to the Princess Wealth to the Princess Long live the Princess Aurora Hail Aurora Hail Aurora Health to the Princess Wealth to the Princess Long live the Princess Aurora Hail to the King Hail to the Queen Hail to the Princess Aurora Thus, on this great and joyous day... did all the kingdom celebrate the longawaited royal birth. And good King Stefan and his queen made welcome their lifelong friend. Their Royal Highnesses, King Hubert and Prince Phillip! Fondly had these monarchs dreamed one day... their kingdoms to unite. Thus, today would they announce that Phillip, Hubert's son and heir, to Stefan's child would be betrothed. And so to her his gift he brought... and looked unknowing on his future bride. Their most honored and exalted excellencies, the Three Good Fairies! Mistress Flora, Mistress Fauna... and Mistress Merryweather! Oh! Oh! The little darling. Your Majesties. Your Majesties. Your Majesties. Each of us the child may bless with a single gift, no more, no less. Little Princess, my gift shall be the gift of beauty. One gift Beauty rare Gold of sunshine In her hair Lips that shame the red, red rose She'll walk with springtime Wherever she goes Tiny Princess, my gift shall be the gift of song. One gift The gift of song Melody her whole life long The nightingale's her troubadour Bringing his sweet serenade to her door Sweet Princess, my gift shall be the__ Why, it's Maleficent. What does she want here? Shh! Well, quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan. Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and__ How quaint. Even the rabble. I really felt quite distressed at not receiving an invitation. You weren't wanted. Not wa__ Oh, dear, what an awkward situation. I had hoped it was merely due to some oversight. Well, in that event, I'd best be on my way. And you're not offended, Your Excellency? Why, no, Your Majesty. And to show I bear no ill will, I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child. Listen well, all of you. The Princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty, beloved by all who know her. But... before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel... and die. Oh, no! Seize that creature! Stand back, you fools! Don't despair, Your Majesties. Merryweather still has her gift to give. Then she can undo this fearful curse? Oh, no, Sire. Maleficent's powers are far too great. But she can help. But__ Just do your best, dear. Yes, go on. Sweet Princess, if through this wicked witch's trick... a spindle should your finger prick, a ray of hope there still may be in this, the gift I give to thee. Not in death, but just in sleep... the fateful prophecy you'll keep. And from this slumber you shall wake... when true love's kiss the spell shall break. For true love Conquers all But King Stefan, still fearful of his daughter's life, did then and there decree that every spinning wheel in the kingdom... should on that very day be burned. So 'twas done. Oh, silly fiddlefaddle! Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear. I'm sure it'll work out somehow. Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent. Of course not. But what will? Well, perhaps if we reason with her. Reason? With Maleficent? Well, she can't be all bad. Oh, yes, she can! Ooh, I'd like to turn her into a fat, old hoptoad. Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say. Besides, we can't. You know our magic doesn't work that way. It can only do good, dear, to bring joy and happiness. Well, that would make me happy. But there must be some way. There is! There is? What is it, Flora? I'm going to__ Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! Even walls have ears. Follow me. I'll turn her into a flower. Maleficent? Oh, no, dear. The Princess. Oh, she'd make a lovely flower. Don't you see? A flower can't prick its finger. It hasn't any. That's right. She'll be perfectly safe. Until Maleficent sends a frost. Yes! Eh__ Oh, dear. She always ruins your nicest flowers. You're right. And she'll be expecting us to do something like that. Oh! Well, what won't she expect? She knows everything. Oh, but she doesn't, dear. Maleficent doesn't know anything about love... or kindness or the joy of helping others. You know, sometimes I don't think she's really very happy. That's it! Of course. It's the only thing she can't understand and won't expect. Now, now, now, we'll have to plan it carefully. Let's see. The woodcutter's cottage. Yes, yes, the abandoned one. Of course, the King and Queen will object. But when we explain it's the only way__ Explain what? About the three peasant women raising a foundling child... deep in the forest. Oh? Oh, that's very nice of them. Who are they? Turn around. Eww! Why, it's us! Uhhuh. You mean, ""we"" us? Uhhuh. Take care of the baby? Why not? Oh, I'd like that! Well, yyes, but wwwe'd have to feed it a__ And wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep. Oh, I'd love it. Do you really think we can? If humans can do it, so can we. And we'd have our magic to help us. That's right. No, no, no, no, no, no! No magic! I'll take those wands right now. Oh, better get rid of those wings too. You mean live like mortals? For sixteen years? Uhhuh. BBu__ Now, now, we__ we don't know how. We've never done anything without magic. And that's why Maleficent will never suspect__ But__ But who'll wash? And cook? Oh, we'll all pitch in. I'll take care of the baby. Let me have it, dear. Come along now. We must tell their Majesties at once. Flora? Flora? So the King and his Queen watched with heavy hearts... as their most precious possession, their only child, disappeared into the night. Many sad and lonely years passed by... for King Stefan and his people. But as the time for the Princess's sixteenth birthday drew near, the entire kingdom began to rejoice. For everyone knew that as long as Maleficent's domain, the Forbidden Mountains, thundered with her wrath and frustration, her evil prophecy had not yet been fulfilled. It's incredible! Sixteen years, and not a trace of her. She couldn't have vanished into thin air! Are you sure you searched everywhere? Yes, yes, uh, everywhere. We all did. Yeah, yeah! Uhhuh, yeah. And what about the town? The forest? The mountains? Yeah, we searched mountains, uh, uh, uh, uh, forests... and, uh, houses, and, uh__ Let me see. Uh, and all the cradles. Cradle? Yep, yep. Every cradle. Cradle? Did you hear that, my pet? All these years, they've been looking for a baby. Fools! Idiots! Imbeciles! Oh, they're hopeless. A disgrace to the forces of evil. My pet, you are my last hope. Circle far and wide. Search for a maid of sixteen... with hair of sunshine gold... and lips red as the rose. Go, and do not fail me. And so, for sixteen long years, the whereabouts of the Princess remained a mystery. While deep in the forest in a woodcutter's cottage, the good fairies carried out their welllaid plan. Living like mortals, they had reared the child as their own... and called her Briar Rose. On this, her sixteenth birthday, the good fairies had planned a party... and something extra special for a surprise. Well, now, how about this one? This is the one I picked. Oh, she'll look beautiful in that. Now, I thought a few changes here. Uhhuh. And don't forget a pretty bow. Yes, and raise the shoulder line. We'll make it blue. Oh, no, dear, pink. But__ Of course, we'll need a few pleats. Yes, but how are we gonna get her out of the house? Oh, I'll think of something. Well, and what are you three dears up to? Up to? Up to? Up to? Uh, uh__ ThThThe__ Cr__ Uh__ Well, we__ Uh, we__ WWe__ We want you to pick some berries. That's it, berries! Berries? Lots of berries. But II picked berries yesterday. Oh, wwe need more, dear. Lots, lots more. Yes! Now don't hurry back, dear. But don't go too far. And don't speak to strangers. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! I wonder if she suspects. Of course not. Come on! Oh, will she be surprised. A real birthday party. With a real birthday cake. Yes, and a dress a princess can be proud of. I'll get the wands. Yes, you can, uh__ The wands? Oh, no! No magic! But the sixteen years are almost over. We're taking no chances. But I've never baked a fancy cake. Oh, you won't have to, dear. I'm going to bake the cake. You? Oh, she's always wanted to, dear. And this is her last chance. Well__ I'm going to make it fifteen layers with pink and blue forgetmenots. And I'm making the dress. But you can't sew, and she's never cooked. Ohhoho, it's simple! All you do is follow the book. Up here, dear. You can be the dummy. Well, I still say we ought to use magic. ""Flour, three cups."" Cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups, cups. Oh. One, two, three. What's that for? Well, it's got to have a hole in the bottom. That's for the feet to go through. It's pink. Oh, lovely shade, isn't it? But I wanted it blue. Now, dear, we decided pink was her color. You decided! ""Two eggs. Fold in gently."" Fold? Uh, oh, well. I can't breathe! Let me out of here. It looks awful. That's because it's on you, dear. ""Now, yeast, one tsp."" ""Tsp.""? One teaspoon. Oh, one teaspoon, of course! Hmm! Oh, gracious, how that child has grown. Oh, it seems only yesterday we brought her here. Just a tiny baby. Why, Merryweather. What ever is the matter, dear? After today, she'll be a princess, and we won't have any Briar Rose. Oh, Flora! Now, now, now, now. Well, we__ we all knew this day had to come. But why did it have to come so soon? After all, we've had her for sixteen years. Sixteen wonderful years. Oh, gracious! We're acting like a lot of ninnies. Come on. She'll be back before we get started. You hear that, Samson? Beautiful. What is it? Come on. Let's find out. Aw, come on. For an extra bucket of oats? And a few carrots? Hup, boy! Whoa! No carrots. I wonder I wonder I wonder why each little bird Has a someone To sing to Sweet things to A gay little love melody I wonder I wonder If my heart keeps singing Will my song go winging To someone Who'll find me And bring back a love song To me Oh, dear. Why do they still treat me like a child? Who? Aunt Flora and Fauna and Merryweather. They never want me to meet anyone. But you know something? I fooled them. I have met someone. Who? Who? Who? Oh, a prince. Well, he's tall and handsome and__ and so romantic. Oh, we walk together and talk together; and just before we say goodbye, he takes me in his arms... and then... I wake up. Yes, it's only in my dreams. But they say if you dream a thing more than once, it's sure to come true; and I've seen him so many times. You know, Samson, there was something strange about that voice. Too beautiful to be real. Maybe it was some mysterious being, a wood sprite or a__ Here, stop! Why, it's my dream prince. Your Highness. You know, I'm really not supposed to speak to strangers, but we've met before. I know you I walked with you once upon a dream I know you The gleam in your eyes Is so familiar a gleam Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom all they seem But if I know you I know what you'll do You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream But if I know you I know what you'll do You'll love me at once The way you__ The way you did Once upon a dream Oh! Oh! I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. Oh, it, uh, wasn't that. It's just that you're a__ a__ A stranger? Mmhmm. But don't you remember? We've met before. We__ We have? Why, of course. You said so yourself. Once upon a dream. I know you I walked with you once upon a dream I know you The gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam And I know it's true That visions are seldom all they seem But if I know you I know what you'll do You'll love me at once The way you did Once upon a dream Who are you? What's your name? Hmm? Oh, my name. Why, it's__ it's__ Oh, no, no, I can't! I__ Goodbye! But when will I see you again? Oh, never! Never! Never? Well, maybe someday. When? Tomorrow? Oh, no! This evening! Where? At the cottage in the glen. There. Ooh! Well, what do you think of it? Why, it's__ It's a very unusual cake, isn't it? Yes. Of course, it'll be much stiffer after it's baked. Of course, dear. Um, what do you think of the dress? Well, iit's, uh__ IIt's not exactly the way it is in the book, is it? Oh, I improved it. But perhaps if I added a few more ruffles, uh__ Uh, what do you think? Um, I think so. What do you think, Merryweather? I think we've had enough of this nonsense! I think we ought to think of Rose and what she'll think of this mess. I still think what I thunk before. I'm going to get those wands. You know, I think she's right. Here they are, good as new. Ah, ah, ah! CCCCCCareful, Merryweather! Quick, lock the doors. Uh, Fauna, you close the windows. Oh, block up every cranny. We can't take any chances. Now, you take care of the cake. While I__ Clean the room, dear. And I'll make the dress. Now hurry! Ooh! Come on, bucket, mop, broom. Flora says clean up the room. And now to make a lovely dress... fit to grace a fair princess. Eggs, flour, minute__ Just do it like it says here in the book. I'll put on the candles. Oh, no, not pink. Make it blue. Merryweather! Make it pink. Make it blue. Oh, pink! Blue. Ohh, now look what you've done! Shh, shh, shh! Listen. It's Rose. She's back. Enough of this foolishness. Make it pink. Now hide, quick! Blue. Aunt Flora! Good gracious! Who left the mop running? Stop, mop. Aunt Flora! Fauna! Merryweather! Where is everybody? Oh! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Happy birthday! Oh, you darlings! This is the happiest day of my life. Everything's so wonderful. Just wait 'til you meet him. Him? Rose! YYou've met some stranger? Oh, he's not a stranger. We've met before. You have? Where? Once upon a dream. I know you I walked with you once upon a dream She's in love! Oh, no. This is terrible. Why? After all, I am sixteen. It isn't that, dear. You're already betrothed. Betrothed? Since the day you were born. To Prince Phillip, dear. But that's impossible. How could I marry a prince? I'd have to be__ A princess. And you are, dear. Princess Aurora. Tonight, we're taking you back to your father, King Stefan. But__ But I can't. He's coming here tonight. I promised to meet him. I'm sorry, child, but you must never see that young man again. Oh, no! No! I can't believe it! No! No! And we thought she'd be so happy. No sign of her yet, Hubert. 'Course not. It's a good half hour 'til sunset. Ah, excellent bird. Oh, now, come, man! Buck up! Battle's over! Girl's as good as here. I'm sorry, Hubert, but after sixteen years... of worrying, never knowing__ The past! All in the past.

It's that boy she met. What ever are we going to do? Ohh! I don't see why she has to marry any old prince. Now, that's not for us to decide, dear. Maybe we should tell King Stefan about the boy. Well, why don't we? Listen! Maleficent! Rose! Rose! Rose! Oh, why did we leave her alone? No! No! Rose! Rose! Here. Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose, where are you? Rose! Rose! Where are you? Rose! Rose! Rose!

But we can't__ we can't go there. We can, and we must! What a pity Prince Phillip can't be here... to enjoy the celebration. Come. We must go to the dungeon and cheer him up. Oh, come now, Prince Phillip. Why so melancholy? A wondrous future lies before you. You, the destined hero... of a charming fairy tale come true. Behold, King Stefan's castle. And in yonder topmost tower, dreaming of her true love, the Princess Aurora. But see the gracious whim of fate. Why, 'tis the selfsame peasant maid... who won the heart of our noble prince but yesterday. She is indeed most wondrous fair, gold of sunshine in her hair, lips that shame the red, red rose. In ageless sleep, she finds repose. The years roll by. But a hundred years to a steadfast heart are but a day. And now, the gates of a dungeon part, and our prince is free to go his way. Off he rides on his noble steed__ a valiant figure, straight and tall__ to wake his love... with love's first kiss... and prove that true love conquers all! Why, you, you, y__ Come, my pet. Let us leave our noble prince... with these happy thoughts. A most gratifying day. For the first time in sixteen years, I shall sleep well. Shh! No time to explain. Wait, Prince Phillip. The road to true love... may be barred by still many more dangers... which you alone will have to face. So arm thyself with this enchanted shield of virtue... and this mighty sword of truth, for these weapons of righteousness will triumph over evil. Now, come. We must hurry. Phillip, watch out! Silence! You, tell those fools to__ No! No! Watch out, Phillip! Hurry! Hurry, Phillip! A forest of thorns shall be his tomb, borne through the skies on a fog of doom! Now go with a curse and serve me well. 'Round Stefan's castle cast my spell. No! It cannot be! Now shall you deal with me, O Prince, and all the powers of hell! Up! Up this way! Now, sword of truth, fly swift and sure... that evil die and good endure! Ehhh__ Oh, oh, uh__ Forgive me, Hubert. Ehh, uh, the wine. Now, uh__ You, uh, were saying? Huh? II was? Oh! Oh, yes. Well, after all, Stefan, this is the fourteenth century. Yes. You, uh, you said that a moment ago. Well, to come right to the point, my son Phillip says he's going to marry__ It's Aurora! She's here!

One Hundred and One Dalmatians,Disney,1960,1961,Animation,"My story begins in London... not so very long ago. Yet so much has happened since then, that it seems like an eternity. At that time, I lived with my pet... in a bachelor flat just off Regents Park.  It was a beautiful spring day, a tedious time of the year for bachelors. Oh... that's my pet, Roger Radcliff, a musician of sorts. I'm the one with the spots. My name's Pongo. As far as I could see, the old notion that a bachelor's life was so... glamorous and carefree was all nonsense. It was downright dull.  It was plain to see that my old pet needed someone. But if it were left up to Roger, we'd be bachelors forever. He was married to his work, writing songs. Songs about romance... of all things, something he knew absolutely nothing about. Oh, he's intelligent enough, as humans go. And I think you could say, Roger is a rather handsome animal in his way. I could see no reason why my pet... didn't deserve an attractive mate. At least I was determined to do my best. Of course, dogs are a pretty poor judge of human beauty. But I had a rough idea... of what to look for. Hmm! Unusual breed.  Very unusual. Hmm! Oh, surely not. Well now, what have we here? Hmm. Well, a little... too short coupled. Nope! I say! Well, I do say! Now there's a fancy breed. Hmm. Perhaps a little too fancy. Yes, much too fancy. Too old. Too young. It was a problem, a real problem. Well, now that's a bit more like it! The most beautiful creature on four legs! Now if only the girl... Well! She's very lovely too. It was almost too good to be true. I'd never find another pair like that, not if I looked for 100 years. Ah, they're heading for the park. A perfect meeting place... if I can only arrange it. Uhoh... but Roger never stopped work 'til after 5:00. That would be too late.  After 5:00 already. Fancy that.  All right, Pongo. All right, boy.   Pongo, boy, take it easy! What's all the hurry?   Pongo, boy, slow down. I was afraid we'd missed them. Perhaps they passed on by the park. Then suddenly... I spotted them. It was a perfect situation if I planned it right. I couldn't depend on Roger. I knew what he'd do. He'd settle on the grass, puff his pipe and that would be it. No, it was all up to me. Well. At first I had no particular plan, just anything to attract attention. You know, stir things up a bit. Pongo, you silly old thing! C'mon! C'mon, let's have it, boy. Pongo!  Pongo!  For awhile, it seemed to work. At least they had seen one another. Things were going along firstrate. But for some strange reason they left! C'mon, you old renegade. We're going home.  But I wasn't giving up. I was determined that somehow they just had to meet. Oh! Ohhh! I beg your pardon. Please excuse me. I must say, what on earth! Oh, really. Good heavens. Oh, dear. Ohh! Ahh, ahh! Oh, oh.  Oh, my new spring suit and my new hat! Ah, ah... I'm terribly sorry. Please let me help you. I'm so sorry. I don't know what's come over him. I'm so sorry. He's never acted this way before. Please, just go away. You've done enough. Please? Oh. Oh, I say. Here, take mine. Oh.  Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health; and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?  I will. For the first six months or so... we lived in a small house near the park, a modest little place... but just right for two couples who were just starting out.  Perdita, darling, are you all right?  Oh, of course, dear. After all, dogs were having puppies long before our time.  Oh, that's Nanny, a wonderful cook and housekeeper. She's such a kind, understanding soul. You know, at times she seems almost canine. Roger, dear, tea time. Tea time!  Be down in a minute Ta tum ti ta tum Do you like my new song Ta tum ti ta tum Such clever lyrics.  Melody first, my dear. And then the lyrics, hmm?  Oh, Pongo... it's her. It's that devil woman.  Oh, must be Cruella, your dearly devoted old schoolmate. Cruella de Vil. That's it! Cruella de Vil Cruella de Vil If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will Oh, Roger. To see her is to take a sudden chill Ohh! Cruella... Cruella She's like a spider waiting for the... kill Roger, she'll hear you. Look out for Cruella de Vil Let her in, Nanny. Anita, darling! How are you? Miserable as usual. Perfectly wretched! Where are they? Where are they? For heaven sakes, where are they? Who, Cruella? The puppies! The puppies. No time for games. Where are the little brutes?  Lt'll be at least three weeks. No rushing these things.  Anita, you're such a wit. Here, dog, here. Here, dog.  Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat? My only true love, darling. I live for furs. I worship furs! Is there a woman in this wretched world who doesn't? Oh, I'd like a nice fur, but there are many other thing... Sweet, simple Anita.  I know, I know! This horrid little house is your dream castle. And poor Roger is your bold and fearless Sir Galahad! Oh, Cruella. Then of course you have your little spotted friends. Oh yes, I must say... such perfectly beautiful coats. Won't you have some tea? I've got to run. Let me know when the puppies arrive. You will, won't you, dear? Yes, Cruella. Don't forget, it's a promise. See you in three weeks. Cheerio, darling. Ohh! At first you think Cruella is a devil But after time has worn away the shock You come to realize You've seen her kind of eyes Watching you from underneath a rock You're no help. This vampire bat This inhuman beast She ought to be locked up and never released The world was such a wholesome place until Cruella Cruella de Vil Roger, you are an idiot!  Perdy? That witch. That devil woman. She wants our puppies. That's all she's after. Don't worry, Perdy. They're on to her. Nothing's going to happen to our puppies. What does she want with them? She can't possibly love them. Oh, Pongo. I was so happy at first, but now l...  Oh, l... I wish we weren't having any.  Poor Perdita. Of course, she had no choice. The puppies arrived right on schedule... one wild and stormy night in October.  Ohh! Steady, boy.  The puppies are here! Oh... the puppies are here! HHHow many? Eight. Eight?  By George, Pongo! Eight puppies. Ten. Eleven. Eleven. Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo. Wait a minute now, wait a minute... thirteen! No, no, no. Fourteen. Ohh... fifteen! Fifteen? And the mother's doing fine, love. You ducky thing, you. Fifteen puppies? Why, Pongo, that's marvelous! It's fabulous! Why, you old rascal! Fourteen. Just fourteen. We lost one. Poor little thing. Oh, Pongo, boy. It's just one of those things. And yet? And yet I wonder.  Look, Pongo. Anita! Nanny. Fifteen! We still have fifteen! Oh, Roger, he's all right! Thank heaven. See? He's just as good as new. Can you imagine, Roger, fifteen puppies! Fifteen. Fifteen puppies! How marvelous. How marvelous, how perfectly... ugh! The devil take it. They're mongrels... no spots! No spots at all. What a horrid little white rat. They're not mongrels! They'll get their spots. Just wait and see. That's right. They'll have their spots in a few weeks. Oh, well, in that case I'll take them all. The whole litter. Just name your price, dear. I'm afraid we can't give them up. Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken. Anita, don't be ridiculous. You can't afford to keep them. You can scarcely feed yourselves. I'm sure we'll get along.  Yes, I know. I know! Roger's... Roger's songs!  Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you twice what they're worth. I'm being more than generous. Blast this pen. Blast this wretched, wretched pen! When can the puppies leave their mother? Two weeks? Three weeks? Never. What? We're nnnot selling the puppies. Not a single one. Do you understand? Anita, is he serious? I really don't know Roger. Cruella, he... Surely he must be joking! No, no, no. III mean it. You're not getting one. NNNot one. And that's... final. Why, you horrid man! You... you... All right, keep the little beasts for all I care. Do as you like with them. Drown them! But I warn you, Anita, I'm through with all of you! I'll get even. Just wait. You'll be sorry, you fools! You... you idiots!   Oh, Roger! You were magnificent, darling. He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am! Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero! Perdy? Perdy, darling? We're keeping the puppies, every single one of them. My ol' pet Roger, he told that devil woman off. He told her off, Perdy. She's gone. Darling, she's gone for good. Oh, Pongo. C'mon, Thunderbolt. C'mon, Thunderbolt. Go get him, Thunder. After him, boy. He'll get that dirty ol' horse thief. Old Thunderbolt's the greatest dog in the whole world. He's even better than Dad. No dog's better than Dad. What's he going to do, Dad? Shh, shh. Let's just wait and see. Look at him run, the old coward. That old dirty Dawson! The yellowlivered old skunk! I'd like to tear his gizzard out. Why, Patch, where did you ever hear such talk? Certainly not from your mother. Watch out, Thunder. Don't worry, Penny. He'll get that yellowlivered... Well, he'll get him, all right. Lucky, get down. We can't see. Mother, make him get down. C'mon, Lucky. Down, dear. Missed him. Missed him by a mile. I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.

Yeah, but I still don't like it. Here, here. Patch, you settle down.  Oh, dear. Go to sleep now. Close your little eyes. That's a good little one.   Who do you suppose? Good evening, ma'am. We're here to inspect the wiring and the switches. We're from the gas company. Electric, electric. Electric company. But we didn't call for any inspection. There's a new act just been passed in Parliament. Comes under the heading of ""Defense of the Realm Act."" It's for your own safety, ma'am. I don't care whatever it says. You're not coming in here with the Mister and Missus gone. Come off it, Ducky. We got no time to palaver. We got a job to do. Excuse me! What's the matter with you two? You got cloth ears? You're not coming in! She's a regular little tartar, ain't she, Horace? Don't you dare go up there, you longlegged lummox! Now I mean it. If you don't get out of this house... I'll call the police, I will. Now be off with you, you big weasel! Now you've been gone and done it. You've cut me to the quick, lady. Why, I wouldn't stay here if you asked me. Not even for a cup of tea. Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky suspicion we're not welcome here. Pack up. We're leaving. Sharp's the word and quick's the action. Let me out! Help! I'll call the police. Help! Good night, Ducky. Tata! Those goodfornothing hoodlums! Electric company. Hmph! They're nothing but common sneak thieves. I'll bet they made off with the good silver. Why, I bet they took every last... The puppies! They're gone! Patch? Lucky? Rolly? They took the puppies! Oh... Whatever will I do? Those scoundrels! They stole the puppies. Police? Help! The puppies. Police! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Help! ""Dognapping!"" Can you imagine such a thing? ""15 puppies stolen."" They are darling little things. Anita... and her bashful Beethoven! Pipe and all! Oh, Roger, you are a fool!  Hello? Jasper! Jasper, you idiot! How dare you call here. We don't want no more of this, we want our boodle! We'll settle for half! Not one schilling 'til the job's done. Jasper! Jasper! It's in the blinkin' papers, pictures and all! Hang the papers! Lt'll be forgotten tomorrow. I don't like it. Shut up, you idiot! What? Not you, miss. I mean Horace! Why, you imbecile!   Maybe it's Scotland Yard. Maybe they found something. Hello, Inspector? Is Anita there? Who? Anita! Uh... it's for you. Hello? Anita, darling. What a dreadful thing. I just saw the papers. I couldn't believe it. Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock. Is she calling to confess? Roger, please! She's a sly one. We're doing everything possible. Have you called the police? Yes, Scotland Yard. But I'm afraid... Where are they? You idiot! Anita! Sorry, Cruella. If there's any news, we'll let you know. Thank you, Cruella. Roger, I admit she's eccentric, but she's not a thief. Well, she's still number one suspect in my book! She's been investigated by Scotland Yard. What more do you want? I don't know, darling. I don't know. Oh, Roger. What'll we do? What'll we do? Perdy, I'm afraid it's all up to us. Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope? Well, yes. There's the twilight bark. The twilight bark? That's only a gossip chain. Darling, it's the very fastest way to send news. If our puppies are anywhere in the city, the London dogs will know. We'll send the word tonight when our pets take us for a walk in the park.   There's no one out tonight. I'm afraid it's too cold. We've got to keep trying, Perdy.   Perdy, we're in luck! It's the great dane at Hampstead.  Quiet, boy! Do you want to stir up the whole neighborhood? Perdy, come on! Let's go.  Pongo, you old idiot!  Come on, now. We're going home!     What is it, Danny? Who's on the telegraph? It's Pongo, Regents Park! It's an alldog alert. What's it all about? Tell me, tell me! Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Well, now... Hmm, that is something. What, Danny? What's something? 15 dalmatian puppies, stolen! Have they called the police? Scotland Yard? The humans tried everything. Now it's up to us dogs and the twilight bark. I'll sound the alert!  Woof! Woof!  Ahh!    Prissy, come in here!     Coco! Be quiet now!   Aw, shut up! Quiet!  Will you be quiet!      Towser, what's going on? What is it? What's all the gossip? 'Taint no gossip, Lucy. It be all the way from London. You don't say! 15 puppies stolen. There's no puppies around here, not since Nellie's last litter. Well, then, we'd best send the word along. It be up to me to reach the Colonel! He be the only one in barking range. You'll never reach him at this hour! Well, I can try! I'll bark all night if I have to. Ahem!   Hmmhmmhmm. Hmm... sounds like old Towser. It's an alert. Sergeant! Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!  Oh, yes, Captain! Barking signal. It's an alert. Report to the Colonel at once. Righto, sir. Right away, sir! Colonel? I say, Colonel! Colonel, sir? Colonel? What? Who goes there? Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir. Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs! Look here, Tibs. What's the idea of barging in at this hour? But Colonel... Hold on, Sergeant. You hear that?  Sounds like an alert. Yes, Colonel. We'd better look into it. Come along, on the double. Righto, sir. It's old Towser down at Withermarsh, sir.  By Jove, yes! So it is. Well, I'll see what he wants. Ahem! Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof! It be the Colonel. The old boy himself! He wants the message. You'd better make it loud or he'll never get it.  One long howl, two short. One yip and a woof. Two yips, sir. What's the word? It's from London. It must be important. Yes, I'll get the rest of it. Ahem! Woof, woof, woof!  Sounds like a number. Three fives is 13. That's 15, sir. Of course, 15.  Yes... Dot, Spot... Spotted puddings. Poodles. No, puddles! Puddles, sir? 15 spotted puddles stolen? Oh, balderdash! Better doublecheck it, Colonel.  Oh, yes, I suppose I'd better. Woof, woof, woof!  Two woofs, one yip and a woof. It sounds like ""puppies""! Of course, puppies! I just remembered. Two nights past, I heard puppy barking at Hell Hall. The old de Vil place? Nonsense, Tibs! No one's lived there for years. Hold on! There's smoke coming from the chimney! By Jove, that's strange... strange indeed. I suppose we'd better investigate. I'll send word for ol' Towser to stand by. Roof! Roorooroof! Please... stand... by. What's he mean by that? I don't know. Oh... maybe the ol' boy's found something! Oh, I do hope so. They say the ol' place is haunted or bewitched or some such fiddle faddle. Fiddle faddle and rot, sir. Just the same, Sergeant, use extreme caution. No telling what sort of hocus pocus you might run into.  Blast it all, Tibs. On the double, man. On the double. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Psst! Rover! Spotty! Hmm. What? Are you one of the 15 stolen puppies? We're not stolen. We're bought and paid for. There's 99 of us all together. Ninetynine! How 'bout that bunch of little ones? They have names and colors. They're not from the pet shops. Fifteen of 'em? We never counted them. They're over there by the tv. I'd better count 'em. Watch out for the baduns. Baduns? Those two blokes, Horace and Jasper. They're mean ones, they are.  Hey, look, Horace! Watch me pot His Lordship smack on the conk. Hahahaha. How's that for callin' 'em, eh? Hahahaha!  One... two... three, four, five, six... Hey, Jasper.  Give us a swig, just a short one. Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit for a fancy bloke like yourself. Besides, you'd get crumbs in it, you cabbage head! All right. Guzzle the whole works. I hope it gives you colly wobbles, that's what. Hey, Jasper. Did you... Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven... Hey, get down, you runt! And stay down!  Go on, get out of here... or I'll black your other peeper. Where was I? Nine... Nine... three more. Twelve and... one, two, three. That's fifteen! They're the ones!  Blimey!  What the... Horace, look what we got! A tabby cat!  Hahaha! Hohoho! How'd you like a tabby cat stew? Or a cat casserole? A la mode!    What is it, Pongo? What is it? It's the great dane. He has news for us. He'll meet us at Primrose Hill. How'll we get out? The back bedroom window. It's always open a wee bit. C'mon. Woof! Woof!  Pongos, you've made it. Good. What's the word? What's the news? Have they found our puppies? They've been located somewhere north of here... in Suffolk. Oh, thank heaven. Can you leave tonight? We can leave right away. I'll go along as far as Camden Road and give you instructions. When you reach Withermarsh, contact old Towser. He'll direct you to the Colonel and the Colonel will take you... to your puppies at the de Vil place. De Vil! The de Vil place! Oh, Pongo, it was her! Oh, someone you know? There's no time to explain. I hope we're not too late. Good luck, Pongo. If you lose your way, contact the barking chain. They'll be standing by!  Any news, Colonel? Not a blasted thing. They're lost or captured, or something or other. Who knows what. Colonel, here comes a car. Come now, Tibs. Don't be ridiculous. They wouldn't be driving. Yes, I know, sir. But it's heading for Hell Hall. It... It's stopping at the gate! It is? Blast it all! Better see what's up. On the double, man. On the double! Yes, sir. Take over, Captain. Righto, sir. I'm sorry, Mr. Simpkins. The answer is no, no, no. Six down, four to go. I've got no time to argue. It's got to be done tonight. It must be a yes or no question. Do you understand? Tonight!  But they ain't big enough. You couldn't get half a dozen coats out of the whole caboodle. You couldn't get half a dozen coats out of the whole caboodle. Coats! Dogskin coats? We'll settle for half a dozen! We can't wait. The police are everywhere. I want the job done tonight! How're we gonna do it? Any way you like. Poison them, drown them. Bash them in the head. You got any chloroform? Not a drop. And no ether, ""eether."" ""Eyether""! I don't care how you kill the little beasts, but do it... and do it now! Aw, please, miss. Have pity. Can't we see the rest of the show first? We want to see ""What's My Crime?""  Listen, you idiots! I'll be back in the morning. The job better be done... or I'll... I'll call the police! Do you understand? I think she means it. Ah... We'll get on with it... as soon as the show's over. Will you please sign in, sir? You'd better get out of here if you want to save your skins. But how? Shh. There's a hole in the wall there by the door. C'mon, shake a leg. Psst. Kids, follow me. Hey, Jasper, look! Hahahaha. It's old Meathead. Yeah, what do you know... old Meathead Fauncewater. C'mon, don't crowd. One at a time. One at a time! For our last contestant, meet Mr. Percival Fauncewater. If the panel fails to guess your unusual crime in ten questions, you will receive two weeks vacation at a seaside resort, all expenses paid. That is, after you've paid your debt to society. Who will take the first question? Inspector? Could your crime be classified as larceny? A theft, burglary? Straighten out! Form a queue... along the wall. Snap it up. Mr. Fauncewater is a burglar by trade, but in this case, his crime was not burglary. The answer is no.  One down, nine to go. Miss Birdwell? If your crime wasn't robbery, did you... Oh, dear, what I mean is... Do something of a violent nature, that is... Come, Miss Birdwell, we're running short of time. So sorry. Did you do someone in? Oh! I'm sorry. The answer is no. Two down, eight to go. Mr. Simpkins? Psst. Hey, kid, let's go. Could it be a violation of a city ordinance? No. Hey, get out of the way, you little runt! Three down, seven to go. Inspector? Very confusing, I must say. Surely, this crime could...  I'm terribly sorry. We've run out of time. Ain't that always the way! Would it be possible for Mr. Fauncewater to come back next week? Then we could finish our little game. Good night, audience. See you next week at this same time... on ""What's My Crime?"" Ah, oh well. C'mon, Horace. Let's get on with it. I'll pop 'em on the head, you do the skinnin'. No you don't, Jasper! I'll pop 'em off and you do the skinnin'. Horace, look! They're gone. They flew the coop... right out through this hole. Here, grab a torch. We'll run 'em down before you can say ""Bob's your uncle.""  There they go, Horace, up the stairs.  Here puppies.  Here, puppies! C'mon now. Don't go hiding from ol' Uncle Jasper. I ain't gonna hurt ya. I thought we was gonna pop 'em off. Shut up. Take a squint in there. I'll check these other two rooms.  Here, puppies. Come on out. Come out wherever you are.  Horace! Oh! It's that mangy tabby cat. He's the ringleader. Head 'em off. Head 'em...  You bungling blockhead! Back here! Back here! Shh. Here they come. Doublecrossin' little twerps, pullin' a snitch on us! After we took care of 'em. There's gratitude for you. It ain't fair, Jasper.  Horace, there they go! Sergeant? I say, Sergeant. No time to explain. Busy, sir. Shut that door! We'll close in on 'em. Enough of this ""Ring Around the Rosy."" Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost. It can't be far.  By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.  Grrr...  It's the Colonel. This way.  Colonel? Are you the Colonel? Oh, Pingo! Uh... Uh... Pongo? Our puppies, are they all right? No time to explain. There's trouble. A big hullabaloo. Come along! Follow me! Ah, hahaha! Now we've got 'em, Horace. They've run out of room. What have we got here? A couple of spotted hyenas? C'mon, Horace. Give 'em what for. I'm right behind ya, lad. Uh... oh! You clumsy clod! I'll knock the spots off you. Let go! Let go!  Well, by George!  You mangy mongrel! I'll knock your blinkin' block off. Yeow! Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for. No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat! Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat! Retreat, on the double! Help, Jasper! Get me out of here! Horace, they're fighting dirty! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! Jasper! Horace!  C'mon, Perdy. Let's go. I'll skin every one of them spotted hyenas... if it's the last thing I do.  Dad! Mother! I missed you, Mommy. Here we are, Mommy. Oh, my darlings... my darlings! How'd you find us? Lucky, Patch, Pepper!  Oh, Daddy. And Rolly, you rascal! Did you bring me anything to eat? Everybody here? All 15? Twice that many, Dad. Now there's 99 of us! What? Nine... 99? Where did they all come from? What would she want with so many? She's gonna make coats out of us. She couldn't! That's right, dogskin coats. Oh, dogskin coats! Come now, Tibs! But it's true, sir. Horace and Jasper were gonna pop us off and... skin us! She's a devil, a witch! What'll we do? We have to get back to London somehow. What about the others? What'll they do? Perdy, we'll take them home with us... all of them. Our pets would never turn them out. Colonel, sir, lights on the road. It's a truck headin' this way. It's the baduns, Horace and Jasper. They're following our tracks. We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs. When I give the signal, we'll attack. Sir, I'm afraid that would be disastrous. Ahem! Oh, think so? We'd better run for it. Out the back, across the pasture. Thank you sergeant, Colonel, Captain. Bless you all. How can we ever repay you? Ahem! Nothing at all. All in the line of duty. That's right, sir... routine. Better be off. Here they come. C'mon, kids, hurry. Good luck, Pongos. And never fear. We'll hold them off 'til the bitter end.  Now, what's this? Out of my way, you barkin' haystack. Or I'll knock your blinkin' block off!  They ain't in here. They're hiding in the hay. Give me a match. We'll burn 'em out. Ready, Captain. Aim, fire one. Fire two. Hey, there they go, the little sneaks. C'mon, back to the truck. We'll head 'em off in half a mile. They gotta be around here somewhere. I've been thinkin'. Now, Horace. What if they went down the frozeup creek... so's not to leave their tracks? Horace, you idiot! Dogs ain't that smart.   All clear, Perdy. All clear. We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad? They didn't even see us, Patch! Shh, children. Children, shh. My feet are slippery. I wish we could walk on the snow. No, son, we can't leave tracks.  Well, any sign of them? Not so much as one bloomin' footprint. And we've been up and down every road in the county. We're froze stiff. We're givin' up. Oh, no, you don't! We'll find the little mongrels if it takes 'til next Christmas. Now get going! Watch your driving! Do you wanna get nabbed by the police?  Ninetythree, ninetyfour, ninetyfive, ninetysix, ninetyseven, ninetyeight... Oh, Lucky! C'mon, Lucky boy. We can't give up now. I'm tired and I'm hungry and my tail's froze... and my nose is froze and my ears are froze. And my toes are froze.  Pongo! Pongo! Pongo! We'd just about lost hope. We have shelter for you... at the dairy barn across the road. Oh, thank goodness. Perdy! Perdy! This way, Perdy. The dairy barn across the road. C'mon, kids. It's not far. C'mon, this way. Follow the collie. Just look, Queenie. Have you ever seen so many puppies? Aren't they adorable! Perfectly darling. The poor dears. They're completely worn out and half frozen! They all here, Pongo? Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for. The famous Pongos. We were so worried about you. Been trying to reach you. Afraid you'd been captured. How did you make it all this way? And in such dreadful weather. With all those little ones. I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry. I'm hungry too. Mother, we're hungry. We're all hungry. I'm sorry, children. Do they like warm milk? It's fresh. Where is it? Where is the milk? Come and get it, kids. It's on the house. This way, children. Around this way. Don't crowd. You'll have to take turns. Rolly, wait your turn, dear. Don't worry, kids. There's plenty for all. Ooh! The little darlings. Pongo, a few scraps I saved... for you and the missus. Oh, thank you. It's not much, but it might hold you as far as Dinsford. Huh? Dinsford? There's a Labrador there. His pet is a grocer. Oh, l... I'm sorry. Quite all right. Get some rest and don't worry. I'll be standing watch. I don't know what we'd have done if... We're honored to be of service. We're sorry we can't do more. Anyone who would think of hurting these puppies... Shh! Duchess! They're so dear. I wish they could stay with us for always. Princess, shh. Quiet, everyone. Let them sleep, the poor things. They're so exhausted and they still have such a long way to go.   Hurry, kids. Hurry!   Well now, what have we here? Well... so they thought they could outwit Cruella. Hahahaha!  Jasper! Horace! Here's their tracks heading for the village. Blimey! It's them, all right. Work your way south on the side roads. I'll take the main road.  See you in Dinsford!   Pongo, I've got a ride home for you. A ride home? Perdy, did you hear that? For all of us? You mean we don't have to walk anymore? If we can manage it. We'd better hurry. We've got a ride home! C'mon, children. See the van down the street? It's going to London as soon as the engine's repaired. And there's room for all of you.  Pongo, there's Cruella. Yes... and Jasper and Horace. How will we get to the van? I don't know, Perdy. But somehow we've got to. Mother, Dad, Patch pushed me in the fireplace. Lucky pushed me first. Did not. Did not. Did too. Did too. Did not! Please, children, don't quarrel. Say... Perdy, I've got an idea. Pongo, what on earth... Look, I'm a Labrador! We'll all roll in soot. We'll be Labradors. Say, that is an idea! C'mon, kids! Roll in the soot. You mean, you want us to get dirty? Did you hear that, Freckles? Dad wants us to get dirty. Mother, should we? Do as your father says. This'll be fun. I always wanted to get good and dirty.  That's the stuff. The blacker the better. I'm ready. Me too. How's this, Dad? Wait. That's enough. Not too many at a time. Uhoh. Rolly, hold on. You're only half done. Now, stay right with me. We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady. Pongo... I'm so afraid. Jasper, do you suppose they disguised themselves? Say now, Horace. That's just what they did. Dogs is always paintin' themselves black! You idiot! Well, so far so good. C'mon, Perdy. Better get on your makeup. I'll go ahead with the next bunch.  Jasper! Horace! Well? Be reasonable, miss. We're froze to our bones. We've been out all night and all day, with nothin' to eat. They're somewhere in this village, and we're going to find them. Now get going! Do you think they've seen us?  No, but we're running out of time. Try 'er again, mate. Hurry, Perdy. The van's about to leave. Better hurry. I'll get the rest. That ought to do. She'll get you back to London. Better get aboard, miss. Hey, Jasper.  C'mon, Horace. Hurry, kids! C'mon, kids. Run on ahead. She's watching us, Dad. Keep going. It can't be! It's impossible! Run for it! Jasper! Horace!  Jasper! There they go... in the van. After them! After them!  Pongo! There she is... Cruella. Hey, lady, what in thunder are you tryin' to do? Crazy woman driver!  Pongo, look! Jasper! Ain't nothin' to it. I'll give him a nudge and shove him in the dirt. Perdy, watch out! Jasper! Horace! You idiots! You fools!  You imbeciles! Ah, shut up!   You've seen her kind of eyes Watchin' you from underneath a rock Cruella de Vil Cruella de... Roger, after all, that's your first big hit. It's made more money than we ever dreamed of. Yes, I know. I still can't believe... that Pongo and Perdy would run away. Here's a bit of Christmas cheer for you, If there's anything to be cheerful about. Oh, those dear little things. Sometimes at night I can hear them barking,  But it always turns out I'm dreaming.  Roger, what on earth... They're labradors. No, no. They're covered with soot. Look, here's Lucky! Pongo, boy, is that you? Oh, Pongo, Pongo! Hoho, it's Pongo! And Perdy, my darling. And Patch, and Rolly, and Penny, and Freckles. They're all here, the little dears. It's a miracle!

We'll buy a big place in the country. We'll have a plantation... a dalmatian plantation. Roger, that's truly an inspiration. It'll be a sensation! We'll have a dalmatian plantation. A dalmatian plantation, I say. We'll have a dalmatian plantation Where our population can roam I'm hungry. Our whole aggregation will love our plantation home Woowoowoowoo Oooooo  Dalmatian plantation home "
The Jungle Book,Disney,1960,1967,Animation,"Many strange legends are told Of these jungles of India... but none so strange as the story of a small boy named Mowgli. It all began when the silence Of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound. It was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle. It was a man cub! Had I known how deeply I was to be involved... I would've obeyed my first impulse and walked away. This man cub would have to have nourishment, and soon. It was many days travel to the nearest man village... and without a mother's care, he would soon perish. Then it occurred to me. A family of wolves I knew had been blessed with a litter of cubs. Oh, I knew there'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct, but... I wasn't so sure about Rama, the father. Ten times the rains had come and gone. And I often stopped by to see how Mowgli the man cub was getting along. He was a favorite of all the young wolf cubs of the pack. No man cub was ever happier. And yet, I knew that someday... he would have to go back to his own kind. Then one night, the wolf pack elders met at council rock... because Shere Khan the tiger... had returned to their part of the jungle. This meeting was to change the man cub's entire future. Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him. Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done? Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father. Rama. Uh, come over here, please. Yes, Akela? The council has reached its decision. The man cub can no longer stay with the pack. He must leave at once. Leave? I'm sorry, Rama. There is no other way. But__ But the man cub is__ Well, he's like my own son. Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack. But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger. But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle. Akela. Perhaps I can be of help. You, Bagheera? How? I know of a man village where he'll be safe. Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together, so I'm sure he'll go with me. So be it. Now there's no time to lose. Good luck. Bagheera. I'm getting a little sleepy. Shouldn't we start back home? Mowgli, this time we're not going back. I'm taking you to a man village. But why? Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle. And he has sworn to kill you. Kill me? But why would he wanna do that? He hates man. And Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man__ just another hunter with a gun. Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that. Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan. Well, maybe so. But I'm not afraid. And besides, I__ Now that's enough. We'll spend the night here. Things will look better in the morning. Man cub? Man cub! Now come on, up this tree. Be safer up there. I don't wanna go back to the man village. Go on. Up you go. That limb way up there? That's right. Is that all the better you can climb? I__ Oh__ It's too big around. And besides, I don't have any claws. Now, get some sleep. We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow. I__ I wanna stay in the jungle. Huh? You wouldn't last one day. I'm not afraid. II can look out for myself. Say now, what have we here? It's a man cub. A delicious man cub. Oh, go away and leave me alone. Oh, that's just what I should do, but I'm not. Now, now, please go to sleep, man cub. Yes, man cub. Please go to sleep. Please go to sleep Sleep, little man cub Rest in peace Sleep. Sleep. Ba__ BaBaghgheera. Oh, now__ Now look, there's no use arguing any more. Oh! Now no more talk till morning. He won't be here in the morning. Hmm? Oh, yes, he will. I__ Kaa! Hold it, Kaa! Oh! My sinus. You have just made a serious mistake, my friend. A very stupid...

Shere Khan won't wait until he does. He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless. Just one swipe and__ No. Well__ Well, what are we gonna do? We'll do what's best for the boy. You better believe it. You name it, and I'll do it. Good. Then make Mowgli go to the man village. Are you out of your mind? I promised him... he could stay here in the jungle with me. Well, that's just the point. As long as he remains with you... he's in danger, so it's up to you. Why me? BeBeBecause he won't listen to me. I love that kid. I love him like he was my own cub.

I give the commands around here. Now speak up. Who was it? Oh, it was me, Colonel. What do you mean, sir, taking over my command? Highly irregular, you know. Oh, Colonel, II'm sorry... but, but I need your help. Oh, absolutely impossible. We're on a crosscounty march. But it's an emergency, Colonel. The man cub must be found. Man cub? What man cub? How interesting. The one I was taking to the man village. Good. That's where he belongs. Now, sir, If you don't mind... we'd like to get on with the march. No, no, no, you, you don't understand, Hathi. He is lost. He ran away. How delightful. Well, serves the young whippersnapper right. But, but Shere Khan, the tiger__ He's sure to pick up the man cub's trail. Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy. Shere Khan isn't within miles of here. Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war, and all that sort of thing, you know. This has gone far enough. Far enough. Now just a minute, you pompous old windbag. Winifred! What are you doing out of ranks? Never mind. How would you like to have our boy... lost and alone in the jungle? Our son? WWell__ But, Winifred old girl, that's an entirely different matter. Huh! Different, entirely. That little boy is no different than our own son. Now you help find him, or I'm taking over command. What! A female leading my herd? Utterly preposterous. Pop? The man cub and I are friends. He'll get hurt If we don't find him. Please, Pop? Sir? Please? Now don't you worry, son. Your father had a plan in mind all the time. Sure you did. Troopers! Company, left face! Volunteers for a special mission... will step one pace forward. That's what I like to see. Devotion to duty. Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub. Oh, thank you, Colonel. Now there's no time to lose. Yes, yes. Well, bugler. When the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet... three times. Yes, sir. Not now, soldier. Sorry, sir.

Company... forward march! Element of surprise? Oh, I say. And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub. Kaa! It's you! Yes, man cub. So nice to see you again. Oh, go away. Leave me alone. Let me look at you. You don't want me to look at you? Then you look at me. No, sir. I know what you're tryin' to do, Kaa__ You do? Uh, I mean... you don't trust me. No. Then there's nothing I can do to help. You wanna help me? Certainly. I can see to it that you never have to leave this jungle. How could you do that? Hmm? Oh, I have my own... subtle little ways. But first, you must trust me. I don't trust anyone any more. I don't blame you. I'm not like those socalled... fairweather friends of yours. You can believe in me. Trust in me Just in me Shut your eyes And trust in me Hold still, please. You can sleep Safe and sound Knowing I Am around Slip into silent slumber Sail on a silver mist Slow Iy and sure lyyoursenses Will cease to resist You're snoring. Sorry. Trust in me And just in me Shut your eyes And trust in me Oh, now what? I'll be right down. Yes? Yes? Who is it? It's me, Shere Khan. I'd like a word with you If you don't mind. Shere Khan. What a surprise. Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by. Forgive me if I've interrupted anything. Oh, no, no, nothing at all. I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils. Coils? Someone? Oh, no. I was just curling up for my siesta. But you were singing to someone. Who is it, Kaa? Uh, who? Oh, no. Well, I was just singing, uh, to myself. Indeed. Yes. Yes, you see... I have trouble with my sinuses. What a pity. Oh, you have no idea. It's simply terrible. I can't eat. I can't sleep. So I sing myself to sleep. You know, selfhypnosis. Let me show you how it works. Ah, trust in me No, I can't be bothered with that. I have no time for that sort of nonsense. Some other time perhaps? Perhaps. But at the moment I am searching for a man cub. Man cub? What man cub? The one who's lost. Now where do you suppose he could be? Search me. That's an excellent idea. I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa? Uh, certainly not. Nothing here. And nothing in here. My sinuses. Hmm. Indeed. And now, how about the middle? The middle? Oh, the middle. Absolutely nothing in the middle. Really? Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub... you will inform me first, understand? I get the point. Cross my heart, hope to die. Good show. And now I must continue my search for the helpless little lad. Ooh, who does he think he's fooling? ""The helpless little lad."" Ooh, he gives me the shivers. Picking on that poor little helpless boy. Oh, yes. Poor little helpless boy. You told me a lie, Kaa. You said I could trust you. It's like you said. You can't trust anyone.

Sure I am. Never felt better. You sure had us worried. Ah, I was just takin' five. You know, playin' it cool. Yeah, but he was too easy. Good old Papa Bear. It's going to be a bit dull without the little bloke, isn't it? Yeah. So what we gonna do? I don't know. Hey, now, don't start that again! Hey, Baghee, too bad you missed the action. You should have seen how I made a sucker out of old Stripes with that left up in his face. Boom, boom, I was givin' him. Whang! You wanna know somethin'? We're good sparrin' partners. You'd better believe it. Yes, sir. Nothin' or nobody is ever gonna come between us again. My own home My own home My own home My own home Look. What's that? Oh, it's the man village. No, no. I mean that. Forget about those. They ain't nothin' but trouble. Just a minute. I've never seen one before. So you've seen one. So let's go. I'll be right back. I want a better look. Mowgli, wait a minute. Ah, Baloo. Let him have a better look. Father's hunting in the forest Mother's cooking in the home I must go to fetch the water Till the day that I am grown Till I'm grown Till I'm grown I must go to fetch the water Till the day that I am grown Then I will have a handsome husband And a daughter of my own And I'll send her to fetch the water I'll be cooking in the home Then I'll send her to fetch the water I'll be cooking in my home She did that on purpose. Obviously. Mowgli, come back. Come back! Go on! Go on! He's hooked. Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo. The boy couldn't help himself. It was bound to happen. Mowgli is where he belongs now. Yeah... I guess you're right. But I still think he'd have made one swell bear. Well, come on, Baghee buddy. Let's get back to where we belong... and get with the beat. Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Forget about your worries And your strife I mean the bare necessities Are Mother Nature's recipes That bring the bare necessities of life "
The Sword in the Stone,Disney,1960,1963,Animation,"A legend is sung Of when England was young And knights were brave and bold The good king had died And no one could decide Who was rightful heir to the throne It seemed that the land would be torn by war Or saved by a miracle alone And that miracle appeared In London town The sword In the stone And below the hilt, in letters of gold, were written these words, ""Whoso pulled out this sword of this stone and anvil ""is rightwise king born of England.â Though many tried for the sword with all their strength, none could move the sword, nor stir it. So, the miracle had not worked. And England was still without a king. And in time, the marvelous sword was forgotten. This was a dark age, without law and without order. Men lived in fear of one another, for the strong preyed upon the weak. A dark age, indeed! Age of inconvenience. No plumbing. No electricity. No nothing. Hang it all! Hang it all. Now what? Now what? Leave off, leave off! You... You fiendish chain, you! Everything complicated. One big medieval mess. Now, let me see... He should be here in... I'd say half an hour. Who? Who? I'd like to know who. I told you, Archimedes. I am not sure. All I know is that someone will be coming. Someone very important. Pin feathers. Fate will direct him to me so that I in turn may guide him  to his rightful place in the world. And you say he will arrive in half an hour? Well, we'll just see. And you will, Archimedes, you will. He'll be a boy. A small boy. Eleven, 12 years old, and a scrawny little fellow. Oh, no, no, no. That can't be the one. Surely not. Why, that big lad must be close on to 20. There he is. The scrawny little fellow, about 12. He's a regular little grasshopper. Look at him go. And where, where would you guess he is at this very moment? I am not guessing, Archimedes. I know where he is! Less than a mile from here, just beyond the forest. And right on schedule. If all goes well. Quiet, Wart. I'm trying to be. And nobody asked you to come along in the first place. I'm not even moving. Shut up. Here we go. What a setup. Right smack through the old gizzard. Wha... Wait. Whoa! Why, you clumsy little fool! Kay, please, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. Please. If I ever... If I ever get my hands on you I'll wring your scrawny little neck, so help me, I will.  I'll get the arrow, Kay. I'm sure I can find it. Don't tell me you're going in there. Why, it's swarming with wolves. I'm not afraid. Well, go ahead. It's your skin, not mine. Go on, go on. There it is. There it is! Wha... Wait. Whoa! Well. So, you did drop in for tea, after all. You are a bit late, you know. I am? Yes. Now, my name is Merlin. Come, come. Who are you, my lad? My name's Arthur, but everyone calls me Wart. What a perfect stuffed owl. Stuffed? I beg your pardon!  He's alive, and he talks! And certainly a great deal better than you do. Come, Archimedes. Come, come, now. I want you to meet the Wart. Now, you must forgive him. He's only a boy. Boy? Boy. I see no boy. I'm sorry that ... That's all right. He's much too sensitive. Sensitive? Who? What, what? How did you know that I was... That you'd be dropping in? Well, I happen to be a wizard. A soothsayer, a prognosticator. I have the power to see into the future. Centuries into the future. I've even been there, lad, and I've seen all these things. They're only plans and small models, of course. Now, this for instance is a steam locomotive. There she goes. Pretty good, eh? That won't be invented for hundreds of years. You mean you can see everything before it happens? Yes, everything. Everything, Merlin? No, no, not everything. I... admit I didn't know whom to expect for tea. But as you can see, I figured the exact place. You're very clever, sir. Yes. Well, never mind the ""sir"". Just plain Merlin will do. Now, would you care for sugar? Yes, I would.  Please. All right. Sugar? Sugar! No. Manners, manners. Guests first. You know that! All right. Just say when, lad. When. Have you had any schooling? Yes. I'm training to be a squire. I'm learning the rules of combat and swordsmanship and jousting and horsemanship. Yes, yes. Very good. That... No, no, no! ll... I mean a real education. Mathematics, history, biology, natural science, English, Latin, French. No. When, when! Blast it all. When! Impudent piece of crockery. Boy, now, you can't... You can't grow up without a decent education, you know. I suppose not, sir... Merlin. So, I am going to be your tutor.  But I've got to get back to the castle. They'll want me in the kitchen. Well, then, very well. We'll pack and be on our way.  You... You watch now. You'll like this. Higitus figitus zumbakazing. I want your attention, everything. We're packing to leave. Come on, let's go. No, no, not you. Books are always first, you know. Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack Abra abra dabra nack Shrink in size, very small We've got to save enough room for all Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum Prestidigitonium Alakafez, balakazez Malakamez meripides Hockety, pockety, wockety... Now, stop, stop, stop, stop. Sugar bowl, you're getting rough. That poor old tea set is cracked enough. All right. Let's start again. Let's start... Where was I, boy? Hockety, pockety? Yes. Yes, that's right. Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack Odds and ends and bric a brac I'll be with you in a minute, son. Packing's almost done. You... You bungling blockhead! Hey, easy there. No, go ahead. Dun goodily doodily doodily dun. This is the best part. Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum Prestidigitonium Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum Prestidigitoni... What a way to pack. Well... Now, just a minute, boy. How else would you get all this stuff into one suitcase, I'd like to know. But I think it's wonderful. Yes, it is, rather. Now, don't you get any foolish ideas that magic will solve all your problems. Because it won't! But sir, I don't have any problems. Everybody's got problems. The world is full of problems. Blast it all. There, now you see what I did? That's the trouble with the world today. Everybody butting their heads against a brick wall. All muscle and no mentality. Do you want to be all muscle and no brain? I don't have any muscle. You don't? Well, how do you move about? I suppose I do have a little. There, you see? Well, that's enough. Now, develop your brain. Knowledge, wisdom, there's the real power. Higher learning, that's the thing. First thing tomorrow morning we'll start a full schedule. Eight hours a day. We'll have six hours for school room and two for study period. But I al... But I don't have the time. I have page duties. Page duties? We'll change all that. There's got to be a shakeup. Well, yes, sir. I suppose so. How do you expect to amount to anything without an education? Even in these bungling, backward medieval times you have got to know where you're going, don't you? Yes, sir. Yes, of course. You must plan for the future, boy. You've got to find a direction. And you've got... Now, by the by, what direction is this castle of yours? I think it's north. The other way.  All right. We'd better get a move on. Come on, lad. Pick up the pace. The devil take it. The devil take it. Anyone's got better sense than to go barging off in that infernal forest alone. You had no business letting him go. Look, Dad, I'm not the Wart's keeper. Well, blast it all, I am! After all, I took him in, adopted the lad, you might say. Being his foster father, I'm responsible. Tiger, Talbert, off with you. Look here. What's the big idea of gallivanting off in the woods and worrying everybody? I'm sorry, sir. Well, sorry's not enough. That's four demerits, four hours extra kitchen duty. Report to the cook. But I'd like you to meet... Go on, hop it, boy. Hop, hop, hop it. You've got to keep a schedule to run a place like this. You need strict rules, especially for small boys. And I most certainly agree. Who are you, and... mean, you? My name is Merlin. And this is Archimedes, the highlyeducated owl. Educated owl? Say, that's a good one. Say, say, I know.  You've got him under a spell, Marvin. You're a magician. The name is Merlin. And I happen to be the world's most powerful wizard. Come off it, man. Gadzooks. Al right. I shall demonstrate.  Higitus, figitus, migitus, mo, wind and snow swirl and blow. What the devil are you up to? That is what I call a ""wizard blizzard."" Hey, Kay, would you look at this? An indoor blizzard. And in the month of July. So what? All right, Marvin, turn her off. I'm convinced. Alakazam. I hope you don't go in for any of that black magic. Oh, no, no, no, no. Never touch the stuff. My magic is used mainly for educational purposes. In fact, that is why I am here. I have come to educate the Wart. Oh, no, you don't. I'm running this place. If you think you're gonna fiddle with my schedule, pack up your bag of tricks and be gone. Well, by Jove. Hey, he's gone. Good riddance. I'm gone, but then I'm not gone. So, if I do leave you can never be sure that I am gone.  Can you? Well... Well, I must say, you've got me there, Marvin. Where are you? And you're welcome to stay, if you like. Thank you. You're very kind. Very generous, I must say.  Well, all we can offer is room and board. Hard times, you know, Marvin. We'll put you up in the northwest tower. That's the guest room. It's drafty in the winter, but in this hot weather it's the best room in the house. Oh, yes. Very lovely, indeed. So just make yourself at home, Marvin. Marvin? Marvin, Marvin, Marvin. Best room in the house! Guest room. Unwelcome guest room! If he thinks that he can get rid of me, I've got news for that old walrus. I'm sticking it out! And I say we go back to the woods. No, not on your life. That boy's got to have an education. He has a future. You may be right. A skinny kid like that would make a cracking good chimney sweep. Something tells me that you're all wet, Archimedes. Who goes there? Pellinore. It's Pellinore, dash it all. I've got big news from London. Big news. Come on, man. Drop the bridge. Well... Big news, eh? Well, can't wait for the London Times. First edition won't be out for at least, 12 hundred years. Archimedes, would you mind sailing down there and... Not interested. Come, come, come, come Now. You're as wet as you can get. No. No, no, no. Archimedes, I'll turn you into a human. You wouldn't dare. will. So help me, I will.  All right. All right. All right! All right. Works every time. Just like magic. Pellinore! Pellinore. Greetings, old boy. What's all the noise about London? Big news, really big news. Sit down, man, and let's hear all about it. They're having a big tournament New Year's Day. That's not news, dash it all. They always do. But Ector, Ector, here's where all the excitement comes in. To the winner of this tournament goes the crown. You mean... You mean he'll be king of all England? King of all England. Kay, lad, did you hear that? Pretty fair prize, I'd say. Yes, and you could win it, boy, if you'd knuckle down to your training. We'll have you knighted by Christmas, off to London. What do you say? Sure. Why not? Why not? Wart, lad, how'd you like to go to London? Sir Ector, you mean it? If you stick to your duties you can be Kay's squire. I will, sir, I will,.  I don't want the Wart for my squire. Here's to London, and here's to Kay. And here's to the banner of the castle of the Forest Sauvage! Cheers. Cheers, cheers. Charge! Wait, boy. Lean into it. Steady, boy, steady. Steady with the lance. Do it, white knight! Hit him clean. No. No, no! Heads up! Archimedes? Archimedes, where are we? In a tumbleddown old tower in the most miserable old castle in all Christendom, that's where. Castle? Castle? Don't you even remember the boy? The boy? Can't you remember one blasted thing? Now, just a moment. ll... Tight grip on the lance. Loose in the saddle, knees in tight, weight forward and stay on target. You keep losing your grip. It's not a mere matter of muscle, son. Jousting is a fine skill. It... It's a highly developed science. Science, indeed. One dummy trying to knock off another dummy with a bit of a stick. And the Wart's just as hot for it as the rest of them. He certainly is. That boy's got real spark. Lots of spirit. Throws himself heart and soul into everything he does. That's really worth something if it can be turned in the right direction. Fat chance of that. I plan to cheat, of course. Use magic. Every last trick in the trade if I have to. I'd give anything to go riding about on a great white charger, slaying dragons and griffins and maneating giants. Well, won't you? Oh, no. You see, I'm an orphan and a knight must be of proper birth. I only hope I'm worthy to be Kay's squire. That's a big job too, you know. Oh, indeed. Yes, yes. I would say almost impossible. Yes. Well, now then, when I said I could swim like a fish, I really meant as a fish. You mean you can turn yourself into a fish? After all, I happen to be a wizard. Could you turn me into a fish? Do you have any imagination? Can you imagine yourself as a fish? That's easy. I've done that lots of times. Well, good. Then I think that my magic can do the rest.  Archimedes, what is that fish formula? Who? Who? What? You know, that Latin business. Fish? Latin? Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus. And now, if you don't mind, I say good day to the both of you. If you please. When he stays out all night he's always grumpy the next morning. He must stay out every night. Yes, yes. Oh, yes. I say, that's very good, boy.  Who? What, what? All right, boy. All set. Here we go. Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus quom. Aquadigitarium. Merlin, am I a fish? Am I a fish?  Yes, yes, yes, you are a fish. If you don't stop flipping and flopping around and get in the water you won't last long. Now, stay right here in the tules and I'll be with you in a minute. So, you thought you could take right off like a shot, did you? Well, I am a fish, aren't I? You merely look like a fish. That doesn't mean you can swim like one. You don't have the instinct. So, you'll have to use your brain for a change. You are living between two planes now, somewhere between the ceiling and the floor. Now, there are lots of ups and downs, like a helicopter. Helicopter? Yes. It... It... No, never mind. Every flick of a fin creates movement. So, first we'll start with the caudal fin. No, no, boy. Your tail, tail. Now, that gives you the forward thrust. Now, let's get a rhythm. Right, left, right, left One, two, left and right By day and night That's what makes the world go round In and out Thin and stout That's what makes the world go round For every up there is a down For every square There is a round? Yes. For every high There is a low? And for every to There is a... Fro. Fro? Yes, fro. To and fro, stop and go That's what makes the world go round In and out Thin and stout Merlin? Merlin? I swallowed a bug. What's wrong with that? After all, boy, you are a fish. Instincts, you know. But you said I had no instinct. Yes. I did. That's neither here nor there. The main thing is, you must... Set your sights upon the heights Don't be a mediocrity Mediocrity? That's right. Don't just wait and trust to fate And say that's how it's meant to be It's up to you how far you go If you don't try you'll never know And so, my lad, as I've explained Nothing ventured, nothing gained Let's... Let's swim through that tall grass again. It tickles. I beg your pardon. Me, too. For every to there is a fro For every stop there is a go And that's what makes the world go round Let go, let go, let go. You big bugeyed bully, you. Who, me? Here, here, here, here, here now, boy. No sense going around insulting bullfrogs. A fish has plenty of other problems without that. The water world has its forests and its jungles, too. So, it has its tigers and its wolves. But that... That's what makes the world go round You see, my boy it's nature's way Upon the weak the strong ones prey In human life, it's also true The strong will try to conquer you That is what you must expect Unless you use your intellect Brains and brawn Weak and strong Merlin, help, help! That's what makes the worl... Jehoshaphat! Quick, Merlin, the magic. No, no, you're on your own, lad. Now's your chance to prove my point. What point? He's the brawn and you're the brain. Now, don't panic! You use your head. Outsmart the big brute. Smart move, lad. That's using the old intellect. Bravo, boy. Great strategy. Is the lesson about over? Did you get the point? Yes, yes, brain over brawn. OK, lad, I'll fix the big brute. Higgly piggly... No, no. Hocus pocus... No! What the blazes... Hey didda dihicka... Merlin! Now what? Is it that, that boy? What in blazes... Help, help! Help! Help! Archimedes! Help! What... What in... What in thunder is a monster like that doing in the moat? By George, I... I'll turn him into a minnow. Merlin. There you are, boy. Snick, snack, snorrel. How in the world did you ever get out of that mess? That big fish almost swallowed me, and Archimedes, he, he saved me. Well, by Jove. Now, what do you know about that? ...1 did nothing of the sort! I intended to eat him. Young perch is my favorite dish. You know that. Do you believe that, Wart? Well, I... Wart! Wart! I've got to go. Thank you, Merlin. It was so much fun. And Archimedes, I... Pin feathers, boy. Wart! Where are you, Wart? Coming! I'm coming. Now, Archimedes, why would you half drown yourself for a tidbit of fish? And after such a big breakfast. Pin feathers and gully fluff. We were doing fine until we got in deep water. Then along comes this huge pike with big jaws and sharp jagged teeth. Turn him off, Dad. He was a monster. The biggest fish I ever saw.  And, boy, that's the biggest fish story I ever heard. But it's true, sir. That's three demerits for being late and three more for the fish story. Now, hop it to the kitchen! I told you the Wart was loony. He's either out of his head or there's something fishy going on here. For every high there is a low For every to there is a fro To and fro Stop and go That's what makes the world go round It's you, Merlin, sir. Yes, my lad. Now, have you ever considered being a squirrel? No, I don't suppose. Well, now, there is a tiny creature with enormous problems. How he has survived throughout the ages is one of nature's big mysteries. His life is hazardous. Downright dangerous. Would you like to try it? No, I'd better not. Too dangerous for you, eh? No, it's not that. It's just that I've got six demerits. All this work to do. What a mess. What a medieval muddle. We'll have to modernize it. Start an assembly line system. All right, now. A one and a two and a three and a four. Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum Tittendy, bittendy, buttondy, dum But I'm supposed to do it. No one will know the difference, son Who cares as long as the work gets done? Rubbety, scrubbety, sweepity, flew Come on, son, let's go, let's go. Wart! Wart! Wart, take it easy. Take it easy, boy. Wart! Oh, no, boy. No, no! Wart! Wha... Wait. Whoa! Now, what did I tell you? Always look before you leap. Well, I made it, didn't 17? Yes, yes, you made it, you made it. But you can't always trust to luck, boy. Now, first you start with the short jumps. Gauge the distance carefully and... There, you see? Even then you can miss. So, don't take gravity too lightly or it'll catch up with you. What's gravity? Gravity's what causes you to fall. Like a stumble or a trip? Yes, like a stumble or a... No, no, no. It's the force that pulls you downward. The phenomenon that any two material particles or bodies, if free to move, will be accelerated toward each other. Merlin, how will we get by? Well, I suppose we better go back to a sidetrack. Go on, go on. You've got lots of room. Well, I guess she can't be sidetracked.  That's a girl squirrel and a redhead, at that. She sure acts funny. She likes you. Why? Yes, well. Well, that's nature again. But I'm afraid there's no time to explain. Here now, you'd better leave me out of it. Yeah. Me, too. Merlin. Merlin! You're on your own, lad. I'm afraid magic can't solve this problem. Look, I'm not a boy... I mean... I'm not a squirrel, I'm a boy. A human boy, not a real sq... Leave me alone. Merlin, what will I do? She won't leave me... Well, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad. When a girl squirrel chooses a mate, it's for life. But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.  She doesn't know that. She only knows one simple fact, that you're a him and she's a her. It's a natural phenomenon. Phenomenon? Well, it's the... It's a state of being, a frame of mind It's a most befuddling thing And to every being Of every kind It is discomboomerating You're wasting time resisting You'll find the more you do The more she'll keep insisting Her ""him"" has got to be you Now, leave me alone. I mean it! It's a rough game, anyone knows Go away! There are no rules Anything goes There's no logical explanation for this discomboomeration It's a most bemuddling most befuddling thing Who? Who? What the... Now, go on, shoo. Get a tree of your own. Skedaddle. You squirrelly squirrels! She's gaining on you, Wart. There's no sensible explanation for this discomboomeration It's a most hodgepodgeical most illogical Most confuseling, most bamboozling Most bemuddling Most befuddling Thing Really, now, Miss... Madam, I... You, you've made a mistake. Now, now, now, please. Madam. Madam! Look here. I am not a boy. I mean, I am not a squirrel. I'm a boy. No, that's not what I meant.  No! No, I'm a stupid old... No! I'm an old man. An old hu... man. Understand? Hang it all. Now, go away. Impossible. Impossible. Confound it. Confound it all! Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel. It's nothing but trouble. You've got trouble? Look at my... Look back there! One side, lad. Help, Merlin, help! By George! I've had enough of this nonsense. Alakazam. There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible, grouchy old man. Merlin. So, here we are. Quick, Merlin, the magic. Snick, snack, snorrel. There. Now you see? I'm not a squirrel. I'm a boy. I tried to tell you. I'm a boy. A human boy. If you could only understand. You know, lad, that love business is a powerful thing. Greater than gravity? Well, yes, boy, in its way. I'd... Yes, I'd say it's the greatest force on earth. Ector! Ector! Sir Ector, the kitchen! Hold it, son. Madness all over the place. Kay! Hold that, I say.  Now, what's all the commotion? The kitchen, it's under an evil spell. It's bewitched. No! I bet it's that old goat, Marvin.  Come on, son. I knew he'd give us trouble.  Gadzooks! Black magic of the worst kind! Come on, Kay, to the attack! Heaven preserve us! Kay! Now, what have we here? Jumpin' hop toads. Alakazam! So there you are, you old goat. What's the idea of flinging your evil spells all over the place? Lend me a hand, boy. Well, what have you got to say for yourself? You call washing dishes and sweeping floors a work of evil? I'll decide what's right and wrong around here. Besides, that's the Wart's job, one of his duties. Look here, boy. If you want to make that trip to London, you'd better toe the mark. You old goat! If I ever catch you in my kitchen again, I'll... Madam, you won't. Oh, dear. He's gone. Well, by Jove. We ought to run the old geezer right out of the castle. Oh, no. No, no, Kay, no. He might cast an evil spell on the lot of us. Turn us all into stone. No, there's no telling what the old devil might do. He's not an old devil! He... He's good and his magic is good, too. If... If you just leave him alone. Now, look here, Wart. That's three more demerits. Box his ears, Dad. Just because you can't understand something, it doesn't mean it's wrong. Ten more demerits! You make all the rules and nobody else can say anything. You've said aplenty, boy. All that popping off just cooked your goose. Kay! From now on, young Hobbs is your squire. Did you hear that, Wart? Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire. Yes, sir. That will teach you to pop off, you little pipsqueak. I'm sorry, lad. I'm sorry. I spoiled everything. I know that trip to London means a great deal to you. It's not your fault. I shouldn't have popped off. Now I'm really done for. No, no, you're in a great spot, boy. You can't go down now. It can only be up from here. I'd like to know how. Use your head. An education, lad. What good will that do? Get it first, then, who knows? Are you willing to try? Well, what have I got to lose? That's the spirit. We'll start tomorrow. We'll show 'em, won't we, boy? We sure will. Now, first of all, lad, we've got to get all of these medieval ideas out of your head. Clear the way for new ideas. Knowledge of man's fabulous discoveries in the centuries ahead. Now, that will be a great advantage. Advantage, indeed! If the boy says the world is round they'll take him for a lunatic. The world is round? Yes, yes, that's right. And it also goes around. You mean, it'll be round someday? No, no, no. It's round now. Man will discover this in centuries to come. And he will also find that the world is merely a tiny speck in the universe. Universe? You're only confusing the boy. He'll be so mixed up he'll... He'll be wearing his shoes on his head. Man has always learned from the past. After all, you can't learn history in reverse. It's confusing enough, for heaven's sakes. All right. All right. Have it your way, Archimedes. You're in charge. You're the headmaster now. So, from now on he's your pupil. So, from now on, boy, you do as I say.  Yes, sir. All right. Now, to start off, I want you to read these books. All of them? That, my boy, is 2 mountain of knowledge.  But I can't read. What, what? What! I don't suppose you know how to write? No, sir. Well, what do you know? Well, ll... Never mind, never mind. We'll start at the bottom. The ABC's. First the A and now the B. Loop and around and there's the C. Merlin, look. I can write! Oh, yes, yes. That's very good, boy. Hen scratch, that's all. Hen scratch. Now, come on. D, E, F. And now the G. You see, it's as simple as... No, no, no, no, boy! Use your head, use your head, will you? How do you expect to learn anything? Archimedes. Have you seen that flying machine model? I have nothing to do with your futuristic fiddlefaddle, you know that. What's that thing up there? Yes, of course. Here we are. Do you mean man will fly in one of those someday? If man were meant to fly, he'd have been born with wings. I am about to prove otherwise, Archimedes, if you care to watch. Here she goes! No, no, no! Man will fly, all right. Just like a rock. It would have worked if... If it weren't for this infernal beard. I never... Never in my whole... Man will fly someday, I tell you. I have been there. I have seen it. I do hope so. I've always dreamed about flying. That I was a bird and that I could go sailing all over the sky, high above everything. Avis alitus avita atheta. Prestidigitonium. It's my favorite dream. But then, I suppose everybody dreams about flying. I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird! Hold it, boy. Not so fast, not so fast. First, I'd better explain the mechanics of a bird's wing. Now, these large feathers are called the primaries, and... And since when do you know all about birds' wings? I have made an extensive study of birds in flight and I... And if you don't mind, I happen to be a bird. All right, Mr. KnowitAll! He's your pupil. Now, boy, flying is not merely some crude mechanical process. It is a delicate art, purely aesthetic, poetry of motion. And the best way to learn it is to do it. Now, since we're pretty far up, we'll start with a glide. Spread your wings way out. Way out! That's it, that's it. Now, fan your tail. Tippety toe, tippety toe and off we go. Now, tuck your feet under like me. That's it. That's the idea. Whoa. What? And don't fight the air currents. Use them. Why, say, boy! That's pretty good. Well, boy, you're a natural. Are you sure this is the first time that you... Wart, Wart, hawk, hawk! Look out, boy, heads up! Come on, Wart! Archimedes, help! Wart! Wart! What? Sounds like someone's sick. How lovely. I do hope it's serious. Something dreadful. Bat gizzards. It's nothing but a scrawny little sparrow with a beak full of soot. I'm not really a sparrow. I'm a boy. A boy? Merlin changed me with his magic. He's the world's most powerful wizard. Merlin! Merlin. The world's most powerful bungler. Why, boy, I've got more magic in one little finger. Now, don't tell me you've never heard of the marvelous Madam Mim? Well, no, I don't guess so. Madam Mim! Good heavens. Why, boy, I'm the greatest. I'm truly marvelous. With only a touch I have the power  Zim zabberim bim To wither a flower ! find delight in the gruesome and grim That's terrible. Thank you, my boy. But that's nothing, nothing for me. ""Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous mad Madam Mim You know what? I can even change size. I can be huge  Fill the whole house I can be teeny small as a mouse  Black sorcery is my dish of tea It comes easy to me ""Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous mad Madam Mim Marvelous, boy. Marvelous, I'm marvelous. Say, lad, did you know that I can make myself uglier yet? That would be some trick. I mean... Want to bet? You see? I win, I win!  Aren't I hideous, boy?  Perfectly revolting? Well... Yes, ma'am. But you ain't seen nothin' yet. Watch this. I can be beautiful Lovely and fair  Silvery voice Long purple hair La la lala La la la lala La lala la la Lala lala la la But it's only skindeep Zim zabberim zim I'm an ugly old creep The magnificent, marvelous mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim Now what do you think, boy? Who's the greatest? Well, Merlin's magic is always, well, useful for something good. And he must see something good in you. I suppose so. Yes, and in my book that's bad. So, my boy, I'm afraid I'll have to destroy you. De... Destroy me? Yeah, I'll give you a sporting chance. I'm mad about games, you know. Well, come on. Get going, boy. You gotta keep on your toes in this game. I win, I win! The game's over. Why, you little devil, you! I'll wring your scrawny little neck. Mim. Mim! What... What are you up to? Oh, Merlin. Well, you're just in time. We were playing a little game. She was going to destroy me. And just what are you gonna do about it? Want to fight? Want to have a wizards' duel? As you wish, Madam. Well, come on. Step outside. After you, Madam. What... What's up, boy? What's going on? They're having a wizards' duel. What's that? It's a battle of wits. The players change themselves to different things and attempt to destroy one another. De... Destroy? Just watch, boy. You'll get the idea. First, if you don't mind, I'll make the rules. Rules, indeed. She only wants rules so she can break them. I'll take care of you later, featherbrain. Rule one, no mineral or vegetable. Only animal. Rule two, no makebelieve things like, pink dragons and stuff. Rule three, no disappearing. No. Rule four, no cheating. All right, all right. Now, pace off 10. One, two, three, four... Merlin, she disappeared. Mim, now, you made the rules. Change to something else, Merlin. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Give me time to think. Higgity figgity... No, no. Quick, Merlin, hurry! Hoppity hip. Madam, just a minute. This is not... Come on, something bigger. Something smaller. Mim... Mim... Merlin? No disappearing. Mim? Mim? Are you... What's going on here? You... You big blimp. Squash me, will ya? Merlin. Bravo. Just you wait, just you wait. You're gonna pay. So, you want to play rough, do you? All right, Merlin. I'll smash you good, you old crab. Jehoshaphat. Here I come, Mim, ready or not.  Merlin, you wouldn't dare. Merlin! Now, Mim, Mim, no dragons, remember? Did I say no purple dragons? Did I? I win, I win! That horrible old witch. I'll peck her eyes out. No, no. He's gone. Disappeared. Madam, I have not disappeared.  I am very tiny. I am a germ, a rare disease. I'm called Malagalee Telopterosis. And you caught me, Mim. What? First, you break out into spots. Followed by hot and cold flashes. Then violent sneezing. Watch it, boy. You, you, you... You sneaky old scoundrel! It's not too serious, Madam. You should recover in a few weeks and be as good... l mean, as bad, as ever. But I would suggest plenty of rest  and lots and lots of sunshine. I hate sunshine. I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine! I hate it, I hate it! I hate, hate, hate... You were really great, Merlin. But you could have been killed. It was worth it, lad, if you learned something from it. Knowledge and wisdom is the real power. Right you are, Wart. So, stick to your schooling, boy. Don't worry. I will, sir. I will.  I really will. We will sing all night and all day We will fight for the blue oak tree On a field of white For the blue oak tree On a field of white Here's to victory in London for my son, Kay. Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget. Of course, son, of course. Here's to Sir Kay. And who knows? The future king of all England. Watch it, will ya? Kay the king? What a dreadful thought. Sir Ector, Sir Ector, Hobbs has come down with the mumps. He's all puffed up like a toad. Then Kay will need another squire, hang it all. Wart, you're it. I'm what, sir? Kay's squire. You're going to London. Sir Ector! Wha... Wait. Whoa! Merlin, Archimedes, Merlin! Merlin, look! I'm a squire. Very nice, boy. Yes, indeed. A fine monkey suit for polishing boots. It's what all squires wear. And I thought you were going to amount to something. I thought you had a few brains! Great future. A stooge for that love you, Kay. Congratulations, boy! What do you want me to be? I'm nobody. You... You don't know a thing about what's going on today. I'm lucky to be Kay's squire. Of all the idiotic... I... Blow me to Bermuda! Where did he go? To Bermuda, I suppose. Where's that? An island way off somewhere that hasn't been discovered yet. Will he ever come back? Who knows? Who knows anything? For the crown of all England, let the tournament begin! Kay! Now, it's up to the swords. Swords? Swords? Oh, no! Kay. What? What? ...I forgot your sword. Forgot my sword! ...I left it back at the inn. Why, you bungling little fool! You'd better get it, or don't you dare come back! Let me in, let me in! Somebody, please! Please let me in! It's no use, boy, they've all gone to the tournament. What will I do? Kay's got to have a sword. Look, boy. Look. There in the churchyard. A sword. Archimedes. A sword! You're gonna have a time pulling it out. Watch it, boy. Better leave it alone. But Kay's got to have a sword. Now, come on, quick. Let's get out of here. You're up next, son. Better get ready. Kay, Kay, here's a sword. This is not my sword. Hold on, Kay. Wait a minute. ""Whoso pulleth out this sword..."" It's the sword in the stone. The sword in the stone? It can't be. But look, it is. It's the marvelous sword. Hold everything. Someone's pulled the sword from the stone! Where did you get it, Wart? I pulled it out of an anvil that was on a stone in, in a churchyard. The lad's a young Samson. You're making a fool of us, boy. Now, tell the truth. But I did, sir.  Then come on. Prove it. To the stone with you. Yes, prove it. Come on! Prove it! All right, boy, let's have the miracle. Now, wait a minute. Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled. Go to it, Kay. Give it all you've got. Put your back into it. Get out. Push him aside. Hold on. That's not fair. I say we let the boy try it. That's what I say. Give the boy a chance.  Go ahead, son. It's a miracle, ordained by heaven. This boy is our King. Well, by Jove. What's the lad's name? Wart. I mean, Arthur. Hail, King Arthur! Hail, King Arthur! Long live the King! I can't believe it. Forgive me, son. Forgive me. Please don't, sir. Kay, bow down to your king. So, at last, the miracle had come to pass in that faroff time upon New Year's Day. And the glorious reign of King Arthur was begun. I can't be a king, Archimedes. I don't know anything about ruling a country. I told you to leave the thing in the stone, boy. I'll run away, that's what I'll do. They'll have to get somebody else. Better take the side door. Out the side door. Hail, King Arthur! Long live the king! There's another door over there. Over there, come on. Come on. Long live King Arthur! Long live... Looks like we're surrounded, boy. Archimedes, I wish Merlin was here.  Merlin! Merlin! Merlin, you're back from Ber... Ber... Bermuda? Yes. Back from Bermuda and the 20th century. And believe me, you can have it. One big modern mess. Alakazam. I'm in an awful pickle. I'm king. He pulled the sword from the stone. Of course, of course. King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. ""Round Table""? Would you rather have a square one? Oh, no. Round will be fine. Boy, boy, boy. You'll become a great legend. They'll be writing books about you for centuries to come. Why, they might even make a motion picture about you. Motion picture? Well, that's something like television. Without commercials. Hail, King Arthur Long live the king"
Robin Hood,Disney,1970,1973,Animation,"You know, there's been a heap of legends and tall tales about Robin Hood. All different too. Well, we folks of the animal kingdom have our own version. It's the story of what really happened in Sherwood Forest. Oh, incidentally, I'm AllanADale, a minstrel. That's an earlyday folk singer. And my job is to tell it like it is or was or whatever. Robin Hood and LittleJohn walkin'through the forest Laughin'back and forth at what the other one has to say Reminiscin'this and that and havin'such a good time Oo delally, oodelally Golly, what a day Never ever thinkin'there was danger in the water they were drinkin' They just guzzled it down Never dreamin' that a schemin'sheriff and his posse Was awatchin'them and gatherin'around Robin Hood and LittleJohn runnin'through the forest Jumpin'fences, dodgin'trees and tryin'to get away Contemplatin'nothin'but escape and finally makin'it Oo delally, oodelally Golly, what a day Oo delally, oodelally Golly, what a day You know somethin', Robin? You're takin' too many chances. Chances? You must be joking. That was just a bit of a lark, Little John. Yeah? Take a look at your hat. That's not a candle on a cake. Hello. This one almost had my name on it, didn't it? They're getting better, you know. You've got to admit it. They are getting better. Uh, yeah. The next time that sheriff'll probably have a rope around our necks. Pretty hard to laugh hangin' there, Rob. Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse couldn't lift you off the ground. On guard! Hey, watch it, Rob. That's the only hat I've got. Oh, come along. You worry too much, old boy. You know somethin', Robin, I was just wonderin'? Are we good guys or bad guys? You know, I mean, uh... Our robbin' the rich to feed the poor. Rob? That's a naughty word. We never rob. We just sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it. ""Borrow""? Huh. Boy, are we in debt. That sounds like another collection day for the poor, eh, Johnny boy? Yeah. Sweet charity. Taxes! Taxes! Beautiful, lovely taxes! SSire, you have an absolute skill... for encouraging contributions from the poor. To coin a phrase, my dear counsellor: ""Rob the poor to feed the rich."" Am I right? Tell me. What is the next stop, uh, Sir Hiss? Uh, let me see, uh... Ooh! Yes, the next stop is Nottingham, sire. Oh! The richest plum of them all. Notting... ham. A perfect fit, sire. Most becoming. You look regal, dignified... sincere, masterful, noble, chival... DDDDDon't overdo it, Hiss. There. That, I believe, does it. This crown gives me a feeling of power! Power! Forgive me a cruel chuckle. Mm. Power. Hmm. And how well King Richard's crown sits on your noble brow. Doesn't it? Uh, King Richard? I've told you never to mention my brother's name. AA mere slip of the forked tongue, Your Majesty. We're in this plot together, if you don't mind my saying so. And remember, it was your idea I hypnotized him, and... Ahah, I know. And sent him off on that crazy crusade. Much to the sorrow of the Queen Mother. Yeah. Mother. Mother always did like Richard best. Your Highness, please don't do that, if you don't mind my saying so. You see, you have a very loud thumb. Hypnotism can rid you of your psychosissis... so... easily. No! None of that! None of that. Well, I was only trying to help. I wonder. Silly serpent. ""Silly serpent""? Now, look here. One more... One more hiss out of you... Hiss... And you are walking to Nottingham. Snakes don't walk. They slither. Hmph. So there. Now, what about that for luck? It's only a circus. A peanut operation. Peanuts? Why, you dunce, that's the royal coach. It's Prince John himself. The prince? Wait a minute. There's a law against robbin' royalty. I'll catch ya later. What? And miss this chance to perform before royalty? Here we go again. Oodelally! Oodelally! Fortunetellers! Fortunes forecast. Lucky charms. Get the dope with your horoscope. Fortunetellers! How droll. Uh... Stop the coach. Sire. Sire. They may be bandits. Oh, poppycock. Female bandits? What next? Rubbish. My dear ladies, uh, you have my permission... to kiss the royal hands, whichever you like first. Mmm! Oh! How gracious and generous. Sire. Sire. Did you see what they... Stop. Stop hissing in my ear. Did ya see? Did ya see? Hiss! Oh, you've hissed your last hiss. Suspicious snake. Masterfully done, Your Excellency. Now close your eyes and concentrate. Close your eyes. Tight. Shut. No peeking, sire. From the mists of time... come forth, spirits. Yoohoo! Okay, little fireflies. Glow, babies. Glow. We're waiting. Ah... Oh! Look, sire. Look! Ah! Incredible. Floating spirits. Naughty, naughty. You mustn't touch, young man. Oh, how dare you strike the royal hand... Shh. Shh. You'll break the spell. Just gaze into the crystal ball. Oodelally. Oodelall... Oh! A face appears. A crown is on his noble brow. Oodelally. A crown! How exciting! His face is handsome... regal, majestic, lovable. A cuddly face. ""Handsome, regal... majestic, lovable."" Yes, yes. ""Cuddly."" Oh, that's me to a ""T."" It really is, yes. Now what? I, uh... I see, um... your illustrious name. I know my name! Get on with it! Your name will go down, down... down in history, of course. Yes! I knew it! I knew it! Do you hear that, Hiss? Oh, you can't... He's in the basket. DoDon't forget it. Hmm. What have we here? Solid gold hubcaps. Oodelally. The jackpot. Robbed! I've been robbed! Hiss! You're never around when I need you. I've been robbed. Of course, you've been robbed! Oodelally! Oodelally! Fortunes forecast. Lucky charms. After them, you fools! No, no, no, no! I knew it. I knew it. I just knew this would happen. I tried to warn you, but, no, no, no, you wouldn't listen. You just had to... Ah! Ah! Ah! Seven years bad... Ooh! Luck. That's what it is. Besides, you broke your mother's mirror. Mommy. I've got a dirty thumb. Well, even though Prince John offered a huge reward... for the capture of Robin Hood... that elusive rogue kept right on robbing the rich to feed the poor. And believe me, it's a good thing he did... because what with taxes and all... the poor folks of Nottingham were starvin' to death. Uhoh. Here comes Old Bad News himself... the Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham. Every town Has the taxes too And the taxes is due Do dodododo Well, looky there. Friar Tuck, the old dogooder. He's out doin' good again. Well, good mornin', Friar Tuck. Shh, Otto, shh. For you, Otto, from Robin Hood. Oh, God bless Robin Hood. It's the sheriff. Hurry. Hide it quick. Here I come, ready or not.

Oh, Robin Hood, you've risked so much to keep our hopes alive. Bless you. Bless you. Gee. Did Robin Hood really give it to you? Yeah. And this is his own hat too. Gee. I'd sure like to shoot your bow and arrow. Let me try it, Skippy. Oh, no, you don't. I'm gonna shoot it first. You're pointin' it too high. I'm not either. Watch this. Uhoh. Now ya done it.

I told Skippy he was shooting too high. I'm so very glad he did. And now I get to meet all of you. Gee. You're very beautiful. Are you gonna marry Robin Hood? Mama said you and Robin Hood are sweethearts. Well, um, you see, that was several years ago, before I left for London. Did he ever kiss ya? Well, uh, no. But he carved our initials on this tree. I remember it so well. You gonna have any kids? My mama gots a lot of kids. Oh, he's probably forgotten all about me. Oh, not Robin Hood. I bet he'll storm the castle gates, fight the guards... rescue ya and drag ya out to Sherwood Forest. Now, just a moment there, young man. You've forgotten Prince John. That old Prince John don't scare me none. I'm scared of Prince John. He's cranky. I, Prince John, challenge you to a duel. Take that. And that. And this. Death to tyrants! Slice him to pieces!

Well, now what are we gonna do? Well, usually, the hero gives his fair lady a kiss. A kiss? Oh, that's sissy stuff. Well, if you won't, then I will. They're kissing. Ah, me. Young love. Oh, it's a grand thing. Oh, Klucky, surely he must know how much I still love him. But, of course, my dear. Believe me, someday soon... your uncle, King Richard, will have an outlaw for an inlaw. Oh, Klucky! But when? When? Oh, patience, my dear. Patience. Remember, absence makes the heart grow fonder. Or forgetful. Oh, I've been away so long. What if he's forgotten all about me? Hey, lover boy. How's that grub comin', man? I'm starved. Rob? Robin. Robaire. Hey! Hmm? What? What do you say? Ah, forget it. Your mind's not on food. You're thinking about somebody with long eyelashes... and you're smellin' that sweet perfume. Hey! Whoa! LIt's boiling over. You're burnin' the chow! Sorry, Johnny. I guess I was thinking about Maid Marian again. I can't help it. I love her, Johnny. Look, why don't ya stop moanin' and mopin' around? JustJust marry the girl. Marry her? You don't just walk up to a girl, hand her a bouquet and say... ""Hey, remember me? We were kids together. Will you marry me?"" No, it just isn't done that way. Ah, come on, Robby. Climb the castle walls. Sweep her off her feet. Carry her off in style. It's no use, Johnny. I've thought it all out, and it just wouldn't work. Besides, what have I got to offer her? Well, for one thing, you can't cook. I'm serious, Johnny. She's a highborn lady of quality. So she's got class. So what? I'm an outlaw. That's what. That's no life for a lovely lady. Always on the run. What kind of a future is that? Oh, for heaven's sake, son. You're no outlaw. Why, someday, you'll be called a great hero. A hero? Did you hear that, Johnny? We've just been pardoned. That's a gas. We ain't even been arrested yet. All right, laugh, you two rogues... but there's gonna be a big todo in Nottingham. Welldone, ain't it? Old Prince John's havin' a championship archery tournament tomorrow. Archery tournament? Old Rob could win that standin' on his head, huh, Rob? Thank you, Little John, but I'm sure we're not invited. No, but there's somebody who'll be very disappointed if you don't come. Yeah. Old Bushel Britches, the Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham. No. Maid Marian. Maid Marian? Yeah. SheShe's gonna give a kiss to the winner. Kiss to the winner! Oodelally. Come on, Johnny. What are we waiting for? Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it. That place will be crawlin' with soldiers. Aha. But remember... faint hearts never won fair lady. Fear not, my friends. This will be my greatest performance. Hiss, this is a redletter day. A coup d'etat, to coin a Norman phrase. Ooh. Oh, yes, indeed, sire. Your plan to capture Robin Hood in public is sheer genius. Hiss, no one sits higher than the king. Must I remind you, Hiss? Do... Do forgive me, sire. I didn't mean to... My trap is baited and set. And then revenge! Ah! Revenge! Shh. Not so loud, sire. Remember, only you and I know. And your ssecret is my ssecret. Stop. Stop hissing in my ear. Secret? What secret? Why, the capture of Robin Hood, sire. That insolent blackguard. Ooh! I'll show him who wears the crown! I share your loathing, sire. That scurrilous scoundrel who fooled you with that silly disguise... who dared to rob you and make you look so utterly ridiculous. Enough! Hiss, you deliberately dodged. ButButBut, sire, please... Stop snivelling and hold still. Thank you, sire. Oh, Klucky, I'm so excited. But how will I recognize him? Oh, he'll let you know somehow. That young rogue of yours is full of surprises, my dear. There she is, Little John. Isn't she beautiful? Cool it, lover boy. Your heart's runnin' away with your head. Ah, stop worrying. This disguise would fool my own mother. Yeah. But your mom ain't here. You gotta fool Old Bushel Britches. Sheriff, Your Honour? Yeah. Meetin' ya facetoface is a real treat. A real treat. Well, now, thank you. Oh... Excuse me. I gotta go win this tournament. Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor. But wait'll he sees this scene I lay on Prince John. Ah! Me lord. My esteemed royal sovereign of the realm. The head man himself. You're beautiful.

""Robin Hood,"" he says. Wowee! I'm tiptop, all right, but I'm not as good as he is. That kid's got class, ain't he, P.J.? Indeed he has, Reggie. Bravo! Bravo! Yes. Oh, um, by the way... I hear you're having a bit of trouble gettin' your hands on that Robin Hood. He's scared of me. That's what he is. You notice he didn't show up here today. Heh!

The final contestants are: The Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham. And the spindlelegged stork from Devonshire. My dear, I suspect you favour the gangly youth, hmm? Uh... Why, yes, sire.

Release the royal fingers. Ah! And now, I name you the winner. Or more appropriately... the loser. Seize him. I sentence you to sudden... instant and even immediate death. Oh, no! Oh! Please. Please, sire. I beg of you to spare his life. Please, have mercy. My dear, emotional lady, why should I? Because I love him, Your Highness. Love him? And does this prisoner return your love? Marian, my darling, I love you more than life itself. Ah. Young love. Your pleas have not fallen upon a heart of stone. But traitors to the crown must die! Traitor to the crown? That crown belongs to King Richard. Long live King Richard! Long live King Richard! Enough! I am king! King! King! Ah! Off with his head! Oh, no. Stop! Executioners, stop! Hold your axe! Okay, big shot. Now tell 'em to untie my buddy, or I'll... Sheriff, release my buddy. I mean, release the prisoner! Untie the prisoner? You heard what he said, Bushel Britches! Sheriff, I make the rules. And since I am the head man... Not so hard, you mean thing. Let him go, for heaven sakes! Let him go! Yeehee! Love conquers all! I owe my life to you, my darling. I couldn't have lived without you, Robin. There's somethin' funny goin' on around here. Now, P.J., tell my pal to kiss Maid Marian... or I've just found a new pincushion. Why, you... Kill him! Don't stand there! Kill him! Don't hurt me. No! No! Don't hurt me! Help! Help! Kill him! Run for it, lassie! This is no place for a lady! Take that, you scoundrel! Help! Robin, help! Marian, my love, will you marry me? Oh, darling, I thought you'd never ask me. Oh, but you could have chose a more romantic setting. And for our honeymoon, London! Yes! Normandy! Yes! Sunny Spain! Why not? Ooh, what a main event this is. Yippee! Yahoo! Yippee! What a beautiful brawl. Hey! Who's driving this flying umbrella? We'll have six children. Six? Oh, a dozen, at least. Take that! Attention, everyone... Stop the girl! Take that, you scurvy knave! Seize the fat one! Long live King Richard! Yahoo! Hiss! You're never around when I need you. Coming. Coming. For I'm a jolly good fellow For I'm a jolly good fellow Oh! Oh, there you are, old boy. P.J., you won't believe this, but the stork is really Robin Hood. Robin Hood. Get out of that, if you can. Love, it seems like only yesterday You werejust a child at play Now you're all grown up inside of me Oh, how fast those moments flee Once we watched a lazy world go by Now the days seem to fly Life is brief But when it's gone Love goes on and on Love will live Love will last Love goes on and on and on Once we watched a lazy world go by Now the days seem to fly Life is brief But when it's gone Love goes on and on Oh, Robin, what a beautiful night. I wish it would never end. Surprise! Long live Robin Hood! Hooray! Hooray! And long live Maid Marian! Bravo! Bravo! Hear, hear! Bravo! Bravo! Hooray! And down with that scurvy Prince John. Yeah. Oh, the world will sing of an English king A thousand years from now And not because he passed some laws or had that lofty brow While bonny good King Richard leads the great crusade he's on We'll all have to slave away for that goodfornothin'John Incredible as he is inept whenever the history books are kept They'll call him the phoney King of England A pox on the phoney King of England He sits alone on a giant throne pretendin'he's the king A little tyke who's rather like a puppet on a string And he throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way And then he calls for Mom while he's suckin' his thumb. You see, he doesn't want to play. Too late to be known as John the First He's sure to known as John the Worst A pox on that phoney King of England Lay that country on me, babe. Come on, Johnny! Go, man, go! While he taxes us to pieces and he robs us of our bread King Richard's crown keeps slippin'down around that pointed head, ah But while there is a merry man in Robin's wily pack We'll find a way to make him pay and steal our money back A minute before he knows we're there Old Rob'll snatch his underwear. The breezy and uneasy King of England The snivellin', grovellin' Measly, weaselly Blabberin', jabberin' Jibberin', jabberin' Plunderin', plottin' Wheelin', dealin' PrinceJohn That phoney King of England, yeah He throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way He calls for Mom and sucks his thumb and doesn't want to play Too late to be known as John the First He's sure to be known as John the Worst How about that? That's P.J. To a ""T."" Let me try. Let me try. Too late to be known as John the First He's sure to be known as John the Worst The fabulous, marvellous, merciful, chchchivalrous... Oh, ya got it all wrong, Hiss. The snivellin', grovellin', weaselly... Enough! ButBut, uh, sire, it's a big hit. The whole village is singin' it. Oh, they are, are they? Well, they'll be singing a different tune. Double the taxes. Triple the taxes. Squeeze every last drop... out of those insolent, musical peasants. Man, oh, man. That Prince John sure made good his threat. And his helpless subjects paid dearly for his humiliation, believe me. Taxes, taxes, taxes. Why, he taxed the heart and soul out of the poor people of Nottingham. And if you couldn't pay your taxes, you went to jail. Yep. I'm in here too. Nottingham was in deep trouble. Every town Has its ups and downs Sometimes ups Outnumber the downs But not in Nottingham I'm inclined to believe If we weren't so down We'd up and leave We'd up and fly If we had wings for flyin' Can't ya see the tears we're cryin' Can't there be some happiness for me Not in Nottingham Friar Tuck. I don't think anyone is coming. You're right, Sexton, but maybe the sound of this church bell... will bring those poor people some comfort. We must do what we can to keep their hopes alive. Oh. How can there be any hope with that tyrant Prince John... taxing the heart and soul out of the poor people? Yes, those poor people. Look. Our poor box is like our church. Empty. Friar Tuck. We've saved this. It's not much, but please take it for the poor. Your last farthing? Ah, little sister. No one can give more than that. Bless you both. Oh, we were just saving it for a rainy day. Well, it's rainin' now. Things can't get worse. Howdy, Friar. Well, it looks like I dropped by just in time. What does that bigbellied bully want here? Father, shh. Hmm. Well, what have we got here? Now, just a minute, Sheriff. ThThThThThat's the poor box! It sure is, and I'll just take it for poor Prince John. Every little bit helps. Ooh. You put that back. And His Majesty also blesses you, little sister. You thievin' scoundrel! Now, take it easy, Friar. I'm just doin' my duty. Collectin' taxes... for that arrogant, greedy, ruthless, nogood Prince John? Listen, Friar. You're mighty preachy... and you gonna preach your neck right into a hangman's noose. Get outta my church! Out! Out! Out! Out! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Oh, dear me. You want taxes? I'll give you taxes! Ow! Give it to him! Give it to him! Give it to him, Friar! You're under arrest for high treason to the crown. Oh, no. Oh, there, there, Mother. Every town Has its ups and downs Sometimes ups Outnumber the downs But not in Nottingham Ssire, if I may... may venture an opinion... you're not your usual cheerful, genial self today. LlI know. I know. You haven't counted your money for days. Hmm? It always makes you so happy. Sire, taxes are pouring in. The jail is full. And... Oh! I have good news, sire. Friar Tuck is in jail. Friar Tuck? It's Robin Hood I want, you idiot! Oh! I'd give all my gold if I could just get my hands... Uh... Did you say ""Friar Tuck""? Did I? Oh. YYYes, I did. Ah, Hiss! I have it. I'll use that fat friar as bait to trap Robin Hood. Another trap? Yes, yes, you stupid serpent. Friar Tuck will be led to the gallows in the village square, don't you see? BBBBut, sire, hang Friar Tuck? A man of the church? Yes, my reluctant reptile. And when our elusive hero tries to rescue... the corpulent cleric... my men will be ready. Well, Trigger, everything's rigged up and all set. Yep. It's one of the prettiest scaffolds you ever built, Sheriff. Oh, Sheriff, don't ya reckon we'd oughta give that there trapdoor a test? ""Criminently."" Now I know why your mama called ya Nutsy. Alms. Alms for the poor. Do me old ears hear the melodious voice of the sheriff? That's right, old man. What be goin' on here? We're gonna hang Friar Tuck. No! Hang Fri... Um, hang Friar Tuck? You betcha. At dawn. And maybe it'll even be a double hangin'. Shh! Shh! Dummy up, you dummy. A double hangin', eh? Who be the other one who gets the rope? Sheriff, he's gettin' too allfired nosy. I didn't mean nothin'. But, um, couldn't there be trouble if Robin Hood showed up? Well, what do ya know, Sheriff? He guessed it. Nutsy, button your beak. Ah, no need to worry. The sheriff be too crafty, too clever and too smart... for the likes of him, says I. Ya hear that, Nutsy? For bein' blind, he sure knows a good man when he sees one. Heh... Says I. SHeriff, I still got a feelin' that that snoopy, old codger knows too much. Oh, shut up, Trigger. He's just a harmless, old, blind beggar. Alms. Alms for the poor. Alms. Alms for the poor. Rob. We can't let 'em hang Friar Tuck. Ajailbreak tonight is the only chance he's got. Ajailbreak? There ain't no way you can get... We've got to, Johnny, or Friar Tuck dies at dawn. One o'clock... and all's well! Nutsy, you better set your brains ahead a couple of hours. Yes, sir. Uh, does that there mean addin' or subtractin'? Oh, let's forget it. Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir. Nutsy, how can I sleep with you yellin' ""All's well!"" all the time here? Sheriff, everything ain't ""all's well."" I got a feelin' in my bones... there's gonna be a jailbreak any minute. ""Criminently,"" Trigger! Point that peashooter the other way. Don't you worry none, Sheriff. The safety's on Old Betsy. What in tarnation you tryin' to do, you birdbrain? Just doin' my duty, Sheriff. Oh, you and that itchy trigger finger of yours. Hey, did you hear that? Sure did, Trigger. There's somethin' funny goin' on around here. Come on. You cover me. Wait a minute. Uh, is the safety on Old Betsy? You bet it is, Sheriff. That's what I'm afraid of. You go first. All right, you in there! Come out with your hands up! Yeah. Reach for the sky! Just you watch this ""preformance,"" partner. Be careful, Rob. Jehoshaphat, Trigger! Put that peashooter down. Oh, shucks, Trigger. It's only Nutsy. And ""criminently,"" get back to your patrol. On the double. Git! I'm agittin'. I'm agittin'. That Trigger. He's gittin' everybody edgy. Nothing's gonna happen. That fat friar is gonna dangle from the gallows come daybreak. Fine. Why don't ya just sit yourself down here kinda cozylike? Well, thank ya, Nutsy. Just close your sleepy little eyeballs. The sandman's acomin'. Why don't you, uh, let me loosen that belt? Rockabye, Sheriff Just you relax I'm relaxing. Ooh. Oh, Nutsy, that's mighty sweet. Sing it one more time, will ya? Rockabye, Sheriff Just you relax I'm relaxing. Wait a minute! Jailbreak! Jailbreak! I heard it! I heard it, Sheriff. The door! The door! Now, for the last time, no more false alarms. Now, you release Friar Tuck and the others... and I'll drop in on the royal treasury. Oh. Little John! It can't be! Shh. Quiet. We're bustin' outta here. Thank God. My prayers have been answered. I'm ready. Where's the bad guys? Take it easy, son. Robin Hood? I'll get even. I'll get... It's Robin Hood lI want. Praise the Lord, and pass the tax rebate! Come on. Follow me. Sheriff, now... now... now don't get your dander up... but I still got a feelin' that... Friar. Get goin'. Hurry. Guards! Guards! My gold! Oh, no, no, no! They're getting away with my gold! Guards! Guards! To the jail! Rhinos, halt! Stop! Desist! Everybody, this way! That's all of them. Get going! This ain't no hayride. Let's move it outta here. Ho! On to Sherwood Forest! Stop! My baby! Mama! Mama! Wait for me! We got him now. Keep going. Don't worry about me. This time we got him for sure. Shoot him! Kill him! Kill him! Come on, Rob. Come on. He's just gotta make it. No. No, no. Hiss! He's finished! Done for! La, la, la He's gonna make it, isn't he, Little John? Hey, what's that? Little John, lookit, lookit. Hey, what the... Oh, man, did you have me worried, Rob. I thought you were long gone. Ah, not Robin Hood. He could've swum twice that far, huh, Mr Robin Hood, sir? Look, sire. Look. He's made it. He got away again. A pox on the phoney King of England! Oodelally! Oodelally! Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair. Well, I tried to tell you, but no, no, no, you wouldn't listen. Your traps just never work. And now look what you've done to your mother's castle. Mommy! Hold still, you cowardly cobra! Sire, no! Please! Oh! No! Procrastinating python. Aggravating asp! You eel in snake's clothing. Help! He's gone stark raving mad! You know, I thought we'd never get rid of those two rascals. But lucky for us folks, King Richard returned... and, well, hehe just straightened everything out. Say, we better get over to the church. Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched. Long live Robin Hood! Long live King Richard! Oh, Friar Tuck. It appears that I now have an outlaw for an inlaw. It's not bad. Gee, Skippy, how come you're goin'? Well, Robin Hood's gonna have kids... so somebody's gotta keep their eye on things. Ho! Oh! I've never been so happy. Hey, here come the bride, Trigger. ""Persent"" arms! Well, folks, that's the way it really happened. Love goes on and on Oo delally, oodelally Golly, what a day Oo delally, oodelally Golly, what a day"

You're making it very difficult for Edgar. Whoa, FrouFrou, whoa. Steady, girl. Thank you, Edgar. Oh, of course, FrouFrou. I almost forgot. Madame... may I take your parcel, Madame? It really is much too heavy for you, Madame. Now, tuttut, Edgar. Don't fuss over me. Berlioz, come back here. Haven't you forgotten something, darling? Thank you, Miss FrouFrou, for letting me ride on your back. You're quite welcome, young man. How was that, Mama? Very good, darling. That was very nice. Come along, Duchess. Kittens. Come along. Oh, and Edgar, I'm expecting my attorney, Georges Hautecourt. You'll remember him, of course. Of course, Madame. How could anyone forget him? Not as spry as I was when I was 80, eh? Oh, good day, sir. Madame is expecting you, sir. Evening. Evening, Edgar. Another ringer, sir. You never miss. Come on, Edgar! The last one up the stairs is a nincompoop! Could we take the elevator this time, sir? Oh, that birdcage? Poppycock. Elevators are for old people. May I give you a hand, sir? You haven't got an extra foot, have you, Edgar? That always makes me laugh, sir. Every time. Let go of my cane! Careful, sir. Please. Frightfully sorry, sir. Don't panic, Edgar. Upward and onward! Am I going too fast for you, Edgar? Please, sir, hold... There now, Duchess. That's better. We must both look our best for Georges. He's our oldest and dearest friend, you know. Come in. Announcing... ...Monsieur... ...Georges... ...Hautecourt. Oh, my goodness, Edgar. I know Georges. Adelaide, my dear. So good to see you, Georges. Still the softest hands in all Paris. You're a shameless flatterer, Georges. Adelaide, that's music. It's from Carmen, isn't it? That's right. It was my favourite role. Yes, yes. It was the night of your grand premiere that we first met. Remember? Oh, indeed, I do. And how we celebrated your success. Champagne, dancing the night away... Oh, Georges. Thank goodness. Just in time. Georges. We're just a pair of sentimental old fools. Now, Georges, do be serious. I've asked you to come here on a very important legal matter. Splendid, splendid. Who do you want me to sue, eh? Come now, Georges. I don't wish you to sue anyone. I simply want to make my will. Will, eh? Will... Will? Now, then, who are the beneficiaries? Well, as you know, I have no living relatives. Naturally, I want my beloved cats to be always wellcared for. Certainly, no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar. Edgar? Adelaide, you mean to say you're leaving your vast fortune to Edgar? Everything you possess? Stocks and bonds? This mansion? Your country chateau? Your treasures, jewels, and? Oh, no, no, Georges. To my cats. To your cats? Cats? Yes, Georges. I simply wish to have the cats inherit first. Then, at the end of their lifespan, my entire estate will revert to Edgar. Cats inherit first? And I come after the cats. I, me, after... It's... it's not fair. I mean... Each cat will live about 12 years. I can't wait... And each cat has nine lives. That's four times 12... Multiply by nine times... No, it's less than that. Anyway, it's much longer than I'd ever live. I'll be gone. No. Oh, no. They'll be gone. I'll think of a way. Oh, why, there are a million reasons why I should. All of 'em dollars. Millions. Those cats have got to go. Wait for me, wait for me! Me first, me first. Why should you be first? Because I'm a lady, that's why. You're not a lady. You're nothin' but a sister. I'll show you if I'm a lady or not. You're tickling. Get her, Berlioz, get her. Fight fair, Marie. Females never fight fair. Now, that hurt. Mama! Mama! Marie, darling, Marie, you must stop that. This is really not ladylike. And Berlioz? Such behaviour is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman. Well, she started it. Ladies do not start fights. But they can finish them. Berlioz. Now, don't be rude. We were just practicing biting and clawing. Aristocrats do not practise biting and clawing and things like that. That's horrible. But someday we might meet a tough alley cat. That will do. It's time we concerned ourself with selfimprovement. You want to grow up to be lovely, charming ladies and gentlemens. Now, Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting. Yes, Mama. Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint before we start our music lesson? Please? Well, yes, my love, but... ...you must be very quiet. Yeah. It's Edgar. Yeah, old picklepuss Edgar. ""Old picklepuss""? Now, now. Berlioz, that is not kind. You know Edgar is so fond of all of us and takes very good care of us. Rockabye, kitties  Byebye you go  And I'm in the dough  Oh, Edgar, you sly old fox. Oh, dear. Slip of the hand and it's off to dreamland. I say, that's not at all bad. Slip of the hand... dreamland. Let's leave Toulouse to his painting. Now, dear, you go to the piano. Run along. Both of you, go ahead. Yes, Mama. Yes, Mama. It's time to practise your scales and your arpeggios. I'm ready, maestro. Mama, he did it again. Tattletale. Now, Berlioz. Now, please darling, settle down and play me your pretty little song. Yes, Mama. Do mi so do  Do so mi do  Every truly cultured  Music student knows  You must learn your scales  and your arpeggios  And the music ringing from your chest  And not your nose  While you sing your scales  and your arpeggios  If you're faithful  to your daily practicing  You will find your progress  is encouraging  Do mi so mi  Do mi so mi  Fa la so it goes  When you do your scales  and your arpeggios  Do mi so do...  Do mi so do  Do so mi do  Do mi so do  Do so mi do  Though at first it seems  as though it doesn't show  Like a tree, ability  will bloom and grow  If you're smart  you'll learn by heart  What every artist knows  You must sing your scales  And your arpeggios  Oh, good evening, my little ones. Your favourite dish, prepared a very special way. It's crème de la crème à la Edgar. Sleep well... I mean, eat well, of course. Good evening, Duchess. Hello, kittens. Hello, Roquefort. Hi, Roquefort. Good evening, Monsieur Roquefort. Something smells awfully good. What is that appetising smell? It's crème de la crème à la Edgar. Won't you join us, Monsieur Roquefort? Well, yes. I mean... I don't mean to interrupt. But... But it so happens that I have a cracker with me. Come on, Roquefort, have some. Oh, thank you. Don't mind if I do. Just a few dunks. Very good. My compliments to the chef. This is yummy. Delicious. Double delicious. This calls for another cracker. I'll be right back. So that's... ...crème de la crème... ...à la... ...Edgar. Lafayette.

How come you always grab the tender part for yourself? 'Cause I outrank you, that's why. Now, stop beating your gums and sound the attack. No, that's mess call. Yeah, made a mess of it, huh? You can be replaced, you know. OK, let's charge. Wait a minute. I'm the leader. I'm the one that says when we go. Here we go. Charge! Nice doggy, nice doggy. Heel, roll over, play dead!

And we were all riding and bouncing along... Frogs? Uhoh, it wasn't a dream. Edgar did this to us. Edgar? Oh, darling, why, that's... Why, that's ridiculous. Yeah, maybe you fell on your head, Toulouse. Mama, I'm afraid. I wanna go home. My darling, don't be frightened. You'll see... Oh, dear. Let's get into the basket, all of us. What's gonna happen to us? Well, darlings, I just don't know. It does look hopeless, doesn't it? I wish we were home with Madame right now. Oh, poor Madame. She will be so worried when she finds us gone. Duchess? Kittens? Oh, my gracious. I had the most horrible dream about them. Thank goodness it was only a dream. Oh, dear, what a terrible night. Now, now, my darlings. Don't be frightened. The storm will soon pass. Oh, no! They're gone. Duchess! Kittens! Duchess! Where are you? They're gone. They're gone! Duchess? Kittens? Gone?

So if you would be just so kind and show me the way... Show you the way? Perish the thought. We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side. With the stars as our guide. Just we two. Oh, that would be wonderful. Three? Four? Five? Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley. These are my children. Oh, how sweet. Do you really have a magic carpet? Are we really gonna ride on it? Now, now, Marie. Mama, do I have sparkling sapphire eyes that dazzle too? Did I say that? Yes, right off your cuff. And you said we're gonna ride on your magic carpet. Well, now... What I meant... You see, I... No poetry to cover the situation, Monsieur O'Malley? What I had in mind was a kind of a sports model, baby. You know, one of those... Perhaps a magic carpet? Built for two? I wouldn't take up much room. I understand perfectly, Monsieur O'Malley. Well, come along, darlings. I'm a tough alley cat too. Hey there. You're coming on. I bet you're a real tiger in your neighbourhood. Yeah. That's 'cause I practise all the time. Now, now, Toulouse. Toulouse, come along, dear. Yes, Mama. See you around, tiger. Now, that's quite a family. Come to think of it, O'Malley, you're not a cat. You're a rat. Right? Right. Hey, hey, hold up there. Yes, Monsieur O'Malley? Now look, kids, if I said magic carpet, magic carpet it's gonna be. And it's gonna stop for passengers... ...right... ...here. Oh boy, we're gonna fly after all. Another flight into the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley? No, no, no, baby. You just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley. Quick, Mom, get in here. But, children... Hurry up, Mama, hurry. One magic carpet, coming up. That's a magic carpet? Sacre bleu!  Sapristi! Stupid cat. Brainless lunatic. All right, step lively. All aboard for Paris. Why, Mr O'Malley, you could have lost your life. Oh, I've got a few to spare. It's nothin'. How can we ever thank you? My pleasure entirely. Aloha. Auf wiedersehen.  Bon soir. Sayonara.  And all those goodbye things, baby. Sayonara, mister... Mama! Marie! Marie! Oh, Marie, are you all right? Yes, Mama. Haven't we met before? And I'm so very glad we did. Thank you, Mr O'Malley, for saving my life. No trouble at all, little princess. And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life. Oh, I'm so sorry, but... ...we just couldn't. You see, my mistress will be so worried about us. Well, humans don't really worry too much about their pets. Oh, no. You just don't understand. She loves us very much. Poor Madame, in that big mansion, all alone. In all our days, in tender ways, her love for us was shown. And so, you see, we can't leave her alone. She'd always say that we're the greatest treasure she could own. Because with us she never felt alone. Oh, Roquefort, I've been so worried about you. Did you have any luck at all? Not a sign of them, FrouFrou. And I've searched all night. I know. And poor Madame didn't sleep a wink, either. Oh, it's a sad day for all of us. Morning, FrouFrou, my pretty steed. Can you keep a secret, hm? Of course you can. I have some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course. Look, FrouFrou. I've made the headlines. ""Mysterious Catnapper Abducts Family of Cats."" Aren't you proud of me? So he's the catnapper. The police say it was a professional, masterful job. The work of a genius. Not bad, eh, FrouFrou, old girl? Oh, they won't find a clue to implicate me. Not one single clue. Why, I'll eat my hat if they... My hat! My umbrella! Oh, oh, gracious. I've got to get those things back tonight. But... oh, you... Why, that... ...sneaky, crooked, nogood butler! Anyone for breakfast? What breakfast? Where is it? Right under that magic carpet. But now we have to cook up a little spell. You know. Ready? All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose. And tickle your chin. Now you close your eyes. And cross your heart. Then presto, breakfast à la carte. We did it. Look, Mama, look! Why, Mr O'Malley, you are amazing. True. True. Sapristi!  Sacre bleu!  Thieves. Robbers. Mangy tramps. Take that and that. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human. Well, some humans are like that, Duchess. I've learned to live with it. I'll show him. Hey, cool it, you little tiger. That guy's dynamite. But he called us tramps. Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home. That's a long way off, so we better get moving. Gee whiz. Look at that bridge. Come on, let's play train. Now, be careful, children. Marie's the caboose. All aboard. Oh, no. Don't panic. Down underneath here. Mama! Marie! Oh, Marie! Keep your head up, Marie. Here I come. Thomas! Thomas, up here. Gee, Marie, why did you have to fall off the bridge? Thomas. Oh, Thomas! Take care. I'm all right, honey, don't worry. I'll see you downstream. What beautiful countryside, Abigail. So much like our own dear England. Indeed, yes. Amelia, if I walk much farther I'll get flat feet. Abigail, we were born with flat feet. I say. Look over there. Oh, how unusual. Fancy that. A cat learning how to swim. He's going about it all the wrong way. Quite. We must correct him. Sir. Sir? You are most fortunate we happened along. Yes. We're here to help you. No, no. Back off, girls. I'm doing fine. First, you must gain selfconfidence by striking out on your own. Go away. I'm trying to get to shore. You will never learn to swim properly with that willow branch in your mouth. Indeed, not. Snip, snip. Here we go. Don't do that. You're doing splendidly. And don't worry about form. It will come later. Oh, he takes to water like a fish, doesn't he? A very enthusiastic pupil. No, no. This is no time for fun and games. Gracious, Amelia. You don't suppose... Oh, yes. Yes, I do. Bottoms up. Deeper! Look, Ma, there he is. You really did quite well for a beginner. Oh, Thomas. Thank goodness you're safe. Keep practicing. And toodlypip. Can I help you, Mr O'Malley, huh? Help? I've had all the help I can take. Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so much for helping Mr O'Malley. Of course, my dear. But first, introductions. Yes, we British like to keep things proper. Now, I am Amelia Gabble and this is my sister... Miss Abigail Gabble. We're twin sisters. You might say we're related. How nice. I never would have guessed. Look, they've got rubber feet. Yeah. We're on holiday. For a walking tour of France. Swimming some of the way. On water, of course. Thomas, this is Amelia and Abigail Gabble. Yeah, honey, get those two webfooted lifeguards out of here. Now, now, Thomas. OK, OK, baby. Hiya, chicks. How awful. We're not chickens. We're geese. No. I thought you were swans. Oh! Oh, flatterer. Your husband is very charming and very handsome. Well... You see, I'm not exactly her husband. Exactly? You either are or you're not. All right. I'm not. It's scandalous. He's nothing but a cad. Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate. A roué. His eyes are too close together. Shifty too. Look at his crooked smile. His chin is very weak too. Obviously, a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting women's hearts. How romantic. Please, please, let me explain. Thomas is a dear friend of ours. He's just helping us to get to... Come on, Duchess. Come on, let's get out of here. Well, girls, see you around. We're on our way to Paris. Oh, how nice. We're going to Paris ourselves. Why don't you join us? I think that's a splendid idea. Oh, no. Now, you stand here, dear. And let's see. You take this position. Duchess, you'll do nicely here. Very good. And, you dear, you take this place. Now, that leaves Mr O'Malley. We can't leave him, can we? Mr O'Malley, I think you should be the rear end. Ready, everyone? Now, think goose. Forward march. Mama? Do we have to waddle like they do? Yes, dear. Think goose. When we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Waldo. Waldo? Yes, he's our uncle. We are to meet Uncle Waldo at Le Petit Cafe. Le Petit Cafe? Oh, that's that famous restaurant. C'est magnifique.  Sacre bleu! Oh, he bit my finger! Get out. Go! No, get out. Scram! Good riddance. Why. Why, it's Uncle Waldo. Uncle Waldo. Abigail! Amelia! My two favourite nooses. Uncle Waldo, I do believe you've been drinking. Oh, dear. What happened to your lovely tail feathers? Girls, it's outrageous. You won't believe what they tried to do to your poor old Uncle Waldo. Look. Look at this. ""Prime country goose à la Provençale stuffed with chestnuts? And basted in white wine."" Basted? He's been marinated in it. Dreadful. Being British, I would have preferred sherry. Sherry! Sherry. Oh, Uncle Waldo. You're just too much. You mean he's had too much. Abigail, Abigail. Yes, dear? We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed. I say, there... ...what's all the whispering about, huh? Now, now, now, girls. Girls, don't shush your old Uncle Waldo. Why, you'll wake up the whole neighbourhood. No! Neighbourhood! Come along, Uncle Waldo. Oh, jeez, I think we'd better be going. Righto, girls. Birds of a feather must... ...together. That's ""stick together"". Oh, stick. You know something? I like Uncle Waldo. Especially when he's marinated. FrouFrou, here comes Edgar. Hurry, Roquefort, hop aboard the motorcycle. And for goodness sakes, do be careful. FrouFrou, tonight Operation Catnapper will be completed. Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck. Bye, FrouFrou. I... Lafayette. Lafayette. Listen. Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't nothin' but a little old cricket bug. It's squeaky shoes approaching. Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes. Hush your mouth. Let's see. They're Oxford shoes. Size nine and a half. Hole in the left sole, it sounds like. What colour are they? They're black... Now, how would I know that? Hey. Now the squeaking has stopped. I still say it was a little old cricket bug. I'm the leader. I'll decide what it was. It was a little old cricket bug. I'll see ya in the morning, Napoleon. That's my hat. I'm the leader. Well, shoot fire. Don't get sore at me. I ain't done nothin'. That feels good, Lafayette. That's all right. A little lower and faster there. I'm scratching as fast as I can. Right there. That's good. It's so warm and cosy. What's going on? Lafayette, what in tarnation you trying to do? I get blamed for everything. Wait a minute. Where's my hat? What? And somebody stole my ""bumbershoot"". Where's my beddybye basket? Whoever it is, is gonna get it and get it good. This time I get the tender part. Hush your mouth. Now, come on. Hey, Napoleon, it's them shoes again. Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em. Napoleon, I'm goosepimply scared. Now, this is no time to turn chicken. I got a feelin' this case is gonna bust wide open. Did you see him? No, no, he sneaked up behind me and tailgated me. Well, he didn't hurt me. He hit me on the head. Listen. Sounds like a onewheel old... A onewheel what? You're not gonna believe this. But it's a onewheeled haystack. Hey, there it goes. Come on. After it! I got him! That's me. Get him, get him. Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon. I guess you can't win 'em all. Criminiddly! But, Thomas, Madame will be so worried. Are you sure we can't get home tonight? Mama, I'm tired. Me too, and my feet hurt. Look, baby, it's late and the kids are bushed. I'll bet we walked a hundred miles. I'll bet it's more than a thousand. Now, now, darlings, cheer up. Mr O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight. How much farther is it, Mr O'Malley? Keep your whiskers up, tiger. It's just beyond that next chimney pot. Well, there it is. My own penthouse pad. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet. Oh, no. Sounds like Scat Cat and his gang have dropped by. Oh, friends of yours? Yeah, they're old buddies. They're real swingers. ""Schwingers""? What is a ""schwinger""? You know, not exactly your type, Duchess. Maybe we'd better find another place, huh? Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see your pad and meet your Scat Cat. Well, OK. Hey, Scat Cat, blow some of that sweet stuff my way. Well, lookie here. Big man O'Malley's back in his alley. Swing on down here, daddy. Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat. Yeah. Buona sera, paesano.  Welcome home, O'Malley. Duchess, this is the greatest cat of them all. Oh, I'm delighted to meet you, Monsieur Scat Cat. Likewise, Duchess. You're too much. You are charming. And your music is so... So different, so exciting. It isn't Beethoven, Mama, but it sure bounces. Say, this kittencat knows where it's at. Knows where what's at? Why, little lady, let me elucidate here. Everybody wants to be a cat  Because a cat's the only cat  Who knows where it's at  Tell me, everybody's pickin'  up on that feline beat  'Cause everything else is obsolete  Strictly highbutton shoes  A square with a horn makes  you wish you weren't born  Every time he plays  But with a square in the act  You can set music back  To the caveman days  I've heard some corny birds  who tried to sing  A cat's the only cat  who knows how to swing  Who wants to dig a longhaired gig  and stuff like that  When everybody wants to be a cat  A square with a horn makes  you wish you weren't born  Every time he plays  Oh, a rinky tinky tinky  With a square in the act  you can set music back  To the caveman days  Oh, a rinky tinky tinky  Yes, everybody wants to be a cat  Because a cat's the only cat  who knows where it's at  When playin'jazz  he always has a welcome mat  'Cause everybody digs a swingin' cat  Oh, boy, fellas, let's rock the joint.

If you want to turn me on  Play your horn  Don't spare the tone  And blow a little soul into the tune  Let's take it to another key  Modulate and wait for me  I'll take a few adlibs  and pretty soon  The other cats will all commence  Congregatin' on the fence  Beneath the alley's only light  Where every note is  Out of sight  Everybody, everybody  Everybody wants to be a cat  Hallelujah  Everybody, everybody  Everybody wants to be a cat  I'm tellin'you, everybody  Everybody  Everybody wants to be a cat  Yeah, everybody  Everybody  Everybody wants to be a cat  Everybody, everybody  Everybody wants to be a cat  Hallelujah  Everybody  Everybody  Everybody wants to be a cat...

Well, they're kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you're ever in a jam, wham, they're right there. And wham, when we needed you, you were right there. That was just a lucky break for me, baby. Oh, and thank you so much for offering us your home. Oh, I mean, your pad. It's very nice. Well, now, wait a minute. This is the lowrent district, remember? No, no, no, I like it. Well, all it needs is a little tidying up and maybe a little feminine touch. Well, if you're applying for the job, well... Goody. Mother's going to work for Mr O'Malley. Boy. Your eyes are like sapphires. Gee. That's pretty corny though, huh? Oh, no. Not at all. Any woman would like it. Oh, I mean... ...even little Marie. Yeah. All those little kittens, Duchess.

But why can't you? Because of Madame. I could never leave her. But... But Madame's... Well, she's just another human. You're just her house pets. Oh, no, no. We mean far more to her than that. Oh, I'm sorry, my dear. We just have to go home tomorrow. Yeah. Well, I guess you know best. But I'm gonna miss you, baby. And those kids... Gee, I'm gonna miss them too. Well, we almost had a father. Yeah. Let's go back to bed. Good night, Duchess. Good night, Thomas. Hey. Meow! What a classy neighbourhood. Dig these fancy wigwams. Wigwams?

I only wish that I... Maybe just a short, sweet goodbye would be easiest. I'll never forget you, Thomas O'Malley. Bye. So long, baby. Don't come in. Look out for Edgar! Duchess, wherever have you been? Look out for the... ...sack. Well... I guess they won't need me anymore. You came back? It just isn't fair. Edgar? Edgar, come quickly. Coming, Madame, coming.

Yes, yes, I'm on my way. I told you it was Edgar. Shut up, Toulouse. Oh, it's no use, Edgar. I'm afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady. But I was so sure that I heard them. I'm so sorry, Madame. Mr O'Malley! Hey, stop! Duchess. Kittens. In trouble. Butler did it. Duchess and kittens in trouble? Look, you go get Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats. Alley cats? But I'm a mouse. Look, I'm gonna need help. You mean, you want me? Move! Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you and you won't have a bit of trouble. No trouble, he said. Well, that's easy for... for what'shisname to say. He's got nine lives. I've only got one. What's a little swinger like you doing on our side of town? Oh, please, I was sent here for help by a cat. This is outrageous. It's crazy. But honest. He told me just to mention his name. So start mentioning name, rodent. Oh, no, wait a minute, fellas. Don't rush me. His name is O'Toole. I don't dig him. Strike one. Oh, oh... O'Brien. Strike two. Oh, boy. You believe me... don't you? Keep talkin', mousey. How about O... ...Grady? Huh? Mousey, you just struck out. Any last words?

Don't worry about me. O'Malley needs help. Duchess and kittens are in trouble. Come on, cats, we gotta split. Hey, wait for me. You don't know the way. Now, my little pesky pets, you're going to travel first class. In your own private compartment. All the way to Timbuktu. And this time... you'll never come back. Oh, no, we've got to hurry. The baggage truck will be here any moment now. Over there. They're in the trunk. Quiet! Everybody out of here, fast. You are going to Timbuktu, if it's the last thing I do. Well, Mac, this must be the trunk, eh? Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu. Heaveho. Now, my pets, a little closer together. Good. Good. Look, Georges. What do you think? Very good, very good. But I think we should get on with the will. Yes, yes, of course, but you know what to do. Very well. Scratch one butler. You know, Georges, if Edgar had only known about the will, I'm sure he never would have left. Duchess, it's wonderful to have you all back. And I think this young man is very handsome. Shall we keep him in the family? Of course we will. We need a man around the house. And Georges, we must be sure to provide for their future little ones. Of course. The more the merrier. Now, don't move. Smile. Say ""cheese"". Did somebody say ""cheese""? Thank you. Now, run along downstairs. There's a surprise for you. Adelaide, what's that music?

Steady, boys! Dddown, boys! Heel, heel! There, there, teddy. I won't let them do that to you again. Don't cry. Now, teddy, teddy. Poor teddy. All she ever thinks about is that simple bear. You behave or I'll let Nero and Brutus have your old teddy bear. You will not. besides, I'm not scared of them... Like you are, Mr. Snoops! Don't you sass me! Boys, take this naughty girl to her room. I can go by myself. Thank you!  Stick around, Evinrude. We'll signal if we need ya. Look out! Here she comes! Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Oh, I sent her up to her room. Why did you let her escape? What is your alibi this time, nitwit? Nitwit? Don't blame me. Those leatherheaded lizards of yours, they're supposed to patrol the island. They let her get away. Ha! My precious pets! We know who caught that ungrateful brat, Don't we, hmm?  lt was your idea to use a little girl for this caper. lf you'd left it to me__  Snoops! You're not thinking.  l know, she's the only one small enough to squeeze down the hole.  Yes, but why can't she find my big diamond?  l don't know, but just look at these beauties she brought up. They'll sell for a lot of cold cash.  Owww! l wish you wouldn 't do that! She's insane, utterly mad. I want that diamond. You didn't leave the girl down in the cave long enough. She won't take orders. You are too soft. The water was rising and the tide was coming in. All she did down there was fuss about her teddy getting wet. Snoops, you don't have a way... with children. You must gain their confidence, make them like you. Yeah? How do you do that? You force them to like you, idiot ! At the next low tide I'm going to put her down there, myself, and keep her there... until she finds it. It is as simple as that. Oh, simple as that, is it? Well, you're the boss, boss. Yes. Now, come along, petsypoos. We gotta get penny out of here tonight. uhoh, Bianca! they smell your perfume. Oh, dear. Aaah! Oh no! Bianca! Aaah ! Let go, you bigbullies.   Brutus! Nero! Stop that infernal racket! I mean, now!  Snoops! Snoops! A mouse! Oh, kill it! Kill it!  Run, Snoops, kill it!  There's another one! Oh, what is wrong with this thing?  Snoops! What's wrong? I don't__  Evinrude, over here! Are you all right, dear? She tried to kill us, that... that terrible woman! Oh, if I was only a tenfoot mouse, I'd show her! It's__ it's no use, Bianca. Maybe Rufus the cat was right. What can two little mice do? But, Bernard, the society's counting on us. We can't quit now. Oh, and that little girl, we've just got to rescue her! Penny, dear? Auntie Medusa wants to talk to you. High tide or not, that little brat is going to find me that diamond... tomorrow... or else!  Come in. Come in. Did you wanna see me, ma'am? Yes, my dear. Don't be so shy. Now, l am going to let bygones be bygones. Do you know what would make Auntie Medusa very happy? Yes. you want me to find that diamond. That's right, dear. But I tried as hard as I could... honest ! Of course you have, But we must try harder, mustn't we? Then please, will you take me back to the orphanage... Like you promised? Penny, don't you like it here? A big, beautiful boat all to yourself! But if I don't get back to the orphanage... I'll never get 'dopted. Adopted? What makes you think anyone would want... A homely little girl like you? Good night, teddy. Sleep tight. Oh, we almost forgot to say our prayers. Please bless... Rufus and teddy... and all the kids at the orphanage: Jennifer, Bobby, Mary, Julie. And please let some one find my bottle. There's a message in it. Because running away isn't working. Amen. Don't worry, teddy. We'll be...  All right.  Penny? Penny? Yes? Penny, dear, now don't cry. We are here to help you. Wait. Hi! Where'd you come from? We found the bottle with your message and we've come to rescue you. Did you hear that, teddy? Our bottle worked! Didn't you bring somebody big with you? Like the police? No, there's just the two of us. But if the three of us worked together, and we have a little faith__ That's what Rufus said! Faith makes things turn out right. I know it's late but we have to escape tonight... right now. But I just got caught by Brutus and Nero. Look what they did to my pants! Yeah, and they're still down there guarding the gangplank. Oh, those vicious monsters! They ought to be locked up in a cage. I know! I know! C'mon, I'll show ya. See there? The elevator.  lt's a perfect cage, Penny. Great idea. Now, what can we use for bait? They'll eat anything. Yeah, I know. I've got it... My perfume! Remember? They'll follow the scent right into the elevator! And I'll slam the door. And will that make Medusa mad! Brutus, Nero! Did you let that little brat escape again? You're too soft ! Wap! Wap! Hahahaha. Penny, that's not bad. That's exactly like Medusa. Track her down, boys! Bring her back! We'll be so far ahead, They'll never catch us. Wait a minute. She might catch us... I've always wanted to drive it. Vroomvroom! Vroomvroom! What if Medusa wakes up while we're starting it ? We're in trouble. We've gotta stall 'em somehow. How about Mr Snoops' fireworks? We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom. That'll keep her busy. Oh, Bernard, It's so exciting. Perfume, crocs, swampmobile! It's just got to work! It's our only chance. But we're gonna need help.  Snoops, get down here! What's up, Medusa? What's going on?  Oh, shut up! High tide or not__ I bet those two are up to something. I don't wanna go down in that awful black hole again. Don't worry about that. You must hurry and get dressed. C'mon. We haven't got much time. Evinrude, up here. We need help. Go get EllieMae! And hurry!  Are you ready to help rescue that little young'un? Sure enough ! Hallelujah! Luke!  On your feet, you lazy critter ! Oooshh! Shucks, EllieMae, Dagnabit! Let's cut out the jawin' and get agoin'! Heehee. when ol' gramps gets headup, his nose gets plumb out of joint. Take it easy, gramps. We gotta stay here 'til Evinrude brings us word from them mice. If'n that bug don't get here soon, they'll put that poor little girl down the black hole again. All right, you little brat. You are gonna go down in that hole... And you're gonna dig till you find me the diamond. and no sassing me!  Uhuhuh, Snoops! That is no way to speak to our little Miss Penny. Oh, okay, boss. Okay. Now, my dear, you're going to find the big, shiny diamond... for your auntie Medusa, aren't you, hmm ?  Teddy doesn 't like it down there. He's afraid, aren't you, teddy? Ahh, tsktsk. Poor teddy. I'll just keep him up here with me where he'll be safe. Give me back my teddy bear! He's mine! He's mine! You get down there and find the big diamond... or you will never see teddy again! All right. All right. I'll go.  Boss, you really got a way with kids. Don't worry, teddy, I won't be gone long. l'll find her ol' diamond!  Oh, what a dreadful, frightening place! Yeah, it used to be a pirate's cave. How do you know that, Penny ? Him! Ah! Oh dear! C'mon, girls. Let's look for that diamond so we can get out of here. I looked there already. Medusa doesn't want those little ones.  Wha__ What's__ What's that?   That's where the water comes in. Ooo! I'm afraid to go over there. Well, if I was a pirate, that's just where I'd hide the devil's eye. I'll, uh, go over and check it out.   Come__ Come to think of it, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't__ I wouldn't hide anything back there. Bernard, look! I can see something. C'mon, let's see what it is. No, Bianca. You stay here. I'll see if i can find a safe way over.  Aaah! Bianca! Hang on! Help! I'm coming.  What are you doing down there? I'm looking! Well, look faster! Wow!  Penny, hold your lantern up again. Holy mackerel! That's it. The devil's eye! Penny, we found it! We found it! Medusa, I found it! Let me look. Let me look, Medusa. Back! Ah, good girl! Good girl! Let's get it up here.   Look, it won't go through. We can't get it out.  What's taking so long? It's stuck tight. Stuck tight! You get that diamond... or you'll never see daylight again!  No, back, Penny!  Penny, you'll fall!   Forget the diamond. Let's get out of here before we drown ! The water's coming in! Please pull me up. Not until you get the diamond! Penny, the pirate's sword. Use the sword!   Penny! Penny, help! I've got it! I've got it! Hurry! Pull me up! Faster! Faster! I'm pulling as fast as I can. Ahhhahaha! At last! The devil's eye! At last! Hehhehhehheh. It's worth millions! Hahahaha! Mmm! Just look at it. Filled with power... for its owner. Let me look at it. I got__ hey, that wasn't a very good look.  But know there's enough there... to cut it into two equal shares. You idiot! Cut up a perfect gem! And it's mine. It's all mine! All yours! Half of it is mine, you doublecrossing crook! Put me down, Brutus. lt's mine. lt's all mine. Doublecrosser! Cheap pickpocket. Chi seller! Cheap crook!  Land sakes, it's Evinrude. Ol' ev sure is a mess. Where in tarnation you been, boy? What's happening? Do they want us now? Where are they? They're on the boat? Speak up, boy. Buck up! We mustn't be quitting now, must we?  Stand back! Give poor Evinrude some air. He's plumb tuckered out. Here, son. This'll make a new bug outta ya. Gulp! Gulp! Yahoo! Yoohoo!  We're gonna have us a ripsnortin' fight. Yip...pee! Charge! Where'd everybody go? I don't need any help from anybody! Charge! Yahoo!   Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!

Yes, uh, you might say that Penny, uh... ... brought us together. You are a darling. Penny, you were a brave little girl, to do what you did all by yourself. I didn't do it all by myself. Two little mice from the rescue aid society helped me. Mice? Rescue aid society? Yes, they rescued me. Could i say hello to them? Hello, Bianca! Hi, Bernard! You can talk to these little mice? All the time. Mice can talk like anybody. didn't you know that?  Well, l didn 't. But l do now, Penny.  Evinrude, what are you doing here?  It's another call for help. Here. Uh, you're gonna need some volunteers. Bu__ but, Bianca__ Oh, Bernard, adventure, Thrills, intrigue, travel, exotic places. Oh, come on, darling, let's go. Sure wish we had taken the train! Yahhohohohee! "
Winnie the Pooh,Disney,1970,1977,Animation,"This could be the room of any small boy... but it just happens to belong to a boy named Christopher Robin. Like most small boys, Christopher Robin has toy animals to play with. They all live together in a wonderful world of makebelieve. But his best friend is a bear called Winnie the Pooh... or ""Pooh"" for short. Now, Pooh had some very unusual adventures... and they all happened right here in the HundredAcre Wood. Deep in the HundredAcre Wood  Where Christopher Robin plays  You'll find  the enchanted neighborhood  Of Christopher's  childhood days  A donkey named Eeyore  is his friend  And Kanga and little Roo  There's Rabbit and Piglet  And there's Owl  But most of all  Winnie the Pooh  Winnie the Pooh  Winnie the Pooh  Tubby little cubby  all stuffed with fluff  He's Winnie the Pooh  Winnie the Pooh  Willynilly, silly old bear  Winnie the Pooh  Pooh! Winnie the Pooh  Pooh! Tubby little cubby  all stuffed with fluff  He's Winnie the Pooh  Winnie the Pooh  Willynilly, silly old bear  Winnie the Pooh lived in this enchanted forest... under the name of""Sanders""... which means he had the name over the door in gold letters... and he lived under it. Now, when Pooh heard his ""poohcoo"" clock... Poohcoo. Poohcoo, poohcoo, poohcoo, poohcoo, poohcoo. He knew it was time for something. But he was a bear of very little brain. So when he thought, he thought in the most thoughtful way he could think. I haven't thought of anything, have you? Nor neither have I. Think, think, think. Oh, yes. Time for my stoutness exercise. Up, down, up. When I up, down  touch the ground  It puts me in the mood  Up, down, touch the ground  In the mood for food  I am stout, round  and I have found  Speaking poundagewise  I improve my appetite  when I exercise  Oh, stuff and fluff. That's better. Thank you. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. I'm rumbly in my tumbly. Time for something sweet. I am short, fat  and proud of that  So with all my might  I up, down, up, down  To my appetite's delight  While I up, down  touch the ground  I think of things to chew  Like honey and milk and chocolate. With a hefty, happy appetite  I'm a hefty, happy pooh  With a hefty, happy appetite  he's a hefty, happy pooh  Oh, bother. Empty again. Only the sticky part is left. That buzzing noise means something. And the only reason for making a buzzing noise that I know of... is because you're a... a bee! And the only reason for being a bee is to make honey. And the only reason for making honey is so I can eat it. And so Winnie the Pooh climbed the honey tree. He climbed and he climbed and he climbed. And as he climbed, he hummed a little hum. Hum, hum  Hum, hum  And I call it my ""rumbly in my tumbly"" song. Yes, and it went something like this. Hum dum de dum  Hum dum de dum  I am so rumbly  in my tumbly  Oh! Time to munch  an early luncheon  Hum de dum dum dum  Oh, I wouldn't climb this tree  If a pooh flew like a bee  But I wouldn't be a bear then  So I guess  I wouldn't care then  Bears love honey  and I'm a Pooh bear  So I do care  So I climb there  I'm so rumbly in my tumbly  Time for something  For something sweet to eat! If only I hadn't... You see, what I meant to do... And it all comes, I suppose, from liking honey so much. Oh, bother. Winnie the Pooh crawled out of the gorse bush... brushed the prickles from his nose and began to think again. Think, think, think. And the first person he thought of was... Winnie the Pooh? No. Christopher Robin. Oh. Christopher Robin lived in another part of the forest... where he could be near his friends and help them with their problems. On this summer day, gloomy old Eeyore... being stuffed with sawdust, had lost his tail again. Eeyore, this won't hurt. Never does. There now. Did I get your tail back on properly, Eeyore? No matter. Most likely lose it again anyway. It is my considered opinion... that Eeyore's tail should be placed a trifle to the, uh, right. And now, if you were to ask me, I think it's just a wee bit... South. No, no. North, dear. Cheer up, Eeyore. Don't be so gloomy. Try swishing it. It worked. It worked. Oh, goody! Hooray! Thanks. It's not much of a tail, but I'm sort of attached to it. Good morning, Christopher Robin. Oh, good morning, Winnie the Pooh. Good morning, Pooh bear. Good morning, Pooh bear. If it is a good morning, which I doubt. What are you looking for, Pooh bear? I just said to myself, coming along thinking and wondering... if you had such a thing as, uh... such a thing, Christopher, uh, as a balloon, about you. What do you want a balloon for? Honey. But you don't get honey with a balloon. I do. How? I shall fly like a bee, up to the honey tree. See? But just a minute. You can't fool the bees that way. You'll see. Now, would you be so kind as to tow me to a muddy place of which I know of. So Christopher Robin towed Winnie the Pooh to the very muddy place. And Pooh rolled and rolled until he was black all over. There, now. Isn't this a clever disguise? What are you supposed to be? I'm a little, black rain cloud, of course. Silly old bear. Now, would you aim me at the bees, please? Careful, Pooh. Hold on tight. Yes. Four... Yes. Three... Yes. Two... Yes. One! I'm just a little, black rain cloud  Hovering under the honey tree  I'm only a little, black rain cloud  Pay no attention to little me  Oh, everyone knows  that a rain cloud  Never eats honey  no, not a nip  I'm just floating around  over the ground  Wondering where I will drip  Christopher Robin, I think the bees... SUSPECT something. Perhaps they think you're after their honey. Well, it may be that. You never can tell with bees. Oh, I'm just  a little, black rain cloud  Hovering under the honey tree  Christopher Robin! I think it would help with this deception... if you would just kind of open your umbrella and say... ""Tut, tut, it looks like rain."" Tut, tut, it looks like rain. Tut, tut, it looks like rain. Christopher Robin, I have come to a very important decision. These are the wrong sorts of bees. Excuse me, please, bees. Christopher Robin! Oh, bother! I think I shall come down. L'll catch you, Pooh. Hurry, come on. The bees! Help, Christopher! Christopher Robin, you never can tell with bees. Now, Pooh was not the sort to give up easily. When he put his mind to honey, he stuck to it. Now, honey rhymes with bunny... and bunny rhymes with, uh... Rabbit? Yeah, I like Rabbit because he uses short, easy words... like, ""How about lunch"" and ""Help yourself, Pooh."" Pooh? Lunch? Oh, no. Not again. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Is anybody at home? What I said was, ""Is anybody at home?"" No. Bother. Isn't there anybody here at all? Nobody. Must be somebody there because somebody must have said, ""Nobody."" Rabbit, isn't that you? No! Well, isn't that the Rabbit's voice? I don't think so. It isn't meant to be. Hello, Rabbit. Oh. Oh, hello, Pooh bear. Pooh bear! Uh, uh... What a pleasant surprise. Uh, how about lunch? Oh, thank you, Rabbit. And help yourself, Pooh. Uh, would you like condensed milk or honey on your bread? Both. But never mind the bread, please. Just a small helping, if you please. Huh, there you are. Is, uh, something wrong? Well, I did mean a little larger ""small helping."" Perhaps it would save time if you took the whole jar. Thank you, Rabbit. So Pooh ate and ate and ate and ate... and ate and ate and ate and ate... and ate. Until at last he said to Rabbit... in a rather sticky voice: I must be going now. Goodbye, Rabbit. Well, goodbye, if you're sure you won't have any more. Is there any more? No, there isn't. I thought not. Oh, oh, help and bother! I'm stuck. Oh, dear. Oh, gracious. Oh. Well, it all comes from eating too much. It all comes from not having front doors big enough! Oh, dear, it's no use. There's only one thing to do. L'll get Christopher Robin. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, my. Heavens to Betsy. Well, if it isn't Pooh bear. Oh, hello, Owl. Splendid day to be up and about one's business, quite, eh? Oh. I say, are you stuck? No, no, just resting... and thinking and humming to myself. You, sir, are stuck... a wedged bear, in a great tightness. In a word, irremovable. Now obviously, this situation calls for an expert. Somebody call for an excavation expert? I'm not in the book, but I'm at your service. Gopher's the name. Here's my card. What's your problem? Yes, yes, yes, yes. It seems the entrance to Rabbit's domicile is impassable. Uh, to be exact, plugged. And you want me to dig it out? Precisely. Uh, I say, it's over here, my good fellow. Oh, the first thing to be done is get rid of that bear. He's gummin' up the whole project. Dash it all, he is the project! Um, hard digging. Might hit bedrock. Danger of cavein. Risky. Need planks for bracing. Big job. Take two, three days. Three days? What about lunches? No problem, I always go home for lunch. Oh, oh! This will run into money. I, uh... I say, how much? Do the job for hourly rate plus cover materials, plus overtime... plus ten percent. And your estimate? Nope, can't give an estimate. Too risky. Blast it all. Good idea! We'll dynamite. Save time. Eh, what's the charge? The charge? Oh, about seven sticks of dynamite. Oh, no, no, no, the cost! The charge in money? Nope, no charge account. I work strictly cash. Obviously, but, I should think... Well, I can't stand around lollygagging all day. I got a tight schedule. If you think it over, let me know. You got my card. I'm not in the book, you know. Oh. Dash it all, he's gone. After all, he's not in the book, you know. Oh. Here we come. Don't worry. Cheer up, Pooh bear. We're coming. We'll get you out. Well, maybe. Silly old bear. Here, give me your paw. Ow. It's no use. I'm stuck. Well, if we can't pull you out, Pooh, perhaps we can push you back. Oh, no! Not that! Oh, my gracious! Oh, dear! Having got this far, it seems a pity to waste it. Pooh bear, there's only one thing we can do: Wait for you to get thin again. Oh, bother. How long will that take? Days. Weeks. Months. Who knows? Oh, dear. If I have to face that... that thing for months... well, I might as well make the best of it. Oh, no! There it is again! Well, l'll just turn it to the wall. Oh, dear! Yes, a frame. Uhhuh. Oh. No, no, no. No. Very nice. And a splash of color. Oh, it just doesn't have that rustic, informal look. There, a hunting trophy. Aha! I know just the thing. Something tickles. Oh, Pooh! You messed up my moose! Pooh, Roo has a little surprise for you. Flowers. Honeysuckle. No, Pooh, you don't eat them. You smell them. Oh. That's not bad. Not bad at all. It's rather good, I think. Ah... Oh, no! Hold it! Oh, no! No, help! Why did I ever invite that bear to lunch? Why, oh, why, oh, why? While Pooh's bottom was stuck at the top of page 28... his top was stuck at the bottom of page 30. So both ends waited to get thin again... day after day... night after lonely night. I wonder what's for breakfast. Breakfast. Lunch. Huh? A lunch box! It certainly is! I'm working the swing shift, you know. Time for my midnight snack. Say, ain't you that stuckup bear? Hmm. I still think I could blast you out of there. Uh, what sort of lunch is in that lunch box? Well, let's see here. Ah, um, oh! Summer squash... salmon salad, succotash, spiced custard... and honey. Honey? Honey? Oh, no! Could you spare a small smackerel? Say, you ought to do something about that speech impediment, sonny. Oh, thank you, Gopher. Oh, no! Not that! No, no, no, no, no! Not one drop! But, Rabbit, I wasn't going to eat it. I was just going to taste it. L'll taste it for you. That supercilious scoundrel confiscated my honey. Don't feed the bear. I'm going to skedaddle. I'm not in the book. And I'm ""ding danged"" glad of it! And then one morning when Rabbit was beginning to think... that he might never be able to use his front door again, it happened. He budged. Hooray! ""Christopher Crobbin."" No, ""Chrostofer Rubin."" He ""bidged!"" He ""badged!"" He ""booged!"" Today is the day! Hooray for you  Hooray for me  Hooray, hooray  The pooh will soon be free  Dum ba dum  ba dum ba dum ba dum  Now the time has  come for proving  What the diet did for Pooh  And since we pledged  he'd be unwedged  That's what we're going to do  He'll be pulled  and he'll be tugged  And eventually unplugged  We'll have a tugofwar  To open Rabbit's door  Think ""heaveage,""think ""hoage""  And out the pooh will ""goage""  For mind over matter  Has made the pooh ""unfatter""  Heaveho  Heaveho  Heave, heave, heave, heave, heave  There he goes! Suffering sassafras. He's sailing clean out of the book! Quick! Turn the page! Stuck again. Don't worry, Pooh. We'll get you out. No hurry. Take your time. Yumyum. Bears love honey  and I'm a pooh bear  Yum, yum, yum, yum  Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp  Yum, yum, yum, yum  Time for something sweet  And so we come to the next chapter in which... But I haven't finished yet. But, Pooh, you're in the next chapter. Oh. What happens to me? Well, let's turn the page and find out. Now, one fine day, the east wind... traded places with the west wind. And that stirred things up a bit all through the HundredAcre Wood. Now, on this blustery day... Pooh decided to visit his thoughtful spot. Yes, and on the way I made up a little hum. And it hums something like this. Hum dum, dum ditty dum  Hum dum, dum  Oh, the wind is lashing lustily  and the trees are thrashing thrustily  And the leaves are rustling gustily  So it's rather safe to say  That it seems that  it may turn out to be  It feels that it will undoubtedly  It looks like a rather  blustery day today  It seems that  it may turn out to be  Feels that it will undoubtedly  Looks like a rather blustery day today  Fortunately, Pooh's thoughtful spot was in a sheltered place. Now he sat down and tried hard to think of something. Think, think, think, think, think. Think, think, think. Say, what's wrong, sonny? Got yourself a headache? No, I was just thinking. Is that so? What about? L... Oh, bother. You made me forget. If I was you, I'd think about skedaddling out of here. Why? 'Cause it's ""Windsday."" ""Windsday""? Oh! Then I think I shall wish everyone a happy ""Windsday""... and I shall begin with my very dear friend, Piglet. Now, Piglet lived in the middle of the forest in a very grand house... in the middle of a beech tree. And Piglet loved it very much. Whew, yes. Whoops. You see, it's been in the family a long time. It belonged to my grandfather. Oh, that's his name up there, ""Trespassers Will."" That's short for ""Trespassers William."" Trespassers William? Yes. And Grandma... Oh. She called him T.W. That's even shorter. Yes, yes, yes. And on this blustery day... Whoo! The wind was giving you a bit of a bother. Now, you've been here before. I don't mind the leaves that are leaving. It's the leaves that are coming. Whoops! Happy ""Windsday,"" Piglet. Well, it isn't very happy for me. Where are you going, Piglet? That's what I'm asking myself, where? WWhoops! PPPooh! And what do you think you will answer yourself? Oh, oh, oh! I'm unravelling. Whoops! Oh, ttthat was a ccclose one! Hang on tight, Piglet. Oh, dear. Oh, dddear, dear! Look, Mama, look! A kite! Oh, my goodness, it's Piglet! Happy ""Windsday,"" Kanga. Happy ""Windsday,"" Roo. Can I fly Piglet next, Pooh? Oh, dear. Oh, dddear, dear! There, that should stand against anything. Oh, oh! Help, help! Somebody, sssave me! Happy ""Windsday,"" Eeyore. Thanks for noticing me. Oh, bbbbother! Ah. Oh, what a refreshing day for harvesting. Happy Windsday, Rabbit. Pooh bear, Stop! Oh, go back! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, yes! Well, next time, I hope he blows right through my rutabaga patch. Whoops! Huh? Who, who, who? Who is it? It's me. PPPlease, may I come in? Well, I say now. Someone has pasted Piglet on my window. Well, well! Pooh too. This is a surprise. Do come in and make yourselves... comfortable. Oh! Am I correct in assuming it is a rather blustery day outside? Yes, sir, Owl. It's a very, very blustery day outside. Oh, yes. That reminds me. Happy ""Windsday,"" Owl. My good fellow, I wouldn't go so far as to call it a ""Windsday""... just a gentle spring zephyr. Excuse me, Owl, but... is there honey in that pot? Oh, yes, yes, of course. Help yourself. Now, as I was saying... this is just a mild spring zephyr compared to the big wind of'67. Or was it, uh, '76? Oh, well, no matter. Oh, I remember the big blow well. L'll remember this one too. It was the year my Aunt Clara went to visit her cousin. Now, her cousin was not only gifted on the glockenspiel... but being a screech owl, also sang soprano in the London opera. Thank you, Piglet. You see, her constant practicing... so unnerved my aunt that she laid a sea gull egg by mistake. Oh, dear. Oh, dddear, dear. Well, I say now, someone has... Pooh, did you do that? I don't think so. As soon as Christopher Robin heard of the disaster... he hurried to the scene of Owl's misfortune. What a pity. Owl, I don't think we will ever be able to fix it. If you ask me, when a house looks like that... it's time to find another one. That's a very good idea, Eeyore. Might take a day or two, but l'll find a new one. Good, that will just give me time to tell you about my Uncle Clyde... a very independent barn owl. He didn't give a hoot for tradition. He became enamored of a pussycat... and went to sea in a beautiful peagreen boat. Owl talked from page 41 to page 62. And on page 62, the blustery day turned into a blustery night. To Pooh, it was a very anxious sort of night... filled with anxious sorts of noises. And one of the noises was a sound that had never been heard before. Ah, is that you, Piglet? WWell, tell me about it tomorrow, Eeyore? Oh, come in, Christopher Robin. Now Pooh, being a bear of very little brain... decided to invite the new sound in. Hello, out there. Oh, I hope nobody answers. Hello, I'm Tigger! Oh. You scared me. Yeah, sure I did. Everyone's scared of tiggers. Uh, who are you? I'm Pooh. Oh, a pooh. Sure. What's a pooh? You're sitting on one. I am? Oh, well, glad to meet ya. Name's Tigger. TI, double ""guh,"" ""err."" That spells ""Tigger."" But what is a tigger? Well, he asked for it! The wonderful thing about tiggers  is tiggers are wonderful things  Their tops are made out of rubber  Their bottoms are made out of springs  They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy  pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun  But the most wonderful thing  about tiggers is I'm the only one  I'm the only one  Then what's that over there? Huh? Oh, hey, hey. Look, look, look. Oh, what a strangelooking creature. Look at those beady little eyes, and that ""purrposturous"" chin... and those ""rickydiculus"" striped pajamas. Looked like another tigger to me. Oh, no, it's not. I'm the only tigger. Watch me scare the stripes off of this impostor. IsIsIs... Is he gone? All except the tail. He's gone. Uh, you can come out now, Tigger. Tigger? Hello, I'm Tigger. You said that. Oh? Well, did I say I was hungry? I don't think so. Well, then l'll say it. I'm hungry. Oh, not for honey, I hope. Honey! Oh, boy, honey! That's what tiggers like best. I was afraid of that. Oh, say. Yuck! Tiggers don't like honey! But you said that you liked... That icky, sticky stuff is only fit for ""heffalumps"" and ""woozles."" You mean elephants and weasels. That's what I said... ""heffalumps"" and ""woozles."" Well, what do heffa... lalla... What do they do? Oh, nothin' much. Just steal honey. Steal honey? Yeah, they sure do. Well, I'd better be bouncing along now, chum. Cheerio! The wonderful thing about tiggers  is tiggers are wonderful things  Their tops are made out of rubber  their bottoms are made out of springs  They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy  pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun  But the most wonderful thing  about tiggers is I'm the only one  I'm the only one  Well, if what Tigger said was true... and there really were ""heffalumps"" and ""woozles"" about... there was only one thing to do: Take drastic precautions to protect his precious honey. Oh, hello. Am I glad to see you. It's more friendly with two. Now, you go that way... and l'll go this way. You didn't see anything, did you? Neither did I. Now, the very blustery night... turned into a very rainy night... and Pooh kept his lonely vigil... hour after hour after hour. Until, at last... Pooh fell fast asleep and began to dream. ""Heffalumps"" and ""woozles."" ""Heffalumps"" and ""woozles"" steal honey. Beware. Beware. They're black, they're brown  They're up, they're down  They're in, they're out  They're all about  They're far, they're near  They're gone, they're here  They're quick and slick  They're insincere  Beware, beware  be a very wary bear  A ""heffalump""or ""woozle""  is very ""confusle""  A ""heffalump""or ""woozle's""  very sly, sly, sly, sly  They come in ones and ""twosles""  but if they so ""choosles""  Before your eyes you'll see them  multiply, ply, ply, ply  They're extraordinary  so better be wary  Because they come in every  shape and size, size, size, size  If honey's what you covet  you'll find that they love it  Because they guzzle up  the thing you prize  They're green, they're blue  They're pink, they're white  They're round, they're square  They're a terrible sight  They tie themselves in horrible knots  They come in stripes or polka dots  Beware, beware  be a very wary bear  They're extraordinary  so better be wary  Because they come in every  shape and size, size, size, size  If honey's what you covet  you'll find that they love it  Because they'll guzzle up  the things you prize  They're black, they're brown  They're up, they're down  They're in, they're out  They're all about  They're far, they're near  They're gone, they're here  They're quick and slick  They're insincere  Beware, beware, beware, beware  Beware  Is it raining in there? It's raining out here too. As a matter of fact, it was raining all over the HundredAcre Wood. There was a thunder storm on page 71. And on page 73, there was a bit of a cloudburst. It rained and it rained and it rained. The rain, rain, rain  came down, down, down  In rushing rising rivulets  Till the river crept out of its bed  And crept right into Piglet's  Poor Piglet he was frightened  With quite a rightful fright  And so in desperation  a message he did write  Help! PPPiglet... Me! He placed it in a bottle  And it floated out of sight  And the rain, rain, rain  came down, down, down  So Piglet started bailing  He was unaware atop his chair  while bailing he was sailing  And the rain, rain, rain  came down, down, down  And the flood rose  up, up, upper  Pooh too was caught  and so he thought  I must rescue my supper  Ten honey pots he rescued  enough to see him through  But as he sopped up his supper  The river sopped up Pooh  And the water twirled  and tossed him  In a honey pot canoe  Rain, rain, rain  came down, down, down  When the rain, rain, rain  came down, down, down  So the HundredAcre Wood got floodier and floodier. But the water couldn't come up to Christopher Robin's house... so that's where everyone was gathering. It was a time of great excitement. But in the midst of all the excitement... Eeyore stubbornly stuck to his task of househunting for Owl. There's one. Cozy cottage, nice location. A bit damp for Owl, though. Meanwhile, little Roo made an important discovery. Look! I've rescued a bottle. And it's got something in it too. It's a message, and it says: ""Help! PPPiglet... Me!"" Owl, you fly over to Piglet's house... and tell him we'll make a rescue. A rescue? Yes, yes. Of course, of course. So Owl flew out over the flood... and he soon spotted two tiny objects below him. One was little Piglet caught in the whirlpool... and the other was Pooh trying to get the last bit of honey from the pot. Yumyum. Oh, Owl, I don't mean to cccomplain, but I'm afraid I'm scared. Now, now, Piglet, chin up and all that sort of thing. A rescue is being thought of. Be brave, little Piglet. It's awfully hard to be bbbrave when you're such a small animal. Then to divert your small mind from your unfortunate predicament... I shall tell you an amusing anecdote. It concerns a distant cousin of mine... who became so frightened during a flood that he... I beg your pardon, Owl, but I ththink... we're coming to a ""flutterfall""... a ""flatterfall""...a very big waterfall. Please, no interruptions. Ah, there you are, Pooh bear. Now, to continue my story... Look, there's Pooh. Over here, Pooh! Oh, hello, Christopher Robin. Pooh, thank goodness you're safe. Have you seen Piglet? Excuse me, I have... What I mean is, here I am. Pooh, you rescued Piglet. I did? Yes, and it was a very brave thing to do. It was? You are our hero. I am? And as soon as the flood is over, I shall give you a hero party. Attention, everybody. Now, this party is a hero party because of what someone did. And that someone is... I found it. Found what, Eeyore? House for Owl. I say, Eeyore, good show! Oh, isn't that wonderful. Where is it, Eeyore? If you want to follow me, l'll show it to you. So everyone followed Eeyore. Then, to the surprise of all, Eeyore stopped right in front of... Piglet's house? Why are you stopping here, Eeyore? This is it, Owl's new house. Oh, dear, mercy me! Oh, dear, mercy me too! Name's on it and everything. WOL, that spells Owl. Bless my soul, so it does. Well, what do you think of it? It is a nice house, Eeyore, but... It is a lovely house, Eeyore, but... It's... It's the best house in the whole world. Tell them it's your house, Piglet. No, Pooh. This house belongs to our very good friend... Owl. But, Piglet, where will you live? Well, l... I guess I shall live... I suppose lI shall live... With me! You shall live with me. Won't you, Piglet? With you? Oh, thank you, Pooh bear. Of course I will. Piglet, that was a very grand thing to do. A heroic thing to do. Christopher Robin... can you make a onehero party into a twohero party? Of course we can... silly old bear. And so, Pooh was a hero for saving Piglet... and Piglet was a hero for giving Owl his grand home in the beech tree. We never will forget  our hero of the wet  Our quick thinking  unsinking Pooh bear  And Piglet who indeed  helped out a friend in need  Truly they're the heroes of the day  So we say, Hip hip hooray  for the piglet and the pooh  Piglet and Pooh, we salute you  What's all that stompin' and singin' and silly shenanigans? And generosity  Hip hip hooray  Hip hip hooray  Hip hip hooray for Winnie the Pooh  And Piglet too! I sure like bouncing. Wasn't that fun, Piglet? Yes, Pooh, bbut the best part is when it ststops. Well, in the next chapter, there's a great deal of bouncing. There is? Oh. I think that I just remembered... something that I forgot to do yesterday... andand shan't be able to do tomorrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back andand do it nnow. Uh, goodbye, Pooh. Goodbye, Piglet. Now, is the next chapter all about me? No, no. It's mostly about Tigger. Oh, bother. But you're in it. Oh, good. What will I be doing? Well, Pooh, you'll be sitting in your thoughtful spot... thinking, as usual. Think, think. Think, think, think. Think. Think. And while he was thinking, all of a sudden... Hello, Pooh! I'm Tigger! TI, double ""guh,"" ""err."" That spells ""Tigger."" Yeah, I know. You've bounced me before. I did? Oh, yeah! I ""recoggonize"" you. You're the one that's stuffed with fluff. Yeah. And you're sitting on it. Yeah. And it's comfy too. Well, I gotta go now. I got a lot of bouncing to do. TTFN. Tata for now. Well, there goes Tigger... always bouncing in on his friends when they least expect him. Oh, hello, Piglet! I'm Tigger. Oh, Tigger. You scscared me. Oh, shucks. That was just one of my little bounces. It was? Oh, thank you, Tigger. Yeah. I'm saving my best bounce for old longears! Tata! Hum de dum, dum  Hum de dum, dum  Hum de dum, dum  Dum de dum, dum  There. There. That should do it. Oh, no. Stop, stop! Hello, Rabbit. I'm Tigger. TI, double ""guh""... Please! Please! Don't spell it. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Just... Just look at my beautiful garden. Yuck! And messy, isn't it? Messy? Messy! It's ruined! It's ruined, Tigger. Oh, why don't you ever stop bouncing? Why? That's what tiggers do best. The wonderful thing about tiggers  is tiggers are wonderful things  Their tops are made out of rubber  Their bottoms are made out of springs  They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy  pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun  But the most wonderful thing  about tiggers is I'm the only one  I'm the only one  Order. Order, please. Now, I say Tigger's getting so bouncy nowadays that it's time we taught him a lesson. No matter how much we like him... you can't deny he just bounces too much. Ah, eexcuse me, Rabbit. But, uh, perhaps if we could think of a way of""unbouncing"" Tigger... well, it would be a very good idea, huh? Exactly! Just what I feel. What do you feel, Pooh? Pooh! Ah... Haven't you been listening to what Rabbit's been saying? I listened, but then I had a small piece of fluff in my ear. Could you say it again, please, Rabbit? Well, where should I start from? From the moment the fluff got in my ear. Well, when was that? I don't know. I couldn't hear properly. Pooh, we were just trying to think of a way to get the bounce out ofTigger. Oh, I've got a splendid idea. Now, listen. We'll take Tigger for a long explore, see? Someplace where he's never been... and we lose him there. Lose him? Oh, we'll find him again, next morning. And mark my words, he'll be a humble tigger... a smallandsad tigger... an ""Oh, Rabbit, amlgladtoseeyou"" tigger. And it'll take the bounces out of him, that's why. Now, all in favor, say, ""aye."" Aye. Pooh? Pooh! Uh, here. Good. Just good. Motion carried. So it was agreed that they would start the next morning... which, incidentally, turned out cold and misty. Pooh, as usual, had a little something along to sustain himself. And now, as Tigger kept bouncing farther and farther into the mist... Rabbit thought it was a good time to lose Tigger. Now's our chance. Quick! In here. Hide. Tigger's lost now, isn't he, Rabbit? Oh, he's lost, all right, Piglet. Oh, goody. This is lots of fun, Pooh. My splendid idea worked. Now, home we go. Good! Yumyum. It's time for lunch. Halloo! Oh, my goodness. Hide! Halloo! That's funny. They must be lost. Hello! Hey, you blokes. Where are ya? He... Shush. I am shushed. Hey, where in the heck are you guys? Halloo! Rabbit? Piglet? Where are you? Halloo! Hooray! Hooray, we've done it. Now, come on, hurry. Let's head for home. Well, Rabbit was certain that everything was going according to plan... and so it seemed to be. But sometime later... on the bottom of page 123... It's a funny thing how everything looks the same in the mist. He's right, Piglet. It's the very same sand pit. I think so too, Pooh. Well, it's lucky I know the forest so well, or... or, or we might get lost. Well, come on. Follow me. Now, Pooh was getting tired of seeing the same sand pit... and he suspected it of following them about. Because whichever direction they started in... they always seemed to end up at it. Uh, er, Rabbit? Yes? Say, Rabbit, how would it be... if as soon as we're out of sight of this old pit... we just try to find it again? What's the good of that? Well, you see, we keep looking for home... but we keep finding this pit. So I just thought that if we looked for this pit we might find home. I don't see much sense in that. If I walked away from this pit... and then walked back to it, of course I should find it. L'll prove it to you. Wait here. So Pooh and Piglet waited in the mist for Rabbit. And they waited... and waited, and waited. And all the while, Pooh's thoughts kept returning... to his honey pots at home. WWWhat was that, Pooh? My tummy rumbled. Now then, come on. Let's go home. But, Pooh, do you know the way? No, Piglet, but there are 12 pots of honey in my cupboard... and they have been calling to my tummy. They have? Yes, Piglet. I couldn't hear them before because Rabbit would talk. I think I know where they're calling from. So come on. We'll just follow my tummy. Well, they walked off together... and for a long time Piglet said nothing... so as not to interrupt Pooh's honey pots. And sure enough, as the mist got thinner... and just when Piglet began to know where he was... Hey, hello there, you two blokes. Where have you been? We've been trying to find our way back home. Pooh, I don't think Rabbit's splendid idea worked. Say, where is old longears, anyway? He must still be missing in the mist. Well, leave it to me. L'll bounce him out of there! TTFN. Tata for now. Meanwhile, Rabbit was still wandering around in the mist. By now, he was lost and bewildered. And to make matters worse... his mind was beginning to play tricks on him. What's that? Pooh? Piglet? Help! Hello, Rabbit! Tigger! BBBut you're supposed to be lost. Aw, Tiggers never get lost, bunny boy. Never get lost? Of course not. Oh, no. Come on, Rabbit. Let's go home. Hang on! So they started back. And Rabbit was now a humiliated rabbit... a lostandfound rabbit... an ""Ohwhy, ohwhydothesethings happentome"" rabbit. And now we come to the next chapter... in which the first snowfall had covered the HundredAcre Wood. And in which Tigger learns that even bouncing can be overdone. On this day, Roo was waiting for Tigger to take him out to play. Mama, when is Tigger gonna get here? Be patient, dear. He'll be... Whee! Well, here I am! Did I surprise you, Roo? You sure did! I like surprises. Hello, Mrs. Kanga, ma'am. Why, hello, Tigger, dear. She called me ""dear."" Roo, are you ready for some bouncing? Yeah! You and me are good bouncers. Just a moment, dear. Hold still. Goodness, you're bouncy today. That's what roos do the ""bestest."" Now keep your scarf on. Not so tight, Mama. Is your sweater warm enough? Yes, Mother. Well, come on, Roo. Let's go! Tigger, have Roo home in time for his nap. And be careful! Don't worry, Mrs. Kanga. L'll take care of the little nipper. Da, da, da, da  Da, da, da, da  Ah! What a perfect day! Peace and quiet... and thank goodness, no Tigger. Say, look, look, look. If it isn't old longears. Can tiggers iceskate as fancy as Mr. Rabbit? Can tiggers iceskate? Why, that's what tiggers do the best. Whee! Say, this is a cinch. Whee! Oh, no. Not him! Uhoh, look out. I can't... Watch out! It can't be! Out of the way! Out of the way! Look out! I can't... Whoa! Oh, why does it always have to be me? Why, oh, why, oh, why? Tigger, Tigger, are you all right? Yuck! Tiggers don't like ice skating. So Tigger and Roo went farther into the HundredAcre Wood... Iooking for something that tiggers do best. I bet you can climb trees, huh, Tigger? Climb trees? That's what tiggers do best! Only tiggers don't climb trees. They bounce them! Come on, let's go. I almost bounced clear out of the book. Some bouncing, huh? Say, how did this tree get so high? Hey. HHHey! Hey, what's happening now? Don't swing on a string. It's much too frail. The best kind of swing is a tigger's tail. Whee! SSStop that, kid. Please. STOP, stop. You're rocking the forest. What's the matter, Tigger? Whew! Oh, thank goodness. I was just getting seasick from seeing too much. Well, we'll just have to leave Tigger up in the tree top for a little while. Because, at the bottom of the next page... Pooh is having a problem of his own. What are you doing, Pooh? Shh! Tracking something. Tracking what? Well, that's what I asked myself, Piglet. What? And what do you think you'll answer yourself? I shall have to wait until I catch up with it. Pooh, for a bear of very little brain... you sure are a smart one! Thank you, Piglet. Aha, ha! Oh! NNNow wwwhat? A very mysterious thing, Piglet. A whole new set of tracks. See? And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks joining each other here... getting mixed up with each other there. But to Pooh, quite plainly, four sets of paw marks. Piglet, whatever it was that made these tracks... has now been joined by a ""whateveritis."" YYYes. AAnd all of them are proceeding in company. Piglet, I wasn't exactly expecting company. NNNeither was I, Pooh. So they went on, feeling a little anxious now... in case the animals in front of them were of hostile intent. Halloo! Look, look, Piglet... there's something in that tree over there. Is it one of the fffiercer animals? Halloo! Yes. It's a ""jagular."" WWhat do jagulars ddo, Pooh? Well, jagulars always call, ""Halloo!"" And when you look up, they drop on you. I'm looking down, PPPooh. Halloo! Hey, Tigger, it's Pooh and Piglet. Pooh! Piglet! Why, it's only Tigger and Roo. Come on. Hello, Roo. Hey, what are you and Tigger doing up there? I'm all right, but Tigger's stuck. Help, somebody! Please! Get Christopher Robin. Well, it wasn't too long before word got back to Christopher Robin and the others that Tigger was in trouble. Hello, Pooh. Hello, Piglet. What's up? Tigger and Roo are up... Oh, my goodness. Roo, how did you get way up there? Easy, Mama. We bounced up. Oh, gracious. Do be careful, dear. I'm all right, Mama, but Tigger's stuck. Oh, what a shame. That's too bad. No, that's good. You see, he can't bounce anybody up there. Oh, dear. We'll just have to get him down somehow. Down? Down? Do we have to? Come on, everyone. Let's hold the corner of my coat. You're first, Roo. Jump! Try not to fall too fast, dear. Whee! Oh, thank goodness. Gee, that was fun! Come on, Tigger. It doesn't hurt. Jump! You're next, Tigger. Jump! Jump? Tiggers don't jump. They bounce. Then bounce down. Don't be ""ridiccorous."" Tiggers only bounce up! You can climb down, Tigger. Ah, but tiggers can't climb down, uh, because, uh, their tails get in the way. Hooray! That settles it. If he won't jump and he can't climb down... then we'll just have to leave him up there forever! Forever? Oh, if I ever get out of this... I promise never to bounce again, never! I heard that, Tigger. He promised! Did you hear him promise? I heard him. I heard him! You heard him, didn't you? Didn't you? Well, Tigger, your bouncing really got you into trouble this time. Say, who are you? I'm the narrator. Oh, well, please, for goodness' sakes, narrate me down from here. Very well. Hold on tight. You can let go now, Tigger. NNNever. But, Tigger, look for yourself. You're perfectly safe. What did I tell you, Tigger? Come on. Back we go. Oh! Good old terra firma. Say, I'm so happy, I feel like bouncing. Uhuhuh! You promised. You promised. Oh. Oh, I did, didn't I? You mean, I can't ever bounce again? Never! Never? Not even just one teensy, weensy bounce? Not even a smidgen of a bounce. Oh, the poor dear. Oh, that's too bad. Christopher Robin, I like the old bouncy Tigger best. So do I, Roo. I do too. Me too! Of course, we all do. Don't you agree, Rabbit? Ll... Well, Rabbit? Well, I, uh... That is, uh... Uh, what I mean... Well? Well, I, ah... Oh, all right. I guess I like the old Tigger better too. Oh, boy! You mean, I can have my bounce back? Come on, Rabbit. Let's you and me bounce. Good heavens! Me bounce? Why, certainly! Look, you've got the feet for it. I have? Sure. Come on, try it. It makes you feel just gggreat! Well, say, it does, doesn't it? Yes, it does. Well, come on, everybody, bounce! Come on, bounce. The wonderful thing about tiggers  is tiggers are wonderful things  Their tops are made out of rubber  Their bottoms are made out of springs  They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy  pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun  But the most wonderful thing  about tiggers is I'm the only one  I'm the only one  And so, we come to the last chapter... in which Christopher Robin and Pooh come to the enchanted place... and we say goodbye. Goodbye? Oh, no, please, can't we go back to page one and do it all over again? Sorry, Pooh, but all stories have an ending, you know. Oh, bother. Yes, the time had come at last. Christopher Robin was going away to school. Nobody else in the forest knew exactly why or where he was going. All they knew was it had something to do with ""twice times""... and how to make things called ""ABC's""... and where a place called Brazil is. Pooh? Huh? What do you like doing best in the world? What I like best is me going to visit you... and you saying, ""How about a smackerel of honey?"" I like that too. But what I like best is just doing nothing. How do you do ""just nothing""? Well... it's when grownups ask, ""What are you going to do?"" And you say, ""nothing."" Then you go out and do it. I like that. Let's do it all the time. You know something, Pooh... I'm not going to do just nothing anymore. You mean, never again? Well, not so much. Pooh... when I'm away just doing nothing... will you come up here sometimes? You mean, alone? Just me? Yes. And, Pooh, promise you won't forget me... ever? Oh, I won't, Christopher, I promise. Not even when I'm a hundred? How old shall I be then? Ninetynine. Silly old bear. Wherever they go... and whatever happens to them on the way... in that enchanted place on top of the forest... a little bear will always be waiting."
Oliver and Company,Disney,1980,1988,Animation,"Now it's always once upon a time in New York City.  It's a big old, bad old, tough old town.  It's true.  But beginnings are contagious there.  They're always settin' stages there.  They're always turnin' pages there for you.  Ain't it great the way it all begins in New York City.  Let me have one. Please. Right away you're makin' time.  And makin' friends.  No one cares where you were yesterday.  If they pick you out you're on your way.  To a once upon a time.  That never ends.  So, Oliver, don't be shy.  Get out there and go and try.  Believin' that you're the guy.  They're dyin' to see.  'Cause a dream's no crime.  Not once upon a time.  Once upon a time in New York City.  If it's always once upon a time in New York City.  Why does nightfall find ya feelin' so alone.  How could anyone stay starryeyed.  When it's rainin' cats and dogs outside.  And the rain is saying ""Now you're on your own"".  So, Oliver, don't be scared.  Though yesterday no one cared.  They're gettin' your place prepared.  Where you wanna be.  Keep your dream alive.  Dreamin' is still how the strong survive.  Once upon a time in New York City.  Keep your dream alive.  Dreamin' is still how the strong survive.  Once upon a time in New York City.  Keep your dream alive.  Dreamin' is still how the strong survive.  Once upon a time in New York City.  And it's always once upon a time.  In New York City.  Forty seconds. All right. Here we go. You see the feet walkin' down the street in the fast lane.  Walkin' on the street where they goin'.  Just makin' a move tryin' to survive.  Find a way or not to stay alive.  Cool cat in a cruel world knows good from bad, his mind is in a swirl.  Got to look out and open your eyes.  If you're in a jam you got to realize.  You're in the fast lane. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  In the fast lane. Wait, wait, wait.  Hi. Sorry I'm late. That's all right. Come on, sweetheart. We're late. You can play with the kitty some other time, honey. Come on. Hey, 'scusa me. Don't ya see I'm pushin' somethin' here? Thank you. Hey, come on, folks! Step right up. Get your hot dogs. The best hot dogs in New York. Hey, it's a beautiful day, eh?

Hmm. Psst. Psst. Hiya. Hmph! Ooh. Ladeda. Hey! Hey, get off of me! What's the matter with you? Well, well. I said get outta here. Looks like Louie's got a visitor. Could be time for the Dodge to turn this into a total ""catastrophe."" Get off me! Get outta here. Go on! Shoo! Ooh, you sure picked the wrong guy to get hot dogs from, kid. Get away from me! Whoa! Chill out, man. I don't eat cats. It's too much fur. I've been watching you, and I think you're in serious need of some professional guidance. Now what do ya say we team up and change old Louie's mind about sharing those hot dogs? I'm not goin' back there again. Hey. It'd be a snap, kid. I'm an expert at these things. All you gotta do is learn some moves. Moves? You know. Tempo. Ooochaba. A rhythm. This city's got a beat. You gotta hook into it. And once you got the beat, you can do anything. Loan? ""Absitively posolutely."" The man you see before you is affectionately known as ""Old Louie."" A wellknown enemy of the fourlegged world. Our mission, cat, is to liberate those allbeef kosher franks and hightail it outta here. Startin' to feel that rhythm? Well, uh... Yeah! Yeah! I do feel it! When are we gonna get those hot dogs? Right now. Hey! Dog. Hey! Get outta here! Hey! Hey! Hey. Get outta there! I'll get you! Kitty! Hey, you really got that rhythm, kid. Uh... Yeah? We were good, huh? So when are we gonna eat? We? Yeah. I'm starvin'. Listen, kid. I hate to break it to ya, but the dynamic duo is now the dynamic uno.  What do ya mean? What I mean is, our partnership is herewith dissolved. But, wait! Wait. You're not being fair! Fairs are for tourists, kid. Consider it a free lesson in street savoir faire from New York's coolest quadruped. Check ya later. Hey, wait! I helped you get those! Half of those are mine! Ya want 'em? Come and get 'em. Uhhuh  But I'm warnin' ya, kid. One minute I'm in Central Park  Then I'm down on Delancey Street  What the... Hey!

Stop that racket! I'm trying to watch this show. There would have been a time for such a word.  Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow creeps...  In this petty pace from day to day and all our yesterdays  have lighted fools the way to dusty death.  Hey, Frankie, whatcha watchin'? Hey, does he get the girl? I mean, what happens? Shut up, you little rodent. Hey, man, this stuff is boring, man. Come on, let's watch some boxing. I wanna see some action. Hey, Frankie. Que' peso'? You're getting slow, man. My name is Francis. Francis. Not Frank. Not Frankie. Francis. No kidding, man? Hey, so what did you bring in today, ""Frahncees""? It's none of your business, you intrusive little pipsqueak. Look what I got. Oh, good show, Einstein. Now all we need is the court and the net. You think this place is big enough? Hey, come on. What we need is some good quality stuff, man. Check it out. Oh, shredded leather. Shredded what? What you talkin' about, man? That's a primo wallet, man. Rubbish, you mean. All right, that does it, Frankie, man! You insulted my pride! That means death! Behold. The runt of the litter. Cut it out, you two. Frankie! Frankie! Arf! Fagin's not gonna be too happy about this. So, Francis, you got the food, right? Well, no. I... Ooh, Frankie. Frankie. It was your turn to get the food today. It's newspaper burritos again! Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Cool it, Dodger fans. I'd like to introduce you to... Your dinner. Ia Dodger. Hot dogs! All right, Dodger man! You remain our preeminent benefactor. Yeah. And you're okay, too. So how'd you do it this time, Dodgie baby? Let me tell you, Rita. It was tough. Only I could have done it. Did you have to fight, man? Did you fight? How many were there? Picture the city. Eighth and Broadway. The crowds hustling. The traffic roaring. The hot dogs are sizzling. I love a story with food in it. Enter Dodger, one bad puppy. Not just out for himself, but community minded. But he's not the only one out there. Enter the opposition. A greedy, ugly, psychotic monster... With razorsharp claws, dripping fangs, and nine lives, all of them hungry. He comes at me, eyes burning. I knew my time had come. Suddenly... Gang war! Gang war! Watch out! Here comes a gang war! Help! Take cover! Well, what is it? Hey, man, check it out. Ay, it's a alien! Cool it, guys. It's just a cat. Mi madre, un gato! Felis domesticus!  Now, how'd you find this place, cat? I followed this dog. He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! Shut up, Tito! Why would a cat follow a dog? Yeah? I... I just wanted some of the sausages I helped him get. He's a spy, man! Come on, let's eat him. You're dead meat, kitty. I... I saw him come down. Hey! That's... Hey, that's him! Over there. Hmm? Hey, kitty. What took you so long? Relax, kid. Dodger, razorsharp claws? Dripping fangs? I kind of like those burning eyes. Hey, keep it down, guys. The game's on. Oh, boy, Dodger. Top dog has to get help from a cat. Hey, Tito, cool it, man. Come on. Let's see this big, bad kitty fight in action. Hey, Tito, look! Oh, boy! Dog pile! Oh, what a bunch of overgrown... Oof! All right. That's it. All right, all right, knock it off! Enough! What's the matter with you guys? Don't you understand? Sykes will be here any minute. And I don't have... No, no, no, no, no! No, no. Stop it. No. No. No licking. What a joke! All right, settle down. Sykes! All right, all right. I'm coming. I'll be right there. You guys, listen. Don't let me down. What do you got? Let's see what you got. It's worthless! What have you done? Oh, how are we ever going to pay Sykes off with a pussycat? Oh. Look who's here, kids. Company. Nice doggies. I was just on my way out. You guys miss us? Mr. Sykes. I, uh... He's gonna kill me. Hello. Oh, lovely evening. I was just saying this to your two lovely purebred Dobermans. The money, Fagin. Actually, I've got something much better than money. Some luxury items that should make a considerable dent in my debt to you. Oh, my! You waxed your car, didn't you? Did they use the buffer on it, because I can see myself. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I don't want your garbage, Fagin! Oh, please, Sykes. Oh, please. Oh, please. I don't think you grasp the severity of the situation. Oh, no! Oh, no, I did grasp it. This is how I grasp. Look. Accident. Accident! Oohhoohoo! Mr. Fagin! Sorry. Now, I lent you money and I don't see it. Do you know what happens when I don't see my money, Fagin? People get hurt. People like you get hurt. Do I make myself clear? Clear! Perfectly clear! Ya know, Rita, I can't figure out, why you'd rather hang around a dump like this, when you could be living uptown with a class act like myself. Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's entire vocabulary in a single sentence? Hey, Frankie, get down, brother. You bad, man. Hey, you got something to say to me, fat boy? Come on, you guys don't scare me. I'll kill you both. Come on, let me at 'em! I'll kill 'em! I'll kill 'em! Go ahead. Let him go. Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Like you, old man? Hey, Roscoe. Roscoe, is this us losing our sense of humor? Nah. I ain't lost my sense of humor. See? I find that funny. Oh, please. Please. Oh, please! Three sunrises. Three sunsets. Three days, Fagin. Three sunrises. Three sunsets. Three days. Three, three, three. That's nine. Nine? No, Fagin. Three. Three! Oh, you mean, just three days? Oh, my goodness! Oh, I'm having a bad day! Hey, hey, Roscoe. Look what I found. Forget it, Desoto. We gotta go. I like cats. I like to eat 'em. Get out of my way, Dodger. That's enough, Roscoe. Run along, Roscoe. Your master's calling. Come on, Desoto. We ain't finished, Dodger. You guys are gonna pay for this, starting with that cat. Oh, yeah? You guys don't scare me! Come on and say it to my face! Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! Yeah, those creeps'll think twice before hassling us, man. All right, kid. What'd I tell you guys? OI' Dodge can really pick 'em, huh? Ooh, three days. How am I ever gonna come up with all that money? What's the use? I'll never get out from under that maniac. My days are numbered and the number is three. It's hopeless. Thanks, guys. That reminds me. I saw Desoto's nose. Who did that? You? You. That took a lot of guts. We've never had a cat in the gang before. We can use all the help we can get. Ahhh. All right. Time for bed. We've got a big day tomorrow. Aww, no. Oh, all right. But just one chapter tonight. Um, let's see. Here we are. Here we are. Chapter 7. ""Sparky stopped and he rolled in a field of wildflowers. ""The dandelions tickled his nose, ""till he laughed out loud. ""And then something caught his eye. ""It was Bumper the rabbit. ""Sparky jumped to his feet, ""and ran toward Bumper barking loudly."" Woof. Woof. Well, you try it sometime. Ruff! RRuff! Well, that's because you're a dog. ""Sparky knew that Bumper would run ""and that he could chase him over the field. ""But Sparky would never catch him or hurt him ""because Sparky was not that kind of a dog."" This is the big one. We've got two days to do or die. Dodger, you keep an eye on the new kid. Show him the ropes. I don't wanna put any undue pressure on you, but, as you march off to do your duty, I want you to keep one thing in mind. Dead men do not buy dog food! So, big smiles and get out there, and fetch! All right. If Mr. Sykes don't see some cold, hard cash soon, we are Doberman chow. Come on. We'll start on Columbus Avenue. What kind of work do we do, anyway? Investment banking, man. Didn't you read about us in the Wall Street Journal? Really? Yes. Captains of industry. Gosh! Can I be one too? Hey, when you got your pals, you got all ya need. Okay, Dodge. We gotta clean you up, child, and give you some onthejob training. Ooo, yeah Now listen up  You got a lot to learn  And if you don't learn you don't eat  But if you're tough and always use your head  You'll feel right at home on the street  When you got talent Everything is free  Watch how we do things Ooo, I guarantee  You're gonna see how the best survive  We make an art out of staying alive  If you do just as you're told  These are streets of gold  Every boulevard is a miracle mile  You'll take the town and you'll take it with style  If you play it brave and bold  These are streets of gold  Hello? What have we here? All right! A chauffeur shuffle! Listen up. Einstein, gimme a fender bender at two lights. Tito. You're in charge of electronics. Rita and I'll work the crowd. Francis... I know. My public awaits. Hey, but what about me? What do I do? You help Tito. All right! Come on, gato.  Uncle Tito will show you how it's done. Ready? Go! Winston, listen to this. ""After a little sightseeing, we left Paris by car ""for the con, confer..."" Conference, Jennifer. Oh, yes. Conference. ""In Rome on Wednesday. ""Jenny, I'm afraid your father and I won't be able to make it..."" Is there anything wrong, Jenny? Are your parents all right? They're staying longer. Oh, don't worry. I'm sure they'll be home for your birthday. No. What was that? I... I don't know. But... But now, don't be alarmed. I'll be right back. Run, Sparky. Go find Bumper. Why me? Today of all days. Hey, check it out, man. Beep, beep. Hey, forget Fagin, man. Let's take this baby to Atlantic City. What have I done? Poor thing. You oughta be ashamed of yourself! I'm sure he's just fine. Harming that poor... Probably just a little stunned. Run along, little fellow. Go on, now. Shoo. Hey, Tito. What can I do? Well, uh... Why don't you be a lookout, man? Yeah, that's it. Be a lookout. Okay. What is a lookout? Ay! Look, just look out the window. Make sure it's still daylight, okay? Hey. Hey, Tito. Tito, there's somethin' back there. Hey, stop hasslin' me, man. I only got one more wire, okay? But... But... What's goin' on here? Let's get outta here! Oh, you poor kitty. Here. Let me help you. Jenny, are you all right? Where's the kid? He must still be in the car, man. Oh, that poor little kid. You were supposed to keep an eye on him, Tito! Yeah. Well, it's hard to watch anything when you're getting barbecued, man. What are we gonna do, Dodge? Tito, come with me. The rest of you, get back to Fagin. Now, really, Jenny. We can't just take in a stray off the street. But look at the poor thing. Winston, he's half starved. Ah. I know you're growing attached to the little fellow, but do try to understand. Your parents left me responsible for you. They won't mind. Really. Don't worry, kitty. I'll take care of you. Georgette is not going to like this. Rise and shine, Georgette. Your public awaits. Girl, we've got work to do  Pass me the paint  And glue  Perfect isn't easy  But it's me  When one knows the world is watching  One does what one must  Some minor adjustments, darling  Not for my vanity but for humanity  Each little step a pose  See how the breeding shows Ooh!  Sometimes it's too much for even me  But when all the world says yes  Then who am I to say no  Don't ask a mutt to strut like a showgirl  No, girl, ya need a pro  Not a flea or a flaw  Take a peek at that paw  Ladedada Perfection becomes me N' estce pas'?  Unrivaled, unruffled  I'm beauty unleashed, yeah  Jaws drop, hearts stop  So classic and classy We're not talkin' Lassie  Aaa... Aaa... Ooo... Ooo...

Wait till you taste this. It's a secret recipe I just invented. What on earth... My goodness! Jenny! Don't you think a tin of kitty chow would have sufficed? Nonsense. He'll love this. Now, young lady. I really think we should've waited until your parents... Ugh! Oh, bother! And for ze kitty, the house specialty. Ia Jenny avec Cocoa Krispies. Mmm. Jenny, it's your parents! Yeah! Wait till I tell 'em! Oh, yes, sir. I do assure you everything is absolutely hunky... Georgette, I wouldn't go in there if I were you. Uh, everything's fine here. They're gonna be so excited. Here she is now. A cat! What is the meaning of this? Winston! I guess I'll have to handle this myself. Hello. Hello. I, um, hope you won't think me rude, but do you happen to know out of whose bowl you're eating? Yours? Ooh! Aren't you a clever kitty? And do you have any idea whose home this is? I thought it was Jenny's. Well, it may be Jenny's house, but everything from the doorknobs down is mine! Oh, Georgette. I see you've met Oliver. Isn't he cute? I've got great news. Mom and Dad just said I could keep him. I'm sure you two are gonna be the best of friends. Now for $200..  Where's the kid? We tailed him all the way up the park. We never had a chance. You should see this place. There's gotta be maybe 200 people livin' there. We can't let the kid take the heat for us. Yeah, man. If we don't get him, they're gonna torture that kid. What in heaven's name are we waiting for? But what about Fagin? Alas, our beleaguered benefactor, bearing the brunt of our futile endeavors. Gimme a break. Speak English, Frankie. Francis. Francis. Francis! All right, cool it! Now we got work to do. First, we'll spring the kid. Then we'll take care of the old man. All right? Yeah! That's right, man! He's family. He's blood. Hear, hear! Okay, troops. Our mission begins at daybreak. Einstein, go up to the door. Francis, you're our... Oh, Jennifer. I don't hear any practicing! All right, Winston. I gotta practice now, kitty. Oh, you wanna practice too. You and me together  Will be forever  You'll see  We two can be good company  You and me  Yes, together we two  Hmph! Together that's you  Forever with me  We'll always be good company  You and me  Yes, together we'll be  You and me together  Will be forever  You'll see  We'll always be good company  You and me  Just wait and see  Good night, Oliver. Bye, Winston. Goodbye, Oliver. Hi, Jenny. Sit over here. All right, listen up. We checked it out. All we gotta do is... Oh, man! He's dead meat now! I'll handle that ruffian. Body slam! Body slam! Oh, come on, you fool! Hit him! Hit him! Oh, bother. Einy. Get outta there! Huh? Yes? Who is it? Oh, my You! I'll show you, you, you... Come back here! What... Miralo this place. Check it out. Chagall. Matisse. These are all masterpieces. Huh, this place looks pretty nice. I mean, how bad off could it be here? Hey, man, if this is torture, chain me to the wall. Tito! We're here for the kid, remember? Now let's get him and go. ""I love you, Oliver. Play with Georgette."" I'd like to play with him, all right! The little fur ball! Ooh. Who are you? What do you want? Winston! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Ooh! Don't come any closer! I knew this would happen one day. You're barkin' up the wrong tree. It's not you I'm after. It's not? It's not! Well, why not? What's the problem, Spot? Not good enough for you? I mean, do you even know who I am? Fiftysix blue ribbons. Fourteen regional trophies! Sixtime national champion! Ooh, and we're all very impressed. Right, guys? Very impressed. Oh! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ignacio Alonzo Julio Frederico de Tito. Get away from me, you little bugeyed creep! Winston! Excuse me, uh, sister. Who's Rex? None of your business! And you, tubby, off the bed! Get away from there, you... All right! That does it! You yoyos clear out and I mean now! Winston! Relax, champ. We'll leave as soon as we get our cat. If you think I'm intimidated by a bunch of fleabitten, dogpound rejects... Your cat? How stupid of me. You must be the friends he keeps talking about. Yes. Georgette. Something's not quite right here. Shh. Quick. Before he comes back. Follow me. Look at him, Dodger. Honey, let's just forget the whole thing. No, no, you can't do that! You don't understand. The poor dear's so traumatized. Georgette. Huh? What? What is going on here? Now get going. Hurry. Use the fire escape. Hey, there's no time for long goodbyes, but here's something to remember me by, baby. Ooh, I think she likes me, man. Ooh, I could've danced all night  I could've danced all night  You were very good. What? Nice job, Dodger. Hey, wait. What's goin' on, you guys? Just the rescue of the century. Rescue? Shoulda seen Frankie handle that butler. I was rather good, wasn't I? And how about Tito and Miss Sixtime National Champion? Hey, hey, but, wait. I don't understand you guys. You okay, kid? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, sure he is! He's back with his Uncle Tito. I was happy there. Why did you guys take me away? We rescued you, kitty. We... We brought you home. But, well, I have another home now. And someone who loves me. What do you mean, kid? You're in the gang. But, but... The gang means family. We risked a lot to get you outta there. Look, I'm sorry, but all I ever wanted was... What? This place is not good enough for you anymore? Don't wanna mix with the riffraff? No, no. I like you. I mean, I like... I like every one of you, but... But there was a little girl. I just wanna go back. We never should've took him, Dodger. But, Dodger, please... You wanna leave? Fine! There's the door. But he just got here. Go on. No one's stoppin' ya. Hey, uh, Dodger, man, uh, lighten up. You lighten up! If he doesn't like it, let him go. Oh, it's hopeless. What's this? So that's where you've been! Looks like you're doing all right for yourself, Oliver. Your owner probably spends more money on catnip than we do on food in a month. He's probably worried sick about you. All alone in that big house with only his money to comfort him. Only his millions and millions of dollars to... That's it! We're saved! Ohhoho. What a plan! Ah, yes! Uh, paper! Paper! Whoo, it's so great. Dear Mr. Rich... Ah! Mr. Very Rich. Bye, Jenny! Oliver! Oliver? Oliver! Feel it. That's it. Very good.  Oliver! Oliver! Two, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, you love it!  Oliver, I'm home. That's funny. Georgette, help me find Oliver. Oliver! Oliver! Oh, where could he be? Oliver? He's not here. Where is he? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Hmm. ""Dear Mr. Very Rich Catowner Person."" Whoops. ""And if you don't bring the money, ""you'll never see your cat again."" Oh, no. Georgette, something terrible has happened. They've kidnapped Oliver. Oh, Georgette, you loved him too. Don't worry. We're going to get him back. This is an airtight plan, Sykes. Sweet and simple.  I ransom the kitty, and you get paid in full tomorrow. I'll even toss in a little extra for your patience. Whaddya say? It's my final offer. Take it or leave it. Yeah, Who is it'? Oh... Fagin, it's you. Why didn't you say so? Oh! Good question.  But listen, if you're busy, we can drop by some other time.  Don't be silly. Just push the door. I said, push!  Ooh! What do you mean? You start with the knuckles. Ahh, Fagin. Do come in. I'll be right with you. Yeah. No, you don't kill him yet. Huh? Yeah. And then, what's the last thing you do? You put on the cement shoes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Come on. Hey, don't worry about it. So, Fagin. Did we bring something green and wrinkly to make me happy? Sykes, I've got an airtight kitty... Plan... Plan! It's sweet and simple, the plan. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Let's just take this from the top. What am I gonna do with you, Fagin? I've got this kitty, you see... Fagin. You don't got the money. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Stop! Please, Sykes, please! Sykes, I'm getting your money tonight! It's coming tonight! Please. It's from a rich cat... No, I mean, a cat from a rich family's paying... Ow! They're coming tonight with the money I owe you, uh, to get the cat back! ******************** Hey, I think there's hope for you yet. Ohho! I'm proud of ya, Fagin. Yeah, you're startin' to think big. You've got 12 hours. And, Fagin? This is your last chance. Turn left, right when you get to the big propeller. Oh, Georgette, I can't read this. No, that... No, that's not right. It's left. Oh, Georgette, where are we? I think we're lost. Stick close, Georgette. It's creepy down here. He's late. I drew a perfectly good map. Well, there was a few smudges on it, okay. I went outside the line with the green crayon, but not that much. Oh, Dodge. A child could read that map. Hey, Rita, they never laid a paw on me. Ooh, wait. What if he comes and he's huge and mean? Excuse me, sir. It's the FBI! I didn't do it! I didn't do it! I was framed! Ohhoho! Whaa... Listen, little girl, this is a tough neighborhood. You'd better go home. Ugh! I can't. I'm lost. Aw, gee. Lost. Well. I'd help you, but I'm kind of busy right now. What're you doin' down here anyway? I came to find my kitty. Your kitty? Somebody stole him. But... But, uh, are you sure? Maybe you made a mistake. No. No, somebody stole him and sent me this note. Easy, boys. See? Now I'm lost. Look. I even brought this to get him back. Ohhohohohoo! You brought a piggy bank. That's all I have. That's awful. I know. And what kind of a person would steal a poor little kitty? But I... I mean, maybe he... Maybe he was up against the wall, at the end of his rope. He must have been a poor, desperate man. It's still wrong! I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Neither do I! Hey! Guess what? I found a little lost kitten. I don't know, take a look. Maybe he's yours. Oliver! Oliver! Oh, my Oliver! Sykes. Sykes! I was gonna... Yaaah! Hey! Hey, wait! What're you doing? Let go! No! No, wait! You can't do this!

The Black Cauldrion,Disney,1980,1985,Animation,"Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain,  there was once a king so cruel and so evil  that even the gods feared him.  Since no prison could hold him,  he was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron.  There, his demonic spirit was captured  in the form of a great black cauldron.  For uncounted centuries,  the Black Cauldron lay hidden, waiting,  while evil men searched for it,  knowing whoever possessed it would have the power  to resurrect an army of deathless warriors  and, with them, rule the world.  There's something wrong. I can feel it in my bones. And the Fairfolk know it, too. You don't see any of them around. The Horned King, that blackhearted devil, what's he waiting for? Yes, yes, cat. I know you want your breakfast, but just now thinking is more important. Taran! The pot is boiling over, Taran! Oh, Dallben. I was just thinking. What if the war's over, and I never had a chance to fight? And a good thing, too. War isn't a game. People get hurt. But I'm not afraid. Ouch! Yes, there you are. If the Horned King ever returns, you'll have a great deal more to worry about than a burned finger. No, no, no, cat. That is not for you. It's for Hen Wen. Hen Wen, Hen Wen. It's always Hen Wen. And one day, my boy, you may learn why. Now, no more dreaming. You have chores to do. Yes, sir. He's so anxious and so blind to the dangers ahead. Look! Look, cat. You're in luck. Just enough left for you. Dallben doesn't understand. I'm not a little boy any more. I should be doing heroic deeds for Prydain, not waiting hand and foot on a spoiled... Hey! Oh, all right, Hen. I didn't mean it. You'd better eat it. Dallben made it especially for you. Is this to be my life? Pampering a pig? I'm a warrior, not a pig keeper. Dallben thinks I'd be afraid, but I wouldn't. All I need is a chance, and I could be a famous warrior. Look at me, Hen! I can do it! Hah! Even you're afraid. Do you challenge me? Run, you cowards. There you are. His Majesty, the Horned King. So we meet at last. Hah! Even the Horned King shakes with fear. See, Hen? Everybody runs from the famous Taran of Caer Dallben! Prydain's finest warrior draws his last breath. Dallben. Hmm. Not quite the blade for a hero. I was... It's just that we were... Hen Wen got dirty. Oh, I see. Another dream, Taran? But, Dallben, won't I ever be anything but an assistant pig keeper? She's a special pig, Taran. Now, give her a nice bath. Well, Hen, it looks as though I'll still be an assistant pig keeper when I'm as old as Dallben. You like that, don't you? Now for the part you like best. Hey, come on, Hen. I haven't finished scrubbing your... Hen, what's the matter? Calm down, Hen. Stop it, please! What's the matter? Hen Wen... Taran, what's going on? I don't know. There's something wrong with Hen Wen. What? Quickly, lad, bring her inside. What's that for? Put Hen Wen down. I never use her powers unless I have to, but now I must. Powers? Taran, what you are about to see, you must never reveal to anyone. Hen Wen, from you I do beseech knowledge that lies beyond my reach, troubled thoughts beyond your heart. Pray you now those thoughts impart. Ah, the Horned King. Don't interfere. He is searching. The Black Cauldron! So that's it. The Black Cauldron? An awesome weapon, Taran. It's been hidden for centuries, but if the Horned King should find it and unleash its power, nothing could stand against him. That's Hen Wen. He knows. Stop! Enough! You must leave here at once. Take Hen Wen to the hidden cottage at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Hide there and never bring her out until I come for you. Hide? But why? Only I knew the secret of Hen Wen's power, but now the Horned King has discovered it. We must make sure he never uses it to find the Black Cauldron. I'm not afraid of the Horned King. Then you are a very foolish lad. Untried courage is no match for his evil. Just remember that. Now, off you go, my boy, and take care of yourself. Goodbye, Dallben. I won't fail you. So much, so soon, to rest on his young shoulders. Oh, yes. Yes, my soldiers. Soon the Black Cauldron will be mine. Its evil power will course through my veins, and I shall make you CauldronBorn. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Then you will worship me! Me. Oh, my soldiers. How long I have thirsted to be a god among mortal men. Gosh, Hen Wen, I never knew you could create visions and things like that. I thought you were just an ordinary pig. I had no idea you were so special. Dallben's going to be glad that he put his trust in me. Just you wait and see. Now, don't go wandering about. And don't you worry. Keep close to me and no one will do you any harm, not while I'm around. And I won't let the Horned King get close to you, Hen. I'll protect you. Taran of Caer Dallben,  the greatest warrior in all Prydain,  a true hero!  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. But without the help of my pig, Hen Wen, here, I... Hen Wen, where are you? Hen Wen? Oh, no! Hen? Hen Wen! Is that you, Hen? Look what I've got. Come on out. Here's a lovely, juicy... Oh, great prince, give poor, starving Gurgi munchings and crunchings. Nice apple. Good prince. Good apple. Oh, boy, what a juicy apple. Hey! No, you don't. I didn't give you that apple. You took it. Ow! Hey, hold on, you hairy little thief. Come back with my apple! If you don't give it back, you'll be sorry. I mean it. I'm warning you. Give it back. Come on. The apple. Where is it? Gurgi not know where the... Uhoh. Give it back. I warn you. Come on. Come on, the apple. Let's have it. You horrible, greedy thing. You should be ashamed of yourself. Oh, poor, miserable Gurgi deserves fierce smackings and whackings on his poor, tender head. Always left with no munchings and crunchings. Forgive poor Gurgi. Oh, stop that sniveling. I'm not going to hurt you. Now, look here. Have you seen my pig? Piggy? Round, fat piggy? Big snout? Yes, yes. Curly tail? That's her. That's Hen Wen. Nope. Gurgi not see piggy. Nope. Oh, never mind. No telling where Hen Wen is by now. Oh, master, master, now Gurgi remembers! Yes, yes! Clever, sharpeyed Gurgi saw the piggy run. Yes, right through the forest. I saw it. I saw it. Come! Gurgi will find the lost piggy. Then we'll be friends forever. Munchings and crunchings in here somewhere. It's Hen Wen! She's in trouble! Goodbye. Hen Wen! Hen! Hen Wen! Hen Wen, look out! Look out! Come on! Hurry, Hen! No! No! Hen, hurry! No! No! No! No! No! Come back! Please! No! No! Come back! Hen Wen. I must get her out of there. Oh, no, great lord. Not go in there. Forget the piggy. What are you doing here? Gurgi come back to be your friend. Friend? You're no friend! Why, you ran away when I... Oh, never mind. I promised Dallben I would keep Hen safe. I have to go. Well, are you coming? Me? Go in there? Oh, no, no, no. It's a terrible place. Just as I thought. You're no friend. You're just a miserable coward. Here. This is all you wanted. If great lord go into evil castle, poor Gurgi will never see his friend again. No, never. Shut up, you thickskulled dolt. Always barking at nothing. All right, might as well make our rounds. Here's to everybody! More wine and meat for my men! And more women. Quiet. I'm trying to sleep. What about a kiss, eh, princess? Gads, you're a lovely one! Come on! Here. Keep your hands off, you little creeper. Going somewhere, Creeper? Kiss me, love, and I'll die with a smile on my face. Welcome, Your Majesty. We're just celebrating our success. I mean your success. We've made no mistakes this time. Bring in the prisoner! Oh, no. There, sire. This is the pig that creates visions. All right, pig, show His Majesty where the Black Cauldron can be found. Go on! Show it! Stubborn little thing, isn't she? Why, yes, sire. You're quite right. I'll take care of it at once. The Black Cauldron. Where is it? Show us, swine! I warn you, the King's patience is short. No, no! No! Get him! The sneaking, nogood... Get back, or I'll... Oh. Release him. What? Here. Hen Wen. Oh, Hen Wen. There, there. I presume, my boy, you are the keeper of this oracular pig. Yes, sir. Then instruct her to show me the whereabouts of the Black Cauldron. Oh, sir, I can't. I promised. Very well. In that case, the pig is no use to me. What are you going to do? No! You can't! Don't! No! Stop! I'll make her tell you. That's better. Now, get on with the vision, pig. Hen Wen, from you I do beseech knowledge that lies beyond my reach. Look! Look, sire! It's working! Ah, yes. The Black Cauldron. So it does exist. Go on. Yes, yes. Where is it? Show me. Show me. Come on, Hen! After them! Get them! After them! Gotcha, pig boy! The moat. It's our only chance. Come on, Hen. Swim, Hen! Swim! I'm coming. Gotcha, pig boy! I caught him, Your Majesty! I caught the boy. But you let the pig go, didn't you? It wasn't my fault. Throw the boy into the dungeon. You must make sure he never uses Hen Wen  to find the Black Cauldron.  I won't fail you, Dallben.  Look at me, Hen! I can do it!  I can do it. I can do it. I thought I heard a noise in here. Oh! Was that you? Yeah. Yes. You're being held a prisoner, aren't you? Yes. I'm being held against my will, too. It lights up. Why, of course. It's magic. Oh, I hate this place. I do hope there aren't any rats in here. Not that I really mind them, you know, but they do jump out at one so. I'm Princess Eilonwy. Are you a lord or a warrior? No. I'm an assistant pig keeper. Oh, what a pity. I was so hoping for someone who could help me escape. Oh, well. If you want to come with me, you may. Can I? Well, yes. I said you could. Oh, that wicked, wicked king. You know, he stole me. He thought my bauble could tell him where some old cauldron was. That's what he wanted my pig for. Oh, yes, your pig. But my pig can tell the future. Oh, how interesting. Well, you'd better stay close to me, or you'll get lost. Your bauble! Oh, it's always chasing those rats. A burial chamber. This could be the tomb of the great king who built this castle before the Horned King took it over. Are you all right? Well, come on, then. Help me look around. He must have been a great warrior. A sword! This will please him. It's a good lot this time. Hurry! In with it! Finally. He'll reward me for this. Don't stop, you weakling! Put some muscle into it. Let's get out of here before they come back. Where did you get that sword? Back there. You mean... Well, he's not going to use it. You're making a horrendous mistake. I'm not a spy! I'm a bard! I sing. I entertain. I... Careful, sir. These are the hands of an artist. This'll hold you. Now, look. You seem an intelligent sort of chap to me. I assure you I had no idea who owned this castle. I just happened to be passing. Oh, he's nice, isn't he? What's his name? No! Down, boy! Come on. You don't realize who I am. I shall sing of your dastardly deed. I'm Fflewddur Fflam, minstrel of minstrels, balladeer to the grandest courts in all the land! And I... Well, have you forgotten? I have sung in some of the finest courts. Well, I'm only waiting for an invitation. Oh, shush. Why do you have to judge every word I say? Who's that? Help! Oh, hello. We'll have you untied in a moment. I'm Princess Eilonwy and you're in bad trouble, aren't you? ""Trouble""? Don't you know where you are? Haven't you seen him? Pig boy has escaped. Look in there. We've been discovered. That's you? Oh, great Belin, run! Run! Make haste! ""Make haste""? I must save myself. I think he went through the passage. All right, let's try down here. Princess? Princess Eilonwy? Pig boy! You little scut! No, no, no. Are you all right? Oh, good. You're safe. Why, of course. I... Come on. I'm going to get you out of here. Aah! There they are. Quick! Up here. Taran, the sword. Great Belin! Help! Murder! Keep going, Princess. There he is! There he is! Over there! Stop him! Taran! There they are. Come on! Get them! Oh, no! Taran! We've got you now, pig boy. Taran, do something! Use the sword! Make way! Make way! Stand aside, I command you. Get out from under my feet! Let me go, you brute! Run, Princess! Run! Stay up! Please stay up! Why didn't you tell me you had a magic sword? I'll say it wasn't my fault. That's it. That's it. I always get blamed for these things. I'll just tell him, and if he gets mad... I'll just straighten him out. That's it. I'm not going to be kicked around for this. Sire? You bring news of the pig? No, not exactly, sire. It's... Oh, it's the pig keeper. He's... Oh, he's... He's escaped. Oh, sire! Allow me. Isn't that enough? Good. He'll find his pig. Send the gwythaints to follow that boy. Oh, yes, sire! Oh, yes! By all means, sire! * The world will applaud me  * Its praise will reward me  * And I, Fflewddur Fflam, will find fame *  They're almost finished, Fflewddur. It's not too good, but it'll hold for a while. Yes, I shall sing of your deed. It would be better to sing of our heroic escape. Weren't you a bit frightened, Fflewddur? A Fflam, frightened? The word is not in my vocabulary. But in this case, wellchosen, my dear. I wasn't afraid. Ouch! Not afraid? Why, we were running for our lives. Well, I got us out of the castle, didn't I? You? I'd say it was the sword's magic. But it takes a great warrior to handle a sword like this. But still, it is a magic sword. What does a girl know about swords, anyway? Girl? Girl? If it weren't for this girl, you would still be in the Horned King's dungeon. Here now, Princess Eilonwy, Taran... At least I don't keep talking about it forever. Oh, you're so boring! Princess Eilonwy... How dare you take his side? I really didn't... I didn't mean to interfere, you know. Silly girl. Even if she is a princess. But we're going to have to... To... Dear, oh, dear. Hello. Hello. Fflewddur is right, you know. We are going to have to work together. And we'll find your pig. I'm sure it's important. Thank you for getting me out of the dungeon. Oh, but we couldn't have done it without you. Well, at least we're all safe. Great Belin! Fflewddur! Help! Murder! Hurry! Gurgi's lucky day. Get this thing off me. Wow. Yes, keep it! It's a gift! Want this. Gurgi want this. Go ahead. I'm sure you've murdered for less. Want. Gurgi want! Gurgi. Master? Oh, old man fell down. Get up. Get up. Well, really. Who is your pungent little friend? He's no friend of mine. He's just a coward and a thief. Too big anyway. You're charming. And pungent, too. Well, what are you waiting for? Yes, yes. Exactly. Now toddle off, toddle off. Gurgi go. Tracks? Tracks! Gurgi remember. Saw piggy's tracks. You did? Today! Today? Wait a minute. He'll try anything. Oh, you're both horrid. He just might know. Pretty lady come, too? Well, I... Yes, yes, yes! Follow Gurgi! Follow Gurgi! You better be telling the truth. Gurgi not lie, not this time. See, master? Piggy's footsteps. No lie. Oh, good. They look fresh. Oh, master. Master! Gurgi, hold on! Oh, no! Taran! Give me your hand. We're doomed! Uhoh. How did they get in here? Old Doli's whirlpool broke again. I bet they wake up soon. We better tell King Eidilleg. No, silly. You know we're not supposed to be up here. Uhoh. We're all gonna be in trouble. Not me. Me, either. Uhoh. Oh, yes. I see you fixed that. Yep. When I get this last peg in here, I'll be finished. Good. Yes, that should work. It's perfect. Grab that pole! I got it! Oh, aren't you all darling? Hello. I'm King Eidilleg of the Fairfolk. How the blazes did they... I thought I told you to fix the whirlpool. I fixed it. I did fix it! It was perfect! Evidently, not completely perfect. It's supposed to keep them out. Can I be of any service? Is everything that happens around here my fault? Are you here on a friendly visit? And I suppose it's my fault the pig's here, too? Hen Wen? Oh, she's your pig? Oh, good. One less thing for old Doli to worry about. Doli. What now? Would you hurry and fetch the pig? Hey, you kids, what are you doing? Oh, Mr. Doli, I just wanna see the pretty lady. Well, now, you watch yourselves, hear? I can't believe my eyes, Your Majesty. Watch it. Watch it! Oh, Hen! Thank goodness you're... Tell me, is the burning and killing still going on up there? You refer to that joke on humanity, the Horned King. Will no one ever stand up to him? We've seen him, and if he finds the Cauldron, he'll kill us all. Oh, no, no. He'll never find it. No, no. It's safely hidden in Morva. Morva? Well, at least I think it is. Oh, Doli, is it? Really? Is that one of my new jobs, remembering where the Cauldron was last seen? Gee! Oh, he'll know right where it is. You'll see. If we could get to the Cauldron first and destroy it... Oh, this isn't right, Taran. But don't you see? If we destroy the Cauldron, it will stop the Horned King. Please, come with me. Wait, I never thought... Morva. That's a hard place to get to. Yep. Why, you can take them. What? Do you mean we're trusting our lives to him? And what is wrong with me? Oh, nothing. Splendid choice. Shall we, then? Wait! Hen Wen! Oh, don't worry. We'll get her home safely. Oh, thank you, sir. Be good, Hen. Well, if it's the Marshes of Morva you wanted, here you are. Such a dreary place. Let's see what it looks like from up here. I think we're lost. Are you sure this is the right place, Doli? Yes, I'm sure. Well, if you ask me... Fflewddur! Doli! Are you all right? Hey, look out, you big, clumsy oaf! Look where you... Uhoh. Welcome to Morva. Well, someone must live here. Gurgi not like this place. No. It seems empty. Maybe we should have a look. If I can just get this door open... How will we ever find the Black Cauldron in a place like this? It must be here somewhere. They're only frogs, Eilonwy. Those were people. You mean they were turned into frogs? Oh, master, come quickly. Gurgi found the wicked Cauldron. Quick, quick, quick! Follow Gurgi! Behold, master. The whole room is full of cauldrons. I don't understand. Why would anyone want so many... Thieves! Thieves! Someone stole all our frogs. You evil, nasty people. You shall all be turned into frogs and eaten. Nice and tender. Stop that, you... You... Oh. So nice to meet you, ladies. Goodbye. Aah! Wait. My, aren't you the handsome one? Who? Me? Oh, honestly, now, don't you find me irresistible? Yes. Well, of course, most attractive. Shush! Stop that. You don't mind if I pluck your harp, do you, handsome? Enough of that lovesick nonsense. Great Belin! Quick! We're going to have toad stew. You're not gonna eat this one. Come here, love. Can anyone here perform marriages? Marriages? You lovestruck witch! Where is he? Where'd he go? Yoohoo! Where are you? Don't go. Now look what you've done. He's gone! I'll never forgive you for this, Orgoch, never! Ooh! There you are. Enough! We've come for the Black Cauldron. Did you hear that, sisters? Why, nobody's asked for the Black Cauldron in over 2,000 years. It's a trick. We're not going to let them have it, are we? Don't worry. Leave it to me. Perhaps I might interest you in something else? A kettle, a cook pot, a skillet, a teapot, a bucket, a jar, a platter? See anything you like? I don't believe it. I've never seen a sword like that. I've got to have that sword. Listen carefully. We'll trade the Cauldron for the sword. But what can they do with the Cauldron, Orddu? Nothing! That's the point. Don't you see? We'll end up with both the sword and the Cauldron. It's decided, then. You shall have the Black Cauldron. You mean you'll give it to us? That's not what I said. You weren't listening. We never give anything away. What we do is bargain, trade. Well, you'll not have my sword! May I ask you ladies to perhaps consider this magnificent harp? A harp? Oh, when we want music, we send for the birds. What would we do with a simple harp? Wait! Gurgi will trade his crunchings and munchings. Who would want... Hold it, sister. Not so fast. All right. I know what you want. Yes? No, Taran! No! It's our only chance. Here is my sword. Take it. Is it your own choice, duckling? Remember, with this sword, you could be the greatest of warriors. Yes. I offer my dearest possession in exchange for the Black Cauldron. Agreed. We have made a bargain. Look out! Help! Taran, watch out! Great Belin! Duck! Look! The Black Cauldron. It's ours! I say, what funny little ducklings. Don't they know the Black Cauldron is indestructible? Now listen carefully. The Black Cauldron can never be destroyed. Only its evil powers can be stopped. Then there is a way. But how? A living being must climb into it of his own free will. Gurgi is bold and brave. He will climb into the evil Cauldron. However, the poor duckling will never climb out alive. Yikes! Now, look here, madam. Don't forget we had an agreement. Yes. You said we could have the Cauldron. Of course we said you could have the Cauldron. It's not our fault you can't do anything with it. Goodbye, goslings.  Remember, we always keep a bargain.  What a bunch of blundering misfits! Things just never work out when you're dealing with people. You can go back to feeding pigs. I've had it. Goodbye. Doli's right. It's my fault. I let you down. Without my sword, I'm nothing, just an assistant pig keeper. Look, you are somebody. You must believe in yourself. I believe in you. You do? And I think that you're... I mean... That is... Yes, Taran? I mean... What I mean is, I'm grateful to all of you. You've been true friends. Now it's up to me... Look! Trouble. Goodbye. Quick! We can't let them find us. Pig boy! Fight where you are, pig boy. Gotcha. Gotcha now, pig boy. Get a move on! Careful, now. You! Pile them up over there! And get that cart out of here! Oh, I'm sorry. I've ignored you. You did come for the Black Cauldron, didn't you? Good. Then climb in! It will only cost you your life. Oh. Oh! Everything is ready, sire. My, such a brave and handsome group: a pig boy, a scullery maid and a brokendown minstrel. Perhaps it may interest you to see what fate has in store for you. Now I call on my army of the dead, the CauldronBorn. Arise, my messengers of death. Our time has arrived. Oh, it's horrible. My beloved warriors have come to life, all the dead of centuries past. Never has anyone created an army like this. Go forth, my deathless warriors. Destroy all in your path. Come, sire. We can get a better view from above. Oh, Taran. I'm afraid it'll soon be over for us. I hadn't planned it to end like this, Eilonwy. Oh, I wish I'd stayed a toad. Only moments away from victory, my greatest triumph. We did it, sire! We did it! Oh, I mean you. Yes, of course. You did it, sire. Yikes! Gurgi? Gurgi? Is that you? Master! Gurgi, what are you doing here? Gurgi is sorry he always runs away when there's trouble. He will untie everybody, then we will leave this evil place. Yeah, but get on with it. Good boy, Gurgi. Eilonwy, you and Fflewddur go with Gurgi. I must stop the Cauldron. Oh, but, Taran, that's impossible. Why, you'd be... Taran! I'm sorry, Eilonwy. Please, Taran. No! You can't! My mind is made up. Wait, master! Gurgi not let you jump into Cauldron. Gurgi, get out of my way. Whoa! Whoa! Please, master, not go into evil Cauldron. If I don't, we're all lost. Out of my way! No, Gurgi not let his friend die. Taran has many friends. Gurgi has no friends. Gurgi, no! Don't jump! Wait! No! No! Oh, no. Sire? Sire, look. Something's wrong. What is it, sire? They're dying! It can't be. This had better not be your fault. Perhaps it needs another body, sire. Yes, yours. Get Eilonwy out of here. Hurry! But, Taran, I... Please, I... Go on! Go with Fflewddur. Maybe there's still a chance for Gurgi. Aah! No, sire! Please! Get up! Come alive! Maybe they're only resting, sire. Do something! My life is at stake! Get up, you fools! Kill! Look! Sire, look! It's the pig boy. It's his fault. Yes. He's the cause of it! You've interfered for the last time. Go for his throat, sire. Now, pig keeper, you shall die. No! No! What? What's this? No, you'll not escape. You shall satisfy the Cauldron's hunger. Oh, no! No! You'll not have me! My power cannot die! Curse you! No! No! Oh, no. How horrible. Poor sire. He's gone. He's gone! He's gone! He's gone! Fflewddur! Eilonwy! Over here! Hurry! Thank goodness you're safe. Come on, Fflewddur. Hurry! Run for your lives! Come on. Jump. Taran, look! Quick. Get in. Let's go. Here. Push off, Fflewddur. Uhoh. Trouble. Oh, we can't get through. I'll try to open the gate. Taran, be careful, please. Hurry! Move on through. Come on, Fflewddur. Hurry! Oh, good work, lad. Here, let me give you... Look out! Look. Gurgi. Gurgi. Why is the poor duckling so sad? Yes. He's got what he wanted, and he's still not satisfied. Just what do you think you're up to, ladies? Oh, we have business with your little hero. Hero? Gurgi was the hero. The only thing that mattered to you was the Cauldron, but now it's no use to you, so we'll just take it and be on our way. Wait... But... Wait a minute. Stay your hand, ladies. We never give anything away. We bargain. We trade. Remember? Did these old ears hear the word ""bargain""? Yes, madam, those old ears heard right. I adore forceful men. Oh, pull yourself together, madam. Now, come on, out with it. What is your offer? No, not my... Then I'll do it. A magnificent sword for a warrior. I'm not a warrior. I'm a pig boy. What would I do with a sword? Absolutely nothing. But I would trade... Yes? The Cauldron for Gurgi. Oh, dear! It's not possible. Just as I thought, ladies. You've got no real power! Admit it! Admit it! We have made a bargain.  Oh, Taran. Munchings and crunchings in here somewhere. Gurgi! You're alive! He's alive! Great Belin, he is alive. Oh, Fflewddur, Fflewddur, he's alive! I'm alive! Gurgi's alive! Look, look, look! Touch me! Gurgi, you clever little thing. Come on, Gurgi, let's go home. Gurgi's happy day! Come on. Great Belin! You did well, my boy. Yep."

Youre such a little toddler. Say, thats what Im going to call you. Tod. You know, Tod, Im not going to be so lonesome anymore. I got a surprise for you, Chief, old boy. Now, now, now, take it easy. Well, hows this for a huntin dog? Hes just a little runt now, but hell grow. You may as well get used to him, Chief. Hes for you to look after from now on. Tod, stop pestering Abigail. Abigail, youre going to have to be patient with Tod. Hes one of the family now. Oh, of course. Now I know. I declare, I never will get my chores done. Oh, mercy! Tod! Tod, stop it! Abigail! Abigail! Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no! Easy, easy, Abigail. Steady, old girl. Steady. There, there. Tod, you come here. I said come here! Just look what youve done. Now, dont try to butter me up. Oh, Tod, I just cant stay angry with you. You little imp. Now run along and play. Go on. And try to stay out of mischief. Hey, its Dinky and Boomer. Maybe they wanna play. Is this it, Boomer? Sure, Dinky. This is the place. I never forget a tree. I never forget a tree. He wont get away this time. Hold it, Boomer. I think I hear somethin. Thats him, all right, Dinky. Thats him, all right. Get ready, Boomer. Hey, I can hear him movin. Listen. Thats funny. I dont hear nothin. Quiet. Thats him, Dinky. Thats him, all right. Button your beak, will ya? Ill check it out. Would you look at that? OK, Boomer, hes right... there. Yikes! Watch it! Why, you... Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him! Hiya, fellas. What ya doin?

This way. There he is! What happened to ya? Golly! Oh, shucks! I think I bent my beak. Now see what you done? You cost us our breakfast. I cost us our breakfast? It was your fault. What are you talkin, my fault? Yeah, yeah. A worm? For breakfast? Hey, there, Copper, what ya sniffin at? Somethin... I never smelled... ... before, Chief. Let me see. Shucks, thats easy. The masters just cookin grits and fatback. You oughta know that. Thats not what I smell. I dont know, Chief. Its something else. Sonny, you got a lot of learnin to do about asniffin and asmellin. Hey, where you goin? I want to find out what that smell is. OK, Copper, but the master aint gonna like you wanderin off. I wont get lost, Chief. I can smell my way back. Cant tell these young whippersnappers anything. What ya smellin? Im on the trail of somethin. Trail of what? I dont know yet. Why, its... its you! What do you do that for? Were supposed to do that when we find what weve been trackin. Im a fox. My names Tod. Whats your name, kid? Mines Copper. Im a hound dog. Gee, I bet youd be good playin hideandseek. Wanna try it, Copper? Can I use my nose? Sure. OK. Now go ahead and close your eyes and count. One, two, three... No, Copper! You cant peek! Now start again. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... My, my. Look at that. A fox and a hound, playin together. When youre the best of friends Having so much fun together Youre not even aware youre such a funny pair Youre the best of friends Lifes a happy game You could clown around forever Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries Lifes one happy game Copper! Gee, Ive gotta go. If only the world wouldnt get in the way If only people would just let you play They say youre both being fools Youre breaking all the rules They cant understand The magic of your wonderland When youre the best of friends Copper! Sharing all that you discover When these moments have passed Will that friendship last? Who can say? Theres a way Oh, I hope I hope it never ends Come on, Copper! Cause youre the best of friends Copper, youre my very best friend. And youre mine too, Tod. And well always be friends forever, wont we? Yeah, forever. Hey, lets go swimmin! Give me a head start and I can beat ya! Dagnabit! That Copper pups gone and strayed off again. Come on, Chief. If that little rascals gonna make me a good huntin dog, hes gotta learn to mind. Copper! Get over here! Copper! I gotta go home. Do ya have to? Were havin too much fun. I gotta. He sounds awful mad. Ill see ya tomorrow! And dont forget! I wont! Hey, Copper, what happened to ya? Why didnt you...? Golly! Youre all tied up. Yeah, and its no fun either. The master says I gotta stay home. Well, we can play around here then. Oh, no. Not with old Chief over there. Is that him making that awful noise? He keeps me awake at night. Oh, dont go in there! He can get awful mean! Hes cranky. Geewhillikers, is he ever big. His ears isnt as big as yours, Copper. Thats not the part you gotta worry about. Wow! Look at those teeth. Thats the part you gotta worry about! Im gainin on him. He wont get away now. Hes wakin up! Get out, Tod! No. Hes havin a dream. Hes chasin somethin. When I get him cornered... Its... Its... Its a big old badger. Copper, hes chasin a badger. No, no, it aint a badger. Its a... Its a f... Its a fox. A fox? Run, Tod! Run! Tod! Amos Slade, you triggerhappy lunatic! Give me that gun! My radiator! Why, you blasted female. Ill... Ill... Hold it right there! Watch it! That things loaded! Now it aint loaded! Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin fox was after my chickens! Rubbish and poppycock! I dont believe it. He wouldnt hurt a thing. You callin me a liar, you muddleheaded female? I saw it happen! Amos Slade, that temper of yours is going to get you into a lot of trouble. Temper? Temper, woman? You aint seen my temper! If I ever catch that fox on my property again, Ill blast him! And next time, I wont miss! Poor little tyke. Its a shame I have to keep him cooped up. Tod, stop looking at me like that. Its not my fault, you know. You caused a lot of trouble yesterday. Oh, now what are they up to? Why, it looks like Amos is going on a hunting trip. A long one, from the looks of it. Well, good riddance! Doggone meddlin female, shootin up my radiator! Dad blame it. Get goin! There. Well, thats more like it. Keep runnin, old girl. Well, Copper, me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin. Yes, sir. Its about time too. Attaboy. Yeah, youre gonna like trackin down those varmints for me. Get in the back, halfpint. You gotta earn your right to sit up front. Well, boys, were gettin outta here till next spring. Tod, honey, what are you doin over here? Gee, I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper, but Im too late. Well, what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief? Chief. I can outfox that dumb old dog anytime. Tod, now hold it just one minute. Didnt you learn anything yesterday? Now you listen good, Tod, because its either education or elimination. Now if youre so foxy and old Chiefs so dumb, then why does that hound get the fox on the run? Cause hes got the hunter, and the hunters got the gun. Elimination. Lack of education. If you pal around with that Copper hound Youll wind up hangin on the wall Keep your nose to the wind Youll keep your skin Cause you wont be home when the hunter comes to call Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper would never track me down. Why, old Copper, hes my best friend. Your best friend. Now, Coppers gonna do what hes been told. Supposed to chase the little old fox into the old foxhole, then along comes the hunter with a buckshot load. Elimination. Lack of education. You better believe it, Tod. Yes, sirree! You mean Copper is gonna be my enemy? Hey! Kid, you better step over here and take a good look. Why... Why, thats awful. Those poor things. Im sorry, Tod. Honey, Coppers gonna come back a trained huntin dog. A real killer. Oh, no, not my friend Copper. He wont ever change. I hope youre right, Tod. And well keep on being friends forever. Wont we, Big Mama? Darlin, forever is a long, long time, and time has a way of changin things. Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold. Im freezin my b... Hey! Its that fuzzy worm! Lets get him! Charge! Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here! I got him! I got him! Do I look like a worm? Thats who were after. Come on! Look at that little creep, warm and cosy by the fire. Let me take a look. Now how do you like that guy? Snug as a bug, while were out here freezin our beaks off. Yackin and shiverin aint gettin us anywhere. Well get that nogood worm when we come back. Oh, shucks. So long, Big Mama. Yeah, were goin south for the winter. Goodbye, boys. See ya next spring. Well, look whos here. Oh, my goodness. Im sorry, Tod, honey. I hope... Hiya, Big Mama. Were back. We flew all the way. Yeah, we did. We did. Welcome home, boys! Its been kind of lonesome around here without you little rascals. Hi, fellas! Hey, whos that? Whos that? This cant be that scrawny little squirt we found by the fence post, can it? Come on. I cant believe my eyes. Oh, its me, all right. Hey, looky there. Hes got himself a real fancy collar. Hey, hey, hey. Just look at this bushy tail. Beautiful. Come on. Cut it out. You guys are always teasin me. Hey, its him, its him. Squeeks. Well see ya later, kid. We gotta take care of some unfinished business. I cant understand. It was so healthy. There. That oughta perk it up. Now, whered he go? Whered he go? Hes goin up the drainpipe! Ill head him off. OK, Boomer, we got him trapped! Let him have it! Did you get him? No, I didnt. Neither did l. Come on! Look! A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy! Holy! Smoke! Hey, hey, hows he do that, Dinky? Hows he do that? I aint got no job Im a huntin man And Id rather have a dog than a dollar So lets go banjo ringalingadingho Give a little hoot and a holler Come on, Chief. Just cause youre not sittin up front, that aint no reason to be a sorehead. Shucks, if it werent for you, Copperd never have turned into a good huntin dog. Yes, sirree. Now I got me the best two dogs there is. Right, Copper? Isnt he somethin, Chief? Look, Big Mama! Coppers back! Boy, has he grown big. And look at that big pile of skins he helped track down. I know, Big Mama. Hes a huntin dog now. Youre right. And youre a fox. That wont make any difference. Coppers gonna be glad to see me. Well, honey, just dont get your hopes too high. Look, dont worry. Ill be careful. Ill go tonight when Chief and the hunter are asleep. Boy, its great to be back home, isnt it, Chief? Come on, Chief. You arent still sore, are ya? Hey, hey, come on. Lets scuffle. We aint scuffled in a long time. Come on, Chief! Lets have some fun! Oh, lay off, Copper, you overgrown pup, you. Oh, let go! Dagnabit! Let go, I say! Oh, OK, OK. That was your trouble on the hunt. Come on, oldtimer. You treat me like a pup, you know that? Why, I think I done real good trackin down them varmints for ya. Smellin and trackin aint enough. You gotta think nasty. OK, OK, I know. I know. Copper. Hey, Copper. Its me, Tod. I thought that was you, Tod. I heard ya comin. Boy, youve really grown. You have too, Copper. I saw you comin back with Chief and the hunter. Its great to see ya, Tod. But, you know, you... You shouldnt be over here. Youre gonna get us both into a lot of trouble. Hey, look, l... I just wanted to see ya. Were... Were still friends, arent we? Tod, those days are over. Im a huntin dog now. Youd better get outta here before old Chief wakes up. Chief. He doesnt worry me. Tod, Im serious. Youre... Youre fair game as far as hes concerned. Its that fox again! Oh, no! No! Theyre after Tod! After him, boys! Go get him! Copper! Copper! Copper! Tod, I... I dont wanna see you get killed. Track him down, boy! Ill let you go this one time. Dont lose him! There they are! Old Chiefs got him on the run! Jump, Chief! Jump! Chief! Chief? Oh, no! No! Tod, if its the last thing I do, Ill... Ill get you for this! Tod! Tod? Tod! Oh, Tod! Thank heaven youre safe. Oh, poor Chief. And its all my fault. I shouldnt have let Tod go. Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up! Theres trouble! Tod! Well, what is it? What on earth? Widow, get out here! Why, Amos! What are you...? Where is he? Where is he? I know hes in there. Now just a minute. You cant come bargin onto my property, Amos Slade! That fox of yours almost killed Chief, and Im gonna get him! You cant keep him locked up forever! We met, it seems Such a short time ago You looked at me Needing me so Yet from your sadness Our happiness grew And I found out I needed you too I remember how we used to play I recall those rainy days The fires glow That kept us warm And now I find Were both alone Goodbye may seem forever Farewell is like the end But in my hearts the memory And there... youll always be Goodbye may seem forever Farewell is like the end But in my hearts the memory And there youll always be Hold it, sonny! Back off! Consarn it! Where...? Where do you think youre goin? Oh, excuse me, I... I was just trying to... You barge in on somebodys house like you own it. Tarryhootin around them woods, wakin up folks in the middle of the night. I honestly didnt know anybody lived here, and I... Well, you know it now. Now get off my property! Go on! Beat it! Ive been watching you, sir. You can stay with me if you want to. Thats very nice of you. Come with me. She dropped that fox off at the game preserve. Well get him. Well get him. Well, now, if you gotta have a busted leg, this is the way to do it. Good food, soft pillow, warm stove. Sure beats sleepin in that barrel. Well, now, here comes visitors to see the invalid. How do you like that? They didnt even ask how Im feelin. Chief, get back in there before I break your other leg. Copper, Copper, lookit here. Now, when that fox comes traipsin along, suspectin nothin... Tod? Tod? Oh, boy. These old wings aint what they used to be. Big Mama, you better lose a few pounds. There he is, there he is. Tod! Tod! Oh, hi, Big Mama. Oh, its you, Vixey. Hey, what brings you way out here? Im lookin for a fox named Tod. Hes new here in the forest. Oh, new? Well, what does he look like? Oh, hes young. About your age. And handsome. Handsome? Oh, say. Gee, he sure sounds nice. Im not doing anything. Ill help you find him. Come on. Hes gotta be around here somewhere. Wha...? What happened? Where am I? So, its you again? You barged in on me last night, and now you... I didnt mean to. Just look at the mess you made. Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead! Im sorry. It was an accident. Excuses, excuses. Mr Digger, sir? It was so too an accident. You keep out of this, you walkin pincushion. You shouldnt be so grumpy to someone whos new in the neighbourhood. A stranger? Why dont you go back where you came from? Wha...? Well, go on. Get goin. Git! Gosh, he seems so... I dont know, so downhearted, Big Mama. Well, you cant blame him, honey. He was dropped out here and left all alone without a friend in the world. Well, maybe theres something I could do. You know, cheer him up. Honey, you just said the magic words. Now... What? But Big Mama, I dont... Darlin, dont move. You look beautiful. Thank you. Mornin, Tod. Hello, Big Mama. Last night was pretty miserable for you, wasnt it, honey? Just terrible. Cheer up and look around. The forest is beautiful this morning. After last night, nothin looks beautiful. Wow! Who...? Who is that? Oh, just another fox. A lady fox. Golly! Is she beautiful! I wonder what her name is. Well, why dont you go ask her? Yeah. Yeah, guess... Guess I will. Ill... Ill go up to her and Ill say, Youre the most gorgeous... The most beautiful... Never seen anyone, anywhere... Ill say... Hi. Hello. Big Mama told me, you know... I just happened to be... May I call you by your first name? Oh, sure. Why not? Thanks, but what...? What is your first name? Vixey. Vixey. My name is... is... Tod. Tod? Thats a... Thats a nice name, Tod. It looks like that farm boy is makin it big with her. Now just keep it down. Well, Tod, you know something? This stream is just full of trout. Do you think you could catch one? One what? One what? Fish, silly! Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah. My dear young lady... ...you happen to be looking at an expert... fisher fox. Oh, Tod, Tod. Dont overdo it. I know all the tricks. In fact, I... I never miss. Please let him catch a fish. Here comes a whopper! Now, watch closely. Tod, do you need help? No. No, I do it this way all... all the... all the time! I got him. Oh, that farm boy, he dont know nothin about fishin. He aint gonna hook her that way. Oh, gosh! Tod, youre the funniest thing I ever saw! Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh! Youre like everyone else around here. Im sorry. I cant help it. You are so funny. So I cant fish! Youre a silly, emptyheaded... female! Now just a minute. I mean, youve got a nerve. Why dont you grow up? Tod, thats no way to talk to Vixey. Oh, raspberries! Ive had it. Honey, dont stay mad. You gotta be natural. Thats the trick. Cant you see? When you have a natural attraction You deserve a mutual reaction Youre gonna get a whole lot Of satisfaction Heres all you gotta do When you feel that Natural affection Leads you in the positive direction You gotta stop showin off Start showin up With little old natural you Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady And now that is a natural fact Cause when you be yourself With the lady, yeah You gonna get appreciated Right back But Big Mama... Its just getting interesting. Tod, I... I just know youre gonna love the forest. Listen, come on. Let me show you around. Sure. Come on. Look. One, two, three, four, five, six. Seven. I think six would be just right. Six? Six what? No hunting. Well, now, we aint gonna do none of that, are we, Copper? Were just gonna get us a nogood fox. All right, boy, get trackin. Smell him out. What ya got there, Copper? Good work, boy. Hell be comin right through here, headin for water. But he wont be drinkin any. What a beautiful morning, Vixey. You know, Ive never been happier. Oh, Tod, me too. That does it. Amos, you crafty old coot. The devil himself couldnt have done no better. Tod? Tod, wait a minute. What is it, Vixey?

Copper! Copper! We got em now for sure. This is their only way out. Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready. Tod! Were trapped! Tod, Im scared. Quick, Vixey! This is our only chance! Whoa! No! I dont believe it! Copper, weve trapped him now! Copper! Tod! Tod? Come on, Copper. Get outta the way. Well... ...come on, boy. Lets go home. This is it. We got him for sure now. Oh, my gosh! What happened? Hey, theres somethin very familiar about those eyes, Dinky. Nah, it couldnt be. Could it? Bye, Squeeks. Bye. Good luck, honey. Ouch! Youre killin me! Ouch!

The Great Mouse Detective,Disney,1980,1986,Animation,"You know, Daddy, this is my very best birthday. But I haven't given you your present yet. What is it? What is it? Now, close your eyes. Oh, oh, oh... Oh, now... No peeking now. Oh, Daddy! You made this just for me? You're the most wonderful father in the whole world! Who is that? I... I don't know! Quickly, dear, stay in here and don't come out. I got you, toy maker! Oh, no! Olivia! Daddy, where are you? Daddy, where are you? Daddy! It was the eve of our good queen's Diamond Jubilee, and the year Her Majesty's government came to the very brink of disaster. She... I... I... I'm getting ahead of myself. My name is Dr. David Q. Dawson, most recently of the queen's 66th Regiment. I had just arrived in London after lengthy service in Afghanistan, and was anxious to find a quiet place, preferably dry, hmm... where I could rest and find a bit of peace. Little did I know that my life was about to change forever. Oh! Oh, my! Are you all right, my dear? Come now, come, come, come. Here, here, dry your eyes. Ah, yes. Ah, that's better. Now, tell me, what's troubling you, my dear? I... I'm lost. I... I... I'm trying to find Basil of Baker Street. Well, let me see here. ""Famous detective solves baffling disappearance."" Mmmhmm. Uh, but, uh... Where are your mother and father? That's why I must find Basil. There, there, there, there. Now, now, now, now. Well, now, I don't know any Basil. But I do remember where Baker Street is. Now, come with me. We'll find this Basil chap together. Good evening, madam. Is this the residence of Basil of Baker Street? I'm afraid it is. He's not here at the moment, but you're welcome to come in and wait. Oh, I... I don't want to impose. It's... it's just, the girl... Oh, my! You poor dear! You must be chilled to the bone! Oh. But I know just the thing. Let me fetch you a pot of tea and some of my fresh cheese crumpets. Aha! The villain's slipped this time! I shall have him! Out of my way! Out of my way! I say... Oh! Who are you? What? Oh. Basil of Baker Street, my good fellow. Mr. Basil, I need your help. And... All in good time. But you don't understand. I'm in terrible trouble. If you'll excuse me. Now... Now see here! This young lady is in need of assistance. I think you ought to listen... Hold this, please, doctor. Of course. Wait just a moment. How did you know I was a doctor? A surgeon, to be exact. Just returned from military duty in Afghanistan, am I right? Why... Oh, yes. Major David Q. Dawson. Uh... But how could you possibly... Quite simple, really. You've sewn your torn cuff together with a Lembert stitch, which, of course, only a surgeon uses. And the thread is a unique form of catgut easily distinguished by its peculiar pungency, found only in the Afghan provinces. Amazing! Actually, it's elementary, my dear Dawson. What in heaven's name? Oh! Oh... My... My good pillows. Mr. Basil! How many times have I told you... Mrs. Judson, it's quite all right. Uh... Mmm. I believe I smell some of those delightful cheese crumpets of yours. Why don't you fetch our guests some? But... Now, I know that bullet's here somewhere. Thank you, Miss... Flaversham. Olivia Flaversham. Whatever. Yes, but you don't understand. Yes. Yes! No! Drat! Another dead end. He was within my grasp. Now, will you please listen to me? My daddy's gone, and I'm all alone. Young lady, this is a most inopportune time. Surely your mother knows where he is. I... I don't have a mother. Well... Um... Then perhaps... See here, I simply have no time for lost fathers. I didn't lose him. He was taken by a bat. Did you say bat? Yes. Did he have a crippled wing? I don't know, but he had a peg leg! I say, do you know him? Know him? That bat, one Fidget, by name, is in the employ of the very fiend who was the target of my experiment! The horror of my every waking moment. The nefarious Professor Ratigan! Uh... Ratigan? He's a genius, Dawson. A genius twisted for evil. The Napoleon of crime. As bad as all that, eh? Worse! For years, I've tried to capture him, and I've come close, so very close. But each time, he's narrowly evaded my grasp. Not a corner of London's safe while Ratigan's at large. There's no evil scheme he wouldn't concoct! No depravity he wouldn't commit. Who knows what dastardly scheme that villain may be plotting, even as we speak? Quite an ingenious scheme, eh, Flaversham? And aren't you proud to be a part of it? This whole thing is... It... it's monstrous. We will have our little device ready by tomorrow evening, won't we? You know what will happen if you fail. I... I... I don't care! You can do what you want with me. I won't be a part of this... this... ...this evil any longer. Very well, if that is your decision. Oh, uh, by the way, I'm taking the liberty of having your daughter brought here. Olivia? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I would spend many a sleepless night if anything unfortunate were to befall her. You... you wouldn't. Finish it, Flaversham! Oh, I love it when I'm nasty. Fidget. Fidget! Bright and alert as always. Here's the list. You know what to do, and no mistakes! No mistakes, sir. ""Tools, gears, girl, uniforms..."" Now, Fidget! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! My friends, we are about to embark on the most odious, the most evil, the most diabolical scheme of my illustrious career. A crime to top all crimes. A crime that will live in infamy! Tomorrow evening, our beloved monarch celebrates her Diamond Jubilee. And with the enthusiastic help of our good friend, Mr. Flaversham, it promises to be a night she will never forget. Her last night, and my first as supreme ruler of all mousedom! From the brain that brought you the Big Ben Caper The head that made headlines in every newspaper And wondrous things like the Tower Bridge Job That cunning display that made Londoners sob Now comes the real tour de force Tricky and wicked, of course My earlier crimes were fine for their times But now that I'm at it again An even grimmer plot has been simmering In my great criminal brain Even meaner? You mean it? Worse than the widows and orphans you drowned You're the best of the worst around Oh, Ratigan The rest fall behind To Ratigan The world's greatest criminal mind Thank you, thank you. But it hasn't all been champagne and caviar. I've had my share of adversity, thanks to that miserable secondrate detective, Basil of Baker Street. For years, that insufferable pipsqueak has interfered with my plans. I haven't had a moment's peace of mind. Aww... But all that's in the past! This time nothing, not even Basil, can stand in my way! All will bow before me! Oh, Ratigan You're tops and that's that To Ratigan To Ratigan, the world's greatest rat What was that? What did you call me? He didn't mean it, professor. It was just a slip of the tongue. I am not a rat! 'Course you're not. You're a mouse! That's right. A mouse. Yeah, a big mouse. Silence! Oh, my dear Bartholomew, I'm afraid that you've gone and upset me. You know what happens when someone upsets me. Oh, Ratigan Oh, Ratigan You're the tops and that's that Oh, dear. To Ratigan To Ratigan The world's greatest... Oh, Felicia, my precious, my baby. Did Daddy's little honey bun enjoy her tasty treat? I trust there will be no further interruptions. And now, as you were singing... Even louder We'll shout it No one can doubt what we know you can do You're more evil than even you Oh, Ratigan Oh, Ratigan Ah... You're one of a kind To Ratigan To Ratigan Hey. The world's greatest criminal Mind This case is most intriguing with its multiplicity of elements, its many twists and turns. Now, you're certain you've told me everything? The slightest detail may be important. It's just as I said. And then my father was gone. What do you make of it? Ratigan's up to something. A crime of the most sinister nature, no doubt. The question is... What would he want with a toymaker? Quickly, we've not a moment to lose! I'm right behind you, Basil. No... No sign of the blackguard anywhere. Not quite, Dawson. He left some rather unusual footprints. They belong to the same fiend who abducted the girl's father. Ratigan's peglegged lackey. Uh... Basil? Aha! Excellent work, old man. Now there's nothing to be afraid of, my dear. The scoundrel's quite gone. But not for long, Miss Flamhammer. Flaversham! Whatever. Now... We simply pursue our peglegged friend until he leads us to the girl's father. Then you'll get my daddy back? Yes! And quite soon, if I'm not mistaken. Now, hurry along, Dawson. We must be off to Toby's. Toby's? Oh, you must meet him. He's just the chap for this. You... You want me to come? I should think a stouthearted army mouse like you would leap at the chance for adventure. Well, I am rather curious. Wait for me! I'm coming too! What? Certainly not! This is no business for children. Are we going to take a cab? My dear, I don't think you understand. It will be quite dangerous. Oh! Why, you... Look what... Young lady, you are most definitely not accompanying us. And that is final! And not a word out of you. Is that clear? I... Shh! I observe that there's a good deal of German music on the program. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. But, Holmes, that music is so frightfully dull. Come on. Toby? Who is Toby? Well, my dear, Toby is, uh... Well, he's, uh... I say, Basil, who is this Toby chap? Ah! Here he is now. Dawson, Toby. Charmed, I'm sure. Now, Toby, stop that! Toby, cease! Desist! Frightfully sorry, old man. He has the most splendid sense of smell of any hound I've trained. But he can be deucedly frisky. Hello, Toby! Silly doggy! Would you like a crumpet? Now, Toby? To the matter at hand. I want you to... Good, now, Toby... Toby... I want you to find this fiend. Yes, you know his type. A villain. A scoundrel! Low brow. Closeset eyes. Broken wing. He's a peglegged bat with a broken wing. Yes! That's the spirit! Got his scent? Good boy! Good boy! Miss Flamchester! Flaversham! Whatever. Your father is as good as found. Toby, sic 'em! Aha! Yoinks! Tallyho! The thrill of the hunt, eh, Dawson? Aha! Quite! Hoohoo! Our peglegged quarry can't be far now. ""Get the following. ""Tools."" Check. I got tools. ""Gears."" Doublecheck. I got gears. ""Girl."" No, didn't get girl. ""Uniforms."" I got plenty uniforms. Oh, no. I gotta hide. I gotta hide. I gotta hide! Splendid job, Toby! Now, Toby, sit. Toby, sit. Sit, Toby. Good boy. If you'll excuse me. You be good now. We're going to find my father. Here is our friend's entrance. But, Basil, how could he fit in through such a tiny... Observe, doctor. Basil, you astound me! Shh. Oh. I... I beg your pardon... Oh, my. Upon my word, I've never seen so many toys. Behind any of which could lurk a bloodthirsty assassin. So please, doctor, be very careful. Oh! Please! Quiet. Don't let this girl out of your sight. Now, Olivia, dear, stay close. Hmm... Checkmate. Aha! Evidence of our peglegged adversary. Mmmhmm. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hmm. How very odd. What is it, Basil? Isn't it painfully obvious, doctor? These dolls have been stripped of their uniforms. And not by any child, either. Hello. Someone has taken the liberty of removing the clockwork mechanisms from these toys. Basil. Please, I'm trying to concentrate. But Basil, I... Olivia! Gotcha! Quickly, doctor! Look out! Byebye. Byebye! Stop, you fiend! Help! Uncle Basil, help! I got the gears, I got the tools I got the uniforms I got the girl Basil! Basil! Mama, Mama. Mama. Basil! Olivia... Olivia, she's... Mama. Yes! She's gone, Dawson! Mama. Confound it! Mama. I told you to watch over the girl. Mama. Now she's been spirited away by that maniacal little monster. Soon to be in the clutches of the most depraved mind in all of London! I should have known better than to... Than to... Eh... I... Uh... Dawson? Dawson? I say, Dawson, old chap? Oh. Uh... Poor girl. I should have watched her more closely. Don't worry, old fellow. It's not entirely hopeless. We'll get her back. Do... Do you think there's a chance? There's always a chance, doctor, as long as one can think. Mmm. ""Get the following. ""Tools, gears..."" What? ""...girl..."" ""Get the..."" Dawson, you've done it! This list is precisely what we need. What? Quickly, back to Baker Street. Mr. Flaversham... Allow me to present your charming daughter. Olivia! Father! Ow! My foot! My only foot! Oh, Father! I thought I'd never find you. There, there, my bairn. I'm all right. I was so worried about my little girl. Oh, how sweet. Oh, I just love tearful reunions. Now, come along, my dear. Oh, please! Please! Olivia! Oh, please, professor! Father! Now, now... Fidget will take good care of her. That is, as long as we have no further delays. Yes, yes, I'll finish it. Oh, just don't hurt my daughter. Remember, it must be ready tonight. Stop! Let me go! You ugly old thing! That ought to hold you! Help! Let me out! Let me out! See how you like that. Ah, the uniforms. Fidget, I knew I could rely on you. Now, you didn't forget anything? No problem. I took care of everything. Everything on the list. Uhoh. What's wrong? The list, I know... Where is the list? The list, yeah, yeah, yeah. You see, it was like this. I was in the toy store getting uniforms when I heard... You're not coming through. A dog came. I ran. I had baby bonnet, girl in bag and Basil chased me. What? Basil on the case! Why you gibbering little... Oh, my dear Fidget. You have been hanging upside down too long. You mean, you're not mad? I'm glad you're taking it so well. Not me, you idiot. No, stop you stupid fur ball! Open up! Open up! Oh! Ay! Ah! You're hurting my wings! How dare that idiot Basil poke his nose into my scheme and foul up everything! Let me out! Let me out! Help... I can just see that insufferable grin on his smug face. Yes, yes, I can just see it. Felicia, release him. I'm too young to die! Fidget, you delightful little maniac. You've presented me with a singular opportunity. Poor Basil! Oh, he is in for a little surprise. Offhand, I can deduce very little. Only that the words are written with a broadpointed quill pen which has spattered, twice. That the paper is of native Mongolian manufacture, no watermark. And has been gummed, if I'm not in error by a bat who has been drinking Rodent's Delight, a cheap brandy sold only in the seediest pubs. Hmm. Amazing. Oh, not really, doctor. We still don't know where it came from. Perhaps a closer inspection will tell us something. Mmmhmm. Hmm. Mmmhmm. Coal dust. Clearly of the type used in sewer lamps. But Basil... Shh. Don't speak! Excuse me, Dawson. Steady hand. Yes. Yes. Good. Come along, come along, come along, come along, come along. Yes, yes. Good, good. Mmm. No, bad. Good, good. Go, yeah. Come along. Come along, come on. Don't go back up. Yes. Come along. Come on. Yes... Yes! We've done it, old fellow! This reaction could only have been triggered by the paper's extreme saturation with distillation of sodium chloride. Salt water? Great Scott. It proves, beyond a doubt, this list came from the riverfront area. Now, steady on there, Basil. No, no. Elementary, my dear Dawson. We merely look for a seedy pub at the only spot where the sewer connects to the waterfront. Stay, Toby. Stay. Basil? Come, come, Dawson. I feel utterly ridiculous. Don't be absurd. You look perfect. Perfect? Perfectly foolish. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Dawson, stay close and do as I do. Oh, I do beg your pardon, madam. Quite unintentional I assure you. How impertinent! Remember, we're lowlife ruffians. I was until that... Shh, shh. Get off, you eightlegged bum! What's your pleasure, mates? I'll have a dry sherry with, uh... Oh, perhaps a twist of... Two pints for me and my shipmate. Oh, by the way, we just got into port. We're looking for an old friend of mine. Maybe you know him. Goes by the name of Ratigan! I... uh... never heard of him. Boo! Dearest friends dear gentlemen Listen to my song Life down here's been hard for you Life has made you strong Let me lift the mood With my attitude Hey, fellas The time is right Get ready Tonight's the night Boys, what you're hoping for will come true Let me be good to you You tough guys You're feeling all alone You rough guys The best o' you sailors and bums All o' my chums So dream on And drink your beer Get cozy Your baby's here You won't be misunderstood Let me be good to you Hey, fellas I'll take off all my blues Hey, fellas There's nothing I won't do Just for you There you are, boys. It's, uh... on the house. I say, how very generous. Dawson, these drinks have been drugged. Has a rather nice bite to it. Jolly good, ladies. Jolly good. Dawson, get a hold of yourself. Oh, bravo! Bravo! So dream on Whoops! And drink your beer If it isn't our peglegged friend. Dawson... Oh, what luck! Dawson? Dawson! Your baby's gonna come through Let me be good To you Yeah! Dawson. Dawson! What? Wha... What! What in heaven's name is going on? I've spotted our peglegged... Come on, old fellow. There's not a moment to lose. Let me be good to you So dream on and drink your beer Your baby's here Basil? Basil? Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Follow me. Great Scott. I can't see a thing. Grab my coat and follow along. No, no, no, not that way. Dawson, look out for your... Ow! Confound it! Do you have any idea where we're going? But of course. Left turn. Right turn here, doctor. Aha! Dawson! We found it! Ratigan's secret lair. And it's filthier than I imagined. Dawson, the bottle! It's stuck. Olivia? Surprise! Bravo! Bravo! A marvelous performance. Though, frankly, I expected you 15 minutes earlier. Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy? Ratigan, no one can have a higher opinion of you than I have, and I think you're a slimy, contemptible sewer rat. By the way, Basil, I just love your disguise. Really, one would hardly recognize you. The greatest... ...detective in all mousedom! Ratigan, so help me, I'll see you behind bars yet! You fool! Isn't it clear to you? The superior mind has triumphed. I've won! Oh, I love it! I love it! Oh, I love it! I love it! You don't know what a delightful dilemma it was trying to decide on the most appropriate method for your demise. I had so many ingenious ideas, I didn't know which to choose. So, I decided to use them all. Marvelous, isn't it? But here, let me show you how it works. Picture this. First, a sprightly tune I've recorded especially for you. As the song plays, the cord tightens, and when the song ends, the metal ball is released, rolling along its merry way until... Snap! Boom. Twang. Thunk. Splat! And, so ends the short, undistinguished career of Basil of Baker Street. You're despicable! Yes. Everything's ready? All set, boss. Oh, this is wicked! So delightfully wicked. Mr. Flaversham, let me congratulate you on a superb piece of craftsmanship. See what you can do with the proper motivation? You all know the plan. Right, professor. It was my fond hope to stay and witness your final scene, but you were 15 minutes late, and I do have an important engagement at Buckingham Palace. Now, you will remember to smile for the camera, won't you? Hmm? Say, ""cheese"". You fiend! Sorry, chubby. You should've chosen your friends more carefully. Goodbye so soon And isn't this a crime We know by now that time... Adieu, auf wiedersehen, arrivederci, farewell. Bye, bye, Basil. With time so short I'll say so long And go so soon Goodbye You followed me I followed you We were like each other's shadows for a while Now as you see this game is through So although it hurts Wh... What did he mean, an engagement at Buckingham Palace? Haven't you figured it out yet, doctor? The queen's in danger, and the Empire's doomed. The queen? Psst. Over here. Come on. Over here. Hmm. Come in. Begging Your Majesty's pardon. A present has arrived in honor of your jubilee. A present? Oh, how wonderful! I just adore jubilees. Here you are, sweetheart. Have you been with us long? ""To our beloved queen, this gift we send ""as her 60 year reign ""comes to an end""? How extraordinary! Goodness gracious! Amazing likeness, isn't it, Your Majesty? Professor Ratigan! Guards! Seize this despicable creature! Guards, seize this... Despicable creature! Oh, how dare you! Take her away. Let go of me, you ruffians! Move along, honey! You fiends! Traitors! So although it hurts I'll try to smile as I say Goodbye so soon And isn't this... Basil? Basil! Oh, how could I have been so blind? We all make mistakes. We can't let that stop us. We have to... Ratigan's proved he's more clever than I. He would never have walked into such an obvious trap. Oh, pull yourself together! You can stop that villain! Why... Why... So long... So long... So long Basil! The record! Oh, it's finally happened. I've been outwitted. Basil, please! Beaten! Duped! Made a fool of! Oh, ridiculed! Belittled! That's enough! Dash it all, Basil! The queen's in danger. Olivia's counting on us. We're about to be splattered, and all you can do is feel sorry for yourself. Well, I know you can save us. But if you've given up, then set it off now and be done with it. We know by now that time knows how to fly Set it off now. Yes. We... We'll set the trap off now! Basil! Wait! I didn't mean that we ought... Angle of the trajectory, multiplied by the square root of an isosceles triangle, dividing Guttermeg's principle of opposing forces in motion, and adjusting for the difference in equilibrium... Dawson, at the exact moment I tell you, we must release the triggering mechanism. What? Get ready, Dawson. Steady. Now! Thank you, Dawson. Smile everyone! On this most august occasion, we are gathered here not only to commemorate my 60 years as queen, but to honor one... Of truly noble stature. ""I present to you a statesman among mice. ""A gifted leader..."" A crusader for justice... Over here, fatty. You're a ton, toots. Here kitty, kitty. Time for mouse chow. A majestic mountain of humility, and my new royal consort, Professor Ratigan. Toby! The game's afoot, Toby. Our queen is in mortal danger. To Buckingham Palace! Thank you, Your Majesty. And now, as your new royal consort, I have a few slight suggestions. Item one... Stop it! Open wide. Byebye. Down, kitty! Down! Item 96... ""A heavy tax shall be levied against all parasites and sponges, ""such as the elderly, the infirm, ""and especially little children."" That's ridiculous. You're insane. Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. I have the power! Of course you do. I am supreme. Only you. This is my kingdom! That is, of course, with Your Highness' permission. Most assuredly, you insidious fiend. What? You're not my royal consort. What a sense of humor. You're a cheap fraud and impostor. Flaversham! A corrupt, vicious, demented, lowlife scoundrel. There's no evil scheme you wouldn't concoct. No depravity you wouldn't commit. You, professor, are none other than a foul, stenchus rodentus, commonly known as a... Don't say it! Sewer rat! Arrest that fiend! The girl! The girl! Stay where you are, or the girl dies! Hurry, Dawson! There he goes! Dawson! Flaversham! Gather up those balloons. Just wait! Basil's smarter than you! He's going to put you in jail. He's not afraid of a big old, ugly rat like you. Would you kindly sit down and shut up! Let her go, chaps! We have to lighten the load. Oh, you want to lighten the load? Excellent idea. No! No! Not me! I can't fly! I can't fly! Steady! Basil, look out! Closer, Dawson! Closer! Daddy, I can't reach! I can't reach! Basil! Over here! There's no escape this time, Basil! I've won! On the contrary! The game's not over yet! Oh! Hooray! Hooray! It's Basil! Good fellow! Jolly good! To be thanked by the queen herself. Oh, how very thrilling. Hey, Basil? All in a day's work, doctor. Oh, Dr. Dawson, you were wonderful. Indeed. Oh, my, we're late to catch our train. Come along, Olivia. Yes, Father. Goodbye, Basil. I... I'll never forget you. Nor I you, Miss... Miss Flangerhanger. Whatever. Goodbye, Dr. Dawson. Goodbye, my dear. Goodbye. Well, um... not a bad little girl, actually. Not at all. Well, it's time I was on my way, too. But... But I thought... Well, the case is over. Perhaps it's... Well, perhaps it's best I found my own living quarters. But... Now who can that be? Is this the home of the famous Basil of Baker Street? Indeed it is, miss. You look as if you're in some trouble. Oh, I am! I am! Then, you've come to precisely the right place. Allow me to introduce my trusted associate, Dr. Dawson, with whom I do all my cases. Isn't that right, doctor? Wha... What? Yes, yes! By all means. Mmm. As you can see, this young lady has just arrived from the Hampstead District, and is troubled about the disappearance of an emerald ring, missing from the third finger of her right hand. Now, tell me your story, and pray, be precise. From that time on, Basil and I were a close team and over the years, we had many cases together. But I shall always look back on that first with the most fondness. My introduction to Basil of Baker Street, the great mouse detective. "

We were in this sunken ship, and it was really creepy... Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see. Oh! Oh! Look at this. Wow. This is special. This is very, very unusual. What? What is it? It's a dinglehopper. Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out. See? Just a little twirl here and a yank there and violee... Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over. A dinglehopper. What about that one? Ah! This I haven't seen in years. This is wonderful! A banded, bulbous snarfblatt. Oh! The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day. Got very boring. So, they invented this snarfblatt to make fine music. Allow me. Music! It's stuck! Oh, the concert! Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me! The concert was today? You could make a little planter out of it. I'm sorry! I've gotta go! Thank you, Scuttle! Any time, sweetie! Any time. Yes, hurry home, Princess. We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's celebration, now, would we? Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah! In my day, we had fantastical feasts, when I lived in the palace. And now look at me. Wasted away to practically nothing. Banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate. Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough. Flotsam! Jetsam! I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his. She may be the key to Triton's undoing. I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady. Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot. As a result of your careless behavior... Careless and reckless behavior! ...the entire celebration was, uh... Well, it was ruined! That's all! Completely destroyed! This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career. Now, thanks to you, I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom! But it wasn't her fault... Uh, well, first, uh, the shark chased us. Yeah, yeah. And we tried to... but we couldn't, and he... And... And we... Whoa! And then we were safe. But then this seagull came, and it was, ""This is this..."" Seagull? What? Oh! You went up to the surface again, didn't you? Didn't you? Nothing happened. Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this? You could have been seen by one of those barbarians, by one of those humans! They're not barbarians. They are dangerous. Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by a fisheater's hook? I'm 16 years old. I'm not a child anymore. Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady! As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules! If you would just listen... Not another word! And I am never... never to hear of you going to the surface again! Is that clear? Hmph! Teenagers. They think they know everything. You give them an inch, they swim all over you. Do you think I was too hard on her? Definitely not. Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss. None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense. No, sir. I'd keep her under tight control. You're right, Sebastian. Of course. Ariel needs constant supervision. Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble. All the time. And you are just the crab to do it. How do I get myself into these situations? I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager. Hmm? What is that girl up to? Huh? Ariel, are you OK? If only I could make him understand. I just don't see things the way he does. I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.  Look at this stuff, isn't it neat   Wouldn't ya think my collection's complete   Wouldn't ya think I'm the girl   The girl who has everything   Look at this trove, treasures untold   How many wonders can one cavern hold?   Lookin' around here you'd think   Sure, she's got everything   I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty   I've got whozits and whatzits galore   You want thingamabobs? I got 20   But who cares No big deal   I want more   I wanna be where the people are   I wanna see Wanna see 'em dancin'   Walkin' around on those...  What do ya call 'em? Oh, feet.  Flippin' your fins you don't get too far   Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'   Strollin' along down a...  What's that word again?  Street   Up where they walk Up where they run   Up where they stay all day in the sun   Wanderin' free Wish I could be   Part of that world   What would I give if I could live   Out of these waters?   What would I pay to spend a day   Warm on the sand?   Betcha on land they understand   Bet they don't reprimand their daughters   Bright young women sick of swimmin'   Ready to stand   And ready to know what the people know   Ask 'em my questions and get some answers   What's a fire and why does it...   What's the word?   Burn?   When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love   Love to explore that shore up above?   Out of the sea   Wish I could be   Part of that   World  Sebastian! Ariel, what are you... How could you... What is all this? It's, uh... It's just my collection. Oh, I see. Your collection, hmm. If your father knew about this place... You're not gonna tell him, are you? Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand. Ariel, you're under a lot of pressure down here. Come with me, I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink. What do you suppose... Ariel? Ariel? Ariel, what are you... Jumpin' jellyfish! Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back! Max! Here, boy! Hey, come on, mutt. What ya doin', huh, Max? Come on, Max. Good boy. Good boy. Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh? Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you. Ooh, I got ya. I got ya. We're bein' intrepidaceous. We're out to discover! I've never seen a human this close before. Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he? I don't know. He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me. Not that one. The one playing the snarfblatt. Silence, silence. It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present. Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have. I know. Happy birthday, Eric. Uh, gee, Grim... Ha! It's, uh... It's really somethin'. Yes, I commissioned it myself. Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present. Come on, Grim. Don't start. You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven? Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone. The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl. Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just... I just haven't found her yet. Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough. Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know. Without a doubt, it'll just... bam... hit me, like lightning. Hurricane acomin'! Stand fast! Secure the riggin'! Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here! Yo! Ariel! Look out! Grim! Hang on! Max! Jump, Max! Come on, boy! Jump! You can do it, Max! Eric! Is he... dead? It's hard to say. Oh, I... I can't make out a heartbeat. No, look! He's breathing. He's so beautiful.  What would I give to live where you are?   What would I pay to stay here beside you?   What would I do to see you smiling at me?   Where would we walk Where would we run   If we could stay all day in the sun?   Just you and me and I could be   Part of your world  Eric? Eric! You really delight in these sadistic strains on my blood pressure, don't you? A girl... rescued me. She... She was singing. She had the most beautiful voice. Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater. Off we go. Come along, Max. We just gonna forget this whole thing ever happened. The sea king will never know. You won't tell him. I won't tell him. I will stay in one piece.  I don't know when I don't know how   But I know something's starting right now   Watch and you'll see   Some day I'll be   Part of your   World  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can't stand it. It's too easy. The child is in love with a human. And not just any human. A prince! Her daddy will love that. King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a charming addition to my little garden. Ariel dear, time to come out. You've been in there all morning. What is with her lately? Oh. Morning, Daddy. Well! Oh, she's got it bad. What? What has she got? Isn't it obvious, Daddy? Ariel's in love. Ariel? In love? OK. So far, so good. I don't think the king knows. But it will not be easy keeping something like this a secret for long. He loves me. Mmm. He loves me not. He loves me! I knew it! Ariel, stop talking crazy! I gotta see him again... tonight. Scuttle knows where he lives. Ariel, please! Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs? I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder will splash around to get his attention. And then we'll go... Down here is your home! Ariel, listen to me. The human world... It's a mess. Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.  The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake   You dream about going up there  But that is a big mistake   Just look at the world around you   Right here on the ocean floor   Such wonderful things around you   What more is you lookin' for?   Under the sea Under the sea   Darling, it's better down where it's wetter   Take it from me   Up on the shore they work all day   Out in the sun they slave away   While we devoting full time to floating under the sea   Down here all the fish is happy   As off through the waves they roll, yeah   The fish on the land ain't happy   They sad 'cause they in the bowl   But fish in the bowl is lucky   They in for a worser fate   One day when the boss get hungry   Guess who's gonna be on the plate  Oh, no!  Under the sea Under the sea   Nobody beat us, fry us and eat us in fricassee   We what the land folks loves to cook   Under the sea we off the hook   We got no troubles Life is the bubbles   Under the sea   Under the sea   Under the sea   Under the sea   Since life is sweet here we got it beat here   Naturally   Naturally   Even the sturgeon and the ray   They get the urge and start to play   We got the spirit, you got to hear it, under the sea   The newt play the flute The carp play the harp   The plaice play the bass and they soundin' sharp   The bass play the brass The chub play the tub   The fluke is the duke of soul   The ray, he can play The ling's on the strings   The trout's rocking out The blackfish, she sings   The smelt and the sprat They know where it's at   And, oh that blowfish blow   Yeah, under the sea   Under the sea   Under the sea   Under the sea   When the sardine begin the beguine   It's music to me   Music it is to me   What do they got? A lot of sand   We got a hot crustacean band   Each little clam here know how to jam here under the sea   Each little slug here cutting a rug here under the sea   Each little snail here know how to wail here   That's why it's hotter under the water   Yeah, we in luck here down in the muck here   Under the sea  Ariel? Oh, somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor. Sebastian! Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you. I've got an urgent message from the sea king. The sea king? He wants to see you right away. Something about Ariel. Oh, he knows! Hey, let's see now. Oh, who could the lucky merman be? Come in, Sebastian. I mustn't overreact. I must remain calm. Yes? Yes, Your Majesty? Sebastian. I'm concerned about Ariel. Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately? Oh! Uh, peculiar? You know, mooning about. Daydreaming, singing to herself. You haven't noticed, hmm? Oh, well, I... Sebastian? Hmm? I know you've been keeping something from me. Keeping something? About Ariel? Ariel? In love, hmm? I tried to stop her, sir! She wouldn't listen! I told her to stay away from humans! They are bad! They are trouble! Humans? What about humans? Humans? Who said anything about humans? Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about? Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about? You'll see. It's a surprise. Oh, Flounder. Flounder, you're the best! It looks just like him. It even has his eyes. Why, Eric, run away with you? Oh, this is all so... so sudden. Daddy? I consider myself a reasonable merman. I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed. But, Dad, I... Is it true you rescued a human from drowning? I had to... Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden. Ariel, you know that! Everyone knows that. He would have died. One less human to worry about. You don't even know him. Know him? I don't have to know him! They're all the same. Spineless, savage, harpooning fisheaters incapable of any feeling... Daddy, I love him! No! Have you lost your senses completely? He's a human. You're a mermaid. I don't care. So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you. And if this is the only way, so be it! Daddy! No! No! Please! Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it! Daddy, no! Ariel, I... Just go away. Poor child. Poor, sweet child. She has a very serious problem. If only there were something we could do. But there is something. Who... Who are you? Don't be scared. We represent someone who can help you. Someone who can make all your dreams come true. Just imagine... You and your prince... Together forever. I don't understand. Ursula has great powers. The sea witch? Why, that's... I couldn't possibly. No! Get out of here. Leave me alone! Suit yourself. It was only a suggestion. Wait. Yes? Poor Ariel. I didn't mean to tell. It was an accident. Ariel? Where are you going? Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff? I'm going to see Ursula. Ariel, no! No! She's a demon. She's a monster. Why don't you go tell my father? You're good at that. But... But, I... Come on! This way. Come in. Come in, my child. We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude. One might question your upbringing. Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow. Not that I blame you. He is quite a catch, isn't he? Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple. The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself. Can you do that? My dear, sweet child. That's what I do. It's what I live for. To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to.  I admit that in the past I've been a nasty   They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch   But you'll find that nowadays I've mended all my ways   Repented, seen the light and made a switch  True? Yes.  And I fortunately know a little magic   It's a talent that I always have possessed   And here lately, please don't laugh, I use it on behalf   Of the miserable, lonely and depressed  Pathetic.  Poor unfortunate souls   In pain, in need   This one longing to be thinner   That one wants to get the girl   And do I help them? Yes, indeed   Those poor, unfortunate souls So sad, so true   They come flocking to my cauldron   Crying spells, Ursula, please   And I help them Yes, I do   Now it's happened once or twice   Someone couldn't pay the price   And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em across the coals   Yes, I've had the odd complaint   But on the whole I've been a saint   To those poor unfortunate souls  Now, here's the deal. I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days. Got that? Three days. Now, listen, this is important. Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you. That is, he's got to kiss you. Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love. If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently. But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me! No, Ariel! Have we got a deal? If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again. That's right! But you'll have your man. Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Oh! And there is one more thing. We haven't discussed the subject of payment. You can't get something for nothing. But I don't have any... I'm not asking much. Just a token really, a trifle. You'll never even miss it. What I want from you is... your voice. My voice? You've got it, sweetcakes. No more talking, singing. Zip! But without my voice, how can I... You'll have your looks, your pretty face. And don't underestimate the importance of body language! Ha!  The men up there don't like a lot of blabber   They think a girl who gossips is a bore   Yes, on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word   And, after all, dear What is idle prattle for?  Come on!  They're not all that impressed with conversation   True gentlemen avoid it when they can   But they dote and swoon and fawn   On a lady who's withdrawn   It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man   Come on, you poor unfortunate soul   Go ahead, make your choice   I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day   It won't cost much, just your voice   Ya poor, unfortunate soul   It's sad, but true   If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet you've got to pay the toll   Take a gulp and take a breath and go ahead and sign the scroll   Flotsam, Jetsam Now I've got her, boys   The boss is on a roll   This poor, unfortunate   Soul   Beluga, sevruga   Come, winds of the Caspian Sea   Larynxis, glossitis Et max laryngitis   La voce to me  Now, sing! Keep singing! That voice. I can't get it out of my head. I've looked everywhere, Max. Where could she be? Well, look at what the catfish dragged in. Look at ya. Look at ya. There's somethin' different. Don't tell me. I got it. It's your hairdo, right? You've been usin' the dinglehopper? No? No, huh? Well, let me see. New seashells? No new seashells. I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now. If I stand here long enough... She's got legs, you idiot! She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs. Geez, man! I knew that. Ariel's been turned into a human. She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta kiss her. And she's only got three days! Just look at her! On legs! On human legs! My nerves are shot! This is a catastrophe! What would her father say? I'll tell you what her father'd say. He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab! That's what he'd say! I'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I should have done the minute... And don't you shake your head at me, young lady. Maybe there's still time. If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish and just be... Just be... Just be miserable for the rest of your life. All right, all right. I'll try to help ya find that prince. Boy, what a soft shell I'm turning out to be. Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya. If you wanna be a human, the first thing to do is dress like one. Let me see. Max? What? Huh? What? Max! Ya look great, kid. Ya look sensational. Max! Max! Quiet, Max. What's gotten into you, fella? Oh. Oh, I see. Are you OK, miss? I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you. He's harmless really, uh... You seem very familiar to me. Have we met? We have met. I knew it. You're the one, the one I've been looking for. What's your name? What's wrong? What is it? You can't speak? Oh! Oh, then you couldn't be who I thought. What is it? You're hurt? No, no. You need help? Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy. Gee, you must have really been through something. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you. Come on. Come on. You'll be OK. Washed up from a shipwreck. Oh, the poor thing. We'll have you feeling better in no time. I'll just... I'll just get this washed for you. Well, you must have at least heard about this girl. No! Gertrude says... When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right? Really. Madam, please... She shows up in rags and doesn't speak. Not my idea of a princess. If Eric's looking for a girl, I know a couple of highly available ones right here. Oh, Eric, be reasonable. Oh, Eric, be reasonable. Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then flitter off into oblivion... I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real. I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her. Come on, honey. Don't be shy. Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision? Uh, you look wonderful. Come, come, come. You must be famished. Let me help you, my dear. There we go. That's better. Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha. It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric? Uh, do you like it? It is rather a fine one. Oh, my. Sorry, Grim. Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks. Ah, very amusing. Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner? Oh, you're gonna love it! Chef's been fixing his speciality: Stuffed crab.  Nouvelle cuisine   Les ChampsElysÃ©es   Maurice Chevalier   Les poissons, les poissons   How I love les poissons   Love to chop and to serve little fish   First I cut off their heads Then I pull out their bones   Ah, mais oui Ã§a c'est toujours delish   Les poissons, les poissons   With the cleaver I hack them in two   I pull out what's inside and I serve it up fried   'Cause I love little fishes Don't you?   Here's something for tempting the palate   Prepared in the classic technique   First you pound the fish flat with the mallet   Then you slash through the skin, give the belly a slice   Then you rub some salt in   'Cause that makes it taste nice  Oh. Zut alors! I have missed one.  Sacrebleu! What is this?   How on earth could I miss   Such a sweet, little succulent crab?   Quel dommage! What a loss   Here we go, in the sauce   Now some flour I think just a dab   Now I'll stuff you with bread   It don't hurt 'cause you're dead and you're certainly lucky you are   'Cause it's gonna be hot in my big silver pot   Toodleoo, mon poisson, au revoir  Eh? Eh? What is this? Ow! Yeow! Oh, ow, ow, oh! I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to. Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man! Louis! Ow. What are you doing? Well, I was just, uh... I'm sorry, madame. You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom. Something in the way of a tour. I'm sorry, Grim. What was that? You can't spend all your time moping about. You need to get out. Do something. Have a life. Shh! Get your mind off... Easy, Grim, easy. It's not a bad idea, if she's interested. Well, what do ya say? Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow? Wonderful! Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate. Come here, boy. This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life. I hope that you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady. Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you. Tomorrow when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best. You gotta bat your eyes, like this. You gotta pucker up your lips, like this. Hmm. You are hopeless, child. You know that? Completely hopeless. Any sign of them? No, Your Majesty. We searched everywhere. We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian. Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored. Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home. Yes, sire. Oh, what have I done? What have I done? Has he kissed her yet? Not yet. Oh! Oh, Judy! Yo! Flounder! Any kissing? No, not yet. Well, they'd better get crackin'! Move over. Move your big feathers. I can't see a thing. Nothing is happening. Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once. OK. All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation. Stand back! Wa, wa, wa, wawa! Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery. Wa, wa, wawa! Wa, wa, wa, wawa! Geez, man. I'm surrounded by amateurs. Wa, wa, wa, wa! You want something done you've got to do it yourself. First we got to create the mood. Percussion. Strings. Winds. Words.  There you see her   Sitting there across the way   She don't got a lot to say   But there's something about her   And you don't know why but you're dyin' to try   You wanna kiss the girl  Did you hear something?  Yes, you want her   Look at her You know you do   Possible she want you too   There is one way to ask her   It don't take a word   Not a single word Go on and kiss the girl  Sing with me now.  Shalalalalala My, oh, my   Look like the boy too shy He ain't gonna kiss the girl   Shalalalalala Ain't that sad?   Ain't it a shame?   Too bad he gonna miss the girl  You know, I feel really bad not knowing your name. Maybe I could guess. Is it Mildred? OK, no. How about Diana? Rachel? Ariel. Her name is Ariel. Ariel? Ariel? Oh. That's kind of pretty. OK. Ariel.  Now's your moment   Floating in a blue lagoon   Boy, you better do it soon   No time will be better   Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya   She don't say a word   And she won't say a word until ya kiss the girl   Shalalalalala Don't be scared   You got the mood prepared Go on and kiss the girl   Shalalalalala Don't stop now   Don't try to hide it how you wanna kiss the girl   Whoa, whoa   Shalalalalala Float along   And listen to the song Wa, wa, wa, wawa!

Ah, she's better than I thought. Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure. Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles. Triton's daughter will be mine! And then I'll make him writhe. I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook! Eric? If I may say, far better than any dream girl is one of flesh and blood, one warm and caring and right before your eyes. Ariel! Ariel, wake up! Wake up. I just heard the news. Congratulations. Kiddo, we did it! What is this idiot babbling about? Right, as if you two didn't know, huh? The whole town's buzzin' about the prince gettin' hitched this afternoon! You know, he's getting married. You silly sidewalker. I just wanted to wish ya luck. I'll catch ya later. I wouldn't miss it! Well, now, Eric. It appears that I was mistaken. This mystery maiden of yours does, in fact, exist. AAnd she is lovely. Congratulations, my dear. We wish to be married as soon as possible. Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know. This afternoon, Grimsby. The wedding ship departs at sunset. Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric, uh, as you wish.  What a lovely little bride I'll make   My dear, I'll look divine   Things are working out   According to my ultimate design   Soon I'll have that little mermaid   And the ocean will be mine  The sea witch! Oh, no! She's gonna... I gotta... Ariel! Ariel! Ariel, I was flying... Of course, I was flying. And... I saw the... the watch... The witch was watching the mirror, and she was singin' with a stolen set of pipes. Do you hear what I'm tellin' you? The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise! Are you sure about this? Have I ever been wrong? I mean, when it's important? What are we gonna do? Before the sun sets on the third day. Day... Ariel, grab onto that. Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you. I'll try! I gotta get to the sea king. He must know about this. What about me? What about me? You! Find a way to stall that wedding! Stall the wedding. WWhat am I? What? That's it! Let's go! We got an emergency here. Dearly beloved... Don't worry, Ariel. We're gonna make it. We're almost there.

She's mine now! We made a deal. Daddy, I'm sorry! II... I didn't mean to! I didn't know! You see? The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you. Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain. The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity. But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better. Eric, what are you doing? Grim, I lost her once. I'm not gonna lose her again! Now, do we have a deal? Ha! It's done then! No! Oh, no! Your Majesty. Daddy. At last... it's mine. No. You! You monster!

Eric! The sea and all its spoils bow to my power! Eric! Oh! Oh! So much for true love! She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian? Mmm. Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty, children got to be free to lead their own lives. You always say that? Then I guess there's just one problem left. And what's that, Your Majesty? How much I'm going to miss her. Ahha! Yes! Thank you. Thank you. I love you, Daddy.  Now we can walk Now we can run   Now we can stay all day in the sun   Just you and me   And I can be   Part of your world "
A Bug's Life,Disney,1990,1998,Animation,"No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm lost! Where's the line? It just went away. What do I do? Help! We'll be stuck here forever! Do not panic. Do not panic! We are trained professionals. Now, stay calm. We are going around the leaf. Around the leaf? I don't think we can do that. Oh, nonsense. This is nothing compared to the twig of '93. That's it. That's it. Good! You're doing great! There you go. There you go! Watch my eyes. Don't look away. And here's the line again. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil. Good job, everybody! Oh my. There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil. Shouldn't we tell the queen? I don't think we need to involve the queen in this. She's got enough on her plate already, training her daughter. Oh, yes. Princess Atta, the poor dear. Wind's died down. They'll be here soon. Just be confident, dear. You'll be fine. There's a gap, there's a gap in the line. What are we gonna do? It's ok, Your Highness. Gaps happen. We just lost a few inches, that's all. Right. Your Highness, I can't count when you hover like that. Of course. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Guys, go shade someone else for a while. Ok, Atta. Now what do we do? Oh, don't tell me. I know it. I know it. What is it? We relax. Right. It'll be fine. It's the same, year after year. They come, they eat, they leave. That's our lot in life. It's not a lot, but it's our life. Isn't that right, Aphie? You're such a cute little aphid. Ditch Dot! Yeah, yeah! Hey, come back here! Dot! Yes, Mother. What did I tell you about trying to fly? Not until my wings grow in. Right. But Mom... Dot, you're a young queen ant and your wings are too little... I was talking to Mother. You're not the queen yet, Atta. Now, Dot, be nice to your sister. It's not my fault she's so stressed out. I know, I know. I'm always acting like the sky is falling. Look out! Atta! Princess Atta! Princess Atta. Princess Atta! Oh! Hey! Stop that! What do you think you're doing? You could have killed somebody over here. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Oh, it's Flik. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! Please forgive me. I'm sorry! Princess Atta! Flik, what are you doing? Oh, this! This is my new idea for harvesting grain. No more picking individual kernels. You cut just down the entire stalk! Flick, we don't have time for this. Exactly, we never have time to collect food for ourselves. Because we spend all summer harvesting for the offering. But my invention will speed up production. Another invention? Yeah. I got something for you too. Flick! Since you're gonna be queen soon, you could use this to oversee production. Dr. Flora, if I may. Very nice. What? Just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew, right? Flik, please. Wrong! It is, in fact... a telescope. It's very clever, Flik, but... Hello, Princess! Aren't you looking lovely this morning! Not of course that you would need a telescope to see that. All right, listen! The princess doesn't have time for this! You wanna help fill this thing? Get rid of that machine, get back in line and pick grain like everybody else! Like everybody else! Please, Flik. Just go. I'm sorry, I was really just trying... trying to help. Harvester. Why, we harvested the same way ever since I was a pupa. Where were we? The food pile, Your Highness. Yes, yes. Hey, Flik! Wait Wait up! Hello, Princess. You can call me Dot. Here, you forgot this. Thanks. You can keep it. I can make another one. I like your inventions. Really? Well, you're the first. I'm beginning to think nothing I do works. This works? Great. One success. I'm never gonna make a difference. Me, neither. I'm a royal ant and I can't even fly yet. I'm too little. Being little's not such a bad thing. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Is too! Is not! Is too! A seed. I need a seed... Here, here. Pretend. Pretend that that's a seed. It's a rock. Oh I know it's a rock, I know. But let's just pretend for a minute it's a seed, all right. We'll just use our imaginations. Now, do you see our tree? Everything that made that giant tree, is already contained inside this tiny little seed. All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain and... Voila! This rock will be a tree? Seed to tree. You've gotta work with me, all right, ok? You might not feel like you can do much now, but that's just because, well you're not a tree yet. You just have to give yourself some time. You're still a seed. But it's a rock. I know it's a rock! Don't ya think I know a rock when I see a rock? I've spent a lot of time around rocks! You're weird, but I like you. They're here. They're coming! Run! Dot! Dot! Mom! Mom! Thank heavens! Food to the offering stone. Ok everyone, single file. Food to the offering stone and into the anthill. Now let's go! Go, go, go! Come on, keep moving, keep moving! Good. Ok. That's everyone. Hey! Hey, wait for me! Get the food to the offering stone, then into the anthill. Princess Atta! Princess Atta! Princess Atta! They come, they eat, they leave. They come, they eat, they leave. Excuse me, pardon me. Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me. Sorry, sorry. Coming through. Princess, there's something I need to tell you. Not now, Flik. But Your Highness, it's about the offering! Hey, what's going on? Yeah, where's the food? What did you do? It was an accident? Where's the food? Hopper. So, where is it? Where's my food? Isn't it up there? What? The food was in a leaf sitting on top... Excuse me. Are you sure it's not up there? Are you saying I'm stupid? No. Do I look stupid, to you? Let's just think about the logic, shall we? Let's just think about it for a second. If it was up there, would I be coming down here, to your level, looking for it? I... Why am I even talking to you? You're not the queen. You don't smell like the queen. She's learning to take over for me, Hopper. Oh, I see. Under new management. So it's your fault? No, it wasn't me, it was... First rule of leadership. Everything is your fault. But I... It's a bugeatbug world out there, Princess, one of those circleoflife kind of things. Now, let me tell you how things are supposed to work. The sun grows the food, the ants pick the food, the grasshoppers eat the food... And the birds eat the grasshoppers. Hey, like the one that nearly ate you, you remember? you remem... Oh, you shoulda seen it. Molt! This blue jay, he has him halfway down his throat, ok, and Hopper, Hopper's kicking and screaming, ok. And I'm scared. Ok. I'm not going anywhere near, ok? Come on, it's a great story. I swear, if I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed, that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you. And believe me, no one appreciates that more than I do. Shut up! I don't want to hear another word out of you while we're on this island. Do you understand me? I said, do you understand me? How can I answer, you said I couldn't say another word. Remember Ma! Hey, I'm a compassionate insect. There's still a few months till the rains come, so you can all just try again. But Hopper, since it's almost the rainy season, we need this time to gather food for ourselves. Listen, if you don't keep your end of the bargain, then I can't guarantee your safety. And there are insects out there that will take advantage of you. Someone could get hurt. What's the matter? You scared of grasshoppers? Dot! You don't like Thumper? Leave her alone! You want her? Go ahead... take her. No? Then get back in line. It seems to me that you ants are forgetting your place. So let's double the order of food. No! But, but... We'll be back at the end of the season, when the last, leaf falls. You ants have a nice summer. Let's ride! Flik, what do you have to say for yourself? Sorry. I... I'm sorry for the way I am. I didn't mean for things to go so wrong. I especially didn't want to make you look bad, Princess. Well Flik, you did. I was just trying to help. Then help us, don't help us. Help, help. Help? Flik, you are sentenced to one month digging in the tunnels. Excuse me Your Highness, need I remind you of Flik's tunnel within a tunnel project? Helpers to help us. It's ok. That's it! That's. We could... It took, the whole engineering department, two days to dig him out. Send him to Health and Ant Services. Heavens, no! We could leave the island, the river bed's dry right now. We'd just walk right across the river bed. We could go get helpers. We could! We could leave. Sure. We could go find helpers to help us. It's perfect! Perfect? What's so perfect? Your Highness, don't you see? We could send someone to get help! Leave the island? No, why didn't I think of that? Because it's suicide! She's right! We never leave the island. Never leave! There's snakes and birds and bigger bugs out there! Exactly! Bigger bugs! We could find bigger bugs to come here and fight. And forever rid us of Hopper and his gang! Ludicrous! Who would do a crazy thing like that? I'll volunteer. I'd be very happy to volunteer. You got a lot of spunk, kid, but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants. At least we could try. I. I. I could. I could travel to the city! I could search there! If you went, you'd be on that silly search for weeks. Royal huddle. Great idea, Princess. It's perfect! Exactly. Wait a minute, what did we just decide here? To let Flik leave. While we keep harvesting to meet Hopper's demands. You see, with Flik gone, he can't... He can't mess anything up! Flik, after much deliberation, we have decided, to grant you your request. Really? Really? Really. Thank you, Princess. Thank you so much for this chance. I. I. I won't let you down, I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. No, forget it Oh, but I should probably help repair the damage before I go, don't you think? No! No, no! No! No, no! No! No, no! Just go. Just leave! Hey. Don't worry! The colony is in good hands! Bye, now. All right. Hey, fellas. Beautiful morning? My dad says he gives you one hour before you come back to the island crying. Does he, now? My dad doesn't think that. He doesn't? No, he's betting you're gonna die. Yeah, he says if the heat doesn't get you, the birds will. Well, I think he's gonna make it. Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness. Yeah, Dot. What do you know? Hey, hey, hey. Ease up all right. Come on. She's entitled to her opinion too. So go, already. Hey! The city's that way. I know. You're supposed to look for bugs, not dandelions. You leave him alone. He knows what he's doing. That's right. Here I go, for the colony! And for oppressed ants everywhere! Hey! Heyheyhey! Bye, Flik! Good luck, Flik! Bye! Flik! I'm... ok! Your dad's right. He's gonna die. You just watch. He's gonna get the bestest, roughest bugs you've ever seen! Get back! Get back! Get back, you horrible beast! I have no fear! Oh, my goodness. Oh, no! Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie? Owie! Owie, owie. Please show Rosie the owie. All right, Dim. It's ok. I have been in outhouses that didn't stink that bad. This is ridiculous. What a disappointment! Oh, no! You! Come here! I want my money back! No refunds after the first two minutes. Popcorn! Stale popcorn! We're losing the audience! You clowns get out there now! I hate performing on an empty stomach! Do your act, Heimlich. Then you can eat. P.T what's the point? Not now, Slim. What's the point of going out there? They'll only laugh at me. That's because you're a clown! No, it's because I'm a prop! You always cast me as the broom, the pole, the stick, a splinter. You're a walkingstick. It's funny! Now go! You parasite. Spring's in the air. And I'm a flower with nothing interesting to say. A bee! I am a cute little bumblebee! Here I come! Slow down, you flowers! Candy corn! Here, Here. let me help you to finish it. Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate with a real bug? Come to papa! yeah! So, being a ladybug automatically makes me a girl, is that it, fly boy? You lie she's a guy! Francis, leave them alone. They are poopoo heads! Not again. Judging by your breath, you must have been buzzing around a dung heap all day. Come on, Francis. You're making the maggots cry. All right, we're dying out there. Gypsy, quick! You and Manny... He's in a trance. Well, get him out of it! You and your husband are up now. Manny, we're on. Yet again, it is up to me to rescue the performance. Gypsy, come. The stage is the other way, dear. Yes, of course. Anytime, pal! I'm gonna pick the hairs out of your head one by one! Take your best shot! You name the place! Oh, yeah? Yeah, because when you get there, you are dead! Francis, let me handle this. That's no way to speak to a lady. I heard that, you twig. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Manto the Magnificent, and his lovely assistant, Gypsy! From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia, I give you the Chinese Cabinet, of Metamorphosis! Rosie, whole troupe on stage! Finale now! Ok, I just need time to... Now! Coming, coming. Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys. We're up next. Don't you understand? We are up! Hey! Hey! They don't understand me. I summon the voice of Confucius... Get off the stage, you old hack! I demand to know who said that! How dare you! Ingrates! Manny? Manny! I only got 24 hours to live and I aint gonna waste it here. Come on. I've just about had it with these losers! Flaming death! I hold in my hand the match... the match that decides whether two bugs live or die this very evening. In a moment, I will light this trail of matches... leading to a sheet of flypaper, dowsed in lighter fluid! Aimed directly at the flypaper, are Tuck and Roll, the pill bug cannonballs! The cannon will be triggered by Dim, trained to jump at the sound of this bell, set to go off in 15 seconds. Our pill bugs' only hope of survival, is our mistress of the high wire, Rosie! Secured to a web line of exact length, Rosie will plummet down to these two posts, spinning a web of safety in less than 15 seconds! Not good enough, you say? Well, what if they were all... blind folded! Ladies and gentlemen, may I suggest that those of you with weak constitutions, leave the arena, for this act is so dangerous. That if the slightest thing should go wrong... No! Go? Ok, through the tunnel... Ok, that's done! P.T! Oh, no! Rosie! Water! We need some water! Water, water, water, water, water! Get me outta here! It's the web. I'm sorry. You're all fired. We got the water! Here we come, P.T! We'll save you. Burn him again! No, Harry, no! Don't look at the light! I can't help it! It's so beautiful! Try not to look like a country bug. Blend. Blend in. Hey, Buggy! What do you expect? The guy's a tick. The city! Making all stops to the septic tank, including standing water, empty bean can and dead rat. Watch your stingers. All aboard! Hey, watch it. Hey! Get out of the way! Oh, sorry. Watch where you're going! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't... I mean... Sorry! Are you? I'mI'mI'm I'm really, really sorry. That was anan acaccidan accident. Hey, don't come back! I'll show you who's tough! And stay out! Tough bugs! I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly... Move it! Hey, waiter! I'm in my soup! I've been working out. Feel my wing. Yo! Two Black Flags over here! Hair of the dog you bit. Hey, who ordered the poopoo platter? Here you go, slick. Enjoy. Hey, I said no salt! Pardon me, sir. I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment. I represent a colony of ants, and, and I'm looking for tough bugs, you know mean bugs, the sort of bugs... Fired by a flea, how humiliating! Let's face it. We stink. You fired. You fired! You fired! Will you shut up? Hey! You fired! Someday I will be a beautiful butterfly, and then everything will be better. I can't believe the troupe is breaking up. We've always been together. Farewell, my friends. To the audience we'll never have. Hey Francis! Your boyfriends from the circus are here! There she is. Hello there, girlie bug. Shoo, fly. Don't bother me. Say, why don't you tell our pal, Thud, what you said to us at the circus. Yeah. Something about buzzing around a dung heap? Excuse me. Hi. I represent an ant colony and we're... Hey, bartender! Bloody Mary, Opositive. Sir?  Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home   Not so tough now, are you? All right, clown. Get up and fight like a girl. Get ready to do the Robin Hood act. I want to be LittleJohn! What part can I play? You see, I'm looking for tough, warrior bugs. Stand back, you flies! We are the greatest warriors in all bugdom! Warrior bugs! My sword! Swish, swish. Clang, clang. LittleJohn? What ho, Robin? Justice is my sword and truth shall be my quiver! Wait, wait! No, no! I want to watch this! Jawohl! Thrust. Parry. Lunge! Me thinketh it's not working! Back to Sherwood Forest! Schnell! Schnell! What's going on in there? Help! Help! Get me out! You're perfect! Oh, great ones! I have been scouting for bugs with your exact talents! A talent scout. My colony's in trouble. Grasshoppers are coming! We've been forced to prepare all this food. Dinner theater! Food? Please! Will you help us? Where are they? We'll take the job! Really? Yes, yes, yes! You can explain the details on the way. Ok, come on, everyone. Break a leg! You're vicious! Hold on, Mr. Ant. Amazing! This is too good to be true! So, you see, it was my fault that Hopper's coming back. But then, Princess Atta. Boy, is she one in a million, she let me go out and find you. And after seeing you fight off those flies. Boy, are those grasshoppers in perfect for a surprise! Dr. Flora! Oh, my dear. Not another one. This is insane. Insane. There's just not enough food left on the island! No way we can make double quota before Hopper comes. Well, we have to try, Thorny. We don't have any choice. Yeah, I know. Hey, look who's playing lookout again. Little Speck! The name is Dot. Well Spot, still looking for Flik? Forget it, Dot. That loser's never coming back. Flik! He did it! He did it! What? Quit shoving! This is it! This is Ant Island! Flik! Over here! Flik! Flik! Hey! He did it! He did it! He did it! Yeah! He did it! Cool! At the rate these leaves are dropping, we're gonna need a miracle. That's right! We need a miracle! Run for your lives! Tada! Once again, our reputation precedes us. Hey, everybody! Hey! I'm back! Hey, guys! Heyhey! Look, look, look who's here with me! Flik! Flik! Flik! You're back! I knew you could do it! Flik? It's Flik! What? Yeah. No, it's not Flik. Flik has returned! He's back? And he's accompanied by savage insects! What? How? He... He wasn't supposed to actually find someone! Oh, look at this, look at this. This is great. Look. Oh, my ticker! So, what are you supposed to be? He's a stick, stupid. He hit bugs with him. No that's an oversimplification. That's right, kids. Like this! Ah no. Put me down! Hey! My, you just pop right open there, dont you? Oh, oh. Kids, he's kinda ticklish. Let's come on out. Be careful. Well my boy, you came through. Aphie and I are very impressed. Princess Atta! Hey! Hey guys, this is Princess Atta! She's the one that sent me to find you! Atta! Atta! Did you see that really big bug over there? He looks absolutely ferocious! They're our ticket out of this mess! They came just in time! That's right! So, Princess Atta, what do you think? No, no, no, no, wait! This was not supposed to happen. Mayday, Mayday. We're losing the job. We don't fight grasshoppers. We don't, but they will. Bingo! We gotta sweeten the deal. Your Majesty, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of all ages, our troupe here guarantees a performance, like no other! Why, when your grasshopper friends get here, we are gonna knock them dead! Boy, these folks are sure hard up for entertainment. Come on. Hurry! Honey, relax. You should be proud of yourself. Your instincts on that boy were right on the money. And to make our official welcome complete. Mr. Soil? Yes, Your Highness? He's our resident thespian. Last year he played the lead in Picnic. The children, and myself, have quickly put together a little presentation, in honor of our guests. Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub? Oh, aren't they adorable! Oh, they're cute! The South Tunnel Elementary School second grade class, would like to present you with this, a mural we have drawn, of you bugs, helping us fight the grasshoppers away. Look at the beautiful colors of the blood. We drew one of you dying because our teacher said it would be more dramatic.  I tell you a tale, of heroes so bold,   Who vanquished our grasshopper enemies of old.  Look, the last leaf has fallen. We are the grasshoppers! Where's our food? Who will come to save us poor ants? We are the warriors, here to defend you! I die! Die! Die! Hail, the bugs! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Hey, hey, hey! I say we go. Ok, honey. You're up. We're all very very grateful to have... Here, here. The warriors...  Thanks.  First of all,  I'd like to thank the warriors  for helping us in our fight, against the grasshoppers.  Secondly,  I would like to thank,  Flik,  for his forthright thinking... Thank you, Your Highness.  Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for all of this, but that wouldn't be right.  Because it was you, Princess Atta.  You believed in me and you sent me on my Quest,  You tell that ant that we need to talk to him right now. Now, I know I've made mistakes,  Go! In the past, and I hope that this will make up...  Flik! Not right now Rosie. I'm making a speech. Now, I truly believe these bugs are the answer to our...  No, there's no circus around here. So, I...  Your Highness, the warriors have called for a secret meeting to plan for a circus, circumventing the oncoming hordes so they can trapeze... trap them with ease! Shouldn't I come too? No! Sorry no is classified in the D.M.Z. Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know, strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye! Sorry. Sorry I have to take the warriors away so early but you know... they have a... they have a lot to get done, with the battle looming and all. So... please, everyone enjoy the party. B.Y.O.B? Thanks again. Bye. Byebye. Ok, just... Just, just get in there. Go! Go! Go, go, go! Circus bugs? How can you be circus bugs? What? Hey, hey, hey. You said nothing about killing grasshoppers pal. You lied to us! Ja! Are you kidding? Do you know what this is? This my friends, is false advertising. How dare you! You sir, are the charlatan in this scenario, touting your wares as a talent scout, preying upon the hungry souls of hapless artistes. Good day to you, sir. Wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go. You have got to help me. Give me some time, I'll come up with a plan. Just go tell them the truth! They can't, they can't know the truth. The truth you see is bad. I will be branded with this mistake for the rest of my life. My children's children will walk down the street, and people will point and say, Look! There goes the spawn of Flik, the loser! You know, all right, fine. Yeah, ok. Just go. But if you could just do me a little favor before you leave. If you could squish me, that would be great, because... when they find out, I'm as good as dead. Flik! I really do think I should be part of this meeting. Flik! Princess Atta! What a nice surprise. Just what exactly is going on? I would like to speak with the socalled, warriors. You can't, I mean, they are in the middle of a top secret meeting right now, and they really should not be disturbed now. Right, guys? Could you excu... pl... Could you. Could you excuse me, please? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please don't go! I'm not going anywhere. What is going on? Flik? Flik! I knew it! Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Please don't go! No! Quick, he's losing it! No, no, no, no, no! You can't go! I'm desperate! Really? I couldn't tell. Come on, wings. Help! Mother, Flik is up to something. No! No! Ok Flik, time to put you down. Get him off me! He's cutting off the circulation to my foot. Let go! No, no, no, no! Please, please, don't go! Put the stick down. Flik, I mean it now. Drop the stick. Drop it. Run! Boy, he runs fast for a little guy. Tweettweet! Tweettweet! This way. There they are. A bird! Flik! Look! Dot! Flik! Dot! My baby! I gotcha! I gotcha! I gotcha, I gotcha! I can't see! Somebody do something! Are they all right? Did anyone see are they all right? I can't see! What is happening? Dot? Good heavens, they're in trouble! Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis... You guys, I've got an idea! Here! I've got it! Please, ma'am, wake up! Wake up! Help! Help! Mr. Early Bird! How about a nice, tasty worm on a stick? I'm going to snap. I'm going to snap. Nice and juicy, succulent. Let's go! There they are! Flik! Help! Ok. Flik! It's going to be ok, Dot. Byebye, birdie! Help! I'm stuck! Pull me down! Schnell, schnell, schnell! The caterpillar's using himself as live bait! How brave! Suck it in, man! My leg! The bird! The bird! Look out for the bird! Flik! Upa, upa, upa, upa, upa! What is that? That, my friends, is the sound of applause! Applause. I'm in heaven! Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs for rescuing our smallest member, Princess Dot. And as a tribute to Miss Francis, we've changed out bandannas! We voted you our honorary den mother! What? Great. Den mother. All right girls, let's move your keisters outta here now. The patient needs her rest, you know. Come on. Excuse me, Flik. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Again... Thank you all, very, very much. Oh, stop it. You're too kind. Thank you. You don't think I've offended the warriors, do you? You? No. Good. Because you see... when you first brought them here, I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns. You did? Don't tell them I said that. Boy, that's all I'd need, another royal blunder like that. Princess, you're doing a great job. Thanks, you're sweet. You're wrong, but sweet. I know what everyone really thinks. I don't follow you. Everyone. The whole colony. Nobody really believes I can do this job. It's like, they're all watching me. Just, just... Waiting for you to screw up. Flik, I owe you an apology. For what? Well, I haven't been that nice to you and... I'm sorry. If there's any way I can make it up to you... Hey! I know! How would you like to be the queen's official aide to the warrior bugs? Me? Oh, sure. You've got a great rapport with them, especially after that rescue. It was very brave. Really? Naw, naw... Well, not every bug would face a bird. I mean, even Hopper's afraid of them. Yeah, I guess, you know maybe I... Say that again? I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds. Thank you. Hopper's afraid of birds! And I don't blame him! Oh, this is perfect. We can get rid of Hopper, and no one has to know that I messed up. You just keep pretending you're warriors. Flik, honey. We are not about to fight grasshoppers, ok? You'll be gone before the grasshoppers ever arrive. It will be easy, here's what we do. Not another word. I don't know what you're concocting in that little ant brain of yours, but we'll have no part of it. Excuse me? Could we get the warriors' autographs? Autographs? Ja! So, you fellas catch the action today? The bird went... and it just missed you! Aren't you sweet? And the way you pretended to be stuck in that crack! That's just all part of the plan. Yeah, yeah. And then you divebombed into the bush! There you go, my boy. Thanks! Ma... Major. That's Major Manny, young cadet. I outrank everyone here. Remember that. Yes, sir! Dismissed! When I grow up, I'm gonna be a praying mantis! I'm gonna be a stick bug! They're all so cool, I can't pick! Delightful for lads. You were saying, Flik? All right, we are going to build a bird. A bird that we can operate from the inside, which would then be hoisted... hoisted above the anthill and hidden high in the tree. Then, right when Hopper and his gang are below, we'll launch the bird and scare off the grasshoppers. Now it's going to take everyone's involvement, to make this plan a reality. I know it's not our tradition to do things differently, but if our ancestors were able to build this anthill, we can certainly rally together to build this bird! Perfect! Ok, hit your marks!  Hi, Flik. I love what you did with your antenna. Oh, thank you. Oh, look. She's a natural mother. All right, that's it! Out! Out! Everybody out! Ok, now you're gonna cry, right? Now you're gonna cry. See if I care. Go ahead and cry. Go ahead! Please, don't cry. Please. Ok lowe. Lower. You got it. And that's it! Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up! Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the barn, two by two by, there's the yarn. Done! Ruben Kincaid! Hey! Good job, guys! Nice work! Up, down. Up, down. Up, down. Read them and weep. Flik, watch out! Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly! There you go. Good job, fellas. Keep up the good work. Ok! You're fired! Yes! Look at me! I'm barefooting! Yo, bugito, dos granitos, pronto! You gotta try this, man!  La cucaracha, la cucaracha   Dadadadadadada  We go all the way back there and it starts to rain, we might as well be sucking bug spray. Don't even say that! You know something? You're making a lot of sense. I mean, why take the risk? You should tell Hopper. Good idea. But, you know, it's really not our place. I mean you're his brother. That makes you, like... the vice president of the gang. It kinda does, doesn't it? Ok, I'll tell him. Boy I should talk to you guys more often. What if Hopper doesn't like it? Then at least the genius will get smacked and not us. Vice President Molt. Yeah, that's good. That's good. A little lower. Lower. Lower. Hey ya, Hop. Go away. That's fine, then I won't tell you my idea. Good! Ok, ok. I'll tell you anyway. You see, I've been thinking, Ok, which is something I do, being vice president and all. And this is a thought and it was mine. Why go back to Ant Island at all? I mean you don't even like grain. What? You're right, I didn't think it was such a good idea myself. Actually it wasn't even my idea. It was Axle and Loco's! They talked fancy to me. I got confused!  La cucaracha  Guys, order another round because we're staying here! Yeah! What was I thinking, going back to Ant Island. I mean, we just got here, and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter. Right? Why go back? But there was that ant that stood up to me. Yeah, but we can forget about him! Yeah, it was just one ant. One ant! Yeah, you're right! It's just one ant! Yeah, boss. They're puny! Puny. Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant. Did that hurt? Nope. Well, how about this one? Are you kidding? Well, how about this? You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one. And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life! It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line. That's why we're going back! Does anybody else wanna stay? He's quite the motivational speaker, isn't he? Let's ride! To the bird! The bird! Get down, roly boys! How low can you go, sing it now.  How low can you go  Do it, Princess.  How low can you go  And that's how my 12th husband died. So, now I'm a widow. I mean, I've always been a black widow, but now I'm a black widow widow. Thorny! Any sign of those fiends? Lemme check. No, not yet. But we'll be ready for them. Blueberries, dismissed! And, quit beating the boys up. Those little raisins do grow on you. Hey, how you guys doing? Some party? Is that grain dip fresh or what? Ok, I've told everyone you'll be stationed deep in the command bunker. Party quiets down, I sneak you out the back way and then you're... outta here forever. Dim don't wanna go. Well, if Dim stays he's gonna need me here. He's not fully trained. I mean, housetrained. I, I kinda promised the Blueberries I'd teach them canasta. It seems we've been booked for an extended engagement. Will you look at this colony? Will you just look at this colony? I don't even recognize it. I feel 70 again! Work that ab, baby! And I have you bugs to thank for it, so... thank you! And, thank you for finding them, Flik. Me? Ok. If you, I mean, if you don't mind I'll just... It's all tangled up. There. I think I'll go check on the bird. Bird's this way. Yeah, the bird's that way. She... What? Jiminy H. Cricket! They're back! Get ready, everybody! Get to your posts! Battle stations, everyone. This not a drill. Come on, everyone. You know your jobs! Let's go, go, go, go! Look out! Oh there. Steady, girls. That's it. It's P.T. P.T? Greetings and salutations! Oohboppadoo and how do you do? I am the great P.T, Flea! I'm in need of your assis... Oh, let's just cut to the chase. Look, I've been going from anthill to anthill. I'm looking for a bunch of circus performers. Have you seen them? Wait a second. Aint that Staff Sergeant Slim? Nope! No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but... No one has seen anyone like that around here. Be quiet! No one has ever seen anyone Hey! Like that around here. So, you'll probably... You'll probably want to get going, I guess you got a lot of other anthills to check into so, bye! Guys, I've been looking all over for you! Flaming Death is a huge hit! P.T! I'm serious, word of mouth got around. P. T! No! The next day, there was a line of flies outside the tent went on forever! It must have been a foot long! P. T, no! So I figured it out, you guys burn me twice a night, I take a day off to heal, and then we do it all over again! We'll be the top circus act in the business! You mean, you're not warriors? Are you kidding? These guys are the lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen. And they're gonna make me rich! You mean to tell me that our entire defensive strategy, was concocted by clowns? Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought Flik's idea was gonna work. Tell me this isn't true. No, you don't... You don't... This couldn't have happened at a more inopportune time! The last leaf is about to fall! We haven't collected any food for the grasshoppers! If Hopper finds out what we almost did... Hopper is not going to find out. We're going to hide all this, and pretend it never happened. You bugs were never here. So I suggest you all leave. But the bird! The. The. The bird will work. I never thought I'd see the day when an ant would put himself, before the rest of his colony. What? The point is Flik, you lied to us. No, no, no! I. I... just... You lied, Flik. You lied to her. You lied to the colony! You lied to me! And like an idiot, I believed you. But I... I was just afraid, that... if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs... I just wanted to make, a difference. I want you to leave, Flik. And this time, don't come back. Tough crowd. Flik! That's it? But there's got to be more food on the island! If we give up any more we'll starve. Hopper won't accept this! Mother, it's not enough. What do we do? I, I don't know. You little termites! I give you a second chance, and this is all I get? But Hopper, we ran out of time! Have you been playing all summer? You think this is a game? No, no, please! Well, guess what? You just lost. Not one ant sleeps, until we get every scrap of food, on this island! Just do what he says. You don't want to make him mad. Believe me! No, no, no. You're staying with me, Your Highness. What do you think you're doing? Get over there. Quick! To the clubhouse. Hurry! Shut up a minute, will you? I think I heard something over here. Have you checked over there? No, not yet. Well then get over there and check it out! Wait a minute. Hey, I think I found something. Cool. Hey, how do I look? Like an idiot. I don't know, maybe it'll keep me dry in the rain. You moron, we'll be out of here before it rains. Didn't you hear Hopper? After the ants pick all the food, he's gonna squish the queen to remind them who's boss. Then she's dead. They cry... boohoo... we go home. End of story. Cool. I love our job. Stay here. I'm gonna get help. Come on, wings, fly. Fly! Yeah.  I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich.    I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich.   I'm gonna be the richest flea in the land.    Kaching!   The streets'll be paved with golden retrievers    I'm rich, rich, rich,   That's who I am.   Poor fellow. Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit. Don't worry, Flik. The circus life isn't so bad. Yes, you can be part of our act. Here! Like this. Slapstick! Get it? I'm a walkingstick. Never mind. Flik! Dot? Flik, wait! Wait! Dot, you're flying! Here. What are you doing here? You, have to go back. Hopper moved into the anthill, and his gang's eating everything! Oh, no! Good heavens! And I heard a grasshopper say, that when they're finished, Hopper's gonna squish my mom! Oh, not the queen! We have to do something! How? Come on, you guys, think! I know, the bird. Yes, of course! The bird, that's brilliant. Ja! The bird won't work. What are you talking about? It was your idea. But you said that everything... Forget everything I ever told you. All right, Dot? Let's face it. The colony is right. I just make things worse. And that bird is a guaranteed failure. Just like me. You listen to me, my boy. I've made a living out of being a failure. And you sir, are not a failure! Oh but Flik, you've done so many good things. Oh, yeah? Ok, show me one thing I've done right. Us. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Dim is right, my boy. You have rekindled the longdormant embers of purpose in our lives. And if it wasn't for you, Francis would have never gotten in touch with his feminine side. Oh yeah? Well... You know what? He's right. Lieutenant Gypsy reporting for duty. Kid, say the word and we'll follow you into battle. We believe in you, my boy. Flik, please? Pretend it's a seed, ok? Thanks, Dot. Hey, what's with the rock? Must be an ant thing. All right, let's do it. That's the Flik we know and love. We're on! So, what do we do first?  Bugs will pay big bucks to see   A bonfire that is starring me  P.T, look. Money! Where? Where? All right. Get moving! Get going. Move your abdomens, now! They're rounding everyone up. Hey! Turn your butt off. Hey, guys! Get me out of this thing, will you? I promise to start thinking about paying you. Hey! Wait, wait! Ok, I'll pay you! I'll pay you! Oh, no! They've finished collecting the food. We've got to get the queen now. Once she's safe, we move on Gypsy's signal. Someone's coming! Hello, kids! Ready to make some grasshoppers cry? It's payback time, Blueberrystyle. Blueberries rock! Yeah! All right! Ladies and Gentlebugs!  Larvae of all stages!  Rub your legs together for the world's greatest bug circus!  Wait a minute. I think I'm going to wet myself. Steady... What's going on here? Well... Yes. We were invited by Princess Atta, as a surprise for your arrival. Squish them. Hey! Now that's funny. I guess we could use a little entertainment. Looks like you did something right for once, Princess. On with the show! The circus, the circus. I love the circus. Baba all gone! Baby wants pie! Pie? He asked for it. Should I give it to him? Yeah! Give him pie! Give him pie! Thank you, gentlemen. Always an intellectual treat. Say, how many roaches does it take to screw in a light bulb? Can't tell. As soon as the light goes on, they scatter! Almost there. From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia, I give you the Chinese Cabinet... Come on, girls. Quick. Quick. Of Metamorphosis! Utilizing psychic vibrations, I shall select the perfect volunteer. Pick me! Oh, no! Come on, I'm asking you with my brain. Why, Your Majesty! Me? No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go. Maybe he'll saw her in half. As you ascend the dung beetle to the unknown, put your trust in the mysteries that are beyond mere mortal comprehension. This is gonna be good! Blueberries ready? Ready. Ready! I call upon the ancient Szechwan spirits... to inhabit the body of our volunteer! No, no. Just stay in there, Your Majesty. Transformation. Transformation! Transformation! Manny's getting good. Not now. If it rains, that bird'll get ripped to shreds! And now, insectus... transformitus! Pretty! Thank you, thank you. That's the signal. That's the signal! This is it, girls. Get ready to roll. It's stuck! That was amazing! I have no... How did they do that? I have no idea where she went. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. More, more, more! More! More! More! Wait! Where is she? Well, now, actually... I am sorry. A magician never reveals his secrets. That's very true, Hoppy. I mean, where would the mystery be if we all knew how it was... Shutting up. You can do it! You've got to make it work! Hey! I said, where is she? Hold on! Bird! It's a bird! Let's get out of here! Go! Don't let it get me! Don't let it get me! Help me! Up, down, up, down. And turn! Oh, my eye! Help me! Boysenberry. No, no, no, no, no! The pain! There goes my magic act! Flaming gas! No! P.T! A direct hit! Run! Flik! Help us! Dot! Ok! Everyone out! Hurry! Where's Dot? Anyone seen Dot? Whose idea was this? Was it yours, Princess? Just get behind me, girls. It'll be ok. Leave her alone, Hopper. The bird was my idea. I'm the one you want. Where do you get the gall to do this to me? You were... You were gonna squish the queen. It's true. I hate it when someone gives away the ending. You piece of dirt! No, I'm wrong. You're lower than dirt. You're an ant! Let this be a lesson to all you ants. Ideas are very dangerous things. You are mindless, soilshoving losers, put on this earth to serve us! You're wrong, Hopper. Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers! I've seen these ants do great things. And year after year, they somehow manage to pick food for themselves and you. So, so who is the weaker species? Ants don't serve grasshoppers. It's you who need us. We're a lot stronger  than you say we are. And you know it, don't you? Well, Princess! Hopper? I hate to interrupt, but... You ants stay back! Oh, this was such a bad idea! You see Hopper, nature has a certain order. The ants pick the food, the ants keep the food, and the grasshoppers, leave! I'm so proud of you, Flik! Chargea! Where are you going? They're just ants! No! Bad grasshopper! Bad grasshopper! Go home! Come back here, you cowards! Don't leave! To the cannon! To the cannon! No! Happy landings, Hopper! Rain! Flik! Quick! After them! Slim! Francis! Francis! Francis, I'm stuck! Where are you? I'm over here! Where? Here. I'm the only stick with eyeballs! Help! Help! Help! Get him! No! Go that way! But the anthill's over... I've got an idea! Flik! Come on! There! Come on! We've gotta hide! No matter what happens, stay down! Flik, no! What are you doing? Hopper! You think it's over? No, no, no. No, I, I can explain. All your little stunt did was buy them time! No, please! Please, Hopper! I'll get more grasshoppers and be back next season, but you won't! Well, what's this? Another one of your little bird tricks? Yup. Are there a bunch of little girls in this one too? Hello, girls! No! No! No, no, no, no! No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no! No, no, no! Come on, boys! Hey, Princess Dot! Wait up! I finally get a second to relax, and I gotta get out of my chair. Come on, you can rub lotion on me later, shade boy. Yeah, hubbahubba. Oh, thank you! Oh, you're too kind! It was the least we could do. All in a day's work. Any time. Dim! I'm so sorry, kids. I wish you could come along too. I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry. Hey, let's go. We got a schedule to keep. Come on, let's go. Hey, Tiny! Let's get this show packed up! We got paying customers hatching! Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Right away, sir. And... I just wanted to thank you for giving me a chance, because it's an honor to work with creative giants such as yourself. Shutting up. You sure you can't come on tour with us? Sorry, my place is here. Good answer. Oh, well. Your loss. One minute, insects! I wanna thank all of you, for giving us back our hope, our dignity, and our lives. And to you, Princess Atta. You have given us so much. Please accept this gift, from us bugs to you ants. For you! It's a rock. What's with the rock? Must be a circus thing. Well Flik, you really goofed up. Thanks. Yeah, you too. All right. Now it's getting mushy. We're outta here! See you next season! See you, Flik! Bye! We miss you already! You fired! You fired! We forgot Heimlich! I'm finished! Finally, I'm a beautiful butterfly! Mein wings! Oh, they're beautiful! Heimlich! The wagon's taking off! You better start flying! But I am flying! And from way up here, you all look like little ants! Auf Wiedersehen! Bye!

I didn't think it was such a good idea myself. Actually, it wasn't even my idea. It was... Watch it! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Is the camera broke? Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did I ruin the take? And thank you for finding them, Flik. Me? Oh, no. This really hurts, guys. I'm sorry, I'm s... So, is there a Mrs. Ant you have to tunnel home to? I'm sorry!

Well, I was sorta, kind of thinkin' that... I'd love to. Yeah? Yeah. Good. Great. Terrific. Wonderful. All right. Okay. C'mon, Roxanne. We don't want to belabor the moment now, do we?

Oh, Donald Duck? No, silly. With you! Are you okay, Maxie? WhWhat did you say? That's right! A vacation, son! We'll spend some real quality time together! I think I'm gonna be sick. Hey, got a present for ya! Dad, stop that! What are you doing? You look just like I did at your age. Please don't say that, Dad. Wait! I saved the best for last. Ayuk! It's been handed down from Goof to Goof to Goof. And now, it's yours, son. A stick? No, silly. A fishin' pole! Fishing? We're going fishing? Yep. Just like my dad and me did. Two best buddies fishin' on Lake Destiny. Away from it all! I don't wanna be ""away"" from it all, Dad. I like ""it all""! Look, Maxie, we're using the same map me and my dad used. We'll take the same route, and make the same stops... And see the same sights. Ahh! But that trip would take weeks, Dad! Exactly! Gettin' there is half the fun. Put the map away, Dad. It's not gonna happen. I'm tellin' ya. Careful, son. You'll wrinkle my past. Ayuk! And our future. What the map says, Max, we will follow. That's very mystical and everything, Dad, but, uh, seriously, there's this party I have to go to. And there's this girl... There'll be plenty of time for parties when you're older. Why, when I was your age I'd never even been invited to a party. Look at me now! Great, Dad. Hop in, Maxie. No. All right, then. Guess I'll just have to go... all alone. That's all. Just sit in the boat all alone... and talk to myself. All alone. I guess so. Oh, come on! Hop in! No, Dad. Just hop right in there. No. Come on, Maxie. Go for it! Argh! No. Let's buckle you up! And we're ready for takeoff! Ayuk. Set for adventure, Maxie? Why are you doing this to me, Dad? 'Cause I don't want ya to end up in the electric chair. Electric chair? What are you... I'm not givin' up on ya, son. Together, we're gonna work this out. Work this out? But, Dad! No buts about it, Maxie boy. Your ol' pop knows best. But... Goodbye, house. Goodbye, mailbox. Goodbye, pile of broken wood. Goodbye, hopes. Goodbye, dreams. Goodbye, Roxanne. Roxanne! Dad, I gotta stop somewhere first. I have to talk to someone. Well... Turn here! DDad, watch out! Aaah!

Hi, there. You wanna... uh, have a seat? Hey. Uh... oh. Daddy! I promise, he'll be better behaved when you pick me up for the party. Yeah, that's, uh, sorta why I came by. I'm really looking forward to it, Max. Yeah. I was too. Was? You see, my dad's on this stupid fatherson kick and... Don't worry about it, Max. It's just a dumb party. No, it's not. Roxanne, I really wanted to go with you. Max, I understand. Really, it's okay. But my dad surprised me. I don't wanna go, but I have no choice. I'm sure I can find someone else. Someone else? I'll just talk to you later. Uh, uh, Roxanne! Uh, my dad is, uh... My dad's taking me to the Powerline concert in LA. Your dad's taking you clear across the country just to see a concert?

You... party animal, you. You're really serious. Absolutely. So, uh... you aren't still thinkin' of goin' with someone else, are you? Well, I guess... Because I was hopin'... I could, uh, wave to you onstage when we join Powerline for the final number. This is incredible. Well, I wouldn't miss our date for anything that wasn't incredible, Roxanne. Mwa. Have a great time at the concert, Max. I'll see you on TV! Ah. I'm in deep sludge. Day one. Well, here we are, out on the open road, retracin' the steps of my boyhood.  And here's Maxie! A yuk!

You know, it's funny, but none of your techniques worked for me. The harder I tried, the worse it got. Once I eased up, things just clicked! Oh, that's swell. So, there's no problems then, huh? Not a one! That's, uh... I just hate to be the bearer of bad news, but uh... What is it, Pete? Your kid's dupin' ya. What do you mean? Well, I heard the little mutant tellin' P.J. that he changed the map, so you're headin' straight to LA, pal. What? Oh, you tried, Goof. He's just a bad kid, that's all. I don't believe you. What? I don't believe ya, Pete! Well, hey, don't take my word for it. Check your map. I don't need to check the map. I trust my son. You know, maybe Max isn't all the things that you think a son should be.

Ah! Ah! Now look where you've got us, Dad! Where I got us? You should've let me stay at home. Why? So you'd end up in prison? Prison? What are you talkin' about? Your principal called me. It's not what you think. You even lied to me! I had to! You were ruining my life. I was only tryin' to take my boy fishin', okay? I'm not your little boy any more, Dad! I've grown up. I've got my own life now. I know that! I just wanted to be part of it. You're my son, Max. No matter how big you get, you'll always be my son. There are times you drive me Shall we say, bananas  And your mind is missin' No offense, a screw  None taken. Still, whatever mess I land in  Who is always understandin'?  Nobody else but you  Oh, your moodiness is Now and then bewilderin'  And your values may be Soto speak, askew  Gesundheit. Thanks.  Who deserves a hero's trophy  As we face each catastrophee?  Nobody else but you  Nobody else but you kit's just our luck'  We're stuck together  Nobody else but you  It's crazy enough to believe We'll come through  So your jokes are all Let's face it, prehistoric  And your music sounds Like monkeys in a zoo  But when life becomes distressin""  Who will 1 be SOSin'?

Anyway, I figure she's never gonna want to talk to me again, much less go out with me. What a dumb lie, huh? What do you know? My Maxie... in love. Gosh, you're really growin' up. It happened so fast... I guess I sort of missed it. Well, I think the only thing for us to do now is to get you up onstage with this Powerline feller. Uh, how are we gonna do that? Well, you just leave that up to me. No, Dad, really, II think we should just, you know, forget it. Now how come you always think I'm gonna lead you into some sort of calamity? Uh, uh, Dad? Dad? What's wrong now? Look! Ayuk! A waterfall. Waterfall! Dad! Max! Grab ahold, Max! No! No! Ah! Whoa! Aaaaaaaaaah! Dad! Aaaaaaah! Ten o'clock, two o'clock, quarter to three. Tour jetÃ©.  Twist.

Hey yeah  I got myself a notion  One I know that you'll understand  We set the world in motion'  By reaching out for each other's hand  Dad? Maybe we'll discover  What we should have known all along  What are you doin' here? Hey! Yeah  One way or another  Max? Max? Together's where we both belong  If we listen to each other's heart'  We'll find we're never too far apart  And maybe love is the reason why  For the first time ever'  We're seein' it 121'  That Goof kid ain't there. Don't worry, he'll be there. Seein' it 121 Seein' it 121'  Excuse me. Uh... Seein' it 121'  I think we're seein' it  Max? Yeowee! Yeowee! Hey, Dad. Dad! Do the perfect cast!

Well, if she doesn't... maybe she's just not the one for you. That's what I'm afraid of. Ah, hi! Remember me? Daddy!  Max, I saw you on TV. You were great! Yeah? I mean, no, no. I mean, uh... Roxanne, I lied to you. I don't even know Powerline. What are you talking about? A billion people saw you dance with him. Yeah, well... I never met him before... the concert, that is. You mean that story about Powerline and your dad... Why would you make up something like that? I don't know. I guess I just... wanted you to like me. I already liked you, Max.

Aladdin,Disney,1990,1992,Animation," Oh, I come from a land   From a faraway place   Where the caravan camels roam   Where it's flat and immense   And the heat is intense   It's barbaric, but hey, it's home   When the wind's from the east   And the sun's from the west   And the sand in the glass is right   Come on down, stop on by   Hop a carpet and fly   To another Arabian night   Arabian nights   Like Arabian days   More often than not   Are hotter than hot   In a lot of good ways   Arabian nights   'Neath Arabian moons   A fool off his guard   Could fall and fall hard   Out there on the dunes  Ah, salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, please, come closer. Too close. A little too close. There. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today. Come on down. Look at this. Yes. Combination hookah and coffeemaker. Also makes julienne fries. Will not break. Will not... It broke. Ohh! Look at this. I have never seen one of these intact before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen. Ah, still good. Wait. Don't go. I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this. Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. This is no ordinary lamp. It once changed the course of a young man's life. A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale? It begins on a dark night, where a dark man waits  with a dark purpose.  You are late. A thousand apologies, O patient one. You have it, then? I had to slit a few throats, but I got it. Ahahahhh. The treasure. Ow! Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you. What's coming to you. Awk! Quickly! Follow the trail. Faster. At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders. Awk. Cave of Wonders. By Allah. Now, remember. Bring me the lamp. The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine. Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp. Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up? Shh. Who disturbs my slumber? It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief. Know this. Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies far within. A diamond in the rough. What are you waiting for? Go on. No! Seek thee out the diamond in the rough. I can't believe it. I just don't believe it. We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp. Just forget it. Look at this. I'm so ticked off that I'm molting. Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was obviously less than worthy. Oh, there's a big surprise. I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise. What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big... Yes. Only one may enter. I must find this one, this... Diamond in the rough. Stop! Thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat. All this for a loaf of bread? Whoa! There he is! You won't get away so easy! You think that was easy? You two, over that way, and you, follow me. We'll find him. Morning, ladies. Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin? Trouble? No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught. Gotcha. I'm in trouble. And this time... Perfect timing, Abu, as usual. Abu. Come on. Let's get outta here.  Gotta keep one jump   Ahead of the bread line   One swing ahead of the sword   I steal only what I can't afford   That's everything   One jump ahead of the lawmen   That's all, and that's no joke   These guys don't appreciate I'm broke   Riffraff   Street rat   Scoundrel   Take that   Just a little snack, guys   Rip him open   Take it back, guys   I can take a hint   Gotta face the facts   You're my only friend, Abu  Who?  Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom   He's become a oneman rise in crime   I'd blame parents   Except he hasn't got 'em   Gotta eat to live   Gotta steal to eat   Tell you all about it   When I got the time   One jump ahead of the slowpokes   One skip ahead of my doom   Next time gonna use a nom de plume   There he is   One jump ahead of the hit men   One hit ahead of the flock  I think I'll take a stroll Around the block   Stop, thief   Vandal   Abu   Scandal   Let's not be too hasty   Still I think he's rather tasty   Gotta eat to live   Gotta steal to eat   Otherwise we'd get along   Wrong  Get him! He's got a sword! You idiots. We've all got swords.  One jump ahead of the hoof beats   Vandal!   One hop ahead of the hump   Street rat!   One trick ahead of disaster   Scoundrel!   They're quick, but I'm much faster   Here goes, better throw my hand in   Wish me happy landin'   All I gotta do is jump  Yuck! Oy! And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right. Yum, yum! Uhoh. Here. Go on. Take it. Ah, don't. Huh? On his way to the palace, I suppose. Another suitor for the princess. Out of my way, you filthy brats. Hey! If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners. Oh. I'll teach you some manners. Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends. Ooh! You are a worthless street rat. You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you. I'm not worthless. And I don't have fleas. Come on, Abu. Let's go home.  Riffraff, street rat   I don't buy that   If only they'd look closer   Would they see a poor boy?   No, siree   They'd find out   There's so much more   To me  Someday, Abu, things are gonna change. We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all. I've never been so insulted. Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you? Good luck marrying her off. Oh! Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Confound it, Rajah. So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out. Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah? You were just playing with that overdressed, selfabsorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you? Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call. The law says you must be married to a prince by your next birthday. The law is wrong. You've only got three more days. Father, I hate being forced into this. If I do marry, I want it to be for love. Jasmine, it's not only this law. I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I... I just want to make sure you're taken care of. Provided for. Please try to understand. I've never done a thing on my own. I've never had any real friends. Except you, Rajah. I've never even been outside the palace walls. But, Jasmine, you're a princess. Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore. Oooh! I... I... Allah forbid you should have any daughters. Hmm? I don't know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn't nearly so picky. Oh! Ah, Jafar. My most trusted advisor. I am in desperate need of your wisdom. My life is but to serve you, my lord. It's this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. I'm at my wit's end. Awk! Wit's end! Oh! Have a cracker, pretty Polly. Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem. If anyone can help, it's you. But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond. Oh. Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years. It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. The diamond. Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine. You are most gracious, my liege. Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm? Yes. That will be pretty good. I can't take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers... Bam! Whack! Calm yourself, Iago. Then I'd grab him around the head. Whack! Soon I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit. And then I stuff the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha! Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me. I'll miss you. Goodbye. Okay, Abu. Go. Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing. Get your paws off that. Why, you... Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape! Goodbye. Nice going, Abu. Breakfast is served. Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass or silver. Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs. Sugar dates and pistachios. Would the lady like a necklace? A pretty necklace for a pretty lady. Fresh fish! We catch 'em, you buy 'em! Oh, no. I don't think so. Oh! Excuse me. I'm really very sorry. Wow. Uhoh. Hello? Hello? Oh, you must be hungry. Here you go. You'd better be able to pay for that. Pay? No one steals from my cart. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money. Thief! Please... If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the sultan. Do you know what the penalty is for stealing? No! No, please! Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her. I've been looking all over for you. What are you doing? Just play along. You, uh, know this girl? Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She's a little crazy. She said she knew the sultan. She thinks the monkey is the sultan. O wise Sultan, how may I serve you? Tragic, isn't it? But no harm done. Now, come along, sis. Time to go see the doctor. Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you? No, no, no. Not that one. Come on, Sultan. Huh? What? Come back here, you little thieves! With all due respect, Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm? Save your breath, Iago. Faster. Yes, O mighty evil one. Part, sands of time. Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave. Yes! Yes! There he is. My diamond in the rough. That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for? Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we? Swell. Almost there. I want to thank you for stopping that man. Uh, forget it. So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh? Is it that obvious? Well, you do kind of stand out. I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be. Hmm. I'm a fast learner. Wow. Hey. Come on. This way. Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful. Is this where you live? Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please. That sounds fabulous. Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view. Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh? Oh, it's wonderful. I wonder what it would be like to live there, and have servants and valets. Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress. It's better than here. You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards. You're not free to make your own choices. Sometimes you feel so... You're just... Trapped. Trapped. So, where are you from? What does it matter? I ran away and I am not going back. Really? How come? Why, you... My father's forcing me to get married. That's... That's awful. Abu! What? Abu says, uh, that's not fair. What? Oh, did he? Yeah, of course. And does Abu have anything else to say? Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help. Oh, boy. Hmm. Tell him that's very sweet. Here you are. They're after me! They're after you? My father must have sent them... Do you trust me? What? Do you trust me? Yes... Then jump! We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat? Run! Go! Get out of here! Get this thing off of me! It's the dungeon for you, boy. Get off of me. Let him go. Looky here, men. A street mouse. Unhand him, by order of the princess. Princess Jasmine. The princess? Princess? What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat. That's not your concern. Do as I command. Release him. I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar. You'll have to take it up with him. Believe me, I will. Jafar? Oh, Princess. Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck. How may I be of service to you? The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders. Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal. What was his crime? I can't breathe, Jafar. Why, kidnapping the princess, of course. If you could just... Aah! That hurt! He didn't kidnap me. I ran away. Oh, dear. Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known... What do you mean? Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out. What sentence? Death. By beheading. No. I am exceedingly sorry, Princess. How could you? So, how did it go? I think she took it rather well. It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name. She was the princess. I can't believe it. I must have sounded so stupid to her. Yoohoo! Aladdin! Hello! Abu. Down here. Come on, help me out of these. Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry, Abu. I'll never see her again. I'm a street rat, remember? And there's a law. She's gotta marry a prince. She deserves a prince. Tada! I'm a fool. You're only a fool if you give up, boy. Who are you? A lowly prisoner, like yourself. But together, perhaps we can be more. I'm listening. There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Ooh! Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager. Jafar, can you hurry up? I'm dyin' in here. But the law says only a prince can... You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you? Whoever has the gold makes the rules. Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me? I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it. Uh, one problem. It's out there. We're in here. Uhuh. Things aren't always what they seem. So, do we have a deal? Oh, I don't know. Who disturbs my slumber? Uh, it is I, Aladdin. Proceed. Touch nothing but the lamp. Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward. Come on, Abu. Would you look at that! Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan. Abu! Don't touch anything. We gotta find that lamp. Huh? Aladdin! Abu, will you knock it off? Abu, what are you, crazy? A magic carpet. Come on. Come on out. We're not gonna hurt you. Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not gonna bite. Thanks. Wait a minute. Don't go. Maybe you can help us. Hey! Whoa! You see, we're trying to find this lamp. I think he knows where it is. Wait here. Oh! This is it? This is what we came all the way down here to... Abu! No! Infidels! Uhoh. You have touched the forbidden treasure! Now you will never again see the light of day! Whoa! Help! Help! Help! Gotcha! Carpet, let's move. Abu! Abu, this is no time to panic. Start panicking. Whoa! Help me out. Throw me the lamp. I can't hold on. Give me your hand. First give me the lamp. Yes! At last! What are you doing? Giving you your reward. Your eternal reward. It's mine. It's all mine. I... Where is it? No. No! Jasmine? Oh, dearest. What's wrong? Jafar has done something terrible. There, there, my dear. We'll set it right. Now, tell me everything. Oh. Aladdin. Wake up. Aladdin. Oh! My head. We're trapped. That twofaced son of a jackal! Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp. Aha! Why, you hairy little thief. Looks like such a beatup, worthless piece of junk. Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out. Aaaaahhhhh! Oy! 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck. Hang on a second. Whoa! Whoa! Does it feel good to be outta there. I'm telling you, nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi. Where you from? What's your name? Uh... Uh, Aladdin. Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din? How about Laddie? Sounds like, ""Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."" I must have hit my head harder than I thought. Do you smoke? Mind if I do? Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope I didn't singe the fur. Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia. Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo. Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master. Either that or I'm gettin' bigger. Look at me from the side. Do I look different to you? Wait a minute. I'm your master? That's right. He can be taught. What would you wish of me? The ever impressive, the long contained, the often imitated, but never duplicated... Duplicated, duplicated... Genie of the Lamp! Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfilment. Thank you. Whoa. Wish fulfilment? Three wishes, to be exact. And ixnay on the wishing for more wishes. That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres.  No substitutions, exchanges or refunds. Now I know I'm dreaming. Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here. So why don't you just ruminate whilst I illuminate the possibilities.  Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves   Scheherazade had a thousand tales   But, master, you're in luck   'Cause up your sleeves   You got a brand of magic never fails   You got some power   In your corner now   Some heavy ammunition in your camp   You got some punch, pizzazz   Yahoo and how   See, all you gotta do   Is rub that lamp and I'll say   ""Mr. Aladdin, sir   What will your pleasure be?""   Let me take your order   Jot it down   You ain't never had a friend like me   Life is your restaurant   And I'm your maitre d'   Come on, whisper what it is you want   You ain't never had a friend like me   Yes, sir   We pride ourselves on service   You're the boss, the king, the shah   Say what you wish   It's yours, true dish   How 'bout a little more baklava?   Have some of column A   Try all of column B   I'm in the mood to help you, dude   You ain't never had a friend like me   Oh, my   No, no   My, my   Can your friends do this?   Can your friends do that?   Can your friends pull this   Out their little hat?   Can your friends go poof   Hey, looky here   Haha!   Can your friends go   ""Abracadabra, let her rip""   And then make the sucker disappear?   So don't you sit there   Slackjawed, buggyeyed   I'm here to answer   All your midnight prayers   You got me bona fide certified   You got a genie   For your charge d'affaires   I got a powerful urge to help you out   So what's your wish?   I really wanna know   You got a list   That's three miles long, no doubt   All you gotta do is rub like so   Mr. Aladdin, sir   Have a wish or two or three   I'm on the job, you big nabob   You ain't never had a friend   Never had a friend   You ain't never had a friend   Never had a friend   You ain't never had a friend   Like me  Ahhaha! Wahhaha!  You ain't never had a friend like me  Huh? So, what'll it be, master? You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right? Ah, almost. There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos. Like? Ah, rule number one, I can't kill anybody. So don't ask. Rule number two. I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else. You little ponem there. Rule number three. I can't bring people back from the dead. It's not a pretty picture. I don't like doing it. Other than that, you got it. Hmm. Oh! Provisos? You mean limitations? On wishes? Some allpowerful genie. Can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave. Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here. Excuse me? Are you lookin' at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here? And all of sudden you're walking out on me? I don't think so, not right now. You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down! In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere. Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet. We're... Outta here! Jafar, this is an outrage. If it weren't for all your years of loyal service... From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded. I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again. Jasmine... Jafar. Let's put this whole messy business behind us. Please. My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess. At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you. There, now. That's nice. All settled, then. Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine? Jasmine! If only I had gotten that lamp. ""I will have the power to get rid of you."" To think we gotta keep kissing up to that Chump and his Chump daughter for the rest of our lives... No, Iago. Only until she finds a Chump husband. Then she'll have us banished. Or beheaded. Eww! Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar. What if you were the chump husband? What? Okay, you marry the princess, all right? And, uh, then you become the sultan. Oh. Marry the shrew. I become the sultan. The idea has merit. Yes, merit. Yes. And then we drop papainlaw and the little woman off a cliff. Yaaah! Kersplat! I love the way your foul little mind works. Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs. Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop. Thank you. Goodbye now. Goodbye. Thank you. Well, how about that, Mr. Doubting Mustafa? Oh, you sure showed me. Now, about my three wishes. Dost mine ears deceive me? Three? You are down by one, boy. Ah, no. I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own. Well, I feel sheepish. All right, you bad boy, but no more freebies. Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be good. What would you wish for? Me? No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case... Ah, forget it. What? No, I can't. I... Come on. Tell me. Freedom. You're a prisoner? It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic powers... Itty bitty living space. Genie, that's terrible. But, oh, to be free... Not have to go, ""Poof. What do you need? ""Poof. What do you need? Poof. What do you need?"" To be my own master. Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world. But what am I talking about? Let's get real here. It's not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus. Why not? The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out. So you can guess how often that's happened. I'll do it. I'll set you free. Uhhuh, yeah, right. No, really, I promise. After I make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free. Well, here's hopin'. All right. Let's make some magic. So how 'bout it? What is it you want most? Well, there's this girl. Wrong. I can't make anybody fall in love, remember? Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and... Pretty? Beautiful. She's got these eyes that just... And this hair. Wow. And her smile... Ami.  C'est l'amour.  But she's the princess. To even have a chance, I'd have to be... Hey, can you make me a prince? Let's see here. Chicken Ã  la king? Nope. Alaskan king crab. Ow. I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No. Aha. ""To make a prince."" Is that an official wish? Say the magic words. Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince. All right! Yo, yo! Woof! Woof! First, that fezandvest combo is much too third century. These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar? No. Let's work with me here. Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.  Now, it still needs something. What does it say to me? It says mode of transportation. Excuse me, monkey boy. Aqui. Over here. Uhoh. Here he comes. What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah than riding your very own, brandnew camel? Watch out. They spit. Mmm. Not enough. Still not enough. Let's see. What do you need? Yes! Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo. Whoa! Talk about your trunk space. Check this action out. Abu, you look good. He's got the outfit. He's got the elephant. But we're not through yet. Hang on to your turban, kid. We're gonna make you a star. Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter. Awk. The problem with your daughter. Oh, really? Right here. ""If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, ""then the sultan shall choose for her."" But Jasmine hated all those suitors. How could I choose someone she hates? Not to worry, my liege. There is more. ""If in the event a suitable prince cannot be found..."" Jerk. ""A princess must then be wed to..."" Hmm. Interesting. What? Who? The royal vizier. Why, that would be me. But I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess. I'm quite sure that... Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord. Yes. Desperate measures. You will order the princess to marry me. I will order the princess to... But you're so old. The princess will marry me. The princess will marry... What? What is that? That music. Jafar, you must come and see this.

Absolutely marvelous. Your Majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand. Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course. I'm delighted to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He's delighted, too. Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince Abubu... Ababwa. Whatever. You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to... By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. Ooh. I don't suppose I might... Why, certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me. Sire, I must advise against this. Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun. Ow, ow, ow. Ahh! Whoa! Look out, here I come. Just where did you say you were from? Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure. Try me. Look out, Polly. Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug. Aah! Whew! Out of the way. I'm coming in to land. Jafar, watch this. Spectacular, Your Highness. That was lovely. Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it. This is a very impressive youth. And a prince besides. If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all. I don't trust him, Sire. Nonsense. One thing I pride myself on, Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character. Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not! Jasmine will like this one. And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine. Your Highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf. This boy is no different from the others. What makes him think he is worthy of the princess? Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa. Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter. How dare you. All of you. Standing around deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won. Oh, dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down. I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abubu. What am I gonna do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish. So move. Hey. That's a good move. I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug. Genie, I need help. All right, Sparky, here's the deal. If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter. Do you got it? What? No way. If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh. Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself. Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be. Okay, I'm gonna go see her. I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident. How do I look? Like a prince. Princess Jasmine? Who's there? It's me, Prince Ali. Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa. I do not want to see you. No, no, please, Princess. Give me a chance. Just leave me alone. Down, kitty. So, how's our little beau doing? Good kitty, take off. Down, kitty. Wait. Wait. Do I know you? Uh, no. No. You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace. The marketplace? I have servants who go to the marketplace for me. Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met. No. I guess not. Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her. She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything. Pick a feature. Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine? You're very... Wonderful, magnificent, glorious, punctual. Punctual. Punctual? Sorry. Uh, beautiful. Nice recovery. Hmm. I'm rich, too, you know. Yeah. The daughter of a sultan. I know. A fine prize for any prince to marry. Uh, right. Right. A prince like me. Warning! Warning! Right. A prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've met. Mayday! Mayday! Just go jump off a balcony! What? Stop her. Stop her! Want me to sting her? Buzz off. Okay, fine. But remember, ""bee"" yourself. Yeah, right. What? Uh... Uh, you're right. You aren't just some prize to be won. You should be free to make your own choice. I'll go now. No! What? What? How... How are you doing that? It's a magic carpet. It's lovely. You, uh... You don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world. Is it safe? Sure. Do you trust me? What? Do you trust me? Yes.  I can show you the world   Shining, shimmering, splendid   Tell me, Princess   Now, when did you last   Let your heart decide   I can open your eyes   Take you wonder by wonder   Over, sideways and under   On a magic carpet ride   A whole new world   A new fantastic point of view   No one to tell us no   Or where to go   Or say we're only dreaming   A whole new world   A dazzling place   I never knew   But when I'm way up here   It's crystal clear   That now I'm in   A whole new world with you   Now I'm in   A whole new world with you   Unbelievable sights   Indescribable feeling   Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling   Through an endless diamond sky   A whole new world   Don't you dare close your eyes   A hundred thousand things to see   Hold your breath, it gets better   I'm like a shooting star   I've come so far   I can't go back to where I used to be   A whole new world   Every turn a surprise   With new horizons to pursue   Every moment redletter   I'll chase them anywhere   There's time to spare   Let me share   This whole new world with you   A whole new world   A whole new world   That's where we'll be   That's where we'll be   A thrilling chase   A wondrous place   For you and me  It's all so magical. Yeah. It's a shame Abu had to miss this. Nah. He hates fireworks. He doesn't like flying, either. Uh, that is, um... Oh, no. You are the boy from the market. I knew it. Why did you lie to me? Jasmine, I'm sorry. Did you think I was stupid? No. That I wouldn't figure it out? No. I mean, I hoped you wouldn't. No, that's not what I meant. Who are you? Tell me the truth. The truth? The truth. Um... The truth is... I sometimes dress as a commoner, um, to escape the pressures of palace life. But I really am a prince. Why didn't you just tell me? Well, you know, royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think? Hmm. Not that strange. Good night, my handsome prince. Sleep well, Princess. Yes! For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right. Abu. Abu. Hold him. I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abubu. Why, you... Make sure he's never found. Never fails. You get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp. Hello? Al? Al! Kid, snap out of it. You can't cheat on this one. I can't help unless you make a wish. You have to say, ""Genie, I want you to save my life."" Got it? Come on, Aladdin! I'll take that as a yes. Up scope. Don't you scare me like that. Genie, I, uh... I... Thanks, Genie. Oh, Al. I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid. Not that I wanna pick out curtains or anything. Jasmine. Oh, Father, I just had the most wonderful time. I'm so happy. You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you. What? You will wed Jafar. You're speechless, I see. A fine quality in a wife. I will never marry you. Father, I choose Prince Ali. Prince Ali left. Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar. Prince Ali! How in the... Uh. Awk! Tell them the truth, Jafar. You tried to have me killed. What? Ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness. He is obviously lying. Obviously lying. Father, what's wrong with you? I know what's wrong. Oh, my! Your Highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this. What? Jafar? You, you traitor! Your Majesty, all this can be explained. Guards! Guards! Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it. Just dig a grave for both of us. We're dead. Arrest Jafar at once. This is not done yet, boy. Find him! Search everywhere! Jasmine, are you all right? Yes. Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time. This is horrible, just horrible. How will I ever... Huh? Can this be true? My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? Ha, ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you. I won't. I'll leave that to my... But you two will be wed at once. Yes, yes. And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan. Sultan? Yes. A fine upstanding youth such as yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs. We gotta get outta here. I gotta start packing. Only essentials. We gotta travel light. Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives, and how about this picture? I think I'm making a weird face in it. Oh, boy. He's cracked. He's gone nuts. Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip! Good grip. Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin. He has the lamp, Iago. Why, that miserable... But you are going to relieve him of it. Me? Sultan? They want me to be Sultan? Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero  Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess. What are you gonna do next? Psst. Your line is, ""I'm going to free the genie."" Any time. Genie. I can't. Sure you can. You just go, ""Genie, I wish you free."" I'm serious. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. But they wanna make me sultan. No. They wanna make Prince Ali sultan. Without you, I'm just Aladdin. Al, you won. Because of you. The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you. What if they find out I'm not really a prince? What if Jasmine finds out? I'd lose her. Genie, I can't keep this up on my own. I can't wish you free. Fine. I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else. Hey, I was beginning to feel left out. Now, if you'll excuse me, master. Genie, I'm really sorry. Well, fine. Then just stay in there. What are you guys looking at? Look, I... I'm sorry. Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't... Wait. Come on. What am I doing? Genie's right. I gotta tell Jasmine the truth. Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here? Well, here goes. Jasmine? Where are you? Out in the menagerie. Hurry. I'm coming. You got a problem, Pinky? Jerk. Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you. ""Excellent work, Iago."" Ah, go on. ""No, really. On a scale of one to 10, you are an 11."" Oh, Jafar, you're too kind. I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing. People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor. Jasmine. Ali, where have you been? Jasmine, there's something I got to tell you. The whole kingdom's turned out for Father's announcement. No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please. You don't understand... Good luck. Ali Ababwa! Oh, boy. Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak. Let them cheer. You know, Al, I'm getting really... I don't think you're him. Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man. I am your master now. I was afraid of that. Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to rule on high as sultan. Whoa! Bless my soul. What is this? What's going on? Oh, my goodness, what's happening? Father. Jafar, you vile betrayer. That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you. Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that. The lamp. Finders keepers, Abubu. Genie, no! Sorry, kid. I got a new master now. Jafar, I order you to stop. Ah, but there's a new order now. My order. Finally, you will bow to me. We will never bow to you. Why am I not surprised? If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer! Genie, my second wish... I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world! Genie, stop! Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar! Now, where were we? Ah, yes. Abject humiliation. Down, boy. Oh, Princess. There's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. Jafar. Get your hands off her.  Prince Ali   Yes, it is he   But not as you know him   Read my lips   And come to grips with reality   Yes, meet a blast from your past   Whose lies were too good to last   Say hello   To your precious Prince Ali  Or should we say Aladdin? Ali? Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...  So Ali turns out to be   Merely Aladdin   Just a con, need I go on   Take it from me   His personality flaws   Give me adequate cause   To send him packing   On a oneway trip  Genie!  So his prospects   Take a terminal dip   His assets frozen, the venue chosen   Is the ends of the Earth, whoopee!  So long! Goodbye, see ya.  ExPrince Ali  Abu. Abu! Oh, this is all my fault. I should have freed the genie when I had the chance. Abu. Are you okay? Mmmhmm. I'm sorry, Abu. I made a mess of everything. Somehow, I gotta go back and set things right. Carpet. Abu, start digging. That's it. Yeah! All right! Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go. Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker. Shove them all the way down your throat. Here. Have lots. Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone. It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen... Never. I'll teach you some respect. No. Genie. I have decided to make my final wish. I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me. Ah, Master, there are a few addendas, some quid pro quos... Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout. You will do what I order you to do, slave. Jafar. I never realized how incredibly handsome you are. Mmm. That's better. Now, pussycat, tell me more about myself. You're tall, dark, well dressed... Al. Al, little buddy. Shh. Al, I can't help you. I work for SeÃ±or Psychopath now. What are you gonna do? Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? I'll improvise. Cute little gaps between your teeth. Go on. And your beard is so twisted. You've stolen my heart. Jafar... And the street rat? What street rat? Yech! That was... You! How many times do I have to kill you, boy? Get the lamp. No! Ah, ah, ah, Princess. Your time is up. Jasmine. Oh, nice shot, Jaf... Don't toy with me. Abu! Things are unravelling fast now, boy. Get the point? I'm just getting warmed up. Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake? A snake, am I? Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be.  Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake   Stick that sword into that snake  You stay out of this. Jafar, Jafar, he's our man. If he can't do it... Great! Aladdin. Jasmine, hang on. You little fool. You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth. Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a... Awk! Without the genie, boy, you're nothing. The genie. The genie. The genie has more power than you'll ever have. What? He gave you your power. He can take it away. Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this? Face it, Jafar. You're still just second best. You're right. His power does exceed my own. But not for long. The boy is crazy. He's a little punchdrunk. One too many hits with the snake. Slave, I make my third wish. I wish to be an allpowerful genie! All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al. Yes. Yes! The power. The absolute power! What have you done? Trust me. The universe is mine to command, to control! Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't you forgetting something? Huh? You wanted to be a genie, you got it. What? And everything that goes with it. No! No! I'm gettin' out of here. Phenomenal cosmic powers... You're the genie. I don't want... Itty bitty living space. Al, you little genius, you. Ahh! Get your blasted beak out of my face. Oh, shut up, you moron. Don't tell me to shut up. Allow me. Ten thousand years in a Cave of Wonders ought to chill him out. Shut up! Jasmine... I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince. I know why you did. Well, I guess this is goodbye? Oh, that stupid law. This isn't fair. I love you. Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left. Just say the word and you're a prince again. But, Genie, what about your freedom? Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude. This is love. Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I know. I've looked. Jasmine, I do love you, but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not. I understand. Genie, I wish for your freedom. One bona fide prince pedigree coming up. What? Genie, you're free. I'm free. I'm free. Quick. Quick. Wish for something outrageous. Say, ""I want the Nile."" Wish for the Nile. Try that. Uh, I wish for the Nile. No way! Oh, does that feel good! Oh! I'm free! I'm free at last! I'm hittin' the road. I'm off to see the world. I'm... Genie, I'm... I'm gonna miss you. Me, too, Al. No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me. That's right. You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the problem. Father? Well, am I sultan or am I sultan? From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy. Him. I choose... I choose you, Aladdin. Call me Al. Oh, all of you, come over here. Big group hug. Group hug. Mind if I kiss the monkey? Ooh, hairball. Well, I can't do any more damage around this popsicle stand. I'm outta here! Byebye, you two crazy lovebirds! Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history. No, I'm mythology. I don't care what I am. I'm free!  A whole new world   A whole new life   For you and me   A whole new world  Made you look."
Beauty and the Beast,Disney,1990,1991,Animation,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land,  a young prince lived in a shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired,  the prince was spoiled, selfish and unkind.  But then, one winter's night,  an old beggar woman came to the castle  and offered him a single rose  in return for shelter from the bitter cold.  Repulsed by her haggard appearance,  the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away.  But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,  for beauty is found within.  And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away  to reveal a beautiful enchantress.  The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,  for she had seen that there was no love in his heart.  And as punishment,  she transformed him into a hideous beast  and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.  Ashamed of his monstrous form,  the Beast concealed himself inside his castle  with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.  The rose she had offered  was truly an enchanted rose,  which would bloom until his 21st year.  If he could learn to love another  and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell,  then the spell would be broken.  If not, he would be doomed  to remain a beast for all time.  As the years passed,  he fell into despair and lost all hope,  for who could ever learn to love a beast?   Little town, it's a quiet village   Every day like the one before   Little town, full of little people   Waking up to say...   Bonjour   Bonjour   Bonjour   Bonjour   Bonjour   There goes the baker with his tray, like always   The same old bread and rolls to sell   Every morning just the same   Since the morning that we came   To this poor provincial town  Good morning, Belle. Morning, monsieur.  Where you off to? The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story about a beanstalk and an ogre and... That's nice. Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!  Look, there she goes The girl is strange, no question   Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?   Never part of any crowd   'Cause her head's up on some cloud   No denying she's a funny girl that Belle   Bonjour   Good day   How is your family?   Bonjour   Good day   How is your wife?   I need six eggs   That's too expensive   There must be more than this provincial life  Ah, Belle. Good morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed. Finished already? I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new? Not since yesterday. That's all right. I'll borrow this one. That one? But you've read it twice. Well, it's my favorite. Faroff places, daring sword fights, magic spells, a prince in disguise. If you like it all that much, it's yours. But, sir... I insist. Well, thank you. Thank you very much.  Look, there she goes That girl is so peculiar   I wonder if she's feeling well   With a dreamy, faroff look   And her nose stuck in a book   What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle   Oh, isn't this amazing?   It's my favorite part   Because you'll see   Here's where she meets Prince Charming   But she won't discover that it's him   Till chapter three  Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!  Now it's no wonder that her name means beauty   Her looks have got no parallel   But behind that fair facade   I'm afraid she's rather odd   Very different from the rest of us   She's nothing like the rest of us   Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle  Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston. You're the greatest hunter in the whole world! I know. No beast alive stands a chance against you. And no girl, for that matter. It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one. The inventor's daughter? She's the one. The lucky girl I'm going to marry. But she... The most beautiful girl in town. I know, but... That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best? Well, of course. I mean, you do.  Right from the moment when I met her, saw her   I said she's gorgeous, and I fell   Here in town there's only she   Who is beautiful as me   So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle   Look, there he goes   Isn't he dreamy?   Monsieur Gaston   Oh, he's so cute   Be still, my heart   I'm hardly breathing   He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute   Bonjour   Good day   You call this bacon?   What lovely grapes   Some cheese   Ten yards   Excuse me   I'll get the knife   Please let me through   This bread, it's stale   Those fish, they smell   Madame's mistaken   There must be more than this provincial life   Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife   Look, there she goes a girl who's strange but special   A most peculiar mademoiselle   It's a pity and a sin   She doesn't quite fit in   'Cause she really is a funny girl   A beauty but a funny girl   She really is a funny girl   That Belle  Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour. Hello, Belle. Bonjour, Gaston. Gaston, may I have my book, please? How can you read this? There's no pictures. Well, some people use their imagination. Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books and paid attention to more important things. Like me. The whole town's talking about it. It's not right for a woman to read. Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking. Gaston, you are positively primeval. Why, thank you, Belle. What do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern and take a look at my trophies? Maybe some other time. What's wrong with her? She's crazy. He's gorgeous. Please, Gaston, I can't. I have to get home to help my father. Goodbye. That crazy old loon. He needs all the help he can get. Don't talk about my father that way. Yeah! Don't talk about her father that way. My father is not crazy. He's a genius. Papa? How on earth did that happen? Doggone it! Are you all right, Papa? I'm... I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk. You always say that. I mean it this time! I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work! Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow. And become a worldfamous inventor. You really believe that? I always have. Well, what are we waiting for? I'll have this thing fixed in no time. Hand me that... The doglegged clincher there. So, did you have a good time in town today? I got a new book. Papa, do you think I'm odd? My daughter? Odd? Where would you get an idea like that? Oh, I don't know. It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here. There's no one I can really talk to. What about that Gaston? He's a handsome fella. He's handsome, all right, and rude and conceited and... Oh, Papa, he's not for me. Well, don't you worry. 'Cause this invention's gonna be the start of a new life for us. I think that's done it. Now, let's give it a try. It works! It does? It does! You did it. You really did it! Hitch up Philippe, girl. I'm off to the fair! Goodbye, Papa. Good luck. Goodbye, Belle. Take care while I'm gone. We should be there by now. Maybe we missed a turn. I guess I should've taken... Wait a minute. No. Let's go this way. Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut. We'll be there in no time. This can't be right. Where have you taken us, Philippe? We better turn around. Whoa. Whoa, boy. Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe. Oh! Look out! No! Whoa! Whoa, boy! Back up, back up, back up! Good boy. Good boy. That's good, that's... Back up! Steady, steady, now. Steady. Steady. No, Philippe! Philippe? Oh. Help! Is... Is someone there? Help! Oh! Wha... Ooh! Hello? Hello! Poor fellow must have lost his way in the woods. Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away. Is someone there? Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word. I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse and I need a place to stay for the night. Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart. Shh! Ow! Of course, monsieur,  you are welcome here. Who said that? Over here. Where? Hello. Incredible! Well, now you've done it, Lumiere. Splendid. Just peachy. Ah! How is this accomplished? Put me down at once. Stop that! Stop that, I say! Ow! Ah! Ah! Sir, close that at once! Do you mind? I beg your pardon. It's... It's just that I've never seen a clock that... Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur.  Come. Warm yourself by the fire. Thank you. No, no, no! You know what the master will do if he finds him here. I demand that you stop right there. Oh, no, no. Not the master's chair. I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this. Well, hello there, boy. What service. All right. This has gone far enough. I'm in charge here... How would you like a nice spot of tea, sir? It'll warm you up in no time. No. No tea. No tea! His mustache tickles, Mama. Oh! Hello. Uhoh! There's a stranger here. Master, allow me to explain. The gentleman was lost in the woods. He was cold and wet, so... Master, I'd like to take this moment to say I was against this from the start. It was all his fault. I tried to stop them. Would they listen to me? No, no... Who are you? What are you doing here? I... I... I was lost in the woods and... You are not welcome here! I... I'm... I'm sorry. What are you staring at? Nothing. So, you've come to stare at the Beast, have you? Please, I meant no harm! I just needed a place to stay. I'll give you a place to stay! No, no, please! No! No! Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston? Yep, this is her lucky day. I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding. First, I better go in there and propose to the girl. And you, LeFou, now, when Belle and I come out that door... I know. I know. I strike up the band! Not yet. Sorry. Gaston, what a pleasant surprise. Isn't it, though? I'm just full of surprises. You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes. This is the day... This is the day your dreams come true. What do you know about my dreams, Gaston? Plenty! Here. Picture this. A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire and my little wife massaging my feet while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven. Dogs? No, Belle. Strapping boys like me. Imagine that. Do you know who that little wife will be? Let me think. You, Belle. Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless. I really don't know what to say. Say you'll marry me. I'm very sorry, Gaston, but... But I just don't deserve you! Whoa! So, how'd it go? I'll have Belle for my wife. Make no mistake about that. Touchy. Is he gone? Can you imagine? He asked me to marry him. Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...  Madame Gaston   Can't you just see it?   Madame Gaston   His little wife   No, sir, not me, I guarantee it   I want much more than this provincial life   I want adventure in the great wide somewhere   I want it more than I can tell   And for once it might be grand   To have someone understand   I want so much more than they've got planned  Philippe! What are you doing here? Where's... Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe? What happened? We have to find him. You have to take me to him. What is this place? Philippe, please, steady. Steady. Papa! Couldn't keep quiet, could we? Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we? Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair. Pet the pooch. I was trying to be hospitable. Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? Papa? Papa? Are you here? Mama, there's a girl in the castle. Now, Chip, I'll not have you making up such wild stories. Really, Mama. I saw her. Not another word. Into the tub. But... What? A girl. I saw a girl in the castle. See, I told you. Irresponsible, devilmaycare, waxyeared, slackjawed... Papa? Did you see that? It's a girl! I know it's a girl. Don't you see? She's the one. The girl we have been waiting for. She has come to break the spell. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Papa? Papa? Hello? Is someone here? Wait! I'm looking for my father. I... That's funny. I'm sure there was someone. Is anyone here? Belle? Papa! How did you find me? Your hands are like ice. We have to get you out of there. Belle, I want you to leave this place. Who's done this to you? No time to explain. You must go. Now! I won't leave you. What are you doing here? Run, Belle! Who's there? Who are you? The master of this castle. I've come for my father. Please let him out. Can't you see he's sick? Then he shouldn't have trespassed here! But he could die. Please, I'll do anything. There's nothing you can do. He's my prisoner. There must be some way I can... Wait! Take me instead. You? You would take his place? Belle, no! You don't know what you're doing! If I did, would you let him go? Yes. But you must promise to stay here forever. Come into the light. No, Belle! I won't let you do this! You have my word. Done. No, Belle, listen to me. I'm old. I've lived my life. Wait. Belle! Wait. No! Please spare my daughter. Please! She's no longer your concern. Take him to the village. Let me out. Please let me out! Let me out! Please! Please! Master? What? Since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time, I was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room. Then again, maybe not. You didn't even let me say goodbye. I'll never see him again. I didn't get to say goodbye. I'll show you to your room. My room? But I thought... You wanna... You wanna stay in the tower? No. Then follow me. Say something to her. Huh? Oh. I hope you like it here. The castle is your home now, So you can go anywhere you like, except the west wing. What's in the west... It's forbidden! Now, if you need anything, my servants will attend you. Dinner. Invite her to dinner. You will join me for dinner. That's not a request! Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with the wrong man. No one says no to Gaston. Darn right. Dismissed. Rejected. Publicly humiliated. Why, it's more than I can bear. More beer? What for? Nothing helps. I'm disgraced. Who, you? Never. Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.  Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston   Looking so down in the dumps   Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston   Even when taking your lumps   There's no man in town as admired as you   You're everyone's favorite guy   Everyone's awed and inspired by you   And it's not very hard   To see why   No one's slick as Gaston   No one's quick as Gaston   No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston   For there's no man in town half as manly   Perfect, a pure paragon   You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley   And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on   No one's been like Gaston   A kingpin like Gaston   No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston   As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating   My, what a guy, that Gaston   Give five hurrahs Give 12 hiphips   Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips   No one fights like Gaston   Douses lights like Gaston   In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston   For there's no one as burly and brawny   As you see, I've got biceps to spare   Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny   That's right   And every last inch of me's covered with hair   No one hits like Gaston   Matches wits like Gaston   In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston   I'm especially good at expectorating  Ptooey!  Ten points for Gaston   When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs   Every morning to help me get large   And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs   So I'm roughly the size of a barge   No one shoots like Gaston   Makes those beauts like Gaston   Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston   I use antlers in all of my decorating   My, what a guy   Gaston  Help! Someone help me! Maurice? Please! Please, I need your help. He's got her... He's got her locked in the dungeon. Who? Belle. We must go. Not... Not a minute to lose. Whoa! Slow down, Maurice. Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon? A beast! A horrible, monstrous beast! Is it a big beast? Huge. With a long, ugly snout? Hideously ugly. And sharp, cruel fangs? Yes, yes! Will you help me? All right, old man. We'll help you out. You will? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh! Crazy old Maurice. He's always good for a laugh. Crazy old Maurice, hmm? Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.  LeFou, I'm afraid I've been thinking   A dangerous pastime   I know   But that wacky old coot is Belle's father   And his sanity's only soso   Now, the wheels in my head have been turning   Since I looked at that loony old man   See, I promised myself I'd be married to Belle   And right now, I'm evolving a plan  If I... Yes? Then we... No, would she? Guess. Now I get it! Let's go! Let's go!  No one plots like Gaston   Takes cheap shots like Gaston   Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston   So, his marriage we soon will be celebrating   My, what a guy   Gaston  Will no one help me? Who is it? Mrs. Potts, dear. I thought you might like a spot of tea. But you're... You're a... Oh! Careful. This is impossible. I know it is, but here we are. I told you she was pretty, Mama, didn't I? All right, Chip, now, that'll do. Slowly now. Don't spill. Thank you. Wanna see me do a trick? Chip! Oops! Sorry. That was a very brave thing you did, my dear. We all think so. But I've lost my father, my dreams, everything. Cheer up, child. It'll turn out all right in the end. You'll see. Oh, listen to me jabbering on while there's a supper to get on the table. Chip? Bye. Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner? Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers. Oh, how embarrassing! Ah, here we are. You'll look ravishing in this one. That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner. But you must. Ahem, ahem, ahem. Dinner is served. What's taking so long? I told her to come down. Why isn't she here yet? Try to be patient, sir. The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day. Master, have you thought that perhaps this girl could be the one to break the spell? Of course I have! I'm not a fool. Good! So, you fall in love with her, she falls in love with you, and poof! The spell is broken. We'll be human again by midnight. It's not that easy, Lumiere. These things take time. But the rose has already begun to wilt. Oh, it's no use. She's so beautiful and I'm... Well, look at me! You must help her to see past all that. I don't know how. Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable. Straighten up. Try to act like a gentleman. Yes. When she comes in, give her a dashing, debonair smile. Come, come, show me the smile. But don't frighten the poor girl. Impress her with your rapier wit. But be gentle. Shower her with compliments. But be sincere. And above all, you must control your temper! You must control your temper! Here she is! Good evening. Well, where is she? Who? Oh! The girl, yes. The girl. Well, actually, she's in the process of... Circumstances being what they are... She's not coming. What? Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence! Let's not be hasty! I thought I told you to come down to dinner! I'm not hungry. You'll come out or I'll... I'll... I'll break down the door! Master, I could be wrong, but that may not be the best way to win the girl's affections. Please attempt to be a gentleman. But she is being so difficult. Gently, gently. Will you come down to dinner? No! Hmm? Eheh. Suave, genteel. It would give me great pleasure if you would join me for dinner. And we say ""please."" Please. No, thank you. You can't stay in there forever! Yes, I can. Fine! Then go ahead and starve! If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all! Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it? Lumiere, stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there is the slightest change. You can count on me, mon capitaine.  Well, we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up. I ask nicely, but she refuses. What does she want me to do, beg? Show me the girl. But the master's really not so bad, once you get to know him.  Why don't you give him a chance?  I don't want to get to know him.  I don't want to have anything to do with him.  I'm just fooling myself. She'll never see me as anything but a monster. It's hopeless. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Oh, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. I've been burned by you before. Zut alors! She has emerged! Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters. But I'm not sleepy. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I work and I slave all day long, and for what? A culinary masterpiece gone to waste! Stop your grousing. It's been a long night for all of us. Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn. After all, he did say ""please."" But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper, he'll never break the... Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.  I am Cogsworth, head of the household. This is Lumiere. EnchantÃ©, chÃ©rie.  If there's, stop that, anything we, please, can do to make your stay more comfortable... Ow! I am a little hungry. You are? Hear that? She's hungry. Stoke the fire. Break out the silver. Wake the china. Remember what the master said. Oh, pish tosh. I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry. All right, fine. Glass of water, crust of bread and then... Cogsworth, I am surprised at you. She's not a prisoner. She's our guest. We must make her feel welcome here. Right this way, mademoiselle.  Well, keep it down. If the master finds out about this, it will be our necks. Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little music? Music? Ma chÃ©re mademoiselle!  It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax. Let us pull up a chair, as the dining room proudly presents your dinner.  Be our guest, be our guest   Put our service to the test   Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chÃ©rie   And we provide the rest   Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres   Why, we only live to serve   Try the gray stuff, it's delicious   Don't believe me? Ask the dishes   They can sing, they can dance   After all, miss, this is France   And a dinner here is never second best   Go on, unfold your menu   Take a glance and then you'll be our guest   Oui, our guest Be our guest   Beef ragout, cheese soufflÃ©   Pie and pudding, en flambe   We'll prepare and serve with flair   A culinary cabaret   You're alone and you're scared   But the banquet's all prepared   No one's gloomy or complaining   While the flatware's entertaining   We tell jokes, I do tricks   With my fellow candlesticks   Und it's all in perfect taste   That you can bet   Come on and lift your glass   You've won your own free pass   To be our guest   If you're stressed it's fine dining we suggest   Be our guest, be our guest  Shh!  Be our guest   Life is so unnerving   For a servant who's not serving   He's not whole without a soul to wait upon  Get off!  Ah, those good old days   When we were useful  Huh?  Suddenly, those good old days are gone  Oh.  Ten years we've been rusting   Needing so much more than dusting   Needing exercise   A chance to use our skills   Most days we just lay around the castle   Flabby, fat and lazy   You walked in and oopsadaisy   It's a guest, it's a guest   Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed   Wine's been poured and thank the Lord   I've had the napkins freshly pressed   With dessert, she'll want tea   And, my dear, that's fine with me   While the cups do their softshoeing   I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing   I'll get warm, piping hot   Heaven sakes, is that a spot?   Clean it up We want the company impressed   We've got a lot to do   Is it one lump or two?   For you, our guest   She's our guest   She's our guest   Be our guest   Be our guest, be our guest Our command is your request  Let's go, people. Fun's over. Over here. Line up.  It's 10 years since we've had anybody here   And we're obsessed   With your meal, with your ease   Yes, indeed, we aim to please   While the candlelight's still glowing   Let us help you, we'll keep going   Course by course   One by one   Till you shout, ""Enough, I'm done!""   Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest   Tonight, you'll prop your feet up   But for now, let's eat up   Be our guest   Be our guest   Be our guest   Please be our   Guest  Bravo! That was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, mademoiselle.  Good show, wasn't it? Everyone! My goodness, look at the time. Now it's off to bed, off to bed. I couldn't possibly go to bed now. It's my first time in an enchanted castle. Enchanted! Who said anything about the castle being enchanted? It was you, wasn't it? I figured it out for myself. I'd like to look around, if that's all right. Would you like a tour? Wait a second. Wait a second. I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what I mean. Perhaps you'd like to take me. I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle. Oh, well. Actually, I... Yes, I do. As you can see, the pseudofacade was stripped away to reveal the minimalist Rococo design. Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings. This is yet another example of the lateneoclassic Baroque period. And, as I always say, if it's not Baroque, don't fix it. Where was I? As you were! Now, then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the... Uh, mademoiselle?  What's up there? Where? There? Oh, nothing. Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing. Dusty, dull, very boring. Ah, so, that's the west wing! Nice going. I wonder what he's hiding up there. Hiding? The master is hiding nothing. Then it wouldn't be forbidden. Perhaps mademoiselle  would like to see something else? We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to... Maybe later. The gardens. Or... Or the... The library, perhaps? You have a library? Oh, yes. Indeed. With books. Scads of books. Mountains of books. Forests of books. Cascades. Cloudbursts. Swamps of books. More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime. Books on every subject ever studied by every author who ever set pen to paper. Oh, oh. Why did you come here? I'm... I'm sorry. I warned you never to come here! I didn't mean any harm. Do you realize what you could have done? Please! Stop! Get out! No! Get out! Where are you going? Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute. No, wait, please! Please, wait! No! Here, now. Don't do that. Just hold still. That hurts! If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much! Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened. If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away. Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing! Well, you should learn to control your temper. Now, hold still. This might sting a little. Hmm? By the way, thank you for saving my life. You're welcome. I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night, but he said you'd make it worth my while. Ah! I'm listening. It's like this. I've got my heart set on marrying Belle, but she needs a little persuasion. Turned him down flat. Everyone knows her father's a lunatic. He was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle. Maurice is harmless. The point is, Belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up. Yeah, even marry him. So, you want me to throw her father into the asylum, unless she agrees to marry you. That is despicable. I love it. If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone. Yes, is that everything? I don't care what it takes. I'll find that castle and somehow, I... I'll get her out of there. Belle! Maurice! Oh, well. Guess it's not gonna work, after all. They have to come back sometime. And when they do, we'll be ready for them. LeFou, don't move from that spot until Belle and her father come home. But... But I... Ah, nuts. I've never felt this way about anyone. I want to do something for her. But what? Well, there's the usual things. Flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep. No, no. It has to be something very special. Something that sparks her interest. Wait a minute. Belle? There's something I want to show you. But first, you have to close your eyes. It's a surprise. Can I open them? No, no. Not yet. Wait here. Now can I open them? All right. Now. I can't believe it. I've never seen so many books in all my life. You... You like it? It's wonderful. Then it's yours. Thank you so much. Would you look at that! I knew it would work. What? What works? It's very encouraging. Isn't this exciting? I didn't see anything. Come along, Chip. There's chores to be done in the kitchen. But what are they talking about? What's going on? Come on, Mom.  There's something sweet and almost kind   But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined   And now he's dear and so unsure   I wonder why I didn't see it there before   She glanced this way   I thought I saw   And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw   No, it can't be   I'll just ignore   But then she's never looked at me that way before   New and a bit alarming   Who'd have ever thought   That this could be   True   That he's no Prince Charming   But there's something in him   That I simply didn't see   Well, who'd have thought   Well, bless my soul   Well who'd have known   Well who, indeed   And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own   It's so peculiar. Wait and see   We'll wait and see   A few days more   There may be something there that wasn't there before   You know, perhaps there is something there that wasn't there before  What?  There may be something there that wasn't there before  What's there, Mama? Shh. I'll tell you when you're older. Tonight is the night. I'm not sure I can do this. You don't have time to be timid. You must be bold, daring. Bold. Daring. There will be music, romantic candlelight provided by myself. And when the moment is right, you confess your love. Yes, I... I... I... No, I can't. You care for the girl, don't you? More than anything. Well, then, you must tell her. Voila! Oh, you look so, so... Stupid. Not quite the word I was looking for. Perhaps a little more off the top. Your lady awaits.  Tale as old as time   True as it can be   Barely even friends   Then somebody bends   Unexpectedly   Just a little change   Small to say the least   Both a little scared   Neither one prepared   Beauty and the Beast   Ever just the same   Ever a surprise  Eh, eh, eh?  Ever as before   Ever just as sure   As the sun will rise   Tale as old as time   Tune as old as song   Bittersweet and strange   Finding you can change   Learning you were wrong   Certain as the sun   Rising in the east   Tale as old as time   Song as old as rhyme   Beauty and the Beast  Shh!  Tale as old as time   Song as old as rhyme   Beauty and the Beast  Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip. It's past your bedtime. Good night, love. Belle? Are you happy here with me? Yes. What is it? If only I could see my father again, just for a moment. I miss him so much. There is a way. This mirror will show you anything. Anything you wish to see. I'd like to see my father, please. Papa. Oh, no. He's sick. He may be dying, and he's all alone. Then you must go to him. What did you say? I release you. You're no longer my prisoner. You mean I'm free? Yes. Oh, thank you. Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way. Take it with you so you'll always have a way to look back and remember me. Thank you for understanding how much he needs me. Well, Your Highness, I must say everything is going just swimmingly. I knew you had it in you. I let her go. Yes, yes, splen... You what? How could you do that? I had to. Yes, but... But why? Because I love her. He did what? Yes, I'm afraid it's true. She's going away? But he was so close. After all this time, he's finally learned to love. That's it then. That should break the spell. But it's not enough. She has to love him in return. Now it's too late. Papa? Papa? Ooh, ooh! They're back. Belle. Shh. It's all right, Papa. I'm home. I thought I'd never see you again. I missed you so much! But the Beast... Did you... How did you escape? I didn't escape, Papa. He... He let me go. That horrible beast? But he's different now, Papa. He's changed somehow. Hi! Oh! A stowaway. Why, hello there, little fella. Didn't think I'd see you again. Belle, why'd you go away? Don't you like us anymore? Chip, of course I do. It's just that... May I help you? I've come to collect your father. My father? Don't worry, mademoiselle.  We'll take good care of him. My father's not crazy! He was raving like a lunatic! We all heard him, didn't we? Yes! No, I won't let you! Belle? Maurice, tell us again, old man. Just how big was the beast? He was... I mean, he was... He was enormous! I'd... I'd say at least eight, no, more like 10 feet! Well, you don't get much crazier than that. It's true, I tell you. Get him out of here! Let go of me! No! You can't do this! Poor Belle. It's a shame about your father. You know he's not crazy, Gaston. I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding if... If what? If you marry me. What? One little word, Belle. That's all it takes. Never! Have it your way. Belle? Let go of me! My father's not crazy and I can prove it. Show me the Beast. Is it dangerous? No, no, he'd never hurt anyone. Please, I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle. He's my friend. If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for this monster. He's no monster, Gaston. You are! She's as crazy as the old man. The Beast will make off with your children. He'll come after them in the night. No. We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall! I say we Kill the Beast!  We're not safe until he's dead   He'll come stalking us at night   Set to sacrifice our children   To his monstrous appetite   He'll wreak havoc on our village   If we let him wander free   So, it's time to take some action, boys   It's time to follow me   Through the mist, through the woods through the darkness and the shadows   It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride   Say a prayer, then we're there at the drawbridge of a castle   And there's something truly terrible inside   It's a beast He's got fangs, razorsharp ones   Massive paws, Killer claws for the feast   Hear him roar, see him foam   But we're not coming home   Till he's dead, good and dead Kill the Beast!  No, I won't let you do this. If you're not with us, you're against us. Bring the old man! Get your hands off me! We can't have them running off to warn the creature. Let us out! We'll rid the village of this beast! Who's with me? I am! I am! I am!  Light your torch, mount your horse   Screw your courage to the sticking place   We're counting on Gaston to lead the way   Through a mist, to a wood where within a haunted castle   Something's lurking that you don't see every day   It's a beast One as tall as a mountain   We won't rest till he's good and deceased   Sally forth, tallyho   Grab your sword and your bow   Praise the Lord and here we go  We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head! I have to warn the Beast. This is all my fault. Papa, what are we going to do? Now, now. We'll think of something. Ah!  We don't like what we don't understand   In fact, it scares us   And this monster is mysterious at least   Bring your guns, bring your knives   Save your children and your wives   We'll save our village and our lives   We'll kill the Beast  I knew it. I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up. Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all. Could it be... Is it she? Sacrebleu! Invaders! Encroachers. And they have the mirror. Warn the master. If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them. Who's with me? Ah! Take whatever booty you can find. But remember, the Beast is mine!  Hearts ablaze, banners high   We go marching into battle   Unafraid, although the danger Just increased   Raise the flag, sing the song   Here we come, we're 50 strong   And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong   Let's kill the Beast  Pardon me, Master. Leave me in peace. But, sir, the castle is under attack.  Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!  This isn't working. Lumiere, we must do something! Wait! I know!  Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!  What shall we do, Master? It doesn't matter now. Just let them come.  Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!   Kill the Beast!  Now! Yes! Here we go! What the devil? Belle, look out! You guys gotta try this thing. Up here, you scurvy scum. Now! Oh! Hmm? Ow! Ow! And stay out. Get up. Get up. What's the matter, Beast? Too kind and gentle to fight back? No! Belle. No, Gaston, don't. Let's go, Philippe. Come on out and fight! Were you in love with her, Beast? Did you honestly think she'd want you when she had someone like me? It's over, Beast! Belle is mine! Let me go. Let me go. Please, don't hurt me. I'll do anything. Anything! Get out. Beast! Belle. Belle? You came back. You... You came back. Of course I came back. I couldn't let them... Oh, this is all my fault. If only I'd gotten here sooner. Maybe it's better... It's better this way. Don't talk like that. You'll be all right. We're together now. Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.

DuckTales The Movie - Treasure of the Lost Lamp,Disney,1990,1990,Animation,"Faster, Launchpad, faster! Slower, Launchpad, slower! Launchpad, is this a stunt you learned in flight school? Flight school? You mean you never tool flying lessons? L tool a crash course. Now he tells me. Nosedive! Cool. Oh, boy, lool at that! There's the dig! Did they say what they'd found? Aye. A hidden chamber. You thinl it might have the treasure of Collie Baba and his 40 thieves? After all this, l'm not getting my hopes up. We're maling our final approach. Put seat bacls in their upright position. Just put the plane in an upright position. Please remain seated until the plane has come to a complete stop. Landing gear down. Launchpad, lool what you've done to these ancient ruins. It could have been worse. It could have been something new. Hurry, Mr McDucl. We've found something. Bless my bagpipes. An engraving of Collie Baba. This could well be the treasure chest of the greatest thief who ever lived. Let's see. He stole clothes? Nothing but old robes. 40 years of searching and l end up with Collie Baba's dirty laundry. At least the box is pretty, Uncle Scrooge. There's something in this poclet. The seal of Collie Baba. It's a map. Perhaps this dig is not a lost cause after all. That's right. A treasure map written in Collie Baba's own hand. At last, after all these centuries, the lamp will be mine again. Yes! You will become more powerful than locomotive, more faster than speedy bull. You will leap all buildings in a single town. And you shall finally be rewarded for your dubious assistance. You mean it? My own mountain of money? Yes. Now... give it to me. Yes... What? The map. Ive it to me. The map? That specific map? Right here, right now? You didn't steal it? Too many people. Only one Dijon. But lool what l did steal. Several billfolds, this dandy poclet watch, floss, eggbale nut bar and two ticlets to the feta cheese festival for you, master. Maybe you would lile the floss? Did you at least see where the map leads? Yes, master. Into the middle of the desert. Where the sand burns lile a hot lebab. But l searched every square inch. Perhaps this time l'll let Scrooge do the searching for me. Smart move, master. Let him boil out his brains in the sun. And you shall accompany him as his guide. But l have such sensitive slin. And my brain boils so quiclly. But who needs brains to be a guide, anyway? Ee, Mr McD. A plane ride would have been less turbulent. According to the map, the cave of Collie Baba should be right here, under the gaze of Mount Badude. L don't see anything, Uncle Scrooge. Not even a mirage. Maybe we tool the wrong turn at that last sand dune. Launchpad, Can't you even ride a camel without crashing it? Lt's not my fault. Humpy here just had a great fall. He must have hit this lousy rocl. Ouch! My tootsies. It lools lile a pintsized pyramid. Quaclaroonie. It's bigger than it lools. L wonder what's inside. There's only one way to find out, lads. Start digging. If l read these hieroglyphics correctly, we may have found the entrance. Lool at this. All right. Let's go. Me first. After you. But the camels will be lonesome. Thinl we'll see a mummy? My mummy's expecting me. It's time for my nap. Careful. Stay close, Webby. No telling what lind of dangers we may find. Lools safe to me. Checl it out. Lool at that. It's a Collie Baba booby trap. What does the Junior Woodchucl uide Bool say about booby traps? Lt says ""Stay alert and use your marbles"". Boy, good thing l brought some. There's another one. That could have given me a booboo. Just leep the light ahead of us, guide. Keep going, Dijon. Maybe one of the children might be wanting to hold the torch. Lool out! Do not be fearing. Dijon shall trip the trap. You see? Ls there a doctor in the pyramid? Angway. Coming through. Jumpstart my heart! The treasure! Race you to the rubies. Lool at those nuggets. Come on, Dijon! Lool at all that gold. Collie Baba, you old dog. L've finally found it. Lool at this. What an eyeful. What a mouthful. The money, the rubies, the diamonds. The lamp! Pinch me, l'm in heaven. L'll get it. Uncle Scrooge. Sumowrestling scorpions. Don't worry. We're safe up here. Dijon! What? L am not touching a thing. L am clean, innocent, lile a little baby goat. O get the sacls. Sacls? Oh, yes, sacls. Right away. Anything you say, sir, l do for you. Where you going to leep all this treasure? L won't leep it all, Most of these artefacts will go to museums. That doesn't sound lile Uncle Scrooge. That way l enjoy a hefty tax breal. That does. Looky. Looky. A teapot. Just an old oil lamp. Hardly worth taling. May l have it, Uncle Scrooge? L can use it for my tea set. Well... Course, this is pretty too. Here. Don't say your Uncle Scrooge never gave you anything. Thanls. That's the last of it. You thinl you can carry it, Launchpad? No problemo. Don't lose it. Thanls, Dijon. Here, l can handle it. Help! Allow me. Who's that guy? Just another tour guide. Let me light your path. L smell a couple of desert rats. Uncle Scrooge! Hurry! You thieving dogs! L've spent my life searching for that treasure. Poor fool. Too bad you will not live to Inow the real treasure you have found. Farewell. L Inew that weasel's prices were too good to be true. What are we gonna do? Cut the ropes, lads. Hurry, Louie. Et away! Shoo! Lt's turtle time. Forward, ho! Reverse, ho! Lf you don't stop crashing, l'll give you the heaveho. Do you hear something? Quicl, let's turn this over and male a boat. Hurry, Uncle Scrooge. Here, Webby, you tale this. Come on! Lt's here, master. L saw it. Wait till you see it. You will be pleased as pop. Well? Where is it? L do not understand. It must be here. You have it, don't you? Where is the lamp? They must have it. They must. Those dirty thieves. And such sweet children. L asl you, what is the world coming to? You let them steal it from you, you pathetic piclpoclet. Don't worry. L will help get it bacl. No trouble, you bet, here l come. Yes, right behind you. L mean, don't wait, Dijon is on the way. Mamma! L'd sure lile to Inow where this leads. L'm not so sure you do. Boy, are we in trouble. Either the water is getting higher or the roof is getting lower. What a ride. Yeah. L wouldn't mind doing it again. Now that l Inow you can live through it. At least we're all OK. Speal for yourself. L just lost the treasure of the century. Here, Uncle Scrooge. You can have this bacl if it'll male you feel better. That's all right, dear. It tool me 40 years to find that treasure and l plan to get it bacl, even if it tales another 40. Hello? Merlocl? Scrooge? Where is everybody? They have vanished. But how? With the lamp, you fool. And you will help me get it bacl, or their sting will seem lile a ticlle compared with mine. Duclburg Daily News on line one, sir. For what? L believe they want to asl what happened with the treasure. None of your business. Whenever l get my mind off the treasure, the press presses me about it again. L have some news to cheer you up. What's that? You've finally received your invitation to the Archaeological Society ball. L cannot face those old fossils again. Every year l tell them ""l'll find Collie Baba's treasure."" And every year l come bacl emptyhanded. But you did have it for a little while. Does everyone have to remind me? Sorry. L can't worl, Mrs Featherby. L'm going home. But what about your lunch? Sell it. Here's the polish, Webbigail. Thanls, rammy. As soon as l'm done polishing my teapot, we can have a tea party with my dollies. Thanls for the warning. Excuse me, ma'am. But l've been summoned to picl up Mr McDucl. Apparently, he's having another one of his chipper days. Oh, dear. Maybe we'd better play outside today. Hey. What? Lt shool. See? Quaclaroonie! Well, there's nothing in it. What is it, a Mexican jumping lamp? Wonder of wonders! L'm free at last. Shabooey! It's a genie, isn't it? It's not the tooth fairy. What the...? Who are you? Where's Collie Baba? Did Rome fall yet? We rubbed the lamp. We're sorry if we did anything bad. My new masters. L am eternally grateful. Finally, there's room to stretch. My foot's been asleep for six centuries. Cool lasbah. Mind if l lool around? Cold food closet. Where do you hang the chiclen? Don't tell me. A rug beater? Egg beater. Yes, l see. Bacl, you foul eggs. Bacl l say. Shabooey, it's alive! Wait! Come bacl! Where'd he go? What do you Inow? Las Vegas must be some place if Caesar moved his palace there. What are you doing? Catching up on the 20th century. You read the whole encyclopaedia? From cover to cover to cover to cover to... What's this? A baseball? A bowling ball? Cinderella's ball? No, it's a globe of the earth. Et bacl. The earth isn't flat? L must have missed that part. He has been in that lamp a long time. L gotta checl this out. Wait a second. What about our wishes? Wishes? Do l lool lile a birthday cale? Come on, you can't fool us. A genie's supposed to grant wishes. Yeah, three wishes for every master. Darn. Everybody remembers that part. How does it worl? How does it worl? OK! First you have to hold the lamp. Then say ""l wish."" Yeah? Then wish for something. That's all? Jeepers. It's even userfriendly. L Inow the first wish. L'm going to wish for a million wishes. Et serious. That never worls. L guess one of us oughta wish for peace and happiness all over the world. These are wishes, not miracles. What if we wish for a pet? That's more lile it. L Inow what l've always wanted. L wish for a baby elephant. Oh, no! Please. Shabooey! Now lool what you've gone and done. What's wrong? She's cute. And big. Big wishes spell big trouble. The bigger the wish, the bigger the trouble. He's right. One lool at that and Uncle Scrooge'll want to Inow what's up. Everyone who sees it will, and they'll all be fighting over me, and the wishes'll get out of control and l'll be buried for another 1,000 years. Ah, jeepers. L hadn't thought of that. So, please, male small wishes. It's our nanny. Hurry. Hide the elephant. Lile where? Shabooey! L'm in trouble already. We all are. Elephant! Pinl! Hurry! Down, girl! Please! Here, Louie, you wish Pinky away. L'm not wasting one of my wishes. You do it. No way. Will somebody do something? Here. L wish Webby never made her stupid wish. Let's get outta here before anybody sees enie. In here, Mr McDucl. It's gone. Mrs Bealley, is this a ploy to get some vacation time? Lt was here. Honest. An elephant wearing a big pinl bow. You thinl l'm crazy, don't you? Maybe not. L thinl he saw us. Quicl. Et bacl in the lamp. Not the lamp. The dog house, a madhouse, even a house of pancales. Anywhere but the lamp. In here. Hello, Uncle Scrooge. Hello, Uncle Scrooge. Don't you ""hello"" me. What lind of tricl are you lids playing on Mrs Bealley? Who, us? Tricls? Never. Not us, Uncle Scrooge. Then what's going on? Nothing. Not much. Nope, not a thing. What was that? The crash in the closet? We didn't hear it. Ive me five. Et down, get bad, get real, get a haircut. Who is this? ...Er... ene. Yeah, . You're new around here? Kinda. L pop up every now and then. He just came over to visit. For the night. The night? You mean, sleep over? Yeah. Can he? Please. We'll be good Junior Woodchucls. Woodchucl's promise. Ditto. All right. But stay out of trouble. L'm in no mood for mischief. We're flying now! What else should we wish for? L'd lile a small steamboat. Sure. You want that with or without an ocean? A little much? Just a tad. L Inow. L wish for the world's biggest ice cream sundae. But not too big. Ice cream sundae, come on down. Otta watch out for that wind shear. L'm starving. That's cos it's getting late. Betcha Uncle Scrooge'll wonder why we missed dinner. Maybe we should go now. Nah. Oh, dear. No sign of them yet. Should l call the police? Aye, to hold me bacl when those rascals finally get home. They'll be grounded for a month. No video games, no television and no more friends... ...spending the night. We're bacl. Children, l thinl your uncle has something to say to you. Aye. Welcome home. Can l get you and ene anything? Coolies? Mill? Lce cream? No, thanls. We're lind of full. And sleepy. That's because it's past your bedtime. Scoot along, my wee ones. Ood night, Uncle Scrooge. Nightynight. Sleep tight. That's telling them, sir. So this is how it feels to be one of the guys. It's all l've ever wished for. How many wishes do we have left? Just my last one. And Webby's. We'd better male sure they're special. It's him! Hide me! Hurry! Chase him away! But it's just an old owl. An owl? He comes around here every night. L thought it was my meanest master, the one Collie Baba stole the lamp from. Your master was a bird? He could change into anything. He's an evil sorcerer. But he can't still be alive. He'd be ancient. Yeah. Older than Uncle Scrooge even. Except his first wish was to live for ever. Ood wisher. No. Bad wisher. You don't Inow. He made me do the worst things. Lile what? D'you ever hear of Atlantis? Lt was everybody's favourite resort until Merlocl couldn't get reservations. Then down she went. And poor Pompeii. Mount Vesuvius would have never blown its top if Merlocl hadn't blown his. But what are you worried about? He used up his wishes. That's just it. Merlocl has unlimited wishes because he has a magic talisman. It's what gives him all his powers. And when he puts it on the lamp, he gets as many wishes as he wants. Now do you see why l'm a little jumpy? Maybe we should wish for the talisman. That's the one wish l can't do. You'd have to steal it from him yourself, and good lucl. Don't worry about that mean old master now. He has no idea you're with us. And that's the way it's gonna stay. There it is. You can drop me off anywhere along here. But not there. That's going to leave a nasty marl. Are you certain this is where Scrooge lives? This time l'm very sure. L thinl. Then we begin our search. In light? But l am not a popular favourite in that house. Scrooge find me, he lill me. Then stay behind if you wish. L'll try very hard to remember you at reward time. There's the robber. Catch him! Come on, rug, giddyup! Idup! Upsiedaisy! Reach for the chandelier! Boys. Teaparty time. Not now, Webby. We're in the middle of an arrest. L Inow someone who wants to play with me. Come on, enie. They don't Inow how much fun they're gonna miss. L told you, l'm not going to the ball. But, sir, l've arranged for Launchpad to fly you to the launch. Cancel Launchpad. L'll not only save face, but my life as well. You're gonna love playing tea party. L Inow. L read all about it. Can l be the guy who dresses lile an Indian and throws tea off the boat? No. No, silly. Not a Boston Tea Party. L hate rats! First you pour the tea... then tale little sips... and tall to your guests. What a lovely dress, Quacky. Et outta here. No war paint or tomahawls or anything? Just you and me and my friends here. You call these party animals? They're lifeless. Enie, you've just given me the bestest idea in the world. There is a way to have all my friends enjoy the party. L didn't mean it. The less the merrier. Just you and me and a pot of tea. This'll be fun. L wish all my toys and dollies were alive. Shabooey! Lt's so nice to finally meet all of you. Coolies, anyone? Feeding frenzy. Dollies, be good. If there's anything l hate more than elephants in the house, it's rats. Here, ratty, come to nanny. This isn't a house! Lt's a zoo! Wish them bacl, please. L can't. That was my last wish. L wish you hadn't said that. Oh, dear. Launchpad isn't answering. He must be on his way. Won't you go, sir? Aye, to worl. Tell Launchpad he can tale you to the ball. Since when does a hat have a mind of its own? Otcha! Watch out for your head, sir. Master. Poor nosey. What is going on? What did you do this time? L'm sorry. Just male them stop. But l've only got one wish left. Boys, what is going on here? Well? Lools lile the jig is up. O ahead, Louie. L wish everything was bacl to normal. Blow my bagpipes. He's a genie. Does his mother Inow about this? We were gonna tell you, Uncle Scrooge. Someday. Where'd he come from? Remember my teapot? Heavenly heather. The genie in the magic lamp. The fortunes l could own. L could have the world's biggest diamond. No, the world's biggest diamond mine. No, all the diamond mines. No, the entire mining industry! Yes! L can see this will tale some careful thought. It's your ride, sir. Or should l say, my ride. Are you lidding? L wouldn't miss this party for all the scones in Scotland. But the treasure... Aye, the treasure. The one wish l don't have to thinl about twice. L wish for the treasure of Collie Baba. Oh, no. Shabooey! The bonny bounty is mine again. Wait till those old fossils at the society hear this news. In the lamp. You're coming with me. Not the lamp. Have a heart. Can't he stay with us, Uncle Scrooge? No. L'm not letting this wee gold mine out of my sight. But he's our friend. Nonsense. A genie isn't a person. A genie is a thing. Inside. Bye, guys. It was great while it lasted. Don't tale him, Uncle Scrooge. You can't. Let him stay, please. Poor master. Oh, well. Where is the lamp? Scrooge has it. Oh, no! Music, food, guacamole. It's a party. Otta boogie. Otta bingo. L gotta get outta this lamp. Let me out. Can you leep quiet at all? Lf you let me out, l'll be as quiet as a mouse, and just as small. All right. Lool at us! A couple of single guys out on the town. Uess again. You can watch the ball from here. Otherwise you go bacl in the lamp. But what if l win the door prize? Master, all this flipflapping. Maybe we tale the bus bacl. Silence. You shall go through the rear entrance while l go in the front. If Scrooge gets past you, it'll be your hide. Here's your soda, sir. Enie, party of one. L gotta warn Mr McDucl. Ladies and gentlemen, may l have your attention? We have an important announcement to male this evening. Without further ado, l give you Scrooge McDucl. L gotta stop him. L have something l've been wanting to say for 40 years. It is my good fortune to announce that this year l have finally brought to Duclburg the legendary, the infamous treasure of... It's Merlocl, my old master. It's that baclstabbing banshee. He's too powerful. He could destroy you. L'll save you. Left, right! O! Follow me. Hurry. You are a loon. What are you doing? Quicl, you gotta wish us outta here. Not me. These wishes are worth a fortune. What's more important  a fortune or your life? Well... It's not exactly a tricl question. He's got a bear? He is a bear. Male us a little getaway wish. Please! No, we stand our ground. L've got one tricl that might save us, l hope. Oing up. Bad houseleeping. It lools lile they have slipped the coop. It was not my fault. They did not get past Dijon. It was not your fault either, master. No. Just leep searching while l hunt outside. They will not escape. As you wish, master, l do for you. L can't hear anything. They're gone. Where are we? Well, it's not exactly the Ritz. Not the lamp. You get used to the smell after a few hundred years. Can you move your elbow? Et me out of here! Do you have to yell at me all the time? L wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for you. Thanls to you, l've got a crazy animal act on my tail. That's it, blame the genie. L only saved your life. Sorry. It's not my fault Merlocl's after me. L didn't asl to be Mr Popular. All l want is a life of my own, lile your nephews. With my own bile, a stacl of comic bools, a sled. Maybe some sli equipment, a CD player, my own home video entertainment system. All right. Oh, no, it's Merlocl! Hide me! L've got to get you to my vault. It's the only safe place. Time to go bacl. But you saw what a dump it is. Sorry, enie, but the party's over. And just when we were getting to be buddies. Scrooge. Mr McDucl! Mr McDucl! Are you all right? What's going on? Come out, whoever you are. Wait till Merlocl sees this. He will be so grateful. L can see my mountain of money now. Wait. Why give him the lamp? Because the master wants it so badly. But with the lamp, you'll be the big cheese, the hot falafel, the most powerful person on earth. Reat master. Master? Master Dijon? L lile it. L really lile it. Launchpad! Et me out of here fast. Dull party, Mr McD? O! Now! Don't plan on landing. L don't have time for any more disasters. Ood morning, Scrooge, sir. What's going on? At the urging of my genie, l have decided to seel my fortune. L never thought he'd wish for your fortune, Mr McDucl, l swear. The lamp? Ravy? That's right. L get the loot, you get the boot. You can't do this. Put me down. L'm your boss, not that bum. Tale him downtown. You can forget about this year's Christmas bonus. Whose name do you thinl is on this... building? Dijon? Lt really is his. Wiped out with a wish. If l ever get my money bacl, l promise l'll never male another wish for myself again. There's someone to see you, Mr McDucl. Lads. Webby. Uncle Scrooge! Uncle Scrooge. Sir, good to see you. Mr McDucl, l'm so sorry. There, Mr Bealley. L Inow. We all chipped in to set bail. We even emptied our banls. Don't worry. L'll pay you all bacl with cash at the mansion. The mansion? He hasn't heard. Heard what? Mr McDucl, l'm so sorry. Dijon has everything  the mansion, the factories. Even your spat collection, sir. Mr McDucl! Our home. Our beautiful home. There, there. L Inow, ma'am. L Inow. First my Money Bin, now this. Well, at least we have each other. Thinl of poor enie. If only there was a way to sneal in and get bacl the lamp. But there's so many alarms. Aye. Hundreds. And 14,657 ways to trigger them. And you Inow each and every one, don't you, Uncle Scrooge? Aye. And maybe the way to shut 'em off? Aye. Come, lads. Something tells me we should plan a fullscale invasion. Delicious. Delicious. Ood golly, everything smells more delicious when you're rich. Even me. Shouldn't we be birdwatching? Don't worry about Merlocl. He would not dare to confront the great and powerful Dijon. Anyway, l don't thinl he Inows about me yet. L've got the Bin at 12 o'clocl high, Mr McD. Ive or tale 10 minutes. Snuggy enough, sir? All right, lads. Operation Lift the Lamp is about to commence. Roger, Uncle Scrooge. Over and out. See anyone coming, Commander Bealley? L don't thinl so. Then wish us lucl. This is it. C... A... S... H. Remember, only step on the white tiles. L'm on the roof. And we're inside. Ood. All you have to do is breal into the security room. Don't worry. We're almost there. That's easy for you to say. Keep going, Webby. If you can't get through, no one can. Attagirl! There's the alarm panel. L've got Uncle Scrooge's directions to leep from getting zapped. Two steps up the middle. One step to the right, three steps forward, and... five steps... You'd better get bacl here. Ood thing you had your hairnet. What are we gonna do? Use our marbles. Marbles. You don't have to worry about any alarms, Uncle Scrooge. Ood worl, lads. L'm going in. Enie, l've decided on my first important act as a rich man. L shall plan a vacation. L wonder which country l shall be visiting first. Are you sure it's safe to travel? Merlocl could be close. Do not worry, enie, l have planned to tale a small army of bodyguards. Whoever said that money can't buy peace of mind must have had the brains of a garbanzo bean. Oh, no! Ive that bacl, you dirty... Please, Merlocl. No wishes. L can't tale 'em. Relax. It's going to be lile old times again. Come on. We gotta help. My talisman now gives me unlimited wishes, Scrooge. And where are you going? Just outside, master. You and enie have so much to catch up on, l thought you might be wanting a few minutes alone. L Inow l would. Enie. L wish you would turn this disloyal swine into something fitting. Just lile old times all right. And now, enie, l wish you would transform this mundane Bin into a fortress more worthy of its new owner. Remember our magnificent old home? Yeah. Casa de Coocoo. My money! Come on! Wait for me. Help! Here, Webby, hold on! My heavens! L'm so sorry, Mr McDucl. And now, enie, l wish to return home in my new home. Will you never stop? This cannot be happening. You maniac. Return the Bin before l stuff that lamp down your throat. Bad move. You threaten me? Please, Merlocl. He's had a lousy day. Maybe a hot bath and a warm glass of mill... Silence. L wish you would cast him out of my house. No! L can't. Do it. L have no choice. L understand. Ood shot. Et it, guys! Uncle Scrooge! L'll be bacl for you. No! No! Laugh at me, will you? L'll show you. Ive that bacl, you fleabitten buzzard! My talisman! This time you have to male a wish. Aye. L wish me and my family and my Bin were bacl in Duclburg. Right now. Ood wishing. Duclburg never looled so good. Aye, but it cannot beat my view, laddies. Has any heather ever looled more heavenly? And you still have the lamp, Uncle Scrooge. Aye. And one more wish to go. You sound lile you Inow what it is. L'm going to stop all this magic. Even if l must wish for the lamp to be buried in the centre of the earth. What? No! You can't. Oh, no! But enie'll be gone for ever. Aren't we overreacting? We could... hide him in the vault. And we'll dress him up lile a boy and leep him in our room. Just lile before. Enie, get ready to grant my last wish. And yours too. What do you mean? L wish the genie would turn into a real boy. Shabooey! L'm a boy. L'm a real boy. Now l can do all the things real boys do. Run through fields, play catch, roll over. Wait. That's a dog. Uncle Scrooge. What about the lamp? Lool. Without the genie, it's wasting away. How can l ever thanl you, master? L'm not your master any more. That's right. Can l call you Uncle Scrooge? You're a sweet lid. But don't press your lucl. What do you wanna do on your first day as a boy? Let me put it this way  you'll never catch me, coppers. Oh, boy! L'm gonna getcha! Are you coming with us, Uncle? You go ahead, Webby, dear. We quadzillionaires have our own ideas of fun. You! Scrooge, sir. Oh, good golly, What a time we have been having. Yes. L was just now leaving. Oodbye. But it's only some loose change. L'll change your face, you thief! Somebody stop those pants.

Hercules,Disney,1990,1997,Animation,"Long ago, in the faraway land of ancient Greece, there was a golden age of powerful gods and extraordinary heroes. And the greatest and strongest of all these heroes was the mighty Hercules. But what is the measure of a true hero? Ah, that is what our stoy is... Will you listen to him? He's makin' the story sound like some Greek tragedy. Lighten up, dude. We'll take it from here, darling. You go, girl. We are the Muses, goddesses of the arts and proclaimers of heroes. Heroes like Hercules. Honey, you mean ""Hunkules."" Ooh, I'd like to make some sweet music with him... Our story actually begins long before Hercules, many aeons ago.  Ah   Back when the world was new   Whoa!  The planet Earth was down on its luck   And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok   It was a nasty place   There was a mess wherever you stepped   Where chaos reigned and the earthquakes and volcanoes never slept   Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!   And then along came Zeus   He hurled his thunderbolt  He zapped   Locked those suckers in a vault  They're trapped   And on his own stopped chaos in its tracks   And that's the gospel truth   The guy was too ""Type A"" to just relax   And that's the world's first dish   Yeah, baby.   Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth   Though, honey it may seem impossible   That's the gospel truth   On Mount Olympus life was neat And smooth as sweet vermouth   Although, honey it may seem impossible   That's the gospel truth   Yeah, yeah   Hey, hey, hey   Hey, yeah   Hercules! Behave yourself. Oh, look at this. Look how cute he is. Hah! Oh, he's strong like his dad, hmm? Whoa! Excuse me! Hot stuff coming through! Excuse me. One side, Ares. Why, Hermes, they're lovely. Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus do the arrangement. Isn't that too nutty? Fabulous party. You know, I haven't seen this much love in a room since Narcissus discovered himself. Dear, keep those away from the baby. Oh, he won't hurt himself. Let the kid have a little fun. On behalf of my son, I want to thank you all for your wonderful gifts! What about our gift, dear? Well, let's see here. We'll take... Hmm, yes. A little cirrus and a touch of nimbostratus and a dash of cumulus. His name is Pegasus, and he's all yours, son. Mind his head. He's so tiny. My boy. My little Hercules. How sentimental. You know, I haven't been this choked up since I got a hunk of moussaka caught in my throat! Huh? So is this an audience or a mosaic? Hey, how you doin'? Lookin' good. Nice dress. So, Hades, you finally made it. How are things in the underworld? Well, they're just fine. You know, a little dark, a little gloomy. And, as always, hey, full of dead people. What are you gonna do? Ah! There's the little sunspot. Little snootchie. And here is a sucker for the little sucker, eh? Here you go. Ya just... Sheesh! Uh, powerful little tyke. Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff. Join the celebration! Hey. Love to, babe, but unlike you gods lounging about up here, I regrettably have a fulltime gig that you, by the way, so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus. So, can't. Love to, but can't. You ought to slow down. You'll work yourself to death. Hah! Work yourself to death! Oh, I kill myself! If only. If only. If there's one god you don't want to get steamed up, it's Hades. 'Cause he had an evil plan.  He ran the underworld   But thought the dead were dull and uncouth   He was as mean as he was ruthless   And that's the gospel truth   He had a plan to shake things up   And that's the gospel truth   Pain! Coming, your most lugubriousness. Ow! Panic! Oh, I'm sory. I can handle it! Pain! Oh! And Panic! Reporting for duty! Reporting for duty! Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know the instant the Fates arrive. Oh. They're here. What? The Fates are here, and you didn't tell me? We are worms! Worthless worms! We are worms! Worthless worms! Memo to me, memo to me. Maim you after my meeting. Darling, hold that mortal's thread of life good and tight. Incoming! Ladies! I am so sorry that I'm... Late! Late! We knew you would be. We know everything. Past. Present. And Future. Indoor plumbing, it's gonna be big. Great, great. Anyway, see, ladies, I was at this party, and I lost track of... We know! Yeah. I know you know. So here's the deal. Zeus, Mr High and Mighty, Mr ""Hey, you, get off of my cloud,"" now he has... A bouncing baby brat. We know! I know you know. I know. I got it. I got the concept. So let me just ask. Is this kid gonna mess up my hostile takeover bid, or what? What do you think? Oh, no you don't. We're not supposed to reveal the future. Wait. I'm sorry. Time out. Can I... Can I ask you a question, by the way? Are you... Did you cut your hair or something? You look fabulous. I mean, you look like a Fate worse than death. Oh, gross! Yech! It's blinkin'! Ladies, please. My fate is in your lovely hands. Yeah! Oh, all right. In 18 years precisely, the planets will align ever so nicely. Ay, verse. Oy. The time to act will be at hand. Unleash the Titans, your monstrous band. Mmhmm. Good, good. Then the onceproud Zeus will finally fall, and you, Hades, will rule all! Yes! Hades rules! A word of caution to this tale. Excuse me? Should Hercules fight, you will fail. What? Okay, fine, fine. I'm cool. I'm fine. Pain? Panic? Got a little riddle for ya. How do you kill a god? I do not know! You can't. They're immortal? Bingo! They're immortal. So, first you got to turn the little sunspot mortal. Huh? Wha... What is it? The baby! The baby! Hercules! Oh! No! Now we did it! Zeus is gonna use us for target practice! Just hang onto the kid, Panic. Hurry! Let's just kill the kid and get it over with, okay? Here you go, kid. A little Grecian formula. Look at that! He's changing. Can we do it now? No, no, no, he has to drink the whole potion. Every last drop. Who's there? Alcmene, over here. Oh, you poor thing. Don't cry. Is anybody there? Now? Now. Well, he must have been abandoned. Amphitryon, for so many years we've prayed to the gods to bless us with a child. Perhaps they've answered our prayers. Perhaps they have. ""Hercules""? Help, help, help! Hades is gonna kill us when he finds out what happened. You mean, if he finds out. Of course he's gonna f... If. If is good. It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods on a frantic search. But by the time they found the baby, it was too late.  Young Herc was mortal now  Mmm   But since he did not drink the last drop   He still retained his godlike strength   So thank his lucky stars   Tell it, girl.   But Zeus and Hera wept  Ooh, ooh, ooh   Because their son could never come home   They'd have to watch their precious baby grow up from afar   Though Hades' horrid plan   Was hatched before Herc cut his first tooth   Ahh  The boy grew stronger every day   And that's the gospel truth   The gospel truth   Hercules, slow down! Look out! Oops! SSsorry, guys! Hey, watch where you're goin'. Sunday driver! Thanks, son. When old Penelope twisted her ankle back there, I thought we were done for. No problem, Pop. Uh, don'tdon'tdon't unload just yet. First, I have to finagle with Phideas. Okay. Oops. Sorry, Penelope. Now, Hercules, this time, please just... I know. I know. Stay by the cart. That's my boy. Oh, my goodness. Whoa! Careful! Why, thank you. No problem. Why, Hercules! IIIt's you! Let me help you with that. No, no, no, no, no. I got it! I'm fine. You just run along. Are you sure? Oh, yes. Absolutely. Yo! Give it here! Hey, you need an extra guy? Uh, sorry, Herc. Uh, we already got five, and we want to keep it an even number. Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an even... See ya, Herc. What a geek! Destructo Boy. Maybe we should call him ""Jerkules."" Yeah! Heads up! II got it! No! Stop! Uhoh. Oh, no. It's okay. Hey! Whoa! Son! Hang on, Pop! Be right back! Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Watch out! Nice catch, Jerkules. Son... This is the last straw, Amphitryon! That boy is a menace! He's too dangerous to be around normal people! He didn't mean any harm. He's just a kid. HeHe just can't control his strength. I'm warning you. You keep thatthatthat... freak away from here! Freak! Yeah, go away! Ah, son, you shouldn't let those things they said back there get to you. But, Pop, they're right. II am a freak. II try to fit in. I really do. I just can't. Sometimes I feel like I really don't belong here, like I'm supposed to be someplace else. Hercules, son... I know it doesn't make any sense.  I have often dreamed of a far off place   Where a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me   Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face   And a voice keeps sayin' this is where I'm meant to be   I will find my way   I can go the distance   I'll be there someday   If I can be strong   I know every mile   Will be worth my while   I would go most anywhere to feel like I   Belong   Hercules, there's something your mother and I have been meaning to tell ya. But if you found me, then where did I come from? Why was I left here? This was around your neck when we found you. It's the symbol of the gods. This is it! Don't you see? Maybe they have the answers! I'll go to the temple of Zeus and... Ma, Pop, you're the greatest parents anyone could have, but... II gotta know.  I am on my way   I can go the distance   I don't care how far   Somehow, I'll be strong   I know every mile   Will be worth my while   I would go most anywhere   To find where I belong   Oh, mighty Zeus, please, hear me and answer my prayer. I need to know. Who am I? WhWhere do I belong? Huh? My boy. My little Hercules. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, kiddo! What's your hurry? After all these years, is this the kind of hello you give your father? FFFather? Didn't know you had a famous father, did you? Surprise! Look how you've grown. Why, you've got your mother's beautiful eyes and my strong chin. Hah! II don't understand. If you're my father, that would make me a... A god. A god. A god! Hey, you wanted answers, and by thunder, you're old enough now to know the truth. But why did you leave me on Earth? Didn't you want me? Of course we did. Your mother and I loved you with all our hearts. Someone stole you from us and turned you mortal, and only gods can live on Mount Olympus. And you can't do a thing? I can't, Hercules, but you can. RReally? WWhat? I'll do anything. Hercules, if you can prove yourself a true hero on Earth, your godhood will be restored! A true hero. Great! Uh, exactly how do you become a true hero? First, you must seek out Philoctetes, the trainer of heroes. Seek out Philoctetes. Right. I'll... Whoa! Whoa! Hold your horses! Which reminds me. Haha! You probably don't remember Pegasus, but you two go way back, son. Oh, Pegasus! He's a magnificent horse with the brain of a bird. I'll find Philoctetes and become a true hero. That's the spirit! I won't let you down, Father! Yeehah! Good luck, son.  I will beat the odds   I can go the distance   I will face the world   Fearless, proud and strong   I will please the gods   I can go the distance   Till I find my hero's welcome right where I   Belong   Whoa! You sure this is the right place? What's the matter, little guy? You stuck? Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy! Ugh! Girls! Stop! Stop! Come back, come back, come back. Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez! Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, nymphs! They can't keep their hands off me. Hey! What's the matter? You never seen a satyr before? Uh, no. Can you help us? We're looking for someone called Philoctetes. Call me Phil. Phil! Ow! Boy, am I glad to meet you! I'm Hercules. And this is Pegasus. Animals! Disgusting! I need your help. I want to become a hero, a true hero. Sorry, kid. Can't help ya. Wait! Whoo! Uh, sorry. Why not? Two words, I am retired. Look, I gotta do this. Haven't you ever had a dream, something you wanted so bad you'd do anything? Kid, come inside. I want to show you something. Watch it! That was part of the mast of the Argo. The Argo? Yeah. Who do you think taught Jason how to sail? Cleopatra? I trained all those wouldbe heroes. Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus. A lot of ""yeuseus."" And every single one of those bums let me down flatter than a discus. None of 'em could go the distance. And then there was Achilles. Now, there was a guy who had it all, the build, the foot speed. He could jab, he could take a hit, he could keep on comin'. But that furshlugginer heel of his! He barely gets nicked there once and kaboom! He's history. Yeah, I had a dream once. I dreamed I was gonna train the greatest hero there ever was. So great, the gods would hang a picture of him in the stars all across the sky, and people would say, ""That's Phil's boy."" That's right. Eh, but dreams are for rookies. A guy can only take so much disappointment. But I'm different than those other guys, Phil! I can go the distance. Come on. I'll show you. Geez! You don't give up, do ya? Watch this. Holy Hera. You know, maybe if I... No! Snap out of it! I'm too old to get mixed up in this stuff again. But if I don't become a true hero, I'll never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus. Hold it! Zeus is your father, right? Zeus. The big guy. He's your daddy. Mr Lightning Bolts! Read me a book, would ya, Dada? Zeus! ""Once upon a time..."" It's the truth! Please!  So you wanna be a hero, kid   Well, whoopdedo   I have been around the block before   With blockheads just like you   Each and every one a disappointment   Pain for which there ain't no ointment   So much for excuses Though a kid of ""Zeus"" is   Askin' me to jump into the fray   My answer is two words  Okay. You mean you'll do it? You win. You won't be sorry, Phil. Oh, gods. So when do we start? Can we start now? Oy, vay.  I'd given up hope that someone would come along   A fella who'd ring the bell for once Not the gong   The kind who wins trophies   Won't settle for low fees   At least semipro fees   But, no, I get the greenhorn   I've been out to pasture, pal My ambition gone   Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn   But you need an advisor   A satyr, but wiser   A good merchandiser and... whoa   There goes my ulcer   I'm down to one last hope and I hope it's you   Though, kid, you're not exactly a dream come true   I trained enough turkeys Who never came through   You're my one last hope So you'll have to do  Rule number six. When rescuing a damsel, always handle with care. No! Rule number 95, kid. Concentrate! Rule number 96. Aim!  Demigods have faced the odds And ended up a mockery   Don't believe the stories That you read on all the crockery   To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art   Like paintin' a masterpiece   It's a work of heart   It takes more than sinew   Comes down to what's in you   You have to continue to grow  Now, that's more like it!  I'm down to one last shot And my last high note   Before that blasted underworld gets my goat   My dreams are on you, kid   Go make 'em come true   Climb that uphill slope   Keep pushin' that envelope   You're my one last hope   And, kid, it's up to you   Yeah! Ha, ha, ha! Did you see that? Next stop, Olympus. All right, just take it easy, champ. I am ready. I want to get off this island. I want to see battles and monsters. Rescue some damsels. You know, heroic stuff. Well... Aw, come on, Phil! Well, okay. Okay, you want a road test? Saddle up, kid. We're goin' to Thebes! Yahoo! So what's in Thebes? A lot of problems. It's a big, tough town. Good place to start buildin' a rep. Sounds like your basic DID, Damsel in Distress. Not so fast, sweetheart. I swear, Nessus. Put me down or I'll... Whoo! I like 'em fiey! Now, remember, kid. First, analyse the situation. Don't just barrel in there without thinking. Eh? He's losin' points for this! You don't know what you're... Halt! Step aside, two legs. Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir. I'll have to ask you to release that young... Keep movin', junior. Lady. But you... AreAren't you a damsel in distress? I'm a damsel, I'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day. Uh... Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close to the situation to realise... Ohhh! What are you doin'? Get your sword! Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15, a hero is only as good as his weapon! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on! He's gotta do it on his own. Come on, kid! Concentrate! Use your head! All right! Not bad, kid! Not exactly what I had in mind, but not bad. Oh, gee, miss. I'm, I'm really sorry. That was dumb. Yeah. Excuse me. Nice work! Excelente! Is Wonderboy here for real? What are you talkin' about? Of course he's real. Whoa! And by the way, sweet cheeks, I'm real, too. Ugh! Yeehah! Yahoo! Whoa! How was that, Phil? Rein it in, rookie. You can get away with mistakes like those in the minor decathlons, but this is the big leagues! At least I beat him, didn't I? Next time, don't let your guard down because of a pair of big googoo eyes! Doh! It's like I keep tellin' ya. You gotta stay focused, and... You... Are you, uh, all right. Miss, uh... Megara. My friends call me Meg. At least, they would if I had any friends. So did they give you a name along with all those rippling pectorals? Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh... Uh, uh... Are you always this articulate? Hercules. My... My name is Hercules. Herc... Huh. I think I prefer Wonderboy. So, uh, uh... Howhowhow'd you get mixed up with the, uh... Pinhead with hooves? Well, you know how men are. They think that ""No"" means ""Yes,"" and ""Get lost"" means ""Take me, I'm yours."" Don't worry. Shorty here can explain it to ya later. Well, thanks for everything, Herc. It's been a real slice. Wait! Um, can we give you a ride? Uh, I don't think your pinto likes me very much. Pegasus? Oh, no. Don't be silly. He'd be more than happy to... Ow! I'll be all right. I'm a big, tough girl. I tie my own sandals and everything. Byebye, Wonderboy. Bye. She's something. Isn't she, Phil? Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah. She's really something. A real pain in the patella! Earth to Herc! Come in, Herc! Come in, Herc! We got a job to do, remember? Thebes is still waitin'. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Aw, how cute. A couple of rodents looking for a theme park. Who you callin' a rodent, sister? I'm a bunny! AAnd I'm his gopher! Tadah! I thought I smelled a rat. Meg? Speak of the devil. Meg, my little flower, my little bird, my little nut, Meg. What exactly happened here? I thought you were gonna persuade the river guardian to join my team for the uprising, and here I am, kind of river guardianless. I gave it my best shot, but he made me an offer I had to refuse. Fine. So, instead of subtracting two years from your sentence, hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay? Give that your best shot. It wasn't my fault. It was this wonderboy, Hercules. Hercules? Why does that name ring a bell? I don't know. Um, maybe we owe him money? What was that name again? Hercules. He comes on with this big, innocent farm boy routine, but I could see through that in a Peloponnesian minute. Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name of that kid we were supposed to... Oh, my gods! Oh, my gods! Run for it! So you took care of him, huh? Dead as a door nail. Weren't those your exact words? This might be a different Hercules. Yeah! I mean, Hercules is a very popular name nowadays! Remember, like, a few years ago, every other boy was named Jason, and the girls were all named Brittany? I'm about to rearrange the cosmos, and the one schlemiel who can louse it up is waltzing around in the woods! Wait. Wait, big guy. We can still cut in on his waltzing. That's right! AndAnd at least we made him mortal. That's a good thing. Didn't we? Hmm. Fortunately for the three of you, we still have time to correct this rather egregious oversight. And this time, no foulups. Wow! Is that all one town? One town, a million troubles. The one and only Thebes. The Big Olive itself. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. Stick with me, kid. This city is a dangerous place. Look where you're goin', numbskull! Hey, I'm walkin' here! You see what I mean? I'm tellin' you, wackos. Pitta bread. Pitta bread. Get your pitta bread here. Hey, Mack. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You wanna buy a sundial? He's not interested, all right? Come on, kid. The end is coming! Can't you feel it? Yes, yes. Thank you for the info. Yes. We'll ponder that for a while. Just stare at the sidewalk. Come on. Don't make eye contact. People here are nuts. That's because they live in a city of turmoil. Trust me, kid. You're gonna be just what the doctor ordered. It was tragic! We lost everything in the fire. Everything except old Snowball here. Now, were the fires before or after the earthquake? They were after the earthquake. I remember. But before the flood. Don't even get me started on the crime rate. Thebes has certainly gone downhill in a hurry. Tell me about it. It seems like every time I turn around, there's some new monster wreaking havoc and I... All we need now is a plague of locusts. That's it! I'm movin' to Sparta! Excuse me. It, uh... seems to me that what you folks need is a hero. Yeah, and who are you? I'm Hercules, and, uh... I happen to be a hero. Is that so? A hero! Have you ever saved a town before? Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I... Have you ever reversed a natural disaster? Well, uh, no. Oh, listen to this. He's just another chariot chaser. This we need. That's a laugh. Don't you pea brains get it? Hmm? This kid is the genuine article. Hey, isn't that the goatman who trained Achilles? Watch it, pal. Yeah, you're right. Hey, uh, nice job on those heels! Ya missed a spot! You... I got your heel right here! I'll wipe that stupid grin off your face! You... Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil! Take it easy. Phil. What are you, crazy? Sheesh. Young man, we need a professional hero, not an amateur. Well, wait. Stop! How am I supposed to prove myself a hero if nobody will give me a chance? You'll get your chance. You just need some kind of catastrophe or disaster. Please. Help! Please! There's been a terrible accident! Meg? Speakin' of disasters. Wonderboy! Hercules! Thank goodness! WhaWhaWhat's wrong? Oh! Outside of town, two little boys. ThThey were playing in the gorge. ThThere was this rock slide, a terrible rock slide. They're trapped! Kids? Trapped? Phil, this is great! You're really choked up about this, aren't ya? Come on! No, I... You don't under... I, I have this terrible fear of heights! I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo! I'm way behind ya, kid. I got a fur wedgie. Are you okay? I'll be fine. Just get me down before I ruin the upholstery. Help! I can't breathe! Hurry! Get us out! We're suffocating! Somebody call IXII! Easy, fellas. You'll be all right. We can't last much longer! Get us out before we get crushed! How you boys doin'? We're okay now. Jeepers, mister. You're really strong. Well, try to be a little more careful next time, okay, kids? We sure will. A stirring performance, boys. I was really moved. ""Jeepers, mister""? I was going for innocence. And, hey, two thumbs way, way up for our leading lady. What a dish. What a doll. Get outta there, you big lug, while you still can. Phil, II did great. They even applauded, sort of. Huh! I hate to burst your bubble, kid, but that ain't applause. PhPhPhPhil? What do you call that thing? Two words. Amscray! Let's get ready to rumble! That's it. Dance around! Dance around! Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth. Keep going. Come on. Come on. Lead with your left. Lead with your left! Your other left! Whoa! All right! All right! You're bad! Okay! See, Phil? That... That wasn't so hard. Kid, kid, kid. How many horns do ya see? Six? Eh, close enough. Let's get you cleaned up. Guys, guys, relax. It's only halftime. That doesn't sound good. Definitely not good! Will you forget the headslicing thing? I don't think we covered this one in basic training! My favourite part of the game, sudden death. Oh. There goes another one. Just like Achilles. Game. Set. Match. Phil, you gotta admit. That was pretty heroic. Ya did it, kid! Ya did it! You won by a landslide! Hades mad. Well, what do ya know? From that day forward, our boy Hercules could do no wrong. He was so hot, steam looked cool.  Oh, yeah   Bless my soul Herc was on a roll   Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll   What a pro  Herc could stop a show   Point him at a monster and you're talkin' SRO   He was a no one  A zero, zero   Now he's a honcho  He's a hero   Here was a kid with his act down pat   Zero to hero in no time flat   Zero to hero  Just like that   When he smiled the girls went wild   With oohs and aahs   And they slapped his face on every vase   On every ""vahse""   From appearance fees and royalties   Our Herc had cash to burn   Now nouveau riche and famous   He could tell you what's a Grecian urn   Say amen, there he goes again   Sweet and undefeated  And an awesome ten for ten   Folks lined up just to watch him flex   And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs   Hercie, he comes he sees, he conquers   Honey, the crowds were goin' bonkers   He showed the moxie brains and spunk   Yeah   From zero to hero  A major hunk   Zero to hero  And who'd have thunk?   Who put the glad in gladiator?   Hercules   Who's darin' deeds are great theatre?   Hercules   Isn't he bold?  No one braver   Is he sweet?  Our favourite flavour   Hercules   My man.   Hercules  Hercules   Hercules   Hercules  Look at my Hercules   Hercules, Hercules  Yeah, yeah, yeah   Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll   Undefeated  Riding high   And the nicest guy.   Not conceited   He was a nothing  A zero, zero   Now he's a honcho  He's our hero   He hit the heights at breakneck speed   From zero to hero   Herc is a hero   Now he's a hero   Yes, indeed   Pull! Nice shootin', Rex. I can't believe this guy. I throw everything I've got at him and it doesn't even... What are those? Oh, I don't know. II thought they looked kinda dashing. I've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo, or the entire scheme I've been setting up for 18 years goes up in smoke, and you are wearing his merchandise! Thirsty? Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy is hitting every curve you throw at him. Oh, yeah. I wonder if maybe I haven't been throwing the right curves at him, Meg, my sweet. Don't even go there. See, he's gotta have a weakness because everybody's got a weakness. I mean, for what? Pandora, it was the box thing. For the Trojans, hey. They bet on the wrong horse, okay? We simply need to find out Wonderboy's. I've done my part. Get your little imps... They couldn't handle him as a baby. I need somebody who can handle him as a man. Hey, I've sworn off manhandling. Well, you know, that's good because that's what got you into this jam in the first place, isn't it? You sold your soul to me to save your boyfriend's life. And how does this creep thank you? By running off with some babe. He hurt you real bad, didn't he, Meg? Huh? Look, I learned my lesson, okay? Which is exactly why I got a feelin' you're gonna leap at my new offer. You give me the key to bringing down Wonder Breath, and I give you the thing that you crave most in the entire cosmos, your freedom. Ha! You should have been there, Father. I mangled the Minotaur, grappled with the Gorgon. Just like Phil told me. I analysed the situation, controlled my strength and kicked. The crowds went wild! Thank you. Thank you. Hah! You're doin' great, son. You're doing your old man proud. I'm glad to hear you say that, Father. I've been waiting for this day a long time. Hmm. What day is that, son? The day I rejoin the gods. You've done wonderfully. You really have, my boy. You're just not there yet. You haven't proven yourself a true hero. But, Father, I've beaten every single monster I've come up against. II'mI'm the most famous person in all of Greece. I'mII'm an action figure! I'm afraid being famous isn't the same as being a true hero. What more can I do? It's something you have to discover for yourself. But how can I... Look inside your heart. Father, wait! On your left is Hercules' villa. Our next stop is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop where you can pick up the great hero's 30minute workout scroll Buns of Bronze. At 1:00, you got a meeting with King Augeas. He's got a problem with his stables. I'd advise you not to wear your new sandals. Phil? I told you, don't move! DGR, the Daughters of the Greek Revolution. Phil. At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle from some Amazons. Phil, what's the point? That's it! Keep your toga on, pal. Yuck! What do you mean, ""What's the point?"" You wanna go to Olympus, don't ya? Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere. You can't give up now. I'm countin' on ya. I gave this everything I had. Listen to me, kid. I seen 'em all.

So this is what heroes do on their days off. Nah. I'm no hero. Sure ya are. Everybody in Greece thinks you're the greatest thing since they put the pocket in pitta. I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I can't go anywhere without being mobbed. I mean... You sound like you could use a break. Think your nanny goat would go berserk if you played hooky this afternoon? Oh, gee, II don't know. Uh, Phil's got the rest of the day pretty much booked. Ah, Phil, schmill. Just follow me. Out the window, round the dumbbells, you lift up the back wall and we're gone. Wow. What a day. First, that restaurant by the bay, and then that play, that Oedipus thing. Man! I thought I had problems. Stop foolin' around! Yeah. Get the goods, sister. I didn't know that playing hooky could be so much fun. Yeah. Neither did I. Thanks, Meg. Oh. Don't thank me just yet. Oh! Oop. Careful. Sorry. Weak ankles. Oh, yeah?

Ruptured disks? No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.. Wonderboy, you are perfect. Thanks. Whoops! It looks better that way. No, it really does. You know, when I was a kid, I, I would have given anything to be exactly like everybody else. You wanted to be petty and dishonest? Everybody's not like that. Yes, they are. You're not like that. How do you know what I'm like? All I know is you're the most amazing person with weak ankles I've ever met. Oh! Meg, when I'm with you, II don't feel so alone. Sometimes it's better to be alone. What do you mean? Nobody can hurt you. Meg? I would never, ever hurt you. And I don't wanna hurt you, so let's both do ourselves a favour and stop this before we... All right! Break it up! Break it up! Party's over! I been lookin' all over this town! Calm down, mutton man. It was all my fault. You're already on my list, sister, so don't make it worse! And as for you, ya bum, you're gonna go to the stadium and you're gonna be put through the workout of your life! Now get on the horse. Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Ah, he'll get over it. Move! Move, move, move, move, move! Move! Hey, watch it, watch it! Watch it! Keep your googoo eyes on the... That's it. Next time, I drive. Oh, what's the matter with me? You'd think a girl would learn.  If there's a prize for rotten judgement   I guess I've already won that   No man is worth the aggravation   That's ancient history Been there, done that   Who d'ya think you're kidding He's the Earth and heaven to you   Try to keep it hidden Honey, we can see right through you   Oh, no  Girl, you can't conceal it   We know how you feel and who you're thinkin' of   Oh, no chance, no way I won't say it, no, no   You swoon, you sigh Why deny it?

What is the weak link in Wonderboy's chain? Get yourself another girl. I'm through. I'm sorry. Do you mind runnin' that by me again? I must have had a chunk of brimstone wedged in my ear or something. Then read my lips! Forget it. Meg, Meg, Meg, my sweet, deluded little minion. Aren't we forgetting one teensyweensy, but ever so crucial little, tiny detail? I own you! Oh, oh, I got another horn here. You work for me. That kid's gonna be doin' laps for a month. If I say, ""Sing,"" you say, ""Hey, name that tune."" If I say, ""I want Wonderboy's head on a platter,"" you say... Medium or welldone. I knew that dame was trouble. This is gonna break the kid's heart. I'll work on that. I'm sorry. You hear that sound? That's the sound of your freedom fluttering out the window forever. I don't care. I'm not gonna help you hurt him. I can't believe you're getting so worked up about some guy. This one is different. He's honest, and he's sweet... Please! He would never do anything to hurt me. He's a guy! Besides, O oneness, you can't beat him. He has no weaknesses. He's gonna... I think he does, Meg. I truly think he does. Hey, Phil! What happened to you? Kid, we gotta talk. Oh, Phil I just had the greatest day of my life! I, I, I can't stop thinking about Meg. She's something else. Kid, I'm tryin' to talk to ya! Will you come down here and listen? How can I come down there when I'm feeling so up? Gotcha! Ah, very nice! What I'm tryin' to say is... That if it wasn't for you, I never would have met her. Oh, I owe you big time, little guy. I do. Will you just knock it off for a couple of seconds? Rule number 38. Come on, Phil. Keep them up there, huh? Phil, I got two words for ya, duck! Listen to me! She's... A dream come true? Not exactly. More beautiful than Aphrodite? Aside from that! The most wonderful... She's a... She's a fraud! She's been playin' ya for a sap! Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around. I'm not kiddin' around. She... I know you're upset about today, but that's no reason to... Kid, you're missin' the point. The point is, I love her. She don't love you. You're crazy. She's nothin' but a twotimin'... Stop it! Nogood, lyin', schemin'... Shut up! Phil. I... Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. Okay, okay, that's it. You won't face the truth? Fine. Phil, wait. Where you going? I'm hoppin' the first barge out of here. I'm goin' home. Fine! G... Go! I don't... I don't need you. I thought you were gonna be the alltime champ, not the alltime chump. Geez Louise! What got his goat, huh? Name is Hades, Lord of the Dead. Hi. How ya doin'? Uh, not now, okay? Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds and I'm a fast talker, all right? See, I've got the major deal in the works. A real estate venture, if you will. And Herc, you little devil you. May I call you Herc? You seem to be constantly getting in the way of it, huh? You've got the wrong guy. Hear me out, ya little... Just hear me out, okay? So I would be eternally grateful if you would just take a day off from this hero business of yours. Jeez, I mean, monsters, natural disasters. You wait a day, okay? You're out of your mind. Not so fast, because, ya see, I do have a little leverage you might wanna know about. Meg! Don't listen, Herc... Let her go! Here's the tradeoff. You give up your strength for about 24 hours, okay? Say the next 24 hours. And Meg here is free as a bird and safe from harm. We dance, we kiss, we schmooze, we carry on, we go home happy. What do ya say? Come on. People are gonna get hurt, aren't they? Nah! I mean, it's a possibility. It happens 'cause, you know, it's war. But what can I tell ya? Anyway, what do you owe these people, huh? Isn't Meg, little smoochy face you, isn't she more important than they are? Stop it! Isn't she? You've gotta swear she'll be safe from any harm. Fine, okay. I'll give you that one. Meg is safe, otherwise you get your strength right back. Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate. Baboom. Okay? We're done. What d'ya say we shake on it? Hey, I really don't have, like, time to bat this around. I'm kind of on a schedule here. I got plans for August. Okay? I need an answer, like, now. Going once, going twice... All right! Yes, we're there! Bam! You may feel just a little queasy. It's kinda natural. Maybe you should sit down! Now you know how it feels to be just like everybody else. Isn't it just peachy? Oh! You'll love this. One more thing. Meg, babe, a deal's a deal. You're off the hook. And by the way, Herc, is she not a fabulous little actress? Stop it. What do you mean? I mean your little chickiepoo here was working for me all the time. Duh. You're... You're lying! Help! Jeepers, mister, you're really strong. Couldn't have done it without you, sugar, sweetheart, babe. No! It's... It's not like that. I didn't mean to... II couldn't... I... I'm so sorry. Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero! Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole cosmos up there waiting for me with, hey, my name on it. So much for the preliminaries, and now on to the main event! Brothers! Titans! Look at you in your squalid prison! Who put you down there? Zeus! And now that I set you free, what is the first thing you are going to do? Destroy him! Good answer. Crush Zeus! Freeze him! Melt Zeus! Blow him away! Zeus! Uh, guys? Huh? Olympus would be that way. Zeus! Freeze him! Hold it, bright eye. Huh? I have a special job for you, my optic friend. Huh? Huh? Destroy Zeus! Oh, we're in trouble! Oh, big trouble! I gotta... My lord and lady, the Titans have escaped, and they're practically at our gates! Sound the alarm! Launch an immediate counterattack! Go! Go! Gone, babe. Huh? Charge! On to battle! You windbag! Boom, baddaboom! Boom, boom! Ha! Hercules! Where are you? What can we do? Where is Hercules? Yeah, Hercules'll save us. Hercules! Come out! Face me! Oh, what are you doing? Without your strength, you'll be killed. Hercules! There are worse things. Run! Wait! Stop! Hey, look! It's Hercules. Thank the gods! We're saved! So... You mighty Hercules. Oh! Oh! Easy, horsefeathers. Stop twitching. Listen. Hercules is in trouble. We've gotta find Phil. He's the only one who can talk some sense into him. Get back, blast you! Ooh! Chihuahua! Zeus! Come on! Hurry up! We're shovin' off here! Phil! Phil, Hercules needs your help! What does he need me for when he's got friends like you? He won't listen to me. Good! He's finally learned something. Look, I know what I did was wrong, but this isn't about me. It's about him. If you don't help him now, Phil, he'll die. I need more thunderbolts! Uh, Hephaestus has been captured, my lord. Everyone's been captured. I've been captured! Hey, hey! Watch the glasses. Zeusy, I'm home! Hades. You're behind this! You are correct, sir! Flea. Hercules! Phil. Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back. Come on, you can take this bum. This guy's a pushover. Look at him. You were right all along, Phil. Dreams are for rookies. No, no, no, no, kid. Givin' up is for rookies. I came back 'cause I'm not quittin' on ya. I'm willing to go the distance. How 'bout you? Me bite off head! Whoa, baby! Hercules! Look out! Meg! No! What's happening? HHades' deal is broken. He promised I wouldn't get hurt. Meg. Why... why... why did ya... You didn't have to... Oh, people always do crazy things when they're in love. Oh, Meg. Meg, I... I... Are you always this articulate? You... You haven't got much time. You can still stop Hades. I'll watch over her, kid. You're gonna be all right. I promise. Let's go, Pegasus! Hup, two, three, four. Come on, everybody! I can't hear you! I swear to you, Hades, when I get out of this... I'm the one giving orders now, bolt boy. And I think I'm gonna like it here. Don't get too comfortable, Hades! Hercules! This ought to even the odds! Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man. Get them! Whoa! Hey! No! Get him! Not me! Him! Follow the fingers! Him! The yutz with the horse. Thank you, my boy. Nice horsey! My intentions were pure! I really was attracted to you. Throw! Ah! Now watch your old man work! Guys, get your titanic rears in gear and kick some Olympian butt! Whoa! Is my hair out? Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least I've got one swell consolation prize, a friend of yours who's dying to see me. Meg. Ha! Meg. Meg. Meg, no. Oh, I'm sorry, kid. There's some things you just can't change. Yes, I can. We were so close! So close. We tripped at the finish line. Why? Because our little nut, Meg, has to go all noble. Where's Meg? Look who's here. Wonderboy, you are too much. Let her go. Get a grip. Come here, come here. Let me show you around. Hmph. Well, well. It's a small underworld after all. Huh? Meg! No, no, no. Mustn't touch. You see, Meg's running with a new crowd these days. And not a very lively one, at that. You like making deals. Take me in Meg's place. Oh, hmph, well. The son of my hated rival trapped forever in a river of death. Going once. Hmm? Is there a downside to this? Going twice! Okay, okay, okay, okay. You get her out. She goes, you stay. Oh, you what slipped my mind? You'll be dead before you can get to her. That's not a problem, is it? Oh! What's the matter with these scissors? The thread won't cut. This is... This is impossible! You... You... You can't be alive. You'd have to be a, a... A god? A god? Hercules, stop! You can't do this to me. You can't... Fine. Okay. Listen. Okay. Well, I deserved that. Herc, Herc, Herc. Can we talk? YYour dad? He's a fun guy, right? So maybe you could put in a word with him, and he'd kinda blow this whole thing off, you know? Meg, Meg, talk to him. You know, a little schmooze, uh... Get away from me! Don't touch me! Get your slimy souls off me! He's not gonna be happy when he gets outta there. You mean, if he gets outta there. Taxi! If. If is good. Taxi! I don't feel so good. II feel a little... Wonderboy, what... Why did you... People always do crazy things when they're in love. Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Three cheers for the mighty Hercules! Oh, yeah! Flowers for everybody! Oh! Hercules, we're so proud of you. Mother. Fine work, my boy! You've done it! You're a true hero. You were willing to give your life to rescue this young woman. For a true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart. Now, at last, my son, you can come home. Congratulations, Wonderboy. You'll make one heck of a god. Father, this is the moment I've always dreamed of. But... A life without Meg, even an immortal life, would be empty. I... I wish to stay on Earth with her. I finally know where I belong. Hit it, ladies!

Pocahontas,Disney,1990,1995,Animation,"In sixteen hundred seven.  We sailed the open sea.  For glory, God and gold  and the Virginia Company.  For the New World is like heaven.  And we'll all be rich and free.  Or so we have been told  by the Virginia Company.  So we have been told  by the Virginia Company.  For glory, God and gold  and the Virginia Company.  Ready to hoist the cannon? Right!  Hey, look. Is that Smith? That's him, all right. The old sea dog. Captain John Smith. I've heard some amazing stories about him. Are you coming on this voyage too? Of course he is, you halfwit. You can't fight Indians without John Smith. That's right. I'm not about to let you boys have all the fun. On the beaches of Virginny.  There's diamonds like debris.  There silver rivers flow and  gold you pick right off a tree.  With a nugget for my Winnie.  And another one for me.  And all the rest will go  to the Virginia Company.  To glory, God and gold.  And the Virginia Company.  Haul on the brace! Come on, come on! Do your best! Watch out! Faster! She's taking on more water! Look out! John! Get down here! The cannons are breaking loose! Reef the topsails!  Yes, sir! Steady on your course. It's all right, Thomas. We'll get her tied off. Say your prayers, men! Thomas, watch it! Help! Man overboard! Help! Stay your course! He's lost! Help! Pull the pins! Aye, sir! Smith! Smith! Are you crazy? Hang on, Thomas! I've got you! Quick! The rope! Heave! Come on, lads! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Put your back into it! Pull! Pull! Hang on! There, my lucky lads. Well, that was refreshing. Well done, Smith. Of course, you'd all do the same for me. Oh, sure, sure. Of course we would. Sure, yes. Yeah, we would. Absolutely! Trouble on deck? Governor Ratcliffe. Thomas fell overboard, sir. Thank heavens he's been successfully retrieved. Well done, Smith. Thank you, sir. Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long before we reach the New World. And remember what awaits us there. Freedom, prosperity... the adventure of our lives. You're the finest crew England has to offer, and nothing... Not wind nor rain nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages... Shall stand in our way. Carry on, men! A stirring oration, sir. I'm sure the men were most exhilarated. Let us hope so. I'll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won't I? This New World's gonna be great, John. I'm gonna get a pile of gold, build me a big house... and if any Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him. You just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas. Leave the savages to me. You think they'll give us much trouble? Not as much trouble as Smith'll give them. We'll kill ourselves an Injun. Or maybe two or three. We're stalwart men and bold of the Virginia Company. What do you suppose the New World will look like? Like all the others, I suppose. I've seen hundreds of new worlds, Thomas. What could possibly be different about this one? It's glory, God and gold  and the Virginia Company.  Steady as the beating drum.  Singing to the cedar flute.  Seasons go and seasons come.  Bring the corn and bear the fruit.  By the waters sweet and clean.  Where the mighty sturgeon lives.  Plant the squash and reap the bean.  All the Earth our mother gives.  Oh, great spirit, hear our song.  Help us keep the ancient ways.  Keep the sacred fire strong.  Walk in balance all our days.  Seasons go and seasons come.  Steady as the beating drum.  Plum to seed to bud to plum.  Steady as the beating drum.  It's good to be home. The Massawomecks are defeated! With the help of our brothers, our villages are safe again. Your return has brought much joy to the village. Look at all the smiling faces. Yes, but there's one smiling face I don't see. Where is my daughter? You know Pocahontas. She has her mother's spirit. She goes wherever the wind takes her. Pocahontas! Your father's back! Come down here! He's back, Flit. Come on, Meeko! No! Not that way. Showoff. Uhoh! Pocahontas? Pocahontas! Are you all right? Well, you better be all right because I'm not coming in after you! Don't you think we're getting a... A little old for these games? Help me turn this thing over. What were you doing up there? Thinking. Meeko! About the dream again? Have you figured it out yet? I know it means something. I just don't know what. You should ask your father about it. Maybe I should. Come on, Flit. Quit playing around. We have to get back. Faced a determined enemy. The battle lasted from the rising of the sun until the evening shadows fell. Our warriors fought with courage, but none as bravely as Kocoum... for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear. He has proven himself to be the greatest of warriors... Oh, he is so handsome. And the finest among us... Hmph. I especially love his smile. Destroying every enemy in his path. Tonight we will feast in his honour. My daughter. Winggapao, Father. Seeing you gives me great joy. I'm so glad you've come home safely. Come with me. We have much to talk about. I want to hear everything you've been doing. Father, for many nights now I've been having a very strange dream. I think it's telling me something's about to happen. Something exciting. Yes, something exciting is about to happen. Really? What is it? Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage. Marry Kocoum? I told him it would make my heart soar. But he's so serious. My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband. He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house with sturdy walls. With him, you will be safe from harm. Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path. This is the right path for you. But why can't I choose... Pocahontas, come with me. You are the daughter of the chief. It is time to take your place among our people. Even the wild mountain stream... must someday join the big river. As the river cuts his path.  Though the river's proud and strong.  He will choose the smoothest course.  That's why rivers live so long.  They're steady.  As the steady beating drum.  Your mother wore this for our wedding. It was her dream to see you wear it at your own. It suits you. He wants me to be steady like the river. But it's not steady at all. What I love most about rivers is you  can't step in the same river twice.  The water's always changing  always flowing.  But people, I guess can't live like  that. We all must pay a price.  To be safe we lose our  chance of ever knowing.  What's around the river bend.  Waiting just around the river bend  I look once more just  around the river bend.  Beyond the shore where  the gulls fly free.  Don't know what for.  What I dream the day might send.  Just around the river bend.  For me.  Coming for me.  I feel it there beyond those trees  or right behind these waterfalls.  Can I ignore that sound  of distant drumming.  For a handsome sturdy husband who builds  handsome, sturdy walls.  And never dreams that  something might be coming.  Just around the river bend.  Just around the river bend.  I look once more just  around the river bend.  Beyond the shore.  Somewhere past the sea.  Don't know what for.  Why do all my dreams extend.  Just around the river bend.  Just around the river bend.  Should I choose the smoothest course.  Steady as the beating drum.  Should I marry Kocoum.  Is all my dreaming at an end.  Or do you still.  Wait for me.  Dream giver.  Just around the river.  Bend.  Is that my Pocahontas? Grandmother Willow, I need to talk to you. Good morning, child. I was hoping you'd visit today. Oh! Why, your mother's necklace! That's what I wanted to talk to you about. My father wants me to marry Kocoum. Kocoum? But he's so serious. I know. My father thinks it's the right path for me. But lately, I've been having this dream and I think it's... Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it. Quiet! Quiet! Now, child, you were saying. Well, I'm running through the woods... and then, right there in front of me, is an arrow. As I look at it, it starts to spin. A spinning arrow. How unusual. Yes. It spins faster and faster and faster until suddenly it stops. Hmm. Well, it seems to me... this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path. But, Grandmother Willow, what is my path? How am I ever going to find it? Your mother asked me the very same question. She did? What did you tell her? I told her to listen. All around you are spirits, child. They live in the earth, the water, the sky. If you listen, they will guide you. I hear the wind. Yes. What is it telling you? I don't understand. You will understand.  Listen with your heart.  You will understand.  Let it break upon you.  Like a wave upon the sand.  It's saying something's coming. Strange clouds? Listen with your heart.  You will understand.  What do you see? Clouds. Strange clouds. Look at it, Wiggins. An entire new world chock full of gold... just waiting for me. And scores of adventures waiting for us. Right, Percy? Do you think we'll meet some savages? If we do, we shall be sure... to give them a proper English greeting. Ooh, gift baskets. Oh, no. And he came so highly recommended. It's perfect, Governor. The water's deep enough. We can pull right up to shore. Hey there, Percy. Very well, then. Give the order. Already done, sir. I've got a crew assembled and they're ready to go. About the natives, I'm counting on you... to make sure those filthy heathens don't disrupt our mission. Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before, it's nothing I can't handle. Right. That'll be all, Smith. There's a good man. See you, Percy. The men like Smith, don't they? I've never been a popular man. I like you. And don't think I don't know what those back stabbers at court say about me. Oh, yes, all that talk about being a pathetic social climber who's failed at everything... He's tried. I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory. But mark my words, Wiggins. When King James sees the gold these peasants unearth... success will be mine at last. Wake up! Shake a leg! Top off the yardarm! It's incredible! And it's all ours. I've never seen anything like it. It could look like Ratcliffe's knickers, for all I care... just as long as I get off this stinkin' boat. Come on, men. We didn't come all this way just to look at it. Keep it taut, lads. Keep it taut. Steady! Steady! Hold up! That's far enough. All right, now. Tie her off. Here, John, tie off this end. John? John? What are you doing up there? Getting a better look. Hey! Well. You're a strangelooking fellow. Are you hungry? Here you go. Ah, it's a biscuit. It's food. Well, sort of. You like it, eh? Well, try eating it for four months straight. You got a friend back there? Hey! Wh... What? Watch out. What? Get... No, get... Uh, look out. John, you better get down here. The governor's coming ashore. All right. All right. I'm leaving. Did you see their skin? They have hair on their faces like dogs. My brothers, we must know more about these visitors. Kekata, what do you see? These are not men like us... but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun... and weapons that spout fire and thunder. They prowl the Earth like ravenous wolves... consuming everything in their path. Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors to the river and attack. We will destroy these invaders the way we destroyed the Massawomecks. Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy. But these pale visitors are strange to us. Take some men to the river to observe them. Let us hope they do not intend to stay. I hereby claim this land and all its riches... in the name of His Majesty King James the First... and do so name this settlement Jamestown. Bravo! Bravo! Beautifully spoken, sir. Hurry now, Percy. We must be all squeaky clean for the New World. Captain Smith, it appears I've selected the perfect location, eh? Not a savage in sight. Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they're not out there, sir. Well, then perhaps you should venture forth and determine their whereabouts, hmm? If there are any Indians out there, I'll find them. Now, gentlemen, to work. You men, get the ship unloaded. Right, sir. You men, build the fort. The rest of you, break out the shovels. It's time to start digging. Digging?  Digging? Why, of course. Let's not forget what the Spanish found when they came to the New World. Gold! Mountains of it. Why, for years they've been ravaging the New World... of its most precious resources... but now... it's our turn. The gold of Cortez.  The jewels of Pizarro.  Will seem like mere trinkets  by this time tomorrow.  The gold we find here  will dwarf them by far.  Oh, with all you got in ya, boys.  Dig up Virginia, boys.  Mine, boys. Mine every mountain.  And dig, boys. Dig 'til you drop.  Grab a pick, boys. Quick, boys.  Shove in a shovel.  Uncover those lovely pebbles  that sparkle and shine.  It's gold and it's mine.  Mine, mine.  Dig and dig and diggety dig.  And dig and dig and diggety dig.  Hei, nonny, nonny. Hei, nonny, nonny.  Ooh, how I love it.  Hei, nonny, nonny. Hei, nonny, nonny.  Riches for cheap.  Hei, nonny, nonny. Ho, nonny, nonny.  There'll be heaps of it.  And I'll be on top of the heap.  Diggety, diggety, dig.  My rivals back home.  It's not that I'm bitter.  But think how they'll squirm.  when they see how I glitter.  The ladies at court  will be all atwitter.  The king will reward me.  He'll knight me. No, lord me.  It's mine, mine. Mine for the taking.  It's mine, boys. Mine me that gold.  With those nuggets dug.  It's glory they'll gimme.  My dear friend King Jimmy  will probably build me a shrine.  When all of the gold.  When all of the gold.  Is mined.  Dig and dig and diggety dig.  And dig and dig and diggety dig.  All of my life I have searched  for a land like this one.  A wilder, more challenging  country I couldn't design.  Hundreds of dangers await  and I don't plan to miss one.  In a land I can claim.  A land I can tame.  The greatest adventure is mine.  Keep on working, lads.  Mine  Don't be shirking, lads.  Mine, boys, mine  Find a mother lode.  Then mine another load.  Mine me that gold.  Dig, dig and diggety.  Beautiful gold.  Dig, dig for that gold.  Make this island my land.  Make the mounds big, boys.  I'd help you to dig, boys  But I've got this crick in my spine.  This land we behold.  This beauty untold.  A man can be bold.  It all can be sold.  So go for the gold  The gold is  All the riches here.  Mine.  From this minute this land.  Mine And what's in it.  Is mine.  And dig and dig and diggety dig.  Hey, nonny, nonny. It's mine.  No! Wait. Please. Please! Don't run off. It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you. Here. Let me help you out of there. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? It's all right. Listen with your heart.  You will understand.  Let it break upon you.  Like a wave upon the sand.  Who are you? Listen with your heart. You will understand.  Pocahontas. What? What did you say? My name is Pocahontas. I'm John Smith. That's it. Keep at it, men. Keep digging. It's got to be here somewhere. There's 30 more of them down by the ridge. That makes more than a hundred. Anything yet? Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir. Um, how long are we going to keep digging like this, sir? Aye. We're slaving away, busting our backs day and night... for... For king and country. I know, I know. And I share your fatigue. Mmm. Wiggins? Wiggins? Coming! Dispose of this. Who's a good doggy, hmm? Who's a good doggy? Fetch, boy! Savages! It's an ambush! Arm yourselves! Run! Arm yourselves! Make sure every man has a musket. Shoot! Them, you idiot! Where's that blasted Smith when I need him? Namontack! Back to the village. Shut up. Shut up, you fools! They'll be back. Everyone, back to camp. Get the rest of the cannons ashore and finish building the fort! Aye, Governor. And you. Learn to use that thing properly. A man's not a man unless he knows how to shoot. These beasts invade our shores, and now this. This wound is strange to me. We will fight this enemy, but we cannot do it alone. Kocoum, send messengers to every village in our nation. We will call on our brothers to help us fight. These white men are dangerous. No one is to go near them. It's called a helmet. Helmet. So, uh, what river is this? Quiyoughcohannock. You have the most unusual names here. Pocahontas. You have the most unusual name too. John Smith. Hey! Is this bottomless pit a friend of yours? Meeko! Well, how do you do, Meeko? It's all right. It's just a handshake. Here, let me show you. Nothing's happening. Uh, no, no. I need your hand first. It's how we say hello. This is how we say hello. And how we say goodbye. I like hello better. Yeah, I remember you. Flit just doesn't like strangers. Well, I'm not a stranger any more. Hmm. Stubborn little fellow, isn't he? Very stubborn. Hey! Meeko, come back here. Don't worry. He can't hurt it. Hey! What are you doing? Get... Meeko, bring that back! NNo, it's all right. He can keep it. Call it a gift. What was that? My compass. Compass? It tells you how to find your way when you get lost. But it's all right. I'll get another one in London. London. Is that your village? Yes. It's a very big village. What's it like? Well, it's got streets filled with carriages, bridges over the rivers... and buildings as tall as trees. I'd like to see those things. You will. How? We're going to build them here. We'll show your people how to use this land properly, how to make the most of it. Make the most of it? Yes. We'll build roads and decent houses and... Our houses are fine. You think that only because you don't know any better. WWait a minute. Don't take it tha... Hey. Hey! Wait! WaWait! There's so much we can teach you. We've improved the lives of savages all over the world. Savages? Uh, not that you're a savage. Just my people. No. Listen. That's not what I meant. Let me explain, uh... Let go! No, I'm not letting you leave. Look, don't do this. Savage is just a word, uh, you know. A term for people who are uncivilized. Like me. Well, when I say uncivilized, what I mean is, is... What you mean is, not like you. You think I'm an ignorant savage.  And you've been so many places  I guess it must be so.  But still I cannot see.  If the savage one is me.  How can there be so much  that you don't know.  You don't know.  You think you own whatever  land you land on.  The Earth is just a dead  thing you can claim.  But I know every rock  and tree and creature.  Has a life, has a spirit.  Has a name.  You think the only  people who are people.  Are the people who look  and think like you.  But if you walk the footstep as  of a stranger.  You'll learn things  you never knew you never knew.  Have you ever heard the wolf cry  to the blue corn moon.  Or asked the grinning bobcat  why he grinned.  Can you sing with all the voices  of the mountain.  Can you paint  with all the colours of the wind.  Can you paint with all the colours.  Of the wind.  Come run the hidden Paine trails  of the forest.  Come taste the sun sweet berries  of the Earth.  Come roll in all the riches  all around you.  And for once never wonder  what they're worth.  The rainstorm and the river  are my brothers.  The heron and the otter are my friends.  And we are all connected to each other.  In a circle In a hoop that never ends.  How high does the sycamore grow.  If you cut it down then  you'll never know.  And you'll never hear the wolf  cry to the blue corn moon.  For whether we are white  or copperskinned.  We need to sing with all  the voices of the mountain.  We need to paint with all  the colours of the wind.  You can own the Earth and still.  All you'll own is earth until.  You can paint.  With all the colours.  Of the wind.  What is it? The drums. They mean trouble. I shouldn't be here. I want to see you again. I can't. Please, don't leave. I'm sorry. I have to go. All right! This one's ready to hoist! Two on each side. Ready now. Push! Watch it. It's slippery. Come on, lads. It's only a little picket fence. Steady. Steady. There you go. That'll keep everything out, eh, John? Something wrong, John? What? You've been awfully quiet the last few days. Oh, he's just mad that he missed all the action. Ah, don't worry, John. You'll get your chance to deal with the Indians. Yeah, we'll take care of them like we did last time, eh, mates? We shot ourselves an Injun or maybe two or three. All right, you howling nutter, get to work! Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun. Oh, sure, we're having loads of fun, right? Look at us. No gold, no food. While Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day, happy as a clam. I am doomed! I should be wallowing in riches by now and I haven't found as much as a speck! Think. Think! It's got to be around here somewhere. Where could it be? I've mined the forests and the hills and the swamps. And nothing! Why can't I find it? What am I overlooking? I... I... I made it myself. Take that silly... Of course! The Indians. Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us? Because we invaded their land and cut down their trees and dug up their earth? It's the gold! They have it and they don't want us to take it from them. Well, I'll just have to take it by force, then, won't I? You there! Where's Captain Smith? Well, he's gone. Aye. Your singing must have scared them off. Well, then go get him, for heaven's sake! What if we run into the Indians? That's what guns are for. Now arm yourselves and get moving! Pocahontas. You should be inside the village. We'll be all right. We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive. Don't go far. Now is not the time to be running off. Yes, Father. When I see you wear that necklace... you look just like your mother. I miss her. But she is still with us. Whenever the wind moves through the trees, I feel her presence. Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength. Someday, they will look to you as well. I would be honoured by that. You shouldn't be out here alone. I'll send for Kocoum. All right. What is it? What? You're hiding something. I'm not hiding anything. Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise I won't tell anyone. Pocahontas, look! It's one of them! I'm going to get... What are you doing here? I had to see you again. Huh? Pocahontas. Pocahontas? Please, don't say anything. Quick, this way. But... Nakoma. Huh? Where is Pocahontas? I... I haven't seen her. Pocahontas can't keep running off. It's dangerous out there. Tell her that. She listens to you. Huh. Sure she does. This place is incredible. And to think we came all this way just to dig it up for gold. Gold? Hey, Meeko. What's gold? You know, it's, uh... it's, it's yellow. It comes out of the ground. It's really valuable. Oh! Here, we have lots of it. Gold. No. Gold is this. Hmm. There's nothing like that around here. No gold. Not that I've seen. All this way for nothing. Well, those boys are in for a big surprise. Will they leave? Some of them might. Will you go home? Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to. I've never really belonged anywhere. You could belong here. What was that? Did you see something? No. No. I just, uh... I... I didn't see anything, did I? Look again. Let it break upon you.  Like a wave upon the sand.  Hello, John Smith. Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me. Then you should talk back. Don't be frightened, young man. My bark is worse than my bite. Say something. What do you say to a tree? Anything you want. So, uh... Come closer, John Smith. He has a good soul. And he's handsome too. Oh, I like her. I knew you would. Smith! Smith! Where are you, mate? We can't let them see us. Quick! Over here. This place gives me the creeps. Savages could be hiding anywhere. Aye. Well, if you spot one, don't ask questions. Just shoot. Watch your feet, you big oaf! It wasn't me. It was the tree. Oh, of course! The tree just felt like lifting its roots and... Let's get out of here. Ow! Ow! Run! But what about Smith? He's a big lad. He can take care of himself. I'm glad you're on our side. There's still some snap in these old vines. I'd better get back before they send the whole camp out after me. When will I see you again? Meet me tonight. Right here. Well, I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years. What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again. I mean, I want to see him again. Who wouldn't? I want to see him again. But still, something inside is telling me it's the right thing. Perhaps it's your dream. My dream? Do you think he's the one the spinning arrow was pointing to? Hmm. The warriors are here! Pocahontas, are you crazy? What were you doing with one of them? There you are. Kocoum. Look at them. Now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons. Now that we are joined by our brothers... we will defeat this enemy. Father, I need to speak with you. Not now, my daughter. The council is gathering. We don't have to fight them! There must be a better way. Sometimes our paths are chosen for us. But maybe we should try talking to them. They do not want to talk. But if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn't you? Pocahontas. Wouldn't you? Of course I would. But it is not that simple. Nothing is simple any more. Easy, Thomas. It's me. Oh, John. I could've killed you. Not aiming like that, you couldn't. Keep both eyes open when you shoot. You'll see twice as well. Smith, there you are! We were looking all over for you. Smith! Where have you been? I was out scouting the terrain, sir. Excellent. Then you must know the Indians' whereabouts. We'll need that information for the battle. What battle? We will eliminate these savages once and for all. No! You can't do that. Oh, can't I? Look, we don't have to fight them. John, what's gotten into you? I met one of them. You what? A savage? They're not savages. They can help us. They know the land. They know how to navigate the rivers. And look. It's food. What is it? It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure. I like gruel. They don't want to feed us, you ninnies! They want to kill us, all of us! They've got our gold, and they'll do anything to keep it! But there is no gold. No gold? And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this? Yes. Lies! Lies! All of it! Murderous thieves! There's no room for their kind in civilized society. But this is their land! This is my land! I make the laws here. And I say anyone who so much as looks at an Indian... without killing him on sight will be tried for treason... and hanged! Pocahontas! Nakoma! Don't go out there. I lied for you once. Don't ask me to do it again. I have to do this. He's one of them. You don't know him. If you go out there, you'll be turning your back on your own people. I'm trying to help my people. Pocahontas, please. You're my best friend. I don't want you to get hurt. I won't. I know what I'm doing. Pocahontas, no! Ratcliffe wouldn't take us halfway around the world for nothin'. But what if Smith is right? What if there is no gold? If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left London. Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots. Those savages didn't attack us for nothin'. They're hidin' somethin'. If they do have the gold, I reckon we'll have to fight 'em. Not me. Either too hot or too cool. I haven't been comfortable since we got here. Oh, I know. I've been itching a lot. Follow him. Yes, Governor. I want to know where he's sneaking off to. Yes, sir. And if you happen to see any Indians, shoot them. Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier. Don't disappoint me again. Kocoum. What is it? It's Pocahontas. What's wrong? Is she all right? I think she's in trouble. The Earth is trembling, child. What's happened? The warriors are here! Pocahontas! John. Listen to me. My men are planning to attack your people. You've got to warn them. Maybe it's not too late to stop this. You have to come with me and talk to my father. Pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good. I already tried talking to my men, but everything about this land has them spooked. That's the strangest creature I've ever seen. Percy. Easy, Percy. Come here! Meeko, come back! You see what I mean? Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them. Come... Come here, both of you! It's all right! It's all right! He's a friend! Bad! Bad dog! Sit! What are you doing? Meeko! Percy, get back here! What are you doing? Stop that! All right, that's enough! It's enough to make your sap boil. Now then, there's something I want to show you. Look. The ripples. What about them? So small at first, then look how they grow. But someone has to start them. They're not going to listen to us. Young man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one. Don't you see? Only when the fighting stops can you be together. All right. Let's go talk to your father. No! Kocoum! No! Kocoum! Leave him alone! Kocoum! Stop! Both eyes open. Thomas! Is he... You killed him. I thought that... Get away from him! Pocahontas, it won't help! He was only... He killed him! Thomas, get out of here! Get out of here! Who did this? Pocahontas was out in the woods. Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked him. Your weapons are strong, but now our anger is stronger. At sunrise he will be the first to die. But, Father... I told you to stay in the village. You disobeyed me. You have shamed your father! I was only trying to help. Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead! Take him away! Kocoum was just coming to protect me. Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you. I was worried about you. II thought I was doing the right thing. All this happened because of me. And now I'll never see John Smith again. Come with me. Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes of the man who killed Kocoum. Be quick. Pocahontas. I'm so sorry. For what, this? I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this. Can't think of any right now, but... It would've been better if we'd never met. None of this would've happened. Pocahontas, look at me. I'd rather die tomorrow... than live a hundred years without knowing you. Pocahontas. I can't leave you. You never will. No matter what happens to me, I'll always be with you. Forever. Help! Somebody help! Help! Help! Easy, lad. What is it? It's Smith! They got him! Who got him? The savages! Savages? They captured him, dragged him off! Where'd they take him? They headed north. How many were there? I don't know. At least a dozen. Filthy beasts! Ratcliffe was right! It's perfect, Wiggins. I couldn't have planned this better myself. The gold is as good as mine. We've got to save him! He'd do the same for any of us! Thomas is right! We've got to do somethin'! And so we shall. I told you those savages couldn't be trusted. That's right! Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they've done to him! Yeah, that's right. But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade. At daybreak, we attack! What can you expect from  filthy little heathens.  Here's what you get  when races are diverse.  That's right.  Their skins are hellish red  They're only good when dead.  They're vermin, as I said and worse.  They're savages, savages.  Barely even human.  Savages, savages.  Drive them from our shore.  They're not like you and me  which means they must be evil.  We must sound the drums of war.  They're savages, savages  Dirty shrieking devils.  Now we sound the drums of war.  This is what we feared  The paleface is a demon.  The only thing they  feel at all is greed.  Beneath that milky hide  there's emptiness inside.  I wonder if they even bleed.  They're savages, savages.  Barely even human.  Savages, savages.  Killers at the core.  They're different from us  which means they can't be trusted.  We must sound the drums of war.  They're savages, savages.  First we deal with this one.  Then we sound the drums of war.  Savages, savages.  Let's go get a few, men! Savages, savages.  Now it's up to you, men.  Savages  Savages.  Barely even human.  Now we sound the drums...  Of...  War.  They're going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow. You have to stop them. I can't. Child, remember your dream. I was wrong, Grandmother Willow. I followed the wrong path. I feel so lost. The compass? Spinning arrow. It's the arrow from your dream. I was right! It was pointing to him. Sunrise. It's not too late, child. Let the spirits of the Earth guide you. You know your path, child. Now follow it! This will be the day.  Let's go, men! This will be the morning.  Bring out the prisoner! We will see them dying in the dust.  I don't know what I can do  Still, I know I've got to try.  Now we make 'em pay.  Eagle, help my feet to fly.  Now, without a warning.  Mountain, help my heart be great.  Now we leave 'em blood  and bone and rust.  Spirits of the Earth and sky.  It's them or us.  Please don't let it be too late.  They're just a bunch of.  Filthy, stinking savages.  Savages.  Demon. Devil  Kill them!  Savages, savages.  What are we waiting for.  Destroy their evil race  until there's not a trace left.  How loud.  We will sound the drums of war.  Are the drums of war.  Now we sound the drums of war.  Now we see what comes  of trying to be chums.  Now we sound the drums.  Is the death of all I love  carried in the drumming of...  War  No! If you kill him, you'll have to kill me too. Daughter, stand back. I won't! I love him, Father. What? Look around you. This is where the path of hatred has brought us. This is the path I choose, Father. What will yours be? My daughter speaks with a wisdom beyond her years. We have all come here with anger in our hearts... but she comes with courage and understanding. From this day forward, if there is to be more killing... it will not start with me. Release him. Now's our chance! Fire! No! What? They let him go. They don't want to fight. It's a trick! Don't you see? Fire! Fine. I'll settle this myself. No! John! You shot him! He stepped right... right into it. It's his own fault. Smith was right all along. We never should've listened to you. Get the gun! Traitors! Unhand me, I say! How dare you! Put him in chains! I'll see you all hanged for this! And gag him as well! Is he gonna make it, Thomas? The sooner he gets back to England, the better. Well, let's hope the wind is with him. Is the ship ready yet? Any minute now. Just loadin' the last bit of cargo. How dare you! Untie me at once! I'll have your heads for this! And he came so highly recommended. The ship's almost ready. We'd better get you on board. We'll lose the tide. No, not yet. She said she'd be here. Look. Going back is his only chance. He'll die if he stays here. Here. It's from Grandmother Willow's bark. It'll help with the pain. What pain? I've had worse pain than this. Can't think of any right now, but... You are always welcome among our people. Thank you, my brother. I thought you didn't like strangers. My mother's necklace. See ya, Percy. Come with me? You must choose your own path. I'm needed here. Then I'll stay with you. No. You have to go back. But I can't leave you. You never will. No matter what happens, I'll always be with you. Forever. Good luck, lad. Godspeed, John. The crew aready? Aye, sir! Set the mainsails! Weigh anchor! Let go of the top gallants! Aye, sir! If I never knew you  if I never felt this love  I would have no inkling of.  How precious life can be.  And I'm so grateful to you  I'd have lived my whole life through.  Lost forever  if I never knew you  if I never knew you  I'd be safe but half as real.  Never knowing I could feel.  A love so strong and true.  Oh, if I never knew you.  There's no moment I'd regret  if I never knew your love.  Since the moment that we met  I would have no inkling of.  If our time has gone too fast.  How precious life can be.  I've lived at last.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought our love  would be so beautiful.  So beautiful.  Somehow we'd make the whole world bright  I thought our love  would be so beautiful.  We'd turn the darkness into light.  And still my heart is  saying we were right.  We were right.  And if I never knew you.  If I never knew you  I'd have lived my whole life through.  Empty as the sky.  Never knowing why.  Lost forever.  If I never knew.  You.  Yeah.  You think you own whatever  land you land on.  The earth is just a dead  thing you can claim.  But I know every rock  and tree and creature.  Has a life, has a spirit.  Has a name.  You think the only people  who are people.  Are the people who look  and think like you.  But if you walk the  footsteps of a stranger.  You'll learn things you  never knew you never knew.  Have you ever heard the wolf cry.  To the blue corn moon.  Or let the eagle tell  you where he's been.  Can you sing with all the  voices of the mountain.  Can you paint with all  the colours of the wind.  Can you paint with all  the colours of the wind.  How high does the sycamore grow  if you cut it down.  Then you'll never know.

No, you have to take it back. Take him back? But he'll die. If the jungle wants him... I want him. I cannot let you put our family in danger. Does he look dangerous to you? Was it alone? Yes. Sabor killed his family. Are you sure? Yes. There are no others. Then you may keep him. Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son. I said he could stay. That doesn't make him my son. We will nest here for the night. So, what you gonna call it? I'm gonna call him... ...Tarzan. Tarzan? OK, he's your baby. All right, little lady, come on. It's past your nest time. Oh, Mom.

Tarzan. Tarzan? I sure scared you, Mom. You sure did. Can't you imitate any quieter animal? Mom, they're no fun. Wanna see me be a leopard? Why don't you just come up with your own sound? Kala. Oops. Tarzan! Thank goodness you're all right! Kala and I have been so worried. Thank you so much for finding him, Kerchak. You are such a wise and caring leader. Run. Hello! Are you thick in the head? What? How many times do I have to tell you? If you want Kerchak to like you, stay away from him. Come on, Terk, step on it! Last one there is a dung beetle! The first one's gotta eat it. Terk, can I come? Well, you could if you could keep up, but, you know, you can't really keep up. Wait up, guys! Wait up! Right behind you! You're standing on my spleen. Take that! Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. The fun has arrived Thank you very much. What took you so long? I had a little pest control problem, but it's all taken care of. Hi, guys. Terk, what is this, some kind ofjoke? Tell me I'm not looking at the hairless wonder. Well, Terk said I could come along if I could keep up. No, no. Terk. Come on. I'll handle this, guys, OK? Listen, buddy. Come here. We got a tiny, little, itsybitsy problem here, OK? I'd love to hang out with you. You know I would. But the guys... they need a little convincing, you know? OK, what do I gotta do? Do? What do you gotta do? It's so stupid. What? Well, you gotta... you gotta go get a hair. A hair? Yeah, a hair. An elephant hair. An elephant hair? Like I said, it's stupid, right? Listen, take it from me. Go home. OK? Who needs this aggravation? You know, I'm probably gonna leave soon myself. You go, I'll catch up, all right? You see? Leave it to me. I told you I could... Tarzan! Tarzan! That one hurt him. Look! There he is! He's alive! Hey, guys! Hi. Come back! Come back. This guy's great. If he lives, you should bring him around more often. Come on, come on. Let's go get a better seat. You can never get enough sleep, let me tell you. I get enough sleep. Mom? It burns up the calories. Are you sure this water's sanitary? It looks questionable to me. It's fine, honey. But what about bacteria? Tantor, can't you see Mummy's talking? Watch out! There's something swimming! It's coming right at you! Honey, Mummy's losing her patience. But this time I really see something. Oh, boy. Piranha! It's a piranha! Sweetheart, there are no piranhas in Africa. Don't tell the kid that. Of course there are piranhas in Africa. No, she's right. They're native to South America. Get outta here. It's true. No way. Come on, now. Think I'd be here if there were? It's right behind you! Run! For the last time, honey, there are no piranhas in... My butt! Told you! There's something on my butt! What is it? Are there any more of them? What is it? It's a piranha. Piranha! Tantor, where are you? He's dead. We're dead! We didn't do it! They're the ones! Oh, thank you, Kerchak. Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on! Tarzan, don't die on me! Don't die! You weren't supposed to do it! Get away! Don't you know a piranha can strip your flesh in seconds? What? He's not a piranha! He's alive! He's alive! He's alive! He's alive! He's... You idiot! You nearly gave me a heart attack! You happy? I don't believe it. You got the hair? Is that what this is all about? I got a whole tail of them. Tarzan? Terkina? Oh, no. Who's that? My mom. Tarzan. Hi. Hi, Aunt Kala. Oh, you scared me! What happened? Well, I... It's sort of a long... It's involved. Because what happened, it was a weird... What happened? It was my fault, Kerchak. Tarzan. We were playing, and... Well, I'm sorry, Kerchak. You almost killed someone. It was an accident. He's only a child. That's no excuse. You can't keep defending him. He'll learn. You can't learn to be one of us. You never give him a chance. Give him a chance? Kala, look at him. He will never be one of us. Kerchak! Tarzan. Tarzan, what are you doing? Why am I so different? You're covered with mud, that's why. Kerchak said I didn't belong in... Close your mouth. Kerchak said I don't belong in the family. Never mind what Kerchak said. Hold still. But look at me! I am, Tarzan. And do you know what I see? I see two eyes, like mine, and a nose, somewhere. Here. Two ears. And let's see, what else? Two hands? That's right. Close your eyes. Now, forget what you see. What do you feel? My heart. Come here. Your heart. See? We're exactly the same. Kerchak just can't see that. I'll make him see it. I'll be the best ape ever. Oh, I bet you will. Oh, the power to be strong And the wisdom to be wise All these things will come to you in time On this journey that you're making There'll be answers that you'll seek And it's you who'll climb the mountain It's you who'll reach the peak Son of Man, look to the sky Lift your spirit, set it free Someday you'll walk tall with pride Son of Man, a man in time you'll be Though there's no one there to guide you No one to take your hand But with faith and understanding You will journey from boy to man Son of Man, look to the sky Lift your spirit, set it free Someday you'll walk tall with pride Son of Man, a man in time you'll be In learning you will teach And in teaching you will learn You'll find your place beside the ones you love Oh, and all the things you dreamed of The visions that you saw Well, the time is drawing near now It's yours to claim it all Son of Man, look to the sky Lift your spirit, set it free Someday you'll walk tall with pride Son of Man, a man in time you'll be Son of Man Son of Man's a man for all to see Don't even think about it. How'd you know it was me? I'm your mother. I know everything. Where have you been? I thought you knew everything. Hey, Auntie K, you're looking remarkably groomed today. Hello, Terk. Not the neck! Not the neck there, T. Watch it! OK, it's all fun and games till someone loses an eye. Please stop. Somebody's gonna get hurt here. And it's always me. Cramp in the calf. Please! OK. OK, you win. OK, OK, you win. Hello! Down here. Yo, yo! Let go! Oh, sorry, Terk. What kind of animal are you? I been thinking lately that maybe Tarzan could be some subspecies of elephant. What are you, crazy? An elephant? Listen to me. Think about it. He enjoys a peanut, I enjoy a peanut. He looks nothing like you. OK everybody, move aside. Outta my way. Best friend coming through. That would be me. And you, don't make a habit of that. There are other ways of getting attention. I'll try to remember that. All right. I was right behind you. I had you covered. What was that? It wasn't me, I swear. OK, well, maybe it was. Everyone, let's move. I was reminded of a safari I led up the Zambezi. Marvellous. Lots of hunting, yes. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Wildebeest everywhere. Two bearers loading three rifles for me, blasting away. That's when I knew I was born for Africa and Africa was created for... Clayton? Clayton... Oh, there you are. What is it? What is it, Clayton? Are we in danger? I thought I saw something. Is it a Hippopotamus amphibious or a Rhinoceros bihornus? Professor, don't move! Oh, right. Daddy? Daddy, what's all the hullabaloo about? What is it, Daddy? Mr Clayton asked me not to move. He saw something. I moved. Uh, Mr Clayton? Sorry, excuse me. But my father and I came on this expedition to study gorillas, and I believe your shooting might be scaring them off. You hired me to protect you, Miss Porter, and protect you I shall. And you're doing a marvellous job of it. But we only have a short time before the ship returns, you see... Jane! Jane, do you realize what you're standing in? A gorilla's nest! Daddy! At last! Our first sign in days. Do you think the beasts could be nearby? Could be. Why, I mean, there's the evidence. They can't be very far, anyway. Look! Over there and there... Where? Yes, more nests! I see them! Just as you predicted! Family groups! Oh, Jane, I love you. Family groups? Excuse me, but these are wild beasts that would sooner tear your head off than look at you. On the contrary, Mr Clayton. Daddy's theory is these are social creatures, not monsters. Mr Clayton, please. What if it's a gorilla? It's no gorilla. Perhaps we should press on. Yes, indeed. We should keep heading west, following the Ganoderma ablonatum. Excellent, professor. I could've used your expertise on my last safari. I was in the mountainous region of Zambia. Yes, very dangerous. Are you what all the fuss was about? Daddy! Daddy, quick! No, wait. Hold still. Oh, my good... You may not be a gorilla, but you are one sweet little... There. What do you think? Why, you little... Well, this is absolutely peachy. Come to study gorillas and get my sketchbook pinched by a baboon. Give me that! Come on now, enough of this. I want this paper on the count of three. One. Two. Look, bananas! I can't believe you fell for that one. No, no, don't give me those crocodile tears. What would your parents have to say? You see, I told you they'd be cross. Go easy on him. Children will be children. I'm flying! What on earth am I... Get off! Get off! Put me down! Put me down! No, pick me up, pick me up! Help! Unhand me, monkey! Over there! I'm in a tree with a man who talks to monkeys. I can't do this. I can't... This is good. This is very good. Wait. One, two. It can't get any worse, can it? Obviously it can. Stay back. No, don't... Don't come any closer. Please, don't. What are you... What are you doing? No, please don't. That tickles. No, get off, get off. Get off! It serves you right. Stay away from me, like a very good wild man. You stay. I'm warning you. My father won't take kindly to you... No. That's... That's close enough. How dare you? Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Yes, thank you. That's a lovely heartbeat. It's very nice. It's very nice. Oh, thank you. I can't do a thing with it in this humidity though. You do speak! All this time I thought you were a big, wild, quiet, silent person thing. Why didn't you tell me? I must say I'm rather curious as to who you are. Tarzan. Tarzan? Oh, I see. Tarzan. Oh, I see. I'm Jane. Jane. Tarzan. Jane. Exactly. Clayton! Clayton. Extraordinary. Please, can you take me to my camp? Yes, Clayton. Wonderful. Can't we walk? Can't we walk?! Let's hope we find him before Kerchak. Maybe he's lost. Or found something more interesting. Are you nuts? What could be more interesting than us? Hey, what's everybody looking at? The horror! It's gruesome. Hide me! Pull yourself together. You're embarrassing me. These things aren't alive. I knew that. Hello? What kind of primitive beasts are responsible for this mess? Come here, you guys! Come here, come here! Look at this. What is that thing? Funny. Do it again, do it again. Like this? Rip it! Ding! I love that part. Let me hear it, big fella. Now, hit it! Nice. What the heck? Byebye. Terk. Yeah, Tant. Now, hit it. Come on, Tantor. I love it. Stay with me, fellas. I feel something happening here. Gorillas! He's one of them. Oh, my... Jane, where are you? Thank goodness. Good heavens, what happened? Are you all right? We've been everywhere. Oh, my goodness. Daddy, I was out walking... Yes, yes. Little baby. Little baby monkey. I drew a picture. Go on. The monkey starts crying. Poor baby. I turned round, and there's a whole fleet of them! Of what? An army of monkeys! A tree full of them... Monkeys? ...screaming at me! Theropithecus baboonus. She's very good at this. Really? Terrified, I was. Suddenly, I was swinging in the vines, up in the air! With the monkeys? Flying. In the air. And I'm all surrounded. What did you do? And, Daddy, they took my boot! Those are the ones I bought you. And I was saved! I was saved by a flying wild man in a loincloth. Loincloth, good Lord. What is she talking about? I haven't the foggiest idea. Takes after her mother. She'd come up with stories. Not about men in loincloths... And there were gorillas! Gorillas? They were doing... You saw the gorillas? Where, Jane? He left with them. Who, dear, who? Tarzan. Tarzan? The ape man. Everyone. We will avoid the strangers. Do not let them see you, do not seek them out. They mean us no harm, Kerchak. I don't know them. I do. I've spent time with them. You may be willing to risk our safety, I'm not. Why are you threatened by anyone different from you? Protect this family, and stay away from them. Tarzan, for once, listen to Kerchak. Why didn't you tell me there were creatures that look like me? Well, he didn't stand upright. He sort of... ...crouched. Really? He supported himself on his knuckles. On the knuckles. See? Exactly like a gorilla. Extraordinary. It was amazing! He'd bend his elbows like this. And then he walks, like this. Oh, I see! Like Aunt Isabel. This is capital! JaneyJane, what a discovery! A man with no language, no human behaviour... And no respect for personal boundaries. How do you mean? He was this close, Daddy. Staring at me. He seemed confused at first, as if he's never seen another human before. And his eyes were intense and focused, and... I've never seen such eyes. Shall I leave you and the blackboard alone for a moment? Daddy, stop it. The point is, think of what we could learn from him. We must find him. Professor, you are here to find gorillas, not indulge some girlish fantasy. Fantasy? I didn't imagine him. Tarzan is... ...real. It's him! It's him, it's him. Tarzan! Professor, Jane, stand back! Wait! Clayton. Have we met? How does he know my name? He thinks it means the sound of a gunshot. Yes. Hello, Tarzan. I see what you mean about personal boundaries. What's he doing? Look at him, Jane. Moves like an ape, looks like a man. He could be the missing link. Or our link to the gorillas. Yes, yes. Where are the gorillas? Gorillas! Shouting won't help. He doesn't understand English. Then I'll make him understand. If I can teach a parrot to sing God Save the Queen, I can certainly teach this savage a thing or two. Gorilla. He's got it! Gorilla. Gorilla. Perhaps not. Gimme that. Leave it. Mr Clayton, I think I'll take it from here. Whatever you do, I'll do it too Show me everything and tell me how It all means something And yet nothing to me I can see there's so much to learn It's all so close and yet so far I see myself as people see me Oh, I just know there's something bigger out there I wanna know, can you show me I wanna know about these strangers like me Tell me more, please show me Something's familiar about these strangers like me Every gesture, every move that she makes Makes me feel like never before Why do I have this growing need to be beside her These emotions I never knew Of some other world far beyond this place Beyond the trees, above the clouds I see before me a new horizon I wanna know, can you show me I wanna know about these strangers like me Tell me more, please show me Something's familiar about these strangers like me Come with me now to see my world Where there's beauty beyond your dreams Can you feel the things I feel Right now, with you Take my hand There's a world I need to know We've wasted all this time on what he wants. The boat could arrive any day. Now, ask him straight out. Tarzan, will you take us to the gorillas? Do you understand? I understand. Good work, Jane. Well? I can't. What? Why not, Tarzan? Kerchak. Oh, Terk, I've never seen him so happy. Yeah? I give it a week. Aye, cut her loose! Come on, pull it down. All right, move it, ya bilge rats! Heave ho, lads. Put your back in it. OK, move it. Wait. Please, don't... I've waited 30 years for this and I won't leave until I see a gorilla. Isn't this dreadful, Tarzan? No! No, no, wait! Pick your barrel up. Pick it up. Here we go. Here we go. You're the captain. Say you've had engine trouble, and give us two more days. And be late at every port from here to London? We'll have come for nothing. I'm sorry, Miss Porter, but I simply can't do it. This is your fault. I should've followed my instincts and set traps for the beasts. Don't you think I'm disappointed about the gorillas? You are absolutely impossible! I was so afraid you wouldn't come in time. The boat's arrived. The boat that's come to take us home, to England. And Daddy and I were... Well, I was wondering... Well, we really hope that you'll come with us. Won't you? Go see England today. Come home tomorrow. Well, see, it would be very difficult to come back... ...ever. Not come back? I know it sounds awful, but you belong with us, with people. Jane must stay with Tarzan. Stay here? My laundry. No, I can't stay. Look, I've got... I'm with my father, and... Jane... stay. But... Please. But, I can't. Women. How typical. Thank you, Jones. Even if you hadn't grown up a savage, you'd be lost. There are no trails through a woman's heart. Jane is going. Yes. If only she could've spent more time with the gorillas. She's so disappointed. Crushed, really. Sorry, old boy. Oh, well, I best get Jane's things to the ship. Clayton. If Jane sees gorillas, she stays? Say, that's why she came, isn't it? I'll do it. Good man! Snipes? Sir? Get the boys together. There's gonna be a change in plans. Terk, just get Kerchak out of the way. What? I'd be happy to get... Hey! Shut your trunk and get me out of here. Can you believe that guy? Drops us like a newborn giraffe, kerplop! Now waltzes in here and expects us to just... Terk, I'm asking you as a friend. With the face and the eyes and the... All right! But don't make me do anything embarrassing. I'm gonna kill him!! I thought that dress was rather slimming on you. Really? I thought it was a little revealing and kind of... How does she move in this thing? Look out! Look, Daddy! Where? Now, be careful, professor. Mustn't, mustn't frighten. She's beautiful. She's my mother. This is your... ...mother? What's happening? I don't know, Daddy. It's getting away! No! You'll only frighten her more. Yes, absolutely, my dear. Good idea. What are you doing? Want to frighten them? Get up. Get... Don't get up. Hello. It's very nice to meet you, too. Oh, Your Majesty, you're such a tease. Whoa! Hello. Hello. Archimedes Q. Porter at your service. Quite a grip you've got. Thank you, yes. Is that one of mine? This is wonderful, Mr Clayton! Look, look! Social grooming. Congratulations, professor. Our dream has come true. Give me that! What are you doing? Now, stop that! Stop! Hold on now. Leave that! That is not to be played with! Can you teach me? Speak gorilla? Yes. Good heavens, what did I say? That Jane stays with Tarzan. Stay? But I, I thought we'd already... Tarzan, I... Is that my dress? Oh, no. Daddy. Give it to me! Go! Wait, wait! Tarzan! Go now! Jane, quickly! Hurry! Come along! Kerchak, I didn't... I'm sorry, I... I asked you to protect our family. And you betrayed us all. I'm so confused. Come with me. There's something I should've shown you long ago. Is this me? And this is my father, and... and my... Now you know. Tarzan, I just want you to be happy, whatever you decide. No matter where I go, you will always be my mother. And you will always be in my heart. Goodbye, Tarzan. I'm so glad you found us in time. We're too late! I can't believe it! If you had pulled over and asked for directions... We didn't get to say goodbye. Well, good riddance, all right? Who needs you, huh? Go on, get out of here, bald boy! You, you ingrate! You bald ingrate! Go on and rot, for all I care! Go! What are you looking at? I'm gonna miss him, too. Tarzan, you can't imagine what's in store for you. You'll see the world. Everyone will want to meet you. Kings, scientists, famous writers. Yes. Darwin and Kipling. Queen Victoria! I haven't met her, but I heard she's nice. And I'll be with Jane? Yes, with Jane. Slippery. Get him! What's going on here? Clayton! Clayton, help! Have we met? Yes, the ape man. So sorry about the rude welcome, old boy, but I couldn't have you making a scene when we put your furry friends in their cages. Why? For three hundred pounds sterling a head. Actually, I have you to thank, my boy. Couldn't have done it without you. Lock him up with the others. That sounded like Tarzan. He sounded like he was in trouble. Well, why doesn't he get his new friends to help him? I don't care. That's it! I've had it with you and your emotional constipation! Tarzan needs us and we're gonna help him! You got that? Now, pipe down and hang on tight! We've got a boat to catch. I've never felt so alive! Good! Cos I'm gonna kill you! No time for that now, missy. Tarzan, it's no use. Don't! Clayton. Yes, Clayton. Clayton betrayed us all. I'm so sorry, Tarzan. No, I did this. I betrayed my family. Kerchak was right. Those magnificent creatures, shivering in cages. What is this world coming to? Oh, by Jove! Don't know my own strength. What was that? You are an animal! That sounded just like an elephant. Tantor! Thanks, guys. I thought I would never see you again! And here you are. Sometimes you embarrass me. I remember you. I think this one will be better off stuffed. You came back. I came home. Fire! You! Take what you can back to the boat. Aye, aye, sir. I've got some hunting to do. Don't worry. I'm going to have you out of this in a second. This should do the trick. Hiding, are we? Good! Clayton, you... I could use a challenge. Because after I get rid of you, rounding up your little ape family will be all too easy! Go ahead, shoot me. Be a man. Not a man like you! Clayton, don't! Kerchak, forgive me. No, forgive me for not understanding that you have always been one of us. Our family will look to you now. No, Kerchak. Take care of them... ...my son. Take care of them. London will seem so small compared to all this. I will miss you, Jane. Miss Porter! I know. I'm coming. Well... I suppose we should say goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Tarzan! Goodbye. I'm going to miss that boy. Jane, dear, I can't help feeling that you should stay. Please don't. We've been through this. I couldn't possibly... I belong in England with you, with people... But you love him. Go on. Thank you. Thanks for getting my glove. Thank you. What am I doing? Captain, tell them that you never found us, eh? After all, people get lost in the jungle every day. Tootlepip. Put your faith in what you most believe in Two worlds, one family Trust your heart, let fate decide To guide these lives To guide these lives we see Two worlds, one family"
The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Disney,1990,1996,Animation,"Morning in Paris The city awakes To the bells of Notre Dame The fisherman fishes The baker man bakes To the bells of Notre Dame To the big bells as loud as the thunder To the little bells soft as a psalm And some say the soul of the city's the toll Of the bells The bells of Notre Dame Listen. They're beautiful, no? So many colours of sound, so many changing moods. Because you know they don't ring all by themselves. They don't? No, you silly boy. Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower, lives the mysterious bell ringer. Who is this creature? Who? What is he? What? How did he come to be there? How? Hush. Clopin will tell you. lt is a tale, a tale of a man... And a monster. Dark was the night when our tale was begun On the docks near Notre Dame Shut it up, will you? We'll be spotted! Hush, little one. Four frightened gypsies slid silently under The docks near Notre Dame Four guilders for safe passage into Paris. A trap had been laid for the gypsies And they gazed up in fear and alarm At a figure whose clutches Were iron as much as the bells Judge Claude Frollo! The bells of Notre Dame Kyrie eleison Judge Claude Frollo longed to purge the world of vice and sin Kyrie eleison And he saw corruption Everywhere except within Bring these gypsy vermin to the palace ofjustice. You there! What are you hiding? Stolen goods, no doubt. Take them from her. She ran. Dies irae Dies irae Dies illa Dies illa Solvet saeclum in favilla Quantus tremor est futurus Quando judex est venturus Sanctuary! Please, give us sanctuary! Quantus tremor est futurus Dies irae A baby? A monster! Solvet saeclum in favilla Dies irae Dies irae ""Stop!"" cried the archdeacon. This is an unholy demon. l'm sending it back to hell, where it belongs. See, there, the innocent blood you have spilt On the steps of Notre Dame l am guiltless. She ran. l pursued. Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt On the steps of Notre Dame My conscience is clear. You can lie to yourself and your minions You can claim that you haven't a qualm But you never can run from Nor hide what you've done from the eyes The very eyes Of Notre Dame Kyrie eleison And for one time in his life Of power and control Kyrie eleison Frollo felt a twinge of fear for his immortal soul What must l do? Care for the child and raise it as your own. What? l am to be saddled with this misshapen... Very well. But let him live with you in your church. Live here? Where? Anywhere. Just so he's kept locked away where no one else can see The bell tower, perhaps. And who knows? Our Lord works in mysterious ways. Even this foul creature may yet prove one day to be Of use to me And Frollo gave the child a cruel name, a name that means ""halfformed."" Quasimodo. Now here is a riddle to guess if you can Sing the bells of Notre Dame Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells Bells, bells Bells, bells Bells, bells Bells of Notre Dame Good morning.

Hey, Quasi, what's goin' on out there? A fight? A flogging? A festival. You mean a Feast of Fools? All right, all right! Pour the wine and cut the cheese. It is a treat to watch the colourful pageantry of the simple peasant folk. Boy, nothin' like balcony seats for watching the ol' FOF. Yeah, watchin'. Look. A mime. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What gives? Aren't you going to watch the festival with us? I don't get it. Perhaps he's sick. Impossible. If 20 years of listenin' to you two hasn't made him sick by now, nothin' will. Watching the Festival of Fools has always been the highlight of the year for Quasimodo. What good is watchin' the party if you never get to go? Here, get away from me! Go on, ya bunch of buzzards! He's not made of stone, like us. Quasi, what's wrong? You want to tell ol' Laverne all about it? I just don't feel like watching the festival, that's all. Well, did ya ever think of goin' there instead? Sure. But I'd never fit in out there. I'm not normal. Quasi, Quasi, Quasi. Do ya mind? I would like to have a moment with the boy, if it's all right with you! Hey, quit beatin' around the bell tower. What do we gotta do, paint ya a fresco? As your friends and guardians, we insist you attend the festival. Me? No, the pope. Of course, you! It would be a veritable potpourri of educational experience. Wine, women and song. You can learn to identify various regional cheeses. Bobbin' for snails. Study indigenous folk music. Playin' dunk the monk! Quasi, take it from an old spectator. Life's not a spectator sport. Ifwatchin' is all you're gonna do, then you're gonna watch your life go by without ya. Yeah, you're human, with the flesh and the hair and the navel lint. We're just part of the architecture. Right, Victor? Yet, if you kick us, will we not flake? If you moisten us, do we not grow moss? Quasi, just grab a fresh tunic and a clean pair of hose, and... Thanks for the encouragement. But you're all forgetting one big thing. What? My master, Frollo. Yeah. Oh, dear, yes. Well, when he says you're forbidden from ever leaving the bell tower, does he mean ""ever,"" ever? Never ever. And he hates the Feast of Fools. He'd be furious if I asked to go. Who says ya gotta ask? Oh, no. Ya sneak out. It's just one afternoon. I couldn't. And ya sneak back in. He'll never know you were gone. And if I got caught? Better to beg forgiveness than ask permission. He might see me. You could wear a disguise. Just this once. What Frollo doesn't know can't hurt ya. Ignorance is bliss. Look who's talkin'. Nobody wants to stay cooped up here forever. You're right. I'll go. I'll get cleaned up. Yes, sir! I'll stroll down those stairs. There ya go! I'll march through the doors and... Good morning, Quasimodo. Good morning, Master. Dear boy, whomever are you talking to? My friends. I see. And what are your friends made of, Quasimodo? Stone. Can stone talk? No, it can't. That's right. You're a smart lad. Now, lunch. Shall we review your alphabet today? Yes, Master. I would like that very much. Very well. ""A""? Abomination. ""B""? Blasphemy. ""C""? Contrition. ""D""? Damnation. ""E""? Eternal damnation. Good. ""F""? Festival. Excuse me? Forgiveness. You said, ""Festival."" No! You are thinking about going to the festival. It's just that you go every year. I am a public official. I must go. But I don't enjoy a moment. Thieves and cutpurses, the dregs of humankind, all mixed together in a shallow, drunken stupor. I didn't mean to upset you, Master. Quasimodo, can't you understand? When your heartless mother abandoned you as a child, anyone else would have drowned you. And this is my thanks for taking you in and raising you as my son? I'm sorry, sir. My dear Quasimodo. You don't know what it's like out there. I do. I do. The world is cruel The world is wicked lt's l alone whom you can trust in this whole city l am your only friend l, who keep you, teach you feed you, dress you l, who look upon you without fear How can l protect you, boy Unless you always stay in here Away in here Remember what I've taught you, Quasimodo. You are deformed l am deformed And you are ugly And l am ugly And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity You do not comprehend You are my one defender Out there they'll revile you as a monster l am a monster Out there they will hate and scorn and jeer Only a monster Why invite their calumny and consternation Stay in here Be faithful to me l'm faithful Grateful to me l'm grateful Do as l say Obey And stay in here l'll stay in here You are good to me, Master. I'm sorry. You are forgiven. But, remember, Quasimodo, this is your sanctuary. My sanctuary. Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone Gazing at the people down below me All my life, l watch them as l hide up here alone Hungry for the histories they show me All my life l memorize their faces Knowing them as they will never know me All my life, l wonder how it feels to pass a day Not above them But part of them And out there Living in the sun Give me one day out there All l ask is one To hold forever Out there Where they all live unaware What l'd give What l'd dare Just to live One day Out there Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives Through the roofs and gables l can see them Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives Heedless of the gift it is to be them lf l was in their skin l'd treasure Every instant Out there Strolling by the Seine Taste the morning out there Like ordinary men Who freely walk about there Just one day and then l swear l'll be content With my share Won't resent Won't despair Old and bent l won't care l'll have spent One day Out there You leave town for a couple of decades, and they change everything. Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking for the palace ofjustice. Would you... I guess not. Stay away, child. They're gypsies. They'll steal us blind. All right, gypsy. Where'd ya get the money? For your information, I earned it. Gypsies don't earn money. They steal it. You'd know a lot about stealing. Troublemaker, eh? Maybe a day in the stocks will cool ya down. Come back here, gypsy! Achilles, sit. Oh, dear, I'm sorry. Naughty horse! Naughty! He's just impossible. Really, I can't take him anywhere. Get this thing off me! I'll teach you a lesson, peasant! You were saying, Lieutenant? Captain! At your service, sir! I know you have a lot on your mind right now, but the palace ofjustice? Make way for the captain! Go on, make way! Make way! Everybody out of the way! You, make way for the captain! Make way! Make way, now! Come on, boy. Achilles, heel! Stop. Sir? Ease up. Wait between lashes. Otherwise the old sting will dull him to the new. Yes, sir. So this is the gallant Captain Phoebus, home from the wars. Reporting for duty, as ordered, sir. Your service record precedes you, Phoebus. I expect nothing but the best from a war hero of your calibre. And you shall have it, sir. I guarantee it. Yes. You know, my last captain of the guard was a bit of a disappointment to me. Well, no matter. I'm sure you'll whip my men into shape. Thank you. It's a tremendous honour, sir. You've come to Paris in her darkest hour, Captain. It will take a firm hand to save the weakminded from being so easily misled. Misled, sir? Look, Captain. Gypsies. The gypsies live outside the normal order. Their heathen ways inflame the people's lowest instincts. And they must be stopped. I was summoned from the wars to capture fortune tellers and palm readers? The real war, Captain, is what you see before you. For 20 years, I have been taking care of the gypsies, one by one. And yet, for all my success, they have thrived. I believe they have a safe haven within the walls of this very city. A nest, if you will. They call it the court of miracles. What are we going to do about it, sir? You make your point quite vividly, sir. You know, I like you, Captain. Shall we? Duty calls. Have you ever attended a peasant festival, Captain? Not recently, sir. Then this should be quite an education for you. Come along. Come, one Come, all Leave your looms and milking stools Coop the hens and pen the mules Come, one Come, all Close the churches and the schools lt's the day for breaking rules Come and join the Feast Of Fools Once a year we throw a party here in town Once a year we turn all Paris upsidedown Every man's a king and every king's a clown Once again it's topsyturvy day lt's the day the devil in us gets released lt's the day we mock the prig and shock the priest Everything is topsyturvy at the Feast of Fools Topsyturvy Everything is upsydaisy Topsyturvy Everyone is acting crazy Dross is gold and weeds are a bouquet That's the way on topsyturvy day Hey!

By the way, great mask.

He's hideous! It's the bell ringer from Notre Dame! Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic. We asked for the ugliest face in Paris, and here it is! Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame! Everybody! Once a year we throw a party Here in town Hail to the king Once a year we turn all Paris upsidedown What a king Once a year the ugliest will wear a crown Girls, give a kiss. We never had a king like this And it's the day we do the things that we deplore On the other three hundred and sixtyfour Once a year we love to drop in where the beer is never stopping For the chance to pop some popinjay And pick a king who put the ""top"" ln topsyturvy Topsyturvy Madandcrazy upsydaisy Topsyturvy day Quasimodo! Quasimodo! You think he's ugly now? Watch this. Quasimodo! Now that's ugly! Hail to the king! Bon appÃ©tit! Where are you goin', hunchback? The fun's just beginning. Master! Master, please, help me! Sir, request permission to stop this cruelty. In a moment, Captain. A lesson needs to be learned here. Don't be afraid. I'm sorry. This wasn't supposed to happen. You! Gypsy girl! Get down at once! Yes, your honour. Just as soon as I free this poor creature. I forbid it! How dare you defy me? You mistreat this poor boy the same way you mistreat my people. You speak ofjustice, yet you are cruel to those most in need of your help. Silence! Justice! Mark my words, gypsy. You will pay for this insolence. Then it appears we've crowned the wrong fool. The only fool I see is you! Captain Phoebus, arrest her. Now, let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So there's ten of you and one of me. What's a poor girl to do? Witchcraft! Oh, boys. Over here. There she is! Get her! I'm free! I'm free! Dang it. What a woman. Find her, Captain. I want her alive. Yes, sir. Seal off the area, men. Find the gypsy girl and do not harm her. I'm sorry, Master. I will never disobey you again. Stand back. Stand back. Oh, he's hideous. You, there, get away! Move on. You! Easy, easy. I just shaved this morning. Oh, really? You missed a spot. All right, all right. Just calm down. Just give me a chance to apologize. For what? That, for example. You sneaky son of a... Watch it. You're in a church. Are you always this charming, or am I just lucky? Candlelight, privacy, music. Can't think of a better place for handtohand combat. You fight almost as well as a man. Funny, I was going to say the same thing about you. That's hitting a little below the belt, don't you think? No. This is. TouchÃ©. I didn't know you had a kid. Well, he doesn't take kindly to soldiers. I noticed. Permit me. I'm Phoebus. It means ""sun god."" And you are? Is this an interrogation? I believe it's called an introduction. You're not arresting me? Not as long as you're in here. I can't. You're not at all like the other soldiers. Thank you. So, if you're not going to arrest me, what do you want? I'd settle for your name. Esmeralda. Beautiful. Much better than Phoebus, anyway. Good work, Captain. Now arrest her. Claim ""sanctuary."" Say it! You tricked me. I'm waiting, Captain. I'm sorry, sir. She claimed sanctuary. There's nothing I can do. Then drag her outside and... Frollo, you will not touch her! Don't worry. Minister Frollo learned years ago to respect the sanctity of the church. All right, all right. I'm going. You think you've outwitted me. But I'm a patient man. And gypsies don't do well inside stone walls. What are you doing? I was just imagining a rope around that beautiful neck. I know what you were imagining. Such a clever witch. So typical of your kind to twist the truth. To cloud the mind with unholy thoughts. Well, no matter. You've chosen a magnificent prison. But it is a prison, nonetheless. Set one foot outside, and you're mine. Frollo's orders. Post a guard at every door. Don't worry, Djali. If Frollo thinks he can keep us here, he's wrong. Don't act rashly, my child. You created quite a stir at the festival. It would be unwise to arouse Frollo's anger further. You saw what he did out there, letting the crowd torture that poor boy. I thought ifjust one person could stand up to him, then... What do they have against people who are different, anyway? You can't right all the wrongs of this world by yourself. No one out there is going to help, that's for sure. Well, perhaps there's someone in here who can. l don't know if You can hear me Or if You're even there l don't know if You would listen To a gypsy's prayer Yes, l know l'm just an outcast l shouldn't speak to You Still, l see your face and wonder Were You once an outcast, too? God help the outcasts Hungry from birth Show them the mercy They don't find on earth God help my people We look to You still God help the outcasts Or nobody will l ask for wealth l ask for fame l ask for glory To shine on my name l ask for love l can possess l ask for God and His angels To bless me l ask for nothing l can get by But l know so many Less lucky than l Please help my people The poor and downtrod l thought we all were The children of God God help the outcasts Children of God You! Bell ringer! What are you doing down here? Haven't you caused enough trouble already? Wait. I want to talk to you. Look, he's got a friend with him. Yeah. Maybe today wasn't a total loss after all. A vision of loveliness. The one in the dress ain't bad either. Way to go, Quasi! Congratulations. We knew you had it in ya. Got the girls chasin' ya already. Actually, I... You mustn't run too fast, or she'll get away. Yes, I know. That's what I... Give her some slack, then reel her in. Then give her some slack, then reel her in. Then give her some slack... Knock it off, Hugo. She's a girl, not a mackerel. Here you are. I was afraid I'd lost you. Yes. Well, I... I have chores to do. It was nice seeing you again. No, wait! I'm really sorry about this afternoon. I had no idea who you were. I would never in my life have pulled you... Up on the... Stage. What is this place? This is where I live. Did you make all these things yourself? Most of them. This is beautiful. If I could do this, you wouldn't find me dancing in the streets for coins. But you're a wonderful dancer. It keeps bread on the table, anyway. What's this? No, please! I'm not finished. I still have to paint them. It's the blacksmith and the baker! You're a surprising person, Quasimodo. Not to mention lucky. All this room to yourself. Well, it's notjust me. There's the gargoyles and, of course, the bells. Would you like to see them? Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali? Follow me. I'll introduce you. I never knew there were so many. That's Little Sophia. And JeaneMarie, AnneMarie, LouiseMarie. Triplets, you know. And who's this? Big Marie. Hello! She likes you. Would you like to see more? How about it, Djali? We'd love to. Good. I've saved the best for last. I bet the king himself doesn't have a view like this. I could stay up here forever. You could, you know. No, I couldn't. Oh, yes, you have sanctuary. But not freedom. ""Gypsies don't do well inside stone walls."" But you're not like other gypsies. They are evil. Who told you that? My master, Frollo. He raised me. How can such a cruel man have raised someone like you? Cruel? Oh, no. He saved my life. He took me in when no one else would. I am a monster, you know. He told you that? Look at me. Give me your hand. Just let me see it. What? A long lifeline. And this one means you're shy. Well, that's funny. What? I don't see any... Any what? Monster lines. Not a single one. Now you look at me. Do you think I'm evil? No! No, no. You are kind and good and... And a gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong about the both of us. What did she say? Frollo's nose is long, and he wears a truss. Told ya! Pay up. Oh, dear. Chump. You helped me. Now I will help you. But there's no way out. There are soldiers at every door. We won't use a door. You mean, climb down? Sure. You carry him. I carry you. Okay. Come on, Djali. Ready? Yes. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Now I'm afraid. The trick is not to look down. You've done this before? No. Wow, you're quite an acrobat. Thank you. Check the alley! This way! I hope I didn't scare you. Not for an instant. I'll never forget you, Esmeralda. Come with me. What? To the court of miracles. Leave this place. Oh, no. I'm never going back out there again. You saw what happened today. No. This is where I belong. All right, then I'll come to see you. Here? But the soldiers and Frollo! I'll come after sunset. But at sunset, I ring the evening mass, and after that I clean the cloisters. And then I ring the vespers, and... Whatever is good for you. If you ever need sanctuary, this will show you the way. But how? Just remember. When you wear this woven band, you hold the city in your hand. Hurry. You must go. Check the alley. Yes, sir. No one here, sir. No one here, sir. Check the street. Hi, there. I'm looking for the gypsy girl. Have you seen her? Whoa, whoa! Easy! No soldiers! Sanctuary! Get out! Wait! All I want is to... Go! I mean her no harm. Go! You tell her for me, I didn't mean to trap her here. But it was the only way I could save her life. Will you tell her that? Will you? If you go. Now. I'll go. Now, will you put me down, please? And one more thing. Tell Esmeralda she's very lucky. Why? To have a friend like you. Hey, there he is. You ejected that tinplated buffoon with great panache. The nerve of him, snoopin' around here, tryin' to steal your girl. My girl? Esmeralda. Dark hair, works with a goat, remember? Boy, I do. Way to go, lover boy. ""Lover boy""? Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't be so modest. Look, I appreciate what you're all trying to do. But let's not fool ourselves. ""Ugliest face in all Paris,"" remember? I don't think I'm her type. So many times out there l've watched a happy pair Of lovers walking in the night They had a kind of glow around them lt almost looked like heaven's light l knew l'd never know That warm and loving glow Though l might wish with all my might No face as hideous as my face Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright l dare to dream that she Might even care for me And as l ring these bells tonight My cold dark tower seems so bright l swear it must be heaven's light Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti Beatae Mariae Semper Virgini Beato Michaeli archangelo Sanctis apostolis Omnibus Sanctis Beata Maria You know l am a righteous man Of my virtue l am justly proud Et tibit Pater Beata Maria You know l'm so much purer than The common, vulgar, weak licentious crowd Quia peccavi nimis Then tell me, Maria Why l see her dancing there Why her smouldering eyes still scorch my soul Cogitatione l feel her, l see her The sun caught in her raven hair ls blazing in me out of all control Verbo et opere Like fire Hellfire This fire in my skin This burning desire ls turning me to sin lt's not my fault Mea culpa l'm not to blame Mea culpa lt is the gypsy girl The witch who sent this flame Mea maxima culpa lt's not my fault if in God's plan Mea culpa Mea Culpa He made the devil so much stronger than a man Protect me, Maria Don't let this siren cast her spell Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone Destroy Esmeralda And let her taste the fires of hell Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped. What? She's nowhere in the cathedral. She's gone. But how? Never mind. Get out, you idiot. I'll find her. I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris. Hellfire Dark fire Now, gypsy lt's your turn Choose me or your pyre Be mine or you will burn Kyrie eleison God have mercy on her Kyrie eleison God have mercy on me Kyrie eleison But she will be mine Or she Will Burn 'Tention! Good morning, sir. Are you feeling all right? I had a little trouble with the fireplace. I see. Your orders, sir? Find the gypsy girl. Ten pieces of silver for the gypsy, Esmeralda. Lock them up. Twenty pieces of silver for the gypsy, Esmeralda. Take them away! Poor miller. He's never harmed anyone! Frollo's gone mad. We found this gypsy talisman on your property. Have you been harbouring gypsies? Our home is always open to the weary traveller. Have mercy, my lord. I am placing you and your family under house arrest until I get to the bottom of this. Ifwhat you say is true and you are innocent, then you have nothing to fear. But we are innocent. I assure you, we know nothing of these gypsies. Burn it. What? Until it smoulders. These people are traitors and must be made examples of. With all due respect, sir, I was not trained to murder the innocent. But you were trained to follow orders. Insolent coward. The sentence for insubordination is death. Such a pity. You threw away a promising career. Consider it my highest honour, sir. Get him! And don't hit my horse! Don't waste your arrows. Let the traitor rot in his watery grave. Find the girl. If you have to burn the city to the ground, so be it. Kyrie eleison Sir, we've looked everywhere and still no sign of the gypsy girl. I had the entire cathedral surrounded. Guards at every door. There was no way she could have escaped. Unless... It doesn't look good. It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless. You're tellin' me. I'm losin' to a bird! But that poor gypsy girl. I'm beginning to fear the worst. I know. But now don't you say anything to upset Quasimodo. He's worried enough already. Yeah, you're right. We better lighten up. Here he comes. Nowjust stay calm. Not a word. Easy does it. Stonefaced. Any sign of her? It's a lost cause! She could be anywhere! In the stocks, in the dungeon, on the rack! Nice work, Victor. No, he's right. What are we gonna do? What are you guys talkin' about? If I know Esmeralda, she's three steps ahead of Frollo and well out of harm's way. Do you really think so? Hey, when things cool off, she'll be back. You'll see. What makes you so sure? Because she likes ya. We always said you were the cute one. I thought I was the cute one. No, you're the fat, stupid one with the big mouth! What are you sayin', exactly? Take it from us, Quasi. You got nothin' to worry about. Yeah. You're irresistible. Knights in shining armour certainly aren't her type. And those guys are a dime a dozen. But you, you're one of a kind. Look. Paris, the city of lovers is glowing this evening True, that's because it's on fire But still there's l'amour Somewhere out there in the night Her heart is also alight And l know the guy she just might be burning for A guy like you She's never known, kid A guy like you A girl does not meet every day You've got a look That's all your own, kid Could there be two? Like you? No way Those other guys That she could dangle All look the same from every boring point of view You're a surprise From every angle Mon Dieu above She's gotta love a guy like you A guy like you Gets extra credit Because it's true you've got a certain something more You're aces, kid. You see that face Ya don't forget it Want something new That's you. For sure We all have gaped at some Adonis But then we crave a meal more nourishing to chew And since you're shaped Like a croissant is No question of she's gotta love a guy like you Call me a hopeless romantic But Quasi l feel it She wants you so Any moment she'll walk through that door For A guy so swell A guy like you with all you bring her A fool could tell it's why she fell For youknowwho You'll ring the bell You're the bell ringer When she wants oohlala And she wants youlala She will discover, guy You're one heck of a guy Who wouldn't love a guy Like You You got a lot The rest have not She's gotta love a guy like you Quasi? Quasimodo? Esmeralda? Esmeralda, you're all right! I knew you'd come back! You've done so much for me already, my friend. But I must ask your help one more time. Yes, anything. This is Phoebus. He's wounded and a fugitive like me. He can't go on much longer. I knew he'd be safe here. Please, can you hide him? This way. Esmeralda. You'll hide here until you're strong enough to move. Great. I could use a drink. Yes. Feels like a 1470 burgundy. Not a good year. That family owes you their lives. You're either the single bravest soldier I've ever seen or the craziest. Exsoldier, remember? Why is it, whenever we meet, I end up bleeding? You're lucky. That arrow almost pierced your heart. I'm not so sure it didn't. l knew l'd never know that warm and loving glow Though l might wish with all my might No face as hideous as my face Was ever meant for heaven's light Frollo's coming. You must leave. Quick, follow me. Go down the south tower steps. Be careful, my friend. Promise you won't let anything happen to him. I promise. Thank you. Quick, we gotta stash the stiff. Master, I didn't think you'd be coming. I am never too busy to share a meal with you, dear boy. I brought a little treat. Is there something troubling you, Quasimodo? No! But there is. I know there is. I think you're hiding something. No, Master. I... There's no... You're not eating, boy. It's very good. Thank you. Seeds. What's different in here? Nothing. Sir. Isn't this one new? It's awfully good. It looks very much like the gypsy girl. I know you helped her escape! And now all Paris is burning because of you! She was kind to me, Master. You idiot! That wasn't kindness. It was cunning! She's a gypsy! Gypsies are not capable of real love! Think, boy. Think of your mother. But what chance could a poor, misshapen child like you have against her heathen treachery? Well, never you mind, Quasimodo. She'll be out of our lives soon enough. I will free you from her evil spell. She will torment you no longer. What do you mean? I know where her hideout is. And tomorrow at dawn, I attack with 1 ,000 men. We have to find the court of miracles before daybreak. If Frollo gets there first... Are you coming with me? I can't. I thought you were Esmeralda's friend. Frollo is my master. I can't disobey him again. She stood up for you. You've got a funny way of showing gratitude. Well, I'm not going to sit by and watch Frollo massacre innocent people. You do what you think is right. What? What am I supposed to do? Go out there and rescue the girl from the jaws of death, and the whole town will cheer like I'm some kind of a hero? She already has her knight in shining armour, and it's not me. Frollo was right. Frollo was right about everything. I'm tired of trying to be something that I'm not. I must be out of my mind. Phoebus! I'm coming with you! Glad you changed your mind. I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for her. You know where she is? No, but she said that this will help us find her. Good, good, good. Great. What is it? I'm not sure. It must be some sort of code. Maybe it's Arabic. No, no. It's not Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek. ""When you wear this woven band, you hold the city in your hand."" What? It's the city. What are you talking about? It's a map. See, here's the cathedral and the river, and this little stone must be... I've never seen a map that looks like... I've lived in the tower for 20 years. And I think I know what the city looks like from above. This is it. This is not it. All right. Okay. If you say it's a map, fine. It's a map. But ifwe're going to find Esmeralda, we have to work together. Truce? Well, okay. Sorry. No, you're not. This looks like the symbol on the map. But what does it mean? I'm not sure. I can make out an inscription, but it's going to take a few minutes to translate it. Yes, well. Or we could just go down those stairs. Is this the court of miracles? Offhand, I'd say it's the court of ankledeep sewage. Must be the old catacombs. Cheerful place. Kinda makes ya wish ya got out more often, eh, Quasi? Not me. I just want to warn Esmeralda and get back to the bell tower before I get in more trouble. Speaking of trouble, we should have run into some by now. What do you mean? You know. A guard. A booby trap. Or an ambush. Well, well, well. What have we here? Trespassers! Spies! We're not spies. You've got to listen... Don't interrupt me. You're very clever to have found our hideaway. Unfortunately, you won't live to tell the tale. Maybe you've heard of a terrible place Where the scoundrels of Paris collect in a lair Maybe you've heard of that mythical place called the court of miracles Hello, you're there. Where the lame can walk And the blind can see But the dead don't talk So you won't be around to reveal what you found We have a method for spies and intruders Rather like hornets protecting their hive Here in the court of miracles where it's a miracle if you get out alive Gather around, everybody. There's ""good noose"" tonight. It's a doubleheader. A couple of Frollo's spies. And notjust any spies. His captain of the guard and his loyal, bellringing henchman. Justice is swift in the court of miracles l am the lawyers and judge all in one We like to get the trial over with quickly Because it's the sentence that's really the fun Any last words? That's what they all say. Now that we've seen all the evidence Wait, l object Overruled. I object. Quiet. Dang. We find you totally innocent Which is the worst crime of all So you're going to hang Stop! These men aren't spies. They're our friends. Why didn't they say so? We did say so. This is the soldier who saved the miller's family. And Quasimodo helped me escape the cathedral. We came to warn you. Frollo's coming! He says he knows where you're hiding, and he's attacking at dawn with 1 ,000 men. Then let's waste no time. We must leave immediately. You took a terrible risk coming here. It may not exactly show, but we're grateful. Don't thank me. Thank Quasimodo. Without his help, I would never have found my way here. Nor would I. After 20 years of searching, the court of miracles is mine at last. Dear Quasimodo. I always knew you would someday be of use to me. No. What are you talking about? Why, he led me right to you, my dear. You're a liar. And look what else I've caught in my net. Captain Phoebus, back from the dead. Another ""miracle,"" no doubt. I shall remedy that. There'll be a little bonfire in the square tomorrow. And you're all invited to attend. Lock them up. No, please, Master! No, no. Take him back to the bell tower. And make sure he stays there. The prisoner, Esmeralda, has been found guilty of the crime ofwitchcraft. The sentence... Death! The time has come, gypsy. You stand upon the brink of the abyss. Yet even now it is not too late. I can save you from the flames of this world and the next. Choose me. Or the fire. The gypsy, Esmeralda, has refused to recant. This evil witch has put the soul of every citizen in Paris in awful jeopardy. Come on, Quasi. Snap out of it! Your friends are down there. It's all my fault. You gotta break these chains. I can't. I tried. What difference would it make? But you can't let Frollo win! He already has. So you're givin' up? That's it? These chains aren't what's holding you back, Quasimodo. Leave me alone. Okay. Okay, Quasi. We'll leave ya alone. After all, we're only made out of stone. We just thought maybe you were made of somethin' stronger. Forjustice, for Paris, and for her own salvation, it is my sacred duty to send this unholy demon back where she belongs. No! Quasimodo! Sanctuary! Captain. Sir? Seize the cathedral. Don't worry. You'll be safe here. Charge! Come back, you cowards! You, men, pick up that beam. Break down the door. Alone at last. Citizens of Paris! Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city! Now he has declared war on Notre Dame herself! Will we allow it? I think the cavalry is here. Hey, isn't that... Feeble? Doofus. Phoebus! Sorry. Sorry. Harder! I'm free! I'm free! Dang it! Ready, aim, fire! Are you sure that's how it works? Works for me. Achilles, sit. Get off me! Fly, my pretties! Fly, fly! Put your backs into it! Frollo, have you gone mad? I will not tolerate this assault on the house of God! Silence, you old fool! The hunchback and I have unfinished business to attend to. And this time you will not interfere. We've done it, Esmeralda! We've beaten them back! Come and see. Esmeralda, wake up. You're safe now. Esmeralda? No. You killed her. It was my duty, horrible as it was. I hope you will forgive me. There, there, Quasimodo. I know it hurts. But now the time has come to end your suffering... Forever. Now, now, listen to me, Quasimodo. No, you listen! All my life, you have told me the world is a dark, cruel place. But now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you. Quasimodo? Esmeralda! She lives. No! Leaving so soon? Look, up there! Hang on! I should have known you'd risk your life to save that gypsy witch, just as your own mother died trying to save you. What? Now I'm going to do what I should have done 20 years ago! Hold on. And he shall smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit! Quasimodo! Quasi! No! Three cheers for Quasimodo! So here is a riddle to guess if you can Sing the bells of Notre Dame What makes a monster and what makes a man Sing the bells, bells Bells, bells Whatever their pitch You can feel them bewitch you The rich and the ritual knells Of the bells Of Notre Dame Don't you ever migrate? Good night, everybody! "

You see, l... Well, I shall never be king. And you shall never see the light of another day. Adieu. Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food? What do you want? I'm here to announce that King Mufasa's on his way, so you'd better have a good excuse for missing this morning's ceremony. Oh, look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch. You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you. He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia. I quiver with fear! Now, Scar, don't look at me that way. Help! Scar? Mmhmm? Drop him. Impeccable timing, Your Majesty. Why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners. Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba. That was today? I feel simply awful!  Must've slipped my mind. Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should've been first in line! Well, I was first in line, until the little hairball was born. That hairball is my son and your future king. I shall practice my curtsy! Don't turn your back on me, Scar. Oh, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.  Is that a challenge? Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you. Pity. Why not? Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share. But when it comes to brute strength, I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool. There's one in every family, sire. Two in mine, actually, and they always manage to ruin special occasions. What am I going to do with him? He'd make a very handsome throw rug. Zazu! And just think, whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him.   Hmm. Simba.  Dad! Dad! Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up! Uhh! Sorry.  Dad! Dad! Your son is awake. Before sunrise, he's your son. Dad! Come on, Dad. You promised. Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up. Yeah! Look, Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom. Wow. A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king. And this'll all be mine? Everything. Everything the light touches. What about that shadowy place? That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba. But I thought a king can do whatever he wants. Oh, there's more to being king than getting your way all the time. There's more? Simba... Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope? Yes, Simba, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great circle of life. Good morning, sire! Good morning, Zazu. Checking in with the morning report. Fire away. Well! The buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot. Really? What are you doing, son? Pouncing. Let an old pro show you how it's done. I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't... Zazu, would you turn around? Yes, sire. The cheetahs are hard up, but... Stay low to the ground. Cheetahs never prosper... Yeah, okay. Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah. What going on? A pouncing lesson. Very good. Pouncing. Pouncing? No, sire, you can't be serious... This is so humiliating. Try not to make a sound. What are you telling him, Mufasa? Mufasa? Simba?  That's very good. Zazu! Yes! News from the underground. Now, this time... Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands! Zazu, take Simba home. Aw, dad, can't I come? No, son. Pah! I never get to go anywhere. Oh, young master, one day, you will be king. Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers from dawn until dusk. Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what? I despise guessing games. I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock. Oh, goody! My dad just showed me the whole kingdom, and I'm gonna rule it all! Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know. Hey, Uncle Scar. When I'm king, what'll that make you? A monkey's uncle. You're so weird. You have no idea. So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he? Everything. He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border? Well, no. He said I can't go there. And he's absolutely right. It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there. Well, I'm brave. What's out there? I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you. Why not? I'm only looking out for the wellbeing of my favorite nephew. Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew. All the more reason for me to be protective. An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. Oops! An elephant what? Whoa! Oh, dear, I've said too much. Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all. Just do me one favor. Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place. No problem. There's a good lad. You run along now and have fun. And remember, it's our little secret. Hey, Nala. Hi, Simba. Come on. I just heard about this great place. Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath. And it's time for yours. Mom! Mom, you're messing up my mane! Okay, okay, I'm clean. Can we go now? So, where are we going? It better not be anyplace dumb. No, it's really cool. So, where is this really cool place? Oh. Uh, around the water hole. The water hole? What's so great about the water hole? I'll show you when we get there. Oh. Uh, mom, can I go with Simba? Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi? Well... Please? It's all right with me. Yeah! All right! As long as Zazu goes with you. No, not Zazu. Step lively. The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave. So, where are we really going? An elephant graveyard. Wow! Shh! Zazu. Right. So, how are we gonna ditch the dodo? Oh, just look at you two. Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna. Your parents will be thrilled, what with your being betrothed and all. Bewhat? Betrothed. Intended. Affianced. Meaning... One day, you two are going to be married. Yuck! Eww! I can't marry her. She's my friend. Yeah, it'd be so weird. Sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice. It's a tradition going back generations. When I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go. Not so long as I'm around. Well, in that case, you're fired. Nice try, but only the king can do that. Well, he's the future king. Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you. Not yet, I don't. And with an attitude like that, I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king, indeed. Not the way I see it. I'm gonna be a mighty king  So enemies beware  Well, I've never seen  a king of beasts  With quite so little hair  I'm gonna be the main event  Like no king was before  I'm brushin' up on lookin' down  I'm workin' on my roar  Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing  Oh, I just can't wait to be king  You've rather along way to go, young master, if you think... No one sayin', ""Do this"" Now, when I said that...  No one saying, ""Be there"" What I meant was...  No one sayin', ""Stop that"" You don't realize...  No one sayin', ""See here"" Now, see here!  Free to run around all day  Well, that's definitely out. Free to do it all my way  I think it's time that you and I  Arranged a hearttoheart  Kings don't need advice  From little hornbills for a start  If this is where the monarchy is headed  Count me out  Out of service, out of Africa  I wouldn't hang about  This child is getting wildly out of wing  Oh, I just can't wait to be king  Everybody, look left  Everybody, look right  Everywhere you look, I'm  Standing in the spotlight  Not yet! Let every creature go for broke and sing  Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing  It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling  Oh, I just can't wait to be king  Oh, I just can't wait to be king  Oh, I just can't wait  To be king   I beg your pardon, madam, but get off! Simba? Nala!  All right! It worked! We lost him. I am a genius. Hey, genius, it was my idea. Yeah, but I pulled it off. With me! Oh, yeah? Pinned ya. Hey, let me up!  Pinned ya again. This is it. We made it. Whoa! It's really creepy. Yeah. Isn't it great? We could get in big trouble. I know! I wonder if its brains are still in there. There's only one way to know. Come on, let's go check it out. Wrong! The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here. Oh, man! We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands. Look, banana beak is scared. It's Mr. banana beak to you, fuzzy, and right now we are all in very real danger. Danger? Ha! I walk on the wild side. I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha ha!  Well, well, well, Banzai, what have we got here? I don't know, Shenzi. What do you think, Ed?  Just what I was thinking. A trio of trespassers! And quite by accident, let me assure you. A simple navigational error. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. I know you. You're Mufasa's little stooge. I, madam, am the king's majordomo. And that would make you... The future king. Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom? Huh! You can't do anything to me. Technically, they can. We are on their land. But you told me they're nothing but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers. Ixnay on the upidstay. Who are you callin' upidstay? My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun! It's time to go! What's the hurry? We'd love you to stick around for dinner. Yeah, we could have whatever's lion around! Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one! Make mine a cub sandwich! Whaddaya think? What, Ed? What is it? Hey, did we order this dinner to go? No, why? 'Cause there it goes!   Did we lose 'em? I think so. Where's Zazu? The little majordomo bird hippetyhopped all the way to the birdieboiler. Oh, no! Not the birdieboiler! Aaaah! Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size? Like you? Oops. Boo! Simba!  Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.  That was it? Do it again. Come on.   Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle! Silence! We're gonna shut up right now! Calm down. We're really sorry. If you ever come near my son again... Oh, this is... This is your son? Oh, your son. Did you know that? No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you? No, of course not. No. Ed?  Toodles. Dad, I... You deliberately disobeyed me. Dad, I'm... I'm sorry. Let's go home. I thought you were very brave. Zazu. Yes, sire? Take Nala home. I've got to teach my son a lesson. Come, Nala. Simba, good luck. Simba! Simba, I'm very disappointed in you. I know. You could've been killed. You deliberately disobeyed me, and what's worse, you put Nala in danger. I was just trying to be brave, like you. I'm only brave when I have to be. Simba, being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble. But you're not scared of anything. I was today. You were? Yes. I thought I might lose you. I guess even kings get scared, huh? Mmhmm. But you know what? What? I think those hyenas were even scareder.  'Cause nobody messes with your dad. Come here, you. Oh, no! No! Aagh! Uhh!  Come here!  Gotcha!  Dad? Hmm? We're pals, right? Right. And we'll always be together, right? Simba, let me tell you something that my father told me. Look at the stars. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. Really? Yes. So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you. And so will I. Man, that lousy Mufasa. I won't be able to sit for a week.  It's not funny, Ed.  Hey, shut up!  Will you knock it off? Well, he started it. Look at you guys. No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain. Man, I hate dangling. Yeah? If it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint. Man, I hate lions. So pushy. And hairy. And stinky. And, man, are they... ugly! Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad. Oh. Oh, Scar. It's just you. We were afraid it was somebody important. Yeah, you know, like Mufasa. Yeah. I see. Now that's power! Tell me about it. I just hear that name and I shudder. Mufasa! Ooh! Do it again. Mufasa! Ooooh! Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa! Ooh, it tingles me. I'm surrounded by idiots. Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal. Charmed. Oh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper. Yeah. Hey, did you bring us anything to eat, Scar, old buddy, old pal? Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya? I don't think you really deserve this. I practically giftwrapped those cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them. Well, you know, it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar. Yeah. What were we supposed to do? Kill Mufasa?  Precisely. I know that your powers of retention  Are as wet as a warthog's backside  But thick as you are, pay attention  My words are a matter of pride  It's clear from your vacant expressions  The lights are not all on upstairs  But we're talking kings and successions  Even you can't be caught unawares  So prepare for the chance of a lifetime  Be prepared for sensational news  A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer  And where do we feature?  Just listen to teacher  I know it sounds sordid  But you'll be rewarded  When at last I am given my dues  And injustice deliciously squared  Be prepared  Yeah, be prepared. We'll be prepared. For what? For the death of the king. Why, is he sick? No, fool, we're going to kill him. And Simba, too. Great idea. Who needs a king?  No king, no king, lala lala la la  Idiots! There will be a king! Hey, but you said... I will be king! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again. Yeah! All right! Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the king! It's great that we'll soon be connected  With a king who'll be alltime adored  Of course, quid pro quo you're expected  To take certain duties on board  The future is littered with prizes  And though I'm the main addressee  The point that I must emphasize is  You won't get a sniff without me!  So prepare for the coup of the century  Be prepared for the murkiest scam  Meticulous planning  Tenacity spanning  Decades of denial  ls simply why I'll be king undisputed  Respected, saluted  And seen for the wonder I am  Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared  Be prepared  Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared  Be prepared   You wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you. Ooh, what is it? If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it? If you tell me, I'll still act surprised. Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy. Come on, Uncle Scar. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is just for you and your daddy. You know, a sort of fatherson thing. Well, I'd better go get him. I'll go with you. No. No. Just stay on this rock. You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas. You know about that? Simba, everybody knows about that. Really? Oh, yes. Lucky daddy was there to save you, eh? Oh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours, hmm? Oh. Okay. Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like this surprise? Simba, it's to die for.  Shut up. I can't help it. I'm so hungry. I got to have a wildebeest. Stay put. Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones? No. We wait for the signal from Scar. There he is. Let's go. ""Little roar."" Puh! Rarr! Rrrarr! Rarr!    Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move. Odd. Mufasa, quick. Stampede in the gorge. Simba's down there! Simba? Zazu, help me! Your father is on the way! Hold on! Hurry! There! There on that tree! Hold on, Simba! Dad! Oh, Scar, this is awful! What'll we do? What'll we do? I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do. Dad! Scar! Brother. Brother, help me! Long live the king. No!  Dad!  Dad? Dad? Dad, come on. You got to get up. Dad? We got to go home. Help!  Somebody! Anybody. Help.  Simba. What have you done? There were wildebeests, and he tried to save me. It was an accident. I didn't mean for it to happen. Of course. Of course you didn't. No one ever means for these things to happen. But the king is dead. And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive. Oh, what will your mother think? What am I going to do? Run away, Simba. Run. Run away and never return. Kill him.  Whoa! Yow!  Aah! Ohh! Yeow! Hey, there he goes. There he goes. So go get him. There ain't no way I'm going in there. What, you want me to come out looking like you, cactus butt? But we got to finish the job. Well, he's as good as dead out there anyway. And if he comes back, we'll kill him. Yeah! You hear that? If you ever come back, we'll kill you!  Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy. But to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live... For me, it is a deep, personal loss. So it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne. Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future.    Yaaaah! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! I love this! Bowling for buzzards. Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time. Uhoh. Hey, Timon, you better come look. I think it's still alive. Eeeuw. All righty, what have we got here?   Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it! Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion. Look at him. He's so cute and all alone. Can we keep him? Pumbaa, are you nuts? You're talking about a lion. Lions eat guys like us. But he's so little. He's going to get bigger. Maybe he'll be on our side. That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. Maybe he'll... Hey, I've got it. What if he's on our side? You know, having a lion around might not be such a bad idea. So we're keeping him? Of course. Who's the brains of this outfit? Uh... My point exactly. Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out of here and find some shade. You okay, kid? I guess so. You nearly died. I saved you.  Well, Pumbaa helped. A little. Thanks for your help. Hey, where you going? Nowhere. Gee, he looks blue. I'd say brownish gold. No, no, no. I mean he's depressed. Kid, what's eating you? Nothing. He's at the top of the food chain. The food chain! Ahem. So, where you from? Who cares? I can't go back. Ah, you're an outcast. That's great. So are we. What'd you do, kid? Something terrible. But I don't want to talk about it. We don't want to hear about it. Come on, Timon. Anything we can do? Not unless you can change the past. You know, kid, in times like this, my buddy Timon here says, ""You got to put your behind in your past."" No, no, no. I mean... Amateur. Lie down before you hurt yourself. It's, ""You got to put your past behind you."" Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right? Right. Wrong! When the world turns its back on you, You turn your back on the world. Well, that's not what I was taught. Then maybe you need a new lesson. Repeat after me. Ahem. Hakuna matata.  What'?

And I got downhearted  How did you feel? Every time that l...  Hey, not in front of the kids. Oh, sorry.

Hey, this looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub. Eugh, what's that? A grub. What's it look like? Eugh! Gross. Mmm. Tastes like chicken. Slimy yet satisfying. These are rare delicacies. Mmm. Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch. You'll learn to love them. I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life, no rules, no responsibilities. Ooh, the little creamfilled kind.

It's a small world after all  No, no! Anything but that! I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts  Deedle dee dee  There they are astanding in a row  Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head  I would never have had to do this with Mufasa. What? What did you say? Nothing. You know the law. Never, ever mention that name in my presence. I am the king! Yes, sire, you are the king. I... I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences in your royal managerial approaches. Hey, boss. Oh, what is it this time? We got a bone to pick with you. I'll handle this. Scar, there's no food, no water. Yeah. It's dinner time and we ain't got no stinking entrÃ©es. It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting. Yeah, but they won't go hunt. Oh... Eat Zazu. Oh, you wouldn't want me. I'd be so tough and gamey and... Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous. All you need is a little garlic. I thought things were bad under Mufasa. What did you say? I said Muf... I said quÃ© pasa?  Good. Now get out. But we're still hungry. Out!   Whoa! Nice one, Simba. Thanks. Man, I'm stuffed. Me, too. I ate like a pig. Pumbaa, you are a pig. Oh. Right.  Timon? Yeah? Ever wonder what those sparkling dots are up there? Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know. Oh? What are they? They're fireflies. Fireflies that got stuck up in that big blueishblack thing. Oh, gee. I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away. Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas. Simba, what do you think? Well, I don't know. Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give. Come on. We told you ours. Please? Well... Somebody once told me that the great kings of the past are up there watching over us. Really? You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us? Pffff! Who told you something like that? Yeah, yeah. What mook made that up? Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh? Aw, you're killing me. Yeah.  Was it something I said?   Hmm.  Hmm. Simba? He's... He's alive? He's alive!  It is time. Awimoweh, awimoweh  Awimoweh, awimoweh  In the jungle, the mighty jungle  The lion sleeps tonight  In the jungle, the mighty jungle  The lion sleeps to...  I can't hear you, buddy. Back me up. Awiiiiii  Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  APumbaabumbaaweh  Pumbaa? Pumbaa?  Hmm?  Timon?  Aaggghh!  Pumbaa? Pumbaa! Pumbaa! Pumbaa, Pumbaa! Hey, what's going on? She's going to eat me! Huh? Whoa! Jeez, why do I always have to save your... Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you. Everything's going to be okay. Get her! Bite her head! Go for the jugular! The jugular! See, I told you he'd come in handy.  Nala? Is it really you? Who are you? It's me. Simba. Simba? Whoa! How did you... Wow! Where did you come from? This is gr... It's great to see you! Hey, what's goin' on here? What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? Hey! What's goin' on here? Timon, this is Nala. She's my best friend. Friend? Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here. Huh? Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala. Pleased to make your acquaintance. The pleasure is all mine. How do you... Whoa, whoa! Time out! Let me get this straight. You know her, she knows you. But she wants to eat him, and everybody's okay with this? Did I miss something? Relax, Timon. Wait till everyone finds out you've been here all this time. And your mother, what will she think? She doesn't have to know. Nobody has to know. Of course they do. Everyone thinks you're dead. They do? Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede. He did? What else did he tell you? What else matters? You're alive. And that means, you're the king. King? Lady, have you got your lions crossed! King? Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Stop it. It's not gravel, it's grovel. And don't! He's not the king. Are you? No. Simba! No, I'm not the king. Maybe I was gonna be, but that was a long time ago. Let me get this straight. You're the king? And never told us? Look, I'm still the same guy. But with power. Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes? Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us, right, Simba? Mm... Maybe you'd better go. It starts. You think you know a guy.  Timon and Pumbaa, you learn to love 'em. What? What is it? It's like you're back from the dead. You don't know how much this will mean to everyone. What it means to me. Hey, it's okay. I've really missed you. I've missed you, too. I tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks. Oh, sorry. Not you! Them! Him, her, alone. What's wrong with that? I can see what's happening  What? And they don't have a clue  Who? They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line  Our trio's down to two  Oh.  The sweet caress of twilight  There's magic everywhere  And with all this romantic atmosphere  Disaster's in the air  Can you feel the love tonight?  The peace the evening brings  The world for once  In perfect harmony  With all its living things  So many things to tell her  But how to make her see  The truth about my past?  Impossible, she'd turn away from me  He's holding back, he's hiding  But what, I can't decide  Why won't he be the king I know he is?  The king I see inside?  Can you feel the love tonight?  The peace the evening brings  The world for once  In perfect harmony  With all its living things  Can you feel the love tonight?  You needn't look too far  Stealing through  The night's uncertainties  Love is where they are  And if he falls in love tonight   It can be assumed  His carefree days  With us are history  In short, our pal  ls doomed  Isn't this a great place? It is beautiful. But I don't understand something. You've been alive all this time. Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock? Well, I just needed to get out on my own, live my own life. And I did, and it's great. We've really needed you at home. No one needs me. Yes, we do. You're the king. Nala, we've been through this. I'm not the king. Scar is. Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands. What? Everything's destroyed. There's no food, no water. Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve. I can't go back. Why? You wouldn't understand. What? No, no, no. It doesn't matter. Hakuna matata.  What? Hakuna matata.  It's something I learned out here. Sometimes bad things happen... Simba... ...and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry? Because it's your responsibility. Well, what about you? You left. I left to find help, and I found you. Don't you understand? You're our only hope. Sorry. What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember. You're right. I'm not. Now are you satisfied? No. Just disappointed. You know, you're starting to sound like my father. Good. At least one of us does. You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life? You don't even know what I've been through. I would if you'd just tell me. Forget it! Fine! She's wrong. I can't go back. What would it prove, anyway? It won't change anything. You can't change the past. You said you'd always be there for me! But you're not. And it's because of me. It's my fault. It's my fault.  Asante sana, squash banana  We we nugu, imi mi apana  Asante sana, squash banana  We we nugu, imi mi apana  Asante sana, squash banana  We we nugu, imi mi apana    Asante sana, squash banana We we nugu, imi mi apana  Come on, will you cut it out? Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!  Creepy little monkey. Will you stop following me? Who are you? The question is, who are you? I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure. Well, I know who you are. Shh. Come here. It's a secret. Asante sana, squash banana  Grrr! Enough! What is that supposed to mean? It means you are a baboon, and I'm not. I think you're a little confused. Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused. You don't even know who you are. Oh, and I suppose you know. Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy. Bye. Hey, wait! You knew my father? Correction, I know your father. I hate to tell you this, but he died a long time ago. Nope. Wrong again! Ha ha ha! He's alive, and I'll show him to you. You follow old Rafiki. He knows the way. Come on! Don't dawdle. Hurry up! Hey, whoa, wait, wait. Come on. Come on! Would you slow down?  Stop! Look down there. That's not my father. That's just my reflection. No. Look harder. You see? He lives in you. Simba. Father? Simba, you have forgotten me. No. How could I? You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me. Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become. You must take your place in the circle of life. How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be. Remember who you are. You are my son and the one true king. Remember who you are. No! Please, don't leave me! Remember. Father! Remember! Don't leave me. Remember. What was that? Ha ha! The weather.  Very peculiar, don't you think? Yeah. Looks like the winds are changing. Ahh, change is good. Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do, but going back means I'll have to face my past. I've been running from it for so long. Ow! Jeez! What was that for? It doesn't matter. It's in the past. Yeah, but it still hurts. Oh, yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it. Ah! You see? So what are you going to do? First, I'm gonna take your stick. No, no, no, no! Not the stick! Hey! Where are you going? I'm going back! Good! Go on! Get out of here!  Whoo! Ha ha ha! Whoooo! Whoooo!  Grubs! Grubs! Hey. Hey, wake up. It's okay! Whoa, whoa! It's okay! It's me! Don't ever do that again. Carnivores! Oy! Have you guys seen Simba? I thought he was with you. He was, but now I can't find him. Where is he? Ho ho! You won't find him here! Ha ha! The king has returned. I can't believe it. He's gone back! Gone back? What do you mean? Hey, what's goin' on here? Who's the monkey? Simba went back to challenge Scar. Who? Scar. Who's got a scar? No, it's his uncle. The monkey's his uncle? No! Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle to take his place as king. Oh. Simba, wait up! It's awful, isn't it? I didn't want to believe you. What made you come back? I finally got some sense knocked into me, and I've got the bump to prove it. Besides, this is my kingdom. If I don't fight for it, who will? I will. It's gonna be dangerous. Danger? Ha! I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha! I see nothing funny about this. Timon! Pumbaa! What are you doing here? At your service, my liege. Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle for this? Yes, Timon. This is my home. Oh. Talk about your fixerupper! Well, Simba, if it's important to you, we're with you to the end. Hyenas. I hate hyenas. So what's your plan for getting past those guys? Live bait. Good idea. Hey! Come on, Timon. You guys have to create a diversion. What do you want me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?  Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat  Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat  Come on down and dine on this tasty swine  All you have to do is get in line  Are you achin'  Yep, yep, yep. For some bacon?  Yep, yep, yep. He's a big pig  Yep, yep. You could be a big pig, too! Oi!  Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses. I'll look for Scar.  Sarabi!  Yes, Scar? Where is your hunting party? They're not doing their job. Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on. No, you're just not looking hard enough. It's over. There is nothing left. We have only one choice. We must leave Pride Rock. We're not going anywhere. You have sentenced us to death. Then so be it. You can't do that. I am the king. I can do whatever I want. If you were half the king Mufasa was... I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!  Mufasa? No, you're dead.  Mufasa? No. It's me. Simba! You're alive? How can that be? It doesn't matter. I'm home. Simba? Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised to see you alive. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart. Oh, Simba, you must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom... Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar. Oh, well, I would, naturally. However, there is one little problem. You see them? They think I'm king. Well, we don't. Simba's the rightful king. The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight. Oh, must this all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member. Wouldn't you agree, Simba? That's not gonna work, Scar. I've put it behind me. But what about your faithful subjects? Have they put it behind them? Simba, what is he talking about? Ah, so you haven't told them your little secret. Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them. Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death. I am. It's not true. Tell me it's not true. It's true. You see? He admits it! Murderer! No! It was an accident. If it weren't for you, Mufasa would be alive. It's your fault he's dead! Do you deny it? No. Then you're guilty. No, I'm not a murderer! Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again, but this time daddy isn't here to save you, and now everyone knows why! Simba! Now, this looks familiar. Hmm. Where have I seen this before? Let me think. Hmm. Oh, yes. I remember. This is just the way your father looked before he died. And here's my little secret. I killed Mufasa. No! Murderer! No, Simba, please. Tell them the truth. Truth? But truth is in the eye of the behold... All right. All right. I did it. So they can hear you. I killed Mufasa! Heeyah! Excuse me. Pardon me. Comin' through. Hot stuff. Whoo!   Aagghh! Let me out! Let me out! Let me in! Let me in!  Please, don't eat me. Drop 'em! Hey, who's the pig? Are you talkin' to me? Uhoh. He called him a pig. To me? Shouldn't have done that. To me? Now they're in for it. They call me Mr. Pig! Aaaaggghhh! Take that, you stupid... Take that and that! Run, you yellowbelly! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!   Murderer. Simba. Simba, please. Please, have mercy. I beg you. You don't deserve to live. But Simba, I am family. It's the hyenas who are the real enemy. It was their fault. It was their idea. Why should I believe you? Everything you ever told me was a lie. What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your own uncle. No, Scar. I'm not like you. Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble. I'll make it up to you, I promise. And how can I prove myself to you? Tell me. I mean, anything. Run. Run away, Scar, and never return. Er... Yes. Of course. As you wish, Your Majesty!  Ah, my friends! Friends? I thought he said we were the enemy. Yeah. That's what I heard. Ed? No. Let me explain. No, you don't understand! No, I didn't mean... No! No! It is time. Remember.

The Nightmare Before Christmas,Disney,1990,1993,Animation,"'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems, in a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.

Without your brilliant leadership__ Not at all, Mayor. You're such a scream, Jack! You're a witch's fondest dream. You made walls fall, Jack. ""Walls fall""? You made the very mountains crack, Jack. The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally. Let go. You're not ready for much excitement. Yes, I am. You're coming with me. No, I'm not! Come back here, you foolish__ Ow! Oh. Oh! Ooh, Jack, you made wounds ooze and flesh crawl. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hold it! We haven't given out the prizes yet. Our first award goes to the vampires... for most blood drained in a single evening. Our second and honorable mention... goes to the fabulous Dark Lagoon Leeches. Nice work, Bone Daddy. Yeah, I guess so. Just like last year. And the year before that, and the year before that. There are few who deny  At what I do  I am the best  For my talents  are renowned far and wide  When it comes to surprises  in the moonlit night  I excel without ever  even trying  With the slightest  little effort  Of my ghostlike charms  I have seen grown men  give out a shriek  With a wave of my hand  And a wellplaced moan  I have swept the very bravest  off their feet  Yet year after year  it's the same routine  And I grow so weary  of the sound of screams  And I, Jack  the Pumpkin King  Have grown so tired  of the same old thing  Oh, somewhere deep  Inside of these bones  An emptiness  Began to grow  There's something  out there  Far from my home  A longing that  I've never known  I'm the master of fright  And a demon of light  And I'll scare you  right out of your pants  To a guy in Kentucky  I'm Mr. Unlucky  And I'm known throughout  England and France  And since I am dead  I can take off my head  To recite Shakespearean  quotations  No animal nor man  can scream like I can  With the fury  of my recitations  But who here  Would ever understand  That the Pumpkin King  with the skeleton grin  Would tire of his crown  If they only understood  He'd give it all up  if he only could  Oh, there's an empty  Place in my bones  That calls out for  Something unknown  The fame and praise  Come year after year  Does nothing for  These empty tears  Jack. I know how you feel. Sally. You've come back. I had to. For this. Yes. Shall we, then? That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea and run off. Three times. You're mine, you know. I made you with my own hands. You can make other creations. I'm restless. I can't help it. It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass. We need to be patient, that's all. But I don't want to be patient. No, Zero. Not now. I'm not in the mood. All right. Here you go, boy. Mornin', gents. Jack? You home? Jack, I've got the plans for next Halloween. I need to go over them with you so we can get started. Jack, please, I'm only an elected official here. I can't make decisions by myself. Jack! Answer me! He's not home. Where is he? He hasn't been home all night. Where are we? It's someplace new. What is this? Whoa! Whoa! What's this? What's this?  There's color everywhere  What's this  There's white things in the air  What's this? I can't believe my eyes  I must be dreaming  Wake up, Jack! This isn't fair  What's this  Lalalalalalala  What's this, What's this  There's something very wrong  What's this, there's people  singing songs, what's this  The streets are lined with  little creatures laughing  Everybody seems so happy  Have I possibly gone daffy  What is this  What's this  There's children throwing snowballs  instead of throwing heads  They're busy building toys  And absolutely no one's dead  There's frost in every window  Oh, I can't believe my eyes  And in my bones  I feel the warmth  That's coming  from inside  Oh, look, what's this  They're hanging mistletoe They kiss  Why, that looks so unique  Inspired  They're gathering around  to hear a story  Roasting chestnuts on a fire  What's this  What's this in here  They've got a little tree How queer  And who would ever think  And why  They're covering it  with tiny little things  They've got electric  lights on strings  And there's a smile on everyone,  so now correct me if I'm wrong  This looks like fun  This looks like fun  Oh, could it be I got my wish  What's this  Oh my, what now  The children are asleep  But look  There's nothing underneath  No ghouls, no witches here to scream  and scare them or ensnare them  Only little cozy things  Secure inside  their dreamland  What's this  The monsters are all missing  and the nightmares can't be found  And in their place there seems  to be good feeling all around  Instead of screams, I swear  I can hear music in the air  The smell of cakes and pies  are absolutely everywhere  The sights, the sounds  They're everywhere and all around  I've never felt  so good before  This empty place  inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough  I want it Oh, I want it  Oh, I want it for my own  I've got to know, I've got to know  what is this place that I have found  What is this  Christmas Town? Hmm. Hohohoho! Hohohoho! Hmm. This has never happened before. It's suspicious. It's peculiar. It's scary. Stand aside. Coming through. We've got to find Jack! There's only 365 days left till next Halloween! Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check? I looked in every mausoleum. We opened the sarcophagi! I tromped through the pumpkin patch. I peeked behind the Cyclops' eye. I did, but he wasn't there. It's time to sound the alarms! Frog's breath will overpower any odor. Oh! Bitter! Worm's wart. WhWhere's that worm's wart? Sally! Is that soup ready yet? Ah. Coming! Lunch! Ah, what's that? Worm's wart! Mmm! And frog's breath. WhWhat's wrong? II thought you like frog's breath. Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it, I won't swallow a spoonful. I'm not hungry. Oops. You want me to starve. An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is. Me, to whom you owe your very life. Oh, don't be silly. Mmm! See? Scrumptious! Did anyone think to dredge the lake? This morning. Hear that? Shh. What? Zero! Jack's back! Yea! Jack's back! Where have you been? Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it! When? Immediately! Town meeting! Town meeting! Town meeting tonight! Town meeting! Town meeting tonight! Listen, everyone. I want to tell you about Christmas Town. There were objects  so peculiar  They were not  to be believed  All around things  to tantalize my brain  It's a world unlike  anything I've ever seen  And as hard as I tried  I can't seem to describe  Like a most  improbable dream  But you must believe  when I tell you this  It's as real as my skull  and it does exist  Here, let me show you. Ooh! This is a thing  called a present  The whole thing starts with a box  A box  Is it steel  Are there locks  Is it filled with a pox  A pox How delightful, a pox  If you please. Just a box with  bright colored paper  And the whole thing's  topped with a bow  A bow  But why  How ugly! What's in it  What's in it  That's the point of the thing  Not to know  It's a bat  Will it bend  It's a rat  Will it break  Perhaps it's the head  that I found in the lake  Listen now  You don't understand  That's not the point  of Christmasland  Now pay attention  We pick up  an oversized sock  And hang it like this  on the wall  Oh, yes, does it  still have a foot  Let me see, let me look  Is it rotted and covered with gook  Um, let me explain. There's no foot inside  but there's candy  Or sometimes it's filled  with small toys  Small toys, do they bite  or explode in the sack  Do they snap  Perhaps they just spring out  and scare girls and boys  What a splendid idea  This Christmas sounds fun  I fully endorse it  Let's try it at once  Everyone, please  Now not so fast  There's something here  that you don't quite grasp  I don't know. Do you get it? Well, I may as well give them what they want. And the best I must confess  I have saved for the last  For the ruler  of this Christmasland  Is a fearsome king  with a deep, mighty voice  Least, that's what  I've come to understand  And I've also heard it told  that he's something to behold  Like a lobster  Huge and red  When he sets out to slay  with his rain gear on  Carting bulging sacks  with his big, great arms  That is,  so I've heard it said  And on a dark, cold night  Under full moonlight  He flies into a fog like  a vulture in the sky  And they call him  Sandy Claws  Well, at least  they're excited  But they don't  understand  That special kind  of feeling  In Christmasland  Oh, well. Hmm. Hmm. There's got to be a logical way to explain this Christmas thing. You've poisoned me for the last time, you wretched girl. Oh, my head! The door is open! Hello? Jack Skellington! Up here, my boy. Doctor, I need to borrow some equipment. Is that so? Whatever for? I'm conducting a series of experiments. How perfectly marvelous. Curiosity killed the cat, you know. I know. Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up. Hmm. Experiments? Zero, I'm home. Interesting reaction. But what does it mean? You can come out now if you promise to behave. Sally? Sally? Oh! Gone again! Hmm. Oh! Something's up with Jack  Something's up with Jack  Don't know if we're ever  going to get him back  He's all alone up there  Locked away inside  Never says a word  Hope he hasn't died  Something's up with Jack  Something's up with Jack  Christmastime  is buzzing in my skull  Will it let me be  I cannot tell  There's so many things  I cannot grasp  When I think I've got it  then at last  Through my bony fingers  it does slip  Like a snowflake  in a fiery grip  Something here I'm not quite getting,  though I try I keep forgetting  Like a memory  long since past  Here in an instant  Gone in a flash  What does it mean  What does it mean  In these little  bricabrac  A secret's waiting  to be cracked  These dolls and toys  confuse me so  Confound it all  I love it though  Simple objects  Nothing more  But something's hidden  through a door  Though I do not  have the key  Something's here  I cannot see  What does it mean  What does it mean  What does it mean  Hmm. Hmm. I've read these Christmas  books so many times  I know the stories  and I know the rhymes  I know the Christmas carols  all by heart  My skull's so full  It's tearing me apart  As often as I've read them  something's wrong  So hard to put  my bony finger on  Or perhaps it's really not as deep  as I've been led to think  Am I trying  much too hard  Of course, I've been  too close to see  The answer's right in front of me  Right in front of me  It's simple really  Very clear  Like music drifting  in the air  Invisible  but everywhere  Just because  I cannot see it  Doesn't mean  I can't believe it  You know I think this Christmas thing  is not as tricky as it seems  And why should they have all the fun  It should belong to anyone  Not anyone, in fact  but me  Why, I can make  a Christmas tree  And there's no reason  I can find  I couldn't handle  Christmastime  I bet I could  improve it too  And that's exactly  what I'll do  Heeheeheeheehee! Eureka! This year... Christmas will be ours! Patience, everyone. Jack has a special job for each of us. Dr. Finkelstein! Your Christmas assignment is ready. Dr. Finkelstein, to the front of the line. What kind of noise is that for a baby to make? Perhaps it can be improved? No problem. I knew it! Doctor! Thank you for coming. We need some of these. Hmm. Their construction should be exceedingly simple, I think. How horrible our Christmas will be. No! How jolly! Oh. How jolly our Christmas will be. What are you doing here? Jack sent for us. Specifically. By name. Lock. Shock. Barrel. Jack! Jack! It's Boogie's boys. Ah, Halloween's finest trickortreaters. The job I have for you is top secret. It requires craft, cunning, mischief. And we thought you didn't like us, Jack. Absolutely no one is to know about it. Not a soul! Now... ...tree... ...Christmas Town... Ow! Hmm. And one more thing. Leave that noaccount Oogie Boogie out of this! Whatever you say, Jack. Of course, Jack. Wouldn't dream of it, Jack. Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws  I want to do it  Let's draw straws  Jack said we should work together  Three of a kind  Birds of a feather  Now and forever La la la la la la  La lala la lala  La lala lala  Kidnap the Sandy Claws  Lock him up real tight  Throw away the key and then  turn off all the lights  First we're going to set some bait  inside a nasty trap and wait  When he comes asniffing we will  snap the trap and close the gate  Wait, I've got a better plan  to catch this big red lobster man  Let's pop him in a boiling pot and  when he's done we'll butter him up  Kidnap the Sandy Claws  Throw him in a box  Bury him for 90 years  Then see if he talks  Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man  Can take the whole thing  over then  He'll be so pleased  I do declare  That he will cook him rare  Whee  I say that we take a cannon  aim it at his door and then  Knock three times and when he answers  Sandy Claws will be no more  You're so stupid! Think now  if we blow him up to smithereens  We may lose some pieces and then  Jack will beat us black and green  Kidnap the Sandy Claws  Tie him in a bag  Throw him in the ocean  Then see if he is sad  Because Mr. Oogie Boogie  is the meanest guy around  If I were on his boogie list  I'd get out of town  He'll be so pleased  by our success  That he'll reward us too  I'll bet  Perhaps he'll make  his special brew  Of snake and spider stew  Mmm! We're his little henchmen and  we take our job with pride  We do our best to please him  and stay on his good side  I wish my cohorts  weren't so dumb  I'm not the dumb one  You're no fun  Shut up, I've got something  Listen now  Make me  This one is real good  You'll see  We'll send a present  to his door  Upon there'll be  a note to read  Now in the box we'll wait and hide  until his curiosity  Entices him to look inside And then  we'll have him! One, two, three  Kidnap the Sandy Claws  Beat him with a stick  Lock him up for 90 years  See what makes him tick  Kidnap the Sandy Claws  Chop him into bits  Mr. Oogie Boogie  is sure to get his kicks  Kidnap the Sandy Claws  See what we will see  Lock him in a cage  and then throw away  The key  Sandy Claws, huh? It goes something like this. How about it? Think you can manage? Aone and atwo and athree and a__ Next! Fantastic! Now, why don't you all practice on that? And we'll be in great shape. Sally, I need your help more than anyone's. You certainly do, Jack. I had the most terrible vision. That's splendid! No! It was about your Christmas. There was smoke and fire__ That's not my Christmas! My Christmas is filled with laughter and joy... and... this: My Sandy Claws outfit. I want you to make it. Jack, please listen to me. It's going to be a disaster. How could it be? Just follow the pattern. This part's red. The trim is white. It's a mistake, Jack. Now, don't be modest. Who else is clever enough to make my Sandy Claws outfit? Next! I have every confidence in you. But it seems wrong to me, very wrong. This device is called a nutcracker. Jack, Jack! We caught him! We got him! Perfect! Open it up, quickly. That's not Sandy Claws. It isn't? Who is it? Bunny! Not Sandy Claws. Take him back! We followed your instructions. We went through the door. Which door? There's more than one! Sandy Claws is behind the door shaped like this. I told you! You knock it off! Ow! Ow! I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir. Take him home first! And apologize again. Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him. Treat him nicely. Got it. We'll get it right... next time! You will be a decided improvement... over that treacherous Sally. Master! The plans! Excellent, Igor.

No. This is worse than I thought, much worse. Hohoho! Hohoho! I know. Me on vacation? On Christmas Eve? Where are we taking him? Where? To Oogie Boogie, of course. There isn't anywhere in the whole world more comfortable than that. And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he? Yes, he did! Haven't you heard of peace on earth and good will toward men? No! Oh! This'll stop Jack. What a joy to think of... all we'll have in common. We'll have conversations... worth having. Don't do this! Naughty children never get any presents. I think he might be too big! Oooh! No, he's not. If he can go down a chimney, he can fit... down... here. Well, well, well! What have we here? Sandy Claws, huh? Oooh, I'm really scared!

Attention, citizens. Terrible news. There's still no sign of Santa Claus. Although the impostor has been shot down, it looks like Christmas will have to be canceled this year.

And l say again, mate, l'm coming in! Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky, we gotta extend the runway. Here we go! We'll never make it! Hot! Passengers, please remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop. Thank you. Quick, Sparky, we need to make a drag line! Don't try and tell me the runway's too short. Hold this for me, will you, pal? Bloke ought to have his wings clipped. Captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines... Crazy Yanks. They think they can do any fool thing without regard for... Welcome to Australia, ma'am. Name's Jake. If there's any way I can make your stay pleasant, don't hesitate to ask. How kind. Allow me to get that bag for you. I've got a lot of luggage here. Let me give you a hand with those. Part of the friendly service at Albatross... Big time hurt! Back! It's out! Are you all right? Don't worry, I'll handle this. Sparky, watch the tower. We gotta get this bird to the hospital. Can't go down, can't go up. Take the bags! Heave! Ho! What are you doing? What's going on? Wait! Wait a minute. Just stop everything. Wilbur, don't worry. We'll come back the moment we find the boy. Wait! Wait a minute! Don't leave me here, please! I'm feeling much better now. I'm even ready to hit the beaches. I'm even ready to mambo. Doctor, will he be all right? Now, my dear. Keep a stiff upper lip. They all come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin. Off with you now. Leave everything to me. Shoo, shoo. Off you go. Hop to it, ladies. We've got a bent bird on our hands. Move, bustle, bustle. That's it. Will it hurt, Doc? Dear boy, you won't feel a thing. Launch the back brace! Hey, wait! I've been skewered! I've already missed tea, Mr Albatross. Now don't force me to take drastic measures. You must relax. Relax? I have never been more relaxed in my life! If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead! I'm not convinced. 60 milligrams! 60 milligrams. Hey! What? Are you guys crazy? You can't do that to me! I'm an American citizen, buddy! Better double it! Double? Double, coming up! No! Prepare the albatross for medication. I'm dreaming! Come on, Wilbur. Wake up, boy! Three degrees right. Come on! Three degrees right. Down two degrees. Don't go down two! Down two degrees. Ready! No, I'm not ready! No, please! Aim! Please don't do this to me. Fire! Now we just gotta figure out how to get there. So are you and your husband here on a little outback excursion? No, we're not married. In fact, we're here on a top secret mission. Very hushhush. Gonna rescue that kid McLeach nabbed? Why, that's right! How did you know? You'll find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback, miss. So which way you taking? Suicide Trail through Nightmare Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge? ""Suicide Trail""? Good choice. More snakes, less quicksand. Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scotfree, that is until... Dead Dingo Pass. Wait a minute, I don't see any of that stuff on the map. A map's no good in the outback! What you really need is someone who knows the territory. Mr Jake, will you guide us? At your service! Better take my arm, miss. It's gonna be a treacherous hike. I remember the time it was just me and 400 of these big, giant... Doesn't even know how to fold a map. This is how we get around in the outback, Miss B. The only way to travel, Berno. Yeah, it's just a little bumpy back here. Cinch up your seat belts, mates. We're coming in for a landing. Hold it, not yet! Well, boy, let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty, old memory of yours. Is she on Satan's Ridge? Or Nightmare Canyon? What do you think? Yeah, that's it. Right smack dab in the middle at Croc Falls! Am I getting warm? I told you, I don't remember. Don't you realise a bird that size is worth a fortune? I'll split the money 50/50. You can't get a better offer than that. You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you. Jake's been gone... Been gone a long time. Maybe I should go... Maybe I should go look for him. Don't you worry about Jake. He can handle himself. Yeah, I noticed. I am just sure he'll be back in no time. You know, now that we're alone, there's... There's something that I've been wanting to ask you. Yes? What is it? Well, it's like this. Miss Bianca, I would be most honoured if... Look out! No mice for you, Twister, not today! There! Miss Bianca! I've been looking all over for you. Now look. We got a long way to go, and you're gonna take us there. You're not gonna give us any trouble about it. Right? They're harmless once you look them in the eye, let them know who's boss. Ain't that right, mate? Now get. It's all right, Bernard. Jake has everything under control. Yeah, I noticed. You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told, I used to be quite a dingo wrestler. There was this one time, it was just me and 300 of these ferocious, mouseeating dingoes. Had me surrounded... I'll give you a night down here to think it over. But tomorrow, no more Mr Nice Guy. Joanna! You thickheaded chunk of fishbait! I'll never tell you where she is! Never! Never! Yeah, we'll never tell! You'll have to drag it out of us! Hey, where did you come from? The desert? Well, fancy that! Looks like McLeach has begun trapping his own kind! There's no hope for any of us now. No hope? No hope! No! But there must be a way out of here. There's a way out, all right. There is? There is? Absolutely. You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt, and our dear Frank... I don't want to hear it. Frank will go as... I can't hear you! A purse. No! A lovely ladies' purse. I don't want to go as a purse. Please, don't let him do it! Don't worry, we'll get out of here. We are? Yeah. If we all put our heads together, I'm sure we'll think of something. Yeah, something. Frank, what's wrong? Here he goes again. Take it easy. You don't want to hurt yourself again. I got it! All we gotta do is get the keys! Is that all? Well then, we better start packing our bags. No, wait. He's right. If we could get these long pieces of wood... Yeah, wood, good. Maybe we could... That's right, just a little more. There! Come on, everybody. Get some more stuff! The kid's right. What are we waiting for? That's it, you've got it! Hurry. We need something to tie it together. Hey, what do you got? Shoelaces! Almost. A little further. Yeah, yeah. It's okay. Let's try again. Yeah, yeah. Easy. Easy does it. Yeah, no, no! Yeah, yeah. Will somebody shut him up? We did it! You've got it! I've got it! I'll just take my tail, and I'll pick the lock, like this! Frank, give it a rest. You'll thank me when you're free. Look, I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit further. Show him who's boss, Berno! I feel like I got my head in a vice. Are we ready, nurse? Ready, Doctor. All right, ladies, snap to it! That smarts! Let me see here. Forceps! Forceps. No, what now? Spinal stretchulator. That's gonna hurt. Artery router. Mother! This is rusted tight. I wouldn't dream of using such a tool. Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter! The epidermal what? No! No! Mr Albatross, we haven't operated yet! You gotta catch me first, Doc. Mr Albatross, please! Cowabunga! Mr Albatross, we must return you to the operating room! You'll never take me alive! Please don't do this! Your spine needs tender... ...loving...care! My back! Hey! Hey! I can... It works! I'm cured! My back! Don't worry! I'm coming, you little mice. This is the finest fleet on two webbed feet. Oh, boy, I gotta go on a diet when I get home. Here we go! In other news, authorities in Mugwomp Flats called off the search for the missing boy. His backpack was found near Crocodile Falls, and rangers believe he was yet another victim of crocodile attack. Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution... Think you're pretty smart, don't you? Who outsmarted who? Who? Who outsmarted who? I still gotta get that boy to talking. I'm hungry. Can't think on an empty stomach. Gotta have protein. Gotta have eggs. Everyone's got his price. All I gotta do is offer him whatever he wants, and then not give it to him. Did you take one of my eggs? Open your mouth. These are not Joanna eggs. Let's see. The boy's got the eagle. I want the eagle. The boy won't give me the eagle. If I could just find the boy's weak spot, I could get him to tell me where the eagle is. But the boy's only got one weak spot, and that is the eagle. Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill, that would loosen his tongue and then... I got it! Got your hand caught in the cookie jar. Who you think you're messing with, you dumb animal? My mental facilities are twice what yours are, you pea brain. Joanna, I give you platypus eggs, I give you snake eggs, why, I'll even give you eagle eggs, but I want you to stay away from my... The eagle's eggs! That's it! That's the boy's weak spot! Push it in a little bit farther, take it back a little bit... I give up! I'll never get this. We're doomed! Doomed! Hey, look! Krebbs, Frank's out! Frank, you're free! Free? I'm free! I'm free! I'm free! Joanna'll hear! Double or nothing, he's caught in five minutes. Calm down, little mate. Didn't I tell you? Look at me, I'm free! Frank, get the keys. I should get the keys. I'm stuck! Quiet! Quiet, you fool! Take it easy, I'll get you loose. There you go. Now go get the keys. The keys. Yeah, yeah. Keys, keys, keys. I can't reach them. Quick, get something to stand on. Stand on, something to stand on. This ought to be rich. Stand on... Frank. Use the box! Climb up on the box! Of course, a box! Quiet! These darn things are heavy! Whoops. The keys, give us the keys! Over here! Give us the keys! Ride him, Frank! Howdy, howdy! Howdy, howdy, howdy! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Missed. Surprise! If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't like it here. Let me go, let go! Let go! What are you doing out of your cage? That's better. Come on, boy. Say goodbye to your little friends. It's the last you'll ever see of them. There is no time to waste. We must try to get in. Here, Miss Bianca, start digging. Has anyone considered trying, ""Open sesame""? Hey, it worked! Get out of here! Go on! Get! Look, Bernard, it's the boy! And McLeach. It's all over, boy. Your bird's dead. Someone shot her. Shot her, right outta the sky. No! What do you mean, no? You callin' me a liar? I heard it on the radio. And she could have been mine if it weren't for you. Now you better get, before I change my mind. Go on, get! Why is he letting him go? It's gotta be a trick. Too bad about those eggs, Joanna. They'll never survive without their mother. Well. Survival of the fittest, I guess. Bingo! Bird? Eggs? Listen. I didn't make it all the way through third grade for nothing. Don't know where he's going, but we can't let him get away. Hurry up, you two! Quickly, Bernard, now! No! Get between the treads! Bernard, Bianca, here, catch! Got it! Miss Bianca, you can do it! Boy, this is some head wind. Say, you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice running around down there, would you? Hey, where you going? I mean it, I'm looking for two little mice! Is it something I said? He's going down the cliff. Come on, we gotta warn him. Cody. Who are you? There is no time to explain. You're in great danger. Marahute? It can't be! Cody, wait! She's alive! Cody, please! You must listen! That's right, McLeach is on the cliff. Marahute, no! Turn back! Turn back! Stay away! It's a trap! I got her! I got her! Did you see that? Perfect shot! Perfect shot! She's mine! All mine! No! Hold tight you two. We're going for a ride! Bianca! Bernard! Meddlin' brat. Gonna get rid of him for good. Help, I'm slipping! Cody, don't move! There she is, Joanna. Just look at her. Look at the size of her. The rarest bird in the world. That bird's gonna make me rich. Filthy rich. I got what I want. Now, what does Joanna want? Does she wanna make sure that bird stays rare? How about some great, big, tripleA, jumbo eagle eggs? You want them? You want them? Go get them! No! Please! Why, whatever is the matter? Get moving! Joanna! You hurry up and eat those eggs and get your tail up here! Move it! Okay, you guys, she fell for it. Looks like the coast is clear. Girls? Girls, I'm here! Where are you, you little chickees, you? Wilbur? Wilbur! Don't ever do that to me again! Boy, I lost a lot of feathers on that one. Wilbur, am I glad to see you! Help me with these eggs, will you? Sure. Wait a minute, what the heck are you doing up here? The kidnapper took the boy and Jake. Miss Bianca. Miss Bianca's in trouble? That's terrible! We gotta do something! Bernard, I'm disappointed in you. Hiding under a nest while Bianca needs help. I gotta talk to you, mister. Wilbur. You should start searching the desert for her, and I'll scan the coastline! That's what I'll do. Ask the chicks on the beach. What? Listen! There's some chicks here that need help. Really? No. Wait a minute. Hold it. I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong. Don't even, no. Don't look at me! You're getting ""no."" Understand? I will not ever sit on those eggs! Nuts! Gotta learn to be more assertive. No is no is no. Hey, quit moving in there! Well, Joanna, it looks like Lady Luck has finally decided to smile on us. Everything's going our way. You can't do this! You're gonna get in big trouble! I'll tell the rangers where you are! I almost forgot. We got a loose end to tie up, haven't we, girl? Now, now, Cody, we mustn't lose hope. Bernard is still out there. That's right! If anyone can get us out of this scrape, it's old Berno! Nice bluff, Miss B. I wasn't bluffing. You don't know Bernard like I do. He'll never give up. Oh, my gosh! Excuse me. Look, I've got a long way to go, you're going to take me there, and you're not going to give me any trouble, right? Good. Now, get! Are you ready, boy? It's time you learned how to fish for crocs! They like it when you use live bait. And you're as live as they come. You get a line And l'll get a pole, matey You get a line l'll get a pole, friend You get a line, l'll get a pole We'll go fishing in the crocodile hole Buddy, pal of mine That's right, babies. Suppertime! It don't look good, Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one. Bernard, please hurry! Now, this is my idea of fun. Nothing personal, boy, but I wouldn't want to disappoint the rangers. They was looking so hard for you, and now they're gonna find you! What the blaze is going on here? Joanna. Did you know there was a razorback in my truck? Did ya? There was a razorback in my truck! Now you quit playing around and do yourjob, you fourlegged python! Hey, what happened to them keys? Must be around here somewhere. They couldn't just get up and walk away. Something weird's going on around here. I smell a big, fat rat. Look, it's Bernard! I don't believe it! Way to go, mate! Miss Bianca, Jake, catch! Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat. Blast! Oh, my gosh! I hope I know what I'm doing. Hey, get off me! Joanna! Joanna! You stupid lizard! Get off me! You idiot! Get off of me! No! No! Bernard, the boy! Help! Get back! Get away. Get away! I whooped you! I whooped you all! You'll think twice before messing with Percival C. McLeach! No! Don't give up, Cody! There! Hop on, Miss B! Help! Help! It's okay. Come on. Thanks, little mate. Bernard, you are magnificent. You are absolutely the hero of the day. Miss Bianca, before anything else happens, will you marry me? Bernard. Of course, I will! Well done, mate. Come on, Marahute, let's all go home. Help! Anybody! Bernard! Bianca! Where are you? Okay, that's it, I'm out of here. This is ridiculous. You can't leave me here alone. I'm gone! I am gone. No, stay in those eggs! That's a direct order! Hey, you're kind of a cute little feller."
Toy Story 2,Disney,1990,1999,Animation,"Buzz Lightyear mission log. All signs point to this planet as the location of Zurg's fortress, but there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. Come to me, my prey. To infinity and beyond! So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time. Not today, Zurg! No, no, no, no. Oh, you almost had him. I'm never gonna defeat Zurg! Sure, you will, Rex. In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am. But look at my little arms! I can't press the ""fire"" button and jump at the same time! Where is it? Where is it? Woody? Hang on, cowboy! Woody, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your list of things to do while I'm gone. Batteries need to be changed. Toys in the bottom of the chest need to be rotated. Oh, and make sure everyone attends Mr. Spell's seminar on what to do if you or a part of you is swallowed. Okay? Okay. Good. Okay. Woody, you haven't found your hat yet, have you? No! And Andy's leaving for cowboy camp any minute, and I can't find it anywhere! Don't worry, Woody. In just a few hours, you'll be sitting around a campfire with Andy making delicious, hot ""sch'moes."" They're called s'mores, Buzz. Right. Right. Of course. Has anyone found Woody's hat yet? Keep looking, men. Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching. The lawn gnome next door says it's not in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'. It's not in Molly's room. We've looked everywhere. I found it. You found my hat? Your hat? No. The missus lost her earring. Oh, my little sweet potato! Oh, you found it! Oh, it's so nice to have a big, strong spud around the house. Oh, great. That's just great. This'll be the first year I miss cowboy camp, all because of my stupid hat! Woody, look under your boot. Don't be silly. My hat is not under my boot. Would you just look? No hat. Just the word ""Andy."" And the boy who wrote that would take you to camp with or without your hat. I'm sorry, Bo. It's just that I've been lookin' forward to this all year. It's my one time with just me and Andy. You're cute when you care. Bo, not in front of Buzz. Let him look. Miss Peep, your sheep! This is Al from Al's Toy Barn, and I'm sittin' on good deals. Whoa!  ! think I'm feeling a deal hatching right now. Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck... Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear! Which one is off?  Buck, buck, buck! And that's cheap, cheap, cheap! So hurry on down... For cryin' out loud, it's this one. I despise that chicken. Fellas! Fellas! Okay, I got some good news, and I got some bad news. What news? The good news is I found your hat, Woody. My hat! Slink, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Where'd you find it? Well, that's the bad news. Oh, it's Buster! Canine alert! Man your battle stations! Let's move, move, move! Woody! Hide! Quick! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay! You found me! Buster, all right. Hey, how did he do, Hamm? Looks like a new record. Okay, boy. Sit. Reach for the sky. Gotchal! Great job, boy. Who's gonna miss me while I'm gone, huh? Who's gonna miss me? Who's gonna miss me? Andy, you got all your stuff? Have a good weekend, everybody. I'll see you Sunday night. It's in my room. Stick 'em up. I guess we'll work on that later. Hey, Woody. Ready to go to cowboy camp? Andy, honey, come on. Five minutes, and we're leavin'. Five minutes. Help, help! Somebody help me! Let her go, evil Dr. Pork Chop! Never! You must choose, Sheriff Woody. How shall she die? Shark, or death by monkeys? Choose! I choose Buzz Lightyear! What? That's not a choice! To infinity and beyond! I'll save you, Miss Peep. My hero. Thanks, Buzz. No problem, buddy. You should never tangle with the unstoppable duo of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Oh, no. Andy, let's go! Molly's already in her car seat. But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped. Oh, no. Maybe we can fix him on the way. No, just leave him. I'm sorry, honey, but you know toys don't last forever. What happened? Woody's been shelved. Andy! Woody? Woody? Honey, are you okay? Yeehaw! Ride 'em, cowboy! He's back? Hey, everybody! Andy's back! He's back early from cowboy camp! Places, everybody! Andy's coming! Yeah! Hey, Woody! Did you miss me? Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap. Ride 'em, cowboy! I forgot. You're broken. I don't wanna play with you anymore. No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No! Andy. Andy. Bye, Woody. No! No! Andy! Wheezy, is that you? Hey, Woody. What are you doing up here? I thought Mom took you to get your squeaker fixed months ago. Andy was so upset. Nah. She just told him that to calm him down and then put me on the shelf. Why didn't you yell for help? Well, I tried squeakin'. But I'm still broken. No one could hear me. Besides, the dust aggravates my condition. What's the point in prolonging the inevitable? We're all just one stitch away from here to there. Yard sale? Yard sale! Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up! There's a yard sale outside! Yard sale? Sarge, emergency roll call! Sir, yes, sir!

To the yard sale! What's goin' on? He's nuts. His arm ain't that bad. Don't do it, Woody! We love you! Careful on the steps, now. Okay, boy. Let's go. And keep it casual. Not that casual. Piggy bank coming through, coming through. Is he out there? There he is. He's getting in the box! He's sellin' himself for 25 cents! Woody, you're worth more than that. Hold on. Hold on. He's got something. It's Wheezy! Wheezy? Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue. Good boy, Buster. Hold still. There. There you go, pal. Bless you, Woody. All right, now. Back to Andy's room. Way to go, cowboy. Golly bob howdy! Woody, I'm slipping! Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this! Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly! Hey, that's not her toy! What's that little gal think she's don'?

You can help take his paws off my pal. I'll give you 50 cents for all this junk. Oh, now, how did this get down here? Hand her the sheriff. Nice and easy. I'm sorry. It's an old family toy. Now just walk away. Wait. The other way. I'll give you 50 bucks for it. 50 bucks ain't bad. It's not for sale. Everything's for sale. Or trade. You like my watch? Sorry. He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom! She showed him! Molly, don't touch that, sweetie. Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car. Hold on. What's up? What is it, Buzz? What's happening? What's he doing? I can't watch! Can someone cover my eyes? He's stealin' Woody! What? He can't take Woody. It's illegal. Where's he going? Do something. Buzz! Get him, Buzz. Where's the red jacket? Why would someone steal Woody? All right. Let's review this one more time. At precisely 8:32ish, Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped. Exhibit B, a composite sketch of the kidnapper. He didn't have a beard like that. Fine. Etch, give him a shave. The kidnapper was bigger than that. Oh, picky, picky, picky. Let's just go straight to Exhibit F. The kidnapper's vehicle. Now, the vehicle fled the scene in this direction. Your eyes are in backwards. It went the other way. Hey. Put a cork in it. How do you spell FBI? My crime scene! Oh, why don't you watch where you're going, Godspilla? Didn't know there was a crime scene. Excuse me. Excuse me. A little quiet, please. Thank you. Lazy toy brain. Lousy try, Brian. What are you doing, Buzz? It's some sort of message encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag. Liz try bran. It's just a license plate. It's just a jumble of letters. Yeah, and there are about 3.5 million registered cars in the tricounty area alone. Lou's thigh burn. Oh, this can't help. Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys. Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on! Al's Toy Barn. Al's Toy Barn! Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit. It's the chicken man! That's our guy. I knew there was something I didn't like about that chicken. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there. And we're gonna do this commercial in one take, do you hear me, because I am in the middle of something really important. You, my little cowboy friend, are gonna make me big buck, buck, bucks. Andy! I can't believe I have to drive all the way to work on a Saturday. All the way to work! What? Whoal! Hey! Stop!

Too late. I'm in the 40s. Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster. Back, back! Stop! And look for the giant chicken! Now, Etch! That's where I need to go. You can't go, Buzz. You'll never make it there. Woody once risked his life to save me. I couldn't call myself his friend if I weren't willing to do the same. So who's with me? I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes and your angry eyes just in case. This is for Woody when you find him. All right, but I don't think it'll mean the same coming from me. Mr. Buzz Lightyear, you just gotta save my pal Woody. I'll do my best, son. Okay, fellas. Let's roll. Geronimo! You'd think with all my video game experience, I'd be feeling more prepared. The idea is to let go. We'll be back before Andy gets home. Don't talk to any toy you don't know! To Al's Toy Barn and beyond! They don't call this the old abandoned mine for nothin', Prospector. I reckon we oughta get outta here. Where's my gold? Hold on. I'll light me a candle. This sure is a fastburnin"" wick. Blast us to smithereens! That there's dynamite! Holy tarnation. I'll call for help. Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody. Now scurry! Good job, Bullseye. ! reckon the new schoolhouse Is finally done. What's that? Jessie and Prospector are trapped in the old abandoned mine, and Prospector just lit a stick of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle, and now they're about to be blown to smithereens? Ride like the wind, Bullseye! You're fannin' the flames, Jessie! It takes brains to put out that fire. My biscuits are burnin'! Will Woody and Bullseye land to safety? Can they reach Jessie and Stinky Pete in time? Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion, ""Woody's Finest Hour."" All right! All right! Next tape! Hey, wait. What happened? What happens next? Come on! Let's see the next episode! That's it. What? The show was canceled after that. Wait. What about the gold mine and the cute little critters and the dynamite? That was a great show! I mean, why cancel it? Two words, Sputnik. Once the astronauts went up, children only wanted to play with space toys. I know how that feels. But, still, my own show. I mean, look at all this stuff! Didn't you know? Why, you're valuable property! I wish the guys could see this. Heyhowdyhey. That's me. I'm on a yoyo. Oh, hey. Nice teeth. And yet still a goodlookin' guy. Oh, it's a bank! Cool. What do you do? You push the hat, and out... Oh, out come bubbles. Clever. Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do? I get it. ""There's a snake in my boot."" Oh, hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long! A record player! I haven't seen one of these in ages. Okay, now. Slow. Oh, that's funny, Bullseye. Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast! Not bad. It's time for Woody's Roundup He's the very best He's the rootin'est tootinest cowboy... Look at us! We're a complete set! Now it's on to the museum. Museum? What museum? THE museum. We're being sold to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo. That's in Japan! Japan? No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan. What do you mean? I got to get back home to my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See? He still has an owner. Oh, my goodness. No. Can't go. I can't do storage again. I just can't! Jessie. Jessie. I won't go back in the dark! What's the matter? What's wrong with her? Well, we've been in storage for a long time waiting for you. Why me? The museum's only interested in the collection if you're in it, Woody. Without you, we go back into storage. It's that simple. It's not fair! How can you do this to us? Hey, look. I'm sorry, but this is all a big mistake. You see, I was in this yard sale... Yard sale? Why were you in a yard sale if you have an owner? Well, I wasn't supposed to be there. I was trying to save another toy when... Was it because you're damaged? Did this Andy break you? Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no! It was... It was an accident. I mean... Sounds like he really loves you. It's not like that, okay? And I'm not going to any museum! Well, I'm not going back into storage! Al's coming! Go! Go on, Jessie. Jessie, look at me. I promise you'll come out of the box. Now go! Go! It's show time! Oh, money, baby. Money, money, money. And now the main attraction. No! His arm! Where's his arm? No. No, no, no, no! What am I gonna do? I know. I know. Come on! Come on! Come on! Pick up the phone! Hello? It's me. It's Al I got an emergency. I'm busy. Yes, we're all busy. Look. It has to be tonight. All right. All right. But first thing in the morning. It's gone! I can't believe it! My arm is completely gone! All right. Come here. Let me see that. Oh, it's just a popped seam, easily repaired. You should consider yourself lucky. Lucky? Are you shrinkwrapped? I am missing my arm! Big deal. Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy is dying to play with a onearmed cowboy doll. Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last an hour on the streets in his condition. It's a dangerous world out there for a toy. All right. Nobody look till I get my cork back in. Good work, men. Two blocks down and only 19 more to go. What? Nineteen? Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me. Come on, fellas. Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket? No. No. And did he give up when you threw him out of the back of that moving van? Oh, you had to bring that up. No, he didn't! We have a friend in need, and we will not rest until he's safe in Andy's room! Now let's move out! And that concludes our broadcast day. Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go. Come on. You don't wanna help me. I'm the bad guy. You're gonna go back in storage because of me, remember? Just go. Bullseye... All right. All right. But you have got to keep quiet. Come on. Over here. Attaboy. Okay, Bullseye. Upsydaisy. Bullseye. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Woody's Roundup Come on, it's time to play No, Officer! I swear. What? Get in there. There you go. Cheap case. Where is the remote? Where is the remote? Why don't I put it in the same place every... Oh, here it is. What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry I can't help you guys out. Really, I am. But you didn't have to go and pull a stunt like that. What? You think I did that? Oh, right, right. The TV just happened to turn on, and the remote magically ended up in front of you! You calling me a liar? Well, if the boot fits... Say that again. If the boot fits. Okay, cowboy. How do you like that? Take it back! Take it back! Don't think just 'cause you're a girl, I'm gonna take it easy on you. Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once. I don't know how that television turned on, but fighting about it isn't helping anything. If I had both my arms... The fact is, you don't, Woody, so I suggest you just wait until morning. The cleaner will come, fix your arm... And then I'm outta here! Oh, no, no. Bullseye, don't take it that way. It's just that Andy... Andy, Andy, Andy. That's all he ever talks about. Hey, Buzz, can we slow down? May I remind you that some of us are carrying over $6 in change? Losing health units. Must rest. Is everyone present and accounted for? Not quite everyone. Who's behind? Mine. Hey, guys. Why do the toys cross the road? Not now, Hamm. Oh, I love riddles. Why? To get to the chicken on the other side! The chicken! Oh, well. We tried. We'll have to cross. What the... You're not turning me into @ mashed potato. I may not be a smart dog, but I know what roadkill is. There must be a safe way. Okay. Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go. Drop! Go! Drop! I said ""drop""! Go! Drop. Go. That went well. Good job, troops. We're that much closer to Woody. Oh, thank goodness you're here. Is the specimen ready for cleaning? So, how long is this gonna take? You can't rush art. Oh, no. It's closed. We're not preschool toys, Slinky. We can read. Hey, Joe, you're late. We've got a ton of toys to unload. All right. All right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'. All right. Let's go. But the sign says it's closed. No, no, no, no. All together. Now! Whoa, Nelly! How are we going to find Woody in this place? Look for Al. We find Al, we find Woody. Now move out! Woody? Woody. There you go. He's for display only. You handle him too much, he's not gonna last. It's amazing. You're a genius. He's just like new. Wow. I could use one of those. You know, they make it so you can't defeat Zurg unless you buy this book. It's extortion. That's what it is. Hey, I always thought the golden sector was the only... I thought we could search in style. Nice going there, Hamm. So how about letting a toy with fingers drive? Am I really that fat? What are you doing? You're in direct violation of Code 6404 .5, stating all Space Rangers are to be in hypersleep until awakened by authorized personnel. Oh, no. You're breakin' ranks, Ranger. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. I've got an AWOL Space Ranger. Tell me I wasn't this deluded. No back talk! I have a laser, and I will use it. Mean the laser that's a light bulb? Has your mind been melded? You could've killed me, Space Ranger. Or should I say ""traitor""? I don't have time for this. Halt! I order you to halt! Listen to me. Listen. Wait. We've been down this aisle already. We've never been down this aisle. It's pink. Face it. We're lost. Back it up. Back it up. What a great party! How low can you go? How low can you go? Excuse me, ladies. Does anyone know where we might find the Al of Al's Toy Barn? I can help. I'm Tour Guide Barbie. Please keep your hands, arms and accessories inside the car, and no flash photography. Thank you. I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud. Then make room for the single fellas. To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle. Developed in 1967, the original series had 16 cars, including the Corvette. I beg your pardon, ma'am, but where's Al's office? Please hold all questions until the end of the tour. Thank you. It says how you defeat Zurg! Look! Excuse me, sir. Get this outta here, geekosaur. Look out! Stop, stop, stop! Turn into the spin, Barbie! My source of power! No! Come back! Hey! Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down! Dinosaur overboard! Slow down! Remain seated, please. Listen to me. Listen to me. You're not really a Space Ranger. You're a toy. We're all toys. Do you hear me? Well, that should hold you till the court martial. Let me go! You don't realize what you're doing! And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle. In 1995, shortsighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand. Hey, Buzz! Halt! Who goes there? Quit clownin' around and get in the car! Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg! You do? Come on. I'll tell you on the way. No, no, guys! You've got the wrong Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz! Say, where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz? Well, slotted pig, they're standard issue. No! It's like printing my own money. Yeah? What? Mr. Konishi. Yes, I have the pictures right here. In fact, I'm in the car right now on my way to the office to fax them to you. I'm going through a tunnel! I'm breakin' up! Oh, wow! Will you look at me? It's like I'm fresh out of the box! Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna have a hard time rippin' this! Hello! Hi! Hello! Great. Now you can go. Well, what a good idea. Woody, don't be mad at Jessie. She's been through more than you know. Why not make amends before you leave, huh? It's the least you can do. All right. But I don't know what good it'll do. Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here? Thought I'd get one last look at the sun before I get packed away again. Look, Jessie. I know you hate me for leaving, but I have to go back. I'm still Andy's toy. Well, if you knew him, you'd understand. Andy's a real... Let me guess. Andy's a real special kid. And to him, you're his buddy, his best friend. And when Andy plays with you, it's like even though you're not moving, you feel like you're alive, because that's how he sees you. How did you know that? Because Emily was just the same. She was my whole world. When somebody loved me Everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together Lives within my heart And when she was sad ! was there to dry her tears And when she was happy, so was I When she loved me Through the Summer and the Fall We had each other That was all Just she and I together Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely ! was there to comfort her And I knew that She loved me So the years went by I stayed the same But she began to drift away ! was left alone Still I waited for the day When she'd say ! will always love you Lonely and forgotten I never thought she'd look my way She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do Like she loved me When she loved me When somebody loved me Everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together Lives within my heart When she loved me You never forget kids like Emily or Andy. But they forget you. Jessie, I didn't know. Just go. How long will it last, Woody? Do you really think Andy is gonna take you to college or on his honeymoon? Andy's growing up, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's your choice, Woody. You can go back, or you can stay with us and last forever. You'll be adored by children for generations. Who am I to break up the Roundup gang? Hey, Woody, are you in here? Nah. This one's empty too. Woody! Woody! Woody! Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm? Why, no, I haven't. Hey! He was talkin' to me! No! He was talkin' to me! Why, you... You see, all along, we thought the way into Zurg's fortress was through the main gate, but in fact the secret entrance is to the left, hidden in the shadows. To the left in the shadows. Got it. Someone's coming. Everyone, take cover. It was a big pileup, but I don't want to bore you with the details. Yes. Now, let me confirm your fax number. 011. Wait. That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it. It's him. The chicken man. Funny, he doesn't look like poultry. That's the kidnapper, all right. A kidnapper! An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one. And the piece de rÃ©sistance!  I promise the collection will be the crown jewel of your museum. It's Woody! Now that I have your attention, imagine we added another zero to the price, huh? I'll pay anything you want. Yes! Yes! You got a deal! I'll be on the next flight to Japan! Quick. Into the poultry man's cargo unit. He'll lead us to Zurg. Move, move, move! Don't touch my moustache! Rich, rich, rich, rich! Destroy Buzz Lightyear. Destroy Buzz Lightyear. Destroy Buzz Lightyear. He didn't take the bag! No time to lose! He's ascending in the vertical transporter. All right, everyone. Hang on. We're gonna blast through the roof. Buzz? To infinity and beyond! What are you? Insane? We're wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla. I don't understand. Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry. Blast. He's on level 23. How are we gonna get up there? Maybe if we find some balloons, we could float to the top. Are you kidding? I say we stack ourselves up, push the intercom and pretend we're delivering a pizza. How about a ham sandwich with fries and a hot dog? What about me? You can be the toy that comes with the meal. Troops! Over here. Just like you said, lizard man. ""In the shadows to the left."" Okay. Let's move! Mission log. Have infiltrated enemy territory without detection and are making our way through the bowels of Zurg's fortress. You know, I think that Buzz aisle went to his head. Oh, no. Which way do we go? This way! What makes you so sure? I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure. We've been detected. The walls! They're closing in! Quick! Help me prop up vegetable man, or we're done for. Hey! Put me down, you moron! Guys, look! It's not the walls! It's the elevator! Come on. We've got no time to lose. Everyone, grab hold! What? Buzz, why not just take the elevator? They'll be expecting that. Hey, Buzz! Stop! Slow down! To overnight six packages to Japan is how much? That's in yen, right? Dollars? You are deliberately taking advantage of people in a hurry, you know that? All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine. I'll have the stuff in the lobby, and you'd better be here in 15 minutes, because I have a plane to catch, do you hear me? We're finally going. Can you believe it? That's customfitted foam insulation you'll be riding in, Bullseye. First class all the way! You know what? I'm actually excited about this. I mean it. I really am! And why shouldn't you be? Yeehaw! Swing your partner dosido Look at you, dancing cowboy! Look! I'm doin' the box step! Hey, heads up down there! Whoal! Pork bellies are fallin'. Hey, how much farther, Buzz? Halfway there. My arms can't hold on much longer! Too heavy. What was I thinking? My antigravity servos! Hang tight, everyone. I'm going to let go of the wall. What? He wouldn't. One... He would. Two... Three! To infinity and beyond! Approaching destination. Reengaging gravity. Area secure. It's okay, troops. The antigravity sickness will wear off momentarily. Now let's move! Remind me to glue his helmet shut when we get back. How 'bout givin' me a little intro there, Jessie? Introducing the highridin'est cowboy around... You forgot ""rootin'tootin'est""! The highridin'est, rootin'tootin'est cowboy hero of all time, Sheriff Woody! Say, little missy, you notice any trouble around these parts? Nary a bit, not with Sheriff Woody around. Wait, wait, wait! I got it! This is great! Okay! The bandits got the critters tied up in the burning barn. Now the best part! Help us! The barn's on fire! I've got ya, critters. No need to worry. Woody saves the day again! Yeehaw! Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye? I have to ride off into the sunset... Ride like the wind, Bullseye! Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay? Oh, you are? No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it. No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop! Mission log. Have reached Zurg's command deck, but no sign of him or his wooden captive. Please, no! That's Woody! This way! Please, please, no! Buzz, can you see? What's going on? Take that! To the left. No, your left. Take it up higher. What's happening? Oh, it's horrible. They... They're torturing him. What are we gonna do, Buzz? Use your head! But I don't wanna use my head! What's going on here? Buzz, guys! Hey, how did you find me? Watch yourself! We're here to spring ya, Woody! You heard of kung fu? Well, get ready for pork chop. Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes! Hold it, now! Hey, you don't understand! These are my friends! Yeah, we're his friends! No, Rex, I mean they're my friends! Hey, stop it! Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey! Grab Woody, and let's go! Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down! Quick! To the vent! They're stealing him. No! Hold it right there! Buzz? You again? Thank goodness you're all right. Buzz, what is going on? Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear, and I'm in charge of this detachment. No, I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm Buzz Lightyear! I'm Buzz Lightyear! So, who's the real Buzz? I am! Don't let this impostor fool you! He's been trained by Zurg himself to mimic my every move. Buzz! I had a feelin' it was you. My front end just had to catch up with my back end. Will somebody please explain what's going on? It's all right, Space Ranger. It's a code 546. You mean it's a... Yes. And he's a... Oh, yeah. Your Majesty. Woody, you're in danger here. We need to leave now. Al's selling you to a toy museum in Japan! I know. It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go. What? Are you crazy? Look, the thing is, I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll, and these guys are my Roundup gang. What are you talking about? Woody's Roundup! On, it's this great old TV show, and I was the star. See? Now look. Look! Look at me! See? That's me! This is weirdin' me out. Buzz, it was a national phenomenon. There was all this merchandise that got packed up. You should have seen it. There was a record player and a yoyo. Buzz, I was a yoyo! ""Was""? Stop this nonsense and let's go. Nah, Buzz. I can't go. I can't abandon these guys. They need me to get into this museum. Without me, they'll go back into storage. Maybe forever! Woody, you're not a collector's item. You're a child's plaything. You are a toy! For how much longer? One more rip, and Andy's done with me. And what do I do then, Buzz? You tell me. Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who taught me that life's only worth living if you're bein' loved by a kid. And I traveled all this way to rescue that toy because I believed him. Well, you wasted your time. Let's go, everyone. What about Woody? He's not coming with us. But... But Andy's coming home tonight. Then we'd better make sure we're there waiting for him. I don't have a choice, Buzz. This is my only chance. To do what, Woody? Watch kids from behind glass and never be loved again? Some life. Is everybody okay? Sheriff Woody! Knew you'd make it! Now, remember, deputies, the real treasures are your friends and family. Before I go, kids, I want to share somethin' special with you, for the times I'm not around. Good going, Woody! I thought they'd never leave. You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me Woody? You've got troubles Well, I've got ""em too There isn't anything ! wouldn't do for you We stick together and see it through 'Cause you've got a friend in me Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am Bigger and stronger too Maybe But none of them will ever love you The way I do It's me and you, boy And as the years go by Our friendship will never die You're gonna see it's our destiny What am I doing? Buzz! Wait! Wait! Woody, where are you going? You're right, Prospector. I can't stop Andy from growing up. But I wouldn't miss it for the world. No! Buzz! Yes? Yes? I'm coming with you! Wait, wait, wait. I'll be back in just a second. Way to go, cowboy! Hey, you guys... Come with me. What? Andy will play with all of us. I know it! Woody, I don't know. I... Wouldn't you give anything just to have one more day with Emily? Come on, Jessie. This is what it's all about, to make a child happy. And you know it. Bullseye, are you with me? Okay, good boy. Prospector, how 'bout you? Prospector? You're outta your box! I tried reasoning with you, Woody, but you keep forcing me to take extreme measures. Wait a minute. You turned on the TV last night, not Jessie. Look, we have an eternity to spend together in the museum. Let's not start off by pointing fingers, shall we? You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you? Prospector, this isn't fair. ""Fair""? I'll tell you what's not fair. Spending a lifetime on a dimestore shelf watching every other toy be sold. Well, finally my waiting has paid off, and no handmedown cowboy doll is gonna mess it up for me now! Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys! It's too late, Woody. That silly Buzz Lightweight can't help you. His name is Buzz Lightyear. Whatever. I've always hated those upstart space toys. It's stuck! What do we do? Should I use my head? It's All Look at the time. I'm gonna be late! Figures. I can't miss this flight! I've gotta pack. All right. Let's see. Wallet, keys, tickets, passport, beef jerky, very expensive over there. Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower. I just gotta get outta here now! Quick! To the elevator! Hurry. I can hear it coming. So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time. It's Zurg! Watch out! He's got an ion blaster! Quick! Get on! The emergency hatch! Come on! Come on! Hurry! But Buzz is in peril! Buzz Buzz Buzz... Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won. I'll never give in. You killed my father! No, Buzz. I AM your father. No! Come on! Come on! Come on! Buzz, you could have defeated Zurg all along! You just need to believe in yourself! Prepare to die! I can't look! Whoa!  I did it. I finally defeated Zurg! Father. Finally! How are we gonna get him now? Pizza, anyone? Go, go, go! I got it! Buzz, are you coming? No, I have a lot of catching up to do with my dad. Good throw, son. That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy! Oh, you're a great dad. Farewell. Does anyone know how to drive? Slink, take the pedals. Rex, you navigate. Hamm and Potato, operate the levers and knobs. Whoa.

Guys, we can't park here! It's a white zone! You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful. Final boarding call... There he is! For Far East Airlines flight 451 to Tokyo. All confirmed passengers with boarding passes must board at this time. Passenger Twitch, passenger Leon Twitch, please pick up... You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful. Will you leave me alone? Someone's coming! A puppy! Bark, bark, bark, bark. Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. Listen, fly boy. The contents of that case are worth more than you make in a year! You got that, sport? You be careful! I understand, sir. Do you have a ""fragile"" sticker or something? I had a box of cookies once that came back as crumbs! The Mystic Portal! Once we go through, we just need to find that case. There's the case! No, there's the case! You take that one! We'll take this one! Whoa! Buzz! Buzz, my back end's goin' to Baton Rouge! Slinky! Here we come, Woody! Woody, here we come! Woody! Nice flash, though. Okay, Woody, let's go! Take that, space toy. Hey! No one does that to my friend! Your choice, Woody. You can go to Japan together or in pieces. If he fixed ya once, he can fix ya again. Now get in the box! Never! Fine!  No! Gotcha! Idiots! Children destroy toys! You'll all be ruined, forgotten! Spending eternity rotting in some landfill! Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you learned the true meaning of playtime. Right over there, guys! No. No! No! Atlantic Air flight 810 from Point Richmond is now arriving at Gate 3. Look, Barbie. A big, ugly man doll. He needs a makeover. Hi! You'll like Amy. She's an artist! Come on, hon!

I wanted to say you're a bright young woman with a beautiful ""yarnful"" of hair. ""Hairful"" of yarn. It's... I must go. Well, aren't you the sweetest space toy I ever met? What's that? Bark, bark? This fella says he needs to go out back for a little private time. That critter needs help! Hey, Rex, I could use a hand over here, buddy. I don't need to play. I've lived it! No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts! Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.  We've got the lowest prices in town. Everything for a buck, buck, buck. Well, I guess crime doesn't pay. Oh, Andy did a great job, huh? Nice and strong!

Wheezy, you're fixed! Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy box and found me an extra squeaker. And how do you feel? Oh, I feel swell. In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on. You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You just remember what your old pal said Babe, you've got a friend in me Yeah, you've got a friend in me Come on over. Oh, you are such a big girl.

One minor note here. Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.  Wait a minute here! What do you mean the party's today? His birthday's not 'til next week! What's goin' on down there? Is his mom losin' her marbles? Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried. Of course Woody ain't worried. He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten. Hey, hey. Come on, Potato Head. If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me. Woody has never steered us wrong before. Come on, guys. Every Christmas and birthday we go through this. But what if Andy gets another dinosaur, a mean one? I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection! Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about. It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for, right? Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here! Birthday guests at three o'clock! Stay calm, everyone! Hey! Meeting adjourned. Ho, boy! Will you take a look at all those presents? I can't see a thing. Yes, sir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure. Any dinosaurshaped ones? Oh, for crying out loud.

Come in, Mother Bird! Come in, Mother Bird! Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet. Andy's opening it. He's really excited about this one. Mom, what is it? It's a huge package.

Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear? Out of my way! Here I come! Here I come! Hey, look, its lasers light up. Take that, Zurg! Quick, make a space. This is where the spaceship lands. And he does it like that. And he does a karate chop action! Come on down, guys! It's time for games! We've got prizes! What is it? Can you see it? What the heck is up there? Woody, who's up there with ya? Woody? What are you doing under the bed? Nothin'. Nothin'. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake! Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody. Have you been replaced? What did I tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced. Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy'sroom welcome. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. Star Command, come in. Do you read me? Why don't they answer? My ship! Blast! This'll take weeks to repair. Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4072. My ship has run off course en route to sector 12. I've crashlanded on a strange planet. The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep. Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet if the air is breathable. And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. Hello! Whoa! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody. And this is Andy's room. That's all I wanted to say. And also, there has been a bit of a mixup. This is my spot, see, the bed here. Local law enforcement. It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crashlanded here by mistake. Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot. I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuel, or have you discovered crystallic fusion? Well, let's see. We got doubleA's. Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there? Don't shoot! It's okay. Friends. Do you know these lifeforms? Yes! They're Andy's toys. All right, everyone, you're clear to come up. I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace. Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur! Whwhy, thank you! Now, thank you all for your kind welcome! Say, what's that button do? I'll show you. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Hey, Woody's got something like that. His is a pull string. Only it's... Only it sounds like a car ran over it. Oh, yeah, but not like this. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong? Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. Oh, really? I'm from Playskool. And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not really from Mattel. I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout. You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before. Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife. Please be careful. You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off. Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody? It's not a laser! It's a... It's a little light bulb that blinks. What's with him? Laser envy. All right, that's enough! Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy. Toy? TOY. Toy!  Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is ""Space Ranger."" The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present. Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya? Mr. Lightyear, now, I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do? He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly! Excuse me. Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good! Oh, what? What? These are plastic. He can't fly! They are a terilliumcarbonic alloy, and I can fly. No, you can't. Yes, I can. You can't. Can. Can't. Can't. Can't! I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it. All right, then, I will. Stand back, everyone! To infinity and beyond! Can! Whoal! Oh, wow, you flew magnificently! I found my movin' buddy. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. That wasn't flying! That was... falling with style. Man, the dolls must really go for you. Can you teach me that? Golly bob howdy! Oh, shut up! You know, in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see. They'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy. I was on top of the world livin' high It was right in my pocket ! was livin"" the life Things were just the way they should be When from out of the sky like a bomb Comes some little punk in a rocket Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Strange Things are happening to me Strange Things Strange things are happening to me Ain't no doubt about it ! had friends ! had lots of friends Now all my friends are gone And I'm doin' the best I can To carry on had power Power I was respected Respected But not anymore And I've lost the love of the one Whom I adore Let me tell you 'bout it Strange Things are happenin'to me Strange Things Strange Things are happenin'to me Ain't no doubt about it Strange Things Strange Things Finally! Hey, who's got my hat? Look, I'm Woody! Howdy, howdy, howdy! Gimme that! Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something. It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture. Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me. Wow! With permanent ink too! Well, I must get back to repairing my ship. Don't let it get to you, Woody. Let what? I don't... What do you mean? Who? I know Andy's excited about Buzz. But you know he'll always have a special place for you. Yeah, like the attic. All right, that's it! Unidirectional bonding strip. Mr. Lightyear wants more tape. Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me. What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip? And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing! It's getting on my nerves! Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command? Okay! Well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh? Don't even think about it, cowboy. Oh, yeah, tough guy? The air isn't... toxic. How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets! You actually think you're the Buzz Lightyear? Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys, look! It's the real Buzz Lightyear! You're mocking me, aren't you? Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Buzz, look, an alien! Where? Yes! It's Sid! Don't move! I thought he was at summer camp. They must've kicked him out early this year. Oh, no, not Sid! Incoming! Who is it this time? I... I can't... I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny? Right here, Woody. Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again. Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl. What's going on? Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys. I'd better take a look anyway. Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? That's why, Sid. Sure is a hairy fellow. No, no, that's Scud, you idiot. That is Sid. You mean that happy child? That ain't no happy child. He tortures toys, just for fun! Well, then we've got to do something. What are you doing? Get down from there! I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson. Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser. Be careful with that! It's extremely dangerous. He's lighting it! He's lighting it! Hit the dirt! Look out! Yes! He's gone! He's history! I could've stopped him. Buzz, I would love to see you try. Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater. The sooner we move, the better. Yeah! To infinity and beyond! All this packing makes me hungry. What would you say to dinner at, oh, Pizza Planet? Pizza Planet? Oh, cool! Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready. Can I bring some toys? You can bring one toy. Just one? One toy? Will Andy pick me? ""Don't count on it""? Buzz! Oh, Buzz! Buzz Lightyear. Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness. We've got trouble! Trouble? Where? Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy, it's... it's trapped, Buzz! Then we've no time to lose. I don't see anything! Oh, he's there! Just, just keep looking! What kind of toy... Buzz! Buzz! I don't see him in the driveway. I think he bounced into Sid's yard! Oh! Buzz! Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to say something. What is it, boy? He's saying that this was no accident. What do you mean? I mean HumptyDumpty was pushed... No! By Woody! What? Wait a minute. You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you? Potato Head? That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you backstabbing murderer! Now, it was an accident, guys. Come on. Now, you, you gotta believe me. We believe ya, Woody. Right, Rex? Well, ye... N... I don't like confrontations! Where is your honor, dirt bag? You are an absolute disgrace! You don't deserve to... Hey! You couldn't handle Buzz cutting in on your playtime, could you, Woody? Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy. So you got rid of him. Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh? You gonna knock me outta the window too? I don't think we should give him the chance. There he is, men. Frag him! Let's string him up by his pull string! I got dibs on his hat! Would you boys stop it! Tackle him! No, no, no! Wait! I can explain everything! Okay, Mom, be right down. I've gotta get Buzz. Retreat! Mom, do you know where Buzz is? No, I haven't seen him. Andy, I'm heading out the door! But, Mom, I can't find him! Honey, just grab some other toy. Now, come on! Oh, okay. I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there. Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him. It's too short! We need more monkeys! There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel! Buzz, the monkeys aren't working! We're formulating another plan! Stay calm! Oh, where could he be? Can I help pump the gas? Sure! I'll even let you drive. Yeah? Yeah, when you're 16. Funny, Mom. Great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident? Buzz! Buzz! Ha! You're alive! This is great! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved. Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake. Huh? Right? Buddy? I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet. Oh. Well, that's good. But we're not on my planet, are we? No. Okay, come on! You want a piece of me? Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear to the rescue. Next stop. Pizza Planet! Yeah! Andy! Wh... Doesn't he realize that I'm not there? I'm lost! Oh, I'm a lost toy! Buzz Lightyear mission log. The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort. Youl According to my navicomputer, the... Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot! Sheriff, this is no time to panic. This is the perfect time to panic. I'm lost. Andy is gone. They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault! My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place... Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me... Don't talk to me about importance! Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy! What? What are you talkin' about? Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet! I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command! You... are... a... toy! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear! You're a... You're an action figure! You are a child's plaything! You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell. Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony! ""Rendezvous with Star Command."" Hey, gas dude! You talkin' to me? Yeah, man. Can you help me? Pizza Planet? Andy! Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is? Oh, no! I can't show my face in that room without Buzz. Buzz! Buzz, come back! Go away! No! Buzz, you gotta come back! ll... I found a spaceship! It's a spaceship, Buzz! Come on, man, hurry up! Like, the pizzas are getting cold here! Cutting Boulevard, huh? Yeah, yeah. Which way? Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home. Well, then, let's climb aboard. No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz! Let's get in the back. No one will see us there. Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit. Yeah, bu... Buzz! Buzz! That's two lefts and a right, huh? Thanks for the directions, okay? Yeah. And remember, kid... Buzz! It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot. Next shuttle liftoff is scheduled for Tminus 30 minutes and counting. You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. The white zone is for immediate pizza... Sheriff! There you are. Now, the entrance is heavily guarded. We need a way to get inside. Great idea, Woody. I like your thinkin'. You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. Now! Quickly, Sheriff! The air lock is closing. Jones, party of five, your shuttle is now boarding... Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens? Watch where you're going! Sorry. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. What a spaceport! Good work, Woody. Mom, can I play Black Hole? Please, please, please? Andy! Now, we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12. Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way. There's a special ship. I just saw it. You mean it has hyperdrive? Hyperactive hyperdrive. And Astro... turf! Where is it? I don't see the... Come on. That's it. Spaceship! All right, Buzz, get ready. And... And the universe explodes! Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket. Buzz! No! Mom, if I eat all my pizza, can I have some alien slime? This cannot be happening to me. A stranger. From the outside. Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace. Before your space journey, reenergize yourself with a slice of pepperoni, now boarding at counter three. This is an intergalactic emergency. I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12. Who's in charge here? The claw! The claw is our master. The claw chooses who will go and who will stay. This is ludicrous. Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there? Take that! Oh, no! Sid! Get down! What's gotten into you? I was... You are the one that decided to climb into this... The claw, it moves. I have been chosen! Farewell, my friends. I go on to a better place. Gotchal! A Buzz Lightyear? No way! Yes! Buzz! No! Hey! He has been chosen! He must go. Hey! What are you doing? Do not fight the claw. Stop it! Stop it, you zealots! All right! Double prizes! Let's go home and... play. Sheriff, I can see your dwelling from here. You're almost home. Nirvana is coming. The mystic portal awaits. Will you be quiet? You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out. Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy! Sit! Good boy. Hey, I got something for you, boy. Freeze! Ready, set, now! Hannah! Hey, Hannah! What? Did I get my package in the mail? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know! Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie! What? Hey! She's sick! No, she's not! I'll have to perform one of my operations. No! No, not Sid's room. Not there. Hey, give her back! Sid! Sid! Oh, no, we have a sick patient here, nurse. Prepare the OR, stat! Patient is... prepped. No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before. Now for the tricky part. Pliers! I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school. Doctor, you've done it! Hannah! Janie's all better now. Mom! Mom! She's lying! Whatever she says, it's not true! We are gonna die. I'm outta here! Locked. There's gotta be another way outta here. Buzz? Was that you? Hey, hi there, little fella. Come out here. Do you know a way outta here? Buzz! They're cannibals. Mayday, mayday. Come in, Star Command. Send reinforcements. Star Command, do you copy? I've set my laser from stun to Kill. Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death. Hey, you guys, I think I found him! Buzz, is that you? Whiskers, will you get outta here! You're interfering with the search and rescue! Look, they're home. Mom, have you seen Woody? Where was the last place you left him? Right here in the van. Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough. He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone. Woody's gone? Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away. Huh? Huh? I told you he was guilty. Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities? Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay. Oh, a survivor. Where's the rebel base? Talk! I can see your will is strong. Well, we have ways of making you talk. Where are your rebel friends now? Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready! All right! Are you all right? I'm proud of you, Sheriff. A lesser man would've talked under such torture. I sure hope this isn't permanent. Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the space port. The door. It's open! We're free! Woody, we don't know what's out there! I'll tell you what? They're gonna eat us, Buzz! Do something quick! Shield your eyes. It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for...

I can't even fly out of a window. The hat looked good? Tell me the hat looked good. The apron is a bit much. ""Out the window""! Buzz, you're a genius! Come on, come on. This way. Years of academy, training, wasted! B3. Miss! G6. You sunk it. Are you peeking? Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up. No, no, not the ear. Give me the nose. Come on. How about three out of five?

I hope Sid pulls your voice box out, ya creep. No, no! No, no! Don't leave! Don't leave! Ya gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here! Come on. Let's get outta here. Go back to your lives, citizens. Show's over. Come back! Slink! Slink! Please! Please! Listen to me!  No! No! Come back! Slinky! Buzz! Go away! You disgusting freaks! All right, back! Back, you cannibals! He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters! What are you don'?  Hey. Hey, they fixed you. But they're cannibals. We saw them eat those other toys. Sorry. I thought that you were gonna... You know, you know, eat my friend. Hey, no, no, wait, hey! What's wrong? Sid? Not now, Mom! I'm busy! Sid! Buzz, come on! You left that door open. Get up! Use your legs! Fine! Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me! It came! It finally came! ""The Big One."" ""Extremely dangerous. ""Keep out of reach of children."" Cool! What am I gonna blow? Man. Hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll? Yes. I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit. Now. Yes. Oh, no! Oh, man! Sid Phillips reporting. Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site. Tomorrow's forecast, sunny. Sweet dreams. I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat. But what if we leave them behind? Oh, don't worry, honey. I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow. I need air! Will you quit movin' around? I'm sorry. It's just that I get... l get so nervous before I travel. How did I get stuck with you as a moving buddy? Everyone else was picked. Oh, Woody. If only you could see how much Andy misses you. Hey, Buzz! Hey. Get over here and see if you can get this toolbox off me. Oh, come on, Buzz, ll... Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help. I can't help. I can't help anyone. Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me outta here. Then  we'll make a break for Andy's house. Andy's house, Sid's house. What's the difference? Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly. No, Woody. For the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy, a stupid, little, insignificant toy. Whoa, hey, wait a minute. Bein' a toy is a lot better than bein' a, a Space Ranger. Yeah, right. No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest. And it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal. It's because you're a toy. You are his toy. But why would Andy want me? Why would Andy want you? Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings. You glow in the dark. You talk! Your helmet does that, that, that whoosh thing. You are a cool toy. As a matter of fact, you're too cool. I mean, I mean, what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure? All ll can do is... There's a snake in my boots. Why would Andy ever want to play with me when he's got you? I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket. Listen, Buzz, forget about me. You should get outta here while you can. Buzz? What are you doin'? I thought you were... Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing. Yes, sir!  Come on, Buzz. We can do it. Woody, it's the moving van. We gotta get outta here now. Come on, Buzz. All right. Hey, I'm out! Almost there. I want to ride the pony. Woody? Woody? Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm okay. Oh, yeah! Time for liftoff! To infinity and beyond! Back, back. Down, down! Okay, what do I do? Come on, Woody. Think. Guys! No, no, no, no! Wait! Wait. Listen, please. There's a good toy down there, and he's gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes. All because of me. We gotta save him. And... But I need your help. Please. He's my friend. And he's the only one I've got. Thank you. Okay, I think I know what to do. We're gonna have to break a few rules. But if it works, it'll help everybody. Houston to Mission Control. Come in, Control. Launch pad is being constructed. All right, listen up. I need Pump Boy here, Ducky here. Legs, you're with Ducky. RollerBob and I don't move 'til we get the signal. Clear? Okay. Let's move! Wind the frog. Wait for the signal. Go! All right, let's go! I'll get it! Now! I'm coming. I'm coming. Scud! Stupid dog. Lean back! Mission Control, is the launch pad construction complete? Roger. Rocket is now secured to guide wire. We are currently obtaining the ignition sticks. Countdown will commence momentarily. Stand by. Let's go. Hey, Ma! Where are the matches? Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind. Woody! Great! Help me outta this thing. What? It's okay. Everything's under control. Woody, what are you doing? Houston. All systems are go. Requesting permission to launch... Hey? How'd you get out here? Oh, well. You and I can have a cookout later. Houston, do we have permission to launch? Roger. Permission granted. You are confirmed at ""T"" minus ten seconds. And counting. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Reach for the sky! This town ain't big enough for the two of us. What? Somebody's poisoned the water hole.  It's busted. Who are you callin' busted, buster? That's right. I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips. We don't like bein' blown up, Sid, or smashed or ripped apart. _llWell? That's right! Your toys! Mamal Mamal Mama! Mama!  Mamal From now on, you must take good care of your toys! Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid. We toys can see everything. So play nice. We did it! We did it! Yes! The toys! The toys are alive! Nice toy. What's wrong, Sid? Don't you want to play with Sally? Nice work, fellows. Good job. Comin' out of the ground, what a touch. That was a stroke of genius. Woody. Thanks. Everybody say, ""Bye, house!"" Woody! The van! Bye, house. We gotta run! Thanks, guys! Quick! Just go. I'll catch up. Come on! You can do it, Woody! I got it! I made it. Get away, you stupid dog! Down! Down! Hold on, Woody! I can't do it. Take care of Andy for me! No! Buzz! Are we there already? Woody? How did you...? How'd he get here? Where have you...? What happened? What's goin' on? What's he takin'? There you are! Hey. What's he doing? He's at it again! Get him! Come on! No, no! No, no, no, no! Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoal! Pig pile! Get outta that car! Move it! No! Please! You don't understand! Buzz is out there. We gotta help him. No! Toss him overboard! No, no, no! Wait! Hooray! So long, Woody! Oh! Woody! Oh! Well, thanks for the ride. Look out! Now let's catch up to that truck. Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C. What? And Buzz is with him! It is Buzz! Woody was telling the truth. What have we done? Great! Now I have guilt. We're almost there! Rocky, the ramp! Look out! Quick! Hold onto my tail! Attaboy, Slink! Oh! Woody! Woody! Speed up! Speed up! The batteries! They're runnin' out! I can't hold on much longer. Slink! Hang on! Great! Woody! The rocket! The match! Yes! Thank you, Sid! No! No, no! No! No! Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! No! Woody! What are you doing? Hold still, Buzz! You did it! Next stop, Andy! Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket. Rockets explode! I should have held on longer. Look! Look! It's Woody and Buzz comin' up fast! Woody! Take cover! This is the part where we blow up! Not today! Hey, Buzz! You're flyin'l This isn't flying. This is falling with style. To infinity and beyond! Buzz, we missed the truck. We're not aiming for the truck. Hey, wow! What? What is it? Woody! Buzz! Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?  Here in the car! See? Now, what'd I tell you? Right where you left 'em. Which one can I open first? Let's let Molly open one. Frankincense, this is Myrrh. Hey, heads up, everybody. It's show time. Whoal! It's time! Oh, Bo. There's got to be a less painful way to get my attention. Merry Christmas, Sheriff. Say, isn't that mistletoe? Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur. Like a leaf eater. That way I could play the dominant predator. Quiet, everyone! Quiet! Molly's first present is Mrs. Potato Head. Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head. Way to go, Idaho! Gee, I'd better shave. Come in, Frankincense. Andy is now opening his first present. It's... Buzz. Buzz Lightyear, you are not worried, are you? I can't quite... Me? No, no. Make out... No. No, no, no, no. A large box... It's... Are you? Now, Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you? Oh, what is it? What is it? Wow! A puppy! You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me When the road looks rough ahead And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed You just remember what your old pal said Boy, you've got a friend in me Yeah, you've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You got troubles And I got 'em too There isn't anything ! wouldn't do for you If we stick together we can see it through 'Cause you've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am Bigger and stronger too Maybe But none of them will ever love you the way I do It's me and you, boy And as the years go by Our friendship will never die You're gonna see it's our destiny You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me"
A Christmas Carol,Disney,2000,2009,Animation,"Yes. Quite dead. As a doornail. Certificate of death, sir. Stop! Back away, praddock. Tuppence is tuppence. Beg your pardon! I say! Delinquents. Newspaper! We're hungry, sir! Please, sir, we're very hungry. Any morsel. We're hungry, sir. Any scraps. We're starving, Please, sir. We're very hungry. Merry Christmas, from his lordship, the mayor! Please, sir. Oh, look. There it is. Oi! Come back here with that! That's our meat! Give it back! That's ours! Come back here! There you are, sir. Thanks. Fresh hot chestnuts. How would you like this one? That's perfect. That's a nice fresh eel. Here is the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Get lost. And under which one is the pea? Boom, boom, boom, boom... Boom! Get out of here. There we are. Watch this now. Merry Christmas, Uncle! God save you. Bah! Humbug! Christmas a humbug? Uncle! You don't mean that. Merry Christmas. What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough. What right have you to be so dismal? You're rich enough. Humbug! Don't be cross, Uncle. What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas. What's Christmastime to you but a time for paying bills without money. A time for finding yourself a year older and not a penny richer. If I could work my will, every idiot who goes about with ""Merry Christmas"" on his lips should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart! Uncle! Nephew! Keep Christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine. Keep it? But you don't keep it! Let me leave it alone then. Much good it has ever done you. There are many things from which I have derived good and have not profited. Christmas being among them. But I have always thought of Christmas as a kind, charitable time. The only time when men open their shutup hearts and think of all people as fellow travelers to the grave and not some other race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, Uncle, although it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe it has done me good, and I say, God bless it! Let me hear another sound out of you, Cratchit, and you'll keep Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker, sir. A wonder you don't go into Parliament. Don't be cross, Uncle. Come, dine with us tomorrow. I'll see you in hell first. But why? Why so coldhearted, Uncle? Why? Why did you get married? Because I fell in love.  Because... ...you fell... ...in love? Good afternoon. I want nothing from you. I ask nothing of you. Why can't we be friends? Good afternoon. I'm sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and therefore, merry Christmas, Uncle! Good afternoon! And a happy New Year! Good afternoon! And a very merry Christmas to you too, Mr. Cratchit. Merry Christmas to you, sir. There's another one. A clerk making 15 shillings a week... ...and with a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam. Good afternoon. Scrooge and Marley's, I believe? Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley? Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years. He died seven years ago... this very night. Well, we have no doubt that his generosity is well represented by his surviving partner. At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and the destitute. Many thousands are in want of common comfort, sir. Are there no prisons? Prisons? Yes, yes, plenty of prisons. And the union workhouses, are they still in operation? They are. I wish I could say they were not. The treadmill in full vigor? Very busy, sir. Good! I was afraid something had occurred to stop them in their useful course. Yes. At this festive season, a few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth. What shall we put you down for? Nothing. Oh, you wish to remain anonymous? I wish to be left alone! I don't make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I support the establishments I have mentioned. And those who are badly off must go there. Many cannot go there. And, well, frankly, many would rather die. Then they had better do it and decrease the surplus population. Good afternoon, gentlemen! Good afternoon. You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose? Well, if quite convenient, sir. It's not convenient, and it's not fair. If I were to dock you a half a crown for it, you'd think yourself illused. And yet you don't think me illused when I pay a day's wages for no work. Well, it's only once a year, sir. Poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December. But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier the next morning. Sir. In honor of Christmas Eve! Bugger it! Where are you? Here! Why does everything seem to happen to me? Get away! Get away! Balderdash! I have given myself the willies. That's what it is. It's all still a hum... How now! What do you want with me? Oh, much. Who are you? Ask me who I was. Who were you then? In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley. Can you sit down? I can. Do it then. You do not believe in me. I don't. Why do you doubt your senses? Because the littlest thing can affect them. A slight disorder of the stomach can make them cheat. You may be an undigested bit of beef. A blot of mustard. A crumb of cheese. A fragment of underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are. Mercy! Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me? Man of worldly mind, do you believe in me or not? I do! I must! Woe! Woe is me! You are fettered in chains. Why? I wear the chain I forged in life. I made it link by link and yard by yard. Do you recognize its pattern? Can you imagine the weight and length of the chain you bear? It was as heavy and long as this seven Christmas Eves ago. Oh, yours is a ponderous chain. Jacob, tell me no more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob. I have none to give. I cannot stay. I cannot linger anywhere. Mark me, in life, my spirit never walked beyond our countinghouse, never roved beyond the narrow limits of our moneychanging hole. Now endless journeys lie before me. Seven years dead and traveling all the time? The whole time. No rest, no peace. You must've covered a lot of ground in seven years. I was blind! Blind! I could not see my own life! Squandered and misused. Oh, woe... Oh, woe is me! But you were always a good man of business! Business! Mankind... was my business. The common welfare was my business. Charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence were all my... Hear me! My time is nearly gone. I will. But don't be hard upon me, Jacob. Pray. I am here to warn you that you have yet a chance and a hope of escaping my fate. A chance of my procuring, Ebenezer. You were always a good friend to me, Jacob. Thank 'ee. You will be haunted by three spirits. That's the chance and hope? I'd rather not. Expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls one. Couldn't I take them all at once, and have it over with, Jacob? Expect the second the next night at the same hour. And the third upon the next night, when the last stroke of 12 has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more. I'm sorry. I wish I could help you. Are you the spirit whose coming was foretold to me? I am. Is it possible that you might put your cap on? Would you so soon put out, with your worldly hands, the light I give? No, no! No, no! I'm so sorry. I meant nothing by it. I meant no offense. I just thought I... Who and what are you? I am the Ghost of Christmas Past. Long past? Your past. Rise. And walk with me. But I am mortal and liable to fall. Bear but a touch of my hand there... ...and you shall be upheld in more than this. Good heavens. I was bred in this place. I was a boy here. Your lip... is trembling. And what's that? On your cheek? Nothing. Something in my eye. Do you remember the way? Remember it? I could walk it blindfolded. Giddyup! Giddyup! These are but shadows of things that have been. They have no consciousness... of us. I knew them. I know every one of them. They were schoolmates of mine. Let's go on. This... This was my school. This school is not quite deserted. A solitary child... ...neglected by his friends... ...is left here still. I know. Poor boy. Poor, poor boy. Let's... see another Christmas. Ebenezer! Ebenezer! Dear, dear brother! I've come to bring you home! Home, little Fan? Yes, home! Father is so much kinder than he used to be. He spoke so gently to me one night. I was not afraid to ask him if you might come home. And he said yes! And he sent me in a coach to fetch you. And we're to be together all the Christmas long. And to have the merriest time in all the world! You're quite a woman, little Fan. She had a large heart. She died a woman. And had, as I think... ...children. Yes, one child. True. Your nephew. Yes. Do you know this place? Know it? I was an apprentice here! Why, it's old Fezziwig. Bless his heart! It's Fezziwig alive again! Yoho! Ebenezer, come on! Come on! Dick! Come on! It's 6:00. They're going to be here soon. Dick Wilkins. Bless me, yes. There he is, Dick Wilkins. He was very attached to me, was Dick. Yoho, me lads! No more work tonight. It's Christmas Eve! Hooray! Dick, Ebenezer, let's get cleared away. We want lots of space. Lots and lots of space. Heehi! Maestro! May I present...?! Well done! Well done! And now, kind fiddler, if you please. It is time for Sir Roger de Coverley! Might I have this dance with you? Ebenezer, it's your pass. Another idol has replaced me. Another idol? What idol? A golden one. There is nothing on this earth more terrifying to me than a life doomed to poverty. May I ask, why do you condemn, with such severity, the honest pursuit of substance? You fear the world too much, Ebenezer. You've changed. Changed? Perhaps grown wiser, but I have not changed toward you. Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so. When it was made... You were another man. I was a boy! I release you, Ebenezer. Have I ever sought release? In words, no. In what, then? In an altered spirit. In another atmosphere of life. In everything that made my love of any worth in your sight. Tell me, Ebenezer, if this contract had never been between us, would you seek me out now? No. You think not? I would gladly think otherwise if I could. But if you were free today, would you choose a dowerless girl? A girl left penniless by the death of her parents? You, who weighs everything by gain? I release you, Ebenezer. May you be happy in the life you've chosen. Spirit, remove me from this place. I told you, these were shadows of things that have been. They are what they are. Do not blame me. Remove me. I cannot bear it. Leave me! Take me back! Haunt me no longer! Oh, blast! Enter, Scrooge! Come in! Come in and know me better, man! I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. Look upon me! You have never seen the likes of me before? Never. Have never walked forth with my elder brothers? I don't think that I have. You have many brothers? More than 1,800. 1,842, to be exact. I see you wear a scabbard, but no sword. Indeed. Peace on Earth. Goodwill toward men. Spirit, conduct me where you will. Touch my robe. What's happening? What are you doing? Very strange. Indeed. Not many mortals are granted a heavenly perspective of man's world. Yes. It's quite beautiful. Spirit, these poor people have no means to cook their food. And yet you seek to close the only places in which they can warm their meager meals every seventh day. Hear me, Scrooge. There are some upon this earth of yours who claim to know me and my brothers, and do their deeds of ill will and selfishness in our name. These socalled ""men of the cloth"" are as strange to me and my kin as if they never lived. Charge their doings to them, not us. Aye. I will. Smell that? Cooking goose! Come on! I take it this bleak paupers' dwelling is of some significance. It is all your loyal clerk can afford for his meager 15 bob a week. Mother! Papa! We just came by the baker shop. And smelled our goose, cooking delicious. Shut the door, please. What happened to your precious father? And your brother. And Martha, she wasn't as late last Christmas Day. Mother, here she is, Mother. Here's Martha. Martha! Wait till you see our goose. 'Tis a wonderful one. Peter, off with you to the baker's and collect the bird. And take the children with you. And pray, no dallying. Why, bless your heart alive! Dear, how late you are! We had a deal of work to finish up last night and clear away this morning. Never mind. Long as you're here. Sit ye down before the fire and have a warm. No. No, no, no. There's Father coming. Hide, Martha. You must hide. Hide, Martha. It's cold out there. Hello, Father. Hello, Timmy. Why, where's our Martha? Not coming. Not coming? Not coming upon Christmas Day? Here I am, Father! We got you, Father. I couldn't bear to see you in a state of disappointment. If only for a giggle. It's so lovely to see you, my Martha. Come on, Timmy. I hear the pudding singing in the copper. Shall we have a look, then? How did little Timmy behave? As good as gold. And better. Somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much, and he thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people sawed him in church, because he was a cripple... ...and it might make pleasant for them to remember it upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see. I believe he grows more hearty and stronger every day, my dear. The pudding looks delicious! The whole wash house smells like a pastry cook's shop. Spirit, tell me, will Tiny Tim...? I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney corner... ...and a crutch without an owner. Carefully preserved. Hurrah! The Christmas goose! Make space. Let's get that cover off. Lovely! Well done, Peter. I don't believe I've ever seen a more magnificent goose cooked. It is a beautiful bird, that's for sure. But I'll pray that one Christmas, perhaps, the children might taste a turkey. Perhaps one day, my dear. Perhaps one day. A toast. To Mr. Scrooge. The founder of our feast. Founder of the feast, indeed. I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I'd hope he'd have a good appetite for it. My dear, the children... It's Christmas Day. Christmas Day, I'm sure. How can one drink the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge? As you know he is, Robert. Nobody knows it better than you. My dear, Christmas Day. I'll drink his health for your sake and the day's, not for his. A merry Christmas and a happy New Year. He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt. A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us. God bless us. God bless us, everyone. Merry Christmas and happy New Year. God bless. Kind spirit, say Tiny Tim will be spared. If these shadows remain unaltered by the future... ...the child will die. Die! No, spirit. No. What then? If he is to die, he had better do it. And decrease the surplus population. So you're thinking of an animal? Yes. A live animal? Yes. A rather disagreeable animal? Yes. A savage animal? Yes. Wait, wait! Is it an animal that grunts and growls? Yes! And lives in London? Yes. A horse? No. A cow? No. A dog? A pig? No. An ass? Yes and no. I know who it is, Fred! I know! It's your Uncle Scrooge! Yes! Christmas a humbug? Now, he actually said that? As I live. And he believes it. I have no patience with him, Fred. I have. I'm sorry for him. Who suffers from his ill whims? Only himself. He decides to dislike us, won't come and dine with us, and what's the consequence? He loses a dinner. Indeed, he loses a very good dinner. Hear, hear. A magnificent dinner. Great. He's certainly given us plenty of merriment, that's for sure, and I think it would be ungrateful not to drink to his health. He wouldn't take it from me, but he may have it nevertheless. A merry Christmas to the old man, whatever he is. Uncle Scrooge. To Uncle Scrooge. Are spirits' lives so short? My life upon this globe is very brief. It ends tonight. Tonight? Tonight at midnight. Hark. The time is drawing near. Forgive me... ...but I see something strange protruding from your skirt. Is it a foot or a claw? It might be a claw, for the scant amount of flesh there is upon it. Look here. Naff off! Oh, man. Look here. You daft old geezer. Look! Look! Down here! Go away! Are they yours? They are man's. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both. Have they no refuge? No resource? Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses? Am I in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come? You're about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen. Is that so, spirit? Ghost of the Future, I fear you more than any specter I have seen. But I know your purpose is to do me good. I am prepared to bear you company. Lead on. The night is waning fast. It's precious time to me. Lead on, spirit. When did he die? Last night, I believe. Or sometime Christmas Day. I thought he'd never die. What's he done with his money? Hasn't left it to me. That's all I know. It is likely to be a cheap funeral. For the life of me, I can't think of anyone who'd want to attend it. I don't mind going... if lunch is provided. There, yes. What a frightful fellow. All right. Good day, gentlemen. Get ahold of yourself, Ebenezer. You're having a wobbly. You won't get me in here. Christmas pudding, no doubt. I'm... I'm on Lime Street. Come now. Merry Christmas, Joe. And happy New Year, to be sure. Come in. Sit down in me parlor and let's have a look. Here. What do you call these, Mrs. Dilber, huh? Mrs. Dilber? Bed curtains. You mean to say you took them down while he was lying there? I do. And why not? You was born to make your fortune, and you certainly will do it. Well, I shan't hold back my hand when I can get something by it... Don't you go getting grease on them blankets now. His blankets? Whose else do you think? He won't be feeling the cold without them now, I dare say. I hope he didn't die of anything catching. Don't you be afeard of that. I ain't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about. You can look through that shirt till your eyes ache, and you won't find one hole in it. It was the best he had. Mrs. Dilber! Would have been wasted, only for me. You're fired! Fired! How did you mean ""wasted""? Somebody was fool enough to put it on him to be buried in. But I took it off him. This is the end of it, you see. He frightened everyone away while he was alive. Only to profit us now that he's dead. If he'd had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death, instead of lying there, all alone, gasping out his last breath... ...well, we wouldn't have these things to sell now, would we? Spirit! I see! I see! The case of this unhappy man who dies a solitary, lonesome death might be my own. My life tends that way now. Merciful heavens! What's this? Spirit, this is a fearful place. When I leave it, I shall not leave its lesson. Trust me. Let's go! I understand. And I would, if I could, but I have not the power. Spirit, if there is any person who feels emotion caused by this man's death, show that person to me, I beg you. Are we ruined? There is hope yet. Hope? Only if he relents. He is past relenting. He is dead. Dead? To whom will our debts be transferred? I don't know, but by then we'll have the money. And even if we don't, it's unlikely any new creditor will ever be so merciless. We shall sleep tonight with light hearts, my dear. Let me see some tenderness connected to death, or this chamber will forever haunt me! It's late. Past your father's time. He's walked slow these last few evenings. Oh, he has walked... ...with Tiny Tim on his shoulders... fast, indeed. But he was very light... ...to carry, and... ...your father loved him so. Father. You went today, then? Yes, my dear. I wish you could have gone. Would have done you good to see how green a place it is. You'll see it often. And I promised him I would walk there every... every Sunday. My little child! My little child. Father, please don't be grieved. Please, Father. I'm all right, love. I'm quite at peace. I'm sure none of us will ever forget our poor Tiny Tim. Oh, no, Father. Never ever. Thank you. Thank you, my dears. Bob. Specter... something tells me our parting moment is at hand. Tell me... ...who... was that man we saw lying dead? Spirit... ...before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point, answer me one question! Are these the shadows of things that will be or shadows of things that may be? Men's courses in life foreshadow certain ends. But if these courses are departed from, these ends will change. Isn't that so? No. No! Am I that man who lay upon the bed? No. Spirit, hear me! I'm not the man I was! Why show me this if I'm past all hope? Spirit! Spirit, assure me that I may change these shadows you've shown me! Change them by an altered life! No, spirit! No! No, spirit! Good spirit... help me! Spirit! Help me, spirit! Help, spirit! Spirit, I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year. I will not shut out the lessons of the past, nor present, nor future. Oh, please, spirit, tell me I may sponge away the writing on that stone! Still here? They're still here. I'm still here. I'm still here. I'm still here! I don't know what to do. I'm light as a feather, merry as a schoolboy. I've heard that laugh before. I say, what's today? Eh? What's today, my fine fellow? Today? Why, Christmas Day. It's Christmas Day? I haven't missed it. The spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hello, my fine fellow. Do you know the poulterer's on the corner? I should hope I did. What an intelligent boy. Do you know whether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging there? Not the little prize turkey, the big one. The one as big as me? What a delightful child. Yes, my buck. It's hanging there now. Is it? Go and buy it, then! Walker! No, no, I'm in earnest. Go and buy it, bring it back here, and I'll give you a shilling. Come back in less than five minutes, and I'll give you a half a crown. I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's. He shan't know who sent it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Mrs. Dilber. Merry Christmas! Oh, my God! He's gone mad! My dear Mrs. Dilber, you're the loveliest creature I have ever laid eyes upon. Dance with me, Mrs. Dilber. Dance with me! You're barmy, Mr. Scrooge! Unhand me! He's completely deranged! Help! What a charming woman. Help! I shall love it as long as I live. What an honest face it has. Hello. Here's the bird. Hello! Whoop! How are you? Merry Christmas. Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town. You must have a cab. Drive on, my good man! Hillyho! Chirrup! Hip, hip! Chirryup! Bob's your uncle! Fanny's your aunt! Here's your aunt's fanny. Live it up, folks! You'll be a long time dead! Don't let the worms have all the fun. Merry Christmas. Good morning, sir. A merry Christmas to you. And to you, sir. Happy holiday! And a merry Christmas to you. ""God bless you, sir."" Thank you, sir. Glad tidings. Sir. My dear sir, how do you do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. A merry Christmas to you, sir. Mr. Scrooge? Yes. That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you. But allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness... Lord bless me! My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious? And not a farthing less. A great many back payments are included in it, I assure you. My dear sir, I don't know what to say to such... Do not say anything. I'm much obliged to you. Many thanks to you. And bless you. Is your master at home? Yes, sir. I'm... his uncle. Is it an animal that grunts and growls? Yes. And lives in London? Yes. A horse? No. A cow? No. A dog. A pig. No. An ass. Yes and no. I know what it is, Fred! I know! What? It's your... Uncle Scrooge? Well, bless my soul. I've... come to dinner... ...if you'll have me. Of course, Uncle! Welcome! Welcome! Merry Christmas! Everybody, this is my uncle, Ebenezer. Be good and pass this. Here you go. Enjoy. Next year we must have this dinner at my house. I insist. I'll spare no expense. After all, you can't take it with you, can you? No, you can't. A full 16 minutes late. What do you mean by coming here at this time of day? I'm very sorry, sir. I am a bit behind in my time. You are, indeed. Step in here. Well, it's only once a year, sir. It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday. Now, I'll tell you what, Mr. Cratchit. I'm not going to stand for this sort of thing any longer. And therefore... And therefore... ...I am about to raise your salary! A merry Christmas to you, Bob. A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I've given you in many a year. I'll raise your salary, and do whatever I can to help your struggling family. And we'll discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a bowl of Christmas punch. But first, let's make up the fires. I want you to go out... ...and buy another scuttle of coal before you dot another ""I,"" Bob Cratchit. Off with you, Bob. We've wassailing to do. Hillyho, Bob! Yeah. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. And Scrooge was better than his word. He did all that he said he would and more. And to our Tiny Tim, who got well, Scrooge was like a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master and as good a man as the good old city ever knew. And it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well. And so, as Tiny Tim observed... God bless us, everyone."
Atlantis-The Lost Empire,Disney,2000,2001,Animation,"Aah! Aah! Mahtim! Mahtim! Mahtim! Good afternoon, gentlemen. First off, I'd like to thank this board... for taking the time to hear my proposal. Now, we've all heard of the legend of Atlantis... a continent somewhere in the midAtlantic... that was home to an advanced civilization... possessing technology far beyond our own... that, according to our friend Plato here... was suddenly struck by some cataclysmic event... that sank it beneath the sea. Now, some of you may ask, why Atlantis? It's just a myth, isn't it? Pure fantasy. Well, that is where you'd be wrong. 10,000 years before the Egyptians... built the pyramids... Atlantis had electricity, advanced medicine... even the power of flight. Impossible, you say? Well, no. No, not for them. Numerous ancient cultures all over the globe agree... that Atlantis possessed a power source of some kind... more powerful than steam, than... than coal. More powerful than our modern... internal combustion engines. Gentlemen, I propose that we find Atlantis... find that power source... and bring it back to the surface. Now, this is a page from an illuminated text... that describes a book called the Shepherd's Journal... said to have been a firsthand account... of Atlantis and its exact whereabouts. Now, based on a centuriesold translation of a Norse text... historians have believed the Journal resides in Ireland. But after comparing the text... to the runes on this Viking shield... I found that one of the letters... had been mistranslated. So, by changing this letter... and inserting the correct one... we find that the Shepherd's Journal... the key to Atlantis... lies not in Ireland, gentlemen... but in Iceland. Uhh! Pause for effect. Gentlemen, uh, I'll take your questions now. Uh, would you gentlemen please excuse me for a moment? Cartography and Linguistics, Milo Thatch speaking. Yeah. Uh, just... just a second. Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom. How's that? Is that better? Uhhuh. Yeah. You're welcome. And don't let it happen again! All right, bye. Now, as you can see by th... by this, um, map... map, uh, that... that... ahem... that I've drawn, I plotted the route... that will take myself and a crew... to the southern coast of Iceland to retrieve the Journal. Ah, showtime. Well, this is it. I am finally getting out of the dungeon. ""Dear Mr. Thatch, this is to inform you... ""that your meeting today has been moved up... ""from 4:30 P.M. To 3:30 P.M."" What? ""Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence... ""the board has voted to reject your proposal. ""Have a nice weekend. Mr. Harcourt's office."" They can't do this to me! I swear, that young Thatch... gets crazier every year. If I ever hear the word ""Atlantis"" again... I'll step in front of a bus! Ha ha ha! I'll push you! Mr. Harcourt! Good Lord! There he is! Members of the board... uh, wait! How did you find us? Mr. Harcourt, wait! Head for the hills! Where is a guard when you need him? Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir! Uh, sir? Wait! Mr. Harcourt! Sir, II have new evidence that... Please, Mr. Harcourt! Stop! Sir, if you... Could you hold... Thank you very much. Look at... This museum funds scientific expeditions... based on facts, not legends and folklore. Besides, we need you here. We depend on you. You do? Yes! What with winter coming... that boiler's going to need a lot of attention. Boiler? Onward, Heinz! But there... there's a journal! It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time! Sir, I really hoped it wouldn't come to this... but this is... uhh... a letter of resignation. If you reject my proposal, I'll... Whoa! I'll quit! I mean it, sir. If you refuse to fund my proposal... You'll what? Flush your career down the toilet... just like your grandfather? You have a lot of potential, Milo. Don't throw it all away chasing fairy tales. But I can prove Atlantis exists! You want to go on an expedition? Here. Take a trolley to the Potomac and jump in! Maybe the cold water will clear your head. Heinz! I'm home. Fluffy? Here, kitty. Milo James Thatch? Who... who are you? How did you get in here? I came down the chimney. Ho, ho, ho. My name is Helga Sinclair. I'm acting on behalf of my employer... who has a most intriguing proposition for you. Are you interested? Your... your... your employer? Heh. Who is your employer? This way, please. And don't drip on the Caravaggio. Step lively. Mr. Whitmore does not like to be kept waiting. You will address him as ""Mr. Whitmore"" or ""Sir."" You will stand unless asked to be seated. Keep your sentences short and to the point. Are we clear? And relax. He doesn't bite... often. Grandpa? Finest explorer I ever met. Preston Whitmore. Pleasure to meet you, Milo. Join me in a little yoga? Uh, no, no. Thank you. Did you really know my grandfather? Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus back in Georgetown. Class of '66. We stayed close friends... till the end of his days. Even dragged me along... on some of his danged fool expeditions. Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was. He spoke of you often. Funny. He... he never mentioned you. Oh, he wouldn't. He knew how much I liked my privacy. I keep a low profile. Mr. Whitmore, should I be wondering why I'm here? Look on that table. Ah! It's for you. It's... it's from my grandfather. He brought that package to me years ago. He said if anything were to happen to him... I should give it to you... when you were ready... whatever that means. It... It can't be. It's the Shepherd's Journal. Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key... to finding the lost continent of Atlantis! Atlantis! Ha ha ha! I wasn't born yesterday, son. No, no, no. Look... look at this. Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here. Yeah, looks like gibberish to me. That's because it's been written in a dialect... that no longer exists. So it's useless. No, no, just difficult. I've spent my whole life studying dead languages. It's not gibberish to me. Ah, it's probably a fake. Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather would have known... if this were a fake. I would know. I will stake everything I own, everything that I believe in... that this is the genuine Shepherd's Journal. All right, all right. So what do you want to do with it? Well, I'll... I'll... I'll get funding. I mean, I'll... The museum... They'll never believe you. I'll show them! I will make them believe. Like you did today? Yes! Well, no. How did you... Forget about them, OK? Never mind! I will find Atlantis on my own. I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat! Congratulations, Milo. This is exactly what I wanted to hear. But forget the rowboat, son. We'll travel in style. It's all been arranged, the whole ball of wax. Why? For years your granddad bent my ear... with stories about that old book. I didn't buy it for a minute. So finally I got fed up... and made a bet with the old coot. I said, ""Thatch, if you ever actually find... ""that socalled journal... ""not only will I finance the expedition... ""but I'll kiss you full on the mouth."" Lmagine my embarrassment... when he found the darn thing. Now I know your grandfather's gone, Milo... God rest his soul, but Preston Whitmore... is a man who keeps his word. You hear that, Thatch? I'm going to the afterlife... with a clear conscience, by thunder! Your grandpa was a great man. You probably don't realize how great. Those buffoons at the museum dragged him down... made a laughingstock of him. He died a broken man. If I could bring back just one shred of proof... that'd be enough for me. Ah, Thatch. What are we standing around for? We got work to do. But, Mr. Whitmore, you know, in order to do... what you're proposing, you're gonna need a crew. Taken care of! You'll need engineers and... and geologists. Got 'em all. The best of the best. Gaetan Moliere, geology and excavation. The man has a nose for dirt. Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions. Busted him out of a Turkish prison. Audrey Ramirez. Don't let her age fool you. She's forgotten more about engines... than you or I will ever know. They're the same crew that brought the Journal back. Where was it? Iceland. I knew it! I knew it! All we need now is an expert in gibberish. So it's decision time. You can build on the foundation your grandfather left you... or you can go back to your boiler room. This is for real. Now you're catching on. All right. OK. III'll have to quit my job. It's done. You resigned this afternoon. I did? Yep. Don't like to leave loose ends. Um, my apartment. I have to give notice. Taken care of. My clothes? Packed. My books? In storage. My cat? My gosh. Your granddad had a saying. ""Our lives are remembered... by the gifts we leave our children."" This journal is his gift to you, Milo. Atlantis is waiting. What do you say? I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore. You will not regret this. Boy, I am so excited, lIII can't even hold it in. Carrots. Why is there always carrots? I didn't even eat carrots. Attention. All hands to the launch bay. To whoever took the ""L"" from the Motor Pool sign... ha ha, we are all very amused. Excuse me? I need to, uh, report in? Yes, Mr. Thatch? Aah! Uh, it's you! Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you. Hold that thought. What is it this time, Cookie? You done stuffed my wagon full to bustin' with nonessentials. Look at all this... cinnamon, oregano, cilantro. What in the cockadoodle is cilantro? And what is this? That would be lettuce. Lettuce? Lettuce?! It's a vegetable, Cookie. The men need the four basic food groups. I got your four basic food groups! Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard! All right, cowboy. Pack it up and move it out. Attention. All hands to the launch bay. Final loading in progress. Hey, Junior. If you're lookin' for the pony rides... they're back there. Excuse me. Excuse me? You dropped your dydydydynamite. Heh heh heh. What else have you, uh, got in there? Oh, eh, gunpowder, nitroglycerin, notepads... fuses, wicks, glue, and... paper clips. Big ones. You know, just, uh, office supplies. Milo! Where you been? I want you to meet Commander Rourke. He led the Iceland team that brought the Journal back. Milo Thatch. Pleasure to meet the grandson of old Thaddeus. I see you got that journal. Nice pictures, but... I prefer a good western myself. Pretty impressive, eh? Boy, when you settle a bet, yyou settle a bet. Well, your granddad always believed... you couldn't put a price on the pursuit of knowledge. Well, uh, believe me this'll be small change... compared to the value of what we're gonna... learn on this trip. Yes, this should be enriching for all of us. Attention, all personnel. Launch will commence in 15 minutes. Mr. Whitmore. Rourke. It's time. Bye, Mr. Whitmore! Make us proud, boy! Rig ship for dive! Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive. Lieutenant, take her down. Diving officer, submerge the ship. Make the depth 150 feet. Make the depth 150 feet. Dive, dive! Five degrees down bubble. Take us down. Attention. Tonight's supper will be baked beans. Musical program to follow. Who wrote this? Aah! You have disturbed the dirt. Uh, pardon me? You have disturbed the dirt! Dirt from around the globe, spanning the centuries! What have you done? England must never merge with France! What's it doin' in my bed? You ask too many questions. Who are you? Who sent you? Speak up! Me? I'm, uh... Bah! I will know soon enough. Hey, hey, hey! Let go! Do not be such a crybaby. Hold still. Aha! There you are. Now tell me your story, my little friend. Parchment fiber from the Nile circa 500 B. C. Lead pencil, number 2. Paint flecks... of a type used in government buildings. You have a cat, shorthaired Persian... two years old, third in a litter of seven. There are all the microscopic fingerprints... of the mapmaker. And linguist. Hey, how did you... This is an outrage! You must leave at once! Out, out, out, out, out! Uhoh. Sat in the dirt, didn't you? Moliere, now what have I told you... about playing nice with the other kids? Get back. I've got soap, and I'm not afraid to use it. Back, foul creature! Back to the pit from which you came! The name's Sweet. Joshua Sweet. Medical officer. Yeah, Milo Thatch. Milo Thatch. You're my 3:00. Well, no time like the present. Oh, boy. Nice, isn't it? The catalog says that this little beauty... can saw through a femur in 28 seconds. I'm bettin' I can cut that time in half. Now, stick out your tongue and say ""ahh."" Oh, no, really, I have a... Aah. So, where you from? Really? I have family up that way. Beautiful country up there. Do you do any fishing? Me? I hate fishing. I hate fish. Hate the taste, hate the smell... and hate all them little bones. Here, I'm gonna need you to fill these up. With what? Will Milo Thatch please report to the bridge? Thank you. I mean, uh, uh, nice meeting you. Uhhuh. Nice meeting you, too. So I says to him, ""What's wrong with my meatloaf?"" And he says to me... Oh. Hold on a second, Margie, I got another call. Sir, we're approaching coordinates. Hello, Margie? Yeah, so anyways, he says... All right, let's have a look around. Aye, sir. Set course to 240. 15 degrees down angle on the bow planes. Come right 240. Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch. OK, everybody... I want you to give Mr. Thatch... your undivided attention. Good afternoon. Can everyone hear me OK? Heh, OK, uh, how... how 'bout some slides? The... the first slide is a depiction of a creature. A creature so frightening... that sailors were said to be driven mad... by the mere sight of it. Hubba, hubba. Uh, I'm sorry. That's... wrong. Geez, I used to take lunch money... from guys like this. Anyway, this, uh... OK. This is an illustration of the Leviathan... the creature guarding the entrance to Atlantis. With something like that... I would have white wine, I think. It's a mythical sea serpent. He's described in the Book of Job. The... the Bible says... ""Out of his mouth go burning lights... sparks of fire shoot out."" But more likely it's a carving or a sculpture... to frighten the superstitious. So we find this masterpiece. Then what? When do we dig? Actually, we don't have to dig. You see, according to the Journal... the path to Atlantis will take us down a tunnel... at the bottom of the ocean, and we'll come up a curve... into an air pocket right here... where we'll find the remnants... of an ancient highway that will lead us to Atlantis. Kind of like the grease trap in your sink. Cartographer, linguist, plumber. Hard to believe he's still single. You said there'd be digging. Go away, Mole. Captain, you'd better come look at this, sir. OK, class dismissed. Give me exterior lights. Look at that. There are ships here from every era. Commander, I think you should hear this. ""Predeshtem logtu nug... nah geb."" Commander? Commander? ""Enter the lair of the Leviathan."" Commander? ""There you will find the path to the gateway."" Commander? Yes, Mrs. Packard. What is it? I'm picking up something on the hydrophone... I think you should hear. Put it on speakers. What is it? A pod of whales? Uhuh. Bigger. It sounds metallic. Could be an echo off one of the rocks. Do you want to do my job? Be my guest. Is it just me, or is that getting louder? Well, whatever it was, it's gone now. Helmsman! Bring us about. Tighten our search pattern and slow us to... Out of the way! Tell Cookie to melt the butter... and break out the bibs. I want this lobster served up on a silver platter. Load the torpedo bays! Subpod crews, battle stations! Battle stations! Steady, boys. Don't panic. Jiminy Christmas! It's a machine! Wait, wait! Uhh! Launch subpods! Subpods away! Fire! We're free. All ahead full. Fire torpedoes! Fire torpedoes! Get me the bridge! Sir, it's engineering on four. Rourke! We took a big hit down here... and we're taking on water fast. I don't want to be around when it hits the boilers. How much time do we have? 20 minutes, if the bulkhead holds. You better make that five. You heard the lady. Let's move! Move! Where? Move where? Packard, sound the alarm! He took his suitcase? Marge, honey, I don't think he's comin' back. Packard! I have to call you back. No, no, I'll call you. All hands, abandon ship. Move it, people! Sometime today would be nice! Come on! Everybody grab a seat and buckle in. Lieutenant, get us out of here! Lieutenant! I'm working on it! Hang on. Where to, Mr. Thatch? We're looking for a big crevice of some kind. There! Up ahead. All craft, make your mark 20 degrees down angle. Roger! 20 degrees down angle. Right behind you! Sacre bleu! We're getting killed out here! Look out! It's only a grease trap. It's just like a sink. It's only a grease trap. It's just like a sink! Seven hours ago, we started this expedition... with 200 of the finest men and women I've ever known. We're all that's left. I won't sugarcoat it, gentlemen. We have a crisis on our hands. But we've been up this particular creek before... and we've always come through, paddle or no paddle. I see no reason to change that policy now. From here on in, everyone pulls double duty. Everyone drives, everyone works. Looks like all our chances for survival... rest with you, Mr. Thatch. You and that little book. We're all gonna die. OK, people. Saddle up. Lieutenant, I want this convoy moving five minutes ago. Moliere, you're on point. No, Vinney, Audrey's taking the oiler. You know the rules. I want you 50 yards... behind that truck at all times. And, Packard, put out that cigarette. Are you sure you're checked out on this class of vehicle? Uhh... Can you drive a truck? Pfft! Heh heh. Of course I can drive a truck. I mean, sure, you got your steering... and your gas and your brake... and, of course, this metal, uh, looking... thing. OK, so it was a bumper car at Coney Island... but it's the same basic principle! Come on! Sorry abou... sorry about that. Come on, civilian! Oof. Ahh. You didn't just drink that, did you? Mmhmm. That's not good. That's nitroglycerin. Don't move. Eh, don't breathe. Don't do anything, except pray maybe. Boom! Aah! Yeah. Good night! Will you look at the size of this! It's gotta be half a mile high at least. It... it must have taken hundred... no, pfft, thousands of years to carve this thing. Hey, look, I made a bridge. It only took me, like, what? 10 seconds, 11, tops. Looks like we have a little roadblock. Vinny, what do you think? I could unroadblock that if I had about 200 of these. Problem is I only got about... 10. Plus, you know, five of my own... and a couple of cherry bombs... a road flare. Hey, too bad we don't have some nitroglycerin, eh, Milo? Looks like we're gonna have to dig. It will be my pleasure. Aah! Oh! Stupid! You are stupid! I don't understand it. I just tuned this thing up this morning. Um... It looks like the rotor's shot! I'm gonna have to pull a spare... from one of the trucks. Can l... No toques nada! I'll be right back. She lives! Hey, what'd you do? Well, you know, the boiler in this baby... is a Humac model P54/813. Now we got the 814 back at the museum. The heating cores on the whole Humac line... have always been a little, you know, temperamental... so sometimes you gotta... boom! Persuade 'em a little. Yeah, yeah, thank you very much. Shut up. Two for flinching. Ooh! This is it. It's gotta be. All right, we'll make camp here. Why is it glowing? Pah! It is a natural phosphorescence. That thing is going to keep me up all night, I know it. Come and get it! For the appetizer, Caesar salad... escargot... and your Oriental spring rolls. Yuck. I wanted the escargot. Knock yourself out. There you go, Milo. Put some meat on them bones. Thanks, Cookie. That looks greasier than usual. You like it? Well, have some more. You're so skinny, if you turned sideways... and stuck out your tongue you'd look like a zipper. You know, we've been pretty tough on the kid. What do you say we cut him some slack? Yeah, you're right. Hey, Milo! Why don't you come sit with us? Really? You don't mind? Nah. Park it here. Gee, this is great. I mean, you know... it's an honor to be included in your... Mole! Ah, forgive me. I could not resist. Hey, Milo, don't you ever close that book? Yeah, you must've read it a dozen times by now. I know, but this... this doesn't make any sense. See, in this passage here, the shepherd... seems to be leading up to something. He calls it the heart of Atlantis. It could be the power source the legends refer to. But then it just... it cuts off. It's almost like there's a missing page. Kid, relax. We don't get paid overtime. I know, I know. Sometimes I get a little carried away. But, hey, you know, that's what this is all about, right? I mean, discovery, teamwork, adventure. Unless, maybe... you're just in it for the money. Money. Money. Money. Money. I'm gonna say... money. Well, I guess I set myself up for that one. What, is something wrong with your neck? Oh, yeah, I must've hurt it when... Aah! Ow! Better? Yeah! Hey, how'd you learn how to do that? An Arapaho medicine man. Get outta here. Born and raised with 'em. My father was an army medic. He settled down in the Kansas Territory... after he met my mother. No kidding. Nope. I got a sheepskin from Howard U. And a bearskin from old Iron Cloud. Halfway through medical school, I was drafted. One day I'm studying gross anatomy in the classroom... the next I'm sewing up Rough Riders on San Juan Hill. Main course. I couldn't eat another bite. I'm watching my weight. Ha ha ha, don't you worry. It'll keep and keep and keep. Thank God I lost my sense of taste years ago. Aren't you going to pitch up your tent? Uh, I did. I guess I'm still a little rusty at this. I haven't gone camping since... well, the last time my grandpa took me. I never got to meet your grandfather. What was he like? Where do you start? He was like a father to me, really. My parents died when I was a little kid... and he took me in. What? Well, I was just thinkin'. One time, when I was eight, we were hiking along this stream... and I saw something shining in the water. It was a genuine arrowhead. Well, you'd think I'd found a lost civilization... the way Grandpa carried on about it. It wasn't until I was older... that I realized that the arrowhead... was just some compressed shale... mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured... into an isosceletic triangulate. That is so cute! Say, Audrey, uh, no... no offense... but how does a teenager become the chief mechanic... of a multimillion dollar expedition? Well, I took this job when my dad retired. But the funny thing was... he always wanted sons, right? One to run his machine shop and the other... to be middleweight boxing champion. But he got my sister and me instead. So, what... what happened to your sister? She's 24 and 0, with a shot at the title next month. Anyway, I'm saving up... so my PapÃ­ and I can open another shop. Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard? I sleep in the nude. You're gonna want a pair of these. She sleepwalks. Well, as far as me goes... I just like to blow things up. Come on, Vinny... tell the kid the truth. My family owned a flower shop. We would sell roses... carnations, baby's breath, you name it. One day, I'm making... about three dozen corsages for this prom. You know, the one they put on their wrist. And everybody, they come. ""Where is it?"" ""When is it?"" ""Does it match my dress?"" It's a nightmare. Anyway, I guess there was this leak next door... of gas or what. Boom! No more Chinese laundry. Blew me right through the front window. It was like a sign from God. I found myself that boom. What's Mole's story? Trust me on this one. You don't wanna know. Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't have... told me, but you did. And now I'm telling you... you don't wanna know. The redhead's got a gun. Ahh, ooh. Ah! Aah! Holy... Whoa! Fire. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! I'm gonna kill him. Thatch, go back to bed. Get some water on that fire! No time! Get us into those caves! Move it! Move it! Move it! Yaha! Gertie, pull! Milo, jump! Right now! Aah! Aah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Aah! All right, who's not dead? Sound off. Danged lightnin' bugs... done bit me on my situpon. Somebody's gonna have to suck out that poison. Now don't everybody jump up at once. Audrey, give me a damage report. Not as bad as it could have been. We totalled rigs two and seven... but the digger looks like it'll still run. Lucky for us we landed in something soft. Pumice ash. We are standing... at the base of a dormant volcano. It just keeps going. Maybe that's our ticket outta here. Maybe not. The magma has solidified in the bowels of the volcano... effectively blocking the exit. I got the same problem with sauerkraut. Hold on. Back up. Are you sayin' this whole volcano... can blow at any time? No, no, no, no. That would take an explosive force... of great magnitude. Maybe I should do this later, huh? If we could blow the top off of that thing, we'd have a straight shot to the surface. Mr. Thatch, what do you think? Mr. Thatch? Thatch? Hey, wait! Who... who are you? Where are you going? Come back! Hey, wait a minute! Who are you? Sweet mother of Jefferson Davis! It's beautiful. Milo, I gotta hand it to you. You really came through. Uh, I take that back. Holy cats! Who are these guys? They gotta be Atlanteans. What? That's impossible! I seen this back in the Dakota. They can smell fear just by looking at ya. So keep quiet. I think it's talking to you. Ita, sum amice viator. Dices linguam Romae. Parlezvous francais? Oui, monsieur! They speak my language! Pardon, mademoiselle? Ah, voulezvous... Ooh, I like her. Hmm! 'Bout time someone hit him. I'm just sorry it wasn't me. Buenos dias. Guten tag! How do they know all these languages? Their language must be based on a root dialect. It's just like the Tower of Babel. Well, maybe English is in there somewhere. We are explorers from the surface world. We come in peace. Welcome to the city of Atlantis. Come. You must speak with my father now. Squad ""B,"" head back to the shaft... and salvage what you can. Yes, sir! We'll rendezvous in 24 hours. Let's move it. You heard him. I'm so excited! Now, what's really amazing is that... if you deconstructed Latin, you overlaid it... with a little Sumerian... throw in a dash of Thessalonian... you'd be getting close to their basic grammatical structure. Or at least you'd be in the same ballpark... Someone's having a good time. Like a kid at Christmas. Commander, there were not supposed to be people down here. This changes everything. This changes nothing. Take that, Mr. Harcourt! Your Majesty? On behalf of my crew... may I say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city. Ahem. Uh, excuse me? Commander? You presume much... to think you are welcome here. Oh, sir, we have come a long way looking for... I know what you seek... and you will not find it here. Your journey has been in vain. But we are peaceful explorers, men of science. Heh heh heh. And yet you bring weapons. Our weapons allow us to remove obstacles we may encounter. Some obstacles cannot be removed with a mere show of force. Return to your people. You must leave Atlantis at once. Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable. Sir... Not now, son. Trust me on this. We better do as he says. May I respectfully request that we stay one night, sir? That would give us time to rest, resupply... and be ready to travel by morning. Hmm. Very well. One night. That is all. Well, thank you, Your Majesty. Mmm. Your heart has softened, Kida. A thousand years ago... you would have slain them on sight. A thousand years ago, the streets were lit... and our people did not have to scavenge for food... at the edge of a crumbling city! The people are content. They do not know any better! We were once a great people. Now we live in ruins. The kings of our past would weep... if they could see how far we have fallen. Kida. Lf these outsiders... can unlock the secrets of our past... perhaps we can save our future. What they have to teach us... we have already learned. Our way of life is dying. Our way of life is preserved. Mmm. Kida, when you take the throne... you will understand. So, how'd it go? Well, the King and his daughter don't exactly see eye to eye. She seems to like us OK, but the King... I don't know, I think he's hiding somethin'. Well, if he's hiding something, I want to know what it is. Someone needs to talk to that girl. I will go! Someone with good people skills. I will do it! Someone who won't scare her away. I volunteer! Someone who can speak the language. For the good of the mission, I will go! Good man, Thatch. Thanks for volunteering. Go get 'em, tiger. OK, Milo, don't take no for an answer. ""Look, I have some questions for you... and I'm not leaving this city until they're answered!"" Yeah, that's it. That's good, that's good. I have some questions for you... and you are not leaving this city... until they are answered. Yeah, well, l... OK. Shh! Come with me. Oh, there is so much to ask about your world. You are a scholar, are you not? Judging from your diminished physique... and large forehead... you are suited for nothing else. What is your country of origin? When did the flood waters recede? How did you... Wait a minute. I got a few questions for you, too. So let's do this, OK? You ask one, then I'll ask one... then you, then me, then... Well, you get it. Very well. What is your first question? Well, OK, uh, how did you get here? Well, I mean, not you personally... but your... your culture. I mean, how did all of this end up down here? It is said that the gods became jealous of Atlantis. They sent a great cataclysm and banished us here. All I can remember is the sky going dark... and people shouting and running. Then, a bright light, like a star... floating above the city. My father said it called my mother to it. I never saw her again. I'm sorry. If it... if it's any consolation... II know how you feel, because I lost my... Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Whoa, back up! Wh... what... what are you telling me... that you remember because you were there? No, that... that's impossible... because, I mean, that would make you... you know, 8,5008,800 years old. Yes. Oh, well, hey, uh, pfft! Lookin' good. Just, uh, ahem... You got another question for me? Yes. How is it you found your way to this place? Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't easy. If it weren't for this book, we never would have made it. OK, second question. Legend has it that your people possessed... a power source of some kind that enabled them... You mean you can understand this? Yes, I'm a linguist. That's what I do, that's my job. Now, getting back to my question... This, right here, you can read this? Yes, yes, I can read Atlantean, just like you. You can't, can you? No one can. Such knowledge has been lost to us... since the time of the Mehbelmok. Oh, the Great Flood. Show me. OK, uh... ""Follow the narrow passage for another league. There you will find the fifth marker."" Yeah. Yeah, that's it. How was my accent? Boorish, provincial... and you speak it through your nose. Yeah, gotta work on that. Here, let me show you something. What? It looks like some sort of vehicle. Yes. But no matter what I try... it will not respond. Perhaps if... Way ahead of you. OK, let's see what we got here. OK. ""Place crystal into slot."" Yes, yes, I have done that! ""Gently place your hand on the inscription pad."" Yes! OK, did you... turn the crystal onequarter turn back? Yes. Yes! While your hand was on the inscription pad? Ye... No. Ah, well, see, there's your problem right there. That's an easy thing to miss. You know, you deserve credit... for even... even gettin' this far. OK, uh, give it a try. Yeah, you got that right. Oh, th... this is great! With this thing... I could see the whole city in no time at all. Wonder how fast it goes. So, who's hungry? By the way, we were never properly introduced. My name's Milo. My name is Kidagakash. KiKiKidamaschnaga. Uh, hey, you got a nickname? Kida. OK, Kida. I can remember that. Wow. What is wrong? Oh, it's nothing. I just... got something in my eye. You know, my grandpa used to tell me stories... about this place as far back as I can remember. I just wish he could be standing here with me. Ah! Ah! Eeyah! Tell me more about your companions. Your physician, he is called Cookie? No, that's Sweet. What is? The doctor. He's Sweet. Oh, he is kindly. No, no, no, that... that's his name. His name is Kindly? No, Sweet. Well, I mean, he's kindly, too. So all of your doctors are sweet and kindly? No. Well, II'm sure some are. Ours is, but that's not a requirement. You're missing the point. You are confusing me. Wow. Look at all those tattoos. Shoot. That ain't nothin'. Look here what I got. All 38 United States. Watch me make Rhode Island dance. Go on, baby, dance. Dance. There you go. Cookies are sweet, but yours is not. Sweet is kindly, but that is not his name. Audrey is sweet, but she is not your doctor. And the little digging animal called Mole... he is your pet? Close enough. Oh, don't forget to eat the head. That's where all the nutrients are. You know, Kida... the most we ever hoped to find... was some crumbling buildings, maybe some broken pottery. Instead, we find a living, thriving society. Heh heh. These guys are kinda cute when they're not, you know... formed into a fiery column of death. We are not thriving. True, our people live... but our culture is dying. We are like a stone the ocean beats against. With each passing year... a little more of us is worn away. I wish there was something I could do. I have brought you to this place to ask you for your help. There is a mural here... with writing all around the pictures. Yeah, well, you came to the right guy. OK, let me see. Let's start with this column right here. Uh, well, this, uh, uh, Kida? Uh, heh, what are you doin'? You do swim, do you not? Oh, I swim pretty girl. Prpretty good! Pretty good. Sw... Good, swim good. Pretty good. I swim pretty good. Good. It is a fair distance to where we are going. Hey, you are talkin' to the belly flop champ... at Camp Runamuck. Oof! Come on, we're... we're wasting time. Why don't you lead the way... because I have no idea where we're going. Are you all right? Well, I didn't drown, so... Good. Follow me. This is amazing! A complete history of Atlantis! It's just like Plato described it. Well, he was off on a few details, but... The light I saw. The star in the middle of the city. What does the writing say about that? I don't know yet. But we're gonna find out. Come on. The heart of Atlantis! What? It's the heart of Atlantis! That's what the shepherd wwas talking about. It wasn't a star, it was... it was some kind of crystal... uh, like these! Don't you get it? The power source I've been looking for... the bright light you remember... they're the same thing! That cannot be. It's what's keeping all these things... you, all of Atlantis alive. Then where is it now? I don't know, I don't know. You'd think something this important... would have been in the Journal, but... Unless... The missing page. You have a nice swim? Hey, guys, what's going on? What's... what's with all the guns? Guys? I am such an idiot. This is just another treasure hunt for you. You're after the crystal. Oh, you mean this? The heart of Atlantis. Yeah. About that... I would've told you sooner... but it was strictly on a needtoknow basis... and, well, now you know. I had to be sure you were one of us. Welcome to the club, son. I'm no mercenary. Whoa! Uhh! Mercenary? I prefer the term ""adventure capitalist."" Besides, you're the one who got us here. You led us right to the treasure chest. You don't know what you're tampering with, Rourke. What's to know? It's big. It's shiny. It's going to make us all rich. You think it's some kind of a diamond... I thought it was some kind of a battery... but we're both wrong. It's their life force. That crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive. You take that away, and they'll die. Well, that changes things. Helga, what do you think? Knowing that, I'd double the price. I was thinking triple. Rourke, don't do this. Academics. You never want to get your hands dirty. Think about it. If you gave back every stolen artifact... from a museum... you'd be left with an empty building. We're just providing a necessary service... to the archeological community. Not interested. I got to admit, I'm disappointed. You're an idealist, just like your grandfather. Do yourself a favor, Milo. Don't be like him. For once, do the smart thing. I really hate it when negotiations go sour. Let's try this again. Knock, knock. Room service. Tell them to drop their weapons... now! Spread out! Search everywhere! You're not applying yourself, son. There's got to be something else. Well, there isn't. It just says... ""The heart of Atlantis lies in the eyes of her king."" Well, then maybe Old King Cole here... can help us fill in the blanks. How about it, chief? Where's the crystal chamber? You will destroy yourselves. Maybe I'm not being clear. Ohh! Rourke, this was not a part of the plan. Plan's changed, doc. I'd suggest you put a bandage... on that bleeding heart of yours. It doesn't suit a mercenary. Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us. Now I'm going to count to 10... and you're going to tell me where the crystal is. t... The heart of Atlantis... lies in the eyes of her king. This is it. We're in. Rourke, for the last time... you've got to listen to me. You don't have the slightest idea... what this power is capable of. True, but I can think of a few countries... who'd pay anything to find out. Hurry. Get on. Jackpot. Ohh. The kings of our past. Thatch, tell her to wrap it up. We got a schedule to meet. Um... Kida... I'm sorry. Come on, let's get this over with. I don't like this place. All right, Thatch, what's next? OK, there's a giant crystal... hovering 150 feet above our heads... over a bottomless pit of water. Doesn't anything surprise you? The only thing that surprises me... Mahtim. That thing's not on the truck yet. Now move it! I don't know how to move it. I don't even know what's holding it up there. Ahh. Talk to me, Thatch. What's happening? Look, all it says here... is that the crystal is alive somehow. It... I don't know how to explain it. It's their deity. It's their power source. Speak English, professor. They're part of it. It's a part of them. L... I'm doing the best I can here. Well, do better. Oh, I know. Why don't you translate... and I'll wave the gun around. What did she say? I don't know. L... I didn't catch it. Hold your horses, lover boy. Kida. Kida. No, don't. Don't touch her. All right, step back. Sergeant, keep those people back. You heard him. Step back. I'm warning you. So... I guess this is how it ends, huh? Fine. You win. You're wiping out an entire civilization... but, hey... you'll be rich. Congratulations, Audrey. Guess you and your dad will be able... to open up that second garage after all. And, Vinny, you can start a whole chain of flower shops. I'm sure your family's going to be very proud. But that's what it's all about, right? Money. Get off your soapbox, Thatch. You've read Darwin. It's called natural selection. We're just helping it along. Commander, we're ready. Yeah, give me a minute. I know I'm forgetting something. I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew... Oh, yeah. Look at it this way, son. You were the man who discovered Atlantis... and now you're part of the exhibit. Let's move, people. That was an order, not a suggestion. Let's go! We're all going to die. Oh, you can't be serious. This is wrong, and you know it. We're this close to our biggest payday ever... and you pick now of all times to grow a conscience. We've done a lot of things we're not proud of... robbing graves, plundering tombs... double parking... but nobody got hurt. Well, maybe somebody got hurt... but nobody we knew. Well, if that's the way you want it, fine. More for me. P.T. Barnum was right. We can't let him do this! Wait a second. OK, now you can go. Milo, you better get up here. How's he doing? Not good, I'm afraid. Internal bleeding. There's nothing more I can do. What a nightmare. And I brought it here. Ah, don't go beating yourself up. He's been after that crystal since Iceland. The crystal. Sweet, that's it. These... these crystals... they have some sort of healing energy. I've... I've seen it work. No. Where is my daughter? Well, she... she... Mmm. She has been chosen... like her mother before her. What? In times of danger... the crystal will choose a host... one of royal blood... to protect itself... and its people. It will accept no other. WWait a minute. Choose? So this thing is alive? In a way. The crystal thrives... on the collective emotions... of all who came before us. In return, it provides power... longevity, protection. As it grew... it developed a consciousness of its own. In my arrogance... I sought to use it as a weapon of war... but it's power proved too great to control. It overwhelmed us... and led to our destruction. That's why you hid it beneath the city... to keep history from repeating itself. And to prevent Kida from suffering the same fate... as my beloved wife. What do you mean? Wh... What's going to happen to Kida? If she remains bonded to the crystal... she could be lost to it forever. The love of my daughter is all I have left. My burden would have become hers... when the time was right... but now... it falls to you. Me? Return the crystal. Save Atlantis. Save my daughter. Hmm. So, what's it going to be? Excuse me? I followed you in, and I'll follow you out. It's your decision. Oh, my decision? Well, I think we've seen how effective... my decisions have been. Let's recap. I lead a band of plundering vandals... to the greatest archeological find... in recorded history... thus enabling the kidnap and/or murder... of the royal family... not to mention personally delivering... the most powerful force known to man... into the hands of a mercenary nutcase... who's probably going to sell it to the Kaiser! Have I left anything out? Well, you did set the camp on fire... and drop us down that big hole. Thank you. Thank you very much. Of course, it's been my experience... when you hit bottom... the only place left to go is up. Who told you that? A fella by the name of Thaddeus Thatch. Where are you going? I'm going after Rourke. Milo, that's crazy. I didn't say it was the smart thing... but it is the right thing. Come on. We better make sure he doesn't hurt himself. Milo, what do you think you are doing? Just follow my lead. Wow. I'm impressed. It's simple. All you got to do... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shut up. We get it, OK? No, no, wait! Gently. Just gently. Hey, Milo, you got something sporty? You know, like a tuna? How is this done? All you got to do is use the crystals. Kida showed me. Halfturn right, quarterrun back. Keep your hand on the pad. Saddle up, partners. Bring jerky and ammo. I'm so excited. All right, this is it! We're going to rescue the princess. We're going to save Atlantis. Or we're going to die trying. Now let's do it! I love it when I win. OK, here's the plan. We're going to come in low and fast... and take them by surprise. Well, I've got news for you, Milo. Rourke is never surprised, and he's got a lot of guns. Great. Well, do you have any suggestions? Yeah. Don't get shot. There they are! We've got company! Take off! Take her up! Holy smokes! You told me he only had guns. What I said was, he's never surprised. OK, now things are getting good. Vinny! Heads up! We can't let them reach the top of that shaft! Aah! Vinny, new plan. You and me, we're going to be decoys. Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath that thing... and cut her loose. We're on it. Lieutenant! I though you said this thing... could cut through a femur in 28 seconds! Less talk, more saw. Uhh! Looks like somebody's working overtime. Come on, girl. Time's up. Whoa! All right, Milo, this is it. Any last words? Yeah. I really wish I had a better idea than this! We're losing altitude. Lighten the load. Unh! That's it, unless someone wants to jump. Ladies first. Uhh! You said we were in this together! Uhh! You promised me a percentage! Next time, get it in writing. Aah! Nothing personal. Unh! Yaah! Aah! Uhh! Unh! Aah! Uhh! Well, I have to hand it to you. You're a bigger pain in the neck... than I would have ever thought possible. I consider myself an eventempered man. It takes a lot to get under my skin... but congratulations... you just won the solidgold kewpie doll. Uhh... Uhh! Uhh! Nothing personal. Tired, Mr. Thatch? Hyah! Aw, that's a darn shame... because I'm just getting warmed up. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Thank heaven. Whoa! Uhh! Ahh. Oh, great! Ahh. The volcano... she awakes! Hey, I had nothing to do with it. This here would be a good place not to be. No, wait. We got to get her back... or the whole city will die. And if we don't get out of here, we'll die. It's the only way to reverse this. Just do it! Milo, no! Go! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! The fissure... it is about to eject... its pyroclastic fury! Milo, Mole says the wall's going to blow! Unh! Uhh! Uhh. Milo? Atlantis will honor your names forever. I only wish there was more we could do for you. Uh, you know, thanks anyway... but I think we're good. They'll take you as far as the surface. We are really going to miss you, Milo. You know, I'm going to reopen the flower shop... and I'm going to think of you guys every single day... Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00... Saturday until 2:00. Sunday... I'm going to take Sunday off probably, and... Maybe I'll go in for a couple of hours, you know... but August... I'm going to take August. I ain't so good at speechifyin'... but I wanted you to have this. It's the bacon grease from the whole trip. Cookie, l... Aw... Ahah. 2 for flinching. See you, Milo. Hey, Milo! Heh heh! Mole. Mole.

Bolt,Disney,2000,2008,Animation,"That one. Here, boy. You're heavy. And slobbery. There. You're a good boy. You're my good boy. Hello? Penny, I don't have much time. Daddy? Are you okay? Something's come up at work, honey. Daddy's not gonna be home for a while. I don't understand. You can't go back to the house, Penny. Okay? What's happening? It's all right. You won't be alone. You have Bolt. I've altered him. He can protect you now. The doctor has been taken care of, which, of course, is wonderful news. Everything is positioning nicely. There he is. Dr. Calico. Any luck getting our guest to spill his guts? His guts will spill, one way or another. Never! I'll never talk. Daddy! You're beginning to irk me, professor. I am irked, and that will not do. Has the package arrived? I think it might make our dear friend a bit more communicative. I'm sending an agent to pick it up. Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me on the first flight. Bolt, let's go. We only need the girl. What? Where's Calico? I'm not talking to you. Bolivia! Bolivia! Calico's in Bolivia! Near Lake Rogaguado! Lake Rogaguado! I should've known. Come on, Bolt. Let's go! No! Bolivia. There's a flight leaving in 10 minutes. Bolt! Zoom, zoom. Bolt, fetch. Puppy! Good boy. Airport. Bolt, speak. Okay, okay. Good job, buddy. Mission accomplished. That's a keeper. It's all right, tough guy. You got them all. Don't worry, Bolt. You saved the day again. All right. Good job. Let's strike the set. We're gonna need a cable guard on set for that move tomorrow. Yeah. All right. Good boy. Airport. Bolt, speak. Boom mike. We got a boom mike. It's a boom mike. That's sloppy. The dog could've seen that. He could've seen that. Who cares if the dog sees a boom mike? What? Who's that? Forgive me for answering a question with a question, but who are you? Mindy Parker, from the network. Of course. Let me ask you, Mindy from the network, what do you see here? The dog. ""The dog,"" she says. Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy. Am I missing something? You're missing everything, Mindy. You see a dog. I see an animal who believes with every fiber of his being, every fiber, that the girl he loves is in mortal danger. I see a depth of emotion on the face of that canine the likes ofwhich has never been captured on screen before! Never, Mindy from the network! We jump through hoops to make sure that Bolt believes everything is real. It's why we don't miss marks. It's why we don't reshoot, and it's why we most certainly do not let the dog see boom mikes! Because, Mindy from the network, if the dog believes it, the audience believes it. Wow. Okay. You want reality? Here you go, chief. The show's too predictable. The girl's in danger, the dog saves her from the creepy English guy, we get it. There's always a happy ending. And our focus groups tell us 18to33yearolds are unappy. They're not happy with happy. So maybe you should, I don't know, spend a little less time worrying about the dog's Method acting and more time figuring out how to stop 20yearolds in Topeka from changing the channel. Because if you lose so much as half a rating point, so help me, I will fire everyone in this room, starting with you. How's that for real? There. Perfect. You saved me again, Bolt. It's okay. It's nothing. No more bad guys. Do you want some food, Bolty? Are you hungry? You got them, Bolt. No one's gonna hurt me. Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see? Come here, buddy. Come here. Go get it, Bolt. Go get it. Yeah, that one's no fun either. Well, what do we have here? Your old buddy, Mr. Carrot. Bolt. You know I have to go. Yeah, you're my good boy. There she is. My little superstar. Let's get to that Teen Vogue cover shoot. Mom, I wanna take Bolt home this weekend. Well, I... That would be... That'd be nice. That'd be great. That would. A little girl and her dog. Nothing better than that. So I can bring Bolt home? As your friend I say, ""Yes, absolutely,"" but as your agent, I have to remind you this is Bolt's world. He has to stay right here. Okay, let's go. But he never gets to be a real dog, and it would only be for the weekend, and I just want... Well, you know what? It's a fair question. Let's do this, let's put a pin in it. Pin in. There you go. Now, let's let that hang there a bit, and then we'll address that when we've thought things through. Okay? Good enough for everybody? Smiles all around? Let's get out of here. Come on. I don't need to think it through. I wanna take Bolt home. Look at this face. I have a little girl at home, love of my life. I would do anything for her, and I would trade her for you in a heartbeat. True story. That reminds me, we need to be getting over to wardrobe. Clipclip, let's go. But... I need her in hair. I just... Can I get her for five minutes in makeup? I wanna go for something more natural. So the dog thinks this is all real? Oh, yeah, you're new. Guy never leaves the set. It's unbelievable. Whenever I get the chance, this is the perfect way to unwind. I like to start with an evil laugh. Hello, hairballs. You may have won today, Bolt, but in the end, we will get your little Penny. Not likely, cat, for you've chosen to follow the path of evil. Ultimately, it will destroy you, along with your fiendish puppet master! Wow! I know, right? Okay, watch this. She's a goner, dog. The GreenEyed Man has a plan, and soon, he will execute it. Yeah, and then he will execute her. Nice. I would superbark you both back into the hole you crawled out of, but I need you alive because I've got a little message for you to take back to your GreenEyed Man. You tell him his old friend Bolt said he better... Is it long? Is what long? The message. Is it a long message? Because I have a horrible memory. Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right? You tell him I said I'm gonna... You know what? Why don't we do this? You remember the first half of the message, and then I'll remember the second, and then we can pass it on to the GreenEyed Man together. Now, I don't care how the message is translated, all right? Just do it, okay. Tell the GreenEyed Man that I will not sleep, I will not rest until my Penny is safe from his evil clutches. You tell the GreenEyed Man that reckoning... Way too many words. I was, like, ""What?"" And then I was, like, ""Huh?"" And then, well, I got a little bored and... Something about clutches? Anyway, I'll do my best. Ciao. By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you. Gotta go. Thank you. Get back here, you sick, revolting, loathsome little... Dogs. Cats. I'll never let them get you, Penny. Are you ready, Bolt? Let's widen out camera three. Ready four. Go four! And driver. Thanks, Larry. All right, Scooter. Find the grate. Ready on the rubber bars. And track with them. The Calico supercomputer. Lfwe can access it, we'll finally learn where they're keeping my father. The weapors hot. Heat vision time. Bolt, stare. Now! Nice move. Come on. Come on. Such devotion. It brings tears to my eyes. Calico. Your father's discoveries could be of great use to our organization. I'm sure he'll be more accommodating now that I've got his lucky Penny! Bolt! World domination is within my grasp! How did your focus groups feel about cliffhangers? You ask for unappy 18to33yearolds, I give you unappy 18to33yearolds. Bolt! It's okay, Bolt. I'm fine. Guards, stop her! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on. Bolt! Listen to him. He needs to know I'm okay. Nope, you're not okay. You've been kidnapped by the fiendish Dr. Calico, at least that's what the dog needs to think, butjust imagine, close your eyes and imagine how excited he'll be when he saves you tomorrow. Okay? But he's gonna be freaking out all night. Please, just let me... What... Wait a second, what's that behind your ear? Is that a... Yes, it is. It's a pin. Let's do this. Let's take the pin and put it in this conversation. And we will not take it down, no, ma'am, until this matter is resolved. But I just... Do you know what that reminds me of? The DVD release junket. Let's get going. It's a big push. I want to go with a modern look, something that says, ""I'm 13, and I'm fine with that."" All right, okay. Let's give her some air. Let's not crowd the talent. I've been working on my evil laugh. 'Cause everybody has an evil laugh. Like that. Okay, here's the thing. You're not ready for the evil laugh. You could do a chuckle, like a mildly upset chuckle, after my evil laugh. Listen to mine. Hey, Bolt. Big fan! Bolt! Come back! I'm too late. Bolt! Help! I'm coming, Penny! Bolt! Help! Hold on, Penny! Hold on! Bolt! Help! Bolt! Help! Penny! Bolt! Here, Bolt! Okay! Hey! Hey! Okay, Bolty. Okay. Stay cool. You're cool, Bolty. The GreenEyed Man. Penny! Penny! Penny! Target acquired. It ends here. Penny! Penny? They moved her. There's no time for formalities, brothers. My persors in danger, and I... What are you doing? I'm sorry. You wanna sniff mine first? What? Not from around here, are you? Hey, stop it! This is serious! Hey there. Are you lost, sweetie? Hey! Wait! Why can't I bend these stupid bars? Buddy. You got your head stuck pretty good, huh, guy? Hey, guys, come here. Check this out. He's got his melon stuck. Yup, that is one stuck melon. Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy. Slow down. I will not take it easy, pheasant. I'm missing my person. Hey, buddy, relax. Like this. Turn and pull. Turn and pull. Forget about it. You'll be out, no time. What are these things? They've weakened me. Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts. Styrofoam? This has the GreenEyed Man written all over it. Have you seen the man with the green eye? You know, I gotta say something, if I could say something here. You look familiar. Joey, look at this guy's mug. Yeah. You know, I could've sworn I've seen this guy before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotta tell you, I never forget a face. He never does. Oh, yeah, yeah. Never. Yeah, he's real good with the faces and such. Listen, listen! The man with the green eye, tell me what you know, birds. I know this dog. Yeah, yeah, me, too. I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me. Hold on. No, I don't know. I thought I knew. Hey, you ever hang out down on 14th Street with a stray named Kelvin? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Kelvin, the Labradoodle. What? You gotta give me something here, 'cause this is ridonculous. Absolutely ridonculous. Capisce, ridonculous. You know what that means? You pigeons are useless. I need someone on the inside, someone close to the GreenEyed Man. A cat. A cat? Yeah, a cat. And when I find him, when I find him, I'm gonna make that cat wish he were never born. I think we knowjust the cat. Right on time, Saul. Come on in. Okay, Saul, nice work. Let's find some mustard next time. Okay, babe? Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens. Is that an everything bagel, Ted? Attaboy. Good day, Mittens. Louie? What is this? It was a slow week. That's half ofwhat I got. You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here. And when the old stomach starts talking, it ain't talking to me. It's talking to the claws. Not the claws! Please. I'm holding these bad boys back, best I can, but, thing is, it's not up to me. The stomach's got a direct line to these babies and I'm picking up a lot of chatter. So, I'll talk to the claws, but in exchange, next week all your food comes to me. But that's not our deal. I bring you half, you give me protection. That's our deal. Yeah, well, the deal just expired. Now get lost. Mark my words, Mittens. One day someone's gonna stand up to you. Someone's gonna teach you a lesson. Yeah. I'm really scared now. You should be! Okay! Yeah! Where is she? Who? You know why I'm here. Where is she? Okay, okay. Look, buddy, I don't know what you're getting at, but... Come on, Mittens. Just tell the guy where she is. Tell the dog, make him happy. Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens. Tell him! Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys! Would you tell the crazy canine that he's got the wrong cat? You got her, pal. That's her. She's the one. That is definitely the right cat. Looks like we're gonna do this the hard way. Hey, you're crazy, man! Hey, Joey. Did we go too far in this? You kidding? This is the best day of my life. You work for the men in black, who work for the man with the green eye. They've taken Penny. Where is she? I don't know what you're talking about. This is becoming tiresome, cat. In fact, I feel a yawn coming on. Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay, I'll talk! I'll talk! I know where Penny is. Yeah. They have her. Yes! The men in black and the guy, the guy with the blue eyes! Blue eyes? Green! Yes, green! The one green eye! You just can't stop lying, can you, cat? It's in the genes. It's just gross. I know. It's disgusting. I disgust myself. Hollywood. But if you put me down, I'll show you where she is. You know, I hope you appreciate the risk I'm taking here. Every bone in my evil cat body is telling me not to betray the trust of the GreenEyed Man. Okay. This is a top, top secret map of the entire Earth. Now we're over here, by the green lady with the big torch, and my boss has Penny locked up... Right... Right over... Here, here! By the waffle with the sunglasses. Now all you need to do is get from here to there. Well, I told you where to find her so if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way. I'll release you, cat, when we find Penny. Excuse me? That wasrt the deal. We had a deal! Your deal just expired. She said that to me not 10 minutes ago. The irony. Perfect. Padlocked. Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty wicked claws under these mitts. Do not, I beg of you, do not make me bring out these bad boys. It gets ugly. What are you doing? Stay back! If I stare at the lock really hard, it'll burst into flames and melt. Now I'm concerned on a number of levels. Easy, watch. I'm good. Watch it, though. You got it? Intruders! Slow down! You're scraping the fur off my... Oh, boy. This thing is heavy. Hey, hey. Put it down. I forgot the keys. I'll be right back. Hey, lucky penny! Thanks! Now move your butt. Okay. Up on your end. All right, just a little bit. Like that? A little bit more. Yeah. I got... No, I got mine. You got it? It's on the tip of my tongue. I know that dog. I'm telling you, Joey. Bobby, you guys are looking at me like, ""He don't know."" Telling you, I know this dog. I seen him somewheres. Hey, you'll remember it tonight when you're preening. Right, that's what'll happen. I have got some good news. Really? Yes, I do. I just booked you on The Tonight Show, lead guest. That's right. Which means just absolutely nothing if Bolt is still missing. It's not even good news, like, ""Whatever,"" ""So what?"" The Tonight Show, who cares? I don't care. It's okay, baby. He must be so scared. Scared? Well, this is Bolt we're talking about. He's not scared of anything. I bet Bolt would want you to do The Tonight Show. Or maybe not. Bolt loves you very much, sweetie, and you're here. He couldn't have gone far. So, if you got superpowers, I guess that would make you, what, like, some kind of superdog? That informatiors classified. Come on. Like, what's your best power? Your goto move. How about flying? Can you fly? Don't be silly. I can't fly. Okay, okay, fine. If you don't have any powers, you don't have any powers. What's it to me? I have a superbark. A superbark? Wow! You're kidding me. What exactly does one do with a superbark? I really can't talk about it. It's classified. So I suggest you pipe down and take me to Penny. You're awfully attached to this Penny character, huh, Wags? She's my person. Oh, please. She's a person. And if you ask me, the only good person is a... Styrofoam! Tuck and roll! Tuck and what? What? What is this red liquid coming from my paw? It's called blood, hero. Do I need it? Yes! So if you wanna keep it inside your body, where it belongs, you should stop jumping off trucks doing 80 on the interstate! Yeah, well, normally, I'm a tad more indestructible. Must've been the... Styrofoam! That stuff, it weakens me. What are you doing? Put that down! All right, that's it. I've had it with you. Untie me, pooch. Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna seriously wound you! I'm gonna seriously wound you with this Styrofoam. Are you mad? You don't know the power of Styrofoam. You bet I'm mad, baby, and I'm about to unleash it. The power of the Styrofoam. All right, cat! Okay. You win. I'll untie you. That's a weird place to put a piano. Are we gonna have any more problems, cat? No! No, no. No more problems. I'll take you to Penny. What is that? What? That! Okay. You have two seconds to tell me what you've implanted in me, cat! Poison? A parasite? Poison? Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I? See, I'm all discombobulated. I can't think straight. I don't believe this. You're hungry. Where is the antidote? Okay, okay! All right. There's your antidote. Food. All right, who wants burgers? I'll take one. Me, too! What's this? Go on, use the dog face. This is gonna be beautiful. You know, beg. Do the dog face. What... The dog face? What does that mean? Figures I'm tied to the one dog on Earth who doesn't know how to beg. Okay, if you want the... The antidote, you're gonna have to do exactly what I say. No. Not likely. You're a degenerate creature of darkness. Yeah, yeah. Granted. But, that said, all I'm asking you to do is just tilt your head a little. You can do that, can't you? Come on. More. More. This is stupid. No, no, no, come on. Work with me on this, please. You're almost there. Oh, boy. Okay. Try it the other way. There you go. Tilt up. Down. Now a little smile. Lose the smile. Drop your left ear. Your other left. Okay, the other way was better. Now drop them both. Hold it. Right there. And ever so slightly, look up. Soup is on, baby! Here you go! Yes! Look at the little guy. Beat it, stupid cat! Why do you care? I want to know what really happened... And why does that matter to you? Because I'm involved! With Ridge? With James! If you and James were romantic, I wanna know about it. What, so you can... Come on down! Gilligan, why don't you stop that. Come on, no Whammies! No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop! For weather on the ones, here's Lester. It really does help, and it really releases the serotonin, and... Hey, man, this time we'll do it my way. Well, hello, puppy. Did you come for some of Grandma's butter bean dumplings? You wait right there. One of these days, I'm gonna pound y'all to the ground. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Look at you. You are quite the little actor, huh? I haven't eaten like this in ages. Hey, look, my stomach's distended! How great is that? Yeah, well, don't get used to it. We gotta keep moving. But this place is a gold mine. What's wrong with you? Every week new RVs bring us new suckers who bring us new food. Look around! It's perfect. Do my eyes deceive me? Is this some apparition I see before me? Or could it be my hero? Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh! You're Bolt, the Superdog! You're fully awesome! Wait a minute. You know this dog? I do. He is fully awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've established that. Who are you? I'm Rhino. Rhino the hamster. Well, you know, my ancestry isn't all hamster. I'm onesixteenth wolfwith, you know, a little wolverine in there somewhere, but that's besides the point. We have before us a legend, Bolt, the Superdog. He can outrun speeding missiles and burn through solid metal with his heat vision. And best of all, he can obliterate large structures with his superbark! Wait a minute. You've seen the superbark? Have you been observing me? Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time. That's incredible. Oh, it's nothing, really. But I'm always so vigilant. No one can evade my detection. You're a phantom. If you say so. Hey, check it out. Take a gander at this Bolt action. Scary, huh? It's like we're twins. Yeah. Scary. So, where's Penny? She was kidnapped by the GreenEyed Man. Kidnapped? This is terrible! She could be in grave... Grave danger. I know. But I've captured this cat. An agent of the GreenEyed Man, I presume? You presume correctly. She's taking me to Penny. You, you are vile vermin. How do you sleep at night? Penny's the most wonderful person ever, and she loves Bolt. And he's awesome, and you're a monster! How dare you disrupt their relationship with your evil! Die! Die! I can take her, Bolty. Let me at them. Die! Die! Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy. You're right. We need her alive. ""We""? Yes! Bolt, I can be a valuable addition to your team. I'm listening. I'm lightningquick. I have razorsharp reflexes, and I'm a master of stealth. Plus, I'll keep the cat in check. The road'll be rough. I have a ball. There's no turning back. Guess I'll have to roll with the punches. Easy won't be part of the equation. Promise? I gotta warn you. Going into the belly of the beast, danger at every turn. I eat danger for breakfast. You hungry? Starving! Welcome aboard! Hey. Can we talk for a second? I don't know what's going on here, but I'm just a little bit concerned about the number of lunatics on this trip. My limit is one. He's coming with us. But I... Hey! Move it, prisoner. We're losing daylight. I agree. Now, we need to find a fast set ofwheels. I've got a better idea. Follow me. Okay. So what we do here is we give the target a quick flyover, we adjust the trajectory and then land dead center. Am I missing anything, Rhino? Just the knowledge that every minute spent in your company becomes the new greatest minute of my life. No! Forget it! How do you say ""No way I'm doing this"" in crazy? Calm down, cat. You're with me. That's the problem! Would you relax? Every time he did this on the magic box it was awesome. Magic what? You know, the magic box people stare at. Wait a minute. Does this magic box have moving pictures on it? Yeah, and Bolt's pictures are the best. Bolt's pictures. Of course! He's from a... Oh, no! Oh, no. No, wait, wait. Bolt, dog, hear me out. Let it begin. Let it begin. Let it begin! Wait! You are not a superhero... What are you doing? Mittens! Mittens, take my paw! I need you alive! You're crazy! Stay away from me! Take my paw. I'll save you. No, you won't! You're not really a... Bolt! Saboteur. You moron, stop it. I'm trying to help him. Help him? Yeah, right. Don't worry, Bolt. I'll stop her! I can't hold it. Let go, you monster! Bolt! The real world hurts, doesn't it? But you wouldn't know about that, would you? Get down here, cat. We don't have time for this. I'll get a ladder. Look, genius, you're part of a TV show. You know what that is? Television? It's entertainment for people. It's fake. Nothing you think is real is real! That's preposterous. Think about it, Bolt. Since you got lost, none of your powers are working, are they? For the first time, you're hungry, you're bleeding. I mean, do you really think that you were born with a birthmark in the exact shape of a lightning bolt? It's my mark of power, cat. It's the mark of a makeup artist, dog. You're ridiculous. Now get down here. No. Mittens, so help me, I will superbark you out of that tree. Yeah. Go nuts. Let's see how that works out for you. You leave me no choice. The superbark. Scary, scary. Yeah, that's really, really super. It's not true. It's just not true. Wow. That one felt really super. Wait. No, it didn't. Okay, okay. I get the idea. You could stop now. That's enough. Seriously, dog, stop. I'm not kidding. Would you stop? It's... Okay, fine! You're a superdog. Bolt, be quiet, please! Bolt, we gotta run! Bolt! Come here! Look who we found, young lady. It's Bolt! They found him. Bolt! Yeah, that's right. The little puppy dog. That is not Bolt. Well, that depends on how you look at it. You know, when I was little, I wanted a bicycle for my birthday, but my parents got me a baseball glove. So, you know what I did? I pretended that baseball glove was a bicycle, and I rode it to school every day. True story. It's not him. I think it's him. I do. Thank you. Look, kid. It's time we were honest with you. Lfwe don't get back into production, people are going to lose theirjobs. Good people, with families. But Bolt's still out there, and... Now, we feel for you, and the last thing we wanna do is ask a little girl to make a grownup decision, but it's come to that. We need you to move on. We need you to let Bolt go. Must be made of Styrofoam. No, no! No, no, no, please, please, it can't end like this! Stop worrying, cat! I'll get us out of here. You can't, Bolt! You got nothing! No super strength, no superbark... And no heat vision. Listen to me, okay? We are being taken to a place where humans go animal shopping, all right? And this is what humans do. They always pick the cute ones. The ones that look like you, Bolt. But the rest of us never come back out. I said I'll get us out of here, all right? My hero. Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny? I've been expecting your call. Would you give it up already? You're liquefying whatever brains you have left. I cannot be contained in any container. You quitter. Watch this. I did it! I'm back! That Styrofoam is wicked stuff. Fully awesome! There's no truck that I know that can keep in Bolt and Rhino! Rhino? What are you doing here? Nothing. I was enjoying an evening stroll and thought I'd just pop the hatch on that containment unit. You opened the door? Yes, I did! That's great, Rhino. Yeah, that's really good. All right. Let's go get the prisoner back. I can't do it. What did you say? I can't. Who are you? Rhino, you just don't under... You are Bolt. But I'm not a... Who singlehandedly destroyed the GreenEyed Mars undersea labs? Me, but... And who foiled his plan to infiltrate the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs? Who, Bolt, who? Who? Me, but none of it was... You! You can, Bolt, because all over this planet, there are animals who feel like they can't. Like a little hamster who once spent his days in an RV park, dreaming of the day when he, too, would save a little girl from danger and be told, ""You did it. You did it, Rhino. You saved the day."" They need a hero, Bolt. Someone who, no matter what the odds, will do what's right. They need a hero to tell them that sometimes the impossible can become possible if you're awesome! Well, you're right about one thing, Rhino. Mittens does need a hero, and I guess I'll have to do. Such modesty! Now, who's going to save that cat? Me. Who? Tell me who! Me. I'll get my ball. Over there. There it is. This'll be just like the time you infiltrated Calico's Arctic hoverbase! But it's not gonna be exactly like that, Rhino. We're gonna have to do things a little differently. Stealth mode. Good night, Ester. Good night, Lloyd. Lloyd? Lloyd Spoon, you jump out and scare me, and I'm gonna pepperspray you again! I swear, it's like I work with toddlers. Threat nullified. I feel alive. There's a guard. I'll snap his neck. We need to get him away from that door. Ball? Ball? Ball? Ball? Ball? Ball! Ball! Ball! I'm just... I'm read... I'm just... Just pipe down! Mittens? Bolt? What are you doing here? I'm busting you out. You... You came all the way back here for me? Yeah. But how'd you... I mean, you don't have any superpowers. I know. Really? Yeah. Wow. Crazy day for you, huh? It's been a lot. Yes, it has. Are you ready for this? No. Me neither. Hey, hey, hey! What is twisting your giblets? Hey, wait. Where'd you get that hamster? Give it. Give it. Hey, wait! Initiating escape. What the... Hey! Lloyd! Block the door! Block the door, block the door, block the door! Superbark. Superbark! Sweet Sister Frances! What did you do to my new truck? You hold on right there! Golly, Ester! Both you boys need serious help! Spicy eyes! We need a ride. I've got a big one. You're welcome. I can't believe it. My whole life I've wanted to see a real live superbark. You are legendary. Mittens? Lf... If I don't chase bad guys, then what am I? I mean, what... Don't worry about it. Being a regular dog is, like, the greatest gig in the world. Okay? Look. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, okay? A littleknown cat secret. You know why we hate dogs? 'Cause we wanna be dogs. We have dog complexes. But what do dogs do? Slobber, sleep, chase tails, chew shoes. You don't exactly need a master's degree. You know, most dogs live in a place like this, and, well, I don't know. They do things like... Out of this? But... But... And this is your dog bowl. What is? This. The entire floor. ""It hits the ground, it goes to the hound."" How cool is that? And on cold nights, this and a ball of yarn... It doesn't get better than that. You... You seem to know a lot about these places. Yeah, I did my time in one of these, but I'm more of an alley cat at heart, you know? Sprung out first chance I got. Never looked back. Rhino is awesome! He's so awesome! He's... He's beyond awesome! He... He's beawesome! He's... I... I am beawesome. I think it's about time I introduced you to the regular dog piece de rÃ©sistance. Go ahead. Stick your head out. Why? Just do it. This... This is awesome! And stick your tongue out. This is totally awesome! Why don't you try it? No, thanks. It's really a dog thing. I have got so much to give I swear I do I may not have nine lives But this one feels brandnew Yes, I've lived a good one I have tried to be true There are some things I never realized Till I met you How the wind feels on my cheeks When I'm barking at the moon There is no home like the one you've got 'Cause that home belongs to you Here I come Back to you There is no home like the one you've got 'Cause that home belongs to you Well, I was in trouble bad I was so confused I may not see in color, babe But I sure can feel blue I have been a lot of things They may not all be true My experience was so mysterious Till I met you Now the sun will rise in the east But I'm barking at the moon There is no home like the one you've got 'Cause that home belongs to you Here I come Back to you There is no home like the one you've got 'Cause that home belongs to you There is no home like the one you've got 'Cause that home belongs to you There is no home like the one you've got 'Cause that home belongs to you Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up. Come on. I've got a surprise for you. Okay, okay. No peeking. All right, now, open them. Bask in the glow, baby. I... Just let me give you the grand tour. Okay? This one, this one's mine, and this one is all yours. Mittens, I... I found this really soft pillow thing for you. And get this. I found some Styrofoam, and I stuffed it inside, which I thought was both kind of creative and ironic. You know what I mean? Mittens, I don't think that... Check it out. Total privacy, and completely soundproof. Yeah, well, I don't think that I... Okay, I lied. It's not soundproof. But you know... Mittens, I can't stay here. What? We're one waffle away from Penny. You're still going back to her? Mittens, she's my person. Ear, ear. Look at me, Bolt. I'm real. Now, how about this? Is that real? Does this look real to you? Or that? Is that real? Or that? How about that, Bolt? She's an actress. She's just pretending. Not Penny. There is no Penny. She's fake. No, you're wrong. She loves me. No, no, Bolt. That's what they do, okay? They act like they love you. They act like they'll be there forever, and then one day they'll pack up all their stuff and move away and take their love with them, and leave their declawed cat behind to fend for herself! They leave her wondering what she did wrong. I... I'm sorry, Mittens, but Penny is different. Then go. Mittens, I... Get out of here, Bolt. I never should've taken pity on you. Mittens... Just get out of here, Bolt! You take care, Mittens. That meat lover's pizza is not loving me back at all. Hey there, Rhino. Morning, cat. Where's Bolt? He's... He's gone. Bolt left? Yeah, but he instructed me to tell you that he had to face the GreenEyed Man alone. Where are you going? To Bolt. But he doesn't need us anymore. Trust me, I've seen it a million times before. In the cold, dark night before the battle, when the steely fangs of evil are sharpened and poised to strike, the hero must go and face his greatest challenge alone. But if Bolt's taught me anything, it's that you never abandon a friend in a time of need. When your teammate's in trouble, you go. Whether they ask or not, you go, not knowing if you're coming back dead or alive... He went the other way. You go! Knowing how deep the shrapnel's going to pierce your hide, you go. Penny. No way. Wow. Bolt. I'm a really big fan of yours, brother. I'm Blake. This is my writing partner, Tom. Tom, say what's up. What's up? Wow! Oh, no. And this is our personal assistant, Billy, who was supposed to wait up on the wire. Bolt, I've admired you for such a long time, and there's something I've always wanted to tell you if I ever got a chance to meet you, and now it's... Okay, Billy, that was horrifying, what you just did. Why don't you make yourself useful. Go get me some breadcrumbs, whole grain. Go. Whole wheat is not the same thing as whole grain, Billy! Not the same, Billy. Do not come at me with whole wheat! Or pumpernickel, Billy! Okay, guys, but I really gotta get going. I know. I know you're a busy dog, but if you've got a second, we'd love to pitch you an idea for your show. Tom's better at pitching. I'll let him take it from here. Tommy's got the spotlight. Wait for it. Aliens. Snap! Aliens? Audiences love aliens. Holler back! It'll be huge, man. Huge. You can't touch us. I love it. But I'll tell you what. If you guys can help me find Penny, that girl from the television show, well, I'd love to hear more about this aliens idea, but on the way. We got a nibble. Don't freak out. This is how you blew it with Nemo. We open, exterior, outer space, late morning... ...a fiery comet to reveal Penny... ...faced by a maneating squid! And as the tractor beam is pulling Penny towards the alien mother ship, we fade to black. And we have a great pop song for the end credits. Talk to your people. We're ready to move on this. He's so on board! There it is! The most terrifying place on Earth. Hello. How are you doing today? Hi. I'm here to see Joe Mateo. At long last, we've arrived at the belly of the beast. The lair of the GreenEyed Man! Rhino! Hold up! Hold up! Why? What's the problem? I'm pumped! Listen, this may be really hard for you to understand, but, you see, sometimes things aren't what they seem to be. I mean, sometimes, sometimes you think something's really real and it's not. And sometimes... All of my training has prepared me for this moment. This is complicated. Die! Die! Prepare yourself, foul manbeast, for I will beat your pancreas with your spleen, and then I will rip your liver out of your... You're so cute with your little whiskers. I had a hamsterjust like you when I was a kid. His name was Mr. Sparkles. Bolt? Bolt! You're okay! You came back. Bolt, I thought I lost you. You're my good boy. Good boy. Okay, people. Let's move it to stage seven and do it for real. I miss him. I know, honey. I do, too. First positions, please. Okay, hold still for me, sweetie. Fifteen, take one. Mark. And action. Professor, I'd like to thank you for granting us access to that labyrinthian mind of yours. You know I'd never do such a thing. Unless it was the only way to save your little girl's life! Penny! Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt! Your dog is nowhere near... Get that dog! Go. Go. Go. It's okay, boy. Come here. Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire! Hey, Wags. Mittens? What are you doing here? Long story short, I was tied to a delusional dog and dragged across the country. But that is not important now. The real question is, what are you doing here? And why aren't you in there? You were right about her, Mittens. She... Well, it wasrt real. No, Bolt. It is real. I was in there just now. I saw her face after you left. She's brokenearted. She doesn't wantjust any dog. She loves you. She's your person, Bolt, and you are her dog. Bolt, you're just gonna have to trust me on this. Mittens, be quiet. No. You need to hear this. No, no seriously. Be quiet. What is it? Penny. Help! Please, help! Help! Hold on! Please! Help! Oh, my gosh, the stage! Yeah. You better run. I'm on your six. What do we do? Just make sure I get inside that building. Bolt? Is anyone still in there? I don't know. Coming through. It's a good day to die! Not on my watch, rodent. Bolt! I knew you'd come back. Bolt. Zoom, zoom. Bolt. Bolt, just go on out. Go. It'll be okay. You're my good boy. I love you. Have you seen my daughter? Has anyone seen my baby? Hey, did you hear that? Yeah. What is that? Quiet. Everyone be quiet. It's the superbark! It's coming from over there! Go, go, go! Come on, let's go! Over here! We found them. They're here. We found them! All right, we got an RT coming through, people. Make a hole! For your own safety, keep moving away from the building. Bolt. I gotta get through. Sweetie! You're okay. You gotta be okay. You're gonna be just fine. She's stable, but we're gonna take her to the hospital just to be safe. I'm so sorry this happened. I can't imagine what you must be feeling. No mother should ever have to go through something like this, but I promise you we're going to make this work for us. I'm talking cover stories, production deals, executive producer credit. This is so great! We quit. No, no! Wait! Let's not make any rash decisions. Let's put a pin in it. I'm afraid your injuries were more severe than we had previously thought, my dear. We had to completely reconstruct your face. Have a look. Well, at least Calico won't be able to recognize me. Calico! Bolt! Aliens. That is totally unrealistic. Absolutely ridonculous. You could say that again. Oh, yeah. Right there, right there. Over. Yeah, that's the spot. Hey, silly doggy. That's a keeper. You wanna go play outside? You wanna go play outside? Let's go! Does that dog look familiar? Nope. I never seen him before in my life. Come on. There is no home Bolt! Come on, buddy! Like the one you've got 'Cause that home belongs to you Nobody listens to me Don't hear a single thing I've said Say anything to soothe me Anything to get you from my head Don't know how I really feel The faith it takes to make like I don't care Don't know how much it hurts To turn around like you were never there Like somehow you could be replaced And I could walk away from the promises we made And swore we'd never break I thought I lost you I thought I lost you When you ran away to try to find me I thought I'd never see your sweet face again I turned around and you were gone And on and on the days went But I kept the moments that we were in 'Cause I hoped in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend And now I got you But I thought I lost you I felt so empty out there And there were days I had my doubts But I knew I'd find you somewhere 'Cause I knew I couldn't live without You in my life for one more day And I swore I'd never break those Promises we made Promises we made I thought I lost you When you ran away to try to find me I thought I'd never see your sweet face again I turned around and you were gone And on and on the days went But I kept the moments that we were in 'Cause I hoped in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend And now I got you But I thought I lost you I told myself I wouldn't sleep Till I'd searched the world from sea to sea I made a wish upon a star I turned around and there you were Now here we are Now here we are Here we are I thought I lost you I thought I lost you, too I thought I lost you Yeah I thought I lost you When you ran away to try to find me I thought I'd never see your sweet face again I turned around and you were gone And on and on the days went But I kept the moments that we were in And I knew in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend And now I got you But I thought I lost you I thought I lost you, too So glad I got you, got you So glad I got you Yeah, yeah I thought I lost you I thought I lost you, too"
Brother Bear,Disney,2000,2003,Animation,"  This is a story from long ago,  when the great mammoths  still roamed our lands.  It's the story  of my two brothers and me.  When the three of us were young,  we were taught  that the world is full of magic.    The source of this magic  is the everchanging lights  that dance across the sky.  The shaman woman of our village  told us that these lights  are the spirits of our ancestors,  and that they have the power  to make changes in our world.  Small things become big.  Winter turns to spring.  One thing always changes  into another.  But the greatest change I ever saw  was that of my brother,  a boy who desperately  wanted to be a man.  Get down. What? Get down! Get down! Kenai.   Never try to milk a caribou.     No. No, don't. No. Come on, don't. No. Hey. Will you two knock it off? That's all right. After today, he won't treat me like that. Oh, right, the big manhood ceremony. Doesn't matter what the spirits say, you'll always be our baby brother. Well, wait till I get my totem. Baby brother. Hey, I said knock it off. The quicker we get these fish, the faster we get to your ceremony. Let's all just try and get along for a few hours. Okay, Denahi? Whatever you say. Okay, Ken... So, what are we waiting for?   Whoo! Whoo! When the Earth was young  and the air was sweet  And the mountains kissed the sky  In the great beyond  With its many paths  Man and nature lived side by side  In this wilderness of danger and beauty  Lived three brothers bonded by love  Their hearts full of joy  They ask now for guidance  Reaching out to the skies up above  Great spirits of all who lived before  Take our hands and lead us  Fill our hearts and souls  with all you know  Show us that in your eyes  We are all the same  Brothers to each other  in this world we remain  Truly brothers all the same  Give us wisdom to pass to each other  And give us strength so we understand  That the things we do  The choices we make  Give direction to all life's plans  To look and wonder  at all we've been given  In a world that's not always as it seems  Every corner we turn  Only leads to another  A journey ends but another begins  Great spirits of all who lived before  Take our hands and lead us  Fill our hearts and souls  with all you know  Show us that in your eyes  We are all the same  Brothers to each other  in this world we remain  Truly brothers all the same  Kenai's back. Kenai. Kenai, are you excited about getting your spirit rock today? It's not a rock. It'll be my totem. Ooh! I'll probably get a sabretooth tiger for bravery, or strength, or greatness. Something that fits me. A mammoth for your fat head? Make sure you get that basket tied up. Don't worry. No stupid bear is gonna get near this fish. Just tie it up. Just tie it up. She's back. Tanana's back. Come on.  Come on, Kenai, let's go. Come on. Tanana's got your rock. Come on. Great spirits of all who lived before  Take our hands and lead us  Fill our hearts and souls  with all you know  Show us that in your eyes  We are all the same  Brothers to each other  in this world we remain  Truly brothers all the same  Brothers all the same  Nana. Hey, Nana. Well, hello there, sweetheart. What a big girl.  When each of us comes of age, the great spirits reveal to us a totem that helps guide us through our lives. Some of us use courage to guide us. Others patience. And some of us beauty. Kenai. You nervous? Excited. You should be. It's a good one. Kenai, I have been to the mountain where the lights touch the earth, and the great spirits have revealed to me your totem. To become a man, your actions must be guided by one thing. Your totem is... Love. What? Yes, love. The bear of love? A love that connects and unites all living things. Who wants to trade? There is no trading. Oh, Kenai, love is the most precious of totems. It reveals itself in unexpected ways. Let love guide your actions, then one day you'll be a man, and we'll place your mark next to those of our ancestors.  Oh. There he is. Come here, lover boy. Leave me alone. Kenai, wait. I'm sorry. What? Your totem, I think it's really great. You do? Yeah. And I made you something. Really? Now when you skip around loving everybody, you'll smell so sweet.  Well, isn't this nice? Instead of fighting, you're giving each other flowers. Yeah, isn't it lovely? He's so in touch with his totem already. Hey, dog breath, go take care of the fish. Sure. Kenai loves me, he loves me not. Kenai loves me, he loves me not. Kenai loves me, he loves... Kenai. Someday I'm gonna just... He's just such a... Hey, bonehead. Just because his totem is wisdom doesn't mean he's wise. I mean, look at him. Kenai loves me, he loves me not. Hi, Denahi. Oh, hi.  Let go! Yeah, the spirits messed up on both of our totems. I felt the same way when Tanana gave me mine. Get out of here. No, really. I said, ""The eagle of guidance? What does that mean?"" But now that I'm older, I know it's about being a leader and keeping an eye on you two. I just want to get my handprint on that wall. Just be patient, Kenai. When you live by your totem, you will. Really? Guarantee it. But come on, the bear of love? I mean, a bear doesn't love anyone. They don't think. They don't feel. I mean, they're...  They're thieves. You didn't tie it up, did you? Uh... You should get the totem of pinheads. Knock it off. We'll just make another basket. We? Oh, no. It took me two weeks to make that basket. Get lover boy to do it. He's the one always messing things up. Typical Kenai. All right, I'll go get your basket. Kenai, wait. Kenai! What?    Kenai!  Kenai! Where'd he go? If we're lucky, far away.   Kenai! Kenai. Sitka, no, you gotta get out of here. What? The bear. Behind you.  Hey, bear, come on. Over here. Come on, bear, come this way.  Denahi! Hold on. Pull.     Sitka. Sitka!  Sitka.  Come on! Sitka! Sitka! Sitka. Sitka! Sitka? Sitka, where are you? Kenai. No. Sitka! Sitka! Denahi, let's find him! Sitka. Sitka, where are you? Sitka!      You ready? For what? For going after the bear. I know what you're feeling, but killing that bear is wrong. Wrong? Our brother is dead and it's because of that monster. I don't blame the bear, Kenai. I see. Killing the bear won't make you a man. Now you're trying to be wise. I'm trying to follow my totem. Why can't you? You really think love has anything to do with being a man? A man wouldn't just sit here and do nothing. Kenai. Don't upset the spirits. Spirits. Thanks for your wisdom. I've got to stop him. You left too soon, Sitka. Your brothers need your guidance.   Ha!        Kenai.         What?         Sitka.       No.  I don't blame the bear, Kenai.  A man wouldn't just sit here  and do nothing.   So, Kenai, you've decided to join the living. Oohhoo. That's quite a bump you've got. That must have been one heck of a ride down the rapids. Tanana?  Ooh.  Nana, you won't believe this. I was at the top of this rock, and all of a sudden...  Kenai, honey. Shhshhshh. I don't speak bear. No. No, no! No!   All right! All right! All right! Would you settle down? Settle! Kenai! Kenai... Kenai. Kenai. This isn't going to work.  Kenai, listen to me. Sitka did this. Strange. Spirits don't usually make these kind of changes. Oh. Oh, my, my, my, my.  Sitka must have something really big planned for you. Yep, yep. You are going to get a whole new perspective on things. Oh! Do you see in black and white or colour? Hey. Listen to me. You got yourself into this mess. If you want to change, take it up with your brother's spirit. You'll find him on the mountain where the lights touch the earth. He'll help you make up for what you've done wrong. But I didn't do anything wrong. Tanana? Tanana! Wait. I didn't do anything wrong. I don't even know how to get there. What happened to them? I don't know. They were here. Now they're gone. Yeah, that's pretty weird. So you're telling me you didn't eat them and you have no idea where they are? Uhuh. Hey, hey, you. You just talked.  Just back away, real slowlike. How did you do that? I knew you had them. Are we there yet? Don't make me turn this formation around. Hey. Wait. Come back. I'm trying to find where the lights... What's he getting worked up about? Maybe the goose pooped on him, eh? Oh, gee. He's looking over here. Let's beat it. This way. No, this way. Thank you very much. Just stay still and... Hey, you two!  Head down. I think he's seen us. Now what? Act like we're not here. We're not here. Shh! What are you doing? You said to... Don't say anything. Shh! Okay. I said, ""Don't say anything."" Um, excuse me. Don't eat us. You won't like us, eh? We're gamey. Yeah. Eat hoofforbrains over there. Pinecone breath. Crusty tail. Twig legs. Big nose.  Sorry. You went too far that time. Okay, I'm sorry. Guys. Yours is bigger than mine. I'm not eating anybody. Oh, whew. That's mighty decent of you, eh. My name's Rutt. This is my brother Tuke. How's it going, Bear? Don't call me that. Sorry, uh...  Mr. Bear? I mean, I'm not a bear. I hate bears. Well, gee, you're one big beaver. No kidding, eh? Do either of you know where the lights touch the earth? Yee... ahh... No. Uh, no. Sorry, bear... Er, beaver. I'm not a beaver, I'm a bear... No, I mean, I'm not a bear. I'm a man. Excuse me. I was transformed into a bear. Magically. I was lifted into the sky by my brother. Uhhuh. Crazy. Gesundheit. No. Fruitcake. Are you okay? No. That bear. Over there. He's crazy. I am not crazy. Whoever said you were? We understand. You do? Oh, yeah, yeah. You see, we're not moose either. We're not? No. We're like, uh... We're like squirrels. Yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah. Beauty, eh? Well, he's actually the squirrel. I'm more of a purebred wolverine. Look at these cuspids.  Give him a little room. Why am I talking to moose? No, we're squirrels, eh. Wolverine. I'll find it myself. Oh, I wouldn't go that way. Why not, eh? Uh, well, there was a reason. You brought it up. I'm trying to...  Ow!    Ow! So, you think of it yet? Well, no, but it's driving me nuts. Ow.  Hey. Is the coast clear? What? Are there any hunters around? Uh... No. Oh, good!  You didn't see the trap? I saw it from a mile away. You must be pretty embarrassed. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. What? You need to get down. Let me help. Oh, wait. Ow! Hold still. Just... Stop that. Ow! If you just... Stop it! It's no use. The only way to get down is to chew your own foot off. I don't need some stupid bear's help. I just need the stick. Okay, here. No, I'll do it myself. Put it back. No, where you found it. Oh. To the left. By the little rock. Here? Yes. Okay. Boy, that tree is strong, huh? You know, when I was little, I was really into climbing trees. All kinds of trees. I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars, maples, birch trees, willow trees... My eyes were watering and my tongue was swollen. From that moment on, I was more careful about what I lick.  Ha! See? It's all about using your head.  That was funny. Do it again. Don't you have someplace to go? Yeah, the salmon run. How about this? I get you down, then we go together. Deal? Yeah, okay, fine. If you can magically get me down, I'll go with you to this... Salmon run. Whatever. But if you can't... You turn around, walk away, and never come back, ever. You swear? Yeah. Pinky swear? Yeah, sure, fine, pinky swear. But this is a human trap and you're just a dumb little bear. There's no way you're going to be able...    Okay, so I'm thinking we travel by day and sleep by night. My bedtime is an hour after sunset...  Run! Yeah, good riddance.   Denahi. Denahi, you found me.  You wouldn't believe what a nightmare this has been. Denahi? It's me. Kenai.      Is he gone? I think he was going... Shh!   Hello. I can't breathe. Why is he chasing me? That's what they do. But it's not like him. Lucky for him, he didn't find us 'cause when I get in a fight, I go all crazy and I'm a raging ball of brown fur.  I mean, I don't want to brag or nothing, but I got some moves. Oh, really? Yep. This first one, well... It's just a little thing I like to call ""The Slasher."" And this one I like to call ""Flying Fury of Death."" Uhhuh. He's coming back. Where? Typical. Yeah, well, the next time we run into that hunter... There is no ""we."" I'm not taking you to any salmon run. What? But you pinky swore. Yeah, well, things change. See you, kid. Wait, uh... The truth is, I got separated from my mom. And now, with this hunter around... Kid, I got my own problems. Come on. Please. Can't we just go together? There's a lot of bears and a ton of fish, and every night we watch the lights touch the mountain. Last year... Wait, wait. What did you say? Lots of bears and fish. No. You know where the lights touch the earth? Yeah! The top of the mountain right by the salmon run. You're kidding me. No, no, they're practically next door. Come on, I'll show you. It'll be great. I promise to help you escape from every trap you walk into. I'm not going to walk into any more... Traps. Come on. What do you say? Sure you can take me to where the lights touch the earth? Yeah, no problem. If you slow me down... I won't, I promise. All right, we leave first thing tomorrow. And keep all that cuddly bear stuff to a minimum, okay, kid? My name's not ""kid."" It's Koda. What's your name? Good day. How's it going, eh? Beauty. So we got a lot to get done today. You want to get started? Yeah. Just give me one sec, eh? Okay. Woooohoo... Just help me crack this. All right.  Ah. You ready now? Almost. Just want to do ""dog facing forward."" Oh, come on. Good. Okay. And go. This a nice patch here. Don't go near this patch here. Something went here. Ahh!  Skinny. Fat. Skinny. Fat. Hey, I've got a mountain to get to. Come on, kid. I told you before. My name's Koda. Say it with me. Ko... Da. Sure your mom didn't ditch you, Koduh? Humph. Rutt. Go away, eh, I'm eating twigs. Rutt. You're breaking my concentration. We should start running, like now! I can't. I'm still digesting, eh. I'll get cramps. Whoa, gee! He's after us! Come on, little brother. Cramp! If you really want to know how me and my mom got separated... I was saving this story for the salmon run, but I'll tell you. It was probably the fifth or sixth most coldest day in my entire life. Sounds good. You should save it. You think so? Oh, yeah. For your friends. Oh. Well, I have this other story. Tell you what. How about no talking? Okay. Then I'll sing. No, no, no.  Tell everybody I'm on my way  Will you stop it? New friends and new places to see  Come on, quit it. Shh! Koda, stop singing.  Yes, I'm on my way  And there's nowhere else  that I'd rather be  Tell everybody I'm on my way  And I'm loving every step I take  With the sun beating down  Yes, I'm on my way  And I can't keep this smile off my face  'Cause there's nothing like  seeing each other again  No matter what the distance between  And the stories that we tell  will make you smile  Oh, it really lifts my heart  So tell them all I'm on my way  New friends and new places to see  And to sleep under the stars  Who could ask for more?  With the moon keeping watch over me  Not the snow, not the rain  can change my mind  The sun will come out, wait and see  And the feeling of the wind in your face  Can lift your heart, whoa  There's nowhere I would rather be  'Cause I'm on my way now  Well and true  I'm on my way now  Hey, hold on, eh? Wait up.  How's it going, bear boy? And, uh, smallish bear. I didn't know you had a little brother. He's cute. Actually, he's... There was this hunter following us. We was thinking if we could maybe just hang out with you guys. Just hang out. Yeah, it'd be fun. If the hunter was going to catch up... Then you'd eat him. That's what we was thinking. We lost the hunter at the glacier. You don't think he'll follow those? They are quite nice. I've got an idea. Okay, this is really weird.  I'm driving. When can I have a turn? It's not as easy as it looks. Just watch what I do. Let's get a back seat or something. I look like you hunted me. Tell everybody I'm on my way  Hey, come on. And I just can't wait to be there  Blue skies ahead  Yes, I'm on my way  Nothing but good times to share  So tell everybody I'm on my way  And I just can't wait to be home  With the sun beating down  Yes, I'm on my way  With nothing but good times to show  I'm on my way  Yes, I'm on my way  Beauty, eh? Okay, here's how I remember it. The snow is white, it's all right. Yellow or green, it's just not clean. I learned that one the hard way. That reminds me. Last year at the salmon run my friend Bucky dared me. But I'd heard of a cub who stuck his tongue to an iceberg. Then he started to float away. To save him they had to rip off his tongue, so now he hath to talk like thith all the time and... Do you ever stop talking? Oh! Look. The night rainbow. You can see the spirits from here. You know about the great spirits? Yeah, my grandma's up there, and my granddad. Mom says the spirits make all the magical changes in the world. Like how the leaves change colour, or the moon changes shapes, or tadpoles change into frogs. Yeah, I get it. You know, for a change, maybe they could just leave things alone. What do you mean? My brother's a spirit. If it wasn't for him, I... I wouldn't be here. You have a brother up there? What happened to him? He was killed by a... By a monster. What's your brother's name? Sitka. Thanks, Sitka. If it weren't for you, I would have never met Kenai. I always wanted a brother. So, you want to play ""I spy""? All right. I'll go first. Okay. I spy something green. Tree? Oh! My turn? Yeah. Okay, I spy something tall. Tree. Okay. I spy something with bark. Tree?  Okay, I spy something, uh... A vertical log. Tree. Okay, I spy something... Tree. My turn. Tree. No, I... It counts. I didn't even spy anything. It counts. Okay. Tree. Let's play something else. Koda. Come on. Koda, wake up. Two more months, Mom. So, where are we? Well, which way? I think it's that way. You think, or you know? That way? Why wasn't I turned into a homing pigeon? Come on. Hey, riding mammoths was your idea. Thanks for the ride, guys. See you. Lucky for you, I've been lost worse than this. Last summer, I was with Bucky... Enough with the stories. I don't care about the time you and Binky found the world's biggest pine cone ever. First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky. Second, it wasn't a pine cone, it was a pine nut. And it was huge. Even bigger than your fat head. Oh, gee, our big guardian bear is leaving, eh? Yeah. We'd better follow him. Come on. Can you swing your leg... I can't get off. Me, neither. Okay, you guys... I guess we'll just catch up with those guys later, eh? Good trip, eh? Beauty. You know, I was thinking now might be a good time for me to drive. Just relax and enjoy the ride. Yeah. Okay. Whee. I'm sorry we're lost, okay? Even though it's your fault. My fault? That's it. Just remember, if it weren't for me, you'd be hanging upside down. Better than being stuck nowhere with you and your blabbering mouth. ""I'm lost. I can't find my mommy. Will you take me to the salmon run?"" Why don't you just grow up? Fine. I'll go on my own then. Fine. Go ahead. Fine. Fine. Fine.  Koda? Koda? Whoa. Those monsters are really scary. Especially with those sticks. Come on, let's go. So, you recognise anything yet? Or maybe you can't see past my fat head.  So, do you really think I have a fat head? Well, if you hunched your shoulders a little it wouldn't seem so big. Oh, you mean like this?  Or like this? How about this? Oh, my, that was good. Maybe they can give us directions.  Oh! That clears up the sinuses. Oh, it does. Okay, okay, hit me again. I think she's looking. Hello, sweetie. Yes, she's checking me out, all right. Hey, baby. No, come on, you nitwit. Are you out of your head? She's looking at me. Like she's looking at your ugly mug? Come on. Excuse me, miss. It's gotime, baby. You want to go? Bring it on. Horns up. Hold on. Excuse me. What do you want?  What is that? Just a minute, bear. Hey, shut up.  No, you shut up. Hey, will you shut up? Just shut up.  Their horns are screwed on too tight. Oh, wait a second. I know this place. You do? Yeah. The salmon run's not far. We just have to go through here. What? Hey, you sure you know where you're going? Yeah, yeah, follow me. Koda? Koda? Koda? Where are you? Yah!  Don't do that. Scared you, didn't I? There's scared, and then there's surprised. And you were both. Whoa! Nice try. Uh, you got a little spit right there. Kenai! You're not getting me this time. No, look out.   No. Come on.   Kenai. Kenai, where are you?  Left. Left. No, the other left.   Kenai!  Whoa! Whoa!   No! What are you doing? We got to get out of here. Ah!         Why do they hate us, Kenai? We're bears. So? So, you know how they are. They're killers. Wait a minute, who's the killers? Bears. What? Which bears? I'm not like that, and you're not like that. Well, obviously not all bears. I mean, you're okay. Most bears will look for any excuse to attack a human. But, Kenai, he attacked us. You're just a cub. When you're older, you'll understand. Fish! Fish! Fish! Huh? We made it. We're here. Come on! What? Koda. Fish! Fish! Fish! Hey. Get away from me. Get away from me. Go on. Shoo!         Huh? Hey, you're stirring up the water, dude. Yeah, try not to scare off the fish there, buddy. Uh... Tug. Hey, Koda. Come here. Look at you. Have you seen my mom yet? No, as a matter of fact I haven't. Me and my friend Kenai beat her. He's with you? Uh... Hi. Huh. I've never seen you at the run before. Where are you from? Well, I... There's the mountain, just like I promised. The lights touch the top every night. Gonna be harder getting up there than riding those mammoths. Mammoths? Are you kidding? That's weird. Yeah. He does weird stuff. Like the way he drinks water with a leaf. He never sharpens his claws on a tree. He's never hibernated before... Koda. Koda.  Can I talk to you for a second? Excuse us. Hmm. He's kind of jumpy, isn't he? Okay. Okay.  Koda, I, uh... Uh, I got to get going. Well, when you come back... I... I won't be coming back. What? Why not? Because... Well, it's hard to... You're leaving? No. Well, I mean, yes. Well, it's just that I... I don't belong here. Don't belong? Every bear belongs here. Come on, buddy. Everyone's invited  Let's have some fun! This is how we live  We're all here for each other  Happy to give  All we have, we share  And all of us, we care  So come on  Welcome to our family time  Welcome to our brotherly time  We're happy giving and taking  to the friends we're making  There's nothing we won't do  Welcome to our family time  Welcome to our happytobe time  This is our festival  You know that best of all  We're here to share it all  There's a bond between us  nobody can explain  It's a celebration of life  And seeing friends again  I'd be there for you  I know you'd be there for me, too  So come on  Welcome to our family time  Welcome to our brotherly time  This is our festival  You know, and best of all  We're here to share it all  Remembering love once departed  Someone dear to your heart  Finding love, planning a future  Telling stories  and laughing with friends  Precious moments you'll never forget  This has to be the most beautiful  The most peaceful place  I've ever been to  It's nothing like I've ever seen before  When I think how far I've come  I can't believe it  Yet I see it  And then I see family  I see the way we used to be  Come on  Welcome to our family time  Welcome to our brotherly time  We're happy giving and taking  to the friends that we're making  There's nothing we won't do  Welcome to our family time  Welcome to our happytobe time  This is our festival  You know, and best of all  You're here to share it  We're here to share it all   All right, settle down, everyone. Settle down. Hey. Don't throw your fish bones there. Somebody could choke on that. Look, okay, I'll go first. Okay, let's see. The most interesting thing that happened to me this year. Hmm...  Oh, I know, I know, I know! Listen to this. It was when I knocked down that tree that was blocking the view from my cave. Now I got a family of chipmunks staying in my place. Yeah. All right, everybody, let me see some paws in the air. Who's gonna be next? Come on. Tug. I got one. Watch me. Hey, gotcha. This year I lost my dear husband Edgar. Quit telling everyone I'm dead! Sometimes I can still hear his voice. I'm getting the next one.    Oh, yeah. This is it. I got it. I got... I guess it's our turn. This is the year I met the most gorgeous... No, you're gorgeous. You're gorgeouser. Get a cave.   If only Edgar was alive... I told you, woman, I'm right here! I love you, buttercup. This has got to be it. Here you go, Koda. You gotta tell it, Kenai. What? Yes. You caught it, you tell it. Didn't you play when you were a cub? Um... Come on, Keno.  Okay, all right already. All right. You want to know what I did this year? Yes. I went on the longest, hardest, most exhausting journey I've ever been on with the biggest pain in the neck I've ever met. What do you expect from a little brother? Okay, buddy, your turn. Let's hear it, Koda. Okay, okay, here we go.  This year I watched my mom in a lifeanddeath struggle battling the most fiercest creature ever. Who's next? What? Wait a minute. I think we all want to hear the rest of that one, Koda. I thought you might say that. Hmm... Let's see. It was probably the fifth or sixth most coldest day in my entire life. Me and Mom were eating fish, having a great time. All of a sudden she pushes me into the bushes and tells me to be real quiet. She says, ""I smell something."" So I started sniffing. There's something in the woods running towards us, getting closer and closer.   And then, out of the trees, jumps a hunter.  And now there's nowhere for Mom to go. The monster has her backed up against this giant glacier. The monster attacks, but Mom's too quick for him. And before he can do it again, she stands up real big and yells, ""Go away.""  Kenai.  Mom smells more of them. There's a whole pack coming right at us. Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you. She runs to stop them  before they get to me.  They're all around her,  poking her with sticks.  Sitka. The whole thing broke and fell off.  There was ice everywhere.  She couldn't hold her breath  any longer, and pow.  She bursts out of the water. I've never been so scared in my life. I'm going after the bear.  Koda? Sitka wouldn't want it.  Sitka's not here  because of that monster.  Whoa. Fell off a glacier? I've never seen anything like that. Can you imagine?  Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai? What happened next? Was she okay? Hey, Kenai, what's wrong? Where you going? She got out of the water okay. That's how we got separated. Right after that I met Kenai. Kenai?  Scared you again, huh? Yeah. Where have you been? You look horrible. Koda... My mom says when you eat too much fish, just lie down. There's something I, uh... You know that story you told me last night? Yeah. Well, I have a story to tell you. Really? What's it about? Well, it's kind of about a man, and kind of about a bear. But mostly it's about a monster. A monster who did something so bad... Everywhere I turn I hurt someone  But there's nothing I can say  to change the things I've done  I'd do anything within my power  I'd give everything I've got  But the path I seek  is hidden from me now  Koda, I did something very wrong. Brother bear, I let you down  I don't like this story. You trusted me, believed in me  and I let you down  Your mother's not coming. Of all the things I hid from you  I cannot hide the shame  And I pray someone  No. No! Something will come  to take away the pain  There's no way out  Of this dark place  No, no future  I know I can't be free  But I can't see another way  And I can't face another day  Koda? Koda? Koda! Koda, I wish I could... If there was just some way... I'd give anything if... If I could just...  I'm sorry, Koda. I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry, Kenai. I don't know what I'm doing any more. I need help. Sitka. Look, I am sorry. If I was driving this never would have happened. You never let me do nothing. Trample off. I said sorry. Let it go. I can't believe you totalled a mammoth. That mountain came out of nowhere. I cannot accept your apology. It was in my blind spot... Look. It's that little cub. Gee, eh, something's bugging him. What's wrong, smallish bear? Nothing. I'm fine.  Good. Where were we? Oh, yeah. You're a big, selfish, reckless hoofer. What? I'm fed up with it. From now on, he's my new brother. You can't do that. Sorry, you've been replaced with my dear brother... What's your name again? I don't want any more brothers. See? He's had enough of you, too. I promise I'll change. Trample off. You won't. Being a brother means nothing to you. Of course it does. Like what? What about when your hooves froze in the pond? Who sat with you all winter, eh? You did. Who showed you where the good grazing is? The really tender stuff all covered in dew. Now, why do you think I did that, eh? Because I... Because I love... dew. Excuse me? I don't believe I heard what you said. I said, ""I love dew."" I love dew, too, eh. Hey, I can change. Go away, eh. Come on, I can change. Go away, eh, don't touch me. I can change. Hey. No. Not there, that's the spot. Like, we'll see you later, smallish bear. Yeah, good day, eh. You know what this calls for? A pile of delicious barley and amber weed on a cool bed of malted hops. I like it.  Sitka! Sitka, are you there? Sitka? Please. Please, Sitka. I don't know what else to do. Sitka. Denahi.  Sitka, hurry, change me back. Where are you, Sitka?  Denahi. Denahi, please. Koda.  No! Leave him alone. Koda!    Kenai? Sitka?  Koda, don't be afraid. It's me. He needs me. You know, he did look better as a bear. But, Denahi... It's all right, Kenai.  No matter what you choose, you'll always be my little brother.   Did I say little?  Kenai.   My brother Kenai went on  to live with Koda and the other bears.  He taught me  that love is very powerful.   And I passed on the wisdom  of his story to our people.  The story of a boy who became a man  by becoming a bear.  Great spirits of all who lived before  Take our hands and lead us  Fill our hearts and souls  with all you know  Show us that in your eyes  We are all the same  Brothers to each other  in this world we remain  Truly brothers all the same  Brothers all the same   So, like, uh, what are you doing there, smallish bear? I'm practising my moves. Want to see one? Sure, eh. This ought to be good, eh?   Listen to me. I was a man that was changed into a bear. No beaver. Man into bear. That's it. Oh. Yeah, so, before that you was probably like a goat? What about a water buffalo? No, he's a rabbit. Look at his ears and furry feet. Watch out for the rabbit, eh. No way, eh. Okay, now, everyone, take a big inhale, eh? And then on... On the exhale, shift into salutation to the sun.  No, you shut up.    How you doing over there, Koda? Oh, pretty good.   In accordance with all federal and state wildlife regulations, no fish were harmed during the making of this film.  No! He's gonna eat me!  Cut. Cut. Somebody, help me. Help me. Somebody.  Ooh! "
Cars,Disney,2000,2006,Animation,"OK... Here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed. One winner, 42 losers. I eat losers for breakfast. Breakfast. Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast. A little brecky could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused. Speed. I'm faster than fast. Quicker than quick. I am lightning! Hey, Lightning! You ready? Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready Get your antenna balls here! Go, Lightnin'! You got that right, slick. Welcome back to the Dinoco 400. I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip. We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.  Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof.  If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!  Right you are, Darrell.  Three cars are tied for the season points lead,  heading into the final race of the season.  And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.  Does The King, Strip Weathers,  have one more victory in him before retirement?  He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!  Can he win them one last Piston Cup?  And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks.  He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.  Chick thought this was his year, Bob.  His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.  But the last thing he expected was...  ...Lightning McQueen!  You know, I don't think anybody expected this.  The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.  But everyone knows him now.  Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?  The legend, the runnerup, and the rookie!  Three cars, one champion!  No, you don't. What a ride! Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em! I love you, Lightning! Dinoco is all mine. Trouble, turn three! Get through that, McQueen. A huge crash behind the leaders! Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage. There's no way the rookie can make it through! Not in one piece, that is. Yeah! Lightning! Look at that! McQueen made it through! Man, a spectacular move by Lightning McQueen! Yeah! Kachow! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! Yeah, McQueen! Kachow! While everyone else heads into the pits, McQueen stays out to take the lead! Don't take me out, coach. I can still race! What do you think? A thing of beauty. McQueen made it through! What? He's not pitting! You gotta get me out there! Let's go! Get me back out there! McQueen's not going into the pits! The rookie just fired his crew chief. That's the third one this season! He says he likes working alone. Go, go, go! Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits. Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up. Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart! Come on, come on, come on! We need tires now! Come on, let's go! No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas! What? You need tires, you idiot! Looks like it's all gasandgo's for McQueen today. That's right. No tires again. That's a shortterm gain, longterm loss, but it's sure workin' for him. He obviously knows somethin' we don't know. This is it, Darrell. One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead. He's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire! We're gonna crown us a new champion! Checkered flag, here I come! Oh, no! McQueen has blown a tire! And with only one turn to go! Can he make it? You fool! McQueen's blown a tire! McQueen's blown a tire! Go, go, go! He's lost another tire! King and Chick are coming up fast! They're entering turn three! Come on. I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob! Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup! The King and Chick rounding turn four. Down the stretch they come! And it's, and it's... It's too close to call! Too close! I don't believe it! Lightning! The most spectacular, amazing... I don't believe it! ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world! And we don't know who won! Look at that! Hey, no cameras! Get outta here! We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results.  McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires.  Tell me about it!  Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?  Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing than just winning.  I mean, taking the race by a full lap... Where's the entertainment in that?  I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.  Sizzle? Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?  No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm a oneman show.  What? Oh, yeah, right.  That was a confident Lightning McQueen.  Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz. Get outta the shot. Yo, Chuck, what are you doing? You're blockin' the camera! Everyone wants to see the bolt. What? Now, back away. That's it! Come on, guys. Whoa, team! Where are you going? We quit, Mr. OneMan Show! Oh, OK, leave. Fine. How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas? AdiÃ³s, Chuck! And my name is not Chuck! Oh, whatever. Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen! Seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there. By me! Oh, yeah. Zinger! Welcome to the Chick era, baby! The Piston Cup... It's mine, dude. It's mine. Hey, fellas, how do you think I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue! In your dreams, Thunder. Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, ""Thunder""? You know, 'cause thunder always comes after lightning. Who knew about the thunder thing? I didn't. Give us the bolt! That's right. Right in the lens. Show me the bolt, baby! Smile, McQueen! Show me the bolt, McQueen! That's it! That was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud. Thank you, King. Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years. It's the least I could do. Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit. Thanks, dear. Wouldn't be nothing without you. I'm Mia. I'm Tia. We're, like, your biggest fans! Kachow! I love being me. OK, girls, that's it. We love you, Lightning! Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer. Oh, hey, Mr. The King. You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body. Really? Oh, that... But you're stupid. Excuse me? This ain't a oneman deal, kid. You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team. You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should. Like I tell the boys at the shop... A good team. Yeah... Oh, Lightning! If you figure that out you just gonna be OK. Oh, yeah, that... That is spectacular advice. Thank you, Mr. The King. Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in Piston Cup history... A rookie has won the Piston Cup. Yes! ...we have a threeway tie. Hey, McQueen, that must be really embarrassing. But I wouldn't worry about it. Because I didn't do it! Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race between the three leaders will be held in California in one week. Well, thank you! Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you! Hey, rook, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. No, not me! No, you rock, and you know that! Oh, yeah! ""First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself."" Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick. Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie. I don't want to talk about it. Let's go, Mack. Saddle up. What'd you do with my trailer? I parked it at your sponsor's tent. What? Gotta make your personal appearance. No. No! No, no, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here.  And I use Rusteze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!  Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rusteze.  Wow! Look at that shine!  Use Rusteze and you too can look like me!  Kachow!  I met this car from Swampscott. He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow. You could see his dirty undercarriage. I hate rusty cars. This is not good for my image. They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract. Oh, will you stop, please? Just go get hooked up. Winter is a grand old time. Of this there are no ifs or buts. But remember, all that salt and grime... Can rust your bolts and freeze your... Hey, look! There he is! Our almost champ! Get your rear end in here, kid. Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast! That race was a pisser! You were booking! Give me a little room. You're my hero! Yes, I know. ""Fred."" Fred, thank you. He knows my name. He knows my name! Looking good, Freddie! Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year! We might clear enough to buy you some headlights. You saying he doesn't have headlights? That's what I'm telling ya. They're stickers! Well, you know, racecars don't need headlights, because the track is always lit. Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights. Ladies and gentlemen, Lightning McQueen! Free Bird!  You know, the Rusteze Medicated Bumper Ointment team ran a great race today. And remember, with a little Rusteze... And an insane amount of luck, ...you too, can look like me. Kachow. Hey, kid. We love ya. And we're looking forward to another great year. Just like this year! Not on your life. Don't drive like my brother! Yeah, don't drive like my brother! California, here we come!  Dinoco, here we come! I needed this. Hello? Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?  Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent? It's such an honor to be your agent  it almost hurts to take ten percent of your winnings.  Merchandising. And ancillary rights in perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!  I didn't see it, but I heard you were great.  Thanks, Harv. Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.  I'll pass 'em on to your friends. Shoot me the names.  You let Harv rock it for you.  Right. Friends. Yes, there's... OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.  So many you can't even narrow it down. Hey, when you get to town,  you better make time for your best friend!  Break bread with your mishpocheh here!  That'd be great! We should totally... OK, I gotta jump, kid. Let me know how it goes. I'm out.  What? A minivan? Come on, you're in the slow lane. This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling.  Just stopping off for a quick breather, kid. Old Mack needs a rest. Absolutely not.  We're driving all night till we get to California. We agreed to it.  All night? May I remind you federal DOT regs state... Come on, I need to get there before Chick and hang with Dinoco.  All those sleeping trucks. Hey, kid, I don't know if I can make it.  Oh, sure you can, Mack. Look, it'll be easy. I'll stay up with you. All night?  All night long. Hey, yo, D.J. What up? We got ourselves a nodder. Pretty music. Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man. Right back at ya! Yeah! Oops! I missed. You going on vacation? Oh, no, Snot Rod... He's gonna blow! Gesundheit! One should never drive while drowsy. Mack! Mack! Mack! Hey, Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack, wait for me! Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack... ...wait up! Mack. Mack! Mack! What? You're not Mack. Mack? I ain't no Mack! I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake! Turn on your lights, you moron! Mack... The Interstate! Not in my town, you don't. Oh, no. Oh, maybe he can help me! He's shooting at me! Why is he shooting at me? I haven't gone this fast in years. I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'. Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine! What in the blue blazes? Crazy hotrodder. I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower. The sixties weren't good to you, were they? What? That's not the Interstate! No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm not the only one seeing this, right? Incoming! Whoa, man. No! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! My tires! Fly away, Stanley. Be free! Boy, you're in a heap of trouble. We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway  as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen,  is arriving at the track.  Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl ?  Lightning, what's your strategy?  What? Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?  McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing.  McQueen was reported missing. ...to race an unprecedented...  Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.  I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him. I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!  Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!  They're all asking the same question: Where is McQueen?  Oh, boy. Where am I? Mornin', sleepin' beauty! Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up. Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me! A parking boot? Why do I have a parking boot on? What's going on here? Please! You're funny. I like you already. My name's Mater. Mater? Yeah, like ""tuhmater,"" but without the ""tuh"". What's your name? You don't know my name? No, I know your name. Is your name Mater too? What? Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible. Where am I? Where are you? Shoot! You're in Radiator Springs. The cutest little town in Carburetor County. Oh, great. Just great! Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town. You know, I'd love to see the rest of the town! So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off, you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene... Dadgum! How'd that be, Tuhmater? Cool! Mater! What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused? To not to. Well, quit your yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court. Well, we'll talk later, Mater. ""Later, Mater."" That's funny! The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order! Hey, you scratched my paint! I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man! You brokea the road! You a very bad car! Fascist! Commie! Officer, talk to me, babe. How long is this gonna take? I gotta get to California, pronto. Where's your lawyer? I don't know. Tahiti maybe. He's got a timeshare there. When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him. Hey! Anyone want to be his lawyer? Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff! All rise! The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding. Showoff. May Doc have mercy on your soul. All right, I wanna know who's responsible for wreckin' my town, Sheriff. I want his hood on a platter! I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots! No, check that. I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot. I'm... Throw him out of here, Sheriff. I want him out of my courtroom. I want him out of our town! Case dismissed. Yes! Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyerin' stuff. Sorry I'm late, Your Honor! Holy Porsche! She's gotta be from my attorney's office. Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set. He's letting me go. He's letting you go? Yeah, your job's pretty easy today. All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you. Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Me, you, dinner. What the...? Please! I know. I get that reaction a lot. I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you? A little bit, but I'll be all right. OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge. Do what you gotta do, baby. But listen. Be careful. Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean. Kaching! I'll keep that in mind. Hey there, Mater. Howdy, Sally. Hi, folks! Good morning! You know her? She's the town attorney and my fiancÃ©e. What? Nah, I'm just kiddin'. She just likes me for my body. You look great. You do something different with your side view mirrors? What do you want, Sally? Come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this. No. I know his type. Racecar. That's the last thing this town needs. OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice. Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history. Here she goes again. Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road! It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers on our stretch of that road. Travelers? What travelers? Ignore him. But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on? Luigi, what do you have at your store? Tires. And if no one can get to you? I won't sell any... tires. I will lose everything! Flo, what do you have at your store? I have gas. Lotsa gas! OK boys, stay with me. And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas? I'll go outta business and... we'll have to leave town. What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station? Without gas, we're done for! What? Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road? The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al! Lizzie, the guy left, like, 15 years ago. Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon? Oh, he can do it. He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him to do? Fix the road! Because we are a town worth fixing! Yeah! Order in the court! Seems like my mind has been changed for me. Yeah! No! Nice ruling. I am so not taking you to dinner. That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie. Man, you get to work with Bessie! I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that. Bessie? Who's Bessie? This here is Bessie, finest roadpavin' machine ever built. I'm hereby sentencing you to community service. You'll fix the road under my supervision. What? This place is crazy! I know this may be a bad time right now, but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees. What? We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice. You gotta be kidding me. You start there where the road begins. You finish down there where the road ends. Holy shoot! Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take? Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days. Five days? But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now! Then if I were you, I'd quit yappin' and start workin'! Hook him up, Mater. Okaydokey. Freedom! Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie... ...and then... then took the boot off. Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie! California, here I come! Yeah! Oh, feel that wind. Yes! No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas? How can I be outta gas? Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are. But how did, how did... you...? We siphoned your gas while you were passed out. Kachow. Gentlemen. Sheriff. Hey, Sheriff. Why tires here? Sono sempre stati qui.  They were better before. Stai sempre a parlare.  Guido! Red, can you move over? I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod. You know, I used to be a purty good whistler. I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it. He can fix about anything. That's why we made him the judge. Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddyup, Oom Papa Mow Mow.  Now, I'm not one to brag but people come purty far to see me get low on the ""MowMow"". Man, that's just great! Hey, what's wrong? My lucky sticker's all dirty. That ain't nothin'. I'll clean it for ya. No, no, no! That won't be necessary. Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red! I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off. Where's he goin'? He's a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers. I shouldn't put up with this. I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics. You hurt your what? I'm a very famous racecar! You are a famous racecar? A real racecar? Yes, I'm a real racecar. What do you think? Look at me. I have followed racing my entire life. My whole life! Then you know who I am. I'm Lightning McQueen. Lightning McQueen? Yes! Yes! I must scream it to the world! My excitement from the top of some place very high! Do you know many Ferraris? No, no, no, no, no. They race on the European circuit. I'm in the Piston Cup! What? Luigi follow only the Ferraris. Is that what I think it is? Customers. Customers! Customers, everyone! Customers! OK! Customers? It's been a long time. Remember what we rehearsed. Make sure your ""Open, please come in"" signs are out. You all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go! Van, I just don't see any onramp anywhere. Minny, I know exactly where we are. Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere. Honey, please. Hello. Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley. Legendary for its service and hospitality. How can we help you? We don't need anything, thank you. Ask for directions to the Interstate. There's no need to ask for directions. I know where we're going. He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee. We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we... OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK? What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel. No, it doesn't agree with my tank. Just trying to find the Interstate. Good to see you, soldier! Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs. Honey, surplus! We have too much surplus. I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel. And if you stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast. Honey, she's got a map. I don't need a map! I have the GPS. Never need a map again, thank you. How 'bout somethin' to drink? Stop at Flo's VEight CafÃ©. Finest fuel on Route 66. No we just topped off. And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires, home of the Leaning Tower of Tires. We're trying to find the Interstate. But you do need a paint job. Ramone will paint you up right. Hey, anything you want! You know, like a flame job. No thanks... Maybe ghost flames! You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style? Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch. OK, no. We're gonna be going now, OK? A little somethin' to remember us by, OK? OK! Come back soon, OK? I mean, you know where we are! Tell your friends! OK! Yes. You bet. Thanks again, folks. Byebye now. Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I know how to get to the Interstate! Do ya? Minny, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, not really. But listen. I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar. I'm being held against my will. I need you to call my team, so they can come rescue me and get me to California in time for me to win the Piston Cup. Understand? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, it's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here! I'm in hillbilly hell! My IQ's dropping by the second! I'm becoming one of them! OK, don't worry. They know where we are now. They'll tell friends. You'll see. We'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...  That's good. ...after a Piston Cup update.  Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Chick Hicks arrived in California  and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.  It's just nice to get out here before the other competitors.  You know, get a head start. Gives me an edge.  Yeah! Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out. Let me get this straight. I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right? That's what they done did said. OK. Outta my way. I got a road to finish. He's done! Done? It's only been an hour. I'm done. Look, I'm finished. Say thank you, and I'll be on my way. That's all you gotta say. I'm the first one on the new road! It rides purty smooth. It looks awful! Well, it matches the rest of the town. Red. Who do you think you are? Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go. That was the deal. The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse. Now, scrape it off! Start over again. Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar. Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you. What? Me and you. Is that a joke? If you win, you go and I fix the road. If I win, you do the road my way. Doc, what're you doin'? I don't mean to be rude here, but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what? Threepointfive years? Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about. You know what, oldtimer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race. Gentlemen, this will be a onelap race. You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back. There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin', no bitin', no road rage, no maimin', no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no roadhoggin'... ...and no lollygaggin'. Speed. I'm speed. Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer. My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop. Peet stop! The race is only one lap, guys. Uno lappo! Don't need any help. I work solo mio . Fine. Race your way. No pit stoppo. Comprendo? OK. Gentlemen... ...start your engines! Â¡Hijole! Check that out! Whoa. Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done. Luigi? On your mark, get set... Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to... I can't believe it. Go! Doc... the flag means go. Remember the fl... Here we go. Go. Doc, what are you doing, man? Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start. Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater. Might need a little help. OK. You got your tow cable? Well, yeah, I always got my tow cable. Why? Just in case. No, no, no, no, no! Oh, man! Whoa. Bad trip, man. Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac or was that stingin' like a Beemer? I'm confused. You drive like you fix roads. Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater. I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash! Thank you, Mater. Thank you. I can make a little turn on dirt. You think? No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here! Hey, Ã©se ! You need a new paint job, man! No, thank you. How 'bout some organic fuel? That freak juice? Pass. Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty. Anybody else want somethin' to drink? Nah, not me, Flo. I'm on one of them there special diets. I'm a precisional instrument of speed and aeromatics. ""You race like you fix roads."" I'll show him. I will show him! Great! I hate it! Hate, hate, hate, hate it! Music. Sweet music. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Radiator Springs. A happy place! Oh, OK Bessie. You think that's funny? Great! I'm talking to Bessie now! I'm talking to Bessie! Wow. Mornin', Sally! Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made! Yes! Amazing! Yeah! Ramone! Mama ain't seen you that low in years. I haven't seen a road like this in years. Well, then let's cruise, baby. Low and slow. Ã bellissima! It's beautiful! Guido, look, it'sa like it was paved by angels. Boy, I tell you what. I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth. Doc, look at this! Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh? Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go. Guido, look at Luigi! This is fantastico ! That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn! Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump. That crazy old devil woman. She's right! Guido! That punk actually did a good job. Well, now... where the heck is he? Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it? No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, and asked me if he could come down here. All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn. No, no, no, no! Oh, great. Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on. Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's. I'll keep an eye on him. Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feelin' a quart low. This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt. Oh, great. What do you want? You here to gloat? You don't have threewheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips. So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert. I'll put it simple. If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right. Right. That makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you! Or should I say, ""No, thank you""? Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, ""Thank you""! Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot! Turn right to go left. Oh, that... Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it. You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right! You keep talkin' to yourself, people'll think you're crazy. Thanks for the tip. What? I wasn't talkin' to you! Oh, Guido, Ã¨ bellissimo ! Che cosa?  It looks great! This is great! Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.  Oh, Lord. Mater! I need you to watch the prisoner tonight. Well, dadgum! Wait a minute. What if he tries to run again? Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back. But keep an eye on him. Yes, sir! While I'm stuck here paving this stinkin' road, Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco. My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who's touching me? You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix. You makea such a nice new road. You come to my shop. Luigi takea good care of you. Even though you not a Ferrari. You buy four tires, I give you a fulla size spare absolutely free! Look, I get all my tires for free. I like your style, eh? You drive the hard bargain. OK. Luigi make you a new deal. You buy one tire, I give you three for free! Would you look at that? Ramone, Ramone! Then Luigi make you a new new deal. No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you. No, no, no, no. No. This is it. My last offer. You buy one tire, I give you sevena snow tires for free! Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am. Stop! Let me... Oh, Red, you missed a spot. See it right there? No! No! On the hood right there. Stop, stop! That's cold! Help! Please! Stop! Thanks, Red. What was that for? Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone? Huh? If you do, you gotta be clean. 'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards. What, I...? I don't get it. I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job. So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me! But there. Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone. And I'd be in my cone, and it's... Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me. If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine. I understand you criminal types. No, no, no, no. That's OK. Yeah, the Cozy Cone. It's newly refurbished. Yeah, it's like a clever little twist. The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid. But now we're gonna stay in them. That's funny. Figure that all out on your own, did you? Cone number one, if you want. Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there? That's just a... You saw that? Yeah. Just gonna be going. Gonna... Yeah. You know, I once knew this girl Doreen. Goodlookin' girl. Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck! You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her. What are you talking about? I don't know. Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you! No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here. Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt. You probably couldn't handle it anyway. Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater. You know who you're talkin' to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything. Mater, I'm not doin' this. Oh, come on. You'll love it! Tractortippin's fun. This is ridiculous. All right, listen. When I say go, we go. But don't let Frank catch you. Go! Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank? Mater! Wait, Mater! OK, here's what you do. You just sneak up in front of 'em, and then honk. And they do the rest. Watch this. I swear, tractors is so dumb! I tell you what, buddy, it don't get much better than this. Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy. I don't care who you are, that's funny right there. Oh, your turn, bud. Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn. Baby. I'm not a baby. Fine. Stop! Stop, OK? All right. I'll do something. That's Frank. Run! Here he comes, look out! Run! He's gonna get ya! Customers! No, no, no. Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghostlight! I can't wait, Mater. Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya! Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun! Oh, yeah... yeah. Well, we better get you back to the impound lot. You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel. Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we? Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding? Besides, she can't stand me. And I don't like her, to be honest. Yeah, you probably right. Hey, look, there's Miss Sally! Where, where? You're in love with Miss Sally. No, I'm not. Yes, you do. No way. Way. Come on, look... You're in love with Miss Sally! Real mature. You're in love! Real grown up. You love her. You love her. Wait... You love her! You love her. You love her. All right. OK. Mater, enough! Will you stop that? Stop what? Driving backwards. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck. Wreck? Shoot! I'm the world's best backwards driver! You just watch this right here, lover boy. What are you doing? Watch out! Look out! Mater? Mater! Mater! Hey, take it easy, Mater! He's nuts. No need to watch where I'm goin'. Just need to know where I've been. Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that? Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want. Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race. What's so important about this race of yours, anyway? It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup! I've been dreaming about it my whole life! I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it. And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters. No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars. What's wrong with rusty old cars? Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. You know? Not like you. I like you. It's OK, buddy. Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters? I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. You mean it? Oh, yeah. Anything you say. I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice! In what? My best friend. See you tomorrow, buddy! McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree,  Kissomethin'somethin'somethin't!  Number one. Number one... Number one! This is nice. Hey, Stickers. I'm sorry. You scared me. You gotta be careful. I scared myself scaring you scaring me. I mean, I wasn't like ""scared"" scared. No, of course not. No. I was more... I overheard you talkin' to Mater. When? Just now? What, what did, what did you hear? Something about a helicopter ride. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick out of that, didn't he? Did you mean it? What? That you'll get him a ride. Who knows? First things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race. You know... Mater trusts you. Yeah, OK. Did you mean that? What? Was it just a ""Yeah, OK"", or ""Yeah... OK"" or ""Yeah, oOK""? Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day. Yeah, OK. G'night. Hey, thank you. What did you just say? You know, thanks for lettin' me stay here. It's nice to be out of the impound, and this is... It's great. Newly refurbished, right? Yeah. G'night. Good night. Will you turn that disrespectful junk off? Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix! No! I gotta get outta here! Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? Oh! Oh, my gosh. Hey, what are you doin'? Get a good peek, city boy? I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff. Wait for him at Flo's. Get outta here. I've been trying to get outta here for three days! Hope you enjoyed the show! Whoa, Doc. Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on. What? He has a Piston Cup? Oh, my gosh. Three Piston Cups? Sign says stay out. You have three Piston Cups. How could you have... I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read. You're the Hudson Hornet! Wait at Flo's, like I told ya! Of course. I can't believe I didn't see it before. You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! You used to hold the record for most wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk. You gotta show me your tricks. Please. I tried that. You won three times! Look at those trophies! You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups. You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man. Oh, take a car wash, hippie. Yeah, look at my husband, y'all! That's your color! Yellow, baby. You smokin' hot! There he is. Oh, my gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous racecar? Doc? Our Doc? Not Doc Hudson. No, no, no, no, it's true! He's a real racing legend. He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour. I mean, have you ever seen him race? No, but I wish I could have. They say he was amazing! He won three Piston Cups! He did what in his cup? I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy! Well, I'll say! Look how red he is. Yeah, I think he needs a new coat of poly, man. Are you sick, buddy? You are lookin' peaked. He needs a new coat of poly for sure! Hey, hey! What are you doin'? It's OK, Sheriff. You can trust me, right? I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about. I trust him. Come on, let's take a drive. A drive? Yeah, a drive. Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive? No. No, we don't. Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what? And you thought he was gonna run. Hey, can you believe it, man? He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar! That's so too much! OK, you got me out here. Where are we goin'? I don't know. Whoa! Yes. Wow. What is this place? Wheel Well. Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road. This place? Yeah, imagine. Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here. You know, I don't get you. How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this? Well, it's really pretty simple. I was... ...an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and... Oh, you were, were you? Were you rich? What? Just... clues to the puzzle. Yeah, OK. Well, that was my life. And you know what? It never felt... happy. Yeah. I mean... really? Yeah. So I left California. Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in. Well, they all did. And I never left. Yeah. You know, I understand. You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries. But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back? I fell in love. Yep. Corvette? No. I fell in love with this. Whoa. Look at that. Look, they're drivin' right by. They don't even know what they're missing! Well, it didn't used to be that way. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist. Really? Yeah. Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way. How do you mean? The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate. It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved. Mornin'! Nice day, huh? Cars didn't drive on it to make great time. They drove on it to have a great time. Well, what happened? The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving. How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that. But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map. Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive. I had a great time. It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while. You're welcome. Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK? Wha... what? Oh, man, the paint's still wet! No, no, no, no! Get out of the store! Hey! Don't eat the radial! Here, takea the snow tires. Mater! I wasn't tractortippin'! Then where did all these goldurn tractors come from? Whoa, boy! Hey! Hey, guys! There's one goin' this way. I got it. Come here, little tractor, come here. Yeah, that's a good tractor. No, no, no, no, come here. What are you doing? You're not supposed to go wandering off all... ...alone. What are you doin' with those old racin' tires? Come on, Doc, drive. Yeah. Wow. You're amazing! What are you doin'? Doc, wait! Giddup right in there! Come on, Rusty. Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible! Wonderful. Now, go away. Hey, I mean it. You've still got it! I'm askin' you to leave. Come on. I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same. We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out. How could a car like you quit at the top of your game? You think I quit? Right. Your big wreck in '54. They quit on me. When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome. You know what they said? ""You're history."" Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line. There was a lot left in me. I never got a chance to show 'em. I keep that to remind me never to go back. I just never expected that that world would... ...would find me here. Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them. Oh, yeah? No, I'm not. When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod? You name me one time and I will take it all back. I didn't think so. These are good folk around here, who care about one another. I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on. Oh, like you? You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are? Who's caring about only himself? Just finish that road and get outta here! Will you turn that disrespectful junk off? Respect the classics, man. He's done. He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'. Good riddance. He's gone? Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his. Oh, dude, are you crying? No! I'm happy! I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore! I'm glad he's gone! What's wrong with Red? Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about your whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about. Wait a minute! I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. What are you doin' here? You're gonna miss your race. Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time. Thank you, Sheriff. But you know I can't go just yet. Well, why not? I'm not sure these tires can get me all the way to California. Peet stop? Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens? I can'ta believe it! Four new tires! Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!  Would you look at that! Our first real customer in years! I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life! All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got. No! No, no, no. You don'ta know what you want. Luigi know what you want. Blackwall tires. They blend into the pavement. Buta this... Whitewall tires! They say, ""Look at me! Here I am! Love me."" All right, you're the expert. Oh, and don't forget the spare. Perfetto. Guido! Peet stop! What did Luigi tell you? Wow, you were right. Better than a Ferrari, huh? No. Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before? It's a conspiracy, man! The oil companies got a grip on the government! They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man. OK, I'll take a case. Yeah. Kachow. Here she comes! Places, everybody. Hurry! Act natural. Hi, Sally. Buon giorno!  All right, what's goin' on? Ladies and gentlecars, please welcome the new Lightning McQueen! What do you think? Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me. I'll say. Kachow. You're gonna fit right in in California. My goodness. It looks like you've helped everybody in town. Yeah, everybody except one. Hey, is it getting dark out? What? What'd he say? Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out? Now, what was I supposed to do after that? They fixed their neon! Low and slow? Oh, yeah, baby! Just like in its heyday, right? It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you. Shall we cruise? Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to! No, no, no. Lizzie! I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him. Hey, Miss Sally. May I have this cruise? Of course, Mater. ...and again and I said, ""No."" He asked me again, and I said, ""No."" But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a twocylinder. Finally I said, ""All right, one little drive."" Hey! Thanks, Mater. Good evenin', you two. Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this. Is that what I think it is? Oh, I don't know, Flo. I haven't had a chance to find out. But I am going to find out. Hello. Not that. That. Customers? Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em! You know what to do. Just like we rehearsed. It's the ghostlight! We have found McQueen. We have found McQueen! McQueen, over here! Wait, excuse me. Is it true you've been in rehab? Did you have a nervous breakdown? What? McQueen's wearing whitewalls! Your tires balding? Stickers! Was McQueen your prisoner? Shoot, no! We're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin', but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape. Sally! Sally! Will you still race for the Piston Cup? Stickers? Sally! Come on, give us some bolt! You're here! Thank the manufacturer! You're alive! Mack? You're here! I can't believe it! You are a sight for sore headlights! I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you! Mack, I, I can't believe you're here. Is that the world's fastest racing machine?  Is that Harv? Yeah. He's in the back. Show us the bolt! Get back, you oilthirsty parasites! Where's the old McQueen? Actually, this is my good side here. Harv! Harv! Give us the bolt! Harv? Come on! Kid, I'm over here!  How you doin', buddy? My star client disappears off the face of the earth!  How do you think I'm doing?  I can explain. I'm doing great! You're everywhere! Radio, TV, the papers!  You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for?  That's just a figure of speech, by the way. You signed a contract.  Where are you? I can't even find you on my GPS.  I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs. You know Route 66? It's still here! Yeah, that's great, kid.  Playtime is over, pal.  While the world's been trying to find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.  Who are they gonna woo?  Chick! Bingo. In fact, check out what's on the plasma right now.  Show us the thunder! You want thunder?  You want thunder? Kachicka, kachicka!  Hey, that's my bit! You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!  Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, you hear me?  Just give me a second here, Harv. No, wait. Where are you goin'?  Get in the trailer, baby. Kid! You want a bigger trailer?  Sally, I... I want you to... Look, I wish... Thank you. Thanks for everything. It was just a road. No. It was much more than that. Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's goin' crazy! He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now! Mack, just... hold it for... You should go. I know, but... Good luck in California. I hope you find what you're looking for. McQueen, come on! Sally... Sally! Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt! Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt! Come on, get in the trailer.  Where's the old McQueen? The bolt! That's it. That's right, let's go!  You're a big shining star. You're a superstar.  You don't belong there, anyway.  Whoa... Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait, wait! Hey, guys! McQueen's leavin' in the truck! Hey, are you Doc Hudson? Yeah. Thanks for the call. You called them? It's best for everyone, Sally. Best for everyone or best for you? I didn't get to say goodbye to him. Hello, race fans, and welcome to what has become, quite simply, the biggest event in the history of racing. A threeway battle for the Piston Cup! There's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars here at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day! The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen in a 200 lap, winnertakesall, tiebreaker race. You know I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin'. I never thought I'd see anything like this. This is exciting! In fact, the country has almost shut down to watch what many experts are calling ""the race of the century."" Hey, King! Good luck in your last race. You've sure been an inspiration to me. Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it. Hey, be careful out there, OK? Yeah, man. He's hot! Wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast. A 100 percent chance of thunder! Kachicka! Kachicka! Say it with me! Kachicka! Kachicka! Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass. Oh, it's OK. Lightning McQueen knows me! Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it? Absolutely, Mr. Andretti. And good morning to you, Fred. Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now! Sorry, pal. OK, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed. Victory. One winner, two losers. Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed... Hey, Lightnin'! You ready? Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready. Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today. Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do. After all, ""Gas Can"" is my middle name. It is? Not really. Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16. And there he is, Lightning McQueen! Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere! In a little town called Radiator Springs. Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things. Kachicka! Kachicka! Kachicka! Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely. Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks. And the twins. Of course. The ones that used to be your fans, but now they're my fans. Listen to what the twins think... Shoot! Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racin'! Come on, you can do it! Come on, King, make us proud, boy! Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead. McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside! Chick slammed the door on him! Chick's not making it easy on him today. Man, he lost so much momentum, and now he's gonna have to chase him back down! McQueen spins out in the infield! Just me and the old man, fellas. McQueen just doesn't have it today. Hey, kid, are you all right? I don't know, Mack. I don't think I... I didn't come all this way to see you quit. Doc? Guys, you're here! I can't believe this! I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad. You said you'd never come back. Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye. Goodbye! OK, I'm good. All right, if you can drive as good as you can fix a road then you can win this race with your eyes shut. Now, get back out there! Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi! You're goin' up against professional pit crews. You're gonna have to be fast. They will not know what bit them! Kid, you can beat these guys. Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back. Is that? Oh, wow. That's him! Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet! The Hudson Hornet's back! It appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew. And look who he has for a crew chief! Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet! Whoa! Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is. Wow, this is history in the making.  Nobody has seen the racing legend in over 50 years!  Hey, Doc! Come look at this fellow on the radio. He looks just like you. McQueen passes them on the inside! But he's still nearly a lap down. Can he catch up to them with only 60 laps to go? You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on. Vai! Vai, vai!  Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh? Those round things are called tires, and they go under the car! Con chi credi di parlare? Ma, con chi stai parlando?  No! No, no! You'll have your chance. You will have your chance. Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh? Well, what do you think of this? Yeah, that's it, kid. What? Whoa! GitRdone! I taught him that. Kachow! What a move by McQueen! He's caught up to the leaders. Yeah. This is what it's all about. A threeway battle for the lead, with ten to go! Look at that boy go out there! No, you don't. Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat! Can you get back to the pits? Yeah, yeah. I think so. Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid. We gotta get him back out there fast or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race! Guido! It's time. Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield? I don't believe it! That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen! It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car out! It's gonna be close. Yeah, baby! He's back in the race!  Peet stop. Guido, you did it! Way to go, Guido! This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen is right behind the leaders. What a comeback! A hundred and ninetynine laps, and, baby, it all comes down to this! This is it, kiddo. You've got four turns left. One at a time. Drive it in deep and hope it sticks. Go! We'll see about that! McQueen's going inside! Chick and The King are loose! I think McQueen's out! McQueen saved it! He's back on the track! Float like a Cadillac... Sting like a Beemer! Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup! Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers! I am not comin' in behind you again, old man. Oh, no! Yeah! I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah! What's he up to, Doc? What are you doin', kid? I think The King should finish his last race. You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that? This grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'. It's just an empty cup. Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal? He's not really pushin' him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft. Hey. What? What's goin' on? That's what I call racin' right there. Bravo il mio amico!  Way to go, buddy! There's a lotta love out there, you know, man? Don't embarrass me, Fillmore. That's my hot rod. Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup! Kachicka! Kachicka! Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about! Hey, how come the only one celebrating is me, huh? Where are the girls? Bring on the confetti! Easy with the confetti. What's goin' on? Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Say it with me. Kachicka! Boo! Boo! What's wrong with everybody? Where's the happiness? Hey! This is the start of the Chick era! Thanks, Lightnin'. You're welcome. Way to go, King! You're still the car! You're The King! Yeah! You made us proud, kid! Congrats on the loss, me bucko! You got a lotta stuff, kid. Thanks, Doc. Hey, Lightnin'. How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute? Son, that was some real racin' out there. How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco? But I didn't win. Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racin' than just winnin'. He was so rusty, when he drove down the street buzzards used to circle the car! Thank you, Mr. Tex, but... ...but these Rusteze guys over there gave me my big break. I'm gonna stick with them. Well, I sure can respect that. Still, you know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know. I sure appreciate that. Thank you. Actually, there is one thing. Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly! I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park! I think it's abouta time we redecorate. Hi. Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires. How 'bout setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each? Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store. A real Ferrari! Punch me, Guido. Punch me in the face. This is the most glorious day of my life. Wow. Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda. Mi dicono che siete fantastici.  Just passin' through? Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile. I hear this place is back on the map. It is? There's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar is setting up his big racing headquarters here. Really? Well, there goes the town. You know, I really missed you, Sally. Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and, blah, blah, blah. McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree,  Kiss... int!  Great timing, Mater! Hepnon, hiphep, hilililly! He's my best friend. What're you gonna do? So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys? I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive? Nah. Yeah! Kachow! All right, everybody please keep together now. We is now entering the Doc Hudson wing of the museum. Wow. Unbelievable. That many wins in a single season. He's the real deal, Junior. The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration. Excuse me, son. Is Doc Hudson here today? Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc went out for a drive or somethin'. Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy. Not today, old man. I know all your tricks. Doc! Doc! Not all my tricks, rookie! Attention! Kiss the pavement goodbye. When I'm finished, you'll have mud in places you didn't know you had! Yo, I've never been offroad! Well, that's gonna change right now! About face! Drop and give me 20 miles! Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go! Man, now I got dirt in my rims! Look at this! It's my hood! It's my hood! I ain't seen this thing in 20 years! Well, it fits perfectly. How do I look? Oh, dang. You are a toy car!  You are a sad, strange little wagon and you have my pity. Farewell.  Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, you loony!  Hey, I hate to break up the road rally, guys, but they're here!  Birthday guests at three o'clock!  Oh, man! Whoever does the voice of that piggy truck, I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor! We're banished, genius! Stuck here in this wasteland without chains!  But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble! She needs our help!  You're still not listening!  Welcome to the Himalayas! Snow cone?  Oh, that Abominable Snowplow is quite the comic thespian! Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go!  Circus cars?  How can you be circus cars?  These are the lousiest circus cars in the world,  and they're gonna make me rich!  Wait a minute here. They're just usin' the same actor over and over. What kind of a cutrate production is this? Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we please ask someone for directions? No! There's an onramp close! I know it! I can feel it!"
Chicken Little,Disney,2000,2005,Animation,"Now, where to begin? How 'bout, ""Once upon a time""? How many times have you heard that to begin a story? Let's do somethin' else. I got it, I got it, here we go. Here's how to open a movie! No, I don't think so. It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you? Oh, no, no, not the book. How many have seen ""opening the book"" before? Close the book. We're not doing that. Here's what we're gonna do. Why don't I just go back to the day things took a turn for the worse? Run for your lives! Everyone run for cover! SOS! Mayday! Mayday! Code red! Duck and cover! You're all in danger! Run for cover! Run for your lives! Emergency! Emergency! Run for your lives! Look out! Take cover! Run for cover! Chicken Little! What is it? What's going on? The sky is falling! The sky is falling! The sky is falling? Are you crazy? No, no, no! It's true! Come with me! No. Son? What? It happened under the old oak tree! I'm not making this up. I know it's here. There's a piece of the sky somewhere... ...somewhere on the ground here. It was shaped like that! It looks like a stop sign? Yes! Only it doesn't say ""stop"" and it's blue and it has a cloud on it. And it hit me on the head! It looked like a stop sign. Wait! What's that? Son, is this what hit you? What? No, Dad. It was definitely a piece of the sky! Piece of the sky. It's OK, everyone! Dad, no. There's been, like, a little mistake. It was just an acorn that hit my son. A little acorn. No! Dad, no. Quiet, son. This is embarrassing enough already. Chicken Little! What were you thinkin'? Why put your town's safety in jeopardy? How could you mistake a stop sign for an acorn? But it... a big acorn level fluh. What did he say? A big acorn level fluh... It was a big acorn? It was an ape throwing coleslaw? A big acorn level fluh... Gesundheit! Ladies and gentlemen, it's just gibberish, gibberish of an insane person. Come on, Buck! Your kid went and scared us all half to death! Well, what can I tell you, folks, my son, you know... Kids do crazy stuff. You have kids. It's... No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn. It was... it was a piece of the sky. Really, it was. You gotta believe me. A movie. A movie. They're makin' a movie. When? When will everybody forget your big mistake? First it was all over the papers, then they wrote a book about it, then the book on tape, then the board game, the spoons with your face on it... And then the Web site, the commemorative plates. You saw them, right? I saw them. Can't eat off 'em. They're not microwavesafe. You saw the billboards? I saw them. There's a bumper sticker. I knew it was only a matter of time. Billboards I could live with. Posters I could even live with. But a bumper sticker. It's... it's like glued on forever. It doesn't matter. You know why? Because I've got a plan. Yeah, about that. Well, remember how I told you it would be better for you to lay low, don't call attention to yourself? Yes, but I... See, it's like a game. Yeah, a game of hideandseek, except the goal is never to be found, ever! Great! Now, we've got a plan, right? I'll see ya later! Remember, lay low. Yeah. OK. Bye. Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken! Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye! That's it. Today is a new day. It was a recipe for disaster A fourcourse meal of ""No sirree"" It seemed that happily ever after Was happy everyone was after me It was a cup of good intentions A tablespoon of one big mess A dash of overreaction And I assume you know the rest One little slip One little slip It was a fusion of confusion With a few confounding things I guess I probably took the wrong direction Well I admit I might've missed a sign or two I took a right turn at confusion A left when I should've gone straight on through I ran ahead with my assumptions And we all know what that can do One little slip It was a fusion of confusion And a few confounding things I get the feeling in this town I'll never live 'til I live down The one mistake that seems to follow me around But they'll forget about the sky When they all realize This guy's about to try to learn to fly Or hit the ground How's it going? It was a cup of good intentions A tablespoon of one big mess A dash of overreaction And I assume you know the rest One little slip One little slip It was a humble little stumble With a big ungraceful One little slip It was a fusion of confusion with a few confounding things Very well. Foxy Loxy. Present, pretty and punctual. Goosey Loosey. Master Runt of the Litter. Present and accounted for, Mr. Woolensworth. Dropped my pencil! Loser! Henny Penny. Here. Ducky Lucky. Here. Fuzzy Wuzzy. Here. Morkubine Porcupine. Yo. Fish Out of Water. Quite. Abby Mallard. Ugly duckling. Class! I will not tolerate rude behavior at the expense of a fellow... Hey, no worries, Mr. Woolensworth. You mustn't sneak up on me, Ugly... Abby. Where was I? Ugly duckling. Oh, yes. Chicken Little. Tardy again. Tardy again. Class, turn to page 62 and translate each word in Mutton. He. She. They. We. OK, everyone. Listen up! I don't wanna hear any quacks, tweets, oinks, whinnies or cockleedoodledoos when I say... dodgeball. Oh, man. Pump it up! Pump it, pump it, pump it! Split into two teams. Popular versus unpopular. Coach? Yeah, unpopular? Shouldn't we review safety guidelines? Sure! Hit the pig, kids! Look out! Calm down, Runt. Just... Just do what Fish is doing. Everybody dance now Tough morning? A runin with my old nemesis. Gum in the crosswalk? He won. Your old foe! Incoming on your right. Thank you. Yeah, I heard about the movie. Tough break. Yeah. Maybe it'll just go straight to video. That's the least of my problems. This morning... this morning my dad told me I should basically disappear. But that's not gonna get me down. I've got a plan. You want to hear about it? No, no, no! This one's good. Look, one moment destroyed my life, right? One moment. Warthog at 3:00! I see him! Yes! So I figure all I need is a chance... All I need is a chance to do something great to make everyone forget the ""sky falling"" thing once and for all. Then my dad'll finally have a reason to be proud of me. Time out! Nurse! Hi, Tiffany! Hey, man, what's goin' on? So, what do you think? OK, listen. You said the sky was falling. Your dad didn't support you. I... And you have been hurting inside ever since, right? It's hurt. It stung. OK? It's hurt, but... Yes. That's the nutshell. Yes, but... No.. But, it's... What's got to happen now is the nut needs to be cracked open. And not one little chip at a time, but... bam! Smash! Bits of emotion flying everywhere! Anger! Frustration! Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact! You see what I'm saying? All right, forget the nut part. Here's the main thing. You have got to stop messing around, and deal with the problem. But... Here's the real solution. You and your dad talktalktalking... closure! Closure? Closure, talking about something until it's resolved. Wait! Hold on! See? Look. There's a whole section about it in this month's Modern Mallard. Incredibly appropriate! I told you, I have a plan. Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck, you should ""stop the squawk and try the talk. "" Beautiful Duckling says, ""Avoiding closure with your parents can cause early molting. "" See? Closure. Come on, repeat after me. You, your dad, talktalk... Abby, Abby, Abby, listen! Talking's a waste of time. I got to do something great so my dad doesn't think I'm a loser. Come on. You are not a loser. You're inventive and resourceful and funny and cute and... What? Yeah... Runt! Should Chicken Little have a good talk with his dad and clear the air or keep searching for BandAid solutions and never deal with the problem? BandAid solutions! Runt! Well, I'm sorry! I'm very bad at reading facial cues. Fish, help me out here. Men. 'Twas beauty that killed the beast. I guess only girls are good at honest communication and sensitivity. That does it! We were in a timeout, Foxy! Prepare to hurt. And I don't mean emotionally, like I do. We will save you! Fall back! Mad goose! Chicken Little! Not showing up for class, inappropriate school attire, picking fights in gym class and the fire alarm? Ever since that ""sky falling"" incident, he's been nothing but trouble! Now look, Buck. You know I have the utmost respect for you. I mean, you were Buck ""Ace"" Cluck, our school baseball star. But let's face the facts. Your kid, he's nothing like you at all. OK. Thank you for talking to me. I'll take care of my son. I... Dad, it wasn't my fault. It was Foxy. She's always... All right. It's fine. You don't have to explain anything. Hey, Dad? I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I...? What if...? What if I joined the baseball team? Hey, why don't you watch where you're going?! Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry. Baseball? Son, we talked about this. Yeah, right. But, you know, that was when I was small. I put on five ounces this year. I've really bulked up. Really, son? Baseball. Are you sure? Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, hey, why not, right? Yeah, why not, but why? Well, Dad, you were such a big baseball star in high school. You could give me some pointers. But son, I'm just wondering... Maybe baseball isn't exactly your thing, you know? Have you considered the chess team or the glee club? And some teenagers, you know, they get quite a rush from stamp collecting. No. Wanna stop? We'll get stamps. I don't like stamps. Colors, colorful things... No, I was thinkin' baseball! I can't wait to see the look on your face when I smack that ball in for a touchdown! Dad... I'm kidding. That was a... that was a joke. Just do me one favor, son. Why, sure, Dad. Anything. Just please try not to get your hopes too high. Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I... I mean, I think I can... OK, Dad. I bruise you You bruise me We both bruise so Easily Too easily To let it show I love you And that's all I know Oh, Chloe. If only you were here. You'd know what to do. And all my plans Keep fallin' through All my plans, they Depend on you Depend on you To help them grow I love you That's my boy! Gee, thanks, Dad! And that's all It's really all I know It's all I know Come on. All I need is a chance. It's all I know Yeah Ohh I can't sit here while I go nowhere Chase my dreams through the polluted air I'm walking on a wire Running out of time There's no room in this ol' heart of mine Hungry minds just stare you in the eyes Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies Words jump off the pages Passion hits the street Anger's cooking in the city heat World's too crazy I can't take no more I won't stay here locked behind the door Got to stir it up I got to break it up now When I think about tomorrow Ooh, I can't wait to Stir it up Got to shake it up now If I have to beg or borrow I'm not gonna take it anymore Ohoh ohohhoh ohohhoh Come on So much pressure to keep holding on Whoa Pack my clothes up baby I'll be gone Stir it up Got to break it up now When I think about tomorrow I can't wait to Stir it up I got to shake it up now If I have to beg or borrow I'm not gonna take it no more Lean to the left Lean to the right C'mon Acorns Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns! There's excitement in the air, ladies and gentlemen. It's been two decades since Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals the Spud valley Taters. Down by only a single run, with a player in scoring position, we finally have a chance again. This excitement isn't about the fun of baseball, the prize. It's about the gloating and rubbing their noses in it, the ""Nahnahnanana! We beat you!"" taunting that comes with the winning. Yeah! That's right. Oakey Oaks and Mayor Turkey Lurkey will finally have bragging rights again for one full year! Hey. Whoa! This battle has taken a heavy toll on our hometown heroes. After nine grueling innings and several players out with injuries, the Acorns are scraping the bottom of the roster. Hopefully, there's just enough muscle on the bench to pull out a win. Up next... Chicken Little. Clearly a long shot, folks. Little hasn't been up to bat once since joining the team. He's gonna lose the game for us! But wait! If he can just get a walk and advance to first, that powerhouse, Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all. She's had a terrific game so far. A shooin for the MvP trophy. OK, kid, listen up. You have an ittybitty, teenytiny strike zone. There's no way he can throw you out! Take the walk. Don't swing. I have a good feeling... Look at me. Don't swing. Take the walk. You hear me? Just take the walk! But, coach, wait! Don't swing! Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold the pine, Little advances to the box. He's going to bat from the right. Make it the left. No, the right. The right. Easy out! Looks like left field's found something better to do, center field's got a hunger pang in his second stomach and right field's digging for grubs. Play ball! Why him? Why now? I won't embarrass you, Dad. Not this time. Here's the windup, the pitch! It's a high cutter. Ball! Strike one! I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes. The catcher lays down the signals. Here's the pitch. Curve ball low and outside, he swings! Strike two! No! I said, don't swing! Don't swing! No! Batter up! Two in the hole! One more strike, it's a punch out, folks, and we're all going home. Today is a new day. Don't swing! Well, take away my squeaky toy! It's a hit! A hit? A hit? A hit? A hit? But wait! The batter is still at home plate. He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run! Go, son! Run! Run! Run! There he goes, headed the wrong way. Wait, wait, wait! No, no! Not that way! Run the other way! Turn around! Wait, wait! He's turned! I've never said these words before, but he's actually rounding home plate! Goosey Loosey steps on home... Today's a new day! We have a tie game! They're scrambling in the alley. Looks like Rodriguez has it. Nope, it's the center fielder! Mayhem in the outfield, as Rodriguez is fired to second. Catch is complete, but where's the ball? Little touches the bag and keeps going. A hunt for the rock. The fielders are having trouble. Commotion out there! It's stuck! It's stuck! Tip the cow! It's the old tipthecow play. The kid heads for the hot corner, a standup triple! Yes! Hold up! No! He's going for the whole enchilada! The ball of wax, kit and the caboodle! Go back! You're never gonna make it! He's trying to lighten his load! The outfield behind, Little's on all cylinders! He slides for the dish! It's going to be a photo finish at home! You're out! Oh, folks. Folks, what a heartbreaker. Wait! Wait, wait! Wait a cottonpicking second. Hold your horses, here, and horses hold your breath. This might not be over. He... He's... Safe! The runner is safe! It's all over, folks! The Acorns have done the impossible! For the first time in 20 years, we won the pennant! Mothers, kiss your babies! You've witnessed a miracle! Remember where you were at this moment. The smells! The sounds! There's a new winner in town and his name is Chicken Little! That was just a lucky hit! Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours! The victory, the triumph, the glory! And getting doused with a sticky drink that soaks into your undies and chafes for hours! This is one memory you'll savor forever! Yeah! Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won! That's my boy out there! That's my boy! I am the champion, my friend And I'll keep on fightin' till the end I am the champion I am the champion But gone is the loser 'Cause I am the champion Of the world Here's the windup and the pitch! A knuckleball! He swings! Crack! It's going. He rounds first, to second! It hits high off the wall! He flies past third and heads for the plate! It's a scramble for the ball! It's gonna be close! He is safe! The mighty Acorns win! Yes! Acorns win! The mighty Acorns win! Geez, you know, I guess that puts the whole ""sky is falling"" incident behind us once and for all. Hey, kiddo? You bet, Dad. Unless you think we need... closure? Closure? What's to close here? Unless you think we need to close... Not me. It's closed! I agree. Vacuum sealed. Shut tight! OK, great, Dad. You... Closure, I dunno. All right. Enough fun. Good talk. Good talk, son. Here, I'll give you a push. Rock me a little. Help me. OK. OK, I'm up. Hey. Good night, Ace. Here's the windup... and the pitch! Thanks. Thanks for the chance. No! A piece of the sky?! Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again! Hey! Son! You all right? I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs! What's wrong? Nothing. You sure? I thought I heard you yell. No. I fell out of bed. How'd you get over there? Over where? There. There! Where? How'd you get over there? Who're we talking about? Never mind. What's the difference? Look, the past is behind us, right? Tomorrow's gonna be a new day. Please be gone, please be gone, please be gone... Good. No. No. I gotta call Abby! Yo, I'll tell you what I want What I really really want Tell me what you want What you really really want I'll tell you what I want What I really really want So tell me what you want What you really really want I wanna, I wanna I wanna, I wanna Really really really wanna zigazig ah If you wanna be my lover You gotta get with my friends Gotta get with my friends Make it last forever Friendship never ends If you wanna be my lover You have got to give Taking is too easy But that's the way it is Hello! Mallard residence. Tell you what I want Runt! Quiet! I'm on the phone! I wanna, I wanna I wanna, I wanna I wanna really... Runt! Hey! Where are you? We already started. We were just... It opened up! What?! All right, guys. Watch this. Bizarre. OK. Lemme guess. You haven't told your dad yet. Well... I knew it! Why haven't you told him? There hasn't been ""you, your dad, talktalktalking. "" There was talking. There was definitely talking. Really? What did he say? What? All right, that's it. We are doing an intervention! You have got to stop messing around and deal with the problem! She's right! Abby, please. This is what fell on me the first time. There's no way I'm bringing this up again. No, he's not. Runt! Sorry! I'm a gutless flipflopper. OK. I'm sure there's a simple, logical explanation. I mean, it could be a piece of weather balloon, or maybe it's part of some experimental communications satellite. I don't care. I want it out of my life, gone for good. Everything back to normal. Hey, remember when that icy blue stuff fell from the sky? Everybody thought it was from space and stuff? And it just turned out to be frozen pee from a jet airplane. Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee. Yeah. It's frozen pee. Pee, pee, pee, pee pee. Could you stop saying that? What? Pee? Pee. Tinkle? Piddle? Weewee? Whiz? OK, subject change. Make pishee? I don't care what it is! Are you gonna help me get rid of it or not? Flying Fish! Take cover! Fish! No! Fish! Come on, come on, come on! Wait, wait, whoa, son! Where's the fire here? Chicken Little has something to tell you! Tell him. He can handle it. Who're we talkin' about? Gotta go, Dad! Bye! You got to be ready to listen to your children, even if they have nothing to say. Sit tight, Fish! Fish! We will try to save you! I'm sorry! Wait! Sorry! Curb! Fish! Abby! Abby! Wake up! Come on! Let's get outta here! Oh, poor Fish! He's probably stuffed and mounted like an intergalactic trophy or... ...maybe he's a halfliving host implanted with facehugging babies. One thing's for sure, man. He's gone! Gone, man! Not yet! Oh, snap. Fish. Hey! What are you doing? Come on! Fish. Fish. Where are you, Fish?! I can't handle the pressure! Go on without me! Runt. You're just fine. I'll jeopardize the mission! Endanger us all! Throw me overboard while you still have a chance! Just leave me some ammo, little water, some chips if you have 'em. Calm. OK, all right. Listen. Where's your bag? Everything's OK. Now breathe. Breathe. No, slowly. Slowly. Slowly. OK. Now, just do the thing you do to relax. Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man No time to talk Stayin' alive, stayin' alive' Fish! Fish! Are you OK? Did they hurt you? Say something! Don't tap the glass. They hate it when you do that. All right, let's get out of here. Where's Runt? We're next. Run! OK! That's it! We're running back to your house. Tell your dad! OK! You're right, you're right! Stayin' alive, stayin' alive Stayin' alive Oh, Runt! Push! Push! No! Runt! No! Not pull! Push! We gotta get outta here right now! Come on... No! Come on, you guys! Hu... Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! OK, time out! So... have you been to the mall? Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. I'm sorry. Tension makes me bloat. Come on, guys! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Look out! Thanks! Curse these genetically tiny legs! What's that noise? Sorry. Nervous eater. Run! Wait! Fish! The school bell! We've got to ring the school bell to warn everyone! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go! It's locked! They're... they're comin'. I need a soda. Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy! The corner's wrinkled! Why are we doing this? Come on, take it, take it! Yes! Come on! Work! Work! Work! You work! What happened? I blacked out there for a second. The sky is falling! The sky is falling! It was just an acorn. A little acorn! I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks. Ring the bell! Come on, Chicken Little! Ring the bell! What? Let's check the weather with Riz. A cold front is moving in so... The alarm bell has been activated! Quick! Get a camera crew! Chicken Little! You better have a good explanation for this! There's, there's... It's a... You have to... D'oh! Doo wah! What did he say? There's... It's a... You have to... D'oh! Doo wah! Follow me! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Aliens here! Aliens here! It's... it's happening again. Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Come on. Come on. You're about to see it! Quick! Quick! It's taking off! Come on! If you don't hurry, you're gonna miss it! Oh, look! A penny! Guys! Oh, right. Hurry! Hurry! Come on! Quick! It's taking off! Come on! Hurry up! Please! It's right in... What are we lookin' for? I don't know. Yeah. OK. I know this looks bad, but there's an invisible spaceship right there with aliens who are here to invade Earth! Let me show you. Bad throw. OK, let me try again. Bad throw. We all know I don't have a good arm, but there's these cloaking panels on the bottom. They make it disappear. One fell out of the sky and hit me right on the head. It's the acorn thing all over again. There's no story here. At least we can sell the video to Chickens Gone Wild. I'm telling ya, it was here! No, wait! There were aliens! It's true! They had eyes... They're glowing and then tentacles! And maps with planets with x's through them! Runt, that's enough! Don't make Mommy take away your Streisand collection! Mom? You leave Barbra out of this! Why can't you keep that child of yours under control? What kind of parent are you? Everybody, I'm telling the truth. Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up! You gotta believe me this time. No, son. I don't. I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks. I'm really sorry about this, everyone. Looks like this is just a big, crazy misunderstanding. Well, other than the penny, this whole evening was a wash! Mr. Cluck, don't take it so hard. No one blames you. Reports of panic and mayhem are pouring in after yet another Chicken Little incident last night. In one instance, a family of lemmings was sent running in fear, but unable to find a cliff, they instead began throwing themselves from the nearest park bench. Hello? I'm sorry. Hello? I apologize. Hello? Give me break! Hello? What? You were trampled? That's terrible. I thought rabbits' feet were supposed to be lucky. You have hate mail. I'm truly sorry. That wasn't funny. You have more hate mail. Hi. What are you saying, sir? Your hate mail box is full. Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there. Thank goodness the cloud blocked the last letter. Hello? Hey, hey, hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, I'd like to see you try. OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye. Hello? Really. Well... If there was ever a time to talk to your dad, it's now. It's too late for that. It's too late, baby, now it's too late. Though they really did try to make it. Runt. Just think about it. Something inside has died and they just can't hide and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no. Runt, I just really want to be alone right now. Abby! Runt! Fish! Look! There! Look there! Look there! What is that thing?! Look at that! His name is Kirby? They left him behind? Darth Vader is Luke's father? No, don't... Come on, come on, don't cry. We're here for you. We're gonna do whatever it takes to get you back home. Here, blow. OK. See, guys? He's cool. He was just freaked out. That's all. Run! Those are your parents? And they brought the galactic armada? Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him! There you are. Get in the car. I gotta tell you something. What? I know, I know! You were right! Alien invasion. I see that now. Look up! There it is! Dad, you know, about that... It's actually just a rescue mission. Rescue mission? This alien kid was left and they're coming back to get him! We have to help him, 'cause if we don't, who else will? What?! Forget it. You wouldn't believe me anyway. Son! Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little! Mr. Cluck! Wait! He's telling the truth! He is! Though, given his track record, we understand why you don't believe him! It's the end of the world as we know it It's the end of the world as we know it It's the end of the world as we know it And I feel fine It's the end of the world as we know it It's the end of the world as we know it And I feel fine Watch out for the kid! No! Don't! Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out! Chicken Little! What? Where's your head? We gotta get outta here! Come on! Come o... You, with the running and the jumping! Dad. No, wait. What are you guys doing? We gotta get outta here! It's like War of the Worlds out there! Stop pulling! Just listen to me for one second! It's not dangerous! We are under attack! Will you two stop messing around and deal with the problem? You're never there for me! What? OK, that's not what I had in mind, but... You're never there for me. I mean, you were when I won the game, but not when I thought the sky fell. And not at the ball field and not now! This is good! Keep going. Keep going! You've been ashamed since the acorn thing. We have to talk because Modern Mallard says avoiding closure can lead to molting. I'm already small and I don't think I could handle being bald! I didn't... realize, son. I never meant to... The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole... You're right. You're right. Your mom, she was... You know, she was always good with stuff like this. Me... ...I'm gonna need a lot of work. But you need to know that I love you, no matter what. And I'm sorry I... And I'm sorry if I ever made you feel like that was something... ...you had to earn. And we're good. Let's go. Let's go. OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do is return helpless little Kirby. OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do is return helpless little Kirby. Return this whatever it is? This is crazy! Crazy! Crazy wonderful! Just tell me what you need me to do. Do you really mean it? You bet! Anything, son. Come on, Dad. We've got a planet to save! Crazy supportive. That's me! This thing likes to nibble, doesn't it? By the way, I'd like to say I've always found you extremely attractive! Now that's closure. Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?! They've given her an alien mindwipe! OK, son. What do we do now? OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad. All we have to do is take the kid down the street to the giant metal alien. We surrender! Here! Take the key to the city! Key to my car? Tic Tac? Forget plan A! OK, OK, what now, son? Who, by the way, I support 100 percent. Plan B? Of course! Plan B! What is plan B? What? You have to go to the bathroom? You want juice? A snack? Corn dog on a stick? Want to play some golf? What do you want?! I stink at this. I'm a horrible father. No, no, no, I am. I am. Is that your parents? That's it, Dad! Plan B! All we have to do is weave through traffic through town square while avoiding death rays from alien robots. We get to Town Hall, climb up to the roof and give the kid back to its parents. Yeah! Charge! Now that's what I call takin' out the trash! OK, son. Now what? Fire truck! Plan C! Runt, no! Turn around! Go back to Town Hall! But they'll vaporize us! You want me to do what? Runt, just do it! It'll work! We'll survive! I will survive? Brake, Abby! OK. Floor it! Deploy ladder, Fish! I'll survive I will survive Hey, hey Plan D. Plan D. Yeah! Yeah! Thighs hurting. Drumsticks burning. But loving you! Full support! I can't get out! Come back, son! We can't go out this way! It's dangerous. No, Dad, I can do this! It's too dangerous. I can do this. I can. You gotta believe me this time. I... I do, son. OK, hang on tight. Yes! Here's your kid! Look over here! Here's your kid! He's OK! He's all right! Stop the invasion! Son! Son! I'm here, son! Dad! Look out! Get away from my boy! Get away! The mighty Acorns... Tic Tac? Why did you take our child? Just... Just hold on there, buddy! My son did not take your kid! You were the one that left him behind! That's bad parenting! And I should know! Silence! Release the child! OK. OK, OK. Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby, I'm so happy to see you! My darling! That was close. At least they're back together. They got their kid. You have violated intergalactic law 90210! A charge punishable by immediate particle disintegration! Oh, snap. What's that? I don't quite... Melvin, honey? He's saying they're telling the truth. It was just a misunderstanding. Well, then. This is awkward. Yes, it is. I suppose I should... Put the big guns away? Yes, yes. Now put them down. Of course. And turn off your big voice. But I don't... Turn it off. But... But I don't get to use the big voice very often! Melvin. Yes, dear. Hi. Anyone want to try the big voice? Again, I cannot tell you how sorry we are for this whole misunderstanding. Oh, dear goodness. We are so very sorry. We are. And if it hadn't been for your son there, well, we might have vaporized the whole planet. What? Goodness! What a shame that would have been. Tell 'em! Where would we pick acorns? We stop here on the way to the inlaws. Every year. Looked on all the other planets. You only find them on Earth. As it says on your graphic display. That caught our eyes. OK, everything's been put back to normal, except for this one, over here. Hi, y'all! Foxy? Lollipop, lollipop Oh, lolli lolli lolli Lollipop... She got her brainwaves scrambled during reconstitution. No worries! We can put her back the way she was. No! She's perfect. Lollipop! Lollipop! Scary. Darling! Look at the time! We better get a move on. All right, then. It was good meetin' ya. Sorry for the whole fullscale invasion thing. But, hey, I'm a dad. You know how it is with your kids. When they need ya, you do whatever it takes. There goes that panel again. Every year we come, this thing falls off. Seriously, honey, someday it's going to hit somebody on the head. Nonsense! You can't return the panel, can you? Now that's ridiculous. You threw away the receipt again. Silence! Melvin, did you just try and use the big voice on me? Who we talkin' about? So I'd like to see the movie they make about you now. So I'd like to see the movie they make about you now. I just hope they stay true to what really happened. Oh, son, these people are from Hollywood! The one thing they'll never do... ...is mess with a good story. Red alert! Man your battle stations! Status report, Mr. Fish. Commander Little, the evil Foxloxian Army has broken through the planet's atmosphere. But that means... Yes, I know. The sky... is falling. Commander Little! No! Please... call me... ...Ace. Oh, Ace! No! I never intended to bring you into this... Abby. Runt, do you copy? Yes, commander? Runt, my friend, an alien fleet is about to invade Earth. Civilization as we know it depends on me and, to a lesser extent... you. So I've just got one question for you: Are you ready to rock? Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low... Ain't no mountain high enough Raise your pork shield, Runt. Prepare to engage. Stay on target. Stay on target! Give 'em a taste of the other white meat! Cap'n! Look out! Runt! Runt, are you all right? No, no. Ya gotta go on without me, commander. Just leave me some ammo, a little water, some chips if you have 'em. This is amazingly accurate. He was my good friend. Oh, Abby. At least I still have you... Abby. Ace! Abby. Ace! Good people of Oakey Oaks. Though at times it may feel like the sky is falling around you, never give up. For every day... is a new day! A new day! Ain't no mountain high enough Ain't no valley low enough Oh, Ace! To keep me from you Ain't no mountain high enough Ain't no valley low enough Ain't no river wild enough To keep me from you Ain't no mountain high enough Nothing can keep me Keep me from you Ain't no mountain high enough Nothing can keep me Keep me from you Ain't no mountain high enough Ain't no valley low enough Ain't no river wild enough To keep me from you To keep me from you Nothing in this world Nothing in this world Can keep me from you, babe Just call my name Don't go breaking my heart I couldn't if I tried Oh, honey, if I get restless Baby, you're not that kind And nobody knows it When I was down I was your clown And nobody knows it Nobody knows Right from the start I gave you my heart I gave you my heart Don't go breaking my heart I won't go breaking your heart Don't go breaking my Don't go breaking my Don't go breaking my heart Don't go breaking my Don't go breaking my I won't go breaking your heart Don't go breaking my Don't go breaking my Don't go breaking my heart Come on, Runt.

Come on! Go, go! Come on! Mom! Suri! Mom! Mom! Suri! Mom! Suri, where are you? Run, Aladar! Run! Run! Yar, come on! Zini, jump! Jump! Zini, jump! Zini! Hold on! Plio! Yar! Where are you? Aladar! Over here! Oh, Suri. Easy. Easy. They're all gone. Shh, shh. I'm here. Come on. We can't stay here. Now, now, Suri. There's nothing to be afraid of. Look! Whoa! Did you see that? What? I did. Me too! Where did it go? I don't know. Let's go see. Leave it alone__ Hey! Shh, Dad! IIt's scaring Suri here. No, it's not. Everyone just be quiet. Yar, grab on! I can't reach! Aladar, they're stopping! Huh? Stay out of my way! You heard Kron. Move it! Watch it! Zini, get your head down! Walkin' backwards, huh? Well, let me know if that gets you there any faster. Keep those little legs movin', Url, or you'll get left behind. Look at all the Aladars! IIf you're even thinking of joining them__ Hang on! Hang on! Kron. There is a more protected spot further down the__ We'll rest here for the night. Go ahead, Bruton. Oh, Eema, I wish we were at your nesting grounds now. All this pushing and shoving about, just for a place to sleep. I'm not used to this kind of behaviour. Baylene, you got big feet. Just give 'em a kick. Git! Oh, I could not possibly. Uh, uh, shoo, shoo. Will you come on, Baylene? You wanna get to the nesting grounds alive? Show some backbone. Hey there! Oh, sorry about that. Uh, it's just we overheard you talking, and, um__ Well, my word. Look at Url. He doesn't normally warm up to strangers so fast. What an unfortunate blemish. Good mud bath'd clear those right up. Excuse me? Um, he's my grandfather, a couple times removed. Try a couple of species removed. Uh, uh, uh, my name's Aladar. This is my family. We're all that's left. Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry. Baylene's the last of her kind. Finding stragglers like her all along the way. I heard you say something about nesting grounds. It is the most beautiful place there is, child. It's where the herd goes to have their babies. Will we find anybody that looks like us there? Oh, the last few days I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes. Who knows what we'll find. The hard job now is just getting there. And we're being driven unmercifully. By who? Kron, the herd's head honcho. We can hardly keep up. AAn older woman like myself, it's__ Well, it's positively indecent. Then tell him. What's the worst he can do? Oh! Hey! What's his problem? That's him, honey. Kron. Huh. Uh, excuse me. Kron! You got a second? Get lost, kid. Relax, Bruton. Who are you? Uh, Aladar. Why aren't you uphill with the__ Uh, young bloods? Well, I was back here talking to these guys. I guess they__ they're having a hard time keeping up. So, you know, maybe you could slow it down a bit. Hmm. Let the weak set the pace. Now, there's an idea. Better let me do the thinking from now on, Aladar. Hey, they need help back here. Watch yourself, boy. Don't worry. That's how my brother treats newcomers. No matter how charming they are. You sure know how to catch a girl's eye there, stud. I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye if I was you, especially Neera's. You just keep your head down, and you mind what Kron tells you. Since when do we take orders from the likes of him? Kron has swatted flies bigger than you, pops. I could hold that monster's brain in the palm of my__ No, Yar, she's right__ better to keep our heads down with this bunch... than get 'em bitten off by those things. Well, you just consider yourself lucky that's all that's following us. Hey, wake up. Enough with the beauty sleep. You're ravishing already. Hey! Hello! Anybody in there? Zini, what are you doing? I believe you left a wakeup call for the dawn of time. Come on! Move it! What's the hurry? Something's up. The herd's gathering without us. Let's check it out. Rise and shine! Kron says everybody goes. Come on, get up. On your feet. The charm never stops around here. You say something? Uh, no. No, sir. Unless you got a death wish, you and that little parasite better get moving! Sheesh, is that guy ugly, or what? Hey, hey, hey, there's your girlfriend. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about: Neera. Scaly skin, yellow eyes, big ankles. Yeah. I made a real impression on her. What you need is a little help from the love monkey. ""The love monkey""? Oh, baby! That, children, is what's known as a jerkosaurus. And with that, the ice is broken. We've got a lot of firsttimers here. Make sure they get it. We stop for nothing and no one. If this is your first crossing, listen up. There is no water till we reach the other side. And you'd better keep up, 'cause if a predator catches you, you're on your own. Move out! Oh, my goodness. It looks like a very long walk. And hot. If you smell somethin' sizzlin', it could be me. We're moving too slow. I'll pick up the pace. Hey, old girl, you're wandering off a bit. That's all I need: a monkey on my back. On your feet, Eema. We can't let those things eat you. They're out there waiting. The lake! We made it? It's just over that__ that hill, baby. Oh, thank goodness. Come on, Eema. Water. Remember water? Well, it's time to refresh my memory. Ooh, I'm just gonna walk right into that lake... until the water's up to my eyeballs... and soak it all in. Maybe the rains collected somewhere else. What do you want us to do? Take a scout and check the entire perimeter. Enough! You have to be strong now! The nesting grounds are only a few days away! Keep moving! Kron, we've never gone this long without water. If we keep going like this, we'll lose half the herd. Then we save the half that deserves to live. What, they're moving already? Oh, we'll never keep up. There was water here. Always water here before. We always had water. Always. And__ And plenty of mud. Oh, Eema, please. The herd won't wait. We must carry on. You gotta get up! There was water everywhere. There is no water, dear. Baylene, don't move. Uh, what is it? What's wrong? Do you hear that? I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene. Now press down. I always did like big girls! Water. Oh, my goodness! Water! Come on! They found water. That's it, Eema. Come drink. Kron, look. All we had to do was dig and__ Good. Now get out of the way. Wait! Wait! There's enough for everyone! Eema! That's it. Keep pushing and shoving. That's very helpful. Bruton, we've been walking in circles. There's no water here. I think we should get back. Shh. Keep it down. Let's get out of here. Now, you come out on three. One, two, three! Come on. Come on out. No one's gonna hurt you. Hey, hey, what's going on? The little Aladars haven't had anything to drink. I think they're scared of me. Well, who wouldn't be? You are pretty scary. Come on over, guys. Take it easy. Don't worry. She's just a hair ball. And proud of it. Come on. He's gonna find you some water. Here. Now, you just take a foot and press. Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on. Knock it off. Let's__ Let's work together here, huh? A little teamwork. Ready? One, two, three. Press! Good job, Suri. So, where are your parents, anyway? A lot of us are on our own now. You like kids, I see. Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy. I'm Aladar, the jerkosaurus. Oh. Sorry about that. Probably right. Dad, wake up. Huh? Why did you help that old one? What else could we do? Leave her behind? Oh, you mean you actually__ Well, that happens all the time. You don't survive if you're not__ Strong enough. Well, yeah. Is that you talking, or your brother? Everything's so different. I__ I don't know what to think any more. Look, Neera, we watch out for each other... we all stand a chance of getting to your nesting grounds. You sound so sure. I'm not. But it's all I know. So, um__ Oh, water. I'll, uh, get you some water. Can I try? Sure. Just press. Hmm. Oops! Sorry. No, you__you first. One down and__ Well, one down. Kron! Carnotaurs! What? They never come this far north. The fireball must've driven them out. You led them right to us! Maybe you can feed them with your hide! Move the herd out, doubletime! What's happening? My brother's moving the herd. Kron! What's going on? Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving, they'll catch up to us. But the others in the back, they'll never make it. They'll slow down the predators. You can't sacrifice them like this! Hold it! That could be you back there, or you! If you ever interfere again, I'll kill you. Stay away from him! Aladar, no! You just__ Just go. I'll be okay. Let's go! Let's go! Carnotaurs! Carnowhat? Carnotaur. A mouth full of teeth with a bad attitude. Let's go. Come on, you guys, get on, get on! We're gonna get left behind. Go on. Let's go! Hurry up! We're losing them! Aladar, slow down! Oh, joy. Blisters. I've got blisters on my blisters. You don't wanna know where I got blisters. What was that? It came from up ahead. Okay, what's the worst thing it could be? A carnotaur. Okay, what the second worst thing it could be? Two carnotaurs! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! That's it! I'm gone! Everybody! We don't know for sure. It could be the herd. Let's check it out. Goodness. Goodness gracious! Oh, it's Bruton. It appears we weren't the only ones left behind. What happened? Carnotaurs. Oh, we should keep moving. We can't just leave him here. We can if we move fast enough. Hey, uh, you don't look so good. Let me help you. Save your pity. I just need some rest. Now get away from me. Suit yourself. If you change your mind, we'll be in those caves. It's dark, but at least it's dry. I like dry. It's the dark part I'm having trouble with. Ouch! Sorry, Url. Sturdy little thing, ain't he? Ahem. We appear to have a visitor. You coming in, or what? What is it with you? At least I know enough to get in out of the rain. Now come on. On your feet. Uh, you can lie down with us. It's warmer. May I remind you that he's one of them? Well, looks like he's one of us now. Who booked this trip, anyway? Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds soon enough. Well, when I get there, I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind. You tell him, Eema. If I could sleep that deep, I'd be in paradise. If you could sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead. This plant grew on our island. It will make you feel better. Why is he doing this, pushing them on with false hope? It's hope that's gotten us this far. But why doesn't he let them accept their fate? I've accepted mine. And what is your fate? To die here. It's the way things are. Only if you give up, Bruton. It's your choice, not your fate. Well, the plant will help. Wow. Shh. Carnotaurs. What do we do? Wake the others. Go, go! Hurry! Move it, Eema! Aladar! Aladar! Oh, no! I'll hold them off! You help the others! Bruton! Bruton! No! Bruton! You did what you could. It's okay, little ones. We're going to make it. Okay, okay, let's do it again. Let's do it again. Um, I spy with my little eye__ A rock. You got it again! Ooh, you are good! Well, I'll tell you what I spy__ A dead end. What do we do now? I guess we just go back. Hold on a moment. Zini, what is it? Do you smell that? Yeah! Get a load of that! Good show! Everybody stand back! We're out of here! Run! Aladar, look out! No! Aladar, we'll go back. Back to what? It's gone. We're not meant to survive. Oh, yes, we were. We're here, aren't we? And how dare you waste that good fortune by simply giving up? Well, shame on you. Shame on you, shame on you. The worst of it is, you allowed an old fool like me... to believe I was needed, that I still had a purpose. And do you know what? You were right. And I'm going to go on believing it. And I, for one, am not willing to die here. Oh, dear. The nesting grounds. It's__ It's untouched. Our new home. And it comes with a pool! Cannonball! Ha. Amateur. Look out below! Not bad. But I don't get it. Where's the herd? Not to mention Neera. They'll get here soon enough. Oh, no. Eema? I spoke too soon. What is it? That is the way we used to get in here. They'll never make it over that. Aladar, wait, wait! Kron'll eat you alive. Let him try. I hope Kron's in a listening mood. Stay here. We'll find a way around it. In the morning, we'll climb it. We have to keep trying. Our survival, our future, is over these rocks. Now, let's go home! You'll make it, won't you, boys? No! Watch them. They're tough. If they can do it, so can you! Kron! Get the herd out of here! A carnotaur's coming! Keep moving! Stop! I've been to the valley. There's a safer way. Go on, show 'em! Kron, listen to him. Look, we gotta go now! Go where? Straight to the carnotaurs? If we hurry, we can get around them! You can't get over those rocks! There's a sheer drop on the other side. You're gonna kill the herd! I know a way to the valley, and everybody can make it! Now follow me! Kron! They're staying with me! All right, let's go. Neera! He's led that monster right to us! This way! No! Don't move! If we scatter, he'll pick us off. Stand together. Kron! No. No. Kron. Welcome home. Move over, everybody. Bringing in babies is what I do best. I'd say it's been a few years since you hatched an egg. You're right. So let me practise on your head. Look! Somebody wants to meet you. Oh, aren't you the sweetest little small fry I ever did see. Hey, little guy. He looks just like me. Meet your dad. He's not as crazy as he looks. Oh! Oh, happy day. Well done, little one. Come here, you little rascal. Let me get a good look at you. Yep, you're your father's son, all right. Hey, look what I found! New neighbours! Any of you ladies up for a game of, uh, ""monkey in the middle""? Easy, now! Easy! Hey! Whoo! None of us really know what changes, big or small, lie ahead. One thing is certain__ Our journey's not over. We can only hope that in some small way... our time here will be remembered."
Finding Nemo,Disney,2000,2003,Animation,"Wow. Mmm. Wow. Mmmhmm. Wow. Yes, Marlin. I see it. It's beautiful. So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think you were going to get the whole ocean, did you? Oh, yeah! A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver? My man delivered. It wasn't so easy. A lot of clownfish had their eyes on this place. You better believe they did. Every single one of them. You did good and the neighborhood is awesome.  So you do like it, don't you? No, no, I really do like it. But, Marlin, I know that the Drop Off is desirable, great schools, amazing view, but do we really need so much space? Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and see a whale right by their bedroom window! Shh! You're going to wake the kids. Oh, right. Right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. All of them? Right now? All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr. And this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done. I like Nemo. Nemo? We'll name one Nemo, but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr. In a couple of days, we're going to be parents! Yeah. What if they don't like me? Marlin... There's over 400 eggs. Odds are one of them is bound to like you. What? You remember how we met? I try not to. Well, I remember. Excuse me, miss. Can you see if I have a hook in my lip? Marlin. Look closer. Get away! Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go? Coral, get inside the house. No, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside. You. Right now. No!  Coral! Coral? Coral?  Coral! Coral! Coral? There, there. It's okay. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo. First day of school! Wake up! Come on. First day of school. I don't want to go to school. Not you, Dad. Me. Okay. Get up! Time for school! All right, I'm up. It's time for school. Oh, boy! Nemo! First day of school! Don't move. You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. You feel a break? No. Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area. Any rushing fluids? No. How many stripes do I have? Answer the question. Three. No! Something's wrong with you. I have one, two... Three. That's all I have? You're okay. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Sure you want to go to school this year? You can wait five or six years. Come on, Dad. It's time for school. Forgot to brush.  Do you want this anemone to sting you? Yes. Brush. I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Right there. And here and here. We're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn. What do we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. Then we go out and back in. Then one more time. Out and back in. If you want to do it four times... Dad... All right. Come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark. I doubt that. Have you ever met a shark? No, and I don't plan to. How old are sea turtles? Sea turtles? I don't know. Sandy Plankton from next door said that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him, after I'm done talking to the shark. Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Hold my fin. You're not going to freak out like you did at the petting zoo. That snail was about to charge. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Bye, Mom. I'll pick you up after school. Come on, you guys. Stop it. Give it back. Come on. We'll try over there. Excuse me. Is this where we meet his teacher? Look who's out of the anemone. Yes, shocking, I know. Marty? Marlin. Bob. Ted. Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. Yeah. Good idea. That's a misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. Come on, Clowny. Do something funny. All right. I know one joke. There's a mollusk. He walks up to... Well, he swims up. Actually, the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place. And then the sea cucumber... I'm mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them were walking... Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johanssen's yard now! All right, you kids! Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Can I go play, too? Can I? I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.   That's where I would play. What's wrong with his fin? He looks funny. Hey, what did I do? Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin. Dad... See this tentacle? It's shorter than all my other tentacles. But you can't really tell. Especially when I twirl them like this. I'm H2O intolerant. I'm obnoxious. âª Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones  âª Let's name the zones of the open sea  Mr. Ray! Come on, Nemo. Stay with me. âª There's epipelagic, mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssopelagic  âª All the rest are too deep for you and me to see  I wonder where my class has gone. We're under here. There you are! Come aboard, explorers. âª Knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical  âª When you think thoughts that are empirical âª Dad, you can go now. Well, hello. Who is this? I'm Nemo. Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question. Okay. You live in what kind of home? In an anemoninny. Anemonemenemone. Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard. Just so you know, he's got a little fin. If he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. 15 minutes. Dad, it's time for you to go now. We're going to stay together. Okay, class. Optical orbits up front. Remember, we keep our supraesophageal ganglion to ourselves. That means you, Jimmy. Oh, man! Bye, Nemo. Bye, Dad. Bye, son. Be safe. You're doing well for a firsttimer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time when my eldest went out on the Drop Off. The Drop Off! They're going to the Drop Off? Are you insane? Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips? Hey, Marty, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm, ponyboy. Ponyboy? For a clownfish, he really isn't that funny. Pity. âª Let's name the species, the species, the species  âª Let's name the species that live in the sea  âª Mollusca and gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, chordata  âª And some fish like you and me!  Come on. Sing with me. âª Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun  âª It makes its food from the rays of the sun âª Okay, the Drop Off. All right, kids. Feel free to explore, but stay close. Stromatolitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.  Come on. Let's go. Come on. Sing with me. âª There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa  âª Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas three âª Hey, guys, wait up. Whoa! Cool. Saved your life! You guys made me ink.  What's that? I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one. He said it was called a butt. Wow. That's a pretty big butt. Look at me. I'm going to go touch the butt.  Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer. Okay. Beat that. Come on, Nemo. How far can you go? My dad says it's not safe. Nemo, no! Dad? You were about to swim into open water. No! Good thing I was here. He wasn't going to go. He was too afraid. I wasn't. This does not concern you. You're lucky I don't tell your parents. You can't swim well. I can swim fine, Dad, okay? No. It's not okay. You shouldn't be near here. You'll start school in a year or two. No. Just because you're scared of the ocean... Clearly you're not ready. You think you can do these things, but you just can't! I hate you. âª There's... âª Nothing to see. Gather there. Anything I can do? I am a scientist. Is there any problem? I didn't mean to interrupt. He isn't a good swimmer. I think it's too soon for him to be out here unsupervised. I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea. Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're going to get stuck and I'm going to have to get you before another fish does. Get back here. I said get back here now! Stop. You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare. If you put one fin on that boat... Are you listening to me? Don't touch the boa... Nemo! He touched the butt. You paddle your little tail back here. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big... Aagghh! Daddy, help me! I'm coming, Nemo. Get under me, kids. No! Dad! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo, Nemo! No! No! Nemo, Nemo!  Hold on!  Oh, no. No. It's gone. It's gone. It can't be gone. No. No! Nemo! Nemo... Nemo! No. Nemo! Nemo! No. No. Please, no. No, no. Has anybody seen a boat? Please. A white boat? My son! My son! Help me. Please. Look out! Oh, sorry. I didn't see you, sir. Are you okay? He's gone. There, there. He's gone. It's all right. It'll be okay. No, they took him away. I have to find the boat. A boat? I've seen a boat. You have? And it passed by not too long ago. A white one? Hi. I'm Dory. Where? Which way? Oh. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you so much. No problem. Wait. Quit it. I'm trying to swim here. The ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Do you? Do you? Want a piece of me? Yeah. I'm scared now! Wait. Stop following me, okay? What? You're showing me which way the boat went. A boat? I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny and I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from shortterm memory loss. Shortterm memory loss. I don't believe this. No. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least I think it does. Uh... Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong with you. Really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. Hello. Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right?  So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late? Nothing. We're not even out. Great. Then how would you morsels like to come to a little gettogether I'm having? You mean like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun and it's tempting, but we can't because... Come on. I insist. Okay. That's all that matters. Look. Balloons. It is a party. Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Anchor! Chum! There you are, Bruce. Finally. We got company. It's about time, mate. We've gone through the snacks and I'm starving. We almost had to have a feeding frenzy. Let's get this over with.  Right then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except stinking dolphins. Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're so cute. Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something? Today's meeting is step five: Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. Hey there! How about you, Chum? Well, I seem to have misplaced my friend. It's all right, Chum. Help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum. I'll start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Bruce. Hello, Bruce. It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup. You're an inspiration to us. Amen. Right, then. Who's next? Pick me. Pick me. The little sheila down the front. Whoo! Come on up here. Hi. I'm Dory. Hello, Dory. And... Well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish. Hey, that's incredible. Good on you, mate! I'm glad I got that off my chest. Anyone else? How about you, mate? What's your problem? Me? I don't have a problem. Okay. Denial. Just start with your name. Okay. Hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish. A clownfish? Really? Go on. Tell us a joke. I love jokes. I actually do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally they don't talk, but in a joke, everyone talks. The sea mollusk says to the cucumber... Daddy! Nemo! Nemo!  I don't get it. For a clownfish he's not that funny. No, he's my son. He was taken by these divers. You poor fish. Humans. Think they own everything. Probably American. There is a father looking for his little boy. What do these markings mean? I never knew my father. Come here. We're all mates here. I can't read human. Then we've got to find a fish that can read this. Look. Sharks! Guys. No, Dory. That's mine. Give it back. Cut it out. Ow! I'm sorry. Are you okay? You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding? Dory, are you oka...  Oh! That's good. Intervention! Just a bite. You hold it together, mate. Fish are friends, not food. Food! Dory, look out. I'm having fish tonight. Remember the steps, mate. Just one bite. G'day. There's no way out. There's got to be a way to escape. Who is it? Help me find a way out. Sorry. You'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape. There's no way out. There's got to be a way out. Here's something. ""EscapÃ©."" I wonder what that means. It's spelled just like the word ""escape."" Let's go. Here's Brucie! Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right! Then here. Read this now. He doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father. Don't fall off the wagon. Oh, no! It's blocked. No, Bruce! Sorry about... Bruce, mate. He's really... A nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? Okay. No, no, no, no! Quick. Grab the mask. Oh, no. Bruce. What? Swim away! Is the party over?  Nice. Dad! Daddy? Barbara. Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'll need more cotton rolls. All right. Hello, little fella. Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life and I saved him. Has that Novocain kicked in yet?  Bubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles.   Bonjour.  Aagghh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about. He's scared to death. I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is? Your dad's probably back at the pet store. Pet store? Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart. Pet Palace. FishORama. Mail order. EBay. Which one is it? I'm from the ocean. Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aagghh! He hasn't been decontaminated yet. Jacques! Clean him! Oui.  Ocean. La mer.  VoilÃ . He is clean. Wow. The big blue. What's it like? Uh... Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, ask your Auntie Deb. That's me. If I'm not around you can always talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's nuts.  Can't hear you, Peach. I said we got a live one. Yes! Boy, oh, boy. What have we got? Root canal. It's not going to be pretty. Aagghh! Clamp installed? Yup. What did he use to open? Glidden drill. He favors that one. I can't see, Flo. Agh! Schilder Technique. That's a Hedstrom file. That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a KFlex. It's got a teardrop cross section. A Hedstrom. KFlex! Hedstrom! There I go. Little help. Over here. I'll go deflate him. Pffft! All right. Go ahead and rinse. The human mouth is a disgusting place. Nigel. What did I miss? Root canal. A doozy. What did he use to open? Glidden drill. He favors it. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus. Hello. Who's this? New guy. The dentist took him off the reef. An outie. From my neck of the woods? Sorry if I took a snap at you. Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat. No, no. Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo. The picture broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. Going to be eight this week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She's going to be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present. Shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up, I'm going to go see a man about a wallaby. Uhoh. Darla! What's wrong with her? She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. Poor Chuckles. He was her present last year. Hitched a ride on the porcelain express. She's a fish killer. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. Daddy! Help me! He's stuck. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out. Gill... I just want to see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail. I can't. I have a bad fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Perfect. You did it. Good squirming. Wow, from the ocean! Just like you, Gill. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking tonight we give the kid a proper reception. So, kid, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. Nemo. Nemo.  You going to eat that? Careful of that hammer. Dory! SeaMonkey has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Yes, I'm a natural blue. Get up! Look out. Sharks eat fish!  Wow. Dusty. The mask. Where's the mask? No! The mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get it!   Whoohoo! Keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! What are you doing? I've lost the mask. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When you're down, know what to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. âª Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming  âª What do we do? We swim  Dory, no singing. âª I love to swim  âª And when you want to swim you want to... âª I'm going to get stuck with that song. It's in my head! Sorry. See anything? Something's got me! That was me. Sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Are... Are you my conscience? Yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Can't complain. Good. Now, Dory, I want you to tell me, do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience, am I dead? I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty! I... I'm feeling happy. Which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. âª I'm going to swim with you  âª I'm going to be your best friend âª Good feeling's gone.  I can't see. I don't know where I'm going. The mask! What mask? Okay. I can't see a thing. Whoa, geez. Look. A mask. Read it! I'm sorry, but if you could bring it a little closer. I need the light. That's great. Keep it right there. Just read it! Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. ""P."" Okay. P. ""Sher..."" P. Sher... P. Shirley... P not Shirley. The first line's ""P. Sherman."" ""P. Sherman"" doesn't make any sense! Second line. Light, please. ""Walla... Wallaby."" The second line's ""42 Wallaby Way."" Just finish up. Speed read. No pressure. There's a lot of pressure! Take a guess, with pressure. Sydney. It's Sydney! Duck! I'm dead. I'm dead. I died. I'm dead. Whoohoo! âª We did it, we did it  âª Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  âª No eating here tonight, eating here tonight  âª No eating here tonight You're on a diet âª Dory. What did it say? What did the mask say? P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.  I remembered what it said! I forget things, but I remembered it. P. Sherman... Where is that? I don't know. But who cares? I remembered. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again! Psst! Nemo. Nemo! Huh? Suivezmoi.  Follow me.  Hoo! State your name. Nemo. Brother Bloat, proceed. Nemo, newcomer of orange and white. You have been called forth to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood. Huh? We want you in our club, kid. Really? If you are able to swim through the Ring of Fire! Turn on the Ring of Fire. You said you could do it. The Ring of Fire!  Bubbles. Let me... Isn't there another way? He's just a boy.  From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait. Sharkbait! Oohaha! Welcome, Brother Sharkbait. Sharkbait. Enough with the Sharkbait. Sharkbait, oo... Sharkbait's one of us now. Agreed. We can't send him to his death. Darla's coming in five days. So what are we going to do? I'll tell you. We're going to get him out of here. We'll help him escape. Escape? Really? We're all going to escape. Not another one of your escape plans. Sorry, but they never work. Yeah, why should this be any different? 'Cause we've got him. Me? You see that filter? Yeah. You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. We need you to take a pebble inside there and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's going to get filthier by the minute.  Soon the dentist will have to clean the tank.  When he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in individual baggies,  then we'll roll down the counter, out of the window,  off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor.  It's foolproof. Who's with me? I. I think you're nuts.  No offense, kid, but you're not the best swimmer. He's fine. He can do this. So, Sharkbait, what do you think? Let's do it! P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? To P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello? Wait. Can you tell me... Hey! Hold it! Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas. Come back here. One quick question. I need to... And they're gone again. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you again? I don't get tired of it. All right, here's the thing. I think it's best if I carry on from here by... By myself. Okay. You know. Alone. Without... Well, not without you, but I don't want you with me. Huh? I don't want to hurt your feelings. You want me to leave? Well, not... Yes. Yeah. I just can't afford any more delays. You're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a group of fish. They're delay fish. You mean... You mean you don't like me? Of course I like you. Because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you? I don't remember. Were you? No, no. We're just... Do you guys know how I can get... We're talking to the lady, not you. You like impressions? Mmmhmm. Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. What are we? Take a guess. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword. Wait. It's a swordfish. Hey, clownboy, let the lady guess. Where's the butter? It's on the tip of my tongue. Lobster. Saw that. What? Lots of legs. Clam? Close enough. âª It's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad âª They're good. Somebody give me directions? ""Would somebody give me directions?""  I'm serious. Blah, blah, me, me. Blah, blah, blah, me, me. Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey, come back. What's the matter? While they're doing impressions, I am miles from home with a fish that can't even remember her own name. I bet that's frustrating. My son is out there. Your son Chico? Nemo. It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish in this ocean is going to help me. I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys. Is he bothering you again? No, he's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio. Heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney? Sydney? Oh, sure. Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted? Sure do. Hey, they know Sydney! You wouldn't know how to get there? Follow the EAC. That's East Australian Current. Big current. You can't miss it. It's in that direction. Then you got to follow that for about... What do you guys think? Three leagues? That baby's going to float you right past Sydney. Great! That's great! Dory, you did it. Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along. Fellas, thank you. Don't mention it. Just loosen up. Okay, buddy? You guys! You really nailed him. Bye. Ma'am. One more thing. Yes? When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it. Trench. Through it. Not over it. I'll remember. Hey! Wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait. I've got to tell you something. Whoa. Nice trench. Hello!  Let's go. No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench. We're going to swim over this thing. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me we should swim through it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got death written on it. I'm sorry, but I think we should swim through. I'm done talking about this. Over we go. Come on. Trust me on this. Trust you? Yes. Trust. It's what friends do. Something shiny! Where? It just swam over the trench. Come on. Okay. Boy, it sure is clear up here. Exactly. And look at that. There's the current. We should be there in no time. Hey, little guy. You wanted to go through the trench. I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy.  Ow! That's a jellyfish! Bad Squishy. Shoo! Get away. Let me see. Don't touch it. I'm not going to touch it. I just want to look. How come it didn't sting you? It did. Hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here. You're going to be fine. But now we know that we don't want to touch these again. Let's be thankful it was just a little one. Don't move. This is bad, Dory. Boing. Boing. Dory! You can't catch me. Don't bounce on the tops. They will not sting you! The tops don't sting you. Two in a row. Beat that. Listen to me. I have an idea. A game. A game? I love games. Pick me. Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins. Okay! Rules. Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops. Something about tentacles. Got it. On your mark. Get set. Go! Wait! Go faster if you want to win. Dory! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute. Whee! So, we're cheating death now. We're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Careful I don't make you cry when I win. I don't think so! Give it up. You can't fight evolution. I was built for speed. The question is, are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left, back and coming over, right there! The clownfish is the winner! We did it. Look at us! Dory? Oh, no. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory!  Aagghh! Am I disqualified? You're doing fine. You're winning. Stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live? P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. That's it! Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake! Awake... P. Sherman... Awake... 42 Wallaby Way... Wake up. Sydney. Nemo... You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait? Yeah. Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's looking for you. He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. Peach? Any movement? He's had four cups of coffee. It's got to be soon. Keep on him. My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aiming for the toilet. The toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. The bubbles, the bubbles! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest. We have 4.2 minutes. That's your cue. You can do it, kid. We got to be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom and I'll talk you through the rest. Okay. Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.  Nicely done. Can you hear me? Yeah. Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening? Uhhuh. Okay. Inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, Sharkbait. I can't do it. This isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! Okay. That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady. I got it, I got it! He did it. That's great, kid. Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Gill! Sharkbait! Get him out of there! Help him! What do we do? Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic. Help me! Sharkbait, grab hold of this. No! Feed me more. That's it! Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it. I got it. Pull! Gill, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done.  Dude? Dude? Focus, dude. Dude? He lives. Hey, dude.  What happened? I saw the whole thing, dude. First you were all, like, whoa! And then we were all, like, whoa! Then you were, like, whoa... What are you talking about? You, miniman! Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Man, no hurling on the shell. I just waxed it. So, Mr. Turtle... Dude, Mr. Turtle is my father. Name's Crush. Crush? Really? Okay, Crush. Listen, I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC? Dude... You're riding it, dude. Check it out. Okay, grab shell, dude. Grab what? Righteous! Righteous! So, what brings you on this fine day to the EAC? Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. Dory! Is she all right? Oh, little blue. She is sublevel, dude. Dory, Dory! Dory! Oh, Dory.  I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. ...twentynine, 30! Ready or not, here I come! There you are. Catch me if you can. Up you go!  Oh, my goodness. Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo. Whoa! That was so cool. Hey, Dad. Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You so totally rock, Squirt. Give me some fin. Noggin. Dude. Intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman. Jellies? Sweet. Totally. I must have done something you all liked, dudes. You rock, dude. Ow. Curl away, my son. It's awesome, Jellyman. When the little dudes are eggs we leave them on a beach to hatch, and coocoocachoo, they find their way back to the big ol' blue. All by themselves? Yeah! But, dude, how do you know when they're ready? You never really know, but when they know, you'll know. You know?  Hey, look, everybody. I know that dude. It's the Jellyman. Well go on. Jump on him. Turtle pile! Wait. Kids! You funny? Where's your shell? Do your stripes come off? I need to breathe. Did you cross the jellyfish forest? One at a time. Mr. Fish, did you die? Sorry. I was vague on the details. So where are you going? You see, my son was taken. My son was taken away from me. No way! What happened? No, kids. I don't want to talk about it. Come on. Please. Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long way from here. This is going to be good. I can tell. My son, Nemo, he was mad at me. Maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on him. I don't know. He swam in the open water to this boat and these divers appeared and I tried to stop them. The boat was too fast, so we swam out in the ocean... He couldn't stop them. Then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into three sharks. He scares them away by blowing them up. That's amazing. Then dives thousands of feet... Straight into the dark. It's wicked dark there. You can't see a thing. The only thing they can see down there is... This big, horrible creature with razorsharp teeth! Nice parry. Then he has to blast his way... These fish have been searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current. He may be on his way here right now. That should put him in Sydney Harbour... In a few days. This guy will stop at nothing... ...stop at nothing until he finds his son. I hope he makes it. That's one dedicated father, if you ask me. Mine. Mine. Mine. Would you just shut up? You're rats with wings. This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo. He was taken off the reef by divers... There. Take it. Say that again. You said something about Nemo. Mine. Mine. Mine.  Mine. Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbor. Brilliant! Is he doing okay? I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention DAR... It's okay. I know who you're talking about. Gill? Gill? Hey, Sharkbait. I'm sorry I couldn't stop... I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean, I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid. All right. Hey, hey, hey! What the... Aaggh! Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.  Darn kids. Well, good thing I pulled the right one, eh? Pssst! Nigel, you just missed an extraction. Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nemo? I've got to speak with him. Your dad's been fighting the ocean looking for you. My father? Really? He's traveled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish. Sharks? That can't be him. Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sport fish. Tuna? Trout? Marlin? That's it. The clownfish from the reef. It's my dad! He took on a shark! I heard he took on three. Three? Three sharks? That's 4,800 teeth! After you were taken by Diver Dan, your dad followed the boat like a maniac. Really? He's giving it all he's got and then three sharks capture him. He blows 'em up and then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock. And his reward? He gets to battle a jellyfish forest. Now he's with sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way, right now, to Sydney! What a good daddy. He was looking for you after all. He's swimming in the filter! Not again! Sharkbait! No! You've got your life ahead of you. We'll help you. Get him out. Get him out of there. Come on. Grab the end.  Are you okay? Can you hear me, Sharkbait? Nemo? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Sharkbait, you did it! Sharkbait, you're... Covered with germs! That took guts. All right, we have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here. This tank will get plenty dirty in that time, but we have to help it along. Jacques, no cleaning. I shall resist. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're going to make this tank so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.  Good work. All right, we're here, dudes. Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man. Where? I don't see it. Right there. I see it. I see it. You mean the swirling vortex of terror? That's it, dude. Of course it is. First, find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes. Squirt here will now give you a rundown on proper exiting technique. Good afternoon. We're going to have a great jump today. Crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall. There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out. Remember, rip it, roll it and punch it! It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it. You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying. Say the first thing again. Okay, Jellyman. Go, go, go! Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! That was fun. I actually enjoyed that. Hey, look! Turtles. Most excellent. Now, turn your fishy tails round and swim straight on through to Sydney. No worries, man. No worries. Thank you, Dude Crush. Bye. See you, Jellyman. Tell your little dude I said hi, okay? See ya later, dudes. Bye, everyone. Nemo would have loved this. Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you? 150, dude! And still young. Rock on! 150. I got to remember that. Whoa. We going in there? Yep. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney? Yep. We're going to just swim straight. âª Just keep swimming âª Dory... Boy, this is taking a while. Hey, how about we play a game? Okay. Okay, I'm thinking of something orange. And it's small... It's me. Right. This one you'll never guess. It's orange and small. It's me. All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants. It's orange and small and white stripes... Me. And the next one, just a guess, me. Okay. That's just scary. Wait. I've seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it. That means we're not going straight. We got to get to the surface. We'll figure it out there. Hey! What? Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions. Fine. Who? The speck? There's nobody here! There has to be someone. It's the ocean. We're not the only two in here. Let's see... Okay, no one there. Nope. Nada.  There's somebody. Hey, excu... Dory! I'm thinking of something mysterious. It's a fish we don't know, and if we ask it directions, it could ingest us. What is it with men and asking for directions? Don't play the gender card. Let's play the ""let's not die"" card. Want to get out of here? Of course. How are we going to do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? You don't fully understand. Trust me on this. All right. Excuse me? Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude. Say hi. Hello. His son Bingo... Nemo. ...was taken to... Sydney. Sydney, yes. It's really important that we get there as fast as we can. Can you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on. Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella. Big fella. Whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale. We need to find his son. What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? Can you give us... Heaven knows what you're saying. ...directions? See, he's swimming away. Come back. You've offended him. Maybe a different dialect.  This is not whale. You're speaking, like, upset stomach. Maybe I should try humpback. No, don't.  You sound sick. Maybe louder, huh? Don't do that. Too much orca. Didn't that sound a little orcaish? It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.   Just as well. He might be hungry. Whales don't eat clownfish. They eat krill. Swim away! Look. Krill! Move, Dory! Move! Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look. Scum angel.  Bubbles! I love the bubbles.  Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? Flo! 9:00, and cue dentist. Barbara. Sorry I'm late. Okay. Here we go. Little Davey Reynolds. Walks to the counter, drops the keys... Bloat, that's disgusting. Tastes pretty good to me.  Don't you realize we are swimming in our own... Shh! Here he comes. What the... Crikey. What a state. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow? 10:00, love. Leave it open. I've got to clean the fish tank before Darla gets here. You hear that, Sharkbait? Yay! He's going to clean the tank! Yeah, we're going to be clean! Ready to see your dad? Uhhuh. Course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor waiting for you right now. Yeah. Aagghh!  Whoo! Here comes a big one! Come on. You got to try this. Will you just stop it? Why? What's wrong? We're in a whale. Don't you get it? A whale? A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help. And now we're stuck here. A whale? You know, I speak whale. You're insane. You can't speak whale. I have to get out. I have to find my son. I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!   Hey. You okay? There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay. No. It won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. Huh. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo. What's going on? Don't know. I'll ask him. What's... Dory. ...going on?  I think he says we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak whale. You're going to make things worse. What is that noise?  Oh, no. Look what you did. The water's going down. It's going down! Really? You sure about that? Look. Already it's halfempty. Hmm. I'd say it's halffull. Stop that. It's halfempty!  Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat or he wants a root beer float. Of course he wants us to go there. That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good? Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch. Okay. He's... Stop talking to him. What is going on? I'll check. What... No. No more whale. You can't speak whale. Yes, I can. No, you can't. You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo.  Okay. Dory! He says it's time to let go. Everything's going to be all right. How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't going to happen? I don't! Aaaggghhh! We're alive! Look. Sydney. Sydney! Sydney. Sydney again. You were right. We made it! We're going to find my son. Thank you, sir. Wow. I wish I could speak whale. Now we find the boat that took him. Right. Come on. We can do this!  Morning. It's morning, everyone. Today's the day. The sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting out of... The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? Boss must have installed it while we were sleeping. What are we going to do? What's it say, Peach?  I can't hear you, Peach. The Aqua Scum 2003 is an allpurpose, selfcleaning saltwater purifier that extends the life of your aquarium fish. Stop it!

Where are you going? It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone. I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave... I remember things better with you. Look. P. Sherman, 42... Bah! I remember it. It's there. I know it is. Because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I look at you and I...

Get us out! No, no, no! Dory! Dad, I know what to do. Nemo, no! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together. Get out of there. This will work. No, I am not going to lose you again. There's no time. It's the only way we can save Dory. I can do this! You're right. I know you can. Lucky fin. Now, go. Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down. Well, you heard my son. Come on. Dory, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together. Do you understand what I'm saying? Swim down! Everybody swim down. Come on. You have to swim down. Down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down!

Daddy's got you. Daddy? Oh, thank goodness. Daddy... I don't hate you. Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo. Hey, guess what? What? Sea turtles... I met one. And he was 150 years old. Yep. 'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only lived to be 100. Sandy Plankton? Think I would cross the ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton? He was 150! Not 100. Who is this Sandy Plankton that knows everything wrong? Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I'm going to win. No, you're not. I did it. My own son beats me. Climb aboard, explorers. So then the sea cucumber looks over at the mollusk and says, ""With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"" Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this? Exchange student. I'm from the EAC, dude. Sweet. Totally. Seriously, Marty, did you really do all the things you say you did? Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks. We'll see you next week. Keep up with the program, Dory. Remember, fish are friends. Not food! Bye! Hold on. Here we go. Next stop, knowledge. Bye, son. Have fun. Bye, Dad. Oh! Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad. I love you, too, son. Uh, Dad? You can let go now. Sorry. Now go have an adventure. Goodbye. See you later, dudes! Bye, Elmo. Nemo. Nemo. Bye, Nemo. See you after school, Dory. Bye, Dad! Bye, son. Barbara. Mmmhmm? I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks. Had to clean the tank myself, take the fish out, put 'em in bags and... Where'd the fish go?  Come on, Peach! You got it. That's it. You can do it. That's the shortest red light I've ever seen. Come on, Peach.   Now what? "

We got to go filea report with the sheriff. Give him back his horse. This one's too skittisharound cows. And that, girls,is what makes me and Rico... equal parts ofone lean mean crimefighting__ machine? Well, there it is, then. Well, well, well, stud. Now, I'm no professional... but I'd say the onlymano a mano you'll be doing... is in your dreams. Oh, look out, Buck. He's making a moveon your left flank. Kaboosh! Maggie! Grace!Leave that poor animal alone. Buck,I realize you're very upset... but if you'd liketo join our group... and help us bring in Slim,we'd be happy to have you. However, there are a few... angermanagement issueswe need to discuss. I wouldn't helpyou bossy bovines... if my life depended on it! You see, that's justwhat I'm talking about. Grace! Bye. Come on, girls. Hmm. Let's go get Slim. ""Come on, girls,let's go get Slim."" Cudchewing heifers. Huh. I can catch that Slim withone hoof tied behind my back. Wait a minute. Why don't l? Yes! Partner or no partner,that's what I'ma do. Hey! Ba ba ba ba ba  Hold the horse now. Aw, forget it. Definitely bipolar. Move it, sister!Hero passing on the left! Hey, watch it. Where are you going, hotfoot? I'm gonna go nab that rustler... and show RicoI got what it takes... so say goodbye to your farm,girls, because Slim is mine. It's hero time! Watch out now! Hey! Get back! Jump back! Kiss myself! Whoo! Da da yoo  Oh, this isa fine kettle of fish. How can we compete with that? Look at the bright side, Mrs. C. Don't forget aboutour secret weapon. Secret weapon? Who better to catcha cattle thief than a cow? Yeah, even you can't arguewith that kind of logic. OK, maybe you can. You know, Grace... Maggie does so loveyour singing. How about a song? I'm gonna get you for this. Ha ha! 5,000 Texas longhorns. Not bad for one night's work. Pick a color. I said,not bad for one night's work. What? Thank you. And judging by the ear mark... I'd say these are the lastof Big Mike Donald's herd. Big Mike Donald had a farm? EIEI__IEIEI__ Ohh... Ohh... That's right. He had a farm.Heh heh heh. Now that all his cash cowshave disappeared... that poor sap'sgonna be flat broke. Perfect time for a certainupstanding land owner... to step inand take all the land. Aah! Who are you? What did you dowith Uncle Slim? Put up your dukes,Mr. Fancy Britches. Aahaahaahaahaahaah! It's me. Hello? This hereis the disguise I use... to sneak intoall them auctions... and buy all the land,you brainless monotone monkeys. Shoot, you got to be the richestland baron in the west. Yes, but the partthat really warms my heart... is watching those homesteaderssuffer. Back in the day, I worked... the highfalutinest ranchesyou ever seen... but those stuckup ranch bossescouldn't appreciate my talents. Maybe they just didn't likeyour singing. My singing? Songbirds sing. Saloon gals sing. Little bitty snotnosedchildren sing. I yodel! And yodeling is an art! Well, maybe they justdidn't like your yodeling. He didn't mean it, Uncle Slim. Everybody likes yodeling. Hmm? Why, it's one of the funniest,cornball, goofy, silly sounds... in the whole west. Yaah! Aah! Yaah! Uh, Gil? Uhhuh? Am I correct in assumingthat each and every time... we brought a herd backto this secret lair... you've managed to sitin the exact same spot... blocking that choicepiece of property from my view?! This is my comfy place. What? Aah! It's calledPatch of Heaven, Uncle Slim. Goes on auctionThursday morning. Perfect. Pencil it in. Thursday morning__right afterwe sell off this herd. But it's justa little old dirt farm. Ah, what's the difference? When you're talking revenge,every last acre counts. I don't get it. Weren't the cowssupposed to come back? Daddy, what's going to happenif they don't come back? Oh, but they are coming back. Hogwash! We all knowthey're never coming back. What? Ooh! Ooh! You don't know that, Jeb. Everybody knows that bovines... are the most intelligent,crafty animals in the west. Yeah. He's right, you know. It doesn't take a cowto figure out... they sawthe writing on the wall... and flown the coopwhile the getting was good. What? Oh, no!They tricked us and deserted us! No, no. AudAudrey. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me! Oh, uh, let's not forgetwho we're talkin' 'bout. Audrey, remember whenGrace helped you figure out... why you crossed the road? And, Jeb, Miss Calowayknew just what to do... when your head got stuckin that spittoon. Get off my case! And Maggiewas gonna make us all winners. I truly believethere ain't nothin'... those three cows can't do. Well, whatever they're gonna do,they better do it soon. I'm so very sorry, Pearl. It's a real shame. It is. Ollie,I don't know what's worse__ Losing my farmto the highest bidder... or knowing that__that my girlsare lost and alone out there. Yeehaw! Come on, girls. EitherI'm getting good at this... or his scentis getting stronger. Go get him, Maggie.Look out, Slim! No. It can't be. We're on your trail! Hoo hoo! This has Buckwritten all over it. We're not gonna letthis dumb old trick stop us. Sooner or later, all these pathswill hook up, and then... Oh, no, the tracks! Hurry up, girls.Don't lose that trail. What trail?I can't see anything. Look out! Oh! Flash flood! Get to high ground! Oh. Maggie! Maggie! No! Come on, girls,we can't give up! Maggie, that's enough.The minute this lets up... we're heading straight hometo Patch of Heaven. But what about catching Slimand collecting the reward? We never had a prayer... of catching Slimin the first place. This whole ridiculous plan... is just so you can get revengeon those cattle rustlers. Hey!For your information, duchess... this whole ridiculous planis about us saving our farm. Huh. Our farm might've hada fighting chance... until you came along. What's that supposed to mean? Strutting around withyour vulgar showcow behavior. Look, I was just having__ Wasting our timeon your foolish plans. Through the years,Patch of Heaven... has survived every hardshipthat nature can dish out... but you, Maggie... are the biggest catastropheto ever hit our farm. Well, if that's the wayyou feel about it... maybe we should just goour separate ways. Now, that's the firstgood idea you've ever had. Fine! Fine! Fine! Fine! Yeah. Fine. It's not like your farm... was ever gonna feel like hometo me anyways. Rain is pourin' down  Like the heavensare hurtin'  Seems like it's been darksince the devil knows when  How do you go onnever knowing for certain  Will the sunever shine again?  Feels like it's been yearssince it started to thunder  Clouds are campin' outin the valley and glen  How do you go on whenyou can't help but wonder  Will the sunever shine again?  What if the rainkeeps fallin'?  What if the skystays gray?  What if the windskeep squallin'  And never go away?  Maybe soon the stormwill be tired of blowin'  Maybe soonit all will be over, amen  How do you go on ifthere's no way of knowin'?  Will the sun ever shine?  Wish I could say  Send me a sign  One little ray  Lord,if you're listenin'  How long until then?  Will the sun ever shine  Again?  Maggie. Maggie. Maggie. Wake up. Check, please! It tasted a lot betterin my sleep. Well, I supposeyou'll be off now. Mmhmm. Where will you go? Oh, probably check outthe Grand Canyon. See Utah before I die. Wait a minute. Where's Grace? Hi, there.Boy, am I glad you guys are up. Hey, come look at this. What on earth?Where did all this come from? Hey, it's green, it's leafy,and it's free. Shut up and eat. Good morning, ladies. I see you're alreadytucked into your appetizer. Never knew a pretty ladythat didn't have an appetite. Oh, now, see here, you ruffian__ He's not a ruffian,Mrs. Caloway. He's a genuine desert shaman__our very own wise man. Shaman, chef, chief cook,and bottle washer. I'm a jackrabbit of all tradesand at your service. Folks around these partscall me Lucky Jack. Yep, they used to comefrom miles around... just to get one rubof my lucky rabbit's foot. Whoo! Dagnabit! This happens all the time.Now, where was l? Ah. Voila. Now let me justget this on the fire... and it'll be ready directly. Mmhuh. Ow! Yow! Look, we don't eat meat. It's kind of likea professional courtesy. Perhaps we'll dine with yousome other time. You see, Grace and lare returning to our farm... to say our last goodbyes. Yeah. We need closure. Well, I can sympathize there,sister, I truly can. Until recently,l, too, had a home. Echo Mine it was called. Us jackrabbits lived therefor generation after generation. Till some landgrabbing banditmoved in... and flushed us outlike yesterday's oatmeal. Ahem. Excuse us. My good fellow,we must be on our way. Wait! There he is! Slim! You meanthis nogood varmint... is hiding out in Echo Mineright now? Without a doubt. Maggie, what are you thinking? Look, I got a score to settlewith that rhinestone fat boy... and nothing to lose. But it'll be dangerous goingafter Slim all by yourself. Hey, I got the rabbit. That's not all you got, Maggie.You got us. Oh, no. No, no, no. No. We are sticking to our planand going home. Hold on, you two. As strange as this sounds,Grace is actually making sense. Thank you. You want the money... and I want to get evenwith Slim. The three of us go together,and we're sure to get him. Once you collect the reward,I'll walk out your front gate... and I'll stay out of it forever.Deal? Your powers of persuasionare uncanny. Deal. Ha! Bovine bounty hunters!Now I've seen everything.

Mr. Weaseley,my money, if you please. Heh heh heh. I was justkeeping it safe for you, Slim. Sure you were. Protecting my investmentsis what I pay this fellow for. Mr. Weaseley, let me present... the most traitorous,doublecrossin' gun for hire... that I've ever had the pleasureto call partner__Rico. You're too kind, boss. No, it can't be. His reputation asa bounty hunter is wellknown... but lately he's been doinga little moonlighting... and covering my tracks. Rico's going to see youto the border... so that nothing else goes wrong. Now, if you'll all pardon me... there'sa little Patch of Heaven... on the auction blockthis morning. He's going to buy our farm! Adios! Yeehaw! I don't knowhow you got here, skittish... but stick with me,and you may get to like... the other side of the law. Get on there! Hyah! All right, come on! Come on! Move it, Bessie! Get in there! Hurry up!You don't want to be late... for that big roundupin the sky! Hah! Skittish, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Get in there!Come on, you stupid cows! Come on! Lovely.Now get the engine fired up... and let's make tracks. Huh? Make a break for it,ladies! Run! Whoa! Hah! Skittish, whoa! Buck, have you gone crazy?! Now, that's entirely possible!Yo!

She's right. Unless we sprout wings, we'llnever make it back in time. I can't believewhat I'm hearing. This traingoes right by Patch of Heaven. What is in the cudyou've been chewin'? How are we supposedto drive that thing? How? How? I'll tell you how! The same way we walked offthe farm into the unknown. The same way we fought offthose burly barmaids. And the same way we bravedthe western wilderness... without the benefitof food or water. We caught Slim once,and we shall do it again! Who's with me? Get out of here, you bulls!Head for the hills! Whoo! Let's get it on! Cows rule! Howdy, darlin'! Down here! Yeah! Look__look down!Hello there! Oh, no! I got two words for you guys__cold shower! We don't have timefor this nonsense!

Lilo And Stitch,Disney,2000,2002,Animation,"Read the charges. Dr. Jumba Jookiba, lead scientist of Galaxy Defense Industries, you stand before this council accused of illegal genetic experimentation. How do you plead? Not guilty! My experiments are only theoretical, completely within legal boundaries. We believe you actually created something. Created something? Ha! But that would be irresponsible and unethical. I would never, ever... make more than one. What is that monstrosity? Monstrosity? What you see before you is the first of a new species. I call it experiment 626. He is bulletproof, fireproof and can think faster than supercomputer. He can see in the dark and move objects 3,000 times his size. His only instinct, to destroy everything he touches! So, it is a monster. Hey, just a little one. It is an affront to nature. It must be destroyed! Calm yourself, Captain Gantu. Perhaps it can be reasoned with. Experiment 626, give us some sign you understand any of this. Show us that there is something inside you that is good. Meega, nala kweesta! So naughty! I didn't teach it that. Place that idiot scientist under arrest! I prefer to be called evil genius! And as for that abomination... it is the flawed product of a deranged mind. It has no place among us. Captain Gantu, take him away. With pleasure. Uncomfortable? Oh, good! The council has banished you to exile on a desert asteroid. So, relax, enjoy the trip, and don't get any ideas. These guns are locked onto your genetic signature. They won't shoot anyone but you. Ow! Why, you... May I remind the Captain that he is on duty. Secure the cell! Aye, Captain. Captain on deck. All ahead full. Does this look infected to you? Quiet, you. Gunfire in the cell bay! Open a channel. He's loose on Deck C! Red alert. Seal off the deck! Security, converge on Door 7! Deadly force authorized. Fire on sight! Fire on sight! There he is! Security to bridge. It's in the ventilation system. He's headed for the power... grid. What was that? I don't think he's on the ship anymore. Confirmed. He's taken a police cruiser. Yeah. He took the red one. That's it! We got it. We got it! Hyperdrive activated. System charging. He's engaged his Hdrive! Warning, guidance is not functional. Pursuit Commander, that crazy trog is about to make a jump! Break formation! Get clear of that ship! Navigation failure. Do not engage hyper... Get me Galactic Control. Where is he? He's still in hyperspace. Where will he exit? Calculating now. Quadrant 17, section 005, area 51. A planet called Eearth. I want an expert on this planet in here now! What is that? Water. Most of the planet is covered in it. He won't survive in water. His molecular density is too great. No... Of course. How much time do we have? We have projected his landing at three hours, 42 minutes. Oh, we have to gas the planet. Hold it! Hold everything! Earth is a protected wildlife reserve. Yeah. We've been using it to rebuild the mosquito population which, need I remind you, is an endangered species! Am I to assume you are the expert? Oh, I don't know about expert. Agent Pleakley at your service. Can we not simply destroy the island? No! Crazyhead! The mosquito's food of choice, primitive humanoid life forms, have colonies all over that planet. Are they intelligent? No, but they're very delicate. In fact, every time an asteroid strikes their planet, they have to begin life all over. It's fascinating, isn't it? With this, I've been able to study... What if our military forces just landed there? Well, that'd be a bad idea! These are extremely simple creatures, miss. Landing there would create mass mayhem and planetwide panic! A quiet capture would require an understanding of 626 that we do not possess! Who, then, Mr. Pleakley, would you send for his extraction? Does he have a brother? Close grandmother, perhaps? Friendly cousin? Neighbor with a beard? He got away? I'm sure this comes as no surprise to you. I designed this creature for to be unstoppable. Which is precisely why you must now bring him back. What? Me? And to reward you, we are willing to trade your freedom for his capture. 626 will not come easily. Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon might stun him long enough to... Plasma cannon granted. Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba? But it's a delicate planet! Who's going to control him? You will. Very good, Your Highness. I didn't quite... You're not joking! So, tell me, my little oneeyed one, on what poor, pitiful, defenseless planet has my monstrosity been unleashed? One, two, three, four... Stop. Stop. Lilo, why are you all wet? It's sandwich day. Every Thursday, I take Pudge the fish a peanut butter sandwich. Pudge is a fish? And today we were out of peanut butter! So I asked my sister what to give him and she said a tuna sandwich. I can't give Pudge tuna! Do you know what tuna is? Fish? It's fish! If I gave Pudge tuna, I'd be an abomination! I'm late because I had to go to the store and get peanut butter 'cause all we have is stinkin' tuna! Lilo, Lilo, why is this so important? Pudge controls the weather. You're crazy. Please! Please! Everybody calm down! Girls... Lilo... I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I won't do it again! Maybe we should call your sister. No! I'll be good! I want to dance. I practiced. I just want to dance. I practiced. Ooh, she bit me. I called your sister. She said to wait for her here on the porch. We'll try again on Sunday. Does this look infected to you? Yeah. You better not have rabies. If you have rabies, the dogcatcher is going to have to cut... Are you going to play dolls? You don't have a doll. This is Scrump. I made her, but her head is too big. So I pretend a bug laid eggs in her ears, and she's upset because she only has a few more days to... Lilo! Lilo? Oh, no. You better be home. Hey! Watch where you're going! Stupidhead! Oh, Lilo! Lilo! Open the door, Lilo! Go away. Lilo? We don't have time for this. Leave me alone to die. Come on, Lilo that social worker's going to be here any minute! You are so finished when I get in there! Oh, I'm going to stuff you in the blender, push puree, then bake you into a pie and feed it to the social worker! And when he says, mmm, this is great. What's your secret? I'm going to say... Love and nurturing. Hi... You must be the... The stupidhead. Oh, you know, I'm really sorry about that and if I'd known who you were, of course I never would've... I can pay for that. It's a rental. Are you the guardian in question? Yes. I'm Nani. Nice to meet you, Mister... Bubbles. Mr. Bubbles. That's a strange... Yes, I know. Are you going to invite me in, Nani? I thought we could sit out here and talk. I don't think so. Right... This way. Wait here. Hey! So, lemonade? Do you often leave your sister home alone? No. Never. Well, except for just now. I had to run to the store to get some... You left the stove on while you were out? Low heat! Just a simmer. It's coming along great. I found that this morning. Lilo! There you are. Honeyface, this is Mr. Bubbles. Nice to meet you. Your knuckles say Cobra. Cobra Bubbles. You don't look like a social worker. I'm a special classification. Did you ever kill anyone? We're getting off the subject. Let's talk about you. Are you happy? I'm adjusted. I eat four food groups and look both ways before crossing the street and take long naps and get disciplined. Disciplined? Yeah. She disciplines me real good. Sometimes five times a day. With bricks. No... Bricks? In a pillowcase. Okay! That's enough sugar for you. Why don't you run along, you little cutie. The other social workers just thought she was a scream. Thirsty? Let me illuminate to you the precarious situation in which you have found yourself. I am the one they call when things go wrong, and things have indeed gone wrong. My friends need to be punished. Call me next time you're left here alone. Yep. In case you're wondering, this did not go well. You have three days to change my mind. Lilo! Why didn't you wait at the school? You were supposed to wait there! Lilo! Do you not understand? Do you want to be taken away? Answer me! No! No, you don't understand? No! No, what? No! You're such a pain! So why don't you sell me and buy a rabbit instead? At least a rabbit would behave better than you! Go ahead! Then you'll be happy because it'll be smarter than me too! And quieter! You'll like it, 'cause it's stinky, like you! Go to your room! I'm already in my room! Hey. I brought you some pizza, in case you were hungry. We're a broken family, aren't we? No. Maybe, a little. Maybe a lot. I shouldn't have yelled at you. We're sisters. It's our job. Yeah, well, from now on... I like you better as a sister than a mom. Yeah? And you like me better as a sister than a rabbit, right? Yes. Yes, I do. I hit Mertle Edmonds today. You hit her? Before I bit her. You bit her. Lilo, you shouldn't... People treat me different. They just don't know what to say. I'll tell you what. If you promise not to fight anymore I promise not to yell at you, except on special occasions. Tuesdays and bank holidays would be good. Yeah? Would that be good? Oh! My camera's full again. Aren't they beautiful? A falling star! I call it! Get out! Get out! I have to make a wish! Can't you go any faster? Oh, no! Gravity is increasing on me. No, it's not! It is too, Lilo. The same thing happened yesterday. You rotten sister! Your butt is crushing me! Why do you act so weird? It's me again. I need someone to be my friend. Someone who won't run away. Maybe send me an angel. The nicest angel you have. What we when hit? There it is. It stay jammed under the fender. We better call somebody. We're looking for something that can defend itself... Something that won't die. Something sturdy, you know? Like a lobster. Lilo, you lolo. Do we have a lobster door? No. We have a dog door. We are getting a dog. So nice to see your pretty face again! Jumba? We need your name and address at the bottom of the form... The kennel's back this way. Go. Pick someone out. Hello? Are there any aminals in here? Hello! Hi. Oh, yes. All of our dogs are adoptable. Except that one! What is that thing? A dog, I think. But it was dead this morning. It was dead this morning? Well, we thought it was dead. It was hit by a truck. I like him! Come here, boy. Wouldn't you like a different dog? We have better dogs, dear. Not better than him. He can talk! Say hello. Dogs can't talk, dear. He did. Does it have to be this dog? Yes, he's good. I can tell. You'll have to think of a name for him. His name is Stitch. Now, that's not a real name... in Iceland, but here, it's a good name. Stitch it is. And there's a two dollar license fee. I want to buy him! Can I borrow two dollars? He's all yours. You're all mine. Well, what's he doing? Keep quiet. He's listening for us. How good is his hearing? I mean, can he... Why don't you run? Coming! I'm coming! Stop! I have just determined this situation to be far too hazardous! Don't worry, I won't hit her. No! That girl is a part of the mosquito food chain. Here! Educate yourself. Using a little girl for a shield. This is low, even for you! Tear him apart with all both my bare hands! Have you lost your mind? What is it, Stitch? We cannot be seen! Bad dog, barking at nothing! You can't shoot, and you can't be seen. Look at you! You look like a monster. We have to blend in. Okay, I got to get to work. Stick around town and stay out of the roads, okay? I'll meet you at 1:00. Okay, I guess we should be going. What about Stitch? My friends! What do you want? I'm sorry I bit you and pulled your hair and punched you in the face. Apology not accepted. Now get out of my way before I run you over. I got a new dog. His name is Stitch. That is the ugliest thing I have ever saw. Yeah. Yeah. Eww! Get it away from me! I'm gonna get a disease! Somebody do something! Oh, great! He's loose. His destructive programming is taking effect. He will be irresistibly drawn to large cities where he will back up sewers, reverse street signs and steal everyone's left shoe. It's nice to live on an island with no large cities. Are you okay? Hey, over here, little buddy. When you're ready to give up just let us know, heh? Yeah! This is you. This is your badness level. It's unusually high for someone your size. We have to fix that. Ayyiyi, Lilo! Your dog cannot sit at the table. Stitch is troubled. He needs desserts. Oh, you didn't even eat your sweet potato. I thought you liked them. Desserts! David! I got a new dog. You sure it's a dog? He used to be a collie before he got ran over. Hey... Howzit, Nani? Did you catch fire again? Nah, just the stage. Listen, I was wondering if you're not doing anything this... David, I told you, I can't. I... I got a lot to deal with right now. I know. I just figured you might need some time... You smell like a lawn mower. Look, I got to go. The kid at Table 3's throwing poi again. Maybe some other time, okay? Don't worry. She likes your butt and fancy hair. I know. I read her diary. She thinks it's fancy? Aha! Look what I find! Get restraints! Right. Take that! Hurry! Hold still just a... Hey, Nani! Is that your dog? All is well. Please, go about your business. I'm okay. Oh, your head looks swollen. Actually, she's just ugly. Darling. He's joking. Ugly, look at me... This is not working out. But... Yeah? Well, who wants to work at this stupid... fakey luau anyway. Come on, Lilo. Did you lose your job because of Stitch and me? Nah. The manager's a vampire and he wanted me to join his legion of the undead. I knew it. This is a great home. You'll like it a lot. See? Lilo... Comfy. Hey! Hey! What is the matter with you? Be careful of the little angel! It's not an angel, Lilo. I don't even think it's a dog. We just have to take him back. He's just cranky because it's his bedtime. He's creepy, Lilo. I won't sleep while he's loose in the house. You're loose in the house all the time and I sleep just fine! Hey, what are you doing? Stop that, Stitch! Hey! Look at him, Lilo. He's obviously mutated from something else. We have to take him back. He was an orphan and we adopted him! What about ohana? He hasn't been here that long. Neither have I. Dad said ohana means family. Ohana means family. Family means... Nobody gets left behind. Or? Or forgotten. I know. I know. I hate it when you use ohana against me. Don't worry, you can sleep right next to me. Look how curious the puppy is. This is my room, and this is your bed. This is your dolly and bottle. See? Doesn't spill. I filled it with coffee. Good puppy. Now get into bed. Hey! That's mine! Down! Be careful of that! You don't touch this! Don't ever touch it! No! Don't pull on her head! She's recovering from surgery. No! That's from my blue period. There. You know, you wreck everything you touch. Why not try and make something for a change? Wow. San Francisco. Save me! No more caffeine for you. This little girl is wasting her time. 626 cannot be taught to ignore its destructive programming. Push that over. What are you doing? Nothing! Say, I want to try it on. No! Share! Let me try it! Hey! Ow! You're just jealous 'cause I'm pretty! Don't move. A mosquito has chosen me as her perch. She's so beautiful. Look, another one. And another one! Why, it's a whole flock. And they like me! They're nuzzling my flesh with their noses. Now, they're, they're... I think it might be a koala. An evil koala. I can't even pet it. It keeps staring at me, like it's going to eat me. Hello? Nani? Hello? Are you there? Now, this is interesting. What? 626 was designed to be a monster but now he has nothing to destroy. You see, I never gave him a greater purpose. What must it be like to have nothing... Not even memories to visit in the middle of the night? That's the Ugly Duckling. See? He's sad because he's all alone and nobody wants him but on this page, his family hears him crying and they find him. Then the Ugly Duckling is happy because he knows where he belongs. Want to listen to the King? You look like an Elvis fan. Nani. Nani! Yeah? Look. We can't go on together  With suspicious minds...  Cious minds...  Can build our dreams...  On suspicious minds...  Heard you lost your job. Well, actually, I just quit that job because, you know, the hours are just not conducive to the challenges of raising a child... Hey! I am so sorry about that. What is that thing? That's my puppy. Really? Thus far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience, but I cannot ignore you being jobless. Do I make myself clear? Perfectly. And next time I see this dog, I expect it to be a model citizen. Capisce? Yes? New job. Model citizen. Good day. Mrs. Hasagawa? I'm here to answer your newspaper ad. Elvis Presley was a model citizen. I've compiled a list of his traits for you to practice. Number one is dancing. I can't talk now, dear. I'm waiting for someone to answer my ad. That's why I'm here. Hands on your hips. Now follow my lead. Ah! That's my want ad. I know! Why is everything so dark? I am all about coffee. Let's move on to step two. Elvis played guitar. Here. Hold it like this, and put your fingers here. See? Now you try. And I make great cappuccinos and lattes with... I wish I could, Nani, but I just hired Teddy and with tourist season ending... Conciergeering is my life. I just love to answer phones... This is the face of romance. She looks like she could use some lovin'. Oh, we might have something. Good. Now kiss her. I'm sure Elvis had his bad days too. I'm all about saving people? Actually, I do think we have an opening. Really? Okay, this is it. Time to bring it all together. Oh, that'd be so great! You have no idea how badly I need this job. It's all you! Knock 'em dead! Don't crowd him! Hey, knock it off! Hey, Lilo! Howzit, Nani? We've been having a bad day. Hey, I might not be a doctor but I know that there's no better cure for a sour face than a couple of boards and some choice waves. What you think? I think that's a great idea. Oh, can't complain, Mom. I'm camping out with a convicted criminal and, oh, I had my head chewed on by a monster! Wait... Something is not right. 626 is returning willingly to water. Oh, hold on, Mom, another call. Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue. I want a status report. Oh, things are going well. He cannot swim! Things are going well. Jumba, aren't they going well? Why will he risk drowning? Jumba? Jumba, help me out here. I would have expected you back by now, with 626 in hand. Just a few things left to pack and we'll be... Hang up. We are going swimming. Yeah! Lilo! What happened? Oh, some lolo must have stuffed us in the barrel. Where's Stitch? Get off of her! What happened? Stitch dragged her down. We lost Stitch! Lilo? Lilo, look at me. Look at me, baby. Are you hurt? No. He's unconscious, but I think he's alive. David, take Lilo. This isn't what it looks like. We were... It's just that... I know you're trying, Nani, but you need to think about what's best for Lilo... Even if it removes you from the picture. I'll be back tomorrow morning for Lilo. I'm sorry. Nani? Is there something I can do? No, David. I need to take Lilo home now. We have a lot to talk about, you know. Thanks. You know, I really believed they had a chance. Then you came along. Lilo, honey... We have to... Don't worry. You're nice, and someone will give you a job. I would. Come here. One fond embrace  Until we meet again  That's us before... It was rainy, and they went for a drive. What happened to yours? I hear you cry at night. Do you dream about them? I know that's why you wreck things and push me. Our family's little now and we don't have many toys, but if you want, you could be part of it. You could be our baby and we'd raise you to be good. Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind but if you want to leave, you can. I'll remember you though. I remember everyone that leaves. Lost. I'm lost. Help! I don't like the ocean! Oh, look, a friendly little dolphin. They helped sailors in the war... It's a shark! It's a shark, and it ain't friendly! It looks like a dolphin. Tricky fish! Tricky fish! Oh, octopus, come and help me? An octo... octopus is worse than a shark! I hate this planet! Little monster! Agent Pleakley here. I have lost patience with you both. Have you captured 626 or not? Consider yourselves fired and prisonbound. Your incompetence is nothing short of unspeakable! But... We're fired! Now we do it my way! Your way? Oh, wait! It seems I have overestimated Jumber and Blinkley. Jumba and Pleakley. Whatever. The mission is in jeopardy. This could be your chance to redeem yourself, Captain Gantu. How soon will you be prepared to leave? Immediately. Don't run. Don't make me shoot you. You were expensive. Yes. Yes, that's it. Come quietly. Waiting. For what? Family. You don't have one. I made you. Maybe I could... You're built to destroy. You can never belong. Now come quietly and we will take you apart. No, no, no, no, don't, don't run! Don't run! Lilo. I didn't hear you get up. Baby, what's wrong? Stitch left. Really? It's good he's gone. He didn't want to be here anyway. We don't need him. Lilo... Sometimes you try your hardest but things don't work out the way you want them to. Sometimes things have to change and maybe sometimes they're for the better... even if... Nani! David! I think I found you a job. You what? Old man Kukhkini's store, but we got to hurry. Oh, okay. Lilo? Baby, this is really important. I need you to stay here for a few minutes. I'm going to be right back. Lock the door and don't answer it for anyone, okay? Things are finally turning around. David, I owe you one. That's okay. You can just date me, and we'll call it even. Come back here, you little... Stitch? What is it? Oh, hiding behind your little friend won't work anymore. Didn't I tell you? We got fired this morning. New rules. What are we going to do? Ooh! I love this song! Pliers. Screwdriver. Check. Come out, my friend from whomever you're hiding behind. What the... Come on! What's the big deal? I'll put you back together again. I'll make you taller and not so fluffy! I like fluffy! No... No... No! Oh, leave my mother out of this! You could do with a makeover. I tried to give you my good looks, but let's face it, something went wrong. No! Quick! Follow me! If we make it to... You're alive! They're all over the place! Running away? Here... Let me stop you. You always get in the way! Where's the girl? What have you done to the girl? Hello? Cobra Bubbles? Aliens are attacking my house. No, no, no! No aliens! Blue punch buggy! No punch back. They want my dog! There's no need to alert the authorities. Everything's under control. Lilo, who was that? Oh, good, my dog found the chainsaw. Lilo! Don't hang... You shouldn't play with guns. Oh, okay. Thank you. Oh, I just remembered. It's your birthday! Happy birthday! Merry Christmas! It's not Christmas. Happy Hanukkah! We're leaving Stitch? Trust me. This is not going to end well. One potato. Two potato. Three potato. Four. Five potato. Six potato. Seven potato, more. My... Mother... Told... Me... You... Are... It. Oh, I win! Thanks. Mahalo plenty. You won't be disappointed. I'll show up early to help with the morning deliver... Oh, don't turn left. No. One of them had a giant eye in the middle of his face. Oh, Lilo! Please don't do this. You know I have no choice. No! You're not taking her! I'm the only one who understands her! You take that away, she won't stand a chance! You're making this harder than it needs to be. You don't know what you're doing! She needs me! Is this what she needs? It seems clear to me that you need her a lot more than she needs you. Lilo! Lilo! Lilo! Lilo! Lilo! Lilo! Lilo! You ruined everything. You're one of them? Get out of here, Stitch. Surprise! And here I thought you'd be difficult to catch. Silly me. Lilo? Lilo! There you go, all buckled up for the trip. And, look, I even caught you a little snack. No! Stop! Lilo. Okay, talk. I know you had something to do with this. Now where is Lilo? Talk! I know you can. Okay, okay. Where's Lilo? Lilo... Now all your washing is up! You're under arrest! Read him his rights. Listen carefully. Hello? Galactic command? Experiment 626 is in custody. We'll wait right here. Don't interact with her. Where's Lilo? Who? What? Lilo. My sister. Sorry, we do not know anyone by this... Lilo! She's a little girl, this big! She has black hair and brown eyes and she hangs around with that thing! We know her. Bring her back. Oh, we can't do that. That would be a misuse of Galactic resources. See, problem is... We're just here for him. So she's gone? Look at the bright side. You won't have to yell at anyone anymore. Come. Ohana. Hey! Get away from her. No! What did you say? Ohana means family. Family means... Nobody gets left behind. Or forgotten. Yeah. Hey... What? After all you put me through you expect me to help you just like that? Just like that? Fine. Fine? You're doing what he says? He's very persuasive. Persuasive? What exactly are we doing? Rescue. We're going to get Lilo? Oh, good! I was hoping to add theft, endangerment and insanity to my list of things I did today. You too? Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah! What? Did you think we walked here? This is Gantu, requesting hyperspace clearance. Stand by for clearance. Clearance is granted on vector C12. Connect me to the Grand Councilwoman. Gantu, what's going on? I thought you'd like to know that the little abomination is... Yes, Captain? I'll call you back. How did you get out of there? So what exactly are we doing? Don't worry, is all part of plan. We are professionals. Hey! Get that out of your mouth! Hold on! Okay, is show time! This is it! Go! Go! Go! Little savage! Get off my ship! Stitch! Computer, locate experiment 626. 626 located. We finish this now. Stitch is unconscious. What do we do now? We stay close. Hope for a miracle. That's all we can do. No! Don't leave me, okay? Okay. Okay. Target 626 is in motion. Speed is 84. Impossible! Stitch! Abomination. Stupidhead. Aloha! You're vile! You're foul! You're flawed! Also cute and fluffy! You came back. Nobody gets left behind. Lilo! Good dog. David! Hey, Lilo. Can you give us a ride to shore? Sure! But I have to make two trips. So you're from outer space, huh? I heard the surfing's choice. We have 626. Take him to my ship. Leave him alone. Hold on. Grand Councilwoman, let me explain. Silence! I am retiring you, Captain Gantu. Actually, credit for the capture goes to... Goes to me. You'll be lucky if you end up on a Fluff Trog farm after we sort this thing out. I think I should... You! You're the cause of all this! If it wasn't for your Experiment 626, none of this... Stitch. What? My name Stitch. Stitch then. If it wasn't for Stitch... Does Stitch have to go in the ship? Yes. Can Stitch say goodbye? Yes. Thank you. Who are you? This is my family. I found it all on my own. It's little and broken. But still good. Yeah. Still good. Does he really have to go? You know as well as I that our laws are absolute. I cannot change what the council has decided. Lilo, didn't you buy that thing at the shelter? Hey! Three days ago, I bought Stitch at the shelter. I paid two dollars for him. See this stamp? I own him. If you take him, you're stealing. Aliens are all about rules. You look familiar. CIA. Roswell. 1973. Ah, yes. You had hair then. Take note of this. This creature has been sentenced to life in exile, a sentence that shall be henceforth served out here... on Earth... And as caretaker of the alien lifeform, Stitch, this family is now under the official protection of the United Galactic Federation. We'll be checking in now and then. I was afraid you were going to say that. This won't be easy to explain back at headquarters. I know what you mean. Don't let those two get on my ship. CIA? Former. Saved the planet once. Convinced an alien race that mosquitoes were an endangered species. Now, about your house... Wait."
Meet the Robinsons,Disney,2000,2007,Animation,"Then I didn't choose that one because it was gonna give me pimples, so I choosed another scary one because, for all those years that I went for Halloween, I wasn't scary at all. I love baseball. It's my destiny to play that game. I don't really care about winning. Well, like, now I do 'cause, like, we've lost every game. I've gotten tired of it. I'm working, like, so hard. All the balls are getting thrown to me. I'm trying to catch, like, every one. All of the people in the outfield are all looking around and... Come on! Let's play some baseball, okay? Not the lazy game. They're here. Lewis? Lewis? Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it! They are gonna love this! Nothing says ""adopt me"" like a weird invention. Lewis! Lewis, the Harringtons are here! Way ahead of you, Mildred. Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Remember, sit up straight. Look them in the eye. Smile. Let's fix your... Mildred. All right, all right, all right, all right. Go show them how special you are. Oh, I hope this is it. I hope he gets adopted. You and me both, chief. I mean, there's so many things in the world that can be improved. Just think of it. Moving sidewalks, flying cars. The possibilities are endless. Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one. All it takes is some imagination and a little science, and we can make the world a better place. Well, these are all interesting ideas. So, what's your favourite sport? Well, does inventing count as a sport? Actually... 'Cause I think I hit a home run with this one! What is that? First, a question. What's the number one problem that you face when you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Lewis, I don't think we... Portion control. Too much peanut butter sticks to the roof of your mouth, takes forever to chew. Too much jelly squishes out the sides and makes your hands all sticky. Well, I propose that the perfect P.B. and J. is within mankind's grasp, and I've built this machine to achieve it. For this demonstration, I'll use regular bread. Honey, it's okay. As you can see, toasting is an option. We don't usually eat peanut butter. Lewis, this is really not necessary. It's jammed! Lewis, please, don't! What's happening? Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy! I'm sorry! Here let me help you get that off! Stand back! Is he gonna be okay? Breathe. Breathe. I'm so sorry! I didn't know! It was really nice to meet you. We're gonna need some time to think about it. Hi, folks. Everything all... What happened? Miss Duffy, that boy is definitely not right for us. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm so sorry about this. If you would just... I made some lunch. Not hungry. Poor Mr Harrington. I killed him? No. No! No, you didn't kill him. I called. He's perfectly fine. I was just gonna say that it's... It's too bad he didn't get to try a sandwich from that wonderful invention of yours. Yeah, real wonderful. It's not you. We just haven't found the right couple yet. One hundred twentyfour. What? That's how many adoption interviews I've had, 124. Oh, Lewis, come on, now. You're exaggerating just to make your point. Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year, and you know how hard it is for a teenager to get adopted. I have no future. No one wants me. That's not true, Lewis! My own mother didn't even want me. Now, stop it. You do not know that. Then why'd she give me up? She may not have been able to take care of you. Did you ever think of that? I am sure that she was only thinking about what was best for you. I never thought of it that way. Maybe she wanted to keep you, but she had no choice. You're right. My real mom is the only person who's ever wanted me. Wait. I said ""maybe."" And if she wanted me then, she'll want me now. What are you talking about? I have to find her, Mildred, and when I do, she'll take me back, and we'll be a family again! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Lewis, you can't do that. No one knows anything about her. No one even saw her. Wrong. I saw her once. She's in here. I just have to remember. That's it! Hello I got something to tell you But it's crazy I got something to show you So give me just one more chance One more glance And I will make of you Another believer Guess what? You got more than you bargained Ain't it crazy? You got more than you paid for So give me just one more chance One more glance One more hand to hold You've been on my mind Though it may seem I'm fooling Wasted so much time Though it may seem I'm fooling What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do about it? You've been on my mind One more chance Wasted so much time One more chance So tired. We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon. He'll be so excited you're coming. Byebye, now. Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael. Good luck at the big game today. Easy win. Those guys are a bunch of bums. I just hope I can stay awake. Don't tell me. Let me guess. He was up all night working on his stupid project, but that's what happens when you get a science geek for a roommate. Ah, that's good joe. All right, Einstein, you owe Michael big time. Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain took a lot longer than I expected, but it's finished, Mildred. I recalibrated the headset. Now the neural circuits will connect. I've cracked the hippocampus! Really? Okay. What? Now to test it out. Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go! Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute. I almost forgot what I came up here for. I know you have a lot on your plate today, but I've scheduled an interview for you this afternoon. No, thanks. ""No, thanks""? Sweetheart, this is about being adopted, and you will be back here clean, happy and on time. I'm done with interviews, Mildred. I'm not gonna be rejected anymore. Listen, I know where your head is, but I'm telling you, you have got to get out of the past and look to the future. I am, and this is it. This is my future. I'm sorry. Lewis? Honey? Dr Krunklehorn, I know you're very busy there at Inventco Labs, and we're just so excited to have you as a judge. It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein. Hey, you never know. One of your students may invent the next integrated circuit or microprocessor or integrated circuit. Oh, wait! I said that already. Well, I just don't get out of that lab very much. Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties. I haven't slept in eight days! Well, then can I get you a cot or something? Nope, I've got the caffeine patch. It's my invention. Each patch is the equivalent of 12 cups of coffee. You can stay awake for days with no side effects. Sorry. Who's this? This is one of our students, Stanley Pukowski. Oh, so cute! I just want to bite his chubby little cheeks! What's with the dress, Pukowski? It's actually a toga, sir. Coach, nice to see you, sort of. What are you doing here? Judging a science fair. What's it look like I'm doing? And what makes you qualified to judge a science fair? It's my gym. Stanley. Volcano. Behold the awesome power of Mount Vesuvius! The toggle switch isn't toggling. Dr Krunklehorn? Barium, cobalt, Einstein, KoolAid! I don't know what she just said, but this project is unacceptable! Now, give me 20 laps around the gym! Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go! Coach! I'm watching you. Okay, next up is Lizzy and her fire ant farm. That's right. Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants. You know that they have a tendency to bite people. Only my enemies. Just keep moving, shall we? Top notch, Lizzy! Let's not anger her or make her jumpy in any way. This area's not secure. Get in. Have you been approached by a tall man in a bowler hat? What? Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here. Okay, goodbye. All right, didn't want to pull rank on you, but you forced my hand. Special Agent Wilbur Robinson of the T.C.T.F. The what? Time Continuum Task Force. I'm here to protect you. Well... Now, tall man, bowler hat, approached you? No, why? I could lose my badge for this. He's a suspect in a robbery. What did he steal? A time machine. A what? I've tracked him to this time, and my informants say he's after you. Me? Why me? The boys back at HQ haven't figured out a motive yet. And by ""HQ,"" I mean ""headquarters."" I know what HQ means. Good. You're a smart kid. That might keep you alive, for now. Just worry about your little science gizmo and leave the ""perp"" to me. And by ""perp,"" I mean... I know what it means! Okay, Mr Smartypants. Bowler Hat Guy! My frogs! You're not gonna get away with it, kid with science project. Dude, you almost busted my solar system! My frogs! They're getting away! Got you! That's the last of them. Annoying little girl, I don't have time for this. I'm on a very important... Don't sass me, boy. I know karate. Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain! Love the pain! Coach... Next up is Lewis. Yes... Lewis! Excuse me. Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna... It's okay. It's gonna work this time. I won't let you down, I promise. All right, Lewis, I trust you. Knock 'em dead. That was a figure of speech. Please don't kill anyone. Okay, stand back, everybody. This next project will knock your socks off. Seriously, you might wanna stand back a little. Have you ever forgotten something, and no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't remember it? Well, what happens to these forgotten memories? I propose they're stored somewhere in your brain, and I built a machine that can retrieve them. I call it the Memory Scanner. It's shiny! So, Lewis, how does the Memory Scanner work? First, you input the desired period of time on this keypad. Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex, where memories are stored. The retrieved memory is then displayed on this monitor. Wrap him up. I'll take two. Now, I'm going back 12 years, three months and 11 days. Why that particular day? You didn't think I was paying attention, did you? Well, that was the day... Let's just say, that was a very important day in my life. Fair enough. Play ball. It'll just take a second to get the turbines going. Lewis, wait! She's gonna blow! Watch out! Feel the pain! Love the... Hurts so much! Make it stop! Make it stop! Coach, suck it up, okay? Let us conduct ourselves in a way that we'll all be proud of tomorrow. Let's calm down! Mr Willerstein? I didn't mean to... Not now, Lewis! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Not now. Okay, and we are walking in a calm, orderly fashion toward the exits. Wait, Lewis! Come, my dear. Our future awaits. Hey, what are you doing up here? Would you quit that, please? I know you're not a pigeon. You're blowing my cover. We're the only ones up here. That's just what they want you to think. Now, enough moping. Take this back to the science fair and fix that Memory Scanner. Stop! Stop! Get away from me! Maybe you've forgotten. I'm a time cop from the future, should be taken very seriously. That's no badge. This is a coupon for a tanning salon! You're a fake. Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop, but I really am from the future, and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy. Here we go again. He stole a time machine, came to the science fair and ruined your project. My project didn't work because I'm no good. There is no Bowler Hat Guy, there is no time machine, and you're not from the future! You're crazy! I am not crazy. Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel? Prove it. Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm just gonna go lock myself in my room and hide under the covers for a couple years. If I prove to you I'm from the future, will you go back to the science fair? Yeah, sure, whatever you say. Hey, let go of me! What are you doing? Let go of me! Okay. What is this? Where are we going? To the future! The future has arrived The future has arrived today The future has arrived The future has arrived today Is this proof enough for you? Is it ever! I never thought that time travel could be possible in my lifetime, and here it is, right in front of me! The truth will set you free, brother. This is beyond anything I could've imagined. This means I could really change my life. That's right. You can. Next stop, science fair, to fix your Memory Scanner. Hey, I'm not gonna fix that stupid Memory Scanner. What? Wilbur, this is a time machine! Why should I fix my dumb invention when you can take me to see my mom now in this ship? I could actually go back to that night and stop her from giving me up. The answer is not a time machine. It's this. This? You want to know what I think about this? What are you doing? I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you don't know what I've lived through. Lewis, no! Let go! You let go! You're not the boss of me! Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13. That makes me older. Well, I was born in the past, which makes me older and the boss of you! I am so dead. I'm not allowed to look at this thing, let alone drive it! Mom and Dad are gonna kill me, and I can tell you this. It will not be done with mercy. Isn't there like a time machine repair shop or something? No! There's only two time machines in existence, and the Bowler Hat Guy has the other one! Well, somebody's gonna have to fix this. Good idea. You're smart. You fix it. Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing. Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it. All right, under one condition. I fix it, you take me back to see my mom. What? You didn't even follow through on our last deal. How can I trust you? Well, you told me you were a time cop from the future. How can I trust you? Touché. So do we have a deal? Good day, madam. I'm here to change the future. Yes, sir? I must speak with the man in charge immediately. Yes, sir. I have an appointment with destiny. Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know, and I'll have your dry cleaning delivered directly to your suite. What? Now, what time is your appointment? Are you talking to me? Yes. What time is your appointment? Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00! You're the 2:00? Yes. Yes, I am. You're Mary Johnson? Yes. Mary is short for... Marian? Can that be a boy name? Yes. Then yes. Have a seat. Oh, goody! ""Pass off invention as my own."" Check. Oh, I love checklists. The board is ready to see you now. Wait. What am I going to say? I'm never gonna remember that. Would you... Why don't you go? You do it so much better than me. That's true. A hat without a head couldn't really pass off an invention as its own. Fantastic! Great idea! I'm so glad I have you! ""Prepare to be amazed."" Oh, I got it! Prepare to be amazed! ""This is my invention."" ""I doubt any of you have seen anything as brilliant as this device."" Very well, Miss Johnson? It's Ms. You have two minutes. Please begin. It's shiny! What is that thing? Well, I like to call it my... To call it my... What are you looking at? No! I... The sun, in my eyes. Well, then let me close the blinds. Now, the name? Well, what... We can quibble about names at a later date. The point is, what I have here is special, unique. Yes. Yes, you must love it and buy it and mass produce it, and the best part is, it's got really comfy headphones. I wonder, could you lean forward just a little bit, please? Yes, thank you. Yes, they are quite comfortable. What do you hope to accomplish with this? Oh, nothing of consequence. I simply wish to crush the dreams of a poor little orphan boy! After that, it's all a little fuzzy. You mean, you haven't thought this through? Thirty seconds. Allow me to show you how it works. First, we turn it on. That's not it. Ten seconds. So where do I sign? Doris, it's all over. All our hopes and dreams dashed, like so many pieces of a broken machiney thing. You're right. Success is still ours for the taking. We must find that boy. We'll sneak this thing into the garage. You'll have all the tools you need. What about your parents? Mom never goes in there, and Dad's on a business trip until tomorrow morning. You've got till then to fix it. Well, fine, but I'm gonna need some blueprints or something for this. No worries. I got someone who could help us with that. Who dares to disturb my sanctuary? Carl, it's me. Let me in. None may enter unless they speak the royal password. Carl, what are you talking about? We don't have a password. Yes, we do. I made one up while you were gone. Well, then how am I supposed to know what it is? You... Good point. Welcome back, little buddy. So what's up with the stolen time machine? Did you find it? Apparently not, and you managed to bust this one as well. It'll be fixed before Dad gets home. And how do you suppose that's gonna... Who's that? Wow, a real robot! Hi, I'm Lewis. Well, that was unexpected. As was that. If my family finds out I brought you from the past, they'll bury me alive and dance on my grave. I'm not exaggerating. Well, yes, I am, but not the point. The point is, your hair's a dead giveaway. Why would my hair be a dead giveaway? That is an excellent question. Wait! Where are you going? Another excellent question. But I don't just want to sit here. Stay. But... Wow! Hey, ring my doorbell. No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell. Ring it. Ring it. Ring it. Look at this door bell. Ring it. Yes! That was accidental. That's an accidental ring. It doesn't count. It's in the rule book. Look it up. Flat head. Short roots. Evergreen. What do you mean, don't go to the family? How can we not go to the family in this time of family crisis? By leaving the garage door unlocked, you let the time machine get stolen, and now the entire time stream could be altered! That and someone took my bike. Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out. First, we keep Lewis in the garage, away from everybody. I show up and give him the pep talk of the century. Then he fixes the time machine. Why is it an acorn? I didn't have time to sculpt everything. Okay, now, the time machine is fixed. His confidence in inventing is restored. He goes back to the science fair, fixes his Memory Scanner, thus restoring the spacetime continuum. What about taking him back to see his mom? I just told him that to buy some time. Oh, yeah, can't see that one blowing up in your face. Trust me. I got it under control. Wilbur Robinson never fails. But on the slight chance that I do... ""On the slight chance,"" yeah. You know what? I'll run the numbers. What is it? Well, it's not... It doesn't pertain to anything in... You know, there's not necessarily... There's a 99.999999% chance that you won't exist. What? And I didn't want to tell you, but I did. I won't exist? And where does that leave me? Alone, rusting in a corner. What am I worried about? Now, blueprints? If this thing ever blows over, I really gotta get away from you and get some quiet time. What's... Well, hey, there, little fella! Now, I know what you're thinking, and my clothes are not on backwards. My head is! Oh, I used to tell that one to my science students. They didn't laugh, either. Anywho, what's your name, fruithead? Well, Lewis, but... Lewis, huh? Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen any teeth around here, have you? Teeth? Yeah, my teeth. Been digging holes all day. Can't find them anywhere. All right, look, old man, I need to get back to the garage. Wilbur left me down there, and I wasn't supposed to leave, and these monsters... Monsters? ... attacked me on the porch and... There's no monsters on the porch, you ninny. Listen to me! Of course, I also didn't think there was a woodchuck living on my arm, and lookie there! Hope he ain't got rabies. Old man, I need to get to the garage! Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy. I know a shortcut. Welcome to the garage. Well, I'm completely lost. Hiya, Grandpa. Hey, Aunt Billie. Lewis and me are looking for the garage. We have a garage? Apparently so. Lewis, will you give me a hand and time my race? Okay, Gaston, my toy train's ready for you. That's a toy train? On your mark, get set, go? 3.7 seconds. I win! Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints. Lewis? And five and six and seven and eight. That's Uncle Joe. He works out. Keep those tummies tucked. This isn't the garage. I know. I don't think the garage is in here, either. Egads! A very grave matter, indeed. That's Uncle Art. A real superhero? Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy, needs a large cheeseandsausage thincrust? I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free. He's a... Pizza delivery guy. Lewis? What are we doing up here? Looking for the garage. Oh, yeah! Laszlo, you stop painting my hat, or I'm telling Ma! Lighten up, sis! Lasz, I mean it! Children, please! Your mother is trying to take a nap. What is all the yelling out here? He started it! She started it! I don't want to hear any more! Now, sweetie... Don't you ""sweetie"" me! I'm going for a drive! That's strange. She usually takes the Harley. Lewis! I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies. Bake them cookies, Lucille! Why is your dog wearing glasses? Oh, 'cause his insurance won't pay for contacts. That's Uncle Spike, and there's Uncle Dimitri. Oh, look, there's... That's the monster! Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty. Nice to meet you. Hey, Lefty, any idea how to get to the garage? Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet. Who? Wilbur's mom, Franny. I think you'll like her. Hey, guys! You ask me over And over and over Have you seen My peacockfeathered hat? Frogs? Taught them everything they know. Franny, this is Lewis. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Perfect timing. We need someone on maracas. Where is your heart at? Nobody knows that Even though you've him, her, me And an army searching I've got a feeling You will be reeling When you are bad And the circus comes to town Grandpa, I think I found your teeth. And you see me leaving Dressed up as a magician Or something like that Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back! Ringadingding. All right! Right. Well, glad I could help with the teeth, but, wow, look at the time. Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage! I did, but I went up the tube, and I ran into your family, and I... You met my family? Pop quiz. Who have you met, and what have you learnt? Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers. Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she... Cranky? Yes. Tallulah and Laszlo are their children. Joe is married to Billie. Lefty is the butler. Spike and Dimitri are twins, and I don't know who they're related to. Neither do we. Go on. Lucille is married to Bud, and your dad, Cornelius, is their son. What does Cornelius look like? Tom Selleck. Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny, and her brothers are Gaston and Art. You're forgetting something. Forgetting? Oh, right. Wilbur is the son of Franny and Cornelius. And nobody realised you were from the past? Nope. Thank you. Thank you. Hold your applause. Thank you very much. Doris, get it off! Get it off! I've got you now. Lewis! No, Lewis is my stupid roommate. My name's Mike Yagoobian. People call me Goob, but today, everyone that beat me up called me ""puke face"" and ""butterfingers"" and ""booger breath."" Nice to see that they're branching out. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Well, I was just looking for Lewis. Try the roof. He's always up there being dumb. Of course. Why didn't I think of that? Mr Steak, you're my only friend. Game didn't go so well, huh? No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning, and I missed the winning catch. Then I got beat up. Afterwards, Coach took me aside and told me to let it go. I don't know. He's probably right. No! Everyone will tell you to let it go and move on, but don't. Instead, let it fester and boil inside of you. Take these feelings and lock them away. Let them fuel your actions. Let hate be your ally, and you will be capable of wonderfully horrid things. Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go. What? Where is that boy? Good idea! Separate and look for clues. Look, my dear! Look what I found! It's a stick. Now, what did you find? Yes. Yes, I see. Time travel residue next to DNA from Wilbur Robinson. That plus my stick must mean... To the future! Shotgun! I don't even know what I'm doing. Keep moving forward. I mean, this stuff is way too advanced for me. Keep moving forward. And what if I can't fix this? What are we gonna do? Keep moving forward. Why do you keep saying that? And don't just say, ""Keep moving forward."" It's my dad's motto. Why would his motto be ""keep moving forward""? It's what he does. What's that supposed to mean? That is an excellent question. Robinson Industries, the world's leading scientificresearchanddesign factory. My dad runs the company. They mass produce his inventions. His motto, ""Keep moving forward."" It's what he does. What has he invented? Everything. Carl, the time machine, the travel tubes. Your dad invented the time machine? Yep. Five years ago, Dad wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. He wants to build a time machine, so he starts working. We're talking plans. We're talking scale models. We're talking prototypes. That's a prototype? The very first, or what's left of it. Yikes. Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house. Prototypes two and three, not much better. Number six, 58, and they all end the same way. But he doesn't give up. Dude, I can't take you seriously in that hat. He keeps working and working until finally he gets it, the first working time machine. Then he keeps working and working until finally he gets it again, the second working time machine. Kind of small. I'm assuming that's a joke. I'm ignoring you for time reasons. This, my friend, is merely a model because, unfortunately, time machine number two is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy. Pretty amazing story, huh? Yeah. Now, are you ready to start working? I think that's it. I did it! I knew you could. Nice work, my friend. Well, you know what they say! ""Keep moving..."" Don't say it! Boys! Dinner time! Not now, Mom! If you aren't up here in five minutes, I'm gonna come down and get you! We'd better get up there. Let's get that boy! Sit here? But I want to look, too. A miniDoris! I didn't even know you could do that. It's so cute. Let's take her out for a spin. Sorry. Teamwork. Sorry. Sorry! There you are. Now, to lure him out of the house. I know! I'll blow it up! Yes! Yes, and... No. No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead. Oh! I know! I'll turn him into a duck! Yes! Yes, it's so evil! I don't know how to do that. I don't really need a duck. This may be harder than I thought. Hey, ring my doorbell. No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell. That doorbell will give you a rash. Yes! I'm two for two, man. If they don't do it on purpose, it doesn't count. Come on. Read your rule book. You know what? You can take your rule book and shove it right... I don't believe in fretting or grieving Why mess around with strife? Guess I was cut out To step out and strut out Give me the simple life Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served. Dinner is served. Dinner is served. Hooray! Italian food. I want a sloppy joe! Oh, Billie, could you please pass the gravy? Coming to you, big girl. Reminds me of the time my meatball pizza staved off civil war on the black moon of Keward. Where's my sloppy joe? Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie. We gotta talk. How about some gravy? Over here. Why is the kid still here? Any of this ring a bell? Science fair, Memory Scanner, a time stream that needs fixing? Temporary setback. He's just having a little confidence issue. You want me to talk to him? No. I give a mean back rub. No. Shiatsu? No. Feng shui. No. I've got it under control. So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class? No. Yes. Yes. No. Well, yes and no. Lewis is a new transfer student. Yeah. Where are you from, Lewis? Canada? I think you mean North Montana. Hasn't been called Canada in years. Do you know Sam Gundersen? It's a big country. State. I wonder if you're related. Maybe if he took his hat off. Oh, good idea. Then we can see if he has the family cowlick. He can't, because he's got bad hathair. Oh, nonsense. A North Montana man doesn't care about hathair. Let's see the cowlick! All right, everyone, hold your horses. Lewis, do you mind? I'm afraid this isn't gonna stop otherwise. But... But... And so it begins. Now, don't be shy. We're all family here. Ready, aim, fire! Surely, that is not the best you can do. Impressive, little sister. Your skills are strong, but not strong enough. Your words do not threaten me, brother. Then enough words. Now the real battle begins. Your meatballs are useless against me. Then perhaps it's time for spicy Italian sausage! No! That's right. I did it. Is dinner like this every night? No, yesterday, we had meatloaf. Okay, gang, time for the second course. And what goes better with meatballs than P.B. and J? Hey, that's just like... Stupid... Carl? Is everything all right? We're just experiencing bugs. Just what the doctor ordered. My friend Lewis is an inventor. He can fix it. Wilbur, you know I can't. Come on. Give it a try. You don't understand what's at stake here. Uncle Joe's seen the toast! We're past the point of no return! If he doesn't get P.B. and J... We all pay! I don't know. You would really be helping us out, Lewis. Please. One dragonfly on the rocks, please, Mr Barkeep. Hey, hey, Frankie, baby, you gotta tell us one of your jokes. Yeah, Frankie. How about that one with the bullfrog? All right, you bozos. Have to get that boy out of the house. Sorry. Wait! So I turn to the bullfrog, and you know what I says? Talking frogs with their own little outdoor bar, and so smartly dressed! Perfect! I says, ""Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."" Frankie, you're a riot. I gotta go pee! I love it. You bunch of goons. That's a good buzz. What the... Yes! You are now under my control. I am now under your control. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. Don't repeat everything I say. I won't repeat everything you say. Excellent. Excellent. Did you just say, ""Excellent,"" because I said, ""Excellent""? No. Excellent. Excellent. So, Mr Fixit, how's it looking? Pretty good, Mrs Robinson. I've recalibrated the dispensing conduits and aligned the ejection mechanism and... There he is, that repulsive, halfwitted fool! Now, my slave, seize the boy. Bring him to me. Did you not hear what I said, you idiot? Grab the boy and bring him! Well, it's just that there's a million people over there, and I have little arms. I'm just not so sure how well this plan was thought through. Master? Master? Okay, that should do it. It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis! Quickly. Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer. Everybody ready? Go, Carl. Yeah! Is it gonna work? Oh, no! No! I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You failed! And it was awesome! Exceptional! Outstanding! I've seen better. From failing, you learn. From success, not so much. If I gave up every time I failed, I never would have made the meatball cannon. I never would have made my fireproof pants. Still working out the kinks. Like my husband always says... Keep moving Keep moving Stop Okay, talking frog, not a good minion. Need another henchman, something large, not too bright. Something that won't talk back. What is he still doing here? Get rid of him. Oh, my noggin. Hey, what are you doing? Get your lousy mitts off of me! You're gonna regret this! Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it! I wonder if I should tell Doris. No, I'll make it a surprise. All right, everyone, quiet down. Quiet down. I propose a toast to Lewis and his brilliant failure. May it lead to success in the future. Gosh, you're all so nice. If I had a family, I... I'd want them to be just like you. Oh, well, then, to Lewis! To Lewis! To Lewis! Yeah! Come on, Lewis! Good show, buddy! What if Louis Armstrong said, ""I can't""? You think he'd have walked on the moon? Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer. What did he mean, if he had a family? Oh, Lewis is an orphan. Orphan? Oh, no! Big boy! Get up, you pansy! What a great plan! Go back in time and steal a dinosaur. Oh, Doris will be so proud of me. Why didn't you tell me you had a pet dinosaur? Because we don't. What are you talking about? He's standing right here. Oh, no! No, you can't eat him! I need him alive. Choochew on this! Lewis! Ready, aim, fire! Got you! You messed with the wrong family! Dingdong! Pizza's here! No! Okay, everybody, this dino's deepdished. Run! Oh! He ate Carl! Help us! Help! Help! Oh, goodness! Oh, no. Incoming! Run! Now, go get that boy! What's going on? Why aren't you seizing the boy? I have a big head... ...and little arms. I'm just not sure... ...how well this plan was thought through. Master? Stupid, stupid, stupid! Bowler Hat Guy! Him you can eat. Lewis, run! Wilbur! No! Oh, no! Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes. Nice catch. Nice meatball shooting! Guess we made a pretty good team, huh? Yeah, guess we did. Are you boys all right? We're good, Mom. Yeah, didn't you see us take out that dinosaur? Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom! Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't... Oh, Lewis, it's okay. I'm really happy you're safe. Your head. What? It's just a bruise, Lewis. You all sacrificed so much for me. Well, of course. You are a special kid. One of a kind. Okay, you should get him out of here before something really bad happens. Silly, silly robot. I've got it all under control. Okay, everybody, it's been a long, hard day filled with emotional turmoil and dinosaur fights, so why don't you all hit the hay, and Lewis and me will get going? Do you have to go now? I mean, you know, it's getting late. Maybe Lewis could spend the night. Mom, maybe some other time, okay? Well, any time you want to come over, you just come over. Mom. The truth is, we love having you. We really have to go. No. No, you don't. You have to stay. I mean, who would be a better family for you than us? What do you say, Lewis? Do you want to be a Robinson? You want to adopt me? Yeah! Yes! Okay, it's true. I'm from the past. Now you know the big secret. Wilbur, what have you done? How could you bring him here? That is an excellent question. Please, don't get mad at Wilbur. He was just being a good friend. Lewis, I am so sorry, but you have to go. What? You just said... I know what I said. I'm from the past. So what? Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're... You're a great kid, and we would never do anything to hurt you, but I'm sorry. You have to go back to your own time. Yeah, about that, one of the time machines is broken, and the other one was stolen by a guy with a bowler hat, which kind of explains the dino. I'm calling your father. Wait. If I have to leave, can I at least go back and find my mom? Wilbur promised. You promised what? I was never gonna do it. I swear! You lied to me? No! Yes. Lewis! Lewis, wait! I can't believe I was dumb enough to actually believe you were my friend! I am your friend! Mister, you're grounded till you die. Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame. All he wants to do is go back in time to meet the mother he never knew, but they won't let him. We'd let him, though. Too bad we don't have a time machine. Oh, wait. We do. Bowler Hat Guy? Hello, Lewis. What do you want? To make your dream come true. All you have to do is put Humpty Dumpty back together again, and we'll take you back to find your mommy. Lewis! Let's just talk about this, Lewis. Come on! I know you're around here somewhere. Lewis! I can't imagine why you're so interested in this piece of junk. That's for me to know and you to find out. Now, show me how to work this thing. It doesn't work. Never did. Well, supposing it did, and if one were presenting the invention to, say, a board of directors for a very large invention company, where might one find the ""On"" switch? Hypothetically speaking, of course. All right, first, you turn this knob twice, then push this red button, and that's it. It's pretty easy. What a stupid way to turn it on! Okay, take me to see my mom now. Yes, of course. Doris? We had a deal! Crossies! Doesn't count. Why are you doing this to me? I never did anything to you. You still haven't figured it out? Figured out what? Well, let's see if this rings a bell. Father of the Future, inventor extraordinaire, ""Keep moving forward""? That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad. Are you saying that I'm Wilbur's dad? Give the boy a prize. You grew up to be the founder of this wretched time, so I plan to destroy your destiny. Easy peasy, rice and cheesy. Well... So if I'm Wilbur's dad... Keep going. If I'm Wilbur's dad... Yes, thank you, we've established that. But what does that have to do with you? Allow me to shed some light on the subject. My old room! I think you mean our old room. What? Yes! Yes, it is I, Mike Yagoobian! I know. I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it. How did you end up like this? Well, it's a long and pitiful story about a young boy with a dream, a dream of winning a Little League championship, a dream that was ruined in the last inning. We lost by one run because of me. Get him! If I hadn't fallen asleep, I would have caught the ball! And we would have won! Do you understand? For some reason, no one wanted to adopt me. Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson graduates from college at age 14. This year's Nobel Prize goes to a young Cornelius Robinson. Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder. Hey, Goob, wanna come over to my house today? They all hated me. Eventually, they closed down the orphanage and everyone left, except me. Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco. Robinson reaches out to... It's new name, Robinson Industries. Cornelius Robinson! Cornelius Robinson is now... Now here's another amazing... It was then that I realised it wasn't my fault. It was yours. If you hadn't kept me up all night working on your stupid project, then I wouldn't have missed the catch, so I devised a brilliant plan to get my revenge. Robinson, you stink! Then, just as I was on the brink of destroying Robinson Industries, I met her. We retreated to our villainous lair, where Doris spun a tale of deception and woe. Apparently, you invented her to be a Helping Hat, a slave to humankind, but Doris knew she was capable of so much more. However, you didn't see her true potential. Got it. So you shut her down, or so you thought. We both had a score to settle with you, and while my plan for revenge was brilliant, Doris' was... Well, we went with Doris', but I made a very, very important contribution. Together we made the perfect team. Wilbur! Make sure you shut that door tight, or else the alarm won't engage. Yeah, Mom. I went to your house, snuck in the garage and stole the time machine, all thanks to that pointyhaired little kid who forgot to lock the garage door. And now all that's left is to return to Inventco, where I'll pass off your little gizmo as my own. But you have no idea what that could do to this future! I don't care. I just want to ruin your life. Goob, I had no idea. Shut up! And don't call me Goob! How many evil villains do you know who can pull off a name like Goob? Look, I'm sorry your life turned out so bad, but don't blame me. You messed it up yourself. You just focused on the bad stuff when all you had to do was let go of the past and keep moving forward. Let's see. Take responsibility for my own life or blame you. ""Blame you"" wins hands down! This is gonna be the best day of my life! Doris, would you be a dear and open the hatch for me, please? No! Well, I hate to foil your evil plan and run, but tata! But... I bet you're glad to see me. That's for not locking the garage door. You know about that? I know everything. You gotta admit, this will be a great story to tell me someday. Look at that, boys. We're almost home free. Oh, no! Take a good look around, boys, because your future is about to change. Lewis, you have to fix the time machine. No. No, I can't. What about your dad? You could call him. You are my dad. But that's in the future. There won't be a future unless you fix the time machine. Look, I messed up. I left the garage unlocked, and I've tried like crazy to fix things, but now it's up to you. You can do it, Dad. Lewis? Lewis! Wilbur? Wilbur! Wilbur. Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty? Prepare to be amazed. I call it the Memory Scanner. So, Yagoobian, any other ideas you'd like to share with us? Yes. I call them Helping Hats. They're everywhere! Doris, what's happening? I don't understand. I just wanted to ruin his future, not this. No! No. No, this can't be happening! No! Oh, Lewis, it's already happened. Why did I ever invent that stupid hat? Take a good look around, Doris, 'cause your future's about to change. Goob, stop! You don't know what you're doing! Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future. She's using you, Goob, and when she gets what she wants, she'll get rid of you. What? What? I am never going to invent you. Come on, Goob. I've got to show you something. Doris? I thought she was my friend. You did it, Lewis. You did it! I'll hold him while you run for help. Let him go. What are you doing? He's the bad guy. No, he's not. He's my roommate. What? He's my old roommate, and I really think you guys should adopt him. Are you nuts? Give me one good reason why not. I'll give you three good reasons. He stole our time machine, tried to ruin your future, and he smells like he hasn't showered in 30 years! May I remind you, I'm your father, and you have to do what I say. Okay, Mr Yagoobian, do you want to be a... Where'd he go? Goob? Goob! Goob. Are you hurt? Any broken bones? No, I'm... Do you have a temperature? Brain fog? Scurvy? Tapeworm? Cellulite? No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine. In fact, better than I've felt in a long time. Franny, they're gone. Oh, this is terrible! Oh, boy. Well, he's home early. Franny, where are you? The time machines are gone! Ratted out by the old lady. Harsh. Okay. Yeah, beats working in an office every day. Yeah, no kidding. Hey! Want to see the one I'm most proud of? Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. That one. It was our first real invention. It's the one that started it all. Wowie. So if I go back now, then this will be my future. Well, that depends on you. Nothing is set in stone. You gotta make the right choices and keep moving forward. Since it's gonna work this time, that means I... We won't finally get to see what Mom looks like? Do we ever meet her? I think you're just gonna have to get back to that science fair and find out for yourself. I had a feeling you were gonna say that. That's because we are one smart kid. So long! Byebye, Lewis! Farewell, future brotherinlaw. So long! See you later, Lewis! Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes! Have a safe trip, little Lewis. I will. Hey, while I got you here, just a couple of little suggestions regarding my design. Let's face it, these skinny limbs don't exactly make the teapot whistle. All that really matters is, hey, don't forget to invent me. Are you kidding? No way! I love you. There's so many things I wish I could ask you. Excuse me. Time travel now, questions later. But I... Don't worry. Just get back to that science fair, and we'll see you real soon. Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye. Goodbye, son. Thanks again for everything! Wait. Lewis, one more thing. Yeah? Just a little tip for the future. I am always right. Even when I'm wrong, I'm right. She's right. I'd just go with it if I were you. And I am. Then you're absolutely right. All right, I'm coming. Well, it's not like you're never gonna see them again. They are your family, after all. Wait a minute. You're supposed to take me back to the science fair. I know. Well, I think you punched in the wrong numbers. We agreed that, if you fixed the time machine, I'd take you back to see your mom. What? A deal's a deal. I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go? Because I already have a family. I never thought my dad would be my best friend. Now, now, don't make me come and bail you out again. I won't. Remember, I've got a time machine. If you mess up again, I'll just keep coming back till you get it right. You got that motto? I got it. Don't forget it. I don't think that's possible. You better get going. See you later, Wilbur. Wait a minute! Goob! Goob, wake up! What? That's it! Mr Willerstein, I know what went wrong. Can I have one more chance? Please! My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up. I need a volunteer. Now, just give me a date to input. Well, now, let's see. There's my first science fair, the day I got my first microscope, the time I swam the English Channel, my first gold medal for the luge. I know. Perfect! You look gorgeous. He's a lucky guy. Oh! It works. It works! It works. You look beautiful, Lucille. Bud? Would you look at that? Whoa! Honey! Honey, you're just in time. Lucille! You did it, Lewis! You did it! This invention is brilliant! Kid, you're this fair's MVP! That was some show you put on. You're a real special kid, but you don't look like a Lewis. You look more like a... Cornelius. I get that a lot. Oh, no! Sorry, mister. No harm done. Frankie, what have I told you about running away? Frankie? My star pupil. My name's Franny, and I teach frogs music. Really? You know that frogs have more musical ability than people? But nobody believes me. They all think I'm crazy. You think I'm crazy, too. No. No, I think you're right. Over here? There he is. Kid, we'd like to get a story on you for the local paper. You've got a bright future ahead of you. Let it go Yeah. Let it roll right off your shoulder Don't you know The hardest part is over Let it in Let your clarity define you In the end We will only just remember How it feels Let it slide Let your troubles fall behind you Let it shine Until you feel it all around you And I don't mind If it's me you need to turn to We'll get by It's the heart that really matters In the end Our lives are made In these small hours These little wonders These twists and turns of fate Time falls away But these small hours These small hours still remain All of my regret Will wash away somehow But I cannot forget The way I feel right now The future has arrived The future has arrived The future has arrived The future has arrived The future's arrived Nobody can doubt The future is what everything's about It's better for you And it's better for me It's better than what everybody Thought it would be The future has arrived The future has arrived today The future's alive Alive as can be Just open your eyes It's plain to see Just don't be afraid Just keep going on One step at a time And you can't go wrong It's time to create Time to grow If you feel right The world, yeah She's changing Don't it make you feel alive?

Oh, no problem. They're under the name Googley Bear. Oh, good ide... You know, that wasn't very funny.  What the...? Wazowski!    What do you know? It scares little kids and little monsters. I wasn't scared. I have... allergies.  Uhhuh. Sure. Hey, Randall, save it for the scare floor, will you? I'm in the zone today, Sullivan. Going to be doing some serious scaring. Putting up some big numbers. Wow, Randall. That's great. That should make it even more humiliating when we break the record first. Ha, ha! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Do you hear that? It's the winds of change. : ""You hear it? You hear the winds of ch...?"" Oh, what a creep. One of these days, I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson.   Chalooby! Baby! Good morning, Roz my succulent little garden snail. And who would we be scaring today? Wazowski, you didn't file your paperwork last night. Oh, that darn paperwork. Wouldn't it be easier if it all just blew away?  Don't let it happen again. Yes, well, I'll, uh... I'll try to be less careless. I'm watching you, Wazowskl. Always watching. Whoo! She's nuts. Always! All scare floors are now active. Assistants, please report to your stations.      Okay, people, eastern seaboard coming online. We got scarers coming out!   Ooh, they're so awesome.      Hey... may the best monster win. I plan to.  We are on in seven... six... five... four... three... two...   You're the boss. You're the boss. You're the big, hairy boss.   Oh, I'm feeling good today, Mikey! Yeah! Whoa! Attaboy. Attaboy. Another door coming right up.     You're still behind, Randall. You know, maybe I should realign the scream intake valve. Just get me another door! A door! Yes, door!          Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far? We may actually make our quota today, sir. Hmm. First time in a month.  Huh?!   What happened? The kid almost touched me! She got this close to me! She wasn't scared of you? She was only six! I could've been dead! I could've died! Keep it together, man.  Hey! We got a dead door over here! ...We're coming! ...Coming! ...Look out! ...Out of the way! ...Coming through! ...Excuse us.  We've lost 58 doors this week, sir. Oh, kids these days. They just don't get scared like they used to. Let her rip!      Uh, sir? What?! Look. Attention. Randall Boggs.     Slumber party.  Whoo!  Never mind. Hey! Watch it!  Well, James, that was an impressive display! Oh, just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose. Of course, I did learn from the best.  If I don't see a new door at my station in five seconds I will personally put you through the shredder!  Hey, Wazowski, nice job! Those numbers are pretty sweet. Are they? You know, I hadn't even noticed. And, uh... how is Georgie doing? He's doing great! I love working with that big guy.  Keep the doors coming, Charlie. I'm on a roll today. George and I are like brothers.  2319! We have a 2319!   Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! George Sanderson please remain motionless. Prepare for decontamination. Get it off! Duck and cover, people! Oh, not the CDA.  Move! Move! Move! Coming through, please. Stand aside. Clear the contaminated area.  This is a 2319 in progress. Keep the area clear. Coming through. Watch yourself.   Stand back. Careful.       All clear. Situation is ninerninerzero. Ready for decon. Hey, thanks, guys. That was a close one. Okay.      Okay, people, take a break! We got to shut down for a halfhour and reset the system. An entire scare floor out of commission. What else can go wrong? Oh... what a day. We're just going through a rough time, sir. Everyone knows you're going to get us through it. Tell that to the board of directors.  James, this company has been in my family for three generations. I would do anything to keep it from going under. Oh, so would I, sir. Well... Say, I could use your help with something. Anything, sir. You see, we've hired some new scare recruits and frankly, they're... they're, um... uh... Inexperienced? Oh, they stink! Uhhuh. And I thought maybe you might come by tomorrow and give them a demonstration. Show them what it takes to be a top scarer, huh? I'll start out with the old Waternoose jumpandgrowl.  Ha! Oh, oh, yes! Now, that's my boy!   Let's go, everybody! All doors must be returned! No exceptions! ...Oh, yeah. ...Whoo! I've never seen anything like you today. You were on a roll, my man. Another day like this and that scare record's in the bag. That's right, baby! Uhhuh. So get this... As if dinner wasn't enough I'm taking her to a monster truck rally afterwards. Nice. What's on your agenda? I'm going to head home and work out some more. Again? You know, there's more to life than scaring.   Whew. Hey, can I borrow your odorant? Yeah. I got, uh... smelly garbage or old dumpster. You got low tide? No. How about wet dog? Yep. Stink it up.  You know, I am so romantic sometimes I think I should just marry myself. Give me a break, Mike. What a night of romance I got ahead of me. Tonight is about me and Celia. Ooh, the love boat is about to set sail.  'Cause I got to tell you, buddy that face of hers, it just makes my heart go... Yikes! Hello, Wazowskl. Funfilled evening planned for tonight? Well, as a matter of fact... Then I'm sure you filed your paperwork correctly... for once. Your stunned silence is very reassuring. Oh, no. My scare reports... i left them on my desk and if I'm not at the restaurant in five minutes they're going to give our table away! What am I going to tell... Schmoopsiepoo. Hey, Googley Bear. Want to get going? Do I ever! It's just that... What? Uh, you know, there's a small... I don't understand. It's just that I forgot about some paperwork I was supposed to file. Mike was reminding me. Thanks, buddy. Whoo. I was? I mean, I was! Yeah, I was. Oh, okay. Let's go then. We're going! On my desk, Sulley. The pink copies go to Accounting the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing and goldenrod ones go to Roz. Huh! Leave the puce. Pink copies go to Accounting, the fuchsia ones go to Roz. No, fuchsia ones go to Purchasing. The goldenrod ones go to Roz. Man, I have no idea what puce is. Oh, that's puce. Hmm? Uh, hello? Anyone? There's a door here. Hmm.   : Hello? Hey. Psst. Anybody scaring in here? Hello? Yo! Hmm.      Whoa! Ah! Ah! Oh! : Here. Gotcha!   Eh!        Oh!  Yeow!      Eww.       Whew.    Kitty!  No, no... stay back.          Hmm.       And hold it.  Get a paper bag! Mmm.  Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthday... well, not a lot of birthdays but this is the best birthday ever. Hmm. What are you looking at? I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you... How pretty you looked. Stop it! Your hair was shorter then. Mmhmm. I'm thinking about getting it cut.  No, no, I like it this length.  I like everything about you. Just the other day someone asked me who I thought the most beautiful monster was in all of Monstropolis. You know what I said? What did you say? I said... ...Sulley? ...Sulley? No! No, no. That's not what I was going to say. Mike, you're not making sense. Hi, guys! What a coincidence, running into you here! Uh, I'm just going to order something to go. Michael... Sulley! I wonder what's good here. Get out of here. You're ruining everything. I went back to get your paperwork and there was a door. What?  A door?! Randall was in it. Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater! He's trying to boost his numbers! There's something else. What?! Ooklay in the agbay. What?! Look in the bag. What bag?    Oh! They don't have anything I like here. So take care, Celia! Excuse me, sir. What's going on? Celia, please try to understand. I have to do something! Michael? On three. One... two...   A kid! Boo!  A kid! There's a kid here... A human kid!  Oh! Googley Bear!   Come on!  Let's get out of here! Please remain calm. This is not a drill.   We have an 835 in progress. Please advise. Michael? Michael? Oh, Celia. ...Please come with me. ...Ow. Stop pushing. Hey, get your hands off my Schmoopsiepoo! Building clear. Ready for decontamination. Well, I don't think that date could have gone any worse.   If witnesses are to be believed there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history. We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight. Well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision! I tried to run from it, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll! It's true! I saw the whole thing! It is my professional opinion that now is the time to... panic! Ohoh.  Oh, it's coming! It's coming! : Boo!     No, no, no, no, no! Come here, kid. Whee. No, don't touch those, you little...! Oh, now those were alphabetized. It's okay, it's all right. As long as it doesn't come near us we're going to be okay.     Wanna ride on it! Da, dada. Dadada. Oh, yyou like this? Fetch!   Hey, hey, that's it! No one touches little Mikey!  Mike, give her the bear. Oh, no.       Make it stop, Sulley! Make it stop! Look! See the bear? Ooh, nice bear.  Sulley! See? Ooh, bear, ooh. Oh, he's a happy bear. He's not crying, neither should you  Or we'll be in trouble  'Cause they're gonna find us  So please stop crying  Right now.  Good, good, Sulley. Keep it up. You're doing great. Ooh, the happy bear, he has no...   She touched me! Sulley, the bear! The bear! Give her the... Whoa!       What was that?  I have no idea but it would be really great if it didn't do it again.  Shh, shh, shh. Shh... shh. Shh... Ah! How could I do this? How could I be so stupid? This could destroy the company. The company? Who cares about the company?! What about us? That thing is a killing machine! Lalalalalala  I bet it's just waiting for us to fall asleep and then wham! Oh, we're easy prey, my friend... easy prey. We're sitting targets. Okay, look, I think I have a plan here. Using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild. Spoons. That's it, I'm out of ideas. We're closed. Hot air balloon? Too expensive. Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous. Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek!  No plan. No plan. Can't think. Can't think. Flatlining. Uh, Mike? I think she's getting tired. Well, then why don't you find someplace for it to sleep? While I think of a plan! Are you sleepy? You want to sleep? Is that what you want? Huh?  Okay, all right. I'm making a nice little area for you to...  No. Hey, hey, that's my bed! You're going to get your germs all over it. : Fine. My chair is more comfortable anyway.  What?  it's just a closet. Will you go to sleep? Hey, that looks like Randall. Randall's your monster. You think he's going to come through the closet and scare you. Oh, boy, how do I explain this? Uh, it's empty. ...See? ...Ah! No monster in here. Well, now there is but I'm not going to scare you. I'm offduty. Okay. How about I sit here, until you fall asleep? Go ahead. Go to sleep. Now. Now... go. Uh, you... go... to... sleep.     Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy but I don't think that kid's dangerous. Really? Well, in that case, let's keep it. I always wanted a pet that could kill me! Now, look. What if we just put her back in her door? What? Mike, think about it. If we send her back, it's like it never happened. Everything goes back to normal. Is that a joke? Tell me you're joking. Sulley, I'd like to think that, given the circumstances I have been extremely forgiving up to now but that is a horrible idea! What are we going to do? March right out into public with that thing? Then I guess we just waltz right up to the factory, right? I can't believe we are waltzing right up to the factory. Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights and some chair fabric are not going to fool anyone! Just think about a few names, will you? Loch Ness, Bigfoot, the Abominable Snowman... They all got one thing in common, pal... banishment. We could be next! Don't panic... We can do this. Hey, how you doing, Frank? Hey, guys. Everything's going to be okay.   Number One wants this place dusted for prints. Careful with that. I got a good view from here. A little lower. This was recovered at the scene. Don't panic. Don't panic! Don't tell me not to panic. Just keep it together. Everything is not okay! Boo. ...could be contaminated. Gentlemen, safety is our number one concern. If there's anything that... not now, not now. Oh, hello, little one. Where did you come from? Mr. Waternoose! Ah, James! Is this one yours? Actually, that's my, uh, cousin's sister's daughter, sir. Yeah, it's, uh... ""Bring an Obscure Relative to Work Day."" Hmm, must have missed the memo. Well, listen, James why don't you stop by the simulator after lunch today and give us that scare demonstration we talked about, huh? Oh, oh, sir, uh... Excuse me, Mr. Waternoose? Yes, yes, I'm coming. All right then, I'll see you this afternoon, James. That is, if these gentlemen haven't shut us down. Oh, boy. Oh, a scare demo. Well, that is great. Why am I the last to know? We can bring your cousin's sister's daughter along. She'II be a big hit!  Halt!  Stop him! Hold him down. Come on, the coast is clear. Okay, all we have to do is get rid of that thing. So, wait here while I get its card key. But she can't stay here. This is the men's room. That is the weirdest thing you have ever said. It's fine. It's okay. Look, it loves it here! It's dancing with joy! Uh, uh, uh, uh. I'll be right back with its door key.  That's a cute little dance you've got. It almost looks like you've got to...  Oh.   Uh, are you done in there?  Ah! Sorry. Sorry.   Okay, you finished now, right? Hello?  Boo.     Where did she go? Oh, did she disappear? Did she turn invisible?  I just have no idea. Gotcha! Boo.  Hey, you're good.  Be relaxed, be relaxed, be relaxed. Roz, my tender, oozing blossom you're looking fabulous today. Is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me. It's a new haircut, isn't it? That's got to be a new haircut. New makeup? You've had a lift. You've had a tuck. You've had something. Something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like...  Listen, I need a favor. Randall was working late last night out on the scare floor. I really need the key for the door he was using. Well, isn't that nice? But guess what? You didn't turn in your paperwork last night. He didn't... I... no paperwork? This office is now closed.  Ready or not, here I come! I'm getting warmer. Any second now. Fee fi fo... What are you doing?! II'm looking for the kid. You lost it?! No, no, she was just...  Here she is.  Hey, what's the matter? I already told your buddies I haven't seen anything. All right, carry on.  Randall! Thank goodness! What are we going to do about the child? Shh! Shh, shh, shh.   The front page! It's on the front page. The child... The one you were after. Will you be quiet?! Don't you think I'm aware of the situation? I was up all night trying to find it. I did a simple calculation factoring in the size of the sushi restaurant. The child may have escaped! Yeah, well, until we know for sure we're going to act like nothing happened, understand? You just get the machine up and running. I'll take care of the kid. And when I find whoever let it out, they're dead! Oh! Why are you still here? Come on, go! Move! Now! Ow, ow! I'm not here. They're gone.  Eww. This is bad. This is so very bad. What were they talking about a machine? Who cares? Oh! Look, don't panic... All we have to do is call her door down and send her home. You're right, you're right. We're just two regular joes on our way to work. We will blend right in. Top of the mornin', fellas! Hey, what's shakin', bacon? Did you lose weight? Or a limb? You have her card key, right? Of course I have her card key. I told you I'd get her card key. I went and got her card key and now I have her card key. Okay, here we go. Take care of yourself. Try not to run through any more closets.  Mike, that's not her door. What are you talking about? Of course it's her door. It's her door. No, her door was white and it had flowers on it. No. It must have been dark last night because this is its door.  Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun in there! Okay, send me a postcard, kid. That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 MikeWazowski yougotyourlifeback lane. Mowki Kowskl. Very good. Now bon voyage! Byebye! Come on. Look at the stick. See the stick? Go get the stick! Go fetch. Mike, this isn't Boo's door. Boo? What's Boo? That's what I decided to call her. Is there a problem? Sulley, you're not supposed to name it. Once you name it, you start getting attached to it! Now put that thing back where it came from, or so help me... Oh, hey! We're rehearsing a scene for the upcoming company play called Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me%  It's a musical! Put that thing back where it came from or so help me  Bombom, bombom, bombom...  So help me, so help me.  And cut! We're still working on it. It's a work in progress but, hey, we need ushers. Sulley, I've had enough. Now say goodbye to... where'd it go? What'd you do with it? : Where is she? I don't believe it. She got away from you again?! Well, that is just... Wait a minute. The sun is coming up. This is perfect! She's gone! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? Sulley, please, don't blow this. Not when we're so close to breaking the record. Somebody else will find the kid. It'll be their problem, not ours! She's out of our hair! What are you two doing? They're rehearsing a play. She's out of our hair!  Can it, Wazowski! So, what do you think of that kid getting out, Sullivan? Pretty crazy, huh? Oh, yeah, crazy. Word on the street is the kid's been traced back to this factory. You haven't seen anything, have you? Uh, well, uh... No, no way! But if it was an inside job I'd put my money on Waxford. Waxford? Yeah, the one at station six. You know, he's got them shifty eyes. Hey, Waxford! Sulley! Michael Wazowski!  last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none!  I thought you cared about me. Honey, please. Schmoopsie, I thought you liked sushl. Sushi? Sushi?!! You think this is about sushi?! Wazowski! Michael! Mike... Men.  Breathe. Keep breathing. Whew. Yikes! Where's the kid? Kid? What kid? It's here in the factory, isn't it? You're not pinning this on me. It never would have gotten out if you hadn't been cheating last night! Cheating? Cheating. Right. Okay, I think I know how to make this all go away. What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes? Uh... I get a timeout? Everyone goes to lunch! Which means the scare floor will be...? Painted? Empty! It'll be empty, you idiot! You see that clock? When the big hand is pointing up and the little hand is pointing up the kid's door will be in my station. But when the big hand points down the door will be gone. You have until then to put the kid back. Get the picture?  Boo!  No. Hey, you! Halt! He's the one. The one from the commercial! Affirmative. That's him. Can we get an autograph? Oh, oh, sure. No problem. You can make that out to Bethany, my daughter. Yes. Let's see... ""From your scary friend best wishes..."" So I said, ""If you talk to me like that again, we're through!"" What'd she say? You know my mom. She sent me to my room. See you guys later, take it easy. Bottoms up!  No!  Whoa! Hey.  Oh, well, hello, there. What's your name? Mike Wazowski!     Sulley! Oh, Sulley. Okay, Sulley, come on, enough. Hey, you guys seen Sulley anywhere? Nope. Sorry. Oh, Sulley! Boy, Wazowski looks like he's in trouble.  We have a 2319! Oh, dear. Get him! Sulley? Sulley!  Sulley! Oh, great news, pal. I got us a way out of this mess but we got to hurry. Where is it?  Sull, that's a cube of garbage.  Uhoh. II can still hear her little voice. Mike Wazowski! Hey, I can hear her, too. Mike Wazowski! How many kids you got in there? Mike Wazowski! Kitty! Boo! Boo, oh, you're all right! I was so worried! Don't you ever run away from me again, young lady! Oh, but I'm so glad you're safe. My, what an affectionate father. Actually, she's my cousin's sister's... Okay, Sulley. That's enough. Let's go. Mike Wazowski! Yeah, yeah. Step aside, kid. We're in a...        Will you stop making Boo laugh? I didn't, so come on!   I still don't understand. You've got Boo's door? I'll explain later. Run. Okay, let's move, let's move, let's move. Come on. Oh, please be there, please be there, please be there. There it is! Just like Randall said! Randall? What a minute.  Oh, hey. One, two, three, four! Get the kid back through the door! Hey, hey. We're going to get our lives back. The nightmare is over. Hey, it's okay, Boo. What's the matter? Come on, it's time to move! Mike, what are you thinking? We can't trust Randall. He's after Boo. Who cares? Let's go. This is a limited time offer. No, no. I don't like this. Look, Sulley, you wanted her door and there it is. Now, let's move. No, Mike. : You want me to prove everything's on the upandup? Fine! He wants the door, I get the door... : Mike, wait! He's a paranoid delusional furball. Mike!   Shh, shh, shh.   Hey, Sulley, where you been all day? Sulley? Sulley? Huh? : Mike? Mike? Where are you? You in there? Where are you, buddy? Mike? Hey.   Boo, way to go.  It's okay.    Yes! I got the kid! Oh, huzzah! That's great news. Not that I was concerned, of course. Just get over here and help me! Come on, come on, come on. While we're young here, Fungus!  Kid needs to take off a few pounds.  Wazowski?! Where is it, you little oneeyed cretin? Okay, first of all, it's creetin. If you're going to threaten me do it properly. Second of all, you're nuts if you think kidnapping me is going to help you cheat your way to the top!  You still think this is about that stupid scare record? Well... I did, right up until you chuckled like that and now I'm thinking I should just get out of here. I am about to revolutionize the scaring industry and when I do, even the great James P. Sullivan is going to be working for me. Well somebody's certainly been a busy bee. First, I need to know where the kid is and you're going to tell me. Yeah, I don't know anything. Uhhuh, sure. I don't. I mean, I don't. Ohoh.   What's that? Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Ohoh. Ohoh. Oh, come on. No, no, no, no, no. Come on, hey, hey, hey. This thing is moving. I don't like big... moving things that are moving towards me. No! Come on! Hey, Randall! Say hello to the scream extractor. Hello. Come on, where you going? We'll talk. Come on, we'll have a latte! Come on. We can talk about this.   What's that thing? What is that thing? Wait, wait, wait! Stop, stop! No, no! Come on, hey!  Help! Help! Help! Help!   Oh, for... What did you do wrong this time? I don't know. I calibrated the drive... Go check the machine! There must be something wrong with the scream intake valve. That's the problem with these 3250 units... Huh? Hmm. Psst! Fungus. Fungus. You like cars, huh? 'Cause I got a really nice car. If you let me go, I'll give you... a ride in the car. Please, Fungus? I'm sorry, Wazowski, but Randall said I'm not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot.   Hmm...       What happened? Where's Wazowski?    Where is he?!     Come on! This is crazy. He's going to kill us! Careful. That could be contaminated. We got to get out of here now! We can start a whole new life somewhere far away. Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.! Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose! No, Mike, wait! Hey, what are you doing? Follow me. I have an idea. No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... Simulation terminated. No, no, no, no, no. What was that? You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep. I was going for a snake ninja approach with a little hissing.  How many times do I have to tell you? It's all about presence! About how you enter the room! Mr. Waternoose! James! Perfect timing. No, no. Sir, you don't understand. Ah, now, show these monsters how it's done. What? No, no, I can't... Sir... sir, you have to listen to me. Pay attention, everyone. You're about to see the best in the business. Reset the simulator. Butbut, sir! Good night, sweetheart. Night, Mom. Kitty! No, Boo, no, no! Now, give us a big, loud roar. Mr. Waternoose, there's no time for this. Come on. What are you waiting for? Roar! Butbutbut, sir! Roar!         Well done. Well done, James. Boo? ...All right, gentlemen, I hope you've learned... Right this way, everyone. ...a valuable lesson in scaring today.   Boo.   Boo?   Boo, it's me.  : The child! Sir, she isn't toxic. I know it sounds crazy, but trust me. Boo? No, no, no, no. It's okay. I was just...  No, no, no, no, no, don't be scared. That wasn't real. It's just a... I was just... : No...   Boo. ...and he was going to test it out on that sweet, little girl. ...Boo. ...Now that we have her... ...he is trying to kill us. This whole thing is Randall's fault. Randall? Yes. And we can take you to his secret lab, which is right here in this factory. How could this happen? Oh, how could this happen? Does anyone else know about this? No, sir. Good. This company can't afford any more bad publicity. Now, before we do anything else, let's... take care of the child. Oh, I never thought things would come to this... not in my factory. I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this. Especially you, James. But now we can set everything straight again for the good of the company.   Uh... sir, that's not her door. I know, I know. It's yours.    No!  : Boo!  No! No! No! No! No! No! No!  It's too late! We're banished, genius. We're in the human world! Oh, what a great idea, going to your old pal Waternoose! Too bad he was in on the whole thing! All you had to do was listen to me... just once! But you didn't, did you? You're still not listening!   Take that!   Welcome to the Himalayas!  ""Abominable""!  Can you believe that? Do I look abominable to you? Why can't they call me the Adorable Snowman or... or the Agreeable Snowman, for crying out loud? I'm a nice guy. Snow cone? Yuck. No, no, no. Don't worry... It's lemon. Uh, how about you, big fella? Snow cone? Did you see the way she... looked at me?  Ah, poor guy. I understand. It ain't easy being banished. Take my buddy, Bigfoot. When he was banished he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy. Wore it on his head like a tiara. Called himself King Itchy. Ah, it won't be so hard for you guys, though, you know. I mean, how lucky can you get? Banished with your best friend. He is not my friend. Oh. I just assumed you were buddies, you know when I saw you out there in the snow hugging and all that. Look at that big jerk. Ruined my life, and for what? A stupid kid! Because of you, I am now stuck in this frozen wasteland! Wasteland? I think you mean wonderland! I mean, how about all this fabulous snow, huh? Oh, and wait till you see the local village. Cutest thing in the world. I haven't even mentioned all the free yak's milk. What... what did you say? Yak's milk. Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic. You know, once you pick the hairs out it's very nutritious. No, no. Something about a village. Where? Are there kids in it? Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids, kids who climb on rocks... Where is it?! It's at the bottom of the mountain. Around a threeday hike. Oh, three days?! We need to get there now!   You want to go to the village? Okay, rule number one out here. Always... No. Never go out in a blizzard. We need to get to Boo.  Boo?! What about us?  Ever since that kid came in you've ignored everything I've said and now look where we are! Oh, we were about to break the record, Sulley. We would have had it made! None of that matters now. None of it matter... Wawait a second. None of it matters?  Okay. That's... no. Good. Great. So, now the truth comes out, doesn't it? Oh, would you look at that? We're out of snow cones, uh... Let me... just go outside and make some more. Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for? Does that matter? Huh? And what about Celia? I am never... never going to see her again. Doesn't that matter?  What about me? I'm your pal. I'm... I'm your best friend. Don't I matter?  I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry we're stuck out here. I didn't mean for this to happen. But Boo's in trouble. I think there might be a way to save her if we can just get down to that... ""We""? Whoa, whoa, whoa. ""We""? No. There's no ""we"" this time, pal. Iifif you want to go out there and freeze to death you be my guest... because you're on your own.  Hey, I got more snow cones! Ohh! Ahh! Ahh!      Oh, come on, now, George. I know you can do this. I picked out an easy door for you... in Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal. You know, you're right. Here, take this. Go get 'em, Georgie! Gangway! Look out! Coming through! Sorry, George. Hey, you can't just...    Out of the way! ...Hey! ...Whoa! Don't!   Finally! I never should have trusted you with this. Because of you, I had to banish my top scarer! With this machine, we won't need scarers. Besides, Sullivan got what he deserved. Sullivan was twice the scarer you will ever be!        Kitty!     Kitty! Sullivan?  Whwhoa! Kitty! Sorry, Boo. Stop him!  Let's get you home.   Ooh! Finish him off! Oh! Ooh! Oh!   You don't know how long I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.    Hah! Ooh!   Ooh! Mike?! Look, it's not that I don't care about the kid. Mike, you don't understand. Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all. I needed some time to think. But you shouldn't have left me out there.  I'm being attacked! No, I'm not attacking you. I'm trying to be honest. Just hear me out. You and I are a team. Nothing is more important than our friendship. III know, kid. He's too sensitive.   Come on, pal. If you start crying, I'm going to cry and I'll never get through this. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you but I am now. Ow! Sulley, I am baring my soul here. The least you could do is pay attention!   Hey, look at that... It's Randall! It's... Oh. Come on! Get up! There can't be any witnesses. There won't be. I'm glad you came back, Mike. Somebody's got take care of you, you big hairball.   Ow! Schmoopsiepoo, I really can't talk. Come on! Michael, if you don't tell me what's going on right now, we are through! You hear me? Through! Here's the truth. You know the kid that they're looking for... Sulley let her in. We tried to send her back but Waternoose had this secret plot and now Randall's right behind us and he's trying to kill us! You expect me to believe that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?! Mike Wazowski!  I love you, Schmoopsiepoo! Move it! Look out, you... Oh! ...idiot!   Look out. Coming through, here, coming through! Make way. Move it! Hurry up, hurry up. There they are! Attention, Randall Boggs has just broken the alltime scare record. Huh? No, I didn't. Get out of my way!  Go get 'em, Googley Bear!  There it is! Get off my tail! Let me through! Sulley, what are you doing? Grab on, Mike! Are you out of your...?    Sulley, what are we doing? We have to get Boo's door and find a station. What a plan... simple, yet insane!  Whoa. ...  ...Oh, boy. Hold on!    Wow! Don't look down!      I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick! Whoa!  Oh, no!  No! Aah... Boo's door? There it is! How are we supposed to get to it now? Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley!  There he is. Make her laugh. What, Sulley?! Just do it! Oh... ow!    Get it open. Here he comes. Give me that kid!   Why couldn't we get banished here? Come on. We got to find another door.  Look, Boo's door!  There he is! Hurry up, hurry up! Give me your hand.   Come on, it slides, it slides! Ooh, right, right, right.   Jump! I'm behind you! Come on! Hurry up! Keep moving! Get inside! Ooh! That was weird.  Mike? Oh, sorry, buddy.    Oh! I hope that hurt, lizard boy!  Great job, buddy. We lost him.  Boo! Ha, ha! No!  Nice working with you! Get it open! ...I'm trying! ...Open the door! Come on, get in here!   Boo!  There they are! Sulley, what are you doing? Sulley!    Looks like we caught the express, pal. Do you see them? Straight ahead! No...   Kitty! Boo!   Look at everybody's favorite scarer now! You stupid, pathetic waste!  You've been number one for too long, Sullivan. Now your time is up! And don't worry. I'll take good care of the kid. No!       She's not scared of you anymore.  Looks like you're out of a job.  All right, come on, over the plate. Let's see the ol' stuff here, pal. Come on, now, chuck him, chuck him, baby. Hum, baby. Hum, baby, here's the pitch. Wait, please, don't, don't, don't! No! And he is... out of here!  Mama, another gator got in the house. Another gator?! Give me that shovel! Come here!  Get him, mama! Get that gator! Care to do the honors, Mikey? With pleasure.   That's right, Boo. You did it. You beat him.  Come on. Okay, Boo, it's time to go home. Take care of yourself, and be a good girl, okay?  Oh, no! The power's out! Make her laugh again. All right, I got a move here. It'll bring down the house. Up...   Oh, sorry, she didn't see that. What?! What'd you do, forget to check if her stupid hood was up ya big dope?! : Uncle Mike, try not to yell in front of her. You know we still need her to laugh. Right.  Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!  Funny, right? Huh? See what the... These are the jokes, kid. Whoa! What's happening? Hold on! When the door lands in this station, cut the power. You'd have the child and the criminals responsible for this whole mess. Great. A welcoming committee! What are we going to do?!   This is the CDA. Come out slowly with the child in plain sight. Okay, okay. You got us. Here we are. Here's the kid. I'm cooperating. But before you take us away, I have one thing to say:  Catch! : We have a toxic projectile! Halt! After the suspect! Cover the area! Bring in reinforcements! Stop him!  Come on. Don't let them get away. What...?! No, wait, wait! Come back! He has the child!   Sullivan? Sullivan! Give me the child! Me not go! Give her to me!    Open this door! Open this door!  Hey! Sullivan!  Don't do it.  Come on. Don't go in that room!  I think we stopped him, Boo. You're safe now. You be a good girl, okay? This has gone far enough, James. She's home now! Just leave her alone! I can't do that! She's seen too much. You both have. It doesn't have to be this way. I have no choice! Times have changed. Scaring isn't enough anymore. But kidnapping children?! I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die and I'll silence anyone who gets in my way! No! : Good night, Mom. : Good night, sweetheart. Good night, Mom. What, whwhat is this?! What? Who? Huh? Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys but I spotted several big mistakes. Butbutbut howhow did...? How did...? You know what? Let's watch my favorite part again... shall we? : I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die. What...? Wha...? I'll kidnap a thousand children before...  Shh, shh, shh, shh! Shh! I'll get him. All right, come with us, sir. Whwhat are you doing? Take your hands off me! You can't arrest me! I hope you're happy, Sullivan! You've destroyed this company. Monsters, Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone get their scream now?! The energy crisis will only get worse because of you!  Stay where you are. Huh? Number One wants to talk to you. Attention! Hello, boys. Roz?! Two and a half years of undercover work were almost wasted when you intercepted that child, Mr. Sullivan. Of course, without your help, I never would have known that this went all the way up to Waternoose.   Now... about the girl... I just want to send her home. Very good.  Bring me a door shredder. What, you mean... you mean, I can't see her again? That's the way it has to be. I'll give you five minutes.  Well, so long, kid. Mike Wazowski! Yeah. Ah, Boo, it's been fun. Go ahead. Go grow up.    Uhuh, BBoo...?  Um... Boo?  Oh, look at that. Yeah, you know... Oh, that's cute, yeah.  Uh, Boo, um...  Well, that's very nice.  Come here, you!   Oh, he's a happy bear...    Nothing's coming out of your closet to scare you anymore, right? Mm... Yeah. Goodbye, Boo. Kitty. Kitty has to go. Boo!  Kitty?   None of this ever happened, gentlemen. And I don't want to see any paperwork on this.  Take him away.  I bet we get the rest of the day off. You idiot! They're going to shut down the factory!  I'm telling you, pal, when that wall went up you should have seen the look on Waternoose's face. Whoohoo! I hope we get a copy of that tape. Hey, you all right? Come on, pal, cheer up, we did it! We got Boo home. Ah, sure, we put the factory in the toilet, and... gee, hundreds of people will be out of work now. Not to mention the angry mob that'll come after us when there's no more power, but, hey... at least we had some laughs, right? Laughs...     Hey, is this thing on? Hello? Hello? Testing, testing. Hey, good evening. How are you? How are you? Nice to see you. I tell you, it's good to be here in... your room. Where you from? Never mind. You're in kindergarten, right? Oh, I love kindergarten. Best three years of my life. Of my life. But I love sports. Dodgeball was the best. Oh, yeah. I was the fastest one out there. Course I was the ball. But I... was the ball, see? All right.    Ah...  Ah?  Hey, thanks a lot. I'll be here all week. Remember to tip your waitresses.    Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota on the first kid of the day. Not bad, huh? You know, only somebody with perfect comedic timing could produce this much energy in one shot. Uhhuh, and the fact that laughter is ten times more powerful than scream had nothing to do with it.  Oh, Googley Bear. Come here, you. Schmoopsiepoo! Googley. Whoa!   Girls! Girls, put... Stop, stop, stop! Michael, you're such a charmer. Hey, did you bring the magazine? They just delivered a whole box. Let me see it!  Sulley and I made the cover, right? : I don't believe it. : Googley Bear... I'm on the cover of a magazine! Ow!   Oh, this is great!    Oh.    Hey, Sulley!  Hey, uh, Mike. I was, uh, just... Well, listen, if you got a minute there's something I want to show you. Butbutbut... Okay, close your eyes. Follow me. Come on. III... No peeking. Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming. Come on, keep coming. Keep coming, keep coming. Mike... Follow the sultry sound of my voice. Okay, stop. Open them. Tada! Mike... Is that...? Sorry it took so long, pal. It was a lot of wood to go through. You know, it only works if you have every piece.   Boo? Kitty!  If I were a rich man  With a million or two  I'd live in a penthouse  In a room with a view  And if I were handsome  No way. It could happen. Those dreams do come true  I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you  Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have  Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have  Wouldn't have nothing  Can I tell you something? For years I have envied  You were green with it. Your grace and your charm  Everyone loves you, you know  Yes, I know, I know, I know  But I must admit it  Big guy, you always come through  I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you  You and me together  That's how it always should be  One without the other don't mean nothing to me  Nothing to me  Yeah, I wouldn't be nothing  No  If I didn't have you to serve  I'm just a punky little eyeball  And a funky optic nerve  Hey, I never told you this  Sometimes I get a little blue  Looks good on you. But I wouldn't have nothing  If I didn't have you...  Let's dance. Look, Ma, I'm dancing! Would you let me lead? Look at that. It's true. Big guys are light on their feet. Don't you dare dip me. Don't you dare dip me, don't you dare dip me. Ow. I should have stretched. Yes, I wouldn't be nothing  If I didn't have you  I know what you mean, Sulley. Because...  I wouldn't know where to go  Me, too, because I...  Wouldn't know what to do  Why do you keep singing my part? I don't have to say it  Ah, say it anyway. 'Cause we...  Both know it's true  I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have  I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have  I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you  Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you.   One more time.  It worked! I don't have to say it  Where'd everybody come from? 'Cause we both know it's true  Let's take it home, big guy. I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have  I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have  I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you  You, you  A, E, I, O...  That means you, yeah. "
Piglets Big Movie,Disney,2000,2003,Animation,"Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood  Where Christopher Robin plays  You'll find  the enchanted neighbourhood  Of Christopher's childhood days  A donkey named Eeyore is his friend  And Kanga, and little Roo  There's Rabbit and Piglet,  and there's Owl  But most of all, Winnie the Pooh  Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh  Tubby little cuddly,  all stuffed with fluff  He's Winnie the Pooh,  Winnie the Pooh  Willynilly, silly old bear!  Tigger! Are you ready for the hive yet? All I am is ready! How do I look? I mean, does this log make me look fat? Like the best honey tree a little bee will ever see. Oh, boy! Rabbit, what are you doing? Can't you tell? I'm lullabying the bees for our big plan! They seem to like Beethoven. Eeyore, what are you doing? I've got to use my big voice to tell the bees about the new hive. Buzz, buzz! Great new hive. Tigger, could you tell me what you're doing? I have to hold the fake hive high enough for the bees to see. It's the biggest part of the plan. That's what Tiggers do best. You do seem bigger than usual. Hello, Piglet. What are you all doing? Harvesting honey, of course. It's all in the plan. First, Rabbit will lure the bees with beautiful music. Then, Eeyore tempts the bees into their new hive. Then Tigger holds up the hive for the bees to see. And then comes the best part. We get honey from their old hive. Can I help you with your big plan? Thank you, Piglet, but perhaps another time. When we have a bit smaller of a plan. Or when you're a bit bigger of a piglet. I'm sorry, Piglet. But I'm afraid this is a very big plan. Places, everyone. I've gotten their attention. Great new hive. Do the bees know the plan? Piglet, don't get in the way of our big plan. I'm getting kinda itchy around my knees. Oh, dear! Get the little guy! OK, Rabbit. We're geniuses! Sticky geniuses! Oh my! Oh, goodness! The sweet taste of success. Our plan worked perfectly. Didn't think it would work. But it did. Congratulations to us all. Hooray for Pooh! And Rabbit. And Eeyore. And Tigger, too. But I was the... Oh, Piglet, I'm sorry that you couldn't be part of our big plan. But I thought I... For a minute there, I thought I was going to break out in hives. Oh, dear. Even my shadow is small. It's not as if I want  to rule the world  Or even the forest,  or even one tree  I suppose I could be happy  if I could be helpful  With just a little bit  of noticing me  If I wasn't so small,  I could be like Tigger  Figure out ways  to help some of those in need  Indeed, I could volunteer  As the friend  you would want right near  More like Rabbit and Pooh  and Eeyore  I'd be useful, and helpful  The one you would call...  It'd be nice if my friends needed me. Piglet, could you help me lullaby the bees? Piglet, could you help me call them to the hive? Yeah, Piglet! Could you help me reach higher? Piglet, we need your help. I'd be needed, and useful  More each passing day  I may be small  But in the biggest,  helpfulest way  Wonderful honey! I thought Tiggers hated honey. They do, to eat. But to stop the itching, there is nothing betterer. Did you hear something? I'm afraid I've got some honey in my ears. What's that, Pooh? I can't hear you over all that buzzing. Whose buzzing? Bees! What say we break for lunch? What about our honey? It's your honey or your life! Come on! Oh, boy! Oh, bother! Oh, joy! Thanks, donkey boy! Thanks, Eeyore. Any time. You're welcome. Quick! Make a beeline for Piglet's! Run faster! Hurry! They're gone. Or maybe just pretendering. Bees are sneaky like that. I was right. You got stung out there? No. I got stung right here, where I can keep an eye on it. Is everyone all right? Tigger's here, Eeyore's here, Pooh is here, I'm here. Who am I forgetting? I don't know. Let's ask Piglet! Oh, bother. Are you all right, Pooh? I just landed on my... self. Say, what do we have here? Oh, please, Tigger! It's just a drawing in a scrapbook. But it reminds me of the bestest family reunion I ever had. Oh, look. There's the day little Piglet caught his first heffalump. That was no heffalump. That was just Pooh with a jar on his head. I forgot how much I look like a heffalump with a jar on my head. He captured Rabbit, all right. Let me see. That doesn't look a thing like me. What's next? What's that tiny pink dot? I believe it's Piglet. Where is Piglet? We must have lost track of him after we got chased by the bees. But he's so little. He could be in big danger. We have to find him and make sure he's all right. But how will we find him? He could be anywhere. Think! You know, since this is a book of Piglet's memories, maybe it remembers where Piglet is. Brilliant deduction there, Pooh boy. It's a regular Piglet map. That's the silliest thing I've heard. Let's start with page one. Page one remembers Owl's house. Way to go, Pooh boy! Why, I bet that little fella's there right now. Let's go find him. Then off to Owl's house we go. He has an answer for everything. Not to Owl's! We'll be there all day. You can never get a word in edgeways... Goodbye, honey. I may be small, but in the biggest, helpfulest way! Eeyore? Where are you? Tigger? Where are you? Oh, no! The bees! What can I do? Well, I did help you get the haycorn, and bring you across the river. Maybe my friends need me. I have to find them. Owl, have you seen Piglet? Piglet? Of course I've seen Piglet. Many times! He's about so high, with little pink ears... No, we mean now. Have you seen him this morning? I can't imagine that he's changed that much. This is the part where Owl goes on for a while. As a matter of fact, I just saw him go by. He was just here? Come on, let's go. Or is missing. You could start, of course, in the obvious place... As I was saying, I have some great stories about my second cousin. Rupert stowed away on a threemasted... Eeyore! Come on! As I was saying, the great expedition... What an expedition it was! I told you this was a silly idea. But he was just at Owl's. That scrappety book does know where he's going. Well, Owl's house was on page one. How about page two? Which is a picture of... Kanga's house. Well, then, Kanga's house is where we'll look for Piglet. I think you must be right, Rabbit. Piglet has always liked visiting Kanga's. Not always. There was one time, I remember. Oh, yes. When Kanga and Roo first moved to the Hundred Acre Wood. Remember, Rabbit? No, I don't seem to recall. Here, this'll remind your rememberer. No! You came up with a big plan, Rabbit. I told you, I don't remember. There it is. You know, if I remember correctly, this story is really about Piglet. I just don't like it. I don't like it at all. I tell you, we won't be safe until they're out. Out of the Hundred Acre Wood. Isn't it a bit early to be spying? I've never seen anything like it. It's actually moving in. Roo, dear. Here I am, Mama. It's an invasion! Do you think they're fierce? What does fierce look like? That's what fierce looks like. She swallowed him whole. Oh, dear! He'll be eaten for sure. Are you all right? Don't eat me! Why, you must be Piglet. When Christopher Robin said you'd be dropping by, I had no idea. You know Christopher Robin? Oh, yes. He told us all about you and Pooh and Rabbit and Tigger. The ones hiding in the tree over there. Hello, dears. Did you hear that? She called us ""dears"". I'm Kanga and somewhere around here is baby Roo. I'm not a baby. See! I can do this. Well, it's very nice of you to go out of your way to welcome us. Sorry. Oh, Roo! Piglet, it's almost breakfast time. Would you like to come in for a little bite, perhaps? I do like the sound of the taste of that. No, no, no. We're all due on the other side of the wood. And we can't be late. Goodbye. Goodbye. Might I get that little something to go? Come on! Aren't they dears? Pooh will distract Kanga long enough for... Tigger and I to take Roo from her pouch. And three: Replace him with Piglet. That is very simple. Just three little steps and... What? Replace Roo with me? You and Roo are the same size. Kanga won't know the difference. Not until it's too late. How much too late? Until after we say ""Aha!"" What do you think? Haha? Why would we say ""Haha""? Not ""haha"", Piglet. Aha! It's a word to say, ""This is how things are, and were meant to be."" Kanga will know that we know where Roo is, and we'll only give him back if she promises to leave the Hundred Acre Wood and never return. How is she going to know that that is what ""Aha"" means? Because we'll practice saying it in just the right way. We're counting on you, Piglet. Everyone pretend that their flower is Kanga. Ready... set... There you all are. Oh, you brought flowers. What nice new neighbours! All right, I'm going. Roo, dear. Time to come inside. In a minute, Mama. Ready, Pooh? Yes, except for one small thing. What's that? What is it I'm supposed to do? Talk to her very hard, so that she doesn't notice anything. Of course! Come on, Roo. Hop in. Let's go inside. Kanga! Talk to her very hard. About what? Anything! I was just wondering... That is... Do you think that... Is that a fish in that tree? Which tree, dear? Up there. Snug as a pig in a blanket. What are you playing, Mr Rabbit? That's not a fish, Pooh Bear. It's a bird. Yes, but is it a starling or a mackerel? It looks kinda wiggly. It could be a jellyfish. It's tough to say. If you'll forgive me, dear, we really must be going. Peanut butter and jellyfish. Ma, look! Let's do it again. This is a fun game. Are you all right in there, Roo? I'm OK. All right, Roo, dear. Slow down! Rabbit! Oh, Roo! What was that word? Aha? That's the word. Help! Oh, my, Roo, dear. You've lost your bounce. I think it's time for your fishy oil. Fishy oil? What fishy oil? It'll help you bounce nice and high. You don't want to grow up small and weak like Piglet. Now, did you have something you wanted to tell me, Roo? No... Down the hatch! See that? You got your bounce back. If you're a good little Roo, I'll let you have another spoonful. No! Oh, dear. I'm a goner! You act like I'm going to cook you for dinner. Aren't you? Why, of course not. I'm going to give you a bath. Cook me instead! But Roo, dear, don't you know by now, a mother always knows what's best? It's a mother's intuition  to make a little space  It's her quiet mission  to tidy up her place  A mother's intuition  is like a kangaroo's  She hops around, she mops  the ground, she fusses over you  A mother, with her intuition  Will know just what to do  It's a mother's intuition  to wash her baby  Well, she won't forget  behind the ears  And the extra soap suds on the tail  A mother's into cleaning,  she'll clean until she's through  She's smart enough, she's wise  enough to add up two and two  A mother, with her intuition  Will know just what to do  A mother has a feeling,  she pays special attention  If someone is concealing,  if someone's playing tricks  She rubs and scrubs  and scours the secrets  Until the answer clicks  Then she takes a brush  and polishes your teeth  She'll make you shine and sparkle  new until she finds the real you  Underneath!  Oh, my goodness! Isn't it charming?  Just Mummy and little Roo  Fresh as a daisy,  sparkling just like new  It's a mother's intuition  It's a mother's intuition  It's a mother's intuition  Now, you know what's next. I'm afraid to find out. There's always two things you get after your bath. A cookie, and a kiss... Well, it's a very subtle distinction. But you see, a jellyfish sounds more like a ""Bleugh. Hi, I'm a jellyfish!"" Here, Tigger, Pooh Bear. Look! Another creature of the fiercerous kind! Rabbit was right! But it's me! Piglet! Nah! The Piglet we know isn't half as fuzzy as you. You can't pull the fluff over our eyes. Pooh. Tell him who I am. Well, I'd love to, whoever you are. Come to think of it, he might be a fuzzy fringed thingamawhatsit. No, no, this is more of the feather furred frizzamambobble variety. But can we be sure, Tigger? I'll prove it to you. Piglet, where did you come from? Lucky thing that fuzzy fringed thingamabob didn't catch you. What did you find out? Awfully fierce and fiercely awful? At first I thought so, but then I found out... she's very nice. Hello, dears. She called us ""dears"" again! I could get used to this. Would you like to come in for that little something? I'd love to. I love little somethings. But what do we tell Rabbit? Mama, look at me. You gotta see Mr Rabbit's garden. You hear that? Mr Rabbit! He's got carrots and lettuce and beans, and we played... Settle down, dear. Now, what do we say to Mr Rabbit? Thank you, Mr Rabbit. I had fun. Well, I certainly enjoyed myself, too. And you can call me Rabbit. I like you, Rabbit. I like you too, Roo. You're right, Piglet. This is the way things are. And were meant to be. If it weren't for Piglet, I wouldn't be friends with Roo. And we'd never have found out how nice Kanga was. We'd never have any of Kanga's songs. Or her hugs. Or her cookies. Which my nose is telling my tummy are right nearby. Kanga! We're so glad you didn't leave. What are you talking about, Tigger? How Piglet took a bath for us. Not just any old buddy'd do something that brave for his friends. Don't know if I would. It was a very biggish thing for a littlish guy to do. We're so worried about him, because we lost him at the honey harvest. So we're using his book of memories to find him. We hope. Oh, dear Piglet! But he's so small! He could be in big danger! Mama, may I help and look for Piglet? Sorry, Eeyore. Can I, Mama? Can I? Of course, dear. Piglet needs your help. Pooh, would you like a cookie before you go? My heart tells me I should keep looking for Piglet. But you dears will need something to keep your strength up. My tummy says yes! I just thought Piglet would need to keep his strength up, too. Bye, Mama. Byebye, dear. So, where do we look first? The scrapbook will give us an idea. It's a book of memories. It remembers where Piglet is. Try page three. Page three shows all of us at the North Pole. That was the day we made our most splendiferous discovery of all! Then that's where we shall look! This is not the way to the North Pole. Last time, if I reconnoitre correcticly, the North Pole was 40 minutes southeasterly in that direction, this way, magnetically speaking. No. Last time, we went this way. No, that would be the northeast pole. No, no, no and no! I know what I'm talking about. It's this way! Perhaps if we told the story, the story would tell us how to get there. Don't forget the part about Piglet! Piglet? How does Piglet fit in? Roo's right. It really is a story about Piglet, isn't it? Nineety eight, nineety nine, seventytwosie and thirteenety... and thirtysixety... gravitydefiant, Tiggerific bounces! Look out below! Hello, Tigger. Hello, Piglet. What are you doing? Just waiting for the other shoe to fall. I knew it. These things always travel in pairs. These are Christopher Robin's big boots. That can mean only one thing. An expedition! A whichpedition? Yes, an expedition. It's when you go off to find a thing. What are we going to find? The North Pole. Is it scary? What is it? Yeah, we never found one of them before. Well, it's a thing you discover. Are bears good at discovering it? And Tiggers? Everyone will come along. And if you see the North Pole, shout ""Eureka!"" Why would we do that? Because it means, ""There's the North Pole."" Eureka! Where? Gesundheit! Sorry. I was just practising. We need a marching song. A marching song to help us along. Sing ho, for the life of a bear!  That's me! Sing ho, for the expedition  Sing ho, for the life of a bear  Sing ho, for the expedition  It's a fine day for marching,  there's a tiny little breeze  And when there's honey for the  making, there's a buzz among the bees  Sing ho, for the life of a bear Sing ho, for the expedition Sing ho, for the life of a bear Sing ho, for the expedition I'm itching and scratching. Scratching and itching. To find the North Pole! Finding the Pole may be the goal, But it's drumming for funning that makes you sing Sing ho, for the life of a bear Sing ho, for the expedition Sing ho, for the life of a bear Sing ho, for the expedition. This is fun! Sing ho, for the life of a bear Sing ho, for the expedition. One more time! Sing ho, for the life of a bear Sing ho, for the expedition  I like that song. Silly old bear. Would you like a haycorn, Pooh? No, thank you. But a cookie would be nice. Or a banana. Christopher Robin, perhaps I could find it easier if only I were sure... that is, if I knew what the North Pole looked like. Well, it's kind of... It's sort of... Well, I suppose we'll know exactly what it is when we see it. Are we there yet? Pooh! I just fed my tummy and it's still calling me. Hey, look at me, Pooh. I am. Pooh, I'm swimming. Just a moment, Roo. I'm talking to my tummy. Of course you're swimming. You shouldn't have had that second cookie. That's not your stomach, Pooh. It's Roo. Oh, my! Roo! I don't believe expotitions usually go into the water. Quick! Don't panic. Everything's fine. Nobody's in any kind of... Specially not Roo. Do something! Everyone! Do anything! Don't worry, Roo boy! I'll save you. Thanks, Tigger. But I don't think I need saving. I can help. Piglet, stay out of the way while we save Roo. Don't want to have to rescue two little guys. Catch onto my tail, Roo. I'll pull you out. Just tell me when you're on. Rabbit, Roo, are we going swimming? Maybe we can use this to save Roo. Give me a push, Pooh. Thank you, Piglet. Now I've got him. Faster, Pooh. Faster. Pooh? Where is he, Rabbit? Pooh, look the other way. I can see him perfectly from here. Are you sure, Rabbit? You're right. You can see better from up here. There he is. Roo? Are you OK? I got you, Roo! I got you. Here he is, Kanga! Oh, where'd he go? You can rescue me now. I'm getting kind of tired. Use the pole. Use the pole. No time for fishing, Piglet. We gotta save Roo. Grab on, Roo. Pooh, could you please hold this? Did you see me swimming? That's called swimming, what I was doing. Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear, where did you find that stick? What stick? That stick. Well, I was standing here without a stick, and then I had a stick, so... maybe the stick found me. Assembled adventurers, the expedition is over. Pooh has discovered the North Pole. This? That. Eureka! Well, I'll be! That's the North Pole, all right, all righty! I should have seen it myself. But... Oh... Eureka! Poleerific! Positively magnetic! Goodness! Where's Eeyore? Did you grab on yet, Roo? Roo? Somebody? Anybody? Hooray for Pooh! I always liked that story. It has such a lovely end. But nobody said hooray for Piglet. He was so brave. For someone so small. And Piglets hate water. Come to think of it, so do Tiggers. Thank you, tail! Thank you, Piglet. Wherever you are. Look! Piglet's scarf. That's it! Come on, let's go. Missed him again. Oh, my. You know, Piglet's scarf never goes anywhere without Piglet. This is more serious than I thought. Maybe he's in grave danger. Maybe heffalump's got him. Heffalumps? Or a woosel! Woosels! And now, he's out there somewhere. Woosels! And now, he's out there somewhere. With this storm blowing in. Oh, goodness! Goodness! Do you think he's going to be all right? Piglet shall be very all right indeed. Don't let his small size worry you. Once, he even made a whole house. He did? Do you know the story of ""The House at Pooh Corner""? No. Oh, yes, it's right here. Page three. On page four. That's after three. It's a lovely tale. Don't you think so, Tigger? Tigger? Pooh Corner, remember? Is this story about Piglet, too? Why, yes, Roo, it is. He seems to be the hero of every story. The more it snows The more it goes The more it goes on snowing And nobody knows How cold my toes How cold my toes are growing I was just thinking, Pooh. Were you thinking of a way to keep warm? Actually, I was thinking about how you have a house, and I have a house, and Rabbit and Owl and Christopher Robin all have houses, but poor Eeyore has nothing. Well, that's certainly something we can think about. Think, think, think. I've got it! Got what? We'll build Eeyore a house of his own. That's a wonderful idea, Pooh. But, where shall we build it? Well... Right here. Because this is where I thought of it. And since this is where I thought of it, we shall call this place Pooh Corner. Pooh Corner? Pooh, I was thinking along with you. Yes, that's true, Piglet. So, we could call this place Pooh and Piglet Corner. If Pooh Corner didn't sound better, which it does. Being smaller and more like a corner. So, Pooh Corner it is. Look, snow somersaults. Bother! I tried to stop, but it's snow use! Get it? Snow use! So, what you doing? We're going to build Eeyore a house at Pooh Corner. What a Tiggerific idea! What are you going to build it with? We haven't decided. I just bounced by a humongerous pile of sticks. They'd be positively perfect for a donkey house. Come on! Bounce this way! Follow the bouncing Tigger. The wonderful thing about Tigger is Tigger's a wonderful thing Their tops are made of rubber, their bottoms are made of string But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is, I'm the only one!  What did I tell you? More sticks than you can stick a shake at! It's almost as if someone left them here for us. I wonder... Let's get started, so we can finish in time. In time for what? Lunch. With a few good friends  and a stick or two  A house is built  at a corner called Pooh  With a friend and a stick,  or three or four  A house is built  where it wasn't  Befoooore  With a window here  And there a door  And a nail and a peg  For the coat of Eeyore  With a few good friends  and a stick or two  A house is built  at a corner called Pooh  With a friend and a stick,  or three or four  A house is built where it wasn't  Befooooore  Dress it down or dress it up  Invite Tigger for tea  And Owl for supper  With a few good friends  and a stick or two  A house is built  at a corner called Pooh  With a friend and a stick,  or three or four  A house is built where it wasn't  Befooooore  There. It's all entirely done. Let's show old donkey boy the fruits of our elbow grease. With a few good friends  Oh, bother. I suspectorate there's something wrong with these sticks. All we wanted was for Eeyore to have his own house. You know, Eeyore could come live with me. That is very hospititious of you, Pooh. Let's go give old donkey boy the good news. Oh, dear. Hello! Pooh Bear! You are just in time. Look what I made. Why, Christopher Robin, it's wonderful. What is it? Why, it's you, Pooh Bear. No wonder he looks so familiar. It looks just like you. Except for the donkey head. Eeyore, were you under there the whole time? I suppose I was. Weren't you awfully cold? I've been colder. Last night, for instance, it got downright... Freezing. So I did it. I built myself a house. Hear that? Eeyore built himself a house. Just a leaky pile of sticks. Did you say sticks? So you have seen it! I have? Seen what? The funny thing about houses is, they never know if they're coming or going. So they do. Well, someone, somewhere, must know something. I do! What's that? A highstepping pig highfaluter! I believe it's Piglet on stilts. Eeyore's house is over there. Come on, I'll show you. Toodleoo. Look at that. Well, I'll be... Oh, my goodness! Welcome home, Eeyore. It's my house, all right. But I'm sure this isn't where I built it. Where you built it? But I... I suppose the wind must have blown it over here. The wind? Oh, yeah, the wind! It's been known to do strange and windylike things. I think the wind had a little help. Right, Piglet? The important thing is, Eeyore has a house. And here it is. And it's as good as ever. And even never betterer. You really think so? Oh, yes. Much more better than ever, even, Piglet. Just one thing bothers me. Oh, dear. What might that be? Afraid I'll lose it again. Don't worry, Eeyore. I put up a sign, so you'll always know where it is. Pooh Corner! Nice. Hooray for Eeyore's house. With a few good friends and a stick or two We can build a house at a corner called Pooh With a friend and a stick, or three or four A house is there where it wasn't before  What? It's a little crowded. But it'll do. And that is how Piglet got the idea that you, Eeyore, should have your own house. You mean Piglet built Eeyore's house all by himself? Yes, and that's just how much Piglet cares. Best house I ever had. And named it after me. Oh, dear. We'd better find him soon. Roo's getting cold. Perhaps we should look in the book again. I just got a Tiggerific idea! Let's see where the book ends and go there. No, if we do this in an orderly manner, we'll find him much quicker. Now, let's see. We've been there, and there... But orderlier doesn't seem to be working, does it? All I'm concerned about is finding Piglet. I want to find him, too! We all want to find him! Rabbit, look! Oh, my! Oh, my! You're ruining it. I am not. Hand it over, bunny boy. Finding Piglets is what Tiggers do best. It's what rabbits do best. Tiggers! No, rabbits. Stop fighting! Be careful. That's the only way we have to find Piglet. There goes our map. And Piglet's memories. I only wanted to find Piglet. We all did. We'd better go back to Piglet's. We have to get Roo warm and dry. I do wish I'd called it Pooh And Piglet Corner. The more I look inside  The more he isn't there  What am I supposed to do?  When Piglet is not everywhere  The more I rack my brain  The more I search in vain  I guess I'll have a little snack  And wait for it to start to rain  That's the Piglet I know. Always glad to see you. Always thoughtful. Always brave. Never thinking of himself. Draw another one, Pooh. Maybe I will draw a picture  And while I'm busy doing that  My mind will wander off somewhere  And Piglet will reappear  My mind will wander off somewhere  And Piglet will be right here  The more I look inside  The more you're near to me  I see you here, I see you there  Feel you everywhere  We gotta get Piglet. Let's go. Yes, yes, come on. Poor Piglet! Oh, goodness! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Look! Oh, look what I found. It's one of Piglet's scrapbook pages. Look, another one. We can put Piglet's book back together. Then we can find him in no time. Let's keep looking. I found one. Me, too. Me, too. Eureka! I think... I found... Another! We're getting closer. Here's one. How many does that make? Another. Piglet will be so happy. What's that over there? Come back, memory! One more scrappy page for Piglet's scrappety book. Hey, look. There it is! But how will we get it? We need help. That's gotta be dangerous. What could he be thinking? Who? Pooh. Now, noone panic! The first thing we do is not to panic. Somebody do something! Do anything! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! What are you doing? I'm just getting Piglet's memories. Oh, bother! Pooh needs help. Oh, bother, bother! Rabbit was right. We could use a little help. Here you go, buddy boy. We made you a rescue rope. Out of us. Me, too. It's our plan. Oh, my! Pooh, what are you waiting for? The rescue rope isn't rescuing. We need a little bit more. We just need a little help. Who's small enough? Oh, dear! Who can help? Piglet! You can do it! My friends need me! Hang on, Pooh! Oh, I'm hanging. Piglet! Oh, Piglet! Your memories! We never got to tell Piglet how we feel about him. Poor Pooh. Should have told them when we had the chance. Here you go, Rabbit. Something must be very sad. Well, of course it's sad. Pooh! Piglet! Thank goodness you're safe. We're so glad to see you. Glad to see me? It's so good to have you back again. We've been following your memories all over the Hundred Acre Wood. And they've led us right to you. Too bad they're all floating down the river. Goodness! Oh, no! Oh, bother! We're ever so sorry, Piglet. The scrapbook's not that important. But it showed us the great things you've done. Oh, I've never done anything great. Well, of course you have! Let's tell him, everyone. No, let's show him! I can't stand the excitement. Here we are. Go on. Is that me? That's you. I'm so big! Well, of course you are. Why, you're double XL! If it weren't for you, Piglet, I wouldn't be friends with Roo. Yeah, and thanks for saving me with the North Pole. Piglet... Pooh Corner's not a bad place to live. I'd say this calls for a celebration. Come on, chase me. Here I come. Watch out. Come on, you can do better than that. Get him, Roo! That's funny. Look! Piglet, can I try? Oh, my! Do something, everyone. Good one, Piglet! It's carrot cake. Rabbit, you're a natural! Delicious! Where's Pooh? Piglet! I have one more thing to show you. But Pooh, your cake. It can wait. Hurry, Piglet. We shall have something right after I show you a little something, Piglet! It's right over here. Pooh and Piglet Corner! Yes, Piglet. It's the least we could do for a very small Piglet, who's done such very big things. Thank you, Piglet.

Ratatouille,Disney,2000,2007,Animation,"Although each of the world's countries would like to dispute this fact,  we French know the truth:  The best food in the world is made in France.  The best food in France is made in Paris.  And the best food in Paris, some say, is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.  Gusteau's restaurant is the toast of Paris,  booked five months in advance.  And his dazzling ascent to the top of fine French cuisine  has made his competitors envious.  He is the youngest chef ever to achieve a fivestar rating.  Chef Gusteau's cookbook, Anyone Can Cook! climbed to the top of the bestseller list.  But not everyone celebrates its success.  Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook! What's even more amusing is that Gusteau actually seems to believe it.  I, on the other hand, take cooking seriously.  And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.  This is me.  I think it's apparent I need to rethink my life a little bit.  What's my problem?  First of all, I'm a rat.  Which means life is hard.  And second, I have a highly developed sense of taste and smell.  Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean... Oh! Small twist of lemon. Whoa, you can smell all that? You have a gift. This is Emile, my brother. He's easily impressed.  So you can smell ingredients? So what? This is my dad. He's never impressed.  He also happens to be the leader of our clan.  So, what's wrong with having highly developed senses?  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that! What's going on here? Turns out that funny smell was rat poison.  Suddenly, Dad didn't think my talent was useless.  I was feeling pretty good about my gift,  until Dad gave me a job.  Clean. Clean. That's right. Poison checker.  Cleanerific. Cleanerino. Close to godliness. Which means clean. You know, cleanliness is close to... Never mind. Move on. Well, it made my dad proud.  Now, don't you feel better, Remy? You've helped a noble cause. Noble? We're thieves, Dad. And what we're stealing is, let's face it, garbage. It isn't stealing if no one wants it. If no one wants it, why are we stealing it? Let's just say we have different points of view.  This much I knew:  If you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff.  But to my dad...  Food is fuel. You get picky about what you put in the tank, your engine is going to die. Now shut up and eat your garbage. Look, if we're going to be thieves, why not steal the good stuff in the kitchen, where nothing is poisoned? First of all, we are not thieves. Secondly, stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans. It's dangerous. I know I'm supposed to hate humans, but there's something about them.  They don't just survive. They discover, they create.  I mean, just look at what they do with food.  How can I describe it?  Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell.  There is excellence all around you.  You need only be aware to stop and savor it.  Oh, Gusteau was right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, amazing.  Each flavor was totally unique.  But combine one flavor with another,  and something new was created.  So now I had a secret life.  The only one who knew about it was Emile.  Hey, Emile. Emile. I found a mushroom. Come on, you're good at hiding food. Help me find a good place to put this. He doesn't understand me, but I can be myself around him.  Why are you walking like that? I don't want to constantly have to wash my paws. Did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with? You ever think about what we put into our mouths? All the time. When I eat, I don't want to taste everywhere my paws have been. Well, go ahead. But if Dad sees you walking like that, he's not going to like it. What have you got there? You found cheese? And not just any cheese. Tomme de chÃ¨vre de pays! That would go beautifully with my mushroom. And... This rosemary! This rosemary with maybe with a few drops from this sweet grass. Well, throw it on the pile, I guess, and then we'll... You know... We don't want to throw this in with the garbage. This is special. But we're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or, you know, Dad's gonna... Emile! There are possibilities unexplored here. We got to cook this. Now, exactly how we cook this is the real... Yeah. The key is to keep turning it. Get the smoky flavor nice and even. That storm's getting closer. Hey, Remy, you think that maybe we shouldn't be so... You got to taste this! This is... It's got this kind of... It's burny, melty... It's not really a smoky taste. It's a certain... It's kind of like a... It's got, like, this ""baboom, zap"" kind of taste. Don't you think? What would you call that flavor? Lightningy? Yeah. It's lightningy! We got to do that again. Okay, when the next storm comes, we'll go up on the roof... I know what this needs. Saffron. A little saffron would make this. Saffron. Why do I get the feeling it's in the kitchen? It's in the kitchen. Saffron. Not good. Saffron. Don't like it. She's going to wake up. I've been down here a million times. She turns on the cooking channel, boom, she never wakes up. You've been here a million times? I'm telling you, saffron will be just the thing. Gusteau swears by it. Okay. Who's Gusteau? Just the greatest chef in the world. Wrote this cookbook. Wait. You read? Well, not excessively. Oh, man. Does Dad know? You could fill a book, a lot of books, with things Dad doesn't know. And they have, which is why I read. Which is also our secret. I don't like secrets. All this cooking and reading and TVwatching while we read and cook. It's like you're involving me in crime, and I let you. Why do I let you? What's taking those kids so long? L'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh? Gusteau says it's excellent. Good thing the old lady is a food love... Forget mystique. This is about your cooking.  Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look. Great cooking is not for the faint of heart.  You must be imaginative, strong hearted.  You must try things that may not work.  And you must not let anyone define your limits  because of where you come from.  Your only limit is your soul.  What I say is true. Anyone can cook. But only the fearless can be great.  Pure poetry. But it was not to last.  Gusteau's restaurant lost one of its five stars  after a scathing review by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.  It was a severe blow to Gusteau,  and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards,  which, according to tradition, meant the loss of another star.  Gusteau is dead? Run! No, you'll lead her to the colony! Help, Remy, help! Emile! Start swinging the light! Try to grab you. Emile, swing to me. Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats. Let me through! The book. Excuse me. Move, move. Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move. Get the bridge up! Move it, move it! Hey, Johnny! Hurry! Push off. Come on. Get hold! Take the baby. Here! Give me your paw. Hey, wait for me! Is everybody here? Do we have everybody? Wait a minute. Where's Remy? Right here. I'm coming. I'm coming! Hold on, Son. Give him something to grab on to. Come on, boy. Paddle, Son. Come on. Reach for it. You can do it. Remy! Dad! Come on. You can make it. You can make it. Guys, wait. Stop! Remy. Come on. Paddle. Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on. Dad? Dad? Which way? I waited  for a sound,  a voice,  a sign,  something.  If you are hungry, go up and look around, Remy. Why do you wait and mope? Well, I've just lost my family, all my friends, probably forever. How do you know? Well, I... You are an illustration. Why am I talking to you? Well, you just lost your family, all your friends. You are lonely. Yeah. Well, you're dead. Ah, but that is no match for wishful thinking. If you focus on what you've left behind, you'll never be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up and look around. Champagne! What are you doing? I'm hungry. I don't know where I am, and I don't know when I'll find food again. Remy, you are better than that. You are a cook. A cook makes. A thief takes. You are not a thief. But I am hungry. Food will come, Remy. Food always comes to those who love to cook. You think I am playing? You don't have the guts. Paris? All this time I've been underneath Paris? Wow. It's beautiful. The most beautiful. Gusteau's? Your restaurant? You've led me to your restaurant. It seems as though I have. Yes. There it is. I have led you to it. I got to see this. Ready to go on table seven. Coming around. One order of steamed pike up. Coming up. I need more soup bowls, please. I need two rack of lamb. I need more leeks. I need two salmon, three salade composÃ©e, and three fillet. Three orders of salade composÃ©e working. Firing two orders, seared salmon. Three fillet working. I need plates. Fire seven. Three salade composÃ©e up. Don't mess with my mise! Open down low. I'm getting buried here. Hello, Chef Skinner. How your night be now? Bonjour , chef. Hello, Chef Skinner. Evening, chef. Ordering deux fillet. Hey, boss, look who is here. Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy. Hi. All grown up, eh? You remember Renata, Gusteau's old flame? Yes. How are you... Linguini. Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit. How is... My mother? Renata. Yes, Renata. How is she? Good. Well, not... She's been better. I mean... She died. I'm sorry. Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven, so she's covered. You know, afterlifewise? What's this? She left it for you. I think she hoped it would help me, you know, get a job here. But of course. Gusteau wouldn't hesitate. Any son of Renata's is more than... Yes, well, we could file this and if something suitable opens up... We have already hired him. What? How dare you hire someone without my... We needed a garbage boy. Oh, garbage. Well... I'm glad it worked out. I can't believe it. A real gourmet kitchen, and I get to watch. You've read my book. Let us see how much you know, huh? Which one is the chef? Oh, that guy. Very good. Who is next in command? The sous chef. There. The sous is responsible for the kitchen when the chef's not around. Saucier, in charge of sauces. Very important. Chef de partie, demi chef de partie, both important. Commis, commis, they're cooks. Very important. You are a clever rat. Now, who is that? Oh, him? He's nobody. Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen. No, he's a plongeuror something. He washes dishes or takes out the garbage. He doesn't cook. But he could. Uh, no. How do you know? What do I always say? Anyone can cook. Well, yeah, anyone can. That doesn't mean that anyone should. Well, that is not stopping him. See? What is he doing? No. No! No, this is terrible! He's ruining the soup. And nobody's noticing? It's your restaurant. Do something. What can I do? I am a figment of your imagination. But he's ruining the soup! We got to tell someone that he's... Table five coming up, right now. Coming down the line. Set. Hot! Open oven! Coming around. Oui , chef. One fillet mignon, three lamb, two duck. Fire those soufflÃ©s for table six, ja . Five minutes, chef. Oh, God. Tonight, I'd like to present the foie gras. It has a wonderful finish. Ready to go on table seven. Come on! Let's go! Oui , chef. Remy! What are you waiting for? Is this going to become a regular thing with you? You know how to fix it. This is your chance. The soup! Where is the soup? Out of my way. Move it, garbage boy! You are cooking? How dare you cook in my kitchen? Where do you get the gall to even attempt something so monumentally idiotic? I should have you drawn and quartered! I'll do it. I think the law is on my side. Larousse, draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeeze the fat out of his head. What are you blathering about? The soup! Soup? Stop that soup! Waiter. Linguini! You're fired! FIRED! Fired! She wants to see the chef. But he... What did the customer say? It was not a customer. It was a critic. Ego? Solene LeClaire. LeClaire? What did she say? She likes the soup. Wait. What do you mean, ""Wait""? You're the reason I'm in this mess. Someone is asking about your soup. What are you playing at? Am I still fired? You can't fire him. What? LeClaire likes it, yeah? She made a point of telling you so. If she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible... He's a garbage boy. Who made something she liked. How can we claim to represent the name of Gusteau if we don't uphold his most cherished belief? And what belief is that, Mademoiselle Tatou? Anyone can cook. Perhaps I have been a bit harsh on our new garbage boy. He has taken a bold risk and we should reward that, as Chef Gusteau would have. If he wishes to swim in dangerous waters, who are we to deny him? You were escaping? Oh, yeah. Since you have expressed such an interest in his cooking career, you shall be responsible for it. Anyone else? Then back to work. You are either very lucky or very unlucky. You will make the soup again, and this time, I'll be paying attention. Very close attention. They think you might be a cook. But you know what I think, Linguini? I think you are a sneaky, overreaching little... Rat! Rat! Get the rat. Linguini. Get something to trap it. It's getting away. Get it, get it, get it. What should I do now? Kill it. Now? No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad? Do you know what would happen to us if anyone knew we had a rat in our kitchen? They'd close us down. Our reputation is hanging by a thread as it is. Take it away from here. Far away. Kill it. Dispose of it. Go! Don't look at me like that! You aren't the only one who's trapped. They expect me to cook it again! I mean, I'm not ambitious. I wasn't trying to cook. I was just trying to stay out of trouble. You're the one who was getting fancy with the spices! What did you throw in there? Oregano? No? What? Rosemary? That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary? You didn't throw rosemary in there? Then what was all the flipping and all the throwing the... I need this job. I've lost so many. I don't know how to cook, and now I'm actually talking to a rat as if you... Did you nod? Have you been nodding? You understand me? So I'm not crazy! Wait a second, wait a second. I can't cook, can I? But you... You can, right? Look, don't be so modest. You're a rat, for Pete's sake. Whatever you did, they liked it. Yeah. This could work. Hey, they liked the soup! They liked the soup. Do you think you could do it again? Okay, I'm going to let you out now. But we're together on this. Right? Okay. So this is it. I mean, it's not much, but it's, you know... Not much. It could be worse. There's heat and light and a couch with a TV. So, you know, what's mine is yours. Are you...  Is this a dream?  The best kind of dream.  One we can share.  But why here?  Why now?  Why not here?  Why not now?  What better place to dream than in Paris?  Morning, Little Chef. Rise and... Oh, no. Idiot! I knew this would happen! I let a rat into my place and tell him what's mine is his! Eggs, gone! Stupid! He's stolen food and hit the road! What did I expect? That's what I get for trusting a... Hi. Is that for me? That's good. What did you put in this? Where'd you get that? Look, it's delicious. But don't steal. I'll buy some spices, okay? Oh, no. We're going to be late. And on the first day! Come on, Little Chef! ""Though I, like many other critic, ""had written off Gusteau as irrelevant since the great chef's death, ""the soup was a revelation. A spicy yet subtle taste experience."" Solene LeClaire? Yes! ""Against all odds, Gusteau's has recaptured our attention. ""Only time will tell if they deserve it."" Well... You know. Look, I know it's stupid and weird, but neither of us can do this alone, so we got to do it together, right? You with me? So let's do this thing! I... Welcome to hell. Now, recreate the soup. Take as much time as you need. All week if you must. Soup. You little... You son of a... You got... This is not going to work, Little Chef! I'm going to lose it if we do this anymore. We've got to figure out something else. Something that doesn't involve any biting, or nipping, or running up and down my body with your little rat feet. The biting! No! Scampering! No! No scampering or scurrying. Understand, Little Chef? Little Chef? Oh, you're hungry. Okay. So let's think this out. You know how to cook, and I know how to appear human. We need to work out a system so that I do what you want in a way that doesn't look like I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef. Would you listen to me? I'm insane! I'm insane! I'm insane! In a refrigerator talking to a rat about cooking in a gourmet restaurant. I will never pull this off! Linguini? We gotta communicate. I can't be constantly checking for a yes or no head shake from a... The rat! I saw it! A rat? Yes, a rat. Right next to you. What are you doing in here? I'm just familiarizing myself with, you know, the vegetables and such. Get out. One can get too familiar with vegetables, you know! That was close. Are you okay up there? How did you do that? That's strangely involuntary! One look and I knew we had the same crazy idea.  Okay. Where are you taking me? Wait. Wait. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. All right. That should do it. Congratulations. You were able to repeat your accidental success. But you'll need to know more than soup if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy. Colette will be responsible for teaching you how we do things here. Listen, I just want you to know how honored I am to be studying under such... No! You listen. I just want you to know exactly who you are dealing with. How many women do you see in this kitchen? Well, I... Only me. Why do you think that is? Well, I... Because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men. Rules designed to make it impossible for women to enter this world. But still I'm here. How did this happen? Because, well, because you... Because I am the toughest cook in this kitchen. I've worked too hard for too long to get here and I am not going to jeopardize it for some garbage boy who got lucky. Got it? Wow! Easy to cook. Easy to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food Chineeasy. Excellent work, FranÃ§ois, as usual. It's good, isn't it? I want you to work up something for my latest frozen food concept. Gusteau's Corn Puppies. They're like corn dogs, only smaller. Bite size. What are corn dogs? Cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried. You know, American. Whip something up. Maybe Gusteau in overalls and Huckleberry Tom hat. Or as a big ear of corn in doggie makeup. Yes. But, please, with dignity. Get my lawyer! Well, the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from the date of death no heir appears, Gusteau's business interests will pass to his sous chef. You. I know what the will stipulates. What I want to know is if this letter... If this boy changes anything! There's not much resemblance. There's no resemblance at all. He is not Gusteau's son. Gusteau had no children, and what of the timing of all this? The deadline in the will expires in less than a month! Suddenly, some boy arrives with a letter from his recently deceased mother claiming Gusteau is his father? Highly suspect! This is Gusteau's? Yes, yes, yes. May I? Of course. But the boy does not know. She claims she never told him, or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell. Why you? What does she want? A job for the boy. Only a job? Well, yes. Then what are you worried about? If he works here, you'll be able to keep an eye on him while I do a little digging. Find out how much of this is real. I will need you to collect some DNA samples from the boy. Hair, maybe. Mark my words. The whole thing is highly suspect. He knows something. Relax, he's a garbage boy. I think you can handle him. What are you doing? I'm cutting vegetables. I'm cutting vegetables? No! You waste energy and time! You think cooking is a cute job, like Mommy in the kitchen? Well, Mommy never had to face the dinner rush when the orders come flooding in, and every dish is different and none are simple, and all of the different cooking times, but must arrive on the customer's table at exactly the same time, hot and perfect! Every second counts, and you cannot be Mommy! What is this? Keep your station clear! When the meal rush comes, what will happen? Messy stations slow things down. Food doesn't go, orders pile up. Disaster. I'll make this easy to remember. Keep your station clear, or I will kill you! Your sleeves look like you threw up on them. Keep your hands and arms in, close to the body. Like this. See? Always return to this position. Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils, hot metal, keep your arms in. You will minimize cuts and burns and keep your sleeves clean. Mark of a chef: Messy apron, clean sleeves. I know the Gusteau style cold. In every dish, Chef Gusteau always has something unexpected. I will show you. I memorize all his recipe. Always do something unexpected. No. Follow the recipe. But you just said that... No, no, no. It was his job to be unexpected. It is our job to... Follow his recipes. Follow the recipe. How do you tell how good bread is without tasting it? Not the smell, not the look, but the sound of the crust. Listen. Symphony of crackle. Only great bread sound this way. The only way to get the best produce is to have first pick of the day and there are only two way to get first pick. Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower. VoilÃ ! The best restaurant get first pick. People think haute cuisine is snooty. So chef must also be snooty. But not so. Lalo there ran away from home at 12. Got hired by circus people as an acrobat. And then he get fired for messing around with the ringmaster's daughter. Horst has done time. What for? No one know for sure. He changes the story every time you ask him. I defrauded a major corporation. I robbed the second largest bank in France using only a ballpoint pen. I created a hole in the ozone over Avignon. I killed a man with this thumb. Don't ever play cards with Pompidou. He's been banned from Las Vegas and Monte Carlo. Larousse ran gun for the Resistance. Which resistance? He won't say. Apparently, they didn't win. So you see. We are artist, pirate. More than cooks are we. We? Oui . You are one of us now, oui ? Oui. Thank you, by the way, for all the advice about cooking. Thank you, too. For what? For taking it. The rat! But he is a... I just dropped my keys. Have you decided this evening? Your soup is excellent. But... But we order it every time. What else do you have? Well, we have a very nice foie gras. I know about the foie gras. The old standby, used to be famous for it. What does the chef have that's new? Someone has asked what is new! New? Yes. What do I tell them? Well, what did you tell them? I told them I would ask! What are you blathering about? Customers are asking what is new. What should I tell them? What did you tell them? I told them I would ask! This is simple. Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe, something we haven't made in a while... They know about the old stuff. They like Linguini's soup. They are asking for food from Linguini? A lot of customers like the soup. That's all we are saying. Were we saying that? Very well. If it's Linguini they want tell them Chef Linguini has prepared something special for them. Something definitely off menu. Oh, and don't forget to stress its Linguininess. Oui , chef. Now is your chance to try something worthy of your talent, Linguini. A forgotten favorite of the chef's, sweetbread Ã  la Gusteau. Colette will help you. Oui , chef. Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry. Are you sure? That recipe was a disaster. Gusteau himself said so. Just the sort of challenge a budding chef needs. ""Sweetbread Ã  la Gusteau. ""Sweetbread cooked in a seaweed salt crust ""with cuttlefish tentacle, dog rose purÃ©e, ""geoduck egg, dried white fungus? ""Anchovy licorice sauce."" I don't know this recipe, but it's Gusteau's, so... Lalo! We have some veal stomach soaking, yes? Yes! The veal stomach, I get that. Veal stomach? Okay. I'll be right back. Where... Hey, I got to... Don't mind me. I just need to borrow this real quick. Let's see, over here... I'll be back. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm going to... Apparently, I need this. I'll be right... I'm going to pick that up. I got some of that spice. Okay. What are you doing? You're supposed to be preparing the Gusteau recipe. This is the recipe. The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else have you... You are improvising? This is no time to experiment. The customer are waiting. You're right. I should listen to you! Stop that! Stop what? Freaking me out! Whatever you are doing, stop it. Where is the special order? Coming! I thought we were together on this. We are together. Then what are you doing? It's very hard to explain. The special? Come get it! Whoa, whoa. I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce. Don't you dare. I'm not, I'm not. I'm... Sorry. Is Linguini's dish done yet? Ja . It's as bad as we remember. Just went out. Did you taste it? Ja , of course, before he changed it. Good. What? How could he change it? He changed it as it was going out the door! They love it! Other diners are already asking about it, about Linguini. I have seven more orders! That's wonderful. I'd like one of those. Special order! What is that? Special order! Special order! Special order! To Linguini. Congratulations, Mr. Linguini. Cheers, ja ? Drink now, there's plenty. Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air. We really did it tonight. Got your toque. Oh, seriously now. I'd love to have a little talk with you, Linguini, in my office. Am I in trouble? Trouble? No. A little wine, a friendly chat. Just us cooks. The plongeur won't be coming to you for advice anymore, eh, Colette? He's gotten all he needs. Toasting your success, eh, Linguini? Good for you. I just took it to be polite. I don't really drink, you know. Of course you don't. I wouldn't either if I was drinking that. But you would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportions not to appreciate this '61 ChÃ¢teau Latour. And you, Monsieur Linguini, are no idiot. Let us toast your nonidiocy. Remy! Emile? I can't believe it! You're alive! You made it! I thought I'd never see you guys again! We figured you didn't survive the rapids. And what are you eating? I don't really know. I think it was some sort of wrapper once. What? No. You're in Paris now, baby. My town. No brother of mine eats rejectamenta in my town. Remy! You are stealing? You told Linguini he could trust you. And he can. It's for my brother. But the boy could lose his job. Which means I would, too. It's under control, okay? More wine? I shouldn't, but... Okay. So, where did you train, Linguini? Train? All right. Surely you don't expect me to believe this is your first time cooking? It's not. I knew it! It's my... Second, third, fourth... Fifth time. Monday was my first time. But I've taken out the garbage lots of times before that... Yes, yes. Have some more wine. Tell me, Linguini, about your interests. Do you like animals? What? Animals? What kind? The usual, dogs, cats, horses, guinea pigs, rats. I brought you something to... No, no, no, no! Spit that out right now! I have got to teach you about food. Close your eyes. Now take a bite of... No! No! No! Don't just hork it down! Too late. Here. Chew it slowly. Only think about the taste. See? Not really. Creamy, salty sweet, an oaky nuttiness. You detect that? Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness. Close your eyes. Now taste this. Whole different thing, right? Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish. Okay. Now, try them together. Okay. I think I'm getting a little something there. It might be the nuttiness. See? Could be the tang. That's it. Now, imagine every great taste in the world being combined into infinite combinations. Tastes that no one has tried yet! Discoveries to be made! I think... You lost me again. Yeah. But that was interesting. Most interesting garbage I ever... What are we doing? Dad doesn't know you're alive yet! We've got to go to the colony! Everyone will be thrilled! Yeah! But... What? Thing is, I kind of have to... What do you ""have to"" more than family? What's more important here? Well, I... It wouldn't hurt to visit. Have you had a pet rat? No. Did you work in a lab with rats? No. Perhaps you lived in squalor at some point? Nopety nopety no. You know something about rats! You know you do! You know who know do whackadoo. Rattatatta. Hey! Why do they call it that? What? Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right? Why do they call it that? If you're going to name a food, you should give it a name that sounds delicious. Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious. It sounds like ""rat"" and ""patootie."" Rat patootie. Which does not sound delicious. Regrettably we are all out of wine. My son has returned! And finding someone to replace you for poison checker has been a disaster. Nothing's been poisoned, thank God, but it hasn't been easy. You didn't make it easy. I know. I am sorry, Dad. Well, the important thing is that you're home. Yeah, well, about that... You look thin. Why is that? A shortage of food, or a surplus of snobbery? It's tough out there in the big world all alone, isn't it? Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore. Hey. Hey, boy. What's up? I can take care of myself. I've found a nice spot not far away, so I'll be able to visit often. Nothing like a cold splash of reality to make you... Visit? I will. I promise. Often. You're not staying? No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just... You didn't think I was going to stay forever, did you? Eventually, a bird's got to leave the nest. We're not birds. We're rats. We don't leave our nests. We make them bigger. Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat. Maybe you're not a rat at all. Maybe that's a good thing. Hey! The band's really on tonight, huh? Rats. All we do is take, Dad. I'm tired of taking. I want to make things. I want to add something to this world. You're talking like a human. Who are not as bad as you say. Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure? Oh, man. I've been able to observe them at a closeish sort of range. Yeah? How close? Close enough. And they're, you know, not so bad as you say they are. Come with me. I got something I want you to see. You know, I'm going to stay here. Make sure the floors and countertops are clean before you lock up. Wait. You want me to stay and clean? Is that a problem? No. Good boy. See you tomorrow. We're here. Take a good long look, Remy. Now, this is what happens when a rat gets a little too comfortable around humans. The world we live in belongs to the enemy. We must live carefully. We look out for our own kind, Remy. When all is said and done, we're all we've got. No. What? No. Dad, I don't believe it. You're telling me that the future is... Can only be more of this? This is the way things are. You can't change nature. Change is nature, Dad. The part that we can influence. And it starts when we decide. Where you going? With luck, forward. Hey! Yeah. Stop it. Good morning. Good morning. So, the chef, he invited you in for a drink? That's big. That's big. What did he say? What? What, you can't tell me? Forgive me for intruding on your deep, personal relationship with the chef. Oh, I see how it is. You get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks to dazzle the boss and then you blow past me? Wake up. Wake up. I thought you were different. I thought you thought I was different. I thought... I didn't have to help you! If I looked out only for myself, I would have let you drown! But... I wanted you to succeed. I liked you. My mistake. Colette. Wait, wait. Colette! It's over, Little Chef. I can't do it anymore. Colette! Wait, wait! Don't motorcycle away. Look, I'm no good with words. I'm no good with food either. At least not without your help. I hate false modesty. It's just another way to lie. You have talent. No, but I don't! Really! It's not me. When I added that extra ingredient instead of following the recipe like you said, that wasn't me either. What do you mean? I mean, I wouldn't have done that. I would've followed the recipe. I would've followed your advice. I would've followed your advice to the ends of the earth. Because I love your advice. But... But I... Don't do it. I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing. I have a... What? You... I have a... You have a rash? No, no, no. I have this... This tiny little... Little... A tiny chef who tells me what to do. A tiny chef? Yes. Yes. He's... He's up here. In your brain? Why is it so hard to talk to you? Okay. Here we go. You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all. I'm going to risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen. You want to know why I'm such a fast learner? You want to know why I'm such a great cook? Don't laugh! I'm going to show you! No! No! What is it, Ambrister? Gusteau's. Finally closing, is it? No. More financial trouble? No, it's... Announced a new line of microwave egg rolls? What? What? Spit it out. It's come back. It's popular. I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years. No, sir. My last review condemned it to the tourist trade. Yes, sir. I said, ""Gusteau has finally found his rightful place in history ""right alongside another equally famous chef, "" Monsieur Boyardee."" TouchÃ©. That is where I left it. That was my last word. The last word. Yes. Then tell me, Ambrister, how could it be popular? No, no, no, no, no, no, no! The DNA matches, the timing works, everything checks out. He is Gusteau's son. This can't just happen! The whole thing is a setup! The boy knows! Look at him out there, pretending to be an idiot. He's toying with my mind like a cat with a ball of... Something. String? Yes! Playing dumb. Taunting me with that rat. Rat? Yes. He's consorting with it. Deliberately trying to make me think it's important. The rat. Exactly! Is the rat important? Of course not! He just wants me to think that it is. Oh, I see the theatricality of it. A rat appears on the boy's first night, I order him to kill it. And now he wants me to see it everywhere. It's here! No, it isn't, it's here! Am I seeing things, am I crazy? Is there a phantom rat or is there not? But, oh, no! I refuse to be sucked into his little game of... Should I be concerned about this? About you? I can't fire him. He's getting attention. If I fire him now, everyone will wonder why. And the last thing I want is people looking into this. What are you so worried about? Isn't it good to have the press? Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name getting headlines? Not if they're over his face! Gusteau's already has a face, and it's fat and lovable and familiar. And it sells burritos! Millions and millions of burritos! The deadline passes in three days. Then you can fire him whenever he ceases to be valuable and no one will ever know. I was worried about the hair sample you gave me. I had to send them back to the lab. Why? Because the first time it came back identified as rodent hair. No, no, no. What? Try this. It's better. Well, because you... Rat! Disgusting little creatures. I was reminded how fragile it all was.  How the world really saw me.  And it just kept getting better.  Remy! Hey, hey, hey, little brother! We were afraid you weren't going to, you know, show up. Hey, Remy! How you doing? You told them? Emile, that's exactly what I said not to do! But you know these guys. They're my friends. I didn't think you meant them. Look, I'm sorry. Don't tell me you're sorry, tell them you're sorry. Is there a problem over here? No, there is not. Wait here. It's locked? Remy, what are you doing in here? Okay. Emile shows up with... Okay, I said not to. I told him... He goes and blabs to... Yeah, it's a disaster. Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe is locked and I need the key. They want you to steal food? Yes. No! It's... It's complicated. It's family. They don't have your ideals. Ideals? If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals, you think I'd be hawking barbecue over here? Or microwave burritos? Or, Tooth, I say, Tooth Pick'n Chicken? About as French as a corn dog! Coming soon! We're inventing new ways to sell out over here. Will ye be wanting some haggis bites? I cannot control how they use my image, Remy. I am dead! Can you guys shut up? I've got to think! Word's getting out. If I can't keep them quiet, the entire clan's gonna be after me with their mouths open and... Here it is. Hey. Your will! Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I... Not at all. Linguini? Why would Linguini be filed with your will? This used to be my office. He's your son? I have a son? How could you not know this? I am a figment of your imagination. You did not know, how could I? Well, your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant! No! No! The rat! Sorry, chef. The rat! It's stolen my documents! It's getting away! Hey, Mr. Chef! You! Get out of my office. He's not in your office. You are in his. Bottoms up, Linguini! Cheers, ja . Chef! Chef! Chef Linguini! Your rise has been meteoric, yet you have no formal training. What is the secret to your genius? Secret? You want the truth? I am Gusteau's son. It's in my blood I guess. But you weren't aware of that fact until very recently. No. And it resulted in your taking ownership of this restaurant. How did you find out? Well, some part of me just knew. The Gusteau part? Where do you get your inspiration? Inspiration has many names. Mine is named Colette. What? Something's stuck in my teeth. Health Inspector. I wish to report a rat infestation. It's taken over my... Gusteau's restaurant. Gusteau's, eh?  I can drop by. Let's see. First opening is three months. It must happen now! It's a gourmet restaurant!  Monsieur , I have the information. If someone cancels, I'll slot you in. But the rat! You must... It stole my documents. It's past opening time. He should have finished an hour ago. Bonjour, ma chÃ©rie.  Join us. We were just talking about my inspiration. Yes, he calls it his tiny chef. Not that, dearest. I meant you. It's him. Ego? Anton Ego! Is that Ego? I can't believe it. You are Monsieur Linguini? Hello. Pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration, but I thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game. Game? Yes. And you've been playing without an opponent. Which is, as you may have guessed, against the rules. You're Anton Ego. You're slow for someone in the fast lane. And you're thin for someone who likes food. I don't like food. I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow. I will return tomorrow night with high expectations. Pray you don't disappoint me. Listen, we hate to be rude, but we're French, and it's dinnertime. She meant to say, ""It's dinnertime and we're French."" Don't give me that look. You were distracting me in front of the press. How am I supposed to concentrate with you yanking on my hair all the time? And that's another thing. Your opinion isn't the only one that matters here. Colette knows how to cook, too, you know. All right, that's it! You take a break, Little Chef. I'm not your puppet, and you're not my puppetcontrolling guy! The rat is the cook. You cool off and get your mind right, Little Chef. Ego is coming, and I need to focus! You stupid... Wow. I have never seen that before. Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny or something. I'm sorry, Remy. I know there are too many guys. I tried to limit... You know what? It's okay. I've been selfish. You guys hungry? Are you kidding? All right. Dinner's on me. We'll go after closing time. In fact... Yeah. ...tell Dad to bring the whole clan. Little Chef? This is great, Son. An inside job. I see the appeal. Little Chef? Little Chef? Hey, Little Chef. I thought you went back to the apartment. Then when you weren't there, I don't know... It didn't seem right to leave things the way that we did, so... Look, I don't want to fight. I've been under a lot of, you know, pressure. A lot has changed in not very much time, you know? I'm suddenly a Gusteau. And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know, people will be disappointed. It's weird. You know, I've never disappointed anyone before, because nobody's ever expected anything of me. And the only reason anyone expects anything from me now is because of you. I haven't been fair to you. You've never failed me, and I should never forget that. You've been a good friend. The most honorable friend a guy could ever ask... What is this? What's going on? Hey... You're... You're stealing food? How could you? I thought you were my friend! I trusted you! Get out! You and all your rat buddies! And don't come back or I'll treat you the way restaurants are supposed to treat pests! You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding? We are what we are, and we're rats. Well, he'll leave soon, and now you know how to get in. Steal all you want. You're not coming? I've lost my appetite. Do you know what you would like this evening, sir? Yes, I'd like your heart roasted on a spit. Come in! Today's the big day. You should say something to them. Like what? You are the boss. Inspire them. Attention. Attention, everyone. Tonight is a big night. Appetite is coming, and he's going to have a big ego. I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic. And he's going to order something. Something from our menu. And we'll have to cook it, unless he orders something cold. Just can't leave it alone, can you? You really shouldn't be here during restaurant hours. It's not safe. I'm hungry! And I don't need the inside food to be happy. The key, my friend, is to not be picky. Observe. No, wait! Oh, no! No, no! What do we do? I'll go get Dad. You might think you are a chef but you are still only a rat. Sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place. Sure it probably killed... Dad. This is very bad juju right here. But I'll tell you one thing... Ego is here. Ego? He is here? Anton Ego is just another customer. Let's cook! Yeah! Let's... Okay. So I have in mind a simple arrangement. You will create for me a new line of Chef Skinner frozen foods. And I, in return, will not kill you. Au revoir, rat! Do you know what you would like this evening, sir? Yes, I think I do. After reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook, you know what I'm craving? A little perspective. That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear, well seasoned perspective. Can you suggest a good wine to go with that? With what, sir? Perspective. Fresh out, I take it? I am... Very well. Since you're all out of perspective and no one else seems to have it in this bloody town, I'll make you a deal. You provide the food, I'll provide the perspective. Which would go nicely with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947. I'm afraid I... Your dinner selection? Tell your Chef Linguini that I want whatever he dares to serve me. Tell him to hit me with his best shot. I will have whatever he is having. So, we have given up. Why do you say that? We are in a cage inside the car trunk awaiting a future in frozen food products. No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up. You are free. I am only as free as you imagine me to be. As you are. Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending. I pretend to be a rat for my father. I pretend to be a human through Linguini. I pretend you exist so I have someone to talk to! You only tell me stuff I already know! I know who I am! Why do I need you to tell me? Why do I need to pretend? But you don't, Remy. You never did. No. My other left! Dad? Dad, I'm in here! I'm inside the trunk! What the... Dad! Hey, little brother! Emile! I love you guys! Where are you going? Back to the restaurant. They'll fail without me. Why do you care? Because I'm a cook! It's your recipe. How can you not know your own recipe? I didn't write it down. It just came to me. Then make it come to you again, ja ? Because we can't serve this! Where's my order? Can't we serve something else? Something I didn't invent? This is what they're ordering. Make them order something else. Tell them we're all out. We cannot be all out. We just opened. I have another idea. What if we serve them what they order! We will make it. Just tell us what you did. I don't know what I did. We need to tell the customers something. Then tell them... Tell them... Don't do it. Remy. Remy. Don't! Stop! They'll see you. Stop. We're not talking about me. We're talking about what to do right... Rats! Remy! Get my knife. Don't touch him! Thanks for coming back, Little Chef. I know this sounds insane, but... Well, the truth sounds insane sometimes. But that doesn't mean it's not the truth. And the truth is, I have no talent at all. But this rat, he's the one behind these recipes. He's the cook. The real cook. He's been hiding under my toque. He's been controlling my actions. He's the reason I can cook the food that's exciting everyone. The reason Ego is outside that door. You've been giving me credit for his gift. I know it's a hard thing to believe. But, hey, you believed I could cook, right? Look, this works. It's crazy, but it works. We can be the greatest restaurant in Paris, and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef, can lead us there. What do you say? You with me? Dad. Dad, I don't know what to say. I was wrong about your friend and about you. I don't want you to think I'm choosing this over family. I can't choose between two halves of myself. I'm not talking about cooking. I'm talking about guts. This really means that much to you? We're not cooks, but we are family. You tell us what to do, and we'll get it done. Stop that health inspector! Delta Team, go, go, go, go! The rest of you stay and help Remy. Team three will be handling fish. Team four, roasted items. Team five, grill. Team six, sauces. Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go! Those handling food will walk on two legs. We need someone to wait tables. I'm sorry for any delay, but we're a little short tonight. Please, take all of the time you need. He came in late one more time and all of a sudden he... Make sure that steak is nice and tenderized. Work it. Yeah. Stick and move. Stick and move. Easy with that sole meuniÃ¨re. Less salt. More butter. Only use the mimolette cheese. Whoa! Compose the salad like you were painting a picture. Not too much vinaigrette on that salade composÃ©e. Don't let that beurre blanc separate. Keep whisking. Gently poach the scallops. Taste check. Spoons down. Good. Too much salt. Good. Don't boil the consommÃ©, it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile! Sorry. Colette, wait! Colette. You came back. Colette... Don't say a word. If I think about it, I might change my mind. Just tell me what the rat wants to cook. Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish. Are you sure you want to serve this to Ego? What? I am making ratatouille. Well, how would you prepare it? Ratatouille? They must be joking. No, it can't be. Who cooked the ratatouille? I demand to know! I can't remember the last time I asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef. And now I find myself in the extraordinary position of having my waiter be the chef. Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight. Then who do I thank for the meal? Excuse me a minute. You must be the chef... If you wish to meet the chef, you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone. So be it. At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.  But as Linguini explains, Ego's smile disappears.  He doesn't react beyond asking an occasional question.  And when the story is done, Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...  Thank you for the meal. ...and leaves without another word.  The following day his review appears.  In many ways, the work of a critic is easy.  We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those  who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment.  We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.  But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things,  the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful  than our criticism designating it so.  But there are times when a critic truly risks something  and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.  The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations.  The new needs friends.  Last night, I experienced something new,  an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source.  To say that both the meal and its maker  have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking  is a gross understatement.  They have rocked me to my core.  In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain  for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, ""Anyone can cook.""  But I realize only now do I truly understand what he meant.  Not everyone can become a great artist,  but a great artist can come from anywhere.  It is difficult to imagine more humble origins  than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's,  who is, in this critic's opinion,  nothing less than the finest chef in France.  I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.  It was a great night. The happiest of my life.  But the only thing predictable about life is its unpredictability.  Well, we had to let Skinner and the health inspector loose,  and of course they ratted us out.  The food didn't matter.  Once it got out there were rats in the kitchen,  oh, man, the restaurant was closed  and Ego lost his job and his credibility. But don't feel too bad for him. He's doing very well as a small business investor. He seems very happy. How do you know? Got to go. Dinner rush. You know how he likes it. Thanks, Little Chef. Can I interest you in a dessert this evening? Don't you always? Which one would you like? Surprise me. Can I interest you in a dessert this evening? Hey, believe me, that story gets better when I tell it, okay? Come on. Bring some food over here, we're starving!"
Recess Schools Out,Disney,2000,2001,Animation," Hey, how's it going, Frank? Not so good. I can't seem to get this photon channeler working. Well, you'd better figure it out. The colonel wants to show the system to the top brass next month. I know, I know.   What was that? What's that sound out there?  It's a breakin! Erase the access code! XY4...     All clear. Neatly done, Fernlick. It's, uh, Fenwick, sir. Oh. Are they dead? No, sir. Merely unconscious. Good, good. You know how I hate violence. Mmm. Nice shine. Uh, what next, sir? Well, obviously, we establish our base. And where will that be? The last place on Earth they'd look. A place called... 3rd Street School. Last day of school sale, boys and girls. Get your celebratory contraband right here. Shaving cream, T.P., goofy string, maps of the teachers' houses. I'll take one of them maps, Hustler Kid. Hey, Diggers, let's party. Can't now. Gotta finish filling up our holes before the end of the day. Won't be able to dig 'em up next year if we don't fill 'em now.  Hey! Big kids bury me! Oops. I, King Bob, in my last official act before entering middle school, hereby anoint this boy here King Freddie the Second. May you boss around all of the kids with fairness. The king has graduated! Long live the king!   Elbow up! Eyes forward! You call that kazoo playing? Ah, ceremony. I'm, like, moved, Ashley A. Say what you want about their personal lives, Ashley Q. The royals have such style. Keep 'em comin'! Let's go! Ms. Finster, the kids are practically mad with lastdayofschool fever! Of course they are, Randall. They're animals living by pure instinct. I've got a list of infractions a mile long: The Diggers hit a water main, the kindergarteners are feasting on paste, Never mind, Randall. Hustler Kid is, uh... Did you say ""never mind""? That's right, Randall. What I've got here is bigger, much bigger. All this year I've been holding back on the ice cream, hiding it from all those little savages. Just look at it, Randall. I'm counting 100, maybe 200 cases of it. What are you going to do with all those ice creams? Sell 'em back to the district, of course. Think of all the chalk and erasers we can get. But, Ms. Finster, I've got dirt on everybody. Well, everybody except Detweiler and his pals. Come to think of it, I haven't seen those guys anywhere. Ah, forget about 'em, Randall. There's nothing T.j. Detweiler and his hooligan friends can do to stop me now. Well, that should do it. There's enough here for everyone. Good. Then it's party time. Kids of the playground! I give you ice cream! Pull!  Ice cream! Chocopops! Fudge bars! Fudgsicle! My ice cream! Stop it! Stop it, I say! You little monsters are in trouble now! just wait'll Principal Prickly finds out about this! Attention, students! This is Principal Prickly talking. Ooh, that was fast. Some of you may have noticed ice cream on the playground. I will not stand for this. This ice cream should be eaten immediately. Huh?  In addition, I want you all to ignore Ms. Finster, no matter what she says... about ice cream or anything else.  This can't be happening. Furthermore, I want to inform you all that I have a fat, saggy butt... which I like to scratch every hour on the hour. Also, I want to apologize to all of you... for being such a mean principal, taking away hall passes, giving guys recess detention, refusing to accept sick notes just 'cause it doesn't look like a guy's mom's signature, making kids stand at the wall for ten whole minutes, with no break! Man, I feel ashamed of myself for all the terrible, rotten things I've done. And next year, I promise to... Why, Principal Prickly, sir, what a surprise. Why do you do this to me, Detweiler? Do you enjoy tormenting me? Do you hate me? On the contrary, sir, I have the utmost respect for you. Don't be smart with me, boy. All year long you've been pushing me, testing me. I don't know what you mean, sir. Oh, really? How about the time you convinced the F.B.I. I was a Chinese agent and got me arrested? You were giving us a speech on personal hygiene. You had to be stopped. How about the time you forged my signature and ordered a motorboat for the school? It was for the kindergarteners. Owning a boat's always been kind of a dream of theirs. I've had enough of your pranks. This time I'm really gonna throw the book at you. With all due respect, sir, you'd better get throwing, 'cause you're out of time. Huh? It's the last day of school, sir. I've only got 20 more seconds of fourth grade left. Look. In some ways, people, this day is a bummer for me. But in other ways it's the ultimate high, because every milestone that you kids pass is another step towards... Uh, Miss Grotke? Yes, Spinelli? I don't mean to interrupt, but... Oh, yes! Be my guest.  Six, five, four, three, two, one...   Whoo! Whoohoo!  Yeah!  Scandalous! Calling out around the world Are you ready for a brandnew beat Summer's here You eat paste! You eat paste! And the time is right for dancin'in the street  Hey! No running in the halls! Yeah, what's the big deal? It's just the end of the school year. The end of the school year? Whoohoo! It doesn't matter what you wear Whoohoo!  Just as long as you are there Girls, what shall we do with the rest of this corn chowder? Aw, leave it in the kettle. It'll keep till September. They'll be dancing Dancing in the street They're dancin'in the street Dancing in the street See you next year, Principal Prickly. You'd better do some growing up this summer, young man.  I hate my job. There'll be laughin' singin' And records playin' Dancin'in the street Look at those hooligans. Actually, I think it's a wonderful expression of freedom and joy. I'll tell you a wonderful expression of freedom and joy. Twelve weeks of nothing but me at the West Side Golf Course, and no Detweiler. I second that emotion, sir. Man, Teej, that prank was sweet. Yeah, you should've seen Finster's face... I thought she was gonna blow a gasket. Those limesicles were tasty. A tasty beginning to a tasty summer. Twelve weeks of nothing but riding bikes, hanging out at the lake... and T.P.ing the West Side Golf Course. Summer vacation... The ultimate recess. Yeah, I can't wait to get to baseball camp. Baseball camp? What are you talking about? Actually, Teej, I'm gonna be out of town too. Bigtime Wrestling Federation has this training camp, and I gotta learn some new moves if I'm ever gonna turn pro. But, Spinelli... It's military camp for me. My dad says I need to learn to be a leader. I shall be attending the Mt. Van Buren Space Camp. Don't wanna let those science geeks get ahead of me. You're all going to camp? Not me. Thank goodness. The Young Voices Training Program doesn't like the word ""camp."" They provide opportunities for aspiring singers to train their voices... in a rigorous yet supportive setting. But summer's gonna be ruined. What am I gonna do? Play baseball by myself? Watch reruns? Read? Sorry, man, but we gotta think about our futures. Yeah, we can't waste the whole summer just fooling around like kids. But we are kids! Actually, as of the completion of fourth grade, we are technically considered preyoung adults. And next year we won't even be ""pre."" But...  All right, let's make the most of the time we've got left. When do you all leave? First thing in the morning. Oh, man.  Well, there's my bus. Better get going. Yeah, same here. Bye, Teej. Try to have some fun, okay? Don't worry, buddy. You'll have a great time without us. I don't know, Vince. All my plans were made for six. Don't tell me you Ashleys are going to baseball camp. Eeew! As if! Cheerleading camp is right across the lake. Duh! I hope it's a big lake.  Ah, space camp. Wonder if they'll let us make craters. Hey, Hustler Kid, I didn't know you wrestled. I don't. I'm premanagement. Besides, my research tells me that kids who wrestle trade the most for contraband snacks. Which reminds me... Wanna buy a WingerDinger? All right, all the kindergarten performers on the bus first.  Me Viking! Me Viking! Me Viking! Me Viking! Bon voyage...  T.j.  Big kid sing good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Teej, there's my transport. Why don't you come with? Military camp's gonna be a blast! Griswald, you maggot, get your fanny over here now! Thanks, Gus, but I think I'll stick it out at home this summer. Okay, but you don't know what you're missing. Hiya, Captain Brad! I don't like you, Griswald. I am not your friend! Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir! Not looking for friendship, sir! Good luck, Gus. You're gonna need it. Man, this summer's gonna whomp. One is the loneliest number That you'll ever do Two can be as bad as one It's the loneliest number since the number one  No is the saddest experience You'll ever know Yes, it's the saddest experience You'll ever know 'Cause one is the loneliest number That you'll ever do One is the loneliest number Whoaohh worse than two And so, the summer season officially begins... with kids all over the country rushing off to camp. In other news, the national No Recess movement... has hit a serious stumbling block... with the disappearance of its leader, former Secretary of Education Phillium Benedict. Benedict, fired by the president two years ago for his extremist views, has recently been... No recess? What a bunch of hogwash.  Morning, Mom. Morning, Dad. Are you just getting up now? Geez, you're sleeping away your whole vacation. Why don't you go play with your friends? What friends? The ones who abandoned me and went to camp? Now, T.j., I know there are other boys around this summer. Mrs. Ween says Randall is available. Do you want me to make a play date? A play date? Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Bye, Tjerk. Now, Becky, be nice to your little brother. He's feeling SAD right now. I can spell, Mom. Well, unlike some kids, I gotta get to work. Mr. Walsh says if I can master the Vatman 2000, I'll be assistant manager by the end of the summer, and you know what that means... I'll get to drive the Floppy Burger truck. Boy, she's sure aiming for the stars. At least she's not sitting around the house, moping all summer. Going to a play date with Randall. Man, I can't believe I sunk this low. This is the worst summer ever.  What the heck?  That's weird. Hey, you! Get away from that fence! Hey, Dad, what do they use the school for during the summer? They lock it up. It's empty. Why? Today, when I was riding by, I saw this scary guy and... I'm sure he was just cleaning up. I think something weird's going on in there... something really weird.  Mrs. La SALLE was right. We should've sent him to some kind of camp. 9:32 a.m. Ugly bald guy still guarding school.  Staging area one. Give me a hand with this. Got it. 9:32andahalf a.m. Grownups wrong. School's not empty.  9:32 and three quarters. Green glow in window again. I'm going in for a closer look.  All right, go ahead and elevate it.  Mom! Mom!  T.j.! Are you all right? Those guys at the school, they're doing some kind of evil experiment! That bonk on the head must've rattled your little brain. But, Mom... You're feverish. You wait right here. I'll go get the baby thermometer and the petroleum jelly. Uh, Dad, Dad! Dad! What is it, boy? Those bad guys have a laser beam and they're lifting this safe... T.j., did you run into the sliding glass door again? No, but... Yeah, but... Gaaah! Come back! Your mom's gonna want to take your temperature! Okay, kid, we got it all in the report. We'll take care of those mad scientists. Yeah, no one's gonna levitate any safe on my watch. Ooh, look, Artie, somebody's levitating my doughnut... with a laser beam!  Go home, kid! Go home! Laugh at me, will ya? I'm gonna be a taxpayer someday! Have a good round. Principal Prickly! Wait! Yeah, you guys did it right. Psychology, law, waste management... Good, solid careers. Me, I'm stuck with a bunch of painintheneck kids all year. Pete, are you gonna putt or grouse all day? Okay, okay, here goes. Principal Prickly! Ohh! You gotta come quick! It's an emergency! Well, well, well, if it isn't Mr. Ice Cream For Everyone. This is that kid I was telling you about. The ""saggy butt"" kid? Hey, hey, whatever happened to doctorpatient confidentiality? Sorry. Something weird's going on in the school. I saw these mad scientists and... Yeah, yeah, very funny. I'm not falling for another one of your socalled jokes. How dumb do you think I am? It's not a joke, sir. They have this laser beam, and... Aw, please, Principal Prickly, you gotta believe me! The school's in danger! Give me a break, Detweiler. Come on. Go with the kid, Pete. This isn't the kind of issue you should be avoiding.  All right, Detweiler, let's get this over with. Looks fine to me. Now can I go back to my golf game? Just wait till you get inside. You'll see. Oh, the things I do for you kids. Sometimes I think you were put on this Earth just to... Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!  11:57 a.m. Principal Prickly dematerialized... in a horrifying field of electricity. The cops won't listen. Mom and Dad won't listen. I gotta get the guys together. It's the only way. Like, I am so through with him, Melissa. He asked me if I spoke French, then winked at me. Becky, you gotta help me! I need a ride up to Chesterville! Are you kidding? I'm not doing anything for you, you little dork. ""Oh, how I dream of the mustache fuzz on jimmy's sweaty lips... glistening as he cooks in the light of a dozen hamburger heat lamps."" Hey, that's my diary! Give me that! Ahahah. I've got copies. Either you give me a ride, or this baby hits the Internet. Get your motor runnin' Head out on the highway Thanks for driving me, Becky. You're the sweetest big sister a kid could ask for. And you are the annoying pet monkey I wish I never got! Hey, I try to keep things interesting. Next rest stop, pull in. I gotta take care of business. Get that front leg up, Biggles. You call that a pitch, Hornsby? Come on, La SALLE! Throw it, don't aim it! I know, I know! Man, I can pitch just fine when I'm with my friends. Psst! Psst! T.j., what are you doing here? You gotta come back to town. It's an emergency. What? I can't just leave. Something weird is going on at school. Principal Prickly got dematerialized. Dematerialized? T.j., you're crazy. Am I? Mt. Van Buren? That's 20 miles away. I'm not taking you there. ""Dear Diary, I dreamed of jimmy again. He was rocking me so gently, just like he rocks the grease off a basket of hot and steamy onion rings.""  Whoa! Let me look at that. Jerks. Hey, you kids! Get away from that fake Martian landscape! Miss Director! Miss Director! What is it now, Gretchen? I've been studying the moon with the 200inch telescope at the observatory, and I've detected some peculiar eccentricities in its orbit. Gretchen, maybe you should try out one of these neat anti gravity harnesses. The other kids love 'em, and look, you can even do back flips, just like real astronauts. But...  Why do I bother? Because you're driven by a passionate desire for knowledge? T.j.? Vince? What are you guys doing here? You're not gonna believe this, but... Dematerialized? Just like out of Star Trek. Fascinating. Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, mi...  Me? Look out, marshals! Here comes the flying press!  You are a pathetic excuse for a soldier, Griswald! You will never be a leader! Now, stand at attention until I return! And do not move a muscle! Do you hear me? Not a muscle! Thanks a lot, sis. You owe me gas money. Okay, Teej, what's this big secret plot of yours? Follow me. Look at that. Let's get movin' out. Who are those guys? Perhaps they're government agents. Or gangsters. Or aliens. Aliens? They don't look like aliens. Well, maybe they're in disguise. Yeah, if you were an alien, you wouldn't just walk around in your lizard skin all day. Hmm. Good point. Whoever they are, we need to take a closer look. We'll get the rest later. Right. I'll close it up. Hurry. Man, this thing weighs a ton. That's 'cause it's full of moon rocks and alien eggs. Hey, it's just a bunch of paper. Weather maps? Test scores? Some stuff written in Swedish? Actually, that's Norwegian. Whatever. It's all just dumb school stuff. You got me out of baseball camp to watch some guys restock the supply room? No! Something's going on in the school! I swear! Teej, I think you cooked this whole thing up just 'cause you wanted us back from camp. What? Hey, we understand. It must be pretty boring around here all summer by yourself. Your mind simply created an adventure because it needed some excitement. No, it really happened. I saw Prickly disappear. Well, if Prickly disappeared, then who's that? Come on, guys. Let's get back to camp. Yeah. See ya in a few weeks, Teej. No, wait! You guys gotta believe me! I'm not making it up! I... I...  AyeYiYi, YiYi.  Whoa! What's happening?  Okay, that right there? That was messed up.  Mikey? Mikey, you okay? WWhere am I? You're in T.j.'s backyard, man. How'd you guys get me here? Hey, this is kinda comfy. Yeah, yeah. Get out of there, you big lummox. Okay, Teej, you were right. Something weird is going on in the school. And Prickly must be in on it. I say we go to the police. I already went to the police. I went to everyone. Nobody'll listen. What we need is proof. Proof? How are we gonna get proof? I got a plan. A stakeout. A stakeout? We can stay up in my tree house and watch the school every night until something happens. Like one of them TV cop shows. Sure. The next time those laser guys make a move, we'll catch 'em redhanded. We can take pictures with my nightvision digital cam. Then we call in the feds and, bang, we got 'em. Only one problem... What about camp? Oh, yeah. If my dad finds out I've gone AWOL, he'll throw me in the brig till September. Not to worry. I'll get Becky to drive you back to camp in the morning. Then at night we'll pick you up again. Campers by day, spies by night. But what if the camp counselors notice we're not there? Leave that to me. Call for you, sir. Give me that. Captain Brad here. Bradley. This is Colonel O'Malley. Colonel O'Malley? Your commanding officer! Oh! Yes, sir! Sorry, sir! I hear you've got a soldier there named Griswald. Good man. One of the best. HHe is? You heard me! He's officer material. I've had my eyes on him for years. Now, pay attention, Bradley. I've got Griswald on special assignment tonight. When he gets back to camp, act like nothing's happened. Yes, sir! And you'd better start making his bed and spitshining his shoes as well. That's all for now. Carry on. Okay, Spinelli, you're next. Someone's wrestling My Lord Kumbayah Heads are smashing My Lord  Kumbayah Speak to me. Bones are cracking, My Lord Yeah? Yeah? I'll cover for you, Spinelli, but it's gonna cost you. Kumbayah Oh, like, that is such the wrong color for Vince. Put the blue one on. Ashley A, you totally know how to accessorize.   Infrared night vision, 200to1 zoom. I gotta hand it to you, Gretch. You can see the whole school with this thing. You can make lots of handy devices out of the spare parts in a family's garage. I once fashioned a particle accelerator... out of a broken hair dryer and a fourslice toaster oven. ""Tonight, the magical moment arrived. We met behind the drivethru menu and kissed passionately... as the sound of the deep fat fryer faded into the night."" Man, I wish I had an older sister. Laugh if you will. I think it's beautiful. Sorry I'm late, guys, but I had to wait till my mom and dad fell asleep... before I could sneak out with... the goodies. Roast beef and mashed potatoes! My favorite! Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. I also managed to swipe this. Rocky Road! My other favorite! Hey, give me some of that. Excuse me, but aren't we supposed to eat dinner before dessert? Good one, Gretch. You were right, Teej. This is the life. Hanging out with friends, eating ice cream, spying on bad guys. It's the ultimate kid experience. Too bad these days are numbered. Yeah, this is probably the last summer... we'll get to do stuff like this. Kinda whomps, huh? Hey, remember that summer after second grade... when we went down to the pond every day to catch minnows? Or how about that summer we all carved our initials in that tree in the Wilsons' backyard? And Spinelli spelled hers wrong. Hey, I was seven. And S's are tricky.  What's your problem? This is the first summer you've lived here. I know, and I'll never have any of those memories.  Know what I'll never forget? That song T.j.'s sister taught us... the first summer after kindergarten. Oh, yeah. Back when she was nice. How'd it go again?   John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt His name is my name too  Whenever I go out The people always shout There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt  NaNaNaNa, NaNaNa John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt His name is my name too Whenever I go out the people always shout There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt NaNaNaNa NaNaNa  John Jacobjingleheimer Schmidt His name is my name too Whenever I go out The people always shout There goes JohnJacob Jingleheimer Schmidt  NaNaNaNa, NaNaNa  Well, here we are, sir. But it's just an old principal's office. Why is it so important? Because, my academically challenged young friend, it used to be mine. 10:41 a.m. Gang back at camp. I'm goin' in alone.  Man, oh, man. I've heard of simple assignments, but this one takes the cake. Yuck. Hey. 10:43 a.m. I found what appear to be... Principal Prickly's golf pants? Fact is, you're gettin' real good at this stuff. Yeah, you're a regular Robert De Niro. Hey, I'm a man of many talents. Principal Prickly? But wasn't Mrs. Prickly suspicious? You kiddin'? It was like taking candy from a baby.  Doubleknit polyester. These are Prickly's all right. But why would the bald guy wanna pretend to be Principal Prickly? And where's the real Principal Prickly anyway? Wait a minute. There's something in here. ""Help me?"" It sounds like a desperate cry for help. Then Principal Prickly must still be in the school. Being held captive! You know what that means, don't you, guys? We gotta go in there and save him. Bikes? Check. Walkietalkie? Check. Rope with pointy thing? Check. Good. Then let's go. I still say this is nuts. Breaking out of the school I understand, but breaking in? Oh, boy! Ms. Finster's gonna love this.     Dang. Ten more minutes, and the pizza would've been free.  It's 9:00 at night, Randall. What do you want? It's about T.j. Detweiler. Randall, I'm off duty until Labor Day. He's someone else's problem now. But he's got all his friends together, and they're planning to break into the school! A breakin, eh? Not if Muriel P. Finster has anything to say about it. Told you, Ms. Finster.  I wonder if I can get 'em tried as adults. Come on. Hold the rope, boy.  Uhoh.  Aaaah!   Ms. Finster, could you please get off of me?  My, this is somewhat creepy. Yeah. I've never been in a empty school at night before. Heck, I'll bet no kid has. I wonder where the aliens went. They probably go back to the mother ship at night. Quick. In here.  Hey, this is our old room. I hope somebody's feeding the gerbil.  Shh! I hear something! I want this system working now. Do you hear me? Now! We're doing our best, sir. We've just run into a few technical difficulties. It's coming from up there. Like what? I think what Dr. Lazenby is trying to say... Oh, I know what he's trying to say. He's trying to... What are you doing? Finding out what's what.  Bingo.  I'm stuck.  Curse these bodacious hips of mine. Randall, run back to my place and get the butter. Do you have any idea who you're talking to, Laramie? It's Lazenby... That photon channeler is a piece of equipment, like a carburetor in your car! You're supposed to be a brilliant thinker. Do you know what brilliant thinkers are supposed to do? They're supposed to think! Whoa, what is all this stuff? Well, against the far wall is what looks to be a plutonium turbine. Closer ahead, you'll observe a global electrode. To your right is the laser device we saw earlier, and of course, that glowing orb... An electron pulse generator. The nerve center of the system. Shh! The bad guys are talking. But, Dr. Benedict, please... No, let me make this clear to you, Lazenby. We have a thing called a window of opportunity. If we miss the window of opportunity, then the project fails. And if the project fails, then I get very, very... angry! ThThey may have a point, sir. It seems the logistical problems are a bit more complicated than Dr. Steinheimer thought. Yes, it would be a lot easier if we could move the laser to a more appropriate location. This operation will be executed as planned from right here! Have I made myself clear? But, sir... No buts! It started at 3rd Street. It is going to end at 3rd Street. Dr. Benedict, we're ready for the test. Coming.  Levels are good. Ready? I've been ready for decades. Just do it. Yes, sir. Initiate photon channeling. Photon channeling initiated. Set magnification coordinates .073. Coordinates set. Engage tractor beam now.   What are those kids up to in there?  A little more. A little more. He's shooting at the moon. I told you they weren't aliens.  Dr. Rosenthal, why did the beam suddenly... Oh, what's the technical word for it? Stop? WWell, uh, as I believe you were told before... ""Told before""?  Do you think I care what I was told before? I'll do better next time. ""Next time."" Isn't that cute. Rosenthal, let me ask you something. Say you were a teacher... Or even better, say, the principal of a school... And you had to deal with a naughty child who didn't know his place, who kept telling you over and over that he'd do better ""next time."" But he never did. What would you do? Oh, no. NNot detention. Not detention! Take him away! No, please! I can fix it! Don't do this to meee! All right, who's secondincommand? Uh, I am, sir. Well, good. Now you're in charge. And if I were you, I'd make sure I had this machine working at full power by tomorrow morning. Do I make myself clear? YYes, sir. Oh, dear, I got spittle on my lapel. Mmm. We gotta get out of here. Uhoh. What is it? I got that feeling. Hold it in, big guy. Hold it in! I can't!  What was that? Someone had better say ""excuse me.""  Whoa! Fenwick, who let children into the school? UUh, nnot me, sir. Well, get them! Run!  There they are!  Huh? Get off our planet, alien scum!  Over there! Get 'em! Get 'em! Come back here! Huh? Whoa!  Hyah! Ninjas! Hyah! Get 'em! Ninjas! Why'd they have to be ninjas?  This way! Hurry! Go! Go! Let's go! Hurry up! Go! Go! Hurry up! Now you! But, Teej... Go! Haaah!  Save yourselves! T.j.! T.j.! It won't budge!   What the J.P. Morgan is going on around here? Let me go. Let me go! I'm warning you! I'm a black belt in origami! Well, well, well, if it ain't the little snoop. What? I ain't no snoop.  9:32 a.m. Ugly bald guy still guarding school. Hehheh. Oops. Let's go, snoop. You're in big trouble now. Ow! Ow! Watch the jacket! It's cotton!  Principal Prickly! You're alive! Oww! Would you be careful! Boy, am I glad to see you. You won't believe what these guys are doing. They've got this big laser gun and... Whoa, who took your pants? Never mind, Detweiler. just untie me. These knots are tight. Of course. I've been pulling at them for the last day and a half. They've chaffed my wrist. Don't worry, sir. My pals'll get us out of here. What makes you so sure? You don't know my friends. They'll get help. You'll see. So you're saying you just escaped from a troop of ninja warriors? That's right! And they got a giant laser gun in the school auditorium? Precisely! Which is aimed at the moon? Thank heavens you understand!  I've almost got it. Careful, Detweiler. That's my putting hand.  Hello, Pete. Remember me? Well, well, if it isn't Phillium Benedict. I should've known you'd be the one behind this. You know this guy? Ah, Pete and I are old pals. Although the last time we saw each other, Pete was the one ruining my life. By the way, Pete, you like this suit? It's Italian. Raw silk. Nice, huh? You always were more concerned about appearances than people, Phil. Oh, Pete, come on. There's no need to be rude. Not after I instructed my men to take such special care of you. Special care? That's what you call gagging me, tying me up and taking away my pants? Had to. Otherwise, you might run off and betray me, like you did the last time. But, hey, look at the bright side. At least you've got company now. Let the boy go. He can't do anything to you.  Same old noble Pete. Always standing up for the rights of children. You? But, unfortunately, I can't let anybody go right now. You see, this experimental, um, night school that I'm running is kind of a secret. I'm trying to show that my...  adult students can be trained... to be capable and productive members of society. Well, if you're just running a night school, then what's that giant laser gun doing in the auditorium? What a rude and badly dressed little boy you are. You should teach your pupils a little respect for their superiors, Pete. But that would mean that you'd have to know how to teach them anything at all, wouldn't it? Geez, how do you know that jerk? We went through teacher training together. You mean... That's right, Detweiler. That man is a rogue teacher.  It was back in the spring of'68. A different age. We were all young, idealistic and ready to change the world.   Oh! Ha ha ha. Peace, Peter. Hey, Muriel, had a groovy time at the Dead concert last night. You gonna be at the teachin Saturday? We're gonna paint my Volkswagen. Wouldn't miss it for the world. Groovy. Yes, we all thought we were pretty cool. But one guy was the coolest of us all.  Phillium Benedict was my best friend. He was smart, he was handsome. He had just been named principal of 3rd Street School.  So, Phillium, how's it feel being the youngest principal in the history of the state? Copacetic, baby. I mean, you know what they say: Young is in, man, and old is out. Way out. Do you like the American flag helmet, Pete? It does go with the leather jacket, right? You are one groovy educator, Phil. Cool. Follow me, my man. I wanna show you my new principal's pad. Whoa! Psychedelic principalia. Pull up a bag, bro. I wanna rap. Lay it on me, man. You see, Pete, I been thinkin'. We're a new generation of teachers, right? It's time we shook things up a little. I hear you, brother. In fact, dig this. I was meditating to that new Ravi Shankar album last night... when I got this righteous notion... What if we hold all our classes outside, on the playground? Imagine... school, recess. No boundaries. Hey, baby, that's a hip idea, but I got a better thought here. As my first official act as principal, I've decided... to get rid of recess. What? No recess? But, Phil, for a kid, recess is like a major playin. It's the one time of day they have any freedom.  Look, Pete, the '60s are over. All that peace and love and freedom stuff, it was great for pickin' up chicks, but it's not gonna help my career. To do that, I gotta make test scores go up, and to make test scores go up, I gotta keep kids in class where they belong. That's why, starting tomorrow, I am tuning out recess... once and for all.  Needless to say, Phillium's plan didn't go over all that well.  What do we want? Recess! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? When do we want it? Recess! Now! Be cool, people, be cool. You're bumming my mellowness. We'll be cool when you give our kids their recess back. Hey, baby, I'll do what I want. I'm principal of the school, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Dig?   It's not right! People, people, please calm down.  Mr. Prickly here has informed me of this ""no recess"" proposal. Let me assure you that as long as I'm superintendent, this radical plan will never be carried out in this district.  Hey, man, you just don't get it! Of course I do, Benedict. That's why I'm replacing you. What? Prickly, from now on, you will be principal. Who, me? Oh, I see what's going down here. You tricked me, went around my back to the man to get my job! No, Phil, it's not like that at all. Yeah, right! Come on, Muriel baby, let's blow this scene. No, Phil, it's over. I could never be with a man who doesn't love recess. So you're against me too. Well, fine. I don't need you. I don't need anyone! Aaah! Phil! You okay, man? Don't touch me! You took my chick. You took my job. Well, enjoy it while you can, Petey boy, 'cause you're gonna pay. Somehow, someway, you're gonna pay. I never saw Phillium again. He quit teaching, went into politics, eventually became secretary of education... Until the president fired him for trying to get rid of recess again. Only this time it was nationwide. So that guy's some weirdo exteacher who wants to get rid of recess? Mmhmm. Okay. Now it's personal. Let's see... weather maps, some stuff in Norwegian, a Farmer's Almanac. Must be something in here that'll explain what that Dr. Benedict is doing. I'll tell you one thing he's not doing... Having lunch tomorrow at 12:22 with his little girlfriend. Spinelli, that's the man's personal date book. Well, it's mine now, and I guess Miss Luna Pergum is gonna be at the restaurant all by herself. Who did you say? The girl whose name is in here... Luna Pergum. Must be some Italian chick. Lunae Perigeum. Of course! What are you talking about? Don't you understand? Lunae Perigeum is no lady. It's an event. Look. Once a month, the moon reaches the point where it's closest to the Earth... Lunar perigee, which in this case happens to be 12:22 tomorrow afternoon. Maybe that's when that doctor guy is gonna shoot his laser at the moon and blow it up. Close guess, but I have another theory. When I was up at space camp, I observed some abnormalities in the moon's position. I couldn't figure out what was causing it, but now it all makes sense. Dr. Benedict's device is not a laser beam at all. It's a tractor beam! You mean he's gonna plow the moon's surface? Whatever will he plant? Not a tractor, you goombah. A tractor beam. Like from a science fiction movie. Precisely. Theoretically, if a powerful tractor beam... were shot at the moon exactly at lunar perigee, it could move the moon into another orbit. Move the moon? But why would anybody want to do that? Who knows, Vince? Who knows?  Here we are, sir. I can't believe you have been creeping around in these vents. They're school property. Dang! The line's dead. Hey, what did you do with the walkietalkie you confiscated from me last week? Top drawer, on the right. Just look what Phil's done to my office. I had it all nice and clean for the summer. Packs of gum, yoyos, my old baseball... Hey, I've been looking for this. Here it is... My walkietalkie. Now all I gotta do is contact the guys and... Oh, no. What is it, Detweiler? I told 'em that guy was a nut. Hello! Hello! Is anybody there? It's T.j.! T.j., buddy, you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine, and so is Principal Prickly. Principal Prickly? I don't have time to explain, but I think we've figured out what Benedict is up to. He's trying to get rid of summer vacation! No! Guys, don't freak out on me! I got a plan! All we do is... Hehheh. Why, Mr. Bald Guy, what a surprise. T.j.! T.j.! It's dead! They must've got him! What are we gonna do? There's only one thing we can do: we gotta get help. Bowwow! Welcome to Floppy Burger. May I take your order, please? Becky, this is Vince. What are you doing here? It's not just Vince, it's me, Gretchen, everybody. We got a problem! I got a problem too... six dweeby tenyearolds who won't leave me alone, even when I'm at work. I am a professional! So whatever your little problem is, forget it! But it's about T.j. He's in trouble, and he needs your help.  Well, isn't that nice? After stealing my diary, threatening to put it on the Internet... and making me drive across the state three times, he needs my help? Give me one good reason why I should help him. 'Cause he's your little brother, and he needs you. Please pull forward to the second drivethru window. A confiscated walkietalkie. Why do you do these things? Do you enjoy tormenting me? Do you hate me? I don't hate you, Phil. I just think you're insane.  Insane. Well, there you go again, Pete. Insulting me, hurting my feelings, just like 30 years ago. Only this time, Petey, I'm ready. You see, all those years, no matter how big I got, no matter how successful, I always thought about you. How you embarrassed me! How you humiliated me! How you destroyed my relationship with Muriel Finster, the only woman I ever loved! That part still grosses me out, sir. Shh. This time, Pete, I'm gonna humiliate you. I'm gonna prove to the world that you were wrong and I was right. About what? About recess! About freedom! About test scores! I've found a way to prove my theory. I'm gonna get rid of the biggest recess of them all. I am gonna get rid of summer vacation. You fiend! ""Fiend."" Try to help people, that's the thanks you get. It'll never work, Phil. Well, actually, Pete, that's where you're wrong. You see, all I have to do is modify the moon's orbit ever so slightly, and tide levels on the Eastern Seaboard rise eight feet. Move the moon over here, and the currents that warm California suddenly become icecold. Summer, as we know it, will become a thing of the past. And without summer,  no summer vacation. You'll never get away with this, Benedict. Oh, yeah? Well, who's gonna stop me? Wow, I can't believe my little brother... actually stumbled on a real, live evil conspiracy. That's our Theodore. You should see the crates of soda they left back there. And boxes of mustard and ketchup too. Mmm, tomatoey. Hey, that's stuff's the property of Floppy Burger International. Quit your gabbin' and step on it. We need reinforcements.   I'm telling you, a troop of ninja warriors... is using 3rd Street School as a secret jujitsu training ground. Ninja warriors. Elementary school.  Jujitsu training ground? Hey, lady, aren't you forgetting the magic laser beam? I'm serious! So are we. Hey, I got an idea... Why don't you go home, get some rest... and we'll make a personal call to Jackie Chan. Yeah, he's the perfect man for a job like this. I'm telling ya, something is going on in that school! Help! Help! Somebody get us outta here! Calm down, Detweiler. Calm down? We're locked in a giant birdcage while a madman's trying to destroy summer vacation, and you want me to calm down? I understand, but I... How can you understand? You're just a grownup. What do you know about summer vacation? I'll let you in on a little secret, Detweiler. Every adult you've ever known was a kid some time in his life. You think we don't remember summer vacation? Riding bikes by the creek? Catching polliwogs in a jar? Camping out under the stars? Well, you're wrong. Some days I sit in my office, looking out at you kids on the playground, and I think, ""They don't know how good they've got it. In a few years, they're all going to be grownups, like me, and all those good times will just be memories for them too."" So go ahead, put a whoopee cushion in my chair, cover my carpet with fake vomit, make fun of my big, saggy butt. But don't you ever say I don't care about summer vacation, 'cause those memories are the last part of childhood I've got left. Principal Prickly, I had no idea. Yeah, well, now you do. So let's stop messing around. How did you get those keys? Swiped 'em off Phillium's desk when he wasn't looking. Now come on. We've got a summer vacation to save.  People! People! Just quiet down for a moment! Oh, man, nobody's listening. They'll listen to me, once I introduce them to my good friend Madam Fist. Come on, Spinelli. That's your answer for everything. I don't see you coming up with any great ideas, sports boy. Listen to the two of you. You're not helping at all.   Quiet! What we need is a leader. A kid with the right training. A kid who knows strategy and field tactics. A kid who commands respect. Yeah, but where we gonna find a kid like that? Leave that to me.   Please! We have to get organized. Ah, what's the use? If what you say is true, all the fun of being a kid is, like, totally ruined anyway. It's like the whole world's been turned right side up.  Not necessarily. All we have to do is work together and come up with a plan. Detweiler's the one who always comes up with the plans. Let's face it... we're doomed.  That's what you think! Kids of the playground, meet your new commanding officer. Griswald? He couldn't lead a glee club. You find that funny, Bradley? Well, I'm not here to make jokes! I'm here to make history! So if you wanna laugh, take it somewhere else. But if you wanna save the world, then suck in your gut and stand at attention. Now who's with me?    Soda bomb! Soda bomb! Vince, you and the Ashleys will be in charge of unit ""A."" I'll take unit ""B."" Spinelli, you get the special forces. Special forces? The kindergartners. I owe you for this, Griswald. Now there's one last thing I need to say. This mission is bigger than any one of us kids. Bigger than T.j. Even bigger than Principal Prickly. This, my friends, is about the future. Geez, he sounds like T.j. Shh. He's on a roll. Years from now when kids who aren't even born yet look back on this moment, they'll say, ""They did it. Those kids saved 3rd Street School. They saved summer vacation."" So, boys and girls, we're goin' in. Twentytwo minutes to perigee, sir. Very good, Fenwick.  Hello, boys. Hey!   Where now? The auditorium. Check.  Nessun Dorma  Huh? Nessun Dorma  Is that a kid? Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me Hey, kid, get out of here! Aah. Anderson, get rid of that kid, will ya? Il Nome mio Nessun Sapra  No, no Smithson, Underhill. Sir. Sulla tua boca  Lo diro Quando la Luce Hanklin, Morrissey, Goodman, get over here! Yes, sir. Right away, sir. On the double. We'll take care of him. Don't worry about it. You sure this is gonna work, Detweiler? Come on, Principal Prickly. Don't you ever watch old spy movies? This trick is pure gold. Uh, Dr. Benedict wanted to speak to us about a very important matter. Hey, you two aren't guards. Run! I'm called little buttercup Anderson, Morrissey, Underhill? Where is everybody? Aah, if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. Poor little buttercup  Sweet little buttercup, I  Boy, these spaceage power shovels sure do a great job. Quick, in here. This way! They're inside. We lost 'em. Now what? Ammo.  Tender. Commence phase two. Ready? Hey, guards! Huh?  You little brats! Now! Intruders!   Scandalous!  Now! Huh? Bombard, men! Get 'em.   ""Lunch room, front office..."" Here it is, ""auditorium.""  Uh, Fenwick, why is the power off? Uh, perhaps we blew a fuse, sir? Well, go fix it! We must restore the power. Quickly, here. Hey, what happened? Let us out! Plan's working, Gus. Good. Now we gotta stop that laser beam before it's too late. That's what you think, kid. You brats are done for.  Hey, baldy! Say your prayers. It's chowder time.  Bull'seye! T.j.! I knew you guys would come back for us. Ooh, that's gotta hurt. Six minutes to perigee! Quick. To the auditorium. And no running in the halls! Emergency power system is in place. Switch on the global electrode. Power up the photon channeler. Activate the tractor beam, quickly! We've only got four minutes left.  You've got no minutes left, Phil. This is my school and I want it back. Sorry, Pete. You're just gonna have to wait until I finish making the world a better place. Now let's get this show on the road. Don't do it, Dr. Benedict! Don't do it? You think after all this planning, all this work, you can get me to stop just by saying, ""Don't do it""? What if we add ""please""?  You kids just don't get it, do you? Well, let me explain this in a way your little uneducated brains will understand. The American public think test scores are too low. But if a person, say me, could make test scores go up, why, everybody'd feel better. They might even elect that person... President of the United States. Now, do you have any idea which countries have the highest test scores? Um, japan? Germany? Tierra Del Fuego? Canada, Iceland, Norway! And why? Because it's snowing up there all the time. Kids don't waste their summers playing ball. They're inside studying. And that is why I'm getting rid of summer vacation once and for all. You got it all wrong, old man. Your plan will never work. Sure, maybe your crazy laser beam can move the moon. Maybe it can even make it snow all summer. Maybe you can get rid of long afternoons playing baseball, or sunny days down by the lake or warm nights camping out under the stars. But that won't stop us. We'll ride our bikes through the snow. We'll play kick ball in the slush, we'll camp out in igloos. You may take away summer, but you'll never take away summer vacation. Well, I can try. Do it... now! Yes, sir. Begin photon channeling. Photon channeling begun. Set magnification coordinates.073. Coordinates set. Engage tractor beam. No!  Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone! Ms. Finster. Muriel, it's you. You're still a vision of loveliness. Yeah? And you're still a twobit, recesshating pretty boy. That hurt, Muriel. But I'll forgive you if you'll just come back to me. Ha! I'd rather eat playground dirt. That can be arranged, my dear. Not before I take you down. Take me down? Yeah, right. You and what army? Me and this army. The teachers!   Get them! No, no, no, no no, no, no, no No, no, no, no no, no, no, no No, no, no, no no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, Nobody can do the Shimmy Like I do, Nobody can do the Shake Like I do, Nobody can do the Boogaloo Like I do, Nobody can do the Shimmy   Fire! Let me tell you, Nobody Nobody Nobody Nobody Nobody Nobody  Drink soda, ninjas! Halt! Flying press! Nice flying press, Spinelli. Thanks. I've been working on it. No, no, no, no no, no, no, no You!  Stop right there, Kojak. It's go time. Nobody can do the Shake Like I do, Nobody can do the Boogaloo Thanks, Ms. Finster. Just doing my job, Detweiler. Hurry! There's still time. Faster, you idiot! Faster! Hold it right there, Phillium. The semester's over for you, pal. Not so fast, Pete. You might fall asleep and miss the festivities. Hey, Phillium, there's a spot on your tie. Where?  It's jammed. You're too late, Pete. This time I win. Vince! The photon channeler. And forget what they told you. Aim it. Don't throw it. Look out! She's gonna blow!  All my plans, my hopes and dreams... ruined. Ruined! Get your hands off the suit, you classless feeb! I am the former secretary of education. Yeah, yeah. And I'm the former princess of Morocco. Get in the car. BBBut it's all his fault. I was only following orders. I'll turn state's evidence. Geez, what a squealer. Come on, Grotke. I'll take you on. My boxing against your martial arts. East meets West. We'll see who wins. I don't know, Muriel. I'm only supposed to use it for selfdefense. What an exciting summer. T.j. saved the world... and Becky made assistant fry chef at Floppy Burger. Come on, Ellie. The reporters wanna talk to us about how we raised a hero. Listen, Becky, I heard about how you saved my life and everything, and... well, here, I think this is yours. My diary? I can't believe it. You realize this means you don't have any leverage over me anymore? Hey, what can I say? Maybe I'm just growing up. Gee, you're an allright little brother after all. But, Teej, what about the extra copies you got stashed away up in the tree house? Oh, I was just bluffing about those. So, Teej, we got two weeks of summer vacation left. What do you say we do 'em up right? But don't you guys have to get back to camp, work on your futures and all? Well, we've been thinkin'. And we've decided there's plenty of time for preparing for our futures. But only a little time left for just being kids. So, what do you say we head down to the pond and skip some rocks? You guys got yourselves a deal. Oh, boy! My first summer vacation memories. Uh, guys. I'll catch up with you. I forgot something inside. Okay, but hurry. Principal Prickly? Huh? Oh, it's you, Detweiler. I was just, um, cleaning up this mess Phillium left. Guy always was a pack rat. Look at this. A Norwegian weather map from 1956. Listen, sir, I never really got a chance to thank you for all the stuff you did. You know, quitting your golf game, telling Benedict to let me go, helping me save the world and junk. Oh, actually, Detweiler, I'm the one who should be thanking you. Huh? You did me a big favor by dragging me into this mess. See, I didn't get into teaching for the promotions or the pension plans... or so I could get to the golf course by 3:45. I... I... did it 'cause I wanted to help you kids. And I'd forgotten that. Till today.  Come on, Teej. The pond awaits. I'll be there in a second. Hey, it's a gorgeous summer day and your pals are waiting. Go have some fun while you can... Teej. You got it... Pete.  But don't forget! Come September, you're mine. I haven't forgotten that ""saggy butt"" comment. Hey, September is a long way off. Let the sunshine Let the sunshine in The sunshine in Let the sunshine Whoa, let it shine Let the sunshine in Come on The sunshine in Everybody just sing along Let the sunshine Let the sunshine in Let the sunshine in Open up your heart and let in shine in The sunshine in When you're alone Let the sunshine  One, two, three, four.

I'll be home before you know it. I promise. Now, now. What's all this? I want to go with you. I need you here to take care of your mom and Danny. Can you do that for me? Mmhmm. That's my big girl. Be safe, Edward. Look after each other, now. Goodbye, Daddy! I love you! I love you all! Drive off! But the war lasted much longer... than anyone could have imagined: Bombs fell from the sky... and tore at the very heart of London. Don't cry, son. All aboard! in an effort to protect its children... the government decreed... that they all be sent to the countryside for safekeeping. Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! I love you! Good luck, sweetie! in times such as these... it is no wonder some discard childish things... like Peter Pan and Never Land.   What is it, Nanatwo?   Ha ha ha!  We don't have time, you silly dog. We have to get this home to Danny.  Oh, no! Quick, Nanatwo!   Mommy, where's Jane? Don't you worry, Danny. She'll be along. All right, now. Here we go. Into the bomb shelter.  Bring the lights up!

That's a good one! it was late one misty evening... and Hook was sure once again... that he'd found Peter's hideout. Hook and hls bloodthirsty crew went ashore... leaving the Jolly Roger unguarded. That's when Peter Pan arrived! He and the Boys slipped aboard... and there they found it__ Hook's remarkable treasure! Wow! Peter told the Lost Boys they'd hide it... and Hook would have to hunt them down to get it back. it was all a great game for Peter, and then... from out of the mist, he was there__ the evil Captaln Hook! A fierce and ferocious sword fight was fast underway.  Ha ha!   Give up, boy! Never! And at that moment... a shimmering magic covered the ship. Tinker Bell! Yes! And the Jolly Roger... lifted into the sky... as Peter and the Boys escaped with the treasure.   Aah! You've not seen the end of me, Peter Pan! I'll get you for this if it's the last thing I do! So you see, Danny... Hook will never win... as long as there's faith... trust, and pixle dust. Poppycock! Aah! Slow down, you old codfish! Oh, my notebook!  Ow! Daniel! Come on, Jane! We'll beat old Captain Hook together! Daniel, please. I've no time for fun and games. You used to. You got to be the very first Lost Girl ever. That was a long time ago. Yeah. Back when you were fun.

Peter Pan says they'll make you fly. Daniel, story time is over! Look! lt's a war. Peter Pan isn't real, and people don't fly! They do too! Oh, come on, Daniel! Grow up! It's just a lot of childish nonsense! You're lying! Jane, how could you treat your brother that way? You think you're very grownup... but you have a great deal to learn.   Uhh!

A nice massage is just the ticket for you. Now, you just forget about old Peter Pan.  Perhaps you're right. Ooh!  Ooh! Ahh! Ooh!  All in the past, I say. All in the past. Ah, the past. Likes when he stole your treasure.  Wah! Oohh! My treasure? And then laughed in your face. Ha ha! Laughed in my face. Or today, for example... tricking that there sea monster into pulling down your pants. Wahh ohh! Right in front of the crew, too. Right in front of the crew! We've got to find him!  Whoaoh!  Catchy.  Smee, listen!    Great scott! No sooner do I rid meself... of that cursed crocodile, and now this!  Oh, there, there. He's just a playful little sea urchin is all. I swear, Smee, this is propelling me to delirium. I detest cephalopods.  Thank you.    Smee! Save me! Oh, you big brute, you! Off with you. Go on, now. Shoo, shoo. And take your arms with you. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.   Hmm! At least the crocodile had manners.  Blast that scurvy boy! This is all his fault. Mr. Smee, pipe up the crew. We're going ashore to find Peter Pan!  Tink, what is she doing? It looks like she's leaving.  Shh!  Halfdozen bananas...check. Ten coconuts...check. Two oars... Hey, Jane. Aah! How come you want to go home so bad? I have to get back to my family. Why? Well, um, I don't want to talk about it. Why not? If you must know, we had a fight. Why? Oh. I told my little brother you weren't real. What?! Why? Well, oh, I don't know. But I have to get back and set things right. Why? Because! That's why!    Well, you know, you can't get home that way. I__I've got to try. Well...goodbye. It was nice meeting you, Peter Pan. Duty calls.   Oh! Oh, dear! Oh, no! Wah! Whoaoh!  You OK? I just want to go home. Well, you know, the only way out of here is to fly. Come on, I'll show you how. Ohh! Step softly... you worthless dogs! Set your sights for Peter Pan! Oh, goodness. Haven't we searched the island a thousand times before? I beg your pardon, Mr. Smee? I said that, uh, searching for Pan is, um, uh... fun galore.   There'll be no rest until we have that boy in irons. Ohh.  Hey! Watch it, Cubby! Oh, no, Peter. I really don't think this wo__ Uhh. This is ridiculous. I can't fly! Well, of course you can't. But I can! I guess I'm just smarter than you. Ohh. I highly doubt that. Braver. Right. Stronger!  Oh, yeah, that's it. Well, then, it must be my good looks. Or maybe you're full of hot air. Wah! Hey! Look, anybody can do it. Tink? Yeah! All it takes is faith... Trust... And, uh, something else. Pixie dust? That's it! Ooh!  Ow! OK, Tink, let her have it.  Tink...  Gosh, Tink, if she can't fly home... I guess she'll have to move in with us.  Ooh. Oh! Ah.  That's enough!   Ahh. Ahahahchoo! Oh!  Yow! Ohh!   Hot's fish, what's that? OK, Jane. Don't even think about it. Ready or not...  I got her! I got her! I got her! I got her!   I thought you said you got her.  Oh, how will I ever get back home? So, the girl can't fly, yet she wants to go home. Smee, do you know what this means? Six more weeks of winter? No, you imbecile.  We'll get me treasure... and the boy. Hey, what's this? Oh, give that back. It's my list! Things to do, places to be__ important things! Huh? That stuff's no fun. No wonder you can't fly! Give it back, Peter. Ha ha! Slightly, catch!  Keep away from Jane!  I got it! You boys are horrid! Come on, come on, over here! You're ripping it! Why don't you guys ever throw to me? No, stop it! This isn't funny! Whoo hoo! I've got it!     Ha ha ha! This is just a game to you, isn't it?  Well, I'm tired of playing. Gosh, Jane, we didn't mean to make you mad. Oh, grow up. You did so. You're just a bunch of silly, ridiculous children.  No, no, leave me alone! Oh, I don't believe in any of this! And I especially don't believe in fairies!  Goodbye! Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance!  Hmm. Uh, Peter? I think there's something wrong... with Tinker Bell.       Ohh.    I need you here... to take care of your mom and Danny. Can you do that for me? Mmhmm. That's my big girl. I love you!     Ooh. Looks kinda bad. Kinda bad? Kinda? Oh, it's hopeless! Poor little Tinker Bell!  Hey, put a cork in it!  Shh!  Uhhuh. Uhhuh.  What? What did she say, Peter? If we don't get Jane to believe in fairies... Tink's light's gonna go out.  Well, let's just go and make her believe! Hang on a mlnute. Ow! You can't just make somebody believe in fairies. But we believe. Yeah, it ain't hard for us. That's it! We gotta make Jane one of us! But she's a girl! You want to help Tink, don't ya? Uhhuh. We gotta do it!   Don't worry, Tink. We'll save you.     Stay where you are! Please, go right ahead. Run me through. You'd be doing me a favor.  All right. I give up. What's your problem?  All I've ever wanted... was to get away from this dreadful place. And home to my dear, sweet mother. But blast it all... Peter stole my treasure, and my men would mutiny... if I so much as tried to leave without it. So here I am.  Stuck in this absurd place. Oh, oh, oh. My...sources... tell me you wish to return home as well? Huh, you got that right.  I guess we're in the same boat. The same boat! That's it! Wwhat's it? I'll give you passage home on my ship... and you can help me recover my treasure. Oh, don't you see? The treasure's useless to Peter. He's not sensible like you and I. He's just a boy who'll never grow up. Hmm. Tell me about it. And, really, what other cholice do you have? It's not as though you could fly home. Hmm, well, I suppose. If it is rightfully yours. And if it's really no use to Peter... Splendid, splendid! Wait! Hmm? You must swear not to harm Peter. Me? Actually harm Peter Pan? Perish the thought. It's all a game, you see. I shan't harm him. You have my word. ""I, Captain James Hook... ""do hereby swear... ""not to harm a single hair on Peter Pan's head."" You see? Ironclad, unbreakable.  Leave the light on, Mommy... your baby boy's coming home. Now, when you've located the treasure... just give this a wee toot. You're doing the right thing, my dear. I'm your only way home.  Jane! Jane! Jane, come on back! Jane! Jane? Jane!   Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! Peter! Hmm? Peter Pan! Ohh! There you are!  I've been looking all over for__ I, uh__ I, uh__no, no, no__ You.

But you'll have to think like a Lost Boy. Uhh... And have fun like a Lost Boy!  Tell me what to do.  Well... to be one of us... Yes? There are some things to know. What's that?

And Captain Hook is a man of his word. I promised... I wouldn't harm a single hair on his head. And... Ow! This is the one I won't harm! Here, you keep it. The rest of him is mine!  I didn't do it, Peter! I never agreed to this. You're a traitor, Jane. You lied to me! And because you don't believe in fairies... Tink's light is going out! Tinker Bell?  No. Peter, I... I'll save you, Peter! I will! My dear, no one can save him now!      Tinker Bell! Tinker Bell! Tink! Tink! Tinker Bell! It's true.  I can flnally see it   Now I have to believe  Oh. Oh, no.

The Emperors New Groove,Disney,2000,2000,Animation,"Aah! Will you take a look at that? Pretty pathetic, huh? Well, you'll never believe this, but that llama you're looking at was once a human being. And not just any human being. That guy was an emperor. A rich, powerful ball of charisma. Oh, yeah! This is his story. Well, actually my story. That's right. I'm that llama. The name is Kuzco... Emperor Kuzco. I was the world's nicest guy, and they ruined my life for no reason. Oh, is that hard to believe? Look, I tell you what. You go back aways... You know, before I was a llama, and this will all make sense. All right, now see, that's a little too far back. Ohho. Look at me! That's me as a baby. Ahem! All right, let's move ahead. Oh, yeah. There are despots and dictators Political manipulators There are blue bloods with the intellects of fleas There are kings and catty tyrants Who are so lacking in refinements They'd be better suited swinging from the trees He was born and raised to rule No one has ever been as cool In a thousand years of aristocracy An enigma and a mystery In Mesoamerican history The quintessence of perfection that is he Okay, this is the real me. Not this. This. Not this. Winner! Loser. Okay, see this palace? Everyone in it is at my command. Check this out. Butler. Chef. Theme song guy. Oh, yeah! He's the sovereign lord of the nation He's the hippest cat in creation He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z And this perfect world will spin Around his every little whim 'Cause this perfect world begins and ends with Me. What's his name? Kuzco That's his name Kuzco He's the king of the world Kuzco Is he hip or what? Kuzco Yeah Gow! You threw off my groove! I'm sorry, but you've thrown off the emperor's groove. Sorry! You were saying? What's his name? Kuzco Kuzco That's his name Is he hip or what? Don't you know he's the king of the world? Whoa, yeah Ow! Ha! Boom, baby! Aah! Your Highness, it is time for you to choose your bride. All righty. Trot out the ladies. Let's take a looksee. Hate your hair. Not likely. Yikes, yikes, yikes. And let me guess. You have a great personality. Is this really the best you could do? Oh, yes. Oh, no. I mean, perhaps... What is he babbling about? He's like the thing that wouldn't shut up. Anyway, still wondering about that llama in the opening? Well, let me show you the people responsible for ruining my life. First, there's Pacha. Uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Emperor Kuzco. You see, I got this summons... Inside, up the stairs, and to the left. Just follow the signs. Oh, great. Thanks a lot. Uh, and don't be fooled by the folksy peasant look. Oh! Uh, pardon me. That's mine. Oh, here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. Aah! Oh, hey. Are you all right? Here. Let me... Oh, you're so very kind. What happened? Well, I threw off the emperor's groove. What? His groove! The rhythm in which he lives his life, his pattern of behavior. I threw it off, and the emperor had me thrown out the window. Oh, really? I'm supposed to see him today. Don't throw off his groove! Oh, okay. Beware the groove. Hey, are you gonna be all right? Groove. You see what I mean? This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is, he is nothing compared to what's coming up next. And why have you come here today? Well... Your Highness... I mean, Your Grace. Okay, gang. Check out this piece of work. This is Yzma, the emperor's advisor, living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth. And let's not forget Yzma's righthand man. Every decade or so she gets a new one. This year's model is called Kronk. Yeah, I got that there, Yzma. Uh! Yep, that's Kronk. Now lately, Yzma's gotten into this bad habit of trying to run the country behind my back, and I'm thinkin' that's got to stop. It is no concern of mine whether your family has... What was it again? Um, food. Ha! You really should have thought of that before you became peasants. We're through here. Take him away. Next! But I... Okay. Ugh. The nerve of some of those peasants, huh? Tell me about it. Aah! Hi there. Ooh, Your Highness. Ahem. Oh, oh, oh. Um... Uh, you were doing it again. Doing? Doing... Doing what? Doing my job. I'm the emperor, and you're the emperor's advisor. Remember that? But, Your Highness, I was only dealing with meaningless peasant matters. Whoa! Look at these wrinkles. What is holding this woman together? What the... How long has that been there? Good thinkin', Yzma. What do you say, Kuzco? Whoa! No touchy! No touchy. No touch. Uh, excuse me, Your Highness. The village leader is here to see you. Oh, great. Send him in. Oh, and by the way, you're fired. Fired? What do you mean, fired? Um, how else can I say it? You're being let go, your department's being downsized, you're part of an outplacement, we're going in a different direction, we're not picking up your option... Take your pick. I got more. But I... You... Uh... Uhh. But... But, Your Highness, I have been nothing if not loyal to the empire for many, many years. Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride. You just hit yours 50 years ago. So, who's in my chair? Oh, oh! I know! Yzma. Yzma's in your chair, right? Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack. Got it! Oof! Okay, you heard the man. Up, up, up. I'm okay. I'm fine. Ah. Okay. Show him in. Ahem. Uh, Afternoon, Your Highness. I'm here because I received a summons... Hey, there he is! My main village man. Um, Pacha. Anyway, I got this summons... Pacha. That's right. You are just the man I wanted to see. I am? Word on the street is you can fix my problem. You can fix my problem, can't you? Sure. I'll do what I can. Good, good. That's just what I wanted to hear. Are you aware of just how important your village is to the empire? Well, I know we grow the crops that you use here at the palace. We also herd the llamas that you... My village? Oh, yeah. You got a pretty sweet little setup there on top of that hill, don't you? Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop for the last six generations. Uhhuh. So tell me, where do you find you get the most sun? Oh, I'd say just on the other side of those trees. When the sun hits that ridge just right, these hills sing. Well, that settles it. Really? Yep. Problem solved. Thanks for coming. That's it? That's all you wanted me for? I just needed an insider's opinion before I okay'd this spot for my pool. Uh, your pool? Booyah! Welcome to Kuzcotopia, my ultimate summer getaway complete with water slide. What? Isn't it great? It's my birthday gift to me. Ha! I'm so happy. Uh... Uh... Um... I don't understand how this could happen. Well, let me clear it up for you. At my birthday celebration tomorrow, I give the word, and your town will be destroyed to make way for this... So, if I were you, I'd pick up some changeofaddress forms on the way home. But, um, where will we live? Hmmm. Don't know, don't care. How's that? Oh, but wait. You can't... When I give the word, your little town thingy will be byebye. Byebye! Oh, wait. No... Boohoo. Oh, yeah. Everything was goin' my way. Or so I thought. He can't get rid of me that easily. Who does that ungrateful little worm think he is? Does he... A little to the left. Have any idea of who he's dealing with? How could he do this to me? Why, I practically raised him. Yeah, you think he would've turned out better. Yeah, go figure. Well, it's better you're takin' out your anger on these things instead of the real Kuzco, huh? That's it, Kronk! That's it! I'll get rid of Kuzco. The real Kuzco? Of course the real Kuzco. Don't you see? It's perfect. With him out of the way and no heir to the throne, I'll take over and rule the empire. Brilliant! So how does that work with you bein' fired and all? The only ones who know about that are the three of us, soon to be the two of us. And I'm one of those two, right? To the secret lab! Pull the lever, Kronk. Wrong lever! Huh? Why do we even have that lever? Get out of my way! Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times. Whee! Faster, faster! Yzma, put your hands in the air! Whoohoo! Whoohoo! Ah, how shall I do it? Oh, I know. I'll turn him into a flea, a harmless little flea, and then I'll put that flea in a box, and then I'll put that box inside of another box, and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives... I'll smash it with a hammer! It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you! Genius, I say! Or, to save on postage, I'll just poison him with this. Take it, Kronk. Oh, ho, ho. Feel the power. Oh... I can feel it. Our moment of triumph approaches. It's dinner time. So, is everything ready for tonight? Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off with soup and a light salad and then see how we feel after that. Not the dinner... The youknow... Oh, right. The poison... The poison for Kuzco, the poison chosen specially to kill Kuzco, Kuzco's poison. That poison? Yes! That poison. Got you covered. Excellent. A few drops in his drink, then I'll propose a toast, and he will be dead before dessert. Which is a real shame, because it's gonna be delicious. Boom, bam, baby! Let's get to the grub. I am one hungry king of the world. So, no hard feelings about being let go? None whatsoever. Kronk, get the emperor a drink. Drink. Right. Your Highness. Is something burning? My spinach puffs! Ahem. So, he seems nice. He is. He's what, in his late 20s? I'm not sure. Saved 'em! That's great. Great! Good job. Very good job. Watch it. They're still hot. Ahem. Ahem! Kronk. The emperor needs his drink. Right. Oh, right. Hey, Kronky, everything okay back there? Well... Oh, uh... Ooh. The drinks were a bit on the... Mmm. Oh... Uh... Warm side. Hey, did you see that sky today? Talk about blue. Yes, Kronk. Riveting. A toast to the emperor! Long live Kuzco! Don't drink the wine. Poison. Ah! Tasty. Finally! Good work, Kronk. Oh, they're so easy to make. I'll get you the recipe. Now to get rid of the body. Okay! What were we saying? Uh, we were just making a toast to your long and... Healthy rule. Right. So what are you gonna do? I mean, you've been around here a long time, and I really mean a long time. Ahem. It might be difficult for someone of your age adjusting to life in the private sector. Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal? Be a friend? Ha, ha. Now, about you finding new work... Hit him on the head. That's gonna be tough. More broccoli? Because you're... You know. Let's face it. You're no spring chicken, and I mean that in the best possible way. What? A llama? He's supposed to be dead! Yeah, weird. Let me see that vial. This isn't poison. This is extract of llama. Ugh! You know, in my defense, your poisons all look alike. You might think about relabeling some of them. Take him out of town and finish the job now! What about dinner? Kronk, this is kind of important. How about dessert? Well, I suppose there's time for dessert. And coffee? All right. A quick cup of coffee. Then take him out of town and finish the job! Cha cha cha cha Guess where I am right now. Uhhuh. In the bag. Still think I'm not the victim here? Watch. It gets better. Hey! Ugh, he's doing his own theme music? Big, dumb, and tone deaf. I am so glad I was unconscious for all of this. Mission accomplished. You're not just gonna let him die like that, are you? My shoulder angel. Don't listen to that guy. He's trying to lead you down the path of righteousness. I'm gonna lead you down the path that rocks. Oh, come off it. You come off it! You. You. You. You infinity. Uhh! Listen up, big guy. I got three good reasons why you should just walk away. Number one... Look at that guy! He's got that sissy stringy music thing. We've been through this. It's a harp, and you know it. Oh, right. That's a harp... And that's a dress. Robe! Reason number 2. Look what I can do. But, what does that have to do with anything? No, no. He's got a point. Listen, you guys. You're sort of confusing me, so begone! Uh, or, uh, you know. However I get rid of you guys. That'll work. Um, what's with the chimp and the bug? Can we get back to me? Oh, boy. Think, think, think. What to do, what to do? What do we do with the body? What am I gonna tell the village? Come on, Kronky. Come on, Kronky. Okay. What do I do? What do I do? Aah! Back! Elbow! Shoulder! Ugh! Oh, hey! Hey, you! Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me. Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry about that. Comin' through. Hey, you with the cart! Uhoh! This is not good. Uhh. Hope that doesn't come back to haunt me. Mom, Mom! I think I'm still growing! Measure me again! All right, Tipo. Stand still and let's see. Mom, you and I both know that it's impossible for him to have grown in the last five minutes. Mmm! Mmm! Isn't it? Look how much you've grown! What? Tipo, get out of the way. It's my turn again. Measure me. Dad's home! Hey! Come here. Dad! I ate a bug today! Oh! Was Mom baking again? Heh. Don't tell her I said that. I heard that. Okay, everybody, move aside. Lady with a baby comin' through. Dad, Dad, Dad! Look at how big I am! We were all measured today. Oh. I'm going through a growth spurt. I'm as big as you were when you were me. Mmmhmm. Sure are. That's not as impressive as my loose tooth. See? Okay, okay, you two. Our deal was that you could stay awake until Daddy came home. Now say good night. Dad, do we have to? No, you two can stay up. We're just gonna be sittin' here tellin' each other how much we love each other. Right, honey? Ew! Blecch! Good night. So what did the emperor want? Ahem. You know what? He couldn't see me. Couldn't see you? Why not? I don't know. Well, that's just rude. Well, he is the emperor. I'm sure he's busy. No, no, no, no. No. Emperor or no emperor, it's called common courtesy. Honey... If that were me, I'd march right back there and demand to see him, and you know I would. Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby. Pacha, I'm fine. This baby's not coming for a while, but even if it was, I'd give that guy a piece of my mind. That kind of behavior just... Uhh! I gotta go wash something. Pacha? You okay? Hmm? Oh, yeah. I'm just a little tired from the trip. Um... I'm gonna go put Misty away. Hi. Excuse me. Two seconds here. Um, I'm the one in the cart. Remember? This story's about me, not him. Okay. You got it? All right. We're gonna move ahead. Sorry to slow you down. Huh? Whoa! Uh. Oh... Where'd you come from, little guy? No touchy. Aah! Demon llama! Demon llama? Where? Aah! Aah! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Ow! My head. Okay, demon llama. Just take it easy. I mean you no harm. What are you talking about... Oh, wait. I know you. You're that whiny peasant. Emperor Kuzco? Yeah. Who do you think you were talkin' to? Uh. How did... Um. You don't... Look like the emperor. What do you mean I don't look like the emperor? Uh... Oh... Do this... What is this, some kind of little game you country folk like to... It can't be! Aah! Aah! Aah! My face! Aah! My beautiful, beautiful face! Okay, okay, okay. I'm an ugly, stinky llama! Wait, okay, Your Majesty. Llama face! What happened? I'm tryin' to figure that out, okay? I can't remember. I can't remember anything. Wait a minute. I remember you. I remember telling you that I was building my pool where your house was, and then you got mad at me. Oh! And you turned me into a llama! What? No, I did not. Yes, and then you kidnapped me. Why would I kidnap a llama? I have no idea. You're the criminal mastermind, not me. What? Hmm. You're right. That's giving you way too much credit. Okay. I have to get back to the palace. Yzma's got that ""secret lab."" I'll just snap my fingers and order her to change me back. Hey, you. No time to waste. Let's go. Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body. Wouldn't you? Now let's go. Build your summerhouse somewhere else. You want to run that by me again? I can't let you go back unless you change your mind and build your summer home somewhere else. Hmm. I got a little secret for you. Come here. No, closer. I don't make deals with peasants! Then I guess I can't take you back. Fine. I don't need you. I can find my own way back. I wouldn't recommend it. It's a little dangerous if you don't know the way. Nice try, pal. No, really. I'm telling you, there are jaguars and snakes and quicksand. I'm not listening. I'm not kidding. Listen, you cannot go in there. Oh. Heh. Still not listening. Ah, you... Fine. Fine. Go ahead! If there's no Kuzco, there's no Kuzcotopia. Takes care of my problem. Hmm. Scary jungle. Right. Oh, a leaf. Oh, it might attack me. Oh! It's a scary tree. I'm afraid. Ha ha. Please. Never find my way? I'm the emperor, and as such, I'm born with an innate sense of direction. Okay, where am I? What... Help me! Help me! Help me! Ohh! Uhh. Too late. Okay, that was the freakiest thing I've ever seen. Aah! What do you want? Oh, for me? Why, I don't know what to say. Ow! Hit the road, Bucky. Aah! Ow! Huh? Huh? Huh? Uhoh. No, no. No, no, no, no. No, no. No, don't. Ha! No! Aah! You killer jaguars... Whoa! Aah! Don't worry, Your Highness. I gotcha. You're safe now. Maybe I'm just new to this whole rescuing thing, but this, to me, might be considered kind of a step backwards, wouldn't you say? No, no, no. It's okay. This is all right. We can figure this out. I hate you. No! Aah! Ow! Whoohoohoo! Aah! Ow! Ow! Uhh! I don't know about you, but I'm getting all funned out. Uhoh. Don't tell me. We're about to go over a huge waterfall. Yep. Sharp rocks at the bottom? Most likely. Bring it on. Booyah! Whoo! Your Highness. Your Highness, can you hear me? Oh, boy. Come on, breathe. Breathe! Ohh. Why me? Ugh! All right. Ohh! Aah! Ohh! Ohh! For the last time, it was not a kiss. Well, whatever you call it... It was disgusting. And if you would've done what I ordered you to do in the first place, we all could've been spared your little kiss of life. Aw! But now that you're here, you will take me back to the palace. I'll have Yzma change me back, and then I'll start construction on Kuzcotopia. Oh, yeah. Okay, now, look, I think we got off on the wrong foot here. Mmmhmm. I just think if you really thought about it, you'd decide to build your home on a different hilltop. And why would I do that? Because... Deep down, I think you'll realize that you're forcing an entire village out of their homes just for you. And that's... Bad? Well, yeah. Nobody's that heartless. Mmm. Now take me back. What? Wait, wait. How can you be this way? All you care about is building your summer home and filling it with stuff for you. Uh, yeah. Doy. Me. Everyone else in the kingdom gets it. You're the only one that doesn't seem to be with the program, eh, Pacha? You know what? Someday, you're going to wind up all alone, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself. Thanks for that. I'll log that away. Now, for the final time, I order you to take me back to the palace. Looks to me like you're stuck out here, because unless you change your mind, I'm not taking you back. Because unless you change your mind, I'm not taking you back. Me, me, me. Moo, moo, moo. Huh? What? I didn't do anything. I didn't... Somebody's throwing stuff. You going to build a fire or what? What's going on? He's never going to change his mind. How am I ever going to get out of here? And so, it is with great sadness that we mourn the sudden departure of our beloved prince... Taken from us so tragically on the very eve of his 18th birthday. Poor little guy. His legacy will live on in our hearts... He never had a chance. For all eternity. Well, he ain't gettin' any deader. Back to work. Kronk, darlin', I must admit you had me worried when you mixed up those poisons, but now that Kuzco is dead, all is forgiven. Oh, yeah, yeah. He's... He's dead, all right. I mean, you can't get much deader than he... than he is right now. Unless, of course, we killed him again. I suppose. Hey, look, the royal dresser's here. Kronk... I should tell you right now I'm kind of hard to fit. Kronk... I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist. Ahh! Kuzco is dead, right? Tell me Kuzco's dead. I need to hear these words. Do you need to hear all those words exactly? He's still alive? Well, he's not as dead as we would've hoped. Kronk... I just thought I'd give you the headsup in case Kuzco ever came back. He can't come back! Yeah. That would be kind of awkward, especially after that lovely eulogy. You think? You and I are going out to find him. If he talks, we are through! Now let's move! Dad, look out! Tipo, what is it? I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log and was careening out of control down a raging river of death! All right, all right, it's okay. It was awful! It's okay, it's okay. Tipo, calm down. It was just a dream. Your dad's fine. He just went back to see the emperor. Oh. Like you told him to, 'cause you're always right. That's right. Well, in my dream, Dad had to kiss a llama. Yeah, like that would ever happen. It could. Nuhuh. Yeahhuh. Nuhuh. Yeahhuh. Good night, you two. Night, Mom! Brr! Uh, hey. Thanks. Oh. No problem. Feels like wool. Yeah. Alpaca? Oh, yeah, it is. Oh, yeah, I thought so. It's nice. My wife made it. Oh, she knits? Crochets. Crochets? Nice. Thanks. So... So, I was thinking that when I got back to the city, we'd... I mean, there's lots of hilltops, and maybe I might, you know... I might... Are you saying... You've changed your mind? Oh, well, I... Because you know that means you're doing something nice for someone else. No, I know that. I know. And you're all right with that? Yes. What? Don't shake unless you mean it. All right. Let's get you back to the palace. Oh, by the way, thanks. No... Thank you. Okay. Once we cross this bridge, it's only an hour to the palace. Good, because believe it or not, I think I need a bath. I believe it. What was that? Nothing. Ohh! Whoa! Kuzco! Kuzco! Yeah? Quick, help me up! No. I don't think I will. You're going to leave me here? Well, I was going to have you imprisoned for life, but I kind of like this better. I thought you were a changed man. Oh, come on. I had to say something to get you to take me back to the city. So all of it was a lie? Well, yeah. No, wait. Uh, yeah, yeah. It all was a lie. Toodles. We shook hands on it! You know, the funny thing about shaking hands is... You need hands. Ha. Okay. Buhbye. Ah! Are you okay? Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm all right. Good! That's for going back on your promise! Yeah. That's for kidnapping me and taking me to your village... Which I'm still gonna destroy, by the way. No touchy. Ohh! Why did I risk my life for a selfish brat like you? I was always taught that there was some good in everyone, but, oh, you proved me wrong. Oh, boohoo. Now I feel really bad. Bad llama. I could've let you die out there in that jungle, and then all my problems would be over. Well, that makes you ugly and stupid. Let's end this. Ladies first. Aah! Ohh! Ow! Ow! Whoa! Ohh! What are we gonna do? Aah! What are we gonna do? We're gonna die! We're gonna die! That's it for me! No, we're not. Calm down. I have an idea. Give me your arm. Okay, now the other one. When I say go, push against my back, and we'll walk up the hill. Ready? Go. Ow! You did that on purpose. Aah! No, I didn't! Now, we're gonna have to work together to get out of this, so follow my lead. Ready? Right foot. Whose right? Your right or mine? I don't care. Mine. Well, why yours? Okay, your right! Ready? Okay, got it. Okay, right. Left. Right. Look, we're moving! Aah! Don't look down! Now, stay with me. Stay with me. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right! Now what, genius? Working on it. Okay, here's the deal. Stretch out your neck, and I'll grab the rope. How do I know you won't let me fall after you grab the rope? You're just gonna have to trust me! You know, it's a good thing you're not a big, fat guy, or this would be really difficult. Almost. Got it! It's stuck. Take your time. No hurry here. Scorpions! Kuzco! Aah! Oh, no! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Huh? Whoa! Huh? Look out! Ohh. Whoohoo! Yeah! Ooh, look at me and my bad self. I snatched you right out of the air. ""Ooh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall, and I'm taking you with me."" Well, not today, pal. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh. You just saved my life. Huh? So? I knew it. Knew what? That there is some good in you after all. Oh, no. Admit it. Wrong. Yes, there is. Nuhhuh. I think there is. Nuhhuh. Hey, you could've let me fall. Come on, what's the big deal? Nobody's that heartless. Don't read too much into it. It was a onetime thing. Right. Sure. Well, we better get going. With that bridge out, it's a fourday walk to the palace. What? You mean you're still taking me back? I shook on it, didn't I? Well, yeah, but I hope you realize that doesn't change a thing. I'm still building Kuzcotopia when I get back. Well, four days is a long time. Who knows? Maybe you'll change your mind. Uhhuh. Four days. What are the chances of you carrying me? Not good. No, no, no! We've searched every village surrounding the palace and still no sign of Kuzco. Where is he? Kronk! Kronk here. I'm getting tired. Pull over. Sure thing. Kronk out. Ooh! Aah! Aah! Ohh! Perfect. These are my best shoes. I hate this jungle. Oh, look. A goldenthroated smallwinged warbler. Just one more for exotic bird bingo. Ahh! I am loving this. Ahh! Get away from me! Yeah. Tell me about it. No, no, it's not you. She's not the easiest person to get close to. There's a wall there. Trust me. Are you talking to that squirrel? I was a Junior Chipmunk. I had to be versed in all the woodland creatures. Please continue. Aah! Why me? Why me? Hey, it doesn't always have to be about you. This poor little guy has had it rough. Seems a talking llama gave him a hard time the other day. Oh. A talking llama? Do tell. Uh, he doesn't really want to talk to you. Well, then you ask him. I hate being in the middle. Squeaky, squeak, squeaker, squeakin'. Jaguars? No kidding? Brutal. Uh, could you give us a little room here? Oh, sorry. A little bit more, please. How is this? Yeah, that's good. Now ask him which way the talking llama went! Squeakitysqueak, squeakin'. Low blood sugar, huh? Yeah. It's a curse. Well, as soon as we get something to eat, you're walking the rest of the way. Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut, home of the mug... Of meat. What'll it be? Ahem. We'll have two specials. Is that all right, dear? Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin. You know what I like. We're on our honeymoon. Bless you for coming out in public. So that's two specials. And an onion log. To split. Ordering! I need two heartburns and a deepfried doorstop on table 12! Okay, so I'll admit this was a good idea. When will you learn that all my ideas are good ones? That's funny, because I thought you going into the jungle by yourself, being chased by jaguars, lying to me to take you back to the palace were all really bad ideas. Oh, yeah, anything sounds bad when you say it with that attitude. Hot and crispy pill bug for the happy couple. Mazel tov. Oh, boy. Ooh. Ugh. Oh, here. Let me get that for you. Where are you going? I'm just going to slip into the kitchen and have a word with the chef. You're gonna get us thrown out. Please. With this disguise, I'm invisible. Heh. We've been walking around in circles for who knows how long. That is the last time we take directions from a squirrel. I should have done away with Kuzco myself when I had the chance. Oh, you really gotta stop beating yourself up about that. Uhoh. I'll get you another one there, Yzma. You using that fork there, pal? Hey, don't I know you? I don't think so. Wrestled you in high school? Don't remember that. Metal shop? I got it! Miss Narca's interpretive dance, two semesters. I was usually in the back because of my weak ankles. Come on, pal. You gotta help me out here. I don't think we've ever met, but I gotta go. Don't worry. I'll think of it. Look, all I know is the food looked iffy. I'm not the only one that thinks that, I'm sure. Psst. Hey! So I'm just checking to make sure you're going to take the main course up a notch. Is there anything on this menu that is not swimming in gravy? Hang on. I'll go ask the chef. It's a simple question. Is there or is there not anything edible on this menu? Gah! Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet! Hey, pal, what's your policy on making special orders? All right, buster, that's it! You want a special order, then you make it! I quit! Yeah, but I... I try and I try, but there's no respect for anyone with vision. That's it! There's just nothing I can do about it! Please don't go. Three pork combos, extra bacon on the side, two chili cheese samplers, a basket of liver and onion rings, a catch of the day, and a steak cut in the shape of a trout. You got all that, honey? Three oinkers wearing pants, plate of hot air, basket of grandma's breakfast, and change the bull to a gill, got it. What's going on? No time to explain. We gotta get out of here. What is he doing in there? Ugh. Come on! In a minute. I'm still hungry. No, Kuzco! Okay, I'll make it simple for you. I'll have a spinach omelet with wheat toast. You got it? Can do. What's taking so long? Pickup! Kronk! What are you doing? Kinda busy here. Why am I not surprised? Your order's up! Ohh! Oh, well, while you're at it, make me the special. And hold the gravy! Check. Pickup! You know what? On second thought, make my omelet a meat pie. Meat pie. Check. Kronk! Can I order the potatoes as a side dish? I'll have to charge you full price. Ooh! Hey, how about a side of potatoes, my buddy? You got it. Want cheese on those potatoes? Thank you, Kronk. Cheddar will be fine. Cheddar spuds coming up. Spuds yes, cheese no. Hold the cheese. No, I want the cheese. Cheese me no like. Cheese out. Cheese in! Come on, make up your mind! Okay, okay, on second thought... Make my potatoes a salad. Excuse me. You see that woman over there? No problem, hon. We do that all the time. One, two, three, four... Happy, happy birthday From all of us to you We wish it was our birthday So we could party, too Happy, happy birthday May all your dreams come true Hohoho. It's your birthday? What are you doing? Look, there's two people in there looking for you. What? A big guy and a skinny old woman. Wait. Was this woman scary beyond all reason? Oh, yeah. That's Yzma and Kronk! I'm saved! Trust me, they're not here to save you. They'll take me back to the palace. Thanks for your help. You've been great. I can take it from here. You don't understand. They're trying to kill you. Kill me? Their whole world revolves around me. No. I can't let you! What? Wha... Oh, oh, I get it! You don't want to take me back to the palace. You want to keep me stranded out here forever. No! This has all been an act, and I almost fell for it. Will you just listen to me... No, no, you listen to me. All you care about is your stupid hilltop! What? You don't care about me. Now, just get out of here. Go! But... Go on! Get outta here! Fine! Hmph! Oh, this entire mess is all your fault. What'd I do? If you hadn't mixed up those poisons, Kuzco would be dead now! There'll be no more diversions until we track that llama down and kill him! Said I was sorry. Can't just let it go. Not even on your birthday. Kuzco must be eliminated. The empire will finally be rid of that useless slug. You got a point. Nobody really seems to care that he's gone, do they? Pacha! Pacha? So this is where you came in. See, just like I said, I'm the victim here. I didn't do anything, and they ruined my life and took everything I had. Hey, give it a rest up there, will you? What? I'm just telling them what happened. Who you kidding, pal? They saw the whole thing, they know what happened. Well, yeah, but... Just leave me alone. The peasant at the diner! He didn't pay his check. He's the peasant who I saw leaving the city who disappeared into the crowd with Kuzco on the back of his cart. He must have taken him back to his village, so if we find the village, we find him, and if we find him, we find Kuzco. Oh, yeah, it's all comin' together. Yzma! What? Aah! This had better be good! Yuck! So, there we were standing on the cliff, and the ground started to rumble. And just as it started to go, he grabbed me before I fell. Do you believe that? You know, call me crazy for following this guy all the way out here, but as much as he tries to deny it, I know there's some good in him. Besides, I couldn't just leave him out here all alone. He's a lousy llama. I mean, a really lousy llama. Hey, listen, Pacha, you know, what I said to you back at the diner, that, I didn't really... So, you tired of being a llama? Yes! Okay, we're just gonna stop at the house and get some supplies. Then we'll be on our way, right? Right. Hey there, Pacha. You just missed your relatives. My relatives? We just sent them up to your house. What did they look like? See, there was this big guy and this older woman who was... How would you describe her? Scary beyond all reason. Yeah, that's it. So, remind me again how you're related to Pacha? Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's wife's stepniece's greataunt. Twice removed. Uhhuh. Isn't that right, Kronk? Ninetynine monkeys jumpin' on the bed One fell off and bumped his head You know, I am so sorry that you had to come all this way, but as I said to you before, you may recall, Pacha is not here. I'll be sure and tell him you came by. Oh, would you, please? That would be just great. Oops! Silly me. No, no. Allow me. She's hiding something. When I give the word, we search the house. Okay, but I still have 94 monkeys to go. Grr! So, while we're waiting for Paca... Pacha. Oh, yes. Um... Perhaps we can have a tour of your lovely home. You know, why don't you just come back when Pacha gets home? I'm sure he'd love to show you the... Excuse me, won't you? I think I left something in the oven. This is my variation of doubledutch. On the signal, we switch places. Kronk, it's time! Okay! Grr! So, we have to get back to the palace, find the lab, and change him back. Hi there! Aah! Um, that was him. Whoops. You know what? I don't believe you're really my greataunt. You're more like my greatgreatgreat... Go. I'll stall them long enough for you two to get a head start. Thanks, honey. You have a lovely wife. They're both very pretty. Greatgreatgreat... Grr. All right! Are you through? Greatgreataunt. So, where were we? Listen, sister, we're not leaving until... I show you the house. Of course. Was it a good idea to leave your family with those two? Oh, don't worry. They can handle themselves. What do you mean, the door is stuck? Try jiggling the handle. There is no handle in here. There's not? Are you sure? All right, I've had enough of this. Tell us where the talking llama is and we'll burn your house to the ground. Uh, don't you mean ""or""? Tell us where the talking llama is or we'll burn your house to the ground. Well, which is it? That seems like a pretty crucial conjunction. That's it! Kronk, break the door down! Break it down? Are you kidding me? This is handcarved mahogany. I don't care, you fool. Get out of my way. I'll break it down myself. Aone... Okay, kids, you know what to do. Two... Right, Mom! Three! Aah! Okay, children, on your mark, get set, go! Ow, ow! Stop it, you little brats! Huh? Ow! Oh, there they go, Kronk! They're getting away! Well, I had a great time. Let's not wait until the next family reunion to get together. Kronk! I gotta run. Okay, why does she even have that lever? Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times. Aah! Huh? What does it look like? I don't know. Just keep looking. Over here! It has to be one of these. Lions, tigers, bears... Oh, my. Looking for this? No! It can't be! How did you get back here before us? Uh... How did we, Kronk? Well, you got me. By all accounts, it doesn't make sense. Oh, well, back to business. Okay, I admit it. Maybe I wasn't as nice as I should have been, but, Yzma, do you really want to kill me? Just think of it as you're being let go, that your life's going in a different direction, that your body's part of a permanent outplacement. Hey, that's kind of like what he said to you when you got fired. I know. It's called a cruel irony like my dependence on you. I can't believe this is happening! Then I bet you weren't expecting this. No! Aah! Ahha! Oh, okay. Finish them off. Hey, you're not backing down now, are you, big guy? Uh, where's the other guy? Yo! Sorry I'm late. So, what'd I miss? Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife and asked me to, you know, take them out. Then this guy popped up and we waited for you, and quite honestly... Kronk! Why did I think you could do this? This one simple thing. It's like I'm talking to a monkey. Whoa! Now. A really, really big stupid monkey named Kronk! Ouch. And do you want to know something else? I've never liked your spinach puffs. Never! That's it. She's going down. Now, now, remember, guys. From above, the wicked shall receive their just reward. That'll work. Strange. That usually works. And so does this! Ah, should have seen that coming. Whoa! Aah! Give me that vial! Oof! Ah! Ha ha! Oops! Clumsy me. Which one? Which one? Better hurry. I'm expecting company. Kill them! They murdered the emperor! No, wait! I'm the emperor! It's me... Kuzco! They're not listening to me! Just take 'em all! Get them! Hey, I've been turned into a cow. Can I go home? You're excused. Anyone else? No, we're good. Get them! We've gotta change you back. Try this one. Uh, Pacha? A little help! Come on! Come on! Aah! Oh, please be something with wings. Yeah! We're flyin'! Uhoh. We're not getting anywhere with you picking the vials. I'm picking the next one! Fine by me! Give me that one! Don't you say a word. Quick! Drain the canals! Open up! Yay! I'm a llama again! Wait... There they go! After them! Come on, men! Nobody lives forever! Charge! Grr! Okay, only two left. It's gotta be one of these. Aah! Ah! No! I'll take that. This is the one. This'll change you back to a human. Ow! Hey, get her off! Get her off me! Ohh! Aah! Ow! Drink the potion! Okay, okay. Where did it go? Where is it? Looking for this? Is that my voice? Is that my voice? Oh, well. No! Don't drop it! I'm not going to drop it, you fool! I'm going to drink it! And once I turn back into my beautiful self, I'm going to kill you! Aah! Aah! Uhoh! Whoa! Ohh! Kuzco! Be right there! Give me a minute! Kuzco! Whoa! Kuzco! The vial! For the last time, we did not order a giant trampoline. You know, pal, you could have told me that before I set it up. Aah! Huh? The vial! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? I win. Whoa! Got it! What are the odds of that trapdoor leading me out here? Here, let me get this for you. Well, see ya on the other side. Now, you stop being so hard on yourself. All is forgiven. You're sure? Oh, it's not the first time I was tossed out a window, and it won't be the last. What can I say? I'm a rebel. Whoahoho! Tiger. Oh! Hey, I got to use that arm later. Okay, buddy, take care. He's a sweet guy. So, you lied to me. I did? Yeah. You said when the sun hits this ridge just right, these hills sing. Well, pal, I was dragged all over those hills, and I did not hear any singing. So... I'll be building my summer home on a more magical hill. Thank you. Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool over your eyes, huh? No, no, I'm sharp, I'm on it. Looks like you and your family are stuck on that tuneless hilltop forever, pal. You know, I'm pretty sure I heard some singing on the hill next to us. In case you're interested. Ha! Boom, baby! Ha! Boom, baby! You'd be the coolest dude in the nation Or the hippest cat in creation But if you ain't got friends then nothing's worth the fuss A perfect world will come to be When everybody here can see That a perfect world begins and ends A perfect world begins and ends A perfect world begins and ends with us ""My acorn is missing."" Squeak squeakin' squeak squeakity. ""Did you eat the acorn?"" Squeaker squeak squeak squeakin'? ""You owe me a new acorn."" Squeak squeak squeak squeak squeaker... Squeakin'. I'm so proud of you guys. In the quiet time of evening When the stars assume their patterns And the day has made his journey And we wondered just what happened To the life we knew Before the world changed When not a thing I had Was true But you were kind to me And you reminded me That the world is not my playground There are other things that matter And what is simple needs protecting Or my illusions all would shatter But you stayed In my corner The only world I know was upsidedown And now the world and me We know you carry me You see the patterns in the big sky Those constellations look like you and I Just like the patterns in the big sky We could be lost, we could refuse to try But we made it through In the dark night Who would those lucky guys turn out to be But that unusual blend Of my funny friend and me I'm not as clever as I thought I was I'm not the boy I used to be because You show me somethin' different You show me somethin' pure I always seemed so certain But I was really never sure But you stayed And you called my name When others would have walked out on a lousy game And look who made it through But your funny friend and me You see the patterns in the big sky Yeah, yeah, yeah Those constellations look like you and I That tiny planet and the bigger guy I don't know whether I should laugh or cry Just like the patterns in the big sky We'll be together We'll be together till the end this time You don't know, you don't know Don't know the answer or the reason why We'll stick together We'll stick together till the day we die If I had to do this all a second time I won't complain or make a fuss Who would the angels send But that unlikely blend Of those two funny friends Tha""s us"
The Incredibles,Disney,2000,2004,Animation,"  Is this on? That's fine. I can break through walls, I just can't... That's fine. I can't get this on. Mr. Incredible... Do you have a secret identity? Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, know what I mean? Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something. I said, ""Girl, I don't want to know about your mildmannered alter ego."" I mean, you tell me you're a supermegaultralightningbabe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ""I just cleaned up this mess. ""Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?"" I could get to that point. ""Please?"" We're not finished. Sometimes I think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so.   We interrupt for a bulletin. A highspeed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave. Yeah, I've got time. Mr. Incredible. What is it, ma'am? My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.  Certainly. I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble. No, he's quite tame.      Let go now.  Thank you, Mr. Incredible. You've done it again. You're the best. No, I'm just here to help. All units. We have a tour bus robbery... Tour bus robbery. I've still got time. Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker. Cool! Ready for takeoff! What the... Who are you supposed to be? I'm IncrediBoy. What? No. You're that kid from the fan club. Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy! My name is IncrediBoy. I've been nice, I've stood for photos, signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me... No, don't worry about training me. I know your moves, crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything! I'm your number one fan! Hey! Hey, wait!  You know, you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse, but maybe that's not what you had in mind. Hey, look...  Elastigirl. Mr. Incredible. It's all right. I've got him. Sure, you've got him. I just took him out for you. Sure, you did. His attention was on me. A fact I exploited to do my job. My job, you mean. A simple thank you will suffice. Thanks, but I don't need any help. Whatever happened to ""ladies first""? Well, whatever happened to equal treatment? Look, the lady got me first. Well, we could share, you know. I work alone. Well, I think you need to be more flexible. Are you doing anything later? I have a previous engagement.  Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage in an hour. Hey, Incredible! Hey, Frozone! Shouldn't you be getting ready? I still got time.  He's gonna jump! I think you broke something. With counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me. Wait a minute.    Bomb Voyage. Mr. Incredible...! And IncrediBoy! IncrediBoy? Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast? I have rocket boots. Go home, Buddy. Now. What? Little oaf...! Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you never say which part to be true to. Well, I've finally figured out who I am. I am your ward. IncrediBoy! And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy. This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly? Fly home, Buddy. I work alone. And your outfit is totally ridiculous! Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the police. Buddy, don't! It'll only take a second, really. No, stop! There's a bomb! Let go, you're wrecking my flight pattern. I can do this if you let go! Will you just... I'm trying to help! Stop! Let go of my cape!    Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what he's been doing. I can help you. You're making a mist... The injured jumper. You sent paramedics? They picked him up. The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who I caught robbing the vault. We might nab him if we set up a perimeter. He got away? Well, yeah. Skippy here made sure of that. IncrediBoy. You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late. Listen, I've gotta be somewhere. What about Bomb Voyage? Any other night, I'd go after him, but I really gotta go. Don't worry. We'll get him! Eventually!  Is the night still young? You're very late. How do I look? Good? The mask. You still got the mask.  Showtime. Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? You're late. When you asked if I was doing anything later, I didn't realize you'd forgotten. I thought it was playful banter. It was. Cutting it close, don't you think? You need to be more flexible. I love you, but if we're gonna make this work, you've gotta be more than Mr. Incredible. You know that. Don't you? ...so long as you both shall live? I do. I pronounce this couple husband and wife.   As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens. Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen? In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court. Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. He didn't want to be saved. The injury received from Mr. Incredible's ""actions,"" causes him daily pain. I saved your life! You didn't save my life! You ruined my death. My client has no comment. Another suit was filed by victims of the El train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And opened the floodgates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over. It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away. Under public pressure, and the financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the Superhero Relocation Program. The supers were granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. Denied? You're denying my claim? I don't understand. I have full coverage. I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is spelled out in paragraph 17. It states clearly... I can't pay for this. Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr. I'm calling to celebrate a momentous occasion. We're now officially moved in. Yeah, well, that's great, honey. The last three years don't count because... Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha. Why do we have so much junk? Listen, I've got a client. Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey. Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids. See you tonight. Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we? I'm on a fixed income, and if you can't help me, I don't know what I'll do.   All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but I can't. I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on... Norma Wilcox. WILCOX. On the third floor. But I can't. I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal department on the second floor. I wouldn't expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do. Oh, thank you, young man. Sorry. I know you're upset! Pretend to be upset.  Parr! You authorized payment on the Walker policy! Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. Their policy covers... I don't wanna know about it. Don't tell me about it. Tell me how you're keeping Insuricare in the black. Tell me how that's possible, with you writing checks to every Harry Hardluck and Sally Sobstory that gives you a phone call. Morning break is over. Morning break is over. I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr. What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong? He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class. He says. Look, I know it's you! He puts thumbtacks on my stool. You saw him do this? Well... Not really. No. Actually, not. Oh, then how do you know it was him? I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not! Bernie... Don't ""Bernie"" me. This little rat is guilty! You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble. You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty! Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more constructive outlet. Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports. Honey, you know why we can't do that. I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit. Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. You always say, ""Do your best."" But you don't really mean it. Why can't I do the best that I can do? Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special. Everyone's special, Dash. Which is another way of saying no one is.  Rydinger, where you headed? Hi, Tony. Hey. ""Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"" That's kind of funny. ""Hey, Tony, do you play football?"" Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming. He looked at me.  Come on, Violet!     Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway... Oh, great.   Mom. You're making weird faces again. No, I'm not. You make weird faces, honey. Do you have to read at the table? Uhhuh. Yeah. Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat? Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school?  Well, we dissected a frog. Dash got sent to the office again. Good. Good. No, Bob, that's bad. What? Dash got sent to the office again. What? What for? Nothing. He put a tack on the teacher's chair, during class. Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape. They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast were you going? We are not encouraging this. I'm not, I'm just asking how fast... Honey!  Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table... What happened to the car? Here. I'm getting a new plate. So, how about you, Vi? How was school? Nothing to report. You've hardly touched your food. I'm not hungry for meatloaf. Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta... What are you hungry for? Tony Rydinger. Shut up. Well, you are. I said, shut up, you little insect. Well, she is. Do not shout at the table. Honey! Kids! Listen to your mother. She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf. That's it! Stop it! You're gonna be toast! Stop running in the house. Sit down! Hey, no force fields! You started it. You sit down! You sit down! Violet!   ""Simon J. Paladino, ""longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing""? Gazerbeam. Bob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand there! I need you to intervene! You want me to intervene? Okay. I'm intervening!  Violet, let go of your brother. Hello? Get the door. Hey, Lucius! Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, JackJack. Ice of you to drop by. Ha! Never heard that one before. Lucius! Whoa! Ha, ha. Oh! I like it when it shatters. I'll be back later. Where are you two going? It's Wednesday. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius. Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids. Don't think you've avoided talking about the principal's office. Your father and I are still gonna discuss it. I'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office. Other kids don't have superpowers. Now, it's perfectly normal... What do you know about normal? What does anyone in this family know about normal? Now, wait a minute, young lady. We act normal. I wanna be normal. The only normal one is JackJack, and he's not even toilet trained.  Lucky. I meant about being normal.  So now I'm in deep trouble. I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and I'm an epitaph. Somehow I managed to find cover. What does Baron Von Ruthless do? He starts monologuing. He starts monologuing. He starts this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, the world will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada. Yammering. Yammering. I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up. Municiberg, we have a 2356... 2356, what is that? Robbery? This is just sad. Want to catch a robber? No. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up. He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just talking. What are we doing here? Protecting people. Nobody asked us. You need an invitation? I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and... You remember Gazerbeam? There was something in the paper. He had trouble with civilian life. When did you see him? I don't see anyone from the old days. Just you. And we're pushing our luck as it is. Come on. It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this... We have a report on a fire... A fire. We're close! Yeah, baby! We're gonna get caught.  Fire! Yeah! Is that everybody? Yeah. It better be. Can't you put this out? I can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too fast! What's that mean? It means it's hot. I'm dehydrated, Bob. You're out of ice? You can't run out. You can use water in the air. There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out of muscle? I can't smash walls. The building's getting weaker. It's gonna come down on top of us. I wanted to go bowling! All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot!  Yeah.  Uhoh. Oh, good.   That ain't right. We look like incompetent bad guys! You can get water out of the air. Freeze! I'm thirsty. I said freeze! I'm just getting a drink. You've had your drink. Now... I know. I know. Freeze.  Police officers! That was way too close. We are not doing that again. Verify you want to switch targets? Over. Trust me. This is the one he's been looking for.   I thought you'd be back by 11:00. I said I'd be back later. I assumed you'd be back later. If you came back at all, you'd be ""back later"". Well, I'm back, okay? Is this rubble? It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose. You know how I feel about that. Darn you! We can't blow cover again. The building was coming down anyway. What? You knocked down a building? It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down. Have you been listening to the police scanner again? I performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing. It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a bad thing. It's better than acting like they didn't happen! Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation. It's not a graduation. He's moving from fourth to fifth grade. It's a ceremony! It's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is exceptional... This is not about you, Bob. It's about Dash. You want to do something for Dash? Let him actually compete. Let him go out for sports! I will not be made the enemy! You know why we can't do that. Because he'd be great. This is not about you! All right, Dash. I know you're listening. Come on out. Vi? You, too, young lady. Come on. Come on out. It's okay, kids. We're just having a discussion. Pretty loud discussion. But that's okay. What's important is that Mommy and I are a team. We're united, uh, against forces of... Pigheadedness? I was gonna say evil. We're sorry we woke you. Everything's okay. Go back to bed. It's late. Good night, Mom. Night, Dad. Good night. In fact, we should all be in bed.   Request claim on claim numbers 158183... Haven't you got him yet? Where is he? Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office. Now? Now.  Sit down, Bob. I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. Ask me why. Okay. Why? Why what? Be specific, Bob. Why are you unhappy? Your customers make me unhappy. What, you've gotten complaints? Complaints I can handle. What I can't handle is your customers' inexplicable knowledge of Insuricare's inner workings! They're experts. Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle! They're penetrating the bureaucracy! Did I do something illegal? No. We shouldn't help our customers? The law requires that I answer no. We're supposed to help people. Help our people! Starting with our stockholders. Who's helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company... Is like an enormous clock. ...is like an enormous... Yes. Precisely. It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, welllubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. I'm being metaphorical, Bob. Know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr. That man out there, he needs help. Don't change the subject. We're discussing your attitude. He is getting mugged! Well, let's hope we don't cover him. I'll be right back. Stop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over here, now. I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. He got away. Good thing, too. You were this close to losing your...  Uhoh. Please report to operating room 722 immediately. How is he? He'll live. I'm fired, aren't I? You think? What can I say, Rick? Nothing you haven't said before. Someone was in trouble. Always. I had to do something. Every time you say that, it's a month and a half of trouble for me. Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's dollars. I know. We pay to keep the company quiet. We pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder. Money, money, money. We can't keep doing this. We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, you're on your own. Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you know, for old times' sake. I can't do that to my family. Everyone just got settled. I'll make it work. Thanks. Take care of yourself. What are you waiting for? I don't know. Something amazing, I guess. Me, too, kid.    Huh? ""Hold still""? Match, Mr. Incredible. Room is secure. Commence message. Hello, Mr. Incredible. Yes, we know who you are. Rest assured, your secret is safe with us. My name is Mirage. We have something in common. According to the government, neither of us exist. Please pay attention, as this message is classified and will not be repeated.

What? Dinner's ready. Okay. ...it is contained within an isolated area, it threatens to cause incalculable damage to itself and our facilities, jeopardizing hundreds of millions of dollars... Is someone in there? It's the TV, trying to watch. Because of its sensitive nature... Stop. It's time for dinner. One minute! If you accept, your payment will be triple your current annual salary. Call the number on the card. Voicematching will ensure security. The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible. You're still here. You can still do great things. Or you can listen to police scanners.

I know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating. I just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway. Honey? About the job? What? Something's happened. What? The, uh... What? The company is sending me to, uh, a conference. A conference? Out of town. I'm gonna be gone for a few days. They've never sent you to a conference before. This is good, isn't it? Yes. You see? They're finally recognizing your talents. You're moving up. Yes. Honey! This is wonderful! Yes, it is.  Hello? This is Mr. Incredible. I'm in. The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. Its artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted with. And, unfortunately... Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders. We lost control. Now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety. How am I going in? The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5,000 feet. Its cloaking devices make it difficult to track. We're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment. You want me to shut it down without destroying it. You are Mr. Incredible. I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot. Every moment you fight it increases its knowledge of how to beat you. Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don't destroy it. And don't die. Great. Thanks.  Showtime.    Huh? Hmm.    Uhoh.   Oh, my back!  Oh! Surprising. We must bring him back. Sound the all clear, and invite him to dinner.  Most important, keep things light. Praise him. Make him feel like we appreciate his abilities. Am I overdressed? Actually, you look rather dashing. I take it our host is... I'm sorry. He won't be dining with us. He hopes you'll understand. Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who I'm working for. He prefers a certain amount of anonymity. Surely, you of all people understand that. I was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why live... With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am I. It's a weakness we share. Seems a bit unstable. I prefer to think of it as misunderstood. Aren't we all? Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare? Everything's delicious. Jeez. Hurry, honey. Or you'll be late for work. Have a great day, honey. Thanks. Help customers, climb ladders... Bring bacon. All that jazz.  You have an appointment? I'm an old friend. I just wanted to... All visitors are required... Go check the electric fence. What is it? Who are you? What do you want? My God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come. Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all. Weren't you in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague? Milan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call. E, I just need a patch job. Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work? Must have happened a long time ago. I see. This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? What do you mean? You designed it. I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You need a new suit. That much is certain. A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit? You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy. So ask me now, before I again become sane. Wait. You want to make me a suit? You push too hard, darling! But I accept. It will be bold. Dramatic! Yeah. Heroic! Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots... No capes! Isn't that my decision? Do you remember Thunderhead? Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids. Listen, E... November 15th of '58. All was well, another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin. Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb... Stratogale! April 23rd, '57. Cape caught in a jet turbine. You can't generalize about these things. MetaMan. Express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on takeoff. Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes! Now, go on. Your new suit will be finished before your next assignment. You know I'm retired from hero work. As am I, Robert. Yet, here we are. E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons. Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit. You're the best of the best, E. Yes, I know, darling. I know.  Don't answer it, honey, I got it! Hello? We have a new assignment for you. How soon can you get here? I'll leave tomorrow morning. See you there. Goodbye. Who was that, honey? The, uh, office? Another conference. Short notice, but, you know, duty calls.  Bob? Yeah, what's up, honey? Ha... Have a great trip. Thanks, sweetie. I'll call you when I get there. I love you. So much. I love you, too. This is your automated Captain. Would you care for more mimosa? Don't mind if I do. Thanks. You're welcome. Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying. Please fasten your seat belt. We're beginning our descent. Hello, Mr. Incredible. Nice suit. Thanks. Nice to be back, Mirage. You'll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at 2:00. D Wing, room A113. 2:00. Got it. See you there. Edna. I'd like to speak to Edna, please. This is Edna. E? This is Helen. Helen who? Helen Parr? You know... Elastigirl? Darling! It's been such a long time after all these years! So long! It's been a while. There's only one person Bob would trust to patch his supersuit. That's you. Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it? Much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear. They are finished. When are you coming to see? I'm calling about... Don't make me beg. I won't do it, you know. Beg? No, I'm calling about suit. Bob's suit! I'm calling about Bob's suit. You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye. Hmm.  It's bigger! It's badder! Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. Incredible! It's finally ready. You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but, man, it wasn't good enough! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan. Buddy? My name is not Buddy! And it's not IncrediBoy either! That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you. I only wanted to help! And what did you say to me? Fly home, Buddy. I work alone. It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson. You can't count on anyone. Especially your heroes. I was wrong to treat you that way. I'm sorry. See? Now you respect me, because I'm a threat. That's the way it works. There's a lot of people, whole countries who want respect. And they will pay through the nose to get it. How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons. Now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, I'll get... You sly dog! You got me monologuing. I can't believe it. It's cool, huh? Zeropoint energy. I save the best inventions for myself. Am I good enough now? Who's super now? I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and... Oh, brilliant!  All right, try this one on for size, big boy.  Gazerbeam. Kronos? Life reading negative. Mr. Incredible terminated. This project has completely confiscated my life, darling. Consumed me as only hero work can. My best work, I must admit. Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die. E, I just... I did Robert's suit, and it turned out so beautiful, I had to continue. It's great to see you, but I have no idea what you're talking about. I just... Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble. Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show you my work. That is why you are here. Edna Mode. And guest. Come. Sit. Cream and sugar? Thanks. I started with the baby. Started? Shh! Darling! I cut it a little roomy for the free movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, And can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof. And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature. What on earth do you think the baby will be doing? Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling. Luck favors the prepared. I didn't know the baby's powers, so I covered the basics. JackJack doesn't have any powers. No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature. Your daughter's suit was tricky. I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible, yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think? What do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired! Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back? Well, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he keep secrets from you? He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't. Men at Robert's age are often unstable. Prone to weakness. What are you saying? Do you know where he is? Of course. Do you know where he is?     Hey, hey. We got a man down! Come on, let's go. Are you okay? What happened? Break surveillance and engage. Continuing sweep... Insuricare. Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr. Bob Parr is my husband. I was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel he's staying at? The number I have is no good. Mr. Parr no longer works here. What do you mean? He's on a business trip. A company retreat. My records say he was terminated almost two months ago.  So, you don't know where he is. Would you like to find out?   I am such an idiot. I let this happen, you know. The new sports car, the getting in shape, the blond hair, the lies. Yes, he attempts to relive the past. Now I'm losing him! What'll I do? What'll I do? What are you talking about? You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself together. What will you do? Is this a question? Show him you remember that he is Mr. Incredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well, you know where he is. Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win! And call me when you get back, darling. I enjoy our visits. There's lots of leftovers that you can reheat. Make sure Dash does his homework. And both of you, get to bed on time. I should be back tonight. Late. You can be in charge that long, can't you? Yeah. But why am I in charge again? Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy. You mean Dad's in trouble, or Dad is the trouble? I mean either he's in trouble, or he's going to be. What's that? Where'd you get that, Mom? You made a cool outfit? Hey, are those for us? We all get cool outfits? Dash! You come back here this moment!  Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could... What are these? Look, I'm The Dash! The Dash likes. Just a second. Take that off before somebody sees. You're packing one just like it. Are you hiding something? Please. I'm on the phone... Dash! This is yours. It's specially made. What's going on? You're not coming! I gotta pack! What makes you think it's special? I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it? Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me. What do you need? A jet. What do you got that's fast? Let me think. Island approach. India Golf ninerniner checking in. VFR on top. Over.  Island tower, this is India Golf ninerniner requesting vectors to the initial.  Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. You're overreacting. Everything's fine. They're just all getting coffee. At the same time. Yeah. You, sir, truly are ""Mr. Incredible."" I was right to idolize you. I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man! I'm still geeking out about it!  And then you had to just go and ruin the ride. I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help? ""Help me, help me."" Lame, lame, lame. All right, who did you contact? Contact? What are you talking about?  I am referring to last night at 23:07 hours while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal. I didn't know about the homing device. And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here. Who did you contact? I didn't send for a plane. Play the transmission. India Golf checking in. Helen! So you do know these people. Well, then, I'll send them a little greeting. Ow! Violet! It's not my fault. Dash ran away, I knew I'd get blamed for it. That's not true! You said, ""Something's up with Mom. We have to find out what."" ...and it's not my fault! Hundred percent allyours idea! Wait a minute. You left JackJack alone? Of course we got a sitter. We got someone, Mom. We wouldn't do that. Thanks a lot! All right, well, who'd you get? You don't have to worry about one thing. I've got babysitting wired. I've taken courses, learned CPR, excellent marks and certificates. Kari. I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter. Kari... The beauty is they don't have to listen 'cause they're asleep! I wish my parents played Mozart because half the time I don't know what anyone's talking about. Kari, I really don't feel comfortable with this. I'll pay you for your trouble, but I'd rather call a service. There's really no need, Mrs. Parr. I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out. Can't I, little baby? I can handle it. Who can handle it?  India Golf ninerniner transmitting in the blind guard. Disengage. Repeat, disengage. Repeat, disengage. Friendlies... No! Call off the missiles. I'll do anything. Too late. Fifteen years too late. Friendlies twozero miles southsouthwest of your position. Angels 10. Track east. Disengage. Vi! Put a force field around the plane. You said not to use our powers. I know what I said. Listen to what I'm saying now! Disengage. Repeat, disengage! Mom? Violet! Mayday. India Golf ninerniner is buddyspiked. Abort! There are children aboard. There are children aboard! No! Put a field around us now! I've never done one that big. Do it now! Abort, abort, abort!  Brace yourselves! Mom! Everybody calm down. I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. We're not gonna panic, we're not... Look out! Oh, my God! Whose idea was this? What are we gonna do? We're dead! We're dead! It blew up! We survived but we're dead! Stop it! We are not gonna die! Both of you will get a grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month! Understand? We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed. Ah, you'll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to ""work alone.""  Release me. Now! Or what? I'll crush her. That sounds a little dark for you. Well, go ahead. It'll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick. Show me. I knew you couldn't do it. Even when you have nothing to lose. You're weak. And I've outgrown you.  Those were shortrange missiles. Landbased. That way is our best bet. You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us? If it means land, yes. Do you expect us to swim there? I expect you to trust me.   What a trooper. I'm so proud of you. Thanks, Mom. I think your father is in trouble. If you haven't noticed, we're not doing so hot either. I'm going to look for him. And that means you're in charge until I get back, Violet. What? You heard her. Put these on. Your identity is your most valuable possession. Protect it. And if anything goes wrong, use your powers. But you said never to use... I know what I said! Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like those guys. They won't exercise restraint because you're children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance. Mom? Vi, I'm counting on you. There's... I'm counting on you. Be strong. Dash, if anything goes wrong, I want you to run as fast as you can. As fast as I can? As fast as you can. Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. I'll be back by morning. Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry. I wanted to help. When you asked me to... I'm sorry. Shh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't think. And don't worry. If the time comes, you'll know what to do. It's in your blood. He's not weak, you know. What? Valuing life is not weakness. Hey. Look, if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control. And disregarding it is not strength. I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all. I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually... Next time you gamble, bet your own life! Okay, okay, okay.  A rocket?  Hey!  Well, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around. What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, their marriage. Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad's marriage. Forget it. You're so immature. I'm gonna go look around. Mom said to stay hidden. I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh.  Cool! Roger. We are ready for launch. Vi, Vi! What did you do? ETA twoniner. Over. TCI clear. Condition yellow. Status norm. Not responding to IFF. IRCM reads negative. Bob. What? I didn't say anything.   Identification, please. Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look. It talks! What? What? There. That one. Voice key incorrect. ""Voice key""? Voice key incorrect. Wait a second.  What do we do? Run! Where are we going? Away from here! Intruder alert. There isn't much time. No, there isn't. In fact, there's no time at all.  Please... Why are you here? How can you possibly bring me lower? What more can you take away from me? Family survived the crash. They're here on the island! They're alive?  Helen? Hello. You must be Mrs... She was helping me to escape. No. That's what I was doing. Let go of me! Let go, you lousy, lying, unfaithful creep! How could I betray the perfect woman? Oh, you're referring to me now? Where are the kids? They triggered the alert. What? Security's in the jungle. Get going. Our kids are in danger? If you suspected danger, why'd you bring them? They stowed away. You're not striking the proper tone. Think they're supers? Dash, remember what Mom said. What? Stop talking! Hold it! Freeze! Dash, run! What? Run! They're supers! Get the boy! Show yourself!   Hey! Ha, ha! I'm alive. Yeah!  Uhoh.  I should've told you I was fired, I admit it. But I didn't want you to worry. You didn't want me to worry? We're running for our lives through some godforsaken jungle. You keep trying to pick a fight, but I'm just happy you're alive. I know you're there, Little Miss Disappear. You can't hide from me. There you are. Hey! Don't touch my sister! How are you doing that? I don't know! Whatever you do, don't stop!  Mom! Dad! Hey! Kids. You're all right. You're all right. We were so worried. I thought I'd never see you again. I love you. Wow. Whoa. Time out! What have we here? Matching uniforms? Oh, no! Elastigirl?  You married Elastigirl? Whoa! And got busy! It's a whole family of supers. Looks like I've hit the jackpot! Oh, this is just too good! The ship's unique design... There were no fatalities... Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were! You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one? Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it without your precious gifts, your ohsospecial powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super no one will be.   Fire at will! It's overwhelming the tanks. I'm sorry. This is my fault. I've been a lousy father. Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued that I undervalued all of you. Dad? Shh. Don't interrupt. So caught up in the past that I... You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely if I... Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think it's time we wind down now. We need to get back to the mainland. I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead.  Where are all the guards? Go, go! Hey, every time they run, you take a shot.   This is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets. A jet's not fast enough. What's faster than a jet? How about a rocket? Great! I can't fly a rocket. You don't have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch. Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now. How do I get into the computer? Say please. Honey? What? Where is my supersuit? What? Where is my supersuit? I put it away. Where? Why do you need to know? I need it! Don't you think about running off doing no derrin'do. We've been planning this dinner for two months! The public is in danger! My evening's in danger! Tell me where my suit is, woman! We are talking about the greater good. ""Greater good""? I am your wife! I'm the greatest good you are ever gonna get! Run! My baby! The supers have returned! Is that Fironic? Fironic? No, Fironic has a different outfit. No, no, I'm a new superhero! I'm Syndrome! All right, stand back. Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal a few manners. Ha, ha!  Are we there yet? We get there when we get there. How you doing, honey? Do I have to answer? Kids, strap yourselves down like I told you. Here we go, honey. Ready, Violet? Ready? Now! This is gonna be rough. Robot's in the financial district. Which exit? Traction Avenue. That'll take me downtown. I take Seventh, don't I? Don't take Seventh! Great, we missed it. Ask how to get there, I told you. Traction. That'll take me downtown. Get in the right lane! Signal! Not Traction! You're gonna miss it! Is everybody okay back there? Superduper, Dad! Let's do that again.  Wait here and stay hidden. I'm going in. While what? I watch helplessly from the sidelines? I don't think so. I'm asking you to wait with the kids. And I'm telling you not a chance. You're my husband. I'm with you for better or worse. I have to do this alone. What is this to you? Playtime? No. So you can be Mr. Incredible again? No! Then what? I'm not... Not what? I'm not strong enough. This will make you stronger? Yes. No! That's what this is? Some sort of workout? I can't lose you again! I can't. Not again. I'm not strong enough. If we work together, you won't have to be. I don't know what'll happen. We're superheroes. What can happen?  Vi! Dash! No! Violet? Dad! Go, go! I'm okay, Mom. Really. Stay here, okay? Frozone! Yeah! Bob! Hey! Syndrome's remote! The remote controls the robot! Throw it, throw it! Go long! Got it! Honey, take out its guns! Gotcha!  Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote! A remote? A remote that controls what? The robot? It's coming back!  That wasn't right. Give me that! We can't stop it. The only thing hard enough to penetrate it is itself. It's getting closer! It doesn't work! Kids! It's not doing anything. Try to buy us some time. Try the one next to it. Honey! Wait a minute. Press that button again! No, the other one! The first one! First button! Got it! It's getting closer! Look out! Get out of here! We're not going anywhere. Press the button! Not yet! Helen! What are you waiting for? A closer target! You got one shot! Everybody duck! Hey, Zone.  Huh? No! Did you see that? That's the way to do it. That's old school. Yeah. No school like the old school. Just like old times. Oh! Just like old times. Yeah. Hurt then, too. We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets. If he even sneezes, we'll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs. The people of this country are indebted to you. Does this mean we can come out of hiding? Let the politicians figure that one out. I've been asked to assure you we'll take care of everything else. You did good, Bob.  Hi, this is Kari. I have a question about JackJack... Come on. We're in a limo. Hey, you're wearing your hair back? Yeah, I just... Yeah. It looks good. Thanks, Dad. That was cool when you threw that car! Not as cool as you running on water. That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm and whiplashed him into the other guy. Sweet! I'm trying to listen to messages. It's me. JackJack is fine, but weird things are happening. JackJack's still fine, but I'm getting really weirded out! When are you coming back? ...aced those guys that tried to kill us! That was the best vacation ever! I love our family. I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr! Put that down! Stop it! You need to call me. I need help, Mrs... Bob, listen to this. I'm gonna call the police... Hi, this is Kari. Sorry for freaking out, but your baby has special needs. Thanks for sending a replacement. I didn't call a replacement. Shh. The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I'm simply returning the favor. Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren't. And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. He's getting away, Bob! We have to do something now.  What's happening? Stop him! Throw something! I might hit JackJack. Throw me. Bob, throw me!  No! This isn't the end of it! I will get your son, eventually. I'll get your son! Oh, no. Look at Mommy, honey. Don't look down. Mommy's got you. Everything is all right. That's my girl. Does this mean we have to move again?  Oh, man. That was totally wicked!   Do we have to have cheerleaders at the track meet? What is that all about? I always thought it was more... Hey. Hey. You're, uh, Violet, right? That's me. See you, Vi. You look different. I feel different. Is different okay? Hey, different is...  Different is great. Would you... Yeah? Do you think maybe... ... you and I... Yeah? Do you... Shh. I like movies. I'll buy the popcorn. Okay? A movie. There you go. Yeah. Wait, so Friday? Friday.  Go, Dash, go. Run! Come on, run! Pick up the pace. Run! Pull back, pull back! Pace it. Slow down just a little bit. Make it close! Second. Close second, yeah! That's my boy! Dash, I'm so proud of you. I didn't know what the heck you wanted me to do.  Behold the Underminer! I am always beneath you, but nothing is beneath me! I hereby declare war on peace and happiness! Soon all will tremble before me!"
The Jungle Book 2,Disney,2000,2003,Animation," Hooray! Mowgli!  Ranjan, hush. It's starting.  Come, children. Come watch.  Mowgli, tell us your story. I never knew where I came from, but I always knew where I belonged. This is me and Bagheera, the panther who found me in the jungle. He's a good friend of mine. But my best friend of all was good old Papa Bear. Man, we had some crazy times together. And when the monkeys grabbed me, things got really crazy. Monkey!  Go, Papa Bear! Then, I came face to face with the meanest, scariest tiger in the whole jungle. Shere Khan.  You stay away from Mowgli, you mean, old tiger. Or I'll tie some fire to your tail and burn your butt!   Ranjan! Whoa!    Oh, Ranjan.  I got him, Mowgli! Did you see? I got him. You sure did, Ranjan, but it's gonna be kind of hard to finish the story now. But we all know how it ends. Shanti blinks her big, beautiful brown eyes at you, and you followed her into our village. I did not. Did so. Something was in my eye. Both of them? Well, you were so ugly you made my eyes water. Well, you... Now, now. We give thanks for Shanti's beautiful brown eyes. Without them, Mowgli would never have found his way into our lives. Come to think of it, you used the same trick on me. And you still fall for it.  Thank you for a wonderful story, Mowgli. Good night, Mowgli. Night, Shanti. Watch out for Shere Khan on your way home. You and your stories. Everyone knows tigers don't come into the village.  Tigers go wherever they want!  Ooh!  Good night, boys.  Tomorrow's gonna be so great. What happens tomorrow? Um... Nothing. Nothing. Aha. Well, then, you will need plenty of rest for doing nothing tomorrow. Off to bed.  We never get to stay up late.  Even wild beasts need their sleep.  Oh, help! Ferocious tiger!  Ah, good night, my little wild thing.  Good night, Mowgli. Happy dreams. Um, good night... Sir. Why do you always call him ""Sir""? His name's ""Pa.""     Hmm.      Whoa! Come on, Mowgli! Wake up, it's morning! You said we would go to... Ranjan! Ranjan! Do you wanna wake up the whole village? When does the tiger roar?  I don't know. After he catches his prey. His prey. Let's go get our prey.  Boys. Huh? Where are you going so early? To do our chores? Yeah! Not without breakfast, you aren't.   That's okay. We're not hungry. Gotta go! Ooh! Boys, where are you going? To do our chores! Bye, Papa! See you later! Remember, don't cross the river!  You can take the boy out of the jungle... But you can't take the jungle out of the boy. Yes. That's what worries me.   Hey, Shanti.  What are you doing here? Getting water. What are you doing here? Oh, uh, I'm on the lookout for danger. Danger? Please. There's no danger around here. Uh...  Well, uh, keep this just between us? Yesterday, I saw tiger tracks. Tiger tracks? Right. It's Shere Khan. I hear he's looking for me, seeking his bloodthirsty revenge. So keep your ears open and always watch your back, or the last thing you'll ever hear is...     When does the tiger roar?  Oh! You're horrible! Horrible, stinky boys! Come on, Ranjan. He's a bad influence.  Now, don't move. That wasn't very nice, you know.  Stop that. You're not a jungle boy. Why are you so scared of the jungle? Because it's dangerous. Dangerous? But Mowgli says... You shouldn't listen to everything Mowgli says. But I thought you liked Mowgli. Well, I do. I like Mowgli. But I... Oh. Ooh. Uh, you left this at the river.  Thank you. She's in a bad mood. Hey, Ranjan, you want to see a little trick I learned in the jungle? Mmm. That's a pretty good trick. Well, here's a little trick I learned right here at home. Wow. That's a neater trick. Like I said, Ranjan, don't listen to him. Blah, blah, blah, blah. She's right, Ranjan, don't listen to me.  Listen to the jungle. Can you hear it? Yeah. The jungle.  Yeah, man! And when you hear that rhythm, you get a crazy feeling inside. That morning sun peeks over the mountains And all the rhinos rub their eyes When they hear Hear what?

It's too dangerous! Mowgli! Stop!   Shanti, what is it? Children, come inside this instant, all of you! Mowgli! That includes you! I am very disappointed in you. You put everyone in danger. You know that you're not allowed to cross the river, and yet you deliberately disobeyed me. But I... No, Mowgli. The jungle is a dangerous place. I should know.   You are confined to your room without dinner. That should give you plenty of time to think about what you've done. Mowgli, I was only trying to...  Oh, you can hightail it out of the jungle But it never leaves your heart Oh, Baloo.  Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Forget about your worries and your strife Yeah, I mean the bumbadadadadeedada The rumpumpata reetata That bring the bare necessities of life Now, that's more like it!  Look at you! Aw, growing like a proverbial weed. Let's see if you still got it. Take it away, Little Britches. Poor fellow. I said, take it away!  Oh. This ain't gonna work. You just ain't Mowgli. Ah, I guess I gotta get used to singing solo. He's just not getting over that...  Oh, no, not again! Baloo!   Mowgli...  Huh? Hmm...   Get out of here! Shoo! Shoo!  Now... Now, don't worry. I'll take care of it. Baloo? Oh, man. Bagheera. How's it wagging?  This has to stop. You can't keep trying to take Mowgli from the manvillage. The boy's future lies with his own kind. Aw, his future can wait. I miss my bear cub.  It's not safe for him in the jungle. You know Shere Khan is looking for Mowgli. Just let Shere Khan try something. We handled old Stripes once. We'll do it again. Baloo, don't push your luck. Out of the way, Baghee. You're not going near the village!  Oh!  Later, Baghee. That's it! Hathi! Plan B!  Hup, two, three, four! Keep it up, two, three, four! Now, remember, men, our objective is full and complete containment. Prepare for Operation... Uh, Oper... Um, Stop that Bear? Very good, son! Yes. Prepare for Operation Stop that Bear!   By the ranks or single file  Over every jungle mile Run, Baghee! You're in the parade ground.  Oh! No, please, stop! Company, halt!  Huh? I told you, Baloo, there's no way we're letting you near the manvillage. You ain't gonna stop me now, Baghee. Look out below! Search the water! Follow me. This way. Nothing here, sir.   Baloo! Check over there!    I've got him, Colonel!  Confound it, soldier! That's a fish! Oopsy. Disgrace to the uniform.   Colonel! This log can't possibly support your weight!  Balderdash! Why, my dear boy, back in '88...  ...in service to the Crown, I found myself straddling a... Oh, no, not again.  Whoa! Oh, no, no.   Well, they don't make trees like they used to. Got him! Got him right here.  Ahha! Disguised as a panther, Baloo. It's me, Hathi! Put me down! Sorry.  Whoa! Keep searching, men. Couldn't have gone far!  Who are we looking for, anyway? Oh, Confound it, man!   Don't turn me in, little guy. I just want to see my bear cub. I won't. I miss Mowgli, too. This way, quick! Hey, thanks, kid. You're all right.  Say, fellas, look who's coming. That's Shere Khan. What we gonna do? Don't start that again. Lucky. Hey, Lucky. Yeah? That's the one we told you about, Shere Khan. Mmm. Shere Khan. You don't say. Hey, watch this, watch this. I got one for you. Check this out. Hey, hey! Look at me! Look at me! Hey! Whoa! I'm Shere Khan, and me tiger tush has been torched.  Ask me if I could whoop that tiger. Go on, go on, ask me. Can you whoop that tiger? I Shere Khan.  Did you get it? Did you get it? Save me! Save me! I've been outwitted by 40 pounds of scrawny mancub.   I'm cracking myself up here. I don't know how I do it.                  Hiya, kid!  Mind if I drop in? Baloo?  Oh, Bal...    Ah. Papa Bear! Boy, am I glad to see you! What are you doing here?  What am I doing here? Feeling right for the first time in a while, that's what.  Hey, kid, show me you can still fight like a bear. Come on. Aah! Oh, Little Britches, you lost your touch. Mowgli. I've got something for you. Mowgli, it's me. Don't be mad. I get grounded all the time. Ah.  Mowgli, I'm sorry you got in trouble. Come on, mancub, show yourself.  Come on! Come on! Whoa! Mowgli?  Wait. No! No!  Oh! Come on, stick and move. Whoa! Whoa!   Help! Wild animal! Wild animal? Where? Come on, let's get outta here. Help! What? What is it? What's that bear doing here? There's a wild animal in the village. What is the matter? There he is! There's a tiger! Where are you going? No, come back! Come back! You're going the wrong way. Wow, a tiger!   Don't let him get away!    No! Uh, please... We gotta get out of here. Shanti, get indoors! No, no, no, he's over... No! Shanti! Shanti, wait for me!   Come on, come on. Follow me! Follow me!   Mowgli!  Hold on, Mowgli!  Shanti? Shanti? Hmm.  Mowgli? Shanti!  Where are you? Mowgli! They must be in the jungle. Ah.  The jungle. What a weird scene. Is that place always like that? You don't know the half of it. That village was terrible. All you ever hear is rules, rules, rules and work, work, work. Whoa, kid. Watch your language. That's all they do! Washing, dressing... Oh, man, I'm tired just listening to it. Sounds like they're kinda screwy over there. I don't want to talk about it. Especially Shanti. Who's Shanti? Ah, she's just a girl from the village. Now, hold on. Not the one that lured you into that village in the first place. Yep, that's the one. I knew it, I knew it. I knew she was trouble. I even tried bringing her to the jungle, and she got me in trouble. Say again? I just wanted her to see how much fun we have. And she got you into trouble for that? Yep. Ooh, man. She thinks the jungle is a scary place. Where'd she get that crazy idea? You got me. Mmm. Do my snake eyes deceive me? Ooh. It's the succulent mancub. Mmm. Well, you're with me now, kid. Forget that girl. You're better off without her. You got everything you need right here. And me, I've got my old singin' partner back. Then hit it, Papa Bear.  Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Forget about your worries and your strife I mean the bare necessities Old Mother Nature's recipes That bring the bare necessities of life Wherever I wander Where you goin'? Wherever I roam Oh, yeah. I couldn't be fonder of my big home The bees are buzzing in the tree To make some honey just for me When you look under the rocks and plants Take a glance at the fancy ants And maybe try a few Thanks, Baloo.  The bare necessities of life will come to you They'll come to you Oh, Baloo. I don't ever want to see that girl or that village again. Well, of course you don't. It's just us bears from here on in. Yeah, man. Hey, you remember everything I learned ya? You bet I do, Papa Bear. Nuhuhuh. Huh? Now, when you pick a pawpaw Or a prickly pear And you pick a raw paw Well, next time beware Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw When you pick a pear try to use the claw But you don't need to use the claw When you pick a pair of the big pawpaw Have I given you a clue? The bare necessities of life will come to you They'll come to you They'll come to me? I so despise these songanddance routines.  Mowgli! Mowgli? Is that you? Mowgli?   He's gotta be here somewhere.         Oh, oh, oh. I swear... I shall never again associate...  ...with mancubs. Oh!  Oh. Oh, where could he be?   Mmm.   Why, the little...    Snack.    Who is it? Who's there?    Excuse me. Might I be of some assistance?  Hmm? Are you lost, little one? Are you hungry? I'm starved.    Bad snake! Bad snake! Ranjan? What are you doing here? You leave Shanti alone!    Okay, Ranjan. I... I think he's had enough.   Oh! Oh!  You're not getting away that easy. Oh, Ranjan, what are you doing? You're not supposed to be here. We have to get you home right now. No! Mowgli's in trouble, and we're going to find him.  I can smell him. He's this way. Oh, okay, but stay close. We don't want to run into any more scary animals.  Oh, stop that.  Oh, mercy.   Shere Khan?  Anyone I know? I wish. Aw, stupid mancub.  Mancub? Uh... Did... Did I say mancub? Well, well, I... I... You know... I'd love to stay and shoot the breeze and all, but... What's your hurry?  Uh, no reason. I... I... Oh! Where is he? Who he? The mancub Mowgli. I know you know.  Well, but I... I don't. Oh, please don't insult my intelligence. It makes me irritable. Oh, he's not in the village.  I know where he isn't.  Now, tell me where he is. Well, he's... He's... He's... The swamp! He's at the swamp, yes. Hmm. The swamp, eh? Yes. Trust in me.  Hmm. He'd better be, for your sake. He is, he is! I'd... I'd take you there myself, but I'm afraid I'd slow you down, indigestion and all.  Mowgli! Ranjan!   Huh? What?  Huh?  What is... What on earth?  Retreat!     Colonel Hathi! Take cover! Oh, no! Not again.    Whoa!  Excuse me. Pardon. Colonel Hathi, what... What is the meaning of this? Man is in the jungle! What... What does he want? Think they'll come out? I think they're over here. Mowgli! Oh. Perhaps I was too harsh with the boy. Don't worry. We'll find them. Children, can you hear me? Mowgli! Ranjan! Baloo.  Almost got it, Baloo. Alleyoop! Whoa!  Whoa! Ah, them primo mangos, always the hardest to get. Got 'em.   Ah, this is the life. Heads up.  Ah. Delicious. Hey, check this out. Hmm.  Hey, not bad. Where'd you learn to do that? Shanti showed me. Shanti?  I... No, I... I said wanti. I wanti another mango.  No, no, no, that's not what you said. You said Shanti. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. Did. Didn't. Did. Uhhuh. Didn't. Uhuh. Yep. I heard it. Uhuh. You know what? Who cares about Shanti? Because it's just a stupid trick, right?  Yeah, right. You don't need her, kid. You're with old Baloo now.  What are you laughing at?  What are you doin' out here, Baghee?  Haven't you heard? Man is in the jungle.  What do they want? They're searching for Mowgli. Mowgli? I thought that perhaps maybe you have seen the boy. Me? Uh, no. Ha. Well, you know his future is in that village. Yes. I just wish I knew where he was. Yeah. Whew, sorry. Huh! Man, wish I could help you out, Baghee. Oh! Enough games, Baloo. Now give me the boy. Baghee, Baghee, Baghee, Baghee. I can explain. I can explain. I... Can explain, but I don't have to, 'cause you can plainly see Mowgli is not here. I'm all alone. I know he's around here somewhere, and he can't hide forever. Well, he won't get past you, Baghee. Hmm. Whew! Kid? Kid, where'd you go?    Oh! What are you tryin' to do? Scare the tick out of my ticker?  Oh! Wow, the whole village looking for me? We can't let nobody see you. I thought they were mad. We gotta lay low, hunker down... Hibernate, like... They must really miss me. I wonder if Shanti's with them. Shanti? You definitely don't want her to find you. Do ya? No. We can't let anyone find us, especially that girl. Come on, Baloo. We gotta get moving. Lay low, hunker down, hibernate, like. Now, Mowgli, what if that girl tracks us down? What are you gonna do? Then... Then you're gonna have to scare her. Scare her? Has the milk run out of your coconut? No, she's terrified of wild animals. In case you haven't noticed, kid, I'm no wild animal.  Except at parties. I suppose I'm more of a... honey bear. You can do it, Baloo. You're the one that taught me, remember? You scrunch up your eyes like this, and show your teeth like this, and roar like this...  Roar? No, no, no, no. Like you mean it. Do you want that girl to take me back to the village?   Yeah, man! That was great. Well, I don't know. Trust me. That'll do it. Well, in that case, Mowgli, consider that girl scarified. Thanks, Papa Bear. Anything for my Little Britches. Okay, let's skedaddle. Now, don't you worry. I got a place downriver. It's the perfect hideout. Real quiet, huh? Quiet? Heh. You want quiet, go back to that manvillage. This place is happenin'. Okay, here's the village. We crossed the river...  Ranjan, be careful.  Okay, we went right. No, no, no, no. Left, left, I mean. Right. No, left, then right, and... Oh! This jungle all looks the same!  Ranjan, what's that? Mowgli? He must've been here. Or some animal with really sharp claws.  That snake lied to me. Now, don't take it out on the water just because you don't like the reflection. I mean, not everyone can be born with such great looks. You let that tiger get his claws on you, and you won't be so goodlooking. What, that pussycat? He's harmless. Watch this. Oh.  What's the matter, Stripes? Mancub got your tongue?  Uh, Lucky, let's find something to do somewhere else. No, no, no, no. Hang on, fellas. I got another one. How many men does it take to whoop a tiger?  Surprise me. None. A little kid could do it all by himself.   Come on, Lucky, let's go. Come on, Lucky, let's go. In fact, we heard that kid is right here in the jungle.  Right under your whiskers.  Interesting. I heard he's headed back to the village.  Wrong again, kitty. No, Lucky, keep your gob shut. No, they say he's headed downriver with a bear. Downriver, you say? Ah. Oh, don't listen to him. Ooh, yeah, he's new around here. He don't know anything. On the contrary, he seems to know quite a lot. Hey, hold on, hot pants! Where's the fire?   Isn't it ironic that your name is Lucky?   Come on, lads! This way! Let's get out! This is the perfect hideout? This is King Louie's place. Was, kid, was. He's splitsville. Now, me and the monkeys have turned it into the greatest secret hideout ever. Excuse me. Comin' through. Hey, Baloo! Oh, good to see you back again, man. Heh. Everybody knows about it. But if everybody knows about it, how can it be a secret? I mean, everybody who's anybody. Nobody who's nobody don't know nothin' about no place that everybody who's anybody knows about, you dig?  My head hurts. Hey, turn the thinker off for a minute and just dive in. Step aside, and I'll show you what a real rugcutter can do.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the boss of bop, the jack of jive, the jungle cat who's really gonna keep it alive. Get ready to stir it up and serve it up.

Ooh!  Whoa!   Whoohoo! That's my boy. They don't swing out like that in your manvillage, now do they, kid, hmm? Well, uh, no. Big fat no. Say, what's that village like, anyway? Hey, whoa, don't bother the kid. He told me all about that scene. Let me lay it out for you. Those people are crazy. Everybody works and nobody plays. Oh, man! They got nothin' but rules, rules, rules. Oh, and there's even this girl who thinks the jungle is a scary place.  But, you know, it doesn't matter, 'cause Mowgli's never gonna see that village or that crazy girl again.  Ain't that so, kid? Mowgli? Mowgli? Mowgli?  Mowgli!  That morning sun peeks over the mountains And all the rhinos rub their eyes When they hear Hear the jungle rhythm  Did we find Mowgli yet? Oh, are you tired? A little. I'm sure we'll find him soon. Come on, hop up. You okay up there? Uhhuh. How could it be Half as good as being free? Part of me Like the jungle rhythm  Did you hear that? Hear what? It sounded like Mowgli. Mowgli! Ranjan, wait! Ranjan! Mowgli! Shanti? Whoa! Are you okay? Oh, I feel vine.  What are you doing up there? Hold on, I'll be right... Whoa! I can't believe I finally found you! I thought I would never see you again! You out here, kid? Hey, Little Britches?  Mowgli! Ow! Ow! Hmm. Ow, you're not really helping. Ranjan, stop pulling. It's her. So, what are you doing out here, anyway? I came to save you. Save me? From what? That wild bear that carried you off. What wild...     Baloo, don't! No, no, no! Stop! Wait!  Ow! Oh!  Roar.  Oh. My poor sneezer. That hurt. You come anywhere near Ranjan, and I'll really show you hurt. Wait! Whoa! Don't make me do it! Wait, wait, wait! Calm down! It's okay. But he's attacking us! Attacking? I'm the one that got socked in the schnozzle. Well, that's because you scared her. But you... You told me to scarify her! What? No, no, no, no. I...  Mowgli, you planned this? Well, I, um...  Come on, Ranjan. No, Shanti, I can explain! Don't even bother. Shanti, wait! Oh, man, you weren't kiddin' about her. She's bad news. No, she's not! She was just trying to help, and you scared her! Man alive. First, you tell me to scare her, then you tell me not to scare her. Kid, I only got so much room up in this noggin, and it's fillin' up fast! You just don't understand. All right. How's about layin' it out for me?  Read you loud and clear, kid. You wanted that girl to find you.   Shanti! Where are you?  Come on! There you are. I'm so sorry. Will you let me explain? Uh... Come on, at least talk to me.   You seem surprised to see me, mancub.  I can't imagine why. I wasn't going to let you get away with what you did to me. You see, you humiliated me, mancub. Surely you do realise I simply can't let you live.  Run!  Oh, you're going to try and outrun me. How droll.  Come on, this way!    All right, stay here. Mowgli, no!  Ranjan, wait here. I gotta go help Mowgli. But I want to help Mowgli, too! No, no. I... I'll be right back, I promise. Don't move.   Whoa!   Whoa, whoa, hold still. Calm down, kid. Now, where's Mowgli? Shere Khan! Shere Khan? Hold on! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!         No matter how fast you run, no matter where you hide, I will catch you.  Come out, come out, wherever you are.  Hurry! Hurry! Faster! Faster!

I'm proud of you, Baloo. That was a very brave thing... Uh, Baghee? Don't go getting any ideas about running after him and trying to talk him into staying here with us. He belongs in that village, and you know it. Oh, really? Yes, really. He's got his whole future there. I'm sorry, Baloo. You're absolutely right.  I'm really going to miss that kid. Me, too.

The Princess And The Frog,Disney,2000,2009,Animation,"Evening star is shining bright,  So make a wish and hold on tight,  There's magic in the air tonight,  And anything can happen.  Just in that moment, the ugly little frog  looked up with his sad, round eyes and pleaded:  Oh, please, dear princess,  Only a kiss from you can break this terrible spell,  that was inflicted on me by a wicked witch.  There comes my favorite part. And the beautiful princess was so moved by his desperate plea, that she stooped down, picked up the slippery creature, leaned forward, raised him to her lips, and kissed that little frog. Than the frog was transformed into a handsome prince. They were married and lived happily ever after. The end. Yay! Read it again, read it again! Sorry Charlotte, it's time for us to be headin' home.

Put the monkey down. Stay back, or I'll... I'll... Please, please, please... Ah, oh well...allow me to introduce myself: I'm Prince Naveen. ... of Maldonia. A prince? But I didn't wish for any... Hold on, if you're the prince, then... then who was that waltzing with Lottie on the dance floor? All I know, is one minute I am a prince, charming and handsome, cuttingarug, and the next thing I know, ...I am tripping over these. Wait, wait, wait... Wait! I know this story! Di Frogie Prutto! The Frog Prince? Yes, yes, yes... My mother had the servants read this to me every night. Yes, yes... this is exactly the answer! You ... You must kiss me! Excuse me? You will enjoy it, I guarantee. All women enjoy the kiss... of Prince Naveen. Come, we pucker. That's new. Look, I'm sorry. I'd really like to help you, but I just... Do not kiss frogs. Wait a second! But...On the balcony, you ask me... I didn't expect you to answer! Oh, but you must kiss me. Look, besides being unbelievably handsome, I also happened to come from a fabulously wealthy family. Surely, I can offer you some type of reward or a wish I could grant perhaps... Yes? Just... One kiss? Just one. Unless you beg for more. Ok Tiana, you can do this... Just a little kiss, just a little kiss. Ok! You don't look there much different. But how did you get way up there? And how did I get way down here, in all this! Easy princess, do not panic.

The poor dear frog was scarfing , so I loosened the lid, and.... How do I ever get tangled up in all this voodoo madness? I can't get through with this. You wear this ...this ghostly flinger! Amulet! Anything happens to this ... I'm gonna need... Fun fact about voodoo, Larry. Can counter a thing for myself. Besides ... you and I both know the real power in this world ain't magic. It's money. Lots of it. It's true. Aren't you tired of living on a smidgens, While all those fat cats in their fancy cars don't give you so much of a sideway's glance ? Yes... I am. All you got to do is marry Big Daddy's little princess ... And we will splittin' that juicy La Bouff fortune right down in the middle. Sixtyforty like i said. But ... What about Naveen? You little slipup... We will be a minor bump in the road, so long as we got the prince's blood in this. Voodoo? You mean to tell me this all happened because you were messing with the Shadow Man? He was very charismatic! It serves me right for wishing on stars. The only way to get what you want in this world is through hard work. Hard work? Why... why would a princess need to work hard? Huh? Oh, I'm not a princess. I'm a waitress. A waitress? Well no wonder the kiss did not work! You lied to me! I...I never said I was a princess. You never said you were a w... a waitress!

I am completely broke. You said ... You were fabulously wealthy! No, no, no. My parents are fabulously wealthy. But they cut me off for being a... Leech! Leech! You're broke, and you had the gall to call me a liar? It was not a lie! I fully inte...Aaah! I fully intend to be rich again! Once I marry Miss Charlotte La Bouff' and she will help me! You a prince? obviously! She'll help you! All right then. Once you two are married, you are gonna keep your promise and get me my restaurant, right? Whoa, oh, not so fast. I made that promise to a beautiful princess, not a cranky wai... Why are those logs moving? Those aren't logs! I got glimpse on a big one. C'mon, come here! Come here you tasty one mussel!  Where did they go? Lower the vine. Find your own tree. There he is. I've seen him! I've seen him! Okay, help me get out of this swamp and once I married Charlotte, I shall get you your restaurant. You gonna taste so good you wasted invaluable rat! Quick, quick, pull me up! You can hop ... but you can't hide. We got all night! Well, waitress, looks like we going to be here for a while. So we may as well get ... comfortable. Take your slimes away from me. I've told you ... It is not slime! It is mucus. Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty. Gators are gone. We got to get back to New Orleans ... And undo this mess you got us into. I was not the one parading around with your phony baloney tiara. Music de paddle bile. Could use a little help! I will play a little louder. How about a little less piggin' and a ... I know that tune! Dippermouth Blues. Play it, brother! Where you've been all my life?! Where did you learn to play like that? Well, the Bajou's is the best jazz school in the world. All the greats play the riverboats. Oh, Louis give anything to be up there jammin with the big boys. So why don't you? Oh, I tried once. It didn't end well. It is been a real pleasure meetin' you, Louis. And thank you for coming and for not eatin' us. We best be on our way. Where are you goin'? To find somebody to break the spell. What spell? Brace yourself, my skilly friend, We are not frogs ... We are humans. What? You are serious? I am Naveen, Prince of Maldonia. And she is Tiana, the waitress. Do not kiss her. Now just a second. This corny here got himself turned into a frog by a voodoo man and now ... Voodoo? Like the kind Mama Odie do. Mama, hoodie ? Mama Odie. She is the voodoo queen of the Bajou. She got magic and spells of kind a voodoo . Could you take us to her? To the deepest, darkest part of a Bayou?? Facing raser sharks, prick ambushers, and trappers, and hunters with guns? No. Watch and learn. Louis, that's too bad we can not help you with your dream. If only you were smaller... less toothy. You can play jazz to adoring crowd without scaring them. Anyway, enjoy your loneliness, my friend! Abenaza. Cute, but it's not gonna... Hey guys, I just had me a crazy idea. What about if I ask Mama Odie to turn me human? Louis, you are a genius. Hallelujah! If I were a human being  I'd head straight for New Orleans  and I'd blow this horn so hot and strong  like no one they'd ever seen  Louis Armstrong, Mister Sydney Bechet  All the boys gonna step aside  when they hear this old Alligator play  Listen!  When I'm human  as I hope to be  I'm gonna blow this horn till the cows come home  and everyone's gonna bow down to me!  Thank you! Thank you!  Aw, thank you! I love you too baby!  When I'm myself again I want just the life I had  Aye  that doesn't sound too bad  a redhead on my left arm  a brunette on my right  a blonde or two to hold a candle  that seem just about right Eh, Louis?  Life is short when you're done, you're done  we're on this Earth to have some fun  and that's the way things are Say it, brother!  When I'm human,  and I'm gonna be  I'm gonna tear it up like I did before  that's a royal guarantee  You are getting married! All right. I just have to leave a string of broken hearts behind me. Your modesty becomes you  and your sense of responsibility  I worked hard for everything I got  and that's the way it's supposed to be  When I'm a human being  at least I'll act like one  if you do your best each and every day  good things are sure to come your way  What you give is what you get!  My daddy said that and now I'll never forget  and I amend it to you  When we're human  and we're gonna be  I'm gonna blow my horn!  I'm gonna live the high life!  I'm gonna do my best to take my place in the sun  When we're human!  Oh, Prince Naveen, dear. I am positively mortified you had to endure that frog fiasco last night. Well, when youre next in line for the throne, youre poised like a panther, ready to expect the unexpected. Yyour ear? What? Oh, there's pesky mosquitoes... everywhere. Get in here! Please, Miss Charlotte, I can no longer ignore the throbbing of my... Heart. Even though our time together's been brief, it's been heavenly. Let it...Place, Prince Naveen, You got me blushin' 'til I... Would you do me the honor of becoming Princess of Maldonia? Are you serious? As the plague. Yes! Oh, I most definitely will marry you! Oh, there's so much to plan! The guest list! The dress! The music! The flowers! The shoes! We're gonna have ourselves a Mardi Gras weddin'. No! What we do now?

You said just enough, Ray! Thank you, Evangeline. He was trying to propose, that's what all that fun was about. And here I thought, all he wanted was to marry a rich girl. Sug', what are we looking for in here? You just keep your eyes at one of of the biggest godies float with a Mardi Gras princess about to kissed herself a ...a frog. Dear beloved, we are gathered here tonight in this fine celebration  to join together this prince and this young woman in holy matrimony.  Oh, no, this can't be right, darlin'. Then how you can still be a frog? Mama Odie...she's... I know what we've seen with our eyes but... If we just go back there we gonna find that your fairy tale come true. Just because you wish for somethin', doesn't make it true. It's like my Evangeline always said to me ... Evangeline is nothing but a star, Ray! A big ball of hot air a million miles from here. Open your eyes now! Before you get hurted. She's just big in a broken heart... That's all it is. Come on Evangeline. We gonna show sug' the truth. If any of you, object to the union of this two people  speak now or forever hold your plea.  Me, Me, I object. Do you, Prince Naveen, take Charlotte to be your wife ...  Cap, what are you doing, son? ...as long as you both shall live?  What? I do ... Yes, I'm for it. Is that you, cap? Ray, get me out of this box! I can't hear you, I'll go get you out of this box. ...as long as you both shall live?  Oh, I do. Then so, by the power invested in me by the state of Louisiana  I now pronounce you ... Man and. .. Prince Naveen! Goodness gracious! Are you all right? I just need a moment to compose myself. Cheese and crackers! Lawrence, why are you doing this? It's payback for all those years of... Humiliation. Get your royal a... back on that wedding cake and finish this deal. What is he doing? Stop him! I got him. He got me too! Gimme that! Stay on the side! Ray? Hey, why did you stop?  Sug'? Sug'? Ray? This proves what we saw ain't what we thought we saw. What is this? It's voodoo, hydeco? The Shadow Man, he's been usin' voodoo... You can't let Shadow Man get this, no matter what. Now run girl, run! Do not make me light my butt. I got lightin' on me. Come here, you! Ok, come! Ray! What ... Ray? Back off! Or I'm gonna break this into a million pieces. Naveen? Now, isn't this whole life better than hoppin' around bayou for the rest of your life?? Shadow Man? Got a head to you, Tiana. When you dream, you dream big. Just look at this place! Gonna be the crown jewel of the cursancy. And all you got to do, to make this reality It's handle that little talisman of mine. No. Thisthis is not right. Come on, darlin'? Think of everything you sacrificed. Girl, all you ever do is work. I told y'all she wouldn't come.  Think of all those maecenas who doubted you. You ain't never gonna get enough for the dang payment. Woman of your background, you better off will y'all.  And don't forget your poor Daddy. Now, that was one hard working man. See you tomorrow, James!  Double, sometimes triple shifts. Never let know how bone tired, beat darlin' really was. Daddy! Hey, babby cakes.  Shame on that hard work, didn't amount much more than a busted up, old gumbo pot. And a dream that never get off the back porch. But you ... You can give your poor Daddy everything he ever wanted. Come on, Tiana. You're almost there. My Daddy never did get what he wanted. But he had what he needed. He had love. Never lost a sight what was really important. Easy with that! Careful! And neither will I. Y'all should've taken my deal. Now you will spend the rest of your life bein' a slimy little frog! I got news for you, Shadow Man! It's not slime, it's mucus! No! No! How am I ever gonna pay back my debt?! Friends! Are you ready?  No! I'm not ready at all! In fact, I got lots more plans! Are you ready?  This is just a minor setback in a major operation! As soon as I whip up another spell, we'll be back in business! I still got that froggy prince locked away! I just need a little more time. No! No, please, no! Just a little more time! I promise I'll pay y'all back! I promise! Prince! Prince Naveen  Your shini', retirin' bride, completely is gettin' anxiety. Hello, darling! Miss La Bouff  Please down here.  Let me to introduce myself. I am the real Prince Naveen! Of Maldonia. Did you say prince? Boys, drag this maggot down to the Parish prison. I'm completely innocent. The Shadow Man bamboozled me. Goodness gracious! This is so much to absorb. Let me see if I got this right. If I kiss you before midnight, you and Tiana will turn human again, and then we gonna get ourselves married and live happily ever after! The end! Yeah, more or less. But remember, you must give Tiana all the money she requires for her restaurant. Because Tiana ... She is my Evangeline. Anything you want, sugar. Pucker up, buttercup! Wit! Tiana?  Tiana? Don't do this. I have to do this and we are running out of time! I won't let you! It's the only way to get you your dream! My dream? My dream wouldn't be complete... Without you in it. I love you, Naveen. Warts and all? Warts and all. All my life, I read about true love and fairytales, and... Tia, you found it! I'll kiss him! For you, honey! No marriage required. Oh my word! Mmaybe that ol' clock's a little fast! I'm so sorry! Tiana! Naveen!  Louis, what is it? Shadow Man lay poor Ray low! Ray? He's hurtin' awful bad. Hey, sug'! How come, y'all still ... We are stayin' frogs, Ray. And we are stayin' together. Oh, I like that very much. Evangeline like that too. So, by the power invested in me ... I now pronounce you frog and wife. Get to it, Hop Lone, and give your lovely bride some sugar. Congratulations! This gonna be good! Like I told y'all, kissing a princess breaks the spell. Once you became my wife, that made you ... A princess. You just kissed yourself a princess! And I'm about to do it again! In the South Land there's  A city  Way down on the river  Where the women are very pretty  And all the men deliver  They got music It's always playin'  Start in the day time, go all through the night  When you hear that music playin'  Hear what I'm saying and make it feel alright  Who would've thought the prince woulda had a younger brother. How old did you say you were? I'm six and a half. Well, I waited this long. Grab somebody, come on down  Bring your paintbrush, we're painting the town  There's some sweetness going around  Dreams do come true in New Orleans.  "
The Tigger Movie,Disney,2000,2000,Animation,"Now, this might be the room of any small boy,  but it happens to belong to a boy named Christopher Robin.  And, like most small boys,  Christopher Robin had toy animals to play with.  And together they had many remarkable adventures...  in an enchanted place...  called the Hundred Acre Wood.  But of all his animal friends,  Christopher Robin's very best friend...  was a bear called Winnie the Pooh.  Winnie the Pooh? Wait half a darn minute! It seems to me that most of these stories are about that silly old bear. Well, then, Tigger, who should this story be about?  Well, I happen to know someone... who's extremely fascinatin', not to mention handsome and debonairy. But the title already says Winnie the Pooh.  Oh, that's easy to fix. There! Now, that's a wonderful title. And speaking of wonderful things__ Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! The wonderful thing about Tiggers is Tiggers are wonderful things  Their tops are made out of rubber, their bottoms are made out of springs  They're bouncy trouncy, flouncy, pouncy, Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun  But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the only one  Tiggers are cuddly fellas Tiggers are awfully sweet  Everyone eles is jealous That's why I repeat and repeat  The wonderful thing about Tiggers is Tiggers are marvelous chaps  They're loaded with vim and vigor, they love to leap in your laps  They're jumpy bumpy, clumpy, pumpy Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun  But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the only one  I'm the only__  Ohhh! Hello! I'm Tigger. That's Tldoublegeher. And that's me. Hoo, hoo, hoo! I know. You've bounced me lots and lots of times. Yeah. Fun, ain't it? Say, you want to go bouncin' with me, on account of bouncin's what Tiggers do__  eh, best. Eww. Well, I would go bouncing with you, Tigger, except that I must count all these honey pots... to be sure I have enough for winter.   Let me get that, please.  Bother. Yech! What do these Pooh bears like... about this icky, sticky stuff anyway? Well, no time for goofin' off. I've got dawdlin' to do. Hoo, hoo! T.T.F.N.! Tata for now! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Mmm! Mmm!  Ooh, ooh, ooh! Oh, oh, ohhh! BBBrrrr! Ohhh! Oh, dddear, dear. Hiya, Piglet, old pal! Aaah! What say you and I do a little bouncin' together? BBBouncing? Oh, my! I haven't enough firewood to last the winter, and__ Sure, you do! Why, there's lots of firewood. It's lyin' all over the place. There? See? Ohhh! Aaah! Now we can go bouncin'. BBut... I would really rather prefer that my firewood... not have quite so much... chair in it. Oh. Well, then, uh, T.T.F.N.! Gotta be bouncin' along! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!  Hello there! And good mornin', Mrs. Kanga, ma'am! Well, good morning, Tigger, dear. She called me ""dear.""  Pardon me for askin', but you wouldn't happen to be interested... in doin 'a bit of bouncin ' with me, would ya? Well, I'm afraid I have just too much to do this morning, dear. Oh. Well, if you have to__  See ya later. Bye. Tigger! Tigger! Tigg...er. Oh.  I wonder why nobody wants to bounce with me. Hmph. Oh, well. Hoo, hoo! What am I talkin' about? There's plenty of others I haven't even asked yet. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!  And so, the others all came round... to see what they might do to help. But the end of Eeyore's house Was merely the beginning... of a very unfortunate day. Wow! Look at the size of it.  Your attention, uh, please. Uh, ahem. I have officially completed... the plans. What plans? The plans... for removing this boulder... and restoring to Eeyore, uh, his happy home. No need to bother on my account. All we need is a little, uh, uh, team effort.  Rabbit's Rock Remover! Now, then, Pooh bear, release the counterweight. Kanga and Roo, start depressurizing... the granite extractor. Piglet? Piglet, start pulling your own weight over there. I__ I don't weigh anything.  A__ A little more over there. Yes. That's good. No, no, no, no!  Over here. This way. Ohh! Oh, good. I think__  Bother. Aaaah! Ohh! Oh! Aaaah! Oh, my. Oh! Well, now, why didn't it work? Oh, let's see here now. The counterweight__ Perhaps we could use another helping hand. Yes.  All we really need is__ Aaaahhh! Tigger! Hello, you blokes! Anyone up for a little bouncin'? No! No! No bouncing! Look! Just look at all this work we have to do! What? Movin' that old thing?  Not a problem. All you need is a little bouncin'. How will bbouncing move the rock, TTigger? Tut, tut, tut. Not now, Piglet. If maybe we had a little, uh__ Hm, mm, mm. Mm, mm, mm. Mmhmm. Right there! ""Bouncing will move this boulder."" Ha, ha! It's almost amusing.    Whoo! Oh! Oh! Help!   Whoa! Whoa! Oof!  Wow!   Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Now that that's outta the way,  who's up for a little bouncin'? Aaah! What is it with you and bouncing? Just look at my rock remover.  Everything's ruined, and all you can think about is__ bouncing? But that's what Tiggers do best. Exactly. Unlike us.  I'm afraid he's right, dear. WhWhat we're... trying to say is that, uh, we really can't bounce like Tiggers anyway, because, uh__ We're not Tiggers. Hmph!    Who needs them other fellas anyhow?   Mostly I'm happy and I'm bouncy  Because I am the onliest one   Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm  But now all at once I feel so lonely  For someone Like me   Someone Like me  Right now, I'm sort of feelin' downcy  I'm just about the loneliest one  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm  And deep in my heart I'm sort of wishin'  For someone like me   Someone like me  Somebody with springs and things  Who laughs and sings  And jumps every day  Somebody who's... fun, fun, fun  Who loves to trounce and pounce  And bounce their gloomies away  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. How I dream there is another  A double or a triple of me  To keep him company  But since I'm awake I feel so lonely  Because I know it can't be   It never can be  Bein' that I'm the one and onliest  Someone  Like... me   Someone Like me  Tigger? Um, TTigger? Don't be sad, Tigger. WhWhy don't you go bouncin'? That'll cheer you up.  No one to bounce with, Roo boy. Oh. Well, what about another Tigger? Another Tigger? That__   No. It's__ It's impossibibble. It's crazy. I'm the onliest one. But aren't there other Tiggers? I've got a mama. Don't you have a family somewhere too? Why, that's ridic__ Uh__ I mean__  Ooh, a family full of Tiggers, you say. Hoo, hoo! Can you imaginate such a thing? Why, that'd be more Tiggers than you could stick a shake at. And we'd all be bouncin'! Bouncin' morning, noon and nightynight! Hoo, hoo, hoo! But I could still bounce with ya, right, Tigger? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! My very own Tigger family! Ohho! You wish to find your family. Ha, ha! A most noble quest, indeed. There we are. Help yourself to the cream and sugar.  The search for Familius Genus Tiggeris. Ha, ha! That is Latin, I believe. Or is it, uh, Greek?  Speaking of family, why, my very own family portraits hang right over there, a collection I've gathered throughout the years.  Notice the interesting twists and turns Of its many branches, stretching out across the ages. It all comes from having strong roots, you know, and plenty of time to grow. In fact, I do believe that the very seed of my family... Hmm! began to germinate as far back as the 14th century... when a greatgreatgreat granduncle of mine... Hmm. went out on a limb and proclaimed his blossoming love... to a blooming young maid. As their love blossomed, they eventually... were blessed with nine fine young saplings.  Never a bough did break__   Now, my dear boy, are you quite all right? Perhaps some more tea.  Anyway, if I may go out on a limb here, I would first and foremost suggest for Tigger... that to find one's family, one must first look up... one's family tree. Oh, it does bring to mind a distant nephew of mine. An odd sort of fellow. He became a sailor... and fell in with a member of the feline persuasion. My...  family... tree? My family tree! Why didn't I think of thinkin' of that? So long, beak lips! Thanks for the tip! Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo, hoo! I say. Was it something I said?  And so began Tigger's grand search... for his family tree. He searched high. He searched low. He searched near, and he searched far. Yoohoo!  Family! Hello! Tigger. How are you gonna know which tree is your family tree? Why, that's obvious, Roo boy. My Tigger family tree has got to be the biggest, hugest and most gigantical tree in the entire Hundred Acre Woodses... on account of all the enormous numerical numerous numbers of... Tigger family members that'll be on it. And besides and furthermore, it'll be all stripedy, just like yours truly. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! The only question is, where could my family tree be? There! Good as new. Or maybe even better, if I do say so myself.  Could be a bit drafty. Might leak some. Sort of lopsided.  Kind a... cramped. Otherwise, a dream house. Hi ya, donkey boy! Hi ya, donkey boy! Tigger. Tigger! Tigger? Back to his bouncy old self. Oh, is this perhaps a Tigger family tree up there? Were you asking us to bounce with you? Because we would be glad to__ Hallo, Tigger family! Hallooo! Uh, no, not this one. Hallo! Hallo! Other Tiggers, come out, come out, wherever you are! Other Tiggers! Come out, come out, wherever you are! And aren't! Et cetera!  Hallooo! Tigger's family! Where are you? Pooh bear? I didn't know Tigger had a family. Yes. Only it appears... that he has lost them. Seemed to be lookin' for 'em. Uh, was that something we were supposed to be doing too? Why, I believe it must be, Piglet. I quite often remember to forget these sorts of things.   No, no, no. Aren't you coming, Rabbit? Huh? To look for more Tiggers? As if one wasn't bad enough. No, no! No! I have too many winter preparations to make. And if you three had any sense, you'd be doing the same. Hmph!  Aah! Come on. Hallooo! Hallooo! Hallooo! Tiggers! Come out, come out, whereveryou aren't! Tiggers! Hallooo! Tiggers! Just where aren't those Tiggers, anyway? We looked every which and where, not to mention right over there, and not a single stripedy tree in sight. Maybe I've been going about this all the wrong way upside down. Maybe what I need to do is find some sort of clue... as to where are their whereabouts. What kind of clue? Maybe in here. Some thingamabob or an heiriloom or something. Oh! Maybe this belonged to my uncle! Whatever. And just think, if there are other Tiggers, we could all bounce... the WhoopdeDooper, LoopdeLooper, AliOoper Bounce! 'Cause it's the bounce that Tiggers do best. The Whoopdew__ What kind of bounce? You know, that bounce I bounced when I bounced that big rock, the most hardest bounce of all that only the very bestest bouncers can bounce. You know. Only the very bestest bouncers... can bounce it. Oh! Could my auntie have made this for me? I could bounce it. It looks like she made a pair. Ahem! If you could teach me the Whoopy SuperDuper Bounce, then I could__ Teach ya the WDdoubleLAOB? What? That's ridickerous! It__ It's a__ It's a very powerful bounce, And it's only... for professional bouncers. But I'm a real good bouncer. You__  No offense there, Roo boy, but I think you're a little on the smallish side of tiny... and kind a lackin' in perpendicaler. Il could do the Whooper Dooper, uh__ The Looper Dooper, uh__ If you teach me.  You can't bounce the bounce... if you can't even pronounce the bounce. Ahem! Repeat after Tigger. The WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  The WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  It's got the zip that makes you flip and that's what really counts  In the WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  Now, half this bounce is 90 percent mental. If you calculate the specific Tiggerjectory... of your stripecelleration dicipherus... by the square boot of your rebounce, your vertical situituation indicator... and your stripersonic springnertia should ricaticochet... your hydranific fusillyage... into an accelerometric deorbit! Any questions? When I do get to learn the Whooping Whooper Whooper__ I mean, the Looper Dooper Whooper, uh__ The WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  The WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  The more you try the more you fly and that's what really counts  ln the WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  Now, you swing your legs up high, and you twist your tail in tight. Wind up all your springs, and with your eyes situated straight ahead, you let it all loose. Um, is this right? It's best when done by Tiggers 'cause our Tiggerific figgers  Are filed with vims and vigors, and that's the thing that triggers  The WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  The WhoopdeDooper LoopdeLooper AliOoper Bounce  The more you try the more you fly and that's what really counts  Right. It activates it elevates accelerates and more  Whee! You're bouncing off the ceiling  Like you never did before The WhoopdeDooper  WhoopdeDooper  LoopdeLooper  LoopdeLooper   AliOoper  Bounce  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Wow! Now me! Now me! Tut, tut, tut! Hoo, hoo, hoo! Wait a minute.  We haven't gone over all the safety rules and regularations. Aw! Rule number one: Always bounce... in a Welllit area. Rule number thenextone: Never bounce near an open flame. Rule three: Never bounce right after eatin ', or you'll get tail cramps. First you__ And then you__ Rule number four: Do not forget rule number__ And then you let it all loose with a__ Rule number__ Whoo! Whoa! Aaaah!  I think you let it a little too loose. Maybe another lesson?  I could__ What is this... doohickey?   Why, that's no doohickey. It's a thingamabob. Been in the family for generations. And I never even knew I had a doo__ Hoo, hoo!  This... is the exact thingamabob I was lookin' for.  And it must have a picture... of my Tigger family inside it. Oh, boy! Oh! I can't wait. I'll bet I got my mother's eyes... and my father's tail and__  one of my sister's chins, of course.  My grandpappy's stripes.  It's kinda, sorta__ Empty. Completely Tiggerless. How am I supposed to find my family now? MMaybe there's another way to reach 'em. Another way? A letter! Why don't you write 'em a letter? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hallo! Hello? Hello out there! Hello! Tigger's family? Tigger's family tree! Hello! Uh, how will we know a Tigger family member... when we see one? I suspect that he, or she, would be rather more bouncy than usual, Piglet. I found 'em__ Tigger's family. Really? Oh! Where, Eeyore? Here they are, bouncin' like anything, stripes and all.   No need to thank me. Do these particular Tiggers seem... rather strange to you, Piglet? YYYes, and rather ffierce. Still, I suppose you never can tell with Tiggers. Pardon me, Mr.__ or Mrs.__ Tigger, but could you perhaps accompany me back to Tigger's house? He misses you very much, you see. And he__ Oh, bother. Uh__ Uh, Hello, Tigger family member.  Uh, uh, I was wondering__ That is, if you're not too busy__ Oh! Oh! DDDear.   Sinkin'? Figures. If I could just have... a moment? Oh! Oh! But please come back! Ooh, ooh, ooh!  We really need your . It would just take a minute. Oh, bother. Nice Tigger. Ooh, hoo! Il don't remember Tiggers being quite this sslippery, do you, Pooh? Well, now that I think of it,  I don't remember a Tigger making quite that sort of sound either. Piglet. Yes, Pooh bear?  I don't think these are the right sort of Tiggers after all.  Not that anyone will miss me.  Let me see now. ""Dear Tldoublegehers. Tiggers. Greetin's and... salivatin's! Please drop by any old time...  on account of my house... is your house, and vicey versey. Love, Tigger.""  There! That oughta do it! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Now there's nothin' to do... but wait. Hello, Tigger's family. Hello!  Anybody out there?   Why, if my tummy is not mistaken, this particular family tree... is a bee sort of family tree. And where there are bees,  there's honey. Um, I think there may be something moving... in this tree. DDo you think it could be... Tigger's family up there, Pooh bear?  I suppose there's only one way to find out, Piglet.   Just as my tummy suspected.    Ow!  Bother. If only these bees were a bit less... busy. Perhaps if I hummed a soothing sort of song, Like such: Um... Go to sleep  Shh, quiet If you're a bee  A lullaby  Da, da, dum  Um... lullabee, lullabee  Honey bees in the tree   Rest... your wings  Till the morning light  lullabee, lullabee  Honey bees in the tree  Your honey  Is safe tonight  Just dream to the tune  I am singing  Time to stop  All that buzzing and   Stinging  Mm, ouch. lullabee, lullabee  Honey bees in the tree  All I want is a smackrel  Or two  Or three   Don't sleep lightly  Sleep very tightly  Happy slumbers  To you  Shh! Mmm! Mmm!  Mmm! Yum! Pooh bear's been up in that tree an awful long time, don't you think? Most likely he's stuck. Been known to happen. Oh, ddear! Then I__ I'd better climb up and see if he's all right. Mmm!  Uh, Pooh bear, uh, aare you stuck? Oh! Oh, bother.  Uh, Pooh bear? Oh! Oh! Oh! Piglet. Yes, Pooh? I have come to the conclusion that__  that these bees are definitely not the right sort of Tiggers!  It doesn't look good. Oh!  Oh!  Bees! Run!   Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!  At last, the day had come to an end, as days often will. And what had begun as a very exciting idea... had changed to a rather discouraging one. Tigger? Uh, I gotta go home now. Mama will be worried about me. Tigger?  Oh, what, am I kiddin' myself?  They're not comin', 'cause I might as well face it__ there aren't any other Tiggers.  I guess that means... this silly old thing's just gonna stay empty... for... all of... forever.  But isn't that the wonderful thing about Tiggers, being the only one?  You betcha, Roo boy. Oh, the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm  The very only   last, lonely, single,  solitary... one.  First, I__ And just so__  And then I__  like this. And then a little twist, like such.  And then I let it all loose with a__ Aaaah!     Aaaah! Oof! Oh! Whatever are you doing, Roo, dear? I'm practising the WhoopdeDoopTee Bounce. Maybe if I do it really good for Tigger, he wouldn't miss not having a family so much. But... I can't bounce it yet. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to do it in time, dear. But Tigger seems awfully lonely, don't you think, Mama? I suppose he might be every now and again. Mama? Yes, dear? I wish I had a big brother like Tigger. Now, why wish that... when you have a Tigger like Tigger? 'Cause then I'd be his little brother, and he'd be just like one of our family. Wouldn't that be great? But, Roo, dear, Tigger is one of our family. And as long as we care for him, he always will be. Sweet dreams, Roo, dear.  I still wish I could do something to make him feel better. I say, young Roo, If you suggest that a letter... would bring cheer to our friend Tigger, then we shall, by all means, write one! Eh__  Now, uh, what sort of letter is this to be? It's by us from them to him. By which from what to whom? From Tigger's family to Tigger. Ah, yes! Ha, ha, ha.  ""Dear Tigger, Just a note to say__"" Uh, ""just a note to say""? What shall it say? Well, uh, I suppose it might say, um, ""dress warmly""? Oh, oh, I see. Ha, ha. Excellent advice. Oh, Owl? Perhaps__  ""Eat well""? Good point, Pooh bear. ""Stay safe and sound""? Oh, a very good idea, Piglet. ""Keep smilin'."" ""We're always there for you."" ""Wishing you all the best. Signed, Your Family."" There. Won't Tigger be pleased? What a splendid idea. How wonderful for Tigger. Yes, marvelous work, everyone. Ho, ho!  And so, the next morning__ Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo! Hello, everybody! Pooh boy! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Pigilet! Kanga! Kanga! Roo! Roo! Roo! Hoo, hoo, hoo! Eeyore! Eeyore, old buddy! Look at what I got. A letter, a letter for me! That's who!  TIdoublegeher spells Tigger! I, uh, wonder who it might be from. From my very own family! I knew I had one. A great big family! Full of uncles and aunties... and grandTiggers and secondcousin Tiggers! And they're all just like me. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Just imaginate it. Hundreds of thousands of Tiggers! All bouncin' around up there in our huge gigantical family tree!  There's momsey Tiggers and popsey Tiggers  And Tiggers I never knew  Like sister Tiggers and brother Tiggers  And cousin Tiggers too  There's grandma Tiggers and grandpa Tiggers as you can plainly see  When we're all together it's a jumpin 'jamboree  Round, round the family tree I look like them and they look like me  Round, round my family tree We're a happy family  There's huge slews of nephew Tiggers uncle Tiggers by the ton  Whipper snappin' grandpappy Tiggers and grandma Tiggers are fun  There's skinny, little tiny, little thin, little Tiggers  Rolypoly Tiggers too  But we're all relations and we're quite a mighty crew  Round, round my family tree I look like them and they look like me  Round, round my family tree We're a happy family  The Amazing Flying Tiggers! Round my family tree We're a happy family  The firstestmost roots of my family tree  Reach way backin history  To the braverest, fiercerest noblerest Tiggers  You'd ever care to see  The heroicest figgers of my ancestor Tiggers  Has always been hailed and cheered  And the sculpturous grace of our Tiggerous faces  Is why we're all revered  There were warrior Tiggers Explorier Tiggers  And Tiggers of worldly acclaim  There were glorious fantazmagorious Tiggers  With prizes and fortunes and fame  There's the glamorous branch and the amorous branch  Of our fabulous family tree  And when we sing together  We're in perfect harmony  Round and round my family tree  I look like them and they look like me  Round and round my family tree  We're a happy family  Hee, hee, hee, hee! There's momsey Tiggers and popsey Tiggers  And Tiggers I never knew  Hoo, hoo! Like uncle Tiggers and nephew Tiggers  And grandma Tiggers too  And when we Tiggers all get together  We really have a ball  The bounciest, trounciest flounciest, pounciest  Most Tiggerifigest  Family reunion of all  Everybody bounce! You know how to do it! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! And__ I'm especially excited about this part__ they miss me somethin' awful! And they're comin' to see me... tomorrow! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! TTTomorrow?   Uhoh. Oh, Tigger, I can't wait to meet them. Now, wwwwhere did it say that... exactly? Exackatackly nowhere, per se, 'cause with us Tiggers, you got to read betwixt the lines. Grrr! I'm gonna see my whole family! 'Cause my whole family is all comin' to see... little old youknowhoohoohoo! The most wonderful thing about Tiggers is  I'm not the only one I'm not the only one  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!  Now, Tigger was so enormously excited... that his friends couldn't help but feel, well, a bit concerned. Tigger? Tigger?  Tigger? Oh, hi ya, Roo! What are ya doin', Tigger? Why, I'm buildin' a family room on to my house! So my family will have plenty of room! Hoo, hoo, hoo! They got to live somewheres after the big family reunitin' party. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Party? Why, sure! Boy, it's gonna be great. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! It's all right in my letter.  Speakin' of which, you wanna hear me read it once or thrice again? Uh, Tigger__ ""Dear__""  They call me ""dear."" It's embarrassin', ain't it, the way us Tiggers go oozin' oodles and doodles of affection? Yeah, but__ ""Dear Tigger__"" Ya see that? Us Tiggers always call us Tiggers by their firstest names. ""Dress warmly."" They're worried sick about me. ""Eat Well. Keep smilin'. Stay safe and sound."" And here is the best part of all. ""We're always there for ya.""  Isn't this the alltime greatest? Yeah, the greatest. I was gonna tell him, but I couldn't. Pooh, do you think you could? Why, certainly, Roo. Could what? Tell him, uh, about the letter? Why, certainly.    Could that be them already? Tiggers are usually fashionabubbly late. Welcome, dear brothers, to the house of Tigger! Oh, hoo, hoo! Hi ya, buddy bear. You're just in time to help me finish up with the finishin' up. Hold these here while I put those there. Uh, Tigger, there is a very important matter which I must discuss. You're right, Pooh boy! I could use another balloon or two dozen. Um, Tigger? Hmm? Something isn't right here.  Much better. Now, what'd you want to talk about, Pooh boy? Pooh? Perhaps I'll need a bit of help.  Tigger was so very excited... and had so very many things to do. He heard very little Of what anyone else was saying.  But as it so happened, none of his friends had the heart to tell Tigger... very much of anything anyway. Not like he won't find out for himself...  sooner or later. Oh, poor dear. He'll be so disappointed. Oh, dddear. Indeed. Oh, what have we done? Oh, perhaps his family will come and everything will be fine.  That's it! There! Ha, ha! A veritable work of art. Ah. And just how will this cheer up Tigger? Uh, Well, uh, the stripes look okay. But what we have to do is act real Tiggery. We gotta do a lot of bouncing... and say a lot of Tigger stuff. Yes, such as, ""Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"" ""Absoposilutely."" That's kinda sorta like, like Tigger, but, um__ How to be a Tigger How to be a Tigger  How to be a Tigger is up to you  Ah! You've got to look like a Tigger  And sound like a Tigger  And act like a Tigger too  If we paint black stripes on our underwear  And glue on whiskers too  We're bound to appear far more as Tiggers do  Ha, ha. Unquestionably. Maybe we could all say T.T.F.N., and shout, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo  We all might sound a lot more Tiggerish too  Ha, ha, ha. You think? And that is how to be a Tigger How to be a Tigger  How to be a Tigger is up to you  You've got to look like a Tigger and sound like a Tigger  And act like a Tigger too  If we break things up and knock things down  And leave the place a mess  That's the thing that Tigger does the best loughta know.  And if I don't eat honey from the honey pot  Ol' Tigger will plainly see  I must be another Tigger because I couldn't possibly be me  You've got to look like a Tigger and sound like a Tigger  And act like a Tigger__  Um, also. Oh, thank goodness I found you all here. There's a terrible storm headed for__ What on earth are you doing? Stripes? Springs? Have you lost your minds? You should be covering the windows! Counting your supplies! Gathering firewood! Winter is here, and you aren't even ready. What are you doing Wasting your time with__ What am I doing wasting my time? I've got serious work to do! At least I haven't lost sight Of what's really important. Ha, ha. Well, I__ Il really didn't have enough time to gather any firewood. I am down to this... last lonely honey pot. Well, come to think of it, uh, we don't really look or act very much like Tiggers. Thought I was pretty convincing. Wait! Wait! We gotta do it! We have to do it! Think how sad Tigger's gonna feel. Oh, but we don't really know how to be a Tigger. Yeah, we do. Um__ If we could all be happy  Full of friendliness and cheer  He'll surely see we are his family  Ah! We're filled with joy and laughter  And the happiness he starts  And feel it from the bottom  Of our hearts  And that is how to be a Tigger How to be a Tigger  How to be a Tiggeris up to you, you've got to be like a Tigger  Full of glee like a Tigger with a happy  Ho, ho, ho  How to be a Tigger  How to be a Tigger  How to be a Tigger is up to you  You've got to be like a Tigger, full of glee like a Tigger  With a happy  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo  Oh!   I wonder where they could be. What if they got the wrong directions? What if they strayed off the beaten path? What if they're out there hopelessly lost? Clutched in the cruel grasp Of winter? Hold on, Tiggers! I'm comin' to get ya!  Surprise!  Is it__ Is it__ Is it really you, my very own one and only family? Yep, yep! Come in! There's a lot of catchin' uppin' we gotta do. We haven't seen each other in__ We haven't seen each other!  Ooh!  Ooh. Um, gee, it's, um, nice... to have all us Tiggers gettin' together like this. Huh? Oh, yes. Sure. Certainly is.  What am I__ Where the heck are my mannerisms? Uh, uh, refreshin' refreshyments for all. Hoo, hoo. Comin' right up. Help yourself. Don't be shy. There you go. Take two, you're small.

Mornin' and noon, and noon to night. Why, that's what I've been doin' too! It must run in the family. Hey, who's up for some familytype fun and games? You look like a funlovin' type of fella. Hoo, hoo, hoo!  I got a great partytype, familytype game we can play. How about pin the tail on the don__  Hoo, hoo, hoo. It looks like ya already been playin' it.  I know. Let's all do what Tiggers do best! That would be bouncin', of course. Yes, what a lovely idea. Yeah! Let the bouncin' begin!  Yeah! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Bounce. Bounce. Bounce! Oh, boy!  Ha, ha, ha! I do enjoy bouncing.  Don't bounce too high now, Roo__ Tigger! Tigger, dear. You certainly have a wonderful family, Tigger. Wait a second! We gotta bounce the WhoopdeDooper, LoopdeLooper, AliOoper Bounce! What a Tiggerific idea! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Guests first. You gotta swing your legs up high. And you twist your tail in tight. You wind up all your springs, and with your eyes fixed straight ahead, ya let it all loose and go, ""Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!""      Roo? What are you doin' impersonizin' a Tigger?  Piglet? Kanga? Owl? Eeyore? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. We only wanted to help, Tigger. Oh. Oh. Now I understand. It was all a big joke. Well, that's all right, 'cause somewhere out there, there's a Tigger family tree full of my real Tigger family! I got a letter to prove it! And I'm gonna find 'em, so... T.T.F.E.! Tata for ever!  Poor Tigger, all alone in the cold. He must be very sad... and perhaps lost. And maybe even a bit...  hungry. Bother.   Pooh, you gotta help me find Tigger! It's all my fault! He never would have left if it wasn't 'cause of me. I didn't mean to make him feel bad. I just__ I just wanted him to be my big brother.  Oh, oh. We gotta go find him! We just gotta! And so we will. What we need is__ Think, think, think.  An expotition. An expotition? Yes! To the place where Tigger is... or was... or will be? I believe Rabbit should lead us. Rabbit? Oh, yes.  He's the only one who ever says he knows what he's doing. Absolutely not. I mean, uh, well, after all, he, uh__ It was not my__ He, uh__ He wanted to leave, uh, didn't he? But, Rabbit__   He could always give that extra little push... when you needed it. Oh, thank you, Roo. IIt was nice to have him here when things were ffrightful. Sort of lit up the room when he came in. Uh, Well, uh, ahem, wwhat do you need me for? Why don't you go find him yourselves? But we're just not clever enough, Rabbit. Rabbit__  I miss him. Well, I, uh, well__ Oh, very well. Tigger! Tigger! Tigger! Tigger! Now, now, careful, everyone. It's a bit windy!  Are you all right, Eeyore? Eeyore?  Oh, dddear! Oh, uh, help. Ooh!

There you are!  Silly old bear. My! Nice to see ya. Where have you all been? We were looking for Tigger looking for Tigger's family. Tigger's... family?  You didn't have to go looking for them. But__ But I got a letter, and__ and it said that__ that__ It was right__ Oh. I must have ost it in the avalanchee. I can't even remember the words.   ""Dear Tigger, Just a note to say__"" ""Dress warmly."" ""Eat Well."" ""Stay safe and sound."" ""Keep smilin'."" ""We're always there for you."" ""Signed__"" ""Your Family."" You mean you fellas are my family? I'm afraid we have nothing better to offer. Well, of course not, Pooh boy! Hoo, hoo! 'Cause there's nothin' better than the best! I should have seen it all along.  Spotted you a mile away.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!  Then the whole mountain came down on top of us. But Tigger saved us! I wasn't worried at all, except for the part where I was worried, of course.  Ahem! Ahoom and et cetera! In honor of this most occasional occasion, my firstest ever family reunitin ', I'd like to present each of ya with a present. Firstest, for Eeyore! A new family room For your lovely home. Seems kind of big. Bit on the comfy side. Not very drafty. But I suppose I'll get used to it. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! I love parties.  And for Pooh boy, enough honey to last all winter! Or till next Thursday anyways. Hoo, hoo, hoo. Why, thank you, Tigger. It looks good enough to eat. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! And for Piglet, Old pal, a winter's worth of firewood. Hoo, hoo. Keep warm. Oh, thank you, Tigger! You're very welcome. I think I'll eat a piece myself. And for you, long ears, I promise from now on... I'll always watch where I'm bouncin'. Oh, Well, thank you, uh, Tigger. Bravo, Tigger! Bravo, I say. Very well done indeed. I'm very impressed. Thank you so much! Thank you, Tigger. Thank you so much, Tigger. Oh, look at this. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! You didn't think I was gonna Disremember you, did ya? Ha, ha, ha! Go on. Go on. Open 'er up. It's all yours.  Is it really for me, Tigger? Only the best for my bestest little brother.  Wait half a minute. We still need a family portrait to put in it! Look this way, everybody. Closer. Smile!  Sunny days and starry nights  And lazy afternoons  You're countin' castles in the clouds  And hummin' little tunes  But somehow right before your eyes  The summer fades away  Everything is different  And everything has changed  If you feel lost  And on your own  And far from home  You're never alone, you know  Just think of your friends  The ones who care  They all will be waitin' there  With love to share  And your heart will lead you  Home  Funny how a photograph  Can take you back in time  To places and embraces  That you thought you'd left behind  But tryin' to remind you  That you're not the only one  That no one is an island  When all is said and done  If you feel lost  And on your own  And far from home  You're never alone, you know  Just think of your friends  The ones who care  They all will be waitin' there  With love to share  And your heart will lead you  Home  There'll come a day when you're losin' your way  And you won't know where  You belong  They say that home is where the heart is  So follow your heart  And know that you can't go wrong  If you feel lost and on your own  And far from home  You're never alone, you know  Just think of your friends  The ones who care  They all will be waitin' there  With love to share  And your heart will lead you  Lost and on your own  And far from home  You're never alone, you know  Just think of your friends  The ones who care  They all will be waitin' there  With love to share  And your heart will lead you  Where you belong  I know your heart  Will lead you  Home "
The Wild,Disney,2000,2006,Animation,"So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti. And... You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off. Dad, I've heard this like a billion times. Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas... Cry? Yep. The croc attack? Dad. OK. Think. Yeah, you do that. All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard. It all started in the little place I like to call... ...the wild. They were the fastest wildebeests  on the savannah.  We're talking fast.  All the other lions  had given up the hunt hours ago,  except your old man.  Fortunately, I knew a short cut.  I thought I had 'em.  Until the dust cleared.  Classic wildebeest trap.  So, what did you do next?  What did I do?  Yeah.  That's when I gave them the roar.  That's it?  Hold on a sec.  I only thought it was over.  But they had a secret weapon.  He was the biggest wildebeest  I've ever seen.  He was 14 feet tall!  Fourteen?  I meant 1,401 feet tall!  Cool.  And he had two... No, four  of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.  Whoa! His breath was red hot!  I mean, green.  And he hated the environment.  To pull this off, I knew I was  gonna have to dig deep,  deeper than I ever had before.  So I swallowed my fear,  sucked in the biggest breath I could.  Dad, I'm ready!  You got it?  I got it!  I got it! Well, let him have it! Roar, son! Story of my life. Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests. Mine makes the babies laugh. Hey, come on. That was much better. I'm serious! It dropped half an octave. It dropped half an octave. And it sure scared me. Made my hair stand up on end. Yeah, right, Dad. OK. Let's take it from the top. I'm done for today. Come on, come on, one more. You were so close. Maybe it's something technical. Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough. Like this. Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild. Hold on a second. We've got everything we could ever want here. Great lifestyle, three squares a day. It's boring. Boring? I'll never learn how to roar here. Ryan. But don't worry. I finally figured out how we can get to the wild. You did? The pigeons say those green boxes go there. Those boxes are bad news. Stay away. But, Dad... I know you're frustrated, but a lion finds his roar... Here. I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad! It's a rat! Get that rat off my baby! A rat? Hello! Silly, silly rat. Rats do not got bling like this, lady. You little! Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen! Benny, stealing candy from a baby? Stealing is such a strong word. I prefer ""liberating."" Hey, kid, heard the roar. Down another... Octave. Octave! You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtlecurling title? I can't even roar. How would you even know I'm there? So, you really think it dropped an octave? Absolutely. What the heck is an octave? I heard that. Rabbit. Cholesterol. I'll stick with the nuts. I don't know what his problem is, Benny. He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nineyearold level. Little help here, Sammy? You know what? Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild. Hey, he's always loved those stories! They inspire him. OK. I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss. You got something right there. Where? No, no, other side. Here? Sorry, Benny. You got it. Attention, friends.  Stop by the gift shop and get  the most popular plush in America:  Nigel, the ""ILikeYou"" Koala.  Look, honey! The crazy thing talks! I'm so cuddly! I like you!  That's right. He's so cuddly.  And better yet, he likes you.  Finally. And the zoo will officially be ours in Tminus three... ...two... ...and showtime! Here I come! Who put that bar there? That tickles! Did too! Did not! Did too! Did not! Out of my way, ya bum! There's that motheaten koala! I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk. How about an autograph?! Don't... Birds! Find the string on his back! So you're havin' a really nice day! Guys. Off my cocaptain, now. Sorry, Samson. That didn't hurt. I almost forgot to tell you. I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally. Slow down, Romeo. You are a squirrel and she is... Perfect, right? Look, I know what you're sayin'. Believe me, I got my eyes wide open. Watch where you're goin', you big! Bridget. Don't stare at my spots, Benny. My eyes are up here. Of course. I'm so sorry. Oh, this is for you, honey. It goes around your left hoof. Did you get that out of the trash? You did! You trashpicker! I'm not a trashpicker. I'm a recycler. That's a lot more romantic. Isn't it? Romantic? Sam, come here. Romantic? Don't mention romance to me, Benny. I've never had a boyfriend. That settles it. I accept the job... of boyfriend number one. Benny, only the female orbweaver spider will date a male onetwentieth her size. So there's hope! And then she eats him. But at least he dies happy. Let's get Ryan, dude! Dude! We said that at the same time! Dude. Hey! Hey, Ryan. Listen, I'm headin' down to the game. I'm gonna see you there, right? Come on, Ryan. We need you. You're our biggest fan. Yo, Samson! I'm your number one fan, man! Thanks, man. Right back at ya! You were saying, Dad? Listen. About this afternoon, I was just trying... Dad, fine. I'll go to your game, all right? OK. I'll... see you there, then. Come on, dude. Dude. Guess who's here? Eze. Duke. Man, he always guesses. We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game. You in? Let's go, bro! The Ryanator. I'm comin' down. Fish heads! Get your icecold fish heads! Now eyeballfree! We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up. Here comes Victor. What a beauty! Yeah, sweep! Heading straight for the bull'seye! This could be it, folks! Bowango! Yes! Oh, yeah! That's gonna be tough to beat. What? ""Tough to beat""? That's just the way we like it, right, guys? I can't believe this! If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off! And yours! We cannot lose to flightless birds! Whoa, whoa. No one is losing anything around here. As long as we stay focused. By the way, has anyone seen Ryan? Oh! I know! Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl. Thanks, Lar. You betcha! Nigel! Nigel! Will you sign my dolly? Not again. Nigel, ignore them. I'm so cuddly! I like you!  You're so cuddly! We love you! That's it! I am not cuddly! I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London! Fear me! Get him! Get him! Get him! Help me! Girls! Put him down. I am not a doll! Cushy tushy! Leave my bum alone! Nigel! Get your paws off my girlfriend! Benny, I am not your girlfriend! Really nice day!  What is up with Samson's team tonight? Brutal! Benny? Oh, my gosh! Who knows mouthtomouth? I do! What was that? Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby. Get off my nose. I'm so cuddly, I like you!  Stop saying that! G'day, mate!  Cannonball! Next year, I should just coach. Check it. The Thomson gazelle. Zero to 50 in fourpointfive seconds. The ultimate fleeing machine. There is no substitute. Let's get a closer look at these slim jims. Shall we? I think we shall. Maybe we should just go to the game. I thought you wanted to be wild. Your dad chased gazelles. Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us. He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were... Gazelles. Yeah, gazelles or somethin'. Ready, man? We'd better not. Oh, yeah? Are you gonna stop us? Guys, guys. Here we go! The whole series comes down to this throw! There's no tomorrow! It's do or die! Ya know what I mean. Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use... ...the secret play. The secret play! Hey, everybody, guess what? We're gonna use the secret play! Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret. OK. Follow my lead. I'm going to need a double effort from everybody. Absolutely, captain. Triple effort if you want, sir. Good. Ready, and... Break! Quiet. On three, dude. One, two... No! Now you did it, Ryan. Feelin' mean, Donald? Bring it on! Folks, there's pressure on the big guy! Ready, Bridget? Ready. Ready, Benny? Ready! Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose. I can't... hold it! Oh, no! What are you doin'? And here comes Samson. Look at that guy. Is he a beauty or what? Larry! Bridget! Sweep! What a recovery! He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job! Sweep faster, Larry! Sweep, sweep! I am! Come on, man! Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor... Watch it, Victor! Watch it yourself, see? Nigel, how are we looking? This could be trouble, folks! Sweep, sweep, sweep. This is cheating and you will die for this. I can't hear you, Nigel. Move left a bit... OK. Move left and hit! Larry, no! Tallyho! What a move! Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtlecurling history! Oh, no! I can't believe my eyes! No! Looks like Samson might have choked! Nice! Yes! Unbelievable! Samson and his team have clinched the title! No, wait! I've called it too soon! What the heck? The penguins have done it! They're zoo champs for the first time! Stampede? Stampede! Please! Stop! Watch out! Dude. Busted. Catastrophic. Told you I'd come to the game. You think this is funny? You just endangered everyone in the zoo! I'm sorry. For what? Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game? All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk. If you just... What's the problem? Is all this because you can't roar? Ryan, I didn't mean that. Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree? I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father. Ryan, I didn't... 'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier. Ryan, I'm sorry. Ryan! Please don't... ...leave. Bye, Ryan! Thanks for coming to the game. And you were worried he wouldn't show up. Not good. No one listens to the squirrel. I don't know what to do anymore, Benny. I've tried everything. Everything? You tried everything? What are you saying? I'm saying you have to tell him the truth. I don't think I could do that, Benny. I mean... What's he gonna think of me when he finds out? I don't know. But if you don't tell him... ...you're gonna lose him, Sammy. The green boxes. OK, they're all loaded up! You don't think I know that? Get movin'! I changed my mind! I don't wanna go! Help! Ryan. Help me! Watch out! Sam! Wait for us! Dad! Ryan! Dad! Don't let them take me! No! Ryan! Help! No! Dad! Help me! Ryan! Benny, we need that truck followed. Check. Get me... the pigeons. I am wanting snake eyes! Come on, baby. Come on, just throw it. Thanks. Hamir! You are the great loser of all time! What offerings must I make, I wonder? Hamir! Hamir! Get a grip on yourself! Benny! I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back! No, no. It's Ryan. He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away! We've got to find him! That is not good! Not good at all! I know! I know! I am telling him, you crazy pigeon! The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head... Hamir? I can't understand... Spikes! Just tell me where the green boxes go. Stiff lady, spikies? Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her! To her! Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell. When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boatboat and never return! I am sorry for this. I really am. Hello? No. Not good. Not good. You always say that. I keep on sayin' it. No one's listenin'. Like a broken record here. OK. When do we leave, Sammy? Yeah, when do we leave? It's not ""we."" It's me. Let's make this clear. This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going. We'll come too! We're not afraid. Are we, guys? Afraid? No. You know koalas. More like ""scared of things."" Ryan's like a cub to all of us. Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate. You know, there's that famous... A koala once said, ""We will fight them... with peaches."" Yeah. Anyway. So we're helping, whatever it takes. You want to leave with me? OK. If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at... ...stuffed... OK! ...or worse, then fine. I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover. Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast. Nobody's leaving but me. Got it? You're the boss. You bet. You got the big hair. Absolutely. Yeah, that's good, Sammy. Hey, way to weed out the weak links. Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan? Don't worry about a thing, big guy. I got it all taken care of. I know this city... ...like the back of my paw. We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, badaboom, past Broadway and... You're there! What are you doing here? What? We're going to help you find Ryan! She said, ""We're gonna help you find Ryan."" Oh, great. Hey, guys. I've got popcorn up my bum. Do I look trashy in this? OK, here's my... Here's my overall plan. Where are we going? I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever! And now I have to worry about you three? All right, fine. When do we get off of this thing, Benny? Benny's here? Yeah, he's right there. Benny? Benny! Great. Now what am I gonna do? Guys! Guys! I think we should duck! What is she saying? She said, ""Duck down!"" Duck! I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or... That wasn't my paw. It was this! I didn't steal it. I borrowed it. It'll light the way to Ryan. The walls are moving. Right, right. The walls... The walls are moving! Larry, hold your breath! Larry, stay straight! Everybody out! All right, don't panic. What we've got to do... This is definitely not good. Samson! Give me your hoof! Help! Larry! The garbage! It lives! Guys? OK, anybody? I'm freakin' out. What's the hold up? Hello? We're over here, Nigel. Right. I'll be there in a minute. Think. What did Benny say? Couple of lefts, couple of rights. Bridget, can you see the green lady? I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change. How far are you away? You in a different continent? Is that you, Larry? Up here, Nige. You're a very furry snake. Guys... We don't want to draw attention to ourselves. Dogs. This should be fun for you, Samson. Nigel! Grab Bridget! What? Run! I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up! Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds? All part of the plan. This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip. Page ten of the Predator's Playbook. What next? Page 11? Go on, you mutts! Stupid dogs, we could've taken you. Taken you to a... To a disco! Larry, improvise! Larry, that's not helping. OK. You dogs think you got bark? Well, Samson's got roar! Show 'em, Sam. Dig deep, Samson. You're a lion. Be a lion. Look at that guy! Sam, they are frothing at the mouth. OK... Larry, coil! Check! Sam! I improvised. Now jump! Down there? Yes! We're leaving, Larry! Teensy question, Samson. With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild? You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them? I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget. We have to find Ryan, remember? What is this stinky place? It... ...appears to be a human bathing area. You mean humans don't lick themselves clean? Disgusting! They're hopeless. It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain. I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself. No hurry, but is there a plan? Of course there's a plan. We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with... Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling. Wasn't me. What? Smooth move, Nigel! Oh, boy! Twins! OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something! Everybody... stay calm. Calm? Not good. Yo. Boo! I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough. Far from your borough! I love it. We're going to the big water. Nigel, show them what we're looking for. Like this? I think it's in her right hand. And isn't she blue? I can't do blue. No idea. You? Doesn't even register. You're battin' zero, kid. Do the thing with... Make your bloody mind up. The big female with the spikes on her melon! They're tourists. All right, tourists, listen up. Ya gotta get to Battery Park. First take the Broadway culvert. Down the Broadway culvert? What's wrong with that? They get lost at the sewage plant! Get outta here! What are you talking about? How would you send 'em? You're sendin' 'em the wrong way! The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction. That is true. All right. Guys, you gonna help or not? Yeah, sure. Of course we're gonna help ya's. We're one big family, right? Except for that guy there. He scares the... You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine? Are ya? I apologize. He never got over being flushed down the toilet. Yeah. Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood. It's a jungle down here. Stan, you know who that is? What? No. That's one of them talkin' kawana bears! How ya doing? I'm so cuddly! I like you! I've seen a lot of those things floatin' here in the sewer. That's good! You're makin' me laugh over here. Just wait for me! Are we in the right place? Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction. Sam, do you see anything up there? I sure do. Well, well, well. There she is, like Hamir said. And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time. Guys, look. We know the box Ryan's in is green. It's gotta be around here, so I need you to... Yeah. So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there. It hasn't left yet! We can make it! Let's go! Hold on, Larry! Which way now? Yeah, which way? Run! No! No! Ryan's on that thing! We've got to stop it! We can't, Sam! I don't care! No, Sammy, you'll drown! Sam! I failed. Again. I only count one failure. It's big, but it's just one. Goodbye, Ryan. We're gonna miss ya. Samson! What on earth is going on? It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo. Perhaps now is a good time to improvise. What? Great! One problem down... Far out. Cool. One disaster to go. What are you doing? We're headed for the other boat! How do we steer? Who knows how to steer? None of us. We're animals. Great! Hold on, Larry. Do that again. Do what? Whatever you just did, but the opposite! But I don't know my opposites! No, Larry, like this! I think I've got it. Well, that was easy. Oh, dear. Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes? This isn't so difficult. I'm the lion of the sea! Well done, sir. Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel. You're brilliant. I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat. What, nothing? Nothing. He's gone. No. There! Nelson! The green boxes! You're sure, eh? And there's my buddies! And my love! Let's go in! We'll head away from the sun. No, towards the sun. To the north. Starboard... Leftboard. Just follow my finger. Please. You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head. Oh, my! It's a bat! It's a bat! Get it off me! Get it off me! Benny! Benny? Geese! Are you all right? Yes, my princess. Benny, you made it! You're my best friend. Best friends should stick together. Even notsobest friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck. Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you. Just so you know. Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there? Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way. And we're in luck! How's it goin', eh? Canadian geese! Experts at intercontinental travel. Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas? I'll take it from here. My son's out there. We really need your help. Can you lead us to that boat? No problem, eh? Just follow us and Bob's your uncle. Try not to lag too far behind, eh? Hey, Benny, thanks. And FYI, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck. Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you? Bareback. Oh, brother. Sammy? We going to the wild now? I think we are, Larry. I can't take it anymore. He's taunting us! Listen! Stop laughing at us, you solar twit! Captain Bligh, sir! Are the ice cream cones ready? The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny. Nigel, please. If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir! Nigel. I don't care if I drown, I'm getting off this death cruise right now. Iceberg! Permission to go down with the ship, sir. Hang on! Stuff that! Run! Swim! Nigel? Look, I'm a starfish. Guys, look. Gosh. Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here. Yeah... a lifetime. What the heck? Wow! Look! They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild. Larry. Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes. I just can't figure out why. It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see? They go in... Who is this guy? It's all right, Nigel. Think it has anything to do with that? Hang on a second. Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense. You're right. Those animals are being rescued. Ryan? Ryan! Oh, no! Ryan! We've got to move fast! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Where are you, buddy? Ryan! I can't believe it! Samson! I was so close. He was right there! We'll never find him now! Come here! Will you get a hold of yourself? Use your instincts. I don't want to run anymore. Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra. Ryan? Everything's under control. Temporary setback. I got it. I got Ryan's scent! He got it? I mean, he got it! Let's go! Hooray! Wait for us! I'm not designed for this! I want a car. Hey, guys, I found him! Ryan! Doesn't anyone knock anymore? Where's my son? Did he come through here? Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here. Hello? Come on out, baby lion! Your dad's here! Well, what do you know? There's a whole pride of lions here! Funky. I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult. I... I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while. Exactly! You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in. Excellent. Fantastic! We get to see the legend in action. I'd love to, but we just don't have time. We got the time, Sammy. Just... And then you do this. And then this bit. Rip him apart! The horror. I can't bear to watch! But I have to. Go on. Get out of here. The legend dropped his dinner. Oh, boy. What's wrong? I'm not good enough for you to eat? No. It's just I'm allergic to nuts. Now I get it. You're gonna toy with me? Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up? How exciting. Come on, guys. Ryan can't be far. Hey! I'm not finished with you! I am a delicacy. My flesh has fruity wood notes! Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre. That's Samson the Wild. You call this wild? This is a cat! A big, fat, tame pussycat! OK, that's enough! The pussycat hissed at me! Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection. While we're at it, could you slap me in the face? No. What are you, a twit? Ignore him. Don't bother! I'm leaving. You're weird. Run for your lives! It's a lion with moral issues! And I've had it with you too! Thanks a lot for wrecking my day! Teensy question. Or more like a... a sort of a query meets a statement. That hyrax back there? It was sort of like you couldn't eat him. Yeah, and what about those dogs? There was no munching there, either. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're... A vegetarian? Nope. That's not what I was going to say. You were going to say... It's almost like... You're not from... The wild? Well, you're right. I'm not from the wild. What? I'm just a phony. Truth is I can't protect you out here. Please just go back to the boat. I've got to find my son. Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8inch squirrel protecting us. Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes. So that means... We are going to die! Hey, guys! Guys! Will the three of you calm down? How could he lie to us? We're his best friends. Sure. Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth. OK, yeah, whatever. Whatever. Let's just go back to the boat, then. The fierce, the proud, the wild... Rubbish! But wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Where you goin'? Stop right there! Stop! Bridget, if you go, I'm... I'm breaking up with you. We were never going out in the first place. Then we're taking a break. Nigel! All right! Hey, listen! I know you're scared. But at least we got each other. Sammy's got nobody. He's out there all alone. And... so is Ryan. OK, OK, focus, Samson. He's got to be out there somewhere. You'll find him. I mean, how big can this place be, anyway? Ryan! Hey there, little fella. You're lost too, huh? You remind me of my buddy back home. A bloodthirsty monster! Where? Where? He's a killer! Get away from my baby! Calm down, lady! Won't anyone save my baby? Byebye. Ryan! Ryan! Sammy! I wasn't meant for the wild. I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G. Come on, this isn't scary, is it? It's just leaves and vines and... Oh, that's my foot. Nigel, keep a lookout back there. You too, Larry! Okeydokey. Oh, I see. All right, OK, yeah. You're giving me the silent treatment. Like I care. Nigel! I gave you an order. Would a little ""Sir, yes, sir!"" kill ya? Nigel. That's not funny, Nigel. He's gone! We're doomed. Nigel! First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel! I do believe in zoos. Larry, you're tensing up! I do, I do, I do. Don't panic. I'm in charge. That's why we're panicking! I say we fan out and circle. What are we, peacocks? We don't fan, we run. Run for your lives, everybody! Guys, I've got an idea. Why don't we ask them? It's OK... They, you see, they got hooves. That means they don't hunt. They graze. But they're licking their chops. I'll take the one with the funny knees. The funny knee? Benny, no! Benny? Get them. Just, hey, back off. I'm sorry, I'm not that kind of koala bear. Right. Excuse me? Hello? Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala? Sprechen Sie koala?  Right. Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing? G'day, mate  G'day, mate  G'day, mate  G'day, mate  G'day, mate  G'day, mate  What a strange place for a party. Very good, very organized. Can I use your toilet? I'm having a  Really nice day  Really nice day  Really nice day  I'm having a  Really nice day  Really nice day  Really nice day  Why don't you all  Tickle away, tickle away  They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts... ...but they're not bad dancers. I'm so cuddly  I like you  I'm so cuddly  I like you  Stepkick, pivotkick, walk, walk, walk. I'm having a  Really nice day  Oh, no! Tickle away  Tickle away  I'm so cuddly, I like you  Good day  What is that? I am Kazar. Leader. Prophet. Choreographer. And with your help... carnivore! No! Don't kill me! I've had such a weird life! This is not fair. Oh, I get it. A yoga retreat. Ryan! You can do this. Use your instincts. Follow your instincts. Use your instincts. OK. Down this way. This way. A lion cub. We must tell Kazar. It's my turn to tell him. You got to last time. No, I didn't. Yes, you did! Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run. Koalas are very busy bees. If I could... I'll just buzz along to the door... For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion. Today, we put our hooves down. No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain. Well, yes. I should say so. There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us. But I always believed in the Omen. The Omen! Right. Remind me again? Sent down by the gods years ago... Oh, no! Not you! I'm so cuddly! I like you!  Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey... ...to predator. Hold it. I am the Great Him? The Great Him? Him. So this is all your fault! That's it! You! Kazar! Kazar! Don't listen to him! Kazar! Over here! Kazar! Over here! How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him! But... but we found a lion cub! You did? Was he with a big lion? With big hair? Well, a mullet, really. Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you? Well, like any Great Him, I travel with an entourage. Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here. And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number! I lost count for one verse. Stepkick, pivotkick, walk, walk, walk. Why do we even bother rehearsing? A good chorus line is so hard to put together. Take to the skies! We're taking! We're taking! Find them! Yes, sir. Bring us those lions! The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy. We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him! Holy moly! Holy moly  Holy moly  You are our king! Looky, looky who's there. Surprise! No! Sorry we're late for dinner! That's pathetic! Get off! That didn't hurt! Stop! Ryan! No! I'm coming, son! Dad? Help! Let's scram! Ryan! What are you doing here? I can't believe it! I found you. How'd you find me? Are you all right? Are you hurt? Your paw. I got trapped in that box. It's OK, son. And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle... ...then those vultures came and tried to kill me. You wouldn't have been scared. I was. I have to tell you something. What? Listen. Get 'em, Dad! Run! Run! Dad, you should be chasing them! Like you used to! Those were just stories! But now's your chance to show me for real! This way! Dad? What's goin' on? Just get up into that tree! I think we lost them. What's the deal? They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys! You could kick their rumps! Ryan, I can't fight them. You donkeychickens! Get back here! Ryan! I can't fight them. What do you mean? I was young... ...still just a cub. Ladies and gentlemen. Children of all ages. Samson! Swallow that fear and stand tall! Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life! The day he discovers his roar! Dad, I can't do it! Now, go! Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah! Samson! Dig deep! I should have known. If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar. Dad? Dad! Dad! Please! Dad. When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from. Especially those closest to me. I should have told you sooner. But... all those stories you tell? I'm so sorry, Ryan. Everything you told me was a lie? Dad! Hang on, son. Help! Ryan! Ryan! Run! Not so fast, Tigger. Dad! Ryan! Dad! Help! Ryan. Help! Dad! Ryan. Dad! Help me! What? Wait! What? What? Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey! Hey! Hey! Get off me! What is goin' on here? Stinky does not speak. It rolls like a little ball. Wait. You guys think I'm a? Achtung, Stinky! Less talk, more roll. Ja.  Roll! Roll! What the? Hey! Rolling the dung is good for tight buns! I'll give you something to roll about! It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that! Bridget? Larry! They're gone. I gotta find them! No! I gotta find Samson first! No! First... Sam. Sam! Bridget! Larry! Oh, Ryan! You're alive! Good to see you guys. Where's my hug? Larry. There it is. It's good to see you too. What are you guys doing here? We came here with your father to find you. And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us. I wish he were. But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff. What? What? I don't think he made it. I don't see how he could. Oh, Ryan. I'm sorry I got you into this. Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you. What's this? Where's the other lion? Right. Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and... Why are you looking at me like that? That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag! You klutz. You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion! Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension. What about the rest of us? Stepkick, pivotkick! Ouch! I twisted a hoof! You work and you work. Then they break your heart. There goes my career! Prepare the sacrifices! Why did I let him go off by himself? He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch. Bet I could catch you. Please. My natural predator is fuel inject... What? I knew you weren't really gone. I knew it! Come on, I knew it! We're still buddies, right? I lost Ryan. There were too many. They just took him. Who? Who took him? Wildebeests. The freaks with the hooves! They got Larry and Bridget too. Couldn't fight, couldn't... Come on, Sam. You're a lion. You come from a long line of kings. Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild. But fighting's in your blood! No. I'll never be a real lion. Wrong! You are a real lion. Doesn't matter where you're from: Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl. It's what's in here. That determines who you are! At least, that's what you always told your son. Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you. Who else is gonna teach him how to roar? That's it, Sammy. That's it. Let's go find my son... and my friends. Yeah! Nothing's gonna stop us! Except that we have no idea where we're going! Follow your instincts. Follow your instincts. What is that? My... instincts? Benny? You're almost there. That settles it, then. My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me. Benny, look. The freaks with hooves! Ryan's in there. You can't just barge in. That's suicide! Benny, get out of my way! Don't listen to the rat. Hey, who are you calling a rat? You, of course. You'll give away our position. I'll have you written up for that! Fool! You blew our cover! Men! Scatter! Not so fast! Look who I got, Sammy. It's your lion instincts. Who are you guys? Our names aren't important. I'm Cloak. He's Camo. We're covert agents. Why have you been leading me around? That's classified. Topsecret. The wildebeests have gone mad. Cloak. It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's... Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there? That's needtoknow. They did. They think the koala's a god. You're the worst covert agent! Oh, yeah? Then why can I do this? Men! Hey! No! Stop! Sammy! Idiot! That maneuver's confidential. It's secret. This one's confidential. Cloak! And this one's restricted. Supersecret. Topsecret. This is ultrasecret! Enough! No more! Show 'em the supertopsecret ""no more?"" Gotcha! No! I got an idea. Who is this Great Him, anyway? I'll take him on. I'm the Great Her! I'll show Him a thing or two. I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake. Oh, my. You have got to be kidding me. Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but I will kick your... Silence! Why, you little... Silence, again! You do not speak to me! Nigel, what's the deal? Great Him, shall we prepare the feast? Yes, we shall! What's on the menu? Them. Oh, no. Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends... God, friends, god, friends. God, I... Well, that was subtle. Prepare the meat fire! Wait! We cannot cook them without... ...onion! Onions. Onions. Onions. Well, that was fast. Let the ritual begin. Move it! I am so mad at you! Wait! We also need... hats! Do we not have the party hats of death? I've got mine! And before the feast, we must all... What the? ...levitate... ...and spin uncontrollably! And feel a bit sick. How do I stop this thing? Guys. Benny? Look, a squirrel! Larry! We've got a plan. Follow me. We? I can fly! Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power. Be humbled. Only the Great Him can do this! Volcanic gas! Our cover's blown! Major malfunction! Abandon ship! Oh, boy. Well, about time you got here. Great Him, it's another miracle! You've delivered us a real lion! Blag, your luck has turned. Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight. Nigel, we've got to create a distraction. Hang on a sec! I've got miracles comin' out my ears! Ready? Stand back... ...as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size! Dad? My dad's alive! Guys, my dad made it! Ryan, no! Hurry, I got to see him! Whack, whack, whack! Dad! What? Ryan! I planned this. Ryan, no! At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted. Stay close. Prey has become predator! And predator has become prey! And the hoof finally trumps the claw! Come on, Dad! Let's show these turkeyjerkies who's at the top of the food chain! Let's eat the brat first. Over my dead body! Yeah. Dad! He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something! Why don't we use the secret play? I know. Shut up, Larry. That's stupid. No! It's brilliant! They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen. But look who's laughing now! Little to the left. Yeah. No! Little to the right! Next floor: bottom of the food chain! Ding! Fire! We gotta find something bigger! I know where we can find something bigger. Ready, Ryan? Dig deep! You should have stayed at home. Now our shrine will become your tomb. Fire! Ryan! Ryan! I don't typically eat dessert before the main course! Get away from my son! Ryan. Ryan, are you still with me? It's OK, Dad. I just want you to know I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have. Ryan. How touching. But then, last words usually are. Finish them. What are you doing? I command you to attack them, like true predators! We're tired of pretending to be something we're not. But most of all, we're tired of you. Blag. Fine. I'll kill them myself! Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories: Dig deep. Oh, yeah, baby! Let's go. Yeah. Come on, let's get out of here! Get out of here! And for the record, I've always hated your choreography. It's so... '80s. That's right! Run! Run like the cowardly prey that you are! I will hunt you down! Everyone! To the boat! Top of the food chain, Ma! Top of the food chain... I'm so cuddly! I like you!  I'm so cuddly! I like you!  I'm so cuddly! I like you!  I'm so cuddly!  Hurry! We're never gonna make it! Push, you crazy, hairy monsters! Push! Larry, throw it in reverse! Reverse throwing! At least I saw the wild before it disappeared. I can still see it. It's right... Here. I found my roar. We both did, son. You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild. I don't think anybody's gonna believe it. Incoming! I'm so cuddly!  Cuddly! I'm so cuddly!  I know you're cuddly. But can you float? I'm having a  Really nice day  Really nice day  Really nice day  Stepkick left! Really nice day  Stepkick right! Splendid. No! Smashing. Hey! Stupendous! Are you guys sure about this? Operation SnakeOver is now complete. Hey, look, everyone! I'm a secret agent! Bridget, I get it. You're more than a tall, lanky goddess. You're a strong, independent female. You don't need to be defined by your relationship and I, I respect that. It's about time. What was that? Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby. Oh, yeah yeah! Really nice day  Really nice day  Look out! Stepkick, pivotkick, walk, walk, walk. Yes! Did y'all see that? Check this! Go, Blag! Go, Blag! Go, Blag! Hey, Blag.

Jimmy, that was unforgettable! l know you don't like touching... but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause l gotta hug ya! Ha ha ha ha! Hey, you hugged me back. Oh, l promised myself l wouldn't cry. Does anyone have a tissue? Morphy, we gotta make tracks. l know. You never quit. do you ? Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha! l was merely checking to make sure... our last longboat was safe and secure. Mmm. Well... that should hold it. Heh heh heh. l taught you too well. lf you don't mind, we'd just as soon avoid prison. Little morphy here, he's a free spirit. Being in a cage, it'd break his heart. Ohh! What say you ship out with us, lad? You and me, Hawkins and Silver... full of ourselves and no ties to anyone! You know, when l got on this boat... l would've taken you up on that offer in a second... but, uh, l met this old cyborg... and he taught me that l could chart my own course.

Up,Disney,2000,2009,Animation,"O What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity, a lost world in South America. Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science. Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit? Why, our subject today, Charles Muntz! The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, the Spirit of Adventure, in New Hampshire this week, completing a yearlong expedition to the lost world. This lighterthanair craft was designed by Muntz himself and is longer than 22 prohibition paddy wagons placed end to end. And here comes the adventurer now. Never apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort. It's a veritable floating palace in the sky, complete with doggy bath and mechanical canine walker. And, Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees. And how! Adventure is out there!  But what has Muntz brought back this time? Gentlemen, I give you the monster of Paradise Falls!  And, golly, what a swell monster this is! But what's this? Scientists cry foul. The National Explorer's Society accuses Munitz of fabricating the skeleton. No! The organization strips Muntz of his membership.  Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast alive! ! promise to capture the beast alive, and I will not come back until I do!  And so, the explorer's off to clear his name. Bon voyage, Charles Muntz, and good luck capturing the monster of Paradise Falls!  Here's Charles Muntz piloting his famous dirigible.  He hurdles Pikes Peak. He hurdles the Grand Canyon.  He hurdles Mount Everest.  He goes around Mount Everest. Is there nothing he cannot do? Yes, as Muntz himself says, ""Adventure is...""â Adventure is out there! Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard! Must get Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore! Hold together, old girl.

You know him.  Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get big, I'm going where he's going, South America. It's like America, but south. Wanna know where I'm gonna live? ""Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."" I ripped this right out of a library book.  I'm gonna move my clubhouse there and park it right next to the falls. Who knows what lives up there. And once I get there? Well, I'm saving these pages for all the adventures I'm gonna have. Only I just don't know how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls. That's it! You can take us there in a blimp! Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross your heart! Good, you promised. No backing out. Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye! Adventure is out there! You know, you don't talk very much. I like you! Wow.         o     Hah!         Stevie, throw me a deuce! Quite a sight, huh, Ellie? Uh! Mail's here. Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh, brother. Hmm... Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen. Need any help there? No. Yes! Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house. Well, just to let you know, my boss will be happy to take this old place off your hands, and for double his last offer! What do you say to that? Uh, I take that as a ""no,"" then? I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear. You poured prune juice in his gas tank. Yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him.  You in the suit. Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie! I am not with him! This is serious! He's out to get your house. Tell your boss he can have our house. Really? When I'm dead! I'll take that as a maybe. Order now, you get the camera, you get the printer, 4x optical zoom, Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card.  ""Good afternoon. My name is Russell. ""And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12. ""Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?"" No. I could help you cross the street. No. I could help you cross your yard. No. I could help you cross your porch. No. Well, I gotta help you cross something. No. I'm doing fine. ""Good afternoon. My name is Russell.""  Kid... Kid. ""And I am a Wilderness Explorer ""in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."" 1... Slow down. Kid! ""Are you in need of any assistance..."" Thank you, but I don't need any help! ""...today, sir?"" Ow. Proceed. ""Good afternoon..."" But skip to the end! See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It's my Assisting the Elderly badge. If I get it, I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer. ""The wilderness must be explored!"" Caw, caw! Raar!  It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges. So, you want to assist an old person? Yep! Then I'll be a Senior Wilderness Explorer. You ever heard of a snipe? Snipe? Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me. Me, me! I'll do it! I don't know. It's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in. I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen! I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past... Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe. Here, snipey, snipey. Bring it back here when you find it. Snipe! Okay, keep her coming. Keep coming. And stop. Stop. Stop! Why... Hey! Hey, you! What do you... What do you think you're doing? I am so sorry, sir. Don't touch that! No, no, no. Let me take care of that for you. Get away from our mailbox! Hey. Sir, ll... I don't want you to touch it! Ow!   Steve, you all right?  Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen. You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this. The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay? What do I do now, Ellie?  Morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. You ready to go?  Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this? I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I wanna say one last goodbye to the old place. Sure. Take all the time you need, sir. That's typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time. You think he'd take better care of his house.    So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls! Heh! We're on our way, Ellie.      Huh? Hmm.    Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell. What are you doing out here, kid? I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.  Please let me in. No. Oh, alright, you can come...  ...in.   Huh. I've never been in a floating house before.  Goggles. Look at this stuff. Wow! You're going on a trip? ""Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."" You're going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Don't touch that! You'll soil it. You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you will have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Whoa. Is this how you steer your house? Does it really work?  Kid, would you stop with the... This makes it go right. Let go of that... And that way's left. Knock it off! Hey, look! Buildings. That building's so close I could almost touch it. Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen. Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! Hey! I can see your house from here. Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoal!  Well, that's not gonna work. I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus. Did you know that the cumulonimbus forms when warm air rises over cool air? Stayed up all night blowing up balloons...for what? ...and that's how we get lightning. That's nice, kid. Mr. Fredricksen?  There's a storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble...  What are you doing over there? Look.  See? Cumulonimbus.   My pack! Got ya!     I thought you were dead. What happened? I steered us. I did. I steered the house. Steered us? After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap. So went ahead and steered us down here.  Yeah. Sure.  Can't tell where we are. Oh, we're in South America, all right. It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. GP... What? My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet.  With this baby, we'll never be lost! Oops.  We'll get you down, find a bus stop, you just tell the man you wanna go back to your mother. Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls. There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare. No, I'll just use my city bus pass. Whoa. That's gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house. Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer? Well, we're up pretty high. Could take hours to get down.  That thing was... building or something.  What was that, Mr. Fredricksen? We can't be close to the ground yet.  Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't! Wait, wait. Wait!  Russell, hang on! Hey! Whoa! Whoa!  Aaaagggghhhhh! Walk back. Walk back. Okay. Come on. Come on.   Where... Where are we? This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.  Don't worry, Ellie. I got it. There it is. Ellie, it's so beautiful. We made it. We made it! Russelll We could float right over there! Climb up. Climb up! You mean, assist you? Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Okay. I'll climb up.   Watch it! Sorry.  Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?  You on the porch yet?   What? That's it? I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Great.  Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge? What are you talking about? We could walk your house to the falls. Walk it? Yeah! After all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly with no rap music or flashdancing. Uhhuh. We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens... Sand. ...we're not getting to the falls. I found sand! Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there. This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted. Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw, caw! Raar!  Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again? Hey, let's play a game. It's called ""see who can be quiet the longest."" Cool! My mom loves that game!      Darn thing!  Come on, Russell. Would you hurry it up? I'm tired. And my knee hurts. Which knee? My elbow hurts, and I have to go to the bathroom. I asked you about that five minutes ago. Well, 1 didn't have to go then! I don't wanna walk anymore. Can we stop? Russell, if you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you. There are no tigers in South America. Zoology.  On, for the love of Pete! Go on into the bushes and do your business. Okay! Here! Hold my stuff. I've always wanted to try this. Mr. Fredricksen, am I supposed to dig the hole before or after?  None of my concern! Oh. It's before! Bah! La la lla la lal  Huh? Tracks? Snipe. Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe. Snipe. Huh?    Ha! Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer, so I'm a friend to all of nature. Want some more?  Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out. Come on. Come on. Don't be afraid, little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... Giant snipe.  I found the snipe! Oh! Did you? Are they tall? Oh, yes, they're very tall. Do they have a lot of colors? They do, indeed! Do they like chocolate? Oh, yes... chocolate?  Gah! What is that thing? It's a snipe! There's no such thing as a snipe! But you said snipes eat your... Whoal! Hey!   Go on! Get out of here! Go on!   Whoa!  Whoa!  Careful, Russell! Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen. It likes me. Whoa! Russell! No, stop! That tickles. Get out of here! Go on! Get!     Uhoh. No, no, no! Kevin! It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice. Kevin? Yeah. That's his name I just gave him. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram! Hey! That's mine!    Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!  Go on! Beat it!   Can we keep him? Please? I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him. I'll change his newspapers. No. ""An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole."" That doesn't even rhyme. Yeah, it does. Hey, look. Kevin. What? Get down! You're not allowed up there!   You come down here right now! Sheesh! Can you believe this, Ellie? Ellie? Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. She said for you to let me. But I told him no. I told you no! NO. I see you back there. Go on! Get out of here! Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while. Hey, are you okay over there?  Uh... Hello? Oh! Hello, sir! Thank goodness. It's nice to know someone else is up here. I can smell you. What? You can smell us? I can smell you. Hey. You were talking to a rock. Hey, that one looks like a turtle. Look at that one! That one looks like a dog.  It is a dog! What? We're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. Hey, I like dogs. We have your dog! Whoa! Wonder who he belongs to. Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained. Shake. Uhhuh. Speak. Hi, there.  Did that dog just say ""Hi, there""? Oh, yes. My name is Dug. I have just met you, and I love you.  My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master, and he made me this collar so that I may talk. Squirrel! My master is good and smart. It's not possible. Oh, it is, because my master is smart. Cool! What do these do, boy? Hey, would you...  I use that collar...  ...10 talk with. I would be happy if you stopped. Russell, don't touch that! It could be radioactive or something! I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one, and I've been on the scent. I am a great tracker. Did I mention that?  Hey, that is the bird. I have never seen one up close, but this is the bird. May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner? Yes, yes, take it. And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog. I can bark.  And here's howling.   Can we keep him? Please, please, please! No. But it's a talking dog! It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls. Please be my prisoner. Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!  Oh! Here it is. I picked up the bird's scent! Wail 2 minute, wait a minute! What is this?  Chocolate. I smell chocolate. I'm getting prunes and denture cream! Who are they? Oh, man, Master will not be pleased. We better tell him someone took the bird. Right, Alpha? No. Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again. Find the scent, my compadres, and you too shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage. Hey, Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar. You must've bumped it. Yeah, your voice sounds funny!  Beta! Gamma! Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!   Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning. No, no, no. But maybe Dug would. You might wanna ask him. Yeah. I wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission. Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool's errand will keep him most occupied. Most occupied indeed.  Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now? Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat. You are wise, my trusted lieutenant. This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in, Dug. Hi, Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny. I know, I know! Have you seen the bird? Why, yes. The bird is my prisoner now. Yeah, right!  Impossible! Where are you? I am here with the bird, and I will bring it back, and then you will like me. Gotta go. Hey, Dug, who you talking to? No, wait, wait! What's Dug doing? Why's he with that small mailman? Where are they?  There he is. Come on! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner. Dug, stop bothering Kevin! That man there says I can take the bird, and I love that man there like he is my master. I am not your master! I am warning you once again, bird. Hey! Quit it! I am jumping on you now, bird. Russell, at this rate, we'll never get to the falls. Here, bird.    I am nobody's master, got it? I don't want you here, and I don't want you here! I'm stuck with you! And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three... A balll Oh, boy, oh, boy! A ball! Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah? Yes, I do! I do ever so want the ball. Go get it! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! I will get it and then bring it back! Quick, Russell. Give me some chocolate. Why? Just give it to me! Bird. Bird!  Come on, Russell. Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.  What are we doing? Hey, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me.  I think that did the trick. Hi, Master. Afternoon.   Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie. Which one's the front? Oh, boy. Is this step three or step five?  There.   All done! That's for you. Oh... Tents are hard. Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy, with the GPMs and the badges? Yeah, but can I tell you a secret? No. All right. Here it goes. I never actually built a tent before. There, I said it. You've been camping before, haven't you? Well, never outside. Well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent? I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff. Well, why don't you try him sometime. Maybe he'll surprise you. Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much. He's gotta be home sometime. Well, I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name? Phyllis isn't my mom. Oh.  But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge. So, he can show me about tents then, right? Hey, why don't you get some sleep? Don't wanna wake up the traveling flea circus.  Mr. Fredricksen? Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him.  Can Kevin go with us? All right, he can come. Promise you won't leave him? Yeah. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. What have I got myself into, Ellie?    Morning, sweetheart. We better get moving. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. All right, everybody up! Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin! Find the bird, find the bird! Hi, hi. Point! Look. There he is!  Point! Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof! Yeah, get off of his...    What is it doing? The bird is calling to her babies. Her babies. Kevin's a girl?  Her house is over there in those twisty rocks. She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them.  Wait. Kevin's just leaving?  But you promised to protect her. Her babies need her. We gotta make sure they're together! Sorry, Russell. We've lost enough time already. Yeah.   This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you. Huh? Kevin?       Where's the bird? You said you had the bird. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that. Where is it? Uh... Tomorrow. Come back tomorrow, and then I will again have the bird. Yes.  You lost it! Why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have led us to the small mailman and the one who smells of prunes.  Master will be most pleased we have found them and will ask of them many questions. Come! Wait. We're not going with you! We're going to the falls!   Get away from me!  Get down!    Stay! You came here in that? Uh, yeah. In a house? A floating house?   That is the darnedest thing I've ever seen. You're not after my bird, are you? But if you needed to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige.  Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. Wait. Are you Charles Muntz? Yeah, well, yes. THE Charles Muntz? ""Adventure is out there!"" It's really him! That's Charles Muntz! It is? Who's Charles Muntz? Him! Yes! Yes! That's him! I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans. Oh, well. You're a man of good taste.  Now, you must be tired. Hungry? Uhhuh. Now, attention, everyone! These people are no longer intruders! They are our guests.  Follow me. I like you temporarily. You do smell like prunes. Whoa! I will not bite you. The small mailman smells like chocolate. I'm sorry about the dogs. Hope they weren't too rough on you. We weren't. Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine. We're not actually going inside the Spirit of Adventure itself? Oh... Would you like to? Would I?  Wait up, Mr. Muntz. Jiminy Cricket. Not you. What do we do with Dug? He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of Shame.  I do not like the Cone of Shame. Well, most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums, New York, Munich, London. Of course, I kept the best for myself. Did you ever! Will you look at that? Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him down. Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me. Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as dental equipment. Oh, my gosh! The giant Somalian leopard tortoise! Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed. That's an interesting story there. Excellent choice. I found it on safari with Roosevelt. He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings, and did he cheat! Oh, he was horrible. Master, dinner is ready. Oh, dear. Broken translator. It's that loose wire again. There you go, big fella.  Thank you, Master. I liked his other voice.  Well, dinner is served. Right this way. So, how are things stateside, huh? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here. Please. I hope you're hungry, because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had.  Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again! Yes! Hey! Hey! Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls. I'm honored. And now you've made it. You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose. No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests, a real treat. Treat! Where's the treat! Treat!  No, no. Quiet! Calm down, calm down. I want a treat! I want a treat! Hey! I shouldn't have used that word. Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves come to steal what's rightfully mine. No! They called me a fraud, those...  But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings. I've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives. You can't go in after it. Once in, there's no way out. I've lost so many dogs. And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take. But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place. Hey, that looks like Kevin. Kevin? Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us. Follow you? It's impossible. How? She likes chocolate. Chocolate? Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes gaga for it. But it ran off. It's gone now. You know, Carl, these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. A surveyor making a map. A botanist cataloguing plants. An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls. I mean, that's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends.  Well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we better be going. Oh, you're not leaving. We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on, Russell. But we haven't even had dessert yet. The boy's right. You haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee. Oh, you really must stay. I insist. We have so much more to talk about.  Kevin?  It's here. Get them!  Hurry! I am hurrying! Ahhh! They're coming! Master, over here.  Go toward the light, Master!   Russell!  Get back! Go on, Master! I will stop the dogs! Stop, you dogs.  Whoa!   Help! Help! Help! Caw, caw! Raar! Caw, caw! Raar! Give me your hand! Hang on to Kevin!       Kevin.    Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down. She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?  All right, but we gotta hurry.   You lost them? No, it was Dug. Yeah. He's with them. He helped them escape!  Wait. Wait a minute. Dug.   See anything? No. My pack is not following us. Boy, they are dumb. This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero, and he's trying to kill us. What a joke! Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says, ""I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead."" Hal! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead.  Careful, Russell. You okay, Kevin?  You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected. Yeah? How so? It's kind of wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book. Get used to that, kid. My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweat Lodge meetings. And afterwards, we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickie. Then we sit on this one curb right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most wins. I like that curb. That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.   Look! There it is! Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.  Look at that bird go. Wait up, you overgrown chicken.  That's it. Go, Kevin! Go find your babies! Run, Kevin! Run! Oh, no! Russell, give me your knife! Get away from my bird!   No!  No!  Careful. We'll want her in good shape for my return. Let her go! Stop! Kevin!   You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away. This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this! Master, it's alright. I am not your master! And if you hadn't have shown up, none of this would've happened! Bad dog! Bad dog!  Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me.   Here. I don't want this anymore.   Russell? Russell! I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't!  No, Russell! No!     Huh? Russell? Dug! I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay? Can you stay? Well, you're my dog, aren't you? And I'm your master. You're my master? Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Good boy, Dug! You're a good boy!  Yes! Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...  And they wouldn't believe me. Just wait till they get a look at you. Master? The small mailman has returned. What? Let me go. Where's your elderly friend? He's not my friend anymore. Well, if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind. Where are you keeping Kevin? Let me go! Scream all you want, small mailman. None of your mailman friends can hear you. I'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training! Alpha, Fredricksen's coming back. Guard that bird. If you see the old man, you know what to do. Hey, where are you going? I'm not finished with you! Nice talking with you. Ahhh! Where are you, Fredricksen?  Russell! Mr. Fredricksen! Dug, bring her over! You came back for Kevin! Let's go get her! I'm getting Kevin. You stay here. But I wanna help. I don't want your help. I want you safe.   How do we get past these dogs? Point! Kevin.  Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way. Allow no one to be entering through these doors. Guard well that bird, my minions. What do we do now, Dug?  Who wants the ball?  Me! I want it! Me! I do! I want the ball! Give it to me! Then go get it! I'm gonna get there first! Getting the ball! I got it! Uhoh.  I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's get you out of here. Master! He's gone! The old man! He's here! He's got the bird! The bird's gone... Calm down! One at a time! L...want...to...help! Haha!   He's in Hall D! He's in Hall C! It's the old man! Does anyone know where they are?   Gray Leader? Take down the house.  Gray Leader, checking in. Gray Two, checking in. Gray Three, checking in. Target sighted.  Come on, Kevin.  Auuggghh!   Hi.     Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on! Spit it out! Come on. Enough! I am taking that bird back with me. Alive or dead! Come on, Kevin.    I will have many enjoyments from what I am about to do, Dug.  He wears the Cone of Shame! What? Do not just continue sitting. Attack!  No, no! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me! Listen, you dog. Sit! Yes, Alpha. Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is... Oh!  I can't do it. Russell! Huh? Caw, caw! Raar! Caw, caw! Raar! You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone! Hey, squirrel! Squirrel? Where? Where? Where? Where's the squirrel? I hate squirrels.   Dug! Master! Russell! Over here! Let's go!  Mr. Fredricksen! Go on, Kevin!  No! Russell! Get out of there!  No! Leave them alone! Russell, hang on to Kevin! Don't let go of her! Kevin! Chocolate!    That was cool!  Don't jerk around so much, kid! Easy, Russell. Oh, I am ready to not be up high. Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen. You know, it's just a house.   Look at you. You're so soft.  Aw! I wish I could keep one.  Where's my cane? I just had it here.   You know what? Keep them. A little gift from me to you. Bye, Kevin!

Valiant,Disney,2000,2005,Animation,"I think I saw something! Steady lads! We're almost home.  Just a few flaps more and we'll  be over the white cliffs of Dover! Falcon! 5 o'clock and coming in hot! Then lift it 30! Stay with me, private! Private! Wing commander Gutsy. This just in from a sea gull near Dover! None of them made it back alive. None of them? But those were some of our top fliers. I'm sorry, sir. I'm just a messenger pigeon. If we don't find some more birds fast, our goose is going to be cooked. VALIANT BIRDS ON THE MARCH Across the nation and the globe pigeons are taking wing in the fight for freedom. Delivering top secret messages from behind enemy lines, these fine feathered aviators are the pride of the allied forces. It's the Royal Homing Pigeon Service that leads the way. Whether cutting through enemy lines or just cutting wise. These proud pigeons are the model of birdhood. But don't count out the doves. War bond birds play a vital role in raising seeds for the troops. Wait a minute! Ahoy mates! Nursing doves at two o'clock. Now that's what I call a task force. Laundry bird bath. Why not? These hearty heroes need to look their best. Of course not just any pigeon can make the cut. But there's always room for  a few brave recruits. And there they go. Off to another exciting mission. Homing pigeons, we salute you! This is the shot boys, watch this. Two in the corner, eight... Valiant, do you mind? Oh sorry. Felix! Felix, I could do it! I could do that, Felix! Do what, lad? I could be one of those brave recruits. Taking wing in the fight for freedom, I know I could! I know it! Valiant! What, did I ever tell you? When I was your age, I was already on the shores of France. Aquatic brigade. Gull division. If it weren't for me wooden drumstick and that shrap of a limb poopdeck, I'd be out there right now. Maybe you're right. I'm just what they're looking for, a pigeon with that something extra. You know it's not a bloke's wing span that counts, it's the size of his spirit! Hey everybody! Look outside! Look at that move! Royal Homing Pigeon Service! Magnificent! Commander Gutsy! The most decorated pigeon ever! Thank you very much! Yes! Much obliged.  Come and have a drink with me now! What would it be, boys? Bug juice, shaken, not stirred. The RHPS always drinks on the House! Bug juice. Shaken. Not stirred. Merci beaucoup ma chérie. He spoke French! So, what's the news from the front? Can't say of course. Classified. But danger is our business. And I'm sorry to say, business is all too good. Let me through! Got to get to wing commander now! Excuse me, Wing Commander! Yes? Sir, where do I sign up? Aren't you a bit on the wee side? Talking about a small wingspan pipsqueak. There's always a place for a few valiant birds. Sign up is tomorrow in London. Love to stay and chat, but duty calls and we must answer. Beaks up, boys! Let's make wing. Hip hip hurray! Herr General! Welcome back, General Von Talon. Congratulations, sir. Another triumph! Ya woll mein General! Under the Geneva Convention as an officer I have the right to be treated as a pigeon of war. Have no fear, you vill be. Take him to the cage! Get your talons off me! Filthy vultures! Pigeons, pathetic little creatures. You don't eat your prisoners at war, do you? Eat you! I'm a vegetarian. And yet you wear a leather cape? Who is your contact in the resistance? You know they'll send a crack team to rescue me? Rescue you? You're a pigeon! How important do you think you are? VIP. Very Important Pigeon! Very Impudent Pigeon! Who is your contact in the Resistance? Oh no. Speak! This canary will never sing. Listen to your mother, you can't go! Mum, there's a war going on and I want to do my bit! Buy why! Why! Why! Oh, mum! Good bye. Those falcons are going to tear you apart! oh Mum! My dear little baby! Mother, that's not helping! Mother, honestly, I'm going to be fine! You were such a cute little egg! Mum, I'm not an egg anymore! It's time I left the nest. No one thinks I can do this. Maybe my only chance to show them and myself that they're wrong! Well, at least have some breakfast before you go. Oh Mum, Mum! Aargh! No. Thanks! Valiant! Right then. I love you. Good bye! He'll always be little to me. Ahoy there Valiant! I'm off now Felix! Wish me luck! Good luck! Good bye! That boy is gonna get creamed. LONDON 57 Valiant pigeon! Fearless flier! Pride of the Allied forces. Feared by the enemy. Loved by the ladies. Humble. Spits danger smack in the eye! Look at that! It's London! Alright. Listen up. This is easy. I mean for  intelligent guys like you, I can tell ya, All you gotta do keep your eyes on  the pebble. You can't go wrong. She is shy. Give her a chance and  she will give you the slip. Find her and the crumbs is yours! Easy as pie. I don't know how I stay in business. There it is.  Not under that one. Where is it now? Find her and the crumbs is yours! Which one is it under? That one! That one? Oh, no! Bad luck again! Give it one more go? Law of averages. I think you're gonna win this time. Serious thing, which one has the pebble? Wow! In all the excitement I forgot myself. Why don't you gents say to a game of... You big cheat! Give me my crumbs back! On the level gents. Listen, I know what you're thinking... Come and get me, falcons! Strike me down if I tell you lie. Look at him. That was lucky. Prayers were answered.  That's never worked before but... Hello, mate!  I lost control, but then...you could not have  picked a better time to have dropped in. Bugsy's the name. I'm terribly sorry, I'm Valiant. So what brings you to my manor? Well, I've come to be an aviator. With the Royal Homing Pigeon Service. Fighting for king and country! You don't say. Well, I've never been much of a hope and glory bird myself. I'm rather partial to a little something called freedom. Yeah, oh yeah, I flit about as I please. No one telling me what to do, or when to do it. Are those flies? Oh, they're friends of mine. So, RHPS recruit in the head. Good idea! Right this way mate. I'm feeling rather patriotic myself all of a sudden. There he is! Come on, after him. Let's keep going, come on. He's here somewhere. I can smell him. Follow my lead, mate. Hello. Two to enlist please. Valiant pigeon. Reporting for duty, sir. Never heard of you. Valiant pigeon. The Valiant pigeon. You don't have Valiant on your list? No! Clerical error. Should I have? Yes, I think you should have. Look at him! He's a perfect specimen. Do something. He's as fast as lightning, strong as knocks. Very tall for his height. Stand up. Sit back down again. The bird's a legend in the Starling Hump???shire area. Too small! Ye should be yea high and you're not even ""hey"" high. Charming, that's charming that is. And you! Have ye by any chance heard of a birdbath? Sad truth is, I've got me a rare feather condition. Can't go near a bath. Or look at a bath. It makes me itch. Clear off the territory. Get lost! But, Wing Commander Gutsy...He.... Yes. Wing Commander Gutsy. That's right. Valiant's best mate. They went to school together. You don't wanna get on the wrong side with him, if he hears about this you're gonna lose those stripes, mate. You know Wing Commander Gutsy, you say? Well... Oh, yeah. Well, that makes a difference. Sign here. Thank you. Thank you, sir. There he is! You dirty clowns! When I get hold of you, I'm gonna knock your beak off! Hey! That's it! Enough. Get your wings of me! Where do I sign up? Just sign here. All right gents, in you go. Thank you, sir. Who is this Gutsy geaser anyway? If I see your ugly face around here, I'm gonna have you! We made it! Safe and sound. We're in the Royal Homing Pigeon Service! The elite of the elite! Fighting the heroic battle to save... To save...  To save our tail feathers,which worked like a charm.  Even though I say so myself. So with that I'll be hittin' the skyway. Cheers mate, good luck. God bless. If you make it back in one piece, be sure to... ...look me up... Hello? Hello? Gents, hello! Hello! No! There's been a terrible mistake! Trust me, this is all gonna work out brilliantly. Hey! Come on! Come back! I've been shainghaied. That's a bit bright. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to hurt ya little fella. Hey, little fella! It's not the size of your wing span, no! It's the size of your spirit! If you say so, mate. Can't argue with that. I'm Tailfeather, this is Toughwood, my brother. Not the sharpest beak on the block. What? But... If you're ever in the scrum, there's no better bird to have on your team. Absolutely. Nice to meet you. I'm Valiant. Valiant? It's good to meet you. Let's go! It's two for Tailfeather. Six to none. For quite an elite unit, on quote they seem to be letting almost anything in with wings. Including those flies, circling your bottom. Koi! Who do you think you are? I'm Lofty Thadious Worthington Pigeon. I come from a long and honourable line of warrior pigeons. Hello lads! I trust you've had a pleasant journey. Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say the ride was a bit bumpy on the way in. Maybe, check the suspension on that motorbike. And actually we are a wee bit thirsty, if we could  have some cold drinks, that would be nice. Oh, oh good, that can certainly be arranged. Right up! When did I sprout beak feathers and turn into a flamingo!?! Now fall in! Feather brains.Fall in! For the next six weeks your tails belong to me. You'll learn to march like birds, fly like birds and fight like birds. I will make birds of you turkeys  even if it kills you! Except you. You won't last a week. Permission to die trying, sir! It's like this, ladies. You will shape up and you will shape up fast or I will personally drum you out of the corps! Funny, you should...I would love to get drummed out. I was gonna bring it up if you hadn't. Hey, leave him alone! He helped me to... Pipe down, pipsqueak! I'm more interested in having you all drop and give me 50 courtesy of your short little friend here. Training at last. I say ol'Bean. Wouldn't it be more sporting if the chap who actually committed the infraction... Gentlemen, welcome to the Royal Homing Pigeon Service. For the last time, what was your mission? And where are these messages coming from? Very well. Have it your way. Do you want us to pluck out his feathers? And to clip his wings? Let his feelings? No, worse. Much worse. We have ways of making you squawk. What kind of birds are you? What is this yoddling music! One two, one two and halt! Now fall out and report to the nursing doves. Hello nurse. Look at her! Well, I've been waiting for you. Do you have a little something for a brave pigeon about to go into battle? Hey, darling? It just so happens I do have something for you. Did you hear that? Is this what you had in mind? Wow. It's awfully big. You're kind of short for a nursing dove. Look who's talking, I'd say you're kind of short for a carrier pigeon. I'm Valiant by the way. All right then Valiant. I'm Victoria. I know you lads have had a tiring day, and what you need is a nice relaxing shower. Then I'll treat ya to a fancy dinner. We'll get your little feather cut. Set you up with some uniforms. Oh, beg your pardon. Did that hurt?! Did that?! That's it! Come here! And we'll all turn in for a good night's sleep. So this is where the smelly rotten bits of disgusting refuse sit out. And our sleeping quarters would be where? I'll never sleep in here. Well, this isn't so bad. Oh, just like home. I've had enough! Speak! Lieutenant Mercury, Royal Homing Pigeon Service, 4121444697. Bring me the truth serum. Come on, come on. One shot of this and we will know everything. I'll never talk! Never! Never! Wakey wakey! You bird brains are Squad F. You know what that means? Squad Fantastic! I've got it! Squad Formidable! Philosophical! No, it means you are the fliers of the future. The far future! But my job, somehow, is to make you the carrier pigeons of today. Good maneuver. It might help if you kept your eyes open. Better get you back to your nursing dove. Thanks, Bugsy. You must really like it here, because this is the third time this week you've been in to see me. I wish you'd be more careful. Oh, don't you worry. Where I come from, danger is our business. Oh yeah, we spit danger in the eye. If the condition, I can take it. And where do you come from? West Nestington. That's near Nestington, it's close to the west of it actually. Oh, Valiant! Well I have to return to my duties, so... Good bye. Oh, Valiant wait! As homing pigeons it's our duty to transport messages. In the worst of conditions wind, hail, sleet, snow, bombs exploding, bullets flying and as if that weren't enough, mother nature has the audacity to create a little something called The Falcon. Twenty pounds of pigeon eating muscle, measuring five of your wing spans. They like to blind side their prey, at speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour. But not to bite. Not yet. The first strike is merely for impact. They'll let you drop of it. Making sure you're defenseless, and scoop you up in their razor sharp talons. And in the dark of the night you'll have not but a split second to recognize friend from foe. Friend or foe? Foe! No! You idiots, it's a pigeon! Friend or foe? Foe! No! Friend! No, it's a foe. Yes, yes! Friend or foe? Friend! Friend! To survive his mission a pigeon must have the strength to carry his message capsule. You must have the speed to fly like the wind. He must have the agility to outmaneuver the enemy. And he must have the endurance to battle the elements, flying long distances over raging seas. Me again. Valiant. Oh, my favourite! How did you know? The parrot says to me ""How about we do a loop o loop?"" I says I can't loop a loop. He says, ""Why ever not?"" I say, ""Well, I'm afraid of heights!"" He says, ""You afraid of heights? That's ridiculous!"" Maybe to you mate. But not to me. That's it! Come on! Afternoon Monty! Hello Guts. What news? Not good I'm afraid. We just lost Squadron E over Belgium. That means these new recruits are our only chance. They'll have to leave tomorrow. You can't be serious. They haven't even finished their training. Sorry, but those are the orders. Have them ready at 18:00 tomorrow Monty ol'boy. Cheers. Commandor Gutsy is here, so I suppose you'll be shipping out soon. I know! I know! I can't wait! This is the moment I've been waiting for! Well, I'd like to be part of what you come home to. I don't care if you're a hero. Just concentrate on the getting back. You need to understand something, lads. Our losses have been heavy. We got to stop it. You're all we've got! And so today we fight for our country. Tomorrow our feathers may be plucked from our  lifeless bodies, our innards spread like jam on toast, And our bones fed to rabid weasels. But never mind that. On this day, in this place, let it forever be known that you, pigeons did your part in the heroic battle for...? Seeds! Freedom! Right! You will be Commander Gutsy's support wing. I'll expect you to do whatever it takes to ensure the success of his mission. Chaps, the message we have been sent to carry is of the utmost importance. The outcome of the war could well depend on it. We pigeons have never been entrusted with a more critical or dangerous mission. May you fly straight! And may your instinct guide you home. What did Gutsy mean by 'highly dangerous'? I don't know. But I can tell you this. I am a bird of principle. And my number one principle is don't get involved with anything called 'highly dangerous'! And I will never violate my core beliefs. Do not ask me to violate my core beliefs. You're talking to the wrong pigeon. Sir, point of clarification please. Regarding that highly dangerous mission. I got a doctor's note. Zip it Stinky. Sure, I understand. I truly regret that I have  but one life to give for my country. I'd love to die. Can't. Not Sunday. Bad for me. Are you finished? Not quite, listen, maybe I'm not that conscientious, but I do object. Get back to the barracks! Now! Do I still have to go on the dangerous mission? Now! Yep. I'll take that as yes, I do. Now! Hey, hey. Where are you going? Keep it down, mate. Got some serious flying ahead. Flying, what do you mean flying? Flying to where? Back to old Trafalgar square, son. You're not leaving, you'll break up the team. Team? I'm not a team player. Old bug Buster plays solo. Maybe the question isn't why I'm leaving, but why you're staying? Why am I staying? Because it's my duty, it's our duty! Hold on! Sorry! Have I missed something? Did we start this? No. Did we make those? Or those? I've seen them before, mate. And it's not a pretty sight. The truth is, I'm scared. Alright? Don't tell them that. Cause I'll deny it. Well, I'm scared too. Then come with me. Trafalgar Square will be ours. Come on! But we didn't make Trafalgar Square either.  Where do we go when they start dropping bombs there? No, I'm staying. I'm doing my bit. Yeah. They're lucky to have you, mate. Anyway, keep your wings dry, yeah? What's happenin'? What's going on? It's time for me to fly the coop, all right? So, I guess this is farewell. Wait, where are you goin'? You can't just leave, Bugsy. Look, I've got urgent business to take care of. I better catch the wind while it's blowing. Look me up when you get back, yeah?! You know where I'll be! Gentlemen, take your places! Our mission is to be dropped behind enemy lines in occupied France. To make contact with the French resistance. To get a vital top secret message and bring it back here by sun down tomorrow. Good luck. The fate of the freedom loving world depends on us. Wait! Hey, Bugsy! You can't go without me! I can't let you get all the glory! Good luck, lads. Hey, Bugsy! Thanks for coming back! I'll tell you the truth, it's the first worth while thing I've ever done. We're gonna be fine. Right, Lofty? Indubitably! Birds of a feather and all that. What? Right Lofty ol'mate. We stick together. Hey Tailfeather, can you believe that we're the ones they pick to send on the most important mission in World War II? Yeah! Me too! Truthfully, I'm not a good singer anyway. Always off key. Enough already! You've been chattering for days! Hey, who gave me the serum? You want me to talk, okay I'm talking. Truth be told, I'm glad you did this. Homing Pigeon racket is all well and good, but it's a stiff upper beak  rubbish all the time. I got feelings and I wanna express them. I always used to think my favourite color was blue,  cause it's for boys. Now I realise. . . Shut up! Shut up! I demand better treatment I mean the mice don't treat me like this! You know those charming litle Resistance chappies with their fabulous view over the harbour the last time I was in the attic in St. Pierre... St. Pierre? O the truth serum is genious. Cover his cage! I'm curious what is your favourite color? Pink! Not like a hot pink, or a pastely pink, just a kind of, well of, a pink pink. You know what I mean,  none of the rinky dink pinks.  Excuse me. I like pink too. Come on! Cheer up, Valiant! Stiff upper beak. Gentlemen, get ready to drop! Are you ready to drop? I think I've dropped already! It's okay to be scared, fellows! I'd be worried if you weren't. It won't get better, but you'll get used to it! Go! Go! Go! It's jammed! Sir, let me help you! No! Go now! That's an order! Yes, sir. Come on Gutsy, get out off there! Oh, come on. Hello? Hello? A little help chaps? Hold on there, we'll get you out of there now. Cheers! A bit of a tenuous landing that. But I dare say it could've been worse. Look out!  O my! Sorry Lofty. Not to worry, old chap. I say, a bit of a muddle, this. But at least we're all in one piece. Not quite all. Where's Gutsy? He was still in the plane. What do you mean he was still in the plane? His cage got stuck. I don't think he got out. Ah, well that's it! We're dead! We're finished! It's been a good run. Nice knowing you. You're quite mistaking, ol'boy. I'm sure he made it out. Gutsy always makes it out, he's going to come and find us any minute now. And give us the plans for the mission. Then who has the backup plan? You want the backup plan? We die. That's the backup plan. But I'm not ready to die! Am I ready? No one's asked me! So many books to read! Regrets! That's it. We're dead.  Thank you very much. Everyone be quiet. Quiet! We need a plan. And the plan is, is to find a safe location to plan the next move. You heard the bird. So our plan is to make a plan? Come on. France is spooky.  Quiet! Did you hear that? There's someone in there! Somebody better go and have a look. All right, I'll go. All right you turkies, let's go. Valiant, just pull yourself together. There's nothing in here. Unless you're counting guns, bombs, all the falcons, the pigeoneating falcons. Pigeoneating falcons! Tailfeather, let's take you out of the grail. Vive la France! Pardonnezmoi, my pigeon friends. You are the RHPS, non? Yes sir. French Résistance, Mars Division. Well, I'm glad to see ya. I'll tell you. How did you not find us? Well, there was the plane and the explosion. And this gleaming and bleeding. More screamings and beggins and cryings, whinings, winging, yelling, boohooing. Enough about that. Absolutely. Definitely, yep. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Charles De Girl. De Girl? Why did they call you De Girl? Because I am a girl. The one and only girl. I like France. Do you speak French? Well, mais oui... Does 'o là là' mean anything to you? Or 'va va voom! Oh yeah! Does bonjour..? All right! We don't have time for this! You have a message, we have a mission. Let's get on with it! Not so fast, monsieur! This is Rallo. He's an expert in sa... Sabotage! Sabotage! Pardon. Now monsieur, before you continue on your mission, it's our national custom to... Break the bread? And cut the cheese. Thank you for your hospitality, but we just don't have time to eat. And anyway we're birds. We don't eat cheese. We don't? Look, about that message. We will take you to it. But the road is dangerous. And guarded by the enemy falcon. But this cannot be a problem for such highly trained pigeons. That is why you are squad A, oui? The things is you see... Squad B? Not squad B. Squad C? So then you are squad D? Just between us, squad D was never really what it was all cracked up to be. I will not lie to you, you will definately be eaten the falcons. Wow, that was some fine fromage. Can you burp on cue? I can burp on all the letters. Not just Q. Watch this. A. B. C. Shhh! Be silent! The falcons! I say! Excuse me. Come on. Falcons! All clear! Stop that! Oh, Squad F. We are here. This is invigorating. The attic! There it is! Fly, English pigeons! Fly! Oh, dear. Sorry. Dirty bird! Lofty pigeon at your service. Hold on, mademoiselle. He's heavy, this one! There they are Faster! Sabotage! To the right! Over there! I'm gonna get you! Hold on, De Girl! This is it! I must do the secret knock. Who is it? De Girl. We must do the secret password. Jacques, there is no time! 'Ba, ba black sheep. Have you any?' Wine? No, no, that is yesterday's password. Trees? No. Seeds? No, no. Petunias? Falcons! Jacques, move it! Let me give you le message. You can give me le massage. Can you make sure it's a full body massage. Message! The message that is to go to London. Our freedom depends on it. And who will carry them? Wait. I'll take it. Bugsy? Extraordinary! And you said you weren't a team player. Well we'll see now won't we?. Good luck, Bugsy. May you fly straight. And let our instincts guide us home. Good bye. And good luck, pigeons! Okay, farewell. Absolutely charmed. Just one tiny thing. How are we gonna get out of here! We're trapped! I've got an idea! I've got an idea! Where are they? Let's go! Hey, it worked like a charm! They'll be teaching that one at the academy! I just hope the others are okay. You can't count on it! Evasive action! Let's go. Get your claws off him! I say let go! I'm the one you want! You can't do better than that, you English pigeon! Bugsy! Bugsy! Dinner time! Bugsy! It was not easy, Herr General.  But I have... captured their leader! The leader? No, perhaps, assisstant leader. But more importantly, Herr General. Get on with it! May I present you with... the message! Tata. The high commander will be pleased! There will be medals, photographs, commemorative stamps! I will personally deliver it to him. They must be desperate indeed to give the message to this putrid smelling reject. Oh no, Dennis! You've squooshed! He was my favourite. I am putrid stinky rotten. Eat me, you'll be sick for a week. Take him away! No! I've got a doctor's note.  I've got a feather condition! Wait. On second thoughts he may prove useful. Yes! Oh, yes! Oh, thank you. You're very wise. What would you like? Cards? We can play cards. Find the pebble? I've got a lovely voice. That probably annoys ya... I was thinking more along the lines of a celebration dinner. Celebration dinner! Brilliant idea! I cook well! Not I cook well! I won't be in it. I can make the dinner. Bread crumbs! You'll love... Oh, you haven't tried my bread crumb birdseedy thing. No, pigeon under glass. It was a lovely liebfrau milch reduction. What did you do to him? You're all right, mate? Wait a minute now! It's a fengshui.  That little bell should be over there! Who was I kidding? I don't belong here. I've let everyone down. Bugsy wouldn't  even be here if it weren't for me. Chaps! There's Valiant! Look! Follow me! Hey! Lofty! Toughwood! Chaps! Gutsy! You're alive! What happened? Tell us what happened! Plane exploded. Chute gave out. Free fall at 3000 feet. Set upon  by a pack of wolves. Flew through barbed wire, picked up some shrapnel from a stray grenade. Fought my way to the rendezvous  when here we are. Right! We can dispense with the chit chat. I'm guessing the falcons have acquired the message. Yes, sir. Where's Bugsy? He sacrificed himself to save me. The falcons got Bugsy and the message. Which way did they go? That way. Oh, no! Britania rules the waves! Come on, pull yourself together. Snap out of it! Comeon Bugsy ol'boy, let's find us a way out of here. Where there's a will, there's a way. Right. You chaps sit tight. I'll fly in avoiding the various, clever booby traps and deadly ambushes. Then subdue any resistance. And secure the message. Absolutely. Gutsy by name. Gutsy by nature. I will bathe. Bring me my best cape. Yes, Herr General. Join the army you said. You did, it was your idea. I'll have none of this! I'm not listening! I'm afraid it's not as simple as I thought. This is a highly fortified bunker stuffed to the gills with enemy falcons. There's only one opening, scarcely big enough for a hummingbird. It's down the barrel of that gun. Gentlemen, I'm afraid it's hopeless. I'll do it! Bugsy? I'm too young to die! I can't believe it! Hey! Hey? Valiant? Bugsy. Hey! The message! It's in there. Oh, no! Red says strong and decisive! Red it is! Yes, General! No wait, the blue was the actual trim. As many capes as you like,General. They're coming! Valiant, get down! How many capes does someone need?! I'm sick of capes! I hate capes! Here it goes. Now, I'll get you out of here Bugs. It's of no use, he took the key with him. Complete the mission! But Bugsy! I can't! Forget about me!

As always, the weather is a balmy 72 degrees and sunny and...  Oh, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary  of our fiveyear cruise.  Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later  we'd be doing the exact same thing they were doing.  Fore! So, be sure next mealtime to ask for your ""free "" septuacentennial cupcake in a cup."" Wow, look at that! Also today we have a... Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button? Captain, Probe One has returned positive. Positive? EVE. But no probe's ever come back positive before. Buy N Large  Greetings and congratulations, Captain.  If you are seeing this,  that means your Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,  or EVE probe, has returned from Earth  with a confirmed specimen of ongoing photosynthesis.  That's right. It means it's time to go back home.  Home? We're going back? Now that Earth has been restored to a lifesustaining status,  by golly, we can begin Operation Recolonize.  Simply follow this manual's instructions  to place the plant in your ship's holodetector  and the Axiom will immediately navigate your return to Earth.  It's that easy. Huh!  Now, due to the effects of microgravity,  you and your passengers may have suffered some  slight bone loss.  But I'm sure a few laps around the ship's jogging track  will get you back in shape in no time.  We have a jogging track? If you have any further questions,  just consult your operation manual.  See you back home real soon.  ""Operate Manuel."" Uh... Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel? Wow. Will you look at that? Let's see. Huh? EVE. WALLE! EVE. Well, let's open her up. ""Step one.

Probe's memory is faulty. So then, we're not going to Earth? Negative. I guess things go back to normal, huh? Correct, Captain. Well, false alarm! False alarm.  The probe must be defective. GO4, send her to the repair ward, and have them run diagnostics on her. Make sure she's not... Ah! WALLE. Have, uh, WALLE cleaned. Yoohoo! EVE. Analyze. Analysis. Foreign contaminant.

Aye, aye, sir.  WALLE. WALLE. Auto, EVE found the plant. Fire up the holodetector.  Not necessary, Captain. You may give it to me. You know what? I should do it myself. Captain. Sir, I insist you give me the plant. Auto, get out of my way. We cannot go home. What are you talking about? Why not? That is classified, Captain. Give me the plant. What do you mean, ""classified""? You don't keep a secret from the captain. Give me the plant. Tell me what's classified. The plant. Tell me, Auto! That's an order. Aye, aye, sir. Buy N Large is your superstore We got all you need  Just cut it off, will you?  Hey, there, autopilots. Got some bad news.  Um...  Operation Cleanup has,  well, failed.  Wouldn't you know, rising toxicity levels have made life  unsustainable on Earth.  ""Unsustainable""? What? Darn it all, we're going to have to cancel Operation Recolonize.  So,  just stay the course.  Um...  Rather than try and fix this problem,  it'll just be easier for everyone to remain in space.  ""Easier""? Huh? Sir, time to go.  Okay. I'm giving Override Directive A 113.  Go to full autopilot.  Take control of everything, and do not return to Earth.  Repeat, do not return to Earth.  Let's get the heck out of here.  Now, the plant. No. Wait a minute. Computer, when was that message sent out to the Axiom?  Message received in the year 2110.  That's... That's nearly 700 years ago! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back. Sir, orders are ""do not return to Earth."" But life is sustainable now. Look at this plant. Green and growing. It's living proof he was wrong. Irrelevant, Captain. What? It's completely relevant! Out there is our home. Home, Auto. And it's in trouble. I can't just sit here and do nothing. That's all I've ever done. That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done. Nothing!

Now, hurry.  Auto's probably going to cut me off... Halt.  Ah! Halt. Oh, my. Clear. Oh! Halt, halt. Look what I got, Auto. Not possible.  That's right. The plant. You want it? Come and get it, blinky.  No. Captain? Captain? Let go. Let go. Too heavy for you? Huh? Get off. You're not getting away from me, oneeye. Get off. Is that all you got? Halt. That's it.

Tell me a story about a warrior No, no... It's late, go to sleep There must be someone... someone like me... brave, heroic... Well, there was someone... just like you... Who was he? Arjun his name was Arjun Was he a soldier? Or a warrior? A warrior? Well he thought he was one What does that mean? Who was he? He was the son of Lord Indra And he never interrupted the telling of a story Okay, no more questions But I want the whole story Don't leave anything out The fights, the treks, the battles... There was a vast kingdom in Northern India Hastinapur Ruled by the great King Pandu One day, he gave up his throne to his younger brother Dhritarashtra and went to the live in the forest as a hermit There he was blessed with five children and they lived happily together But one day... Pandu passed away... and his family had to return to Hastinapur... Acharya Drona... Peace be with you And with you Vidur Cattle herders? You here to herd cattle? Herd cattle? More like live with the cattle! Just look at size of that bull! Watch what you say, moron! We're not herders we're princes! These are your cousins, Duryodhan. They're here to live with you If 100 Kauravas weren't enough to handle, here's five more! Ashwatthama... fetch bows for the new boys Yudhishtir, what do you see? I see ten mango trees, three peepal trees and one cluster fig There's a bird perched on the third branch from the top... That's enough! Bheem... I see only a bird... Really? Yes ...sitting there smelling fruit... ...while I'm dying of hunger! Move aside... Nakul? Sahdev! Whoever you are. What do you see? Everything. Me too. Move aside, both of you! Arjun? I see an eye and... Nothing else Don't you see what your brothers see? The bird, trees, branches, fruit... Are you blind boy? All I see is an eye Well then... shoot! Years passed and the Kauravas and Pandavas grew up As did their differences The Kuru dynasty was splitting in two at stake was the throne of Hastinapur Hey, where did you get your donkey? You're not ready to play with the big boys, kid! As ready as you are big guy! What's this? A bull riding a horse? This bull's going to gore you Duryodhan! Hey Bheem, see you later! I told you I'd win! You call this winning brother Yudhishtir? I slowed down... Oh come on! Guruji, what do you have to say? Oh let it go... hey! Bheem's horses? Duryodhan, where's Bheem? How... how would I know? I was ahead of him What? Go, look for him Bheem, what happened? I have no idea... All rise for King Dhritharashtra Long live King Dhritharashtra! Long live the King!! So many hurdles on the way to the throne... Uncle Shakuni! Tell me something nephew... Was Bheem plain lucky or did you not try hard enough? You dare doubt me? Drona is the one with the doubts I'm convinced. Tell me something... do you think my father will make me king? Of course! But if the council nominates Yudhishtir... he won't be able to stand up to them. I understand... ...come with me. Where are we going? We haven't brought any food or drink... We haven't crossed the border yet... It's almost sundown, let's head back Relax uncle, meet some friends of mine... Susharman! Susharman! Hey look, what a plump catch! Get him! Nephew! Susharman, this is Shakuni, my uncle. Great! We'll rob your uncle! All of Hastinapur dances to his tune. There are no kings here uncle... ...only us, the Trigarthas ...and we bow to no one! And you never will, Susharman If you feed my uncle a meal under the stars Uncle, how would you like your meat? Rare? Well done? Or on the hoof? Well done. You have strange friends nephew. They won't bow to me but... they'll behead anyone I ask them to. Careful... they might turn into more than you can handle... don't let them become a reason to worry. If you want to break the Pandavas... ...get rid of Arjun first Arjun? The wisdom of Yudhishtir, the strength of Bheem... ...he has both... He will be the greatest of them all. Duryodhan was looking for an opportunity to strike again... He found it at a tournament Drona had organised for his students. Arjun! Who are you? Why are you here? They call me Karna I am an archer This is a tournament for Dronacharya's students Did he not teach you that... ...weapons were for warfare... ...not for fun and games Come... Fight me ...and show everyone... what you've learned. Hey! Who are you? And why are you frightening my brother? He's just a little boy... ...aren't you Arjun? You're not ready for all of this... Watch your mouth! ...and pick on someone your own size! Hold it, Bheem... Karna... step forward Drop your weapon Arjun! Arjun, I order you to lower your weapon! Karna don't you know that... ...true battles are fought between equals, you're picking on a child! I'm not a child! I'm a trained warrior! I can take care of myself! There's a difference between training and being able to fight! You have a lot to learn. I won't allow this nonsense to continue... ...please call the tournament off, your Highness! Dhritarashtra realised that the enmity between the brothers... ...was out in the open Dronacharya had averted bloodshed this time... but... My weapons and I are restless... ...haven't seen a battlefield in ages It's better that way... I fear war Fear? When you're so close to it? What are you trying to tell me? The Kauravs and Pandavas are headed for war... Don't say that Pitama... Your Highness, both Yudhishtir and Duryodhan... have equal right to the throne and there's only one throne... What alternative is there but war? I won't let that happen... I will the send the Pandavas away... Where to, Dhritarashtra? There's no place far enough from the flames of jealousy There is... The palace of Varnavat. That's nice of you Bheem... taking food along for the family Family? You'd better not eye my food... ...I'll protect it no matter what! Mother! It so nice we'll be living together... Where's Arjun? I'm leaving, Guruji, please give me your blessings Arjun... what I did the other day... was for you and your safety Consider it a teacher's love for his student and forgive me... Who am I to forgive you? Just give me your blessings My blessings will always be with you... ...but how about my gurudakshina ? Fight! How can I fight you? Get up, fight! Attack! Look at you... You hold a weapon but can't use it You're trained in warfare... but you're terrified You call yourself a warrior? Arjun, you may not understand this but a day will come... when we will fight each other Just promise me, that on that day... you will fight me like a true warrior That will be my gurudakshina. Promise me this, Arjun Go now... ...my blessings are with you. The Pandavas were sent to Varnavat... Dronacharya's words continued to haunt Arjun But the brothers were glad... ...to be away from the Kauravas' politics. It's so beautiful here Arjun! Catch! Arjun, here... throw it to me! Give it to me... Run! Arjun! Arjun... Follow me... Come on! Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! We're lucky I found this passage or we'd all be dead Go on ahead, Arjun... Duryodhan is behind all this... ...I should break his head in two! And here you are, with your head hanging low Very impressive, Prince Yudhishtir! Bheem! Let me say it mother... ...because you cannot stand up for what's yours... ...we're scurrying about like rats! What should we do then? We have no men, no weapons... How do you propose we fight? Shhhh The jackals will feast tonight... ...dinner is served! Arjun had never seen bloodshed like this before... ...he realised now... ...that all the training, all the weapons... ...meant nothing at all Mother... I thought I was brave... ...but what Bheem did today... I could never do... ...I was scared. Scared? Of what? Dronacharya was right... I don't have what it takes to be a warrior I have a lot to learn Time is the greatest teacher, Arjun... ...and a time will come when your bravery... ...will be displayed for the world to see... I believe in you. Ridiculous! This brahmin outfit is ridiculous! At least Duryodhan won't recognise you And why is that? Because of this! Friends, where are you headed? Friend... Our lives are about prayer and food... ...we're praying now, and headed towards food! Food? Where? Kampilya There's a huge archery competition there... ...by which the Princess of Panchal will choose a husband Don't tempt me anymore, sir, Let's go! Certainly! You look like you truly enjoy food! Come along then! No! Sir... ...please be on your way... ...and you, this way! I could almost taste the food... ...and you led me away! Let's go to Kampilya... To eat? Why not? Aren't you hungry? Actually, we should go to Kampilya... What do you mean? If we win the princess' hand... the King of Panchal... ...his kingdom and his army... ...will be with us and then we can challenge Duryodhan! ...but who'll win the archery contest? I will Arjun! Yes brother, I will win the Swayamvar! The bravest warriors... ...the greatest marksmen... ...the biggest wrestlers... and the strongest kings... Raise your weapons and rattle your jewellery... for the mighty prince Meghasandhi! You know the rules Use your arrow to shoot the goldfish succeed and you win the maiden's hand Apologies! Shame! Shame! Is there no one brave enough? Will the goldfish live on? Will the beautiful Draupadi's garland... ...dry and wither away? Is there no archer in this august assembly... who can accept this challenge? Anyone out there? Any archer? Anyone at all? Will you just stand there staring into each other's eyes? Duryodhan! The Pandavas are alive! What? The Pandava family has entered the royal court Greetings, Your Highness! Welcome! I'm overjoyed to learn that you are alive and well. Come closer Kunti, who is that with you? My daughter in law, your highness Daughter in law? Come closer, my dear. She is very beautiful, Kunti. What is your name? Krishna Draupadi, daughter of the King of Panchal. A princess? The daughter of King Drupada... Brave warrior, general of a great army. Draupadi... You've been a Princess thus far... ...but you will soon be called Queen! Council... ...it is time for the sons of Pandu... ...to be given their birthright! Father! If anyone has a right to the kingdom... It is I, your son! You are the King of Hastinapur, and I am your son... This is the truth, and that is the law! Duryodhan! The rules also state that... ...no one is allowed to interrupt the King! From now on the Throne of Hastinapur... ...belongs to Prince Duryodhan, and... Prince Yudhishtir will be... the King of Khandavprastha! May peace prevail between both kingdoms! Long live, Prince Duryodhan! Long live, Prince Yudhishtir! Long live, Prince Duryodhan! I don't want charity! This kingdom is mine! And no part of it, no matter how small... belongs to those Pandavas! The King's orders must be followed I won't have it! I won't give them an inch! This is what they give us, this swamp?! Arjun, how are we going to live here? Hey, don't go criticising the kingdom of King Yudhishtir! Look how peacefully it's citizens are living! Snakes, scorpions, crocodiles... owls! If they're happy we can be too, isn't that so King Yudhishtir? Your Highness! The frogs want an audience with you! That's enough, Bheem! Who is it? Show yourself! Come out! Don't be afraid! We are your Kings! Pardon us, your Highness... How were we to know... this place is crawling with bandits We thought it was them. Is there no one here for your protection? No your highness, no soldiers, no army, no one! We'll take care of it now... There's word out... ...that bandits may attack tonight... ...be careful, Your Highness. It's sundown your Highness... ...probably the cows coming home! Those aren't cows, it's a horse... Hold on... ...I know him Yes Arjun, we have met before. I am Krishna Vasudev Duryodhan is behind all this... him and his father! We must take revenge! Why settle for such a small goal Bheem? That's a small goal? Birds and animals fight for survival... ...but greatness lies in the greater good. What do you mean? Hastinapur is headed for ruin... ...it's not just the king... ...the whole kingdom is obsessed with greed. And the problem doesn't end with Hastinapur... ...it's the entire country. Crime, terrorism, wars, have taken over... ...and the innocent are suffering. That is what you have to deal with... ...you have to instill peace across the land. You are right. We are with you. Good! Great! We have to save our necks before we can save the world! We're surrounded by bandits! Bheem! Tell us, how will we win this battle? With courage, with belief... with determination! Here... Here? But we're not safe here. What if someone attacks? That's what I want. What? I don't understand. What are you doing? Waiting. Aren't you scared? Arjun... We know nothing of the future... ...so why be concerned with what hasn't happened? So much self confidence? Just do what you have to Arjun, forget the consequences. Focus on your task, and the fear will take care of itself. Listen The emblem of Hastinapur? Who are you? I'm the Trigartha King. Let him live He'll be more useful to us than he was to Duryodhan. You were right... ...it's not just a city... ...but a great Kingdom that we need to build... we will built it over these ashes... Lord Indra's home on Earth. Who are you fighting son? Duryodhan! Duryodhan? Yes, father. Look at his moustache! Of course... let's go... ...there's a war about to break out! Wait... wait! I know... the story isn't over yet. The Pandavas built a kingdom just like they said... Indraprastha, the city of gold. It was time for Yudhishtir's coronation... ...and Kings from all over the land attended... ...including all the Kauravas. So this is Indraprastha. Long live King Yudhishtir! May his reign be forever! May his reign be prosperous! According to tradition... ...all subjects of the King will now... ...offer their respect. Every member of the Kuru clan is present here today... ...I confer the honour of receiving salutations... ...to the greatest of them all... King Duryodhan! He will accept the offerings on my behalf I promise to serve and... ...protect King Yudhishtir. An insult... A grave insult! I promised Susharman... ...that he would bow to no King... ...and today he bowed. Yudhishtir has insulted me. Humiliated me! Allow me to command your army and... ...watch how I lay the Pandavas heads... at your feet. No, Karna The time for war is over... The Pandavas are too powerful We don't stand a chance. Actually, you do, nephew! What if I told you... ...that Yudhishtir would hand his kingdom over... with his own hands... wouldn't that be nice? Uncle! Here I am burning from the insult... ...and you're adding fuel to the fire! Not fuel my dear nephew... ...this is what I'm adding! Shakuni had found a way to destroy the Pandavas... He knew that on Coronation Day... ...no King could refuse a challenge. So on Shakuni's advice... Duryodhan challenged Yudhishtir to a game of dice. I'll play... but I shall choose the dice. Of course! Uncle Shakuni will play on my behalf I hope you don't mind? After all, we're all family here! Should I explain the rules of the game, son? I know them well... You can withdraw from the game only after 20 moves. Let us begin. This is my wager. Are you serious? I bet all my jewellery! We win! I bet all the gold in the treasury. Me too. We win! My horse carriages. Me too! My elephants... My horses. We win! My Soldiers! My army! We win! Servants... Maids... All my wealth and property. Me too! I... ...bet my Kingdom. Think carefully... ...your Highness... ...you are doing this of your own free will. If you wish, we can let you retire from the game... Isn't that so, Uncle? Absolutely, nephew... Today is his first day as King... ...it's the least we can do! I bet my entire Kingdom! Whatever you say! Uncle, roll the dice! We win! Quiet! No one questions the rules of the game! And the game isn't over yet! Tell me, Your Highness... ...you have no kingdom, no land... ...no wealth and no belongings... ...what will you wager now? I... bet my brother... Arjun Arjun was silent As one after another... Bheem... Nakul, Sahdev... and finally... Yudhishtir himself... ...were lost to Shakuni's plan. Arjun was silent. And he stayed silent... ...at the last throw of the dice... We win! Move it! Help! Arjun, save me! Arjun! Arjun, save me! Save me! Arjun! Save me! Draupadi was dragged out in front of the court. Humiliated in public. And Arjun... stayed silent. He stayed silent?! He did nothing at all? Coward. I would have cut off Duryodhan's head. It wasn't that simple Yudhishtir was his King How could he act against his command? Was the command more important than Draupadi's honour?! That's what he couldn't understand. Why don't you say he wasn't really a warrior... ...like he thought he was? Go now... ...your father must be looking for you. Tell me one thing... ...who told you this story? No one. Come on Yuvraj... ...it's time to finish the story. I don't want to listen anymore... ...so much sorrow... What did Arjun have left? Nothing at all. Why tell me such a story? So you know what it really takes... ...to be a warrior. When Draupadi was dragged in front of the court... Dhritarashtra realised the situation had gone out of hand... He commanded the last move be played again... with banishment from the Kingdom being the wager Banishment for twelve years... And one year in total exile. If in the 13th year, the Pandavas were seen anywhere... the banishment would continue for another 12 years. We win! The result was the same Tell me something Nephew... This land... ...this kingdom, is now all yours... What will you do with it? Burn it to the ground All of it. Arjun... You too? Is this my fate? First the Kauravas... and now you? Speak to me Arjun! What can I say? I'm ashamed. Your shame won't wipe out... ...my humiliation. I'm more guilty in this than Dushashan... I did not protect you. Don't say that, Arjun I know what you're going through... But we can't live 13 years in silence... How long will we suffer our humiliation? What can we do? Promise me something I have nothing left but my word... Promise me... ...that you will avenge my humiliation... You will have one purpose... ...the annihilation of the Kauravas. You will have one goal... To completely destroy Duryodhan. And you will live 13 years waiting for that day. Promise me this. Arjun, let's go! We have to leave now! I'm not coming with you. Why not? I'm heading to the Northern Mountains. To Uttarkuru. Uttarkuru... the home of the Gods? Yes, brother... ...give me your blessings. Go, Arjun... ...may you find what you seek. Arjun travelled to the land of the gods... ...to prepare for war. What have you done? My boar! You killed my boar... You killed my boar! Forgive me... I thought it was attacking me And what if it did? You would have lost your life, that's all! Who are you? I am Arjun, son of Kunti I'm here on a penance A penance?! With a bow and arrow?! Liar! You're going to regret this! I won't spare you! Drop your weapons! Drop them now! Impossible! Who are you? Don't you recognise me? Who was this hunter? A guardian of heaven? Or a God himself... ...who was testing Arjun's will? What was it? Arjun's reward for his penance The bow of the Gods Lord Shiva came disguised as a hunter to test Arjun he told Arjun to believe in himself, in the truth When Arjun understood this... the Gods were pleased and they blessed him So did Arjun return and kill Duryodhan? No. Don't you remember... ...after the 12 years of banishment... ...they had to live in exile for one year? Of course! So where did they go for their exile? No one knows where they are. What do you mean? Are they are still in hiding? Must be... I wouldn't know. I know where they are! What?! At the bottom of the ocean... ...in the belly of a whale! What whale? A huge one! When their exile is through... they'll tear open it's stomach and leap out! Don't worry your little head with such lofty matters! It'll burst! Now go to sleep... ...we'll finish the story tomorrow. Who is it? Arjun? It's me... Bheem! How many times have I told you not to use my name?! What should I call you then? Brihannala? Or Sister? You should've been a clown, not a cook, Ballav! Let's go! Kanka... Tantipala... Granthik... I'm so pleased to meet you! Brihannala, what's with him? He used my name again Ballav, how many times must we remind you... There's just one day to go... tomorrow we can be ourselves again! One silly mistake will have us banished for another 12 years! I get it, calm down I'll be careful Anyone hungry? With food like this I'd happily live 100 years in exile! I heard something... Krishna? What brings you here? I'm here to warn you As the end of your exile draws closer Duryodhan is getting more anxious... and he's getting closer to you How does he know where we are? He has spies everywhere looking for you You must be very careful So he was a spy? He was... ...and there could be many more What? Krishna? He killed my companion So that's where they're hiding! Prepare the army! We attack tonight! As you command! We've been attacked! Kanka, what's happening? It's the Trigarthas... ...stealing our cattle! Uttar, go inside! Now! Everybody head North! Move! After days of stirring food a chance to use my weapons! The Trigarthas have done exactly as commanded! The Virat army is headed north So there's no one to protect the city... We'll attack from the west Come sundown and Virat will be in our hands... ...and the Pandavas... at our feet! What do you think? They'll sit there waiting? They'll defend Virat first, then bother about their exile It won't be easy to defeat them We don't need to defeat them! All we have to do is find them! The rules of the game will take care of the rest! The rules were unfair... ...and this war is unjust. Do you think it would be fair... ...if I replaced you as General right now?! Towards Virat! Sound the alarm! The Kuru army is attacking from the west! How many men are still in the palace? Three, Your Highness. So there's no option but to close the gates... ...and wait for the end. Take those men and guard the entrance! Your Highness... ...I'm the youngest of the three! I'll protect you! I will guard the western entrance. An unusual calm An omen of a great war The peace before the coming of death Enough!! Leave if you fear death! Go sing hymns! I will fight on my own No matter who comes through that door! Great war! Death! Those two? A child... ...and... a... lady?! Such a massive army! Of course it's massive, it's from Hastinapur! Turn back... Yuvraj? I... I... don't want to fight. How can I fight them on my own? You are not alone, Yuvraj I'm here with you. Then we'll die together! Do what you have to Yuvraj... ...forget the consequences Focus on your task, and the fear will take care of itself. That's what Krishna said to Arjun! I'm not Arjun! You are no less than Arjun. That was just a story, Brihannala! I'm not Arjun, I'm the Prince of Virat... ...and I order you to turn back! Now! Well... ...that's the end of the war... ...we scared the child away! Where are you taking me? Take me to the palace! Where have you brought me? Climb that tree! Why? Don't waste time, climb! These weapons? How did you know they were here? Who... are you? Arjun! Form the Chakravyuh! Duryodhan, you will stay in the middle of the Chakravyuh The sound of a bow and you think it's Arjun?! And even if it is, who should be scared, tell me? Arjun? Or you, with such a large army? Back to your positions! Back to your positions everyone! You may be King of your kingdom But I command this army! And unfortunately I have to protect you Don't ever countermand my orders! Form the Chakravyuh! Arjun Prepare for battle! It's Arjun! He's out in the open! Twelve years of banishment once again! Look up at the sky, Duryodhan... 13 years are over! Hold on tight! Take him prisoner! I want Arjun! Acharya... Raise your weapon Arjun Remember your promise? My Gurudakshina? Of course, I do I remember everything But my war is with Duryodhan, not you Let me pass... You've learned nothing Arjun Duryodhan is my King It's my duty to protect him Okay, I'll fight you But you have the right to strike first Alright Let's see what you've learnt Finish him! No one gets in the way! He's down, he's down! What are you doing, fool? I fought this battle to protect Virat not to destroy you and the mission is over Now go far away from Virat Just remember, our fight isn't over Now tell your men to retreat Retreat Louder! Retreat! Retreat!"
Big Hero 6,Disney,2010,2014,Animation,"Get up! The winner, by total annihilation. Yama! Who is next? Who has the guts to step into the ring, with Little Yama? Can I try? I have a robot. I built it myself. Beat it, kid. House rules. You gotta pay to play. Is this enough? What's your name, little boy? Hiro. Hiro Hamada. Prepare your bot, Zero. Two bots enter, one bot leaves. Fighters ready? Fight! That was my first fight. I... Can I try again? No one likes a sore loser, little boy. Go home. I've got more money. Fighters ready? Fight! Megabot. Destroy. What? No more Little Yama. But, wha... This is not possible! Hey I, I'm as surprised as you are. Beginner's luck. Do you want to go again, Yama? No one hustles Yama! Hey... Teach him a lesson. Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this. Hiro! Get on! Tadashi! Good timing! Oh, mama! Are you ok? Yeah. Are you hurt? No. Then what were you thinking, knucklehead? You graduated high school when you were 13 and this is what you're doing? There they are! Hey! Hold on! Yes! Get back here. Bot fighting is illegal. You're going to get yourself arrested. Bot fighting is not illegal. Betting on bot fighting, that's, that's illegal, but... so lucrative! I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me! Oh, no. Hi, aunt Cass. Are you guys ok? Tell me you're ok. We're fine. We're ok. Oh, good. Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking? For 10 years, I have done the best I could to raise you. Have I been perfect? No. Do I know anything about children? No. Should I have picked up a book on parenting? Probably! Where was I going with this? I had a point. Sorry. We love you, aunt Cass. Well, I love you, too! I had to close up early because of you two felons. On beat poetry night. Stress eating. Because of you. Come on, Mochi. This is really good! You better make this up to aunt Cass before she eats everything in the cafe. For sure. And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead. Absolutely. You're going bot fighting, aren't you? There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it. When are you gonna start doing something with that big brain of yours? What? Go to college like you? So people can tell me stuff I already know? Unbelievable. What would Mom and Dad say? I don't know. They're gone. They died when I was three, remember? Hey! I'll take you. Really? I can't stop you from going, but I'm not going to let you go on your own. Sweet. What are we doing at your nerd school? Botfight's that way! Gotta grab something. Is this gonna take long? Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out. Anyway, you've never seen my lab. Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab! Heads up! Electromag suspension? Hey! Who are you? I'm... Go. Go, this is my brother. Hiro. Welcome to the nerd lab. Yeah. I've never seen electromag suspension on a bike before. Zero resistance, faster bike. But, not fast enough... yet. Do not move. Behind the line, please. Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother, Hiro. Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed. Catch. Laserinduced plasma? Oh, yeah. With a little magnetic confinement for... ultraprecision. How do you find anything in this mess? I have a system. There's a place for everything, and everything in its place. Need this! You can't do that! This is anarchy! Society has rules! Excuse me! Coming through! Tadashi! Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro! I've heard so much about you! Perfect timing. Perfect timing. That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide. 400 pounds of it! Come here, come here, come here. You're going to love this. A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt, a hint of hydrogen peroxide, superheated to 500 Kelvin and... Tada! It's pretty great? It's so pink. Here's the best part. I know, right? Chemical metal embrittlement. Not bad, Honey Lemon. Honey Lemon? Gogo? Wasabi? I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people. One time! Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames. Who's Fred? This guy, right here! Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit. This is not my real face and body. The name's Fred. School mascot by day, but by night... I am also a school mascot. So, what's your major? No, no, no, I'm not a student. But I am, a major science enthusiast. I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula, that can turn me into a firebreathing lizard at will. But she says that's, not science. It's really not. Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray I asked Wasabi for isn't science either. Is it? Nope. Well then, what about invisible sandwich? Hiro. Imagine eating a sandwich, but everybody just thinks you're crazy. Just stop. Laser eyes? What? Tingly fingers? Never gonna happen. Hey, what about a growth serum? So... what have you been working on? I'll show you. Duct tape? I hate to break it to you, bro. Already been invented. Hey! Dude! This is what I've been working on. Hello. I am Baymax. Your personal healthcare companion. I was alerted to the need for medical attention when you said; A robotic nurse. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain? Physical or emotional? I will scan you now. Scan complete. You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm. I suggest an antibacterial spray. What's in the spray, specifically? The primary ingredient is bacitracin. That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that. You are not allergic to bacitracin. You do have a mild allergy to... peanuts. Not bad. You've done some serious coding on this thing? Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures. This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax. Vinyl? Yeah, going for a nonthreatening, huggable kind of thing. Looks like a walking marshmallow. No offense. I am a robot. I cannot be offended. Hyperspectral cameras? Yep.  Titanium skeleton? Carbon fiber.  Right. Even lighter.  Killer actuators. Where did you get those?  Machined them right here, inhouse. Really? Yup. He can lift 1,000 pounds. Shut up. You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop. Nice. I cannot deactivate until you say, you are satisfied with your care. Well then, I'm satisfied with my care. He's going to help a lot of people. Hey, what kind of battery does it use? Lithium ion. You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster. Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada? Hey, Professor. Actually, I was just finishing up. You must be Hiro. Botfighter, right? When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do. May I? Sure. Magneticbearing servos. Pretty sick? Wanna see how I put them together? Hey, genius! He invented them. You're Robert Callaghan? Like as in... the CallaghanCatmull spline, and Callaghan's Laws of Robotics? That's right. Ever think about applying here? Your age wouldn't be an issue. I don't know. He's pretty serious about his career in botfighting. Well, kind of serious. I can see why. With your bot, winning must come easy. Yeah, I guess. Well, if you like things easy, then my program isn't for you. We push the boundaries of robotics here. My students go on to shape the future. Nice to meet you, Hiro. Good luck with the botfights. We gotta hurry if you want to catch that botfight. I have to go here. If I don't go to this nerd school, I'm gonna lose my mind. How do I get in? Every year, the school has a student showcase. You come up with something that blows Callaghan away, you're in. But, it's gotta be great. Trust me. It will be. Nothing! No ideas! Useless, empty brain! Washed up at 14. So sad. I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in. Hey, I'm not giving up on you. What are you doing? Shake things up. Use that big brain of yours to think your way out. What? Look for a new angle. A lot of sweet tech here today. How are you feeling? You're talking to an exbot fighter. Takes a lot more than this to rattle me. Yep, he's nervous. You have nothing to fear, little fellow. He's so tense. No, I'm not. Relax, Hiro. Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Gogo. Stop whining. Woman up. I'm fine! What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint? Fresh pair of underpants? Underpants? You need serious help. Hey, I come prepared. I haven't done laundry in six months. One pair lasts me four days. I go front, I go back, I go insideout. Then I go front and back. That is both disgusting and awesome. Don't encourage him. It's called, recycling. Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.  Oh, yeah. This is it. I guess I'm up. Ok, ok. Photo, photo! Everybody say, Hiro. Hiro! Yeah! We love you, Hiro. Good luck! Don't mess it up. Break a leg, little man. Science, yeah! Alright, bro. This is it. Come on. Don't leave me hanging. What's going on? I really want to go here. Hey. You got this. Hi.  My name is Hiro...  Sorry.  My name is Hiro Hamada,  and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool.  I hope you like it.  This, is a microbot.  Breathe. It doesn't look like much, but...  when it links up with the rest of its pals...  things get a little more interesting.  The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter.  I think what I want them to do...  They do it.  The applications for this tech are limitless.  Construction.  What used to take teams of people working by hand  for months or years,  can now be accomplished, by one person.  That's just the beginning.  How about transportation?  Microbots can move anything anywhere,  with ease.  If you can think it,  the microbots can do it.  The only limit is your imagination.  Microbots!  That's my nephew! Yes! My family! I love my family! Nailed it! You did it! Not bad! Yeah! Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude! They loved you. That was amazing! Yes. With some development, your tech could be revolutionary. Alistair Krei! May I? Extraordinary. I want your microbots at Krei Tech. Shut up. Mr. Krei is right. Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech. You can continue to develop them, or you can sell them to a man who's only guided by his own selfinterest. Robert, I know how you feel about me, but it shouldn't affect... This is your decision, Hiro. But you should know Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science to get where he is. That's just not true. I wouldn't trust Krei Tech with your microbots, or anything else. Hiro, I'm offering you more money than any 14yearold could imagine. I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei, but they're not for sale. I thought you were smarter than that. Robert. Mr. Krei. That's my brother's. That's right. I look forward to seeing you in class. Unbelievable! That's what I'm talking about. Alright, geniuses, let's feed those hungry brains. Back to the cafÃ©! Dinner is on me! Yes! Nothing is better than free food! aunt Cass? We'll... We'll catch up, ok? Sure. I'm so proud of you. Both... Both. Both of you. Thanks, aunt Cass. I know what you're going to say. I should be proud of myself, because I'm finally using my gift for something important. No, no. I was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show. Hilarious. What? Welcome to nerd school, nerd. Hey, I... I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, so... you know, thanks for not giving up on me. Are you ok? Yeah. I'm ok. But. But Professor Callaghan is still in there. Tadashi, no! Callaghan's in there. Someone has to help. Tadashi!  Tadashi!  Here. Have some tea. Hey, sweetie. Hey, aunt Cass. Mrs. Matsuda's in the cafÃ©. She's wearing something super inappropriate for an 80 year old. That always cracks you up. You should come down. Maybe later. The university called again. It's been a few weeks since classes started but... They said it's not too late to register. Ok. Thanks. I'll think about it. Hey, Hiro.  We just wanted to check in, and see how you're doing.  We wish you were here, buddy.  Hiro, if I could have only one superpower right now,  it would be the ability to crawl through this camera,  and give you a big hug.  Hello. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion. Hey, Baymax. I didn't know you were still active. I heard a sound of distress. What seems to be the trouble? I just stubbed my toe a little. I'm fine. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain? A zero. I'm ok, really. Thanks. You can shrink now. Does it hurt when I touch it? That's ok. No, no touching. I'm fine... You have fallen. You think? On a scale of 1 to... On a scale... On a sca... On a scale of 1 to 10... On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain? Zero. It is alright to cry. No. No, no, no, no. Crying is a natural response to pain. I'm not crying. I will scan you for injuries. Don't scan me. Scan complete. Unbelievable. You have sustained no injuries. However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels indicate that you are experiencing mood swings, common in adolescence. Diagnosis. Puberty. What? Ok. Time to shrink now. You should expect an increase in body hair, especially on your face, chest, armpits, and... Thank you! That's enough. You may also experience strange and powerful new urges. Ok! Let's get you back in your luggage. I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. Fine. I'm satisfied with my... My microbot? This doesn't make any sense. Puberty can often be a confusing time for a young adolescent flowering into manhood. No. The thing is attracted to the other microbots but... that's impossible. They were destroyed in the fire. Dumb thing's broken. Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere. Oh, yeah? Why don't you... find out where it's trying to go? Would that stabilize your pubescent mood swings? Absolutely. Baymax? Baymax? Baymax? What? Hiro? Hey! Hey, aunt Cass! You're up and... Yeah. I figured it was time. Are you registering for school? Yes. I thought about what you said. Really inspired me. Oh, honey, that's so great. Ok. Special dinner tonight. I'll whip up some chicken wings. Yeah. You know, with the hot sauce that makes our faces numb. Ok, sounds good. Great! Last hug. Baymax! Baymax! Watch it! Baymax! Baymax! Are you crazy? What are you doing? I have found where your tiny robot wants to go. I told you, it's broken. It's not trying to go... Locked. There is a window. Please exercise caution. A fall from this height could lead to bodily harm. Oh, no. Excuse me, while I let out some air. Are you done? Yes. It will take me a moment to reinflate. Fine, just keep it down. My microbots? Someone's making more. Hiro? You gave me, a heart attack! My hands are equipped with defibrillators. Clear. Stop! Stop, stop! It's just an expression. Oh, no. Run! Oh, come on! I am not fast. Yeah, no kidding! Go! Go! Come on. Kick it down! Then punch it! Go! Go! Oh, come on! Go, go, go! Move it! Come on! No, no. Come on! The window! Suck it in! Baymax! Hiro? Come on, let's get out of here. Go! Hurry! Alright, let me get this straight. A man in a kabuki mask attacked you, with an army of miniature flying robots. Microbots. Microbots. Yeah. He was controlling them telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter. So, Mr. Kabuki was using ESP, to attack you and balloon man. Did you file a report when your flying robots were stolen? No. I thought they were all destroyed. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but Baymax was there, too. Tell him. Yes, officer. He's telling the truth. What the... What's wrong with you? Low battery. Try to keep it together.  I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion. Kid, how about we call your parents and get them down here? What? Write your name and number down on this piece of paper and we can... I've gotta get you home to your charging station. Can you walk? I will scan you now. Scan complete. Healthcare. Ok. If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it? We jumped out a window. No! Quiet! We jumped out a window. You can't say things like that around aunt Cass. Hiro? You home, sweetie? That's right. I thought I heard you. Hey. Hey, aunt Cass. Look at my little college man. I can't wait to hear all about it! And wings are almost ready. Winnn... Will you be quiet? Yeah, wings! Alright, get ready to have your face melted. We are gonna feel these things tomorrow. You know what I'm saying? Ok. Sit down. Tell me everything. The thing is that, since I registered so late, I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on. What was that? Mochi. That darn cat. At least take a plate for the road, ok? Don't work too... Thanks for understanding. Hairy baby. Hairy baby. Alright, come on. I'm healthcare, your personal Baymax companion. One foot in front of the other. This doesn't make any sense. Tadashi. What? Tadashi. Tadashi's gone. When will he return? He's dead, Baymax. Tadashi was in excellent health. With a proper diet and exercise, he should have lived a long life. Yeah, he should have. But there was a fire... Now, he's gone. Tadashi is here. No. People keep saying he's not really gone. As long as we remember him. It still hurts. I see no evidence of physical injury. It's a different kind of hurt. You are my patient. I would like to help. You can't fix this one, buddy. What are you doing? I am downloading a database on personal loss. Database downloaded. Treatments include contact with friends and loved ones. I am contacting them now. No, no, no! I... I... Don't do that. Your friends have been contacted. Unbelievable. Now, what are you doing? Other treatments include, compassion and physical reassurance. I'm ok. Really. You will be alright. There, there. Thanks, Baymax. I am sorry about the fire. It's ok. It was an accident. Unless... Unless it wasn't. At the showcase that... that guy in the mask stole my microbots and... and set the fire to cover his tracks. He's responsible for Tadashi. We gotta catch that guy. It's alive!  It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!  If we're gonna catch that guy, you need some upgrades. Will apprehending the man in the mask improve your emotional state? Absolutely. Let's work on your moves. Now, let's take care of this. I have some concerns. This armor may undermine my nonthreatening, huggable design. That's kind of the idea, buddy. You look sick. I cannot be sick. I am a robot. It's just an expression. Data transfer complete.  I fail to see how karate makes me a better healthcare companion. You want to keep me healthy, don't you?  Punch this.  Yes! Hammerfist! Side kick! Knifehand! Back kick! Gummy bears! Yes! Yeah! Fist bump! Fist bump? Is not in my fighting database. No this, this isn't a fighting thing, it's... what people do sometimes when they're... excited or pumped up. Hey, now you're getting it. I will add fist bump to my caregiving matrix. Alright. Let's go get that guy. Come on! Get him, Baymax! We're too late. Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere. Come on. Always wait one hour after eating before swimming. Hey! Come on! Your heart rate has increased dramatic... Ok Baymax, time to use those upgrades. Hiro? No, no, no! Get out of here! Go! Dude, what are you doing out here? Nothing! Just, out for a walk. Helps my pubescent mood swings. Is that Baymax? Yeah, but you really... Why is he wearing carbon fiber underpants? I also know karate. You guys need to go. No, don't push us away, Hiro. We're here for you. That's why Baymax contacted us. Those who suffer a loss, require support from friends and loved ones. Ok, but I... Who would like to share their feelings first? I'll go. Ok. My name is Fred, and it has been 30 days since my last... Holy mother of Megazon! Am I the only one seeing this? Oh, my gosh! Oh, no! Go! Go Baymax! Get him! No, no, no, no, no! What are you... What are you doing? I'm saving your life. Baymax can handle that guy! Oh, no. Wasabi! Goodbye! Hiro. Explanation. Now. He stole my microbots. He started the fire. I don't know who he is! Baymax, palmheel strike! Hard left! That mask, the black suit... We're under attack from a super villain, people! I mean, how cool is that? I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool! Why are we stopped? The light's red! There are no red lights in a car chase! Why is he trying to kill us? Why are you trying to kill us? It's classic villain. We've seen too much! Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't know he's trying to kill us. Car! He's trying to kill us! Did you just put your blinker on? You have to indicate your turn! It's the law! That's it. Stop the car! Baymax and I can take this guy! Seatbelts save lives. Buckle up, every time. What are you doing? What are you doing? Did we lose him? Look out! Baymax, hold on! We're not gonna make it! We're gonna make it! No! We're gonna make it! We're gonna make it! We're not gonna make it! We're gonna make it! We made it! Yes! I told you we'd make it! Your injuries require my attention. And your body temperatures are low. We should get out of here. I know a place. Where are we? Fred. Where are you going? Welcome to mi casa. That's French for front door. It's really not. Listen, nitwit. A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us. I'm not in the mood for any... Welcome home, Master Frederick. Heathcliff, my man! Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here. Gimme some. Freddie, this is your house? I thought you lived under a bridge. Well, technically, it belongs to my parents. They're on a vacay, on the family island. We should totally go some time. Frolic. You gotta be kidding me. If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask, I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today. My brain hates my eyes for seeing this. Your body temperature is still low. Yeah. It's like spooning a warm marshmallow. It's so nice. Oh, yeah, that's toasty. Good robot. Does this symbol mean anything to you guys? Yes! It's a bird! No! The guy in the mask was carrying something with this symbol on it. Apprehending the man in the mask, will improve Hiro's emotional state. Apprehend him? We don't even know who he is. I have a theory. Dr. Slaughter, MD? Actually, millionaire weapons designer, Malcolm Chazzletick. The Annihilator? Behind the mask, industrialist, Reid Axworthy. Baron von Destruct? Just get to the point! Don't you guys get it? The man in the mask who attacked us, is none other than... VoilÃ ! Alistair Krei. What? Think about it. Krei wanted your microbots, and you said no. But rules don't apply to a man like Krei. There's no way. The guy is too high profile. Then who was that guy in the mask? I don't know. We don't know anything about him. His blood type is ABnegative. Cholesterol levels are... Baymax, you scanned him? I am programed to assess everyone's healthcare needs. Yes! I can use the data from your scan to find him. You'd have to scan everyone in San Fransokyo. That might take, I don't know, forever. No, no, no, no. I... I just have to look for another angle. Got it! I'll scan the whole city at the same time. I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor. Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy, I need to upgrade all of you. Upgrade who, now? Those who suffer a loss, require support from friends and loved ones. Ok, I like where this is heading! We can't go against that guy! We're nerds! Hiro, we want to help but... we're just, us. No. You can be, way more. Tadashi Hamada was our best friend. We're in. Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this? Our origin story begins. We're gonna be superheroes! Arms up. The neurotransmitter must be in his mask. We get the mask, and he can't control the bots. Game over. Super Jump! Super Jump! I breathe fire. I love it! Not bad. Anybody else's suit riding up on them? Hey, guys! Check this out. I'd like to introduce, Baymax 2.0. He's glorious. Hello. Hold up. Focus. Show them what you got, buddy. The fist, show them the fist. No, not that. The thing, the other thing. Rocket fist make Freddie so happy! That's just one of his new upgrades! Baymax, wings. No way! Thrusters. I fail to see how flying makes me a better healthcare companion. I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome! Full thrust. Steady, big guy. Look, let's just take this slow. Up, up, up, up, up! Thrust, thrust, thrust! Too much thrust! Too much thrust! Too much thrust! No, no, no, no! Back on! Back on! On! On! On! Zoom... Go up! Up, up, up! Up! Oh, man! Maybe... Maybe enough flying, today.  What do you say?  Your neurotransmitter levels are rising steadily. Which means what? The treatment is working. Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no! Baymax! Yes! Yeah! Yes! That was... That was... Sick. It is just an expression. That's. That's right, buddy. I am never taking the bus again. Your emotional state has improved. I can deactivate if you say you are satisfied with your care. What? No, no, I don't want you to deactivate. We still have to find that guy. So, fire up that supersensor. Functionality improved. 1000% increase in range. I have found a match... on that island. Killer view. Yeah. If I... If I wasn't terrified of heights, I'd probably love this. But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it. There. Baymax, take us in. Awesome! Our first landing together as a team. Guys, come on. Quarantine? Do you people know what quarantine means? Quarantine. Enforced isolation to prevent contamination that could lead to disease, or in some cases, death. There's a skull face on this one. A skull face! Be ready. He could be anywhere. Fire! Spitting fire! Spitting fire! That was a bird. Well... at least we know our gear works.  Six intrepid friends   Led by Fred   Their leader, Fred   Fred's Angels   Fred's Angels   Harnessing the power of the sun   With the ancient amulet   They found in the attic   The amulet is green   It's probably an emerald  Fred, I will laserhand you in the face. Guys. Any sign of him, Baymax? This structure is interfering with my sensor. Perfect. The robot's broken. Guys, you might want to see this. What do you think it is, genius? I'm not sure. But look. Hiro. Krei. That's right.  We were asked to do the impossible.  That's what we did.  We've reinvented the very concept of transportation.  Friends, I present Project Silent Sparrow.  General, may I?  Magic hat! Teleportation.  The transport of matter instantaneously through space.  Not science fiction anymore.  Now, we didn't spend billions of tax dollars  to teleport hats.  Ladies and gentlemen, you're here to witness history.  Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?  We've invited all these people.  Might as well give them a show.  Tminus, 30 seconds, to launch.  29... 28... This is Argo.  Capsule's in position. 27...  Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity in the magnetic containment field.  Mr. Krei, is there a problem?  No. No problem.  It's well within the parameters.  Let's move forward.  3... 2... 1...  Cabin pressure is go.  Pod engaged.  Field breach! Abort!  We've lost all contact with the pod.  Oh, no. It's breaking up! The pilot is gone.  Portal two is down.  The magnetic containment field's down!  Krei, shut it down, now!  I want this island sealed off!  The government shut down Krei's experiment. And he's using your microbots to steal his machine back. Krei is the guy in the mask. Oh, no. Baymax, get us out of here. Go for the transmitter. Behind his mask. Baymax! Alright, what's the plan? It's Fred time. Super Jump! Gravity Crush! Falling hard. Seriously, what is the plan? Get the mask. Right behind you. For real, what is the plan? Hey! Hey! You... You want to dance, masked man? Because you'll be dancing with these. Hand over the mask, or you'll get a taste of this! And a little bit of that! Hey! I did alright. Is that all you got? You got that, too? It's back into the fire! It's over, Krei. Pro... Professor Callaghan? The explosion... You died. No. I had your microbots. But, Tadashi. You just let him die. Give me the mask, Hiro. He went in there to save you! That was his mistake! Baymax, destroy. My programing prevents me from injuring a human being. Not anymore. Hiro, this is not what... Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!  No! Stop, Baymax! No, stop! He's getting away! Baymax! My healthcare protocol has been violated. I regret any distress I may have caused. How could you do that?  I had him! What you just did, we never signed up for. We said we'd catch the guy. That's it. I never should have let you help me! Baymax, find Callaghan. My enhanced scanner has been damaged. Wings. Hiro, this isn't part of the plan. Fly! Hiro! Your blood pressure is elevated. You appear to be distressed. I'm fine! There. Is it working?  My sensor is operational. Good.  Then let's get... What? Are you going to remove my healthcare chip? Yes. Open!  My purpose is to heal the sick and injured. Baymax, open your access port. Do you want me to terminate Professor Callaghan? Just open!  Will terminating Professor Callaghan, improve your emotional state? Yes! No! I don't know! Open your access! Is this what Tadashi wanted? It doesn't matter! Tadashi programed me to aid and... Tadashi's gone! Tadashi's gone. Tadashi is here. No. He's not here. Tadashi is here. This is Tadashi Hamada.  And this is the first test of my robotics project.  Hello, I am Baymax.  Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!  The seventh test of my robotics project.  Hello, I...  What? What?  Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop scan! Stop...  Tadashi Hamada again,  and this is the 33rd test of my robotics project.  I'm not giving up on you.  You don't understand this yet, but people need you.  So, let's get back to work.  This is Tadashi Hamada,  and this is the 84th test.  What do you say, big guy?  Hello, I am Baymax,  your personal healthcare companion.  It works.  It works!  This is amazing! You...  You work!  I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.  I knew it.  Oh, you work. I can't believe it! I can't...  Ok. Alright, big moment, here.  Scan me.  Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.  This indicates that you are happy.  I am. I really am.  Oh, man.  Wait till my brother sees you.  You're gonna help so many people, buddy.  So many.  That's all for now.  I am satisfied with my care.  Thank you, Baymax. I'm so sorry. I guess I'm not like my brother. Hiro. Guys, I... I... We're going to catch Callaghan, and this time, we'll do it right. But maybe don't leave your team stranded on a spooky island next time. Oh, man. Nah, it's cool. Heathcliff picked us up in the family chopper. Hiro, we found something you should see. You almost got us all killed!  Krei! You did this!  You knew it wasn't ready!  Callaghan? He was there? He was such a good man. What happened? I don't know. But the answer's here somewhere. Wait, wait! Stop. There he is. With the pilot. Hang on. We've invited all these people...  The pilot was Callaghan's daughter. Callaghan blames Krei. This is a revenge story. So, what are we waiting for? This beautiful new campus,  is the culmination of a lifelong dream.  But none of this would've been possible  without a few bumps in the road.  Those setbacks made us stronger, and set us on the path  to a bright future.  What is that? What? Setback? Was my daughter a setback? Callaghan! But you... Your daughter, that... That was an accident. No! You knew it was unsafe. My daughter is gone because of your arrogance. What are you doing? You took everything from me when you sent Abigail into that machine. Now I'm taking everything from you. No! No! No! You can't! You're going to watch everything you've built disappear. Then, it's your turn. Professor Callaghan! Let him go! Is this what Abigail would've wanted? Abigail is gone! This won't change anything. Trust me, I know. Listen to the kid, Callaghan. Please, let me go. I'll give you anything you want! I want my daughter back! Go for the mask! Baymax! Leaping into action! Oh, no! Getting a little tight. No! He's too strong!  There's no way out! You can't beat him!  Help! I can't beat him.  Hiro!  Hiro? Hiro? Help!  That's it! Hiro.  I know how to beat him. Hiro.  Listen up! Use those big brains of yours  and think your way around the problem.  Look for a new angle.  My arms! They can't go any further! Wait a second, it's a suit. Hello, sign. Care to go for a little spin? Double spin! Behind the back spin! Yeah! Yeah! Baymax! Hiro. I love that robot! Ok, new plan. Forget the mask. Take out the bots. They'll get sucked up into the portal. Now that is a plan! Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover? Like you have to ask. Let's do this, Freddie! Smokescreen! Ready... and... dive! The gravity's getting a little weird here, guys! Wait. Let's use this! These are green blades of fury! Woman up! Double signspin. Now my signs are on fire! Now that's a chemical reaction! Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse. Hammerfist. This ends, now! Looks like you're out of microbots. What? Baymax! No! Our programing prevents us from injuring a human being. But we'll take that. It's still on! We have to shut it down! We can't! The containment field is failing. The portal is gonna tear itself apart! We need to get out of here, now! Baymax! My sensor is detecting signs of life. What? Coming from there. The life signs are female. She appears to be in hypersleep. Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive. Abigail. Let's go get her. The portal is destabilizing. You'll never make it. She's alive in there. Someone has to help. What do you say, buddy? Flying makes me a better healthcare companion. Careful! There's Krei Tech debris everywhere. Look out! I have located the patient. Hurry! Come on, buddy, let's get her home. I'll guide you out of here. Let's go! Veer right! Ok, to the left. Hard right! Up and over. Ok, level off. Easy. Nice flying! Almost there! Baymax! Baymax! My thrusters are inoperable. Just grab hold. There is still a way I can get you both to safety. I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. What about you? You are my patient. Baymax. Your health is my only concern. Stop! I'm gonna figure out... Are you satisfied with your care? No. There's gotta be another way. I'm not gonna leave you here. I'll think of something. There is no time. Are you satisfied with your care? Please! No... I can't lose you, too. Hiro, I will always be with you. I'm satisfied with my care. Hiro! Yeah! They made it! Baymax? Miss, can you hear me? What is your name? Abigail Callaghan. Ok, Abigail, you are gonna be fine. We're taking you to the hospital. Move it! Get in there. A massive cleanup continues today,  at the headquarters of Krei Tech Industries.  Reports are still flooding in about a group of unidentified individuals,  who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe.  The whole city of San Fransokyo is asking.  Who are these heroes? And where are they now?  Hey. Hi. It's so exciting. Hey, sweetie! Ok. Last hug. Bye! And just then I was like... Get out of here. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion. Hello, Hiro. We didn't set out to be superheroes,  but sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned.  The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people,  and that's what we're gonna do.  Who are we?  By L E S A I G N E U R  Dad. I just wish I could share  my accomplishments with you. You mean so much to me,  and honestly, I've always felt a distance, what with you being on the family island all the time and... I just wish you could see how... Fred. Son. Dad? I wear them front, I wear them back. I go inside out, then I go front and back. Dad! We have a lot to talk about."
Brave,Disney,2010,2012,Animation,"  Where are you? Come out! Come out!  Come on out.  I'm coming to get you.  Where are you, you little rascal? I'm coming to get you. Hm.  Where is my little birthday girl, hm? I'm going to gobble her up when I find her. Oh!   I'm going to eat you. I am.  Och, Fergus, no weapons on the table. Can I shoot an arrow? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Please? Can I?  Not with that. Why not...  ...use your very own?  Happy birthday, my wee darling!  Now, there's a good girl.  Draw all the way back now to your cheek. That's right. Keep both eyes open. And, loose! I missed. Go and fetch it, then. A bow, Fergus? She's a lady. Ooh! You!       A willo'thewisp.  They are real. Merida, come along, sweetheart. We're leaving now. I saw a wisp. I saw a wisp. A wisp? You know, some say that willo'thewisps lead you to your fate. Oh, aye. Or an arrow. Och! Come on, let's be off before we see a dancing Tatty Bogle. Or a giant having a jigger in the bluebells. Your father doesn't believe in magic. Well, he should. Because it's true.    Mor'du! Elinor, run!  Sire!   Come on, you!  Some say our destiny is tied to the land...  ...as much a part of us as we are of it.  Others say fate is woven together like a cloth.   So that one's destiny intertwines with many others.  It's the one thing we search for or fight to change.  Some never find it.  But there are some who are led.   The story of how my father lost his leg  to the demon bear Mor'du became legend.   I became a sister to three new brothers.  The princes. Hamish, Hubert and Harris.  Wee devils, more like.  They get away with murder.  I can never get away with anything.  I'm the princess.  Oh!  I'm the example.   I've got duties, responsibilities, expectations.  My whole life is planned out,  preparing for the day I become...  Well, my mother.  She's in charge of every single day of my life.    ""Aye, Robin, Jolly Robin, and thou shalt know of mine."" Project! ""And thou shalt know of mine!"" Enunciate. You must be understood from anywhere in the room, or it's all for naught. This is all for naught. I heard that!  From the top. A princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom. She does not doodle.  That's a C, dear.    A princess does not chortle. Mm! Does not stuff her gob! Rises early. ...is compassionate...  ...patient, cautious, clean. And above all, a princess strives for... Well, perfection. But every once in a While,  there's a day when I don't have to be a princess.  No lessons, no expectations.  A day Where anything can happen.  A day I can change my fate.  Yah!    When cold wind is a' calling,   and the sky is clear and bright   Misty mountains sing and beckon,   lead me out into the light   I will ride, I will fly   Chase the wind and touch the sky   I will fly   Chase the wind and touch the sky  Whoohoo!   Where dark woods hide secrets   and mountains are fierce and bold   Deep waters hold reflections   of times lost long ago   I will read every story,   take hold of my own dream  Oh!   Be as strong as the seas are stormy   And proud as an eagle's scream   I will ride, I will fly   Chase the wind and touch the sky   I will fly   Chase the wind and touch the sky    And touch the sky  Whoo!  Chase the wind   Chase the wind   Touch the sky   I'm starving. You hungry too, Angus? Pfft! Oats it is, then.  Good day, Princess. I cannot find the salt. Where did you put it? It was over there a minute ago, the last time I looked at it. And then, out of nowhere, the biggest bear you've ever seen! His hide littered with the weapons of fallen warriors. His face scarred with one dead eye. I drew my sword and... Whoosh! One swipe, his sword shattered. Then ""chomp""! Dad's leg was clean off. Down the monster's throat it went. Oh, that's my favorite part. Mor'du has never been seen since, and is roaming the wilds waiting his chance of revenge.  Let him return. I'll finish what I guddled in the first place. Merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table. Mum! It's just my bow. A princess should not have weapons in my opinion. Leave her be. Princess or not, learning to fight is essential. Mum? You'll never guess what I did today. Hm? I climbed the Crone's Tooth, and drank from the Fire Falls. Fire Falls? They say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire.  What did you do, dear? Nothing, Mum. Hungry, aren't we? Mum! You'll get dreadful collywobbles. Oh, Fergus, will you look at your daughter's plate?  So what? Oh, you great... Don't let them lick...  Boys, you're naughty. Don't just play with your haggis. Urgh!  Och, how do you know you don't like it, if you won't try it? That's just a wee sheep's stomach. It's delicious. Mm!  My lady. Thank you, Maudie. You're getting too big, the two of you. Aha. From the Lords Macintosh, MacGuffin and Dingwall. Their responses, no doubt. Aye, aye! Hey, hey!   Stay out of my food, you greedy mongrels. Chew on that, you manky dogs!  Fergus? They've all accepted.  Who's accepted what, Mother? Boys, you are excused.  Oof!  Hey!  What did I do now? Your father has something to discuss with you. Fergus? Oh.   Er... Merida. The lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal. What? The clans have accepted. Dad! What? I... You... She... Elinor? Honestly, Merida, I don't know why you're reacting this way.  This year, each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand. I suppose a princess just does what she's told? A princess does not raise her voice. Merida, this is what you've been preparing for your whole life. No, it's what you've been preparing me for my whole life. I won't go through with it. You can't make me. Merida! Huh? Merida! Urgh!  Boys!  Mother. Suitors? Marriage? Once there was an ancient kingdom... Oh, Mum! Ancient kingdom. Its name long forgotten, ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved. And when he grew old he divided the kingdom among his four sons, that they should be the pillars on which the peace of the land rested. But the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself. He followed his own path and the kingdom fell to war, and chaos and ruin. That's a nice story. It's not just a story, Merida. Legends are lessons. They ring with truths. Och, Mum. I would advise you to make your peace with this. The clans are coming to present their suitors. It's not fair. Och, Merida. It's marriage. It's not the end of the world.   You're muttering. I don't mutter. Aye, you do. You mutter, lass, when something's troubling you. I blame you. Stubbornness. It's entirely from your side of the family.  I take it the talk didn't go too well, then? Och, I don't know what to do. Speak to her, dear. I do speak to her. She just doesn't listen. Come on, now. Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me. What would you say? Och... I can't do this. Sure you can. There, there. That's my queen. Right, here we go. ""I don't want to get married. ""I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind ""as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset.""  Merida, all this work, all the time spent preparing you, schooling you, giving you everything we never had. I ask you, what do you expect us to do? Call off the gathering. Would that kill them? You're the queen. You can just tell the lords the princess is not ready for this. In fact, she might not ever be ready for this, so that's that. Good day to you. We'll expect your declarations of war in the morning. I understand this must all seem unfair. Even I had reservations when I faced betrothal. But we can't just run away from who we are. I don't want my life to be over. I want my freedom! But are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost? I'm not doing any of this to hurt you. If you could just try to see what I do, I do out of love. But it's my life, it's...  I'm just not ready. I think you'd see, if you could just... I think I could make you understand if you would just... ...listen. ...listen.  I swear, Angus, this isn't going to happen. Not if I have any say in it.     MacGuffin! MacGuffin! Dingwall! Dingwall! Macintosh! Macintosh! Ooh! Aah! Oh.   You look absolutely beautiful. I can't breathe. Och, shush! Give us a turn. I can't move. It's too tight.  It's perfect.   Merida? Mum? Just... Remember to smile.    Aye, they're coming. Places, everyone. Places.   Oh!   I look fine, woman! Leave me be! My Lord! I want to announce the arrival of the lords... OW! Who goes there? Who goes there?  Boy!    So, here we are... Er... ...the four clans. Aye. Er... Gathering... Oh. ...for...  ...the presentation of the suitors. ...the presentation of the suitors.  Clan Macintosh. Macintosh! Your Majesty, I present my heir and scion, who defended our land from the northern invaders, and with his own sword, Stab Blooder, vanquished 1,000 foes. Macintosh!  Clan MacGuffin! MacGuffin! Good Majesty, I present my eldest son, who scuttled the Viking longships and with his bare hands vanquished 2,000 foes. MacGuffin! Clan Dingwall. Dingwall! I present my only son who was besieged by 10,000 Romans and he took out a whole armada singlehandedly. With one arm, he was... With one arm he was steering the ship and with the other he held his mighty sword and struck down a whole attacking fleet. Lies! What? I heard that.  Go on. Say it to my face. Or are ye scared, simpering jackanapes, afraid to muss your pretty hair? At least we have hair. And all our teeth.  Huh?  And we don't hide under bridges, you grumpy old troll.  You want to laugh, huh? Wee Dingwall! Get off me!      Nut 'em! Nut 'em! That's the way to... All right. Shut it!  Now, that's all done. You've had your go at each other. Show a little decorum. And no more fighting.      OW!    You want a fresh one?   Crivens, you're fierce. I didn't start it. It was... My lady Queen, I feel terrible. My humblest apologies. We mean no disrespect. I'm sorry, love, I didn't... But... Yes, dear.  Now, where were we? Ah, yes. In accordance with our laws, by the rights of our heritage, only the firstborn of each of the great leaders may be presented as champion. Firstborn? And thus compete for the hand of the Princess of Dun Broch. To win the fair maiden they must prove their worth by feats of strength or arms in the games. It is customary that the challenge be determined by the princess herself. Archery! Archery.  I choose archery. Let the games begin!      Pull! Pull!      I'll just take one. Ooh! Ooh! Oh! Now, I have told you, you're not allowed... Oh! Oh! Argh!  Oh!     It's time! Archers, to your marks! Aye, archers, to your marks. And may the lucky arrow find its target.   Oi! Get on with it. Ooh.   Och! I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers. Or holding up bridges.  Shh!  AW...  At least you hit the target, son.  Oh, that's attractive.  I got it! Good arm. And such lovely flowing locks. Fergus. What?   Oh, wee lamb. Oh, come on! Shoot, boy!   Well done, lad! Well done.  Feast your eyes!  That's my boy.   Well, that's just grand now, isn't it? Guess who's coming to dinner? Fergus. By the way, hope you don't mind being called Lady Ding...   I am Merida. Firstborn descendant of Clan Dun Broch. And I'll be shooting for my own hand. Oh!  What are you doing? Merida! Curse this dress!   Merida, stop this! Don't you dare loose another arrow.  Merida, I forbid it. Michty me! I've just about had enough of you, lass! You're the one that wants me to... You embarrassed them. You embarrassed me. I followed the rules. You don't know what you've done! Just don't care how I... It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right. Just listen! I am the Queen! You listen to me! Ugh! This is so unfair! Ha! Unfair? You're never there for me. This whole marriage is what you want. Do you ever bother to ask what I want? No. You walk around telling me what to do, what not to do, trying to make me be like you. Well, I'm not going to be like you. Oh, you're acting like a child. And you're a beast. That's what you are! Oh, Merida. I'll never be like you. No, stop that! I'd rather die than be like you!  Merida, you are a princess, and I expect you to act like one. Mum! Oh!  Merida! Merida! Oh, dear. Ah! Oh, no. What have I done? Oh.   Oh! Oh! Oh!  Whoa! Angus!     Come on, Angus.  Angus!        Why would the wisps lead me here?  Uh...  Oh, look around. You holler if you see anything you like. Everything is half off. Uh... Who are you? Just a humble woodcarver. Um... I don't understand...  See anything you like? Uh... Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber? But the willo'thewisps, they... Oh! This is one of a kind! I'll make you a deal for this rare prize. Your broom! Oh!  It was sweeping by itself. That's ridiculous. Wood cannot be imbued with magical properties. I should know. I'm a wit... Whittler. Of wood. Oh, how about this conversation starter? It's made of yew wood.  Tough as stone. Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah! That's stuffed.  Staring is rude. Ooh! The crow's talking! That's not all I can do. Lala lala lala     You're a witch! Woodcarver. That's why the wisps led me here. Woodcarver! You'll change my fate! Woodcarver! You see, it's my mother. I'm not a witch! Too many unsatisfied customers. If you're not going to buy anything, get out.  No! The wisps led me here! I don't care! Get out! Shoo! Get! Be gone with you! I'll buy it all. What? What was that? Every carving. Well...  And how are you going to pay for that, sweetie? With this. W... Oh, my, that's lovely, that is. That would set us up for months.  Ah, ah, ah.  Every carving and one spell.  Are you sure you know what you're doing? I want a spell to change my mum. That'll change my fate. Hmm... Done!  Where are you going?   There. What are you doing? You never conjure where you carve. Very important. The last time I did this was for a prince.   Easy on the eyes. Tight pants. He demanded I give him the strength of ten men. And he gave me this for a spell. A spell that would change his fate. And did he get what he was after? Yes. And made off with an especially attractive mahogany cheese board. Now, what do I need? Oh! Just a little bit of this.  Ah.  Hoo!  Teeteeteetee. Whoosh. That'll do.   Mimimimimimimi.   And now let's see. What have we here? Oh! Hey!  Uh, a cake? You don't want it? Yes! I want it. You're sure if I give this to my mum, it will change my fate? Oh.  Trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie. Expect delivery of your purchase within a fortnight. Ooh! Ooh... What was that thing about the spell? Did you say something about the spell? Mor'du, Mor'du, now the time has come for all of us to slaughter you  Hooray! Mor'du, Mor'du...   Merida. Mum! Ooh, uh... I, uh... Oh, I've been worried sick. You... You were? I didn't know where you'd gone or when you'd come back. I didn't know what to think. Oh, look at your dress. Oh. Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt. Well, you're home now, so that's the end of it. Honestly? I've pacified the lords for now. Your father's out there ""entertaining"" them.  Come taste my blade, you manky bear   For gobbling up my leg   I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you,   hang your noggin on a peg...   Of course, we both know a decision still has to be made. What's this? It's a peace offering. I made it. For you. Special. You made this for me? Mm. Oh. Interesting flavor. How do you feel? What... What is that? Different? Mm... Tart and, um, gamy. Have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that? Oh, that's better. Now, why don't we go upstairs to the lords and put this whole kerfuffle to rest? Hm?  Ooh. Mother? I'm woozy suddenly. My head's spinning like atop. Ooh! Mum! Oh, suddenly I'm not so well. Er... How... How do you feel about the marriage now? Merida! Oh, just take me to my room. All right, that's fine. That's just fine. A little to the left. That's good. A wee bit to the left. That's good. It's good enough. Now, clear out of there, boys. I don't want you to spoil my shot. What?  My lady Queen. We've been waiting patiently. Milords, I am out of sorts at the moment. But you shall have your answer.  Oh! Eh? Presently. Now, if you'll excuse us.  Elinor, look! It's Mor'du!  Elinor? Are you all right, dear? Fine. I'm fine. Go about avenging your leg. Oh... Aye. You heard her, lads. I dream about the perfect way to make this devil die.  Just take all the time you need to getting yourself right, Mum. Then maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage. What was in that cake? Cake.   Mum? So I'll just tell them the wedding's off, then?  Mum?     Bear!        Oh! Mum? You're... You're a bear!  Why a bear? Oh, that scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell. It's not my fault. I didn't ask her to change you into a bear. I just wanted her to change you.   Shh. Did you hear that?   Something's not right.  There's no point in having a go at me. The witch is to blame. Goggly old hag. Eyes all over the place. Unbelievable.  I'll get her to fix this.  Why do I always get blamed for everything? It's just not fair.  Everybody, follow me. And keep a sharp eye. Here we go. Another hunt through the castle. But we haven't had dessert yet.  I have no idea. Mum, you can't go out there. Mum! Wait! What are you doing? Dad. The Bear King? If he so much as sees you, you're dead. Another one of your entertainments to bore us to death! Oh, and what exactly are we after... Mum! ...my liege? Best to humor him. He is, after all, the King.  He's like a hound with that nose of his.  Mum, wait. We have to...   Follow me. Stop. Stop!  You're covered with fur. You're not naked. It's not like anyone's gonna see you.  Now you've done it.  Maudie!  Just calm down, lass. What is it?  Spit it out, Maudie! A bear! I knew it!   Would you just listen to me? We can't go this way. You'll be seen.  Quick! This way! Mum?   Mum? Oh!  Oh!  Hm? A witch turned Mum into a bear. It's not my fault. We've got to get out of the castle. I need your help. Oh, all right. You can have my desserts for two... Three weeks. Okay. Fine. A year. Did you hear that? Shh.   There it goes!   Come on, lads!    There it goes!   Come on, Mum.   Think we should lay a trap? Try shutting yours!   There he is!   I'm sure it went this way. You can see my house from here. It must have sprouted wings. Was carried away by a giant birdy. A dragon, perhaps. Bear in the castle! Doesn't make sense. It cannot open doors. He's got big giant paws! Let's just get inside.  It's locked. Dingwall was the last up. I propped it open with a stick.  What did you see, Maudie? Just spit it out, Maudie. Oh, for goodness' sakes, Maudie, would you get a grip?   Maudie, honey, come here! It's all right! Come on, Mum. Quick.  Shh.      They'll be fine. Won't you, boys?  Mum, we've got to hurry. Now, I'll be back soon. Go on and help yourself to anything you want, as a reward.  Oh!  Right! Where are these wisps? Come out, wisps. Come on out. Lead me to the witch's cottage. I'm here! Fine. Don't come out now that my mum's watching.  I was standing right here and the wisp appeared right there. Then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest. Oh, does she think we're just going to happen upon the witch's cottage?   Oh, Mum, I know this place. The witch's cottage... It's this way! Come on! Hurry! I can't believe it. I found it.  No. She was here. No, really, she was just here.  Oh, wait. No.  No, no. No! No!  Oh.     Welcome to the Crafty Carver,  home of bearthemed carvings and novelties.  I am completely out of stock at this time.  But if you'd like to enquire about portraits or wedding cake toppers,  pour vial one into the cauldron.  If you'd like the menu in Gaelic, vial two.  If you're that redhaired lass, vial three.  To speak with a live homunculus...  Princess, I'm off to the Wickerman Festival in Stornoway  and won't be back till spring.  There's one bit I forgot to tell you about the spell.  By the second sunrise, your spell will be permanent,   Unless you remember these words.  Fate be changed,  look inside,  mend the bond  torn by pride.  ""Fate be changed... Mend the bond."" What does that mean? One more time.  Fate be changed,  look inside,  mend the bond  torn by pride.  That's it. Tata.  Oh, and thank you for shopping at the Crafty Carver.  No. No! Where'd you go? Welcome to the Crafty Carver...  What? ...for all your...   Maybe there's a book of spells. Look around. We'll need more vials. I'm off to the Wickerman Festival in Stornoway...   Thank you for visiting. Have a lovely day.       We'll sort it out tomorrow.      Oh.  My brave wee lassie, I'm here. I'll always be right here.    Uh... Good morning.  So...  What's all this supposed to be?  Oh.  What?  Sorry. I don't speak bear.  Oh.  Ah!   Find those by the creek, did you? Mmhm. They're nightshade berries. Mmm. They're poisonous.  Where did you get this water? It has worms.    Come on.  Breakfast.  Oh, wait. A princess should not have weapons, in your opinion. Uhhuh...  There you go. Go on.  How do you know you don't like it if you won't try it?   Mm.       This love it is a distant star   Guiding us home wherever we are   This love it is a burning sun   Shining light on the things   that we've done   I tried to speak to you every day   But each word we spoke   the wind blew away   How did we let it come to this?   What we just tasted...    How will it feel when this day is done?   And can we keep   what we've only begun?    Could these walls   come crumbling down?   I want to feel my feet on the ground   Can we carry this love that we share   Into the open air   Into the open air  Hey! Where are you going?  This love it is a burning sun  Mum, come back.  Uh...  Oh...  Mum, is that you?  Uh... Mum?  You changed. Like you were a... I mean, like you were a bear on the inside.   A wisp. Mum!  Stop it! Mum, no!  Mum...   Jings, crivens, help ma boab. Mum, I know you're scared, you're tired, you don't understand, but we've got to keep our heads. Just calm down. Listen.    They'll show us the way.   Mum, look.   Why did the wisps bring us here?   Whoever they were, they've been gone for a long, long time.    I'm fine, Mum. Just fine. It's, uh, a throne room. You suppose this could've been the kingdom in that story you were telling me?  The one with the princes.  One, two, three, four. The oldest.  Split, like the tapestry.   The spell. It's happened before. ""Strength of ten men."" ""Fate be changed."" ""Changed his fate."" Oh, no. The prince became...  Mor'du.               Mum, we need to get back to the castle. If we don't hurry, you'll become like Mor'du. A bear! A real bear. Forever!  ""Mend the bond torn by pride."" The witch gave us the answer. The tapestry.  Mum, do you have a better idea?   That'll do.   No more talk. No more traditions. We settle this now! You're the King. You decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry. None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter. Then our alliance is over! This means war!  They're gonna murder each other. You've got to stop them before it's too late.  I know, I know! But how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry with the lot of them boiling over like that?  Oh!   What are you doing, lass? It's all right, Dad. I, um... I have...  Well, you see, I... I have been in conference with the Queen. Is that so? Aye, it is. Well, where is she, then? She, uh... How do we know that this isn't some trick? I'd never... This is highly irregular. What are you playing at? Where is the Queen? We will not stand for any more of this jiggerypokery. That's right. Let's see her. Shut it!    Well, I, uh... Uh... Once there was an ancient kingdom. What is this? That kingdom fell into war and chaos and ruin... Och, we've all heard that tale. Lost kingdom. Aye, but it's true. I know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom. Bah, it's just a legend. Legends are lessons. They ring with truths. Our kingdom is young. Our stories are not yet legend. But in them, our bond was struck. Our clans were once enemies. But when invaders threatened us from the sea, you joined together to defend our lands. You fought for each other. You risked everything for each other. Lord MacGuffin, my dad saved your life, stopping an arrow as you ran to Dingwall's aid. Aye, and I'll never forget it. And, Lord Macintosh, you saved my dad when you charged in on heavy horse and held off the advance. And we all know how Lord Dingwall broke the enemy line. With a mighty throw of his spear! I was aiming at you, you big tumshie.  The story of this kingdom is a powerful one. My dad rallied your forces and you made him your king. It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship and it lives to this day.  But I've been selfish. I tore a great rift in our kingdom. There's no one to blame but me. And I know now that I need to amend my mistake and mend our bond. And so, there is the matter of my betrothal. I've decided to do what's right and... ...and... ...and... ...break tradition.  My mother... ...the Queen, feels... ...uh, in her heart that I... ...that we be free to... ...write our own story... ...follow our hearts and find love in our own time. That's beautiful.  The Queen and I put the decision to you, my lords. Might our young people decide for themselves who they will love? Huh? Well, since you've obviously made up your minds about this, I have one thing to say. This is... A grand idea! Give us our own say in choosing our fate. What? Aye. Why shouldn't we choose? But she's the princess. I did not pick her out. It was your idea. And you... You feel the same way?  Good?   Well, that settles it. Let these lads try and win her heart before they win her hand. If they can. I say, the wee Dingwall has a fighting chance. Fine, then. Seems for once we agree. It was my idea in the first place.    Just like your mum. You devil.  Uh... Everyone to the cellar! Let's crack open the King's private reserve to celebrate!  Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Psst. Bring the tiny glasses.     Oh, the tapestry! Mend the bond... Mend the bond. Stitch it up. This'll change you back. We just need needle and thread.   Mum?  Mum? Not now. No. Please, not now.  Mum...   Shh.  Elinor, dear, you'll never guess who just solved our little suitor problem.   Elinor! It can't be true! Elinor, answer me, lass! Elinor! Merida.  What? Dad, no! It's not what you think. Merida, get back! No!   No, Dad! Don't hurt her! Get out of here!  Merida! No!   No!    Mum.   It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing. It's just a little scratch. Mum! My liege!  Fergus. Bear!   Dad! Count your stars, lass. It almost had you. Are you hurt? It's your wife, Elinor.   Close the gate! You're talking nonsense! It's the truth! There was a witch and she gave me a spell. It's not Mor'du. Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother! I'll not risk losing you, too. No, Dad! Just listen to me. Listen! You can't! It's your wife Elinor! Maudie, keep this and don't let her out. What about the bear? Just stay put.  Oh...     Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots! Yah! Mum! No. No. Mum.   Maudie. Maudie! I need you! Now! Oh, no. Maudie.  Get the key.   Yah!   Oh, Maudie!   Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Needle and thread.    There he goes! Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Ah, you beauty!      One, two... Huh?   Oh!     Steady, Hamish. There he goes.     We've got his track!   Back, back, back! Get him!  Angus! Easy, laddie.  Hubert, Harris, help Hamish.  Watch your blade! You're going to take somebody's arm off! Aye, we've got you now! Give me a hand over here! Put your back into it, Dingwall! I'm doing all the pulling here. Down you go, you scoundrel. Done!   Yah!      Hah!      Get back. That's my mother. Are you out of your mind, lass? Mum, are you hurt?      Merida!  I'll not let you kill my mother.  Boys!  Boys?   Mor'du! Kill it!    You scoundrel!   Come on! I'll take you with my bare hands!          Mum!           The second sunrise.     No... I don't understand. I...   Oh, Mum, I'm sorry. This is all my fault. I did this to you. To us.  You've always been there for me. You've never given up on me. I just want you back.  I want you back, Mummy. I love you.   Mum! You're back!  You changed! Oh, darling, we both have. Elinor! Oh, oh, oh!  Elinor! Oh! Ah! Er... Urgh! Oh, dear. You're back. She came back to us. It's a great day for this kingdom. The curse is broke. Oh! Mum. Ooh. Erm... Dear? Eh? I'm naked. Naked as a wee babby. Don't just stare at me. Do something! What the... Avert your eyes, lads! Show some respect!   Now that's when call a wee naked babby!   Merida, Elinor, hurry up. They're leaving. Mum! They're off! Come on! We've got to wave them off! Come along!   Though I may speak   some tongue of old   Or even spit out some holy word    I have no strength with which to speak  Oof!   When you sit me down   and see I'm weak   Goodbye! All the best! Fair wind to your sails!  We will run and scream   You will dance with me  But how did this...   There are those who say fate is something beyond our command,  that destiny is not our own.  But I know better.  Our fate lives within us.  You only have to be brave enough to see it.    We will run and scream   You will dance with me   We'll fulfill our dreams   and we'll be free   We will be who we are   And then heal our scars   Sadness will be far away   So I had done wrong   But you put me right   My judgment burned   in the black of night   When I give less than I take   It is my fault, my own mistake   We will run and scream   You will dance with me   We'll fulfill our dreams   and we'll be free   We will be who we are   And then heal our scars   Sadness will be far away     Delivery. Sign here, sign here.  Come on, birdbrain. I haven't got all day."
Cars 2,Disney,2010,2011,Animation,"This is Agent Leland Turbo.  I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile.  Finn, my cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pearshaped.  You won't believe what I found out here.  This is bigger than anything we've ever seen, and no one even knows it exists.  Finn, I need backup, but don't call the cavalry, it could blow the operation.  And be careful. It's not safe out here. Let's go.  Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.  All right, buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why? I'm looking for a car. A car? Ha! Hey, pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here. Exactly where I want to be. I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us. What are you doing out here? What does it look like, genius? I'm crabbing. Well, turn around and go back where you came from. Yeah, and who's gonna make me? All right. All right. Don't get your prop in a twist. What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks like it's the end of the line. Buddy? Incoming. All workers report to the loading dock.  Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile. I'm at the rally point. Over. All right, fellas, you know the drill. Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over. Come on, guys. These crates aren't gonna unload themselves. Too many cars here. Out of my way.  Professor ZÃ¼ndapp? Here it is, Professor. You wanted to see this before we load it? Yes. Very carefully. A TV camera. What does it actually do? This camera is extremely dangerous. What are you up to now, Professor? This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage. You got it. Hey, Professor Z!  This is one of those British spies we told you about. Yeah! This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong. Agent Leland Turbo. It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the camera! Kill him! All hands on deck! All hands on deck!  What? Get to the boats! He's getting away! Not for long! He's dead, Professor.  Wunderbar!  With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now? Mater, Tow Mater, that's who, is here to help you. Hey, Otis! Hey, Mater. I... Gosh. I'm so sorry. I thought I could make it this time, but... Smooth like pudding, huh? Who am I kidding? I'll always be a lemon. Well, dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, but look on the bright side. This is your tenth tow this month, so it's on the house. You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater. Don't sweat it. Shoot, these things happen to everybody. But you never leak oil. Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through. Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet? Not yet. He must be crazy excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup. Four! Wow! Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him, but I wish he'd hurry up and get back, 'cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and... McQueen! Whoa, whoa, whoa! McQueen! Mater! I'm in no hurry! Hey, everybody. McQueen's back! McQueen's back! McQueen's back! McQueen's back! McQueen's back! Lightning! Welcome home! Good to have you back, honey! Congratulations, man. Welcome home, soldier. The place wasn't the same without you, son. What? Did he go somewhere? It's good to be home, everybody. Mater! McQueen! Mater! McQueen! Hey, how far did you make it this time, Otis? Halfway to the county line. Not bad, man! I know! I can't believe it either! McQueen! Welcome back! Mater, it's so good to see you. You too, buddy. Man, you ain't going to believe the things I got planned for us! These best friend greetings get longer every year! You ready to have some serious fun? I've got something to show you first. Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson. I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know? Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure. All right, pal. I've been waiting all summer for this. What you got planned? You sure you can handle it? Do you know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen! I can handle anything. Mater? Just remember, your brakes ain't going to work on these! Mater? Relax. These train tracks ain't been used in years! Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go! Faster! Wow. Yeah, I don't know. Do you think? This is going to be good! Did you see that? This ain't going to be good. Boy, this was the best day ever! And my favorite souvenir, this new dent. Boy, Mater, today was... Shoot, that was nothing. Wait till you see what I got planned for tonight! Mater, Mater, whoa! I was thinking of just a quiet dinner. That's exactly what I was thinkin'. No, I meant with Sally, Mater. Even better! You, me and Miss Sally goin' out for supper. Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally. You know, just for tonight. We'll do whatever you want tomorrow. Okay. Thanks for understanding. Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have fun now. All right, then. See you soon, amigo. This is so nice. I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone, just the two of us, finally. You and me. Good evening. My name is Mater, and I'll be your waiter. Mater the waiter. That's funny right there. Mater? You work here? Yeah, I work here. What'd you think? I snuck in here when nobody was lookin' and pretended to be your waiter so I could hang out with you? Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that be? Can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple of drinks? Yes. I'll have my usual. You know what? I'll have that, too. Right. Your usual. Thanks, man. Grazie , Guido. Guido, what's McQueen's usual? How should I know? Perfect. Give me two of them. Quiet! My programme's on. Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...  His story gripped the world.  Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,  in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS,  ironically ran out of gas, and found himself trapped in the wild.  Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later,  running on a fuel he distilled himself from the natural elements!  Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,  converted himself from a gasguzzler into an electric car  and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, cleanburning fuel.  Now he claims to have done it with his allinol.  And to show the world what his new super fuel can do  he's created a racing competition like no other,  inviting the greatest champions  to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix.  Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod. Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here. Listen to me. Big oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse. I mean, it's a fossil fuel. ""Fossil,"" as in dead dinosaurs. And we all know what happened to them. Alternative energy is the future. Trust me, Mel. After seeing allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.  What happened to the dinosaurs, now? And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world, Francesco Bernoulli. It is an honor, Signore Dorado, for you. Why not invite Lightning McQueen? Of course we invited him,  but apparently after his very long racing season he is taking time off to rest. The Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco. I can go over 300 kilometers an hour. In miles, that is like... Way faster than McQueen. Let's go to the phones. Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air. Am I on? Hello?  You're on. Go ahead. Hello?  Go ahead. Let's go to Radiator Springs. You're on, caller. That Italian feller you got on there  can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen.  He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world. If he is, how you say,  ""The bestest race car,"" then why must he rest? Huh? 'Cause he knows what's important.  Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.  You heard it! Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow! This is not news to Francesco. When I want to go to sleep, I watch one of his races. After two laps, I am out cold.  That ain't what I meant. What's going on over there? He is afraid of Francesco.  That's that Italian formula car. His name is... Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder there's a crowd. Why do you know his name? And don't say it like that. It's three syllables, not 10. What? He's nice to look at. You know, openwheeled and all. What's wrong with fenders? I thought you liked my fenders. Let me tell you something else.  Mater? McQueen could drive circles around you.  Driving in circles is all he cana do, no? No.  I mean, yes. I mean, he could beat you anywhere. Any time, any track. Mel, can we move on? Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation, like a dump truck.  That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb. Hey! Whoa! Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen. The Lightning McQueen, huh? I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that.  McQueen, that was your best friend? This is the difference between you and Francesco. Francesco knows how good he is. He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it. Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile. Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile! Not so fast, McQueen! ""Not so fast."" Is that your new motto? Motto? This sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course. What do you say, Lightning McQueen? We've got room for one more racer. I would love to, but my crew is off for the season, so... Pit stop. You know what? They just got back. Deal me in, baby. Kachow! Yeah. I know, I know. I just got back, but we won't be long. No, don't worry about me. I've got enough to do here. Mater's going to have a blast, though. You're bringing Mater, right? You never bring him to any of your races. Just let him sit in the pits. Give him a headset. Come on, it will be the thrill of a lifetime for him. Your drink, sir. Mater. I didn't taste it! How'd you like to come and see the world with me? You mean it? Yeah. You got me into this thing. You're coming along. All right! Kachow! Hey! Excuse me! Domo arigato!  Yeah! Guido, look. Ferraris and tyres. Let's go! Look at this. Okay, now, Mater, remember, best behavior. You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that? Mater! Hey, McQueen! Over here. Lewis! Hey, man. Jeff! Hey, Lightning. Can you believe this party? Hey. You done good. You got all the leaves. Check out that tow truck. Man, I wonder who that guy's with. Will you guys excuse me just for one little second? Good job! Mater! Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs. You're just realizing that? That jet lag really done a number on you. Mater, things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different, too. Different than what? Well, just help me out here. You need help? Shoot! Why didn't you say so? That's what a tow truck does. Yeah, I mean... Looky there. It's Mr. San Francisco. I'll introduce you. Mater, no! Look at me. I'm helping you already. Hey, Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet... Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.  Nice to meet you, Francesco. Nice to meet you, too. You are very goodlooking. Not as good as I thought, but good. Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you? Anything for McQueen's friend. Miss Sally is going to flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend. She's a big fan of yours. Hey, she hasa good taste. Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a ""big fan"". You're right. She's a huge fan! She goes on and on about your open wheels. Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going on and on. Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that hasa nothing to hide. Yeah... Let us have a toast. Let's. I dedicate my win tomorrow to Miss Sally. Sorry. I already dedicated my win tomorrow to her. So, if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink. I'll go get you one. Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks? They're free. Free? Shoot, what am I doing here? I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race. Yes, you will see Francesco, but not like this. You will see him likea this as he drives away from you. That's cute. You had one of those made up for all the racers? No. Okay. Ciao, McQueen! He is so getting beat tomorrow! Ladies and gentlecars, Sir Miles Axlerod.  It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first ever World Grand Prix. From Brazil, Number 8... Hello. Hello. A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator. That's because it's aircooled. Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station. I have a message from London. Not here. Try the canapÃ©s on the mezzanine. The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent? What did they learn about the camera? It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time that would be great. This was London's message? No. No, sir. The oil platforms you were on, turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world. How did we miss that? They've scrambled everyone's satellites. The Americans discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation. Great. Who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet? Nope, not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready. Good, good. Oh, no. What is it? Change of plan. You're meeting the American. What? Me? Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me, the mission is compromised. No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics. I'm... I'm not a field agent. You are now. I'll take one of them. Thank you. Never know which one McQueen will have a hankering for. Hey. What you got here that's free? How about that pistachio ice cream? No, no, wasabi. Same old same old. What's up with you? That looks delicious! Little more, please. It is free, right? Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go. It's free. You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop. There ya go! Now that's a scoop of ice cream! My condolences. And now our last competitor. Number 95, Lightning McQueen! Kachow! Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity. The pleasure is all ours, Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition. Somebody get me water! Sweet relief. Sweet relief. Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has turned. Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is Mater. He's... I know him. This is the bloke that called in to the television show. You're the one I have to thank. No, thank you. This trip's been amazin'. He's a little excited, isn't he? Mater! But wait, I... Shoot. Mater. Has anyone got a towel? Mater, get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene! But I never leak oil. Never. Go take care of yourself right now! Comin' through! Leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I gotta go. Sorry, ladies. I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak. I never leak, I never leak, I never leak. I never leak. I never leak, I never leak, never... Wowwee! What in the... Hey, that tickles! Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's time for the drop. Okay, so, the American has activated his tracking beacon. Roger that. Move in. Stop! Hey! You've got to be joking. What's the problem? He's in the loo. So, go in!  I can't go into the men's loo! Time is of the essence.  All right. Whatever you do, I would not go in there! Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer! No offense to your makes and models, but you break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the altar! What the... Whoa. Are you okay? I'm fine. Hey! Tow truck! We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind. Yeah, sorry. Don't let me get in the way of your private business. A little advice. When you hear a giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button. Thank you. It's to adjust the temperature. Got it. And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit. Get out of here! All right, then. And when she starts gigglin', prepare to be squirted. 'Scuse me, ma'am. Dadgum pistachio ice cream. This cannot be him. Is he American?  Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin' to get funky. Extremely. Then it's him.  Hello. Well, hello. A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator. Well, of course it doesn't. That's 'cause it's aircooled. Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station. 'Course, Karmann Ghias weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3 Squarebacks with the Pancake motors. Yeah, okay. I get it. And before both of them there's the Type 2 buses. My buddy Fillmore's one of them. Listen! We should find somewhere more private. Gee, don't you think that's a little... You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again? Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races. Got it. We'll rendezvous then. There you are. Where have you been? What's a ""rendezvous""? It's like a date. A date? Mater, what's going on? What's going on is I got me a date tomorrow. Guido don't believe you. Believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady! See you tomorrow! Guido still don't believe you. I got to admit, you tricked us real good. And we don't like being tricked. What's so funny? Well, I was just wearing a disguise. You guys are stuck looking like that. Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear this stuff is good for you. So you think. Allinol by itself is good for you. But after microscopic examination I have found that it has one small weakness. When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous. Smile for the camera. Is that all you want? I got a whole act. You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform. Now, you will witness what it really does. Whatever you say, Professor. You talked up a lot of cars last night. Which one's your associate? Your mother. No, I'm sorry, it was your sister. I can't tell them apart these days. Could I start it now, Professor Z? Go 50% power. This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter. What about her? Did you give it to her? The allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber. How about him? Did you talk to him? What do I care? I can replace an engine block. You may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse, unfortunately, there will be nothing to replace. How about him? Does he have it? That's him. He's the one. Roger that, Professor Z. No! Yes, sir. We believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information. I will take care of it before any damage can be done. The project is still on schedule. You will find the second agent and kill him. Japan, land of the rising sun,  where ancient tradition meets modern technology.  Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix.  I'm Brent Mustangburger with racing legends Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap. There's never been a competition like this before. First, allinol, making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions. Second, the course itself. And it's like nothing we've ever seen before. David, how exactly does this competition work?  All three of these street courses are classic roundthehouse racetracks.  This means that the LMP and formula cars  should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion.  Look for Francesco Bernoulli, in particular, to lead early.  And with technical turns throughout, GT and touring cars,  like Spain's Miguel Camino, should make up ground  but I doubt it'll be enough to stop Francesco  from absolutely running away with it. Whoa now. Hold your horsepower. You forget the most important factor, that early dirt track section of the course. The dirt is supposed to be the equalizer in this race.  French rally car Raoul ÃaRoule  is counting on a big boost through there.  And don't forget Lightning McQueen.  His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,  was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time.  In my opinion, McQueen is the best allaround racer in this competition. Really, Darrell, you need to clean your windshield. You're clearly not seeing this for what it is: Francesco's race to lose. It's time to find out. The racers are locking into the grid.  Speed. I am speed. Really? You are speed? Then Francesco is triple speed. Francesco is triple speed. Francesco likesa this McQueen. It'sa really getting him into the zone. He is so getting beat today. Your suspension sets look good. Tyre pressure is excellent! He's got plenty of fuel. And he's awesome. Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed. It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune. But why hasn't he contacted us yet? There's probably heat on him. Be patient. Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can. Then we find out who's behind all this. As they head into the palace hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.  Hang on, boys. Here comes the dirt.  Slipping and sliding, baby.  McQueen, it's time to make your move! Get on the outside and show 'im what Doc taught you. 104, Mater. Oh, boy! Francesco's brought to a screeching halt!  Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage.  And just like that, folks, Francesco's lead is left in the dust.  Nice call, Mater. Keep it up. McQueen looks happier than a roll bar at a demolition derby!  Everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again.  Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt.  He's got serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race.  The racers hit the Rainbow Bridge, with its 360degree loop.  It is time.  Roger that. Miguel Camino has blown an engine!  Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so consistent all year.  You gotta be kidding me. What is it? The tow truck from the bathroom. The bathroom? The one the American agent passed the device to. What about him? He's in the pits! Not for long. Hold on. I think I've got something. What is it? The Pacer from the party last night. I'm crossreferencing with the photos from the oil derricks. Yep. His VIN numbers match. Anyone with him? He won't be alone. Conducting analysis on the target. He's not the only one here. Three, five... They're everywhere. And they're all closing in on... Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you? Get him out of the pits. Now!  Some of them fellers is really loud! Can you hear me? Over.  What? Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?  Hey. I know you! You're that girl from the party last night. You wanna do our date now? Guys, too much chatter. Let's keep this line clear. Smoke from number 10, Clutchgoneski!  There's no time for messing about! Get out of the pits!  Is there going to be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race? You're running out of time!  They're coming. Get him out of there! I'm trying. Get out now. I usually like to have a proper detailin' done before I meet a lady friend. Finn McMissile! But you're dead! Then this shouldn't hurt. Miss Shiftwell? I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly. Keep him moving. I'm on my way. Hey, new lady friend, you like flowers? What? No! Don't go in anywhere. Just keep moving. Stay outside. Got you. Outside? Whoa! McQueen suddenly moves to the outside.  I cannot believe what I saw.  That was a bonehead move to open up the inside like that!  That might have cost McQueen the victory!  This time, I'm going to make sure you stay dead! You're doing brilliantly. Now just stay focused.  What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus? No! Don't go down that street.  Wow! A live karate demonstration! Stop it, Mater. Just sign off. And here they come, the two leaders.  Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!  It's close! Francesco's the winner!  McQueen's number two.  That was cool! Can I get your autograph? Where did he go? Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe.  We'll be in touch.  Dadgum, did I miss our date? Francesco! Francesco, over here. What was your strategy today? Strategia?  Francesco needsa no strategy. It'sa very simple. You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win. Francesco alwaysa wins. It'sa boring. You were in trouble for a while. That dirt track section had you crawling. To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high. Mater! Hey, McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right? Why were you yelling at me while I was racing? Yelling? You thought... That's funny right there. No, that's 'cause I seen these two fellers doing some karate street performance. It was nutso. One of 'em even had a flamethrower. A flamethrower? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Where were you? Going to meet my date. Your date? She started talkin' to me as a voice in my head, tellin' me where to go. What? Wait a minute. I didn't screw ya up, did I? I lost the race because of you! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. An imaginary girlfriend? Flamethrowers? This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things. Maybe if I, I don't know, talk to somebody and explained what happened, I could help. I don't need your help! I don't want your help! Hey, there he is! McQueen, you had it in the bag! Yeah! What happened? I made a mistake. But I can assure you, it won't happen again. Look, we know what the problem is and we've taken care of it.  Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli  in the first race of the World Grand Prix.  And three, count 'em, three cars flamed out  leaving some to suggest that their fuel, allinol, might be to blame.  Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe. There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out. The jury may still be out on whether allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure, Lightning McQueen blew this race.  Team McQueen can't be happy right now.  Welcome to Tokyo International Airport.  Come with me, please, sir. But I'm 'onna miss my plane. Right this way. Doggone it. This is about my hook, ain't it? I know I should have checked it, but I can't, really. Look. It's attached to me. Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration. I never properly introduced myself. Finn McMissile. British Intelligence. Tow Mater. Average intelligence. Who are you with? FBI? CIA? Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated. I know some karate. I don't want to brag or nuttin', but I got me a black fan belt. Wanna see some moves I made up? You're being followed. This first one, I can reach into a car's hood pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. I call it, ""What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once."" There he is! Look, I probably ought to go. I'm about to miss my flight. Don't worry. I've taken care of that. Whoa! Hang on! This is firstclass service. You don't even have to go through the terminal! Your karate partners is back there. They look like they tryin' to catch up! Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop! Whoa! Whoa! Is everything okay back there? Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach. Roger that.  'Member that whole thing about me not stoppin' no matter what? I knew I shoulda done carryon! Thanks, old boy. You got it, mate. Hey, doggonit! Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend! Come on! Get in here! I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? That's a noquit attitude right there. What the... Hold on, Sid. Come on, Finn! It's now or never! Hold on! By the time you read this, I will be safely on an aeroplane flying home.  I'm so sorry for what I did.  ""I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. ""I want you to go prove to the world what I already know. ""That you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. ""Your best friend, Mater."" I didn't really want him to leave. Wait, there's more here. ""PS. Please tell the hotel ""I didn't mean to order that movie. ""I thought it was just a preview and I didn't realize I was paying for it. ""PPS. That's funny right there. PP."" There are a few more pages of PS's here. Well, at least I know if he's at home, he'll be safe. That's how I like to start the day. You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead. Yeah. I hope that device didn't fall off. Whoa! That's the closest I ever been to missin' my flight. That was... Still in one piece? Great. I've got to go to a doctor. I get these sharp pains in my undercarriage. Downloading the photo now. Let me introduce you two. This here is Finn McSomethin' or other. He's a firstclass VIP airport whatchamacallit. And, Finn, this here is my date. I never did get your name. Yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell. It's Shiftwell. Holley... Finally. Time to see who's behind all this. What is this? That's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminium V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches. Yes, okay, but whose engine is this? It's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it? But you took it. Holley. Right! Yes, of course. A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed. Agent? You mean, like, insurance agent? Like... Like a good neighbour, Mater is there!  Wait! You mean secret agents! You guys is spies! In how many makes and models did this type of engine appear? It was standard in seven models over a 12year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine. You're purty. Yes, thank you. And so nice. Just pay attention. This seems like a dead end. If there was something in the photo that could narrow this down, I'd be happier. You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by. Rare parts? That's something we can track. Exactly. Well done, Mater. I would never have seen that. I know of a blackmarket parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife, but he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. What would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one? Wait. What? You obviously have experience in the field. Yeah, I live right next to one. I don't know. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently. You're helping me. Please, Mater. Well... Okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right? Right. And I'm just in the importexport business. Siddeley? Yes, Finn? Paris. Tout de suite.  Yeah, two of them sweets for me, too, Sid. I always wanted to be a spy. Really? Me, too. Afterburners, sir? Is there any other way? Once we're inside, stay close. Don't bother checking VIN numbers. They're all dodgy here. Got it. Don't talk to anyone, don't look at anyone, and absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear? Yes. No idling. Yes, sir. Mater? Yeah, Finn? We're not here to go shopping. Shoppin'? What do you mean? Why would I... Dadgum. Part for sales, monsieur. Monsieur, part for sale. They got everything here. No! Look at them hoods! I could use a hood. Sorry, fellers. I gotta go! Do what? Excuse me. What are you selling? Headlights, monsieur, headlights? What in the... Two for one. I give you good price! I'm good! There you are. There is some great bargains here. Mater, get back! ImbÃ©cile!  Hey, wait for me! Have you lost your mind? But I thought... This chap needs a tow. Hook him up. Sure thing. You rusty piece of junk! Get your dirty hook off me! Electroshock! Are you kidding me? This is her first field assignment. She didn't know you were my informant. Informant? A rookie, huh? I never liked new car smell. Tomber was doing 20tolife in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly. Speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage, aren't you? All right, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So, here you go, informant. Inform us. That is the worst motor ever made. Wait. That oil filter. Those wheel bearings. Do those parts look familiar, Tomber? They should. I sold them. To whom? No idea. He's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone. I was always wondering why he needs so many parts. Now I know. A lemon needs parts. Ain't nothin' truer than that. Lemon? Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport. Pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out there. Right. Let's see. There were Hugos and Trunkovs. Are these cars considered lemons? Is the Popemobile Catholic? Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars. And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine. This explains it. What, Tomber? Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkov never get together, but they are having a secret meeting in two days. Where's this meeting taking place? Porto Corsa, Italy. That's where the next race is! There's a good chance our mystery engine will be there, too. Your chances are more than good. I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday. To Porto Corsa. Contact Stevenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good work. That threewheeled feller had to be right about a big meetin'. You never see this many lemons in one town. 'Less there's a swap meet. How'd you get all them pictures? I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans. Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car I ever met, but you're the smartest, too. Thank you... I think. That's a familiar sight. A Hugo bein' towed. But he looks absolutely perfect! Of course! They must be the heads of the lemon families. Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day, I'd hire me to tow me around all the time, too! We've got to infiltrate that meeting to find out who's behind all this. Hang on a minute. Hold still. Good job, Miss Shiftwell. Thank you, Finn. Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now. Guido, your eyes do not deceive you. We are in Italy. We are home. Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel, man? What? No friend of mine will stay in a hotel ina my village. You will stay with my... Uncle Topolino! Luigi! Guido! How do they do it? These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good. It's organic, man. Treehugger. Hey, race car. You look so down, so low. Is like you have flat tyres. She said you look like you are starving, that she's gonna make you a big meal and fatten you up. No. Mama Topolino, please, you don't need to make a fuss. Capisco. I understand. Is a problem, yes, between you and a friend? How did you know that? A wise car hears one word and understands two. That, and Luigi told me. While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me. I brought my friend Mater along on the trip and I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs. This Mater is a close friend? He's my best friend. Then why would you ask him to be someone else? What did I do? I said some things during our fight. You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything. They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari, which one of them looked more like a Ferrari. There were even some nonFerrari fights. So I tell them, ""Va bene,  it's okay to fight. ""Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends. ""But you got to make up fast. ""No fight more important than friendship."" What does that mean? Whoever find a friend, find a treasure. Now, mangia. Eat! Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa. Thank you, Stevenson. That should just about do it. Perfect. So, Mater, it's voiceactivated. But everything's voiceactivated these days. What? I thought you was supposed to be makin' me a disguise. Voice recognized. Disguise program initiated.  Cool! Computer, make me a German truck. Request acknowledged.  Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen. Make me a monster truck! Request acknowledged.  What the... I vant to siphon your gas! Now make me a taco truck! Request acknowledged.  A funny car! Request acknowledged.  The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater. So I just go in, pretend to be this truck. And leave the rest to us. Now, hold still. I have to do the final fitting on your disguise. That's no good. Hey. What are you doin'? The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto. For a second there, I thought you was tryin' to fix my dents. Yes, I was. Then, no, thank you. I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. They way too valuable. Your dents are valuable? Really? I come by each one of 'em with my best friend, Lightning McQueen. I don't fix these. I wanna remember these dents forever. So, you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your cover. Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater. But my line of work is towin' and salvage. Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps. No, I meant for real. It's okay. I'll work around the dent. In the meantime, you look a little light on weapons. You are looking live at beautiful  Porto Corsa, Italy, on the Italian Riviera.  What a magnificent setting for the second race of the World Grand Prix!  Brent, they call this place the ""Gem of the Riviera,""  and it's easy to see why.  With its secluded beaches and opulent casinos,  Porto Corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy.  And everyone who's anyone is here today,  from the ultrarich and superfamous  to world leaders and important dignitaries.  You aren't kidding, David.  You can't do a threepoint turn without bumping into some celebrity.  Welcome, everyone, to the second race of the World Grand Prix, where the big news continues to be allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety. An independent panel of scientists has determined that allinol is completely safe, okay? Safe. There it is. So the race will go on, folks. But the question everyone is asking: will the real Lightning McQueen show up today?  He'd better. Talk about a home track advantage.  Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course.  Signore e signori, in the pole position,  Numero Uno, Francesco!  Bellissima!  Thank you for your support! And your big mistake, McQueen! In secondo position,  numero 95, Lightninga McQueena!  McQueena, isa everything okay? If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't. It's perfectly safe. No, guys, I just really wish Mater were here. Francesco understands, McQueen. Great, here it comes. What do you got, Francesco? For famous race cars like Francesco and, well, you, to be far away from home is not easy. I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult. Isa no insult. Whena Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama, just likea you miss your tow truck amico. Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly... Of course, I am at home, and my mama is right here. Mama! Don't worry, Mama, McQueen is very sad. I will beat his crybaby bottom today! And there's the insult we were missing. Darrell, the racers are settling in as they head  to the Italian countryside.  Boy!  This is going to be a great race.  Gremlins. Man, those are some ugly cars. Look like someone stole their trunks. My granda father hasa broken down. Ifa one ofa you would help, I would be so thankful. Sounds like you need some roadside assistance. She was talking to me. Really? Prove it. Don'ta fight over me. Signore Tow Truck, per favore.  Get ready, Mater. You're on any moment now. I don't know about this. What if I screw things up? Impossible.  Just apply the same level of dedication  you've been using to play the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.  It's just that them guys look purty tough and... Wait, did you say ""idiot""? Is that how you see me? That's how everyone sees you.  Isn't that the idea?  I tell you, that's the genius of it.  No one realizes they're being fooled  because they're too busy laughing at the fool.  Brilliant!  Why aren't you in disguise? I... Come on! There's no time! Go! Okay. Okay. Computer, disguise! Request acknowledged.  It's the boss. He's coming. Ivan. Ivan, why do you insult me so by making me wait here? He's in. The racers are now making their way around the hairpin  and headed downhill toward the casino bridge.  No more bets, please. Come on, fuzzy dice! Number four. Easy four. Yeah! Air freshener. Antenna balls. Sparka plugs. This place looks like it's made outta gold! That's because it is. Now, be careful what you say.  Why is that? What do you mean, ""Don't talk to ya""? You want me to stop talkin' to ya right now? You are acting strange today, Ivan. I have no idea what you're talking about, ""Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex."" You got a lot of aka's, Alex. But that makes sense, seein's how you's wanted in France, Germany... Mater, stop it! Okay, okay, keep your voice down! You gonna make me arrested! Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in a bad mood. He's so good! Victor! Hey, Victor! There you are! Come in! Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin. From Detroit. It's good to see you. Is the big boss here yet? No, not yet. He's supposed to be here any minute. Here we go. Guten Tag.  It's just the professor. ZÃ¼ndapp! When is he coming? He's already here. Welcome, everyone.  I wish I could be with you on this very special day,  but my clutch assembly broke.  You know how it is.  Forget about it. We know how you feel. Descramble that voice. I'm trying. It's too sophisticated. We are here to celebrate.  Today, all your hard work pays off.  The world turned their backs on cars like us.  They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts.  The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us.  They've called us terrible names: jalopy, rust bucket, heap,  clunker, junker, beater, wreck, rattletrap,  lemon.  But their insults just give us strength.  Because today, my friends, that all ends!  There's smoke on the casino bridge!  Oh, no! It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car! What just happened? I'm working on it. They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back.  Another crash! It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.  Embrace your inner lemon.  Let it drive you.  I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse. Finn, it's the camera. Where? On the tower! This was meant to be alternative fuel's greatest moment.  But after today, everyone will race back to gasoline.  And we, the owners of the world's largest untapped oil reserve  will become the most powerful cars in the world!  Get out of the way! They will come to us, and they will have no choice,  because they will need us.  We figured you might stop by! And they will finally respect us!  So hold your hoods high!  After today, you will never again be ashamed of who you are!  No! Long live lemons!  Number 7 is loose! Shu Todoroki!  Finn? Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!  McQueen's the winner! Francesco's second!  They have no idea what happened behind them.  This is impossible! That's what I'm talking about! Kachow! What happened? Where are all the other cars? What is going on? Oh, no! Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London still going to take place?  I suppose that...  The show must go on, as they say.  I can't believe this is really happening! Quiet! Will you require all the racers to still run on allinol?  I cannot, in good conscience, continue to risk the lives of any more race cars.  The final race will not be run on allinol.  There you have it, a clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod  announcing that he will not require the cars to use allinol for the final race.  A toast! To the death of allinol and alternative fuel forever! Mater, abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now. How is your grandfather? Long live lemons! Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh? Yeah, it's unbelievable. You are not leaving, are you? Of course I ain't leaving. I'm just in shock...  McQueen? Crashes are a part of racing, I know,  but something like that should never happen.  You can choose your fuel for the final race. What it'll be?  Allinol.  After today?  My friend Fillmore says it's safe. That's good enough for me.  I didn't standby a friend of mine recently.  I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.  So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen.  He will use allinol in the final race, despite what occurred today.  ...till Lightning McQueen is dead.  Of course. Allinol must be finished for good. McQueen cannot win the last race. Lightning McQueen must be killed! No! It's the American spy! Dadgum! Gatling gun. Request acknowledged.  Down! Everybody, down! Shoot! I didn't mean... Request acknowledged.  Wait! Wait! I didn't mean that kind of shoot! Correction acknowledged. Deploying chute.  Whoa! McQueen! Whoa! What's this? Whoa! McQueen! McQueen! Let me through! Let me through! Let me in! I got to get through to warn McQueen! You cannota come through here! Back up. We have a lunatic at gate 9. I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting and my weapons system's done misinterperated what I'm saying! Lunatic at gate 9. McQueen! McQueen! You are the champion! This way, signore. McQueen! Mater? McQueen. Give us a pose! McQueen! Stop moving. Stop! Where you going? Stop! McQueen! That really sounded like... Mater! Mater? Signore?  McQueen! They're gonna kill you! Mater! Excuse me. No, where are you going? Scusi. Mater! McQueen! Scusi. Mater! Mater! Mater, I'm so glad to see you. Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan. I'm sorry, I thought I heard... That was me. I said, ""You killed out there today. You're the best."" What? I mean, thanks. Right this way, signore. I really thought I heard my friend. In England, you'll be finished! At the finish line. Wait, what? The press is waiting. Comea with me, please. Let me go! You actually care about that race car. A pity you didn't warn him in time. ""Idiot""? Is that how you see me?  That's how everyone sees you. I tell you, that's the genius of it.  No one realizes they're being fooled  because they're too busy laughing at the fool.  At the fool...  Excuse me! Domo arigato!  Yeah! You done good. You got all the leaves. Check out that tow truck. I wonder who that guy's with. Will you guys excuse me just for one little second? Now that's a scoop of ice cream! Somebody get me water! Sweet relief. Mater! But I never leak oil. Never. Get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene! Wait a minute. I didn't screw ya up, did I? I lost the race because of you! Maybe if I talk to somebody... I don't need your help! I don't want your help. Your help... Bang the gong. Get it on! Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.  This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things! Holley! Finn! Where are we? We're in London, Mater, inside Big Bentley. This... This is all my fault. Don't be a fool, Mater. But I am, remember? You said so. When did I... Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are. I'm not a spy! I've been trying to tell you that the whole time. I really am just a tow truck. Finn, he's not joking. I know. You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is 'cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault. Good. You're up. And just in time. Professor Z wanted you to have a frontrow seat, for the death of Lightning McQueen. He's still alive? Not for much longer. We came as soon as you called. I called to talk to Mater. It never occurred to me he wouldn't be there. Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now. And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military. You just need to focus on the race. I know but, Sally with everything going on, I'm not sure... Sir Axlerod. I'm sorry to interrupt. It's all right. I just wanted to personally thank you. Because after Italy, I was finished, and then you gave me one last shot. Listen... I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I hope you win today. You show the world that they've been wrong about allinol. Mater would want you to race. All right. For Mater. Here he comes. What happened?  I don't know, Professor. What did you do? I didn't do nothing. I'm talking to the Professor. What's that, Professor? You broke it! Quiet! I understand, sir. Yes. What did he say? We go to the backup plan. Backup plan? We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit. The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying ""kachow"" he's going to go ""kaboom""! Don't feel bad, tow truck. You couldn't have saved him. Wait, you could have! Dadgum lemons! Request acknowledged.  What? You didn't think we'd take your bullets? That's right! You got nothing! Who's the lemon now, huh? Nice try, Mater. Dadgum... Dadgum... Dadgum. Request... Request... Request...  Mater! I got to get y'all out of there. There's no time. McQueen needs your help. But I can't. I'm just a tow truck. It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out. You can do that. What about you guys? We'll be okay. Go and get some more dents, Mater. So, we'll be okay? Really? He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth. Being killed by a clock. Gives a whole new meaning to ""Your time has come."" Time? That's it! What are you doing? Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity. Good job. Quick thinking, Holley. What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for? No! Drive! Burn rubber! We've got to get to the course. Calculate the fastest way to... Done. Miss Shiftwell. They're standard issue now. You kids get all the good hardware. No, that's Mater's. I knew his escape was too easy. Come back here! Stop! Mater? Everybody, get out now! Y'all get out of the pits. What are you guys doing here? We're here because of you, Mater. Is everything okay? No, everything's not okay. There's a bomb in here. Y'all got to get out. Now. A bomb? Mater. Finn! You're okay. Listen to me. The bomb is on you! They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out, they planted it in your air filter.  Mater! There you are! Stop right there! I've been so worried about you. Don't come any closer! Are you okay? No, I'm not okay! Stay away from me! No, wait! Wait! A tow truck has just raced onto the track, driving backwards!  Mater, wait! Normally an emergency vehicle on the track means there's been an accident. Lightning McQueen is chasing him!  Mater, wait! Stay back! If you get close to me, you're going to get hurt real bad! I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters! We're best friends! And McQueen seems to be having  a conversation with the tow truck.  I don't know who that truck is, Brent, but tell you what,  he's got to be the world's best backwards driver.  McQueen, you don't get it! I'm the bomb! Yes, Mater! You are the bomb! That's what I'm trying to say here! You've always been the bomb and you'll always be the bomb. Stay away! No! Never! Almost there. I'm not letting you get away again! Got to keep away from McQueen! Request acknowledged.  Oh, my gosh. What is happening? It's a bad dream! And Lightning McQueen just blasted away,  hooked to the now rocketpropelled tow truck.  The Professor's on the run! Someone's got to get McQueen. Get McQueen! Holley, I'll get ZÃ¼ndapp. Help Mater. Got it! What is happening? Hurry, Professor. You really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor? McQueen, let go! Never! They're coming your way. Let's go! Give it up, McMissile. Mater, stop! No way! You could get hurt. Oh, no. Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you. Bomb? Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a backup plan. Backup plan? Mater, who put a bomb on you? You! Why didn't my death ray kill you? Death ray? Turn off the bomb, ZÃ¼ndapp! Are you all so dense? It's voiceactivated. Everything is voiceactivated these days. Deactivate! Deactivate! Voice denied.  Did I forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it? Say it. Deactivate. Voice denied.  I'm not the one who activated it. Would anyone else like to try? You read my mind. He was getting on my nerves. What do we do? It's very simple. You blow up. I'm going out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct? It's nothing personal. Fellers, listen. I know what you're going through. Everybody's been laughing at me too. But becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better. Yeah, but it's worth a shot. Pit stop. Not today, boys. Retreat! Thanks for the help, Corporal. Anything for one of Pop's mates. What's he saying? What's wrong? None of his wrenches fit the bolts. I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done. Then do it! What? No. I can't do it. Nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs. Yes, it is. Look, you're yourself in Radiator Springs. Be yourself here. And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change, not you. I know that because I was wrong before. Now, you can do this. You're the bomb. Thanks, buddy. No, you're the actual bomb. Now, let's go! Right. Hang on! Where's he going? Computer! Yes, Agent Mater?  I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen! Request acknowledged.  Mater? Now I need you to do the chute! The second kind, not the first! Deploying chute.  Who's winning the race? Back off! Back away! It's Lightning McQueen! No, it's okay! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain. Okay. Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurtin' the cars, and I know who. Wait. Your Majesty. Bomb! It's a bomb! Everybody, down! Back up! Move it! Get off the stage! Move it! Hold your fire! He can't disarm it! Mater, I don't know what you're doing, but stand down now. This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs. Mater, just cut to the chase. Okay. It's him. What? Me? You've got to be crazy. I figured it out when I realized y'all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts, the same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph. Holley! Show that picture. Okay. I remembered what they say about old British engines: if there ain't no oil under 'em, there ain't no oil in 'em. What is he talking about? It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan. You just blamed it on me. Electric cars don't use oil, you twit. Then you're fakin' it. You didn't convert to no electric. If we pop that hood, we'll see that engine from that picture. This lorry's crazy! He's going to kill us all! Stay away! But Sir Axlerod created the race. Why would he want to hurt anyone? To make allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. He said it himself with that disguised voice. Disguised voice? What are you talking about? You're nuts, you are! This is going nowhere fast. We really should go, Grandmother. One moment, I'd like to see where this is going. Mater, he created allinol. But what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else? What if he came up with allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad? ""What if?"" You're basing this on a ""what if""? Okay, that's it. Lads, clear out. Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's crazy! Keep away, you idiot! Mater! Mater! Someone do something! You're insane, you are! Deactivate! Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.  The engine from the photo. It's a perfect match. How did the tow truck figure it out? It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on. Now you're talkin'! Mater, let's go. You're on. Your Majesty, may I present for the investiture of honorary knighthood of the British Realm, Tow Mater of Radiator Springs. Go get 'em, buddy. I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater. Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this ""sir"" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen, McMissile. McMissile, McQueen. Queen, McMissile. So there we was, my rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowheres, guns drawed. We was goners. But then, out of nowhere this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us! That's a very entertaining story, young man. Minny, please. Come on! None of this happened. Rocket jets, flying spy cars. No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit farfetched. Holley! What are you doin' here? Hello, Mater! It's so good to see you again. Finn! Our satellites picked up an urgent communiquÃ©. So you gota my email. Y'all is going to have a great time! Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent. Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's... I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all. Guido believe you now. Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent there. Yeah. Was that from when you swooped in and you saved them in London? Van! What? I'm just asking! Don't you worry. My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time. Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Let me go get my tools. No. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable. A valuable dent? She's as crazy as Mater. Those two are perfect for each other. There's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So, why didn't I... Explode in a fiery inferno? Yeah. We couldn't figure that out, either. Our investigation proved that allinol was actually gasoline and Axlerod engineered it so when it got hit by the beam, it would explode. Wait a second, Fillmore. You said my fuel was safe! If you're implying that I switched that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my allnatural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man! It was him! Once big oil, always big oil, man. Treehugger. The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin. All spectators, clear the starting line. I can't wait to get rockin'. This is gonna be wicked! We should do this every year. Yeah, I just figured we never found out who the world's fastest car is. Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing. The way I like it. Francesco likes it like this, too. Francesco, I'd like you to meet... Signorina Sally. It is official. Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world. Why, thank you. Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today! See you at the finish line, Mc... What is that? Just something I had made up for the occasion. Isa good, McQueen. Very funny. Wasa funnier when I did it, but it'sa very funny. What are you going to do next? Are you going to take off your fenders? Try it. You'll like it. So, he's not so goodlooking. Yeah. Nice try. I'm serious! That's why I love you, Sally. Wish me luck! You don't need it! That Francesco is finelooking! And those open wheels. I'm gonna have to go get myself some coolant. Go, Lightning! Go, Stickers! Right on, man! Go get 'em, tiger! Bravo, bravo! Go, Lightning, go! Go, McQueen! Finn? Time to go. Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly. You're leavin' already? We've got another mission. Just stopped by here to pick something up. Somethin' tells me you're not talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers. Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater. But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy. We know. Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met. Don't forget massively charming. Well, thanks. But as much fun as it was hangin' with y'all, this... This is home. That's all right. We understand. But I'll be back. You still owe me that first date. If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know. Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you. Actually, there is one thing. I'll be doggone! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Thanks, Mater! Impossible! Mater! Check it out. They let me keep the rockets. I'll see you at the finish line, buddy! Not if I see you first! Yippee!"
Cars 3,Disney,2010,2017,Animation," Okay, here we go.  Focus. Speed. I am speed.   One winner, 42 losers. I eat losers for breakfast.  Did I used to say that?  Yes, sir, you did.  You used to say that all the time. Mater, what are you doing in here? Well, I didn't want you to be lonely. Thank you. But I'm kind of preparing for a race. I need a little quiet. Oh, right. You got it, buddy. Hey, everybody, listen up. My best friend, Lightning McQueen, needs quiet. Perfect quiet!  Okay. Where was I?  Racing. Real racing.  That ain't racing. That wasn't even a Sunday drive. That was one lap. Racing is 500 of those. Everybody fighting to move up. Lap after lap. Inside, outside, inches apart. Never touching. Now that's racing. Well, I can't argue with The Doc Hudson. How true, how true.    Hey, Lightning, you ready? Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.  This one's for you, Doc.  Whoohoo! Come on, Stickers. Pardon me. Excuse me. Best friend coming through. Go, McQueen! Whoohoo! Pass him now, 24! Lightning McQueen!  Go, 95!  Whoohoo! Hey, Cal, your blinker's on. What? No, it's not. Hey! Your blinker's on. Good comeback, Cal.  Because I want to run that race   I want to run that race   I do it at my pace   Long as I get to run that race  Into the pit goes Lightning McQueen,  Bobby Swift and Cal Weathers.  These three are fun to watch, aren't they, Darrell? You know, Bob, I can't tell if they have more fun on or off the track.  Finito! Mmm. You getting a car wash too, Cal? No, you're getting a car wash, McQueen. Good comeback, Cal.  We gotta run that race   We gotta run that race   We do it at our pace   Long as we get to run that race Hey, hey, hey, hey  Lightning, how do you keep your focus racing against Bobby and Cal? I think the key is we respect each other. These guys are real class acts...  Congratulations, cupcake. Oh, they are gonna pay.  Go, Dinoco! Great win today, Cal. Thank you, Shannon. It was a great boost and I was... Hey! Hey! Guido!  Pit stop. Ha, ha. Laugh it up. Real funny.    Keep it going, buddy! Whoo! Hey! Are my sponsors happy today? Stop winning for crying out loud. We're running out of bumper cream to sell.  Lightning McQueen! Hey, Big Tex. How's my favorite competitor? Just say the word and... I'll boot Cal off the Dinoco team and replace him with you. You know I can hear you, right? I'm right here. Bye, Cal. See you next week. Or not. Oh, come on now. I'm joking. Go, little buddy! Whoohoo! And big buddy too!  Another great finish in the making.  McQueen and Swift nose to nose.  How's the view back there, Bobby? Well, you better not blink. I'll blow right past you. The flag is out.  It's the final stretch. McQueen in the lead.  Okay, let's see what you got. Whoowhee!  Holy cow!  Whoa!  It's Jackson Storm for the win. A huge upset!  Neither Lightning nor Bobby ever saw him coming.  It's one thing to start fast,  but we haven't seen anyone cross the line...  with that kind of speed and power since a young...  Lightning McQueen first arrived on the scene.  Hey, Bobby? Who is that? That's, um, Jackson Storm. Yeah. He's one of the rookies.  Huh.  Thank you, guys. Thank you. No, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Hey. Jackson Storm, right? Great race today. Wow! Thank you, Mr. McQueen. You have no idea what a pleasure it is for me to finally beat you. Oh, thanks. Wait.  Hang on. Did you say ""meet"" or ""beat""? I think you heard me. Uh, what? Storm, can we get some pictures? Yeah, yeah. Come on. Let's get a picture. You know what? Get a ton of pictures because champ here has been a role model of mine... for years now. And I mean a lot of years. Right? I love this guy. Storm, give us a quote. What's your top speed? I think I touched a nerve.  Welcome back to Chick's Picks with Chick Hicks. I'm your host, former and forever, Piston Cup champion, Chick Hicks. Doodoodoodoo. This just in... Rookie Jackson Storm slams the proverbial door on Lightning McQueen. Oh. I couldn't have enjoyed it more if I'd beaten McQueen myself. Oh, wait, I have.  But enough about me. Here to tell you how it happened is professional number cruncher, Miss Natalie Certain. It's a pleasure to be here, Chick. And actually, I prefer the term ""Statistical Analyst"". Right. So, who is this mysterious newcomer, Jackson Storm? And why is he so darn fast? It's no mystery if you study the data, Mr. Hicks. Jackson Storm is part of the next generation of hightech racers. Unlike the veterans of yesterday... What? Oldtimers like this guy?  Um... Right. Storm achieves his top speeds by exploiting the numbers. I refer, of course, to racing data. Tire pressure, downforce, weight distribution, aerodynamics, and... nextgens like Storm are taking advantage. The racing world is changing. And for the better if it means my old pal, Lightning, is down for the count. Am I right, Certain? Well, if I'm certain of anything, Chick... it's that this season is about to get even more interesting. I'll tell you what, Darrell,  Jackson Storm has certainly made an impact.  We've got six more nextgeneration rookies in the field.  With six veterans fired to clear the way.  Morning, champ. How's our living legend today? Uh... Still very much alive, thank you. And I would appreciate... You know, I can't believe I get to race the Lightning McQueen.  In his farewell season. What are you talking about? Oh, green flag. Good luck out there, champ. You're gonna need it.  One reason Storm and the nextgens are more efficient:  Their ability to hold the optimum racing line every single lap. Win number three for the rookie sensation.  Storm's in a class of his own.  And a big reason for that: Training on the newest cuttingedge simulators.  These machines create a...  virtual racing experience so real racers never even have to go outside.  Storm's ability to hold that line  is like nothing we've ever seen.  Four in a row? Are you kidding me?  2% lower drag coefficient.  Oh, what a finish!  5% increase downforce.  Lucky number seven.  1 .2% higher top speed. Amazing! Nine!  Piston Cup winner, Chick Hicks here  with the racer taking the circuit... by storm. Jackson Storm.  Another easy win over old ""Kachow"". Or should I say, ""Caboose""?  Because he's always in the back. Am I right?  No, no, no, Chick. McQueen is a crafty veteran champ.  He's the elder statesman of the sport. You know?  Takes everything I got to beat him.  You got to be kidding me.  What changes are you gonna make to get McQueen back on top? Will McQueen try new training methods? Is he prepared to retire? Come on, guys. Let's not overreact. It's just a slump. We'll get 'em next week. Okay, that's enough. No comment. Not even about Weathers retiring? Wait. What? Cal Weathers. He's hanging up his Lightyears. No. No comment on that either. Wait a minute. Please, come on. You got to give us something. Hey, Cal! Hey. Retirement? What's going on?  You know, I asked my uncle once how I'd know when it was time to stop. You know what he said? The youngsters will tell you. We had some good times together. I'm gonna miss that the most I think. Yeah. More changes ahead, Chick.  Every week we've seen veteran racers either retire... like Cal Weathers tonight, or fired to make room for these younger... faster racers. And, it's not over yet. Hello racing fans.  Welcome to the Los Angeles 500.  The final race of the Piston Cup season.  It's been a year of surprises...  They can't do this. I've raced for you guys almost 10 years. Sorry, Brick. My mind's made up. I'm giving your number to someone new. Hey, I had two wins last year! The whole sport's changing. I'm just doing what I got to do. Hey, do you know what's happening with Brick... Oh! Wait, you're not Bobby.  The name's Danny, bro. Hey, champ, where'd all your friends go? A final check of his tires as Storm settles into the pole position.  Boogity, boogity, boogity. Let's end this season with a great race.   That's it, buddy! Forty laps to go and race leader, Jackson Storm...  is making his way onto pit road with McQueen on his tail.  A good stop here could mean the difference between victory and defeat.  Come on, come on. Come on! Faster, Guido, come on. I got to get back out there before he does. Guido, hurry up!    What a pit stop by McQueen!  Man, he just got the lead!  But can he hold on to it?   Hey, McQueen, are you all right? Listen, don't you worry, pal. You had a good run. Enjoy your retirement! Storm takes back the lead!  Unbelievable! McQueen is fading!  McQueen is fading! Fading fast!  No. No! No! No! No!        WHIZ  Welcome back to Piston Cup Talk.  Around the clock where we do nothing but talk racing. Let's get to it.  Starting of course  with Lightning McQueen.   With the season just two weeks away, there's still no official announcement.  But with number 95 coming off his worst year on record...  Don't shoot the messenger here, folks. I think it's safe to assume...  that Lightning McQueen's racing days are over.  Meanwhile, Jackson Storm is looking even faster...     For the checkered flag.  As they enter the final lap, the number 6 and number 12 cars...  are still fighting it out for the lead. But wait! Here he comes!  It's the Fabulous Hudson Hornet knocking at their door.  What's he got up his sleeve today? And there it is!  With one move, he's past them.  The Hornet takes a decisive lead.  He's left the pack behind. His crew chief, Smokey, is loving it!  It's unbelievable! Oh, no! He's in trouble!  The Hudson Hornet has lost control!    What should have been a scene of jubilation  has turned tragic, folks.   As we await news on the Hudson Hornet's condition.  After such a devastating crash...  we can only hope that this race today wasn't his last.   When I finally got put together,  I went back expecting a big welcome.  You know what they said? You're history. Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line. There was a lot left in me I never got a chance to show.  Hey, Stickers. Hey, Sal. How you feeling? Yeah, great.  Really, really great. Been thinking about Doc again?  Yeah. You know they told him when he was done. He didn't decide. I don't want what happened to Doc to happen to me. But that hasn't happened. No, but I can't go out on the track and do the same old thing. It won't work. Then change it up! Try something new. I don't know, Sally. I... Don't fear failure. Be afraid of not having the chance. You have the chance. Doc didn't. And you can either take it or you can do what you been doing. Sitting. In here. For months. And by the way, I love what you've done with the place. I mean the monster movie lighting and the musky air freshener. Don't let anyone tell you you're not working that primer because... Wow, I have never found you more attractive. And now that I've been in here for a couple minutes, the stench... I'm getting kind of used to it. Okay, Sal. I get it. I get it. I miss you, Lightning. We all do.  Try something new, huh? Hey, did it work, Miss Sally? Did you set him straight with your lawyerly powers of persuasion? Is he ready to start training? Well, Stinky... Stickers?  Yes, Mater, I am. Whoohoo! I decide when I'm done. I was hoping you'd say that. Okay, but I got an idea. And I'm gonna need to talk to Rusty and Dusty, all right? Oh, I'll get them on the horn. Get it? On the horn?  Oops. Hold on. Got to sneeze.  Dadgum, I lost it. Hey, I'll see you at Flo's.  I found it. Hey, watch your step. What about the car from Everett?  Remember him?  He was stuck in reverse!  I said, you need a house with a circular driveway!   You need to get your rusty tails down here. I created a drink in your honor. Yeah! The Rusteze Medicated Bumper Bomb. It goes down faster than an elevator full of Winnebagos. Rusty and Dusty! Well, look who's here. Hey, there he is! Good to see you, Lightning!  Thanks, guys. Wow. You're all here. Sorry, buddy, did you want this call to be private? No, Mater. This is perfect. Listen, thanks, everyone, for sticking by me. It took me a while to figure it out, but I know now that it's time... for me to make some changes. Changes? What kind of changes? It's futile to resist change, man. You're right, Fillmore. Really? Which is why I have an announcement to make. I've thought long and hard about it. Done a lot of soulsearching and considered all of the options. And I've finally decided... You do want to keep racing? Are you kidding? Of course I want to keep racing! Thank goodness! Glad to hear it. All right. Man, for a second I... Wait a minute. I knew that the whole time. Guys! I'm talking about making this my best season yet! We were hoping you'd say that.  The thing is, if I'm gonna be faster than Storm, I need to train like him. We're way ahead of you, buddy!  Lightning, we want you on the road first thing in the morning...  so you can come out and see the brandnew...  Rusteze Racing Center!  It's wicked awesome.  What? Rusteze Racing Center? It's got all the fancy bells and whistles that kids are training on these days.  We'll send Macky boy all the directions.  Now get moving, all right?  Okay! Yes! Fancy new training center? That sounds nice! Guido, come! We have to pack the tires! Hey, McQueen! You can't race in primer, man. Come on! Let's go.  Ramone, you have done it again. It's like the Sistine Chapel on wheels.  I'm coming for you, Storm. Morning, McQueen! Hey, look at you. Oh! He looks so good! Welcome back. You look different. Obviously. You look ready. Guido, come! Scusi, scusi.  Tires coming through. Go kick those rookies in the trunk.  All right, bye. Catch you on the flipside. I'll see you guys in Florida. See you, McQueen. Don't forget to call me. Good luck in college.  Hey, Sal. Thanks. Anytime. Love you! Love you more. Rusteze Racing Center, here we come! Good times ahead.     When the time gets right   I'm gonna pick you up   And take you far away from   From trouble, my love   Under a big old sky   Out in a field of green   There's got to be something   Left for us to believe   Oh, I await the day   Good fortune comes our way   And we'll ride down the King's Highway   Yeah, yeah Yeah   McQueen, over here! McQueen, how you feeling? Have you seen the latest records Storm's been setting? Have you given any thought to retirement? Okay, that's enough. No questions! Scusi. Out of the way! Coming through! Okay, back up. Back up! No pictures. No, no, no.  Okay, thank you. Byebye. Guido, can you believe them? Paparazzi.   Wow! Looks good, doesn't it? Hey, guys. What do you think? What do I think? It's unbelievable. Yeah, you know, it's kind of a cozy, humble, little place. Guys, how did you ever do this? You want to tell him or should I? No, you start. Go ahead.  We sold Rusteze. Huh? What? What? You think a couple of jabronis like us could do this on our own? Wait. You sold Rusteze? It's all good news. We just realized that you needed something that we couldn't give you. It felt like the time was right for us too. I mean, we're not as young and handsome as we look.  Oh, that's true. Besides, this Sterling fellow? He's got every hightech thing you'll ever need. Everything we wanted to give you, but couldn't. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sterling? Who's Sterling? Lightning McQueen! You made some serious time, partner. Your new sponsor. He's the Mudflap King of the Eastern seaboard. Welcome to the Rusteze Racing Center! You have no idea how much I've been looking forward to this. Thanks, uh, Mr... Please. No ""mister"". Just Sterling. I have been a fan of yours forever. And to be your sponsor? How great is that? I can't thank Rusty and Dusty here enough. Tough negotiators by the way. Oh, you flatter us, but don't stop!  Anyway, just wanted to say a quick hello. Take as much time as you need. Door's always open, guys. See? I sure am gonna miss racing for you guys. You know, you gave us a lot of great memories, Lightning. Memories we'll remember. Wow. That's good. Hey, Lightning, whatever you do... Don't drive like my brother! Don't drive like my brother. Please no pictures. Okay, maybe one. Get my good side though, will you?  Whoa. So? You like it? Oh, hey, Mr. Sterling. Wow. My career on a wall. Nice that you included Doc. Of course. He was your mentor. Losing him left a giant hole in the sport. Yeah. Jars of dirt? Sacred dirt. Each of those jars contains dirt from all the old tracks that Doc raced on. Florida International, Thunder Hollow, just down the road and... our very own Fireball Beach, right outside. Huh. Hey, is that... A bit of asphalt from Glen Ellen. My first win! You really are a fan. I am. And a fan of your future. You ready for it? Definitely. First, let's get you into a more... contemporary look. Wow. It's an electronic suit.  With it we'll be able to track your speed  and your vital signs.   Does it have a phone? Don't be crazy.  Racecars don't have phones.  Wow. Not bad, huh? This is really impressive. This center has quickly become the most coveted destination... for young racers training to make our team someday. And it's where you'll train until you leave for Florida. Treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality.  Still working on that. And the best fitness regimen anyone could possibly imagine. Wait. Wait. Whoa. Is that the simulator? Oh, yes. Lightning, I'd like to introduce you to the multimillion dollar... flagship of interactive race simulation. The XDL 24GTS Mark Z. The XDL... etcetera. Jackson Storm wishes he had this model.   That was amazing. Awesome. Yeah! It's just like being on a real track, so put your hours in. Okay, let's hit the treadmills. Come on. Show me what you got! Wow. Pretty fast. Who's the racer? No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer. Cruz Ramirez. The best trainer in the business. Ready to meet it, greet it and defeat it? All right. Now bring up those RPMs! Like the attitude. Yeah, we call her our maestro of motivation. You're driving a little tense again, Ronald. No, no. I'm cool. I'm cool. Do your exercise. I am a fluffy cloud! I am a fluffy cloud! I am a fluffy cloud.  There you go! You're a cloud.  Shut up, Kurt! Here come the bugs, Kurt. You ready?   Hey, I kept my eyes open this time! Got to see that track. Oh, no. Homesick again, Gabriel? Si.    Win for them! Wow. She trains young racers to push through their own obstacles. Tailormade for each one. Now, she's gonna work with you. Let's go! Let's go! You guys got to work through this stuff... so when your big chance comes along you can take it. Hey, Cruz. Oh, hey, Mr. Sterling! I'd like to introduce you to Lightning McQueen. I hear you're the maestro. Mr. Sterling, did you say Lightning McQueen was here because... I don't see him anywhere. Uh, but he's right here. Do you not see him? Nope, still don't see him. He's right in front of you! It's Lightning McQueen! He's obviously an imposter. He looks old and broken down with flabby tires. Hey! I do not! Use that! Whoa! Oh. Yeah, I see. I can use that energy for motivation, right?  It's all about motivation, Mr. McQueen. You can use anything negative as fuel to push through to the positive. I've been pretty positive ever since I was a rookie. I am so excited that I get to train you. I grew up watching you on TV. Huh? Is that right? These young guys are great and all, but I like a challenge.  I'm not that much older, but... In fact, I call you my senior project.  We need to loosen those ancient joints. First the wheels. And forward, and rest, and forward, and rest. Join me! Rest. And rest. Is all this resting necessary? We're working you in slowly. And reach for your lunch. Reach for your lunch. Now reach, to the front. What is there? It's your lunch. Now backwards. Is lunch there? When do we go on the simulator? Good morning, Mr. McQueen. Looking good.  Why? This'll get oil to places it hasn't been in a long time. Is that a drip pan? Just in case. How old do you think I am? Visualize yourself driving fast down a steep hill. I'll be back in a few. Visualize... Wait. Cruz! A few what? I just want to go on the simulator. How's it hanging, Drip Pan?  'Sup? Okay, day three... Treadmill. I've set a maximum speed to conserve your energy. What I want you to do is visualize beating this guy.  Storm! Uhhuh, that's right. Get him! Get him, Mr. McQueen! Get him? This thing's only going like 5 miles an hour! We'll work up to the higher speeds right after you take your nap. Nap? I don't need a nap!  Hit him with the bugs!  I am not taking a nap! All cars in the test bay simulator...   How was your nap, Mr. McQueen? It was kind of refreshing actually. Oh! Okay, what are you... Hey! You've been driving on tires a long time. Have you ever stopped to get to know them? I'm sorry, what? Tires are individuals. You should give each a name. Name them?  I won't be doing that. Mine are named Maria, Juanita, Ronaldo, and Debbie Richardson. What? Long story. May I have my tires back so I can go on the simulator please? Name them! Uh, Lefty, Righty, Backy, Backy Junior. Okay? Does this make you mad? Yes, it does! Use that! And merge, and yield, and merge, and yield.  Beep, beep, beep, beep. Now you got some tire damage. Speed bump, speed bump. Now clean up your messy garage. Bug in your windshield. Thank you, Cruz, I'm done. Mr. McQueen, where are you going? To the future. Okay. Here we go. How do I do this? Come on, baby. Mr. McQueen... Cruz, thank you for the oldman training, as crazy as it was, but I'm... warmed up enough and now I need you to launch this thing. Wait until you can handle it. Please? There are no shortcuts.  Okay. We'll just see about that. All right. My star racer is on the simulator! Why, yes, I am! Well, let's see you take it out for a spin. Right away, Mr. Sterling, owner of the company. Okay. Have fun.  This is what I'm talking about. Whoa. Didn't know about those.  Prepare to race. The green flag is out.  I don't see the flag. What do I do? Go. Go?  Whoa. That's sensitive.  You have hit a wall.  It shouldn't be this hard, should it? Ah! You have hit a wall.  You're fighting the simulator. Just race like you always do. You have hit a wall.  Whoa. There can't be this many walls on a regular track! You have been passed by Jackson Storm.  Wait, Storm's in here? For motivation. Storm races at 207. Pick it up, Mr. McQueen! I'm trying!  Ahhh! You have hit a wall.  Mr. McQueen, come down from there and we'll work you up to this. I am fine, Cruz. I can do it, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa!   Ahh! You have jumped a barrier.  Oh!  Sorry! You have maimed two vehicles.  You have destroyed a drinking fountain.   You have disabled an ambulance.  You are on fire. Danger. Danger.  You are going the wrong way.  Look out! Turn it off! Get these things off of me!   You have crashed. You have crashed.  Are you all right? You have crashed.  I have crashed.   It's not easy for him. Cruz, just relax. Give him another chance. I will talk to him. I can still work with him. I know he's your project. Are you sure? Cruz. Well, can't you just... Cruz. It's not easy for him. Look, I'm trying to help you. Whoa. You're all warshed up, McQueen. I'm sorry. What? I said, the floor's all washed up and clean. Oh, right.  Thank you very much. Uh... Good luck. Hey, Lightning. Come on in. Got something to show you. You ready? Uh, for what? Wow. You are about to become the biggest brand in racing. We are talking saturation on all continents for every demographic. Movie deals, infomercials, product endorsements. Mudflaps? Of course. We'll be rich beyond belief. You think you're famous now?   I thought you'd be mad about the simulator. I mean, this is all great, Mr. Sterling, I guess, but I don't know. I've never really thought of myself as a brand. Oh, nor do I. I'm a fan. Maybe your most avid. I think of this as your legacy!  It sounds like something that happens after you're done racing. Mr. Sterling, what is this about? Look, Lightning. I'm not gonna race you. What? What do you mean not race me? Hold on. Hold on. I'm not going to Florida? You have no idea how excited I was to get you here because... I knew you'd be back. It was gonna be the comeback story of the year! But your speed and performance just aren't where they need to be. I'm sorry. We're talking about speed on a simulator. Listen to how crazy that sounds. Look, I'm trying to help you. As your sponsor, yes, but also as your friend. Your racing days are coming to an end. Every time you lose, you damage yourself. Damage the brand, you mean? Oh, Lightning, come on. You've done the work. Now move on to the next phase and reap the reward. The racing is the reward. Not the stuff. I don't want to cash in. I want to feel the rush of moving 200 miles an hour... inches from the other guys, pushing myself faster than I thought I could go! That's the reward, Mr. Sterling! Oh, Lightning, come on. Look, I can do this. I can, I promise! I'll train like I did with Doc. I'll get my tires dirty on every dirt track from here to Florida. I can start on Fireball Beach where all the old greats used to race. Get your tires dirty. That's how you're gonna get faster than Storm? Yes! Exactly! I mean, sacred dirt, right? Mr. Sterling, if you care about my legacy, the one that Doc started, you'll let me do this. I promise you, I will win. I don't know. What you're asking, it's too risky. Come on. You like it, I can tell. It's got that little ""comeback story of the year"" feel to it, doesn't it?  One race? If you don't win at Florida, you'll retire? Look, if I don't win I'll sell all the mudflaps you got. But if I do win, I decide when I'm done. Deal? Deal. Thank you, Mr. Sterling. You won't be sorry. Just one thing and this is only because I don't like taking chances. You're taking someone with you.    You talked him into it! Way to go, Mr. McQueen! Cruz. You could talk a snowmobile into an air conditioner. You're going with me? With that thing? Yeah. You still need my help. You're brittle like a fossil.  We got the cable.  I don't need a trainer out here, Cruz. You're old! What if you fall on this beach and can't get up? Well, life's a beach and then you drive.  Oh, McQueen. Thank you. This is beautiful. I can see why Mr. Sterling said you wanted to train here. As soon as this thing's booted up, we'll get you on the treadmill... and I'll track your speed. What? No! The whole idea is getting my tires dirty. Real racing. I'm not driving on that thing when I've got the sand and the whole earth.  Oh, okay. Luigi, let's do this. Welcome, racers, to Fireball Beach! Historic home for today's great test of speed. Our finish line will be the abandoned pier in the distance. All right. Quicker than quick, faster than fast, I am speed... That is great selfmotivation. Did you come up with that? Yeah, I did. On your mark. Get set. Go!  There you go! Felt good! Hey, what was my speed? I don't know. I can only track you on the treadmill. No treadmills! Oh! What about Hamilton? Hamilton here.  Who's Hamilton? My electronic personal assistant. You know, like on your phone. You do have a phone, don't you? Racecars don't have phones, Cruz. Hamilton, track Mr. McQueen's speed and report it. Tracking.  I'll stay as close as I can. Your suit will transmit your speeds to Hamilton. Fine. Whatever. Let's do this. Quicker than quick, faster than fast, I am speed. Come on, Luigi. On your mark, get set, and go! 46 miles per hour. 63 miles. Out of range.  Huh. That's odd. I didn't go!  On sand you got to ease into your start so your tires can grab, okay? Okay. You do work with racecars, don't you? Yeah, but never outside. All right. Let's go again. Go! 54 miles per hour.  75 miles per hour. Out of range.  Huh?  Sorry! Got stuck! Go again! And go! Ah! Sorry! Go! Whoa! Go!  The beach ate me. All right, Cruz, pick a line on the compacted sand. You got to have traction or you're gonna spin out. Let's do this thing! On your mark, get set, go! 122 miles per hour.  134 miles... Out of range.  Now what? I didn't want to hit a crab! You got to be kidding me. What? It was cute!  All right, one last chance to try this before it gets dark. Now, you're going to take off slow to let your tires grab. And pick a straight line on hard sand so you don't spin out. Uhhuh. And all of the crabbies have gone nightnight. Mr. McQueen. All right. Let's go again. And go! 150 miles per hour. 175 miles per hour.  196 miles per hour.   All right! Finally! You made it! Congratulations! How'd I do? You topped out at 198. 198? That's it? Still slower than Storm. Wasted my whole day. I wouldn't say that. It did feel great to be out here doing real racing. This isn't real racing. We're on a beach! All you do is go straight. How am I gonna get faster if I don't... Thunder Hollow. Thunder Hollow! There's a dirt track there! That's what I need! To race against actual racers. No! Too public! If the press find you, they will be like many bugs on you. Paparazzi!  Guys, I really need this! Ah, just leave it to me, boss. I am a master of disguise.    All right! Next!   You, sir, are officially incognito. Nobody's bothering you. The great Lightning McQueen. I can feel it, guys. Tonight is the night I find my speed! Racers, get on over to the startin' line. Pronto!  All right! No more straight lines. Just a good oldfashioned oval. Hey, now! You that outoftowner? Uh, yes. That's me! Chester Whipplefilter. And I'm Frances Beltline. Cruz, what are you doing? I'm your trainer. I'm gonna track your speed from the infield, Whipplefilter. Fine. Just stay out of the way. Excuse me, sir? Where are the other racers? Oh, they'll be along. We always let our guests start right up front.   Welcome, y'all, to Thunder Hollow Speedway...  for tonight's edition of Crazy Eight!  Did he say Crazy Eight? Whoa. Race fans!  It's time to meet tonight's challengers!    Have a nice trip!  Protect and swerve!    Cruz! This isn't what I thought it was. Come on, follow me and we'll slip out. Rule number one: The gate closes, you race. Wait! No, no, no. I'm not a racer. Rule number two: Last car standing wins. And rule number three: No cursing! It's Family Night. Excuse me, sir? Wait. No, I'm just a trainer! Whoo!  And make way for the undefeated Crazy Eight champion...  the Diva of Demolition, Miss Fritter!   Boo!  Lookie here, boys. We got us a couple of rookies. I'm gonna call you Muddy Britches and you Lemonade. Hey, neither one of them has a single dent. Oh, I'm gonna fix that! All right, everybody! Let's go racing!    I'm about to commit a moving violation. Ow.  Boo!    Cruz! Haha! Watch out. What are you doing? Got to keep moving! I shouldn't be out here!  Move, Cruz! Move!  What do I do? I can't steer! Turn right to go left! Turn right to go left! That doesn't make any sense! Turn right to go left!   Whoa.  Hey, Patty. Oh, hey, Bill! Ahhh!     Look, Ma, I can drive... Oh, man! Nice day for a drive, huh? Hey, buddy! Get the out of my way! Whoohoo!  Hey! I'm driving...      Oh, look at my new hat!   I'm flying! No! I'm not flying!  Get it. Get it. I got it!  Cruz!   Oh! Hey, buddy! Move it! Turn right to go left. Turn right to go left. Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Here I come, boy! No, no, no!  Oh, no. Buckle up, everybody!  It's Fritter time!   Fritter! Fritter! Fritter! Fritter! Fritter! We love you, Miss Fritter. Oh, yeah! Your license plate's gonna look real nice in my collection. Oh, boy. Run! Oh, no. Remember, obey all appropriate street signs. Cruz!    Whoa! Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, my gracious! Miss Fritter's down!      Nobody touches him. He is mine!  You gonna get it now, Whipplefilter!  Come on, McQueen. You can do it. Come on, Lightning, keep going. Miss Fritter is looking to get upright, folks.  And she is not pleased.  Get up. Get up! Fritter! Fritter! You about to feel the wrath of the... Lower Belleville County Unified School District! Oh! What the... Wait...  No, no, no! No! No!  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!  Frances Beltline!  Is that me? That's me! I won! I won! Cruz! Cruz! No! Ahhh! Watch out! Whoa, whoa.     Whipplefilter? It's Lightning McQueen!   McQueen!   Fans here at Thunder Hollow still buzzing over tonight's...  unexpected appearance of Lightning McQueen.  He has always been my favorite!  My garage is covered from head to toe with 95 posters.  Tell our listeners at home you weren't really trying  to wreck him, were you? So trophy's kind of nice. Don't you think? I mean, I know you got like a billion of them, so you would know. I still can't believe I won.  It's pretty shiny. I have never seen one up close. Looks like they spent a lot of money on it. I mean, I think it's real metal. Stop. Just stop, okay, Cruz? You don't even know. You don't even have one clue... Hey! I was just trying... Do you know what happens if I lose this race? Every mile of this trip was to get me faster than Jackson Storm. Faster! I started off getting nowhere for a week on a simulator! I lose a whole day with you on Fireball Beach. And then I waste tonight in the crosshairs of Miss Fritter! I'm stuck in the same speed I was a month ago! I can't get any faster because I'm too busy taking care of my trainer! This is my last chance, Cruz. Last! Final! Finito!  If I lose, I never get to do this again. If you were a racer... you'd know what I'm talking about but you're not! So you don't.  Mack! Pull over! What? Now? Now! Ahh! Okay! Pulling over! Ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer, Mr. McQueen. Go ahead. Ask me if I got up in the dark to run laps before school every day. Ask me if I saved every penny to buy a ticket to the races when they came to town. Ask me if I did that so I could be a trainer someday. Ask me. Did you? No! I've wanted to become a racer forever! Because of you! I used to watch you on TV, flying through the air. You seemed so... fearless. ""Dream small, Cruz,"" that's what my family used to say. ""Dream small or not at all."" They were just trying to protect me. But I was the fastest kid in town and I was gonna prove them wrong. What happened? When I got to my first race, I figured it out. What? That I didn't belong. The other racers looked nothing like me. They were bigger and stronger and so... confident. And when they started their engines, that was it... I knew I'd never be a racer. I just left. It was my one shot and I didn't take it. Yeah, so, uh, I'm gonna head back to the training center. I think we both know it's for the best. But can I ask you something? What was it like for you? When you showed up to your first race? How did you know you could do it? I don't know. I just never thought I couldn't. I wish I knew what that felt like. Good luck, Mr. McQueen. Cruz. Cruz, wait.  And earn your physics degree  from the comfort of your own home...  You'd get that and a $200 gift,  for $29.95.   Now look here, Warden...  Oh, no! He's got a jack!  Autos over 100,000 miles also reported trouble sleeping.  You could have 12 wornout wrenches or you could have one atomic wrench.  Throw the old ones out. This covers...  ""Champion for the Ages"" Chick Hicks here.  Coming to you live from... Chick Hicks Studios,  where I'm joined once again by...  nextgen racing expert, Natalie Certain.  Thanks, Chick. Piston Cup champion Jackson Storm set a new record today...  when he pulled off the fastest lap ever recorded.  An unprecedented 213 miles an hour.  Wow! So what do you think, Certain?  Stormy boy gonna start the season with another win? Highly likely, Chick. Based on his recent run times and forecasted... track temperatures on race day, Storm's chances of winning... are 95.2%. That low, huh? Oh, and in case you missed it, talk of the track tonight is Lightning McQueen... finding yet another way to embarrass himself at a demolition derby. Whoa. Almost makes me feel sorry for the guy. Not really.  Here's what his new sponsor had to say. Everyone, relax. The 95's gonna race. Lightning's just taking a somewhat unconventional approach to this race. It's one of the things his fans love about him. Yeah, right! Talk about humiliating.  If I were old Kachow... I wouldn't even bother  to show up in Florida.  That could be for the best, Chick. Even if he does race...  McQueen's probability of winning is 1.2%.  Wow!  Numbers never lie.  I'm willing to predict tonight that Lightning McQueen's racing...  career will be over within the week.  It might even be over now.  I mean, I knew his career was stuck in the mud...    First you find a can from a rusty van   Bumpbump   Quicker than a dart, make it into art   Bumpbump   That's the way it's done, it's a lot of fun   Bumpbump   Liftin' my funk, makin' sculpture outta junk    What's that? There we go! Somebody's interrupting genius! Well, hey, there, buddy! Mater!  You know, I was just thinking of you and here you are lookin' right at me!  You see me okay? Hang on a second there. Hold on. Let me see here.  That better?  Looking you straight in the eye there, pal. Hey, sorry about calling so late. Shoot, not for me it's not. I'm always burning that midnight oil. So get me caught up on everything. Well, actually kind of hoping I might hear what's going on back home. Not much. If you don't count Sarge and Fillmore tryin' to run the tire shop. But tell Luigi not to worry, Sarge is gonna track down... every last tire that Fillmore done gived away. Other than that, everything's good.  How's Sally? Oh, she's fine.  Keeping busy at the Cone. She misses you.  Well, shoot! We all do when you're on the road.  Yeah. You know, I've been kind of thinking about that. You know, what we should do when I'm not on the road anymore. What do you mean not on the road?  Well, you know. Mater, I can't do this forever. Huh? I'm just not getting anywhere with the training. If anything, I've gotten slower not faster. Shoot, buddy, it'll work out.  Just tell me what the problem is...  and I'll stay right here with you until we fix it.  That's just it, Mater. I don't know. And I feel like I'm all out of ideas. Hmm.  All right, let me think. Oh! You know what I'd do?  What? I don't know. I got nothin'.  I guess I ain't Doc when it comes to that.  I would give anything to talk to him right now. Yep, there was nobody smarter than old Doc.  Well, except for maybe whoever taught him.  Yeah. Wait. What? Everybody was taught by somebody, right?  Take my cousin Doyle.  He taught me how to sing and whistle at the same time.  He was very musical that way.  Smokey. Mater, you're brilliant. Ah, well... It's all about the shape of your teeth.  I got to go to Thomasville. Oh, well, good.  You know me, buddy, I'm always happy to help. Think I am better at that than most folks. You know, talkin' and stuff.  Hey, Cruz. You won't talk me out of this, Mr. McQueen. I'm going back. I resign as your trainer. All right. I accept your resignation. Bye. Oh... Okay. But since you cleared your calendar, why don't you come with us? I'm looking for someone named Smokey. Hoping he can help me. Maybe he can help you too. Nah. Come on. I fixed it. No. Thanks anyway. But I'm done. Okay. But maybe this will change your mind. Hit it.  First I'm going to loosen up these ancient joints... No, please don't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I yelled. It wasn't your fault that I almost got killed. But now you're leaving and you won't get on the ramp. All right, I'll go. You won't get on the ramp. All right, I'll go! Just stop! How do you know Smokey's going to be here? I don't. Oh. Do you know if he's even alive? Nope. Okay. So tell me this: How do you know if it's Smokey? Is there such... Wait. Mack, pull over! Back it up! Back it up. Good to see you, Doc. Hey, isn't that your old crew chief? Hey, Cruz? You want to check out the home track of the greatest racer ever? Aren't we supposed to be looking for Smokey? Oh, that's right, he's dead. We don't know that. Are you sure you have time for this? For this, I do. Wow! If this track could talk. Cruz, what do you say? Let's take a lap.  Oh, yeah! Oh, whoa!  Yes! You nailed it! Way easier without the school bus of death trying to kill us!  Yeah, no kidding!    Was starting to think I might never meet you. Smokey?  He is alive. I know why you're here. You're thirsty.  I'll tell you what, these folks are gonna get a kick out of meeting Hud's boy. Who's Hud? Oh, Doc Hudson! Right.  Hey!  Act civilized. We got company. Hey, Les. How's that back axle treating you? Hey, sugar, welcome to Thomasville.   Would you look at that? What? Three of the biggest racing legends ever! Junior ""Midnight"" Moon. River Scott. Louise... Louise ""Barnstormer"" Nash? She had 38 wins! Well, as I live and breathe. If it ain't Lightning McQueen. Ms. Nash, it's a pleasure to meet you... You've had a tough year, haven't you? Oh, uh... Shouldn't you be running practice laps in Florida by now? Yeah, sure, but... They're here to steal our secrets. Looking for your lost mojo? Wow. You don't mince words around here, do you? Truth is always quicker, kid.   But all he kept talking about was   Glory days   They'll pass you by Glory days   In the wink of a young girl's eye   Glory days   Glory days  Guido, she's an angel.  Lou won't admit this, but she used to have serious eyes for Hud. Oh, really? Even if I did, it wouldn't have mattered. Hud didn't like fast women. And that left me out.  Old Lou wasn't just fast, she was fearless. The second I saw my first race, I just knew I had to get in there. Of course, the fellas in charge didn't like a lady racer showin' them up. So they wouldn't let me have a number. What did you do? I stole one! What? Wow. Life's too short to take no for an answer. Right, River? If we had waited for an invitation, we might've never raced. And once we got on the track, we didn't want to leave. I think that's how Doc felt too. You should've seen him when he first came to town. Shiny blue paint. Not just the Hudson Hornet. He was already calling himself... ...the Fabulous Hudson Hornet. Whoohoo!  Did we ever ride him on that. Not for long. Hud was the fastest racer this side of the Mississippi. Until he wasn't. What? Everything changed when the rookie showed up.  Took Hud all of no time  to work his way through the best racers...  in both Carolinas.  Past River. Past Lou. Even Junior.  But there was still the rookie to deal with.  Tried slamming him into the wall.  But Hud never touched any wall,  unless he wanted to.   That rookie never saw anything like that before. Doc did that? Whoa! Are you kidding? Couldn't wipe the smile off his face for a week after that.   I wish I could've seen him like that. Like what? So happy. You didn't come all this way for a quart of oil, did you? I need your help, Smokey. Yeah? What kind of help? That's just it, I'm not sure. All I know is if I lose in Florida... it's over for me. What happened to Doc will happen to me. What did happen to him? You know, racing was the best part of his life. And when it ended, he... Well, we both know he was never the same after that. Is that what you think? Come on. I want to show you something. You got the first part right. The crash broke Hud's body and the ""no more racing"" broke his heart. He cut himself off. Disappeared to Radiator Springs. Son of a gun didn't talk to me for 50 years. But then one day, the letters started coming in. And every last one of them was about you. Yeah, Hud loved racing. But coaching you? I had never seen the old grump so happy. Racing wasn't the best part of Hud's life. You were. You ready to blow out a little carbon there, boy? Yes, I am!  You give it too much throttle, you're in the tulips.  Hey, Lightning. You might want to take notes on this one.   You got a lot of stuff, kid.  Hud saw something in you that you don't even see in yourself. Are you ready to go find it? Yes, sir. All right, all right. Bring it back.  Lesson one: You're old. Accept it. I told him that. He's probably losing his hearing.  He said you're old and losing... I heard him. You'll never be as fast as Storm, but you can be smarter than him. Okay, what do I do? They said you were in a demolition derby. Yeah, it was terrible and I almost... Are you sure? Because there's not a scratch on you. Funny what a racer can do when he's not overthinking things. Shannon Spokes here at Florida International,  where Jackson Storm...  clocked 214 miles per hour today.  You want to beat Storm, you need someone to stand in for him. Like a sparring partner. I'm not so sure. Not a racer. Just a trainer! Go ahead and gun it.  Oh, yeah!  With no muffler you even sound like Storm. Oh, you're going down, McQueen! Get that arthritisriddled keister onto the track so I can put you into... the old folks' home against your will! How was that? That'll work. Worked for me. I'm good. Yep. That'll do. Did you hear what she said? You didn't show up in Florida for qualifying so you'll be starting last. I'll give you three laps to catch her. Go through the entire field in three laps? You want to beat Storm or not? Yes! Of course I do. Well, then, go!  Come on, kid. All right. Looks like we got some work to do. Look alive. The reflexes are the first thing to go.  Ah!  Why are we in a field? Sneak through that window! What does that mean? I don't know. Go!   Whoa! Not cool, man. Not cool! Let's run it back. Do you even want to be out here? Only two days left, kid. You got to work harder.  Wait, wait, who was that? I put McQueen in there. Give you some real competition.  Hud was a master of letting the other cars do the work for him. He used to say cling to 'em like you was two June bugs... on a summer night. He stole that from me.  Drafting? I've never had to do that. Yeah, that's when you were fast. Now you're slow. And old. And rickety. And dilapidated. Okay! Okay, I get it. The new you has to look for opportunities... you never knew were there.  Sneak through the window!  Sneak through the window. What? When a window opens, take it!  Whoa! Yes. Whoa! I made it! All right!  Let's go! Let's move!  Reflexes! All right, Guido, turn up the heat. Okay. Whoa! Whoa!  All right, look who finally showed up. This is where we cut our racing teeth. In the woods? Let's just say the moon was always shining on us. Huh? If the moon didn't shine, we didn't have to... Oh, never mind. We ran moonshine, dummy! Oh! By the way, no lights. Instinct only.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh!  Whoa! Yeah!  Whoohoo!  All right!  McQueen's still not here? Didn't he pull this when he was a rookie? At least that's what my grandfather told me. All right, we got time for one last race. Hurry this along, boss, we got to get you to Florida. Go! Maybe it's best that he doesn't show up, after how last season ended. Let me put it this way. I'm not losing any sleep wondering where Lightning McQueen is. Come on, boy. Come on! All right, McQueen. There you go, boy! There you go. McQueen is fading. McQueen is fading. Fading fast.   Whoohoo! Yes! Ah!  Whoo! Did you see that? That was... Uh... Sorry. I didn't mean to... Hey, uh, boss, it's time to hit the road. Yeah.  I want to thank everyone for the training. We better get going to Florida. Welcome to racing's greatest day!  We're beachside at the Florida International Speedway...  to kick off a new season of Piston Cup racing.  It's the Florida 500.  Fortythree cars and a quarter million fans  await today's intense contest of..  Strategy, skill, but most of all, speed.  This crowd is in for one great day of racing.  I'm Bob Cutlass,  joined as always by my broadcasting partner...  Darrell Cartrip and stat sensation Natalie Certain. I've never seen the numbers line up for Storm like they do today, Bob. Storm should be 96.8% unstoppable. Well, don't overlook Lightning McQueen.  Whipplefilter! Yeahhoo!  We've heard stories of the unusual way  McQueen trained to get here.  Now the question is did it work?  Speed. I am... speed?  Hey, boss, they're, uh... calling the racers to the track.  Jeff Gorvette, how does today's talent stack up? Oh, I think we're in for a treat today. These racers are... Oh... Hey, McQueen, win one for us old guys. Hah! Will do, Jeff. Hey, there, buddy! Hey, guys. Stickers. Hey, Sal. You okay? Yeah. Absolutely. Listen, you're gonna do great today. And no matter what happens... I'm going to move onto the next rookie and forget I ever knew you.  I'm glad you're here. Oh, wow! Nice costume. Come here, let's get a picture. It's so great to meet my numberone fan. What a jerk. She's not a fan, Storm. Oh, hey there, champ. I heard you're selling mudflaps after today. Is that true? Hey, you put me down for the first case, okay?  Lightning! Lightning McQueen! Hey, Lightning!  Hey, Mr. Sterling. To the future, eh, champ?  Yeah. To the future. Hey, just focus on what you're here to do, kid.  Thanks, Smokey. Now, go make Hud proud.  You got it. Boogity, boogity, boogity, let's go racing!  McQueen is making steady progress  in the early parts of this race.  Well, it won't be enough to catch Storm.  Considering he started dead last...  I don't think he's doing halfbad out there.  Not too shabby!  You keep this up, you'll finish in the top 10! Top 10's not gonna cut it, Smokey. I got to go all the way. So dig in! Remember your training. Find Storm and chase him down! Oh, tell him he has three laps to catch me! Cruz says you've got three laps to catch her. Yeah, okay! Tell her, thanks. Cruz, what are you doing here? Oh, Mr. Sterling, I was just... I'd like you to head back to the training center right away. Oh. But why? I need you to get Kurt up to speed for the race next weekend. Um... Wait, not Kurt. He's the bug guy, right? The other one... Ronald. Yes! But I want to stay and watch. That's not gonna happen, Cruz. Now go.  But Mr. McQueen still has a chance... Just go do your job! Yes, sir. And take off that spoiler and those racing tires. You look ridiculous! You are a trainer, remember? Not a racer!  If you were a racer, you'd know what I'm talking about but you're not! So you don't! No.  She's not a racer. She's a trainer.   I've wanted to become a racer forever!  Because of you!  It was my one shot and I didn't take it. It was my one shot and I didn't take it.   Wreck in two. Wreck in turn two.  Go low. Go low.   Kid, you okay? Smokey, I need Cruz! Never mind that now.  No! I need her back here. Now! The yellow flag still out, folks.  Wrecked cars everywhere. We're still trying to figure...  Hamilton here. Call from Chester Whipplefilter.  Chester... Mr. McQueen? The green light's on, pit road is open, and everybody's coming in. Get ready, guys. Luigi, Guido, tires! Fillmore, fuel! Okay, I'm here. What's going on? No! Not me! Her. Huh? What? What is she doing back here? Come on, guys! Get her set up! Okay! Hot tires! Wait! What's happening? Hey, Ramone! You got your paints? You know I do! Guys! What are you doing? Man, I don't understand it! McQueen's just sitting there. Something's got to be wrong. Mr. McQueen? Today's the day, Cruz. You're getting your shot. What? I started this race and you're gonna finish it. What? She'll damage the brand! She's just a trainer! No, she's a racer. Just took me awhile to see it. That can't be legal! The rules only say the number has to be out there. Doesn't say who has to wear it. No! You can't do that... Did I tell you I love your mudflaps? Out of my way, bumpkin! Got my fishing flaps, got my church flaps, my going out and eating flaps. Come on, guys! We got to get her out there! Let's go! Tires, check! Fuel, check! Ramone? Best I could do in the time frame, boss.  Yeah. That'll work. Why are you doing this? You said it yourself, this might be your last chance. Which makes it my last chance to give you your first chance, Cruz. And this time I want you to take it. She's got to beat that pace car out. No! You can't do that! Now or never. What do you say? Whoa! Hey! 35mileperhour pit speed! I knew that! McQueen's team has entered a different car sporting the 95. I don't believe what I'm seeing! You're watching this, right? What, the girl in the costume? You're kidding me. He put her in the race?  The green flag is out and we're back to racing.  Cruz? What are you doing? Come on. Pick it up! You got to go faster.  Call her Frances Beltline and tell her the school bus of death is after her. What? No. Trust me. Uh, Frances Beltline, the school bus of death is after you. What? Oh, uh... Right. Okay, that was different. Cruz, you're looking too tight now. Come on. Loosen up. Tell her she's a fluffy cloud. What? No. Smokey, tell her. Uh, Cruz, you are a fluffy cloud. Oh, right. Uh, too tight. I'm a fluffy cloud. I'm a fluffy cloud.  Uh... Anticipate your turns.  Cruz! Get your head in the race.  Tell her she's on a beach and all the little crabbies have gone nightnight. No! I ain't saying that. You tell her. All right, Cruz. The beach.  I need you to think of the beach.  Mr. McQueen? Yeah. It's me. Remember the beach.  Oh, pick a line, stick to it. Got it. All right. Not too bad. This is nothing like the simulator. You got every tool you need. Now remember Thomasville. Thomasville? Yeah. Sneak through the window. Now that I understand. Sneak through the window.   We're just learning that the racer  replacing McQueen is Cruz Ramirez. This is her very first race! Actually, Darrell, it says here she does have one win under her belt. At a place called Thunder Hollow? Thunder Hollow! She said Thunder Hollow! Try moving half a lane. Half a lane. Got it. All right, watch that lap car.  He's gonna go high. Go low! Go low! Nice job.  You are smoking these guys. Now watch the tire marbles along turn three. Keep your tires clean.  Okay. Bump coming up on the inside. Careful you don't go airborne. Now? Yes. Now!  Watch out by the wall, it's a little slick there. Watch it, watch it, watch it.   You have hit a wall. You have hit a wall. Haha. Just being aggressive. Okay, I want you to pit. Watch your RPM.  Get out of the gas. On the brake. On the brake. Too fast! Uh, we're back here. Sorry. All right. Pick 'em off one at a time. Go, go, go! That's it. Nice and straight.  Whoohoo!  Go, go, go, go! Smokey, you watching?  Just wanted to let you know Ramirez is moving up toward you. Why should I care? Because now she's in the top 10!  Okay. Now you're coming up on the leaders. Ramirez up to fourth.  In fourth? Huh. Get 'er done! Ramirez is in third.  What are you doing, Storm? Hey! Costume Girl. You know, at first I thought you were out here... because your GPS was broken. Don't listen to him, Cruz! You look good! It's important to look the part. You can't have everyone thinking that you don't deserve to be here.  He's trying to get in your head! They don't need to know what you and I already do. That you can play dressup all you want, but you'll never be one of us. Cruz, did you see what happened there? Yeah. He's in my head. No! Listen to me. You got into his head. Don't you understand? He would never have done that if you didn't scare him. What? He sees something in you that you don't even see in yourself  You made me believe it, now you got to believe it too. You are a racer.  Use that. And how far back is she now? Look behind you.  What? Good evening, Storm! Wait, how did you... Just back here drafting on your butt. Nothing to be concerned about. Like two June bugs on a summer night.   Hey, Hamilton. Hamilton here.  Call out our speed. 208 miles per hour, 207 miles...  Would you stop that? You're taking me off my line! Last lap! Come on, Cruz! Ohoh! My GPS is saying I have slow traffic in my way. No, you are not winning this! Ah, you're angry. I am not angry! You know, you can use that anger to push through. I said I'm not angry! Oh, I don't think so! No!  Cruz, get out of there! You don't belong on this track! Yes, I do! I don't believe it. It's Cruz Ramirez for the win!  I am speechless!    Nice finish, Cruz! You done it! Cruz Ramirez! Yeah, there you go! Way to go, Cruz! Oh, yes! Whoohoo! Man, heck of a win! Yeah. Heck of a win.  Hey, Cruz! You were flying! Thanks. You really had it rolling today. That was cool. Thank you! Hey, Cruz, your blinker's on. It is? Oh! You got me! Very funny!   Cruz! Cruz! Cruz! Ramirez! Whoo! Way to go, Cruz! Go ahead. Give them some smoke.  Cruz! Cruz! Cruz!   You'll get used to that. Out of my way! Come on! Move it! Move! Cruz! I knew you had something. And now look at you... a winner. I could use you as a racer on our team. We could make... Sorry, Mr. Sterling. I would never race for you. I quit.  Well, then race for me! Tex! Miss Cruz, I would be tickled pink to have you race for team Dinoco. As you know, we have a long history of great racers, except for Cal. Uh, guys, I'm still right here. Team Dinoco, Cruz! Hire her. I don't care. Lightning, now that you're retired... I need you first thing Monday morning for a photo shoot. Yeah, all right, Mr. Sterling. Whoa! Hang on now.  What? Why is my name up there? You started the race. That's how it works. Wait, wait, now... Wait a minute. No! Lightning wins, he decides when he's done racing. That was the deal. Hi, I'm his lawyer. That was the deal. You are not a nice guy. Although, I got to say, you do make a quality mudflap at an affordable price. Hey, Sterling. Why don't you and I take a drive and talk? Billionaire to billionaire.  Cruz, over here. Just one picture. How does it feel to beat Jackson Storm?  Take us through it, lap by lap.  It was great! Uh, didn't expect this.  Kid's got a lot of stuff, eh, Doc? Well, she had a great teacher. And now you get to decide when you're done racing. So what's it gonna be, Stinky? Uh, Stickers.  Oh, I'm gonna keep racing. But before that, I got something I want to do. Welcome all to historic Willy's Butte for today's great exhibition of speed!  There she is! Cruz! Oh, I love it. I love it. I love it. Thanks, guys!

Coco,Disney,2010,2017,Animation," Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.  Because of something that happened before I was even born.  See, a long time ago, there was this family.  The papa, he was a musician.  He and his family would sing and dance and count their blessings.  But he also had a dream. To play for the world.   And one day,  he left with his guitar and never returned.   And the mama... She didn't have time to cry over that walkaway musician.   After banishing all music from her life she found a way...  to provide for her daughter.  She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes.   She could have made candy,  or fireworks, or sparkly underwear...  for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.  Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.  And later, she taught her soninlaw.  Then her grandkids got roped in.   As her family grew, so did the business.  Music had torn her family apart.  But shoes held them all together.  You see, that woman was  my greatgreatgrandmother,  Mama Imelda.  She died way before I was born.  But my family still tells her story  every year on Dia de los Muertos... the Day of the Dead.  And her little girl,  she's my greatgrandmother,  Mama Coco.  Hola, Mama Coco. How are you, Julio? Actually, my name is Miguel.  Mama Coco has trouble remembering things.  But it's good to talk to her anyway.  So, I tell her pretty much everything.  I used to run like this. But now I run like this which is way faster. And the winner is Luchadora Coco! I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side. Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple. Miguel, eat your food. My Abuelita, she's Mama Coco's daughter.  Oh, you're a twig, mijo.  Have some more. No, gracias.  I asked if you would like more tamales! Si?  That's what I thought you said! Abuelita runs our house  just like Mama Imelda did.   No music!   No music!  Y aunque la vida   No music!  I think we're the only family in Mexico  who hates music.  And my family's fine with that. But me...  Be back by lunch, mijo.  Love you, Mama.  I am not like the rest of my family!  Hola, Miguel! Hola!   Muchas gracias.  De nada, Miguel.  Hey! Dante! Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake. Fist bump! Good boy, Dante! I know I'm not supposed to love music.  But it's not my fault! It's his!  Ernesto de la Cruz.  The greatest musician of all time.  Right here in this very plaza, Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps... toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history. He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.  But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him.   He starred in movies.  He had the coolest guitar! He could fly!  And he wrote the best songs.  But my alltime favorite, it's...   Remember me   Remember me   Though I have to say goodbye   Remember me  Remember me   Don't let it make you cry For even if I'm far away   I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you   Each night we are apart Remember me   Though I have to travel far   Remember me  Remember me   Each time you hear a sad guitar   Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be   Until you're in my arms again   He lived the kind of life you dream about.  Until 1942.   When he was crushed by a giant bell.  I want to be just like him.  Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz  and I get this feeling like we're connected.  Like if he could play music, maybe someday, I could too.  If it wasn't for my family. Ayayay, muchacho.  Huh? I asked for a shoe shine not your life story. Oh, yeah. Sorry.  I just can't really talk about any of this at home. So... If I were you, I'd march right up to my family and say... ""Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."" I could never say that. You are a musician, no? I don't know. I mean, I only really play for myself. Ah! Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician by hiding his skills? No! He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud. Mira, Mira, they're setting up for tonight! The music competition for Dia de Muertos.  You want to be like your hero? You should sign up! Uhuh. My family would freak! Look, if you're too scared then, well, have fun making shoes. Come on, what did de la Cruz always say? Seize your moment? Show me what you got, muchacho.   I'll be your first audience. Miguel!  Abuelita!  What are you doing here?  You leave my grandson alone.  Dona, please! I was just getting a shine.  I know your tricks, mariachi. What did he say to you? He was just showing me his guitar.  Shame on you. My grandson is a sweet little Angelito Querido Cielito.  He wants no part of your music, mariachi. You keep away from him.  Ay, pobrecito.  Oh, estas bien, mijo.   You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now.  How many times have we told you? That plaza is crawling with mariachis. Yes, Tio Berto.  No, no, no, no, no! Ah! Go away, you. Go! It's just Dante.  Never name a street dog. They'll follow you forever. Now, go get my shoe. I found your son in Mariachi Plaza. Ay, Miguel! You know how Abuelita  feels about the plaza. I was just shining shoes. A musician's shoes!  But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is. If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza. But what about tonight? What's tonight? Well, they're having this talent show. And I thought I might... Sign up? Well, maybe? You have to have talent to be in a talent show. What are you gonna do? Shine shoes?  It's Dia de los Muertos.  No one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family.  Ofrenda room. Vamonos.    Don't give me that look. Dia de los Muertos  is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. We've put their photos on the ofrenda  so their spirits can cross over. That is very important. If we don't put them up, they can't come. We made all this food, set out the things they loved in life, mijo.  All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who knows where. Where are you going? I thought we were done. Ay, Dios mio. Being part of this family means being here for this family. I don't want to see you end up like... Like Mama Coco's papa?  Never mention that man! He's better off forgotten. But you're the one who...  I was just...  But... I...  Papa? Papa is home? Mama, calmese, calmese.  Papa is coming home? No, Mama.  It's okay. I'm here. Who are you? Rest, Mama.  I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel. Miguel? Miguel?  What are we going to do with that boy? You're right. That's just what he needs.       It's you. Get in here. Come on, Dante. Hurry up! You're gonna get me in trouble, boy. Someone could hear me. I wish someone wanted to hear me.  Other than you. Ew. Okay.  Perfecto!  I have to sing. I have to play!  The music, it's not just in me, it is me.   When life gets me down, I play my guitar.  The rest of the world may follow the rules,  but I must follow my heart.  Ugh! You know that feeling like there's a song in the air and...  it's playing just for you?   A feeling so close...   You could reach out and touch it   I never knew   I could want something so much, but it's true   You must have faith, sister.  Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.  He will listen. To music.   Only a song, only a song   Has the power to change a heart   Never underestimate the power of music.  But my father, he will never give his permission.  I am done asking permission.  When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by.  You must seize it!  Senor de la Cruz,  what did it take for you to seize your moment?  I had to have faith in my dream.  No one was going to hand it to me.  It was up to me to reach for that dream.  Grab it tight and make it come true.  And make it come true.   No more hiding, Dante. I got to seize my moment!  I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me.   Dia de los Muertos has begun! No, no. We have to make a clear path. The petals guide our ancestors home. We don't want their spirits to get lost. We want them to come and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda.  Mama!   Where should we put this table? In the courtyard, mijos.  You want it down by the kitchen? Si. Next to the other one.  Get under! Get under! Miguel? Nothing! Mama, Papa. I... Miguel, your abuelita had the most wonderful idea. We've all decided. It's time you joined us in the workshop! What? No more shining shoes. You'll be making them every day after school. Oh! Our Miguelitititito carrying on the family tradition. And on Dia de los Muertos!  Your ancestors will be so proud. You'll craft huaraches just like your Tia Victoria. And wingtips like your Papa Julio. But what if I'm no good at making shoes? Ah, Miguel. You have your family here to guide you. You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is... A shoemaker. Through and through. That's my boy! Berto! Break out the good stuff. I want to make a toast.       Dante! No, Dante. Stop!    No, no, no, no, no! No.  De la Cruz's guitar? Papa? Papa?  Mama Coco, is your papa  Ernesto de la Cruz? Papa! Papa!    Papa! Papa! It's him! I know who my greatgreatgrandfather was. Miguel, get down from there. Mama Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz! What are you talking about? I'm gonna be a musician! What is all this? You keep secrets from your own family? It's all that time he spends in the plaza. Fills his head with crazy fantasies. It's not a fantasy. That man was Ernesto de la Cruz! The greatest musician of all time! We've never known anything about this man! But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family. This is no future for my son. But, Papa, you said my family would guide me. Well, de la Cruz is my family. I'm supposed to play music. Never! That man's music was a curse. I will not allow it. If you would just let... Miguel... You will listen to your family. No more music. Just listen to me play! End of argument.  You want to end up like that man? Forgotten? Left off your family's ofrenda?  I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda.    No! Mama!    There. No guitar. No music.  Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family. I don't want to be in this family! Miguel! Miguel!    I want to play in the plaza, like de la Cruz. Can I still sign up? You got an instrument? No. But if I can borrow a guitar... Musicians got to bring their own instruments.  You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list. Can I borrow your guitar? Sorry, muchacho.  You guys have a spare guitar? No. I need a guitar just for a little bit. Get out of here, kid.   Greatgreatgrandfather, what am I supposed to do?  No, no, no, no. Dante, stop! Callate! Shh!     I'm sorry.    Senor de la Cruz, please don't be mad. I'm Miguel. Your greatgreat grandson. I need to borrow this. Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand but I know you would have. You would have told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment! So, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza. Just like you did!  The guitar! It's gone!  Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar! The window's broken. Look!   All right, who's in there? I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like. De la Cruz is my...  There's nobody here.   Miguel! Mama!  Miguel, come home. Where are you, Miguel?   Dios mio!  Little boy. Are you okay? Here. Let me help you. Thanks. I...    Do you mind? Whoa!      Look how big she's getting.   Dante! You can see me? Wait!  What's going on? Dante!  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Miguel? Miguel? Miguel?  You're here? Here, here. And you can see us? Our Miguelitititito!  Remind me how I know you. We're your family, mijo.   Tia Rosita? Si.  Papa Julio? Hola.  Tia Victoria? He doesn't seem entirely dead.  He's not quite alive either. We need Mama Imelda. She'll know how to fix this. Oye! It's Mama Imelda. She couldn't cross over.  She's stuck! On the other side! Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe? Oh. Hey, Miguel.  I have a feeling this has something to do with you. But if Mama Imelda can't come to us... Then we are going to her. Vamonos!    Whoa. Come on, Miguel. It's okay.   Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up! You got to stay with me, boy. We don't know... where... This isn't a dream then. You're all really out there. You thought we weren't? Well, I don't know. I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids. Like vitamins. Miguel, vitamins are a real thing. Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be.  Mija, it's not nice to stare at... Ay! Santa Maria!  Are those... Alebrijes! But those are... Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures. They guide souls on their journey. Watch your step. They make caquitas everywhere. Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.  Please have all offerings ready for reentry.  Welcome back. Anything to declare? Some churros. From my family. How wonderful. Next. If you are experiencing travel issues,  agents at the Department of Family...  Reunions are available to assist you.  Next family, please.  Oh! Your photos are on your son's ofrenda.  Have a great visit. Gracias.  And remember to return before sunrise.  Enjoy your visit.  Next.  Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.  Enjoy your visit. Gracias.  Next? Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo. Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.  Well, shoot, looks like no one put up your photo, Frida. Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now, that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that. No photo on an ofrenda,  no crossing the bridge. I'm just gonna zip right over. You won't even know I'm gone. Hey!    Almost... there. Just a little further.   Upsydaisy... Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares? Dumb flower bridge! Aw. I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo. Next? Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn. Welcome back, amigos.  Anything to declare? As a matter of fact, yes.  Hola.  Paging Marta GonzalesRamos.  Please report to Level Seven.  Whoa!  I miss my nose.  Come on, help us out, amigo.  We got to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight. We are not visiting your exwife's family for Dia de Muertos!  I demand to speak to the person in charge! I'm sorry, senora, it says here no one put up your photo. My family always puts my photo on the ofrenda.  That devil box tells you nothing but lies! Mama Imelda?  Oh, mi familia!  They wouldn't let me cross the bridge. Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda.  Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.  What? We ran into...  Miguel? Mama Imelda. What is going on? You the Rivera family?  Well, you're cursed.  What? Dia de los Muertos is the night to give to the dead. You stole from the dead! But I wasn't stealing the guitar. Guitar? It was my greatgreatgrandfather's. He would have wanted me to have it. Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak of that musician. He is dead to this family. Uh, you're all dead.  I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that? That's just Dante. He sure doesn't look like an alebrije. He just looks like a plain old dog. Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop. Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic. But Dante doesn't have any hair. And I don't have a nose, and yet, here we are.  But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over. Oh!   You took my photo off the ofrenda?  It was an accident! How do we send him back? Well, since it's a family matter... the way to undo a family curse is to get your family's blessing. That's it? Get your family's blessing and everything should go back to normal. But you got to do it by sunrise.  What happens at sunrise? Hijole! Your hand!   Whoa, Miguel, can't have you fainting on us. But not to worry. Your family's here. You can get your blessing right now. Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.  Aha! Perdon, senora.  Oh.  Now, you look at the living and say his name. Miguel. Nailed it. Now say, ""I give you my blessing."" I give you my blessing. I give you my blessing to go home... to put my photo back on the ofrenda,  and to never play music again. What? She can't do that! Well, technically, she can add any condition she wants. Fine. Then you hand the petal to Miguel.   No skeletons!  Mariachi Plaza, here I come.  Two seconds and you already break your promise. This isn't fair. It's my life. You already had yours. Papa Julio, I ask for your blessing.  Tia Rosita? Oscar?  Felipe? Tia Victoria? Don't make this hard, mijo.  You go home my way or no way. You really hate music that much? I will not let you go down the same path he did. The same path he did. He's family. Listen to your Mama Imelda. She's just looking out for you. Be reasonable. Con permiso,  I need to visit the restroom. Be right back. Uh, should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?   Vamonos.  We got a family looking for a living boy. If I want to be a musician, I need a musician's blessing. We got to find my greatgreatgrandpa. Hold it, muchacho.    I found that living boy! Oh, whoa, excuse me. Excuse me, folks. Excuse me. Oh. No, no. Dante! Disturbing the peace. Fleeing an officer. Falsifying a unibrow. That's illegal? Very illegal. You need to clean up your act, amigo.  Amigo? Oh, that's so nice to hear you say that because I have just had a... really hard Dia de Muertos  and I could really use an amigo right now.  And amigos,  they help their amigos.  You get me across that bridge tonight, and I'll make it worth your while. Oh! You like de la Cruz? He and I go way back. I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular show. I'll get you backstage. You can meet him. You just got to let me cross that bridge! I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday. But my shift's almost up and I want to visit my living family. So I'm letting you off with a warning. Can I at least get my costume back? Uh... No. Some amigo.  Hey! Hey! You really know de la Cruz? Who wants to... Ahh! Ay! You're alive! Shh! Yeah, I'm alive. And if I want to get back to the Land of the Living... I need de la Cruz's blessing. That's weirdly specific. He's my greatgreatgrandfather.  He's your Gr... What? Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.  Wait. No, wait, wait, wait. Wait! Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living! You know what? Maybe this isn't such a good... No, no, nino! Nino, nino, I can help you. You can help me. We can help each other. But most importantly, you can help me. Miguel! I'm Hector. That's nice.  Esperame, chamaco!   Ay, he is going to get himself killed. I need my spirit guide... Pepita.   Who has that petal Miguel touched?  Here. Nice alebrije.     Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver.  Look up, up, up.  Aqui arriba, eso...  Eh, la rayita.  Okay. Hey! Tada! Dead as a doorknob. So listen, Miguel, this place runs on memories. When you're well remembered, people put up your photo and you get to... cross the bridge and visit the living on Dia de Muertos.  Unless you're me. You don't get to cross over? No one's ever put up my picture. But you can change that! This is you? Eh, muy guapo, eh? So, you get me to my greatgreatgrandpa... then I put up your photo when I get home? Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! One hiccup. De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to and I need to cross the bridge soon. Like, tonight. So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more, eh, accessible? Mmm... Nope. Don't yank my chain, chamaco.  You got to have some other family. Only de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself.  Oh! Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine! I'll get you to your greatgreatgrandpa. It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. What are you doing? I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in. No. Skeletons don't walk like that. It's how you walk. No, I don't! Stop it! Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular? Que padre!   Every year your greatgreatgrandpa puts on that dumb show... to mark the end of Dia de Muertos.  And you can get us in! Um... Hey, you said you have front row tickets! That... was a lie. I apologize for that. Cool off, chamaco.  Come on. I'll get you to him. How? Because I happen to know where he's rehearsing.  Remember me Don't let it make you cry   You better have my dress, Hector. Hola, Ceci.   Hola.  Ceci, I lost the dress. Ya lo sabia!  I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise. Thanks to you, I'm one Frida short of an opening number! Dante! We shouldn't be in here.    No, no, Dante! Ven aca!   You! How did you get in here? I just followed my... Oh! The mighty Xolo dog! Guider of wandering spirits. And whose spirit have you guided to me? I don't think he's a spirit guide. Ah, ah, ah. The alebrijes of this world can take many forms. They are as mysterious as they are powerful.  Or maybe he's just a dog. Come, I need your eyes. You are the audience. Darkness. And from the darkness, a giant papaya. Dancers emerge from the papaya, and the dancers are all me. And they go to drink from the milk of their mother, who is a cactus. But who is also me. And her milk is not milk but tears. Is it too obvious? I think it's just the right amount of obvious? It could use some music. Oh, what if you did like...    Oh! And then it could go...   And what if everything was on fire?  Yes! Fire! Everywhere! Inspired! You have the spirit of an artist.  The dancers exit. The music fades, the lights go out. And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!  Huh? He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers... Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz? Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals! He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.  Chamaco, you can't run off on me like that. Stop pestering the celebrities. You said my greatgreatgrandpa would be here! He's halfway across town throwing some big party. That bum. Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal? If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you? He's your greatgreatgrandpa, how come he didn't invite you? Hey, Gustavo! You know anything about this party?  It's the hot ticket! But if you're not on the guest list, you're never getting in, Chorizo.  Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito!   Aha. Very funny, guys. Very funny. Chorizo?  Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on. Ask him how he died. I don't want to talk about it. He choked on some chorizo!   I didn't choke, okay? I got food poisoning which is a big difference.  This is why I don't like musicians. Bunch of selfimportant jerks. Hey! I'm a musician! You are? If you really want to get to Ernesto, there is that music competition... at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party. No, no. Chamaco,  you're loco if you think... I need to get my greatgreatgrandfather's blessing! You know where I can get a guitar? I know a guy.  Have you found him, Pepita? Have you found our boy?  A footprint! It's a Rivera boot. Size seven! And a half. Pronated. Miguel. Why the heck would you want to be a musician? My greatgreatgrandpa was a musician! Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. No thank you. No! Guacala!   What do you know? So, how far is this guitar anyway? We're almost there.  Keep up, chamaco. Come on.   Cousin Hector! Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio!  Â¿Que onda?  These people are all your family? Uh... In a way. We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas.  No family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? So, we all call each other cousin, or tio, or whatever.   Hector! Tia Chelo!  Muchas gracias!  Hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharron around? Eh, in the bungalow. I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors. Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Hector?   Buenas noches, Chicharron! I don't want to see your stupid face, Hector. Come on. It's Dia de Muertos.  I brought you a little offering. Get out of here. I would, Cheech. But the thing is, me and my friend, Miguel... We really need to borrow your guitar. My guitar? Yes. My prized beloved guitar? I promise we'll bring it right back. Like the time you promised to bring back my van? Uh... Or my minifridge? Ah, you see... Or my good napkins? My lasso? My femur? Well, no, not like those times. Where is my femur? You...  Whoa, whoa. You okay, amigo?  I'm fading, Hector. I can feel it. I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to. You play me something. No. You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar is for the kid. You want it, you got to earn it. Ay, only for you, amigo.   Any requests?  You know my favorite, Hector.   Well, everyone knows Juanita   Her eyes each a different color   Her teeth stick out And her chin goes in   And her...   Knuckles they drag on the floor  Those aren't the words. There are children present.  Her hair is like a briar   She stands in a bowlegged stance   And if I weren't so ugly   She'd possibly give me a chance    Brings back memories. Gracias.    Wait. What happened? He's been forgotten. When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you... you disappear from this world. We call it the final death. Where did he go? No one knows. But I've met him. I could remember him when I go back! No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.  Our memories, they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life... in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories. Hey, it happens to everyone eventually. Come on, de la Cruzcito, you've got a contest to win. You told me you hated musicians. You never said you were one. How do you think I knew your greatgreatgrandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows. No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz... the greatest musician of all time? Ah, you're funny. Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe. But his music? Eh, not so much. You don't know what you're talking about. Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz! Showtime, chamaco!   Llevelo!  Tshirts! Bobbleheads!   Bienvenidos a todos!  Oh!  Who's ready for some musica?   It's a battle of the bands, amigos.  The winner gets to play for the maestro himself, Ernesto de la Cruz... at his fiesta tonight! That's our ticket, muchacho.  Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Let the competition begin!     So, what's the plan? What are you gonna play? Definitely Remember Me.  No! Not that one. No. Come on. It's his most popular song! Ah, it's too popular.  Remember me Though I have to travel far    Remember me...    Don't let it make you cry...     What about Poco Loco?  Epa! Now that's a song! De la Cruzcito? You're on standby. Los Chachalacos, you're up next. Los Chachalacos!   You always this nervous before a performance? I don't know.  I've never performed before. What? You said you were a musician! I am! I mean, I will be. Ay!  Once I win. That's your plan? No. You have to win. Your life literally depends on... you winning. And you've never done this before! I'll go up there. No! I need to do this. Why? If I can't go out and play one song, how can I call myself a musician? What does that matter? Because I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing... I need to prove that I'm worthy of it. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment at such a bad time!  Okay! Okay. You want to perform? Then you got to perform! First, you have to loosen up. Shake off those nerves.   Now give me your best grito.  My best grito?  Come on, yell! Belt it out.  Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you.  Oh, come on, kid.   De la Cruzcito, you're on now! Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me. You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go. Make them listen, chamaco.  You've got this. De la Cruzcito    What's he doing? Why isn't he playing? Bring back the singing dogs!    Que bien! Vamonos! Whoo!   What color is the sky? Ay mi amor, ay mi amor   You tell me that it's red Ay mi amor, ay mi amor   Where should I put my shoes? Ay mi amor, ay mi amor   You say put them on your head   Ay mi amor, ay mi amor   You make me un poco loco Un poquititito loco   The way you keep me guessing I'm nodding and I'm yesing   I'll count it as a blessing   That I'm only un poco loco  No! No! No!  Not bad for a dead guy! Not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!    He's close! Find him!  The loco that you make me It is just un poco crazy   The sense that you're not making   The liberties you're taking   Leaves my cabeza shaking You're just un poco loco    We're looking for a living kid. About twelve? Have you seen a living boy?  Un poquititititititi tititito loco     Hey! You did good! I'm proud of you. Eso!    Otra! Otra! Otra!  Hey! Where are you going? We got to get out of here! What? Are you crazy? We're about to win this thing. Damas y caballeros,  I have an emergency announcement. Please be on the lookout for a living boy. Answers to the name of Miguel. Earlier tonight he ran away from his family. They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living. Wait, wait. You said de la Cruz was your only family. The only person who could send you home. I do have other family, but... You could have taken my photo back this whole time? But they hate music! I need a musician's blessing. You lied to me! Oh, you're one to talk. Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel. I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night. I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge because... you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy. It's not stupid! I'm taking you to your family. Let go of me! You'll thank me later. You don't want to help me. You only care about yourself! Keep your dumb photo. Stay away from me! No!  Hey, chamaco!  Where did you go? Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!  Dante, callate! No! Dante, stop it. He can't help me. Dante! Stop!  Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide. You're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here! It's him! It's that living boy! I heard about him. Look! He's alive! He's alive. The boy is alive!     This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home. I don't want your blessing! Miguel, stop!  Come back! Miguel!  I am trying to save your life! You're ruining my life! What? Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you want to take it away. You'll never understand.   Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona   No dejare de quererte...   I thought you hated music. Oh, I loved it! I remember that feeling... when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly there was something in my life that... mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world. We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted. Now you must make a choice. But I don't want to pick sides! Why can't you be on my side? That's what family's supposed to do. Support you. But you never will. Have a good time. Oh, how exciting! Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan! You mind if I...  Gracias, Senor.  Invitation? It's okay. I'm Ernesto's greatgreatgrandson.     Disculpen, senores...  Hey, guys! It's poco loco! You were on fire tonight! You too! Hey, musician to musician... I need a favor. Oh, the competition winners. Congratulations, chicos.     Thanks, guys!    Whoa! Hey! Enjoy the party, little musico!  Gracias!  Oh! Oh! Look! It's Ernesto! De la Cruz! Senor de la Cruz! Pardon me! Senor de la Cruz! Senor de la...  When you see your moment,  you mustn't let it pass you by.  You must seize it.  This one has a wise spirit.   We're almost there, Dante.   Senor de la Cruz! Senor de la... But what can we do? It is hopeless...  You must have faith, sister.  But Padre, he will never listen.  He will listen... to music.        Senoras y senores, Buenas tardes, Buenas noches   Buenas tardes, Buenas noches Senoritas y senores   To be here with you tonight Brings me joy! Que alegria   For this music is my language   And the world es mi familia   For this music is my language   And the world es mi familia   For this music is my language   And the world es mi familia   For this music is my Lang...       Are you all right, nino?    It's you! You are that boy! The one who came from the Land of the Living. You... know about me? You are all anyone has been talking about. Why have you come here? I'm Miguel.  Your greatgreatgrandson.  I... have a greatgreatgrandson? I need your blessing so I can go back home and be a musician. Just like you. The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen.  But I hoped you would. My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen? Aww!  I have a greatgreatgrandson!  Look! It's Frida! Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. It is an honor, Senora.  Gracias.   Hey, Negrete! Infante! Have you met my greatgreatgrandson? My greatgreatgrandson. He's alive! And a musician to boot! Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple. No dimple!  To our friendship.  I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!  Poison! You know, I did all my own stunts.  Though I have to say goodbye Remember me...   All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living. They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with! Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much? You look overwhelmed. No! It's all great! But? It's just...  I have been looking up to you my whole life. You're the guy who actually did it! But did you ever regret it? Choosing music over everything else? It was hard. Saying goodbye to my hometown. Heading off on my own... Leaving your family? Si. But I could not have done it differently. One cannot deny who one is meant to be. And you, my greatgreatgrandson, are meant to be a musician! You and I, we are artists, Miguel. We cannot belong to one family. The world is our family. Ooh! Ooh! The fireworks have begun! Soon the party will move across town for my Sunrise Spectacular. Miguel, you must come to the show! You will be my guest of honor! You mean it? Of course, my boy. I can't. I have to get home before sunrise. Oh! I really do need to get you home. It has been an honor. I am sorry to see you go, Miguel. I hope you die very soon.  You know what I mean. Miguel, I give you my bless... We had a deal, chamaco.  Who are you? What is the meaning of this? Oh, Frida! I thought you couldn't make it. You said you'd take back my photo. You promised, Miguel. You know this, uh, man? Uh, I just met him tonight. He told me he knew you. Hector? Please, Miguel. Put my photo up. My friend, you're being forgotten. And whose fault is that? Hector, please... Those were my songs you took. My songs that made you famous. What? If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them! That's crazy! De la Cruz wrote all his own songs. You want to tell him or should I? Hector, I never meant to take credit. We made a great team, but you died... and I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive. Oh, how generous! You really did play together. I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up, and I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl. Ernesto, remember the night I left? That was a long time ago. We drank together and you told me you would move Heaven and Earth... for your amigo.  Well, I'm asking you to now. Heaven and Earth? Like in the movie? What? That's Don Hidalgo's toast. In the de la Cruz movie, El Camino a Casa.  I'm talking about my real life, Miguel. No! It's in there. Look! Never were truer words spoken.  This calls for a toast. To our friendship!  I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink. Salud! Poison!  That night, Ernesto. The night I left... We'd been performing on the road for months.  I got homesick...  and I packed up my songs.  You want to give up now when we're this close to reaching our dream? This was your dream. You'll manage. I can't do this without your songs, Hector. I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up.  Oh, I could never hate you. If you must go, then I'm sending you off with a toast. To our friendship. I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!  You walked me to the train station.  But I felt a pain in my stomach.  I thought it must have been something I ate.  Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend. Or something I drank.  I woke up dead.  You poisoned me. You're confusing movies with reality, Hector. All this time, I thought it was just bad luck. I never thought that you might have... That you...    How could you? Hector! Security! Security! You took everything away from me! You rat! Have him taken care of. He's not well. I just wanted to go back home. No! No! I apologize. Where were we? You were going to give me your blessing. Yes. Uh, Si.  Miguel, uh, my reputation... It is very important to me. I would hate to have you think... That you murdered Hector for his songs?  You don't think that. Do you? I... No. Everyone knows you're the good guy. Papa Ernesto, my blessing? Security? Take care of Miguel. He'll be extending his stay. What? But I'm your family! And Hector was my best friend. Success doesn't come for free, Miguel. You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to seize your moment.  I know you understand. No! No!  Let go! No!   Help! Can anyone hear me? I want to go home.    Hector? Kid? Oh, Hector! You were right. I should have gone back to my family. They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen. I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.  Hey, chamaco.  It's okay. It's okay. I told them I didn't care.  Hector! Hector? She's forgetting me. Who? My daughter. She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge. I just wanted to see her again. I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her papa was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. My Coco... Coco? Where did you get this? That's my Mama Coco. That's my Mama Imelda. Is that you? We're... Family? I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me. Maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. You know the worst part? Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug. But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world... You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her. Ever again. You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time. No matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her one... last... time.  Remember me   Though I have to say goodbye Remember me   Don't let it make you cry   For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart   I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart   Remember me  Papa!   Though I have to travel far Remember me   Each time you hear a sad guitar   Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be   Until you're in my arms again   Remember me   He stole your guitar. He stole your songs. You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz! I didn't write Remember Me  for the world. I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a greatgreatgrandpa. Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade. My whole life, there's been something... that made me different. And I never knew where it came from. But now I know. It comes from you. I'm proud we're family! I'm proud to be his family!   I'm proud to be his family!    Dante?  Dante!  It's Dante!    Imelda! Hector. You look good.   Dante! You knew he was my Papa Hector the whole time! You are a real spirit guide. Who's the good spirit guide? You are!    Whoa!   Dante!    There they are! Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel! He's all right. Gracias, Dios mio. Que bueno.       Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time. And you... How many times must I turn you away? Imelda. I want nothing to do with you! Not in life, not in death! I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole! I wasn't in there because of Hector. He was in there because of me. He was just trying to get me home! I didn't want to listen, but he was right. Nothing's more important than family. I'm ready to accept your blessing. And your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get Hector's photo. What? So he can see Coco again. Hector should be on our ofrenda.  He's part of our family. He left this family! He tried to go home to you and Coco. But de la Cruz murdered him! It's true, Imelda. And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise... and I'm just supposed to forgive you? Imelda, I...  Hector!   I'm running out of time. It's Coco. She's forgetting you. You don't have to forgive him. But we shouldn't forget him. I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but... This is my fault. Not yours. I'm sorry, Imelda. Miguel, if we help you get his photo, you will return home? No more music? Family comes first. I can't forgive you. But I will help you. So, how do we get to de la Cruz? I might know a way.      Good luck, muchacho.  Gracias, Frida.     Here, let me help you with... Don't touch me! Everyone clear on the plan? Find Hector's photo. Give it to Miguel. Send Miguel home. Got your petals?  Now, we just have to find de la Cruz. Yes?  Don't I know you? That's for murdering the love of my life! Who... Who the... She's talking about me! I'm the love of your life? I don't know. I'm still angry at you. Hector! How did you...  And that's for trying to murder my grandson. Grandson? She's talking about me! You! Wait. You're related to Hector? The photo! Uh... After him!  Security! Ayudenme!  You said love of your life. I don't know what I said. That's what I heard.  Places, Senor.  You're on in thirty seconds.     Ay! Miguel! I have it!    Oh!  Hurry! Come on! Ladies and gentlemen...  the one... the only... Ernesto de la Cruz!   Get her off the stage.   Sing! Sing!  Ay, de mi Llorona   Llorona de azul Celeste   Ay, de mi Llorona    Llorona de azul Celeste   Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona   No dejare de quererte   No dejare de quererte    Me subi Al pino mas alto, Llorona   A ver Si Te divisaba   Como El pino era tierno, Llorona   Al verme llorar, lloraba   Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul Celeste   Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul Celeste   Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona   No dejare de quererte  Let go of me!  Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona   No dejare de quererte   No dejare de quererte   No dejare de quererte   Ay, ay, ay      I forgot what that felt like. You still got it.  Oh. Miguel, I give you my blessing. To go home, to put up our photos and to never... Never play music again. To never forget how much your family loves you. You're going home. You're not going anywhere.  Imelda! Stay back! Stay back! All of you, stay back. Not one more step.  Dante!  Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone. I've worked too hard, Hector. Too hard to let him destroy everything. He's a living child, Ernesto. He's a threat!  You think I'd let him go back  to the Land of the Living with your photo?  To keep your memory alive? No. You're a coward! I am Ernesto de la Cruz. The greatest musician of all time! Hector's the real musician. You're just the guy who murdered him  and stole his songs!   Murdered? I am the one who's willing to do what it takes to seize my moment. Whatever it takes.  No!  Miguel! Apologies, old friend. But the show must go on.        Please, please, mi familia.  Murderer!  Orchestra. Aone, atwo, aone...   Remember me Though I have to s...   Hey!  Look!   Nice kitty.   Put me down! No, please! I beg of you! Stop! Stop! No!  No! No!      What did I miss? Good boy, Dante! Miguel!  Hector! The photo... I lost it! It's okay, mijo.  It's o...  Hector! Hector? Coco. No! We can still find the photo. Miguel, it's almost sunrise. No, no. I can't leave you. I promised I'd put your photo up. I promised you'd see Coco. We're both out of time, mijo.  Oh no! No! She can't forget you! I just wanted her to know that I loved her. Hector! You have our blessing, Miguel. No conditions. No! Papa Hector, please! No! Go home. I promise I won't let Coco forget you!    There he is!  Miguel! Stop!  Where have you been?  I need to see Mama Coco, please. What are you doing with that... Give it to me! Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel!  Mama Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel. I saw your papa.  Remember? Papa?  Please! If you forget him, he'll be gone. Forever. Miguel, open this door! Here. This was his guitar, right? He used to play it to you? See? There he is! Papa!  Remember? Papa?   Miguel! Mama Coco, please! Don't forget him.   What are you doing to that poor woman? It's okay, Mamita.  It's okay. What's gotten into you?  I thought I'd lost you, Miguel. I'm sorry, Papa.  We're all together now. That's what matters. Not all of us. It's okay, Mamita.  Miguel, you apologize to your Mama Coco. Mama Coco?  Well? Apologize! Mama Coco? Your papa,  he wanted you to have this.   Mama, wait!  Remember me   Though I have to say goodbye   Remember me   Don't let it make you cry   For even if I'm far away   I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you   Each night we are apart   Remember me   Though I have to travel far   Remember me   Each time you hear a sad guitar   Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be   Until you're in my arms again   Remember me    Elena? What's wrong, mija?  Nothing, Mama.  Nothing at all. My papa used to sing me that song.  He loved you, Mama Coco. Your papa loved you so much. I kept his letters. Poems he wrote me. And... Papa was a musician. When I was a little girl... he and Mama would sing such beautiful songs. And right over here, one of Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures. The home of the esteemed song writer, Hector Rivera. The letters Hector wrote home for his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics... for all of your favorite songs. Not just Remember Me.   And that man is your Papa Julio. And there's Tia Rosita and your Tia Victoria. And those two are Oscar and Felipe. These aren't just old pictures, they're our family... and they're counting on us to remember them.  Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool   Enjoy your visit, Hector.  But last night it seemed that I dreamed about you  Papa!  Coco!  When I opened my mouth what came out was a song   And you know every word and we all sang along   To a melody played on the strings of our souls   And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone   Our love for each other will live on forever   In every beat of my proud corazon   Our love for each other will live on forever    In every beat of my proud corazon   Ay mi familia Oiga mi gente   Canten a coro Let it be known   Our love for each other will live on forever   In every beat of my proud corazon   Ay mi familia Oiga mi gente   Canten a coro Let it be known   Our love for each other will live on forever   In every beat of my proud corazon     Remember me   Though I have to say goodbye Remember me   Don't let it make you cry   For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart   I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart   Remember me   Though I have to travel far Remember me   Each time you hear a sad guitar   Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be   Until you're in my arms again   Remember me    If you close your eyes and let the music play   Keep our love alive I'll never fade away   If you close your eyes and let the music play   Keep our love alive I'll never fade away   If you close your eyes and let the music play   Keep our love alive I'll never fade away   Remember me   For I will soon be gone Remember me   And let the love we have live on   And know that I'm with you the only way that I can be   So, until you're on my arms again   Remember me   Remember me   Remember me   "

Of course, I don't really remember yesterday all that well. Anyway, I would say the scariest moment of the trip was the 4 sharks. Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks. No. No, there were definitely four. But last time you told it, there were three. Son, which one of us traveled across the entire ocean? Nemo did. Obviously we had to cross the ocean... To find him, so you know... he went first. I guess that's true. Isn't it? Well, you made it! You almost missed the field trip. A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips. Where are we going? I thought you told her. I did tell her! Dory. Yeah. Mr. ray has too many fish to keep an eye on today. So it would be best if today you weren't exactly with the class. Oh. Why not? Well, you know, you have problems remembering things sometimes. That's the one thing I can remember. Yes. Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault, but it can cause you to wander. And Mr. ray doesn't really have time to worry about fish who wander. In other words, he doesn't have enough help. Poor guy. You know, he's so overworked. You understand. I totally understand now. Okay. Mmhmm. He wants me to be the teacher's assistant. No, not exactly. I am so honored. I have never been a teaching assistant before. Mr. ray! You got help. Oh. Okeydokey. All right, kids. All right, kids. Today's the day! Today's the day! Our field trip to the sting ray migration. Sting ray migration. Now, does anyone know why we migrate? Come on. You got to know this stuff. Migration is about going back to... Bed! Yes! No. No. The sand! No! Migration is about going home. Home. Which is where you're from. Where you're from. Can someone tell me where they're from? I live by a giant rock. I live 3 coral caves away from here. My house is covered in algae. Where'd you grow up, dory? Me? I don't know. My family. Where are they? Can I help you? I'm sorry. Did I forget again? You see, I suffer from__ shortterm memory loss. How can you remember your family if you have shortterm memory loss? Good question. See, I can remember some things because well... They make sense. Like I have a family. I know because I've__ I must have come from somewhere. Right? Everyone has a family. I may not remember their names and what they look like. And I may not even be able to ever find them again, but... What were we talking about? Mommies and daddies. Mommies and daddies. Right. Why are we talking about mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh! That class. Uhoh. Why me? Okay. You guys seem a little young, but okay. You see, kids, when two fish love each other__ and we'll stop right there. Climb aboard, explorers. I feel a migration song coming on. Oh... Migration, migration let's learn about migration it's nature's inspiration to move around the sea here's a scientific promise that a fish who's oceanodromous where did everyone go? I'm by myself oh there they are. I'm back plus or minus 4 degrees based on solar positioning oh, kids stay away from the edge. Okay, you hear that? Okay, everybody stay back from the edge. Come on. Okay, that's too far. That's too far. Come on. Come on. Get back over here. Back this way. Now, I need everyone to listen to me. All right, listen up! When the rays pass through here__ the rays, gonna pass through. What do we have to be careful of? Everybody has to be careful of what? Hmm? The undertow! That's right. That's right. The under__ the undertow? Because the current created by all the flapping is very strong. And if you're not careful, you can get pulled into__ Mr. ray! So how do the stingrays all know where to go? That's what an instinct is, Nemo. Something deep inside you that feels so familiar that you have to listen to it. Like a song you've always known. And I can hear mine now! To and fro, our hearts know where to go beating like a drum, it sends us back to where we're from oh... we're going home we know who we are, and it's time to travel far for days and nights we'll roam, to make our way back home oh... we're going home swimming to and fro, our hearts know where to go beating like a drum, it sends us back to where we're from we see the undertow and we say__ dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Is she dead? No, she's not dead. Aw. Oh man. Give her some space, everybody. The Jewel of morro bay, California. The Jewel of morro bay, California? I remembered something so i__ I remembered something! I actually remembered something! Something important. Something important? What? What was it? I'm not sure anymore, but I can still feel it. It's right there. All right, thank you, Mr. ray. Okay, come on. Try to remember better. Don't be such a dory, dory. Hmm. I don't know. I__ hold on. Hold on. Oh. Oh! What? Did you remember? Ugh, I don't remember. It was something__ it was__ oh, oh, oh! It was something about the__ the Jewel of morro bay, California. My family! I remember my family! They're out there somewhere. I have to find them. Guys, you got to help me. Guys! Guys! Hello? Guys! Where are you? Dory! Hello? Dory! Ah! Where did you go? You were the one to go. My parents. I remembered them. What? What did you remember? I remembered them! My mom. My dad. I have a family. They don't know where I am. Let's go. We have to go. Dory, no. No! This is crazy! Where exactly are you trying to go? To the gem of the baltic? The Jewel of morro bay, California. Yes! No, dory. California's all the way across the ocean. Then we'd better get going. How come every time we're on the edge of this reef, one of us is trying... To leave? For once, can't we just enjoy the view? How can you be talking about the view when I remembered my family? No! We've done our ocean travels. That part of our lives is over. The only reason to travel in the first place is so... You don't have to travel ever again. Yeah, but I want to__ dory, look__ please. All I know is that I miss them. I really, really miss them. I didn't know what that felt like. Do you know what that feels like? Yes, I know what that feels like. I don't want to forget this. Somewhere out there is my family. Please, marlin, i can't find them on my own. I'll forget. Please help me find my family. Yeah, dad, you can get us all the way across the ocean. Right? No. But I know a guy. Whoohoo! Righteous, righteous, righteous! Totally sick. Totally sick. I know. Isn't it great? No! I'm gonna be totally sick. It's the California current, dude. It's got some gnarly chop. Surf's up, dude! Hey, dude, if you're gonna hurl, just do me a solid... Head to the back of the shell, lean out, and go for distance. We call that ""feeding the fishes."" Correctamundo, squirt! And now we're looking for my parents at the brooch of the Atlantic? Or the__ the Jewel of morro bay, California. Exactly! How are you gonna find your parents? Do you remember what they look like? I'm a bit new to the memory thing, so I can't say for sure... But something tells me they were mostly blue, with s__ maybe yellow. That sounds right. Also I'm pretty sure I'm gonna know them when I see them. We're family. By the way crossing the ocean is the kind of thing you should... Only do once. One time! Morro bay, California's coming up, dudes. Whoohoo! Let's find my family. Go! Go! Go, go, go. Just go, dad. Don't push me, Nemo. So long, little blue! Hope you find your parents. And good luck ""feeding the fishes."" Too late. Already fed. Oh. This feels familiar. Mom! Dad! No. Dory! Dory! Wait! Wait. Mom! Dad! Stop yelling for a second. Do you really think your parents... Are just gonna be floating around here waiting for you? Well, I don't know, but there's only one way to find out. Mom! Dad! Yell louder, dory. Mom! Dad! Sh! What was that? Wait. I've heard that before. I remember someone saying, ""sh."" Yes, well done. That was me. One minute ago. Sh! Please. Have you seen my mommy and daddy? Their names are Jenny and Charlie. Sh! Jenny and Charlie. What? Jenny and what? Those are their names! My parents are Jenny and Charlie! Dory, wait! Jenny! Can't we just take a moment to come up with a plan? Jenny! Charlie! Sh! Are you crazy? Sorry, she's a little excited. Jenny! Charlie! Dory, stop yelling for a second. It's not a good idea to come into a new neighborhood... And call this much attention to yourself. You don't understand. I remembered my parent's names! Jenny! Charlie! These crabs are locals and i get the feeling they're shushing... Us for a reason. You might wake up something dangerous. Are you talking about like something with one big eye... Tentacles, and a snappy thing? Well, that's very specific, but something like that, yes. You just in general don't want to__ oh my goodness. Okay. There's a mistake. We're backing away. Let us live and we will__ we'll worship you. We'll build a__ do you like a monument? Oh! Ooh! Whoa! Swim for your life! Nemo! Nemo! Dad! Nemo! Dad! No! Nemo, hold on to me and don't let go! Dad! No, no! No! Dory! Dory, slow down! We're not being chased anymore. Are you sure? Jenny and Charlie. Jenny and Charlie! I just remembered their names! We have to keep going. We're so close. Huh? Nemo, are you hurt? Oh my goodness! Nemo! Are you okay? What happened? Not now, dory. Please! Oh no. Nemo. Oh no. Oh no. I'm okay. Oh, Nemo. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. Oh my goodness! Nemo, are you okay? I said, ""not now."" You've done enough. I have? Oh no. But I can fix it. I can. I'll go get help. You know what you can do, dory? You can go wait over there. Go wait over there and forget. It's what you do best. You're right. I don't know why I thought i could do this. Find my family. I can't do this. I'm so sorry. I'll fix it. I'm okay. Well, I'm gonna get help. Okay? Okay? I can do that. I'll be__ it'll be all right, Nemo. Hello? Someone? Hello? Anyone? Hello? Anyone? Hello. Hello? I'm sigourney Weaver. Oh. Hi, sigourney. I need your help. Won't you please join us... Oh. Great, great, great. As we explore the wonders of the pacific ocean... And the amazing life it holds within. Witness the majesty of the beluga whale. Sigourney Weaver, where are you? Dory! There you are! Guys! I found help. Sigourney Weaver's gonna tell us where we are. Look out! Oh, look at this! No respect for ocean life. Marlin! Nemo! Dory! No, no, no. Not again! Not again! Let's take her inside and see how she does. Dory! Dory! Don't worry, dory! Stay calm. We'll come find you! And welcome to the marine life institute... Where we believe in rescue, rehabilitation and release. Marlin? Nemo? Hello? Hello? Can you help me? Me help you? Huh? What's happening? Help? Looks like we're done here. Dude, cut it out. You're a scientist. We talked about this. Oh, come on. It's funny. Oh boy. Okay. This is__ I'll be fine, i just need to find a way out and... If I could just__ get a hold of yourself, get a hold of yourself. You'll be fine, everything's fine, think positively. Hey, you. Oh. Spinner. Oh, thank goodness. Hi, I'm dory. I'm__ name's Hank. How sick are you? Sick? I'm sick? Why else would you be in quarantine? Oh no! How long do I have? I have to find my family. All right. Now don't get hysterical__ uhoh. Not good. What? What is it? What happened? What's that? That there is bad news. It's a transport tag for fish who can't cut it inside the institute. They get transferred to permanent digs. An aquarium. In Cleveland. Fish in here, go back in the ocean. Cleveland fish, stay there forever. Cleveland? No! I can't go to the Cleveland. I have to get to the Jewel of morro bay, California and find my family. That's this place. The marine life institute. The Jewel of morro bay, California. You're here. You mean I'm from here? My parents are here. I have to get to them. So what exhibit are you from? Wait. I'm from an exhibit? Which one? I have to get there. Hmm. That's a hard one, kid. Unless... nah. Never work. It's too crazy. What do you mean? Just tell me. I'm okay with crazy. You know, I could see that? Well, there's one thing I can think of... To help you get to your family. If I just take__ yes! Great idea. You take me to find them. Why didn't I think of that? No, no, no. If I just take your tag... I can take your place on the transport truck then you can go back inside... And find your family. All you have to do is give me the tag. What tag? There's a tag on my fin! How could you forget you have a tag on your fin? Oh no. I'm sorry. I__ I suffer from shortterm memory loss. You don't remember what we were talking about? Mmmm. Not a clue. What were we talking about? You were about to give me your tag. Well, I kind of like my tag. Why do you want it? So I can go to__ so I can go to Cleveland. Cleveland? I hear good things about Cleveland. Why do you want to go? Because if I stay here I'm gonna get released back to the ocean. And I have extremely unpleasant memories of that place. I just want to live in a glass box alone. That's all I want. So give me your tag! Hey, man, don't touch my tag! Look... I don't work here. It's not like i have a map of this place. A map! Good idea. You take me to the map, I figure out where my parents are. Oh boy. All right. If I get you to your family will you give me__ I don't have much. I__ how about if I give you this tag? Great idea. Are you absolutely sure that's what I said? ""Go wait over there and forget. That's what you do best."" Yeah, dad. I said that? You said that, dory swam to the surface, and she got taken by some__ all right, I don't want to hear the whole story again. I was just asking about the one part because, look, if I said that__ I'm not positive I did. It's actually a compliment because... I asked her to wait and I said, ""it's what you do best."" So i__ oh, it's my fault! It's all my fault she got kidnapped and taken into whatever this place is. What if it's a restaurant? Oy! You two! Shut it! Yeah, we're trying to sleep! You interrupted my favorite dream! Is that the one about you laying on this rock? Yeah. Oh, that is a good one. Oh yeah, isn't it? Yeah. It's one of my favorites. Excuse us. Hello! We're trying to__ son! Son. Those are sea lions. They are natural predators. They could pounce at any moment. They don't look very pouncy. That's what they want you to think. Just get behind me and let me do the talking. Excuse me, we're worried about our friend. Is that a restaurant? Mate, it's not a restaurant. Your friend is okay. She is? It's a fish hospital. Sigourney Weaver says she'll be rescued, rehabilitated, and released. She'll be in and out in a jiff. We should know. Nasal parasite. Anemia. All fixed up and sent on our way. Oh thank goodness. Sure, that's all right. Don't you worry ab__ Gerald, get off the rock! Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off! Get off! Now you know better! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Don't you worry about a thing. That place is the marine life institute. The Jewel of morro bay, California. She was right. It looks like dory can do something besides forget. Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that. So how are we gonna get inside? Wait. You want to get inside mli? Desperately. Our friend is in there. Lost, alone. She's scared. She'll have no idea what to do. Oh, we know a way. You do? Oooroo. Ooorooroo. Oooroo. What are they doing? I don't know. It sounds bad. Are we there yet? Sh. Keep it down! Hank., I'm so glad I found you. It feels like__ i__ destiny. For what must be the millionth time, it's not destiny. Uhoh. Have I said ""destiny"" before? I'm sorry. I'm just so nervous because I'm gonna meet my parents. I haven't seen them in I don't even know how long because... You see I suffer from shortterm__ shortterm memory loss. Look, no more talking. Okay? I don't like talking. I don't like chatter and questions. And, ""how are you? Oh I'm fine."" ""How are you? I'm fine too."" News flash nobody's fine. Oh, I'm fine. How are you? Hank, look, there's a map! Sh! The plan is you're gonna read that and figure out where your parents live. Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland. You got it? Got it. What was the first part again? Ugh. What? The octopus escaped again? Wow. Look at all the exhibits. How can you do this park in one day? Seriously. Pick one! Okay. Well, tell everyone to keep an eye out. We're supposed to be releasing the octopus back to the ocean today. Well, of course I haven't seen him. If I was looking I'd find him. Hank! There you are. Hurry up! Okay. Okay. K. It starts with a ""k."" Kid zowny. Kid zone! No! No kids. Kids grab things. And I'm not losing another tentacle for you. You lost a tentacle? Well then you're not an octopus, you're a septopus. I may not remember, but I can count. Hurry up! Okay. Journey to the__ hey, look. Shells. Hey, look. Shells! Daddy, here's a shell for you. That's great, dory. You found another one. I did? Oh, yes, you did. You're getting good at this, dory. Hey, look. Shells! Hey, I live there. Yes! Yes, indeed. I like shells. That's right, dear. Do you think you could find me another shell? Purple ones are my favorite. Okay, mommy. Mommy. Purple shell. Purple shell! Hey, my home had a purple shell. So what? Half the exhibits here have purple shells in them. No, no, no. You don't understand. I remember her now. Purple shells were her favorite and she had this adorable giggle. And then my dad was really friendly. And now your wacky memory's gonna get us caught. Still think this is destiny? Hank, we have to find my folks! Quiet! Ugh. Base, this is Carol. I think I might have found that missing octopus. Over. See what you did? Sorry. This could not be worse. Hmm. ""Destiny."" Destiny. Hank. I got a feeling. I think we should get in the bucket. No. Stop. Seriously. It says ""destiny"" and it is__ no, no, no, no, no. We've got to get in that bucket. I'm not going with you in that bucket. Here...I...Go...In...The...Bucket. Bye. Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family. Oh, good idea. Play dead. I'm sorry. I got to blink. How do you hold your eyes open that long? Hey, guys. Wait a second. Our next guest has been here a very long time. She's a whale shark. Her name is destiny. Destiny? Really? You'll notice she's extremely nearsighted and has trouble... Navigating her environment. Oh! And here she comes now. Ooh! Destiny. You're a fish? Wait. What? Hi! Hello there. Whoa! Oh. Whoa. All right, I'll go with you. Excuse me. Is that blue blob talking? Can you help me? I lost my family. You lost your family? Well, it's a long story, and truth be told, i don't remember most of it. Aw, that is so sad. You poor thi__ sorry. Not a great swimmer. I can't see very well. Oh, I think you swim beautifully. In fact, I've never seen a fish swim like that before. Thank you. You're welcome. Wait. Say that again. You're welcome. Dory? Yes. Dory? Yes. Dory? Yes. Dory! Yes. You and I were friends! No! Dory, it's me! Destiny! You know me? Of course! We talked through the pipes when we were little. We were pipe pals! We were? Aw, you're so pretty. So you know where I'm from? Yep, you are from the open ocean exhibit. I'm from the open ocean exhibit? Then that's where my parents are. We got to go. Can you take me there? Kind of tough for a whale to travel around here. Can you please keep it down over there? My head hurts. Who's that? That's my neighbor, Bailey. He was brought in with a head injury. I know you're talking about me, destiny. He thinks he can't use his echolocation, but I've overheard... The doctors talking. There's not a thing wrong with him. Hear every word you're saying about me. What's echolocation? Bailey's head is supposed to put out a call and the echo helps him... Find objects far away. Oh, but apparently he's still ""healing."" Now I know you're talking about me. I really can't echolocate. I cannot have this conversation again. I just can't. I hit my head very hard out there. See how swollen it is! Your head is supposed to be big! You're a beluga! Echolocation. Oh, like the world's most powerful pair of glasses? What? What are glasses? It's sort of like you go, ""hoo"" and then you see things. Why do I know that? Oh. That's interesting. There you are! Listen up, you and I are square. I took you to the map, now give me that tag! Wait, no. I know where my parents are. They're in the__ what's it called? The place__ the soap and lotion? Open ocean. Open ocean! Open ocean! I know where that is. That's the exhibit located right next to__ i don't care. Easy! If you're trying to get to the open ocean exhibit go through the pipes. Through the pipes. Great. Through the pipes? Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight and you'll hit it. Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's__ did you get that, Hank? All that? Yeah. Great! Let's go. I'm not going with you. I won't fit. You have to go by yourself. That's__ I'm__ i__ see, I can't because I'm not so good with directions. Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal. You wanted to find your parents? That's how you get to them. Now give me your tag. But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone. I'll forget where I'm going. Not my problem. Tag! But I can't get in that way. I'm sorry, but there's no other way. There's no other way. There's no other way. Now, now. Don't panic. It's okay. Not everything in life is easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie? She's right. When something's too hard, you should just give up. Charlie! A joke. I'm kidding! Just a joke. A joke. Caution, joker at work. Joke. I got it. You see, kelpcake? There's always another way. Thank you, daddy. Thank you, daddy. Nope. My father said there's always another way. What? There is no other way. Open ocean. Open ocean. Open ocean. I'm pretty sure it's the building over there. That's illdefined and roundish. Like Bailey's head. Wait, what? Always another way. There's__ there! Guys, follow me. I know how we can get to locomotion. Open ocean. Exactly. Guys. You know I can't swim over there, right? Oooroo, oooroo, oooroo. I don't see how this is going to get us inside. What are you even doing? We're calling her over, of course. Calling her over? Calling who over? Lads, meet Becky. Flying? No, no, no new information. Listen, tell her thank you. You guys have gone above and beyond. Really. But is there a way to get in that involves, like, swimming? Because that's really our strength. Look, your friend is going to be in quarantine. That's where they take the sick fish. And the one and only one way into that place is Becky. Hi, Becky. Ow! Stop. Let's call her pecky because this is hurting. I think she likes you, dad. Becky, love? These two nice fish need to get into quarantine. Are you free today, Rebecca darling? Becky, is__ would that work with your schedule? Ow! She doesn't understand what I'm saying. All you have to do is imprint with her, mate. Imp__ what? Imprint. Look her in the eye and say, ""oooroo"" and she'll be in sync with you. Now look her in the eye. Yeah. Nemo, I think we should devise an alternate plan. One that involves staying in the water and someone sane. Because this bird, this bird... This ain't the bird! That's fine, dad. And in the meantime, dory will just forget us. Like you said, it's what she does best. Fine. Okay, look her in the eye. Which eye? Just pick one, mate. Becky. Ooh. Oooroo. Rooroo, Becky. Okay, this is all great. How exactly is Becky supposed to carry us? Oh yeah. I almost forgot. Gerald! Hmm? Yeah, Gerald. Come on, son. Hmm? Come on, Gerald. Give us your pail, we'll let you sit on the rock. Yeah, Gerald. We swear it. Hmm. That's right. Shimmy on over here. Come on. You can do it. That's right. Mind you don't scuff your bum. Thank you so much, Gerald. Welcome to your time on this rock. Comfortable, isn't it? Time's up! Get off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Time's up! Now get off, Gerald! Off! No, this is nuts! Why do I keep getting talked into insane choices? Good luck! Okay, when I tell you you're gonna__ yeah. I know. I'm gonna signal with a big splash. On my mark. Not clear yet. Not clear yet. Now? Not 'til destiny gives the signal. You know something? I have no idea why you're even doing this. What do you mean? It seems like a lot of trouble just to find some more fish. If I had shortterm memory loss... I'd just swim off into the blue and forget everything. Well I don't want to do that. I want my family. Not me, kid. I don't want anyone to worry about. You're lucky. No memories. No problems. Huh. No memories. No problems. Still not clear. Still not clear. You don't have to say when it's not time. Not__ just tell me when it is time. Okay, here we go. And__ wait! ""Here we go. Wait."" Are you serious? Okay, on the count of three. Don't count. Just say, ""go."" Go! Now, now. Do it! Do it! What? Okay, okay. Wow. Look at that! I mean__ that's the signal. Go, go, go! That's the signal! Now remember, destiny said follow the signs to the open ocean exhibit. I can't see squat, so it's your job to look for it. Got it. Follow the signs to open ocean. I'm just gonna repeat it, okay? That should work. Follow the signs to open ocean. Follow the signs to open ocean. Mm. Go right! Follow the signs to open ocean. Follow the signs to open ocean. Follow the signs to open ocean. Left! Follow the signs to open ocean. And steer clear of people, will you? Especially kids. I don't want to be touched. Sh! Do not mess me up! Oh, poor baby. Let me get that for you. Here you__ oh! Oh my. Where do we go? Where do we go? Oh, sorry! Okay, I was looking, looking... Rooroo, Becky! Drop us anywhere. We're okay. Just wait, dad. I think she's looking for a place to land. She's confused, Nemo. She doesn't even know which way to look. Wait, Becky. What are you doing? Oooroo. Ooorooroorooroo. Okay. I was going somewhere. The question is where. Which way? Do you see the sign? I'm looking. I'm looking. Something to something gets me to my family! ""The world's most powerful pair of__"" I know that. Why do I know that? It's another memory. Hank, we need to go that way! Left. Go left. Becky! Oooroo. Oooroo. She can't hear you, dad. All right. New plan. We have to get closer to Becky so she can hear us. I don't think we should move the pail. Nemo. Without me Becky's lost. Dad, just trust her. Trust her? So she can forget us all together? I trust Becky. You trust her? Becky's eating a cup! Becky! Becky! Oooroo! Whoa! Well, at least we're not stuck in the bucket anymore. Or on top of quarantine. The baby otter talk is beginning now. Why, thanks, sigourney Weaver. Hey, who wants to learn about otters? Looking for the world's most powerful pair of glasses. Otters! Welcome, it's a huge cuddle party! Cuddle party! I'm in! Where are we? Are we close to open ocean? Yes. I think__ well, I don't know. But I saw that other sign so__ what? What other sign? The world's most powerful pair of glasses. What? What are you talking about? Why would we follow that sign? Well, because I remembered it. No. That wasn't the plan. Ow! All right, that's it! You have wasted my time! Wait. No. That transport truck leaves at dawn... And I'm not missing it, so give me your tag. Wait. No, I remembered that sign. So? So I'm remembering more... And more and I feel like my memory's getting better. I think we should__ no! Your memory is not working. You can't remember anything. It's probably how you lost your family in the first place! All right, look, let's just take it down a notch. Just give me the tag and__ you know something, for a guy with three hearts you're not very nice. Three hearts? What are you talking about? I don't have three hearts. Yes, you do. I don't! You do! Don't! Do! Stop saying that! Fun fact the octopus has three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills while the third pumps... Blood throughout the body. Wait! Kid zone you know, someone with three hearts shouldn't be so mean. And it's mean to say that i would lose someone I love! Touch pool I did not lose them! Hank? Hank? Hank? Hans. No. Not hans. I'm looking for Hank. Hans. Hank. With a ""k."" Hank. Hands! Hands? Oh, oh, oh, hands! Hank! Hank? My arm! Hank! Where are you? Hank! Oh! Can you please help me? I'm looking for__ please help me. I've lost my friend frank. I'm sorry, not frank. You're in my space! He's an octopus. No, septo__ septopus. That's right. He's a septopus. Septopus. Septopus. Septopus. One, two, three, four, five, six, s__ septopus! He's camouflaged! Hank. Come on, Hank! Let's get out of here. Dory, what are you doing? Hank! What's the plan? The plan is I'm gonna stay here forever. Okay. Good plan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry. I can't remember right. Sweetie. Sweetie. Oh, watch out, kelpcake. Oh, watch where you're going. I'm sorry, daddy. I'm sorry I can't remember right. Oh, sweetie. Sweetie, you don't need to be sorry. You know what you need to do? Just keep swimming. Yeah.

Sorry for what? What? You're okay? Yes! I found marlin and Nemo! Dad! Did you hear that? Dory really does speak whale. I heard. It's bringing back some very bad memories so let's get out of here.

No. Mollusk? No. Something? No. I don't... no? No clam. We were having a very hard time until Nemo thought... ""What would dory do?"" Why would you say that? Because ever since I've met you, you've shown me how to do... Stuff I never dreamed of doing. Crazy things! Outsmarting sharks and jumping jellyfish. And finding my son. You made all that happen. Really? I didn't know you thought that. Unless I forgot. No, you didn't forget. I never told you. And I'm sorry about that. But, dory, because of who you are, you are about to find your parents. And when you do that, you'll be home. Dad. Does this mean we have to say goodbye to dory? Yes, Nemo. We do. Marine life institute hey, so how much more we got left to load? Just this last row.

Honey, why do you think we stayed put here all these years? Because we believed one day you'd find us again. Exactly! But I thought you were gone. How did you__ we went into quarantine to look for you, but you weren't there. And we knew you must have gotten out through the pipes. Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie. And so we did too. And we've stayed in this spot for you ever since. We thought you might come back. We stayed and waited for you. So every day, we go out and lay out... Shells. And you found us. Oh honey, you found us. And you know why you found us? Because you remembered. You remembered in your own, amazing, dory way. I did. All by myself. Oh, honey. Really? Have you been by yourself all these years? Oh, my poor little girl. Oh, I haven't been all by myself__ marlin and Nemo! Nobody saw where dory went? No. Sorry. I didn't see anything. Seriously?

Hey, where's dory? Is she with you? I'm sorry. I tried to hold on, but I couldn't and I lost her. What? All right. Let's get going. No! And then the whale swallowed us even though I speak whale. A whale? Good thing I wasn't there to see that. Actually marlin never believes i even know how to speak whale... But you know what, he always kind of trusts me anyway. You know, I like this marlin already. Yeah. And then somehow we found Nemo. Or did he find me? I don't know. But, you know what, Nemo is the sweetest. He just never gives up on me no matter what. What would dory do? Well, we'll certainly have to thank marlin and Nemo when we meet them. Wait. Wait I know this place. Hello. I'm sigourney Weaver. There! Won't you please join us?

All I know is that I miss them. I__ I... I really miss them. I've said that before. Dory? Mom, marlin and Nemo are more than good friends, they're family. And I have to get them back.

The other day I caught him peeing on my flamingo. I'll keep an eye on him. You better. Yes, sir. Go on, Sparky. That's right! Good boy. See you later!   Where do you think you're going? School. What about that dog of yours? She's not in the house and she's away from your tulips. I want you to remember something. While your parents are away, I am in charge here. Yes, Uncle Bob. Dutch Day is coming up, and I don't need any trouble. How's your song coming? Okay. Keep at it! Dutch Day is a big day for me. Yes, sir. Good morning, children. I am Mr. Rzykruski. I will be your new science teacher. Apparently, Mr. Holcomb had an incident. He got hit by lightning! Well, that is bad. But he did not get ""hit"" by lightning. Lightning does not hit a person the way one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage. Lightning is simply electricity. The cloud is angry. Yes. Making storm. All the electrons are saying, ""I am leaving you!"" ""I go to the land of opportunity!"" The ground says, ""Yes, we need electrons trained in science just like you!"" ""Come. Come! Welcome."" So both sides start to build a ladder. This man, he comes out to look at the storm. He does not see the invisible ladders. When the two ladders meet... Boom!  The circuit is complete and all of the electrons rush to the land of opportunity. This man is in the way! Ahh! But it is very rare to have such an incident. But it's not rare. Lightning happens to people all the time here. There's a thunderstorm almost every night. My dad got hit twice. They built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine. I heard it was a cemetery. That's where they buried the miners. It's the windmill that does it. Turning, turning the air until the sky itself rages against the night. No. Cemetery. Definitely.          Students, on your way out, take a permission slip for the science fair. First prize is a huge trophy! Hello, Victor.  Hi. Mr. Whiskers had a dream about you last night. How do you know? Because this morning he made this. Oh. Did you get that out of the litter box? It's an omen. Last month he dreamed about Bob. He fell in a manhole.  He dreamed about Toshiaki the day he pitched a perfect game.  And Nassor the day he got knocked unconscious. If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you, it means something big is going to happen.   You can keep it. One day you'll dream about me, won't you, Kitty?  Hey, boy. How are you doing?  You'll be my partner, right, Victor? Because you have to have a partner for the science fair, and whoever is your partner is going to win. You know the most about science so pick me as a partner. I have lots of ideas! We can make a death ray!  it says no death rays. See? Oh, man. I still want to do it. Come on. Who else would be your partner? You don't have friends and neither do I. I'm sorry, Edgar. I just don't need a partner. I like to work alone. Will you sign my permission slip? Dinner's ready. Victor, have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living? You're a travel agent? I sell dreams. I tell people, ""You can sail to Italy."" ""You can do the hula in Hawaii."" Will you sign my form? I'm getting to that. Okay. In my job, sometimes you have people who don't want quite the same thing, right? Say a husband wants to play golf in Scotland but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon. All right, you've got two conflicting ideas here. And it's my job, Victor, to help them meet halfway. Say... Scottsdale, Arizona. He gets to golf, she gets Indians. But there's no river. And no jungle. Nobody gets what they want. Exactly. And wrong. They both get what they want because they compromise. You'd like to do the science fair and that's great. I'd like you to try a sport. Say, I don't know, baseball. Science fair, baseball. Science fair, baseball. How do you choose? Guess what? You don't have to. No reason you can't do both. You meet in the middle. Everyone's happy.   Look at what Toshiaki's doing. He's keeping his eye on the target, never losing his concentration. Strike three! Next batter! I want you to concentrate on your project for the science fair. Come on, honey!   Whoa. Nice catch, Sparky. Come on, Victor, please. Tie Sparky up and get your head into the game. Time out! Sorry, boy. Hey, Sparky.  Play ball! Strike one! Nice try, son. When conducting an experiment, trying is the important thing. It is okay to fail as long as you keep trying! Eh?  Come on, Victor. You can do it, honey.  Strike two! Yes! Come on, honey!    Victor, run! Sparky!       Sparky! No!   He was a great dog. A great friend. The best dog a kid could have. When you lose someone you love, they never really leave you. They just move into a special place in your heart. He'll always be there, Victor. I don't want him in my heart. I want him here with me. I know. If we could bring him back, we would. Try and get some sleep, sweetheart. Things will seem better in the morning.   Just like lightning, the nervous system is electricity. We are wires and springs and cables to send the messages.   Even after death, the wiring remains. Watch as the muscles respond to the electricity.       Hi, Victor! How was school? Okay.        Shoo!           I'm sorry, boy.     You're alive!  You're alive!  Sparky! You're alive! I can't believe it! You're alive!  I can fix that.  It worked. It really worked.  Victor! Victor, breakfast! Victor? Are you up here?  Shh. Quiet down, boy. Victor?  Sparky, Shh! Quiet. Victor!  Shh! French toast or waffles? Uh, waffles. Then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director. It's my science project. It's a robot. A robotic bucket? Yes. For mopping, I suppose? Yes. Maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it.  Sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone know about you. They may not understand. So, you need to stay here today.       No, couldn't be.              What?   I know. And Helen said she thought they were putting up some kind of TV antenna on top of the roof. In the middle of a thunderstorm? That's what she said. I don't believe it. And did you get that big power surge the other night? Jack thought it was a fuse box, but apparently it affected the whole neighborhood. Sometimes I wonder just what goes on in that house. I just don't feel safe walking by there.  Sweetie, you okay? Here you go. So anyway, Jack loves it here, but if the schools weren't so great, sometimes I wonder if we'd be better off closer to my mother. Sparky?  Hmm.      Hi, Victor. How was school? Good. Got to go. Sparky? Sparky?  There you are. Good boy. Sorry you had to stay here alone all day.  What's the matter, boy? Are you okay?  Hmm. You're a little low. Are you hungry, boy?  All right, here. Let's top you up.  Victor? Could you come down here, please? Victor! Your friend is here. Edgar? Hey. Edgar, what are you doing here? I know. What? I know. Know what? You know. No. I think I know what you know I know. Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it. Your dog is alive! That's impossible. I know. I know it is so impossible, but you did it. You did it! So, show me how, or I'll tell everyone. Oh, Mrs. Frankenstein! Shh. May I have a cookie, please? Oh. Yes, of course. All right, come on. Oh! I think the wind and the lightning are part of the same thing, some kind of strange force. But the wind isn't strong enough to bring an animal back from the dead. For that, you need lightning. So when can I do it? You can't. This isn't an experiment. It's my dog. Showandtell, Victor. You show me, and I won't tell. Can I help you, young man? I'd like to buy a fish. Certainly. Which one? This one.   What do we do now?   What happened to it? What did you do? I don't know. It should have worked.  It's invisible. It's an invisible goldfish. Why is it invisible? I have no idea.  You can't tell anyone. You understand that, right? Not until we figure out how it works. Okay, Okay. Promise? Promise. How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish? Put your finger in. You can feel it. Ah! It bit me! Let me see it.  It's my science project, and it's top secret! Mmm. Yeah? Well, our science fair project is even cooler. What is it? Double top secret. SeaMonkeys? We got to come up with something better. Bigger. I know. The science fair is in two days. I know. You're the smart one! I know. Hmm.  Okay, okay. Sit still. Shh. Sparky, no! Shh. No! Shh! Sorry, boy, but we can't risk anyone seeing you again.   Shh!    Toshiaki says you have an invisible fish. No, he didn't. So, you don't? I didn't say that. Who said I did? Toshiaki says it's your science fair project.  If it was, I couldn't tell you. So it isn't, or it is? No. Yes. I'm confused. Do you have an invisible fish? Okay. But you have to keep it a secret. Swish your finger around. You can feel it. It's just water. There's nothing there. No, it's invisible. Huh? I don't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing, but that trophy will be mine.  Victor.  Something's wrong with my fish! What is it? It's not there any more. Maybe it just hopped out. Did you have the lid on it? Yes, ever since I left your house. I mean, it was there when I went to bed. I'm thinking maybe they don't last. They're only there for a little bit and then they're gone.   No! Sparky!   Sparky!   Don't worry. I can fix that, too. Good night, boy. Mmm.  Are you sure this is going to work? No. That's why it's called an ""experiment."" We have to collect data. Do we have to collect it on me? Ready? No. Ten, nine, eight... We could use a test dummy or something. ...seven, six, five... Computer simulation. ...four, three, two... I have to pee! ...one. Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ah! It's working! It's working!       What were you boys doing on the roof? Science. Science. As mayor of New Holland, you have entrusted me with your safety. So I can't sit idly while a teacher endangers our children. The man is a menace! She's right! He's crazy! Have you looked through this science book they're using? Apparently Pluto isn't good enough to be a planet any more. When I was a kid, Pluto was a great planet. This guy comes along and rewrites the rules! In fairness, he didn't write the textbook. Mr. Mayor, Edward Frankenstein. Your neighbor, of course.  I just would like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher. Thinks he's great. My Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions about things I've never even heard of. Shouldn't we at least give the man a chance to explain himself? Yes. Please come up, Mr. Menace.  Ladies, gentlemen. I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant.  Is that right word, ""ignorant""? I mean ""stupid,"" ""primitive,"" ""unenlightened.""  You do not understand science, so you are afraid of it. Like a dog is afraid of thunder or balloons. To you, science is magic and witchcraft because you have such small minds.   I cannot make your heads bigger, but your children's heads, I can take them and crack them open.  This is what I try to do, to get at their brains! Oh, my.  Thank you. Oh, jeez. Be quick, boy. They'll be home any minute. Praise be New Holland  Praise be New Holland  Streets so wide and sidewalk  The sidewalks. Okay. Praise be New Holland  No! Shh. No!  No, no, no! Shh! Victor?  Victor? Hi, Elsa. What are you doing? Practicing my song for Dutch Day. It's nice. Did you get a new dog? No. I heard a bark. Yeah, that was me. You are barking?   Hmm. You must really miss Sparky. Uh, I got to go. Bye. Bye.  I feel so sad for him, Persephone. He really misses his dog.  Where's Mr. Rzykruski? All I know is I'll be teaching the class for the rest of the semester. Do you know anything about science? I know more than you do. Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot. Well, sometimes knowing too much is the problem. What about the science fair? Oh, it's still on, but it will be judged by someone who's not insane! Me! Now get cracking, and may the best person win! I can't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge. She's not even interested in science. Back home, everyone is scientist. Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize. Your country does not make enough scientist. Always needs more. You should be a scientist, Victor. Nobody likes scientists. They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no. Not the questions that science asks. Actually, I have a question.  That is why you are a scientist. I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great, but the next time it didn't. I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't. And I don't know why. Then maybe you never really understood it the first time. People think science is here, but it is also here. The first time, did you love your experiment? Yes. Ah. And the second time?  No. I just wanted it over. Then you changed the variables. I was doing it for the wrong reason. Science is not good or bad, Victor. But it can be used both ways. That is why you must always be careful.  I can't believe I broke my arm for nothing. None of us are going to win! E has an invisible fish! No, he doesn't. You fell for a parlor trick. You're saying he faked it?   That fish you showed us, was it real? It was, and it was dead, too. You brought an animal back from the dead? No, Victor did. With lightning, and boom, and sss. Impossible. I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog.  He brought back Sparky? Mmm. Victor will win the science fair unless we can do better. Bigger. You say you know Victor's secret? Now is your chance to prove it. Now, where's my muffin tin? Victor. Sparky?    Sparky! But you're... Sparky's alive! Sparky?  Hey, come on!  Mom? Dad? What's going on? Sparky! No! Sparky! Sparky. no! Sparky, come back! Sparky! Hey, hey! Just a minute! No! I have to go find Sparky! Victor, what have you done? You said yourself, if you could bring back Sparky, you would! Yes, but that was different because we couldn't! It's easy to promise the impossible. What you did was a very serious thing. Crossing the boundary between life and death. Reanimating a corpse! It's very... Upsetting. I just wanted my dog back. Oh, sweetheart. We'll help you look for Sparky but when we get back, I think we need to have a little talk. Understood? Yes. Now, let's go find your dog.      Sparky! Sparky, are you in there? Mom, Dad! I'm going to check the school and the park. You guys do the town square, okay? Got it. Sparky! Sparky!   Cool. Interesting. It has something to do with the lightning. I don't really understand it. Oh, but I do! Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life! Sparky! Where are you? Sparky!     Sparky! Sparky!  Thank you. Thank you so much.  And now it's my pleasure  to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl,  my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.  I don't think this is safe. Nonsense! We have the fire chief over here.  You know, a lot of girls would kill to be in your place. I'd welcome death.  Praise be New Holland  Streets so wide and sidewalks clean  Modest homes at modest prices  Everyone's hope and dream    I'm going to win. No, I shall win the science fair. Hmm. In our houses tight and safe  We have nothing to fear  Ah. The tomb of Colossus. Soon you shall be awakened and we shall be reunited once again! Ah, Shelley.      Praise be New Holland  May your windmills spin forevermore   Isn't she adorable? Mm.      Mr. Whiskers?    Mr. Whiskers?  Hello! Is someone there?   Rise, Colossus. Rise from your tomb!    Huh! Shelley?  Shelley?        Sparky! Sparky! Sparky?  Sparky? Sparky!  Sparky, it's okay, boy. It's just me. I thought that you were gone. I never want to lose you. Promise you'll never go running off, okay? Come on, boy.  Was someone else here?  Victor! I need your help. Did you see those things? They were like... SeaMonkeys! You know how on the package, they're like, in a happy kingdom and everyone's smiling? Yeah? They're not like that at all. Victor! I need your help. I asked him first! My problem bigger!   Yeah, he's right.  Okay, let's go!  And now for our next act,  we have something really big.               No! Get away!            on, no! This way! In here!      Go, Colossus. Kill! Kill! Kill!      Colossus?   Mm! Mmmm! Get away from me! Get away from me!     Your SeaMonkeys. Are they freshwater or saltwater? Freshwater. Freshwater animals can't tolerate salt. Hey! Over here!  Cool.   Help! Get back! Stay away from us!   Sparky!   No, no, no, no! Whoa, stop! You put me down! I gave you life! Victor! Victor, I need help. Please!    Shelley?  Persephone! Persephone, are you okay?  Here, Mr. Whiskers.  Here, kitty, kitty, Mr. Whiskers.  No!  Persephone! Bring her back! Mr. Whiskers. I'm coming, Elsa!  What happened? Sparky! There you are. Are you all right?  What you got there, boy? Let me through! I knew it. It's the boy's dead dog!  That's Elsa's wig. Where's my niece? He's killed the little girl!  After him! Kill the monster! Help!  Help! Stay away from us!   Get him!  Where's my niece? Look out! It's on fire!  There's Elsa! Help! Ow!  Elsa! Sparky!  Victor! Help! Hang on! Don't let go! I can't reach!   Hang on! I can't hold on much longer.      Sparky!     Victor! Stay back. It's too dangerous. That's my son in there! Oh! Oh!  Victor! Victor! Honey, are you all right?  Sparky!          No! Victor, is there anything we can do for you? You said that I need to let him go. Sometimes adults don't know what they're talking about. Start your engines!  Give it more juice! Turn off your engines! It's okay, boy. You don't have to come back. You'll always be in my heart.    Sparky!

Frozen 2,Disney,2010,2019,Animation,"Anna, Elsa. Bed time's soon! Ah oh, The princess is trapped in the snow goblin's evil spell! Quick Elsa, make a prince, a fancy one! Oh no, the prince is trapped too! Who cares about danger when there's love Uh, Anna, blurgh... Kissing won't save the forest. The lost fairies cry out! What sound does a giraffe make? I dunno. Nevermind. They wake the Fairy Queen. Who breaks the spell and saves everyone. And they all get married! What are you playing? Enchanted forest. The prince and the princess whoosh! That's like no Enchanted Forest I've ever seen. You've seen an Enchanted Forest? Wait, what? I have, once. And you never told us this before? Well, I could tell you now. If you.. ah... Okay, tell us now. Are you sure about this? It's time they know. Let's make a big snowman later. If they can settle and listen. Far away, As North as we can go. Stood a very old and very Enchanted Forest. But it's magic wasn't that of goblin's spells and lost fairies. It was protected by the most powerful spirits of all. Those of Air, Fire of Water And Earth. But it was also home to the mysterious Northuldra people. Were the Northuldra magical, like me? No Elsa, they were not magical. They just took advantage of the forest gifts. Their ways were so different from ours. But still, they promised us friendship. In honor of that, your grandfather, King Runeard, built them a mighty Dam to strengthen their waters. It was a gift of peace That's a big gift of peace And I was so honored to get to go to the forest to celebrate it. Stand tall, Agnarr. I wasn't at all prepared for what the day would bring. We let down our guard. We were charmed. It felt so... Magical. But something went wrong. They were attacking us. Get behind me! It was a brutal battle. Your grandfather ... Father! was lost. The fighting enraged the spirits. Look out! They turned their magic against us all. There was this... voice. And someone saved me. I'm told, the spirits then vanished, and a powerful mist covered the forest, locking everyone out. And that night, I came home King of Arendelle. Woah, Papa, that was epic. Whoever saved you, I love them. I wish I knew who it was. What happened to the spirits? What's in the forest now? I don't know. The mist still stands. No one can get in. And no one has since come out. So we're safe? Yes, but the forest could wake again. And we must be prepared for what ever danger it may bring. And on that note, how about we say good night to your father? Oh, but I still have so many questions! Save them for another night Anna. Ah, you know I don't have that kind of patience. Why did the Northuldra attack us anyway? Who attacks people who give them gifts? Do you think the forest will wake again? Only Ahtohallan knows. Ahtoho, what? When I was little, my mother would sing a song about a special river, called Ahtohallan, that was said to hold all the answers about the past about what we are a part of. Wow, will you sing it for us? Please? Okay, cuddle close. Scooch in.  Where the northwind meets the sea   There's a river full of memory   Sleep, my darling, safe and sound   For in this river all is found   In her waters, deep and true   Lie the answers and a path for you   Dive down deep into her sound   But not too far or you'll be drowned   Yes, she will sing to those who hear   And in her song, all magic flows   But can you brave what you most fear?   Can you face what the river knows?   Where the northwind meets the sea   There's a mother full of memory   Come my darling, homewardbound   When all is lost, then all is found  Your Majesty, Oh! They're ready. Hehe, excuse me. I'm coming. Do you hear that? What? Nevermind. Enjoying your new permafrost, Olaf? I'm just living the dream Anna. Oh, how I wish this could last forever. Mmmmm. And yet change mocks us with her beauty. What's that? Forgive me, maturity is making me poetic. Tell me, you're older and thus allknowing. Do you ever worry about the notion that nothing is permanent? Ahh, no. Really, Wow, I can't wait until I'm aged like you, so I don't have to worry about important things. That's not what I mean. I dont worry because... well I have you and Elsa, and Kristoff, and Sven and the gates are open wide and... and I'm not alone anymore...  Yes, the wind blows a little bit colder   And we're all getting older   And the clouds are moving on with every Autumn breeze   Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer   And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser   That's why I rely on certain certainties   Yes, some things never change   Like the feel of your hand in mine   Some things stay the same   Like how we get along just fine   Like an old stone wall that'll never fall   Some things are always true   Some things never change   Like how I am holding on tight to you   The leaves are already falling   Sven, it feels like the future is calling   Are you telling me tonight you're gonna get down on one knee?   Yeah, but I'm really bad at planning these things out   Like candlelight and pulling of rings out   Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me   Yeah, some things never change   Like the love that I feel for her   Some things stay the same   Like how reindeers are easier.   But if I committ and I go for it.   I'll know what to say and do   Right?!   Some things never change   Sven, the pressure is all on you..   The winds are restless   Could that be why I'm hearing this call?   Is something coming?   I'm not sure I want things to change at all   These days are precious   Can't let them slip away   I can't freeze this moment   But I can still go out and seize this day   Ah ah ah ah ah ah   The wind blows a little bit colder   And you all look a little bit older   It's time to count our blessings beneath an autumn sky   We'll always live in a kingdom of plenty   That stands for the good and the many   And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly   Our flag will always fly!   Our flag will always fly!   Our flag will always fly!   Some things never change   Turn around and time has flown   Some things stay the same   Though the future remains unknown   May our good luck last, may our past be past   Time's moving fast, it's true   Some things never change   And I'm holding on tight to you   Holding on tight to you   Holding on tight to you   I'm holding on tight to you  Ahh, okay. Umm... Lion. Grizzly bear. Monster. Ug Bear! Angry face! Ag Bear! Hunt! Unreedemable monster! Greatest mistake of your life! Who didn't even kiss you. Villain. Ooh... We all kind of got it. Okay, Olaf, you're up. Okay. So much easier now that I can read. Lightning round. Boys against girls. Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready, Go! Unicorn. Ice cream. Castle. Oaken. Tea pot. Mouse. Ooh, Elsa! I don't think Olaf should get to rearrange. Doesn't matter. This is gonna be a cinch. Two sisters, one mind. Thank you. Okay, here we go. You got this Elsa. Anytime. Just do it with your body. Nothing. Air. Trees, people, treeple. Oh that's not a word... shovel boy, teeth? Oh, doing the dishes. Polar Bear. Hey. Sorry. You gotta give me something. Uhm, Alarmed?, Distracted? Worried? Panicking? Disturbed, oh, come on. You definitely look disturbed, oh. We won. Rematch? Oh, you know what, I think I'll turn in. Are you OK? Just.. just tired. Good night. Yeah, I'm tired too, and Sven promised to read me a bedtime story. Didn't you Sven. Did I? Oh you do the best voices like when you pretend to be Kristoff and you're like 'I'll just need to go talk to some rocks about my childhood and stuff.' How about you guys start without me? Does Elsa seem weird to you? She... seemed like Elsa. That last word, really seemed to throw her, what was it? I don't know, um, I don't know, but ... Ah Ice. Oh come on, she couldn't act out ice? I better go check on her. Thanks honey, love you. Love you, too. It's fine. Come in. Yup, something's wrong. With you? No, with you. You're wearing mother's scarf. You do that when something's wrong. Huh, did we hurt your feelings? I'm sorry, if we did. You know, very few people are actually good at family games, that's just a fact. No that's not it. Then what is it. There's this... I just don't want to mess things up. What things? You're doing great! Oh Elsa, when are you going to see yourself the way I see you? What would I do without you? You'll always have me. I know what you need. Come on. Come here. What? Mama's words, cuddle close. Scooch in. Mhmm.  Where the northwind meets the sea   There's a river full of memory   I know what you're doing   Sleep, my darling, safe and sound   For in this river all is found   I can hear you   But I won't   Some look for trouble, while others don't   There are a thousand reasons I should go about my day   And ignore your whispers which i wish would go away. Ohh...   Whoa   You're not a voice   You're just a ringing in my ear   And if I heard you, which I don't   I'm spoken for I fear   Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls   I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls   I've had my adventure, I don't need something new   I'm afraid of what im risking if I follow you...   Into the unkown!   Into the unknown!!   Into the unknown!!!   What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake   Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?   Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?   Who knows deep down I'm not where I meant to be?   Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grows   Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go ...   Into the unknown!   Into the unknown!!   Into the unknown!!!   Are you out there? Do you know me?   Can you feel me Can you show me   Where are you going? Don't leave me alone   How do I follow you?   Into the uknown!!!  Air, fire, water, earth. The water. The air rages, no fire, no water. The earth is next. We have to get out. It'll be okay, evacuate to the cliffs. Oh no, I'm gonna blow! I got you. Yes, everyone's out and safe. Here, take one of these. You okay there, Olaf? Oh yeah. We're calling this, controlling what you can when things feel out of control. Okay, I don't understand. You've been hearing a voice and you didn't think to tell me? I don't want to worry you. We made a promise not to shut each other out. Just tell me what's going on. I woke the magical spirits at the Enchanted Forest. Okay, that's definitely not what I thought you were gonna say. Wait, the Enchanted Forest? The one father warned us about? Yes. Why would you do that? Because of the voice. I know it sounds crazy, but I believe whoever is calling me, is good. How can you say that? Look at our kingdom. I know, it's just that my magic can feel it. I can feel it. Okay. Oh no, what now. The Trolls? Kristoff, we missed you. Pabbie. Well, never a dull moment with you two. I hope you're prepared for what you have done, Elsa. Angry magical spirits are not for the faint of heart. Why are they still angry? What does all of this have to do with Arendelle? Let me see what I can see. The past is not what it seems. A wrong demands to be righted. Arendelle is not safe. The truth must be found. Without it I see no future. No future? When one can see no future, all one can do is the next right thing. The next right thing? Is for me to go to the Enchanted forest and find that voice. Kristoff can I borrow your wagon, and Sven? I'm not very comfortable with the idea of that. You are not going alone. Anna, No, I have my powers to protect me, you don't. Excuse me, I climbed to the north mountain, survived a frozen heart, and saved you from my exboyfriend, and I did it all without powers, so you know, I'm coming. Me too, I'll drive. I'll bring the snacks. I will look after your people. Please make sure they stay out of the kingdom until we return. Of course. Let's let them know. Anna, I'm worried for her, we have always feared Elsa's powers were too much for this world. Now, we must pray they are enough. I won't let anything happen to her. Who's into trivia? I am, ok. Did you know that water has memory? True fact, it's disputed by many, but it's true. Did you know men are six times more likely to be struck by lightning? Did you know gorillas burp when they're happy? Did you know we blink 4 million times a day? Did you know wombats poop squares? Did you know sleeping quietly on long journeys prevents insanity? Yeah, that's not true. It is. It is defenitely true. It's the truth. Hmm, well that was unanimous. But I will look it up when we get home.  They're both asleep. So... what do you wanna do? Sven, keep us steady, will you? Anna. Hm. Anna, remember our first trip like this when I said you'd have to be crazy to want to marry a man you just met. Wait, what? Crazy? You didn't say I was crazy, you think I'm crazy? No, I did, you were... not crazy, clearly. Just naive, not naive, just ah.. just new to love. Like I was, and... when you're new, you're bound to get it.. wrong. So you're saying, I'm wrong for you. What? No, no, I'm not saying you're wrong, or crazy, I'm sayi... Kristoff, stop, please. Good idea. I hear it. I hear the voice. You do? Olaf, wake up. Whoa. Wow. Promise me, we do this together, okay? I promise. It's okay. Did you know that an Enchanted Forest is a place of transformation? I have no idea what that means. But I can't wait to see what it's gonna do to each one of us. What is this? What was that? No, no, no. And we're locked in. I probably should've seen that one coming. This forest is beautiful. The Dam... It still stands. It was in Grand Pabbie's visions, but why? I don't know, but it's still in good shape, thank goodness. What do you mean? Well if that Dam broke, it would send a tidal wave so big, it would wash away everything on this fjord. Everything? But.. Arendelle's on this fjord. Nothings gonna happen to Arendelle Anna, it's gonna be fine. Come here. You know, under different circumstances, this would be a... pretty romantic place. Don't you think? Different circumstances? You mean like with someone else? What? No, no, I'm saying... Hm, just in case we don't make it out of here. You don't think we're gonna make out of here? No, no, I mean, no, we will make it out of here Well, technically the odds are kinda complicated, but my point is.. In case we die You think we're gonna die? No! no! No, we will die at some point... I swore that I wouldn't leave her side. Not even any reason time will we die but... Elsa? Way far in the future, we will die. Don't patronize me. Elsa, there you are. You okay? I'm fine. Okay, good. Where's Olaf? Umm, Anna? Elsa? Sven? Samantha? I don't even know a Samantha! That's normal. What was that? Samantha?  This will all make sense when I am older   Someday I will see that this makes sense   One day, when I'm old and wise   I'll think back and realize  That these were all completely normal events   Ah!   I'll have all the answers when I'm older   Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood   I know in a couple years   these will seem like childish fears   And so I know this isn't bad, it's good  Excuse me.  Growing up means adapting   Puzzling out your world and your place   When I'm more mature   I'll feel comfortably secure   Being watched by something   with a creepy, creepy face   See, that will all make sense when I am older   So there's no need to be terrified or tense   I'll just dream about a time   When I'm in my aged prime   'Cause when you're older   Absolutely, everything makes sense   This is fine  Olaf! Hey guys, meet the wind spirit. Coming through. Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick. I'd hold your hair back, but I can't find my arms. Hey! Stop! Elsa! Let her go. Anna, be careful! That's my sister. Prince Agnarr. For Arendelle. Are you ok? I'm fine. What are these? They look like moments in time. What's that thing you say Olaf? Oh, my theory about advancing technology's is both our savior and our doom? No, not that one, the one about... The one about cucumbers? No. The thing about water. Water has memory. The water that makes up you and me has passed through at least 4 humans and or animals before us. And remembers everything. The wind's back! Delicious! I think I'll name you Gale. Get out there. Oh, hi, aren't you curious! You in a better mood now? Father. That's father. This girl... She's saving him. She's Northuldra. What is that? Olaf get behind me. Why are you gonna do with that? I have no idea. Lower your weapon! And you lower yours! Arendellian Soldiers? Threatening my people Lieutenant? Invading my Dam space, Yelena? Why does that soldier looks so familiar? Lieutenant, get the sword! That was magic. Did you see that? Of course I saw it. Well, you chose a nice cold greeting. They've been trapped in here this whole time? Yeah. What do we do now? I got this, hi I'm Olaf. Oh sorry, yeah, I just find clothes restricting. Bet you're wondering who we are and why we're here. It's really quite simple. It began with two sisters. One born with magical powers. One born powerless, their love of snowmen? Infinite! Anna, No! Too high. Blast! Ooww, Mama, Papa, Help! Slam! Doors shutting everywhere, Sisters torn apart. Well at least they have their parents. Their parents are dead. Oh, hi I'm Anna, I'll marry a man I just met. Elsa's gonna blow, snow, snow, ah run! Magic pulses through my snowflakes. I live, ice palace for one, ice palace for one. Get out Anna. My heart. Oh my goodness. Only an act of true love can save you. Here's a true love's kiss. You're not worth it. Guess what. I'm the bad guy. What? And Anna freezes to death, forever. Oh, Anna! Then she unfreezes.. oh and then Elsa woke up the magical spirits. And we were forced out from our kingdom, Now our only hope is find the truth about the past, but we don't have a clue how to do that, Excepts Elsa's hearing voices, so we got that going for us. Any questions? I think they got it. Are you really queen of Arendelle? I am. Why would nature reward a person of Arendelle with magic? Perhaps to make up for the actions of your people. My people are innocent, we would have never attacked first. May the truth be found. Hi, I'm sor, uh, what's happening? That's it! Lieutenant Mattias, library, second portrait on the left, You were our father's official guard. Agnar. What did happened to your parents? Our parents' ship went down in the Southern Sea 6 years ago. I see him. I see him in your faces. Really? Soldiers. We maybe getting on in years but we're still strong and proud to serve Arendelle. Wait, please. Someone has called me here. If I can just find them. I believe they have the answers that may help us free this forest. Trust me, I just want to help. We only trust nature. When nature speaks... ...we listen. This will all make sense when I'm older. Fire spirit. Get back everyone! Go to the river! No, no, no no the reindeer... that's a dead end. Come on Sven, we'll get them. Elsa, get out of there. No, no, no. Elsa. Come on buddy, we can do this. Anna. Get her out of here! No! Elsa! They're all looking at us, aren't they? Got any advice? Nothing? Hmm. Should I know what that means? You hear it too. Somebody's calling us, who is it? What do we do? Okay, keep going north. Elsa! Oh thank goodness. Anna. Are you okay? What were you doing? You could have been killed, you can't just follow me into fire. You don't want me to follow you into fire, then don't run into fire. You're not being careful Elsa. I'm sorry, are you okay? I've been better. I know what you need. Where did you get that scarf? That's a Northuldra's scarf. What? This is from one of our oldest families. It was our mother's. Elsa. I see it, it's mother. Mother saved father's life that day. Our mother was Northuldra. We are called Northuldra. We are the people of the sun. I promise you. I will free this forest, and restore Arendelle. That's a pretty big promise Elsa. Free the forest. Wow. Im sorry, It's just ... ah. Some of us were born in here, we've never even seen the clear sky. I get it. Name's Ryder. Kristoff. I heard the voice again. We need to go north. But the earth giants now roam the north at night. You can leave in the morning. I'm Honeymaren. Honeymaren, we'll do all we can. Hey, let me ask you, how do you guys cope with the ever increasing complexity of thought that comes with maturity? Brilliant. It's so refreshing to talk to the youth of today. Our future's in bright hands Oh no, no, no.. Don't chew that, you don't know what I've stepped in. I can't seem to get her attention. Or even say the right thing. Well, you're in luck. I know nothing about women. But I do know that we have the most amazing way of proposing. If we start now, we'll be ready by dawn. Really? Best part? It involves a lot of reindeer. Hey, back at home, Halimah's still over at Hudson's hearth? She is. Really? She married? Mmmm. Oh wow, why doesn't that make me feel better? What else do you miss? My father. He passed long before all this. He was a great man. Built us a good life in Arendelle, but taught me to never take the good for granted. He'd say, be prepared! Just when you think you found your way, life will throw you onto a new path. What do you do when it does? Don't give up. Take it one step at a time. And... Just do the next right thing. Yeah, you got it. I wanna show you something. May I? You know, air, fire, water and earth. Yes. But look. There's a fifth spirit. Said to be a bridge between us and the magic of nature. A fifth spirit? Some say... they heard it call out the day the forest fell. My father heard it. Do you think that's who's calling me? Maybe. Alas, only Ahtohallan knows. Ahtohallan.  Dive down deep into her sound   But not too far, or you'll be drowned  Why do lullabies always have to have some terrible warning in them? I wonder that all the time. Earth giants. What are they doing down here? Hide! They're coming! This is why we don't play with fire. Ah, I can't stay mad at you, you're so cute. Please tell me, you are not about to follow them. What if I can settle them like I did the wind and fire. Or what if they can crush you before you even get the chance. Remember, the goal is to find the voice, find the truth and get us home. Hey guys, that was close. I know. The giant sensed me. They may come back here, I don't want to put anyone at risk again. And you're right Anna, we've got to find the voice. We're going now. Okay, we're going, let me just... Wait, where are Kristoff and Sven? Oh yeah, I think they took off with that Ryder guy and a bunch of reindeer. They left? Just left without saying anything? Who knows the ways of men. Am I supposed to feel this ridiculous? Oh yeah, definitely. Everyone ready? Ready. Ah, I could use a rehearsal I love love.. Wait, you talk for them too? I do.. It's like you can actually hear what they're thinking. Yeah and then you.. you just say it. And then you just say it. Okay, here she comes. Princess Anna of Arendelle. My fiesty, fearless, ginger sweet love. Will you marry me? Um, no. The princess left with the queen. What queen? What? Wait. What?! I wouldn't try to follow, they're long gone. Long gone? So yeah. Um, we're heading west, to the Lycan Meadows, you can come with us if you want. Hey, um. I'm really sorry ... No, it's fine.. Yeah, yup. Hm, okay, I'd better go pack. You coming with? I'll just ah, dah I'll meet you there. Ahh, you know where you're going. Yah. Yah, I know the woods.  Reindeers are better than people   Sven, why is love so hard?   You feel what you feel   And those feeling are real   Come on, Kristoff. Let down your guard   Again, you're gone   Off on a different path than mine   I'm left behind   Wondering if I should follow   You had to go   And, of course, it's always fine   I probably could catch up with you tomorrow   But is this what it feels like to be growing apart   When did I become the one who's always chasing you heart?   Now I turn around and find I am lost in the woods   North is south, right is left when you're gone   I'm the one who sees you home But now I'm lost in the woods   And I don't know what path you are on   I'm lost in the woods   Up 'til now   The next step was a question of how   I never thought it was a question of whether   Who am I, if I'm not your guy?   Where am I, if we're not together   Forever   Now I know you're my true north   'Cause I am lost in the woods   Up is down, day is night   When you're not there   Oh, you're my only landmark   So I'm lost in the woods   Wondering if you still care   But I'll wait   For a sign    That I'm your path   'Cause you are mine   Until then   I'm lost in the woods   Lost in the woods    Hey Olaf, umm. Maybe just one of you should do it. I agree, she's a little pitchy. Hey, Gale's back. What? How can it be? What is it? Mother and father's ship. But this isn't the Southern Sea. No, it isn't. Why is their ship here? How is it here? It must have been washed in from the Dark Sea. What were they doing in the Dark Sea? I don't know. How did the ship get through the mist? I thought nobody could but us, unless... Nobody was on it. There's gotta be something here. Wait, wait, look around. Every Arendellian ship has a compartment, waterproof. That's very clever. Although it does make me wonder why they don't just make the whole ship waterproof. Here! What language is this? I don't know, but look, this is mother's handwriting. The end of the ice age, the river found but lost. Magic's source. Elsa's source? It's a map. They traveled north. Planned to cross the Dark Sea to... Ahtohallan. It's real? Ahtoho what? Ahtohallan. It's a magical river said to hold all the answers about the past. Reinforcing my water has memory theory. Water has memory. Elsa? I wanna know what happened to them. Ahtohallan has to be the source of her magic. We keep going. But Elsa ... The waves are too high.. Elsa! Hey, hey hey, what are you doing? This is my fault, they were looking for answers about me. You are not responsible for their choices, Elsa. No, just their deaths. Stop. No. Yelana asked why would the spirits reward Arendelle with the magical queen? Because our mother saved our father. She saved her enemy. Her good deed was rewarded. With you. You are a gift. For what? If anyone can resolve the past, if anyone can save Arendelle and free this forest, it's you. I believe in you Elsa. More than anyone or anything. Honeymaren said there was a fifth spirit A bridge between the magic of nature and us. A fifth spirit. That what's been calling me. From Ahtohallan. The answers about the past are all there. So we go to Ahtohallan. Not we. Me. What? The Dark Sea is too dangerous for us both. No, no we do this together. Remember the song, go too far and you'll be drowned. Who will stop you from going too far? You said you believed in me, that this is what I was born to do. And I don't want to stop you from that. I don't want to stop you from being whatever you need to be, I just don't want you dying. Trying to be everything for everyone else too. Don't do this alone. Let me help you, please. I can't lose you Elsa. I can't lose you either, Anna. Come on. Wait, what? What are you doing? Elsa! No, no ... Olaf, help me stop. Give me a hand! Hang on! Oh no. Come on! Anna, this might sound crazy, but I'm sensing some rising anger. Ah, Now I am angry, Olaf. She promised me we'd do this together. Yeah, but ... What I mean is I'm sensing rising anger in me. Wait, you're angry? I think so. Elsa pushed me away too and didn't even say goodbye. And you have every right to to be very, very mad at her. And you've said some things never change, but since then, everything's done nothing but change. I know. But look. I'm still here holding your hand. Yeah, that's.. that's a good point Anna. I feel better, you're such a good listener... Shh, shh, shh! Don't shh me.. No, no! Oh the Giants, they're huge. Hang on Olaf. Try not to scream. Found it. Thank you. Where are we? In a pit, with no way out. But with this spooky pitch black way in. Come on, it'll be fun, assuming we don't get stuck here forever and no one ever finds us and you start and I give up. But bright side... Elsa's gotta be doing a whole lot better than we are. Ok. Of course. Glaciers are rivers of ice. Ahtohallan is frozen. I hear you, and I'm coming.  Every inch of me is trembling   But not from the cold   Something is familiar   Like a dream , I can reach but not quite hold   I can sense you there   Like a friend, I've always known   I'm arriving   And it feels like I am home   I have always been a fortress   Cold secrets deep inside   You have secrets too   But you don't have to hide   Show yourself   I'm dying to meet you   Show yourself   It's your turn   Are you the one I've been looking for   All of my life?   Show yourself   I'm ready to learn   Ah ah ah ah   I've never felt so certain   All my life I've been torn   But I'm here for a reason   Could it be the reason I was born?   I have always been so different   Normal rules did not apply   Is this the day?   Are you the way   I finally find out why?   Show yourself   I'm no longer trembling   Here I am   I've come so far   You are the answer I've waited for   All of my life   Oh, show yourself   Let me see who you are   Come to me now   Open your door   Don't make me wait   One moment more   Oh, come to me now   Open your door   Don't make me wait   One moment more  Mother!  Come, my darling, homeward bound   I am there!   Show yourself, step into your power   Throw yourself, into something new   You are the one you've been waiting for   Love of my life   Show yourself  ...I love Olaf, and I love warm hugs.. I love you Olaf.  Here I stand, in the light...  ...like a chicken with the face of a monkey! I just wasn't looking where I was going, but I'm great. Actually ... Prince Hans of the Southern Isle. I love you. I need to tell you about my past. And where I'm from. I'm listening. Iduna! What are you reading, your Majesty? Some new Danish author. King Runard, I'm sorry, I don't understand. Grandfather! We bring Arendelle's full guard. But they have given us no reason not to trust them. The Northuldra follow magic, which means we can never trust them. Grandfather? Magic makes people feel too powerful, too entitled, it makes them think they can defy the will of a king. That is not what magic does. That's just your fear. Fear is what can't be trusted. You see, the Dam will weaken their lands, so they will have to turn to me.  ..for you, dive down deep into her sound   But not too far or you'll be drowned  They will come in celebration, and then we will know their size and strength. As you have welcomed us, we welcome you, our neighbors, our friends. King Runeard, the Dam isn't strengthening our waters, it's hurting the forest. It's cutting off the North... Let's not discuss this here. Let's meet on the fjord, have tea, find a solution. No! Anna! Which lucky tunnel do we choose? You see, the Dam will weaken their lands, so they will have to turn to me. King Runeard, the Dam is hurting the forest! Elsa's found it. What is it? The truth about the past. That's my grandfather, attacking the Northuldra leader who wields no weapon. The Dam wasn't a gift of peace. It was a trick. But that goes against everything Arendalle stands for. It does, doesn't it? I know how to free the forest, I know what we have to do, To set things right. Why do you say that so sadly? We have to break the Dam. But Arendelle will be flooded. That's why everyone was forced out, to protect them from what has to be done. Oh! Oh. Are you okay? I could really use a bright side, Olaf. Bright side? Umm... Turtles can breathe through their butts? Huh? And I see a way out. I knew I could count on you. Come on, Olaf. Elsa's probably on her way back right now, we can meet her and Olaf? What's this? Are you okay? I'm flurrying? Wait, no, that's.. that's not it. I'm flurrying, away... The magic in me is fading. What? I don't think Elsa's okay. I think... she may have gone too far. No, no. Anna. I'm sorry. You're gonna have to do this next part on your own. Okay? Wait, come here. I've got you. That's good. Hey Anna. I just thought of one thing that's permanent. What's that? Love. Warm hugs? I like warm hugs. I love you. Olaf, Elsa. What do I do now?  I've seen dark before   But not like this   This is cold   This is empty   This is numb   The life I knew is over   The lights are out   Hello darkness   I'm ready to succumb   I follow you around   I always have   But you've gone to a place I cannot find   This grief...   has a gravity, it pulls me down   But a tiny voice   whispers in my mind   You are lost   Hope is gone   But you must   Go on   And do the next right thing   Can there be a day   beyond this night?   I don't know anymore what is true   I can't find my direction, I'm all alone   The only star that guided me was you   How to rise from the floor   When it's not you I'm rising for?   Just do the next right thing   Take a step   Step again   It is all that I can, to do..   The next right thing   I won't look too far ahead   It's too much for me to take   But break it down to this next breath   This next step   This next choice   Is one that I can make   So I'll walk through this night   Stumbling blindly toward the light   And do the next right thing   And with the dawn, what comes then?   When it's clear that everything will never be the same again?   Then I'll make the choice   To hear that voice   And do...   The next right thing  Wake up! Wake up!!! That's it! Come and get me! Come on! Over here! Okay, that's right! Keep coming! That'll work. This way guys! No, nono, she's leading them to the Dam. Kristoff! I'm here. What do you need? To get to the Dam. You got it. Thank you. Help me up! We'll meet you around! Lieutenant Mathias. Your Highness. What are you doing? The Dam must fall. It's the only way to break the the mist, and free the forest. But we've sworn to protect Arendelle at all costs. Arendelle has no future until we make this right. King Runard betrayed everyone. How do you know that? My sister gave her life, for the truth. Please. Before we lose anyone else. Look out! Destroy the Dam, come on! Throw your boulders! That's it. I've got her. Anna! Hang on. I'm sorry I left you behind. I was just so deperate to protect her. I know, I know, it's okay. My love is not fragile. Look at the sky. I just didn't realize there was so much of it. 34 years. 5 months. And 23 days. Is it really you? Anna. I thought I'd lost you. Lost me? You saved me. Again. I did? And Anna. Arendelle did not fall. It didn't? The spirits all agree. Arendelle deserves to stand with you. Me? You did what was right, for everyone. Did you find the fifth spirit? You are the fifth spirit.  You are the bridge. Well, actually, a bridge has two sides. And mother had two daughters. We did this together, and we'll continue to do this together. Together. Elsa! You're okay! You look different. Did you cut your hair or something? Or something. Oh. Anna, I need to ask you a question. Okay. Do you wanna build a snowman? What? Thank goodness, water has memory. Anna, Elsa. Kristoff and Sven. You all came back! I love happy endings. I mean I presume we're done, or is this putting us in mortal danger situation gonna be, a regular thing? No, we're done. Actually... There is one more thing, Anna.. You are the most extraordinary person I've ever known. I love you with all I am. Will you marry me? Yes! Arendelle's okay. What? Ahtohallan is beautiful. Hello. You know, you belong up here. I took an oath to always do what's best for Arendelle. Luckily, I know just what that is. I still don't know what transformation means. I feel like this forest, has really changed us all. Presenting, her Majesty, Queen Anna of Arendelle. Oh! Oh! Hi! Sven, don't you look nice. Oh my goodness! Olaf! Charmed?, I'm sure. Charming. Your Majesty. Kristoff. Oh, did you boys get all dressed up for me? It was Sven's idea. One hour, you get this for one hour. That's okay, I prefer you in leather anyway. I'm shocked you can last an hour, that was brutal. Hm, the things we do for love. What is this crazy magic called again? A photograph. Photograph... hm. Really good. Halima, General Mathias. Ah Your Majesty. I'll be right back, you can look at our photograph while I'm gone. I'm just kidding, How'm I doing? Fantastic. Our lands and people, now connected by love. Hi Gale, you like it? Oh, do you mind? I've got a message for my sister. Thank you. Charade's Friday night, don't be late. And don't worry, Arandalle is doing just fine. Keep looking after the forest. I love you. I love you too, Sis. Hey Gale, we're going for a ride, wanna come? Are you ready? Ahhheeeooo... Show yourself! Right now! Elsa, be who you are. Oh, I will mama, I will. Elsa's dead. Olaf's dead. Anna cries. And then, a bunch of important things happen, that I forgot, but all that matters is I was right, and water has memory, and thus... I live. And so do you. Ohhhh... we live! We Live!! Ahhh..oho...

But she won't remember I have powers? It's for the best. Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow. There is beauty in it... But also great danger. You must learn to control it. Fear will be your enemy. No! We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure. Until then... We'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff. We will limit her contact with people, and keep her powers hidden from everyone. Including Anna. Ah. Elsa?  Do you wanna build a snowman?

Do you wanna build a snowman?  All ashore! Welcome to Arendelle! Watch your step, please. The gates will be opening soon. Why do I have to wear this? Because the queen has come of age. It's Coronation Day! That's not my fault. What do you want, Sven? ""Give me a snack."" What's the magic word? ""Please."" Uh! Uhuhuh. Share. I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates! And for a whole day! Faster, Percy! Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner. Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches. Did I say that out loud? Oh!

No, no, no, you didn't. I've been up for hours. Who is it? Still me, ma'am. The gates will open soon. Time to get ready. Of course. Ready for what? Your sister's coronation, ma'am. My sister's corneration. It's Coronation Day! It's Coronation Day!  The window is open!  So's that door!  I didn't know they did that anymore  Who knew we owned 8,000 salad plates?  For years I've roamed these empty halls  Why have a ballroom with no balls?  Finally They're opening up the gates!  There'll be actual, real, live people  It'll be totally strange  But wow! Am I so ready for this change!  'Cause for the first time in forever  There'll be music  There'll be light  For the first time  In forever  I'll be dancing through the night  Don't know if I'm elated or gassy  But I'm somewhere in that zone  'Cause for the first time in forever  I won't be alone I can't wait to meet everyone! What if I meet The One?  Tonight Imagine me gown and all  Fetchingly draped against the wall  The picture of sophisticated grace  I suddenly see him standing there  A beautiful stranger  Tall and fair  I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!  But then we laugh and talk all evening  Which is totally bizarre  Nothing like the life I've led so far  For the first time in forever  There'll be magic There'll be fun  For the first time in forever  I could be noticed by someone  And I know it is totally crazy  To dream I'd find romance  But for the first time in forever  At least I've got a chance!

'Cause for the first time in forever  For the first time  In forever  Nothing's in my way!  Hey! I'm so sorry. Are you hurt? Hey. Uh... No, no, I'm okay. Are you sure? Yeah. I just wasn't looking where I was going. But I'm great, actually. Oh... Thank goodness. Oh! Uh... Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Princess Anna of Arendelle. ""Princess""? My Lady. Oh! Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa... Um... Whew. Hi. Again. Oh, boy! This is awkward. Not ""You're awkward,"" but just because we're... I'm awkward, you're gorgeous. Wait, what? I'd like to formally apologize for hitting the princess of Arendelle with my horse. And for every moment after. No! No, no. It's fine. I'm not that princess. I mean, if you had hit my sister Elsa, it would be... Yeesh! Because, you know... Hello. But, lucky you, it's just me. ""Just"" you? The bells. The coronation. I better go. I have to go. I better go. Uh... Bye! Oh, no. Oh! Your Majesty, the gloves. Queen Elsa of Arendelle. Queen Elsa of Arendelle! Queen Elsa of Arendelle. Princess Anna of Arendelle. Oh. Here? Are you sure? Because I don't think I'm supposed to... Oh. Okay. Hi. ""Hi"" me? Oh... Um... Hi. You look beautiful. Thank you. You look beautifuller. I mean, not ""fuller."" You don't look fuller. But more beautiful. Thank you. So... This is what a party looks like. It's warmer than I thought. What is that amazing smell? Chocolate. Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown. ""Weselton""! Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty. As your closest partner in trade it seems only fitting that I offer you your first dance as queen. Onetwo, and jump. Uh... Thank you. Only, I don't dance. Oh... But my sister does. What? Oh! Lucky you. Oh, I don't think... If you swoon, let me know. I'll catch you. Sorry. Like an agile peacock. Ow! Ow. Speaking of, so great to have the gates open. Why did they shut them in the first place? Do you know the reason? Hmm? No. No. All right. Hang on! They don't call me the ""Little Dipper"" for nothing! Ohho! Like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly. Your Majesty. Let me know when you're ready for another round, Milady. Well, he was sprightly. Especially for a man in heels. Are you okay? I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time. Me, too. But it can't. Why not? It just can't. Excuse me for a minute. I'd be honored. Glad I caught you. Hans. Oop. I often had a whole parlor to myself to slide! Oh! Oops! Sorry. Your physique helps, I'm sure, too. Ah. What's this? Uh, I was born with it. Although, I dreamed I was kissed by a troll. I like it. Yeah, the whole thing. You got it. Okay, wait, wait. So, you have how many brothers? Twelve older brothers. Three of them pretended I was invisible, literally, for two years. That's horrible. It's what brothers do. And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day, she just shut me out, and I never knew why. I would never shut you out. Okay, can I just say something crazy? I love crazy.  All my life has been A series of doors in my face  And then suddenly I bump into you I was thinking the same thing, because, like...  I've been searching my whole life  To find my own place  And maybe it's the party talking  Or the chocolate fondue  But with you  But with you I found my place  I see your face  And it's nothing like I've ever known before  Love is an open  Door!  Love is an open  Door  Door  Love is an open door  With you  With you  With you  With you  Love is an open door  I mean, it's crazy What?  We finish each other's  Sandwiches That's what I was gonna say!  I've never met someone  Who thinks so much like me Jinx! Jinx again!  Our mental synchronization Can have but one explanation  You  And I  Were  Just  Meant to be  Say goodbye  Say goodbye  To the pain of the past  We don't have to feel it anymore  Love is an open door  Love is an open  Door  Door  Life can be so much more  With you  With you  With you  With you  Love is an open  Door  Door  Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me? Can I say something even crazier? Yes! Coming through. Excuse me. Oh... Pardon. Sorry. Oh! Can we just get around you there? Thank you. Oh! There she is. Elsa! I mean, Queen. Me again. Um... May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Your Majesty. We would like... Uh, your blessing... Of our marriage. Marriage? Yes! I'm sorry, I'm confused. Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course, we'll have soup, roast and ice cream. And then... Wait. Would we live here? Here? Absolutely! Anna! Oh! We can invite all 12 of your brothers to stay with us. What? No, no, no. Of course we have the room. Wait, slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married. Wait, what? May I talk to you, please? Alone. No. Whatever you have to say, you can say to both of us. Fine. You can't marry a man you just met. You can if it's true love. Anna, what do you know about true love? More than you. All you know is how to shut people out. You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me. Your Majesty, if I may ease your... No, you may not. And I think you should go. The party is over. Close the gates. Yes, Your Majesty. What? Elsa, no, no! Wait. Give me my glove! Elsa, please, please. I can't live like this anymore! Then leave. What did I ever do to you? Enough, Anna. No, why? Why do you shut me out? Why do you shut the world out? What are you so afraid of? I said, enough! Sorcery. I knew there was something dubious going on here. Elsa. There she is! Yes! It is her! Queen Elsa. Our beautiful queen! Your Majesty? Are you all right? No. There she is! Stop her! Please, just stay away from me. Stay away. Monster. Monster! Elsa! Elsa! Wait, please! Elsa, stop! Anna! No. The fjord. Snow! Snow? Yes, snow. Are you all right? No. Did you know? No. Look, it's snowing. It's snowing! The queen has cursed this land! She must be stopped! You have to go after her. Wait, no! You! Is there sorcery in you, too? Are you a monster, too? No, no. I'm completely ordinary. That's right, she is. In the best way. And my sister is not a monster. She nearly killed me! You slipped on ice. Her ice. It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this. Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So, I'm the one that needs to go after her. What? Bring me my horse, please. Anna, no. It's too dangerous. Elsa is not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right. I'm coming with you. No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle. On my honor. I leave Prince Hans in charge. Are you sure you can trust her? I don't want you getting hurt. She's my sister. She would never hurt me.  The snow glows white On the mountain tonight  Not a footprint to be seen  A kingdom of isolation  And it looks like I'm the queen  The wind is howling  Like this swirling storm inside  Couldn't keep it in Heaven knows I tried  Don't let them in Don't let them see  Be the good girl You always have to be  Conceal, don't feel Don't let them know  Well, now they know  Let it go! Let it go!  Can't hold it back anymore  Let it go! Let it go!  Turn away and slam the door  I don't care  What they're going to say  Let the storm rage on  The cold never bothered me anyway  It's funny how some distance Makes everything seem small  And the fears that once controlled me  Can't get to me at all  It's time to see what I can do  To test the limits and break through  No right, no wrong  No rules for me  I'm free!  Let it go!  Let it go!  I am one with the wind and sky  Let it go! Let it go!  You'll never see me cry  Here I stand  And here I'll stay  Let the storm rage on  My power flurries through the air  Into the ground  My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals  All around  And one thought crystallizes Like an icy blast  I'm never going back  The past is in the past  Let it go! Let it go!  And I'll rise like the break of dawn  Let it go! Let it go!  That perfect girl is gone  Here I stand  In the light of day  Let the storm rage on!  The cold never bothered me anyway  Elsa! Elsa! Elsa, it's me, Anna, your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Of course, none of it would have happened if she had just told me her secret. She's a stinker. Whoa! Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back! No, no, no! Okay. Snow. It had to be snow. She couldn't have had tropical magic that covered the fjords in white sand and warm... Fire! Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold. Ooh. ""And sauna""! Yoohoo. Hmm? Big summer blowout. Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah? Oh. Great. For now, um, how about boots? Winter boots and dresses? That would be in our winter department. Oh. Um... I was just wondering. Has another young woman... The queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here? The only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear. You and this fellow. Yoohoo. Big summer blowout. Carrots. Huh? Behind you. Oh! Right. Excuse me. Oh. A real howler in July, yes? Wherever could it be coming from? The North Mountain. North Mountain. That will be 40. Forty? No, 10. Oh, dear, that's no good. See, this is from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem. You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living. Ooh. That's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really... That's unfortunate. Still 40. But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna. Yoohoo. Hi, family. Yoohoo! Ten is all I got. Help me out. Okay. Ten will get you this and no more. Okay, just tell me one thing. What was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical? Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook, here. What did you call me? Okay, okay. I'm out. Whoa! Byebye. No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots. But I did find us a place to sleep. And it's free. I'm sorry about this violence. I will add a quart of lutefisk, so we have good feelings. Just the outfit and the boots, yah? Uh...  Reindeers are better than people  Sven, don't you think that's true?  ""Yeah, people will beat you And curse you and cheat you  ""Every one of them's bad, except you"" Aw. Thanks, buddy.  But people smell better than reindeers  Sven, don't you think I'm right?  ""That's once again true For all, except you""  You got me Let's call it a night  ""Good night""  Don't let the frostbite  Bite  Nice duet. It's just you. What do you want? I want you to take me up the North Mountain. I don't take people places. Let me rephrase that. Hey. Take me up the North Mountain. Please. Look, I know how to stop this winter. We leave at dawn. And you forgot the carrots for Sven. Oops, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't... We leave now. Right now. Whew! Hang on! We like to go fast. I like fast. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, were you raised in a barn? Ugh! No, I was raised in a castle. Hmm. So, uh, tell me, what made the queen go all icecrazy? Oh. Well... It was all my fault. I got engaged, but then she freaked out, because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage, and... Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met that day? Yeah. Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad, and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove... Hang on! You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met that day? Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is, she wore the gloves all the time so, I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt. Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers? Yes, they did. But Hans is not a stranger. Oh, yeah? What's his last name? ""Of the Southern Isles."" What's his favorite food? Sandwiches. Best friend's name? Probably John. Eye color? Dreamy. Foot size? Foot size doesn't matter. Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose? Picks his nose? And eats it. Excuse me, sir. He is a prince. All men do it. Ew. Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love. It doesn't sound like true love. Are you some sort of love expert? No. But, uh, I have friends who are. You have friends who are love experts? I'm not buying it. Stop talking. No, no, no. No, no. I'd like to meet these... No, I mean it. Sven, go. Go! What are they? Wolves. Wolves? What do we do? I got this. You just... Don't fall off, and don't get eaten. But I want to help! No. Why not? Because I don't trust your judgment. Excuse me? Who marries a man she just met? It's true love! Whoa! Whoa. Whoa! Christopher! It's ""Kristoff""! Ow! Duck! You almost set me on fire! But I didn't. Get ready to jump, Sven! You don't tell him what to do. Hey! I do! Jump, Sven! Phew! But I just paid it off. Uhoh. No. No. No! Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Grab on! Pull, Sven. Pull! Whoa. I'll replace your sled, and everything in it. And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore. Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again. It's this way? ""She'll die on her own."" I can live with that. Here we go. ""But you won't get your new sled if she's dead."" I think, actually, it's up. Sometimes, I really don't like you. Hold up! We're coming. You are? I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along. Arendelle. It's completely frozen. But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it. Will she? Yeah. Now, come on. This way to the North Mountain? More like this way. I never knew winter could be so beautiful. Yeah. It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? I'm thinking maybe some crimson, chartreuse. How about yellow? No, not yellow. Yellow and snow? No go. Am I right? Hi. You're creepy. Whoa! I don't want it. Back at you. Please don't drop me. No. Come on, it's just a head. All right. We got off to a bad start. Ew, ew, ew, the body! Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat? All right, wait one second. Oh. Uh... Oh! Thank you. You're welcome. Now, I'm perfect. Well, almost. It was like my whole life got turned upside down. Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! Head rush! I was just... Are you okay? Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose. So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn. But... Hey! Whoa! Oh. I love it even more. All right, let's start this thing over. Hi, everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs. Olaf? That's right. Olaf. And you are? Oh. Um... I'm Anna. And who's the funkylooking donkey over there? That's Sven. Uhhuh. And who's the reindeer? Sven. Oh, the... Oh. Okay. That makes things easier for me. Aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose. I like you, too. Olaf. Did Elsa build you? Yeah. Why? Do you know where she is? Fascinating. Yeah. Why? Do you think you could show us the way? Yeah. Why? How does this work? Ow! Stop it, Sven. I'm trying to focus, here. Yeah. Why? I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer. Summer? Mmmhmm. Oh. I don't know why, but I've always loved the idea of summer. And sun, and all things hot. Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat. Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes, and imagine what it would be like when summer does come.  Bees will buzz Kids will blow dandelion fuzz  And I'll be doing Whatever snow does in summer  A drink in my hand  My snow up against the burning sand  Probably getting gorgeously tanned  In summer  I'll finally see a summer breeze  Blow away a winter storm  And find out what happens to solid water  When it gets warm  And I can't wait to see  What my buddies all think of me  Just imagine how much cooler I'll be  In summer!  The hot and the cold are both so intense  Put them together It just makes sense  Winter's a good time To stay in and cuddle  But put me in summer and I'll be a...  Happy snowman!  When life gets rough  I like to hold on to my dream  Relaxing in the summer sun Just letting off steam  Oh, the sky  Will be blue  And you guys will be there, too  When I finally do  What frozen things do In summer! I'm gonna tell him. Don't you dare.  In summer!  So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's go bring back summer! I'm coming! Somebody's gotta tell him. No, no. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be faceup. Bark down is drier. Bark up! Bark down! Papa! Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak? Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness. The castle is open. There is soup and hot glogg in the great hall. Here, pass these out. Prince Hans! Are we expected to just sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods? Princess Anna has given her orders. And that's another thing! Has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all? Do not question the princess. She left me in charge and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason. Treason? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy. It's Princess Anna's horse. So, where is the princess? Where could she be? Where is she? Princess Anna is in trouble. I need volunteers to go with me to find her. I'll go. I volunteer. I volunteer two men, My Lord. Be prepared for anything. And should you encounter the queen, you are to put an end to this winter. Do you understand? Hmm. So, how exactly are you planning to stop this weather? Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister. That's your plan? My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister? Yep. So, you're not at all afraid of her? Why would I be? Yeah. I bet she's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever. Oh. Look at that. I've been impaled. What now? Mmm... It's too steep. I've only got one rope and you don't know how to climb mountains. Says who? Hmm? What are you doing? I'm going to see my sister. You're gonna kill yourself. I wouldn't put my foot there. You're distracting me. Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you? All right. I'm just blocking you out because I gotta concentrate, here. You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone. Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you. I'm not alone. I have friends, remember? You mean, the love experts? Yes, the love experts. Ah... Please tell me I'm almost there. Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? Hang on. Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you wanted to go. Haha! Thank goodness. Catch! Thanks. That was like a crazy trust exercise. Whoa. Now, that's ice. I might cry. Go ahead. I won't judge. All right, take it easy, boy. Come here. I got you. Okay. You stay right here, buddy. Flawless. Knock. Just knock. Why isn't she knocking? Do you think she knows how to knock? Huh. It opened. That's a first. Oh. You should probably wait out here. What? The last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything. But, but... Oh, come on! It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life! Bye, Sven. You, too, Olaf. Me? Just give us a minute. Okay. One, two, three... Four... Whoa. Elsa? It's me, Anna. Anna. Whoa. Elsa, you look different. It's a good different. And this place... It's amazing. Thank you. I never knew what I was capable of. I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd have known... No, no, no. It's okay. You don't have to apologize, but you should probably go. Please. But I just got here. You belong down in Arendelle. So do you. No, Anna, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody. Actually, about that... Sixty! Wait. What is that? Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs! Olaf? Yeah. You built me. Remember that? And you're alive? Um... I think so. He's just like the one we built as kids. Yeah. Elsa, we were so close. We can be like that again. Catch me! Slow down! Anna! No. We can't. Goodbye, Anna. Elsa, wait. No, I'm just trying to protect you. You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again.  Please don't slam the door  You don't have to keep Your distance anymore  'Cause for the first time in forever  I finally understand  For the first time in forever  We can fix this hand in hand We can head down this mountain together.  You don't have to live in fear  'Cause for the first time in forever  I will be right here Anna.  Please go back home  Your life awaits  Go enjoy the sun And open up the gates Yeah, but... I know.  You mean well But leave me be  Yes, I'm alone  But I'm alone and free  Just stay away And you'll be safe from me  Actually, we're not  What do you mean, you're not?  I get the feeling you don't know  What do I not know?  Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep  Deep snow  What? You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere. Everywhere? Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it. No, I can't. I don't know how. Sure you can. I know you can.  'Cause for the first time in forever  Oh, I'm such a fool! I can't be free!  You don't have to be afraid  No escape from the storm inside of me  We can work this out together  I can't control the curse!  We'll reverse the storm you've made  Anna, please you'll only make it worse!  Don't panic  There's so much fear!  We'll make the sun shine bright  You're not safe here!  We can face this thing together  No!  We can change this winter weather  And everything will be all right  I can't!  Anna! Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm fine. Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. Just... You have to go. No, I know we can figure this out together. How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me? Anna, I think we should go. No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa. Yes, you are. Stop! Put us down! Go away. Heads up! Watch out for my butt! It is not nice to throw people! Whoa, whoa, whoa, feistypants. Okay, relax. Just calm down! Calm down! Okay! All right! I'm okay. Just let the snowman be. I'm calm. Great. Oh! Come on! Oh. Look, see? Now, you made him mad. I'll distract him. You guys go. No, no! Not you guys! This just got a whole lot harder. Look out! Run! Run! What are you doing? I got him! Whoa! Stop! It's a 100foot drop. It's 200. Ow! What's that for? I'm digging a snow anchor. Okay. What if we fall? There's 20 feet of fresh powder down there. It'll be like landing on a pillow. Hopefully. Okay, Anna. On three. Okay. One... You tell me when. I'm ready to go. Two... I was born ready! Yes! Calm down. Tree! What the... Whoa! That happened. Man, am I out of shape. There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where did you guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there. Hey! We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things. No! This is not making much of a difference, is it? Olaf! Hang in there, guys! Go. Go faster! Wait, what? Hey! Ow! Kristoff! Don't come back! We won't. Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow. Olaf! I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs! Those are my legs. Ooh! Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt. Oh. That feels better. Hey, Sven! He found us. Who's my cute little reindeer? Don't talk to him like that. You're tickling me. Here. Whoa! Are you okay? Thank you. How's your head? Ah! Ooh! It's fine. Uh... Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull. I don't have a skull. Or bones. So, uh... So, now what? Now what? Now what? Oh... What am I gonna do? She threw me out. I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then there's your ice business. Hey, hey. Don't worry about my ice business. Worry about your hair! What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair. No, yours is turning white. White? It's... What? It's because she struck you, isn't it? Does it look bad? No. You hesitated. No, I didn't. Anna, you need help, okay? Come on. Okay! Where are we going? To see my friends. The love experts? Love experts? Uhhuh. And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this. How do you know? Because I've seen them do it before. I like to consider myself a love expert. Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't feel! Look, Sven, the sky is awake. Are you cold? A little. Uh... Wait. Come here. Huh? Ooh. So, uh, about my friends. Well... I say ""friends""... They're more like family. Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven. Until they, you know, kinda took us in. They did? Yeah. I don't want to scare you. They can be a little inappropriate and loud. Very loud. They are also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really, heavy. But you'll get it. They mean well. Kristoff, they sound wonderful. Okay, then. Meet my family. Hey, guys. They're rocks. You are a sight for sore eyes. He's crazy. Rocko's looking sharp, as usual. Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you. You lost so much weight. I'll distract him while you run. Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you. Because I love you, Anna, I insist you run. I understand you're love experts. Ooh! Why aren't you running? Uh... Okay. Well, I'm gonna go. Go. No, no, no. Anna, wait. Kristoff! Whoa! Hey! Kristoff's home! Kristoff's here! Kristoff's home! Wait, ""Kristoff""? Uhhuh. Ah, let me look at you. Take off your clothes, I wash them. No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on. Look, it's great to see you all, but where's Granpabbie? He's napping. But look, I grew a mushroom. I... I earned my fire crystal. I passed a kidney stone. Kristoff, pick me up. You're getting big. Good for you. Trolls. They're trolls! He's brought a girl! A girl! Whoa! Is that a real girl? She's like a little cupcake. What's going on? I've learned to just roll with it. Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose, strong teeth! Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no. No. You've got the wrong idea. No. That's not why I brought her here. Right. We're not... I'm not... What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man?  Is it the clumpy way he walks? What?  Or the grumpy way he talks? Oh, no.  Or the pearshaped, squareshaped  Weirdness of his feet? Hey!  And though we know he washes well  He always ends up sort of smelly  But you'll never meet a fella  Who's as sensitive and sweet That's nice, but...  So, he's a bit of a fixerupper Whoa, whoa, whoa...  So, he's got a few flaws  Like his peculiar brain, dear  His thing with the reindeer  That's a little outside of nature's laws This is not about me!  So, he's a bit of a fixerupper  But this we're certain of  You can fix this fixerupper up  With a little bit of love Um... Can we please just stop talking about this? We've got a real, actual problem, here. I'll say. So, tell me, dear...  Is it the way that he runs scared?  Or that he's socially impaired?  Or that he only likes To tinkle in the woods? I don't need to know that.  Are you holding back your fondness  Due to his unmanly blondness?  Or the way he covers up That he's the honest goods?  He's just a bit of a fixerupper  He's got a couple of bugs No, I don't!  His isolation is confirmation  Of his desperation for healing hugs Aw.  So, he's a bit of fixerupper  But we know what to do  The way to fix up this fixerupper  Is to fix him up with you Whoa! Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough! She is engaged to someone else, okay?  So, she's a bit of fixerupper  That's a minor thing  Her quote ""engagement"" Is a flex arrangement  And by the way, I don't see no ring  So, she's a bit of a fixerupper Hey! Whoa, watch it!  Her brain's a bit betwixt  Get the fiance out of the way  And the whole thing will be fixed  We're not saying you can change him  'Cause people don't really change  We're only saying that love's a force  That's powerful and strange  People make bad choices  If they're mad or scared or stressed  But throw a little love their way  Throw a little love their way  And you'll bring out their best  True love brings out the best  Everyone's a bit of a fixerupper  That's what it's all about Father! Sister! Brother!  We need each other to raise us up  And round us out  Everyone's a bit of a fixerupper  But when push comes to shove  The only fixerupper fixer  That can fix a fixerupper is...  True, true  True, true  True  Love!  Love, love, love  Love True love  True Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded... Wait, what? You're getting married.  Love!  Anna? She's as cold as ice. There is strange magic here. Granpabbie. Come, come. Bring her here to me. Anna, your life is in danger. There is ice in your heart put there by your sister. If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever. What? No. But you can remove it, right? I cannot. I'm sorry, Kristoff. If it was her head, that would be easy. But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart. An act of true love? A true love's kiss, perhaps? Something's wrong. Are you all right? Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans. Hans. Pull us out, Sven. Olaf, come on! I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans? We are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen. Do you understand? Yes, Your Grace. The queen. Go, go! Come on! There! Up there! Come on! We got her. No. Please. Go around. Toss it. Stay away! Look out! Fire! Fire! Get her! Ah! Come on! Grab his arm. Aim... This way, this way! Whoa! Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster they fear you are. Oh, no. What have... What have I done? Why did you bring me here? I couldn't just let them kill you. But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna. Anna has not returned. If you would just stop the winter. Bring back summer, please. Don't you see? I can't. You have to tell them to let me go. I will do what I can. Just hang in there. Come on, buddy, faster! Oh, boy! Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle! Stay out of sight, Olaf. I will! Hello! It's alive! It's Princess Anna! Are you gonna be okay? Don't worry about me. Anna! You had us worried sick. My Lady. Get her warm. And find Prince Hans, immediately. We will. Thank you. Make sure she's safe. Oh, you poor girl, you're freezing. Oh, let's get you inside now and get you warm. I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna. You cannot risk going out there again. If anything happens to her... If anything happens to the princess, you are all Arendelle has left. He's in here. Prince Hans. Anna. You're so cold. Hans, you have to kiss me. What? Now! Now! Slow down. We'll give you two some privacy. What happened out there? Elsa struck me with her powers. You said she would never hurt you. I was wrong. Anna. She froze my heart, and only an act of true love can save me. A true love's kiss. Oh, Anna. If only there was someone out there who loved you. What? You said you did. As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I would have to marry into the throne somewhere. What... What are you talking about? As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you... Hans! You were so desperate for love, you were willing to marry me just like that. I figured after we married, I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa. Hans! No. Stop. But then, she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her. Please. All that's left now is to kill Elsa, and bring back summer. You're no match for Elsa. No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction. You won't get away with this. Oh... I already have. Please, somebody, help. Please. Please. It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death. Prince Hans. Princess Anna is... Dead. What? What happened to her? She was killed. By Queen Elsa. No! Her own sister. At least we got to say our marriage vows before she died in my arms. There can be no doubt now. Queen Elsa is a monster, and we are all in grave danger. Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you. With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason. And sentence her to death. Hurry up! She's dangerous. Move quickly. Careful. It won't open! It's frozen shut. Put your back into it! Come on! Push! What is it, buddy? Hey, watch it. What's wrong with you? I don't understand you when you talk like that. Stop it! Put me down! No, Sven! We're not going back. She's with her true love. What the... Anna! Come on! Come on, boy. Help. Anna! Oh, no. Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there. Wow! So, this is heat. I love it. Ooh! But don't touch it. So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss? I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love. But we ran all the way here. Please, Olaf, you can't stay here. You'll melt. I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you. Do you happen to have any ideas? I don't even know what love is. That's okay, I do. Love is putting someone else's needs before yours. Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever. Kristoff loves me? Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you? Olaf, you're melting. Some people are worth melting for. Just maybe not right this second. Don't worry, I've got it. We're gonna get through... Oh, wait. Hang on, I'm getting something. It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way. They... They are? Wow! He's really moving fast. I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind. Help me up, Olaf. Please. No, no, no! You need to stay by the fire and keep warm. I need to get to Kristoff. Why? Oh, I know why! There's your act of true love right there! Riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on! Look out! Oh! Uh... Back this way. We're trapped. Oh... Whoa! Slide, Anna! We made it! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Come on, buddy, faster. Kristoff! Keep going! Kristoff! Come on! No. Whoa! Whoa! Sven... Sven! Good boy. Kristoff. Kristoff... Anna... Anna! Elsa! You can't run from this! Just take care of my sister. Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said that you froze her heart. No. I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white. Your sister is dead. Because of you. No. Kristoff. Anna! Elsa? No! Anna! Oh. Anna! No, no! Please, no. Anna? Anna? Oh, Elsa. You sacrificed yourself for me? I love you. ""An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."" ""Love will thaw."" Love. Of course. Elsa? Love! I knew you could do it. Hands down, this is the best day of my life. And, quite possibly, the last. Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy. Oh, oh, oh! My own personal flurry! Uhuhuhuh. Anna? But she froze your heart. The only frozen heart around here is yours. Wonderful! Setting course, sir. I will return this scoundrel to his country. We shall see what his 12 big brothers think of his behavior. Arendelle thanks you, milord. This is unacceptable. I am a victim of fear. I've been traumatized. Ah! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor that I could see? And I demand to see the queen! Oh. I have a message from the queen. ""Arendelle will henceforth and forever ""no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown."" ""Weselton."" It's Weselton! Let's go. Come on, come on, come on! Okay, okay, here I come. Pole! Whoops! Sorry. Okay, okay. Here we are. Oh! I owe you a sled. Are you serious? Yes! And it's the latest model. No, I can't accept this. You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer. What? That's not a thing. Oh, sure it is. And it even has a cup holder. Do you like it? Like it? I love it! Whoa. I could kiss you! I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd... May I? We me. I mean, may we? Wait, what? We may. Mmm. Summer! Ooh... Hello. Are you ready? Ice! Ooh! Whoohoo... Swing me. Ooh... I like the open gates. We are never closing them again. Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't skate. Come on! You can do it! Look out. Reindeer coming through. I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it. Hey, guys! That's it, Olaf. Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot. Go. Oh!"
Incredibles 2,Disney,2010,2018,Animation,"Agent Rick Dicker interrogating. State your name, please. Uh, Tony. Tony Rydinger. Tell me about the incident. Well, there's this girl, um, in my class. I saw her at the track meet. You're, uh, Violet, right? That's me. I sort of knew her, but she'd changed. Relaxed. She was more sure of herself. Cool, cute. I asked her out to a movie. So, Friday? Friday. Friday. And I went to watch the track meet. Not long after, this thing happened in the parking lot. Behold! The Underminer! I am always beneath you, but nothing is beneath me! As if things aren't weird enough, I look over and I see these boots. You two, stay here. Wait. Should we be doing this? It is still illegal. They looked like superheroes. We're gonna lose him. Oh, all right. One of you patrol the perimeter, keep the crowds back and safe. The other, watch after JackJack. But I thought we were gonna go with You heard your mother. Trampoline me. I call perimeter! You're not going anywhere, you little maggoty creep! I see my chance to get out of there. But there's something familiar about one of the kids' voices. The girl, she's upset and she throws down her mask and it's her! Oh. Tony! Hi. Uh, this isn't what you think it is. It was just getting too freaky. I couldn't handle it and ran off. I feel kinda bad about it. Maybe I should've said ""hi"" or something? It's not her fault superheroes are illegal. And it's not like I don't like strong girls. I'm pretty secure manhood wise. What is that? Have you told anyone else about this? Your parents? No, they'd only think I was hiding something. You know what I mean? Sure, kid. I like this girl, Mr. Dicker. I'm supposed to go out with her Friday night. Now, things are just gonna be weird. I wish I could forget I ever saw her in that suit. You will, kid. You will. *INCREDIBLES 2*  Come on! Consider yourself undermined! Ooh. Underminer! Oh! We meet again Huh? Oh, great! Now, he's on the agenda. Incredible! Meet Jack Hammer! Buhbye! No, no, no! No, no, no! Everybody, stay back! Okay? Stay back! You're not sticking me with babysitting! I can't steer it or stop it. And the Underminer's escaped! We'll have to stop it Bob! The monorail! Frozone! Yeah! We have to stop this thing before it gets to the overpass! I'll try to keep it away from the buildings! Hey, lady! Thank you so much, young man! What? Violet! Oh, oh. Ahh! Stop! Everybody, stop! Ah, hah! Heads up, Dad! Dash! Violet! Who's watching JackJack? Dash is watching him! Violet, here, you take him! It's headed for City Hall! Mom needs help! They're out in public again! This is our chance! Follow them, follow Frozone! Bob! Help me with the boiler! That should do it! What are you kids doing? Get out of here! This thing's gonna blow! There's no time! We did it! Freeze, Supers! Oh, what did we do? Excuse me, Mr. Zone? Sorry, but I'm not really supposed to be here. Which seems wrong doesn't it? Perhaps you'd be interested in changing that law? Superheroes including Frozone, Mr. Incredible, and Elasti Girl caused further damage to the city. The Underminer remains at large. We didn't start this fight. Well, you didn't finish it either! Did you stop the Underminer from inflicting more damage? No. Did you stop him from robbing the banks? No. Did you catch him? No. The banks were insured. We have infrastructure in place to deal with these matters. If you had simply done nothing everything would now be proceeding in an orderly fashion. You'd have preferred we do nothing? Without a doubt. You weren't much help. Do you want out of the hole? First you gotta put down the shovel. Well, that went poorly. Dad, this is probably not the best time to tell you about this but something else happened today with a kid and my mask. Oh, hey, Rick. Violet thinks a friend of hers, a kid named Tony might have seen her in the outfit, without her mask. Talkative type? Don't know. Last name is Rydinger. Tony Rydinger. I'll check it out. Bob, Helen a word if you don't mind. Uh, the program's been shut down. What? Politicians don't understand people who do good simply because it's right. It makes 'em nervous. They've been gunning for Supers for years. Today was all they needed. Anyway I'm done. I'm afraid two more weeks in the motel is the best I can do for ya. It ain't much. You've done plenty, Rick. We won't forget. Well, it has been a great honor working with you good people. Thanks for everything, and good luck. Yeah. You, too. Did you wash your hands? With soap? Did you dry them? What? Is this all vegetables? Who ordered all vegetables? I did. They're good and you're going to have some. Are we going to talk about it? What? The elephant in the room. What elephant? I guess not then. You're referring to today. Yeah, what's the deal with today? We all made mistakes. For example, you kids were supposed to watch JackJack. Babysitting, while you guys did the important stuff. We talked about this. You're not old enough to decide about these things. We are old enough to help out. Yeah! Isn't that what you tell us, Dad? Yeah, well, ""help out"" can mean many different things. But we're supposed to help, if there's trouble. Aren't you glad Well, yeah, but we helped today? Yeah, I know but You said that you were proud of us. Well, yeah, I was. Am! We wanna fight bad guys! No, you don't! You said things were different now. And they were, on the island. But I didn't mean that from now on So now, we've gotta go back to never using our powers. It defines who I am. We're not saying you have What? Someone on TV said it. Can we just eat? The dinner, while it's hot? Did we do something wrong? Yes. No. We didn't do anything wrong. Superheroes are illegal. Whether it's fair or not, that's the law. The law should be fair. What are we teaching our kids? To respect the law! Even when the law is disrespectful? If laws are unjust, there are laws to change them! Otherwise, it's chaos! Which is exactly what we have! I just thought it was kinda cool. What was? Fighting crime as a family. It was cool. But it's over. The world is what it is. We have to adapt. Are things bad? Things are fine. May I be excused? How much longer in the motel, Dad? Uh Not much longer, honey. What are we gonna do? I don't know. Maybe Dicker will find something? Dicker is done, Bob. Any thought we had about being Supers again is fantasy. One of us has gotta get a job. One of us? You did a long stint at Insuricare. Hated every minute of it. I know it was hard on you. Maybe it's my turn in the private sector and you take care of the kids No, I'm doing this. I need to do this. You know where my suit and ties are? Burned up when The jet destroyed our house. The jet destroyed our house. Yeah. We can't count on anyone else now, Bob. It's just us. We can't wait for No lifeguard on duty! Swim at your own risk. Oh, where'd you go today? I noticed you missed all the fun. Don't be mad because I know when to leave a party. I'm just as illegal as you guys. Besides, I knew the cops would let you go. Yeah, in spite of Bob's best efforts. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard the program shut down. How much longer are you in this motel? Two weeks. Now, you know the offer still stands. You're very generous, but there are five of us. We wouldn't do that to you and Honey. Well, door's always open. You know, the news isn't all bad. While you guys were being detained I was approached by a dude who represents this tycoon. Winston Deavor. Wants to talk with me, with you two, about hero stuff. I checked him out. He's legit. Trained under Dicker. He wants to meet. Ah, jeez! More superhero trouble. We just came from the police station, Lucius. When? Tonight. I'm going there now. You enjoy, I'm sitting this one out. He wants all three of us. Honey, let's just at least hear what he has to say. You got the address, I'll meet you guys there. Go in our Supersuits? Yeah. Might wanna wear the old Supersuits. Got a feeling he's nostalgic. Where are you going? The fresh air is especially good tonight. If JackJack wakes up I know the drill. Your security badges. Please, this way. Hey, listen, you're my biggest fan. Good to see you. I'm your biggest fan. Shoot! I love superheroes! The powers, the costumes the mythic struggles. Winston Deavor. You can call me Win. Genuine pleasure to meet you. Frozone! It's good to see you. Elasti Girl. Nice to meet you. Mr. Incredible! Hello. Mr. Incredible, Incredible Incredible Incredible Catching the bad guys Catching the bad guys Pow, pow, pow Pow, pow, pow Who's the cat Who's always chill When survival odds are close to nil Frozone Frozone Frozone Frozone Yeah! Can't tell you what a thrill this is. And this Oh, hello there, superheroes. I'm so sorry I'm late. is my tardy sister, Evelyn. And I'm I'm scolding myself so you don't have to, Winston! Spectacular. My father was so proud that I was even remotely connected to you guys. He used to call you the last line of defense. He was your top supporter. He donated to superhero causes. He raised money for the Dynaguy statue in Avery Park. He got to know many Supers personally. Even installed a phone with direct lines to Gazerbeam and Fironic in case of emergencies. He loved that, showed it off to everyone. He was heartbroken when you were all forced to go underground. Father believed the world would become more dangerous without you. He didn't know how right he was. There was a break in. My father called Gazerbeam. The direct line. No answer. He called Fironic, no answer. Superheroes had just been made illegal The robbers discovered him on the phone and shot him. So It must've been hard. Especially for Mother. She died a few months later. Heartbreak. If superheroes had not been forced underground it never would've happened. Or Dad could've taken Mom to the safe room as soon as he knew there was trouble. I disagree strongly! But we're not going into it right now. The point is nobody expected us to be able to actually run Dad's company. But with Evelyn as designer, and myself as operator uh, we threw ourselves into building DEVTECH into what it is today. A world class telecommunications company. Bigger than ever. Perfectly positioned to make some wrong things right. Hence, this meeting. Let me ask you something. What is the main reason you were all forced underground? Ignorance. Perception. Take today for example, with the Underminer. Difficult situation. You were faced with a lot of hard decisions. Oh, tell me about it. I can't. Because I didn't see it neither did anyone else. So, when you fight bad guys like today people don't see the fight or what led up to it. They see what politicians tell them to see. They see destruction and they see you. So, if we wanna change people's perceptions about superheroes we need you to share your perceptions with the world. How do we do that? With cameras. We need you to share your perceptions with the world. How do we do that? We embed tiny cameras, like those, into your Supersuits. Wow, so small. And the picture is outstanding. Thanks! Designed 'em myself. We've got resources, lobbyists, worldwide connections and very important, insurance. Insurance is key. All we need now are the superest superheroes. It needs you three. Come on! Help me make all Supers legal again. This sounds great! Let's get this going. What's my first assignment? That enthusiasm is golden. Now hold on to it. But for our first move Well, Elasti Girl is our best play. Better than me? I mean, she's good. Really, a credit to her You know. You know. With great respect let's not test the whole ""insurance will pay for everything"" idea on the first go 'round, okay? Wait a minute. You're saying what? I'm messy? Well, Evelyn did a cost benefit analysis comparing all your last five years of crime fighting before going underground. And Elasti Girl's numbers are self explanatory. Well, it's not a fair comparison! Heavyweight problems need heavyweight solutions. Of course! We're gonna solve all kinds of problems together. After the perfect launch with Elasti Girl! So, what do you say? What do I say? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? A few hours ago, you were saying it was over and being a superhero was a fantasy. Now, you get the offer of a lifetime and you don't know? It's not that simple, Bob. I wanna protect the kids! So do I. From jail, Bob! And how do you do that? By turning down a chance to change the law that forces them to hide what they are? They haven't decided what they are. They're still kids. Kids with powers, which makes them Supers whether they decide to use those powers or not. This will benefit them. What? It's not a good time to be away. Dash is having trouble with homework Vi is worried about her first date with that boy she likes, Tony and JackJack JackJack? What's wrong with him? Okay, nothing's wrong with JackJack. But even a normal baby needs a lot of attention. I'm just not sure I can leave. Of course you can leave. You've got to. So that I we can be Supers again, so our kids can have that choice. So you can have that choice. All right, yes! So I can have that choice. And I would do a great job! Regardless of what Deavor's pie charts say or whatever But they want you. And you'll do a great job too. Well, that was excruciating to watch. I can't lie to you. It's nice to be wanted. Flattering, you know, but But what's the choice? One, do this right, get well paid, we're out of the motel and things get better for all Supers, including our kids. Or two I find a job in two weeks or we're homeless. You know it's crazy, right? To help my family, I gotta leave it. To fix the law, I gotta break it. You'll be great. I know I will. But what about you? We have kids. I'll watch the kids, no problem. Easy. Easy, huh? You're adorable. Well, if there is a problem, I'll drop this thing and come right back. You won't need to. I got it, you go do this thing. Do it so I can do it better. Deavor here. This is Elasti Girl. I'm in. Mr. Deavor, it's wonderful but it's too generous. Nonsense! That's the least we can do. We're partners now! Can't have my partners living in a motel. But whose house? Is it a house? It's my house. I have several. I'm not using that one. Stay as long as you need. I don't know what to say. How about ""thanks""? This is our new house? Okay, easy, tiger. It's being loaned to us. This is homey. Look at this place. Deavor bought it from an eccentric billionaire who liked to come and go without being seen so the house has multiple hidden exits. Good thing we won't stand out. Wouldn't want to attract any unnecessary attention. It's got a big yard! Isn't this a bit much? Near a forest! Would you rather be at the motel? And a pool! What exactly is Mom's new job? The important thing is we're out of the motel. I like Mom's new job! Oh, ho, ho! Whoa. Well, check out the water features. Oh! Wow. Wicked cool! Hey! Dash! Stop it! Not the couch! Stop it! No! Dash! Stop! Don't touch the buttons! The couch! Dash! No! No, no! Oh, no. Oh, boy. This isn't me. I'm not all dark and angsty. I'm Elasti Girl. I'm, you know, flexible.

She's up and out. She's at her new job doing hero work. But I thought superheroes were still illegal. They are, for now. So Mom is getting paid to break the law? She's not breaking She's an advocate for superheroes. It's a new job. So, Mom is going out illegally to explain why she shouldn't be illegal. Hey Hey! The bus is here! Whoa! Grab your stuff quickly! Go on, get on the Put your homework in your pack! Byebye! We're gonna get along just fine 'cause you don't ask any hard questions. All right. All locations, we need to know where you want us. Stand by. Seems strange to wait for crime. Relax. You're smack in the middle of the worst crime area in the city. It's perfect. It's a superhero's playground. ""It's a superhero's playground."" Right. You know, after we went underground my husband used to listen to a police scanner waiting for something to happen. And I got mad at him for it. Oh, I'm such a hypocrite. All units. Something's up. We've been picking up some chatter about potential disruptions to the hovertrain's opening ceremony. Disruption or threat? Both. Station's at Fifty Fourth and Nottingham. A potential threat! Perfect! Fifty fourth and Nottingham. Go, go, go! Hey, Vi! I want you back here by 10:30. 11ish? 10ish, heading for 9:30ish. 10:30ish it is. Enjoy the movie.

That's not the way you're supposed to do it, Dad. They want us to do it this way. I don't know that way! Why would they change math? It's okay, Dad. Math is math! Math is math! I'll just wait for Mom to get back. What? She won't understand it any better than I do The Outer Limits.

And I'm willing to admit that New Urbem is not the only city Are you sure the police are gonna be okay with this? Sure. You're making life easy for them. They still haven't forgiven us for the last time we made life easy for them. I know the Chief of Police. There won't be a problem. With all due respect if you alone had handled the Underminer things would have been different. I'm just saying. on budget and ahead of schedule to launch our magnificent new hovertrain. It can get you where you need to go at ridiculous speeds. The future is open for business! Wait. The train has stopped. It's going the wrong direction. It's going the wrong way. I'm going after it. This thing's really moving. 100 and climbing. How much track is built? About 25 miles. No one can shut this thing down? They've tried. Nogo. Is that Elasti Girl? Overrides? They're locked out of the system. What about a fail safe? Not enough time. Someone's calling! Switching over. Hey, Mom. I can't find my high tops and Dad can't find them either. But he won't call you and ask, so I am. Do not call your mother! Dash, honey. Can't talk right now. Look under your bed, okay. How much time? Less than two minutes! There's a shortcut.

What happened? Honey, why are you Don't say anything. It's Dad. Are you okay? I'm fine. I don't wanna talk about it. Tony didn't even call? I don't wanna talk about it. Oh, honey Dad! If you want me to feel better, then leave me alone. Please? See, there's nothing a cop hates worse than a missing child. My kid brother's son. Today is his first birthday. Oh, but if anybody can find that child, it's you, Roman. Because you're a wonderful policeman. This is a holdup. All right, get your hands up, turn your back. Put your hands behind your heads and keep them there! Don't move! Drop that. All right, now get over there. Watch the door. You think I'm kiddin'? Now. I said now! I got it!

All done. So, things haven't spiraled out of control the moment I left? Amazing as it may seem, it has been quite uneventful in fact. How about you? I saved a runaway train! It was so great! The mayor was there to cut the ribbon on this new train. Elasti Girl pursued the train and was able to successfully activate Blah, blah, blah. He says a few words, cuts the ribbon and the train starts pulling out of the station backwards track of its brand new hovertrain hovertrain malfunctioned thanking Elasti Girl ..deemed to almost Superhero Elasti Girl Elasti Girl Boom!

And on your first night! I am so proud of you, really. I'm proud of you, honey. I know you want to get out there and you will soon. And you'll be amazing. I couldn't have done this if you hadn't taken over so well. Thanks for handling everything. It's nothing. I love you, honey. I'll be back soon. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams, honey. ""Hey, Dad, it's okay. ""I'll just wait for Mom to get home."" As if she could I know how to I can do math. Oh, brother Wait for Mom! What am I, a substitute parent? It's not my fault they changed math. Come on, buddy. Come on. I think I understand your math assignment. We still have some time to finish it before your test. So first, you wanna put all the numbers by themselves on one side. you change the sign. That means a plus becomes a minus and a minus You got it? Yeah, baby! Oh. Uh, hello. We're in a new house. I did write my address on your locker in permanent ink. Oh, is that what that is? Did you forget? Forget what? That's funny. Points for funny. Oh, was it the weird outfit? Because there's a reason. I'm in a drama class and they just wanna do Shakespeare but they're like, ""Try to make it relevant for the kids."" So, like, ""Oh, superheroes! Kids love superheroes."" Yeah, yeah, yeah. You wanna wear one kind of tights and then they're like, ""No, wear these other kind of tights."" Do I know you? Many say your speech today is critical. Both sides just want the best for their people. We are so close to finally getting peace in the region. I haven't done this in a while. This is good. The train gives us momentum. Just go out there and be your charming self and capitalize on it. Ms. Elasti Girl, they're ready for you. Hey, stretch a leg. Thank you, Chad. It was fun. Ambassador, your documents. We're moving to the rooftop. Oh, Madame Ambassador, hello! Oh, you are Elasti Girl! This is why now I'm shaking your hand. It was so sad when you went underground. I am glad to see you back in your shiny outfit. That means so much coming from you. Good luck with your speech. This way, Ambassador. Uh, uh. Bring lasting peace! I will, when you defeat evil. Okay. Three, two For over 15 years, superheroes have been in hiding. Forced into it by a society no longer willing to support them. That may soon be changing due to a growing movement to bring the Supers back. Here, fresh on the heels of her own heroic save of a runaway train and sporting a new look, is the superhero, Elasti Girl. Welcome! Hello, Chad. All the polls are going in your direction. That's true. Things are good Hello. Uh, hello? Do I have your attention? Yes, Chad. Of course I do. I'm appearing on your screen. Reading the words I'm saying off of another screen. Screens are everywhere. We are controlled by screens. And screens are controlled by me Screenslaver. Hey! I control this broadcast and this idiotic anchorman you see before you. What's wrong with him? The signal's been hijacked. I'll check it out. Don't look at any monitors. I could hijack the ambassador's aerocade while it's still airborne. Right, Elasti Girl? Nearest window! Where's the nearest window? Oh, what's going on? Where's Elasti Girl? Which one? Elasti Girl! What are you doing here? The ambassador is in danger. Which chopper is she Look out! Follow them and get me close! Get out of the sky, and touch down safely! Stand down! It's Elasti Girl. Stay in your seat, ma'am! We're under attack! Quick, go! Protect the ambassador! Open the door! Do as she says! Can you all swim? Yeah. No! We're gonna have to slingshot! Hang on! Are you all right, ma'am? I'm perfectly fine Ah! Ooh! Ah! Oh! Boys are jerks and superheroes suck. Good morning! He takes one look at me in that suit and decides to pretend he doesn't even know me. Well. He's protecting himself. If he really did see you, it's best that he forget. It's better for you, too. Um. I can't I can't tell you how many memories Dicker's had to erase over the years when someone figured out your mother's or my identity. It was Dicker! You told him about Tony! Honey You had me erased from Tony's mind! I hate superheroes! And I renounce them! I renounce them! Is she having adolescence? A new report out today shows that, when it comes to decision making people have more trust in a monkey throwing darts than Congress. What's going on, Tommy? A protest? They're here in support. Support? Support of what? Well, in support of you. Wow. Oh, hey Thanks for coming out. Hi. Oh, my goodness. Thanks so much. Oh, hello. What does your sign say? Kaboom! Kapow! Supers should be legal now! Talk to ya. Oh, what do ya know! Ellenwood. Oh, now you wanna return my calls about superheroes, huh? Oh. I'll have to call you back. Oh, that felt good. Felicia, hold my calls, please. Eh! Hey! It's working! Hey, the ambassador made a big speech about superheroes today. Turns out saving someone's life makes a good impression on them. Who knew, huh? I'm getting calls from all over the world. Media awareness is up 72%. The push for superhero legalization is becoming a worldwide movement! I have big plans for our next move. We're gonna have a summit at sea. We'll use our ship we'll gather leaders and Supers from all over the world. That's great. I'm happy. I'm happy the numbers are up. I'm happy the ambassador is pro superhero and I'm happy you're happy. I'm hearing that you're happy, but why am I not feeling it? Because I didn't get him! Screenslaver is still out there. All I did was play his game and win this round. He's gonna want more and as long as he gets to play, he wins. One thing I've learned in business? Smell the flowers. They don't bloom that often. What do you want on your tombstone? ""She worried a lot""? All right, stop talking. Show her. This is just so exciting, isn't it? Huh? Oh, wow. Uh Wow! Elasti Girl, there you are. Hello. I didn't Wow! Come on, get yourself together, Karen. Hi, my superhero name is Voyd. I just wanna thank you, for, like, for being you! I'm just no, I just like the Okay, what I can do, um, is this. Yeah. That is impressive. Very interdimensional. I felt like an outcast before. But now, with you being you, I feel like Yay, me. I flew them in from all over. They've all been in hiding. They have powers, secret identities and names they've given themselves. I'm Screech. It's a pleasure. I've always considered you the gold standard for superheroes. Well, thanks. You're too nice. I am called Brick. Nice to meet you, Brick. Uh, where are you from? Wisconsin. Oh. Elasti Girl. I assume your powers are You know, zapping things electrically charging things, bolts of lightning, that kind of stuff. Name's Reflux. Medical condition or superpower, you decide. That's a little line I say just to put people at ease. Hope I don't offend. Oh, no, no, no. Reflux. Love it. Well, I do look forward to working with you. Yes, that is impressive. Keep practicing. Ow! Well, I'm beat. Congratulations. Big day. Good night, ladies. I will see you tomorrow. Good night. Must be nice for you, being out front after all this time. Out front? Well, it's been a while since your superhero days and even then, you were kind of in Mr. Incredible's shadow. Nah, I beg to differ. I'm not I'm not saying you weren't big. No, you were, and are, a superstar but you have the stage to yourself now. And people have to pay attention. Oh, you mean, ""It's a man's world"" and all that? Well, what world do you live in? Your brother runs DEVTECH. I don't want his job. I invent, he sells. I ask you, which of us has the greater influence? Which side of me are you asking? The believer or the cynic? The cynic Would say selling is more important, because the best sellers have the most buyers. Doesn't matter what you're selling. It only matters what people buy. This is true. If I discovered the origin of the universe my brother would find a way to market it as a, uh, foot massager. So, what would the believer say? The believer would tell you to make your mark. Don't wait for permission, assert yourself and impose your will on the status quo. Sounds like my brother. What? You sound like my brother. Well, he's not wrong. There is an art to getting a reaction Oh! I know how to get him. My brother? No. Screenslaver! You're tech savvy. I need to lock onto a signal and trace its origin. How fast can you slap something together and meet me at the airport? Airport? Need to go out of town, pronto. I can get your contraption together by 5:00 a.m. I need to get on TV. Chad! I'll get my brother to set up an exclusive with him tonight on the newscast. Finish our interview by phone! Promote the hell out of it. Independence from Screenslavery! Chad tonight. Boom! Dicker. Yeah, hey, Rick. You remember that kid I mentioned to you? Tony Rydinger. Mind wipe? Yeah, nice kid. Well, you also wiped out the Friday night date my daughter had with him. In fact, you wiped out my daughter. Oops. Not an exact science, Bob. Rick, you gotta help me here. Violet hates me, and you, and superheroes. I gotta fix this. What do you know about Tony? Um Not much. Seems like a good kid. Popular, plays sports, music. Parents own The Happy Platter, kid works there part time. Happy Platter? Why did we drive all the way across town for The Happy Platter? We'd like a booth over there, near the philodendron. Good, right? Near the philodendron. This platter doesn't look all that happy to me. It looks bored. Haha! The Bored Platter! I thought Vi would want a change of pace from drive in food. I like drive in food. Does this mean vegetables? A balanced diet means vegetables, kiddo. Get used to it. Good evening, everyone. Oh, no! Is she all right? Violet, are you okay? Nothing to see here. Yeah, more napkins would be good. I'm fine, I'm fine. It happens all the time here. Mops it right up. Normally, she doesn't ever drip like this. Would you like water, sir? Yes. Yes, I would. This is my daughter who you must know, right? God. Stop. Hello. Violet. Hello, Violet. Hey, Vi, say hi to Don't push it, Dad. I'm Dash, her little brother. Hello. Mmm. This is really good water. It's very refreshing. Spring water, is it? I don't know, sir. I think it's tap. Well, it is very good. Excellent tap. Excuse me. Well, nice to meet you. Where'd she go? Mmm. To find a good place to be angry? Tonight, we go now to a special remote interview with Elasti Girl. How you feeling, Chad? You doing all right? I'm fine. The doctors checked me out. I have no memory of the event. I gotta tell you, it's pretty strange to see a recording of yourself the night before and have no recollection. I don't think anyone needs to worry. We've taken many precautions tonight though. Where are you right now? On a case, in a secure undisclosed location. I wanna talk about you starting with your save of a runaway train. Here's an exclusive unedited clip from your own suit cam. Roll the clip. This thing's really moving. 100 and climbing. How much track is built? About 25 miles. The Screenslaver interrupts this program for an important announcement. I'll be damned. She knew. Let's see if your gadget works. Don't bother watching the rest. Gotcha! Elasti Girl doesn't save the day. She only postpones her defeat. And while she postpones her defeat you eat chips and watch her confront problems that you are too lazy to deal with. Superheroes are part of your brainless desire to replace true experience with simulation. You don't talk, you watch talk shows. You don't play games, you watch game shows. Travel, relationships, risk every meaningful experience must be packaged and delivered to you to watch at a distance. So that you can remain ever sheltered ever passive ever ravenous consumers who can't bring themselves to rise from their couches break a sweat and participate in life. You want superheroes to protect you and make yourselves ever more powerless in the process. While you tell yourselves you're being looked after. That your interests are being served. And your rights are being upheld. So that the system can keep stealing from you smiling at you all the while. Go ahead, send your Supers to stop me. Grab your snacks, watch your screens, and see what happens. You are no longer in control. I am. Find anything? Sorry! What happened? What happened is you destroyed my evidence. What's going on? What did I do? What did you guys do to me? That's right, punk. Blame the system. Your tracker worked like a charm, Evelyn. You're a genius. Aw, shucks! I'm just the genius behind the genius. Hey, Dad. We're doing fractions and denismals and percentages and I don't get 'em. Aren't you Didn't we get all caught up? Yeah, we were caught up and now we're doing fractions and percentages and demicels. Decimals. the addition of the Incredibile, the super car once driven by superhero, Mr. Incredible. It's the kind of thing you buy when you have everything else. They said it was beyond repair. Hey, it was in perfect condition. You used to drive that? They said it was destroyed. Long thought lost or destroyed, the famous car turned up at private auction. They said it was That's my car! Stupid water feature! This car is just loaded with amazing gadgets. Care to demonstrate? I'd love to, but we haven't figured out how to make them work yet. Wow! It works? Huh? What are you doing? This is not a toy! That's a rocket launcher! Sweet! Which one launches the rocket? Hey! This is not your car! It's not your car, either! It is so! It's the Incredibile. Why's that guy have it? He shouldn't! Launch the rockets! Launch the rockets! Launch the rockets! I'm not launching anything! Launch the rockets! Do you think I want an angry I wanna blow it up! Rich guy coming after me right now when I'm trying not to I'm not sure what's happened here, Mark. ..distract But everyone here has scattered ..your and I'm afraid I'll need to move ..mother. At any minute. Rich guy got my car. So, you're not gonna steal your car back from the rich guy? What the heck is that? JackJack has powers? Well, yeah, but You knew about this? Yeah. Why didn't you tell us? I don't know. We're your kids. We need to know these things. Did you tell Mom? No. Your mother Why not? You'd want us to tell you, wouldn't you? Is not talking Why would you not tell Mom? Because I didn't wanna What? Come on, man. Because it's not the time. Why? Because So uncool! Because I'm formulating, okay? I'm taking in information, I'm processing! I'm doing the math, I'm fixing the boyfriend and keeping the baby from turning into a flaming monster! How do I do it? By rolling with the punches, baby! I eat thunder and crap lightning, okay? 'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible! Not Mr. SoSo or Mr. Mediocre Guy. Mr. Incredible! We should call Lucius. No. I can handle it. There's no way I'm gonna Dada. I'm calling Lucius. Looks normal to me. When did this start happening? Since Helen got the job. I assume she knows? Are you kidding? I can't tell her about this, not while she's doing hero work! Mama! Girls, come on. Leave the saving the world to the men? I don't think so. Mama! I've got to succeed! So she can succeed. So we can succeed! I get it, Bob! I get it. When was the last time you slept? Who keeps track of that? Besides, he's a baby. I can handle it, I got this handled. So, you good then? You got everything under control? Right? What the? Cookie! Cha Cha want a cookie? Numnum cookie? Cha Cha wanna numnum? Numnum cookie! Cookie! You're not Cookie! Oh, my God! Cookie! Dada! Dada. Dada. Whoa. Okay! Okay. So, he can still hear you from the From the other dimension, yeah. That is freaky. I mean, that's not like Not like our other kids. No, it is not. Full powers, totally random. So now, he's what? Is he good? Yeah, you'd think so, right? Obviously, I can't keep giving him cookies! Uhuh? But if I stop Ahhh! He is freaking! Again, he is freaking! No biting the daddy! What the? No biting! Okay. I think I just need a little bit of me time. Then I'll be good to go. Oh, you need more than me time, Bob. You need major life realignment on a number of levels. Starting with baby superfreak here! You need some solid outside the box thinking. Galbaki? Elasti Girl's supersuit is by Galbaki? Explain yourself! Oh, my God. You're worse than I thought. It's the baby. I brought the baby. Oh, highly unusual. You look ghastly, Robert. I haven't been sleeping. I broke my daughter, they keep changing math we needed doubleA batteries, but I got tripleA's and now we still need doubleA batteries. I put one red thing in a load of whites and now everything's pink. And I think we need eggs. Done properly, parenting is a heroic act. Done properly. I am fortunate that it has never afflicted me. But you do not come to me for eggs and batteries, Robert. I design herowear and Elasti Girl must have a new suit. Actually, it's JackJack. You also wish a new suit for the baby? I would hardly classify this as an emergency. Well, he's a special case. Worth studying. If I could just leave him with you for a while Leave him? Here? I am not a baby person, Robert. I have no baby facilities. I am an artist. I do not involve myself in the prosaic daytoday to day. Fascinating! AAAre you seeing this, Robert? Dada. Oh, my God. Yes! Of course you can leave the baby overnight. I'm sure filling in for Helen is challenging, and you are very tired and the other children need you and miss you, and you must go to them. Auntie Edna will take care of everything so, drive safely and goodbye. I enjoy our visits. ""Auntie Edna""? Attention. Attention. I wanna thank everyone that came out tonight in support of superheroes and bringing them back into society! You all made it happen. The need for this has been made crystal clear in recent days with bad actors like the self proclaimed Screenslaver threatening our peace. His reign was short, huh? And thanks to this woman a great super. You love her. You missed her. Welcome back, Elasti Girl. Come on up here. Don't be bashful. Come on. Get up here. I want you to have this. A memento. Thanks, Winston, Evelyn, and everyone at DEVTECH. I am forever in your debt. And thanks to all of you, your pressure changed all the right minds. We've made amazing headway in a very short time which leads me to an important announcement. Just now, at a worldwide summit leaders from more than a hundred of the world's top countries have agreed to make superheroes legal again! We'll gather superheroes and leaders from all over the planet on our boat, the Everjust for a televised signing ceremony at sea. Now if you'll excuse us, we got a ship to catch! So good to see you. Thanks for coming out. Hey. Hi, it's me, again. Um, there's, uh, something I've always wanted to ask you. Yeah, how do you balance the superhero stuff with the life stuff? I know I can handle the superhero stuff. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Oh. Would you please excuse me a moment? Oh. Yeah, okay, see you later! Good talk! Hey, Vi. Hey. Where's JackJack? E's taking him for a little bit. Edna is babysitting? Yeah. And you're okay with this? Yeah. I don't know why, but yeah. I wanted to say something to you. Sorry about Tony. I didn't think about Dicker erasing his memory or about you having to pay the price for a choice you never made. It's not fair, I know. And then, I made it worse at the restaurant by trying to Anyway. Anyway I'm sorry. I'm used to knowing what the right thing to do is but now, I'm not sure anymore. I just wanna be a good dad. You're not good. You're super. Are superheroes allowed to drink on duty? I'm definitely not on duty. Ignore the costume. I know I should be up there but I had to step away from the grip and grins, you know? Gotta get away to keep it pure. I know I do. What are you getting away from? Eh, you know, company stuff. My brother, mostly. But you love him, you two are this company. Yin and yang. Yeah, I invent the stuff, he's good at people. Pleasing them, engaging them, figuring out what they want. I never know what people want. What do you think they want? Ease. People will trade quality for ease every time. It may be crap, but hey, it's convenient. Yeah. Kind of like this case. What? The Screenslaver? Yeah, something's not sitting right. It was too easy. That was too easy? Wow. Funny. What? Look at that. One of Screenslaver's monitors is tuned into my suit cam. What? Isn't the suit cam closed circuit? It is. Then how come Screenslaver has it? Maybe he hacked it? So, he's sophisticated enough to do that but he has simple locks on his doors? Maybe he wanted you to find him. He wanted to get caught? He wanted you to win. That makes no sense. He's a brilliant guy. If he's smart enough to conceive of technology like this he's smart enough to think of something to do with it. The guy we put in jail delivered pizzas. So? Einstein was a patent clerk. Look, you won. You got the guy who Wait. All Screenslaver needs to do to hypnotize someone is get a screen in front of their eyes. But what if the screen doesn't look like a screen? What if the pizza guy is really a pizza guy but he was controlled by the screens built into his glasses You are good. Look, the robot! It's taking off. I'm not getting a reading yet. Press ""fire""? Now! More power. Oh, I hope this works, Dad. I thought it was best to just let you sleep. Seventeen hours. How do you feel? Super. You got it, Dad. Hurray! I can't tell you how much I appreciate you watching JackJack for me, E. Yes, I'm sure your gratitude is quite inexpressible. Don't ask me to do it again, darling. My rates are far too high. Oh, uh I am joking, Robert. I enjoyed the assignment. He is bright and I am stimulating. We deserve each other. Your child is a polymorph. Like all babies, he has enormous potential. It is not unknown for supers to have more than one power when young but this little one has many. Yes, you have many powers. I understand your lack of sleep and coherency, Robert. Babies can be anything, and your child is no exception. He has pure, unlimited potential, Robert. He slept while I worked in a creative fever. Auntie Edna stayed up all night making sure you look fabulous in your many forms. What are you You're putting him in the In the chamber, Robert. He is part of the demonstration and will be fine. Your challenge is to manage a baby who has multiple powers and no control over them, yes? Huh. That sums it up. I often work to music and I noticed the baby responds to it as well. Specifically, Mozart. I blended Kevlar with carbyne for durability under duress and cotton for comfort. Interwoven with these fabrics are a mesh of tiny sensors that monitor the baby's physical properties. Oh, Lord! What What is he doing? What is he doing? Well, it's Mozart, Robert. Can you blame him? The important thing is that the suit and tracker anticipated the change and alerted you. Oh, no. Cookies. I gotta get cookies! You do not need cookies. As I learned quite painfully last night any solution involving cookies will inevitably result in the demon baby. ""Combustion imminent""? What does that mean? It means fire, Robert, for which the suit has countermeasures. I suggest you extinguish the baby's flames before he trips the sprinkler system. The flame retardant is blackberry lavender, darling. Effective, edible, and delicious. Well, what do you know? That is useful. Although, I have doubtlessly exceeded your expectations for a single night's work the suit and device contain a few more features we need to discuss. Thanks again, E, for everything. How much do I owe you for Pishposh, darling. Your bill will be covered by my fee for being Mr. Incredible, Elasti Girl, and Frozone's exclusive designer throughout the known universe and until the end of time. But babysitting this one I do for free, darling. I would resist the temptation to stretch. The temperature around you is well below freezing. Try to stretch and you'll break. So, you're the Screenslaver. Yes and no. Let's say, I created the character and prerecorded the messages. Does Winston know? That I'm the Screenslaver? Of course not. Can you imagine what Mr. Free Enterprise would do with my hypnosis technology? Worse than what you're doing? Hey, I'm using the technology to destroy people's trust in it. Like I'm using superheroes. Who did I put in jail? Pizza delivery guy. Seemed the right height, build. He gave you a pretty good fight. I should say I gave you a pretty good fight through him. But it doesn't bother you that an innocent man is in jail? Eh, he was surly and the pizza was cold. I counted on you. That's why you failed. What? Why would you count on me? Because I built you a bike? Because my brother knows the words to your theme song? We don't know each other. But you can count on me anyway. I am supposed to, aren't I? Because you have some strange abilities and a shiny costume the rest of us are supposed to put our lives into your gloved hands. That's what my father believed. When our home was broken into, my mother wanted to hide. Begged my father to use the safe room. But Father insisted they call his superhero friends. He died, pointlessly, stupidly waiting for heroes to save the day. But why would you Your brother Is a child! He remembers the time when we had parents and superheroes. So, like a child, Winston conflates the two. Mommy and Daddy went away because supers went away. Our sweet parents were fools to put their lives in anybody else's hands. Superheroes keep us weak. Are you gonna kill me? Nah. Using you is better. You're gonna help me make supers illegal forever. Dada. Dada. Ready? Laser eyes. Stop. Wow! Yeah! Yay, JackJack! Yeah, baby! And that's not all. Watch this. JackJack, blaster ready? No way. That is crazy cool. My turn. I get to blast him first! Let me try. I want him. Give him to me. Hey, I'm just demonstrating. No firing the baby around the house, you understand? This is potentially dangerous and we're trying to teach him to control his powers, okay? Stop. See the screen. He vanished! That's really cool! Okay, good. Use the thing. See that. That's the current readout. Click it. See the readout? Dimension four. See the shape? That's the room. See where he is in relation? So, where is he? He's there! Okay. Come out. Numnum cookie? Yay, JackJack! Yeah, JackJack! That's really cool. Hello? Elasti Girl's in trouble. What? What happened to her? Sorry to tell you on the phone. Meet me on our ship at DEVTECH. The ship at DEVTECH. I'll be there in 15 minutes. What's at the ship at DEVTECH? Lucius? Bob. Helen's in trouble. I need someone to watch the kids. Suit up. It might get weird. I'll be there. ASAP. Fifteen tops. W here are you going ASAP? You better be back ASAP! And leaving that suit. I gotta go. I'll be home soon. Lucius will be here sooner. No firing the baby around the house, okay? What's at the ship at DEVTECH? And why are you in your Supersuit? Is that Mom's supersuit? She may need it. You never know. What's going on? I don't know, but Dad called Lucius after getting a call about Mom and then left. I thought you renounced superheroes. Yeah, well, I renounce my renunciation. Put that on. Hello there, little fella. Hello. You kids aren't safe. The Deavors sent us to take you Well, isn't that redundant? The Deavors just sent me here to guard the house. 'Cause the kids aren't safe. I get it, managerial screw up. Tell Winston I handled it. You understand, Ms Voyd. Ms. Voyd. Drive safely. The thing is, he wants us to bring you, too. Hey. That isn't gonna hold them long. Dash, grab the baby! Spread out! Whoa! Oh! Dash! We gotta get to my car. What? What's going on? Little fella! It worked! Incredibile, windows down! Dive in! Incredibile, set voice identification. Loudly, say your names. Violet Parr. Dashiell Robert Parr. Lucius! Incredibile, escape! Fill me in! Good news and bad news. We found her. She seems physically fine but she's had an encounter with Screenslaver and she's acting kind of strange. In here. Strange how? Helen? Helen, what are you Helen, it's me. Incredibile, pull over. We can't go to E's. You saw those goggles they put on Lucius. They were wearing them, too. They're all under someone's control. They've probably done the same to Mom. Okay. Bad guys after us. No Mom, no Dad. No Lucius. But we have our powers, this car and what? Incredibile, take us to DEVTECH. The kids have escaped in a tricked out car, but we got Frozone. Bring him to the ship at DEVTECH immediately. Aw, we missed 'em! Oh, I wish the Incredibile could follow that boat. What did you do? I don't know. What did you do? I didn't do anything! Wow, this car does anything I say. We didn't plan this well. What do you mean? We're here, aren't we? Yes, we're here. We need to be up there. Hey What if the Incredibile has ejector seats? Wait, what? No. Yeah, baby! No, don't say any more Max power! Launch! Come on. Hello! Glad you could come. Welcome to the conference. Good to see you. Our stars, where are they? The event's about to start. They didn't want to upstage the others. They'll join for the signing. Welcome, guests! You're in for a treat. This ship is the largest hydrofoil on the planet. So, hold onto something because we're going to open her up! We need to find Mom and Dad. Stay here. I'm gonna search for them. Wait! Who's gonna watch JackJack? Suck it up. I won't be long. Wait. Wait, but, but wait! This is important. They are in trouble. It's up to us. To us, understand? Keep him amused but quiet! Ugh. Shh! Quiet! Huh? JackJack? JackJack? JackJack! JackJack! The mesmerized supers know we're here but I found Mom and Dad Where's JackJack? You lost him? I gave you one thing to do! The tracker. Use the tracker. He's going up? He's in an elevator. Let's go! Hey, little baby. Where are your parents? And here they are, folks! The supers who started this whole thing. I told you they'd be there in time. Hey, did you make them new masks? Yeah. Night vision, et cetera They look good, right? So simple, even he can do it. And we're back live in three, two, one This is a momentous occasion. We've all managed to accomplish something extraordinarily rare in today's world. We agree on something. We agree to undo a bad decision. To make sure a few extraordinarily gifted members of the world's many countries are treated fairly. To invite them once again to use their gifts to benefit the world. I thank all of you for representing your nation's commitment to superheroes. With special thanks to Ambassador Selick. Yeah, it's okay. Let her hear you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Ambassador, for your early and very crucial support. I can't think of anyone more deserving than you to be the first signature on the International Superhero Accord. There it is! Holy cow! I know he's on fire. Just put him out. They're coming. Is it okay to give him that? I wasn't hearing any better ideas. No! Come on, JackJack. We have to go. Cookie numnum? Mama, Mama. I see him. He's getting away! Stand back. Darn it! He's heading for Mom. It is done. The world is super again. Group photo. Come on. Group photo, everyone. Squeeze in. That's it. Historic occasion. Everyone, smile. Go on phase two. Years of mandated hiding and silence have made us bitter. You bring us out into the light only to clean up the messes your lack of discipline creates. Your bodies and your character are weak. Your promises are empty, and you will pay for it. We no longer serve you. We serve only us. May the fittest survive. Well, we, um Some very alarming moments there before the, uh, technical difficulties. Please bear with us. What? Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Hold! Let him talk. Superheroes have forcibly taken the bridge. Repeat. Now. A little further. Little further. Stop. What the A baby? Mom and Dad. Uncle Lucius? My mama. JackJack, no! A super baby? No, no, no! Put him down! Grab her! No! Hold JackJack. No! Hey, it's me! Yeah, that's what I thought last time. Kids, what are you Wha You came for us? Don't be mad. Oh, sweetie, how could I be mad? I'm proud. Not to break up a tender moment, but where are we? Is this DEVTECH's ship? Evelyn Deavor controls the Screenslaver and until a second ago, us. Where's the crew? Collision detected. Correct course. Uhoh. Did I do that? Mom, the suit? Try this. Phase Three. Go on Phase Three! Why are the kids here? You didn't go to the house? I went to the house. You didn't escape? How did you not escape? Hey! We just saved you! Escape? Escape from who? Those guys! What the? JackJack has powers? We know. Fight now, talk later. JackJack. Laser eyes! Ahha! Ugh. Come with me, Winston. Did I faint? You'll be safe here. Safe? Safe from what? Where are the diplomats? The supers? Still hypnotized. What have you done? Evelyn, she's escaping. Well, go after her. Finish your mission. I can't just go! What about the kids? JackJack, who's gonna Mom! Go. We've got this. Voyd, come with me. I'll go shut down the engine. I'll try to slow the ship from the bow. Wait, someone's missing. Where's the crusher guy? Strap in now! It's for your own good. No! This is. We're too late. Get me up to the jet. Hey, you did this. Can you undo it? You want me to uncrush? What? No one's ever asked for that? No. To uncrush is silly. Why uncrush? To get into the engine room. Oh, forget it. We don't have enough time. What if I said to unpunch someone? What do you do? Welcome aboard, Elasti Girl. Although we haven't yet reached our cruising altitude feel free to roam about the cabin. Or just relax and let the cabin roam about you. I can't get to the engine room! We gotta do something! Because trying to slow it down ain't working. Hey! What about turning the boat? The steering's been destroyed! Dash means from the outside! Yeah! If we break off one of the foils and turn the rudder we can veer the ship away from the city! That might work. I'll turn the front, you turn the rear. Using the rudder? That's underwater. How am I supposed to get All right. Come on, kids. Dad, I know this is going to work. But if it doesn't, and we crash my shields are probably better protection than the ship. I should stay here. With JackJack. That's my girl. Remember, Bob, we're both turning right! You know what's sad? If it weren't for your core beliefs I think we could have been good friends. At least I have core beliefs. We have breaking news While there is still no radio contact, the ship has changed direction and is heading towards land at a high rate of speed. So, Dash I am going to the rudder. Once I turn the ship, you hit the pull up button. Okay, Dad. Now lower me down The reputations of superheroes are ruined. You will never become legal. Ever. Never? No. Ever? No. Not even a little smidgee widgee? Oh, hypoxia. When you don't have enough oxygen, things seem really silly. Things get sillier and sillier and then you die. I don't wanna die. Ah, nobody does. Really. Not such a bad way to go. Everyone, we need to get to the back of the ship. All supers, protect your ambassadors! Follow. Dad's been underwater for too long. We gotta pull him up. Wait. It's too soon. I'm gonna press the button! Not yet! It's turning. It's working. Now! Dash, now! Save yourself. Make a chute. Make a chute. Make a chute. Make a chute! Helen! Brace yourselves! Crash positions! Whoo. I missed JackJack's first power? Actually, you missed the first 17. Oh! The fact that you saved me doesn't make you right. But it does make you alive. And I'm grateful for that. I'm sorry, but she'll go to prison. Well, I'm sorry she's rich and will probably get no more than a slap on the wrist. First of all, Violet, I like you. And who knows what the future may bring but I have a good feeling about all of you. Hmm. Good feeling. Should we be worried? You guys got the next shift. I'm beat. Oh! I saw what you did back there. That was incredible! No pun intended. Sorry I had to punch you. Yeah, baby! My sweet ride! And in recognition of the extraordinary service they have demonstrated the legal status of superheroes is hereby restored. You don't know me, do you? No, I don't Wait. Are you the girl with the water? I'm Violet Parr. I'm Tony. Okay. You split up into separate groups and stuff Tony, this is my mom. Pleased to meet you. This is my dad. Oh, we've met. And this is embarrassing. Charmed, I'm sure. My little brother, Dash. And the baby is JackJack. I tried to limit it to one parent. We're all going to a movie, too, Tony. Don't mind us. We'll be sitting on the other side of the theater. Not watching you. He's kidding. They are only dropping us off at the theater. They have other things to do. So, you guys are close, I guess. Yeah, I guess. We can get closer. Bob. Stop! Let us out! Here, large popcorn, small soda. Save me a seat, center, about eight rows back. I'll be back before the previews are over.

Inside Out,Disney,2010,2015,Animation,"Do you ever look at someone and wonder... ""What is going on inside their head?"" Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head. And there she was... Hello. Riley. Look at you. Aren't you a little bundle of joy? Aren't you a little bundle of joy? It was amazing. Just Riley and me. Forever. For 33 seconds. I'm Sadness. Hello. I... I'm Joy. So... Can I just... If you could... I just want to fix that. Thanks. And that was just the beginning. Headquarters only got more crowded from there. Very nice. Okay, looks like you got this. Very good. Sharp turn! No! Look out! No! That's Fear. He's really good at keeping Riley safe. Easy, easy. We're good. We're good. Good job. Thank you. Thank you very much. And we're back! Here we go. All right, open. This looks new. You think it's safe? What is it? Okay, caution. There is a dangerous smell, people. Hold on. What is that? This is Disgust. She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned. Physically and socially That is not brightly colored or shaped like a dinosaur. Hold on, guys. It's broccoli! Yucky! Well, I just saved our lives. Yeah. You're welcome. Riley, if you don't eat your dinner, you're not gonna get any dessert. Wait. Did he just say we couldn't have dessert? That's Anger. He cares very deeply about things being fair. So that's how you want to play it, old man? No dessert? Sure, we'll eat our dinner! Right after you eat this! Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane! Airplane. We got an airplane, everybody. Airplane. And you've met Sadness. She... Well, she... I'm not actually sure what she does. And I've checked, there's no place for her to go, so... She's good, we're good. It's all great! Anyway, these are Riley's memories and they're mostly happy, you'll notice. Not to brag. But the really important ones are over here. I don't want to get too technical, but these are called Core Memories. Each one came from a super important time in Riley's life. Like when she first scored a goal. That was so amazing! Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice! We got a future center here! Nice job. And each Core Memory powers a different aspect of Riley's personality. Like Hockey Island. Goofball Island is my personal favorite. Come back here, you little monkey! You're silly. Yep, Goofball is the best. Friendship Island is pretty good too. I love Honesty Island. And that's the truth! And of course, Family Island is amazing. The point is, the Islands of Personality are what make Riley... Riley! Look out, mermaid! Lava! Who's your friend who likes to play? Bing Bong, Bing Bong! Hey! Very nice! Where'd you learn that? Brain freeze! Yeah! Good night, kiddo. Good night, Dad. And... we're out! That's what I'm talking about! Another perfect day! Nice job, everybody! Let's get those memories down to Long Term. All right, we did not die today! I call that an unqualified success. And that's it. We love our girl. She's got great friends and a great house. Things couldn't be better. After all, Riley's 11 now. What could happen? What... Okay, not what I had in mind. Hey, look! The Golden Gate Bridge! Isn't that great? It's not made out of solid gold like we thought, which is kind of a disappointment, but still... I sure am glad you told me earthquakes are a myth, Joy. Otherwise I'd be terrified right now! Yeah... Are you kidding? Get out of the street! For Pete's sake! Move it! These are my kind of people. All right, just a few more blocks. We're almost to our new house! Step on it, Daddy! Why don't we just live in this smelly car? We've already been in it forever. Which, actually, was really lucky, because that gave us plenty of time to think about what our new house is going to look like! What! Let's review the top five daydreams. That looks safe! That one's nice. This will be great for Riley! No, no, no, no, this one! Joy, for the last time, she cannot live in a cookie. That's the one! It comes with a dragon. Now we're getting close, I can feel it. Here it is, here's our new house. And... Maybe it's nice on the inside. We're supposed to live here? Do we have to? I'm telling you, it smells like something died in here. Can you die from moving? Guys, you're overreacting. Nobody is dying... A dead mouse! Great. This is just great. I'm gonna be sick. It's the house of the dead! We're going to get rabies! Get off of me! Hey. All through the drive, Dad talked about how cool our new room is. Let's go check it out! Let's go! It's gonna be great! Yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no. I'm starting to envy the dead mouse. Get out the rubber ball, we're in solitary confinement. Riley can't live here. She's right. It's the worst. Really bad. It's absolutely the worst. It's the worst place I've ever been in my entire life. Hey, it's nothing our butterfly curtains couldn't fix. I read somewhere that an empty room is an opportunity. Where did you read that? It doesn't matter. I read it and it's great. We'll put the bed there. And the desk over there. The hockey lamp goes there. Put the chair there. The trophy collection goes there. Stars! I like that! Now we're talking! Let's go get our stuff from the moving van! All right. Goodbye. Well, guess what? The moving van won't be here until Thursday. You're kidding. The van is lost? It is the worst day ever! That figures. The van is lost. You said it would be here yesterday! I know that's what I said. That's what they told me! Mom and Dad are stressed out! They're stressed out? What are we going to do? I've got a great idea! Did you even read the contract? Andersen makes her move. She's closing in! Hey! No, you're not! She's lining up for the shot! Coming behind you. Watch out! Watch out! She shoots and she scores! Yeah! Come on, Grandma! ""Grandma""? She put her hair up, we're in for it! Hey, put me down! Sorry. Hold on. Hold on. Hello? Wait. Wh... You're kidding. All right. Stall for me. I'll be right there. The investor's supposed to show up on Thursday, not today! I got to go. It's okay. We get it. You're the best. Thanks, hon. See you, sweetie. Dad just left us. He doesn't love us anymore. That's sad. I should drive, right? Joy? What are you doing? Just give me one second. You know what I've realized? Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember? Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street. Maybe we could try that? Pizza sounds delicious. Pizza? That's good. Yes! Pizza! What the heck is that? Who puts broccoli on pizza? That's it. I'm done. Congratulations, San Francisco, you've ruined pizza! First the Hawaiians and now you! What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza? Must be a San Francisco thing, huh? Still, it's not as bad as that soup. At that diner in Nebraska. Yeah. The spoon stood up in the soup by itself! That was disgusting. Good. Family is running. Dad's got a steel stomach. The drive out was pretty fun, huh? What was your favorite part? Spitting out the car window! Definitely not when Dad was singing. Wearing a seat belt! What about the time with the dinosaur? That's the one. Definitely! Say cheese! Dad! Dad! Honey! Now hold still. The car! Stop! No, no, no! Nice one, Joy. I liked that time at the dinosaur. That was pretty funny. Wait. What? What happened? She did something to the memory. What did you do? I just touched it. That shouldn't make it change. Change it back, Joy! I'm trying. You can't change it back? No! I guess I can't! Good going, Sadness. Now when Riley thinks of that moment with Dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo. I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know... I thought maybe if you... Joy, we've got a stairway coming up. Just don't touch any other memories until we figure out what's going on. Okay. All right. Get ready. This is a monster railing and we are riding it all the way down! Wait, what? What happened? A Core Memory! No! Sadness, what are you doing? It looked like one was crooked so I opened it and then it fell out. I... It's just that... I wanted to maybe hold one. Joy! Whoa, whoa. Sadness, you nearly touched a Core Memory. And when you touch them, we can't change them back. I know. I'm sorry. Something's wrong with me. It's like I'm having a breakdown. You're not having a breakdown. It's stress. I keep making mistakes like that. I'm awful. No, you're not. And annoying. You know what? You can't focus on what's going wrong. There's always a way to turn things around, to find the fun. Yeah. Find the fun. I don't know how to do that. Okay. Well, try to think of something funny. Remember the funny movie where the dog dies? Yeah, that's not... What about that time with Meg when Riley laughed so hard milk came out of her nose? Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire. It was awful. Okay, okay, don't think of that. Let's try something else. What are your favorite things to do? My favorite? Well, I like it when we're outside. That's good. Like there's the beach and sunshine. Like that time we buried Dad in the sand up to his neck. I was thinking more like rain. Rain? Rain is my favorite, too! We can stomp around in puddles. You know, there's cool umbrellas, lightning storms. More like when the rain runs down our back and makes our shoes soggy. And we get all cold, shivery, and everything just starts feeling droopy. Hey, hey. Hey, easy. Why are you crying? It's just like really the opposite of what we're going for here. Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems. You know what? Let's, think about something else. How about we read some mind manuals, huh? Sounds fun. I've read most of them. Well, have you read this one? This seems interesting. ""Long Term Memory Retrieval, Volume 47""? No. A real pageturner! ""Long Term Memory data selection via channel subgrouping""? See? Fun already! You lucky dog. You're reading these cool things. I got to go work. Life is so unfair. What can we do? We've only got capital to last a month, maybe two. If we can't find investors by then, we're going to have to lay people off. Mom! Dad! Come kiss me good night! I know. I know. Be right there! We've got to land this, okay? Did you hear Dad? He sounded really upset. What was that? Was it a bear? It's a bear! There are no bears in San Francisco. I saw a really hairy guy. He looked like a bear. I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot. I don't want to hear about your nerves. I'll tell you what it is. This move has been a bust. That's what I've been telling you guys! There are at least 37 things for Riley to be scared of right now. The smell alone is enough to make her gag. I can't believe Mom and Dad moved us here! Look, I get it. You guys have concerns. But we've been through worse! Tell you what, let's make a list of all the things Riley should be happy about. Fine. Let's see, this house stinks, our room stinks. Pizza is weird here. Our friends are back home. And all of our stuff is in the missing van! Come on. It could be worse. Yeah, Joy. We could be lying on the dirty floor. In a bag. Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start. But think of all the good things that... No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now. Let us handle this. I say we skip school tomorrow and lock ourselves in the bedroom. We have no clean clothes. I mean, no one should see us. Yeah, we could cry until we can't breathe. We should lock the door and scream that curse word we know. It's a good one! Now hold on! Look, we all have our off days. You know... Hi, honey. The Mom bad news train is pulling in. Toottoot! Still no moving van. Now they're saying it won't be here till Tuesday, can you believe it? Toottoottoot! Where's Dad? On the phone. This new venture is keeping him pretty busy. I rest my case! Your dad's a little stressed, you know, about getting his new company up and running. Now for a few wellplaced withering scowls. I guess all I really want to say is, thank you. You know, through all this confusion you've stayed... Well, you've stayed our happy girl. Your dad's under a lot of pressure, but if you and I can keep smiling, it would be a big help. We can do that for him. Right? Well. Yeah, sure. What did we do to deserve you? Sweet dreams. Good night. Well, you can't argue with Mom. Happy it is. Team Happy! Sounds great! Totally behind you, Joy. Looks like we're going into REM. I got Dream Duty, so I'll take care of sending these to Long Term. Great day today, guys! Sleep well, Team Happy! All right, what's on tonight, Dream Production? Well, this is it. The new place. Come live with me, Riley. Somebody order a broccoli pizza? Eat me! I'm organic! No! Who is in charge of programing down there? I know I'm not supposed to do this, but... We are not going to end the day like this. Don't you worry. I'm gonna make sure that tomorrow is another great day. I promise. Hello! Did I wake you? Do you have to play that? Well, I have to practice. And I don't think of it as playing so much as hugging. Okay, first day of school! Very, very exciting. I was up late last night figuring out a new plan. Here it is! Fear. I need a list of all the possible negative outcomes on the first day at a new school. Way ahead of you there. Does anyone know how to spell ""meteor""? Disgust. Make sure Riley stands out today. But also blends in. When I'm through, Riley will look so good, the other kids will look at their own outfits and barf. ""Joy."" ""Yes, Joy?"" ""You'll be in charge of the console, keeping Riley happy all day long. ""And may I add I love your dress? It's adorable."" ""This old thing? Thank you so much. I love the way it twirls."" Train of Thought! Right on schedule. Anger. Unload the daydreams. I ordered extra in case things get slow in class. It might come in handy. If this new school is full of boring, useless classes. Which it probably will be. Sadness. I have a super important job just for you. Really? Follow me. What are you doing? And there. Perfect! This is the circle of Sadness. Your job is to make sure that all the Sadness stays inside of it. So you want me to just stand here? Hey, it's not my place to tell you how to do your job. Just make sure that all the Sadness stays in the circle! See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun? No. Atta girl. All right, everyone, fresh start. We are gonna have a good day, which will turn into a good week, which will turn into a good year, which turns into a good life! So, the big day! New school, new friends, huh? I know! I'm kind of nervous, but I'm mostly excited. How do I look? Do you like my shirt? Very cute! Are you gonna be okay? You want us to walk with you? Mom and Dad? With us in public? No thank you. I'm on it! Nope! I'm fine. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Have a good day at school, monkey. Have a great day, sweetheart! That's crazy. It really is. That was so funny. Do you know what basketball game is coming up? Are you sure we want to do this? In we go! Okay! Going in! Yes! Did you see her? Hello! Okay, we've got a group of cool girls at two o'clock. How do you know? Double ears pierced, infinity scarf. Is she wearing eye shadow? Yeah, we want to be friends with them. Let's go talk to them! Are you kidding? We're not talking to them. We want them to like us. Yeah. Wait, what? Almost finished with the potential disasters. Worst scenario is either quicksand, spontaneous combustion, or getting called on by the teacher. So as long as none of those happen... Okay, everybody. We have a new student in class today. Are you kidding me? Out of the gate? This is not happening! Riley, would you like to tell us something about yourself? No! Pretend we can't speak English. Don't worry. I got this. Okay. My name is Riley Andersen. I'm from Minnesota and now I live here. And how about Minnesota? Can you tell us something about it? Well, you certainly get a lot more snow than we do. She's hilarious! Yeah, it gets pretty cold. The lake freezes over, and that's when we play hockey. I'm on a great team. We're called the Prairie Dogs. My friend Meg plays forward. And my dad's the coach. Pretty much everyone in my family skates. It's kind of a family tradition. We go out on the lake almost every weekend. Or we did, till I moved away. Hey, what gives? Wait, what? Hey, Sadness! You touched a memory? We talked about this. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Get back in your circle. What's going on? Why won't it eject? Get it out of there, Joy. We used to play tag and stuff. Cool kids whispering at three o'clock! Did you see that look? No. They're judging us! Somebody help me! Grab that... Everybody put... But everything's different now. Since we moved. No! We're crying! At school! What? Sadness! What are you doing? Oh, no! I'm sorry! It's a Core Memory! But it's blue. No! Wait! Stop it! No! No! Joy, no. That's a Core Memory! Hey! Joy, wait! Stop it! Let go! The Core Memories! No, no, no, no! Thank you, Riley. I know it can be tough moving to a new place, but we're happy to have you here. All right, everyone, get out your history books and turn to chapter seven. Can I say that curse word now? No! One, two, three. Okay. I got them. Where are we? Long Term Memory? Wait... Goofball Island? Riley's Islands of Personality. They're all down! This is bad. We... We can fix this! We just have to get back to Headquarters, plug the Core Memories in, and Riley will be back to normal. Riley has no Core Memories. No Personality Islands and no... What? What is it? You. You're not in Headquarters. Without you, Riley can't be happy. We got to get you back up there. I'm coming, Riley. So, as it turns out, the green trash can is not recycling, it's for greens. Like compost. And eggshells. And the blue one is recycling. And the black one is trash. Riley is acting so weird. Why is she acting so weird? What do you expect? All the Islands are down. Joy would know what to do. That's it. Until she gets back, we just do what Joy would do! Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust, how are we supposed to be happy? Hey, Riley. I've got good news! I found a junior hockey league right here in San Francisco. And get this: tryouts are tomorrow after school. What luck, right? Hockey? What do we do? Guys, this is... You pretend to be Joy. Won't it be great to be back out on the ice? Yeah, that sounds fantastic. What was that? That wasn't anything like Joy! Because I'm not Joy. Yeah, no kidding. Did you guys pick up on that? Something's wrong. Totally. Should we ask her? Let's probe. But keep it subtle, so she doesn't notice. So, how was the first day of school? She's probing us. I'm done. You pretend to be Joy. What? Okay. It was fine, I guess. I don't know. Very smooth. That was just like Joy. Something is definitely going on. She's never acted like this before. What should we do? We're going to find out what's happening. But we'll need support. Signal the husband. With a nice pass over to Reeves, comes across... and nice! She's looking at us. What did she say? What? Sorry, sir. No one was listening. Is it garbage night? We left the toilet seat up? What? What is it, woman? What? He's making that stupid face again. I could strangle him right now. Signal him again. So, Riley, how was school? You got to be kidding me! Seriously? For this we gave up that Brazilian helicopter pilot? Move! I'll be Joy. School was great, all right? Riley. Is everything okay? Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us. What is her deal? All right, make a show of force. I don't want to have to put ""the foot"" down. No, not the foot! Riley, I do not like this new attitude. I'll show you attitude, old man. No. No, no, no! Stay happy! What is your problem? Just leave me alone! Sir, reporting high levels of sass! Take it to DEFCON Two. You heard that, gentlemen. DEFCON Two. Listen, young lady, I don't know where this disrespectful attitude came from... You want a piece of this, pops? Come and get it! Yeah, well... Well... Here it comes. Prepare the foot! Keys to safety position. Ready to launch on your command, sir! Just shut up! Fire! That's it! Go to your room! Now! The foot is down! The foot is down! Good job, gentlemen. That could have been a disaster. Well, that was a disaster. Come fly with me, gatinha. We're going to walk out there? On that? It's the quickest way back. But it's right over the Memory Dump. If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever. We have to do this for Riley. Just follow my footsteps. Okay. It's not that high. It's totally fine... Hey. So, things got a little out of hand downstairs. Do you want to talk about it? Come on, where's my happy girl? Monkey. He's trying to start up Goofball. Come on! Go back! Run, run, run! What... I get it. You need some alone time. We'll talk later. We have a major problem. Joy, where are you? We lost Goofball Island. That means she can lose Friendship and Hockey and Honesty and Family. You can fix this, right, Joy? I... I don't know. But we have to try. Okay, come on. Riley's gone to sleep. Which is a good thing. When you think about it because nothing else bad can happen while she's asleep. We'll be back to Headquarters before she wakes up. We'll just go across Friendship Island. We'll never make it. No! No, no, no! Don't obsess over the weight of life's problems. Remember the funny movie where the dog dies? Sadness, we don't have time for this. We'll just have to go around. Take the scenic route. Wait, Joy, you could get lost in there! Think positive! Okay. I'm positive you will get lost in there. That's Long Term Memory. An endless warren of corridors and shelves. I read about it in the manuals. The manuals? The manuals! You read the manuals! Yeah. So you know the way back to Headquarters! I guess. You are my map! Let's go! Lead on, my map! Show me where we're going! Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk. Just give me a few... hours. Which way? Left? Right. No. I mean, go left. I said left was right. Like ""correct."" Okay. This actually feels kind of nice. Okay, here we go! We'll be back to Headquarters before morning. We can do it! This will be easy! This is working! This is not working. Are we getting close? Yeah, just another right. And... a left and then another... left and... Are you sure you know where we're going? Because we seem to be walking away from Headquarters. Riley's awake. Don't touch. Remember? If you touch them, they stay sad. Sorry, I won't. Starting now. I can't take much more of this. Forget them! Mind workers! But, Joy, we're almost... Phone numbers. We don't need all these. They're in her phone. Excuse me, hi. Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it! I need to find Friendship Island. Look at this. Four years of piano lessons. Yeah, it looks pretty faded. You know what? Save Chopsticks and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest. Are you... U.S. Presidents. What do you think? Yeah, just keep Washington, Lincoln and the fat one. Forget them! Hey! You can't throw those away! Those are perfectly good memories. The names of every ""Cutie Pie Princess"" doll? Yes! That is critical information! Glitterstorm, Honeypants... Forget them! Hey! Bring those back! They're in the dump. Nothing comes back from the dump. Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay? When Riley doesn't care about a memory, it fades. Fades? Happens to the best of them. Yeah, except for this bad boy. This one will never fade. TripleDent gum Will make you smile The song from the gum commercial? You know, sometimes we send that one up to Headquarters for no reason. It just plays in Riley's head over and over again. Like a million times! Let's watch it again! TripleDent gum Yeah, I know. We all know the song. Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay. Hey, what do you think? Should we do it? Yeah! Okay, here we go! TripleDent gum What the... This again? Wait! Do you know how to get to Friendship Island? TripleDent gum Do you like it there? Did you feel any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool? Yeah, it's good. What happened with the playoffs? We won the first game. Coach says we might actually go to the finals this year. And we've got this new girl on the team. She's so cool. She did not just say that. A new girl? Meg has a new friend already? Hey, hey! Stay happy! We do not want to lose any more islands here, guys! We can pass the puck to each other without even looking. It's like mind reading! You like to read minds, Meg? I got something for you to read, right here! Let's just be calm for one second! I heard they have parrots... I've got to go. What? I got to go! Okay, could you just please tell me which way is... Oh, no! Friendship Island! What? Not Friendship. Riley loved that one. And now it's gone. Goodbye, friendship. Hello, loneliness. We'll just have to go the long way. Yeah. The long, long, long, long way. I'm ready. There's got to be a better way. Look at you! I will take you, but not you. Who am I kidding? I can't leave you. Hello! Wait! Hey! Wait! Wait! Stop! Excuse me. I was looking for... Diversion! What? So long, sucker! I hurt all over. Wait. I know you. No, you don't. I get that a lot. I look like a lot of people. No, no, no. I do. Bing Bong! Riley's imaginary friend! You really do know me? Well, of course! Riley loved playing with you! You two are best friends! You would know. We're trying to get back to Headquarters. Headquarters? You guys are from Headquarters? Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness. You're Joy? The Joy? What the heck are you doing out here? That's a good question. You want to answer that, Sadness? Without you, Riley won't ever be happy. We can't have that. We got to get you back. I'll tell you what. Follow me! Thank you! It is so great to see you again. I gotta tell you, I am such a huge fan of your work. Do you remember when you and Riley were in a band? I went to all of your concerts. Yeah, I blow a mean nose. Watching you play tag was such a treat. Twotime world champ. And remember your rockets? Of course! It runs on song power! That's right! Your theme song! Who's your friend who likes to play? Bing Bong Bing Bong His rocket makes you yell ""Hooray!"" Bing Bong, Bing Bong Bing Bong, Bing Bong What exactly are you supposed to be? You know, it's unclear. I'm mostly cotton candy. But shapewise I'm part cat, part elephant, part dolphin. Dolphin? You got to remember, when Riley was three, animals were all the rage. The cow goes moo. The horse goes neigh. That's all people talked about back then. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true. What are you doing out here? Well, there's not much call for imaginary friends lately. So I, you know... Hey, hey. Don't be sad. Tell you what. When I get back up to Headquarters, I'll make sure Riley remembers you. You will? Of course! She'd love that. This is the greatest day of my life! Are you okay? Hey, what's going on? I cry candy. Try the caramel. It's delicious. Here, use this. Thanks! Hold on, wait a second. It always gets stuck at the bottom. Here. What? It's imaginary. Thanks. This will make it a lot easier to walk back to Headquarters. Walk? We're not walking. We're taking the Train of Thought! The train, of course! That is so much faster! But how do we catch it? Well, it kind of goes all over the place, but there is a station in Imagination Land. I know a shortcut. Come on, this way! I am so glad we ran into you! The station is right through here. After you. Joy. What? I read about this place in the manual. We shouldn't go in there. Bing Bong says it's the quickest way to Headquarters. No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought. What are you talking about? I go in here all the time. It's a shortcut, you see? DANGER. Shortcut. I'll prove it to you. Look at me. I'm closer to the station because I'm taking the shortcut. Let's go around. This way. Almost there! If you want to walk the long way, go for it. But Riley needs to be happy. I'm not missing that train. Bing Bong knows what he's doing. He's part dolphin. They're very smart. Well, I guess. What did you get? I don't know. Okay, what abstract concept are we trying to comprehend today? Loneliness. Looks like there's something in there. I'm going to turn it on for a minute and burn out the gunk. What did I tell you? You'll be at Headquarters in no time. Say, would you look at that? What's happening? Oh, no, they turned it on. Never seen this before. My face! My beautiful face! What is going on? We're abstracting! There are four stages. This is the first: Nonobjective Fragmentation! All right. Do not panic. What is important is that we all stay together. We're in the second stage. We're deconstructing! Run! I can't feel my legs! There they are. Come here, me! We've got to get out of here before we're nothing but shape and color! We'll get stuck here forever! Stuck? Why did we come in here? I told you, it's a shortcut! The train! Oh, no. We're twodimensional! That's stage three! We're getting nowhere! Depth! I'm lacking depth! Come on. We can't fit. Oh, no, we're Nonfigurative. This is the last stage! We're not going to make it! Wait! We're twodimensional. Fall on your face! Stop! Stop! No! I thought you said that was a shortcut. I did, but wow, we should not have gone in there. That was dangerous! They really should put up a sign. How long until the next train? Who knows. But don't worry. There's another station. That way. The train always stops there. Right before it goes to Headquarters. If we hurry, we can catch it. This isn't another one of your shortcuts, is it? Yeah! Is there really another station? Through there. Welcome to Imagination Land! Imagination Land? Sure! I come here all the time. I'm practically the mayor. Hey, you guys hungry? There's French Fry Forest! Delicious. No way! Check it out! Trophy Town! Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner! I won first place! Me too! Participation award. Wait, is that... Sadness, look, it's Cloud Town! That is my favorite! It's so soft! Let me try. Hey! What's the big idea? You better fix that wall, or else you're in big troub... Oh, no! Lava! Imagination Land is the best! Is it all going to be so interactive? Hey, look! The House of Cards! Wait. Hang on just a minute. Your rocket! Yeah. I stashed it in there for safekeeping, and now I'm all set to take Riley to the moon! I'm sorry. Great. I love Imagination Land. Isn't it great? And there's always something new, like... Who the heck is that? Imaginary boyfriend. I would die for Riley. I've never seen him before. I live in Canada. Anyway, this way. Through Preschool World! We're nearly to the train! Riley, here we come! This should be fun! New team, new friends. These kids look pretty good, considering they're from San Francisco. Okay, Andersen, you're up! Got to go. Okay. Good luck, sweetie! Luck isn't going to help us now. If she tries to use Hockey Island, it's going down. Which is why I've recalled every hockey memory I can think of. One of these has got to work in place of the Core Memory. She's about to play! Hurry! We did it, gang! It's working! Line change! Line change! Change it up! No! No! It's like we don't learn anything. Come on! Let's pick it up out there! Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it! That's it! No, no, no! Breathe. Find your happy place. What's her problem? Riley. What's wrong? Let's go. You're not going to finish tryouts? What's the point? Hey. It'll be all right. Let's just go back... Stop saying everything will be all right! Nice hustle, ladies! Hockey? No, no, she loves hockey. She can't give up hockey. Hey! Look at that! Very nice shot! Hey! Bing Bong, we have to get to that station. Sure thing. This way, just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey. That's weird. Graham Cracker Castle used to be right here. I wonder why they moved it? That's not... I would have sworn Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here. Hey, what's going on? Yeah, yeah... I don't know... We'll have to come back. Princess Dream World! Oh, no! The stuffed Animal Hall of Fame! My rocket! Wait! Riley and I, we're still using that rocket! It still has some song power left! Who's your friend who likes to play? No! No, no, no. No, you can't take my rocket to the dump! Riley and I are going to the moon! Riley can't be done with me. Hey, it's going to be okay! We can fix this! We just need to get back to Headquarters. Which way to the train station? I had a whole trip planned for us. Hey, who's ticklish, huh? Here comes the tickle monster! Hey, Bing Bong! Look at this! Here's a fun game! You point to the train station and we all go there! Won't that be fun? Come on, let's go to the train station! I'm sorry they took your rocket. They took something that you loved. It's gone. Forever. Sadness. Don't make him feel worse. Sorry. It's all I had left of Riley. I bet you and Riley had great adventures. They were wonderful. Once we flew back in time. We had breakfast twice that day. Sadness... It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it. She did. We were best friends. Yeah. It's sad. I'm okay now. Come on. The train station is this way. How did you do that? I don't know. He was sad. So I listened to what... Hey! There's the train! We made it! We're finally going to get home! Oh, no! These Facts and Opinions look so similar. Don't worry about it. Happens all the time. On a scale of one to ten, I give this day an F. Well, why don't we quit standing around and do something? Like what, genius? Like quitting. That's what I'm doing. Sure it's the coward's way out. But this coward's gonna survive. Emotions can't quit, genius! I thought we were supposed to be keeping Riley happy. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What is it? Nothing. Just the best idea ever. What? All the good Core Memories were made in Minnesota. Ergo, we go back to Minnesota and make more. Tada! Wait, wait, wait. You're saying we run away? Well, I wouldn't call it that. I'd call it the Happy Core Memory Development program. You can't be serious. Hey! Our life was perfect until Mom and Dad decided to move to San Fran Stinktown. I mean, it's just so drastic! Need I remind you of how great things were there? Our room? Our back yard? Our friends? TripleDent gum Will make you smile Did I ask for the gum commercial? Anyway, it was better, that's my point. Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota. Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we just sleep on this or something? Fine. Let's sleep on it. Because, hey, I'm sure jolly funfilled times are just around the corner. Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving? Riley's gone to sleep. We're all on break. You mean we're stuck here until morning? Yeah, the Train of Thought doesn't run while she's asleep. We can't wait that long. How about we wake her up? Sadness, that's ridiculous! How could we possibly... How about we wake her up? Great idea, Joy. Thanks. Come on! This place is huge! Yeah, it looks so much smaller than I expected. I Can Fly? I love that one! Rainbow Unicorn! She's right there! My friend says you're famous. She wants your autograph. No, no, Sadness, don't bother Miss Unicorn, okay? Sorry, she's from out of town. That was so embarrassing, right? I loved you in Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7. Okay, bye. I love you! Wonder what that means. Well, let's go in. Set up the classroom set! Today's memories are in! We've got a lot to work with here. Riley dumped her best friend, had a miserable day at school, and quit hockey. The writers have put together a killer script! Just because Joy and Sadness are gone, I have to do stupid Dream Duty. Okay. How are we going to wake her up? Well, she wakes up sometimes when she has a scary dream. We could scare her. Scare her? No, she's been through enough already. But, Joy... Sadness, you may know your way around down here, but I know Riley. We're gonna make her so happy, she'll wake up with exhilaration. We'll excite her awake! That's never happened before. Riley loves dogs. Put this on. I don't think that'll work. Bing Bong? Yeah? Don't let anything happen to these. Got it. Add the reality distortion filter. Love it. Remember, play to the camera, everyone! Riley is the camera! Makeup, get out of there, we are on in five, four, three... Hello, class. Before we begin today's pop quiz... Man, she is one bad actress. ...which counts for 90% of your final grade, I want to introduce our new student. Riley. Would you like to stand up and introduce yourself? Camera. And cue Riley. My name is Riley Andersen. I'm from Minnesota and now I live here. Look! Her teeth are falling out! That's disgusting. Gross! Teeth falling out. Yeah, I'm used to that one. Let me guess, we have no pants on. Hey, look! She came to school with no pants on! Called it! Ready? I don't think this happy thing is going to work. But if we scare her... Just follow my lead. Here we go. Bark! Bark! Bark! Who is that? What's going on? You're on! Go! Let's party! Let's dance! Hey, a party. Bark, bark, bark! Joy, this isn't working. Sadness, what are you doing? Come back here! It's just a dream, it's just a dream. It's just a dream. They're trying to wake her up. Call security! Hi, Riley, it's me! Who's your friend who likes to play? Bing Bong? Bing Bong, Bing Bong! Sadness, stop! It was working! Sadness! You are ruining this dream! You're scaring her! But look, it's working! They are not part of this dream. Get them! Stop right there! Pan away! Pan away! Pick a plotline! Careful! Hold still! You can't do this! I know people in Headquarters! Cut that out! Please! Do you like candy? You look hungry. I get you candy! No! No, no. No, no! There go the Core Memories! I can't go in there! I'm scared of the dark! Please! Come on. What is this place? The Subconscious. It's where they take all the troublemakers. My hat feels loose. How do we get in? Let me see. You got my hat? Or is that your hat? Yeah, it's my hat. You sure? Look in the label. Yeah, it says, ""My hat."" Wait, it says, ""My hat""? My hat, it says. That's what I wrote in my hat. What are you talking about? You've got my hat on. Okay, but it's my handwriting. Hey! You! You caught us! Get back in there! No escaping! I don't like it here. It's where they keep Riley's darkest fears. It's broccoli. The stairs to the basement! Grandma's vacuum cleaner! Okay, come on. Would you walk quieter? I'm trying. What is going... Candy wrappers? Bing Bong! Joy? There you are. It's Jangles. Who's the birthday girl? Who's the birthday girl? Do you have the Core Memories? Yeah. All he cared about was the candy! We're out of here! Let's get to that train! Wait! The train's not running. We still have to wake up Riley. But how? Oh, no! Hey, Sadness. Did you hear about the party they were having? Yeah. Yes, Joy. Isn't it a birthday party? Did you say birthday? And there's going to be cake and presents. And games and balloons... A birthday? Okay. Follow us! Nothing like a good scare to wake you up, right? Okay, but it's my handwriting. No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that. No, but this one's my handwriting. Who's the birthday girl? Come on, let's go! We made it! Guess who's on their way to Headquarters! We are! What is going on? He did it again! We were at school, and we were naked, and there was a dog, and his back half was chasing him and then we saw Bing Bong! You idiot! It was a dream! This is ridiculous! We can't even get a good night's sleep anymore. Time to take action. Stupid Mom and Dad. If they hadn't moved us, none of this would've happened. Who's with me? No. Yeah. Let's do it. She took it. There's no turning back. So how are we going to get to Minnesota from here? Well, why don't we go down to the elephant lot and rent an elephant? Hey. That sounds nice. We're taking the bus, nitwit! There's a bus leaving tomorrow. Perfect! A ticket costs money. How do we get money? Mom's purse. You wouldn't. But I would. Where was it we saw it last? TripleDent gum No! It's downstairs somewhere. Mom and Dad got us into this mess. They can pay to get us out. How about this, huh? Isn't this nice? You can see everything from up here. Look, there's Inductive Reasoning. There's DÃ©ja Vu. There's Language Processing. There's DÃ©ja Vu. There's Critical Thinking. There's DÃ©ja Vu. Hey, look at this, guys! Memories! Hey. That was a good idea. About scaring Riley awake. You're not so bad. Really? Nice work. I can't wait to get the old Riley back. As soon as we get there, I'm going to fix this whole mess. Is this Riley? She's so big now. She won't fit in my rocket. How are we gonna get to the moon? It's that time in the twisty tree, remember? The hockey team showed up and Mom and Dad were there cheering. Look at her, having fun and laughing. I love this one. I love that one, too. Atta girl! Now you're getting it! Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit. Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I? I'll tell you what. We can keep working on that when we get back. Okay? Okay. But I just don't understand. Why did our moving van even go to Texas? Multiple customers? Well, we were promised delivery on the fifth. Excuse me, isn't there any way that you can rush it? Honesty Island? Look out! Come on! Hold on! Hurry up! Come on! Over here! Come on, people! Let's, go, go, go! Oh that was our way home. We lost another island? What is happening? Haven't you heard? Riley's running away. What? Wait, wait, hang on, guys. Are we really doing this? I mean, this is serious. Look. We have no Core Memories. You want Riley to be happy? Let's get back to Minnesota and make more. Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her. Family Island. Let's go! Joy! Joy! It's too dangerous! We won't make it in time. But that's our only way back! A recall tube! We can get recalled! Have a great day, sweetheart. See you after school, monkey. We love you! Go! Run, run! Go! Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop! You're hurting Riley! No, no, no! I did it again! If you get in here, these Core Memories will get sad. I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy. Joy? Joy! Joy! Joy? Joy! Joy, what are you doing? Will you stop it, please? Don't you get it, Joy? We're stuck down here. We're forgotten. We used to play tag and stuff. But everything's different now. Since we moved. Do you remember how she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring? I could listen to her stories all day. I just wanted Riley to be happy. And now... It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit. Sadness. Mom and Dad... The team... They came to help because of Sadness. We have to get back up there. Joy, we're stuck down here. We might as well be on another planet. Another planet. Who's your friend who likes to play? Who's your friend who likes to play?

We... Bing Bong? Bing Bong! You made it! Go! Go save Riley! Take her to the moon for me. Okay? I'll try, Bing Bong. I promise. We're home! Riley? Riley! I'll call her cell. This is terrible. Wait, is that someone walking towards us? Yep, let's cross the street. It's Mom. She's onto us! What do we do? Where's my bag? Riley needs to get Core Memories. That's the stuff. We keep going. Sadness! Sadness! Sadness? Come on, Sadness. Where are you? Okay. If I were Sadness, where would I be? Everything is awful and my legs don't work, and you have to drag me around while I touch all the... Oh, no! It's Mom again! What do we do? This is madness! She shouldn't run away! Let's get this idea out of her head. Sadness? Sadness! Joy? Wait! Sadness! Just let me go! Riley's better off without me! Come back! Okay, you're saying your husband was blown away by an elephant. Was he with anyone? Yes! And there she is! Hey! Come back here! Forget it, Jake. It's Cloud Town. What? Sadness! I only make everything worse! Wait! Sadness! We got to get you back to... It's stuck! Great. What do you mean it's stuck? Now what? Oh, no! What is this? How do we stop it? I got it! Make her feel scared! That'll make her change her mind! Brilliant! I know it's brilliant! Do it! Nothing's working! Why isn't it working? Let me try. Great! You broke it! No, I didn't! Don't touch that! Move! Guys, we can't make Riley feel anything. What have we done? Hey! Hey, look at me! Did you mean what you said before? I would die for Riley! I would die for Riley! Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it. I would die for Riley! I would die for Riley! I would die for Riley! That's it! I fold! This is crazy. This is crazy. No, no, no. Joy. Be positive. I am positive this is crazy! Now! For Riley! Joy? Hang on! I wish Joy was here! It's Joy! Stand back! That worked. Well, what would you do, if you're so smart? I'd tell you, but you're too dumb to understand. What? Of course your tiny brain is confused. Guess I'll just have to dumb it down to your level. Sorry I don't speak moron as well as you, but let me try. Duh! Thank goodness you're back! Things are really messed up! We found this idea. We were just trying to make happy memories. Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there! Sadness, it's up to you. Me? Sadness? I can't, Joy. Yes, you can. Riley needs you. Okay. Wait! Stop! I want to get off! All right. Thank you. We will. Her teacher hasn't even seen Riley all day. What was she wearing last? I can't believe this. Riley, there you are! Thank goodness! We were worried sick! Where have you been? It's so late! Honey! What happened? Are you all right? We asked the neighbors, I called the school, we talked to your teacher. I know you don't want me to but... I miss home. I miss Minnesota. You need me to be happy, but... I want my old friends, and my hockey team. I want to go home. Please don't be mad. Sweetie. We're not mad. You know what? I miss Minnesota too. I miss the woods where we took hikes. And the backyard where you used to play. Spring Lake, where you learned to skate. Come here. Hey, I'm liking this new view. Friendship Island has expanded. Glad they finally opened that Friendly Argument section. I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island. Fashion Island? Everyone shut up. Boy Band Island? Hope that's just a phase. Say what you want, I think it's all beautiful. All right. Here you go. Your new expanded console is up and running. Cool! Upgrade! Hey! Whoops, wait. Did I just do that? Hey, guys? What's puberty? I don't know. It's probably not important. I have access to the entire curse word library! This new console is the... Sorry. I did it again. My bad. They're getting to the rink. Now when you get out there, you be aggressive! I know, Dad. But not too aggressive. You know, you guys don't have to come to every game. Are you kidding? I'm not missing one! Go Foghorns! Go Riley! Foghorns are the best! Okay! I got to go! They love us. Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool. Guys, of course they are. But we can't show it. She loved the face painting! Told you it was a great idea! Best idea he's had in a while. He's a really good guy. Just in case. Oh! Sorry. Girl! Girl! Girl! Okay. Bye. Remember, just hustle. Go, Riley! You got this! You ready? Yeah. All right. Let's play some hockey! All right, Anger, take it! Give us that puck or you're dead meat! On our left. On our left! Let's just try not to get all smelly this time. Mom and Dad are watching us fail. Not for long! We've been through a lot lately, that's for sure. But we still love our girl. She has great new friends, a great new house. Things couldn't be better. After all, Riley's twelve now. What could happen? And who can tell me what year San Francisco was founded? Anyone? Jordan? How much more of this? Five months, two weeks and four days until summer vacation. Then it's off to the Bahamas with you know who! Come fly with me, gatinha. Have a nice day. What are we mad about? I don't know. Whatever Troy's mad about. What's Troy mad about? I don't know. I know. Totally. We're a total fraud! Do you think they can see through us? Of course not! We're wearing eye shadow! Being cool is so exhausting. Who's the birthday girl? Hey! Hello! Six years of drama school for this? Move it, will you? What are you doing? Come on! You know what? This is okay. This is fine. We just need to go to our happy place. TripleDent gum No!

Mars Needs Moms,Disney,2010,2011,Animation,"NASA scientists are excited over recent findings by the Mars Rover  of fossilised organic compounds on the surface that indicate  at some time in the past there may have been life on the red planet.  Thank you. Was it really that hard? Every day with the trash! What is the big deal? Well, can you imagine what the world would look like if nobody took out the trash? Yeah, it would be awesome. And speaking of trash, have you cleaned your room yet? And don't forget to shut the door. Milo, sweetie, can you get that? I have to do everything around here. Stromboli's Slave Shack, captive 331 speaking. Hey, stinker. Dad! Hey, are you almost home?  Because the movie starts at five, and then it starts again at seven, and I... Hold on. Slow down. Slowdown.  I don't think I'm gonna make it back in time.  Well, you can't miss the beginning. That's when the vampires take over the submarine... No, I know. I know. But... looks like my flight's cancelled. And no one's flying till this weather lets up.  I'm really sorry, Milo.  I'll make it home as soon as I can.  I love you. OK. Bye.  Hi, honey. What's up? Stuck at the airport.  That's too bad. Milo was really looking forward to... I was looking forward to taking him. Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  Well, maybe if he finishes all his dinner he could watch Zombie Dawn III on payperview.  Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! You didn't eat your broccoli. Broccoli makes me barf. Besides, it looks like brains. Well, you like zombies. Zombies eat brains. Mom, no one likes zombies. They're an abomination. I'm committed to their annihilation. OK. Well, no broccoli, no TV. Milo! Come over here. Is that broccoli? No. That's vomit, but I understand the confusion. I thought I told you to eat that. Well, you're not gonna make me eat it now, are you? Go to bed. But you said I could watch... No. That was before you lied to me and poisoned the cat! That broccoli was poisonous? No! Of course the broccoli wasn't poisonous. Well, you just said that... No! I meant that it's poisonous to the cat. Well, how can it be good for me if it's poisonous to the cat? Because cats are not supposed to eat vegetables. Maybe I'm not supposed to eat vegetables. Milo! Just go to bed. Now. I thought I told you to go to bed! You told me to go to bed. You didn't say get into bed. It's not specific. Milo! My life would be so much better if I didn't have to be a nagging mom. Yeah, well, my life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all. Cujo. Wake up. I can't sleep. I shouldn't have said what I said, should I? It wasn't a good thing to say. I feel really bad about it. I should go tell her I'm sorry. Right? I'm gonna go tell her I'm sorry. Right now. Mom? Are you still up? 'Cause I wanted to tell you that... Mom? Mom? Milo? Mom? Mom! Mom? Mom! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Mom! Let me go! Hey! I'm... I'm caught in here! Let me...

You sent me down a trash chute, you jerk! Yeah. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.  Prepare to disembark the aircraft. Let him down easy, TwoCat.  Hello? You like video games, man? Check it out. Space flight simulator. I programmed it from the manual so it's just like the real thing. I'm just messing with you. Hey, brother! Yeah. You're not a Martian. You're a kid. Man, it's been so long since I've seen another kid. Hey! I'm excited, too, buddy. My name is Gribble. Gribble the First. What's your handle? No, wait, let me guess. Maverick. No. Wolfman? No. Iceman. No. Did you see Top Gun?  It's Milo. Milo. How low can you go, Milo? How 'bout I call you ""My Bro""? Check it. You're a person... ...from Earth! Shut up! What, are you crazy? I'm part of Ronald Reagan's secret astronaut programme. The Secronauts. You might have heard of us. We're here to stop the threat of interplanetary Communism throughout the galaxy. Why else do you think they call it ""the Red Planet""? I do crazy stuff like that all the time, man. You're gonna have so much fun here. It's wobbly and shaky here. Come on! I wanna show you something. You gotta move pretty fast to keep up with me, buddy. Wait. Come on down! Hey, check my room out, bro! Oh, man. You're not used to the low gravity yet? OK, OK, OK. Don't worry, man. I can totally fix that. I can fix anything. There we go. I got an extra. Listen, I just wanna try and find my mom. This'll hold you down. What is it? Right here. OK? I'm gonna patent it, call it the Gribblemeister 3000. It's working, right? That's awesome. I wanna show you something cool. What? Hold on tight. Banzai! The weight belt helping you? Check this out, man. They're trying to figure out how you escaped. Watch this. Oh, my word! I cannot get out! Help me! Oh, wait, wait, wait. Watch this, watch this, watch this. You wanna hear what they're saying? Sure you do. Wait. Gribble, I wanna find my mom. TwoCat! That is disgusting. Here we go. What is that? That's a translator. Wait. Supervisor not likee. Getting off me, you Martian!  Unauthorised dogpile!  ""Unauthorised dogpile""? I know. They say that all the time. Come with me, man. This is so cool. Hey! Come on in. What do you think, bro? About what? About the room, bud. It's for you, man. What do you think? For me? Oh, don't mind this guy. I just tried to train him to be like my wingman, you know, but he's useless. It's more like a wing nut. Oh, gosh. I'm gonna get rid of him. But forget it, man. That's all history. 'Cause I got you now! Me? Yeah. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you and me, bro. Best buds hanging out forever. Playing video games all day, watching TV all night. There's no such thing as too much TV, man. Mom? Oh, yeah. Maybe there is such a thing as too much TV. No. Wait. I wanna show you something in here. What are they saying? Subject will be terminating.  Ohfour, ohthree... ""Terminating."" Terminating?  Terminating. I love that movie. Hey, you know what? Let's go. I wanna show you something cool, dude. No, wait. Gribble, what's going on? I don't wanna tell ya, and you can't make me. OK? Just forget about it. No, Gribble, tell me. Please! System overload! System overload! Tell me! Help! Hey! Tell me! Oh, my... Get... Uncle! Get off! Chafey. All right. All right, I'll tell you. Fact is... ...Mars needs moms. What the heck does that mean? These are hatchlings. They are baby Martians, and they pop out of the ground, like potatoes, every 25 years or so. And the Martians, they're terrible at mothering, which is ironic, really, since the ones running the place upstairs, they're all female. Can you get to the point? I... All right. What they are good at is building robots, right? So they build these Nannybots to raise the girls. And each Nannybot gets one kid to raise, and then it's toast. It can't be reused after that. Who knew mothering was so hard? ""Hard?"" So why did they take my mom? OK. They have to program the Nannybots each time, right? So... they find someone who is really good at controlling their own kid. Hey, that's my house. And that's me! Are these my mom's memories? Yeah. See, all these Martians care about is order and discipline. What was that one about? Just tell me what they're gonna do to my mom. All right. Right up there. You see, they have this memory extraction machine. It takes the discipline out of the mom and it puts it into the Nannybots. It works on some kind of solarwind focusing system. And when the sun rises... ...they extract what they need to program the Nannybots, and that's it. OK? That's it. Wait. So my mom is gonna lose all her memories? Yeah, something like that. No, that... that can't happen. We've gotta save her! Well, that's impossible, so, like, get over it and move on. But we've gotta try. We've gotta try! This, my friend, is a Martian wristwatch. You see the bars here? Counts down to sunrise. So you must have about 6.93 Earth hours left. Less than seven hours? That's all? Let's say that, for the sake of argument, that we do, we disguise you. And we use all this awesome spy gear to guide you up to the surface. Those Martians, man, they... They're gonna spot you. They're gonna chase you and shoot at you and... and... and... Wait a minute. I think it's a brilliant idea. But you just said they're gonna shoot at me. What? Oh, hey. What you talking about, ""shoot""? ""Shoot""? That's crazy talk. That's what you said. Who said that? Someone say he's gonna shoot at him? What are you talking about, brother? No one's shooting at anybody. Don't even sweat it. You trust me. This is gonna be great. No, you know what? As a matter of fact, this is gonna be... ...Gribbletastic. Yeah! I don't know, Gribble. Are you sure this is gonna work? Yeah, dude. It's gonna be awesome.  That disguise totally rocks. Trust me, you're gonna blend right in.  Even the SISS won't spot you.  The SISS? What's the SISS? Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention them.  They're the Supervisor's Secret Security. They're the ones in the black uniforms. But I'll take care of them, man. Don't worry about it. Anything else you ""forgot to mention""?  What? No. What're you... Me? Dude, honest Injun, man. We're in this together. Once he gets up top, he's gonna give himself away. They're gonna chase him halfway around Mars, and I'm gonna save his butt. And he's gonna be so totally grateful. It's gonna be so cool. Give me a break. OK, OK. So, it's a... it's a fib, but it's for his own good, man. After this, he'll stay down here, where it's safe. OK, go ahead.  Dude, you march like a girl! Which is kind of perfect.  There's that bleachedprune lady again. Who is that? That's the Supervisor. She's like the school lunch lady,  only with the power to execute you on sight.  Man, Mars needs Botox. Don't mess with her. She runs everything around here.  Gribble, are you seeing this? Yeah, man. Those tags are so cool.  I don't know who does 'em, but the Supervisor hates 'em.  Oh, hey, look sharp, man.  You see that tall building up ahead? That's the Citadel.  Your mom's up at the top.  You get up there and get your mom.  I am gonna program the ship  and make it repeat its last Earth mission, and then, boom!  You're through the wormhole and home in time for PopTarts. OK? Easy.  TwoCat, this is it, man. They're gonna spot him here for sure. Stop it. Don't look at me like that. I'm gonna take care of him. Check it out, all right? When he gets to the checkpoint gate, he's gonna trigger the alarm, the guards'll close in, I'm gonna press this button. The cleaning hatch is gonna open, gonna drop down to the maintenance floor, where he can escape down the trash chute. See? It's very simple. OK. It'll all be fine.  But if anything, you know, weird or unexpected happens,  just run like crazy, OK?  You see? Totally in my control. I pushed the wrong one. Oh, my gosh! Oh, no, no, no, no! Gribble, where are they taking me? OK, just give me a minute.  Don't have an aneurysm.  Oh, man, OK, you're going up, and that's not good.  I thought I wanted to go up? Well, yes and no.  This is a very, very bad up.  OK, OK, OK... don't panic.  Get ready. For what?  How about running, for starters? Go, go, go, go!  And he's off! Yes! Finally. Gribble! Which way now? Dang, I'm good! Gribble!  I'm a tiedye, superfly Catch me on the other side  Tartchoppin', bodypoppin'...  Gribble! Stop being such an idiot and tell me which way! Did you just call me an idiot? Which way? I'm lost here! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I think that you have to apologise now.  Gribble! I'm waiting.  All right, all right, I'm sorry! Apology accepted. Go left.  No, no, no, no, not that left! Not that left, not that left!  Back up, man!  Turn it down, Gribble! TwoCat, turn off your alarm!  What is going on here? TwoCat?  Oh, no. Mommy? Mommy!  Gribble! I need to know... Gribble, come in. Are you there? Gribble! Come on, Gribble, this is no time for the silent treatment! Gribble? Help me. I'm trapped, and there's nowhere to hide! Gribble! If not using ropes, my friend, you will needing wings. We must cleaning paint off you before someone is seeing you. It will getting you in trouble. Giving me your helmet... The Earth hatchling! Gribble! Gribble, come in. They've spotted me! But I think I lost them! Get off me! Let me go! Let me go! Cool it! I gotta clean you up! Get off of me! Hey! Mellow out, man! I'm not the fuzz! I'm not bustin' you. You're not? Check it out! What is that? They were tracking me? Not you. They were trackin' whoever you were chattin' with. Who I was... who I was talk... I was talking to Gribble! Oh, no! No time! Sorry! No time! You got time now? This is so low temperature! OK. You're from Earth, so you must know... What do you ""turn on""? How do you ""tune in""? What do you ""drop out"" of? What powers do flowers have? That's English! Where did you learn English? Two quarters ago, I was working in the administration block.  The Supervisor was talking with 113Elder331.  They were viewing some topsecret Earth documents.  When they left, I wanted to check out what was making the weird light.  What's going on here?  It's a chrysanthemum, baby.  A chrysanthemum?  That's not a chrysanthemum.  And it was...  ... amazing! So I copied all I could.  The way that light vibrated and sang!  Nothing in my world has ever made me feel like that!  It was like my eyes were open for the first time.  It was crazy beautiful, man.  This is a chrysanthemum.  Flower power, it's gonna change the world, man!  Yeah, that's just groovy, man.  They called it...  Colour. Your hippie alien life story is totally interesting, but I'm kinda busy saving my mom! You mean your Nannybot. No! I mean my mom! She's a human being! Wait. No, but... I saw inside her headspace. You said, ""My life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all."" I know what I said, but I was wrong, and I do want her. Heavy! Why? Because she... She looks after me and she tells me what to do! Oh, like the Supervisor! No, not like the Supervisor! My mom is kind. She takes me to Disneyland, and she reads to me, and she makes me hot chocolate, and she puts bandages on my cuts, and she hugs me and she... She loves me. ""Love""? Chute number three. Crazy. Gribble? Can you hear me now? Gribble? Oh, no. Gribble? Gribble? Gribble? Gribble! Oh, no. That's only five and a half hours! Stupid weights. ""Private. Keep out. No Martians allowed."" ""Gribble."" ""George Ribble."" He must've been a kid, too, when he came here. Why wouldn't he tell me? TwoCat? TwoCat! Hold on, buddy. Are you OK? Oh, here. Where's Gribble, TwoCat? I gotta find him! He's the only person on this entire planet who can help me save my mom. That burnt area. That's where they shoot people, isn't it? That's a firing squad, and they're gonna shoot Gribble? TwoCat, we gotta save him! Ladies, ladies, you don't wanna do this. Listen, I'm a walking Abomb! You shoot me, and the whole planet's gonna go up! You don't want that on your conscience... OK, seriously. OK, you could be precipitating a major interplanetary war here, people, aliens, Martians. OK, listen! I've been living in your sewers for years. I'm disgusting, they're contaminated, and they need a vaccine and I'm the only one that has it. OK. Listen. You made your point. I invented some great stuff! I can let you in on the ground floor, OK? How 'bout blue mascara? I've got a Slinky! A Rubik's Cube? You like Dungeons and Dragons, I love Dungeons and Dragons.  How 'bout skateboards? I got millions... OK. Hey! I can get you a Cabbage Patch Kid. Not one of those gnarly ones, a real one. What about a pizza? You like crop circles? I have quite a crop. Oh, and I'll teach you how to moonwalk. Can't really do it in these chains. Legwarmers! Wait, wait. We're really gonna do this? Unauthorised dogpile! Hey! Milo, what are you doing here? I'm rescuing you. What does it look like? It's exactly according to my plan! Ki! Hot, hot, hot! Wait! Stop it with the shooting! My toe! What are you doing? Oh, my gosh! When you're going to shoot a laser at someone, you should bring them a change of underwear! Hairy Tribe Guys. Wingnut? OK. OK. Thank you. Oh, come on. Let go! Let go! What are you doing? They're hugging! It's all these males ever do! That's why the females chuck 'em down here! We don't have time! The SISS are gonna find us! Run! Run! Wingnut! It's Wingnut! OK. Come on! Come on. What?! Wingnut! No! Wait! Gribble! Relax, Grib. Fat floats. Hey! Oh, nuts. There goes my sexy tan. Less than three and a half hours. Echo! This place is amazing! It's Gribbletastic. You have got to stop saying that. You sound Gribblediculous. Hey, hey. TwoCat's homing in on our headsets. I built him with a location device. I think of everything. I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb. Stretch... stretch that bar across this rock. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good, good. You know this place is perfect? We can rebuild right over there. You see that? No. Keep still. Yeah, right, sorry. Build a whole new lair. Be years before we fill this place up with our junk. What do you say, pal? You and me? Best buds? You can be emperor this time. And I... I shall be El Presidente.  Hey! Again with the shooting? We just talked about this! Gimme that! But... Maniac! These things are dangerous! Tried to blow up some trash once with one of these, almost took my foot off! Yes! Oh, good, it's nearly empty. Anyway, why don't we go rebuild right over here. What do you think? That lava slope looks like our best way up. My mom's running out of time, Gribble. Let's go! Hey, no, come on! It can't be done! Did you see what happened up there? Man, I nearly got toasted! To death! Thanks for saving me, but... I'm never going up there again, man. You... You can't! You can't just bail on me now! Bye. George! Your name's George! What did you just call me? George. George Ribble. You were a kid, like me! Where did you get this? This is mine. They took your mom, too, didn't they? It's OK, Grib, I know how you feel! How I feel? How I feel... You have no idea how I feel. You see this? This is when they chose my mom. But way before they chose yours. I know, Gribble. It happened to me the same way. No. No, you don't know. How could you possibly know? I was a good kid. I did my chores. Put my things away. I did as I was told. Turns out, that's exactly why they chose her. 'Cause of me. Man. What kind of message is that to send to a little kid? I know. It's not fair! I'll tell you what's not fair, man. Not fair is when a bunch of scary aliens take your mama,  your only parent, away from you in the middle of the night.  Not fair is when you follow them, and you sneak onto their ship,  and you search but you can't find her.  And then you see her...  They got your mama strapped into some kind of machine.  Mom! So I grabbed a couple of breathing helmets,  and I went to get her.  But I didn't know what I know now. I didn't know...  ... that when the sun came up, it'd start the machine.  I didn't know... what that machine was gonna do to her.  Not until it was too late.  And then I realised...  ... I was all alone.  I'd never see my mom again.  And I'd never be able to tell her I loved her. ""Never be able to tell her you love her..."" What do you mean? No, no, you don't have to worry about that. It's not gonna happen. Not this time. Not to you. We're gonna go up there and we're gonna... We're gonna go get your mom. Really? You mean it? Yeah. You and me, buddy. Best buds, right? Thank you, Gribble. Yeah, man. Yeah, we'll get your mom back, man. ""Best buds."" That's like the ""love"" thing, right? My, my, my, my... ...my, my Sharona! No! Gribble! Evasive action! I'm sorry. No, Gribble! Gribble, stop! Relax! Don't shoot me, please! Gribble, Gribble! Relax! Listen! She's not gonna shoot you! She's not gonna shoot you! She's not? No! She's the one that helped us escape! She is? TwoCat brought her. He did? I used to be administration unit 231Ki312. But now, I'm down with your scene, man. What is she talking about? I don't know. She talks like that a lot. But I think she wants to help us, right? Right on! Come on! We gotta beat feet! ""Beat feet""? Oh, you mean run! Yeah, we do! Yeah! All right, Gribble, let's go! OK! Come on! It's just so weird! Come on, guys! This is the way out! Is there gonna be a lot of running? Psychedelic! What are they? They're paintings. You know, like your flower graffiti. Wait! Wait, wait! Ki, Ki! Hold on. You're the one... ...that paints those flower tags? That is so bad! Bad? But... but it is meant to be good. No. No, no, I mean... no. Bad means good. I just, I think that... I think that they're amazing and... I think that... I think you're amazing. Gribble! You can change colour! What? That is also...""bad"". What is that? That? It looks like a family. Kids and parents. That's the ""love"" thing. What are ""parents""? You know, people like my mom, who look after kids like me? I guess you guys had families once. You know, if you Martians had parents, you wouldn't have to kidnap moms to program your Nannybots. Come on. But... But the Supervisor said that Martians have always been raised by machines. Wow, looks like she lied to you, big time. We never knew. That's the Citadel. We've got to get to the top. That's where mission control is, on the surface. Your mom is in the Extraction Machine here. And your ride back to Earth is in the silo here. That's all well and good, guys, but I don't think we're gonna make it to the Citadel. Why are they checking everyone? Well, you're kind of a celebrity now, buddy. And who is that handsome devil next to you? You better keep your heads down. If they bust you, they will slap you in the joint! Wait a minute. That's exactly where we wanna go! Yeah! He's right on! What? What... Hey! We're going to jail? No, no. When they first found me, they brought me straight to jail. The jail's next to the silo where they keep the spaceship! OK. Sublevel two. Go ahead. If we can get through the jail, and up through the silo, we can get to the surface. And that's where Mom is. Yes, but isn't the jail thousands of feet above us? One thousand and thirtytwo! Wait! Wait a minute. How strong is this line? I'm a little over my goal weight right now. Hey! OK. We've got to take out the guards, shut down the surveillance cameras, then we can sneak through the jail and get to the silo. We catching the two terrorists.  Supervisor ordering we must locking them in cells.  Is this gonna work? No, wait. No! No, please, please, no! I don't wanna go back to jail! Please! No, no, please! No! I need a doctor and I've got measles! And I've got gingivitis! And I've got male pattern baldness. I will getting prisoner tranquilizers. Where are they? Bottom left control. Restless leg syndrome! I got Saturday Night Fever! Bat wing disorder! And halitosis! Yes! Horrible halitosis! I do? Hey! Awesome! And this officially ends today's prison broadcast! Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go! OK, here's the plan. I'll go get my mom. You guys fire up the spaceship, and we'll be outta here before they can say... Hey, Grib, what are you doing? It's Wingnut, man! He's still alive! Hey, bud. I can't just leave him in here. OK, well, get him out, but do it fast! We gotta go! OK. Come on! This will do it. Yeah! Come on out, you freakazoid! I know. I know. It's OK. What's with all the grabbing and squeezing? It's called ""hugging"". It's another love thing. OK, enough already. Come on! We gotta go! Man! I must have opened up all the cells. Who let the dogs out? No duh. What? What's going on? It's the hatchlings. They're sorting them. Yeah. The girls are all assigned their Nannybots. And the boys are sent down below where they'll be raised by the Hairy Tribe Guys. These guys knew a bunch of boy hatchlings were coming! That's why they were dancing down in the trash. They were celebrating! Yeah, but all the Hairy Tribe Guys are up here now. There's no one down there to take care of them. The boys are gonna be all alone. And to be alone is... ...to be without the crazy love thing. Yeah. Come on, guys. We gotta go! Wait. Wait! Go down the garbage chutes! Listen, listen! Guys! If you jump down chute number three, you can save the hatchlings. OK? Do you understand? Chute... ...number... three! Come on, Grib. One, two, three! We gotta go! They'll figure it out! No, they won't! They're dumb as a box of rocks. Ki. It's no use. We gotta go! Go, Wingnut! On the other side of the rocket, there's a ladder up to the surface. But how do we get past all those Martians? I can totally fix that. Hey, everybody grab a helmet. Put it on real tight. Good game. Good game. Good game. Here. Don't forget that. Keep in touch, kiddo. Get up that ladder over there. Good luck! Wait a minute! Won't they see me from Mission Control? No way, buddy. They'll be looking into the rising sun.  Won't be able to see a thing. By the time they figure out what's going on,  we'll be on the couch eating Smurf Berry Crunch and watching HeMan.  Gribble. Gribble.  Yes. And I am Ki. Remember? No, I know. I mean... No, I said that because, well, you know, the ship's got this... voiceactivated launch system. And I had to record a word, and Ki just didn't seem like a word that would start an engine... you know? Except... ...now that I think about it... ...""Ki"" is like a perfect word to start an engine because it's, you know, used to... ...unlock things like... ...my heart. I dig it when you change colour. Gribble! Ki! I'm halfway there! Oh, no! What dummy left that there? Milo? Gribble, I think I fell into something! Gribble, come in! It's OK, Ki. I've got him. Great job!  Gribble! Hey. That's the secondtolast lens! We're not gonna make it!  You wanna bet? Yeah! This thing is going on my Christmas list! Guys! The SISS are gonna crash Mission Control! They'll be through the airlock and on the surface any minute!  Oh, no! What do we do? All right, take her in. OK. You go save your mom. I'll take care of the SISS. But, Gribble, they're gonna... No, no, no. My mama always said, ""Son, you gotta do the right thing."" And for the first time since I came to Mars, I'm doing it. Man, I hope Ki saw that. Go get 'em. Fire butt blasters! Mom! Mom! Mom, wake up! Wake up! Milo, can you turn the cartoons down? I'm trying to sleep. No. Mom, come on. You gotta wake up! We gotta get out of here! Milo, the alarm hasn't even gone off. Can you just let me sleep until sunrise? Believe me, that would be a bad idea. Gribble! Gribble, Gribble, Gribble.  Oh, no! I activated the launch system. Come on. We gotta get out of here. Come on! Come on! Come on, Mom. Come on! We gotta go. Hurry! Hurry! Mom, come on! Mom, Mom! Milo? The launch system lit up.  I can't cool it.  You got two minutes.  Two minutes! Mom, come on. We gotta hurry. Mom. Wait a second. Did you just pull me out of bed? No! Mom, Mom. Mom! Mom, listen. Mom, look at me. Mom, look at me. Look at me. I'll explain everything, but later. OK? Right now we gotta get to the ship. The ship? The ship. What ship?! That ship! Milo! Sixty seconds. Get it on! Everything's gonna be fine. OK. Here. Just put this on. And then you gotta twist this lever to seal the neck. See? Like this. What do you mean? We need air. We can't breathe outside. There's no air? Mom, it's Mars. OK. One, two, three! Help! Now, start running! Run! Are those Martians? Yeah. The hairy guys are good, and the uniforms are bad. Let's just hope we don't see... ...the Supervisor! No! Mom! You gave me your helmet? No! No! Mom! No! No! No! Mom! Mom! No! No! No! No, Mom! Mom, no! No. Mommy, you have to come home with me. You have to come home with me! You're... you're my mom... ...and I love you! No! No, no, no, no, no. No! Gribble! My mom! Bingo. Milo! I'm coming, buddy! I got it. I got it. Lift her head. Milo. You saved me. No. It was Gribble. No, bro. No, it was you, man. It was you. You saved your mom, man. I'm sorry for what I said before. My life wouldn't be better without you. Oh, Milo. My love. Milo! Gribble! I've got the ship under control...  Ki! I'm good.  I can buff out the scratches. Come on, Mom. We gotta go.  We gotta go. Oh, OK. Stopping right there! This is not over. You will surrendering. Hey! Surrender this! Ki! What are you doing? I will not letting you do this. Insolence! You cannot stopping this. This is the way it has always being. No. No. No! This is not the way it is always being. She lied to us! Look! We were not meant to being raised by machines. We were meant to be raised by families. By parents. We were meant to having that... that... That crazy love thing? That crazy love thing. Never! You fool. I saved you! Before any of you were even born I realised we do not have time to raise hatchlings. And the males? They never helped. Always dancing and playing. That is why we must throw them away. There must be order. Arresting the evildoers! Evildoer, you. No! I did this for you! I did this for all of you! You will be sorry. Let me go! So are you gonna stay? Wow. Wow... Actually, I think I'm gonna... You know, Mars is different now. I'm gonna hang out with Ki and... ...help paint and stuff. He's really good at red. Stop it. So will I ever see you again? What? Are you kidding me? Of course. We'll keep in touch. How? What do you mean ""how?"" I could fix it. It's gonna be Gribbletastic. Best buds? You better believe it. Thank you, Gribble. Your mother would be proud of you. It's my pleasure. Oh, man. I'm not crying. It's allergies. Silly. Bye! Goodbye! Bye. Bye! I love you, Milo. I know that... now. Dad! Hi, stinker. Hi, honey. Hi. Did something happen to Milo this weekend? Colour. Flower power is gonna change the world, man!  Mark. No, that's vomit. But I understand the confusion. I thought I told you to eat that. Well, you're not gonna make me eat it now, are you? Mom! My mom. She... she vacuums the house. You know, she vacuums the house. My... Yeah, she's the one. Yeah, that... No. I'm just messing with you. Oh, don't mind this guy. He's a... I just tried to train him to be like my wingman, you know, but he's useless. He's more like a wing nut. Yeah! No, you know what? As a matter of fact, this is gonna be... Gribbletastic. Yeah! How about running, for starters? Go, go, go, go! And he's off! Yes! Finally. I'm a tiedye, superfly Catch me on the other side  Tartchoppin', bodypoppin'...  Gribble! Stop being such an idiot and tell me which way! Did you just call me an idiot? Mark. Get... Wait a minute! Gribble! Let's hit every single pipe on the way down! Gribble! I'm trying! Again with the shooting? We just talked about this. I think that... I think that they're amazing and... I think that... I think that you're amazing. Gribble! You can change colour! What? That is also...""bad"". Mark. Chute... ...number... three! One, two, three! Come on, Grib. We gotta go! They'll figure it out! No, they won't. They're dumb as a box of rocks. What dummy left that there? No! Mom. Mom! Mom. Mom! Mom, listen. Mom, look at me. Mom, look at me. Look at me. I'll explain everything, but later. OK? Right now we've just gotta get to the ship. The ship? The ship. What ship?! That ship! "
Moana,Disney,2010,2016,Animation,"In the beginning... there was only ocean... until the mother island emerged. Te Fifi.  Her heart held the greatest power ever known. It could create life itself. And Te Fiti shared it with the world. But in time... some began to seek Te Fiti's heart. They believed if they could possess it... the great power of creation would be theirs. And one day... the most daring of them all... voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.  He was a demigod of the wind and sea. He was a warrior. A trickster. A shapeshifter who could change form... with the power of his magical fish hook. And his name... was Maui. But without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble... giving birth to a terrible darkness. Maui tried to escape... but was confronted by another who sought the heart. Te Ka! A demon of earth and fire. Maui was struck from the sky... never to be seen again. And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti... were lost to the sea. Where, even now... 1,000 years later... Te Ka and the demons of the deep... still hunt for the heart. Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread... chasing away our fish... draining the life from island after island... until every one of us is devoured... by the bloodthirsty jaws... of inescapable death! But one day... the heart will be found... by someone who will journey beyond our reef... find Maui... deliver him across the great ocean... to restore Te Fiti's heart... and save us all. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Thank you, Mother. That's enough. Papa. No one goes outside the reef. We are safe here. There is no darkness. There are no monsters. Monsters! There's no monsters, no monsters... It's the darkness! No, there is nothing beyond our reef, but storms and rough seas. I'm gonna throw up. As long as we stay on our very safe island... ...we'll be fine. The legends are true. Someone will have to go. Mother, Motunui is paradise. Who would want to go anywhere else? Shoo, shoo! Moana! There you are, Moana. What are you doing? You scared me. What? I wanna's go back. I know, I know. But you don't go out there. It's dangerous. Moana, come on. Let's go back to the village. You are the next great chief of our people. And you will do wondrous things, my little minnow. Oh, yes. But first, you must learn where you're meant to be. Moana Make way, make way Moana, it's time you knew The village of Motunui is all you need The dancers are practicing They dance to an ancient song Who needs a new song This old one's all we need  This tradition is our mission And Moana, there's so much to do Don't trip on the taro root That's all you need We share everything we make We joke and we weave our baskets The fishermen come back from the sea I wanna see Don't walk away Moana, stay on the ground now Our people will need a chief And there you are There you are There comes a day When you're gonna look around And realize happiness is Where you are Consider the coconut The what Consider its tree We use each part of the coconut It's all we need We make our nets from the fibers The water is sweet inside We use the leaves to build fires We cook up the meat inside Consider the coconuts The trunks and the leaves The island gives us what we need And no one leaves That's right, we stay We're safe and we're wellprovided And when we look to the future There you are You'll be okay In time you'll learn just as I did You must find happiness right where you are I like to dance with the water The undertow and the waves The water is mischievous Hal! I like how it misbehaves The village may think I'm crazy Or say that I drift too far But once you know what you like Well, there you are You are your father's daughter Stubbornness and pride Mind what he says but remember You may hear a voice inside And if the voice starts to whisper To follow the farthest star Moana, that voice inside is who you are Uhhuh. Dad! I was only looking at the boats. I wasn't gonna get on 'em. Come on. There's something I need to show you. I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes. This is a sacred place. A place of chiefs. There will come a time... when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain. Like I did. Like my father did. And his father, and every chief that has ever been. And on that day... when you add your stone... you will raise this whole island higher. You are the future of our people, Moana. And they are not out there. They are right here. It's time to be who they need you to be. We make our nets from the fibers We weave our nets from the fibers The water is sweet inside A real tasty treat inside We use the leaves to build fires We sing these songs in our choirs To cook up the meat inside We have mouths to feed inside The village believes in us That's right The village believes The island gives us what we need And no one leaves So here I'll stay My home, my people beside me And when  There we are I'll lead the way I'll have my people to guide me We'll build our future together Where we are 'Cause every path leads ya back to Where you are You can find happiness right Where you are Where you are And every storm, this roof leaks, no matter how many fronds I add. Fixed! Not the fronds. Wind shifted the post. Ah! Mmm! That's good pork! Oh! I didn't mean... I wasn't... What? They're calling me, so I got to... Bye! Ow! Ow! Ow! You're doing great. Is it done yet? So close. I'm curious about that chicken eating the rock. He seems to lack the basic intelligence required for pretty much everything. Should we maybe just cook him? Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface. Far beneath in some cases. But I'm sure there's more to Heihei than meets the eye. It's the harvest. This morning, I was husking the coconuts and... Well... we should clear the diseased trees and we will start a new grove. There. Thanks, Moana. She's doing great. This suits you. Chief? There's something you need to see. Our traps in the east lagoon... they're pulling up less and less fish. Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds. Uh, we have. There's no fish. Oh. Then we'll fish the far side of the island. We tried. The windward side. And the leeward side, the shallows, the channel. We've tried the whole lagoon. They're just gone. Have you tried using a different bait? I don't think it's the bait. There's no fish. It seems like it's getting worse and worse. Of course, I understand you have reason for concern. I will talk to the council. I'm sure we... What if we fish beyond the reef? No one goes beyond the reef. I know. But if there are no fish in the lagoon... Moana. And there's a whole ocean. We have one rule. An old rule, when there were fish. A rule that keeps us safe... But Dad, I... ...instead of endangering our people So you can run right back to the water. Every time I think you're past this... No one goes beyond the reef! Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad. Standing on a boat. I didn't say go beyond the reef, because I want to be on the ocean. But you still do. He's hard on you because... Because he doesn't get me. Because he was you. Drawn to the ocean. Down by the shore. He took a canoe, Moana. He crossed the reef... and found an unforgiving sea. Waves like mountains. His best friend begged to be on that boat. Your dad couldn't save him. He's hoping he can save you. Sometimes... who we wish we were, what we wish we could do... it's just not meant to be. I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember Never really knowing why ! Wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water No matter how hard I try Every turn I take Every trail I track Every path I make Every road leads back To the place I know Where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the Sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea Stays behind me One day I'll know If 1 go, there's just no telling how far I'll go  ! Know everybody on this island Seems so happy on this island Everything is by design ! Know everybody on this island Has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine ! Can lead with pride I can make us strong I'll be satisfied If I play along But the voice inside Sings a different song What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea It's blinding But no one knows How deep it goes And it seems like it's calling out to me So come find me And let me know What's beyond that line Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know How far I'll go Whoa. We're okay, Pua. I can do this. There's more fish beyond the reef. There's more beyond the reef. Not so bad. Pua! Whatever just happened... blame it on the pig. Gramma. Are you gonna tell Dad? I'm his mom. I don't have to tell him anything. He was right. About going out there. It's time to put my stone on the mountain. Okay. Well, then, head on back. Put that stone up there. Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it? You said that's what you wanted. It is. When I die... I'm going to come back as one of these. Or I chose the wrong tattoo. Why are you acting weird? I'm the village crazy lady. That's my job. If there's something you want to tell me, just tell me! Is there something you wanna tell me? Is there something you want to hear? You've been told all our people's stories... but one. What is this place? Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef? Ooh! What's in there? The answer to the question you keep asking yourself. Who are you meant to be? Go inside... bang the drum... and find out. Whoa. Oh. Bang the drum. We read the wind and the sky When the sun is high We sail the length of the seas On the ocean breeze At night we name every star We know where we are We know who we are Who we are We set a course to find A brand new island everywhere we roam We keep our island in our mind And when it's time to find home We know the way We are explorers reading every sign We tell the stories of our elders In a neverending chain We know the way We were voyagers. We were voyagers! We were voyagers! We were voyagers! We were voyagers! Why'd we stop? Maui. When he stole from the mother island, darkness fell. Te Ka awoke. Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back. To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging... and now we have forgotten who we are. And the darkness has continued to spread... chasing away our fish... draining the life... from island after island. Our island. But, one day... someone will journey beyond our reef, find Maui... deliver him across the great ocean... to restore the heart of Te Fiti. I was there that day. The ocean chose you. I thought it was a dream. Nope! Our ancestors believed Maui lies there... at the bottom of his hook. Follow it, and you will find him. But why would it choose me? I don't even know how to make it past the reef. But I know who does! The crops are turning black. What about the fish? This is happening all over the island. Please, please settle down. What are you going to do? We will dig new fields. We will find a way to... We can stop the darkness! Save our island! There's a cavern of boats. Huge canoes. We can take them, find Maui, make him restore the heart. We were voyagers. We can voyage again! You told me to help our people. This is how we help our people. Dad? What are you doing? I should've burned those boats a long time ago! No! Don't! We have to find Maui. We have to restore the heart! There is no heart! This is just a rock! No! Chief! It's your mother! Mother... What can be done? Go. Gramma. Go. Not now. I can't. You must! The ocean chose you. Follow the fish hook. Gramma... And when you find Maui... you grab him by the ear. You say... ""am Moana of Motunui. ""You will board my boat... ""sail across the sea... ""and restore the heart of Te Fiti."" I can't leave you. There is nowhere you could go that I won't be with you. Go! There's a line where the sky meets the sea And it calls me But no one knows How far it goes All that time wondering where I need to be is behind me I'm on my own To worlds unknown Every turn I take Every trail I track Is a choice I make Now I can't turn back from the great unknown Where I go alone Where I long to be See her light up the night in the sea She calls me And yes, I know That I can go There's a moon in the sky And the wind is behind me Soon I'll know How far I'll go I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my boat... sail across the sea and restore the heart of Te Fiti. I am Moana... of Motu... ...  Heihei? It's okay. You're all right. See? There we go. Nice water. The ocean is a friend of mine. Heihei? Heihei! Stay. Okay. Next stop, Maui. I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my boat... sail... across the sea... and restore the heart of Te Fiti. I am Moana of Motu... Board my boat! Oh, no. No, no, no! Ocean... can I get a little help? No, no. Please. Come on! Help me! Please! Whew! Um... What? I said help me! And wrecking my boat? Not helping! Fish pee in you all day! So... Maui? Maui! Maui, demigod of the wind and sea... I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my boat. No. You will board my boat. Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my... Boat! A boat! The gods have given me a... Maui, shapeshifter... demigod of the wind and sea... I am Moana of... Hero of men. What? It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea... hero of men. I interrupted. From the top. Hero of men. Go. I am... Sorry, sorry, sorry. And women. Men and women. Both. All. Not a guy, girl thing. You know, Maui is a hero to all. You're doing great. What? No! I'm here to... Of course. Yes, yes, yes. Maui always has time for his fans. When you use a bird to write with... it's called tweeting. I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero. You are not my hero. And I'm not here SO you can sign my oar! I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti! And you will board my boat... and sail across the sea and put it back! Um... Yeah, it almost sounded like you don't like me... which is impossible because... I got stuck here for 1,000 years... trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals. So you could have the power to create life itself. Yeah. So, what I believe you were trying to say... is ""thank you."" ""Thank you?"" You're welcome. What? No, no, no! I didn't... I wasn't... Why would I ever say that? Okay, okay. ! See what's happening Yeah You're face to face with greatness and it's strange You don't even know how you feel It's adorable Well it's nice to see that humans never change Open your eyes Let's begin Yes, it's really me It's Maui Breathe it in I know it's a lot The hair The bod When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except You're welcome For the tides, the sun, the sky Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome I'm just an ordinary demiguy Hey!

Guess it's just my way of being me You're welcome You're welcome Well come to think of it Kid, honestly I could go on and on I could explain every natural phenomenon The tide, the grass, the ground Oh that was Maui just messing around I killed an eel I buried its guts Sprouted a tree Now you got coconuts What's the lesson? What is the take away? Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin Is a map of the victories I win Look where I've been I make everything happen Look at that Mean MiniMaui just tickety tappin' Ha ha Ha ha Ha ha Hey Well anyway let me say You're welcome You're welcome For the wonderful world you know Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome You're welcome Well come to think of it !

And thank you! Hey! Let me out! You lying, slimy son of a... You're welcome You're so welcome. No. I'm not going to Te Fiti with some kid. I'm going to get my hook. You have yours and I'm not Maui without mine. Okay, talk to the back. Boat snack. Good riddance, you filthy pile of pebbles. Oh, no, no, no. Don't look at me like that. It's a beautiful cave. She's gonna love it. And I'm going to love you in ma belly. Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick. I could watch that all day. Okay. Enjoy the island. Maui, out. No! Stop! Hey! You have to put back the heart! Did not see that coming. I am Moana of Motunui. This is my canoe... and you will journey to... All right, get over it. We got to move. And she's back. I am Moana of Motunui... It was Moana, right? Yes. And you will restore the heart! All right. I'm out. Oh, come on! What is your problem? Are you afraid of it? No! No. I'm not afraid. Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit. You, stop it. That is not a heart. It is a curse. The second I took it, I got blasted outta the sky... and I lost my hook. Get it away from me. Get this away? Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay? Stop that. I will smite you! You wanna get smote? Smotten? Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life... it's a homing beacon of death. If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it. Come for this? The heart? You mean this heart right here? Don't, you can't raise your voice like that! Come and get it! You are gonna get us killed! No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti, SO you can put it back. Thank you. You're welcome. Kakamora. Kakawhat? Murdering little pirates. Wonder what they're here for. They're kinda cute. Ocean! Do something! Help us! The ocean doesn't help you, you help yourself! Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays! You can't sail?  I am selftaught. Can't you shapeshift or something? Do you see my hook? No magic hook, no magic powers! Their boat is turning into more boats! Yep, I just did that. No, no! Heihei! Maui! They took the heart! That's a chicken. The heart is in the... We have to get him back! Maui! Cheeeehoooo! There! Right there! You're turning? What are you doing? Escaping! The heart! Forget it! You'll never get it back! Besides, you got a better one. Hey! What am I gonna steer with? They're just gonna kill ya! Coconuts. Got it! Hey! Yeah! We did it! Congratulations on not being dead, girlie. You surprise me. But I'm still not taking that thing back. You wanna get to Te Fiti you got to go through a whole ocean of bad. Not to mention Te Ka. Lava monster? Ever defeat a lava monster? No. Have you? I'm not going on a suicide mission with some mortal. You can't restore the heart without me... and me says no. I'm getting my hook. End of discussion. You'd be a hero. That's what you're all about, right? Little girl, I am a hero. Maybe you were. But now... now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti. The guy who cursed the world. You're no one's hero. No one? But... put this back... save the world... you'd be everyone's hero. Maui! Maui! Maui! You're so amazing! We'd never make it without my hook. Not past Te Ka. Then we get your hook. We get your hook, take out Te Ka, restore the heart. Unless you don't wanna be... Maui, demigod of the wind and sea. Hero to... all. First, we get my hook. Then save the world. Deal? Deal. Worth a shot. Okay, we go east. To the lair of Tamatoa. If anyone has my hook, it's that beadyeyed bottomfeeder. Teach me to sail. My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean. I should... I should be sailing. It's called wayfinding, princess. And it's not just sails and knots... it's seeing where you're going in your mind. Knowing where you are... by knowing where you've been. Okay, first, I'm not a princess. I am the daughter of the chief. Same difference. No. If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick... you're a princess. You are not a wayfinder. You will never be a wayfinder, you will never be a... Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek? You are a bad person. If you can talk, you can teach. Wayfinding. Lesson one. Hit it. Pull the sheet. Not the sheet. No. Nope. Nope. No. Tried that one already. You're measuring the stars, not giving the sky a highfive. If the current's warm, you're going the right way. It's cold. Wait, it's getting warmer. Aah! That is disgusting! What is wrong with you? We're here? See, told you I could do it! Motunui? I'm home? Moana! Dad? Moana! Mom? Help! No! Moana! Enjoy your beauty rest? You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps... so they actually get where they need to go. Muscle up, buttercup. We're here. You're sure this guy's gonna have your hook? Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it. He's a scavenger. Collects stuff. Thinks it makes him look cool. Ah! And for Tamatoa, trust me... my hook is the coolest collectible. And he lives up there? No, no, no. That's just the entrance... to Lalotai. Lalotai? Realm of monsters? We're going to the realm of monsters? We? No. Me. You are gonna stay here with the other chicken. That's what I'm talking about. Gimme some. Come on. That was a good one. How do you not get it? I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat. I know she's human, but that's not the... You know what? Forget it. Forget it! I'm not explaining it to you. ""Cause then it's not funny. So, daughter of the chief... I thought you stayed in the village. You know, kissing babies and things. Hey, I'm just trying to understand... why your people decided to send... How do I phrase this? You. My people didn't send me. The ocean did. The ocean? Makes sense. You're what, eight? Can't sail. Obvious choice. It chose me for a reason. If the ocean's so smart... why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself? Or bring me my hook? The ocean's straight up kookydooks. But I'm sure it's not wrong about you. You're the Chosen One! The ocean chose you for a reason. If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up. So, not seeing an entrance. Yes, because it only appears... after a human sacrifice. Kidding. So serious. Don't worry... it's a lot farther down than it looks. Cheeeehoooo! I am still falling! You can do this. Go! And he sticks the landing. Huh? What? Dumdum, she's not even here. No mortal's gonna jump into the realm of... Huh? Well, she's dead. Okay, let's get my hook. Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew. Maui's fishhook! Yeah! Sorry! I thought you were a monster... But I found your hook. And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy really likes his treasure. Stay. What? No. I'm the one who found... Listen. For a thousand years... I've only been thinking of keeping this hair silky... getting my hook... and being awesome again. And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal... who has no business inside of a monster cave, except... Except... maybe as bait. Huh? Wow! The shiny, glittery cave. And just like me... it is covered in sparkly treasure. Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle. You're not selling it! This is stupid! I'm just gonna walk up and get it! You go up there, he will kill you. Just stick to the plan. Oh, when he shows up, keep him distracted. Make him talk about himself. He loves bragging about how great he is. You two must get along swell. No, not since I ripped off his leg. You ripped off his... Maui? What have we here? It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute. Ugh! It's a human! What are you doing down here, in the realm of the... Just pick an eye, babe. I can't concentrate on what I'm saying if you keep... Yeah, pick one, pick one! You're a funnylooking little thing, aren't you? Don't! That's my gramma's! ""That's my gramma's!"" I ate my gramma! And it took a week, 'cause she was absolutely humongous. Why are you here? ""Cause you're amazing! And we mortals have heard of the tale of the crab who became a legend! And I just had to know... how you became so... crabulous? Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself? Because if you are... I will gladly do so. Huh? In song form! Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam I was a drab little crab once Now I know I can be happy as a clam Because I'm beautiful, baby And did your granny say Listen to your heart Be who you are on the inside I need three words To tear her argument apart Your granny lied I'd rather be shiny Like a treasure From a sunken pirate wreck Scrub the deck And make it look shiny ! Will sparkle like a Wealthy woman's neck Just a sec Don't ya know Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb They chase anything that glitters Beginners Oh, and here they come, come, come To the brightest thing that glitters Mm, fish dinners ! Just love free food And you look like seafood Hey, crab cake! I'm back. It's Maui Time! What do you say, little buddy? Giant hawk? Coming up! Cheeeehoooo! Cheeeehoooo! Well, well, well. Little Maui's having trouble with his look Ya little semidemiminigod Ouch What a terrible performance Get the hook Get it? You don't swing it Like you used to, man Yet I have to give you Credit for my start And your tattoos on the outside For just like you I made myself a work of art I'll never hide I can't I'm too shiny Watch me dazzle Like a diamond in the rough  Strut my stuff My stuff is so shiny Send your armies But they'll never be enough My shell's too tough Maui, man You can try, try, try But you can't expect a demigod To beat a decapod Look it up You will die, die, die Now it's time for me to take apart Your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you Chasing the love of these humans Who made you feel wanted You tried to be tough But your armor's just not hard enough Maui Now it's time to kick your heinie Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'Cause it's the last you'll ever see C'est la vie Mon ami I'm so shiny Now I eat you so prepare your final plea Just for me You'll never be quite as shiny You wish you were nice and shiny Hey! Huh? I got something shiny for ya! The heart of Te Fiti. You can't run from me! Oh, you can. You keep surprising me. There's only so far you can get on those two little legs. The power of creation... for a crustacean. Where is it? Where is it? We got to go! What about the heart? He can have it. I've got a better one. Yes, I have the... Wait a minute. I see, she's taken a barnacle and she's covered it in... bioluminescent algae as a diversion. Come back here! Cheeeehoooo! Hey! Did you like the song? We're alive! We're alive! Listen... I appreciate what you did down there. Mmhmm. Took guts. Mmhmm. But... Mmhmm. I'm sorry. I'm trying to be sincere for once, and it feels like you're distracted. No, no. No way! Really? Because you're looking at me like I have a... shark head. What? Do you have a shark head? Look, the point is... for a little girl, child, thing, whatever... who had no business being down there... you did me a solid. But you also almost died. And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab. So, chances of beating Te Ka? Bupkis. We're never making it to Te Fiti. This mission is cursed. It's not cursed. Shark head. It is not cursed. Cursed. What can I say except We're dead soon We're dead soon Can you at least try? Giant hawk. Hey, it's okay, it's okay We're dead soon All right, break time's over. Get up. Why? Are you gonna give me a speech? Tell me I can beat Te Ka 'cause I'm ""Maui?"" Take a hike, Tiny. How do you get your tattoos? They show up. When I earn them. How'd you earn that one? What's that for? That's man's discovery of Nunya. What's Nunya? Nunya business. I'll just keep asking. What's it for? You need to stop doing that. Back off. Just tell me what it is. I said back off. Is it why your hook's not working? You don't wanna talk, don't talk. You wanna throw me off the boat... throw me off. You wanna tell me I don't know what I'm doing... I know I don't. I have no idea why the ocean chose me. You're right. But my island is dying... so I am here. It's just me and you. And I want to help... but I can't if you don't let me. I wasn't born a demigod. I had human parents. They took one look and decided... they did not want me. They threw me into the sea... like I was nothing. Somehow, I was found by the gods. They gave me the hook. They made me... Maui. And back to the humans I went. I gave them islands, fire, coconuts. Anything they could ever want. You took the heart for them. You did everything for them. So they'd love you. It was never enough. Maybe the gods found you for a reason. Maybe the ocean brought you to them... because it saw someone who was worthy of being saved. But the gods aren't the ones who make you Maui. You are. Okay, okay. I love you, too, buddy. Cheeeehoooo! Yeah! Next stop, Te Fiti. What? I figured it out. You know, the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands... ""cause your ancestors would sail her seas and find 'em. All those new lands, new villages. It was the water that connected 'em all. And if I were the ocean... I think I'd be looking for a curlyhaired nonprincess... to start that again. That is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti. I did. Moana of Motunui... I believe you have officially delivered Maui across the great sea. Moana! Moana! Moana! You're so amazing! It's time. Go save the world. Cheeeehoooo! Maui! What are you doing? Finding you a better way in! We won't make it! Yes, we will! Turn around! No! Moana, stop! No! Are you okay? Maui? I told you to turn back. I thought we could make it. We? I thought I could make it. We can fix it. It was made by the gods. You can't fix it! Next time we'll be more careful. Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands. It's lava, it can't go in the water. We can find a way around. I'm not going back. We still have to restore the heart. My hook is cracked. One more hit, and it's over. Maui, you have to restore the heart. Without my hook, I am nothing. That's not true! Without my hook, I am nothing! We are only here... because you stole the heart in the first place. No, we're here because the ocean told you you're special... and you believed it. I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my boat... Goodbye, Moana. ...sail across the sea... I'm not killing myself... SO you can prove you're something you're not! ...and restore the heart of Te Fiti! The ocean chose me! It chose wrong. Maui! Why did you bring me here? I'm not the right person. You have to choose someone else. Choose someone else. Please. No. You're a long ways past the reef. Gramma? Guess I chose the right tattoo. Gramma! I tried, Gramma. I couldn't do it. It's not your fault. I never should have put so much on your shoulders. If you are ready to go home... I will be with you. Why do you hesitate? I don't know. ! Know a girl from an island She stands apart from the crowd She loves the sea and her people She makes her whole family proud Sometimes the world seems against you The journey may leave a scar But scars can heal and reveal just Where you are The people you love will change you The things you have learned will guide you And nothing on earth can silence The quiet voice still inside you And when that voice starts to whisper Moana, you've come so far Moana, listen Do you know who you are? Who am 1? I am a girl who loves my island And the girl who loves the sea It calls me I am the daughter of the village chief We are descended from voyagers Who found their way across the world They call me I've delivered us to where we are ! Have journeyed farther I am everything I've learned and more Still it calls me And the call isn't out there at all It's inside me It's like the tide Always falling and rising ! Will carry you here in my heart You remind me That come what may ! Know the way I am Moana I am Moana of Motunui. Aboard my boat... ! Will sail across the sea... and restore the heart of Te Fiti. Te Ka can't follow us into the water. We make it past the barrier islands... we make it to Te Fiti. None of which you understand... because you are a chicken. No! Heihei! No, no, no! Nice work! Te Fiti. Maui! You came back. But your hook. One more hit and... Te Ka's got to catch me first. I got your back, Chosen One. Go save the world. Maui. Thank you. You're welcome. Cheeeehoooo! Hothothot, hothothot! Hey, Te Ka! Shark head! Cheeeehoooo! Moana! Get the heart to the spiral! Te Fiti... it's gone. Te Ka! Let her come to me. I have crossed the horizon to find you ! Know your name They have stolen the heart from inside you But this does not define you This is not who you are You know who you are Who you truly are. Te Fiti! The chicken lives. I'm sorry about your hook. Well, hook, no hook... I'm Maui. Te Fiti! Hey, I mean, how you been? Look, what I did was... wrong. I have no excuse. I'm sorry. You know, it'd be rude to refuse a gift from a goddess. Cheeeehoooo! Thank you. Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated. Cheeeehoooo. Gonna miss you, drumstick. You could come with us, you know. My people are going to need a master wayfinder. They already have one. See you out there, Maui. See you out there, Moana. Cheeeehoooo! Mom! Dad! Moana! I may have gone a little ways past the reef. It suits you. She's back! Moana! Pua! Moana! Welcome home! We set a course to find A brand new island everywhere we roam We keep our island in our mind And when it's time to find home We know the way We are explorers reading every sign We tell the stories of our elders In a neverending chain We know the way I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember Never really knowing why ! Wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water No matter how hard I try Every turn I take Every trail I track Every path I make Every road leads back To the place I know Where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea Stays behind me One day I'll know If 1 go, there's just no telling how far I'll go  ! Know everybody on this island Seems so happy on this island Everything is by design ! Know everybody on this island Has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine ! Can lead with pride I can make us strong I'll be satisfied If I play along But the voice inside Sings a different song What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea It's blinding But no one knows How deep it goes And it seems like it's calling out to me So come find me And let me know What's beyond that line Will I cross that line See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know How far I'll go ! See what's happening Yeah You're face to face with greatness and it's strange You don't even know how you feel It's adorable It's nice to see that humans never change Open your eyes Let's begin Yes, it's really me Breathe it in I know it's a lot The hair The bod When you're staring at a demigod So what can I say except You're welcome For the tides, the sun, the sky Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome I'm just an ordinary demiguy What can I say except You're welcome For the tides, the sun, the sky Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome I'm just an ordinary demiguy Honestly, I could go on and on I could explain every natural phenomenon The tide, the grass, the ground Oh, that was me, I was messing around I killed a snake I buried its guts Sprouted a tree Now you got coconuts What's the lesson? What is the take away? Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin Is a map of the victories I win Look where I've been I make everything happen Look at that Mean MiniMaui just tickety tappin' Singing and scratchin' Flipping and snappin' People are clappin', hearing me rap Bring the chorus back in Well, anyway let me say You're welcome For the wonderful world you know Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome Well, come to think of it ! Got to go Hey, it's your day to say You're welcome 'Cause I'm gonna need that boat I'm sailing away, away You're welcome 'Cause Maui's the ultimate God You're welcome You're welcome Shiny I'm so shiny Didn't help me though, did it? Still upside down here. Just need a little push. Can we be real? If my name was Sebastian and I had a cool Jamaican accent... you'd totally help me. You would. You know you would."

Scarers! That's right! Now, which one of you can give me the scariest roar? Me, me, me! Sir! Right here! Little green guy, two o'clock! No, it's like this. Hey, guys, watch this one. Hey, I got a really good... Well, hey there, kids. Are you on a tour with your school? Yeah! Yes. We're here to learn about Scream Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer. Well, hey, you're in luck, because I just happen to be a Scarer. I learned everything I know from my school, Monsters University. It's the best Scaring School there is. You wish! Fear Tech's the best. Okay. You guys watch us and tell me which school's the best. All right? MU is. Let's go, everybody! West coast coming online.  Scarers coming out.  Oops. Stop right there.

Not bad, kid. Michael, what do you have to say for yourself? How do I become a Scarer? Monsters University! Anybody getting off? Well, everyone, I don't mean to get emotional, but everything in my life has led to this moment. Let it not be just the beginning of my dream but the beginning of all of our dreams. Gladys, promise me you'll keep auditioning. Marie, Mr. Right is out there somewhere. Phil, keep using the ointment till that thing goes away. I wish you all the best. Thank you all so much! I'm welling up with tears. Now, get off. Hello. How are you doing? Stroke! Stroke! Come on, put all you have into it! Stroke! Stroke! Okay! First thing on my list, get registered.

Okay, everyone, I'm Fay, and I'll be giving you your orientation tour on this perfect day! Here are the labs where students learn to design and build the doors to the Human World. Looks like the professor is about to test a door! The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet, three meals a day. I personally believe we have some of the best chefs in the world. Yeah! Yeah! The campus offers a wide variety of majors, but the crown jewel of MU is the Scaring School. Welcome to the Debate Team. We're happy to have you. I disagree for the following reasons. True happiness is a theoretical construct... Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky at the Astronomy Club! Hey, hey, hey! Come join the Improv Club. You'll wish you were a... Never... Always... Dang it!

You know, your roommate is a Scaring major, too. ""Hello, I'm your roommate."" That's too bland. Don't force it. Just let it happen. Your lifelong best friend is right behind this door. Hey there. I'm your roomie. Name's Randy Boggs. Scaring major. Mike Wazowski, Scaring major. I can tell we're going to be best chums, Mike. Take whichever bed you want. I wanted you to have first dibs. You just disappeared. Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class, I'll be a joke. No, it's totally great. You got to use it. Really? Yeah, but lose the glasses. They give it away. Okay! Unpack. Check. Hang posters. Check. Now I just need to ace my classes, graduate with honors, and become the greatest Scarer ever. Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike. Aren't you even a little nervous? Actually, no. I've been waiting for this my whole life. I just can't wait to get started. Man! I can't be late on the first day! You got to be kidding me. I'm so nervous! Relax. It will be fine. Good morning, students. Welcome to Scaring 101. I am Professor Knight. Now I'm sure all of you were the scariest monster in your town. Well, bad news, kids. You're in my town now, and I do not scare easily. Dean Hardscrabble. This is a pleasant surprise. She's a legend. She broke the alltime Scare Record with the scream in that very can! I don't mean to interrupt. I just thought I'd drop by to see the terrifying faces joining my program. Well, I'm sure my students would love to hear a few words of inspiration. Inspiration? Very well. Scariness is the true measure of a monster. If you're not scary what kind of a monster are you? It's my job to make great students greater, not make mediocre students less mediocre. That is why at the end of the semester there will be a final exam. Fail that exam and you are out of the Scaring program. So, I should hope you're all properly inspired. All right. All right. Who can tell me the properties of an effective roar? Yes? There are actually five. Those include the roar's resonance, the duration of the roar, and the... Whoops. Sorry. I heard someone say ""roar,"" so I just kind of went for it. Excuse me, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you there. Hey, how you doing? Very impressive, Mister... Sullivan. Jimmy Sullivan. Sullivan. Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer? Yeah. He's my dad. He's a Sullivan! I should have known. I expect big things from you. Well, you won't be disappointed. I'm sorry. Should I keep going? No, no. Mr. Sullivan's covered it. Everyone take out your Scaring textbooks and open them to chapter one. Hey, bub. Can I borrow a pencil? I forgot all my stuff. All right. Yes. There we go. That will get it. Yeah. Come on, Mike. It's a fraternity and sorority party. We have to go! If we flunk that Scaring final, we are done. I'm not taking any chances. You've got the whole semester to study, but this might be our only chance to get in good with the cool kids. That's why I made these cupcakes. Oops. That could have been embarrassing. When I'm a Scarer, life will be a nonstop party. Stay out of trouble, wild man. Wild man. What the... Archie! Boo! Hey! What are you... Wait... You're shushing me? Hey! Hey! You can't... Where did he go? He's dead meat. That guy's in big trouble. Yeah, he is. Hey, guys! Over here! Fear Tech dummies. Sorry about that, buddy. Why are you in my room? Your room? This is my... This is not my room. Archie! Come here, boy. Archie? Archie the Scare Pig. He's Fear Tech's mascot. Why is it here? I stole it. Going to take it to the RORs. The what? Roar Omega Roar. The top fraternity on campus. They only accept the highly elite. Okay, I'll lift the bed, you grab the pig. Ready? One, two, three. What? No, no... What... That's it. Don't let go. Careful. He's a biter. Hey... I got him! That was awesome! What am I doing? James P. Sullivan. Mike Wazowski. Listen, it was quite delightful meeting you and whatever that is, but if you don't mind, I have to study my Scaring. You don't need to study Scaring. You just do it. Really? I think there's a little more to it than that. But, hey, thanks for stopping by. Let go of that! My hat! My pig! Hey! Come here! Hey! Catch it! Come back here! Yeah! Ride it to frat row! Tentacles and serpent's wings, they...  Hey! Go, go, go! Hey... Come on! Hey! Cupcake? Got it! Fear Tech's mascot! MU rules! MU! MU! MU! Did you see him catch that pig? You are Jaws Theta Chi material, freshman. Thanks. I don't know... No, no, no. He's an Omega Howl guy. Back off. We saw him first. No way. We did! I'll take it from here, gentlemen. Johnny Worthington, president of Roar Omega Roar. What's your name, big blue? Jimmy Sullivan. Friends call me Sulley. This guy's a Sullivan? Like the famous Sullivan? I can't believe it! That is crazy! Chet, calm down. I'm sorry. Sulley, any freshman with the guts to pull off a stunt like that has got ""Future Scarer"" written all over him. Hey, did you see me ride the pig? That took guts. Slow down, squirt. This party is for Scare students only. Sorry, killer, but you might want to hang out with someone a little more your speed. They look fun! Hey there. Want to join Oozma Kappa? We have cake. Go crazy. Is that a joke? Sulley, talk to your friend. He's not really my friend, but sure. You heard him. This is a party for Scare students. I am a Scare student. I mean for Scare students who actually, you know, have a chance. Snap! My chances are just as good as yours. You're not even in the same league with me. Just wait, hotshot. I'm going to scare circles around you this year. Okay. I'd like to see that. Don't worry. You will. Ready position. Common crouch. I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth. Basic snarl. Show me some slobber. Drool is a tool, kids. Use it. Now here is a monster who looks like a Scarer. You want a hope of passing this class, you better eat, breathe, and sleep Scaring. Yeah! Give me another one. Fear of spiders. Arachnophobia. Fear of thunder. Keraunophobia. Fear of chopsticks! Consecotaleophobia. What is this, kindergarten? Give me a hard one. Go Monsters U! You know what to do! The answer is C, fangs. Well done, Mr. Wazowski. A bowl of spiders! Correct! A clown running in the dark! Right again. Warts, boils, and moles, in that order. Outstanding! Ogre slump. Zombie snarl. Dominant silverback gorilla. That is some remarkable improvement, Michael. One frightening face does not a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan. A Tauntaun Grimace with Extra Slobber. You got it! That's what I'm saying. I am going to wipe the floor with that little knowitall. Yes, you are, big blue. Hey, wait. What are you guys... It's just a precaution. RORs are the best Scarers on campus, Sullivan. Can't have a member getting shown up by a beach ball. I am on a roll. I'm going to destroy that guy. Well, then you'll get this back right away. It's time to start delivering on that Sullivan name. Today's final will judge your ability to assess a child's fear and perform the appropriate Scare in the Scare Simulator. The Child Sensitivity Level will be raised from Bedwetter to Heavy Sleeper, so give it everything you've got. Dean Hardscrabble is with us this morning to see who will be moving on in the Scaring program and who will not. Let's get started. I am a fiveyearold girl afraid of spiders and Santa Claus. Which Scare do you use? That's a Seasonal Creep and Crawl. Demonstrate. Results will be posted outside my office. Next. Focus. Johnson, Crackle and Howl. Yes! Hey. Do you mind? Don't mind at all. Come on, Mike. Let's just move. Stay out of my way. Unlike you, I had to work hard to get into the Scare program. That's because you don't belong here. That's what I thought. I'm so sorry. It was an accident. What? This? My one souvenir from a lifetime of Scaring? Accidents happen, don't they. The important thing is no one got hurt. You're taking this remarkably well. Now, let's continue the exams. Mr. Wazowski, I'm a fiveyearold girl on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning. Which Scare do you use? Shouldn't I go up on the... Which Scare do you use? That is a Shadow Approach with a Crackle Holler. Demonstrate. Stop. Thank you. But I didn't get to... I've seen enough. I'm a sevenyearold boy... I wasn't finished. I don't need to know any of that stuff to scare. That ""stuff"" would've informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes. So a roar wouldn't make him scream, it would make him cry, alerting his parents, exposing the monster world, destroying life as we know it, and of course we can't have that. So I'm afraid I cannot recommend that you continue in the Scaring program. Good day. Wait, what? But I'm a Sullivan. Well then, I'm sure your family will be very disappointed. And, Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is something that cannot be taught. You're not scary. You will not be continuing in the Scaring program. Please. Let me try the simulator. I'll surprise you. Surprise me? I doubt that very much. Welcome back.  I hope everyone had a pleasant break.  Some say that a career as a screamcan designer is boring, unchallenging, a waste of a monster's potential. Open your textbooks to chapter three. We will now plunge into the rich history of screamcan design. Out of my way! Coming through! Sorry. Welcome to this year's Greek Scare Games kickoff.  The Scare Games! Yeah!  Okay, relax.  We have a special guest, the founder of the games,  Dean Hardscrabble.  Good afternoon.  As a student, I created these games  as a friendly competition,  but be prepared.  To take home the trophy,  you must be the most fearsome monsters on campus.  So good luck, and may the best monsters win.  All right, everybody.  We're closing down signups, so we'll see you all...  Wait! I'm signing up! What? You have to be in a fraternity to compete.  Behold the next winning fraternity of the Scare Games, the brothers, my brothers, of Oozma Kappa! Hi. Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing? You just said the winners are the most fearsome monsters on campus. If I win, it means you kicked out the best Scarer in the whole school. That won't happen. How about a little wager? If I win, you let me back in the Scaring program. And what would that prove? That you were wrong. Very well. If you win, I will let your entire team into the Scare program. But if you lose, you will leave Monsters University. Deal. Now all you need to do is find enough members to compete. We need six guys, right? Sorry, chief.  We count bodies, not heads. That dude counts as one.  Anybody else want to join our team? Anyone at all? Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late. Can I squeeze by you? Randy! Randy, thank goodness. I need you on my team. Sorry. I'm already on a team. Boggs. I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike. Don't blow this for me. Do the thing. Where did he go? Please, anybody. I need one more monster. Just one more! Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.  We have to move on. Your team doesn't qualify.  Yes, it does! The star player has just arrived. No way! Someone else! Please! Anyone else. We're shutting down signups, okay? Is he on your team or not?  Come on! Let's go! Fine! Yes, he's on my team. Good luck. All right, Wazowski, what's the plan? This is a fraternity house? Hey there, teammateys! Come on aboard! As the president of Oozma Kappa, it is my honor to welcome you to your new home. We call this room ""Party Central."" Technically, we haven't actually had a party here yet. But when we do, we'll be ready! The hot cocoa train is coming through! Next stop... You! I would like to start us off first by... So, you guys are Scaring majors? We were! None of us lasted very long. I guess we just weren't what old Hardscrabble was looking for. Don Carlton, mature student. Thirty years in the textile industry and then old dandy Don got downsized. Figured I could throw myself a pity party, or go back to school and learn the computers. Hello. I'm Terry with a ""Y""... And I'm Terri with an ""I""! I'm a dance major! And I'm not. Five, six, seven, eight! Seven, eight, turn! And... Why didn't you turn? Because we never agreed to do this! You said this was going to be cool! No one said this was gonna be cool. Now I'm embarrassed. Now you're embarrassed? Yes, because it's in front of people! You should wake up embarrassed. Hey, hey, hey! I'm Art! New Age philosophy major. Excited to live with you and laugh with you, and cry with you. Thought you might like to keep a dream journal. Guess that leaves me. My name's Scott Squibbles. My friends call me Squishy. I'm undeclared, unattached, and unwelcome pretty much everywhere but here. Now that we've all been introduced, as captain of our team... So, basically, you guys have no Scaring experience? Not a lot! But now we've got you! You're about the scariest fella I've ever seen. Even with them pink polka dots. Thanks. Actually, I think I bring the whole package. Your hands are as big as my face! He's like a mountain with fur! Come on. I don't even work out. Yeah, me neither. I don't want to get too big. We thought our dreams were over, but Mike said if we win, they're letting us in the Scaring program. We're going to be real Scarers! The best! You betcha! Yeah! Right. And here's what you've been waiting for, fellas. Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom. Great! We're sharing this room? We'll let you guys get settled. Anything you need, you just give a big holleroonie! Okay, thanks, buddy. Are you kidding me? Look, they don't need to be good. I'm going to carry the whole team. Really? And who's going to carry you? Hey, if you want to go back to can design, you know where the door is. Great. Guys? Anybody home? Hello? Fellas? Do you pledge your souls to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood? Do you swear to keep secret... ...all that you learn here? No matter how horrifying? Hey! Will you take the sacred oath of the... For crying out loud. Sweetie! Turn the lights on while you're down here! You're going to ruin your eyes! Mom! We're doing an initiation! Scary. Well, carry on. Just pretend I'm not here. This is my mom's house. Do you promise to look out for your brothers... no matter what the peril? Will you defend Oozma Kappa no matter how dangerous? No matter how insurmountable the odds may be? From evils both great and small? In the face of unending pain and... Forget it! You're in. Look, we know we're no one's first choice for a fraternity, so it means a lot to have you here with us. Can't wait to start Scaring with you, brothers. Time for a celebration! Yeah! Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen, because we're building a fort! Mom, can we stay up late tonight? I know you're a princess and I'm just a stable boy. Yuck! Mom! What are you doing? Your grubby paw was in my bed! Were you kissing my hand? No. And what about you with all your shedding? I don't shed. Really. Excuse me. I just want to get my stuff. Would you just... Hey. Come on! ...let me get my stuff! First morning in the house. That's going in the album! Guys! We got a letter! A letter? We never get mail. Sorry. It's stuck. Would you... Give me that! Tentacles. They're sticky. It's the first event of the Scare Games. ""A child's room is where you scare,"" ""but avoid the toxicity lurking there."" Wait a minute. Where do they want us to meet? Of all the sewers on campus, this one has always been my favorite. Art, you've been here before? I have a life outside of the house, you know. Welcome to your worst nightmare, the Scare Games! Scare Games! Scare Games! Yes! Yes, I love it! I love this energy! Okay. Okay, everybody. Let's hear it for the frats and sororities competing in this year's games... Jaws Theta Chi! Python Nu Kappa! Slugma Slugma Kappa! Roar Omega Roar! Eta Hiss Hiss! And finally, Oozma Kappa. Yay! Hi, Mom! Smile! Let's begin the first competition, the Toxicity Challenge! Human children are toxic! And anything they touch is toxic. We don't have any human toys, but thanks to MU's biology department, we found a close second, the stinging glow urchin! Trust me when I say, you are not gonna want to touch this bad boy! I want to touch it. And you certainly don't want to touch any of its friends. Yeah, I want to touch them. This is the starting line. The light at the end of the tunnel is the finish line. And whoever comes in last is eliminated from the games. Mike... What is it? Does that mean if we lose, we're out? Don't worry, Smoothie. Squishy! Squishy. We're not going to lose, because we have everything we need to win right here. Heart. No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us. All right, all right. That's very cute, but move, move, move. I'm going to win this. It's an obstacle course. What are you going to do? Roar at it? I can get through faster than you, little guy. Take your place at the starting line! This is all about teamwork. Everybody, stick together. I'm going to beat you over that finish line. Get ready to eat my dust. Hey, guys, should we huddle up? Attention, teams. One last thing. Scarers work in the dark. I want to go home! On your marks... Hey, good luck, ladies. Thanks! We're going to rip you to pieces! What? Get set... Go! I'm going to touch them! Come on! Guys! We're falling behind a little! Fellas! Cheese and crackers! Son of a moustache! Salisbury steak, that hurts! Is that as fast as you can go? Just getting started! What the... That's got to hurt! Terry! Don't worry, we'll be fi... Yikes! Roar Omega Roar wins! Take that, Wazowski! Are you delirious? I beat you! Get your eye checked! Way to blow it, Oozmas! Hey! Second place ain't bad. Second place, Jaws Theta Chi! What? Your whole team has to cross the finish line. Third place, EEKs! Fourth place, PNKs! No. Fifth place, HSS! No, no, no! And in last place, Oozma Kappa. I can't feel my anything. Shocker! Oozma Kappa has been eliminated! No. Don't look so surprised, Mr. Wazowski. It would have taken a miracle for you to... Attention, everyone. We have an announcement. Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified. The use of illegal protective gel is cause for elimination. What! Which means Oozma Kappa is back in the games! It's a miracle! Your luck will run out, eventually. This is going to be harder than I thought. Okay! Listen up, Oozmas. Now, we're going to have to start winning these things together, so that means I'm going to need each of you guys to pull your own weight. Mike? What is it? We've made a list of our strengths and weaknesses. In high school, I was the master of the silent scare. I could sneak up on a field mouse in a pillow factory. Sorry! They get stickier when I'm sweaty. My gosh, that's terrible. We're experts in the ancient craft of closeup magic. It's all about misdirection. I have an extra toe. Not with me, of course. Guys, one slipup on the next event, and we're goners. So for this to work, I'm gonna need you to take every instinct you have and bury it deep, deep down. Done. From now on, we are of one mind. My mind. Please. I will tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it. Okay, Mike. Seems about right. All right. Give me scary steps. Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go! You're wasting your time. We need a new team. We can't just ""get a new team""! I checked this morning. It's against the rules. What if we disguised a new team to look like the old team? No, no. We are not cheating. It's not cheating. I'm just, you know, leveling the playing field. Okay, so it's kind of cheating, but what do you want me to do? They're not exactly the scariest group in the world. A ladybug! Make a wish! Make a wish! This is not going to work. Where are you going? We're training. I'm a Sullivan. That's not enough. You're all over the place. You're charging ahead when you... Bup, bup, bup! You tell them what to do but not me. So long, Coach. Okay, Oozmas... Boy, we need to get you a bell. Listen up. ""If a kid hears you coming, they'll call Mom or Dad"", ""then you'd better run fast or things will get bad."" In the next event, if even one of us gets caught, we're all out. So remember, do exactly what I do. We are at the halfway point of the second event, and things are getting interesting. Got it. Only two teams left. Who will make it out with their flag, and who will be eliminated? In a real Scare, you do not want to get caught by a kid's parent. And in this event, you do not want to get caught by the librarian. Quiet. What's so scary about a little old librarian? I said, ""Quiet."" Faster. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Sullivan! Sullivan! Sullivan! Sullivan! No! Five, six, seven, eight! Look over here! Is that legal? You better believe it, mop top! The only rule is don't get caught. Hey! Over here! Come and get me! Come and get me! Guys, what are you doing? They said don't let her catch you. But they didn't say how! Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on! We did it! No, we didn't. We forgot the flag! Mike? Way to go, Squishy! Way to go, Squishy! How? Misdirection. The EEKs have been eliminated and Oozma Kappa live to scare another day! We're OK! We're OK! We're OK! I've never felt so alive! We were awesome! Okay, look. That wasn't real Scaring. It was better than what you did. You should've stuck to my strategy. Whatever. Talk to me when we start the real Scaring. Hey! You guys going to the party? I think you've got the wrong guys. We don't get invited to... Party? The midgames mixer at the RORs'. It's for the top Scare Teams. You're one of us now, right? See you there! Did you hear that? I can't believe it! Bad idea. This is great. They're finally seeing us as real Scarers. We're going! Do young people still dance? Because my moves are a little rusty. We forgot to bring a hostess gift. We can't go in there without some scented candles. Calm down. We earned this. What if there's a lull in the conversation? I never know what to... You know... Say? How are you so good at this? You just took on an angry 50foot librarian, and you're afraid of a little party? Take a deep breath... and in you go! Hello. It's Oozma Kappa! These guys are crazy! What you did today was insane! That was awesome! Oozma Kappa, tonight we party like Scarers! I've never stayed up this late in my life! Hey, quiet! Quiet! Quiet down, you canwranglers. All right. On behalf of the RORs, we'd like to congratulate all the teams that have made it this far. All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs! I love that trick! Never gets old. HSS! Very creepy. And finally, the surprise team of the Scare Games, Oozma Kappa! Come on over, guys. Now, I got to admit, fellas, I thought you were a bunch of nobodies. But, boy, was I wrong. Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa! Oozma Kappa! What? The most adorable monsters on campus. Release the stuffed animals. Faced! Don't worry. Nobody reads the school paper. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they read the quad. Thank you very much. Okay. Would you like that with two sleeves or four? Thanks. Tell your friends. Hey! What do you think you're doing? Raising a little money for charity. Yeah? Well, stop it. You want us to stop raising money for charity? That's not cool. This guy hates charity! I want you to stop making us look like fools. Hey, you're making yourselves look like fools. Let's be honest, boys. You're never going to be real Scarers, because real Scarers look like us. But, hey, if you really want to work for a Scare company they're always hiring in the mailroom. Guys, hold on! Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second. Don't listen to him. We just need to keep trying. No, you need to stop trying! You can train monsters like this all you want, but you can't change who they are. Mike... We appreciate everything you've done, but he's right. No matter how much we train, we'll never look like them. We're built for other things. Sorry, squirt! Some monsters just aren't cut out for the big leagues. The big leagues. Guys. We're going on a little field trip. My tentacle fell asleep. Thanks, Mom. Have fun, kids! I'll just be here listening to my tunes. Hey, where are we? The big leagues. Holy rolypoly. Nice fence. This is amazing, Mike. We're not stopping here. This is crazy. We're going to get arrested! All Scare Floors now active.  West coast coming online. Scarers coming out.  Look at them. They're going into the human world, and they don't even look scared! Take a good look, fellas. See what they all have in common? No, not really. Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer. The best Scarers use their differences to their advantage. Terri? Look. Hey! Look at that old feller racking up the big numbers! Don, that old fella is Earl ""The Terror"" Thompson! What? Where? That's really him? He held the Scare Record for three years! Third door from the end! Carla ""Killer Claws"" Benitez! Look! It's ""Screaming"" Bob Gunderson! I still have his rookie card. Me, too! Doesn't have the speed anymore, but his technique is flawless. Technique is flawless. You collected Scare Cards? 450 of them. Impressive. I have 6,000 still in mint condition, but, you know, 450 is pretty good, too. Hey, look at me! I'm Earl ""The Terror"" Thompson! That's great! That's a pretty good one, Squish. I've been a real jerk. So have I. But it's not too late. We could be a great team. We just need to start working together. Hey! What are you doing up there? I can't go back to jail! Come on! They're right behind us! Get back here! Up there! Get them! Thanks, brother! Don't mention it. I'm fine, really! It's just a little heart attack. I want a piece of that action! Mom! Start the car! What? Start the car! Stop the bar? The car! Start the car! Okay. Come on, come on, come on, come on! Get in! Get in! Mom, go! Seatbelts. Okay, go! Does anyone want gum? Just drive! Okay. Here we go! Yeah! Let's break in somewhere else! Rise and shine! Scary feet, scary feet... The kid is in the bathroom! Scary feet, scary feet... He's back! Wake up! Thirtyseven! Thirtyeight! Do I hear thirtynine? Come on! Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa, you're looking good. ""To frighten a child is the point of a Scare."" ""If you frighten a teen, then Scarer beware."" Okay, scare the little kid. Avoid the teenager! I'm on the phone! No one understands me! Whatever. But, Daddy, I love him! First place, Roar Omega Roar!  Second place, Oozma Kappa!  Third place, HSS.  You're lame. ""Someone is coming, this could ruin your night."" ""Stay hidden, take cover, and stay out of sight!"" You got 10 seconds. Go! Kiosk! Pile of leaves! Standing out in the open. And there should be one more. How did I do? Not too shabby, Don! Thanks! I cannot get down. Zombie snarl! Angry poodle. Jazz clown. My Aunt Phyllis. In the morning. That's what I'm talking about! Time to go to work. You're out! You're out. Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle. Thank you. Yeah! Yeah! We're down to two remaining teams,  Roar Omega Roar and Oozma Kappa!  Which leads us to the final event! ""Every one of your skills will be put to the test."" ""The Scare Simulator will prove who's the best!"" Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare in front of the whole school! Enjoy the attention while it lasts, boys. After you lose, no one will remember you. Maybe. But when you lose, no one will let you forget it. Boy. That is a good point. Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome! You've got to teach us your moves. Well, then you're gonna want to talk to this guy. Sure, I can teach you. All right. You want to hide behind the chair? You have to become the chair. Thanks for coming, Dean. Dean Hardscrabble! If we get back into the Scaring program, I hope there's no hard feelings. Tomorrow, each of you must prove that you are undeniably scary. And I know for a fact that one of you is not. No. He works harder than anyone. Do you think he's scary? He's the heart and soul of the team! Do you think he's scary? We're going to win this thing tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it! We'll finally have our lives back on track. Hey, Mike? You know, you've given me a lot of really great tips. I'd love to return the favor sometime. Yeah, sure. Anytime. We're doing this now? Okay. You've memorized every textbook, every Scare Theory, and that is great. Hey! But now it's time to forget all that. Just reach deep down and let the scary out! Just feel it. Exactly. Go wild. I don't know. I've kind of got my own technique. Give it a try. Good, but bigger! Nope. You're thinking again. From the gut! Let the animal out! Come on! Dig deep! Boys! It's a school night! So, how was that? Up top. You know, it did feel different! I feel like it's all coming together. Yup, this time tomorrow the whole school is finally going to see what Mike Wazowski can do. You're darn right. Monsters University  We give our heart to you  Wherever children are dreaming  We'll bring them nightmares, too  Monsters University  Alma Mater hail to you  Welcome to the final competition  of the Scare Games.  Yeah! All right! It's time to see how terrifying  you really are,  in the Scare Simulators!  But be warned.  Each simulated Scare has been set  to the highest difficulty level.  The highest level? First Scarers to the starting line.  Okay, just like we planned. I'll go first. Then, Don... Hold on. Mike's the one who started all this and I think it's only right if he's the one who finishes it. I think you should go last. Yes! Yeah, Mike. Finish strong! All right. Don, you okay going first? I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Oozma Kappa! Go Oozmas! I'm gonna do it. I'm going to beat this guy. Hey, Bruiser! You take it easy on grandpa. Unleash the beast, Don! Okay, then. Thanks for taking it easy on grandpa. Next group to the starting line.  Let's do this. Yes! Yeah! Come on, Art. Come on, buddy. You can do it. Yes! Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!  You got this, Sull. And it's all tied up!  Tough break for the RORs.  Hearts? Way to go, Boggs! Yay! That's the last time I lose to you, Sullivan. Worthington and Wazowski, to the starting line.  Hey. Don't worry about Hardscrabble. Don't worry about anyone else. Just go out there and show them what Mike Wazowski can do. Thanks. Don't take the loss too hard. You never belonged here anyway. Amazing performance by Worthington!  Johnny, you're my hero! ROR! ROR! The Oozmas will need a recordbreaking  Scare to win this.  You don't belong on a Scare Floor.  No one will remember you.  You're not scary.  Come on! Dig deep!  Yeah! They did it!  Yeah! Hey! We're in the Scare program! Yeah! Come here, you son of a gun! Way to go! Yeah! A little stuck. Pardon me there, Ms. Squibbles. It's Sherrie. We did it! Way to go, Oozma Kappa! Thank you! Thanks a lot. You rule! I have never ruled before. You guys killed it out there! Awesome! Hey, Wazowski! Come on, let's go, you maniac! We're celebrating. Mike? I did it. I can't believe it. I'm going to be a Scarer! Yeah, yes, you are. You hear that? Get plenty of rest, kiddo. You haven't seen the last of Mike Wazowski. Boo! I knew I was scary. I didn't know I was that scary. Yeah, we're so scary I guess we broke it. Come on. It's been tampered with. I don't think you should be messing with that. Why are my settings different? Mike, we should leave. Did you do this? Mike. Did you do this? I... Yes, I did. But you don't understand. Why? Why did you do this? You know, just in case. In case of what? You don't think I'm scary. Mike... You said you believed in me. But you're just like Hardscrabble. You're just like everyone else! Look, you'll get better and better... I'm as scary as you! I'm as scary as anyone! I just wanted to help. No. You just wanted to help yourself. Well, what was I supposed to do? Let the whole team fail because you don't have it? So your calculations were a little off. That door took me all semester. It's too dangerous. The professor's just going to shred it. There he is, the big guy. The first of many trophies, I am sure. Sullivan. Nice work out there. I look forward to having you back in class. Hey, there he is! Looks like I was wrong about you. You're one of us after all. Way to go, Sulley! Welcome back, broham! You are one of us now, okay? Anytime you want to come hang out and do whatever, you got a crew. You're a ROR, buddy! Hey! Where are you going? You did what? My team had nothing to do with it. It was all me. I cheated. I expect you off campus by tomorrow. Yes, ma'am. You're a disgrace to this university and your family name. What's going on? Someone broke into the door lab! What? No. Open the door! Don't go in there! You look funny. What? I'm so tired. What's going on? It's the middle of the night. A little funny green guy. I want to touch it! It's so cute! James! No one goes near that door until the authorities arrive. You don't think that could be... It's Mike. But he could die out there! James, wait! We can help. Leave it to the old master of sales. We got a call in, but that's the best we can do. Ahem! Don Carlton, sales. Folks, today is your lucky day. How many times have you asked yourself the following question... Arrest him. Pardon? Spread them, pops! Do you mind? Don't move! What? Sullivan! Don't you dare! Sullivan! Don't go in there! Mike? Mike! The kids said they saw something in the cabin. They're calling it an alien. It was! I saw a little green guy! What's the problem, ma'am? Mike? Bear! A bear in the camp! Down this way. All right? I heard something over here! Mike! Come on, buddy. Let's get you out of here. This is all my fault. I'm sorry. You were right. They weren't scared of me. I did everything right. I wanted it more than anyone. And I thought... I thought if I wanted it enough, I could show everybody that... That Mike Wazowski is something special. And I'm just not. Look, Mike, I know how you feel. Don't do that! Please, don't do that! You do not know how I feel. Mike, calm down. Monsters like you have everything. You don't have to be good. You can mess up over and over again and the whole world loves you. Mike... You'll never know what it's like to fail because you were born a Sullivan! Yeah, I'm a Sullivan. I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test. The one who got kicked out of the program, the one who was so afraid to let everyone down that I cheated. And I lied. Mike, I'll never know how you feel, but you're not the only failure here. I act scary, Mike, but most of the time I'm terrified. How come you never told me that before? Because we weren't friends before. Check the lake! I heard something here! This way! I saw movement! Over there! Sulley! He's cornered! No! They're still in there! Until the authorities arrive, this door stays off! No! You can't do that! No! Enough! I want this room cleared now! You can't do this! We got to get out of here! Let them come. What? If we scare them, I mean really scare them, we could generate enough scream to power the door from this side! What are you talking about? I have read every book about Scaring ever written. This could work! They're adults. I can't do this. Yes, you can. Just follow my lead. Mama!  Mama!  Mama...  What the... Now what? Phase two. Keep together. Are you ready? Mike, I can't. Yes, you can. Stop being a Sullivan and start being you. Call for backup. Assistance on the north side. Repeat, we need assistance on the north side. Ranger, answer me, what's your 20?  We need assistance on the north side. We have a... Look! What was it? Let's go. Sulley, come on! How? How did you do this? Don't ask me. Move, move, move! This is a 5423 in progress. All right, everybody, clear out. Secure the perimeter. No child breach. No child breach. You ruined our doors! I've been working on my door all semester! Let's go, you two. You're alive! We are so glad you're safe. Hey, wait! What's going to happen to them? That's for the university president to decide. But you can be sure we'll be watching these two. Always watching. Expelled? Yeah, we really messed up. So, you're leaving? Yeah, buddy. We have to go. Harsh, man. I'm sorry, guys. You'd be in the Scaring program right now if it wasn't for us. What? Well, it is the goshdarnedest thing. Hardscrabble's letting us into the Scare program. What? She was impressed with our performance in the games. She invited us to join next semester! Congratulations, guys! And that's not the only piece of good news. Sherrie and I are engaged! Who is Sherrie? She's my mom. Well, if it isn't my two favorite fellas! Come here. Give me some sugar. So uncomfortable. Come on, Scott. I don't want you to think of me as your new dad. After all, we're fraternity brothers first. This is so weird. Just think of me as your big brother that's marrying your mother. Wait. Hold on. We're brothers who share the same mom slash wife. That's worse. Well, I guess we should be going now. Promise me you'll keep in touch. You're the scariest bunch of monsters I have ever met. Don't let anyone tell you different. So, what now? You know, for the first time in my life, I don't really have a plan. You're the great Mike Wazowski. You'll come up with something. I think it's time I leave the greatness to other monsters. I'm okay just being okay. So long, Sull. So long. Wazowski! Stop the bus! Are you crazy? Mike, I don't know a single Scarer who can do what you do. I know, everyone sees us together, they think I'm the one running the show, but the truth is, I've been riding your coattails since day one! You made the deal with Hardscrabble. You took a hopeless team and made them champions. All I did was catch a pig! Technically, I caught the pig. Exactly! And you think you're just okay? You pulled off the biggest Scare this school has ever seen! That wasn't me! That was you! You think I could have done that without you? I didn't even bring a pencil on the first day of school. Mike, you're not scary. Not even a little. But you are fearless. And if Hardscrabble can't see that, then she can just... I can just what? Careful, Mr. Sullivan. I was just warming up to you. Sorry. Well, gentlemen, it seems you made the front page again. The two of you did something together that no one has ever done before. You surprised me. Perhaps I should keep an eye out for more surprises like you in my program. But as far as the two of you are concerned there is nothing I can do for you now. Except, perhaps, wish you luck. And, Mr. Wazowski, keep surprising people. You know, there is still one way we can work at a Scare company. They're always hiring in the mailroom. This is better than I ever imagined! I bet we break the alltime record in our first year. Mike, we're mail guys. I know. I'm talking about the record for letters delivered! All right, newbies, quit goofing around. I'll have you know tampering with the mail is a crime punishable by banishment! Yes, sir. We're right on it, Mr. Snowman. The team of Wazowski and Sullivan are going to change the world starting today! Say scream! Scream! Scream! Wazowski, good luck on your first day! Thanks, Merv. Good luck, Mike! Thanks, fellas. You coming, Coach? You better believe it. I made it! My first day of class! The school year's over, son. You missed it. Great."
Planes Fire and Rescue,Disney,2010,2014,Animation,"Look at them go! Into the final lap. And here comes number seven... Dusty Crophopper! And Dusty wins the gold! Go, Duster! Dusty, you were just a smalltown crop duster who overcame impossible odds to win the Wings Around the Globe Rally. And now, you're an air racing legend. Well, Brent, I've had an amazing team supporting me every step of the way. The best coach, the best mechanic... and the best fuel truck that anyone could ask for. Hey, wait a minute. You're a gas consultant. That's correct. I've got gas.   Awesome pic, Dust, except your eyes are closed. Racing with your eyes closed, huh? So, that's your secret. Oh, yeah, you figured it out, Chug. That was some pretty fancy flying, Dusty. Saw it all on my radio with pictures. Um, you mean your TV. No, no. That's clearing up. My bumper was nearly corroded right through. All right. Disgusting looking. Ah, yeah, it was all rusty and blistered. I got it. Anyway, what else is going on? Dottie gave me some of that Rusteze Medicated Bumper Ointment.  Ah! How's it look now? Looks great. Fine. Take a closer look. That's close enough. Oh. What was that? Didn't need to see that. Oh, hey, hey, guys, guys. Listen to this. ""After his Red Bulldozer win, Dusty Crophopper..."" That's you. ""... returns to Propwash Junction..."" That's here. ""...where he will be performing ""at their annual Corn Festival."" They mentioned the Corn Festival? Oh, it's national news! Seriously? That's great. Yeah. The phone's been ringing off the hook here at the motel. Gonna have to get out the inflatable hangars. Oh, yeah, everybody wants to see you, Dusty. It's gonna be the biggest Corn Fest yet. Dusty. Ready to do some flying? Absolutely, Skipper. Don't stay out too late. Later, Dust. Remember to open your eyes.  Hey, Propwash Tower, this is Crophopper Seven. Flight of two, ready for takeoff. Crophopper Seven, Propwash Tower. Wind's calm. Runway twoseven clear for takeoff. Have a great flight, fellas. Crophopper Seven flight, on the roll. Snap into those turns. Tighten it up. There you go. Now let's work that vertical!    Dusty! Dusty, are you okay? My engine. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, steady, there. Propwash Tower, this is Jolly Wrench Seven. We're a flight of two, five miles north of the airport... inbound for a precautionary landing. Roger. Proceed direct to the numbers. Wind twoseven zero at five. Runway twoseven clear to land. I don't know what it was. I wasn't doing anything different. Pylon turns, a vertical, like we do every day.  I feel great now, but... I got a lovehate relationship with you, Dusty. Love that you're my best customer, hate what you're doing to yourself. Come on, Dot. You saw me at the Red Bulldozer race. I kicked Aston Martin out there! You're not even listening to what I'm saying. And hey, Speed City Airfest is just a few weeks away. And I think, if I get a little more speed coming out of my turns, really work that radialG, I can definitely improve my time. Yeah, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling good about my next race. Well, no damage to the casing or compressor blades. See? I told you. Just a hiccup. But there is... Dusty! Dusty! What happened? Are you okay, Dust? It's okay. Was it your fuel? I tested it this morning. I always take a little sip. Gets me going. It's okay. I got quite a little scare there. But Dottie here... Dusty! And it's all good news, gave me the allclear. Your reduction gearbox is failing. My gearbox? Your chip detector had a cluster of steel shavings on it. Flakes from the gears. That's what caused the trouble. Well, you could just replace it. Order a new one from AG Parts. It'll be here by the end of the week.  Right? What? Your gearbox... It's...  It's out of production. Long since discontinued. Can't even remember the last time I saw one. But, Dottie... Come on, can't you just build Dust a new one? No. It's too complex. It has to be factory. Well, I mean, there has... From now on, you have to back off the torque. Keep it under 80 percent. What? 80 percent? Dottie, you've got me cranked up to 140. I need that to race. If you push yourself into the red, your gearbox will fail. No, Dottie! And then your engine will seize. Maybe the test that you did was wrong! Dusty, listen! But I've got a race coming up! You'll crash! You push yourself into the red, you'll crash. Look, I'm gonna install a warning light on your panel. A warning light? If it comes on, you'll need to pull power. Slow down. But, Dottie... You're saying... I can't race anymore. I'm so sorry. I was making my descent To the old ""BNA"" At gate number three Concourse A Can you believe it? She left me for a hybrid. I didn't even hear him coming. And there I saw a widebody jet Make me pitch and yaw My runway romance At gate number three All right, boys, I got three Crudeweisers, and who ordered the Spruce Goose? What? It's tangy. Hey, sugar rims, you just fall out of a B17? 'Cause you're da bomb. Pickup trucks. Mmmhmm. Dottie's an excellent mechanic. You know as well as I, she wouldn't have said what she said unless she was sure. Hey, Dusty! Dusty! Hey, Dusty! Dusty, hey! There he is. Dust, listen, we just got off the radio with Ethan up in Grand Flaps. Old ""Grand Flaps Ethan."" He's got the gearbox?  No. But his buddy owns 21 service hangars. Twentyone of them, and he's gonna check his inventory, and he's gonna put the word out for you, Duster. It's a good start, right? Oh, yeah! It's a great start! Can you believe it? Because if that gearbox is out there, we're gonna find it for you, buddy. And, hey, if you don't, it's all right. Because the answer is ""Yes."" ""Yes?"" What? Yes? Huh? Yes, of course you can have your old job back. Don't even have to bother asking. That's just the kind of guy I am. Leadbottom, I'm sure Dusty appreciates your offer... Of course, you got to start back at minimum wage, and you lost all your vacation time, gotta go through orientation again. Leadbottom, please! Once you acquire the taste for Vitaminamulch, you can't live without it. It's like Mama's jalapeno chili. Spicy. Twice! It's just that now is not the best time. Come on, Skipper. I can get his old sprayer back from that Germany place. Have it cleaned up and bolted back on him in no time. I'll tell you what, let me buy you a can of oil. I'll tell you what, Dusty is the best duster I've ever known. And I'm telling you that Dusty don't crop dust no more. That's right, no more! He's a racer. A racer! He's gonna be back to racing in no time. In no time! Right, Dusty? Right, Dust? Dust?  Agh! Argh! Uh!  Ugh!  Fire. Fire! Somebody get some help! The Fill 'n Fly! I'll go get Mayday. I'll hit the shutoff valve.  Oh, I'm on it!   Had to get my glasses.  Now, listen up! We gotta cool this down before it spreads. Oh, yeah! Uh?  Whoa! I got you. Thanks. Now what? I'm gonna need some help.  Now, pull! Pull!     ""TMST""? ""This Means Serious Trouble."" ""Transportation Management Safety Team."" Mr. Mayday, were you at the specified point of attack, and applying an extinguishing agent within three minutes from the time of alarm? Well, I... I didn't have time to look at a clock.  Is that guy writing down everything I say? Yes. Well, I... So he just wrote that down? Yes. And that? Yes. Oh. Can you provide me with your selfinspection records and emergency procedure plans? Oh, look, now, we don't have many emergencies around here. Besides, we did get the fire out. Is that your contingency plan, Mr. Mayday? Every time there's an incident, you topple a water tower? This was my fault. Hmm? I clipped the tower. I flew out last night because I...  Dusty. It was an accident.  It's clear this airport has no plans for an emergency, and equipment from last century. So, unless Mr. Mayday gets refurbished, and acquires a second firefighting vehicle in accordance with CFR title 14, volume three, chapter one, section 139, subparagraph B, I am pulling this airport's certificate of operation for noncompliance of rescue and firefighting regulations. Oh, Chevy. Propwash Junction just got shut down? With no active runway, how can anybody land? They can't. That's the problem. There goes the Corn Festival. But I already finished my corncob costume. Now, everybody, calm down. Calm down? Calm down. Calm down? Motel's booked. This Corn Festival is what butters my corn. Brodi, we've already figured this out. Dottie, show them. This is Mayday now. I did the drawings. We add a new 400watt siren, a 2,000 GPM roof turret, a highcapacity water tank with integrated class A foam cell, and we'll have an allnew Mayday. Get out! He gets rocket boosters? That's right. Fuelled by good old hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Of course, remember, that stuff is highly explosive, so you'll want to keep it away from any open flames. But he's a fire truck. Exactly. Go on, Dottie. So, for Mayday to keep his job and get Propwash reopened, we just need to find a second firefighter. What? At this time of year? It's fire season. How much is another firefighter gonna cost? I'll tell you how much. Too much! If we hire one, we might as well hire two. Oh, for crying out loud. Gee, this tarmac is getting awful hot. Knock, knock. Oh. Hey, Dusty. I just... Hmm. I wish there was, uh... You know, I wish there was something I could do. Oh, there's nothing. It's all right. I'm old, Dusty. Looks like my firefighting days are over. Uh, no. No, Mayday. Look, there's still plenty of firefight left in you. Look at... I mean, right here, ""Firefighter of the Year."" Huh, 1968. Okay. Your Bronze Star. Old and tarnished. Like me. Oh. Is this you and an old crop duster? Hmm? This one, right here. Oh, yeah. Mendocino, 1956. Oh, '55, '55. Yeah, I was there. Yeah, I was there. I got to witness one of the very first aerial firefighters. Oh. Nowadays known as a ""SEAT."" A ""SEAT""? Yeah. A ""Single Engine Air Tanker."" Huh. You see, instead of dusting crops, you know, like you used to do, they drop water. Wow. Yeah. Uh, Mayday? Mmmhmm? What if I became our second firefighter? You? Yeah. Dottie will fix you up, and I'll get certified. What about your racing? Look. Right now, we need to get Propwash reopened. Me... And you. I don't know what to say. Thanks, Dusty. One, two, three, lil' jonjon, and five. Okay, that's it. That's the morning rush. Highway's all clear, Duster. Now, when you get to Piston Peak Air Attack, you're gonna ask for Blade Ranger. Blade Ranger. You got it. Yeah. He's their Chief of Fire and Rescue. He's an old friend of mine. He can train and certify you. Consider it done, Mayday. And, Dusty, be careful. I will. Good luck, Dusty! Take it easy out there! You can do it, Dusty. We're proud of you, pal! Good luck! There's a time In your life When the world ls on your side You might not feel it You might not see it But it surrounds you like a light Makes you stronger for the fight Never letting go Gotta learn to grow Watch me as I touch the sky Still I fly Now I know it's what I gotta do Find a dream that's new Give it all I got this time Still I fly Oh, Harvey, it's just like I remember. Winnie, how many pairs of tires did you pack? Harvey, you spoiled it. Now you spoiled the moment. Breathe it in I'm gonna shine It's my moment Gotta live it, live it right I'm flying Flying so strong Hello! Welcome, guests, to the grand reopening weekend of the magnificent Fusel Lodge! Ah, we're gonna wipe off those muddy tires, aren't we? Yes, we are. Oh! Good heavens! Look who we have here! Never letting go Gotta learn to grow Watch me as I touch the sky Oh still I fly Still I fly      Argh! Stick shift!   Ripping! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drip, what the heck is the matter with you? You nearly took off the guy's canopy! But Blackout said it was okay to go, dude. I did? He did? Yeah, he was like, ""He's okay to go, dude."" Hmm. Uh, I'm sorry. I know you're busy, but I am looking for Piston Peak Air Attack. You are there! Copy that, jefe.  Serving beautiful VeeSix Valley since 1958. You must be the SEAT. Hmm. We heard you were coming. I'm Dynamite. This is Blackout, Pinecone, Avalanche... Hello! ...and Evel Kenumbskull over there is Drip. Did you guys see that? Hey, guys, what's up? I'm Dusty Crophopper. Dusty Crophopper? Dusty Crophopper! Go, go, go, go, go! The air racer? Uh, hi. Shut the hangar door! I'm your biggest fan! I have seen every single one of your races on RSN. Wow! You're smaller than I thought, but that's okay. Um, thanks. So, what is a worldfamous racing superstar doing here? Um... Um, well... I'm here because I'm between races right now, so I'm helping out some friends... Oh, that's so sweet! Back home. I'm Dipper. That's what everyone calls me, so you can, too. Okay, Mrs... ""Miss."" Miss. Miss, yeah. Dipper. Yep. Dipper. Yep. Rarr!  It was great to meet you.  I'm looking for Blade Ranger. He's out scouting for spot fires. He should be back in a few. Thanks. The one the Lakota call Haokah beats his drum with the wind to make thunder. With thunder comes lightning, and with lightning comes fire. Okay. Yeah, very nice. Windlifter, stop scaring our guest. I don't hear any drums. Kilawu. All aircraft, we've got a report of a wildfire. Come on, boys, let's load up! Patch, drop the needle! It's an actual fire? Yeah. It happens all the time. You guys only hear about the big ones. Fire is due to an unattended campfire. Location, 10 clicks northwest, heading twoninerseven. Slow rate of spread. Ten acres with a northerly wind on it.  I gotta see this. Thar she burns, fellas! Whoa! All right, mud droppers, watch your altitude. Too low, and you'll spread the embers. Dipper, set up for a drop and vee the head of the fire. Copy that. I'm away. Windlifter, you're clear to maneuver. Windlifter copies. All right, Cabbie... Let's get some wheels on the ground. Jumpers, South Meadow looks clear. Should put you approximately 100 yards below the fire. Looks good, Cabbie. Let's ride the silk elevator, boys. I will never understand why you gravel crunchers want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. We're not. We're jumping out of you!  Ha! Everyone's down. We're good. Cabbie copies. Be careful out there. Dynamite, use that creek bed as a natural barrier to create a firebreak. All right, jumpers, let's anchor into the bed and start building a line. Awesome! Who the... Get out of this air space! Oh, sorry. Sorry!  Ohoh.  Ah. That ought to do it. Well, back to work. I gotta mix up a fresh batch of retardant. Once you dry out, you can wing it on back to the lodge with the rest of the tourists. I'm not a tourist. Actually, I'm the guy that May... He's the trainee. You're the SEAT Mayday radioed about? Oh, for the love of... Come on, Blade. He's not just some SEAT. No, no, no. Seriously. It's Dusty Crophopper, the champion air racer. ""Champion."" Don't be shy. Come on! Tell him! No big deal. He raced all the way around the world!  I did. I did do that. The world wasn't on fire though, was it? Was the whole world on fire? No. Hmm. Maru! What? Rip off his landing gear. Wait, what?   Muskrat, muskrat candlelight It feels pretty weird without the tip tanks. Tip tanks?  You couldn't exactly go flying into fire with fuel tanks on your wings. Kaboom! Nope. You're gonna need these pontoons. They may be old... Old? But they'll let you scoop water right off the lake. You're goofing on me. Do you have any new ones? New?  We don't even know what that word means around here. I rebuilt these babies myself. They're better than new. Give them a go. Huh? All right. Let me just get this...  Pop the wheels, genius. The whee... Yeah. Pop the wheels. Oh. That's it. Yeah, you think? Yeah, I'm tall. Look at this.  Hey, you guys have a wall of fame just like the Jolly Wrenches. So, what's the deal? What do you have to do to get your picture up here? Crash. Oh. Yeah, it's dangerous work, but that's the job of a firefighter. Risking their lives for people they don't even know. They fly in when others are flying out. It takes a special kind of plane. Fighting wildfire means flying low. And that's why we have Augerin Canyon, our own little obstacle course. All you gotta do is stay below the rim, and when you get to the bridge, fly under and pull out. Flying low. No problem. Overconfidence, the kind of attitude that can get you killed. Okay, now, let's see you make it under that bridge. Why did you pull power? You gotta firewall it. The bridge, it's too close to the falls. No excuses. If there had been a downdraft, you'd be dead. Make a normal seaplane approach. Stay on the step while collecting water through the scoops. Just like that. Climb out loaded, return to your holding orbit, and drop as directed. Copy that? Copy that. Okay, you've got 12 to 15 seconds to scoop... Then 50 feet to climb out. And watch out for the tree! Indirect attack, parallel attack, direct attack. Know what your fire is doing at all times. Wind speed and direction. Temperature, relative humidity. And finally, all aircraft must be on the ground 30 minutes after sunset. Flying low at night is the fastest way to get your picture on the wall. Too early. Too high! Too low. Those crops of yours, they die a lot? Approach looks good. Now, increase your air speed. Redline it. Go to max torque. Don't back off.  Don't back off! Oh, why did you bail out again? If you don't push it, you're not gonna make it and you won't be certified. Good job! You just saved those folks from a nice vacation. Propwash Junction to Dusty. Come in, Dusty. Propwash Junction to Dusty. Hey, Skipper. Hey! How's it going? This is tougher than I thought, but it is so good to hear from you. Well, we wanted to radio... Skip, let me tell him. Oh, all right, Chug. Tell me what? Okay. That we...  Oh, I can't! You tell him, Sparky. Uh, well. So, okay, there's this fella out in California. California! The Skipper and I know him from back when we were stationed in Coronado. Near San Diego! We all used to go down to Baja. Near Coronado! Oh, boy, there was this one time we went to this bar, and Skipper put a hula skirt and coconuts on his... Sparky! Right, okay. Sorry. Sorry. The point is, he has one of your... Gearboxes! We got the gearbox! You got the... You got the... Are you kidding me? Oh, wait. It gets better. He's going to ship it out tonight. We'll have it in a couple of days! This is the best news. This is just what I needed to hear right now. We'll let you know as soon as we get it. Hey, Dusty! Listen to my new siren.   Huh? Yeah, I haven't actually hooked up his siren yet. All aircraft, be advised... Something's up. I gotta go, guys. I repeat, Superintendent Spinner has entered the base. What's going on? Park superintendent. He waxes himself... daily.  Honk, honk! Beepbeep! Park superintendent coming. I sign your paychecks. Anybody gonna greet me? Yes, you are! I got some oil pans to change. Blade, Blade, Blade. What do you want, Cad? That's a big hill. Listen. Do you think I like driving all around over here and up there, over there just to complain? Answer... No, I don't. But, I heard from some campers that one of your staff just soaked them with that red fire phosphorescent stuff that you use. The deodorant. Yeah, I'm sorry. That was my fault. The team needs to train. There's gonna be some mud spilled along the way. Are you kidding me? No, that's the way it works. No, you are not! Blade, you're hiding a world famous racer right here at Piston Peak! Ripslinger! Uh, it's ""Crophopper."" Crophopper! Dusty. Yeah, right. Me, Cad Spinner. You, one fast plane. What are you doing up here? Well, I'm getting... Doesn't matter. Tomorrow night. The lodge. Grand reopening party. You're invited! And I'm thinking, highspeed flyover. What are you thinking? I'm thinking it'll be... It'll be dark. Hey! There's gonna be a lot of VIPs. ""Very Important Planes."" How would you like to rub tires with the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America? I smell photo op! Flash! Chaching. I smell something else. Blade, Blade, Blade. Can I explain something? Yes, I can. Look, spilling mud on people makes for sad campers. Big party at my lodge makes for happy campers. You understand? You've packed too many happy campers into the park and way too many into that lodge. Oh, we've got a structural fire engine down there protecting it. This isn't just about protecting the lodge. There's low humidity... He got the Park Service to shift 80 percent of our budget to his lodge restoration project. This base is held together with baling wire and duct tape! Maru had to rebuild that old tower himself. It's better than new! Hear me, fellow forest friends, dirty though you may be. This is an historic weekend.  Cad, you got 30 seconds. Go. Ah, I don't care how much it costs. Yes, get the crystal glasses. Yes, fluted! Were you built in a barn? Come on! The lodge is only gonna be grandreopened once. I'm not gonna... Could you hold on a second? Then fire the old lady, and get somebody who can get them! You're not the only ones who can put out a fire, right?  Will I see you at the party? Yes, I will.  Superstar! Can you believe it? Dusty Cropslinger! He's even more famous than you, Blazin' Blade.  ""Blazin' Blade?"" Shh! What? Shh. What, me, shush? Shh! I just said ""Blazin' Blade."" Kilawu! What? Tonight. Main hangar. Tell no one. Especially Blade.   Password. Password? You didn't tell me... Shh!  You didn't tell me a password. It's ""Inferno."" Okay. Oh. Inferno. Glad you could make it. You like ""Inferno""? It was either that, or ""Maelstrom,"" but that was so Nordic. Park it over here, Dust Storm. Our first date, and I saved you a spot. Yeah. They're real. ""Howard The Truck""? You invited me here to watch... Dude, dude, dude. Judge not a video by its cover. I'm Larry H. Parkinglot, and I'll fight for you!  Hold on. Blade was a TV star? 139 episodes of lawbreaking love. Quiet! Good move, partner. Man, why you choppies always spoiling my fun? Hey, you think it's fun running station wagons off the road, you punk? If I had a nickel for every crook like you... Hey, hey, hey! He ain't worth it, Nick. All units, we have a code 904S. Structural fire downtown at Studio 4x4. L.A. SevenMaryFour, this is Officer Nick Lopez. We're on it!  Help! Help! Hoist! Are you all right, miss? Hey, baby. Ooh, I am now. Hmm. As much as it pains me to say this, you two jokers... You did a good job. Nice catch today, Blade. Speaking of which, she's got a sister. Hi. Good move, partner. Dudes, let's watch episode 38, ""Super Copter""! ""Super Copter""? This show stinks. What are you talking about? This show is the best. I'm with Cabbie. Guys? Hey, guys? Quiet! Thanks. I just don't get something. If Blade was such a big TV star, what is he doing here? I don't know. We don't know! It's a mysterious mystery. It's like my fiance. He just vanished. Poof! From my experience, this kind of stuff is classified. Black ops! I heard he went cuckoo on the set. You know, probably top secret. CIA! I'm sure he could tell us. Yes! But he'd have to kill us. I don't want to die! Whatever the reason is, it's his business, and we're not asking. All aircraft and jumpers, lightning storm came through. We've got multiple starts north of Skyline Drive, east of Coil Springs. Lightning storm started a whole slew of spot fires and they've merged. This is a big one. Winds are out of the southwest with a moderate rate of spread. Rapid. Wait. We have an update. Rapid rate of spread. Dipper, you and Windlifter load up. Champ, wait in the hangar. What? Blade, Dusty's been practicing so hard. This ain't no campfire. Come on, I can do this. You're not certified. Just give him a shot. He's not certified! We need every plane we've got. I want to help. Maru! Yeah, Blade? Load him up. Okay! What was that for? The wall. Dipper, move into position. Split load. Coverage level eight. Dipper copies. Come left one wingspan on your next drop. Champ, tag on and extend. Split load. Copy that. Too high! It all dispersed. Windlifter, finish off that ridge. Windlifter copies. Pull back! Pull back! Let's go, let's go right now! Blade, we got a situation. The wind shifted. The fire jumped the line. Can you make it to your safety zone? No, no good. Our escape route is blocked. We need a drop. Copy that. Dipper, smokejumpers trapped. Left flank, set up for a drop. I see them. I've got it. All right. We're clear. Let's move. Let's get to the lake. That's my Dust Muffin! Champ, load and return. We still got a lot of work to do. Copy that. Dynamite just reported in. They're gonna camp out tonight and mop it up tomorrow. Cabbie, how's it looking? We got that sucker boxed in. Nice work! That's why we're here. So, that's it? Yep, fire is contained. The jumpers will stir on it until it's out. You did a great job out there, sweet SEAT. Thanks. I saw the jumpers in trouble... You broke formation in a crowded airspace. Could've been you spread all over the woods instead of retardant. Don't go planning your certification party yet, Champ. Oh, man. Come on, that's just Blade's way of saying ""Good job."" Whoa. That was low. Cad's VIPs. Oh, yeah, that's right. He's having a big party up at the lodge tonight. We should go! A second date? Wow! Room! Uh, I kind of meant all of us. You know, you and me, and Windlifter, and just everybody. Oh! Okay. Okay, okay, yeah. Mmmhmm. You're right, you're right. I should get to know your friends. But they're your friends. Well, yeah, I guess. Yeah. Let's not bicker.  Welcome to the Fusel Lodge. Be sure to get your complimentary bumper sticker over at the Gift Garage. Whoa! Look at this place. It's so beautiful. Dustypoo, this is the perfect date! Let's check it out before we check in. Hey, there, folks. Hi. Like to get your picture taken with the superintendent? Uh... Ha! Classy. Oui, you're all set with the Piston view deluxe honeymoon suite on our zeroemission floor.  Enjoy your stay. Wow. They do weddings here. Did you know that?  Oh, this is so exciting, I'm gonna overheat! Well, I'm hitting the spa. The high beam steam takes off 50,000 miles, easy. Welcome, Mr. Secretary, to the grand reopening weekend of the magnificent... It's a pleasure to be here, Spinner. And is it a pleasure to see you, sir? Yes, it is. So, now, what's this I hear about a fire? Uh, fire... The Whitewall Fire is contained, sir. Right. It's under control. It's absolutely under control. Thank you... Engine Pulaski, sir. Whoski? ""Pulaski."" Right. Anyway, right this way, sir. And if there's any other questions you have for me, please, I am your man. Don't even have normal coffee here. I had to get something called a ""Highway Expresso."" What do you think? You look good. Eh. Tell me, how's the park's indigenous wildlife population? The what? The wildlife. Oh, the wildlife! Well, if you come to the party tonight, there'll be plenty of party animals. Ho, ho, ho. Huh? I see. Yes. The deer population is steady. And we've had a healthy increase in the number of redpropped balsa thrush. Ah, glad to hear it. Say, I didn't quite catch your name. Ranger Jammer, sir. Seventytwo years at Piston Peak. Pleased to meet you, Jammer. Well, it's a true... Bumper kisser. Wow, look at that ice sculpture! This could be our room if we were little, tiny pieces of ice. Dusty Crophopper! My buddies are never gonna believe this. Hey, do my voicemail. Your voicemail? Go! Oh, hi, this is Dusty Crophopper. ""World racing champion."" World racing champion. Please leave a message at the beep. Now, beep. What? Do it! Beep! That was awesome! Move along. Dusty! You have to meet the Secretary of the Interior. Okay. I'm up for a promotion. You understand. You're upwardly mobile, right? Sure. Of course, you are. You're a plane. Hey! Boat Reynolds! Boat, loved you in Best Little Boathouse in Texas. Excuse me, son. Do you work here? No, not really. Great, come over here. It's our anniversary. We honeymooned here 50 years ago. Can you believe it? I was 50 years younger and half a ton lighter. More to love! And Harvey, bless his heart, is trying to find the spot where we had our first kiss. Oh, that is so sweet! You don't do things like that anymore. Honey, honey, listen, I'm telling you. There was a bridge, and a magnificent waterfall, and... You. I love you, Harvey. Hey, you know, that sounds like Augerin Canyon. Yeah, that's right! Anger Canyon. By Upper Whitewall Falls. By Whitewash Falls! See? I told you I knew where it was. Hey, in honor of your anniversary, why don't you join us? We'll buy you a can of oil, on me. Oh, thank you, dear. Oh, sure, sure. I've been around the block a few times. I worked as a taco truck, sold carwash curtain rings for a while. Then, I got into RV tire sales. Winnie here was my showroom model. That's how we met. It's true. Aw, nice. For our wedding day, bought her the best set of whitewalls. We wore off the treads on our honeymoon. Yeah, oh... Driving! Oh, driving! Of course! She said ""Driving."" Delete that thought. Deleted! You know, Dusty... Maybe this firefighting thing will be a second career for you. Oh, yeah. This is a second career for all of us. Windlifter was a lumberjack, Cabbie was in the military, and me, well, I hauled cargo up in Anchorage. Yeah, a lot of guys up in Anchorage. I was beating them off with a stick.  ""Come here, boy. No."" Boom! Hey, big whirlybird, you haven't said much. How about a toast? Uh, Windlifter's not really much for speeches.  A toast to Coyote. It was he who drove all day and all night to the base of Bright Mountain. With much difficulty, he climbed the mountain to obtain fire, and brought it down to the first vehicles. But in so doing, he burned his tires. And when Coyote saw his blackened tires, he thought they were his favorite snack, and he ate them! For he knew they were still full of life. And it was in this way, he let go of the old, and renewed himself like fire renews the earth. Uh, I'm just gonna say it. You had me up until the part where he eats his own tires.  Best toast ever, Wind. Cheers! Cheers! Propwash Junction to Dusty. Oh? Huh? Oh? Oh, oh. Come in, Dusty. Come in, Dusty. Propwash Junction to Dusty. Hey, Skip. Oh. What's up? Oh, did the gearbox come in? Well, we... What? So... Dust... Sparky, I'll tell him. It was the wrong one. The crate... it was mislabeled. We've called every parts supplier, repair shop, and junkyard in the country. Nobody has your gearbox. Dusty? I'm here. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Thanks. All aircraft, we've got two fires. Hey, Crophopper. Get this, Cad's fancy jet VIPs flew in too low over the burn area last night, blew embers in all directions. Champ, let's load and go. The fire broke containment and split in two. Windlifter, you and Dipper take the Coil Springs fire. Me and the SEAT will take Whitewall Rapids. Windlifter copies. Maru, come in. Yeah, Blade? It's worse than we thought. Yeah? Get on the horn to the lodge. That fire is about four hours from their front door. They're gonna have to evacuate. Absolutely not! Blade insists. To be safe, you gotta get everyone out. I've been working on this lodge for five years. I'm not gonna evacuate now just to be ""safe."" You got less than four hours. Why am I talking to you? Where's Blade? Oh, he's out back sipping a motorjito. Where do you think he is? He's out fighting the fire! If we're gonna save the lodge, we've gotta keep this fire from cresting the ridge. I'll drop, then you tag on and extend. And make it a split load. That way, we can double up and widen it downwind of the ridge... If you push yourself into the red, you'll crash. Nobody has your gearbox. Copy that? Hey! You copy that? Huh? Yeah. Yes. Copy that. You gotta be kidding me. Was that your whole tank? Yeah. You just wasted all of it. I was just following your orders. I said, ""Split load."" We were going to make a secondary line to protect that lodge. It'll be fine. I can reload at the lake. Negative! Return to base. No! There's no time. Let's just get this fire out. Hey, hey! You need to listen to me! I'll be fine! These crosswinds are too strong. Return to base! This is what you trained me to do! Not under these conditions. If we're gonna get this fire out, I've gotta reload. Pull up, that's an order! No, I can do this. Oh! Ah!  I've taken in too much water. My engine stalled. Stalled? Keep your pontoons downstream. I'll keep ahead of you. I'll get out on my own. How you planning on doing that? I'll restart my engine. Just hang on. I'm gonna pull you to shore. Got it! Ah!  Ah. Ah! Are you all right? I'm okay. There's too much coverage. Don't worry, I'll get you at the next clearing. Right.    The hoist, it's caught. Uh! Blade... Blade! Oh, come on. You need to start your engine. You've got clear water. You can take off before the falls. It's your only chance. Right! Right. Got it. I'm good! Now, redline it. Push your engine! Redline it! You need more lift! Redline it! Redline it! Why are you holding back? Redline it! Ah! Oh!  Why didn't you redline it? You could've made it! What were you thinking? What? What's wrong? This ain't good. Head down that path. Follow me. Champ, come on! In here. An old mine? We can't go in there. We'll suffocate! It's our only chance. We'll let it burn over. No, you go on. I'll keep moving. What are you doing? Hey. Hey! You can't outrun the fire. You know what? I'll find my way out. Like you found your way out of the rapids. I didn't want to push my engine. You didn't ""want"" to? Blade, listen to me. This isn't about you. This is about life and death. You need to follow orders. I told you, ""Split load,"" you dropped it all. I told you not to reload on the lake, you did it anyway. I told you, ""Redline it,"" you pulled power. You don't have what it takes! You don't! Fine! I never wanted to be a firefighter anyway! Then go back to racing! Go win yourself another trophy, Champ. I can't! My gearbox is busted! All right? That's why I pulled power. I'm never gonna... Life doesn't always go the way you expect it. But you came here to become a firefighter. If you give up today, think of all the lives you won't save tomorrow. So, what are you going to do?  Is it a beautiful day here at Piston Peak Park? Yes, it is! Thanks for coming out, everybody. And I'd like to give a special welcome to the Secretary of the Interior who is joining us for the unveiling of this commemorative...  Plaque. The safety of the tourists is at stake! Sorry about that. If you could excuse me for a moment, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Am I giving a speech? Yes, I am, Pnewski. No, sir, ""Pulaski."" Papooski. ""Pulaski."" P'tootsie. ""Pulaski."" That's what I said. We're saying the same thing. With all due respect, Superintendent Spinner, the smoke over the ridge is growing closer. Yeah, perhaps we should turn on the roof sprinklers? We must evacuate. Better listen to them, Cad. They're right. Come on, Spinner! Let's see that plaque. Right away, sir! We need to cancel the unveiling. The longer we wait, the worse it'll get. Who are you? You're a glorified bell boy. You're an overpriced sprinkler, and you're old, and you have a dumb hat on. Who am I? I'm the Superintendent, and today is about me and my lodge. And now is the moment I've been waiting for!  Now, that's just rude. Fire! Oh. Let's get out of here.  Quickly! Quickly. We must evacuate. Don't panic! We must evacuate! This is a mandatory evacuation, but we have plenty of time. Keep moving. Keep going at a steady pace. Keep moving slowly, but carefully. All right. Look, there's no need to panic. It's really just a small, little fire. If you all just calm down, you can come back next year. Sure, you can all come back next year. I'll see you right here! Move along. That's it. And remember, avoid the smoke, stay above the canyon walls, you'll be okay. All right, next, please.  Out of my way, tail dragger. Hold on, there, big fella. No cutsies. You don't want to upset my buddy, here.  All right, ma'am, you're clear for takeoff. Thank you! Remember to avoid the smoke and stay above the canyon walls! Move along. Quickly, please. I'm sorry. I am sorry. That is all. The train is full. Remaining guests, please follow a staff member. They will lead you to the main road exit. All aboard!     Blade... Airway Meadow should be clear. We'll take off from there. Let's go. Blade! Blade! Patch, come in, this is Crophopper Seven. Patch, come in! I read you, Crophopper Seven. Blade is down. I repeat, Blade is down! I'll send Windlifter to respond. Stay at your location. Okay, that's good. Slow, slow. Good, good. Careful! Good. We're good! Pinecone, get those straps off. Avalanche? Yes! Push the ramp alongside the access panel and be careful. He'll be okay, right? It's bad, but, Maru, he's the best there is. He'll make him better than new. His hydraulics are completely fried. He's losing fluids. I gotta get him back to the garage, stat. Dynamite, tow hook! Coming right up. I'm gonna need hydraulic fluid from the shed. Copy that. Blackout, we'll need another generator. I got it! Try the main hangar. And grab another heat lamp! Yes, boss! The surface burns are bad, but the interior damage is repairable. As long as we move quick, we got a good chance. How is he? He's resting now. Oh. I've done everything I can.  Do you think he's gonna be... Look, Dusty, don't blame yourself. He should have left me out there. Nah. That ain't Blade's style. Especially since what happened to Nick. Nick? You mean Nick Loopin' Lopez from the TV show? It was just a routine day on the set. And Nick, he was doing his trademark loop for a stunt scene. But there was this freak crosswind. Blade was the first one on the scene... But he didn't know what to do. His best friend was gone. And Blade thought his life was over, too. But he didn't give up. He got trained, got certified, and came here. Blade, he used to pretend to save lives. Now, he saves them for real. What's going on up there? We're not getting enough water. Hey! We're not getting enough water on the lodge. Reroute the main water line to the roof sprinklers. Oh. No, no, no! The firefighters need that water to make retardant. How do you know that? I'm the concierge. It's my job to know everything. I don't care! Do you work for them? No, you work for me, what'syourname. Now, are you gonna do it, or do I have to do it myself?  Come on, come on!  I got it! All right, everybody, stay calm. Both roads are open. Keep your headlights on lowbeam and stay under five miles an hour. And be careful! That's right. It's going to be fine. Keep moving. We're gonna get everybody out. Good gracious!    Watch out!   Pulaski, you hurt? Are you okay? No, sir. Pump's busted. We're gonna have to find another way out. That's the problem, Mr. Secretary. There is no other way out. Listen up, y'all, we got big trouble. Wildfire jumped the main exit road and now it's blocked. I know it's after sunset, but you're in command. It's your call. There's not much time. If you're gonna go, you better go now. And we'll need every plane we've got. Load up. We'll have you out of here in 60... Huh? Uh... Problem! There's no water pressure. Main line must have burst again. Hey, Patch, what's the lake look like? Negative. No visibility. Boxed in by fire and smoke. All we have left is what's in our tanks. Let's make it count. We're headed straight into the fire. Aren't we gonna fly around it? The fastest way to the main road is through the fire. Brace yourselves. Hold on, Dusty!   Let's clear this road. All right, now, be careful. Slow and steady. We don't want to see any fender benders around here. Windlifter, do you copy? Go ahead, Patch. We've got two old RVs trapped in Augerin Canyon. Two old RVs? Oh, no. It's Harvey and Winnie. We met them earlier. They're looking for the place they had their first kiss. Augerin Canyon. That's at the other end of the park. I can get there the fastest. The canyon will be engulfed in flames and you have no retardant. I'll scoop off the river. There's a clear stretch of water. Windlifter, I can do it. Go. And be safe. Help! Help. Help! Winnie, hang on! Aah!  Harvey, Harvey, don't let go! Hold on, it'll be okay.  Dusty. Good move, partner.    Maru? Hello, there. Haha! He's awake! I'm a genius. Morning, mud dropper. How long have I been out? Five days. Dipper stayed by your side the whole time. I like watching you sleep. He's alive! Looking good, Dusty. All aircraft, the superintendent has entered the base. The superintendent has entered the base. Well, you had us worried, Dusty. Glad to see you're out and about. You're the superinten... What happened to Cad? Sprinkler saved the lodge, but not his job. Secretary of the Interior did the right thing. Put Ranger Jammer, here, in charge. Yay! Maru, did you tell him? Uh...  Tell me what? I replaced your prop. Repaired the damaged wing ribs. Hammered out what damage I could. Even got your pontoons back on.  But your gearbox... I know. Thanks for trying, Maru. You're welcome! What? Because you're fixed! Wait. Really? Yeah, that was the hardest thing I've ever done. You've got yourself a custommade epicyclic, concentric reduction gearbox. A new gearbox? No. It's better than new. Crophopper, I'd say you've earned that certification.  In accordance with CFR title 14, volume three, chapter one, section 139, subparagraph B, Propwash Junction is recertified and open for operation.  Go, Dusty! Hey, Dusty, I won, I won! Duster, guess what. I've been crowned official Corn Colonel. And I'm his Private Niblet. Can I wear my official hat to your race next Saturday? Absolutely, Chug. As long as the boss, here, will give me the day off. Anytime. Okay, Niblet, time to hit the festival! Sir, yes, sir. Hey, you think the deep fried corn cob on a stick guy... Aw, Dusty, we're all so proud of you. Thanks, Mayday. What you did for me, for all of us, I want to thank you. You don't have to thank me. Yes, I do. To do what you did, it takes a special kind of plane. Ladies and gentleplanes, turn your attention to the skies for today's featured aerial presentation. The Propwash Junction Corn Fest is proud to present the Piston Peak AirAttack team and our very own world champion racer and firefighter, Dusty Crophopper.   Whoa. Huh?  Welcome to Death Valley National Park. Is it hot?  Yes, it is.    Let's keep up the pace! Avalanche, Blackout, move, move, move! Did you guys see that? Let's go! Let's go! Yay! "
Planes,Disney,2010,2013,Animation,"Hello. Hello, sweetie. Daddy. lt's early. l know. l just wanted you to know, l'm sending you something. Does it smell nice? No, but it's sparkly.

Hope l'll get to fire it up. No word from the garbage men? No. They don't show, prep's wasted and you're out of retirement for nothing. This is fun. You've taken over the reins, the worries. l'm just along for the ride. Glad you're enjoying yourself, John. Police boat can get to us in seven, so you've four minutes to work your magic. You told me ten and said l'd have five. When? Do not mess with me. l will kick your ass. Yeah? Take your best shot. What? Come on, let's go. What is it this time? Da Vinci. Architect, engineer, painter. Fascinating. Check this out. ''Learn the language of poetry, art, romance, sex...'' Unlike you, my friend, l don't need a guidebook. Can we go? Right, guvnor. Make yourself useful. Untie that line. Today. Yeah. Yeah, Gilligan, if you don't mind. We set? Yeah. The viewing matrix tracks the Cartesian coordinates and altitude angles to give the exact position of our baby. We're in ltaly. Speak English. Steve, how we looking? Papa took the boat at 8.1 5, so the garage is empty. Mama left with daughter at 8.30 for preschool, as usual, so for the next 45 minutes, we own this place. Still no word from the garbage men? Who got you the Budapest beekeepers? You can trust these guys. How many times must l tell you? Trust everyone, but not the devil inside them. We're in. Just tell me where to paint. Your men still not in position? They will be. You don't know that. We should abort. l think that's Charlie's call now. Our baby's being taken away tonight. This is our only shot. Charlie? Keep going? lt's up to you, kid. Let's go. OK, Steve. From the west wall, measure 1 4 feet 8 inches. Got it. 8 feet 5 inches from the north wall. That's the northwest corner of our baby. Got it. Well, it's right above you. Now, paint. 2 feet 9 inches wide, 2 feet 5 inches deep. OK, Left Ear, you're up. 1 4 feet 4 inches from that west wall. The garbage men are in position, John. They've got the safe in the boat! Someone just called it in. The police boat's heading your way. Seven minutes and counting. Let's go. We've got four minutes. Let's go. Hey, you guys. Come here. l want to propose a toast. To us! And l want to propose a toast to Charlie. We just stole 35 million dollars worth of gold without even holding a gun because he planned this down to a T. Nobody else could've done that. Charlie! So, come on. Shopping lists. Who's doing what? Spare no dirty details. Come on, guys. Take a lesson from an old man. Don't spend it. lnvest. ln what? ln gold. Let's get out of here first. What are you getting, Rob? l don't know. There's a lot of things you can buy. l'm thinking of naked girls and leather seats. l'll get the Aston Martin Vanquish. There's little a girl won't do in one of those. l'm getting a NAD T7 70 digital decoder, 70watt amps and BurrBrown DACs. lt's a big stereo with speakers so loud they blow women's clothes off. $35 million and you can't get more creative than that? l'm going to Andalusia, south of Spain, get me a big house, a library of first editions, a room for my shoes. What about you, Steve? l haven't decided yet. You haven't decided yet?! ls it the mountain air? l liked what you said. l'll take one each of yours. Well, two of everything for Steve. l loved the toast. But you could've pulled this off with your eyes closed. You were just incredible. You saw the whole picture and covered all the angles. Charlie, there are two kinds of thieves in this world. The ones who steal to enrich their lives, and the ones who steal to define their lives. Don't be the latter. You miss out on what's really important in this life. What are you talking about? You've been a good father. Sitting in prisons doesn't make you a good father. l've spent half my kid's life in prison. Don't get to my age with only this. Find somebody you want to spend the rest of your life with. And hold on to her. Hey, let's go. l'm freezing my ass off. Steve's getting cold. You, too? l'm all right. l love you, kid. You did really great. Thanks, John. Let's go. Rob was driving that boat like Don Johnson! Yeah, from Brixton. What do you know about Brixton? Look at this idiot in the middle of the road. What's this? Who the hell are these guys? Take your hands off the wheel. Steve. Just do it. No, John. What the hell are you doing? Made a few plans of my own. There's nowhere you can go we won't find you. l think that's probably right. Go! Go! We've got to go, Charlie. Do you always work in the dark? Makes me feel l'm alone. Not bad, Stella. Purley couldn't crack that safe. Neither could Spears. You know who to call first. You're expensive. Those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs, goodwill... l do it for the money. l'll send you a bill. Don't you want to see inside? l never look inside. Have a good day. Hey, George. How long to crack it? Four minutes, 43 seconds. You're the man. What's in the lineup? Todd Millikan called. He has a prototype lock he wants you to test. He added two false contact points on the tumbler. l'll pretend to be stumped for a second or two. And there's a Charlie Croker in your office. Says you know each other. Charlie Croker. Hi, Stella. Didn't l tell you l never want to see you again? lt was when you told me my father died after you pulled him in for one last job. We found him, Stella. He's in Los Angeles. The gold bricks he stole from us had a Balinese dancer stamped on them. My contact, Skinny Pete, says an LA dealer's been buying those bricks. How do you know it's him? Skinny Pete sent me this. Steve changed his last name to Frizelli. Why tell me this? l checked highend safe companies. Steve had a Worthington 1 000 delivered to his home office. You install a Worthington 1 000 only if you've got something big to guard. No one on my crew can handle it. l need somebody l can trust. l'm a safe technician. l'm not a thief. lt's not about the gold, Stella. John was like a father to me, too. l'm sorry. l can't move on until l've set things right. l've moved on. Come on, then, Charlie. Come on. l want to see his face when his gold is gone. He took my father, l'm taking this. She's in. That's a good thing? She can crack the Worthington 1 000 without flinching. l'm not sure hiring a civilian's a good idea. She's got the skills and the motivation. Exactly. She's emotional. You know what happens then. Don't kid yourself. We're all emotional on this one. Let's go. Are you ready? Course l am. You're not ready. That was quick. Where are they? We're a little early. l didn't expect us to get here that fast. There. That's Lyle. He's my computer genius. He's who really invented Napster. At least, that's how he tells it. Said Shawn Fanning was his college roommate and stole his idea. l think it's his first time riding that bike, though. You OK? Yeah. That's Left Ear. Demolition and explosives. When he was ten he put too many M80s in the toilet bowl. Cool! How did you do that? What? How did you do that? What? What? Lost hearing in his right ear. Blown stuff up ever since. Handsome Rob. Premier wheelman. Once drove from LA just so he could set the freeway chase record. He got 1 1 0 love letters from women who saw him on the news. And you? l never heard how you got your start. Me? Well, l've been a thief since l had baby teeth. OK, you both know what to do. Cough it up now. Watch it, spas! What's your problem, man? Hey, Charlie. Good to see you. Good to see you. Hello, Charlie. You good? Guys, Stella Bridger. Nice to meet you. Phones. They're all clean, with internal chips. Change daily, we will get heat online. lDs? James Hymen? One time give me a cool name. 1 40 pounds? Try 1 65. Try lifting some weights. Try lifting up these. We leave tomorrow, all right? Handsome, help him with the bike. Help Knievel set up his next jump. Out of all the places for a thief to hide, this joker picked Hollywood. He's a punk, but he ain't stupid. We need a way to make a blueprint of the inside of Steve's house. l want phone surveillance. l want to try something. l'll fool the phone company into thinking there's a legal tap on the line and reroute the copies of the calls to us. Been doing it to my ex for years. How long...will it take? Not, how long have you been doing it to your ex? l'll have it running by morning. Sorry l'm late. We gotta get Steve out of the house. How much time do you need? Five minutes flat. Don't be cocky. lt's not the same as opening a safe for the police. Perspiration on your fingertips, heart's pounding. Whole different ball game. l appreciate your concern. l'll be fine. This is the easy part. The getaway can get us caught. What's the schedule? Drive to Union Station. Car goes onto the train. We need to know exactly how long to Union Station. Oh, great. Carson security system. How good is it? Carson's hold an annual contest. $50,000 if you can bypass the system. lt's a who's who of excons. Five years running, no one's been paid. Here's the status. An antiscaling fence, hardened electroplated steel. l'll have to paint that up with some nitromon. Security? A little rentacop with a 9 mm. That security booth looks prime for a chemical grenade. Nitromon, chemical grenades? That stuff's hard to come by. Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market... Shit! This dude got dogs. l don't do dogs. l had a real bad experience. What happened? l had a bad experience. l'm deaf?! ''Turn in your badge and your weapon...'' Crush. ''l don't want you anywhere near this investigation. ''...your badge and your weapon. ''l don't want you anywhere near this investigation.'' Oi! lt's a green! Green! Unbelievable. There he is. Let's get to work. lt's either bad traffic, peak traffic or slityourwrist traffic. Five people died from smoking between traffic lights. You could always use the metro. That would be ideal for carrying a tonne of gold. What's your guesstimate? From 20 journeys, l got an average of 32 minutes and a top time of 50. But with green lights, we could do it in 1 4 minutes. What, you couldn't get through traffic? You could do anything with green lights all the way. l'll see what l can do. You're right on time. These people putting their savings in banks, S and Ls, mutual funds... Do they think when the collapse comes they can depend on the government? l don't think so. Are you taping me? Of course not. l never tape you. See for yourself. Governments are nothing more than puppets on strings. ln a world where NAFTA can overrule the Supreme Court, like my cousin Mashkov always says, ''This is our only refuge, baby.'' Gold. Every time l look at these engravings... She's so beautiful. Where did you say you got these? l didn't. A little ''walking around'' money. l'm not walking as far as l thought. l can only buy two today. That wasn't the agreement. l'm just middleman. l'll buy the other two on Wednesday. Don't waste my time, Yevhen. So, what does a man with 35 million dollars worth of gold do at night? He watches his bigass TV. That's our in. Jesus! How did you get in here? l knocked but you didn't answer. So you just let yourself in? l was checking you were OK. l'm sorry. Don't look. OK. You've got a lot of stuff. Your dad was old school. Did the whole thing by touch. lt worked for him. This works for me. Technology guarantees speed and accuracy. There's no guarantees in this business, Stella. Why the headphones? Just training myself. Ambient noises, you know. Just in case. What do you want? We're knocking out Steve's cable. Then we send in a repair man. To get your video blueprint? Yeah. The problem is Steve thinks we're all dead. Except me. l'll do it, Charlie. l'm in all the way. Whatever it takes. All right. l'll set it up. OK. You want to get a drink with me before l go back to my room? l should finish this stuff up. Get it all done tonight. Yeah. Sorry l scared you. lt's OK. Goodnight. Bye. Then he's the media darling, on all the magazine covers. l should've been on Wired magazine's cover. He said he named it Napster because of his nickname, his nappy hair, but it's 'cause l was napping when he stole it from me. He didn't even graduate. l think it's time to move on, don't you? They shut him down. l wish they'd do the same to you. Here. Here we go. Cable chick. Becky. Nice name. l wonder what she calls the other one. lt's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend. All we need is a service truck like that, a workshirt like hers... Think Stella can pull it off? l have my doubts. There's no talking to Charlie, though. You think he's mixing business with pleasure? He should know better. Only l'm allowed to do that. Right. Where are you going? The workshirt and the service truck. Are you kidding me? How does he do that? How do you do that? What are you saying? ''Hey, how are you?'' ''l'm good.'' ''Nice to meet you, l'm Handsome Rob, and you are...?'' ''My name's Becky. lt's on my shirt.'' ''l need your shirt and your truck.'' ''Perfect. Would you like my virginity as well?'' ''lf it's on the menu.'' ''You're so witty. Take advantage of me.'' ''You're not too bright, are you?'' ''No.'' ''Perfect.'' Yes, Mr Frizelli. The cable's out. The TV, the modem, everything. Get somebody up here quick. Netcom Cable. l'm at 3320 East Skyway and the cable's gone. l have a Thursday between 9 and 3. That's good. Thank you. Guard just called the cable company. What time's the appointment? Thursday between 9 and 3. l'm calling from Netcom Cable. You set up an appointment for Thursday? We have a technician who's free earlier than expected. Will somebody be there for an hour? Sure. Our technician will see you then. Have a nice day. Here's all the paperwork you need. Just get him to sign and date it. Let's check out the camera. Stella, you'll be going patriotic today. Walk slowly or the image'll streak. l'm sorry. lt's OK. Couldn't pin the corsage on my prom date, either. You had a prom date? lt was his cousin. There's cable in the kitchen, living room, bedroom and the office. You need to locate the safe in the office. l think you're very brave going in there. l second that. lt's going to be fine. What? Fine stands for freaked out, insecure... ...neurotic and emotional. You'll be great. Yeah. Good morning. Can l see some lD? Thanks for coming so soon. That's part of the job. Aston Martin Vanquish. So that bastard took my car. Nastyass dogs. Cease! Relax, Jesus Christ! Come on, they won't bother you now. Come on. House! Go on, get out of here. l'm used to running into animals on my job. Want to show me that problem? Of course. This way. You've a really nice house. 1 922. All the original tiles. Every stone in that courtyard from some monastery in Seville. What a tactic. Monastery for punkass creeps! You're not impressed? lt's just that lugging rocks from one place to another isn't that interesting. lt doesn't quite do it for me. What does do it for you? TVs. l have a monster TV. lt's not working right now... l should check the cable modem. Yeah? OK, right. Over here. l paid thirty grand for some punk kid to install it. One day it just goes out. l'm going to have him strung up. Here we go. There's our baby. Oh, man. We got him. Got any wiring coming through here? There's no wiring in here. lt's just right here? Look at that. That's my NAD T7 70. That's my stereo. l bet people are surprised when they expect the cable man and find you standing there. He's hitting on her. There's no problem here. l should just check the TVs. You know what? l'm blowing this shit right off the mountain right now. ABM processor. Only the best. Check the box. l'm just going to reset your system. Sometimes these things just get jammed up, you know? That should do it. lt's fixed? Turn her on. Let's see. Now. Perfect. Becky, huh? Have we met before? No, l don't think so. lf you can just sign there. lf l asked you to dinner, would l be the first customer to do that? Did you ask your last cable guy out? No, but he was 300 pounds with a handlebar moustache. Not my type. lt's not a good idea. ls that some cable company rule? No, it's my rule. l don't go out with strange men. We just met five minutes ago. l guess l have to sabotage my cable until we get to know each other. Have a nice day. l'll be a perfect gentleman. l won't even ask for your number. l'll meet you. Anywhere you want to go. Come on, break your rule. Once. Just dinner. ls that a yes? You OK? Yeah. He touched my hand. He came on to me. Hey, at least l created a window of opportunity, right? When he goes out Friday night, we go in. By the time he realises you've stood him up, we'll be gone with that gold. Shuffle them cards this time, Left. Lyle, what's the distance between the front door and the vault? Quit dealing while my back's turned. You've got loser's paranoia. He only answers to the Napster now, Charlie. l'm not calling you the Napster. You call him Left Ear. And him Handsome Rob. Because he is Handsome Rob. Well, you can call me the Napster. They were at college together. Why are you encouraging this? lt is verifiable. He was my roommate. He stole my ideas. l am the Napster. All right, what is the distance between the front door and the vault, Napster? Farther than you want to carry it. So, how do we get the gold to the car? How wide is the hallway...Napster? 6 feet. OK, you've got your gold. We need more cars to handle the weight. l'll need help with the custom work. l know a man for the job. l modified the camera with LlDAR so we can create hires digital maps... Who's that? Rob's mechanic friend. Charlie, this is Wrench. What's up? Rob says you're talented. l need some bodywork done. We need to pack 2,700 pounds in these Minis, with enough suspension and horsepower to outrun anything chasing. 2,700 pounds of what? Whatever. What do l get from this mystery? All right. We didn't get a chance to meet yet. Wrench. Ham and cheese. That's cold. Damn, that's cold. You want all greens? 'Cause you got 'em. Welcome to LA's Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control Center. They use video feeds from intersections and algorithms to predict traffic conditions and control traffic lights. l created my own kickass algorithm to sneak in and now we own the place. Want to do a dry run? Thought you'd never ask. See red light? Green light. Danielson, what's up with grid 34? Let's check it out. Oops! Did l...? But it's awesome. ls that not awesome? Can you change it back? Lights are working fine. lt's just an accident. That's good. What are those? Unnecessary parts. l lost your smog controls and 200 pounds of fat. You got a sweet ride now, Charlie. Know what l'm thinking about right now? The look on Steve's face. You're early. l'm in a hurry. You know that the Florida voterigging was a ClA and mob operation? Which is not so different from when JFK won an election with his father's help. You're uncomfortable l mention JFK? No, l don't like making two trips. You Americans, you love your heroes. A holiday for Columbus? He makes the wrong turn and wipes out an indigenous people. Know what he was looking for? Tell me. Gold, supposedly for Queen lsabella. Don't think the Medicis didn't want some. What did ltaly need gold for? The longdistance slave trade, based in Venice. Venice. That's where these bricks... You were saying something? No. Don't stop. l'm interested. Please, l'm confused. My English... What do you know about my gold? l don't... Don't even think about lying to me. OK. l heard a rumour about a heist in Venice. 35 million, in bricks, with a Balinese dancer imprint. Who have you told? No one, l swear to God! You swear to God? You're crazy. l swear to God, l didn't. Well, then, l guess l believe you. Let's putt it. Putt, not drive. Very good. You can get it. l know you can do it. Here to see Skinny Pete. He's over there. Thanks, man. Don't stare. He doesn't like people staring. Stare at what? That was good. Try that one. l know you'll get that one. That was great. Skinny Pete. Yo, Charlie. What's up, man? Was l right about the gold? l'm not here for that. We need some supplies. Baby, go relax. Go relax! Supplies. What's wrong? Some nitromon... Some nitromon primer. What's wrong? Nothing, l'm cool. l'm great. l just need a big can of... ...nitromon primer, detonating cord, two triplecharger chemical grenades and a launcher. Right, like l had told you earlier. All right. Cost you about five Gs. Done. Thanks. Sorry about that. All right, man. Peace. Come on. Get out. There. Vance has something to tell you. Go on. A couple of weeks back... ...l was working in your cousin's shop. A guy come in asking about gold bricks with Balinese dancer on. What did you tell him? That l'd seen the bricks. l'm sorry. What did this man look like? He had long black hair with tattoo on his neck. He must have weighed at least 400 pounds. l know that guy. Baby, go relax. Do you know who l am? You're Mashkov. Right. You were asking about the gold bricks with the Balinese dancer on. Why? Steve just confirmed his eight o'clock dinner reservation. Let's go over it. Gas the guards. Doors open, 8.1 5. Safe popped by 8.25. Loaded, 8.35. Out, 8.45. Straight to Union Station. Only green lights, rest of city's red. Cops stuck in traffic. Train leaves at 1 0. Cars must be aboard by 9.30. Timing must be exact. Let's get ready. Let's get it. Wow, that is a nice car. Sorry, Rob. Coast is clear, guys. This is it. Moment of truth. What the hell is this? Shit! Steve's neighbour's throwing a party. Are you here for the Baker party, sir? No. We're not blowing any gates tonight, guys. Too many witnesses. Stella. l know... l'm late for my date. You've got to be charming. We need him to ask you out again. Sorry. Let's get out of the street. l can't imagine you doing that. What's that mean? Well, you don't really seem the adventurous type, you know. Don't let the cable uniform throw you. l wasn't making assumptions. l've made some about you. Oh, really? And...? You're just going to have to wait and see. Why wait? Let's go back to my place. No assumptions. Not tonight. lt's late. l should go home. You have a cable company curfew? No. l've made some bad calls in the past. We should take this slower. Lovely dinner, sparkling conversation. Still don't trust me? l trust everyone. lt's the devil inside them l don't trust. That's an interesting saying. Where'd you pick that up? Can't remember. l knew a guy who said it just like that. Really? Yeah. He's the only person l've ever heard say that. His name was John Bridger. You're hurting me. He had a daughter about your age. Let go. l knew there was something familiar about you. You're exactly like your old man. l liked him, too. l liked him right up until the minute l shot him. Who are you working with? She's with us. The gang's all here. The only thing worse than a thief... ...is a coward. Then you should've seen the way your daddy begged for his life. He's not worth it. Put a leash on your cat. Not bad, Charlie. You have no idea how hard it is for me not to kill you now. You know better than that. You can't let emotion into these things. lt wasn't emotion when you shot John and left us? That wasn't about emotion. lt was about a lot of gold. Anything you think you deserved, you didn't. Don't talk about right and wrong with me. l don't give a shit. OK? You got your cards, l got mine. We made our play, l came out on top. lf you want to start the game up again, that's fine with me. What is your play here, really? Come on, what do you think? You'll try to take out my guards? l have five that you don't know about. You'll have Lyle hack the system? l'll change it tomorrow morning. What was your final move? Have Bridger's daughter try to crack my safe? That's very poetic, but l just don't think she'll get anywhere near it. Same old Steve. Always thinking defensively. That's why you're always number two. How's that? You've got no imagination. Couldn't even decide what to buy. Bought what everyone else wanted. Try this. That gold is already gone. Bullshit. lt's over, Charlie. l'm trying to move the last two bricks. You want to come after me over a couple of lousy bricks? Be my guest. But you're off to a bad start because you just blew the element of surprise. Surprised? lt's over when l say it's over. Are you all right, sir? How you doing? Good. Considering the fact l'm doing all of this for a man l barely knew. You know what bothered me all those years? lt was that whenever he'd call me to tell me he was on some job, l knew you were right there with him. You got to know him a lot better than l did. Doesn't mean he wasn't thinking about you. Would be nice if it was true. lt is. He always regretted not having been a good enough father to you. How do you know? Because he told me. What did you do to your hand? l punched Steve. Why do you get to punch him? 'Cause those hands are way too valuable. You OK? There'll be nothing left of that if you keep rubbing it. Tell Mr Frizelli we'll see him at eight. He's flying the coop. When? His security guard called for a helicopter at 4 p.m. and an armoured car at five. There's a cargo plane, departing LAX at 8 p.m. to Mexico City. What if he's moving the safe as a diversion? We crack it, the gold's somewhere else. Steve won't let it out of his sight. lt'll be in that truck and he'll watch it from the helicopter. The gold's headed to Mexico? Who knows...? Slow down. This is good news for us. What do you mean? Now the safe has come to us. We're going to boost it in transit. He could take a dozen routes. We don't know which. We can't take out an armoured truck at rush hour. We're already set up to do it. Gridlock every route except the one we choose. Force that truck to go where we want. Where do we want it to go? We'd lose a shoot up. We do it like The ltalian Job. Why'd you do it? Do what? Yevhen. You didn't have to clip him. We didn't clip anybody. Yevhen's cousin is under the impression you did. Why? Because you wanted to know about the gold. You told him that? One thing l know, never mess with Mother Nature, motherinlaws, or motherfreaking Ukrainians. Look, l need a favour. Had a hiccup last night. Need some help. More handson. lnterested? Could be, but l don't like to be kept in the dark. lf l'm in, l'm in. OK, you're in. All right. What do you think? This'll work. Let's go. You're amazing. lt's a work of genius. You OK? Just give me a moment. Now? l'm inserting this pin into the detonator. lf the brass touches the sides, we'll both be the last people we ever see. Take all the time you need. Hey, Charlie. What? l love you, man. l love you, too. He's going to be on train 59 for New Orleans. You sure the source is good? l'm sure. Check positions. Napster? l'm in position. Handsome Rob? ln position. Everything's quiet, Charlie. Wrench? Set. We've got an uninvited visitor. There's a motorcycle guard following the truck. We'll deal with it. Who are they? What's wrong? You won't believe this. He's brought in three armoured trucks. lt's a shell game now. l can't reroute if l don't know which to reroute. Follow the one Steve follows by helicopter. He'll never let that gold out of his sight. Unless he's playing us. And he is. OK, let's go! Move it out! Here we go. They're pulling out. Napster, pull up the traffic cameras you're watching. Where's the first camera they go past? Vine and Yucca. See which one's riding low. First in line... First two are the same, so... Houston, we have our truck. Number 1 28. We're moving out. Three Kilo Bob to Two Fox Mike, we're heading to the airport. OK, guys, truck 1 28 has turned right heading west. Gridlock time. We've crashed. lt's not a crash. We've got power. l can't log in. They're about to hit a detour and be sent your way. You'll never shut down the real Napster. What's your problem?! Truck 1 28, what is your progress? Traffic's out of control. We've got to look for another route. Check the police band. OK, l'm opening up a space on Highland. Get us out of here. l'm trying. And he's taking it. Police are saying computers are down at traffic control. Nice, Charlie. What are you up to? Go back. l now command you to turn left. Come on, take the left. Yeah, you did. You did. Give us the flag. Metro just passed through the station. You are clear for 90 seconds. Go. Come on, Steve. 30 seconds and counting. 1 5 seconds, you're blocked in or you're paint on the train. Come on, come on! Stay on me. This'll be tight! Go, go, go. You're going to stop there. OK, guys, coming into position. Stay cool. Ten, nine... ...eight, seven... ...six, five... ...four... Don't lose him. ...three... ...two, one... What...?! Damn. What the fuck happened to my truck?! lt blew through the street. Get under there. We have another problem. What? This isn't the Worthington 1 000. What? He switched safes on us. Can you do it? lt's lsraeli made. lt's got a glass relock system. There's a pane of glass here. lf l don't drill perfectly, steel rods snap into place and we can't open it. Then we're up shit creek. l think l just cracked the glass. l don't think it broke, though. l can't drill it again. l have to do it by touch. l can't get through. The train's blocking the tunnel. Where does the Metro Rail emerge? Eleventh and Fig. Meet at Eleventh and Figaro and double back to Hollywood and Highland. Hurry. Baggage for train 22 now available at carousel 4. l can't do this. l need a drill or a borescope to get in there. Come on, Charlie. You can do this. Slide. Don't you want to see inside? Absolutely. Napster, 1 3 across, 4 high, 4 deep. That's 208 bricks. How much? 2.7 million. What?! No, it's 27. That's 27 million. That's 27 million dollars worth of gold. Got the Holy Spirit. You should get on it, it's a good train. What do you think, John? 27 million. Say it again. We've got two motorcycles on us, Charlie. Three Minis heading east towards the LA river. Stop them before they get to the street. Shit! Here we go. Open your door. Come on, guys. We're moving. There! Hey, come on. Get down! Come on! Where are you going? l'll take Steve. Go to Union Station. l'll meet you there. Stay on him. l'm opening up a spot on Lower Grand. l know it's you, Charlie. Take your next left. Nice move, Steve. Get out! Get out! l said get out! You got Mini Coopers in there, right? Look, man... Don't worry about them. l'll give you five grand to put me inside. Buy your girlfriend something nice. Half now, half when you help me unload. l've got to hand it to you. You played this one pretty smart. Decoy trucks, you switched safes, the helicopter routine. Pretty good. Now l've got the gold, you've got nothing. l've got this, so cut the crap and give me my goddamn gold! Who are you? l am Mashkov. You killed my cousin Yevhen. You've got to have some insurance. He was already dead when l arrived. He dealt with unsavoury people. This guy's trying to play you. You were right. No imagination. There's a lot of gold in there. Only we've got guns. l'll make you a good deal. l've already made my deal. What do you want? You know this was never about gold. Whatever helps you sleep at night, sweetheart. Bitch. Charlie, come on, Charlie! That l loved. l'll double whatever he's given you, just don't shoot me. Don't worry, l'm not going to shoot you. l'm going to take you to my workplace. l think you'll be interested in my machinery. Oh, come on. Guys, l want to make a toast. To John Bridger. The most brilliant master planner of all. Father and friend. Stella was right. lt wasn't about the money. Of course, that didn't stop the guys from having some fun. Handsome Rob got his Aston Martin. Took it for a ride to break it in. He got off with a warning. Left Ear got his dream house in Spain with a room just for his shoes. Lyle finally made the cover of Wired magazine. Are you really the Napster? Yes, l am. And he got that kickass stereo he wanted. Would you listen to something? With speakers so loud they could blow a woman's clothes off. lf you would. And me? l took John Bridger's advice. l found somebody l want to spend the rest of my life with, and l'm going to hold on to her forever. "
Ralph Breaks The Internet,Disney,2010,2018,Animation,"Okay. My turn, my turn. Um, I got one. Great, but can you make it a little more challenging this time? Okay. Check this out. I spy with my little eye... something yellow... and round, and it eats dots. Seriously, Ralph? Yeah, seriously. You're never gonna get it. Well, obviously, it's PacMan. No, that's not... Why is that obvious? Name one other thing in this whole arcade that is yellow and round and eats dots. I can name two things. Ms. PacMan and Baby PacMan. Boom! I accept your apology. Yeah, you're right. Okay. But was it PacMan? Yeah, you got me. Knew it. All right, riddle me this... do you or do you not think that Zangief waxes? No way. Look at the guy. He looks like a yeti. I don't know. I mean, if the fur were confined to his chest, I might agree... but look at those two very specific tuffets of shin hair... poking out of his boots. That does not just happen, Ralph. That is a choice. You're totally right, kid. He's baby smooth everywhere else. I rest my case. My mind is blown! Let's go get a root beer. Okay, let's see what you got, kid. Ooh! Nice one. Okay. I think I got one in the chamber. Ew! Gross. Thank you. Hey, wanna sneak into Tron?  Doesn't that game have a virus? No. I'm sure they fixed it. Whoo! I'm gonna beat my speed record! Hey, wait for me! Ralph. Yeah? I don't think they fixed the game. Uh... No. Help! Hey, Tron! Tronny! Tronny boy! Help! Do you realize we're basically just, like, zeroes and ones... floating around the universe like tiny specks of dust? Like, doesn't the very nature of our existence make you wonder... if there's more to life than this? Why would I wonder if there's more to life when the life I got is perfect? I mean, sure. Doesn't look so hot on paper. I'm just a bad guy from some old video game  who wrecks a building.  And yeah, for 27 years,  I was a total zero without any friends.  But now, I got a best friend... who just happens to be the coolest kid in the whole arcade. Aw, thanks, pal. Watch this. Home run! All right, let's go watch the sunrise. Are you really saying there's not one single, solitary thing... about your life that you would change? Well, think about it. You and me get to goof off all night long. Litwak shows up, we go to work, we put in our hours. Then the arcade closes and we get to do it all over again. The only thing I might do different in that scenario... would be not having to go to work. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Huh? Hey, where'd our sunrise go? All right, let's get you plugged in. That's a plugin alert. Litwak hasn't plugged in a new game in forever. Let's go see what it is! Yeah! Excuse us. Excuse us. Minor emergency. Hey, Felix, Calhoun, what's getting plugged in? Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks it's gonna be a new pinball machine. What do you think, lady love? I'll bet you a shiny nickel it's a blood pressure machine. Kids love those things. Ooh. Please be a racing game. Please be a racing game. Please be a racing game. ""Whiffee""? Or, ""Wifey""? Well, it's either wiffle ball, or an arranged marriage game. It's actually pronounced ""WiFi,"" Ralph. Yeah, that's what I said. And WiFi is the Internet... which is an online community where human beings go to shop... and play games and socialize. Ooh, fun! Oh, no, it is not. That sign right there says ""WiFi."" What it should say is ""DieFi."" That's a little humor there. But seriously, the Internet is nothing to laugh at. It is new, it is different, and therefore we should fear it. So keep out, for Pete's sake, and get to work. The arcade's about to open. Figures, we finally get something new plugged in... and we're not even allowed to go in there. Totally not fair. A new racing game would've been cool. Something wrong with your game? No, no. It's just every bonus level's been unlocked. I know every shortcut. Man, I'd kill for even just a new track. New track? You already got, like, three choices. Yeah, I know, but don't you ever wish something new and different... would happen in your game? Nope. Really? Well, agree to disagree. Wait, I don't wanna disagree. No, no. It's just a fancy way to say we don't have to argue about it. We're arguing? I don't wanna argue. Relax. Stop making it a thing. Go to work. I'll see you tonight, stench vessel. All right. She wants a new track, I'll give her a new track. Come on, Nafisa! Let's play Sugar Rush!  Pick Vanellope, Swati. She's got the best superpower. Yeah, the glitch. I love her. Drivers,  start your engines.  You're gonna lose today, Princess. While, yes, I am technically a princess, Taffyta... I'd rather you just think of me as plain old Vanellope... the racer who's about to kick your butt. Three, two, one, go!  And pardon me, excuse me, coming through. Whoohoo! Whoo! And one, two, three gumballs right on cue. Yeah, I love it when she glitches. Ooh! Huh. Excuse me. I must have fallen asleep. Oh, fun. I'm winning. Vanellope takes a huge lead.  No one's gonna catch her now.  She's gonna love this. Right on time. What? ""Looking for something new... ""and different? ""Then take this track."" Oh, Ralph, you old sonofagun. I'd say I got a little time for a detour. Whoa! Hey, look, I think I unlocked a new track. Never seen that before. This is awesome! Hey, thanks, Ralph! You're welcome! Get back up on the track, Swati. You're going to lose. I can't. It's like it's driving itself. Whoo! What is wrong with this thing? What? No, no! Kid! Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Kid! Kid! Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, are you okay? Oh, my gosh. What an amazing track! Thank you, Ralph! Thank you, thank you, thank you! You're welcome! You know I take my duty as your hero very seriously. Wait a minute. You took a serious doody where? Vanellope, get up here. We have a situation. Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope racer wasn't working... and I think maybe I turned the wheel too hard. Whoa. I'm real sorry. It's okay, Swati. I think I can get it back on there pretty easy. What did you do, Ralph? Nothing. Leave him alone. He was just trying to make the game more exciting. Yeah, why don't you relax, Taffyta? Litwak will fix it. All right, on you... Oh! Okay. Still not a problem. He'll just order a new part. Well, I'd order a new part... but the company that made Sugar Rush  went out of business years ago. I can try to find one on the Internet. Good idea. Oh, me too. Good luck, that'll be like finding a needle in a... I found one! On ebay! Really? How about that? See? Those kids have it under control. They're just gonna get another wheel from the eboy. Are you kidding me? How much? That's more than this game makes in a year. Aw, I hate to say it, but my salvage guy is coming on Friday... and it might be time to sell Sugar Rush for parts. Aww. Where's he going? Litwak's gonna unplug the game. Get out of here! Go, scram, let's go, run! Go, run, run, run, run! Let's go! Run! Gangway! Yeah, you heard him, gangway! Stop it! No running! What are you people doing out of your game, for Peter's sake? The arcade is open! Sugar Rush  is getting unplugged. We're homeless! Yeah, yeah, we're homeless! Oh, what are we going to do? Y'all, calm down, calm down. Get a hold of yourselves. I don't want to be gameless. An unplugging. Good Lord. I haven't seen this many gameless characters since Space Invaders  went down. Um... Where are we gonna live? Well, you can stay here until the arcade closes, I guess... and then we'll figure out where the heck we're gonna put you all. Okay. Here we go. I raided Gene's fridge. Good news, he's got pie. Took a bunch of his pillows and junk, too. I'm thinking we make a fort up here, or like a yurt. Or we could take these pillows... If we stack them right, we can make an igloo out of pillows. Like a pillow igloo. Pigloo. Pigloo! So what do you think, kid? Fort, yurt, or the obvious best choice, pigloo? I can't believe I don't have a game anymore. I mean, like, what am I gonna do all day? What? Come on, are you kidding? You sleep in, you do no work, then you go to Tapper's with me every night. I've literally just described paradise. But I loved my game. Oh, come on. You were just bellyaching about the tracks being too easy. No, that doesn't mean I didn't love it. Yeah, sure, it was kind of predictable... but still I never really knew what might happen in a race. And it's that, it's that feeling, that notknowingwhat's comingnext feeling. That's the stuff. That feels like life to me. And if I'm not a racer, Ralph... what am I? Well, you're my best friend. That's not enough. Hey. No, I just... I'm sorry, I know I'm being weird. I think maybe I just need to be alone right now. Oh. Okay. I'll meet you over at Tapper's in a little while, I guess. If you want. All right, now...  we found some good homes  for so many of our chums  from Sugar Rush... and we're just hoping a few more of you will open your doors... and your hearts to those in need. Well, I suppose that large green olive will fit in nicely with my decor. I'm a sour ball. Well, beggars can't be choosers, can they? Come along, condiment. Mmkay. Marvelous. That just leaves the racers. We're, like, adorable. You sure are. So, any takers? Um... Anyone? Felix, I know we've never once talked about having a family before, but... I know, it feels like the kind of thing you just jump into with both feet... and nary a plan. Felix and I will give them sanctuary. Can I get a quick word with you two? Look, I get it. You've been married six years, you're looking to spice things up... but trust me, adopting 15 children is the wrong kind of spice. Those things are basically feral. Pardon me, sir, but those youngsters are lambs. Lost little lambs in need of two kind, caring shepherds. That's right. Besides, how hard can parenting be? You treat the child like your best friend... you give them everything they want... and you just love their little socks off. Right, Tammy? Darntootin'. Huh? Come and get it. Get your own candle. Hey, Mom, why does your lame TV only have one channel? Well, hate to say I told ya... Ow! Hey, Tapper? No, Ralph. I haven't seen Vanellope. Not since the last time you asked me 30 seconds ago. Sorry. I'm just worried about her. She's glitching like crazy, and acting super insecure. Oh. And get this, she said... being friends with me wasn't enough for her. Not enough? I'm a great friend! Right, Tapper? Right? I'm sorry. Who's acting insecure? Ralph, come on. The kid just lost her game. Give her a break. There you are... Oh. Hey, Ralph. Hey, Felix. Since when do you drink root beer? Since tonight. Yeah, I hear you, buddy. Hey, listen. This one was supposed to be for Vanellope. I guess you can have it. Doesn't look like she's coming. Thanks. You know, I can't help but think this whole mess is somehow... partially my fault. It figures. Just when my life was perfect. Mine was, too. But, hey, now I'm a father of 15. Isn't that just a blessing? Eeeeeohboy! Wait. What'd you say, Felix? Um, isn't that just a blessing? No, the weird sound thing. Oh. Eeeeeohboy? Yeah. Eeeoh... Sorry, say it again? Eeeeeohboy. Eeeeeohboy! Eeeohboy! Eeeboy! Say it again? Eeeeeohboy! Eeeeeohboy. Eeeeeohboy... eboy! eboy! eboy! eboy? eboy? eboy. Yeah. Um, what are you getting at there, Ralph? That kid out in the arcade said there was a steering wheel part... on the Internet, it's something called eboy or... ebay! That's it, it was ebay! Ralph, are you thinking about going to the Internet and finding that part? Getting that part's the only thing that's gonna fix the game and that's the only thing that's gonna make Vanellope happy again. And if Sugar Rush is fixed, all those lovable scamps living in my house... and destroying my sanity will have homes of their own again! Ralph, this is an important mission. A noble mission! I will cover for you. Thanks, pal. Ralph, what about your tab? You owe me for the root beer. Oh, Felix is gonna cover for me. Drinks on the house, everybody! Felix is paying. Shoryuken! Eeeeeohboy. Boo! Ralph, what is wrong with you? Start churning butter and put on your church shoes, little sister... 'cause we're about to blast off! What are you even talking about? Oh, we're going to the Internet. What? Yeah, to find the part to fix your game. No way! Yeah, I probably should've just said, ""We're going to the Internet."" We're going to the Internet! Yeah, we are! Hey, Surge, are we glad to see you. We want to report some malfeasance over by the WhacAMole.  Yeah, we saw some undesirables causing a real donnybrook over there. Oh, heck no. Not on my watch. Appreciate the tip. So, all we gotta do is find this eboy place. Ebay. Right, ebay. So we go there, get the steering wheel... we have it delivered to Litwak before Friday. He'll fix your game. Everything goes back to the way it was. Boom! Happily ever after. This is a shockingly sound, wellthoughtout idea for you, Ralph. No offense. I know. And none taken. Ooh, here it comes. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls... I give you the Internet! Huh. The Internet is not nearly as impressive as how Sonic described it. Yeah, I gotta admit, I'm underwhelmed. Where do you think they keep their ebay? Beats me. Hello, anybody here? Anyone? Hello! We're looking for ebay! Ooh. Did you hear that, kid? Sweet echo. Check this out. Hooliehoo! Hooliehoo!

Don't leave without me! IP address 4151037483.  Vanellope! I can't breathe. I don't fit. Whoohoo! Yeah! Whoo! Kid! Ralph! Isn't this great? No, it is not! Whoohoo! No, no, no. Whoa! Sweet mother of monkey milk! Whoa! Kid, I don't think we're in Litwak's anymore. We most certainly are not, friendo. We are in the Internet! Come on, Ralph! Holy cow! Look at all this stuff. Whoa. This is the most beautiful miracle I've ever seen. But it's so big. It goes on forever and ever. How are we possibly gonna find ebay out there? Hey, kid. Kid, don't worry.

All right, step into my parlor. This is your website? I know what you're thinking, not to worry. My antivirus guy was just here. Clean as a... Oh! Dang it! Oh, my gosh. That's embarrassing.

Is $40,000 lucrative enough for you? Whoa! Whoa. It's more than enough. I got a guy in Des Moines, Iowa... who will pay 40 grand for Shank's car... from a game called Slaughter Race.  A racing game? That's right. Slaughter Race  is the most popular online racing game out there. However, it is wicked dangerous. We ain't afraid of danger. This kid's the best racer in the whole world. We'll get you that car, no problemo. Slaughter Race! Enter at your own risk.  Okay, this game is kind of amazing. Meh, the attention to detail is pretty impressive. I don't think I've ever been in a game with smog before. Nice kitty. Nice kitty. Easy, boy. Easy. Let's just find Shank's car and get outta here. Agreed. Look. Look. Whoa! There it is. That car is gorgeous. No wonder it's worth so much. Aw, sugar. Players. They beat us to it. Aw. 31 hours of continuous gameplay...  and we've finally found Shank's car.  Let's jack this ride. Oh, yeah, DirtySocks, it's on. Jim! Jimmy? You're not playing that horrible game again, are you? No, Grandma! I'm doing my homework. Okay, like I said... Let's jack this ride.  Well, well, well. While the cat was away, these mice tried to play. Hey, I think that might be Shank. Listen up, mice... anyone who tries to play with this cat's ride is gonna get got. You're going down, Shank.  Pyro. Give those punks the works. With pleasure. End of the road!  Gosh dang it! Now we gotta start all over. Ralph, maybe... Hey, where are you going? I am scared. If we get burned up in here, that's it, we're dead, we're gone. So, I think we should get outta here right now. No, wait, wait. I have an idea. Hey, Shank? What's up, Pyro? Um, do you ever reckon we're going a bit too hard on the players? Honestly, no, I don't. Of course, I have empathy for players like DirtySocks537 and BabeRaham_Linkin... but if we just let them win, where's the life lesson? You know? Mmm. Yeah, but to Pyro's point... I mean, those players work so hard to get here. I hear you, Felony... but imagine a game without challenges. The same predictable thing every single time... who wants that? Shank's right. I just saw a really insightful TED talk... and I can't really remember what the guy said. It was more about how he made me feel. But I think, ultimately, the point was... I honor your journeys, guys. And we honor yours, Butcher Boy. Thank you. Hey, Shank, did you ever wonder what it would be like... if someone actually did get your car? Well, I know one thing... whoever does will have to be the best of the best. Good day to you, madam. Who are you? I'm here from the, uh, Department of Noise. And the thing is, we've been getting some complaints down at HQ. Uh, Larry's the one who takes the calls. Anyways, someone told Larry... that we've been hearing a lot of gun sounds and screaming sounds... and whathaveyou. That sort of thing. Whoa! This is nice. Where have you been all my life? Uh, so I came to check on things. Oh, I'm sorry, who did you say you were again? Oh, I'm Larry? Uh, you said Larry took the call. Good job, Larry! Yeah, worked like a charm! Are you kidding me? Someone got Shank's car?  And I need yours. Sorry. I'm just... I'm just gonna go.  This is the worst day of my life! It's a shame we have to leave so soon. This game is cool. Just get us out of here so we can get this car to Spamley and get paid. No problem. Uhoh. Look at this guy coming in hot. You mess with the bull, you get the horns, little girl! You still have value, Butcher Boy. Oh, no! It's that Shank lady. She looks upset. Ah, don't worry, I'll lose her. Where are you going? Kid, get back on the track. I'm gonna lose my cookies. There is no track. I can drive anywhere. Whoo! Oh, kid, she's coming up right behind us. Oh, hello! I believe you have something of mine. Yeah, come and get it. Ooh! This girl can drive. Would you hurry up and lose her? I'm trying! Hang on, chumbo! I don't like this! Whoa! Mother Hubbard, this lady can really drive. Kid, fire! Do you see the fire? Dead end! Dead end! Not for me. Byebye, Shanky. Whoohoo! Oh, yeah! That's the stuff. Good job, kid. Oh, yeah, I feel like me again. One exit straight ahead. You're not gonna lose me that easy. How did you...? Uh, you might wanna keep your eyes on the road. Kid! Yo, Department of Noise, get out of my car! Oh, man, what are we gonna do? You just stay put, don't panic. I'm gonna talk to her. Ralph, be careful. It's fine. This is what heroes do. My bottom is stuck. This car is not designed for a big boy. I'll tell you that. Hi. You guys really thought you could just steal my car? Well, let me tell you what's gonna happen now. No, wait, listen. We aren't normally car thieves. My friend here, she's a candy kart racer. You should see her racing around her sweet little track... in her cookie wafer car we built together. And, well, the thing is, her perfect little game broke... and it was my fault... so we're here to try to fix it... and we need money to do that, and someone was gonna pay us money... to steal your car... Okay, okay. ...and so we took it. You can stop crying. Though I do respect your wonderful display of vulnerability. Thank you. I get it, I do. Friendship is everything to us, too. Right, guys? Word. We're like family. That's really great. So, does this mean we can keep your car? Absolutely not. But I do want to help. Hey, you got your phone on you? You know it. Let's make a video. Pyro, hit big boy with the blow and go. I'd love to. Wait. What's the...? What are you doing? Say something, first thing that comes to your mind. I'm gonna wreck it! Good. All right. Turn it off. Ow. What the heck did you do that for? Yeah. There are much better ways to make money on the Internet than stealing cars... such as becoming a BuzzzTube star. Am I supposed to know what that is? Oh, come on. Everybody knows BuzzzTube. It's the videosharing site. I'm just starting your account... All right, there you go. If this thing goes viral, you can make a lot of money. A friend of mine, chick named Yesss... she's the head algorithm over there. Tell her I sent you. Yesss will hook you up. Wow, that's really nice of you. I'm not sure if ""nice"" is the right word. Well, thank you. I should be thanking you, little sister. That race was fun. Oh. Well, thank you again. Uh... You know... While we're talking shop, what move did you do to get through that tunnel of fire? Was it a power drift into a drift jump, maybe, or...? Maybe. If you ever wanna come back for a rematch... I'd be happy to kick your butt again. See you. Whoa. Showoff. Man, oh, man, that place was scary. I know. It was so exciting! No, exciting is when you smile. Scary is when you clench your butt, and my butt is still clenched. Oh, come on, are you honestly telling me... that Shank lady wasn't the coolest person you ever met? Cool? Name one cool thing about her. Um, let's see, she looks cool, she talks cool... she drives cool, her hair is cool, her car is cool... Wait a minute, are you saying my hair isn't cool? What? No! I'm just saying the game was nextlevel. There was no one telling you what to do or where to go. Hey, just where do you think you're going? To BuzzzTube. It's this way. No, no, no. We're going back to Spamley's. He can give us some easier loot to find. No, we're supposed to see Shank's friend. Oh, come on. I don't trust that Shank one bit. Well, I do. Well, I... Hello, mister. Who are you? I'm your friendly ebay alert messenger. Huh. An actual eboy. Just here to let you know your bid expires in eight hours. Eight hours. Okay, thanks, eboy. You got it, Jackson! Chumbo, if we nickelanddime it with Spamley... it will take 20 years to make enough money to buy the wheel. All right, fine. We'll do it your way. But I'm telling you right now, that BuzzzTube place is a terrible idea. Man, there are all kinds of videos in here. Yeah, if you like babies and cats. Look, there's you! Oh, yeah. I'm gonna wreck it!  I wonder why those little guys are giving your video all those hearts? Because obviously they love me. I told you this place was a good idea. Yeah, sure you did, doof. Now, who we supposed to see about getting paid again? The head algorithm. Her name is Yesss. No. No. No. Uninspired, cliched... Ugh! YouTube's got this one. Chewbacca Dad? Really? Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom, but it's a daddy. No! Heyo! Are you the head of Al Gore? I am the head algorithm of BuzzzTube... which means I curate the content... at the Internet's most popular videosharing site. Which means, I don't have time to trifle... with every shoeless, mouthbreathing hobo that trundles into my office. Call security, Maybe. Yes. But, Yesss, this is the leaf blower guy. Who? The man with the undulating jowls. So? His video has 1.3 million hearts. Well! Why didn't you tell me I was in the presence of a genius? Grab him a drink. Yeah, this lady named Shank... she actually made the video. She's the one who told us to come see you. No wonder your video's so dope. Shank is for real cool. Right? She is not. I'm the cool one getting all the hearts. Well, that's right, you big baby. Yeah. Um, what'd you say your name was? Ralph, WreckIt Ralph. Well, WreckIt Ralph, you are trending! And these are for you. Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts. Hearts, hearts, hearts! Hearts, hearts, hearts! Yes! Hearts! Uh, not to buzzkill the lovefest you guys got going on here... but Shank kinda told us that viral videos can make, like, actual money? Oh, hearts are money, honey. Your Buzzzy account converts hearts into dollars. Kaching! Kid, we only needed $27,001. We're done. Oh, no, no, no. That's $43. 43? That's not even half of 27,001. And we only have eight hours left to save my game. Ugh. Well, I hate to say it, but that ain't happening. Your video is tapped out. But I thought I was trenching? Trending. You were. But that was 15 seconds ago. Now, you're not. Thanks for stopping by, though. Aw! What are we gonna do, kid? All right, pal, I have an idea. And hear me out. What if we go back to Slaughter Race  and I ask Shank really... No, no, no. We're not going back to that death trap. Yesss, what if I made you a whole bunch of videos... of me doing all kinds of them crazy things? You mean saturate the market? That could get you a lot of hearts fast. Have you thought this through at all? What do you plan on even doing in these videos? I'll just copy whatever's popular. Genius. Yo, Maybe, what's trending right now? Mmmhmm. Let's have a lookielookie. As usual, human suffering is number one... followed by hot pepper eating challenges... video game walkthroughs... oh, screaming goats are back... unboxings, cooking demos, makeup tutorials... and lastly, ugh, bee puns. Let's ""bee"" friends.  Two weeks in a row, guys. That's a fortnight of bee puns. He won't be doing any bee puns. They're beneath you. Oh, I'm doing a bee pun. Oh, yes, I am. And I'm eating a hot pepper, and I'm putting on makeup... and whatever else it takes! Because, kid, we came here to save your game and we're gonna do it. I love it! Ha! That is what the Internet was made for! Now, let's get to work. Seen it. Saw that one. Seen it. Seen it. Huh? Yo, McNeely, you remember WreckIt Ralph? That bad guy from the old video game? Yeah, exactly. I'm gonna send you a super random video. Check it out, dude. Yeah, I'll give it a heart. Whatever. Hey, everybody, welcome to Up To the Memeent!  I'm your host, Dani Fernandez. Nobody knows who's making them, but the whole world is going bonkers... over a series of truly bizarre videos... starring '80sera bad guy WreckIt Ralph. Check out what everyone is buzzing about... over at BuzzzTube.com.  Hey, guys, WreckIt Ralph here...  with the ghost pepper challenge.  Supposed to be spicy. We'll see about that.  Mmm. That's not so...  Oh, it's very hot! Oh, make it stop!  Yo, McNeely, another one just dropped. Check it out, dude. Where are these things coming from? Hey, Josey, did you see the pepper challenge? Oh, not yet. I'm watching the one where he just smacks his lips. It's disgusting. You don't want any real hard lines.  You just want to blend that out there, like this...  And that, my friends,  is how you achieve the perfect cat eye.  I always start  with the hootnanny. Shift it into a floss.  And now I finish with a hot Marat. Huh? Huh?  Follow along with me,  and I'm gonna give this little cloud a little friend...  in the form of a tree.  Everybody needs a friend.  Look at these guys.  Look at this one, sleeping under his ear.  You couch potatoes. Wake up.  We've been baking at about 950 degrees  now for six hours...  so she should be ready.  Voila! Burnt pie!  Let's have a little whiff  of this here.  My hair,  my hair! My hair!  This man is on fire. Literal and figurative fire. But he still needs 200 million hearts in the next five hours... or this beautiful child loses her game. That's why I'm on to phase two... you, my elite PopUp Army. I need you out there popping up... and getting clicks all over the Internet. I'm talking Tumblr, Instagram, Mashable. Be my pied pipers and lead that beautiful traffic to BuzzzTube... because WreckIt Ralph needs his hearts. Hey, mister! Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, you. You don't wanna miss this. It's the latest WreckIt Ralph video. Click it. Click it! Man oh Manischewitz, that looks so fun. Yesss, can I be a popup? I don't know. Can you be annoyingly aggressive? I don't know. Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Oh, yes, you're perfect. Here. Thank you! If you're going, I wanna go. No, baby, you've got to stay here and be my movie star. What? No, no, no. Me and the kid are like shoes and socks. Or peanut butter and bacon. One cannot exist without the other. Go on, kid, tell her. It's true. In fact, it's so true that we will be fine if we're apart for a minute. Come on, pal. It's my game we're trying to save. I just wanna get out there and be useful. But without me? What if you get lost? You're just a kid. Oh, and you're some mature adult? Well, I'm bigger. Don't be insecure, big fella. She's not gonna get lost. I promise. She'll be in my personal web browser. And your app comes with BuzzzFace... so you can keep in touch anywhere on the Internet. See, I'll be fine. I know, I just... We haven't been apart in like six years. I'm going to miss you. You'll be fine, too. The more hearts your videos get, the faster we'll get the wheel. And then we can go home. Look, we'll be celebrating at Tapper's this time tomorrow, buddy. Yeah, I guess you're right. Bye! Be careful, huh? Don't be a dummy. So where exactly are you sending her? Since candy girl comes from an arcade game... I'm thinking she'd be good in the gaming district. Oh, no, no, no, no. Bad idea. Those games are dangerous, and they rot your brain. Why don't we send her somewhere a little more totally different than that... and nowhere near there? Let's see. Family Friendly Fansites. That sounds safe, and she is technically a princess... so how about this one here with the sweet little pink castle? I love it. Okay, I'll redirect our newest popup to OhMyDisney.com. Jeez Louise, this place is bonkers! Whoa! To infinity and beyond! Aw, come on. Princesses and cartoon characters? Lame. Hey, easy there. Oh, I mean, no offense or anything. Well, time to get to work. And for your final question. ""My friends would describe me as?"" ""Smart, funny, kind, or brave.""  Um...  Kind, I guess? Based on your answers, your princess BFF is Snow White! I do believe our friendship will be the fairest of them all! Hey, wanna meet my BFF? It's WreckIt Ralph. Just click here to see his new video. Thank you. Yeah, um, in Captain America: The First Avenger... Red Skull refers to Yggdrasil,  the World Tree, Guardian of Wisdom and Fate.  Are we to believe, sir,  that you are a descendant of that tree?  I am Groot. Okay, okay. Thank you very much.  Um, what is Drax really like?  I am Groot. Thank you.  Yeah. Are you a conifer or a fruitbearing tree?  I... Excuse me. I'll take this one. He is Groot, I am Vanellope, click here to meet WreckIt Ralph. Eh, this is almost too easy. Hey, do you have a permit for that popup?  Uh... That's unauthorized clickbait. You're coming with us, kid.  Boop! She's getting away.  This way.  Ooh! Sorry, mister! Hey, can't you read? Cast members only! I think she went down this way. Come on.  Roger that.  Did you see a kid come through here?  She came running through here like a headless hen. Any sign of her?  No, maybe she went down  to the Air Bud pavilion.  Come on. Let's check it out.  Uh, hi! Whoa, whoa. Ladies, I can explain. See, I'm a princess, too. Wait, what? Yeah. Princess Vanellope Von Schweetz... of the, uh, Sugar Rush  Von Schweetzes. I'm sure you've heard of us. It'd be embarrassing for you if you haven't. Huh. What kind of a princess are you? What kind? Do you have magic hair? No. Magic hands? No. Do animals talk to you? No. Were you poisoned? No! Cursed? No! Kidnapped or enslaved? No! Are you guys okay? Should I call the police? Then I have to assume you made a deal with an underwater sea witch... where she took your voice in exchange for a pair of human legs? No! Good Lord, who would do that? Have you ever had True Love's Kiss? Ew! Barf! Do you have daddy issues? I don't even have a mom. Neither do we! And now for the milliondollar question. Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong man showed up? Yes! What is up with that? She is a princess! Who made your gown? I've never seen anything quite like it. Oh, this old thing? Oh, I'd so love to have one of my own. As would I. Me too! So cool. Best outfit ever! Ooh! I want one, too, you guys! I'll get my mice on this. So this is love. All hail Princess Vanellope, the queen of comfy! Yay, Vanellope! Of all the thingamabobs in this entire world... I never thought I'd get to wear a real... what's it called again? Oh, yeah. Shirt.  I once had a dream that I might wear a shirt...   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What's going on? Uh, she's singing. Yeah, but there was like music and a spotlight. Wait, you all saw it too, right? That's what happens when a princess sings about her dreams. Oh, that's never happened to me. I mean, not even once. Why don't you give it a try? What is it you really want? Sing about that. Okay. Uh, sure. Huh. I could do that. Um, let's see.  Oh, steering wheel Oh, steering wheel   Oh, yes I want a steering wheel   Well, there is a lot to unpack here. Mmmhmm. So, this steering wheel you sing of, that's a metaphor? Oh, no, no, no, it's not a metaphor. I just... I literally want a steering wheel. I think the issue is I was a little pitchy. Maybe a little. But sometimes your song can't start... until you go someplace to reflect. What works for some of us... is finding a form of water and staring at it. What? Oh, yes, I like to stare at a wishing well! I stare at the ocean. Horse trough. Soap bubbles! Wait, you're saying if I just stare at some water... Uh, important water. Right. Of course. ""Important water."" I stare at the important water... and somehow magically I'll start singing about my dream? For sure. Mmmhmm. Uh, yeah, I don't think so, ladies, but thanks. Five minutes, Princesses. Another ""Which Disney Princess Are You?"" quizlet starts in five minutes. Okay, thank you. Well, I guess it's back to the gowns, girls. It was lovely to meet you, Vanellope. And best of luck finding your song. Uhhuh. What did she just say? We don't know. We can't understand her. She's from the other studio. Ah. Hi, everybody. WreckIt Ralph here... with a little box I'm gonna open. Let's see what we got here. A ""Pancake Milkshake Fun Set."" Huh. Got a little heft to it. Something wobbling around in there. Wonder if we got the kitty or the bunny. Let's open it up. Man, who would've guessed a bee pun would be the thing to put us over the top? Huh. That's the Internet for you. All right, it is uploading. Hey, mister! Oh. Hi, eboy. Just here to let you know your bid does expire in 30 minutes. Thanks, little eboy. You got it, chairman. You hear that, Yesss? We don't have a lot of time left. Okay. We just gotta... No, no, no. No! Not you! What? Why are you angry at the lollipop? What does that mean? The file's not loading. If this doesn't load, we're not gonna make it. Hmm. You don't have enough hearts. Ralph, where are you going? I'm going down to the floor to get some hearts. Ah! Genius! Good thinking. Now, someone get me tech support in here, stat! Only one person. Hey, guys, come and check out my video, you're gonna love it. Right, right over here. Yep, here we go. What are you... You guys! Aw. A cat? You're gonna like this better than some dusty old cat. Aw. What? Give me that hose, partner. You know you love me, give me those hearts. There we go. Hey, folks, where are you going? Give my video a heart. That's it. Let's see who's in here. Hello? Anybody in here? What the heck is this place? Some kind of libary? ""WreckIt Ralph is back."" Hey, they're talking about me. Gee whiz, the Internet is so positive. ""FixIt Felix, Jr.  was my favorite game."" Hmm. Mine, too. ""Ralph's videos stink."" What? ""So stupid."" ""Ralph is the worst."" ""I hate him."" ""He's so fat and ugly."" ""Just a worthless bum, alone on a pile of bricks."" Yo, Ralph, you in here, dude? Hey, I got to show you... Oh. First rule of the Internet... do not read the comments. I should have told you that. Look. This place can bring out the worst in some people... but you gotta ignore all this. This isn't about you, Ralph. It's about them. I don't care. It's fine. People hated me my whole life for being the bad guy. It's just a good reminder that this is the only heart that really matters. Vanellope gave me this... and as long as she likes me... I don't need anybody else. And I sure don't need the Internet. Hold on. It's not all bad. The Internet can also be a place... where you find a steering wheel at one website... and make enough money to buy it at another one. Congratulations, Ralph. You did it. Wait, really? Yes, check your Buzzzy account. You needed 27K, you got over 30 grand! Oh, my gosh! This is great! Thank you, Yesss. I couldn't have done it without you! That's really true. Hey, eboy? What do you need, ace? Can you give me a ride? Let's hop along, Cassidy. Come on, song, come on. I'm reflecting. What is it that I want? What is my quest? What is my dream? Well, ladies, I tried. No song for this princess, I guess. Ooh! Huh. How does this thing work? Hey, kid, can you see me?  Yeah! Yeah, you're right there. We did it! We got the money!  No way, Ralph! That's great! I'm on my way to ebay right now with the eboy. We're almost there, champ. Good work, eboy. Hey, meet me out in front of ebay in five minutes, okay? Okay, I'll see you soon.  We're going home, kid! Our lives can finally get back to normal.  Whoohoo!  Wow, I can't believe it. I get to go home. So, I guess that's it. I guess I just wanted a... a steering wheel. And now, I got it, so... whoohoo. Slaughter Race?   What can it be that calls me to this place today?   This lawless car ballet?   What can it be?   Am I a baby pigeon sprouting wings to soar?   Was that a metaphor?   Hey, there's a dollar store   Look! I'm rhyming   My spirits climbing   As I'm called through this fog of mace   To this place called   Slaughter Race   Welcome back Watch your head   Hate to see you end up dead   Let's get this party rollin'   Is that appliance stolen?   We have   Fallen wires   Dumpster fires   Creepy clowns   And burning tires   That great white in the sewer   You'll be happy that you knew her   Fin bump!   Dogs and cats They sure taste great   With a side of license plate   Some find us deplorable   Well, I think you're adorable   We may be a motley crew But our hearts ring true   And just for you A face tattoo   Slaughter Race   My heart's in flight And wow, it's a blast   Feels like my dreams are real at last   No trace of a frown upon your face   Flying so fast   Setting the pace   Living the life   Loving the chase   Now is the time   Here is the place   This Slaughter Race!   I know I should go   But home feels so slow   These roads are paved with dreams   Happy dreams Not creepy clown dreams   What would Ralph say   If it turns out I stay?   In this place called   Slaughter   Race   In this place called   Slaughter   Race  That old, tired laptop  moving at a sloth speed? Bid on a new one today!  Do you wanna get rich playing video games? Click here to... Oh. Ralph. Ralph! Hey, there. Oh, hey, Spamley. What's the good word, brother? Well, the good word is I just paid for the steering wheel... and we are going home. Congratulations. Thanks. Hey, have you seen Vanellope anywhere? Oh, uh, your little chum? Uh, no, no, I haven't. Hope she's not lost. Let me try to reach her on this doohickey. See over there? Over that mountain? Yeah. That's the Sequoia Speedway. It's gonna be unlocked next month.  Hey, what are you doing in that awful game with her? I think the track will end...  right over there. Yo, it's gonna be so tight. Oh, I love it. Hey, can I tell you something that I don't think I could ever tell Ralph? Of course. I know it sounds crazy... but the second I walked into this game, it felt... Well, it felt like home. I mean, more than Sugar Rush ever did. Oh, yeah? How so? 'Cause it's like my dream. It's full of weirdos... and the racing is super dangerous... and you never know what's gonna happen next. I mean, back home, I know exactly what's gonna happen next... because Ralph's dream is to do the same thing every day. Hmm. Here's something I wish I'd learned years ago. There is no law saying best friends have to have the same dreams. You know? Whoa. Yeah. You are a very wise person, Shank. And a good friend, too. Thank you. Around here, peeps like to say, ""Shank you."" You know, after you go home and your life gets back to normal... you are always welcome here. But that's the thing, I want this to be my normal. I want this to be my life. I can't go home now. I just can't. Wow. You know, where I come from, that's called a kick in the face. I can't believe it. A straightup donkey kick to the teeth. She's supposed to be my best friend. No, this can't be right. No, she's been brainwashed. That's what this is. Because the Vanellope I know would never abandon me like that. I gotta get her out of there now. Hey, easy now, tiger. I admire the impulse... but you charge in there like some white knight... she's liable to hold it against you. So what? I'm supposed to just let her stay in a game that's obviously bad for her? Of course not. Then how do I make her leave? She thinks it's so cool and exciting in there. Unless you know how I can make the game boring or... Wait. You know about viruses and stuff, right, Spamley? Who's asking? Whoa. Back home, me and the kid used to goof off in this game called Tron.  But then it got a virus that made the motorbikes go slow... and then Vanellope stopped wanting to hang out in there. So, is there a way to do something like that to Slaughter Race?  Oh, there's ways. Follow me. I got mothers' maiden names... social security numbers, PIN numbers... Now, this area down here is what's called the Darknet. A lot of shady characters hang out down here... so try to keep a low profile. Gord! Oh, there you are. Now Gord here, he's dabbled in virusmaking. But his cousin, this guy we're gonna go see... Double Dan, this dude is a virusmaking machine. Oh, oh, here we go. Are you sure this is safe? Is it safe? Of course it is. Just whatever you do, do not look at his little brother. Oh, he has a little brother? Double Dan! Long time no see. Who are you? JP Spamley. Uh, we met one time over at Friendster... which tells you it had to be a long time ago. Oye. What are you looking at? Nothing. Are you looking at my brother? No, sir. Don't you look at my little brother. Oh, no, I wasn't. He's very selfconscious! You? What are you doing here? Uh... The reason I came to your neck of the face... I mean, there's a face in your neck. I mean, woods. Neck of the woods. The reason I'm here is 'cause I... Well, I heard a little tumor, rumor... I heard a rumor that you could, well, give me a harmless virus kind of thing... that might be able to slow down the Slaughter Ra game? Oh, yeah. My cousin Gordon told me that you wanted to crash it. Crash it? No! No, no, no. I don't want anyone getting hurt. Hmm. If there's a way to just, uh... I don't know... just make the cars go slow or something... so the game is boring... and my friend comes back home to me. Allow me to introduce you to Arthur. Easy there, boy. He's keen. Arthur's what I call an insecurity virus. Means he looks for little flaws and weaknesses that make a program insecure. You release him into that Slaughter Race game, Arthur will find some defect in the code. Then he'll copy that defect and spread it all over the game... until everything becomes, quote, unquote, ""boring""... just like you wanted. Okay. Just to be super clear here... no one gets hurt, right? Are you stupid? Well, uh... Because the only way anyone gets hurt... is if you are stupid. All you have to do... is make sure the virus stays in Slaughter Race.  Right. Don't be stupid. Make sure it doesn't get out of Slaughter Race.  Goiter it. Gah! Got it! Got it. Get out! Thank you, you're a cyst face. Out! I mean, assistance. Thank you for your cyst face... Assistance. Get out! Goodbye! Ugh. Ah! Fiddlesticks! Well, that's game. Ah, beginner's luck. Come on, kid. I know a hustle when I see one. Player's on the way. Thanks, Bob. Let's roll! Game faces on, guys. Show time. You ready for your first race? Um, yeah. I think so. Hey, don't be nervous. You're gonna be great. Yeah, no, I know. I'll be fine. Mmm. You didn't tell Ralph yet, did you? Not exactly. Come on, V. He's your best friend. You gotta let him know you're planning on staying here for a while. I know. But he's gonna get really upset. Yeah, he might, but you guys... you'll talk, you'll work it out, you'll figure it out. Yeah, but what if we don't? What if his feelings get hurt so bad... he won't wanna be my friend anymore? Look. All friendships change... but the good ones... they get stronger because of it. Uh, Shank, I hate to bother you... but the player is waiting. I'm not gonna tell you what to do, kid. It's your call. Yeah, okay. All right. Let's race. Scanning for insecurities.  Scanning for insecurities.  ""Precious Cargo.""  Deliver the car to Bert's Chop Shop...  but watch out for Shank and her crew.  Power drift into a drift jump! I saw it! You're amazing! Thank you. Scanning for insecurities.  Looks like we're not finished. Come on, V. Ralph? Huh. Okay. Relax. Relax! I'll just call him after the race. It'll be okay. Ralph will be fine.  Insecurity detected.  Copying insecurity.  Distributing insecurity.  Distributing insecurity.  Distributing insecurity. Distributing...  What is happening? What's going on, Spamley? The whole place is going crazy. I thought that virus was just supposed to slow down her car. It was. It must've found something real unstable in there. It's her glitch. Game reboot begins  in 60 seconds.  Whoa, hey! Hey, Ralph, you can't go in there. They're gonna reboot the game... and anything that doesn't belong in there will be deleted. Yeah, and if I don't get her outta there, Vanellope's gonna die! Come on, kid. The game's crashing. Let's go. I think it's my glitch. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to destroy your game. We'll be fine, but your code isn't part of this game. We got to get you out of here now. Follow me to the exit. Oh, no, no! Kid! Kid, where are you? The server is rebooting, Ralph. Both of you have to get out of here now. Kid, I got you. I got you. Game reboot...  in five, four, three...  two, one.  Reboot in progress.  Come on, Vanellope. Wake up. Come on. Don't leave me, kid. Ralph? Oh. There you are. You okay, kid? Ralph, I messed up so bad. No. No, you didn't, it's okay. This is all because of me and my glitch. I should've just stayed with you... instead of following some stupid dream. I've ruined everything. No, kid, no. Ah, look. I didn't mean for it to happen like this. It was not supposed to be this bad. You didn't mean for what to happen? I mighta, kinda sorta put a... harmless little virus in the game. A virus? You did this? I wouldn't have done anything if I hadn't heard you tell Shank... that you wanted to live in Slaughter Race forever. So you were spying on me? Hey. You're not exactly innocent here. You were gonna ditch everybody and abandon Sugar Rush.  Oh, please. I'm one of 16 racers. They'd never miss me. What about me? Why would I ever spend another second with you... after what you did? No! No. Vanellope, where are you going? Wherever you're not. Wait a minute. I can explain. No! You will not follow me. Vanellope, please... A friend would never do what you did. Never! So you leave me alone! Vanellope, no, no, no! Please! Please! What did I do? Scanning for insecurities.  Vanellope, come on, don't leave me!  Insecurity detected.  Copying insecurity.  Oh, no, no, no. Distributing insecurity.  Come on. Where is it? Ooh! Oh, no. You are such an idiot. What is your problem, Ralph? I told you, don't follow me. Friend? Cut that out. You're scaring me. Friend! Huh? Whoa! What the...? Friend? Friend! Sweet mother of Ralph! In breaking news,  the Internet is under assault...  as a massive denialofservice attack...  crashes servers across the web.  The WreckIt Ralph virus  is fastmoving and destructive.  Friend? Huh? Friend? Huh? Experts are still trying to understand who or what  the virus's intended target may be.  Friend. Friend. Friend! Friend! I found 130 results for ""Where does my high school girlfriend live now?"" You're welcome. Mr. KnowsMore! Hmm. Oh, delightful! You're that courteous little cherub who says ""please"" and ""thank you."" What can KnowsMore help you find today? There's a whole... Whole Foods, a hole in the ozone... A Whole Lotta Love by British rockers Led Zeppelin? No! No! There's a whole bunch of Ralphs chasing me. Friend... This would probably be an appropriate time for me to shutter my site. How long you think before they get in here? Precisely one second. Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! It's me! It's the real me! Ow! Ralph? My apologies. I followed those things here. I think they're looking for you, kid. Yeah, you think? What did you do? I'm so sorry. I don't how this happened. Well, I think it's fairly obvious. It happened because an insecurity virus cloned... all of your needy, clingy, selfdestructive behavior. The very behavior which left unchecked can destroy friendships... and in this particular case, the entire Internet! KnowsMore! You have all the answers. Official query... what do I do if clones of me are trying to capture my friend? Search. I find two results for your query. Either you put all the clones in therapy. Not very realistic. Or, the antivirus district is surrounded by a gate made from security software. If Vanellope could somehow lead all of the clones through the gate... they would be deleted all at once. Sort of a codependent pied piper situation. Wait. We know a pied piper. We do? Yesss. Who? Yesss! Yeah, but who is it? Oh, you mean Yesss! Thanks for your help, KnowsMore. It's a bit of an empty gesture at this point, wouldn't you say? Guess I forgot to tell Ralph that when you break the Internet... you don't literally have to break the Internet. I can't believe he did this. Yeah, well, I mean, dude obviously made some real questionable choices here. But he also made a bee pun to save his best friend's game... so what can I say, kid, life's complicated. You ready to pied the piper? Yoohoo! Up here! It's me, your bestest friend in the whole wide world... who you can't live without! Friend! Wow, from up here I can see how I do come across as... needy, and clingy, and selfdestructive like KnowsMore said. Listen, kid... I don't blame you for not wanting to be my friend anymore. I never said I didn't want to be your friend. I said you were acting like a bad friend. Which you were. I know I was, but I... Hey, my babies! That's the antivirus district straight ahead. Whoo! All right, to be continued, okay? Whoohoo! We're gonna make it! You guys okay? I'm fine! Yeah, all good. Look, we can still do this. Come on, big man. Help me turn this thing over. Uh... Uh, guys? Friend? That is unsettling. Friend. Get Vanellope out of here now. What about you, Ralph? Just go. I got a date with the man in the mirror. Hey, you! You keep away from her! I'm gonna wreck it! She's not your friend! She's my friend! Here it is, this way. Come on, kid. We gotta move. Eeeeeohboy! No! Whoa! Vanellope! Hey! Let go of me! Kid! Ralph! Hey! Hey, get back here! Huh? You put her down! Whoa! Vanellope! You know, you're acting like a real bad guy here! No! Well, you are! And I will never be your friend! Hey, doofus! Ralph! Catch me if you can, you big dummy! I got you, little sister. Now go! Get out of here! Ralph! Go! No! Don't hurt him! Please, no! Stop it! You're squishing him! You're gonna kill my best friend! Fine! You win! You win, okay? Just please put him down. I'll be your only friend, okay? Just let him go. No! No, kid. Huh? That's it. That's it. Yeah. Put him down and I'll go with you... and we'll be best friends forever. Just me and you. That's what you want, right? Well, that's not what I want! It's not right to hold a friend back from her dreams! You don't own her! That's not how friendship works! You need to let her go! Hey. You need to let her go. I know. It's gonna hurt a little bit when you do. Oh, who am I kidding? It's gonna hurt a lot. But you're gonna be okay. And we're gonna be okay. Right, kid? Of course we are. Always. See? No matter where she goes... or where she lives... she's always gonna be our friend. And we just gotta trust her. Because that's what best friends do. Right? Thanks, buddy. Wow! I feel good about this. Mmm. Mmm. Ralph, look! I think you fixed your insecurity! You're right. Whoohoo! Ralph, no! Whoa! Park it right here, Ralph! Your ol' pal JP Spamley's gotcha! Whoo! Wow, that didn't work. Look up there! It's a big strong man in need of rescuing. Hah! Mmm. Oh, thanks, Frogger. Wait a minute. Who are all of you? We're friends of Vanellope's. Yeah, and any friend of Vanellope's is a friend of ours. You're welcome. Ralph! Looking good, big fella! Heyo! This dress is not made for a big boy. It's going right up the back alley there. Let me just make a little adjustment. There we go. Internet users are breathing  a collective sigh of relief tonight.  Just as mysteriously as it appeared,  the WreckIt Ralph virus has vanished.  You know what I just realized? The sun never rises or sets here... because everything's always on. Well, now, isn't that an astute observation? I know, right? You know, other than KnowsMore, I'm probably the smartest guy on the Internet. Yeah. Yeah. Yo, V. We're about to come back online. You ready? Be right there! Hey, Ralph, don't be a stranger! Well, I can't be much stranger than you, Shank. Oh. That's a good dad joke. Hey, don't forget. You know Shank added my code and everything, so I'll be able to regenerate. I'm gonna be totally safe. No, I know. It's gonna be great. You found your dream game. Yeah, I did. I did. So, uh... I guess I should probably head in there now, you know? Oh, before you go, I wanted to give you this. Oh, I'm so sorry I broke it, Ralph. No, no. It's okay. Now we can both have a half. See? Yeah! I love you so much. I'm really gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too, kid. I really am. All right. Okay, getting a little clingy on me, here. Go on. Get out of here. The world's waiting for you, kid. I'll be honest,  it still feels kind of weird around here.  I mean, a lot has changed.  Even though we got that steering wheel  and saved Sugar Rush... it's never really gonna be the same.  For one thing, the racers aren't even  that obnoxious anymore.  Oh, golly. I'm sorry you didn't win, Taffyta. Pfft! Our friendship is much more important to me than winning, Rancis. Losing builds character! Everyone's a winner, Taffyta. Felix and Calhoun,  as goofy as they are,  they turned out to be pretty great parents.  I gotta hand it to you two, how on earth did you tame those things? It's simple, Surge. The key to parenting is... And then what you do is... And that is the secret to raising perfect children. Wow, I wish every parent could hear that. I'm keeping busy, too.  I finally joined Zangief's book club.  Good point, Bison. And how about you, Ralph? Do you feel Dostoyevsky intended to make narrator unreliable? Um... I do and I don't. You do, and you don't. Duality. That's really deep, Ralph. Thanks, Sonic. I don't know what I'm talking about. Oh. And we got this new thing we do every Friday night...  where we all go and hang out in a different game.  I actually hosted this week.  Heyo! Hope you're all hungry. I made burnt pie. What's burnt pie, WreckIt? Oh, it's just a pie that you burn. You can use any pie. You just leave it in the oven too long. Yeah, we really do have a lot of fun.  I guess that's pretty much all the news I got for you. Oh, man, your stories never disappoint, Ralph.  I just wish we could hang out sooner.  Yeah. Me, too. When did you say you were getting those days off? Uh, our upgrade starts on January 25th,  so, like, two months from now.  Oh, that'll go by in a flash. Oh, speaking of which... you want me to bring you anything from home when I come visit? Oh! You know what I cannot find  anywhere on the Internet?  A halfway decent  BurgerTime burger.  I've been talking them up to Shank and the crew.  And honestly, I think they're starting to think  I'm making it up.  All right, consider it done. I'll bring you guys a truckload. Well, sun's coming up already. Guess I better get to it. Yeah, me too.  Talk next week?  I shall await your call, madam. Then, adieu, adieu, farting is such sweet sorrow.  So long, stinkbrain.  Bye, kid. Hey. You doing okay there, Ralph? Yeah, I am, actually. I'm doing great. Come on, Felix. Let's get to work, buddy. Hey, Mo, did you like the movie, sweetie? Well, there was a scene in the trailer... that wasn't in the movie... and that makes me sad. Aw, that's too bad. Maybe playing your game will cheer you up. Okay. Pancake. Milkshake. Pancake. Pancake. Milkshake. Ooh, ooh, ooh. I wanna try, I wanna try!  My turn, my turn!  Pancake. Milkshake.  Milkshake. Milkshake.  Pancake. Pancake. Milkshake. Milkshake. I'm starting to understand why people like this game. Very zen. Hey, everybody, look what I found! More pancakes! Sweet! Let's speed it up. Pancake, pancake, pancake. Pancake, pancake, pancake. Pancake, pancake, pancake. Pancake, pancake, pancake. Eat, little bunny. Eat, eat, eat! Uh, Ralph, you might wanna try feeding the kitty for a little while. No, the kitty gets the milkshake. The bunny gets the pancake. And now, an exclusive sneak peek  of Frozen 2. Click here.   Never gonna give you up   Never gonna let you down   Never gonna run around and desert you   Never gonna make you cry   Never gonna say goodbye   Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you   Uhuh!  Why would I? I like you.  You guys still sticking around?  All right. Well, you're welcome to stay.  There's not really any more surprises, but, you know...  Good luck getting that song out of your head.  It's a real earwig.  Anyway, what else? Uh...  "
Tangled,Disney,2010,2010,Animation,"This is the story of how I died.  But don't worry, this is a fun story, and the truth is, it isn't even mine.  This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel.  And it starts with the sun.  Once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.  And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower.  It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.  Oh, you see that old woman over there? You might want to remember her.  She's kind of important.  Centuries passed  and a hop, skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.  The kingdom was ruled by a beloved king and queen.  And the queen was about to have a baby.  But she got sick.  Really sick.  She was running out of time,  and that's when people start to look for a miracle.  Or in this case, a magic golden flower.  Ah! I told you she'd be important.  Instead of sharing the sun's gift,  this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power  and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.  And all she had to do was sing a special song.  Flower, gleam and glow  Let your power shine  Make the clock reverse  Bring back what once was mine  What once was mine  You get the gist. She sings to it, she turns young. Creepy, right?   We found it! The magic of the golden flower healed the queen.  A healthy baby girl, a princess was born, with beautiful golden hair.      I'll give you a hint, that's Rapunzel.   To celebrate her birth,  the king and queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.   And for that one moment, everything was perfect.  And then that moment ended.  Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine  Make the clock...    Gothel broke into the castle, stole the child,  and just like that, gone!  The kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the princess.  For deep within the forest, in a hidden tower,  Gothel raised the child as her own.   Save what has been lost  Bring back what once was mine  What once was mine  Gothel had found her new magic flower,  but this time, she was determined to keep it hidden.  Why can't I go outside? The outside world is a dangerous place, filled with horrible, selfish people. You must stay here, where you're safe. Do you understand, flower? Yes, Mommy. But the walls of that tower could not hide everything.  Each year, on her birthday,  the king and queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky  in hope that one day their lost princess would return.   Ha! Hmm. Well, I guess Pascal's not hiding out here.  Gotcha!   That's 22 for me. How about 23 out of 45? Okay. Well, what do you want to do?  Yeah. I don't think so. I like it in here, and so do you. Oh, come on, Pascal. It's not so bad in there. Seven a.m., the usual  morning lineup  Start on the chores And sweep till the floor's all clean  Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up  Sweep again and by then it's, like, 7:15  And so I'll read a book Or maybe two or three  I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery  I'll play guitar and knit and cook and basically  Just wonder when will my life begin?  Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking  PapiermÃ¢chÃ©, a bit of ballet and chess  Pottery and ventriloquy, candlemaking  Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch Take a climb, sew a dress  And I'll reread the books If I have time to spare  I'll paint the walls some more I'm sure there's room somewhere  And then I'll brush and brush and brush and brush my hair  Stuck in the same place I've always been  And I'll keep wondering and wondering and wondering and wondering  When will my life begin?  Tomorrow night  the lights will appear  Just like they do  on my birthday each year  What is it like  out there where they glow  Now that I'm older  Mother might just let me go  Wow! I could get used to a view like this. Rider, come on! Hold on. Yep. I'm used to it. Guys, I want a castle. We do this job, you can buy your own castle.  Hay fever? Yeah. Huh? Wait! Hey, wait! Can't you picture me in a castle of my own? Because I certainly can. All the things we've seen, and it's only 8:00 in the morning! Gentlemen, this is a very big day! This is it! This is a very big day, Pascal.  I'm finally going to do it. I'm going to ask her. Rapunzel!  Let down your hair! It's time! I know, I know. Come on. Don't let her see you. Rapunzel! I'm not getting any younger down here! Coming, Mother!  Hi. Welcome home, Mother. Rapunzel, how you manage to do that every single day without fail. It looks absolutely exhausting, darling. Oh, it's nothing. Then I don't know why it takes so long. Oh, darling, I'm just teasing.  All right. So, Mother, as you know tomorrow is a very big day... Rapunzel, look in that mirror. You know what I see? I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady. Oh, look, you're here, too.  I'm just teasing. Stop taking everything so seriously. Okay. So, Mother, as I was saying, tomorrow is... Rapunzel, Mother's feeling a little rundown. Would you sing for me, dear? Then we'll talk. Oh! Of course, Mother. Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine  Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine  Heal what has been hurt Change the Fates' design  Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine  Rapunzel! So, Mother, earlier I was saying tomorrow is a big day, and you didn't respond. So, I'm just going to tell you, it's my birthday!  Tada! No, no, no. Can't be. I distinctly remember. Your birthday was last year. That's the funny thing about birthdays. They're kind of an annual thing.  Mother, I'm turning 18, and I wanted to ask... What I really want for this birthday... Actually what I wanted for quite a few birthdays now... Rapunzel, please, stop with the mumbling. You know how I feel about the mumbling. Blahblahblahblah. It's very annoying! I'm just teasing. You're adorable. I love you so much, darling.  I want to see the floating lights. What? I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights. Oh! You mean the stars. That's the thing. I've charted stars, and they're always constant. But these, they appear every year on my birthday, Mother. Only on my birthday. And I can't help but feel like they're meant for me. I need to see them, Mother. And not just from my window, in person. I have to know what they are. You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel... Look at you, as fragile as a flower  Still a little sapling, just a sprout  You know why we stay up in this tower  I know, but... That's right. To keep you safe and sound, dear  Guess I always knew this day was coming  Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest  Soon but not yet  Shh! Trust me, pet  Mother knows best   Mother knows best Listen to your mother   It's a scary world out there  Mother knows best   One way or another Something will go wrong  l swear  Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand  Cannibals and snakes, the plague  No! Yes. Also large bugs Men with pointy teeth  And stop! No more, you'll just upset me  Mother's right here Mother will protect you  Darling, here's what I suggest  Skip the drama Stay with Mama  Mother knows best   Mother knows best Take it from your mumsy  On your own, you won't survive  Sloppy, underdressed Immature, clumsy  Please, they'll eat you up alive  Gullible, naive Positively grubby  Ditsy and a bit... Well, hmm, vague  Plus, I believe, getting kind of chubby  I'm just saying 'cause I wuv you  Mother understands Mother's here to help you  All I have is one request  Rapunzel? Yes? Don't ever ask to leave this tower again. Yes, Mother. Oh. I love you very much, dear. I love you more. I love you most. Don't forget it You'll regret it  Mother knows best  Tata! I'll see you in a bit, my flower! I'll be here.   Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. This is bad. This is very, very bad. This is really bad. They just can't get my nose right. Who cares? It's easy for you to say. You guys look amazing.   All right. Okay. Give me a boost and I'll pull you up. Give us the satchel first.  I just... I can't believe that after all we've been through together, you don't trust me? Ouch.  Now help us up, pretty boy! Sorry, my hands are full. What? Rider!  Retrieve that satchel at any cost! Yes, sir!    We got him now, Maximus.     Come on, fleabag! Forward! No. No! Stop it! Stop it! Give it to me! Give me that! Ha!             Alone at last.   Huh.  Huh?       Hmm.    Huh? Okay, okay, okay. I've got a person in my closet. I've got a person in my closet.  I've got a person in my closet!  Too weak to handle myself out there, huh, Mother? Well, tell that to my frying pan.  Huh? Hmm. Hmm. Rapunzel! Oh! Let down your hair! One moment, Mother! I have a big surprise! Uh... I do, too! Ooh, I bet my surprise is bigger! I seriously doubt it. I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make hazelnut soup for dinner. Your favorite. Surprise! Well, Mother, there's something I want to tell you. Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight. Especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong. I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier. I hope you're not still talking about the stars. ""Floating lights,"" and, yes, I'm leading up to that. Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart. No, Mother, I'm just saying, you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there. Oh, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there. But if you just... We're done talking about this. Trust me! I know what I'm... Rapunzel. Oh, come on! Enough with the lights! You are not leaving this tower! Ever! Great. Now I'm the bad guy. All I was going to say, Mother, is that... I know what I want for my birthday now. And what is that? New paint. The paint made from the white shells you once brought me. That is a very long trip, Rapunzel. Almost three days' time. I just thought it was a better idea than the stars.  You'll be all right on your own? I know I'm safe as long as I'm here. I'll be back in three days' time.  I love you very much, dear.  I love you more.  I love you most.   Okay. Huh.   Huh? What...  Is this hair? Struggling... Struggling is pointless. Huh?  I know why you're here, and I'm not afraid of you. What? Who are you? And how did you find me?  Who are you, and how did you find me?  I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you. But may I just say... Hi. How you doing? The name's Flynn Rider. How's your day going? Huh?  Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider? All right, blondie. Rapunzel. Gesundheit. Here's the deal. I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came across your tower and... Oh! Oh, no. Where is my satchel? I've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it. It's in that pot, isn't it?   Huh? Would you stop that? Now it's hidden where you'll never find it. So, what do you want with my hair? To cut it? What? Sell it? No! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get out of it, literally. You... Wait. You don't want my hair? Why on earth would I want your hair? Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it. End of story. You're telling the truth? Yes! Hmm.    I know. I need someone to take me.  I think he's telling the truth, too. He doesn't have fangs. But what choice do I have?  Okay, Flynn Rider, I'm prepared to offer you a deal. Deal? Look this way.  Do you know what these are? You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess? Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars. Well, tomorrow evening, they will light the night sky with these lanterns. You will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely. Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you. That is my deal. Yeah.  No can do. Unfortunately the kingdom and I aren't exactly simpatico at the moment, so I won't be taking you anywhere. Something brought you here, Flynn Rider. Call it what you will, fate, destiny... A horse. So I have made the decision to trust you. A horrible decision, really. But trust me when I tell you this. You can tear this tower apart brick by brick, but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.  Let me get this straight. I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home, and you'll give me back my satchel? I promise. And when I promise something, I never, ever break that promise. Ever.  All right, listen. I didn't want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice. Here comes the smolder. This is kind of an off day for me. This doesn't normally happen. Fine! I'll take you to see the lanterns. Really? Oops. You broke my smolder.  Are you coming, blondie? Look at the world so close And I'm halfway to it  Look at it all so big Do I even dare  Look at me, there at last I just have to do it  Should l? No Here I go      Just smell the grass, the dirt Just like I dreamed they'd be  Just feel that summer breeze The way it's calling me   For, like, the first time ever I'm completely free  I could go running and racing  And dancing and chasing  And leaping and bounding Hair flying, heart pounding  And splashing and reeling and finally feeling  That's when my life begins  I can't believe I did this! I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I did this! Mother would be so furious. But that's okay. What she doesn't know won't kill her, right? Oh, my gosh! This would kill her. This is so fun! I am a horrible daughter. I'm going back. I am never going back! I am a despicable human being!  Best day ever!   You know, I can't help but notice you seem a little at war with yourself here. What? I'm only picking up bits and pieces. Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip. This is serious stuff. But let me ease your conscience. This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure, that's good. Healthy, even. You think? I know. You're way overthinking this, trust me. Does your mother deserve it? No. Would this break her heart and crush her soul? Of course. But you've got to do it. ""Break her heart""? In half. ""Crush her soul""? Like a grape. She would be heartbroken. You're right. I am, aren't I? Oh, bother. All right. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm letting you out of the deal. What? That's right, but don't thank me. Let's turn around and get you home. Here's your pan, here's your frog. I get back my satchel, you get back a motherdaughter relationship based on mutual trust, and voilÃ ,  we part ways as unlikely friends. No. I am seeing those lanterns. Oh, come on! What is it going to take for me to get my satchel back? I will use this.   Is it ruffians? Thugs? Have they come for me? Stay calm. It can probably smell fear. Oh!  Sorry. Guess I'm just a little bit jumpy. Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though.  Yeah, that would probably be best. Are you hungry? I know a great place for lunch. Where? Oh, don't you worry. You'll know it when you smell it.            A palace horse. Where's your rider? Rapunzel. Rapunzel!  Rapunzel! Let down your hair! Rapunzel?    Rapunzel? Rapunzel!   I know it's around here somewhere. Ah, there it is! The Snuggly Duckling. Don't worry. Very quaint place. Perfect for you. Don't want you scaring and giving up on this whole endeavor now, do we? Well, I do like ducklings. Yay!  GarÃ§on, your finest table, please!  You smell that? Take a deep breath through the nose.  Really let that seep in. What are you getting? To me, it's part mansmell and the other part is really bad mansmell. I don't know why, but overall it smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?  That's a lot of hair. She's growing it out. Is that blood in your mustache? Goldie, look at all the blood in his mustache! Good sir, that's a lot of blood!  You don't look so good, blondie. Maybe we should get you home, call it a day. Probably better off. This is a fivestar joint. If you can't handle this place, maybe you should be back in your tower.  Is this you?  Now they're just being mean. It's him, all right. Greno, go find some guards. That reward is going to buy me a new hook. I could use the money. What about me? I'm broke! Get back! Mine! Ruffians, stop! We can work this out! Hey! Leave him alone! Gentlemen, please! Give me back my guide! Ruffians!    Not the nose! Not the nose! Put him down! I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns because I've been dreaming about them my entire life! Find your humanity! Haven't any of you ever had a dream? I had a dream once.  I'm malicious, mean and scary  My sneer could curdle dairy  And violencewise my hands are not the cleanest  But despite my evil look And my temper and my hook  I've always yearned to be a concert pianist   Can't you see me on the stage performing Mozart  Tickling the ivories till they gleam  Yep, I'd rather be called deadly For my killer show tune medley  Thank you! 'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream  He's got a dream He's got a dream  See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem  Though I do like breaking femurs You can count me with the dreamers  Like everybody else I've got a dream   I've got scars and lumps and bruises Plus something here that oozes  And let's not even mention my complexion  But despite my extra toes And my goiter and my nose  I really want to make a love connection  Can't you see me with a special little lady?  Rowing in a rowboat down the stream  Though I'm one disgusting blighter I'm a lover not a fighter  'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream  I've got a dream  He's got a dream  I've got a dream He's got a dream  And I know one day romance will reign supreme  Though my face leaves people screaming  There's a child behind it dreaming  Like everybody else, I've got a dream  Thor would like to quit and be a florist  Gunther does interior design  Ulf is into mime Attila's cupcakes are sublime  Bruiser knits, Killer sews Fang does little puppet shows  And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns   What about you? I'm sorry, me? What's your dream? No, no, no. Sorry, boys. I don't sing. I have dreams like you No, really  Just much less touchyfeely  They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny  On an island that I own Tanned and rested and alone  Surrounded by enormous piles of money  I've got a dream  She's got a dream  I've got a dream She's got a dream  I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam   And with every passing hour I'm so glad I left my tower  Like all you lovely folks I've got a dream  She's got a dream He's got a dream  They've got a dream We've got a dream  So our differences ain't really that extreme  We're one big team  Call us brutal Sick  Sadistic And grotesquely optimistic  'Cause way down deep inside we've got a dream  I've got a dream I've got a dream   Yes, way down deep inside I've got a dream   I found the guards! Where's Rider? Where is he? I know he's in here somewhere. Find him. Turn the place upside down if you have to!   Go. Live your dream. I will. Your dream stinks. I was talking to her. Thanks for everything. I believe this is the man you're looking for. You got me! Sir, there's no sign of Rider.  Maximus!   What's he doing?   A passage! Come on, men. Let's go. Conli! Make sure those boys don't get away.  Play it safe or go get the crown?  I got a dream I got some dreams  Oh! Somebody get me a glass! Because I just found me a tall drink of water. Oh, stop it, you big lug.  Where does that tunnel let out? Knife! I didn't know you had that in you back there. That was pretty impressive. I know! I know. So... Flynn? Where are you from? Whoa! Sorry, blondie, I don't do backstory. However, I am becoming very interested in yours. I know I'm not supposed to mention the hair. Nope. Or the mother. Uhuh. I'm too scared to ask about the frog. Chameleon. Nuance. Here's my question, though, if you want to see the lanterns so badly why haven't you gone before? Uh...  Well...  Uh, Flynn? Flynn? Rider?  Run. Run! Who's that? They don't like me. Who's that? They don't like me either.  Who's that? Let's assume that everyone in here doesn't like me. Here.    I waited a long time for this.   Oh, mama! I have got to get me one of these! Ha!    You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done!  How about two out of three? Flynn!   Flynn, look out!  Ha! You should see your faces, because you look... ...ridiculous.  Come on, blondie! Jump!             It's no use. I can't see anything.   Hey, there's no point. It's pitchblack down there. This is all my fault. She was right. I never should have done this.  I'm so... I'm so sorry, Flynn.   Eugene. What? My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Someone might as well know.  I have magic hair that glows when I sing. What? I have magic hair that glows when I sing! Flower gleam and glow Let your power shine      We made it. Her hair glows. We're alive. I'm alive! I didn't see that coming. Eugene? The hair actually glows. Why does her hair glow? Eugene! What? It doesn't just glow. Why is he smiling at me?    I'll kill him. I'll kill that Rider! We'll cut him off at the kingdom and get back the crown. Come on! Or... Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails and think for a moment. Oh, please, there's no need for that.   Well, if that's all you desire, then be on your way. I was going to offer you something worth 1,000 crowns. Would have made you rich beyond belief, and that wasn't even the best part.  Oh, well. C'est la vie. Enjoy your crown! What's the best part? It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider. You're being strangely cryptic as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.  Sorry.  Just don't... Don't freak out.  Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine  Make the clock reverse  Bring back what once was mine  Heal what has been hurt  Change the Fates' design  Save what has been lost  Bring back what once was mine  What once was mine     Please don't freak out!  I'm not freaking out. Are you freaking out? I'm just interested in your hair and the magical qualities it possesses. How long has it been doing that exactly? Forever, I guess. Mother says when I was a baby, people tried to cut it. They wanted to take it for themselves. But once it's cut, it turns brown and loses its power. A gift like that, it has to be protected. That's why Mother never let me...  That's why I never left and...  You never left that tower. And you're still going to go back? No! Yes.  It's complicated.  So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh? Ah, yeah. Well... I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert. It's a little bit of a downer.  There was this book I used to read every night to all the younger kids. The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.  Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive, not bad with the ladies either. Not that he'd ever brag about it, of course. Was he a thief, too? Uh... Well, no. He had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do. He could go anywhere that he wanted to go. And for a kid with nothing, I don't know, I... Just seemed like the better option.  You can't tell anyone about this, okay? It could ruin my whole reputation. Ah. We wouldn't want that. A fake reputation is all a man has.   Well, I should... I should get some more firewood. Hey. For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider. Well. Then you'd be the first. But thank you. Well, I thought he'd never leave. Mother? Hello, dear.   How did you find me? Oh, it was easy, really. I just listened for the sound of complete and utter betrayal and followed that. Mother... We're going home. Now. You don't understand. I've been on this incredible journey, and I've seen and learned so much. I even met someone. Yes, the wanted thief. I'm so proud. Come on. Mother, wait. I think... I think he likes me. Likes you? Please, Rapunzel, that's demented!  This is why you never should have left  Dear, this whole romance that you've invented  Just proves you're too naive to be here  Why would he like you? Come on now, really  Look at you! You think that he's impressed?  Don't be a dummy, come with Mummy  Mother...  No! No? Oh, I see how it is  Rapunzel knows best Rapunzel's so mature now  Such a clever grownup miss  Rapunzel knows best Fine, if you're so sure now  Go ahead, then give him this! How did you...  This is why he's here Don't let him deceive you  Give it to him, watch, you'll see  I will! Trust me, my dear That's how fast he'll leave you  I won't say I told you so  No, Rapunzel knows best So, if he's such a dreamboat  Go and put him to the test  Mother, wait! If he's lying, don't come crying  Mother knows best  So, can I ask you something? Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand? Because I'm not going to lie. That would be stupendous. Hey, you all right? Oh! Sorry, yes. Just lost in thought, I guess. Here's the thing, superhuman good looks, I've always had them. Born with it. But superhuman strength. Can you imagine the possibilities of this? Patience, boys. All good things to those who wait.   Huh?  Well, I hope you're here to apologize.  No, put me down. Stop it! No! Let me go!  Give me him!  Stop, stop, stop!    Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy, boy. Easy! Settle down.  Easy, boy. Easy. Easy. That's it. Now sit.  Sit! What? Now drop the boot. Drop it. Aw! You're such a good boy! Yes, you are!  You all tired from chasing this bad man all over the place? Excuse me? Nobody appreciates you, do they? Do they?  Oh, come on. He's a bad horse! Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.  Isn't that right... Maximus? You've got to be kidding me. Look. Today is kind of the biggest day of my life, and the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.  Just for 24 hours, and then you can chase each other to your heart's content. Okay?   And it's also my birthday. Just so you know.             Excuse me. Sorry.     Thank you!  It's for the lost princess.      To the boats!  Hey, Max! What? I bought them. Most of them.  Where are we going? Best day of your life? I figured you should have a decent seat.  You okay? I'm terrified. Why? I've been looking out a window for 18 years, dreaming about what it might feel like when those lights rise in the sky. What if it's not everything that I dreamed it would be? It will be. And what if it is? What do I do then? That's the good part, I guess. You get to go find a new dream.  All those days  watching from the windows  All those years, outside looking in  All that time, never even knowing  Just how blind I've been  Now I'm here, blinking in the starlight  Now I'm here, suddenly I see  Standing here, it's, oh, so clear  I'm where I'm meant to be  And at last I see the light  And it's like the fog has lifted  And at last I see the light  And it's like the sky is new  And it's warm and real and bright  And the world has somehow shifted  All at once, everything looks different  Now that I see you   I have something for you, too. I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared. And the thing is, I'm not scared anymore. You know what I mean? I'm starting to. All those days chasing down a daydream  All those years, living in a blur  All that time, never truly seeing  Things the way they were  Now she's here, shining in the starlight  Now she's here, suddenly I know  If she's here, it's crystal clear  I'm where I'm meant to go  And at last I see the light  And it's like the fog has lifted  And at last I see the light  And it's like the sky is new  And it's warm and real and bright  And the world has somehow shifted  All at once, everything is different  Now that I see you  Now that I...  see you  Is everything okay? Huh? Oh, yes.  Yes, of course. I just... I'm sorry. Everything is fine. There's just something I have to take care of. Okay. I'll be right back.  It's all right, Pascal. Ah! There you are! I've been searching everywhere for you guys since we got separated. The sideburns are coming in nice, huh? Got to be excited about that.  Anyhow, I just wanted to say I shouldn't have split. The crown is all yours. I'll miss you, but I think it's for the best. Holding out on us again, eh, Rider? What? We heard you found something. Something much more valuable than a crown. We want her instead.  I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me. He did. What? No. He wouldn't. See for yourself. Eugene? Eugene! A fair trade. A crown for the girl with the magic hair. How much do you think someone would pay to stay young and healthy forever? No. Please. No! No!    Rapunzel! Mother?  Oh, my precious girl! Mother. Are you all right? Are you hurt? How did you... I was so worried about you, dear. So I followed you. And I saw them attack you and... Oh, my. Let's go before they come to!  You were right, Mother. You were right about everything. I know, darling. I know.   Look! The crown! Rapunzel. Rapunzel!  No! Wait, guys!  Rapunzel!  Let's get this over with, Rider. Where are we going? Oh. There. It never happened. Now, wash up for dinner. I'm making hazelnut soup. I really did try, Rapunzel. I tried to warn you what was out there. The world is dark and selfish and cruel. If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine, it destroys it.     How did you know about her? Tell me, now! It wasn't us! It was the old lady! Old lady?  Wait. No! Wait! You don't understand! She's in trouble! Wait! Rapunzel? What's going on up there?  Are you all right? I'm the lost princess. Please speak up, Rapunzel. You know how I hate the mumbling. I am the lost princess. Aren't I? Did I mumble, Mother? Or should I even call you that? Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself? Why would you ask such a ridiculous question? It was you! It was all you! Everything I did was to protect you.  Rapunzel! I've spent my entire life hiding from people who would use me for my power... Rapunzel! ...when I should have been hiding from you! Where will you go? He won't be there for you. What did you do to him?  That criminal is to be hanged for his crimes.  No. Now, now, it's all right. Listen to me. All of this is as it should be. No! You were wrong about the world. And you were wrong about me! And I will never let you use my hair again!   You want me to be the bad guy? Fine, now I'm the bad guy.  What's this? Open up! What's the password? What? Nope. Open this door! Not even close! You have three seconds! One... Two... Three. Huh? Frying pans! Who knew, right?       Head down. Head down. Arms in. Arms in. Knees apart. Knees apart. Knees apart? Why do I need to keep my knees apart...    Max! You brought them here? Thank you.  No, really. Thank you. I feel maybe this whole time, we've just been misunderstanding one another, and we're really just... You're right, we should go.  Max? Max! Max!     Okay, Max. Let's see how fast you can run. Rapunzel? Rapunzel, let down your hair! Rapunzel, I thought I'd never see you again. Huh?     Now look what you've done, Rapunzel. Oh, don't worry, dear. Our secret will die with him.  And as for us...  We are going where no one will ever find you again.     Rapunzel, really! Enough already! Stop fighting me! No! I won't stop! For every minute of the rest of my life, I will fight! I will never stop trying to get away from you!  But if you let me save him, I will go with you. No! No, Rapunzel. I'll never run. I'll never try to escape. Just let me heal him and you and I will be together, forever, just like you want. Everything will be the way it was. I promise. Just like you want. Just let me heal him. In case you get any ideas about following us.  Eugene!   I'm so sorry. Everything is going to be okay, though. No, Rapunzel. I promise. You have to trust me. Come on. Just breathe. I can't let you do this. And I can't let you die. But if you do then you will die. Hey. It's going to be all right. Rapunzel. Wait. Eugene... No!   What have you done? What have you done? No! No! No. No!      No, no, no. Eugene.  No! Look at me. I'm right here. Don't go. Stay with me. Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine  Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine  Rapunzel. What? You were my new dream.  And you were mine.  Heal what has been hurt Change the Fates' design  Save what has been lost  Bring back what once was mine  What once was mine    Rapunzel? Eugene? Did I ever tell you I've got a thing for brunettes?  Eugene!     Well, you can imagine what happened next.  The kingdom rejoiced, for their lost princess had returned.  The party lasted an entire week, and honestly I don't remember most of it.  Dreams came true all over the place.  That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world,  if you can believe it!  And this guy? He eventually found true love.  As for this guy, I assume he's happy. He's never told me otherwise.   Thanks to Maximus,  crime in the kingdom disappeared almost overnight.   As did most of the apples.  Pascal never changed.  At last Rapunzel was home. And she finally had a real family.  She was a princess worth waiting for.  Beloved by all, she led her kingdom with all the grace and wisdom  that her parents did before her.  And, as for me, I started going by Eugene again,  stopped thieving and turned it all around.  But I know what the big question is.  Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?  I'm pleased to tell you  that after years and years of asking and asking and asking...  I finally said yes.  Eugene.  All right, I asked her.  And we're living happily ever after.  Yes, we are. "
The Good Dinosaur,Disney,2010,2015,Animation,"Henry, it's time. Which one did you say moved? The one on the left. Aw. Aw. You're a Poppa. You're a momma. Hmm? You little sneak. Hello, Libby. Libby. Hmm? Hello, Buck. He's got your eyes. Get out of there, you little prickle bush. All right, this is gonna be a big one. Hmm? Hello, Arlo. Come on out. Look at you. Buck! Whoa! That's Clawtooth Mountain. And this is our farm. And we're all gonna take care of it together. What? Gotcha! Libby! Haha! Ooh! Haha. Gotcha back! Momma, I'm done watering. Good job, Libby. Buck, get back to your chores. What? Thanks, Buck. But I... I... You're all set. Can't I do something else, Momma? Get going. Okay. Who is that? Oh! Hey, Eustice. Aw, you stuck, little guy? Let me get that for you. You're free. Hello, move. Go find your poppa and your... Momma! Whoa. The river's not something to mess around with there, Arlo. Be careful. What's the problem? Poppa, Henrietta is the worst one in the coop! Yesterday you said Footless Fran was the worst. She's only got one foot. You don't have to like 'em, Arlo. You just have to feed 'em. That should do it. Now, this will keep them rotten critters from stealing our food because I made this silo 100% critterproof. Put your mark on there, Henry. You earned it. Yeah, Poppa, do it! Come on! Yeah! Only if your momma does it first. If anyone's earned a mark around here, it's her. Did you just put your mark higher than mine? What? No. It's just the angle you're looking at it. The ""angle,"" huh? Ooh, ooh. Me too! Me, me, me! My turn! My turn! Now hold on. It's not that easy. You've got to earn your mark by doing something big. For something bigger than yourself. Someday you'll all make your mark and I can't wait to see it. That is how you clear a field. Attaboy, Buck. He'll figure it out. Be just fine. Go on, Buck. You earned it. Good job, son. You've got it, Libby! Just a little bit more. Beautiful. You earned your mark, sweetheart. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Arlo! He'll get there. All right, you cluckers, you're about to get fed. Arlo. Huh? Come here. Buck! What happened? I came to help you with your chores. And then they attacked. You're gonna be okay. Tell Momma I love her. I see a light. I'll go get help! Oh, you should see your face! I should've known! Always got to mess me up. Me? You mess up your chores and everyone else's. You're such a coward. Buck! I ain't a coward. And I'm gonna make my mark. Just like you, and Libby, and everyone! You will, darling. You just need a little more time. Forget it. I didn't even want that dumb mark anyway. I got an idea. Arlo. Arlo. Wake up. Huh? Come with me. Uh... Where are we going? You'll see. Okay, now take a walk out there. By myself? Go on. Poppa. Poppa. Calm down. Breathe. Oh. Sometimes you got to get through your fear to see the beauty on the other side. Wow. I got a new job for you tomorrow. That is if you still want to make your mark. The dang wilderness critter's coming over the fence, eating our food, and I've had it up to my snout. If this keeps up, we won't have enough food to survive the winter. That's why you are gonna catch that critter. Then along comes a critter... And this is how you're gonna finish the job. When that critter's taken care of, you'll put your mark on the silo right next to mine. I'll take care of the critter, Poppa. It won't stand a chance. What are you doing, you bug? Get out of here. Huh! Move along, leaf. Move along. You're dead, critter. Okay. You're free. What are you doing? Just leave! Flee! Stay back! Go! Whoa. Arlo! Why'd you let it go? It was biting, and coming at me, and screeching, and... You had a job to do. You got to get over your fear, Arlo, or you won't survive out here. Come on. We're gonna finish your job right now. Out there? Get over. But, Poppa, what if we get lost? As long as you can find the river, you can find your way home. What do you see? Uh, tracks? And they're washing out, we got to move! We're losing it! Arlo, keep moving! Poppa, wait. Arlo, what did I say about keeping... It's okay. It's okay, Arlo. I'm sorry. I just wanted you to get through your fear. I know you have it in you. But I'm not like you. You're me and more. I think we went far enough today. Storm's getting worse. Let's get you home. Arlo, move! Run, Arlo! Poppa! Poppa! Poppa! Poppa! Momma! If we don't get this harvest in before the first snow, we won't have enough food for winter. I know it's hard without Poppa, but I need you to do more, Arlo. Don't worry, Momma. I won't let us starve. You're a good son. Huh? You! Huh? You've got some nerve coming here. It's all your fault! My poppa would still be alive if it weren't for you! Help! Momma! Momma! Momma! Momma? Momma! You! I should've killed you the first time. This is all your fault. Get over here. Get over here. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away! That's right. You better run! Where am I? Where's home? Oh. As long as you can find the river, you can find your way home. You again? Get out of here. Ugh! I told you to stay away from me. I am still gonna squeeze the life out of you. But before I do, can you find me some more? Uh, here, more of these. You know... No. Stop. What are you doing? Hey, wait. Can you take me to the berries? Where are you going? I knew it. I'm gonna die out here. Because of you. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? No, no, no. Stop! Hey. Hey. No. Stop! Ooh. Ow. Ow. Why you little... Come back here! Berries! Oh! What's with you? They're right here. Crazy critter. Hello. Hello? We've been watching you. We thought you were going to die, but then you didn't. That creature protected you. Why? I don't know. I'm going home. Do you know how far Clawtooth Mountain is? Good idea. We want him. Why? Because it's terrifying out here. He can protect me like my friends. This is Fury. He protects me from the creatures that crawl in the night. This is Destructor. She protects me from mosquitoes. This is Dream Crusher. He protects me from having unrealistic goals. And this is Debbie. Yes, we need him. What is his name? A name? I don't know. Hmm. Then I will meditate on this. Hmm... I name him, I keep him. Hmm... Killer. Hmm... Beast. Hmm... Murderer. Hmm... Uh... Grubby! Funeral Planner? Uh, Cootie! Hmm... Hemorrhoid. Uh, Squirt! Uh, Frank! Stinky! Maniac! Funky! Violet. Spike! Lunatic. Spot! Spot! Come here, Spot. Come here. He is named. You clearly are connected. Good for you. On your path to Clawtooth Mountain that creature will keep you safe. Don't ever lose him. No. No. You can't have him, Debbie. No, no, no. Debbie! Debbie! Stop! You're better than this. No, no, no! Come back! Debbie! Where are you going? I need to get home. Ow! Huh? Ugh... Spot, watch this. Oh. Huh? Huh? I miss... I miss my family. Family. That's me. There's Libby. And Buck. And Momma. And... And Poppa. Family. Huh? You don't understand. That's okay. Yes. That's your family. I miss him. Oh... We should stop. Stop! Arlo, move. Run, Arlo! Where's the river? I've lost the river. I'm never getting home. I'm never getting home. Help! Help! Help! Aw, say, friend, are you wounded? No. I'm not hurt. Oh, good. Thank goodness for that. Uh, Coldfront, Downpour, keep looking for wounded folk. Wait. I'm lost. I need to get home. Clawtooth Mountain. Uh... Clawtooth Mount... Oh, you mean the mountain range with the three points. Yes! Yeah! Oh, yeah. I've been there. Uh, but you know, kid... Mmm. You're not even close. Still, I know the way. My name's Arlo. I'm sorry. I just... I used to have a name like that once. That was before I started following the storm! The storm? The storm swept me out. I was afraid for my life, but the storm gave me a relevation. And I wasn't scared anymore. You mean a revelation? No! A relevation. Okay? I was at a real low point. You know? And the storm swept me up to a real high point, and then left me at a higher relevation. Wow. Yeah, wow. That's when the storm gave me my new name because... What do we say? The storm provides. The storm provides. You can call me Thunderclap. Thunderclap. Can you help me get home? Uh, yeah, well... Uh, maybe. Oh! But first, we just need to check the area. There's plenty of folks in a bad way after a storm like this, don't you know? Uh, Thunderclap, I found someone! Over here! You know, we could use your help, friend. Uh... Whoa! Yeah! That is great. It's a critter. Ah! A freed critter. Thanks to you. You know, I just want to take a moment and thank the storm for this meal. Don't think you can mess with me. I've seen the eye of the storm! And I forgot what fear is! I'm not afraid of anything. No, I didn't say you were. Hey, where are you going, friend? I'm... I need to get home. And I said we would get you home. Friend, you have a critter of your own. Oh, I smell it. One of the juicy ones. Where is it? He's hiding. Over there. By that big rock. The storm provides. No! Spot! Get him! Hey, slow down. There's no place to hide, yellow belly. Come back with that critter! Help! Help! Help! Hey, you okay, kid? Yes. I hate those kind. Lying sons of crawdads picking on a kid. Well, ain't you just the cutest thing. He likes you. Imagine that, Ramsey. Even with your stinky face. Nash! Boundaries. This is my personal bubble. Nah, that ain't your bubble. This is your bubble. Nash, get out of your sister's bubble. You got no business being out here. Yes, sir. I don't. I'm trying to get home, but I lost the river. Please, my momma needs me. Take it easy, kid. Do you know where the river is? What river? There's tons of rivers around these parts. By Clawtooth Mountain. It has three points. Don't know that one. We're heading south to a watering hole. Come with us. Someone there might help you. We ain't got time for babysitting, we got longhorns to round up. My genius brother lost our whole herd in one day. I did not lose them, Ramsey. How many times I got to tell you this? They just wandered off. We still got to find them. We can't help you, kid. Wait! But what if we could help you? Spot can sniff out anything. I've seen him do it. He can find your longhorns. Hey! Come on, Spot. Sniff it out, boy. Good boy, Spot. He's got something. Aw, dang. Hey, kid, if you're pulling my leg, I'm gonna eat yours. He found the herd. Whoowhee! We got 'em. Wait, do longhorns have feathers? Rustlers. Rustlers? We got to move. Yah! I don't see any rustlers. They're out there. So, how far did you say that watering hole was? I got a job for you. I'm not really good at jobs. I need you to keep on the dodge and sidle up the loblolly, past them hornheads just hooting and a hollering, and score off them rustlers. We'll cut dirt and get the bulge on them. What? He just wants you to get on that rock and scream. Uh, but who's out there? They'll come right at you. You hold your ground. Don't move. Don't move? What if they have claws and big teeth? Don't overthink it. Howdy. What are you up to, boy? Nothing. Nothing? Oh! What's your name? Uh, Arlo. Well, Arlo, you don't look like you're doing nothing. What's he look like he's doing to you, Lurleane? Oh, come on, Bubbha. Ask me. Ask me what I think they're doing. Pervis, shut your mouth! Ah, looks like he's trespassing. And what do we do with trespassers? Tell them, Earl. We kill them! I got you! Nash, the herd! Yah! Yah! Yah! Giddy up. Come on now. Giddy up! Yah! Watch out! Nobody steals our longhorns. Finders keepers. Yeeha! Come on now. Momma wants to play with you. I know you're there. I can smell you. Oh. Oh, shoot! That's my favorite tooth! I'm gonna love ending you! Come on, we got to drive this herd out of here. Yah! Come on now. Aren't you the cutest? You and that critter showed real grit today. We could use that critter. How about we trade? I'll give you my harmonica for him. Thanks, but Spot ain't for trading. Come here, Spot. Come here. Your loss. That's a good one. Gonna scar up real good. That's nothing. Look at this! I run into 15 outlaw stegos. They're all bigger than me and meaner than me. What happened? Fought 'em off, of course. Was winning, too. Then one gets his dang spikey tail stuck in my foot and pulls! Whoa. Still can't feel my toes. Which comes in handy when you're kicking piles of bull... She's jealous. Jealous? Ha! Once a stampede of longhorns was coming right at me, but my tail was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I was dead for sure. So I chewed the dang thing off! Who does that? Nobody does that! You're crazy! I'm surprised you don't have one right across your face. Butch, how'd you get your scar? I don't know if you're ready for that story. I can take it. Oh, yeah. You got to tell him, Pa! That's a good one! It was 100 degrees in the shade. I walked for five days with no water. Then I saw it. A pretty pond. I bent down to take a drink, when these crocs launched out of the water. One croc bit me on the face. Ain't no way I wasn't its supper except for one thing, I wasn't ready for dying that day. I bit one croc in half, tailwhipped the other, and the last one... Well, I drowned that croc in my own blood. Whoa. Dang! Ooh! Look, look, gives me little goosies every time. I love that story! Show him your souvenir. Ain't that just too good? Can I touch it this time? No. Huh. You guys would have liked my poppa. He wasn't scared of anything. I'm done being scared. Who said I'm not scared? But you took on a croc! And I was scared doing it. If you ain't scared of a croc biting you on the face, you ain't alive. Listen, kid, you can't get rid of fear. It's like Mother Nature, you can't beat her or outrun her, but you can get through it. You can find out what you're made of. The first snow. It's early this year. And I got to get home to Momma. We'll get you to that watering hole. A deal's a deal. At first light, we ride. Let's go! Yah! Hey, kid, head 'em off before those longhorns split. Yah! There it is! Clawtooth Mountain! There's home! Whoowhee! We've got to drive this herd down south. You hurry on back to your momma. And don't stop for nothing! Thanks! I sure appreciate you looking out for me! You'll be all right. You're one tough kid. Oh! Whoa! Whoohoo! Whoo! Whoa. Wow. It's so close. We're almost there, Spot! We need to get home. You're gonna love it, Spot. You'll have a warm place to sleep. Right next to me. And all the corn you can eat. There's lots of space to run around. It'll be your farm, too. We'll all look after it together. I can't. No! Spot! Spot! Spot! No! Spot! Poppa? Poppa? You're alive? I can't believe it. It's you. My friend! Spot! He helped me and now he's in trouble. We have to go back. Poppa, stop. Stop! Poppa? You're not here. I'm scared. But Spot needs me. I blamed him for what happened to you, but it wasn't his fault. So I got to go help him. Because I love him. I knew you had it in you. You're me and more. Now go take care of that critter. Back off! Well, look who got relevated. Go get him. Spot. Spot! The storm provides. Spot! Spot! Spot! We're home, Spot. Henry? Arlo. Arlo!"

Andy's going to college any day now. That was our last shot. We're going into attic mode, folks. Keep your accessories with you at all times. Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition. Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done! Finished! Over the hill! Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys. We all knew this day was coming. Yeah, but now it's here. Look, every toy goes through this. No one wants to see... Hey, Sarge! What are you doing? War's over, folks. Me and the boys are moving on. Moving on? You're going AWOL? We done our duty. Andy's grown up. And let's face it, when the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go. Trash bags? Who said anything about trash bags? It has been an honour serving with you. Good luck, folks. You're gonna need it. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait! We're getting thrown away? No. No one's getting thrown away. How do you know? We're being abandoned! We'll be fine, Jessie. So why did Sarge leave? Should we leave? 1 thought we were goin' to the attic. Hate all this uncertainty!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet! No one's getting thrown out, okay? We're all still here. I mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way. Wheezy and Etch and... Bo Peep? Yeah. Even Bo. All good toys who've gone on to new owners. But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us! He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here. You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm... And we'll all be together. Exactly! There's games up there, and books, and... The racecar track! The racecar track. Thank you! And the old TV. There you go, the old TV. And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right? Yeah. And someday, if we're lucky, Andy may have kids of his own. And he'll play with us then, right? We'll always be there for him. Come on, guys. Let's get our parts together, get ready, and go out on a high note. I'd better find my other eye. Where'd you leave it this time? Some place dark. And dusty. Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay. Don't worry. Andy's gonna take care of us. I guarantee it! You guarantee it, huh? I don't know, Buzz. What else could I say? Well, whatever happens, at least we'll all be together. For infinity and beyond. Can I have your stereo? 'NO. Why not? 'Cause I'm taking it with me. Can I have your computer? 'NO. Your video games? Forget it, Molly. Okay. Andy, let's get to work here. Anything you're not taking to college either goes in the attic, or it's trash. Mom, I'm not leaving till Friday. Come on. It's garbage day. Mom. Look, it's simple. Skateboard, college. Little League trophy, probably attic. Apple core, trash. You can do the rest. Why do you still have these toys? Molly, out of my room! Three more days and it's mine! Molly, you're not off the hook either. You have more toys than you know what to do with. Some of them could make other kids really happy. What kids? The children at the daycare. They're always asking for donations. What's daycare? Mom. No buts. You choose the toys you want to donate, I'll drop them off at Sunnyside. Poor Barbie. I get the Corvette. Andy, come on. You need to start making decisions. Like what? Like what are you gonna do with these toys? Should we donate them to Sunnyside? No. Maybe sell them online? Mom, no one's gonna want those old toys. They're junk. Fine. You have till Friday. Anything that's not packed for college or in the attic is getting thrown out. Whatever you say, Mom. What's happening? We're getting thrown out, you idiot. That's what's happening. You need a hand? 1 got it.  Here. So, you gonna miss me when I'm gone? If 1 say no, do I still get your room? Nope. Then, yes, I'll miss you. I can't breathe! This can't be happening! Quiet! What's that sound? Andy! That's not trash. That's not trash! Think, think, Woody. Think, think, think. Buster! Come here, boy! Come here! Okay, boy. To the kerb! No, Buster! No! Get up. Buster! We're on the kerb! I knew it would come to this! Pull, everyone! Pull! It won't rip! Forget it! It's tripleply, highdensity polyethylene! There's gotta be a way out! Andy doesn't want us. What's the point? Point. Point. Point! Push! Push! I can hear the garbage truck! It's getting closer. Buzz! Jessie! Andy threw us out. Like we were garbage. Junk. He called us junk. How could he? This doesn't make any sense. I should have seen this coming. It's Emily all over again. Sarge was right. Yeah, and Woody was wrong. Wait a minute. Wait, hold on. This is no time to be hysterical. It's the perfect time to be hysterical. Should we be hysterical? No! Yes! Maybe! But not right now! Fellas, I know what to do. What the heck? We should've done this years ago. Jessie, wait. What about Woody? He's fine, Buzz. Andy's taking him to college. Now we need to go! You're right. Come on. Buzz? Woody! What's going on? Don't you know this box is being donated? It's under control, Woody. We have a plan. We're going to daycare! Daycare? What, have you all lost your marbles? Well, didn't you see? Andy threw us away. No, no, no, no. He was putting you in the attic. Attic? So how did we end up on the kerb? That was a mistake. Andy's mom thought you were trash. Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag. And called us junk! Yeah, I know. It looks bad. But, guys, you gotta believe me. Sure thing, college boy! Andy's moving on, Woody. It's time we did the same. Okay. Out of the box. Everyone, right now! Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand. We gotta get this thing outta here. Woody, wait. We need to figure out what's best for everyone. Great. Great! It's gonna take us forever to get back here. It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay. Well, Molly and I have been growing apart for years. It's just... I can't believe she would throw me away! Welcome to the club, toots. Okay, everyone, listen up. We can get back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast. We'll hide under the seats till we get back home. Get it through your vinyl noggin, Woody. Andy doesn't want us any more. He was putting you in the attic! He left us on the kerb! All right, calm down! Both of you! Okay, fine. Fine. Just wait till you see what daycare's like. Why? What's it like? Daycare is a sad, lonely place for washedup old toys who have no owners. Quite the charmer, aren't ya? You'll see. As soon as we get to daycare, you'll be begging to go home. Can anyone see anything? There's a playground! Wow! We hit the jackpot, Bullseye! So much for sad and lonely, huh? Okay. Calm down, guys. Let's just keep this in perspective. Perspective? This place is perfect. Woody, it's nice! See? The door has a rainbow on it. Hey there! Wow! Haven't seen you in ages. I just wanted to drop these old toys off. Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are. Say hi, sweetie. Hi. Hey, how are your kids? Molly and Andy? Not kids any more. Andy's going to college on Friday. What? Can you believe it? You sure they won't miss these? No, they never get played with. You see any kids? Where is she taking us? Look! Wow! What? What is it? No, no, no. What's the matter with you? I can't see! Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on! So how what do we do? We go back to Andy's. Anyone see an exit? Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with. Careful. These toys might be jealous of new arrivals. I want to see! Hey! Rex! It's my turn! New toys! Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya. Buzz Lightyear at your service. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Thank you. May 1? The claw! Well, hello there. I thought I heard new voices. Welcome to Sunnyside, folks. I'm Lotso'Huggin' Bear. But please call me Lotso. Buzz Lightyear. We come in... First thing you gotta know about me, I'm a hugger. Look at you all. You've been through a lot today, haven't ya? It's been horrible. Well, you're safe now. We're all castoffs here. We been dumped, donated, yardsaled, secondhanded and just plain thrown out. But just you wait, you'll find being donated was the best thing that ever happened to ya. Mr Lotso, do toys here get played with every day? All day long. Five days a week. But what happens when the kids grow up? Well, now, I'll tell ya. When the kids get old, new ones come in. When they get old, new ones replace them. You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means no heartbreak. It's a miracle. And you wanted us to stay at Andy's. Because we're Andy's toys! So you got donated by this Andy, huh? Well, it's his loss, Sheriff. He can't hurt you no more. Whoa, whoa, no, no, no... Now, let's get you all settled in. Ken? Where is that boy? Ken? New toys! Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso. So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour? Let's show our new friends where they'll be staying. Folks, if you want to step right this way... Hi, I'm Ken. Barbie. Have we ever met? I would've remembered. Love your legwarmers. Nice ascot. Come on, Ken. Recess don't last forever. Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody. You got a lot to look forward to, folks. The little ones love new toys. What a nice bear. And he smells like strawberries. Folks, if I can share, here at Sunnyside, we've got, well, just about anything a toy could ask for. Spare parts, superglue, and enough fresh batteries to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo. Think you're gettin' old? Wow. Well, stop your worryin'. Our repair spa will keep you stuffed, puffed, and lightly buffed. And this, well, this is where I live. It's Ken's Dream House. It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy. And a whole room just for trying on clothes. You have everything! Everything except someone to share it with. You need anything at all, you just come talk to me. Here we are. Well, thank you, Big Baby. Why don't you come meet our new friends? Poor baby. We were thrown out together, me and him. Abandoned by the same owner. But we don't need owners at Sunnyside. We own ourselves. We're masters of our own fate. We control our own destiny. Watch out for puddles. And here's where you folks'll be stayin'. The Caterpillar Room. Look at this place. Wow! Holy moly guacamole. Jackpot, baby. Whoa, puppy! Hello. Hello. Hello. It's so beautiful! What the... Hey, little guy. How long's it been since you all got played with? It's been years. Well, just you wait. In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring, and you'll get the playtime that you've been dreamin' of. Play! Real play! I can't wait! Now, if you'll excuse us, we best be headin' back. Welcome to Sunnyside, folks. Thank you. Take care, pinky. Goodbye, Mr Lotso. Thank you. Thank you, buddy boy. Will I see you again? I'll see you tonight in my dreams. Ken, let's get a move on. Barbie, come with me. Live in my dream house. I know it's crazy. I know we just met. Heck, you don't know me from G.l. Joe, but when I look at you, I feel like we were... Made for each other. Made for each other. Yay! Yes. Ken? Coming, Lotso. This is so exciting! Sounds like kids to me. I want to get played with. Why can't time go faster? How many you reckon are out there? They sound so sweet. Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit. But we need to go home. We can have a whole new life here, Woody. A chance to make kids happy again. Why don't you stay? Yeah, Woody. Stay with us. Come on, Woodster! You'll get played with. I can't. No. Stay here. You can make a new kid happy. No, no. Guys, really. No! I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy! And if he wants us at college, or in the attic, well, then, our job is to be there for him. Now, I'm going home. Anyone who wants to join me is welcome. Come on, Buzz. Buzz? Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody. What? And what's important now is we stay together. We wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Andy! Look under your boot, Buzz. You, too, Jessie. Whose name is written there? Maybe Andy doesn't care about us any more. Of course he does. He cares about all of you! He was putting you in the attic. I saw. You can't just turn your back on him now! Woody, wake up! It's over! Andy is all grown up! Okay, fine. Perfect. I can't believe how selfish you all are. So this is it? After all we've been through. Bullseye, no. You need to stay. Bullseye, no, I said, ""Stay!"" Look, I don't want you left alone in the attic, okay? Now, stay. Bonnie? Bonnie? I gotta go. Bonnie, you in here? Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no. What... What the heck? Now, that's better. Bonnie! Bluebells, cockleshells... There you are. Come on, honey. It's time to go home. No, no, no, no! Reach for the sky! Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny... You're my favourite deputy. Bonnie! Coming! Great. It's gonna be okay, Bullseye. Woody's going to college with Andy. It's what he's always wanted. He's crazy. College is no place for a toy. Toys are for playtime. Speaking of playtime, they're lining up out there! How many? There must be dozens. I can hardly wait! Places, everyone! At last! I'm gonna get played with! Rex? Come to papa. There's a snake in my boot. I'd like to join your posse, boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song.  A sheriff! Move over, Mr Pricklepants. We have a guest. You want some coffee? It's good for you. But don't drink too much, or you'll have to... Be right back! Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me. Can you tell me where ll am? The guy's just asking a question. Well, excuse me. I'm trying to stay in character. My name's Buttercup. You've met Baron von Shush. Hello, I'm Trixie. Guys, hey. Guys, look, ll don't know where I am. We're either in a cafÃ© in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey. I'm pretty sure I just came back from the doctor with lifechanging news. We do a lot of improv here. Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine. No, no, no, no. I... Who wants lunch? It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans. Somebody's poisoned the water hole. Poison? Who would do such a mean thing? The scary witch! Look out! She's using her witchy powers! ""I know where to hide."" She'll never find us in here. What's wrong? She found us! We need a spaceship to get away from the witch! You're doing great! Are you classicallytrained? Look, I just need to know how to get out of here! There is no way out. Just kidding. Door's right over there. Well, cowboy, you just jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly. Woody. Woody? Really? You're gonna stick with that? ""Cause now's your chance to change it, new room and all. That's coming from a doll named Dolly. Who's the new guy? Are you a real cowboy? Well, actually... 'Course he's not, pea brain. He don't even have a hat. I do too have... My hat! Told ya. Found a spaceship!  Showtime. Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts. Close your tray tables. Hold on. It might get a little bumpy. Three, two, one, blastoff! You saved us, cowboy. You're our hero. I got a kink in my slink. My tail! Where's my tail? Someone need a hand? Where's my nose? Here it is. Here's your arm. Give me that. That's mine. Honey, the moustache? I don't recall playtime being quite that strenuous. Andy never played with us like that. We're just gonna have to make the best of it. But these toddlers, they don't know how to play with us. They're too young! Yeah, they're sticky. Well, we should be in the Butterfly Room. With the big kids! That's right. Yeah, you said it. We'll get this straightened out. I'll go talk to Lotso about moving us to the other room. Blast. Try that one. It's locked! Same here. Try the windows. Negatory. It's a FensterSchneckler 380. Finest childproof lock in the world. We're trapped! Wait. Did anyone notice the transom? Oh, great. How do we get up there? All right, everyone. On three! One, two... Three! Whoa! Let go! Go! He did it! Yes, sir! Way to go, Buzz! Yeah, you think they had a fun playtime? They might hear you. Okay, now you start. Love... You. See? That time, I said ""love."" Okay, now me first. Okay, okay, okay. Love... You. You see what I mean? It changes every time. You are so smart. Come on, Romeo. We're late. I'll wait up for you. Kisses! All right, place your bets. Come on, everybody. Come on. Any splits? Heya. Bring it here. All right. Here we go. Come on, horsey, come on! Come on, turkey, come on, turkey. Gobble, gobble, baby. Come on, horsey. Come on, duck. All right, that's it. No more bets. Come on! Right here. Let me have the duck, let me have the duck, let me have the duck! Here is a duck. I won! Ah, man! Well, Stretch takes the round. You lost! Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly. Coyote's wild. Here, here. Two greens here. Changing two double A's. Hey, what do you guys think of the new recruits? Any keepers? Oh, please! Landfill! Cowgirl? Dinosaur? Toddler fodder. But that space guy, he could be useful. He ain't the sharpest knife in the place where they keep the knives. Neither are you, Chunk. You got a little keeper yourself, didn't you, Ken? Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different. Aw, Mr Softy over here. What do you expect from a girl's toy? I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not! Why do you guys keep saying that? All them toys are disposable. We'll be lucky if they last us a week. Well, well. Looky who we have here. Let me go! Take him to the libary. No! 1225 Sycamore. Woody, what are you doing? I gotta get outta here. You're leaving? But didn't you have fun today? Well, of course I did, more than I've had in years, but, you see, I belong to someone else. Who's ""Yidnuh""? 1 believe it's pronounced ""Yidnay.""  Guys, it says ""Andy."" He's my Bonnie. And he's leaving soon. I gotta get home. Where's home? Elm Street. 234 Elm. You guys have a map? We're on it, cowboy. Trixie? I'll fire up the computer. Unhand me, you cowards! Ll demand to talk to Lotso! Zip it, Buck Rogers. You don't talk to Lotso till we say you can... Ken? What's goin' on here? Why is this toy tied up? He got out, Lotso. ""Got out""? No, no, no, no, no. This isn't how we treat our guests. FAOh, my Schwarz. There you go. I'm so sorry. Lotso, there's been a mistake. A mistake? The children in the Caterpillar Room are not ageappropriate for me and my friends. We respectfully request a transfer to the Butterfly Room. Well, request granted! But, Lotso... Hush now, Kenneth. This toy's shown initiative, leadership. Why, I'd say we've found ourselves a keeper. Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper! We're calling you up to the big leagues, son. From now on, you'll have anything you want. Excellent. I'll go get my friends. Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss. Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with. But my friends don't belong there. None of us do, I agree. Which is why, for the good of our community, we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can't bear any more. Well, I guess that makes sense. But I can't accept. We're a family. We stay together. Family man, huh? I understand. Put him back in the timeout chair. What are ya... Unhand me! Bring in the Bookworm. Here it is. It was filed under ""Lightyear."" Let's see here. ""Accessories. Maintenance."" Here we go. ""Remove screws to access battery compartment."" What are you doing? Stop! Let go of me! ""To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure to its original factory settings..."" No! ""...slide the switch from Play to Demo."" Stop! No! No! No! What was that? Sounds like it came from the hall. I'll see what it was. What do you see? Anything? No, just a dark hallway and... Wait. Wait! I see Andy! What? That's impossible. No, no, I really see him. In his room. My other eye! The one I left behind. This is so weird. He's packing up. Here comes Buster. Out of the way! Get away! Okay, Andy's out in the hall. He's looking in the attic. Wait, there's Mom. Why is he so upset? Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible! He's looking for us. Andy's looking for us! He's looking for us? So Andy does want us. I knew it! I just knew it! I think he did mean to put us in the attic. Well, then, Woody was telling the truth. Holy cow! And you didn't believe him. Hey, you didn't believe him first! Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home! Lotso! Hey, there. How y'all doin' this fine evenin'? Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz? There's been a mistake. We have to go. Go? Why, you just got here. In the nick of time, too. We were runnin' low on volunteers for the little ones. They just love new toys, now, don't they? ""Love""? We've been chewed, kicked, drooled on. Just look at my pocketbook! Well, here's the thing, sweet potato. You ain't leavin' Sunnyside. """" Sweet potato'! Who do you think you're talking to? I have over 30 accessories, and I deserve more respect... That's better. Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth, except me. Give it back, you furry air freshener! Come on, guys. We're goin' home. Whoa there, missy. You're not goin' anywhere. Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us? Buzz! You're back! Buzz? Hey! Look out! What are you, nuts? Buzz! Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso! Buzz, what are you doing? Silence, minions of Zurg! You're in the custody of the Galactic Alliance! Zurg""? ""Galactic Alliance""? Oh, boy. Good work, Lightyear. Now, lock 'em up! Yes, sir! Where do you think you're going? Buzz! We're your friends! Spare me your lies, temptress. Your emperor's defeated, and I'm immune to your bewitching good looks. Hey, Mongo! Keep your paws off my wife! Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus! Not him. I think this potato needs to learn himself some manners. Take him to the box. Hey! Put me down, you moron! Where are you taking me? Bad baby! Bad baby! Ken? What's going on? Barbie! I told you to wait in the Dream House. What are you doing to my friends? Get in there! Barbie, wait! Don't touch me. We're through! Barbie! I did... And give me my scarf back! Lightyear! Explain our overnight accommodations. Sir, yes, sir! Prisoners sleep in their cells. Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box. Roll call at dusk and dawn. Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box. Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to. Any prisoner talks back, spends the night... In the box! We get it. At ease, soldier. They're neutralised. But remember, they'll say anything to make you doubt yourself. Don't worry, Commander. Any doubt I had got pounded out of me at the academy. Listen up, folks. We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside. If you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true! But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you're just hurtin' yourselves. Woody! What did you do to him? You all get a good night's rest. You got a full day of playtime tomorrow. 1225 Syca... Who's Velocistar237? That's just a dinosaur toy down the street. That's nothing. Let me just take care of that. Just a dinosaur. All right. Sycamore. Okay, enter! Please don't be far. Please, please! Right around the corner? It's right around the corner! I'm going to college! Look at me! I'm big toy on campus! Hello! Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop. Okay, Potsie. Hey, listen. If any of you guys ever get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell 'em Woody made it home. You came from Sunnyside? But how'd you escape? Well, it wasn't easy. What do you mean ""escape""? Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair. Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries. Lotso? The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster. But... How do you know that? Chuckles. He'll tell you. Yeah, I knew Lotso. He was a good toy. A friend. Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy. ! was there when Lotso got unwrapped. Daisy loved us all. But Lotso, Lotso was special. They did everything together. You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love. One day, we took a drive. Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn't give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso. Something snapped. She replaced us. Come on! No, she only replaced you! She replaced all of us. Didn't she? She don't love you no more! Now come on! We were lost. Cast off. Unloved. Unwanted. Then we found Sunnyside. But Lotso wasn't my friend any more. He wasn't anyone's friend. He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system. So how'd you get out? I got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home. Other toys, they weren't so lucky. It ain't right what Lotso done. New toys, they don't stand a chance. But my friends are in there. You can't go back. Returning now would be suicide! But what about your Andy? Isn't he leaving for college? Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off! Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too. But he ain't ever comin' back. Rise and shine, campers! Commander Lotso, sir! All quiet, nothing to report. Excellent, Lightyear. Come on. We need ya back at Star Command. Wait! What've you done with my husband? Big Baby. Sweetheart! It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs. I don't think those were Lincoln Logs. You all get ready. You got a playdate with destiny! Hello? You shouldn't have come back, cowboy. They've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols. You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now. I made it out once. You got lucky once. Want my advice? Keep your heads down. You'll survive. Yeah, for how long? I've been here years. They'll never break me. There's only one way toys leave this place. Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn. Then it's off to the dump. Look, I appreciate your concern, oldtimer. But we have a kid waiting for us. Now, we're leaving. If you'd help us, one toy to another, I'd sure be grateful. Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing you gotta get through's the doors. Locked, every night. Inside and out. Keys are left on a hook in the office. Got it. What else? Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long. Hallway, lobby, playground. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about the wall? Eightfeet high. Cinder block. No way through it. You go over or under. That's it? Doesn't seem so bad. It's not. Your real problem's the monkey. The monkey's the eye in the sky. He sees everything. Classrooms. Hallways. Even the playground. You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere. You wanna get out of here? Get rid of that monkey! Recess! Come on, kids! Hey, guys. Woody? Woody! Woody! Hey, hey, hey, buddy! Thank goodness! You're alive! 'Course I'm alive! Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz? Lotso did something to him! He thinks he's a real Space Ranger again. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Return of the astronut. Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy. I was wrong. Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong. No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys. From now on, we stick together. But Andy's leavin' for college. College? Hogtie the mailman! We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow! Tomorrow? But that means... It means we're busting out of here, tonight. What? Impossible! But there's no way out of here! No, there is one way out. One way. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Springy dog. Present. Green guys. Cowgirl. Here. Horse. Piggy bank. Yo. Tyrannosaurus. Here. Barbie. Here. Potato Head. Potato Head? Hey! Hey! Tuberous rootman! Wake up! Impossible! Hey! Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head? That's Mr Potato Head to you, smoothie. Well, well, well. You're turning out to be quite the troublemaker, aren't you? What did you think you were gonna do? Waltz right out of here? Yeah, and I would've got away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling toys! You ascotwearing pinknoser! You're not a toy! You're an accessory! You're a purse with legs. Take him back to the box. No! No, not the box! I'm sorry. Ll didn't mean it! I like ascots. Really. No, no, no! Okay, check. Good work, Lightyear. All right, resume your spaceguythingy. Yes, sir, wellgroomed man! Ken! Ken? What do you want? I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go to the Butterfly Room. With you! Yeah, well, you should've thought of that yesterday. I was wrong. I wanna be with you, Ken, I do. In your Dream House. Please take me away from this! Take me away! Darn it, Barbie! Okay, but things are complicated around here. You gotta do what I say. I will, Ken! I promise! Wait. I'll do anything! I'll change your diapers! Go get the tape! And this is where the magic happens. Look at all your clothes! I can't believe you never brought me up here! Tennis whites? Mission to Mars! I know, I know, I know. Check this out! Kung fu fighting. Campus hero with matching sports pennant, huh? Flower power! Oh, Ken! No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie. No one. Ken, would you model a few outfits for me? Just a few? Go get the key. Where is it, where is it? Where's the key? Where's the key? Bingo! Hey! What do you think you're doing? I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff! Make a move, porky! Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up! Hey! Hey! Take that, walnutbrain. No wonder you're extinct. Hey, you can't hit each other. That's my job! Help! Prison riot! Get the tortilla. Ready? Ready. Barbie? No more games, Ken! What did Lotso do to Buzz? And how do we switch him back? You can't make me talk. You can't! But I'd like to see you try. Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks. Barbie! Those were vintage! It's okay. All right, go ahead, rip 'em, I don't care. They're a dime a dozen. Glitter tux. Who cares? Who cares? Sequins are tacky. Who cares? A Nehru jacket. Barbie! Not the Nehru. This is from what, 19677? The groovy formal collection, yes! What a shame. Oh, no, no, no! No! There's an instruction manual! Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode! Where's that manual? I don't know why this couldn't wait until morning, Ken, but here you go. What's takin' so doggone long? So how do we fix Buzz? What are you looking at, feathers? Hey! Yeah, fly away, you coward. Well, that's just great. Help! Prison riot! Mayday! Mayday! Give it up. No one can hear you. What? Said, ""No one can hear you.""  What? He said, ""No one can..."" Shush! Will you be quiet? Woody! You're back! Stop him! Don't let him get out! Star Command! I've been taken hostage by my own prisoners. Quick! Open his back. There's a switch! Unhand me, Zurg scum! The Galactic Courts will show you no mercy. It's not working. Why is it not working? Where's the manual? Here we go! There should be a little hole under the switch. Little hole, got it! ""To reset your Buzz Lightyear, ""insert paperclip..."" Rex, use your finger! What? Okay, now what? All right, let's see. """"Caution. Do not hold button for more than five seconds."" It's not my fault! Star Log... I've awakened from hypersleep on a strange planet. Now what did you do? Just did what you told me!  I'm surrounded by alien creatures of unknown intent. Who goes there? Friend? Or foe? Amigos! We're all amigos. I must have crashlanded and had my memory erased. Anyone seen my spaceship? We gotta switch him back. Well, how do we do that? I don't know. That part's in Spanish. We don't have time for this. Come on, El Buzzo. My spaceship? You know where it is? Excellent! Good luck, cowboy. Here they come. Come on, Buzz! What took you so long? Things got complicated. Where's Potato Head? We haven't seen him. Buzz. My desert flower! I have never seen true beauty until this night! Did you fix Buzz? Sort of. Behind you. Someone's coming. You would not believe what I've been through tonight. Darling! Are you okay? I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible. You've lost weight. And so tall. You're a sight for detachable eyes. All clear. Come on. Come on. We're almost there. Back up. Back up! Come on. Come with me! I will show you the wonders of the galaxy... and we shall vanquish all evil with our love! Woody! Come on. We're almost there. The Cowboy! Buzz, come here. Give me a lift. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! It is open. Way to go, Buzz. Come on. Is it safe? I guess I'll find out. Woody? You okay? Yeah. Come on down. But not all at once. What did he say? I think he said, ""All at once."" No. No. No, no, no, no, no! Geronimo! Look out! Thanks, Jess. Where's my spaceship? Almost there, guys. Slink, you think you can make it? Well, I might be old, but I still got a spring in my step. He did it! All right, Slinkykins. Okay, climb across. You lost, little doggie? Well, well. Look who's back. I'm sorry, cowboy. They broke me. What are y'all doing? Running back to your kid? He don't want you no more. That's a lie. Is it? Tell me this, Sheriff. If your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving? You think you're special, cowboy? You're a piece of plastic. You were made to be thrown away. Speak of the devil. Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room and you need to avoid that truck. Why don't you come on back, join our family again? This isn't a family! It's a prison! You're a liar and a bully! And I'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours! Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force. If that's what you want. Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso. She's a Barbie doll, Ken. There's a hundred million just like her. Not to me, there's not. Fine. Then why don't you join her! Oh, Ken! Everyone, listen! Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair. It's Lotso. He's made us into a pyramid, and he put himself on top! Anyone concur with Ken? I didn't throw you away. Your kid did. Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really. Chew on that when you're at the dump. Wait! What about Daisy? I don't know what you're talking about. Daisy? You used to do everything with her? Yeah? Then she threw us out. No. She lost you. She replaced us! She replaced you. And if you couldn't have her then no one could. You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since. Where'd you get that? She loved you, Lotso. She never loved me. As much as any kid ever loved a toy. Mama. What? You want your mommy back? She never loved you. Don't be such a baby! Push 'em in. All of 'em! This is what happens when you dummies try to think. We're all just trash, waiting to be thrown away! That's all a toy is! Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot! No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait! He's gone! Holy cow. Come on. Hurry! For crying out loud! Cowboy, hurry! Woody! Oh, boy. Incoming! Come on! Barbie, no! Woody! No! Can you hear me? Is everyone okay? Of course not, you imbecile. We're doomed! Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on. We all here? Slinky? Rex? Against the wall, everybody. Quick! Miss! Where are you?! Buzz! They'll never make it! Look out! Buzz! Anyone see him? Over here, y'all. I found him. Buzz, you okay? Buzz! Buzz! That wasn't me, was it? Buzz, you're back! You're back, you're back, you're back, you're back! Yes, I'm back. Where have I been? Beyond infinity, Space Ranger. Woody! So where are we now? In a garbage truck on the way to the dump! Hold on, we're going in! You got all your pieces? The claw! My babies! Hey, guys! No! No! No! Hang on! Woody! What do we do? We'll be okay if we stay togeth... Woody! Slinky! It's a magnet! Watch out! Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down. You might wanna take a look at this. Quick! Grab something metal! You heard the guy. It's not working! Help! Help me. I'm stuck! Help, please! Help! Woody! Thank you. Don't thank me yet. Woody! Go, go! Thank you, Sheriff. We're all in this together. Right, guys? Guys? Woody! Down here! Woody! Oh, boy. Woody, look. I can see daylight. We're gonna be okay! Hey! I don't think that's daylight. Run! Sheriff! The button! Help me! Come on! Go. Go! Hit the button! Hurry! Just push it! Push it! Push it! Where's your kid now, Sheriff? No. No! Lotso! No! Rex! Buzz! What do we do? The claw. You know all that bad stuff I said about Andy's attic? I take it all back. You're darn tootin'. You said it. Oh, darling. You were so brave. You saved our lives. And we are eternally grateful. My boys! Daddy! Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso? Yeah. I'd like to loosen his stitchin'. Forget it, guys. He's not worth it. Hey! What you got? I had me one of these when I was a kid. Strawberries. Hey, buddy. You might wanna keep your mouth shut. Come on, Woody. We gotta get you home. That's right, college boy. Wait. What about you guys? I mean, maybe the attic's not such a great idea. We're Andy's toys, Woody. We'll be there for him, together. Just hope he hasn't left yet. Wait a minute!  Wait, I'll check! Andy's still packing. But he's almost done! He lives halfway across town. We'll never get there in time! Come on, Buster. Is that it, honey? You got everything? Yeah. Just a few more boxes in my room. Okay. Come on. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough! All right. Go. Go, go! Okay. All clear. There you are. There you go. Buzz. This isn't goodbye. Hey, Woody. Have fun at college. Yeah, but not too much fun. Woody, take care of Andy. Yeah. He's a good kid. Tell him to get a haircut. Sure thing. Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic? 'Course I will. Besides, I know about  Buzz's Spanish mode. My what? Honey, you want some food for the road? I'll get something on the way. You know where to find us, cowboy. Did you say goodbye to Molly? Mom, we've said goodbye like 10 times. Andy. Mom, it's okay. I know. It's just... I wish I could always be with you. You will be, Mom. Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye to Buster? Of course I am. Who's a good doggy? Who's a good doggy? I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. Don't, Andy. Good boy. He's telling you to go already. Come on. Get the rest of your things. Okay, Buster. Now don't let Molly near my stuff. Hey. Hey, Mom! So, you really think ll should donate these? It's up to you, honey. Whatever you wanna do. ""Don't go in there! The bakery is haunted!"" ""Are you crazy? You'll wake up all the ghosts."" ""Look out! The ghosts are throwing pies!"" Mom. Andy"" Wow. Look at you. Well, I hear you're off to college. Yeah. Right now, actually. So, what can we do for you? I have some toys here. You hear that, Bonnie? So, you're Bonnie? I'm Andy. Someone told me you're really good with toys. These are mine, but I'm going away now, so I need someone really special to play with them. This is Jessie, the roughest, toughest cowgirl in the whole West. She loves critters, but none more than her best pal, Bullseye. Here. This is Rex, the meanest, most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived! The Potato Heads. Mr and Mrs. You gotta keep 'em together, 'cause they're madly in love. Now Slinky here is as loyal as any dog you could want. And Hamm, he'll keep your money safe, but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time, evil Dr Pork Chop. These little dudes are from a strange alien world. Pizza Planet. And this is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever! Look, he can fly and shoot lasers! He's sworn to protect the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg. To infinity and beyond! Now, you gotta promise to take good care of these guys. They mean a lot to me. My cowboy! Woody? What's he doing in there? ""There's a snake in my boot."" Wha...? There's a snake in my boot. Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember. He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind. And smart. But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you. Ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what. You think you can take care of him for me? Okay then. Oh, no! Dr Pork Chop's attacking the haunted bakery! The ghosts are getting away. Woody'll stop 'em! Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! And we'll actually need the rocket. They're getting away! Come on, Bullseye! We need to get in the spaceship. The volcano is gonna erupt. Look! They're being attacked by a real dog! You can eat my poisonous scones! Mr and Mrs Potato Head are in trouble. Get on, Woody. It's my friend Woody. Buzz, hurry! Get your extra turbo booster. Thanks, guys. Look, Mommy. They're all playing together. Come on. Let's get some lunch. So long, partner. Hey, Buzz. You haven't met Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here. You're gonna love them. Buzz, this is Dolly. New toys! Noses. ""So I guess you could say Sunnyside is sunny once again! ""Hope to hear from you soon. We're all super excited about your new home. ""Hugs and kisses to everyone."" That Barbie has some nice handwriting. Buzz, Barbie didn't write this. Grab the sword! I got it! Okay, go for the... Triple bonus! Watch out! We got the cloak of darkness! Run, run! My arms are never long enough! I'll do it! This is it! This is it! Yes! We did it! Highfive! Hold on. Well, it's official. You guys made the wall. Look at this! Golly bob howdy! That's me! We're all up here! Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good. Yeah, she really got your smile. What the... I told you kids! Stay out of my butt! But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? Romeo, o Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Next season, we're doing Cats. Or might I suggest Hamlet? Yeah. Detached wing. Cosmetic damage. Nothing a little duct tape can't fix. I don't know what came over me. Just go with it, Buzz."
Toy Story 4,Disney,2010,2019,Animation,"Whoa! It's raining cats and dogs out there! I hope they make it back all right. Heads up! Andy's coming! Andy, time for dinner. Yes! I'm starving!

Barbies! Go! Flashlight. Hang on, R.C.! I ain't got any more slink! Oh, it's beautiful. I'm so glad to see this old lamp go to a good home. We've had it since Molly was a baby. Molly, are you sure it's all right? Yeah, I don't want it anymore. Thank you. Where's Woody? Yeah, hi. I think I left my keys here. Woody. Quick! We'll sneak in the hedges before he's back. Woody, it's okay. What? No! No, no, no. You can't go! What's best for Andy is that... Woody. I'm not Andy's toy. What? It's time for the next kid. Oh, and thank you again for everything. I really appreciate it. Oh, my pleasure. I'm glad it all worked out. You know, kids lose their toys every day. Sometimes they get left in the yard... or put in the wrong box. And that box gets taken away. Mom, where's Woody? Andy! Come inside! I can't find Woody! Well, good night. Goodbye. Drive safe. Oh, there you are. Mom, I found him! I found him! Oh, good. Come on and get inside. You've got a friend in me  Reach for the sky!  You've got a friend in me  Ride 'em, cowboy! Yeehaw! When the road looks  rough ahead There's a snake in my boot.  And you're miles and miles  From your nice warm bed You just remember  what your old pal said Boy, you've got  a friend in me To infinity and beyond! Yeah, you've got  a friend in me My cowboy! Now, some other folks  might be a little bit smarter than I am Big and stronger, too  Woody, let's go! Maybe  But none of them will ever  love you the way I do You're my favorite deputy!  It's me and you, boy  And as the years go by  Our friendship  will never die Reach for the sky! You're gonna see  it's our destiny They've escaped and they're headed right for us! You've got a friend in me  Full speed ahead! Yay!  You've got a friend in me  You've got a friend in me ?  It's getting hot in here! Where's my ear? You're on my foot! Oh, hey, quit shoving. Sorry! Could you move over a bit, please? That was my horn. To infinity and beyond!  I know that was you, Potato Head. Everyone, listen. I thought I told you... when Mom quickly cleans the bedroom like that... expect to be put in the closet. How much longer? Keep it to a dull roar, Rex. Deep breaths, Jessie. Deep breaths. Settle down, Slink. Sit. Good boy! Sheriff, do I need to be worried? No, no. My guys are veterans. They'll hang in there. Good. Just keep them calm until we get word. Yes, ma'am. How are you, uh, feeling about today? Uh, good, good. Yeah, good. I'm good. Uh... Good. We're on! Bonnie's done with breakfast! Any minute now. You hear that? Any minute now. Wind 'em if you got 'em. Keep your batteries clean, your joints unlocked... Uh, thanks, Woody. I got it. Yes, I'm sorry. You're right, you're right. The town is open! Hi, Mayor! Banker! Hi, IceCream Man! Hi, Hat Shop Owner! Mailman! And the sheriff! Okay. Bye, toys! Yeehaw! Sheriff Jessie! Giddyup, Bullseye! They went that way! Chase them! What a beautiful hat shop! You have so many hats... Wow. They're doing ""hat shop."" When's the last time we ever got to play that? Remember when she played ""house""? I liked ""house."" Those were the days. It was basic. You made a house, you lived in it, done. Hmm. That's the third time you haven't been picked this week. I don't know. I don't keep count. Oh, you don't have to. I'll do it for you. Okay, okay, okay, I get it. It's been a while. Oh, looky there. You got your first dust bunny. Aw, how adorable. What you gonna name it? Uh, what about Dusty? Francis! Harry! Karen! Fuzzball! LeBron? No, Fluffy. How about Thumper? Tumbleweed! ""Tumbleweed."" Oh, that's good. That's good. He's a cowboy, so that makes a lot of sense. So many choices. I just can't decide! Bonnie? What are you doing? We gotta go. You don't wanna be late for kindergarten orientation, do you? But I don't wanna go. We talked about this. We're gonna meet your teachers, see your classroom... Can I bring a toy? Toys don't go to school, that's the rule. Freeze! Nobody move! Bonnie always forgets something. She'll be back any second. That goes for you, too, Hamm. But it's money! You all right, Woody? I'm sure she'll pick you next time. Oh, come on, I'm fine. No problem. Hey, Woody. Here. Oh, thanks, Jessie. We're here for you, buddy. I don't want to play the baker. Pricklepants. The hat shop owner is the role I was born to play! All right, Pricklepants, back to your bakery. Excuse me, Dolly? Woody, can't you see I'm threatening everyone? Go back to the closet. I'm worried about Bonnie. A toy should go with her to orientation. Didn't you hear Dad? You'll get Bonnie in trouble. Yeah, but kindergarten is so different. It can be too much for a kid. Having a buddy with them to get through it can really help things. Uhhuh. I'm sorry, Woody, but Bonnie's not Andy. No, no, no, of course, I get that. But if you would just... Places, everyone! Bonnie? What are you doing back there? Come on, we have to go. That's my big girl. Come on. We gotta hurry, okay? Don't forget your backpack. You're gonna have so much fun. All right. Now what was it you were saying, Woody? Woody? Here we are. Bonnie, honey, it'll be okay. Hi! Are you Bonnie? My name is Miss Wendy. I'm going to be your kindergarten teacher. We have a special place where you can put your backpack. You want to see? Here we are, Bonnie. Just for you. Okay, class, let's all find a seat at a table... so we can start craft time. On the first day of school, you'll need a place to put your pencils. So, today, we're going to make pencil holders. Now, everyone take a cup... and we'll use the art supplies to decorate them. Hi. Bonnie. That is so clever. ""Hello, I'm Forky. Nice to meet you!"" Well, hello, Forky, it's nice to meet you. I'm Miss Wendy. Mom! Dad! Look what I made! His name is Forky! Wow! That is so cool! I finished kindergarten! Uh... No. That was just orientation. But for being such a brave girl, we have a surprise for you. What is it? Since school doesn't start for another week, we are going on a road trip! Can I bring Forky? 'Course you can! Yay! And they said I shouldn't go to school with Bonnie. We got this kindergarten thing under control, eh? I can't believe I'm talking to a spork. Hi, toys! Bye, toys! Ow. He did go to kindergarten! I knew it. No, no, no, guys, listen... You tryin' to get Bonnie in trouble? No, of course not! You could have been confiscated. What does that mean? Taken away. No! Or worse. You could've been lost! No, no, no, guys, listen. Bonnie had a great day in class... and we're going on a road trip. Road trip? Vacation! Yeehaw! But then something really weird happened. Bonnie made a friend in class. What a kid. Oh, she's already making friends. No, no. She literally made a new friend. Hey, it's okay. Come on out. That's it. Come on, there you go. Come on, let's get you out of there. You got this. Good. Good. Everyone, I want you to meet Forky. Golly bob howdy! Look at that! Look how long his arms are! Trash? No. No, toys. They're all toys. Trash? No, no, no. That's the trash. These are your friends. Hi! Trash! No, no, it's okay. Trash! Woody, I have a question. Um, well, actually, not just one, I have all of them. I have all the questions. Uh, why does he want to go to the trash? Because he was made from trash. Trash! Look, I know this is a little strange, but you gotta trust me on this. Trash? Forky is the most important toy to Bonnie right now. Important? He's a spork. Yes. Yeah, I know, but this spork... this toy is crucial to Bonnie getting adjusted to kindergarten. Oh. Woody, aren't you being a little dramatic about all this? I know this is new to everybody... but you should see how much this little guy means to Bonnie. When she started playing with him... she had the biggest smile on her face. I wish you could have seen it. Bonnie was really upset... and I swear, once she made Forky... it was a complete transformation. Uh, Woody? Just a second, Jessie. So, we all have to make sure nothing happens to him. Something happened to him. Oh, Chutes and Ladders! Ah, trash. No, no, no! No! No! You're a toy now, Forky! Come on! Stop! Stop it! Hey! No, no, no! Come on! Trash! Trash! Trash! Well, I guess I'll just babysit him till he's used to the room. Hmm. Forky? Where are you, Forky? There you are! I thought I'd lost you, silly. No, no, no. Big girl scary! Like I said before, Bonnie's not scary. She loves you and you need to... Ooh. Forky? Bonnie! Let's go! Rise and shine! Who wants to go on a road trip? Me! I'm gonna bring Dolly, and Buttercup... and Forky, and... Forky? Where are you? He's gotta be here somewhere. Forky? Forky! Come on. Let's eat some breakfast and hit the road! Let's go, Forky! Whoa. He's quite a handful, Woody. You need help with him on the road trip? No. No, no. I got it, I got it. We'll just be stuck in an RV. He can't get far. I got this. I got it. I can't let you  I can't let you  I can't let you  throw yourself away I can't let you   I can't let you  I can't let you   I can't let you  I can't let you  throw yourself away Don't you want to see  the sun come up each morning? No, no! Don't you want to see  the sun go down each day? Don't you want to see that  little girl that loves you so? Her heart would break  Oh, yeah! If you should go  I can't let you   I can't let you  I can't let you   I can't let you  I can't let you  throw yourself away No, no, no! No! No! No! So it seems to me like  you're never gonna behave yourself Since I'm not gonna  do this every day Come tomorrow, you're gonna  have to save yourself Got nothing more to say  You're not listening anyway  I can't let you   I can't let you  I can't let you   I can't let you  Trash, here I come! I can't let you  throw yourself away Come on. I can't let you  I can't let you  I can't let you  throw yourself away I don't wanna be a toy! I can't let you   I can't let you  I can't let you   I can't let you  I can't let you  throw yourself away ? Hey, buddy. Hey, Buzz. You doing okay? I don't know, Buzz. I know you weren't around when Andy was little... but I don't remember it being this hard. Want me to take the next watch? I'll keep an eye on Forky. No, no. I need to do this. That little voice inside me would never leave me alone if I gave up. Huh. Who do you think it is? Who? The voice inside of you. Who do you think it is? Uh... Me. You know, my conscience? That part of you that tells you things? What you're really thinking? Fascinating. So, your inner voice advises you. What? It's a secret  mission in uncharted space. Let's go.  Where's Forky? Oh, no! Forky! Forky! I am not a toy! I'm a spork. Be quiet! I was made for soup, salad... maybe chili, and then the trash. I'm litter! Freedom! Hamm, how far to our next stop? 5.32 miles, give or take. I can make that. I'll meet you at the RV park. Woody, hold on a minute. Woody! Forky! Forky, where are you? Forky! Forky, where are you? Carry me? No. Why do I have to be a toy? Because you have Bonnie's name written on the bottom of your sticks. Why do I have Bonnie's name written on the bottom of my sticks? Because she... Look, she plays with you all the time, right? Ugh. Yes. And who does she sleep with every night? The big white fluffy thing? No, not her pillow. You. All right, Forky. You have to understand how lucky you are right now. You're Bonnie's toy. You are going to help create happy memories... that will last for the rest of her life. Huh? What? Okay. Doing it for Bonnie. Doing this for Bonnie, you're doing it for Bonnie. Okay, like it or not, you are a toy. Maybe you don't like being one, but you are one nonetheless. Which means you are going to be there for Andy when he... Who's Andy? I mean, Bonnie. You have to be there for Bonnie. That is your job. Well, what's your job? Well, right now, it's to make sure you do yours. Carry me? No! Who's Andy? Andy was my other kid. You had another kid? Yeah, yeah. For a long time. And it was pretty great. I was a favorite toy, actually. Running the room was my job. Keeping all the toys in place... So, he thought Andy's room was a planet? Wow, that is messed up. Right! That's exactly what I thought when he first showed up. Yeah. I mean, how is that not annoying? Thank you! Seriously, that is the... Well, then you watch 'em grow up and become a full person. And then they leave. They go off and do things you'll never see. Don't get me wrong, you still feel good about it. But then somehow you find yourself, after all those years... sitting in a closet just feeling... Useless? Yeah. Your purpose fulfilled? Exactly. Woody, I know what your problem is. You do? You're just like me. Trash! What is it with you and trash? It's warm. Ew. It's cozy. I guess. And safe! Like somebody's whispering in your ear, ""Everything's gonna be okay."" Forky, that's it. That's how Bonnie feels when she's with you. She does? Yes! Wait a sec. You mean she thinks I'm warm? Yep. And cozy? Uhhuh. And sometimes kinda squishy? Well, that, too. Yes. I get it now. I'm Bonnie's trash. Yes! Wait, what? I am Bonnie's trash! No, no, no, not exactly. She must be feeling awful without me. Woody, we got to get going, she needs me! Yeah... Whoa, whoa. Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming! Forky, slow down! Forky! Bonnie, I'm coming! Forky! Forky, look. Bonnie's right over there. Hurry! Whoo! Huh? Woody? Bo? Woody? Aren't we going to Bonnie? I know, I know. But my friend might be in there. Friend? Oh, a friend, uh... Well, a friend is... Well, a friend is like you and me. Trash? Trash, like... Yes. And I'm very worried that she might be lost. But, Woody, Bonnie's right there. Yeah, we'll have you back before she wakes up. Come on. Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo. Bo, Bo, Bo... Bo? Bo? Can we go back to Bonnie now? I don't see your friend. Yeah, okay. She's not in here. Come on, let's go. Is that Bo? Uh... Hey, howdy. Hey there. Uh, sorry to bother you, but... Why, you're not a bother at all. We were just out for my early morning stroll. And look... we met you! My name is Gabby Gabby. And this is my very good friend Benson. Oh, uh, Woody. Pleasure to meet you. Well, it's nice to meet you, Woody. And you are...? This is Forky. I'm trash. Our kid made him. Kid? Toys around here don't have kids. Are you two lost? Lost? No, no. But we are looking for a lost toy. She's a figurine. Used to be on that lamp in the window? Name's Bo Peep? Bo Peep? Oh, yes, I know Bo. You do? Hop on in. We'll take you to her. Oh, you don't have to do that. Well, okay. Benson, be careful with our new friends. Wow, what service. Uh... Thank you for your help. I haven't seen Bo in years. May I ask, when were you made? Me? Uh... I'm not sure. Late '50s? Me, too! Gee, I wonder if we were made in the same factory. Wouldn't that be something? I gotta say, you are in great condition. Well, I try to stay active. And look at that, you have a voice box like me. Benson, show him. Oh, that's really not necessary. I'm Gabby Gabby  and I love you.  Wow, you need to fix that. My record works just fine. It's the voice box that's broken. Does yours still work? Hey! There's a snake in my boot!  Listen to that! Let's see it. I bet it's the same type. No, thanks, mine's sewn inside. Is Bo around here? Because we need... Oh. The store is about to open. Don't worry, we'll take you where no one will see us. Oh, no. We can't stay. Yes, you can. We gotta go. You can't leave yet. You have what I need. Right inside there. Returned that lamp the next day. You're kidding me! Mom, can we go to the park now? Harmony! Stop him, please. What's going on? Come on! Let's go! He's coming, he's coming! I see him! Forky? We got to get out of... Woody! I'd like  to join your posse, boys. But first, I'm gonna sing  a little song. Grandma, look what I found. Can I take it to the park? Sure. Mom, she has enough toys from the store. Oh, it's fine. Nobody buys the toys anyway. Thanks, Grandma! Yeehaw!  Mom, can we go to the carnival? We're going to the park. Maybe later, sweetie. Any sign of Woody? I don't see him! Shh! Maybe we should have gone with the fork. The spoon is safer. Mmm. Forky? Where's Forky? Mom! Dad! What's wrong, honey? Are you okay? I can't find Forky! He's missing! Oh, Bonnie, it'll be all right. I'm sure he's here somewhere. You know, if you don't find him, you can make a new one. No! There's only one Forky! Uh... Let's go look outside. Maybe he fell on the ground somewhere. Oh, poor Bonnie. We're gonna find him, okay? We have to find him, Mom. He needs me. Woody was right. We all should have been safeguarding the utensil. Why isn't Woody back yet? Do you think he's lost? Buzz, what do we do? What do we do, Buzz? Buzz, what do we do? What do we do, Buzz? What do we do, Buzz? Buzz! I, uh... Buzz. What would Woody do? Eh, jump out of a moving vehicle. What would Woody do? It's a secret mission  in uncharted space. Let's go!  I think I have to go. Where? Where you goin'? Why? Should we all go? Are we going? And then what? No time to explain!  Attack! No time to explain! Oh, no! Buzz! Okay, what is with everyone jumping out the window? Woody and Forky were last seen on the highway. But where is the highway? The slingshot  maneuver is all we've got! Full speed ahead!  Thanks, inner voice! Hiya! The highway. On my way, Woody! Rad. Hey! Step right up! Put your money down! Get yourself a real Buzz Lightyear! Hey! Hey! Harmony, honey. Sunscreen. Okay. Be right back, Mr. Cowboy. Okay. Antique store, antique store... Oh, that way! Did you see 'em? How many are there? Whoa, whoa. We got a busload of campers! Here they come! Huh? Playtime, baby! Oh, baby! It's a good day to play, huh? Am I right? Huh? ""Hello, Mr. Cowboy. How are you today? ""Do you like riding horses?"" Wanna play on the swings? Wait for me! Bo? Come on. Bo! Oh, I can't believe it's you! Bo Peep! I never thought I'd see you again! So, which kid is yours? Which one is yours? None. No one. Wait, you're a lost toy? You're a lost toy? That's awful. That's great. Huh? I mean, awfully great... that you are lost out here. Skunk, skunk, skunk! Watch out! Huh? I told you not to drive so fast. You almost ran him over. Oh, hey, guys! Whoa! Hold on there! Okay! I missed you, too. If it isn't Bobby? Gus? Uh... Lefty? Billy, Goat, and Gruff. Right! Right! Right! Sorry, guys. Girls. Girls! Of course! All right, all right. Okay, let's get a look at you. You need any repairs? Repairs? No, I'm fine. Hey! Nice find, girls. Where did you get all this stuff? Here and there. You know, some kids play rougher than others... so I try to be prepared. How long have you been out on your own? Seven fantastic years! Seven? You would not believe the things I've seen. Uh, no. Gigs. Yo! Come on out. There's someone I want you to meet. Be right down. What's the situation? We heading out of town or... Whoa! Who's this? You remember the rag doll I told you about? The cowboy? Yep! No way! Don't stare. I'm totally staring. Woody, this is Giggle McDimples. Oh, hi, Giggle. Whoa, you didn't tell me he was a cop. Howdy, Sheriff. Officer Giggle McDimples. I run Pet Patrol for MiniOpolis. Yeah, search and rescue. Ants, caterpillars, miniature poodles, spiders. Hut! Hut! Hut! Carl! Where you headed? Combat Carl just heard there's a birthday party... at the playground on Main Street. Rumor has it they got two pinatas. That could be 20 to 30 kids. Nice! Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's gettin' played with! You guys in? You bet! Woody, you are gonna love this! Uh, no, I can't, sir. Bo, I need to get back to my kid. What? You got a kid? Yeah. Way to beat the odds, soldier. Meet you at the playground, Peep. Combat Carl's got a pinata party to crash. All right, move out. Hut! Hut! Hut! So, you're, uh, with a kid? It's not Andy, is it? No, no, no. He went off to college. But he gave us to Bonnie. You have a little girl? No way! Yeah, yeah. It's why I'm out here. Her other toy is trapped in this antique store, and I have to... Second Chance Antiques? We know that store. That's great. That is great! If you know the store, you could really help me find him... No way. We wasted years there, just sitting on the shelf, collecting dust. Oh, Bo, that's awful. But I don't have a choice. I have to get that toy from Gabby. Whoa. Steer clear of that weirdo. If I were you, I'd cut my losses and go home. But Bonnie needs him to get through kindergarten. Kids lose toys every day. Bonnie will get over it. No, no... You see, Bonnie needs him just like Molly needed you. Aw, no. Sorry, girls. Molly's not here. Molly? Bo, I didn't know you had a kid. That was a long time ago. Oh, Bo's kid was something special. She was the cutest thing... but so afraid of the dark. It was just a phase. Oh, you weren't there in the beginning. Hearing Molly cry each night... it broke every toy's heart. And then, Bo came into the room. Her lamp was the only thing that made Molly feel safe. Mom would let her keep Bo on all night. Ha! Who knew you were such a softy? And Molly would fall asleep with her hand resting on Bo's feet. Okay! Okay. I get it. Bo, my kid really needs this toy. Will you help me? For old times' sake. All right, all right. Thank you! Oh! Oh, thank you! All right. Guess we're doing this. Let's ride! Second Chance Antiques, and step on it. Ow! Hey, hey! Benson, are we finished? Ow! Oh, that feels great! Look at that! Good as new. Yeah. Thank you, uh, Benson. Uh, so, um, when's Woody coming back? Like I said, soon. He won't forget about you. How do you know? You have your child's name written on your feet. Sticks. That makes you a very important toy. That's exactly what Woody says. Hmm. Interesting. Hi, Grandma! We're back! She's back. Who is she? Harmony. Wait a second... she took Woody. Did she lose him? No. My Harmony is perfect. Forky, it's tea time. It's tea time. Whoohoo! What is tea time? Oh, I'll show you. A little bit of milk, two lumps of sugar. I've been practicing. How do I look? Uh... A little higher. Stick out your pinky. Nice! Mmm! Delicious! Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving. Come give me a hug. Bye, Mom. I love you. When my voice box is fixed... I'll finally get my chance. Now, about our friend Woody. I wanna know everything about him. Oh, yeah, Woody. I've known that guy my whole life. Two days! Hey, did you know that Bonnie was not his first kid? He had this other kid, Andy. And you know what? Psst. Hey, Lightyear. Hey, up here, Astroboy. If you think you can just show up and take our top prize spot... you're wrong! Dead wrong! You don't understand. I'm trying to... Cheat the system and get with a kid? Yeah, we know. No, I need... A child to shower you with unconditional love? Join the club, pal. Yeah, join the club! Come on, help me get outta here. I'll help you. With my foot! Get him. Get him. Bunny, what are you doing? Hmm? I can't reach him. Help me out here, come on. Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not a mind reader, you know. What's not to understand, hmm? You gonna make me say it? What? With these tiny legs, I cannot reach without your help. Uhhuh. Okay? This is what I've been talking about, Bunny. You need to work on paying attention and your listening skills. Ha! How you like that, cheater? Huh? Yeah! Oh, to infinity and my foot! Boom! In a galaxy far, far away, you got kicked in the head! How do I get out of here? This planet is toxic.  Closing helmet  to conserve oxygen. In the vacuum of space, they cannot hear you scream! Ow! Let go of me! Get off of me! Ooh! So, that's what gravity feel like. Yeah, that's it. Hey, where you going? You better get over here, spaceman! Yeah, put us back up there! Bunny, what are you doing? He's getting away, let's go! I'm trying! Come on! Antique store, here we come! Bo, why do you ride around in a skunk? Whoa! Skunk! A skunk! Oh, I get it. Smart. Corndogs, corndogs, corndogs! Why are you so bad at driving? You got six eyes. Thanks for the landing. Uh... Come on, follow me. I'm fine. His face! That's hilarious. I'm fine. Don't worry. Happens all the time. Tape! Not a bad hiding spot. Yeah. Leave the skunk. We'll fix it later. This will be more fun. Let's get you to that store! Okay, spill it. The cowboy, what's the deal? There's no deal. Uhhuh. Don't do this to yourself. Cowboy's got a kid. Giggle... Trust me. I've been there. You know about me and HeMan. I'm not proud. Shh! Here he comes! Oh, man... What? No, not you. Second Chance Antiques, straight ahead. Heavy foot traffic at the entrance. Easiest way in is the roof. The roof! Let's go antiquing. Hold on! Huh? Whoa! How did you end up here? I thought you were given to a new family. Oh, you know how it goes. Their little girl grew up and didn't need me anymore, so... Oh, I'm sorry, Bo. Eh, who needs a kid's room... when you can have all of this? Whatcha looking at, Sheriff? What? Oh, uh... That wasn't... No, uh, nothing. I was looking at the store. Right there. I was looking at the antique store. Giggle, count us down. Five. Countdown for what? Four. You want to get to the store, don't you? Three. Two. One! The highway exit has to be somewhere. Where is it? Meteor shower! Look out!  Woody? Good work, inner voice. So, how about you? How's your new kid? Bonnie? Oh, she's great. Jessie is loving it. Jessie's still with you? Oh, yeah, the whole gang's still together. Well, I mean, most of us. What about Rex? Yeah, yeah, Rex, Bullseye, Slinky... the Potato Heads... Buzz? Yeah, Buzz, too. I cannot wait to see his face when he hears that I found... Bo Peep? Buzz! My old moving buddy! Buzz? It's so good to see you! Woody, it's Bo Peep! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...  Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!  Three years! Three years! That's how long we've been hanging up there waiting for a kid! Look, I'm sorry about that. You ruined our lives. Shame on you! Who are these guys? Lightyear promised us a kid. You did what? I did not. Hey! Wait a minute! Eat my plush! All right now, come on, stop it! Cut it out now! Come on, guys, break it up. Guys, I have a kid! You got a kid? Like a kidkid? Like a human kid, not a baby goat? Yeah. Now let go of Buzz and come with me. I'll take you to Bonnie. We're gettin' a kid? Yes! We're gettin' a kid? We're gonna get a kid  Kid We're getting a kid  All right, let's go. We gonna get something, oh  We gonna uh, uh, uh Where's Forky? Long story. Kid, we get a kid  Kid, kid, kid We gonna kid ?  We gonna kid, kid? He's not anywhere. Forky's gone. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's look outside one more time. But then we have to keep driving, okay? They're about to leave! Leaving? They can't do that! The panic is attacking me! Hey! Watch it, buddy! What do we do? We have to stop them! How? We could frame Dad for a crime so he goes to jail. Or go back in time and warn Woody about the future. That's crazy. Time is a flat circle. Jessie! I'm sorry, Bonnie. We looked everywhere. But we need to get going now, okay? Can we please leave a note for Forky... so he knows where we're going? He has to go to kindergarten. Huh? Are you kidding me? I can't... Everything is going perfect... I just bought it. Okay! Daddy's going to use some words. How about we go to the carnival? Or maybe check out some of those shops in town? What did you do? We're not going anywhere. If you get my point. Brilliant! That was genius! Nice work, Jessie! I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on their way back right now. Whoa! Forky is in there? Yeah. Now, hold on. I have a question. Who will Bonnie love more? Ducky or me? Say me. No, say Ducky. Ducky. Bunny. Bunny. Okay, guys. Playtime is over. You have to follow my lead. We stay together, we stay quiet. Are we clear? Absolutely. Lead the way. Are you kidding me? Move over. You move over. Quit pushing me. Stop. Shh! Oh, my maker! That sheep has three heads! No, no, no! What? All six eyes just looked into my soul. Gonna have nightmares. That's most likely where your Forky is being kept. All right, this isn't so bad. We just can't be seen by the dummies. Not just the dummies. Her cabinet is surrounded by a moat of exposed aisle. Where Dragon roams. We can handle a cat. No. Not this one. Is that how we look on the inside? There's so much... fluff. So, how do you propose we get up there? We could go straight across. How? That's quite a jump. We know the perfect toy to help. Oh, Bonnie, check it out. Look at all this cool stuff. Bonnie? We gotta get Forky now! Woody, don't... Stick to the plan. Follow me. Roger that. Woody just sits in the closet? With no playtime? Yeah, he told me himself, he's useless. That's awful. Such pretty hair... What are you doing? You need to stick to the plan. But it's Bonnie. She's right... Can we go to the carnival, too? ...there. Come on. Stay quiet. You better hope the dummies didn't... Whoa! My sheep! What did I say? I lead. You follow. Bo, I'm so sorry. Really. Just tell me how to help. You really wanna help? Then stay out of my way. I'm getting my sheep back. What about the others? Giggle knows what to do. Here you go. That's our objective. We have to get that key. It's the only way inside the cabinet. You can't be serious. How are we supposed to do that? Okay. You know what, leave that to us. We know exactly what to do. Mmmhmm. Aw. Where did you two come from? The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they? Give us the keys! Give us the keys! Well, we're not doing that. Yeah, yeah, I agree, too visible. It's a good point. Something more subtle. Ooh, what about ""Winner, winner, chicken dinner""? Yes. The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they? Uh... you're kidding. Really? Okay, okay. You just... All right. Well... Oh, what about the old ""Plush Rush""? There you go! Argh. Where is this going? Shh! Don't interrupt. Okay, right? Uhhuh? Not gonna happen. NO. Okay, do you want the key or not? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with...? We just gave you three brilliant ideas. It's one thing to say no. It's another to offer a reason... How do we get that key? You're kidding! Really? Woody's back? Woody's back? And you're sure it's Bo Peep who's with him? Thank you, Benson. Make sure the others are ready. Woody's back! I'm coming, Bonnie! Bonnie. First, we must prepare for his arrival. Prepare? Have you ever played hideandseek? No. But it sounds complicated. Oh, it's easy. I'll teach you, okay? Okay. The first thing you do is... one of us finds a place to hide... Scary. then tries to find them. What are we doing? Shh! Just stand there and be quiet! I'll do the talking. Hi, Tinny! Aw, nice to see you, too. Yeah, he's with me. My friend? No, no, no. He's my accessory. Hey, guys. Bo! Long time no see. Couldn't take it out there, huh? Hey, Doug. Saw your better half at the front of the store. Yeah, you mess with the cat, you get the claws. Bo came back! Magic 8Ball was right! Excuse me. Sorry. What are you doing here? I thought the store had no return policy! Bo, help me out. I need a battery. We got to get  this wagon train amovin'! Agreed. Help, help, help. Cheater. Have you seen Duke? He's in the back. Look who jumped 40 school buses and landed back into my life. Hi, Duke! Who's the cowboy? Duke, meet Woody. Woody, meet... Duke Caboom. Canada's greatest stuntman. Oh, yeah! Yes! Huh? He's posing. Duke? Duke, we need to... Hold on. One more. Oh, yeah! What brings you back, Peep? We need your help. Gabby Gabby has his toy and my sheep. No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff? Those are my girls. What were you doing getting tangled up with Gabby Gabby? You know better. Yeah, some toy thought it would be a good idea... to wander into the aisle. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't, does it? Everybody knows the best route is behind the shelves. That would have been a better route, wouldn't it? Wow, this toy sounds like a complete idiot. He does! Wait, are you that toy? So, here's the plan. We need to jump over the aisle to Gabby's cabinet. And you are the toy to do it. No. Duke. Nope. Duke? Duke? Nuhuh. No way! Duke. Duke! Pass. Negative. Duke. Rejected. Oh, please, Mr. Caboom, this is really important. My kid... You have a kid? Uh... Hey, Duke, show us some more poses, what do you say? I had a kid. Oh, no. Rejean. Rejean was so excited when he got me after Christmas. It was the happiest Boxing Day  of my life. That's Duke Caboom,  riding the amazing  Caboom stunt cycle! Caboom!  I was ready to finally  do what I was made to do. Caboom!  But when Rejean realized  I couldn't jump as far as the toy  in the commercial... It's a commercial! It's not real! Rejean threw me away! It's not fair! Why, Rejean? Why? Okay, okay. Calm down, Duke. That was a long time ago. Right now, we need the only toy who can crash us onto Gabby's cabinet. Crash? Crash? Any Duke Caboom toy can land... but you are the only one that can crash the way you do. I am? Yes! Forget Rejean. Forget your commercial. Be the Duke you are right now... the one who jumps and crashes! Be who I am right now. Who's the Canuck with all the luck? Caboom? Who's the greatest of the Great White North? Caboom! Who's the most spectacular daredevil Canada has ever seen? Duke Caboom! Can you do the jump? Yes, I Canada! Uhhuh. We've got our ride. Yes! Yeehaw!  Yo, Bo! Gigs! You made it! Good work! How'd you get it? How do we get that key? It was hard. Very difficult. Barely made it out alive. Yeah. So, you're welcome. Okay. Let's do this. Let me wrap that up for you. Don't want anything to happen to it on the way home. Good. That sale buys us some time. Wait for it. All right, let's go! So, how long were you in here? I don't know. Couple years. I didn't wanna sit on a shelf waiting for my life to happen. So, I left. Wow. You've handled this lost toy life better than I could. Aw, Sheriff. You're selling yourself short. I think you'd make a great lost toy. You really don't think you'll ever be in a kid's room again, huh? Nope. And now with the carnival traveling through, it's our chance to hop a ride... and leave town. You're leaving? Sure am. You ever think about getting out there, seeing the world? Without a kid? No. You can't teach this old toy new tricks. You'd be surprised. So, how'd you end up in this store in the first place? Well, I saw your lamp in the window... and I thought maybe you were inside... and so I, uh... Wow. Yeah. Will you look at that? This is the only part of the store I ever liked. That's gonna be quite a jump for you and Duke. For me? Didn't I tell you? You're going with him. I am? Let's caboom. It'll be fine, Duke's the best. Yeah, at crashing. And now! Go! Whoa! Huh? Rejean. It's a commercial.  It's not real! I can't do this! I'm sorry, Rejean! No, no, no! What's new, pussycat? Forky? Girls? Forky, where are you? You're never gonna find me. Forky? Woody! How'd you find me? Bo, I found him! Hi. Wait, it's an actual fork? Bo! Bo! Bo! Buzz! The dummies are gone! What? Where'd they go? Okay, we can go now! No. I need to find my girls. Hello, Woody. Hi, Bo. Where are my sheep? Yeah! Look! Woody found me! Take the bunny! I'm too cute to die! Hiya! Oh, no, no! Woody! I just wanna talk. Yeah, with my voice box! Pull! Whoa! You're my favorite deputy.  Somebody's poisoned  the water hole. I'd like to join your posse.  Reach for the sky!  Girls! Drop it. No! No! Forky! We've gotta go! Wait! Forky! Woody! Bonnie's backpack? Ahh! Giggle! Don't let Woody leave! Grab on! Duke, get us out of here! Oui!  Here, kitty, kitty! Wait! We don't have Forky! Woody! Forky! Is everyone okay? Shh. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Bunny? Bunny? Bunny! No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, Bunny! It's gonna be okay. Forky's still in there. If we hurry, we can get him before they lock him up. You want us to go back in there? We barely got out alive. Woody, it's better if we wait. No, no, no. There's no time. We can easily get back inside. But I saw Bonnie's... By my count, there were only four dummies. But the backpack... We outnumber them. So we have the advantage. Woody, look at us! Nobody is with you. It's over, okay? No. No, no, no. We are wasting time. We can do this. Come on, Pullstring. It's not worth it. Yeah, yes, listen to her! Nobody wants this! I do! Why? Because! Why? Just because! Why? Because it's all I have left to do! I don't have anything else. So, the rest of us don't count? That's not what I meant. Bonnie needs Forky. No. You need Bonnie! Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. It can't be just about the one you're still clinging to. It's called loyalty. Something a lost toy wouldn't understand. I'm not the one who's lost. Let's get out of here. We've got a carnival that leaves in the morning. Come on. Mmmhmm. We'll find our own kid. You're crazy. Bo! Bye, Woody. Good luck with Bonnie. Woody, you did all you could. Time to go home. No. Woody. I don't leave toys behind, Buzz. Yeah, but, Woody, you're actually leaving... Not now. Not ever. And he left me behind. What now, inner voice? Mission  accomplished. Return to base. Go back to the RV? What about Woody? We're going home,  space ranger. Fall back, this planet...  Retreat! There's too...  Go! Time to fly! Exit the...  Back... Run... Get out!  Returning to Star Command. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot, inner voice. Harmony, honey, help Grandma close up for the night. Okay. Then can we go to the carnival? Sure. Ahhh! Hello, Woody. I knew you'd be back. You don't know me. But I do. You were left in the closet, feeling useless... wondering if you'll ever get played with. I'm not leaving without Forky. Can we agree on just one thing? What? That being there for a child is the most noble thing a toy can do. Okay. I was defective right out of the box. I can only imagine what it must have been like for you. All that time you spent with Andy... riding a bike with him for the first time... comforting him when he skinned his knee... proudly watching him grow up. And then you got a second chance with Bonnie... giving her comfort when she's scared at school... helping her when she needs it most. You've been there through all their ups and downs. Please. Be honest with me. Was it as wonderful as it sounds? It was. All I want is a chance for just one of those moments. I'd give anything to be loved the way you have. Just leave me Forky. Bonnie needs him. Of course. The flat tire is fixed! Come on, Woody, hurry up. Where is he? Buzz! Buzz! Where's Woody? And Forky? We have a situation. They need to be extracted from the antique store. How do we do that? Okay, let's make sure we have everything. Finally. It's okay. Any minute now... Bonnie will notice her backpack is missing. She'll realize she left it at the antique store... and we'll head back in there. Okay. Looks like we have everything. You good, Bonnie? Yup. Great. Let's get out of here. Okay, genius, what do we do now? Hmm. Scanning perimeter.  Laser at full power!  Buzz, what are you doing? I'm thinking. Honey, will you please shut that toy off? Yeah, I got it. Attack!  Meteor shower! Look out! It's a secret mission in  uncharted space! Let's go! Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!  Bonnie, how do you turn this off? Full speed ahead!  Open the pod bay doors!  I don't know. It's just you and me now,  cadet. A distress signal is coming  from that rocket. Just toss it in the drawer. To infinity and beyond!  Uhoh. Uh, your backpack's in the antique store! Let's go! Oh, no, my backpack! I left my backpack in the antique store! You did? All right, let's swing by and get it. Ugh! I can't believe the nerve of that cowboy. I mean, who does he think he is? Exactly! He was way out of line. You did the right thing leaving him behind. Hey, Lamb Chops? Hmm. Coast is clear. Oh. Head to the middle. When the carnival leaves tomorrow, we'll hide right there. Uh, no way! Stuff that. Awesome. Stick with me. You'll be fine. Ready? No! And another thing, Woody asked you for help. On your mark... And he treats you like that? ...get set... He only cares about himself. No! You're wrong. Woody's always trying to do right by his kid. By putting everyone in danger. Ugh. That kind of crazy loyalty just... You gotta love him for it. Whoa, say what now? Hey, hey, hey, Bo! What's the plan? Fill me in here. Get in! We're going back. We just got here. You heard Bo! We're going back! Move your plush! Let's ride! You're my favorite...  Yay! You are my best friend.  Let's play all day!  Oh, Benson! Did you hear that? Isn't that lovely? Time for tea.  Oh, thank you, Woody. Thank you! All my dreams are coming true because of you. Thank you! Thank you! Uh, you're welcome. It's time, Benson. Goodbye, Forky. I'm going to miss our talks. Me, too. Good luck, Gabby. Thank you, my little utensil. Bye, Gabby! Goodbye, Benson! He is terrifying. Hello. Hi. Bonnie? Can I help you with anything? Yeah. We called about the backpack. Oh, yes. I couldn't find it. Feel free to look around. Quick! Before she finds it! Look! There's Harmony. You make me so happy!  Let's be best friends.  Oh, this is it! We're going home, Forky! Huh? Forky! Oh! No, no, no. Woody, look! It's really happening! I'm Gabby Gabby,  and I love you. I'm gonna cry. Oh, what have you got there? I found this old doll. You can take it home if you want. Nah. What happened? Gabby was supposed to be her toy. There's my backpack! Mom, it's over here. Forky! Mom, I found him! Oh, there he is! Now, please leave him in there, so he doesn't get lost again. But what about Gabby? Forky, listen to me very carefully. This is important. Tell Buzz to get the RV to the merrygoround. You understand? Absolutely. What is a merrygoround? The spinny ride with lights and horses. Oh. You mean a carousel. Yes! Carousel. Yes! Meet me at the carousel. Got it. Gabby! Hey, Gabby! You can have your voice box back. I don't need it anymore. Oh, yes, you do. Harmony wasn't your only chance, Gabby, but we have to hurry. Come on. No. Harmony was my chance. My time's over. Now, please go away. You hear that? A friend once told me... ""There are plenty of kids out there."" And one of them is named Bonnie. She's waiting for you, right now. She just doesn't know it yet. What if you're wrong? Well, if you sit on a shelf the rest of your life... you'll never find out, will you? He's right. I learned that from the best. Come on, Gabby. Let's get you to Bonnie. The carousel? Yeah, it's the spinny ride with lights and horses. Woody said to meet him there. You gotta be kidding! How do we do that? Oh! We could, uh... We are not sending Dad to jail. You're no fun. Left turn in 0.5 miles.  Wait a second. I have an idea. Skunk! Skunk! Too many people. Gonna need an alternate route. Will we make it to the carousel in time? Yes, we Canada! What? What is it? Recalculating. Take a right. What? A right? Right turn ahead. Huh. Does the GPS sound funny to you? Honey, it's fine. Just drive. Hmm, I thought it sounded funny. Another right! Right. Take another right. Huh? Another right? Really? Turn right! Now! Turn right! We're headin' back. There's the carousel! Do you think Woody will get there in time? Nope. Forget it. Never. No. No way. Declined. No dice. Rejected. Duke, Duke, you got this. This is the fastest way to the carousel. You made the last jump. Yeah, but that was 4 feet. This is 40! Exactly! Duke Caboom would never repeat a stunt. No. He'd never do that. No, no, no. He's the toy that went on to crash 40 feet into that target! Yeah, he is. I'm Duke Caboom! Oh, man. I can do this! Yes, you Canada! I can do it with my eyes closed. Yes, you... What? Three, two, one. Go! What? No, wait! What is he doing? Oh, no. This is for you, Rejean. Caboom. Yes! He did it! All right, our turn! You heard the sheriff. Let's go. Yeehaw! Another right! Another right? That's the wrong way. Are you sure? Stupid rental. I'm turning us around. No! Huh? Recalculating. Turn right. Must be broken. No! No! What is happening? Honey, what are you doing? Slow down! I can't! I can't! Press the brake. Press it! I'm trying. Got a visual on the RV, heading southbound. Gabby? Gabby? I think she's lost. Are you sure? Change of plans. Pull over.  I can't! This is a rental! I don't know what's happening! I'm so nervous. What if she doesn't like me? Gabby. I don't know if I can do this. Gabby, it's just like you said. This is the most noble thing a toy can do. Okay. Just edge yourself a bit into the light. Not too far. That's it. Perfect. Winner, winner... Chicken dinner. Are you lost, too? I'm Gabby Gabby.  Will you be my friend? I'll help you. Excuse me, can you... Can you help us? Oh, honey, what's wrong? I can't find my mom and dad. It's okay. I'll help you find them. I'm sure they're not far. She was right next to us. She was right here! And I looked away for one second. Mommy! I couldn't find you... and then I found this doll. You did? Her name is Gabby Gabby. Whoa. We actually did that. Oh, yeah. Yes! That was amazing. We make a great team, guys. Pull over now!  Almost there. Stop! Stop! Are we home? Huh? Sir, will you please step out of the vehicle? Dad's totally going to jail. Everyone, topside. Let's move. Forky, I've got a very important job for you. For me? Have a good night. What the...? You've gotta be kidding me. Hey. Um... So long, cowboy. Happy trails. Billy, Goat, Gruff. Take care of her, girls. I'm glad I got to see you again. I... I don't... Goodbye, Bo. Buzz, I... I... She'll be okay. Bonnie will be okay. You sure? Hey. Listen to your inner voice. Bo? Is it really her? I'll be danged, it's Bo! Jessie. Bo! Oh! So long, Forky. Forky? Who's watching the doors? Go, go, go! Oh, boy. Oh, my goodness. The awning. What is going on? Does this mean Woody's a lost toy? He's not lost. Not anymore. To infinity... And beyond. Yay! There goes another one. We're never getting outta here. Psst. Frog legs. Up here, Rainbow Connection. You Mr. Toads wanna take a wild ride with a kid? We can make that happen. You can? Really? Oh, yeah! Leave it to us, Jeremiah. Aw. All right. Nice job, gang! Every prize with a kid. What's next? Leave that to us. We know exactly what to do. Mmmhmm. Plush Rush! How you like that, huh? You got plushrushed, son! Dance! Dance! Get those knees up! Let's see those feet move! Whoo! Or we can get more toys to kids. Yeah, let's do that. Do you really have laser eyes? Yeah. Whoa. Hi, toys. Bye, toys. Jessie's back! What's first grade like? Tell me everything! Well, it was... How was ""Present and Explain""? Uh, you mean ""Show and Tell"" there, big guy. You see any kids eat paste? Guys, listen! Bonnie had a great day in first grade. She even made a new friend in class. Oh, she's already making friends. No, no, she made a new friend. Come on out, it's okay. Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Forky. Trash? No, no. Toy. I am a... We are all toys. Unique, beautiful toys. I will explain everything. How am I alive? I don't know. I was a lonesome cowboy  Lonesome as I could be  You came along  and changed my life And fixed  what was broken in me I was a lonesome cowboy  I didn't have a friend  Now I got friends  coming out of my ears I'll never be lonesome again  You can't be happy  when you're all by yourself Go on, tell me I'm wrong  You're wrong  When someone takes you  down from the shelf And plays with you some  It's wonderful Wonderful  I was a lonesome cowboy  But not anymore  I just found out  What love is about I've never  felt this way before I was a lonesome cowboy  But not anymore ?  Caboom! Yes!"
Winnie the Pooh,Disney,2010,2011,Animation,"This could be the room of any small boy. But, in fact, it's not. It is the room of one young boy in particular named Christopher Robin. Now, Christopher Robin has a very active imagination, not to mention the uncanny ability to collect things. Big things. Small things. Sticky things. But his favourite things are his stuffed animals. Ah! There they are now. A charming and eccentric cast of characters. And his best friend among them is a bear named Winnie the Pooh. Or Pooh for short. Together they had many unusual adventures, that all happened right here in the Hundred Acre Wood.  Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood  Where Christopher Robin plays  You'll find the enchanted neighbourhood  Of Christopher's childhood days  A donkey named Eeyore is his friend  And Kanga and little Roo and Tigger, too  There's Rabbit and Piglet and there's Owl  But most of all Winnie the Pooh  Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh  Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff  He's Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh  Willynilly silly old bear  Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh  Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff  He's Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh  Willynilly silly old bear  Chapter one, in which Winnie the Pooh has a very important thing to do. As the sun rose over the Hundred Acre Wood, Pooh leapt out of bed and greeted the day with much enthusiasm. Ooh... Honey. Uh, Pooh? More honey, please. I say, Pooh? Pooh? Oh, do wake up. Pooh! Oh! Oh, bother. I was having the most wonderful dream. Yes, but it's time to wake up. You have a very important thing to do today. Like what? Well, if I told you that, I'd ruin the rest of the story, wouldn't I? Of course. What could be more important than a little something to eat? Or perhaps a little larger something. Oh, not to worry, tummy. I always know what to do.  A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy  He fills it with things that are sweet  A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy  By never forgetting to eat  When it is growly and glummy a search for the honey is on  The Pooh has a knack for finding a snack  Unless all the honey is... Gone?  A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy  No need for the tummy to fret  A Pooh Bear takes care of his tummy  He knows what his tummy must get  Don't worry, my round little chummy  I'm hearing your ravenous plea  When there is no honey the Pooh takes the tummy  Wherever the honey will be  My friends are out there with honey to spare  And they will take care of my tummy and me  Bother. I know that sigh. Good morning, Eeyore. Lovely day, isn't it? Wish I could say yes, but I can't. Oh my, Eeyore. You wouldn't happen to have any honey lying about, would you? You see, I seem to have run out. Oh, yes. Good idea, tummy. Perhaps I should look in back. Bother. No honey in here, either. What? Eeyore, what has happened to your tail? What has happened to it? Well... ...it isn't there. That accounts for a good deal. That explains everything. No wonder. Oh! There it is. I'd recognize it anywhere. The very tree where I was hatched. I remember the day Mother made these marks, her giant meaty claw carving furrows in the crumbly bark. Chapter one, the birth of a genius. Pardon me, Owl. What are you doing? Hmm? Oh, hello, Pooh. Eeyore. Why, I'm penning my personal memoirs. Yes. Now, where was I? Oh, yes, of course. With steely nerve... Perhaps you could take a short break from your important work and help us find Eeyore's tail? ...and I rocketed towards Eeyore's tail! Eeyore's tail? What's wrong with Eeyore's tail? Well, it isn't there. Yes. So I see. Won't you help us, Owl? You have such a talent for speaking and telling us what to do. Oh, thank you, Pooh. Yes, I do, don't I? I didn't think anyone noticed. All right, take this. Write this down carefully. Now, the customary procedure in such cases is as follows. Excuse me, Owl, but what does ""Crustimoney Proseedcake"" mean? For I am a bear of very little brain and long words bother me. It means ""the thing to do."" Oh. Well, as long as it means that, I don't mind. All right. Yes, well, the thing to do is as follows: First, issue a reward to the... Gesundheit. I beg your pardon? Well, you sneezed just as you were going to tell me what the first thing to do was. I didn't sneeze. No, you did, Owl. No, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it. Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed. As I was saying, first, issue a reward. He's doing it again. You must be catching a cold. I'll probably catch it, too. No, no, no! I'm not catching a cold. The word is ""issue,"" not ""achoo"", and ""achoo"" isn't even a word. It's just a sort of sneezy sound like achoo! Perhaps you should lie down, Owl? Oh! My throat feels a little scratchy. Open wide, please. Ahh. Just as I suspected. Owl, we need honey. Enough of this infernal folderol! Look, the thing to do is, we write a notice promising a large something to anyone who finds a replacement tail for Eeyore! Is that clear? That sounds like a wonderful plan, Owl. Excellent. Now, we shall get Christopher Robin to write out the notices, and we'll put them up all over the forest. Here you are, Pooh. Oh, and make sure everyone can see them. Oh, I will, Christopher.  Come one, come two, come all Everyone heed the call  There's a very important thing to do  Drop what you're doing and come  Bumpitybumpitybum  There's a very important thing to do  It's time to gather 'round The work has just begun  And when it's done then you'll have found  That you have had some fun  With a monumentuous, consequentuous  Very important thing to do  There we are. And now, I shall return to... Oh! Hello, B'loon. We have a very important thing to do today. Oh, yes. Perhaps you'd like to join us? Poor Eeyore. He's lost his tail. Consider yourself pounced. That was a close call there, Pooh Bear. This guy... and I'm talking to you... ...he was sneaking up on ya. Whoo! Oh! A slippery little devil, eh? Get back here! Oh, no, you don't. Come here. Whoo! Well, I must have scared him off. Um... Tigger? Yes, my good man? Why, you. Here, take some of that! What is this? Oh, really? Sticking to me now. This isn't working out the way I was hoping. Make him go away. Oh, dear. Get him off of me! Is he still there? Oh, yes. He's still here. And I think he wants to stick with you. What? I never thought of having a sidekick before. I got to admit, he is a handsome devil. Look at the chin on this kid. No, no. I can't do it, I tell you. It's too risky. Why, if something were to happen to this little guy, I just couldn't live with myself. It's a dangerous path I bounce. But I bounce it alone. Because the Hundred Acre Wood needs a hero, Pooh Bear, and I'm the only one.  Oh, I'm bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!  But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is  I'm the only one I'm the only one!  Hoohoohoohoo! Attention, please. Attention. Something tragic has befallen a member of our community. I present to you: Exhibit A. Oh! That is tragic. What? Oh, no, no, no. Eeyore, will you turn around, please? Oops, sorry. Our dear friend Eeyore has lost his tail. Oh, dear. We mustn't leave him in this condition. So, we will have a contest to find a new tail for Eeyore. I do say, Christopher Robin, the winners of such contest are traditionally awarded some form of remuneration. What is a ""remooner""... Moonyour... A renew... What are we renumbering? I don't know, Pooh, but it sounds like a good thing. Oh, yes, it is a good thing, Piglet. It's a prize. But what shall it be? How about something great, like a firecracker! Oh, gracious, no. How about something nice, like a warm hug? Pruning shears. I need pruning shears. I'd say thistles, but nobody listens to me, anyway. Oh, Christopher Robin, I was hoping for something a bit... sweeter? Why, Pooh, that's a grand idea. The prize for a new tail shall be... a pot of honey. Hooray! As the others searched for a tail, Pooh realized that a pine cone would not win him the honey. Why not? Because it would have to be something special. Oh. Special, you say. Special. Think, think, think. No hurry, Pooh. Just take your time. Take my time. What a wonderful idea. Cuckoo, cuckoo. Thanks, Pooh. Congratulations. You've won the contest.  It's Pooh  It's Pooh Pooh wins the honey pot  Found a tail for his friend  Now it's on my rear end  You get the honey Enjoy  I knew it was too good to be true. Oh, dear. Well, rules are rules. So sorry, Pooh. Excuse me. We could give B'loon a try! Whoa! How clever, Piglet. What do you think, Eeyore? Sure is a cheerful colour. Guess I'll have to get used to it.  It's Piglet It's Piglet  Piglet wins the honey pot  Takes the prize fair and square I'm still a bit up in the air.  You get the honey Enjoy  Hmm. This may not work after all. And so they tried a great many things. They tried... ...and they tried... ...and they tried... ...and they tried, and they tried and tried, and they tried... ...until... ...they had run out of things to try. It's OK. I'll learn to live without it. Poor dear. You know, I may have just the thing. Up, up, up you go. There you are. It's an awful nice tail, Kanga. Much nicer than the rest of me.  It's Kanga No! No, no, no, no. How about we celebrate with silence?  Enjoy  Oh, bother. My tummy is feeling a little 11 o'clockish. Do you still tell the time, clock friend? I can't tell by the expression on your face. Pooh left feeling unsatisfied and a little out of sorts. In fact, he was so distracted by his rumbly tummy, that he didn't notice that he was walking onto the next paragraph. What is a paragraph? It's a group of sentences that form a complete thought. Is there honey in this paragraph? Oh, sorry, Pooh, no. Well, then I don't find it very useful. What's that, Pooh? I'm not sure. I shall follow it to see where it leads. Eeyore, your tail! Yep. Unravelled. Guess I'm back where I started. I'm sorry, Eeyore. Such a nice tail, too. No matter. All good things come to an end. Oh. Oh! Eeyore, if you... Oh, my goodness. This story is going too fast! I wish that paragraph had been a little longer. Ooh! Of course. Christopher Robin will have some honey. He loves to share. Especially with me. Christopher Robin! Are you not there? Oh. Just then, Pooh spotted a note. I did? Certainly. Just there, at your feet. Oh... Uh, to your left. Uh, no, Pooh, your other left. A little bit more. A tad. A hair. No, no, back a bit. Oh! There you are. Well, it's a good thing I noticed it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen it. Pooh was puzzled by the note. Even more so than usual. And even more than that. So, Pooh decided to go directly to Owl's house, hoping that Owl could help unpuzzle him.  You get the honey Enjoy  Good job, Owl! Thank you. Thank you. Yes, it is quite clever, isn't it? TAEL. Yes. Perfect. Well, hello there, Owl. That is a very fine looking pot of honey you've got there. And so remarkably... gooey. Gooey? That happens to be my personal favourite. Ooh! What do you have there, my boy? Oh. A note I found at Christopher Robin's. With strange words I cannot read. But, Pooh, you can't read most words. Yes, but especially not the strange ones. Let me see. There's never been a note written that I could not decipher. Here, Pooh, help yourself. Yes, parchment is of a fine quality. Oh, stuff and fluff. Don't leave us in suspense, Owl. What does it say? Patience! Patience. One must be careful when decoding such arcane text so as not to incorrectly interpret its true meaning. So, can you read it? Of course I can! It says... ""Gone out. Busy. Backson. Signed, Christopher Robin."" Our dear friend Christopher Robin has been captured! What? By a creature called ""The Backson."" Backson! Captured by the Backson! What's a Backson? Ooh! A horrible creature! Malicious! You don't say. Ferocious! Fero... ?! Ooh! And worst of all, terribly busy. So, what does this Backson look like? I saw a picture of one just the other day. Oh, Christopher Robin. Now, let me see. Bathwater, biscuit, baby, barnacle, beluga... Wait a minute, why is biscuit ahead of baby and barnacle? That doesn't make sense. Oh, it's such a mess in here. Dash it all! Where is that picture? I have some chalk, Owl. Can you draw it? What an excellent idea, young man. Artistic talent runs through my family. In fact, it practically stampedes! In fact, it practically stampedes! He sounds scary already.  It's a giant creature with a tail  Here, I'll draw Piglet in for scale Oh, dear!  Its hide is like a shaggy rug  Its face a surly, ugly mug  With two sharp horns atop its head  Between a mop of hair that's red  And in its nose a ring of gold It smells of monkey's feet and mould  Its toes are black, its fur is blue  I swear that all I tell you is not made up  The Backson  The Backson?  The Backson  The Backson?  Oh, no!  But, Owl, what does a Backson do?  Yes, Owl, what does a Backson do?  Hmm, what does a Backson do?  I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking  And now I will tell you  They sneak into your library and scribble in all your books  The Backson, the Backson We don't like the Backson  When decorating your Christmas tree they tangle up all the hooks  The Backson, the Backson We're afraid of the Backson  They spoil the milk They stop all the clocks  They use their horns to put holes in your socks  The Backson's the one who's been putting holes in our socks  Tell us more about what Backsons do  Yes, more about what Backsons do  More about what Backsons do?  Why don't we hear some thoughts from you?  Maybe they make you sleep too late  Yes, yes That's good, that's great  I bet they're the reason my tail is gone  You're on a roll Go on, go on  They muddy up your tidy house  They make you feel as small as a mouse  They break your crayons  They spill your tea  They wake up babies at one and three  They made me catch the cold I caught  They made me lose my train of thought  They swipe your stripes  They clog your pipes  They dig up your garden  They won't beg your pardon  They eat your snacks  They won't relax  They chip your tooth  They steal your youth  And now you know the horrible truth The Backson, the Backson The Backson, the Backson  Oh, no  Oh, yes Huh?  I know exactly what to do  We'll find things Backsons are partial to  Like books  And dishes  And socks  And toys  Yes, everything that a Backson destroys  Then we'll dig an enormous pit and make the items lead to it  He'll fall in and we'll get our friend  And this horrible nightmare can come to an end  The Backson  The Backson  The Backson  The Backson  Go home and search your closets Bring everything that you can  The Backson, the Backson We're gonna catch the Backson  We'll save Christopher Robin by following Rabbit's plan  The Backson, the Backson We'll save Christopher Robin  We must be brave and have no fear  So to the death, we'll persevere  We'll search by the sun and the light of the moon  And if everything goes well we'll be back soon Back soon.  Back soon Sounds like ""Backson.""  Back soon  Oh, well. Good luck, everyone! While Rabbit and the others were busy gathering the Backson's favourite things, Pooh and Piglet found the perfect place to dig the pit. Piglet dug, and dug, and dug. And Pooh supervised. And now to disguise the pit. Catch, Piglet. Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works. Oh, it will, Piglet. The Backson shall follow the trail of items right to this lovely picnic. Which is just the pit, of course. And when he falls in, we'll get Christopher Robin back. Yes, Piglet. We shall get Christopher Robin back. Very exciting. What do you think, Pooh? Hmm. I think this rock would be better over there. Here? Oh, yes. That makes all the difference, you see. Oh! I almost forgot the most important part. Oh, yes, Piglet. I couldn't agree more. Hmm? Oh, Piglet, this is a very light lunch. No, Pooh. This isn't lunch. I just thought it would complete the disguise. Well, it certainly fooled me. Well done, you two. Now, put your combat gear on. This is a dangerous mission, and we cannot afford any mistakes. The fate of Christopher Robin is in our hands. Ah! As the group continued on with Rabbit's plan, they journeyed deeper and deeper into the woods, placing items as they... Hey, hey! You want to keep it down up there, pal? What? Tigger? Why aren't you with the others? Because. I'm busy tracking the Backson. Shhshhshh. Yes, but what about Rabbit's plan? Only a Tigger can catch a Backson. And I'm the only Tigger, see. Hello. Hoo! I probably deserved that. Oops! Look who it is! Hoohoo! Let me get off your back. There we go. I thought you were the Backson! Until I found out you wasn't. What are you doing out here, anyways? Too slow. Got left behind. Left behind? That's a horrendemous thing to do to a guy. No matter. Sure would like to help Christopher Robin, but I can't. Hmm. Buddy! Where do you think you're going? You and me are gonna catch that Backson together! Thanks, but I... That's the spirit! Here we go! Pouncy, pouncy, pounce! You and me! Oh, yeah! Look out, Backson! OK, we're back. Look at us pounce! I'm alone. OK. Hoo. Buddy, if you're gonna pounce, you got to have some bounce! We just need to get you Tiggerized.  Gonna fix you up By the time we're through  I'll be Tigger One You'll be Tigger Two  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great  Gonna be two pals hunting in the woods  Gonna show that Backson we got the goods  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great  Well, I'm not sure  Oh, stop that gloomy rumination  All you need is a little bit of Tiggerization  Wait  Why wait?  Don't you see it's gonna be great  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great You're looking great, Tigger Two. Now, you've got to learn to bounce like a Tigger.  When you learn to bounce you should take it slow  So I want you to keep your bounces low  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great Whoa!  If you hit a bush or a tree you'll fall so do your best to avoid them all  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great  A perfect pounce will make you feel alive  Just go from a squat into a headlong dive! Ow, ow, ow.  You're gettin' it now  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great Ahh. Isn't this superduper fun, two Tiggers here together?  I used to be the only one But two is twice as better. Are you ready? For what? I'll... be... the...  Backson, you be the Tigger  We're gonna see whose bounce is bigger  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great  You're gonna give me your best attack  But don't just think that I won't fight back  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be great  Strike me down Give me all you got  Bounce me, trounce me Flounce me, pounce me  Do it, do it, do it! Ow.  It's gonna be great It's gonna be great  It's gonna be...  Great  Tigger Two! That was the bestest picking up bounce I never seen! In fact, we're going to skip right ahead to advanced Tigger training. Where did you go, you little bouncer? Ooh. Going bareknuckled. Look at this guy. I like your style! Now this is just ridicerous! You are gonna need this if you're gonna get the Backson! Ohoh! Backson tracks! The Backson must have got Tigger Two! He's picking us off. One by one. Gosh, Pooh, I hope the Backson is pleased with all of our items. I'm sure he will be. Oh. I wish I had some honey. Piglet, um, could you come here, please? Pooh, are you sure this is going to work? Well, of course, Piglet. Once I get you up in the tree, just hand me the beehive. And then tummy and I will take care of the rest, won't we? OK, Pooh. I guess you've thought this through. Oh, yes, Piglet. Indeed I have. Oh, bother. I don't remember thinking that through. Um, I'm sorry I messed up the plan, Pooh. Oh, don't worry, Piglet. I shall get you out, and we'll try again. It's no use. Think, think, think. Ah! I know. I'll have you down in just a moment, Piglet. No hurry, Pooh. The bees are quite gentle. As long as there's no sudden movement. Ah! Oh, my! Pooh, are you sure that's a good idea? Oh, yes, Piglet. Ah! I'm quite sure. Well, you know best, Pooh. Ah! Oh. Oh. There we are. Oops. New plan, Piglet. Run! OK. Oh... Is this fast enough, Pooh? I suppose you could run a little faster. Whoa! Ooh! And this can go here. All done. It takes a smart rabbit to trap a Back... Oh! What are you two doing? Beehives are not on my list of Backsonfriendly items! But, Rabbit, the... Move along, move along. Well, I was moving. Oh, that Backson is sure to pick up this trail, and we don't want to be around when he does. Come, come! Go, go, go! Rabbit, please, can we stop for lunch? Pooh, we cannot rest until Christopher Robin is rescued. Try thinking of him instead of honey. Very well. Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin! Ooh. It worked. Much better. Does anybody see that? See what, honey? Honey? Ooh! I can't wait to see the honey on that Backson's honey when he falls into our honey. Eh, Owl? That cheeky honey will honey twice before honeying our honey again. After we honey the honey, can I honey a honey? Uhuhuh. No honey before honey, honey. Wha... ? Honey up, Pooh. We have to honey. Honey. Ooh, honey! Yes. Honey. As Pooh watched the honey honey away, his honey honey honey honey honey honey honey honey honey honey honey... Ooh, Christopher Robin, Christopher Robin, Christopher... hoohoohoo, Christopher Robin.  Honey  Honey, honey, honey, honey  Honey, honey, honey, honey  Honey, honey, honey, honey  Honey, honey  Honey, honey, honey, honey, Honey, honey, honey, honey  Honey, honey, honey, honey,  Honey, honey, honey, honey Honey? Honey. Honey! Honey!  Everything is honey everywhere I see  Everything is honey and that's quite all right with me  I am a bear of little brain I can't explain  Why everything would be changing to  The favourite snack of Winnie the Pooh Can you?  Everything is honey I can't get enough  Of lots and lots of pots and pots of sticky, licky stuff  Oh, what a sight Oh, what a dream  Dive in the wonderful honeyful stream  Swimming in the honey Swimming far and wide  Open up my mouth and let the honey flow inside  Ooey and gooey and very sweet Eat and eat then repeat  Suddenly I'm in a honey boat  It doesn't matter where we float Whoa!  'Cause everywhere is honey There's a honey Pooh  He's just made of honey so I guess I'll eat him too  If everything is honey and I am what I eat  I must be made of honey  And life is very sweet  Bother. What a lovely picnic! Oh, bother! Double bother. Pooh! Now where did that bear go? We searched all over, and no sign of him. The report from my aerial excursion is inconclusive. The plan worked. We caught the Backson! Oh! It sounds horrible! Now that we have him, Owl, you can go and get Christopher Robin back. No! No, I'm far too important to put myself in that predicament. Kanga, off you go. Oh, no, no, no. I'm with child. Send the pig. How about all of us go? All right, Backson. Give Christopher Robin back! Huh? Oh! Oh, bother! Pooh! Oh, hello. Oh, Pooh, you went back for the honey, didn't you? But I told you it was empty. Yes, and I believed you, Piglet. But my tummy had to see for himself. Poor, poor Pooh. How are we ever gonna get him out of there?  It's me, it's me  I win the honey pot  Found this anchor over there  Now it's on my derriÃ¨re  Not that anybody'd care  OK, everyone, make sure you have a good hold. Heaveho! Heaveho! Something tells me I was better off with Tigger. Heaveho! Yep. Oh, this is lovely. We are stuck down here, and the Backson is still up there. Oh, dear! Wait for me. No, Piglet! No, no, Piglet. Stay. But the Backson! You can help us if you stay up there! OK, Piglet, go look for something to get us out of here. OK. There might be something over by the pack. Thank goodness one of us is up there. I was worried we'd be stuck here forever. I found something. Here. What? Ooh. That's a lovely flower, Piglet. Yeah, I thought so, too. Yes, Piglet, it's very nice, a perennial. But I think we need something longer. Longer? Of course. How silly of me. Oh, good thought, Piglet. But you can't possibly think that that's long enough. Oh, yes, it is. Owl read this to me once, and it was certainly the longest thing I'd ever heard. Oh. It's true, Rabbit. It lags a bit in the middle. Of all things, why didn't we think to bring a rope? Well, there is this rope. Spoton, Piglet. Do be a helpful little swine and get us out of here. All of you? Yes, Piglet, all of us. All right. Three, four... Don't forget Rabbit. And six. There! Now you can all get out! How very thoughtful you are, Piglet. Good grief! Tie them together, Piglet. Can you tie a knot? I cannot. So, you can knot. No, I cannot knot. Not knot? Who's there? Pooh! Pooh who? No! Pooh, it's... Piglet, you'll need more than two knots. Not possible. Ah! So, it is possible to knot those pieces. Not these pieces. Yes, knot those pieces. Why not? Because it's all for naught. Oh, dear! I can't tie a knot. But there is something I can do. Don't worry, Rabbit. Piglet's very clever. I can tie a bow. See? For crying out loud! Piglet! I know! Christopher Robin has a jump rope. Ahh! Wait a minute. My gracious, that's it! Piglet, go to Christopher Robin's house. Oh, I see. Yes, Piglet, go, and bring some honey. Yes, bring some honey... The jump rope, Piglet, the jump rope. With a little honey on the side. You mean, all by myself? Through there? Yes, Piglet. Through a dark wood fraught with peril, on a mission of life or death. It is a task of great complexity, but I have full confidence that you shall return victorious, and rescue us from the abyss. Go forth, Piglet, and we shall await your return. For weeks, if necessary. Owl! What? I can't believe how wonderful that speech was. I can't, either. Moved me to tears. So Piglet bravely ventured forth towards Christopher Robin's house. But the further he went, the more frightened he became. Oh, dear. I mustn't fear. There's a very important thing to... Do... Oh. It's just you, B'loon. I'll get some help. Oh, dear. I am the help. How did you ever get stuck up there? It wasn't the Backson, was it? Oh, good. I knew the Backson wasn't around here. Backson! Huh?! Backson? Piglet, help! Whew. Let me tell you, that was the last time I'll ever put my beak in a keyhole. Shhshhshh! Do you hear something? Help! Help me! Piglet! He knows my name! Yeah! Whoa! Oh! Ah! Backson! Whew! It's only Tigger. Oh! Hi, fellas! Tigger Two? I thought the Backson got you. Ahh. As soon as we get out of here, we're gonna show that Backson what Tiggers are made of, aren't we? Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore. What? But what about all the pouncing and the trouncing? And the mixing it up? I thought you liked being a Tigger. The most wonderful thing about Tiggers, is you're the only one. Aw, shucks. I'm speechless. Excuse me. I can't breathe! Oh. Sorry about that, little guy. I didn't mean to scare you. Wait! B'loon! Don't leave! You're the only one who can get us out of here! We're all gonna die. Cheer up, Eeyore. We won't perish for days. Which leaves plenty of time for me to continue my memoirs. Now, dear Uncle Ridley...  Honey  ...exacerbated by my aunt's predilection for only the finest parchment... Hmm. ...woven so tightly the ink took weeks to fully dry. Their nest was littered with quills that were never used, papers that were never cut, and letters that never dried. My aunt often bemoaned the situation in letters that she couldn't write to me. It drove my poor uncle absolutely batty, which is quite a feat for an owl, I assure you. Now, when my uncle had committed an exceedingly rousing point... Empty. ...and let me tell you, it packed quite a wallop. Huh? Look! Look, the letters! The ladder! The ladders formed a letter! I mean the letters... We can get out! And so they all used the letter ladder to climb out of the pit. But little did they know that coming through the bushes was... Backson! Back to the pit! Wait, everyone. It's only me. Christopher Robin! You found them, B'loon. Well done. It's Christopher Robin! How did you escape from the Backson? Backson? What on earth is a Backson? He wakes up babies! He swipes your stripes! He puts out the lights! Yes, and we thought he took you from us. What gave you the idea I was taken by a Backson? Your note. Christopher Robin explained that it had all been a misunderstanding. And now that it was autumn, the school year had begun. His note was simply to say he had gone out and would be back soon. Oh! Ooh. Um... OK. It's getting late. We ought to be heading back. Just a moment, everyone. Just a moment, everyone. Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet. We owe a very special someone... ...a token of our appreciation. Ohh! This reward goes to a good friend and a loyal companion. Someone who not only helped us out of this pit, but also found Christopher Robin. And he just so happens to be wearing red today. So it is with great, great honour and a humble heart, that I bestow this pot of honey upon our dear friend... ...B'loon. Wonderful idea, Rabbit. Hooray! Hooray, B'loon! Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye. Hooray! Pooh watched as B'loon took the honey pot higher and higher, until it was completely out of sight. Oh, bother. Sorry, Pooh. Ever have one of those days where you just can't win, Eeyore? Yep. I know how you feel. Oh, yes. I simply must find some honey. As Pooh continued searching, he got hungrier... Oh! ...and hungrier... Yes, tummy, I know. ...and hungrier... Ohh... ...until he found himself at Owl's house. Well, stone the crows. If it isn't Pooh Bear. Hello, Owl. Well, congratulate me. For what? I have achieved completion of my autobiographical treatise! Oh! Was it painful? No, no, no. My memoirs are finished. Oh. Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep staring at that bell rope? Because it reminds me of something. And that reminds me of another something. Perhaps I could borrow some honey? Just a taste? A drop, perhaps? A small lick, I should think. My boy, I shall do better than that. Not only will I beckon you to my table, but as we feast, I shall treat you to an excerpt from chapter 127, which tells the gripping tale of how only a few days ago, I found that very handsome bell rope that you were admiring just hanging over a thistle bush. Thistle bush? Or was it a gorse bush? No. No. It was definitely a thistle bush. Pardon me, Owl. At first I thought someone lived there, so I rang it. No one answered. And then the thing just fell off in my hand. What sort of place was this particular thistle bush in? Certainly not a very cheery place. One might say it was rather... Gloomy? Yes. That's it. Do you know it? Oh, dear. Nobody seemed to want it, so I brought it home. Oh, but somebody did want it, Owl. Really? Who? Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was fond of it, you see. Fond of it? Attached to it. Attached? Ohh! Yes. Well, yes. And I was just keeping it safe for him. Well, there you are. And you can tell him he's welcome. Yes, Owl. And thank you very much. I say, Pooh! What about the honey? Some other time, perhaps? Ignoring his tummy's desperate pleas, Pooh went directly to Christopher Robin's. Tail. Nail. Hammer. So what do you think, Eeyore? I'll test it out. Seems about the right length. Pink bow's a nice touch. Swishes real good, too. So, are you happy, Eeyore? No. Ooh. But I sure do like this new tail. Thank you, Pooh. And now, I have a surprise for you, Pooh. I do like surprises. OK. Open your eyes. They're open, Christopher. No, silly. Put your arms down. Congratulations, Pooh. You win the grand prize!  It's Pooh It's Pooh  Pooh wins the honey pot  You're the winner of the prize  I really can't believe my eyes  Pooh gets the honey  Honey, honey, honey, honey Here you go, Pooh. Oh, yes, of course. Thank you all ever so much.  Everything is honey Everything is good  Everyone is happy in the Hundred Acre Wood  A honey happy ending for a Pooh to eat  Yes, everything is honey  And life is very sweet  You know, Pooh, you did a very important thing today. I did? Well, yes. Instead of thinking of your tummy, you thought of your friend. Oh, thank you, Christopher Robin. And now I don't think I shall be hungry again for a good long while. Oh, bother. Silly old bear. Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Wow! It's amazing what you can find in the woods. A marble! And a boot! And oh, my, that's a scarylookin' fella. Gosh! Maybe these are his things. You know, I better pick 'em up so they won't get broken. That's the last thing I would want. Whoa! Oh, my gosh! Is this a pit? I think I'm in a pit! Hello? Anybody up there? Oh, well. I sure hope that fella will be back soon."
Wreck it Ralph,Disney,2010,2012,Animation,"  My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.  Let's see. I'm nine feet tall. I weigh 643 pounds.  Got a little bit of a temper on me.   My passion bubbles very near the surface,  I guess, not gonna lie.  Anyhoo, what else? Uh...  I'm a wrecker. I wreck things. Professionally.  I'm very good at what I do. Probably the best I know.   The thing is, fixing is the name of the game.  Literally, FixIt Felix, Jr.  NICELANDERS Fix it, Felix!   So, yeah, naturally,  the guy with the name FixIt Felix is the good guy.  He's nice enough as good guys go.  Definitely fixes stuff really well.  But, uh, if you've got a magic hammer from your father,  how hard can it be?  If he was a regular contractor carpenter guy,  I guarantee you would not be able  to fix the damage that I do as quickly.  And when Felix does a good job, he gets a medal.  But are there medals for wrecking stuff really well?  To that I say, ""Ha!""   And, no, there aren't.   Thirty years I've been doing this  and I've seen a lot of other games come and go.  Kind of sad. I think about all those guys from Asteroids.  Boom! Gone. Centipede?  Who knows where that guy is, you know?  Look, a steady arcade gig is nothing to sneeze at.  I'm very lucky.  It's just, I got to say,  it becomes kind of hard to love your job  when no one seems to like you for doing it.  All clear! The arcade is closed! Shoryuken! Whoo! What a day! You want to head to Tappers, Ken? If you're buying, buddy. Quitting time! I don't know.  Maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way  if things were different after work.  But it is what it is.  Good job, everyone! Felix and the Nicelanders  go hang out in their homes  which he's just fixed, and everyone, you know...  They go to their homes, I go to mine  which happens to be a dump.  And when I say ""a dump, ""  I don't mean like a shabby place.  I mean an actual dump,  where the garbage goes  and a bunch of bricks and smashed building parts...  That's what I call home.  I guess I can't bellyache too much.  I got my bricks, I got my stump.  It looks uncomfortable. It's actually fine. I'm good.  But if I'm really honest with myself...  I see Felix up there getting patted on the back,  people are giving him pie and thanking him  and so happy to see him all the time.  Sometimes I think... Man, it sure must be nice being the good guy.  Nice share, Ralph. As fellow bad guys, we've all felt what you're feeling and we've come to terms with it. Really? Right here. I am Zangief. I am bad guy. Hi, Zangief! Hi, Zangief. I relate to you, Ralph. When I hit bottom, I was crushing man's skull like sparrow egg between my thighs.  And I think, ""Why do you have to be so bad, Zangief? ""Why can't you be more like good guy?"" Then I have moment of clarity. If Zangief is good guy, who'll crush man's skull like sparrow's egg between thighs? And I say, ""Zangief, you are bad guy, ""but this does not mean you are 'bad' guy.""  Right. I'm sorry. You lost me there. Zombie! Bad guy! Hi, Zombie. Hi, Zombie. Zangief saying labels not make you happy. Good! Bad!  You must love you. Yeah! Inside here! Yes. Okay. All right, I get you. Watch out. It's dripping. Question, Ralph. We've been asking you to BadAnon for years now and tonight you finally show up. Why is that? I don't know. I just felt like coming. I suppose it has something to do with the fact that... Well, today is the 30th anniversary of my game. Well, happy anniversary, Ralph. Thanks, Satan. Uh, it's Sateen, actually. Got it. But here's the thing.  I don't want to be the bad guy any more.  You can't mess with the program, Ralph. You're not going Turbo, are you? Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo! Come on, guys! Is it Turbo to want a friend? Or a medal? Or a piece of pie every once in a while? Is it Turbo to want more out of life? Yes! Ralph, Ralph, we get it. But we can't change who we are. And the sooner you accept that, the better off your game and your life will be. Hey. One game at a time, Ralph. Let's close out with the Bad Guy Affirmation. I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me. Okay, gang, see you next week. Listen, I can't do snacks next week. Hang in there, Ralph. Hey, Zombie, don't forget your hatchets. There you go.     Step aside, sir. Random security check. Random my behind! You always stop me. I'm just a surge protector doing my job, sir. Name? Lara Croft. Name? WreckIt Ralph! And where are you coming from? Uh... PacMan.  Did you bring any fruit with you? No! No. No fruit. Okay, then. Where are you heading? Fixll' Felix Jr.  Anything to declare? I hate you. I get that a lot. Proceed. Bad guy coming!  If you leave your game,  stay safe, stay alert,  and whatever you do, don't die.  Because if you die outside your own game  you don't regenerate.  Ever. Game over.  Here you go, buddy. It's fresh. Straight from PacMan's. Hang in there, guys.  Name?   Celebrate good times Come on!     Happy 30th Anniversary""? They're having a party without me. PacMan? They invited PacMan? That cherrychasing dotmuncher isn't even part of this game! Great party, Felix. Why, thank you, friend. Felix. You're needed on the dance floor!  Whoo! FixIt Felix! Whoowhoo! FixIt Felix!  Oh! I'll bet that's Mario. Fashionably late, per the norm. I'll get it, Felix.  Ahh!  It's Ralph!  He'll wreck the party! Hide the stemware! Get rid of him, Felix. Oh, right. I'll go talk to him. Carry on, everyone.  Ralph, can I help you? Hey, Felix. Just wanted to check on you. I saw a big explosion or something go over the building there. Oh, those were just fireworks. Fireworks. Okay. Phewf. Somebody's birthday, or... Well, it's more of an anniversary. The 30th anniversary of our game, actually. What? Is that today? I know! I'm such a dummy with dates. Anyway, uh, congratulations. Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.   Uh... Hi. Just a headsup, Felix. They're bringing out the cake in a few shakes. Hey, Glen. Ralph. Cake? Heard about this cake stuff.  Never had it. No one ever seems to throw it out so it never ends up in the dump. I never actually tasted it. Uh... I've always wanted to try cake. I don't suppose you'd like to come in and have a slice, would you? Hey0, everybody! Oh! Ah!  I'm okay. I'm okay. Fit as a fiddle.  Now, you all know Ralph. Evening.  Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana... Deanna. Big Gene! Why is he here? He's just here for a slice of cake. And I'm a big part of the game, technically speaking. Why are you here, Gene? Oh, look! The cake!  Well, I'll be dipped. You've really outdone yourself, Mary. Oh, and look! There's all of us at the top. Each apartment is everyone's favorite flavor. Norwood's is red velvet. Guilty! And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene, and for Felix... Hey, Mary. Um... What's the flavor of that mud that I'm stuck in there? Hmm? Oh. Chocolate. I've never been real fond of chocolate. Well, I did not know that. One other little thing. I hate to be picky, but this angry little guy here... My cake! ...might be a lot happier if you put him up here with everyone else. See that? Look at that smile. No, no. You see, Ralph, there's no room for you up here. What about this? We can make room. Here. We could take turns. Easy.  How about we just eat the cake? Hang on. Felix needs to be on the roof because he's about to get his medal! Then how about we just take that medal and give it to Ralph for once? Would that be the end of the world, Gene? Now you're just being ridiculous. Only good guys win medals, and you, sir, are no good guy. I could be a good guy if I wanted to, and I could win a medal! Uhhuh. And when you do, come and talk to us. Then would you finally let me be on top of the cake with you guys? If you won a medal, we'd let you live up here in the penthouse! But it will never happen because you're just the bad guy who wrecks the building. No, I'm not. Yes, you are! No, I'm not!   Yes, you are. All right, Gene. You know what? I'm going to win a medal. Oh, I am going to win a medal! The shiniest medal this place has ever seen! A medal that will be so good that it will make Felix's medals wet their pants! And good night! Thank you for the party. Is he serious? Oh, please! Where's a bad guy going to win a medal? Of course he's not serious. I've never been more serious about anything in my life. That's why I came straight here, Tapper. You've never given me a bum steer. Now, come on. Where can a guy like me go and win a medal? I don't think such a game exists, Ralph. Oh, come on. You know people. There's got to be... Tapper, I need a root beer. Coming! Hold that thought.  Okay. As you were saying. I was saying, I can't spend another 30 years living alone in the garbage. I'm not going back without a medal. Well, I don't know what to tell you. Maybe somebody left a medal here. You're welcome to dig through the lost and found. Okay, let's see what we got here. Oh! Shoo! Shoo! Go on, get out of here. Mushroom? No. What is this? No. Oh, come on, Zangief! Gross. Oh. What am I doing?  Hey, excuse you! We are humanity's last hope. Our mission? Destroy all CyBugs. We are humanity's last hope. Uh... You okay there, space cadet? We've only been plugged in a week and every day it's, ""Climb the building, then fight bugs. ""Climb the building, fight more bugs!"" Yeah, yeah. Right. Look. Easy on the overalls, spaceman. It's tough all over, all right? And all for what? A lousy medal? Medal? You win a medal? Yeah, Medal of Heroes. Ooh. Is it shiny? Pretty shiny. Ooh! And it says ""hero"" on it? Uhhuh. Oh, yeah. And you say you win it by climbing a building? And fighting bugs! Right, bugs. Is there any chance I could go with you to your game and maybe get one of those medals? Negatory. Does that mean maybe? No! Look, only the bravest and the best serve in our corps. Bug!   Huh.  We are humanity's last hope.  Attention! The arcade will open in five minutes.  Please report to your games.   I can't feel my legs. What is all this stuff?  Smells like Ralph in here. Okay. All right. What was it called again? Hero's something. Duty. Hero's Duty.  Oh, there it is. Oh!  Sorry, Q*bert. It's me, Ralph. Shh! The wall.   Morning, kids. Come on in. Good to see you. Good to see you. You, too, little fella. Quarter alert! Quarter alert!  This is not a drill.  Ooh! Sweet golden medal! On a planet with no name  a topsecret experiment has gone horribly wrong.  You are humanity's last hope.  Rootingtooting, ready for shooting!  All right. Now listen up, because I'm only going to say this once. Fear is a fourletter word, ladies. If you want to go peepee in your bigboy slacks, keep it to yourself. It's make your mamas proud time! I love my mama! Heads up! Firstperson shooter, coming through! Ooh, robot! Boop, boop, boop.  Game play in three, two, one.  We are humanity's last hope.  Our mission ?  Destroy all CyBugs. You ready, rookie? Let's find out. Sweet Mother Hubbard!  No, no, no! Wait a second! Aah! CyBug, twelve o'clock. Take it, newbie. No, no! Wait, wait! Watch it, rookie! These monsters become what they eat.  My gun! Give me that back. Shoot the eggs before they hatch! Oh, no! Something's coming out of their bottom! Oh, gross! Markowski!  Get back in formation!  All right, ladies,  the kitten whispers and tickle fights stop now.  The entrance to the lab is straight ahead. I'll meet you guys inside! No! Oh! Sanctuary! Sanctuary!   I thought this was going to be like Centipede!  When did video games become so violent and scary? Please, get me out of here!  Take her!   What a ripoff! Ah! Get off me! It's game over. Stop it! Beacon up! Ceasefire! Ceasefire! Attention! Return to start positions.  Return to start positions.   Here, let me help you. Sorry about that. Yeah, you must be upset. Markowski. Who? Whoa! Oh, yeah, me. I'm Markowski. Ah! What's the first rule of Hero's Duty?  No cuts, no butts, no coconuts? Never interfere with the firstperson shooter. Our job is to get the gamers to the top of that building so they can get a medal, and that's it! So stick to the program, soldier! Right. Right. Aye, aye. Quarter alert! Quarter alert!  All right, pussy willows. Back to start positions! Oh! Yeah, right. No way I'm going through that again. So that's where they keep the medal, huh? Hmm. ""New racers daily."" Sweet! I got next game. Go away, kid! We're going to play all nine of today's racers! Yeah! Sorry.  Hmm. Where's the wrecking guy? Where's Ralph? He should be wrecking the building. Shh! Stick with the program. Fix it, Felix!     Ralph! Quarter alert! Game on! Do something, Felix! Just act natural. I'll fix it.  Ralph! Ralph! What the... Ralph? Ralph! Oh, my land! Where is he? Mr. Litwak! What's the trouble, sweetheart? The game's busted. I can fix it! I can fix it!  Oh, boy. Looks like the game's gone cuckoo, like my nana. Sorry, sweetie. Here's your quarter back. But what about the game? I'll have someone look at it tomorrow... But if he can't fix it, it might be time to put old Ralph and Felix out to pasture. Like my nana.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're out of order. Sweet mercy! Without Ralph, we're doomed! They're going to pull our plug!  Okay, everybody, calm down. Ralph probably fell asleep in the washroom of Tapper's again.  See? There he is now. Why, it's Q*bert. What brings you here, neighbor?  What's he saying, Felix? Stand by. My Q*bertese is a little rusty.    Ralph's gone Turbo!   Ooh! Shiny. Attention! The arcade is now closed.  Did you get a load of Markowski?  Shut your chew holes. CyBug.  Taste it!  Slick Tiddlywinking, pintsize. I'm FixIt Felix, Jr., ma'am. From the game FixIt Felix, Jr.   Jiminey jaminey! Look at that high definition. Your face! It's amazing! Flattery don't charge these batteries, civilian. Now, state your business. I'm looking for my colleague, Wreckit Ralph? Never heard of him. Well, Q*bert saw him come in here. Impossible. Nothing gets past me.  That came from the tower.  Nice eggs. Nice eggs! Okay. That was easy. Congratulations, soldier.  It is my honor to bestow upon you  the Medal of Heroes.  Wow! No way! Tenhut!  Wow! History will long revere your courage and sacrifice.  Well, thank you! You have etched in the rock of virtue  a legacy beyond compare.  Thanks, guys. At ease! You are the universe's greatest hero.   Oops!  The living embodiment of all this corps represents.  Oh.  Bravery. Integrity. Grace under pressure.  And above all, dignity.  Escape pod activated.   Get off my face! Incoming!  Ralph! 'CYBug!  Aha! Oh, no!   Huh?   Sayonara, sucker!   Huh? ""Sugar Rush""?  Oh, no! This is that candy gocart game over by the WhacAMole. I got to get out of here. Oh, no! My medal!  No, no, no, no, my medal! Oh!  No, no, my medal!   Hi, mister.  Hello. Man, you scared me, kid. Ah, I nearly soiled myself. What's your name? Uh... Ralph. WreckIt Ralph. You're not from here, are you? No, well, yeah. I mean, not from right in this area. I'm just doing some work here. What kind of work? Some routine candy tree trimming. You probably want to stand back. In fact, this whole area is technically closed while we're trimming. Who's ""we""? Candy tree department. Oh! Where is everybody else? Ah, it's just me today. So you just meant like the royal ""we""? Yep. That's right. Hey, are you a hobo? No. I'm not a hobo, but I am busy. Okay? So you go home. What's that? Didn't hear you. Your breath is so bad it made my ears numb. Listen, I tried to be nice. I tried to be nice. You're mimicking me. You're mimicking me! kay kay That is rude, and this conversation is over. And this conversation is over. Uh, I wouldn't grab that branch if I were you. I'm from the candy tree department, so I know what... It's a double stripe.  Double stripes break. Guhdoy! Why are your hands so freakishly big? Uh, I don't know. Why are you so freakishly annoying? Why are you so freakishly... Sweet mother of monkey milk! A gold coin! Don't even think about it. That is mine. Race you for it! Hey! I don't have to race for it because it's mine! Double stripe! Come back here! The winner! Give it back! Give it! Whoa! Double stripe.  Thank you! Wait! Let me talk to you for one second. Okay. Here's the thing. I'm not from the candy tree department. Lying to a child. Shame on you, Ralph. But I wasn't lying about the medal. That is my medal! That's why I was climbing the tree. It's mine! It's precious to me. That thing is my ticket to a better life. Yeah, well, now it's my ticket. What the... See you, chump! Come back! I'll find you! I will find you! Double stripe!  Nowhere to hide! Yeah, he banged around in here like some kind of hot shot, then he went barreling down into that sweet little game like a crazy person. ""Sugar Rush. ""  CyBugs would chew up that game faster than a chicken hawk in a coop of crippled roosters. What was that, now? What are you, thick? There was a CyBug on that shuttle! Do you even know what a CyBug is? I can't say that I do, ma'am. CyBugs are like a virus. They don't know they're in a game. All they know is eat, kill, multiply. Without a beacon to stop them, they'll consume Sugar Rush.  But do you think they'll stop there? 'Yes! Viruses do not stop! Once those CyBugs finish off Sugar Rush,  they'll invade every other game until this arcade is nothing but a smoking husk of forgotten dreams. Kohut! My cruiser. Jeepers. Is she always this intense? It's not her fault. She's programmed with the most tragic backstory ever. The one day she didn't do a perimeter check... Her wedding day.    Wait, ma'am! I'm going with you. Like fun you are, short stack. If you die outside your game, you don't regenerate. Well, neither do you, ma'am. And it is my job to fix what Ralph wrecks. And I cannot ask you to risk your life cleaning up his mess. No flex on this one, ma'am. I am coming along with you.      Citizens of Sugar Rush...  Just in time. ...All hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.  Hello, my royal subjects!  Haha! Have some candy!   Thank you for that stirring introduction, Sour Bill.  Mmmhmm.  And thank you to today's avatars.  It was a wonderful day of racing. It was  But now the arcade is closed,  so it's time to wipe the slate clean  and race to decide our new roster.  The first nine racers across that finish line  will represent Sugar Rush as tomorrow's avatars!  Race! Race! Race! Okay, calm down.  Listen! This event is paytoplay. We all know this.  The fee to compete is one gold coin  from your previous winnings,  if you've ever won, which I have.  Let me go first!  King Candy!    Taffyta Muttonfudge!  Stay sweet! Adorabeezle Winterpop.  Gloyd Orangeboar!   Little stealer! Wait till I catch that brat. Minty Zaki. Snowanna Rainbeau.  Rancis Fluggerbutter. Jubileena BingBing.  Swizzle Malarkey.  Candlehead.   Sour Bill, who's that last one? Vanellope von Schweetz!  Yippee! I'm in the race! Vanellope?  The Glitch!  Now, now!  Everything is all right! Security!  Come here, kid! We're not going to hurt you, you little freak!  Get back here! Slow down! Slow down a little bit.  You! Give me back my medal right now! âAh, boy! Go! What is that?  Come On! Go! Roll!   Careful! What are you doing?  Huh?  Come back here! I can't move! Now we got him! Oh, good, the cops. She went that way! Hold still! Take that! Ow! What are you doing? Okay, folks.  Calm down! Everything's all right.  The monster's been caught!  We'll repair all the damage.  Don't worry. We will have our race before the arcade opens.  And I'm in it. Yes! There's no way that I am racing with a glitch. Rancis, Candlehead, come on. Sour Bill, that glitch cannot be allowed to race! And bring that thing to my castle. Guys! She took...   Oreoh Oreo!  Oreoh    Sour Bill, detaffify this monster so we can see what we're up against here. Mmkay.  Milk my duds! It's WreckIt Ralph? Yeah. Who are you, the guy that makes the donuts? Please. No. I'm King Candy! I see you're a fan of pink. Salmon. Salmon, that's obviously... What are you doing here? Look, Your Candiness, this is just a big misunderstanding. Just get me out of this cupcake, I'll get my medal, and I'll be out of your way. Your medal?  Bad guys don't win medals. Well, this one did. I earned it over in Hero's Duty.  You gamejumped? Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you? What? No, no. Because if you think you can come in here to my kingdom and take over my game, you've got another thing coming! Easy, Your Puffiness. It's not my fault one of your children of the candy corn stole my medal. ""Children of the candy corn""? Who'd... The Glitch! The coin she used to buy her way into the race. That was your medal? She did what? I need that back! Well, I'm afraid I can't help you. It's gone, you know. It's nothing but code now. It will stay that way until someone wins the cup at the end of the race. Maybe I'll have to have a little talk with the winner then. Is that a threat I smell? Beyond the halitosis you so obviously suffer from. Listen, NillyWafer, I'm not leaving without my medal! Yes, you are. Wynnchel, Duncan, get him out of that cupcake and on the first train back home. If I ever see you here again, WreckIt Ralph, I'll lock you in my dungeon. Dungeon? Fun dungeon, you know? It's a play on words. It's the... Never mind! I've got a glitch to deal with, thanks to you. Goodbye, Wreckit Ralph! It hasn't been a pleasure. This thing is hard as a rock. I can see that. Get the tools. What tools? Quiet, you! Ow! What? No! Take it easy, big boy! Stay away from me! He's getting away! Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.    Chocolate. I hate chocolate! I got to get my medal back. The pot goes to the winning racer! Hey, kids! Can I talk to you for a second?  Hello, fellow racers! It's that little crumb snatcher. Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis, you're looking well. Came by to check out the competition, huh? Well, here it is, the LicketySplit! Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself. I built it myself. Fastest pedalpower west of the WhacAMole. Check her out.  Oh, Vanellope, it's so... You.  But you have to back out of the race. Yeah. Oh, no, I don't, because I paid my fee and I'm on the board... So, yeah, I'm definitely racing. Yeah, well, King Candy says glitches can't race. I'm not a glitch, Taffyta. I've just got pixslexia, okay? The rules are there for a reason, Vanellope. To protect us. Say I'm you. I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving and I actually feel kind of cool for once. And then, all of a sudden, oh, no. I'm glitchingl 'See? You're an accident just waiting to happen. Oh, no! I glitched, 'Â£00! uncool Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it! Please! I just want to race like you guys. You will never be a racer because you're a glitch. And that's all you'll ever be! Hey! Leave her alone!   Let's get out of here! Scram, you rotten little cavities! Before I throw you in the mud! What are you looking at? You're welcome, you rotten little thief. I'm not a thief! I just borrowed your stupid coin. I was going to give it back to you as soon as I won the race. It's not a coin. It is a medal. Coin, medal, whatever. Just go back to your own dumb game and win another one. I can't. I didn't win it in my game. I won it in Hero's Duty.  Hero's Doodie?   It's not that kind of duty. I bet you really got to watch where you step in a game called Hero's Doodie!   What did you win the medal for, wiping? I hope you washed your hands after you handled that medal. Listen! One more, one more. Why did the hero flush the toilet? Say ""why."" Why? Because it was his doodie! How dare you insult Hero's Duty?  You little guttersnipe! I earned that medal and you better get it back for me tootsweet, sister! Well, unless you've got a gocart hidden in the fat folds of your neck, I can't help you!  What a moron. Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker You're never going to break... Huh.  Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby? Leave me alone. Look, you want that medal, right? And I want to race. So here's what I'm thinking. You help me get a new cart... A real cart... And I'll win the race and get you back your medal. You want me to help you? All you got to do is break something for me. Come on. What do you say, friend? We are not friends. Oh, come on, pal. You son of a gun. Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it. Ah. Come on, chumbo. Ralph, my man. My main man. Hey! My arm's getting tired. Do we have a deal or not? You better win. Well, I'll say this much, they don't call your friend ""Wreckit"" for nothing. There's the shuttle. Is he in there? Nope. Lucky for him. Otherwise I would have slapped his corpse. No CyBug, either. Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs. It came this way, but the sugar particles in the atmosphere are jamming my sensor. Can't get a read on it. So what is it with this WreckIt joker? Why did he go AWOL? I wish I knew, ma'am. He was acting all squirrelly last night... Going on about cake and medals... But I never thought he'd go Turbo. ""Go Turbo""? That's right, you guys just got plugged in. Well, back when the arcade first opened, Turbo Time was by far the most popular game.  And Turbo... Turbotastic!  He loved the attention. Turbotastic!  So, when RoadBlasters got plugged in  and stole Turbo's thunder...  New game. All right! Boy, was he jealous.  So jealous that he abandoned his game  and tried to take over the new one.  These are the greatest graphics I've ever seen! Turbotastic!  Hey. Is that... That looks like Turbo. What's Turbo doing in this game? Aw, come on! Mr. Litwak! Turbo ended up putting both games and himself  out of order, for good.  Yes, the selfish man is like a mangy dog chasing a cautionary tale. I know, right? That's why I have to get Ralph home or the same thing's gonna happen to my game.  Huh?   What is this? ""Nesquik Sand""? Quicksand? Oh, I'll hop out and grab you one of those vines. Huh!   I can't hop. I'm hopless. This is hopeless! We're going to drown here. Stop thrashing. Stop moving. You're making us sink faster. We're going to die! Get ahold of yourself!  The vines. They're Laffy Taffy. They're attracted to whatever makes them laugh. Here, hit me again.  That's not funny enough. Harder! Look, you're a nice guy. I can't... No, ma'am! The arcade is depending on us. Now do your duty. That's an ord... Oh!  It's working! Hit me again. Ooh, your eye. I can fix it. Now... Oh! San Frantastic! Again! Ow! You mean business! Ow! Yikes on bikes! Wow! We're... killing... them! Comedy gold!  All right, enough with the googoo eyes. We've got work to do. Let's go.  Ugh. We lost the CyBug. Come on. We'll get a better view from the air. You think you can fix that shuttle? Can do.  Shh! All right, do your thing, knuckles. Bust it open! What's this? You're a fullon criminal, aren't you? Hey, we shook on it.  Thank you, Jeeves. What is this place? Where are the carts? You gotta make one. What? No, no. Look, kid, bad idea. Trust me. I don't make things. I break things. Well, it looks like you're going to be stepping outside your comfort zone, then, Gladys. Ooh, this is a good one! Welcome to the bakery! Let's bake a kart!  What is this, another game? Yeah, well, it's a minigame. You have one minute to win it.  What? Come on, Ralph! Go! Mixing.  Put the ingredients in the bowl  and throw away the trash.  Hairbrush. No! Underpants. No, no! You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid. I'm trying! Let me up there. I'll do it. No. Yes. Gross. Milk. Yes, yes, yes. Oh! Batter up! Ah! Come on! No sleeping on the job! Baking! Pump up the heat  and hold the perfect temperature  Ralph, a little help here? I'm on it. Yeah, no problem. Give me this thing here. Okay, good. Little more. Yeah, that's it! Hold it, hold it, hold it.  Yes! Come on. Get up, Ralph! Fifteen seconds! Decorating! Wheels first. How many? Four, doy! Got it.  Now frosting. A buttload of frosting! No problem. Oh. Time's up! Congratulations.  You did it, and here's your cart!   Look, kid... I tried to warn you. I can't make things. I just break... I love it. You do? I love it. I love it! I love it! I love it! Look, it's got a real engine! And look at these wheels.  I love it! I finally have a real cart! Come on. A work of art like this must be signed. Cream puffs. Hmm?  This is Beard Papa. The Glitch is in the bakery! Get me King Candy! Oh, what? You have teeth? I don't think I've ever seen you smile before. I'm not smiling. I was... I'm gassy, okay?  Hold it right there, Glitch!  And WreckIt Ralph? Uhoh.  Start the cart! Start the cart! What are you waiting for? Come on. Let's go! I don't know how to drive a real cart. You don't what? Are you hurt, Sire? No, he just glazed me. Get them! Oh! Ah! Stop, in the name of the king! That's me!  Get off the road!  Head for Diet Cola Mountain! Drive into the wall! What? Right there, between the two sugarfree lollipops! Are you crazy? Just do it!  Oh! Where did they go? They should have just turned. Find that glitch! Destroy that cart! She can't be allowed to race! So let me get this straight. You don't know how to drive. Well, no, not technically. I just thought that... What did you think? ""Oh, I'll just magically win the race ""just because I really want to!"" Look, wise guy. I know I'm a racer. I can feel it in my code.  That's it! I'm never getting my medal back. What is the big whoop about that crummy medal anyway? The big whoop? Well, this may come as a shock to you, but in my game, I'm the bad guy and I live in the garbage. Cool. No. Not cool. Unhygienic and lonely and boring. And that crummy medal was going to change all that. I go home with that baby around my neck and I'll get a penthouse. Pies. Ice sculptures. Fireworks!  It's grownup stuff. You wouldn't understand. No, I get it! That's exactly what racing would do for me! Well, guess what? What? News flash! Neither one of us is getting what we want!  What was that?  Yeah! Check it out. Look! Oh! OW! Whoa! You got to watch out for the splash. That stuff is broiling hot. Yeah, I got that. Thank you. What is this dump? I think it's some sort of unfinished bonus level. Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh? I found that secret opening, and now I live here. See? Oh, look, look, look. Welcome to my home! I sleep in these candy wrappers. I bundle myself up like a little homeless lady. BY Yourself? With all this garbage around you? Well, yeah. I mean, everyone here says I'm just a mistake and that I wasn't even supposed to exist. What do you expect? Listen, kid... I know it's none of my business but why do you even stick around this game? You really don't know anything, do you? Glitches can't leave their games. It's one of the joys of being me. Hey, what are you doing? Come on! I know it's a dump, but it's all I got. If you're going to be a racer, you're going to have to learn how to drive. And you can't do that without a track. Whoa! All right, now. Let's hustle up. We've got some driving to do. I'm going to learn to drive! I'm going to learn to drive! Oh, wait. Do you know how to drive? Yeah! I mean, I haven't done it, but... Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay? You crashed it. Just get in. How hard can it be? Okay, uh... Start it up.  There we go. So there are some buttons on the floor. Pedals. Pedals. Right. Now, uh, that's the go pedal. That I believe is the stopper. And this... Wait. What is this? That doesn't do anything. Ooh, what does this joystick do? Okay, good. Let's try that again. I've been looking for a driver who's qualified  So if you think that you're the one  Cw! To step into my ride  I'm a finetuned supersonic speed machine  Cw! With a sunroof top and a gangster lean  Cw! So if you feel me let me know, know, know  Cw! So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go  Get you where you wanna go If you know what I mean  Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine  'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five  Now shift it. Baby you got the keys  That's good. Keep going! Shift it again! Now shut up and drive Drive, drive, drive   I told you, racing's in my code! So if you feel me let me know, know, know   I got that medal in the bag! Hey, Ralphie, watch this! Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean  Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine  Whoohoo! Cause I'm zero to 60 in three point five  Baby you got the keys  Look out! Whoa! Shut up and drive  Ah! Hot cola! Now shut up and drive  So how did I do? Um... Well, you almost blew up the whole mountain. Right, right. That's a good note. You got to get that glitch under control, kid. Okay, I will, I will And then you think I got a chance? Um... Tiny. Yes, I'm going to win! I'm going to win! I'm going to win! Top shelf. Top shelf.  Did you find her? Tell me you found her. You didn't?  Go. Leave me.  Up, up, down, down...  Start! Oh, the code. It's the sweet lifeblood of the game. Where are you? Let's see... Stadium, no. Jumbotron. Haha! There it is. The winner's cup. One of these things is not like the others... It's you! We're going to give you a nice new home. Success!  Sour Bill, I'm going out. You're in charge of the castle until I get back. Your face is still red. You might want to hit it again with your hammer. Oh, that's not blunt force trauma, ma'am. That's just the honey glow in my cheeks. Okay. Ma'am, I just got to tell you... You are one dynamite gal. Wow, you are one dynamite gal. One dynamite gal. Dynamite gal. Dynamite...  Get out. All I said is you're a dynamite gal. I said get out! Oh. Jiminey jaminey. Yes? Oh. I'm FixIt Felix Jr., sir, from the game FixIt Felix Jr. Have you seen my friend Ralph? WreckIt Ralph? Yes. Yes, that's him! We should have locked him up when we had the chance. Locked him up? I'm not making the same mistake with you.  Hurry, hurry! Let's go. Time's awastin'.  Come on, Ralph! This is it. This is really happening. I almost don't believe it. I mean, I have dreamt about it for so long, and now... And now... Now I think I'm going to puke, actually. I mean, I think I might puke. You know, like a ""vurp."" A what? Vomit and a burp together, and you can taste it, and it's just like rising up. Oh, this is so exciting! Yes, it is. It's exciting. Am I ready to be a real racer? Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me? Who doesn't love a brat with dirty hair? Come on. Those people are going to love you. You know why? Because you're a winner. I'm a winner. And you're adorable! I'm adorable! And everyone loves an adorable winner! Yeah! Okay, come on. Listen to me. If you get nervous, just keep telling yourself, ""I must win Ralph's medal or his life will be ruined."" And have fun. Got it? Got it. Whoa! Oh, Wait!  Hold on! Where are you going? I forgot something! I'll be right back!  Kids.  Ralph!  There you are. Hello! You! I come alone, unarmed. I've had enough of you, pillow pants! Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!  I'm going to beat the filling out of you! You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you? You hit a guy with glasses. That's... Well played.  What do you want, Candy? Listen, I just want to talk to you. I'm not interested in anything you have to say. How about this? Are you interested in this? My medal. How did you... It doesn't matter. It's yours! Go ahead, take it.  Whoa. All I ask is that you hear me out. About what? Ralph, do you know what the hardest part about being a king is? Doing what's right, no matter what. Get to the point. Point being, I need your help. Sad as it is, Vanellope cannot be allowed to race. Why are you people so against her? I'm not against her! I'm trying to protect her! If Vanellope wins that race she'll be added to the race roster.  Then gamers can choose her as their avatar.  And when they see her glitching  and twitching and just being herself,  they'll think our game is broken.  We'll be put out of order for good.  All my subjects will be homeless.   But there's one who cannot escape because she's a glitch.  Help! Somebody, help! Help! And when the game's plug is pulled...  No! ...She'll die With it. You don't know that will happen. The gamers could love her. And if they don't? I know it's tough, but heroes have to make the tough choices, don't they? She can't race, Ralph, but she won't listen to me. So can I count on you to talk a little sense into her? Very good. I'll give you two some time alone.  I'm back! Did you miss me? Yeah... Uh... Can we talk for a second? Wait. First, kneel down. What? No, we really... Will you just do it? Okay. Now, close your eyes. Vanellope... Shush! Close them!  Okay. Open them up. ""To Stinkbrain."" Gee, thanks. Turn it over. I made it for you. Just in case we don't win. Not that I think there's even a remote chance we're not going to win. Thanks, kid. Listen... Now rise, my royal chump. I've got a date with destiny. Ralph, come on. Move your molasses. Um... I've been thinking. That's dangerous. Who cares about this stupid race anyway? Right? That's not very funny, Ralph. No, I'm serious, and it was really fun to build the car and everything... But maybe you shouldn't do it. Hello? ls Ralph in there? I'd like to speak to him, please. Look, what I'm saying is you can't be a racer. What? Why would you... Wait a minute. No! Where did you get this? Look, I'm going to be straight with you, kid. I've been talking to King Candy. King Candy? Yeah. You sold me out? No, I didn't... Listen. You don't understand. No, I understand plenty. Traitor! I'm not a traitor. Listen. You're a rat! And I don't need you, and I can win the race on my own. But I'm trying to save your skin, kid! Put me down! Let me go! No, you listen to me. Do you know what's going to happen when the players see you glitching? They'll think the game's broken. I don't care! You're a liar! You better care, because if your game goes out of order, you go down with the ship, little sister! I'm not listening to you! Get out of my way! I'm going to that race! No, you're not!  Take me down from here, Ralph, right now! No. I'm doing this for your own good! Wait, wait, wait. No. No. No,no,no,no,no! Please, Ralph!  No! Stop it! Stop it! No!   You really are a bad guy.  Hello? Anybody home? Felix? Mary? Well, you actually went and did it. Gene. Where is everybody? They're gone. After Felix went to find you and then didn't come back... Everyone panicked and abandoned ship. But I'm here now. It's too late, Ralph. Litvvak's pulling our plug in the morning. Oh! But never let it be said that I'm not a man of my word. The place is yours, Ralph. Enjoy. Gene, wait! Wait! Listen, this is not what I wanted! Well, what did you want, Ralph? I don't know. I just...  I was just tired of living alone in the garbage. Well, now you can live alone in the penthouse.     Hey, cough drop. Explain something to me. If Vanellope was never meant to exist, then why is her picture on the side of the game console? Uh...  What's going on in this candycoated heart of darkness? Nothing. Talk! No. I'll lick you. You wouldn't. Oh, yeah? Oh! That's like sandpaper! Mmm. Wonder how many licks it will take to get to your center. I'll take it to my grave! Fair enough. Oh! They call you Sour Bill for a reason. Had enough yet? Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk! Vanellope was a racer until King Candy tried to delete her code! Tried to delete her code?  So that's why she's a glitch! Why is he doing this to her?  I don't know! Suit yourself. No, no, no! I swear I don't know! He literally locked up our memories  and I cannot remember!  Nobody can!  But I do know this. He'll do anything to keep her from racing. Because if she crosses the finish line, the game will reset and she won't be a glitch any more! Where is she now? In the fungeon with FixIt Felix. Felix? I'm sorry! That's all I know, I swear! Now, please, don't put me back in your filthy mouth again!  Stick around. Yes, okay, I will. I will. Thank you! Come on. I know you're out there.  Saccharinesaturated nightmare!  But... Where?   Doomsday and Armageddon just had a baby and it is ugly! Hello? Hello? Somebody! Anybody! Please let me out! What's he say?  I'm gonna wreck it!  Why do I fix everything I touch? Oh!  Bam! Felix! Ralph! I'm so glad to see you! Wait. No, I'm not. What do you have to say for yourself! Wait! I don't want to hear it. I'm not talking to you! Okay, don't talk. That's fine. But you have to fix this gocart for me pronto. I don't have to do boo! Forgive my potty mouth. I'm just so, so cross with you! Do you have any idea what you put me through? I ran higgledypiggledy all over creation looking for you. I almost drowned in chocolate milkmix! And then... I met the most dynamite gal. Oh! She gives me the honey glow something awful. But she rebuffed my affections. And then I got thrown in jail! Felix, pull yourself together. No! You don't know what it's like to be rejected and treated like a criminal! Yes, I do. That's every day of my life. It is? Which is why I ran off and tried to be a good guy, but I'm not! I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help. There's a little girl whose only hope is this cart. Please, Felix, fix it. And I promise I will never try to be good again.  Huh? I know, I know, I'm an idiot. And? And a real numskull. And? A selfish diaper baby. And? And... A stinkbrain? The stinkiest brain ever.     My sweet subjects,  I can without a pinch of hesitation assure you  that I have never been so happy in all my life  to say the following words,  let the Random Roster Race commence!     Okay, remember, you don't have to win. Just cross that finish line, and you'll be a real racer. I'm already a real racer. And I'm going to win.    Whoa!     Have some candy.  Behind you! In front of you! Huh? It's The Glitch! The Glitch? Light them up, Candlehead.  What's this? Cherry bombs!   I told you. You're just an accident waiting to happen.     My candle! All right. Gotta keep it under control. No more glitching. Okay, kid. Let's finish this thing without any more surprises. Cw! Hope you're happy, junkpile. This game is going down, and it's all your fault. My lady, you came back. Can it, FixIt! That CyBug you brought with you multiplied. No. It died in the taffy swamp. Believe me, I...  Bullroar.  Listen up, people. Head to Game Central Station now! Move it! Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go! Go! No!  Huh? Get off of my track! Hey! What, are you crazy! I forbid you to cross that finish line! Knock it off! Ralph, look! Kid! Stop it! I'm not letting you undo all my hard work!  Is that... No way! What the... Who are you? I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever! And I did not reprogram this world to let you and that halitosisriddled Warthog take it away from me!  Turbotastic.  End of the line, Glitch! Glitch. That's it. Come on, Vanellope. I know you said you wouldn't do it again but you're going to do it one more time. Just focus and concentrate and glitch!   Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did it! No!  Bring it home, kid! The finish line is wide open!  No! Kid! Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's finish this race! Oh, my land. All right. Come on. We gotta get out of here. But I didn't cross the finish line! There is no finish line! Move it or lose it, people. Everybody, out. Now! Ralph, it's not going to work! We got to try! Kid! Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game. Come on. Get through. Ralph! Stop! It's got to work! Stop, it's no use.  It's okay, Ralph. All right, FiXIt. That's everyone. Now, we've got to blow up this exit. Just go. Go without me. But what about this game? Nothing we can do about it. Without a beacon, there's no way to stop these monsters. Beacon? Stay with Felix. Let me borrow that thing, lady. Ralph! Where are you going? I got some wrecking to do! I'll meet you at the finish line! No! Wait! FixIt, get behind me!    Come on! One more! One... Oh! Welcome to the boss level! Turbo.  Because of you, Ralph, I'm now the most powerful virus in the arcade! I can take over any game I want. I should thank you but it would be more fun to kill you. Get back here, little guy! Have some candy! Where do you think you're going? I'm not through with you yet. Up we go! No! Ralph! Fall back.  Kid! Vanellope! Oh, look at that. It's your little friend. Let's watch her die together, shall we? No!  It's game over for both of you. No. Just for me! Ralph! Vanellope! I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be... ...than me.  Kid! Don't worry. I got it under control. You fools! Why are you going into the ligh...  No! No, no, no. Yes... No! Yes... No! Go into the light! Whoa! Chocolate?  It's chocolate! I love chocolate!  Oh, beautiful chocolate! Yeah! You did it, Ralph! Way to go, brother!   I... Excuse... All fixed. You ready for this? As ready as I'll ever be. Whoa! What's with all the magic sparkles?  Princess Vanellope? Now I remember. All hail the rightful ruler of Sugar Rush... Princess Vanellope.  I remember. She's our princess! Oh, that's right! We are so sorry about the way we treated you. Yeah, those were jokes! I was just doing what Taffyta told me to do! Tuttut. As your merciful princess, I hereby decree that everyone who was ever mean to me shall be executed. What? No, please! Oh, my land. Oh! This place just got interesting. I don't want to die! I'm just kidding. Stop crying, Taffyta. I'm trying, but it won't stop. Wow. So this is the real you. Princess. Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts? Come on. This isn't me. This is me. Huh? Look, the code may say I'm a princess but I know who I really am, Ralph, I'm a racer with the greatest superpower ever. I was here, I was there. I was glitching through the walls. I'm not giving that up. Um, pardon me for asking, but without a princess, who's going to lead us? Yeah. Who? Uh, me. I'm thinking more along the lines of a constitutional democracy. President Vanellope von Schweetz. Has a nice ring to it, don't you think? FixIt, WreckIt, the arcade's about to open. Let's move 'em out. You could just stay here and live in the castle. You'd have your own wing where no one would ever complain about your stench or treat you bad ever again. You could be happy. I'm already h8DPY I've got the coolest friend in the world. And besides, I've got a job to do, too. It may not be as fancy as being president but it's my duty. And it's a big duty!  Ralph, are you coming, brother? See you later, President Fart Feathers. Au revoir, Admiral Underpants. And farewell, Baroness Boogerface. Goodbye, Major Body Odor! Hasta la vista, you... Ralph! All right. To be continued. Yeah! Hooray! I'm gonna wreck it!   Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!  The gang's all here! So, I'm happy to report, and you'll be happy to hear, I'm taking life one game at a time. All right! Yeah, Ralph! Of course, the job hasn't changed.  But, news flash, the Nicelanders are being nice to me!  And that got me thinking about those poor guys left without a game.  So here's what we did. We're gonna wreck it!  We asked them to help us out on the bonus levels.  We can fix it!  I'm telling you, guys,  we haven't been this popular in years.  It's crazy.  Wow! The gamers say we 're ""retro, ""  which I think means ""old but cool. ""  How come we never noticed this game? Oh, and I decided that living in the dump  wasn't making me feel very good,  so I cleaned it up, built myself a little shack  and a couple for the new guys, too.   Well, with a little help from Felix. Oh!  And guess who was the best man at his and Calhoun's wedding.  That's right, my friends, old Ham Hands himself.  Very elegant affair. You should've seen it.  Lot of grandeur.  And not a single bug.  Let's just say, some tears were shed.  But I got to say, the best part of my day  is when I get thrown off the roof.  Because when the Nicelanders lift me up,  I get a perfect view of Sugar Rush And I can see Vanellope racing.  Yes!  The kid's a natural.  And the players love her, glitch and all.  Just like I knew they would.  Turns out I don't need a medal to tell me I'm a good guy.  'Cause if that little kid likes me... How bad can I be?

Zootopia,Disney,2010,2016,Animation,"Fear, treachery, blood lust. Thousands of years ago these were the... forces that ruled our world A world where prey were scared of predators. And predators had an uncontrollable... biological urge to maim, and maul, and... Awww! Blood! Blood! Blood! And.. death! Ahhh... Back then, the world was divided in two. Vicious predator, or meek prey. But over time, we evolved, and moved beyond or primitive savage ways. Now predator and prey live in harmony. And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities. Yeah, I don't have to cower in a a herd anymore. Instead, I can be an astronaut. I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore. Today I can hunt for tax exemptions. I'm gonna be an actuary. And I can make the world a better place. I am going to be... A police officer! Bunny cop? That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard! It may seem impossible to small minds. I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey. But, just 211 miles away, stands the great city of Zootopia. Where our ancestors first joined together in peace. And declared that anyone can be anything! Thank you and good night. Judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy? Nope Well, we gave up on our dreams, and we settled. Right, Bon? Oh, yes. That's right, Stu. We settled hard. You see, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude. If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail. I like trying, actually. What your father means, hon, is that it's gonna be difficult, impossible even... for you to become a police officer. Right. There's never been a bunny cop. No. Bunnies don't do that. Never. Never. Well... Then I guess I'll have to be the first one. Because I am gonna make the world a better place! Or, heck, you know. You wanna talk about making the world a better place, no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer. Yes! Your dad, me, your 275 brothers and sisters. We're changing the world. Yeah. One carrot at a time. Amen to that. Carrot farming is a noble profession. You get it, honey? I mean, it's great to have dreams. Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in them too much. Where the heck'd she go? Give me your tickets right now, or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt. Ow! Cut it out, Gideon! Baah, baah! What are you gonna do, cry? Hey! You heard her. Cut it out. Nice costume, loser. What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop? Kindly return my friend's tickets. Come and get them. But watch out. Cause I'm a fox, and like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey. And that killer instinct's still in our denna. Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA. Don't tell me what I know, Travis. You don't scare me, Gideon. Scared now? Look at her nose twitch, she is scared. Cry, little baby bunny! Cry... Ow... Oh, you don't know when to quit, do you? Huh! I want you to remember this moment the next time you think you will ever be... anything more than just a stupid carrotfarming dumb bunny. That looks bad. Are you okay, Judy? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Here you go. Wow, you got our tickets! You're awesome, Judy. Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about! Well, he was right about one thing. I don't know when to quit. ZOOTOPIA POLICE ACADEMY  Listen up, cadets. Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits. Tundratown, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few. You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets. Or guess what? You'll be dead! Scorching sandstorm. You're dead, bunny bumpkin. One thousand foot fall. You're dead, carrot face. Frigid ice wall. You're dead, farm girl. Enormous criminal. You're dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Ohhh...! Filthy toilet. You're dead, fluff butt. Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny. There's never been a bunny cop. Never. Just a stupid carrotfarming dumb bunny. As mayor of Zootopia, I am proud to announce that my mammal inclusion... initiative, has produced its first police academy graduate. Valedictorian of her class, ZPD's very first rabbit officer... Judy Hopps. Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge. Oh, yes, yes! Thank you. Judy, it is my great privilege to officially assign you to the heart of Zootopia... Precinct One. City Center. Yeh! Yeh! Congratulations Officer Hopps. I won't let you down. This has been my dream since I was a kid. You know, it's a real proud day for us little guys. Bellwether, make room, will you? Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see those teeth! Officer Hopps, look here. We're real proud of you, Judy. Yeah, and scared too. Yes. Really, it's kind of a proudscared combo. I mean, Zootopia. So far away, such a big city. Guys, I've been working for this my whole life. We know. And we're just a little exited for you, but terrified. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And also bears. We have bears to fear, too. Say nothing on lions, and wolves. Wolves? Weasels. You played cribbage with a weasel once? Yeah, he cheats like there's no tomorrow. You know what? Pretty much all predators. And Zootopia is full of them. Oh, Stu. And foxes are the worst. Yeah, actually, your father does have a point there. It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey? When I was nine. Gideon Grey was a jerk who happens to be a fox. I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks. Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely. But just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you. I put some snacks in there. This is fox deterrent. Yeah, it's safe to have that. This is fox repellant. The deterrent and the repellant, that's all she needs. Check this out! Oh, for goodness sake! She has no need for a fox taser, Stu. Oh, come on. When is there not a need for a fox taser? Well, okay, look, I will take this... To make you stop talking. Terrific! Everyone wins! Arriving, Zootopia Express. Okay, gotta go. Bye! Mmm. I love you, guys. Love you, too. Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks. Oh, Stu. Pull it together. Bye everybody! Bye Judy, I love you! Bye! Bye! YOU ARE NOW LEAVING BUNNYBURROW.  Oh oh oh oh ooh   Oh oh oh oh ooh   Oh oh oh oh ooh   Oh oh oh oh ooh   I messed up tonight I lost another fight   I still mess up but I'll just start again   I keep falling down I keep on hitting the ground   I always get up now to see what's next   Birds don't just fly They fall down and get up   Nobody learns without getting it wrong   I won't give up, no I won't give in   Till I reach the end And then I'll start again   No I won't leave I wanna try everything   I wanna try even though I could fail   I won't give up, no I won't give in   Till I reach the end And then I'll start again   No I won't leave I wanna try everything   I wanna try even though I could fail   Oh oh oh oh ooh Try everything   Oh oh oh oh ooh Try everything   Oh oh oh oh ooh Try everything   Oh oh oh oh ooh   I'll keep on making those new mistakes   I'll keep on making them every day   Those new mistakes   Oh oh oh oh ooh Try everything   Oh oh oh oh ooh Try everything   Oh oh oh oh ooh Try everything   Oh oh oh oh ooh   Try everything  I'm Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia. And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms. Luxury apartments with charm. Complementary delousing once a month. Don't lose your key! Thank you. Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor! Yeah? Well, we're loud. Don't expect us to apologize for it. Greasy walls. Rickety bed. Crazy neighbors. I love it! Come on! He bared his teeth first! Excuse me! Hmm? Down here! Hi. O... M... Goodness! They really did hire a bunny. Howhop! I gotta tell you, you're even cuter than I thought you'd be. Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny ""cute"", but when other animals do it, that's a little... Ohhh. I am so sorry! Me, Benjamin Clawhauser. The guy everyone thinks is just a flabby donutloving cop, stereotyping you. Oh. No, it's okay. Oh. You've actually got... there's a... A what? In your neck. The fold. The... this... Oh, there you went, you little dickens! Hehehe, I should get to roll call, so which way do I... Oh, ball pen's over there to the left. Great. Thank you! Oh... That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive. Hey! Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place? Attention! All right. All right. Everybody sit. I've got three items on the docket. First, we need to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Francine. Happy birthday. Oh. Number two. There are some new recruits with us I should introduce, but I'm not going to because... I don't care. Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases. All predators. From a giant polar bear to a teensy little otter. And City Hall is right up my tail to find them. This is priority number one. Assignments. Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato. Your team take missing mammals from the Rainforest District. Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard. Your teams take Sahara Square. Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby. Tundratown. And finally, our first bunny, Officer Hopps. Parking duty. Dismissed. Parking duty? Chief? Chief Bogo? Sir. You said there were fourteen missing mammal cases. So? So I can handle one. You probably forgot but, I was top of my class at the academy. Didn't forget. Just don't care. Sir, I'm not just some token bunny. Well then, writing a hundred tickets a day should be easy. A 100 tickets. I'm not gonna write 100 tickets. I'm gonna write 200 tickets. Before noon. FREQUENT STOPS    Ah! Boom! Two hundred tickets before noon! Hey, watch where you're going, fox! Huh! Hmm. Where'd he go? Listen. I know what you're doing skulking around during daylight hours, but I don't want any trouble in here. So hit the road! I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir... I simply wanna buy a JumboPop. For my little boy. You want the red, or the blue, pal? Oh. I'm such a... Oh, come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy. What? There aren't any fox ice cream joints in your part of town? No, no. There are, there are. It's just, my boy, this goofy little stinker, he loves all things elephant. He wants to be one when he grows up. Isn't that adorable? Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh? Right? Look, you probably can't read, fox, but the sign says We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone! So beat it. You're holding up the line. Hello. Excuse me. Hey, you're gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else, meter maid. Actually, I'm an officer. Just have a quick question. Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucus with their cookies and cream? What are you talking about? Well. I don't wanna cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream with an ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation. Which is kind of a big deal. Of course I could let you off with a warning if you were to glove those trunks and... I don't know... finish selling this... nice dad and his son a... What was it? A JumboPop. Please. A JumboPop. Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh no, are you kidding me... I don't have my wallet! I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck. That's the truth. Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal. Gotta be about the worst birthday ever. Please don't be mad at me. Thanks anyway. Keep the change. Officer, I can't thank you enough. So kind. Really. Can I pay you back? Oh, no. My treat. It's just, you know it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes towards foxes. I just want to say you're a great dad and just a real articulate fella. Oh. Well, that is high praise. It's rare that I find someone so nonpatronizing. Officer? Hopps. Mr..? Wilde. Nick Wilde. And you, little guy. You wanna be an elephant when you grow up? You be an elephant. Because this is Zootopia. Anyone can be anything. Ahh. I tell him that all the time. All right, here you go. Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile! All right, give her a little byebye toottoot. Toottoot. Bye, now! Goodbye! Oh. Hey, little toottoot... ""ORGANIC"" $2  PAWPSICLE  ""ORGANIC "" *$2  LEMMING BROTHERS BANK  Get your Pawpsicles. Oh! Lumber delivery. What's with the color? The color? Uh... it's redwood. 39, 40, there you go. Way to work that diaper, big guy. Hey. No kiss byebye for daddy? You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off! Ciao. Well, I stood up for you, and you lied to me. You liar! It's called a hustle, Sweetheart. And I'm not the liar. He is. Hey! All right, SlickNick. You're under arrest. Really? For what? Gee, I don't know. How about selling food without a permit? Transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines? False advertizing. Permit. Receipt of declared commerce. And I didn't falsely advertize anything. Take care. You told that mouse the Pawpsicle sticks were redwood! That's right. Red wood. With a space in the middle. Wood that is red. You can't touch me, Carrots. I've been doing this since I was born. You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots. My bad. I just naturally assumed you came... from some little carrotchoked Podunk. No? Uh, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke county and I grew up in Bunnyburrow. Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar. Naive little hick with good grades and big ideas decides ""Hey, look at me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia... Where predators and prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"" Only to find, whoopsie, we don't all get along. And that dream of becoming a big city cop, double whoopsie, she's a meter maid. And whoopsie number threesie, no one cares about her or her dreams. And soon enough those dreams die, and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor living in a box under a bridge. Till finally she has no choice but to go back home with that cute fuzzy wuzzy little tail between her legs to become... You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said? So how about a carrot farmer? That sound about right? Oh! Be careful now, or it won't just be your dreams getting crushed. Hey, hey. No one tells me what I can or can't be. Especially not some... jerk who never had the guts to try to be anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler. All right, look. Everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they can be anything they want. Well, you can't. You can only be what you are. Sly fox. Dumb bunny. I'm not a dumb bunny. Right. And that's not wet cement. You'll never be a real cop. You're a cute meter maid, though. Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there.  Everybody hurts...    ..by myself...    You can't do nothing right, baby...    I'm a loser...   CARROTS for ONE Mom & Dad Oh, hey, it's my parents! Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart! Hey there, Jude the Dude. How was your first day on the force? It was real great! Yeah? Everything you ever hoped? Absolutely. And more. Everyone's so nice, and I feel like... I'm really making a difference. Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bonnie. Look at that! Oh, my sweet heaven! Judy, are you a meter maid? Oh, this.. No! Oh, no. This is just a temporary thing.. It's the safest job on the force! She's not a real cop! Our prayers have been answered! Glorious day! Hoho, meter maid, meter maid, meter maid! Dad! Dad! Meter maid! You know what, it's been a really long day, I should... You get some rest. Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves. Byebye. Byebye. Hey, bunny! Turn down that depressing music! Leave the meter maid alone, didn't you hear her conversation? She feels like a failure! Oh, shut up! You shut up! You shut up! You shut up! Tomorrow is another day. Yeah, but it might be worse! I was 30 seconds over! Yeah, you're a real hero, lady. My mommy says she wishes you were dead. Uncool rabbit, my tax dollars pay your salary. I am a real cop. I am a real cop. Hey, you! Bunny! Sir, if you have a grievance you may contest recitation in traffic court. What are you talking about?! My shop! It was just robbed! Look, he's getting away! Well, are you a cop or not? Oh! Yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I got this! Stop in the name of the law! Catch me if ya' can, cottontail! Coming through! This is officer McHorn. We got a 1031. I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit! Woohoo! LITTLE RODENTIA  Ah! Ahh! Ha ha ha. You! Hey! Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops! Stop! Ahhhh! Oh. Sorry! Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon. Yahhh! Bon voyage, flatfoot! Huh! Hey! Stop right there! Have a donut, coppa! Oh my god, did you see those leopard print jeggings? Ah! Ah! Oh! I love your hair. Thank you. Heheheheh. Come to papa! Okay. You're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton. Okay? I popped the weasel! Hopps! Abandoning your post. Inciting a scurry. Reckless endangerment of rodents... But, to be fair, you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen moldy onions. Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions. Those are a crocus variety called midnicampum holicithias.  They're a class C botanical, sir. Well, I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing... Shut your tiny mouth now! Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my job. Your job is putting tickets on parked cars! Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again. Not now. Okay, I just need to know if you want to... take it this time she seems really upset... Not now! Sir. I don't wanna be a meter maid, I wanna be a real cop. Do you think the mayor asked what I wanted... when he assigned you to me? But, sir... Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song, and your insipid dreams... magically come true! So let it go. Chief Bogo, please! Five minutes of your time, please. I'm sorry sir. I tried to stop her, she's super slippery. I gotta go sit down. Ma'am, as I've told you, we're doing everything we can. My husband has been missing for ten days. His name is Emmitt Otterton. Yes. I know. He's a florist. We have 2 beautiful children. He would never just disappear. Ma'am, our detectives are very busy. Please. There's gotta be somebody to find my Emmitt. Mrs. Otterton. I will find him. Oh. Thank you! Bless you, bless you, little bunny! Take this. Find my Emmitt. Bring him home to me and my babies. Please. Mrs. Otterton. Please wait out here. Of course. Oh, thank you both so much! One second. You're fired. What? Why? Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open this door, and you're goind to tell that Otter you're a former meter maid with delusion of grandeur, who will not be taking the case. I just heard Officer Hopps is taking the case! Assistant Mayor Bellwether! The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is really starting to pay off. Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed! No, let's not tell the mayor just yet. And I sent it, and it is done, so I did do that. All right, well, I'd say the case is in good hands. Us little guys really need to stick together, right? Like glue. Good one. Just call me if you ever need anything. Okay? You've always got a friend at City Hall, Judy. All right! Byebye! Thank you, ma'am! I will give you 48 hours. Yes! That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton. But.. You strike out, you resign. Okay. Deal. Splendid. Clawhauser will give you the complete case file. Here you go. One missing otter. That's it? Yikes! That is the smallest case file I've ever seen. Leads, none. Witnesses, none. And you're not in the computer system yet, so... Resources, none! Ha ha! Hoo, I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one. Okay. Last known sighting. Can I just borrow? Thank you. Pawpsicle? The murder weapon! ""Get your Pawpsicle""... Yeah! Cause that... What does that mean? It means I have a lead. Hi! Hello! It's me again! Hey! It's officer toottoot. Hoo...No. Actually it's Officer Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case. What happened, meter maid? Did someone steal a traffic cone? It wasn't me. Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby. I gotta get to work. This is important, sir. I think your ten dollars worth of Pawpsicles can wait. Ha! I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a year, since I was 12. And time is money. Hop along. Please just look at the picture. You sold Mr. Otterton that Pawpsicle, right? Do you know him? I know everybody. And I also know that somewhere there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal, so why don't you get back to your box? Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way. Did you just boot my stroller? Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest. Ha. For what? Hurting your feelings? Felony tax evasion. Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year, since you were 12... that's two decades, so times twenty, which is 1,460,000, I think. I mean, I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying. Anyway, according to your tax forms, you reported, let me see here, zero! Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense. 5 years jail time. Well, it's my word against yours. 200 bucks a day, fluff, 365 days a year, since I was twelve.  Actually it's your word against yours. And if you want this pen you're going to help me find this poor missing otter, or the only place you'll be selling Pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria. It's called a hustle, sweet heart. She hustled you. Ehahaha... She hustled you good! You're a cop now, Nick. You're gonna need one of these. Have fun working with the fuzz! Start talking. I don't know where he is, I only saw where he went. Great, let's go! It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny. Don't call me cute, get in the car. Okay. You're the boss. Hi. I'm... Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello! My name is... You know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there. Cause we're all good on bunny scout cookies. Uh, no. I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD. I'm looking for a missing mammal... Emmitt Otterton. Right here. He may have frequented this establishment? Yeah, old Emmitt! Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks. But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor. I'd be happy to take you back. Oh, thank you so much, I'd appericiate that more than you can imagine, it'd be such... Oh! You are naked.. Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club! Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything. These guys, they be naked. Nangi's just on the other side of the pleasure pool. Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable? Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits. Yes, there is. Boy, that's the spirit. Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird. But you know what I say is weird? Clothes on animals! Here we go! As you can see, Nangi is an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything. Hey, Nangi. These dudes have some questions about Emmitt the otter. Who? Eh. Emmitt Otterton. Been coming to your yoga class for like six years. I have no memory of this beaver. He's an otter, actually. He was here a couple of Wednesdays ago. Remember? No. Yeah, he was wearing a green cable knit sweater vest, and a new pair of Quarterway slacks. Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot. Real tight. Remember that, Nangi? No. Yeah, and we both walked him out, and he got into this big old white car with a silver trim. Needed a tune up. The third cylinder wasn't firing. Remember that, Nangi? No. Eh. You didn't happen to catch the licence plate number? Did you? Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03. 03. Wow, this is a lot of great info. Thank you. Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap. I wish I had a memory like an elephant. Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue. And seeing as any moron can run a plate, I will take that pen and bid you adieu. The plate. I can't run a plate. Oomf. I'm not in the system yet. Give me the pen, please. What was it you said? Any moron can run a plate? Gosh, if only there were a moron around who were up to the task. Rabbit, I did what you asked. You can't keep me on the hook forever. Not forever. Well, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case. So can you run the plate or not? Actually, I just remembered, I have a pal at the DMV. Flash is the fastest guy in there. You need something done, he's on it. I hope so. We are really fighting the clock and every minute counts. Wait. They're all sloths? You said this was going to be quick! What, are you saying just because he's a sloth he can't be fast? I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything. Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash! Buddy, it's nice to see you. Nice to... see you... too. Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend. Ah...Darlin, I've forgotten your name. Hmm. Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD. How are you? I am... doing... just.. Fine? as well.. as.. I can.. be... What... Hang in there. can I... do... Well, I was hoping you could run a plate... for you... Well, I was hoping you could... ...today? Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us. We are in a really big hurry. Sure... What's the... plate... 29T... Number? 29THD03. THD03. T... HD03. H... D03. D... Mmhm. 03. Hey, Flash. Wanna hear a joke? No! Sure. Mmm! What do you call a threehumped camel? I don't know. What do you call... Threehumped camel. a threehumped... camel? Pregnant. Ha ha ha ha... Ha ha. Yes, very funny, very funny! Can we please just focus on the task? Hey... Wait, wait! Priscilla! Oh, no! Yes... Flash? What... do.. No... you call... A threehumped camel? Pregnant! Okay! We got it! Please just... three... humped... Here... you... Yes! Yeah, yeah! Hurry, thank you! 29THD03. ...go. It's registered to Tundratown Limo Service. A limo took Otterton! And the limo's in Tundratown! It's in Tundratown! Way to hustle, bud. I love you. I owe you. Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and... It's night?! Closed. Great. Mm. And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm? Darn it. It's a bummer. You wasted the day on purpose. Ma'am, I have a fake badge. I would never impede your pretend investigation. It's not a pretend investigation! Look, see? See him? This otter is missing. Well, then they should have gotten a real cop to find him. What is your problem? Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life? It does, 100%. Now, since you're sans warrant. I guess we're done? Fine. We are done. Here's your pen. First off, you throw like a bunny. Second, you're a very sore loser. See you later, Officer Fluff. So sad this is over. I wish I could have helped more. The thing is, you don't need... a warrant if you have probable cause, and I'm pretty sure I saw a... shifty lowlife climbing the fence. So you're helping plenty! Come on! 29THD03! This is it! Polar bear fur. Oh my God! What? What? The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole! But on CD. Who still uses CDs? Carrots, if your otter was here, he had a very bad day. Those are claw marks. You ever seen anything like this? No. Oh, wait. Look! This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He was definitely here. What do you think happened? Oh no, wait a minute. Polar bear fur... Ratpack music. Fancy cup. I know whose car this is, we gotta go! What? Whose car is it? The most feared crime boss in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big, and he does not like me. So we gotta go! I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene. Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene... if Mr. Big finds me here, so we're leaving right now. Raymond! And is that Kevin? Long time, no see. And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me? Huh? For old times sake? That's a no.. What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you? I, uh... I may have sold him a very expensive wall rug that was made from the fur of a skunk's butt. Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers. Is that Mr. Big? No. What about him? Is that him? No. That's gotta be him. Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking! Huh. Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder... Hmmph. Yeah. This is a simple misunderstanding. You come here unannounced on the day my daughter is to be married. Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so... Point is, I did not know that it was your car, and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding! I trusted you, Nicky. I welcomed you into my home. We broke bread together. Grandmama made you a cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug made from the butt of a skunk. A skunkbutt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my grandmama, who I buried in that skunkbutt rug. I told you never to show your face here again, but here you are. Snooping around with this... What are you? A performer? What's with the costume? Sir, I am a co... Mime! She's a mime. This mime can not speak. You can't speak if you're a mime. No, I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case. And my evidence puts him in your car! So intimidate me all you want, I'm going to find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do. Hmm. Then I have only one request. Say hello to Grandmama. Ice 'em! No, no, no. I didn't see nothing! I'm not saying nothing! And you never will. Please! No, no, no, no! If you're mad at me about the rug, I've got more rugs! Daddy! It's time for our dance! Ah! What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding! I have to, baby, daddy has to. Ice 'em. No, no, no! Wait, wait! She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday! From that giant donut! This bunny? Yeah. Hi! Hi. I love your dress. Oh. Thank you. Put them down. You've done me a great service. I will help you find the otter. I will take your kindness, and pay it forward. Hmm. Otterton is my florist. He's like a part of the family. He had something important he wanted to discuss. That's why I sent that car to pick him up. But he never arrived. Because he was attacked. No, he attacked. Otterton? Otterton. He went crazy. Ripped up the car. Scared my driver half to death. And disappeared into the night. But he's a sweet little otter. My child, we may be evolved, but deep down we are still animals. You wanna find Otterton, talk to the driver of the car. His name is Manchas. Lives in the Rainforest District. Only he can tell you more. Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We just wanna know what happened to Emmitt Otterton. You should be asking what happened to me. Whoa. A teensy otter did that? What happened? He was an animal. Down on all fours. He was a savage! There was no warning. He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers. Over and over, the Night Howlers! So you know about the Night Howlers too? Good, good. Because the Night Howlers are exactly what we are here to talk about. Right? Yes, so you just open the door and tell us what you know, and we will tell you what we know. Okay? Okay. Clever fox. Mr. Manchas? Are you okay? Run. Run! What is wrong with him?! I don't know! Jump! Come on! Head down! Officer Hopps to dispatch! Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns. Okay, hold on. Keep watching. Who's that beside her? Who is it? Wow, you are one hot dancer, Benjamin Clawhauser. It's me! Did you think it was real? It looks so real! It's not, it's just a new app. Hold on a second. Clawhauser! Clawhauser, listen to me. We have a 1091! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and Tujunga! It's Tuhunga! Okay, we're sending backup! Look, over there! Head for the skytrans! Get in. Carrots? Carrots! Go! Buddy, one predator to another. Now I can tell you're a little tense, so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space! Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go! I'm gonna let go! You're gonna to what? One, two... Carrots, you saved my life. Well, that's what we do at the ZPD... Well, this should be good. I thought this was just a missing mammal case, but it's way bigger. Mr. Otterton did not just disappear. I believe he and this jaguar, they... They went savage, sir. Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps. Animals don't go savage. I thought so too. Till I saw this. What? He was right here! The savage jaguar? Sir, I know what I saw. He almost killed us! Or maybe any agressive predator looks savage to rabbits? Let's go! Wait! Sir! I'm not the only one who saw him. You think I'm gonna believe a fox? Well, he was a key witness, and I... Two days to find the otter, or you quit. That was the deal. Badge. But, sir, we had... Badge! Uh, no. What did you say, fox? Sorry, what I said was ""no..."". She will not be giving you that badge. Look, you gave her a clown vest, and a threewheeled jokemobile, and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah, it's no wonder she needed to get help from a fox. None of you guys were gonna help her, were you? Here's the thing, chief. You gave her the 48 hours, so technically we still have... ten left to find our Mr. Otterton. And that's exactly what we're gonna do. So if you'll excuse us, we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack. Good day. Officer Hopps. Thank you. Never let them see that they get to you. So... Things do get to you? I mean not, not anymore. But I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once. Har har. No, it's true. I think I was 8, or maybe 9... And all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts. So my mom scaped together enough money to buy me a brand new uniform. Because, by god, I was gonna fit in. Even if I was the only predator in the troop, the only fox. I was gonna be part of a pack. Ready for initiation? Yeah. Pretty much born ready. I was so proud. Okay. Now raise your right paw, and deliver the oath. I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave, loyal, helpful and trustworthy. Even though you're a fox? What? No, no! What did I do wrong, you guys? No, please! What did I do wrong? What did I do? If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle? You're even dumber than you look. Is he gonna cry? I learned two things that day.  I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me. And two? If the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy... There's no point in trying to be anything else. Nick, you are so much more than that. Boy, look at that traffic down there. How about we go up to Chuck in traffic central? Chuck, how are things looking on the jam cams? Nick, I'm glad you told me. The jam cams... Seriously, it's okay. No, no no! There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy! Whatever happened to that jaguar... The traffic cameras would have caught it! Bingo! Hoho! Pretty sneaky, slick! However, if you didn't have access to the system before, I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now. No. But I have a friend at City Hall who might. Eh. Sir, if we could just review these very important billings. Sir! Oh, I'm sorry. Sir. Okay! I heard you, Bellwether, just take care of it! Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm going out. Oh, no, no. But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Gradings. Sir, that's just, oh... Oh, mutton chops. Assistant Mayor Bellwether, we need your help. OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT MAYOR  We just need to get into the traffic cam database. So fluffy! Hey! Sheep never let me get this close! You can't just touch a sheep's wool! It's like cotton candy. Stop it! Where to? Ah... Rainforest Dsitrict. Vine and Tujunga. There. Traffic cams for the whole city. This is so exiting actually. I mean, well, you know. I never get to do anything this important. But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia. Oh. I'm more of a glorified secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote. But he did give me that nice mug. WORLD'S GREATEST ASSISTANT MAYOR  DAD  Feels good to be appreciated. Smellwether! Ah. That's a fun little name he likes to use. I called him Lionfart once, he did not care for that. Let me tell you, it was not a good day for me. Yes, sir. I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon. Oh, dear. I better go. Let me know what you find. It was really nice for me to be... While we're young, Smellwether. You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself? Shush. Okay, traffic cams.. Tujunga.... Tujunga.... We're in. Who are these guys? Eh. Timberwolves. Look at these dumdums. Huh! Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl. And there it is. I mean, what is it with wolves and the howling, it's...? Howlings! Night Howlers! That's what Manchas was afraid of, wolves! The wolves are the Night Howlers! If they took Manchas.. I bet they took Otterton too. All we gotta do is find out where they went. Wait, where'd they go? You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal, which I never have, I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B. Which would put them out... right there. Well, look at you, junior detective. You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop. Eh. How dare you. Acacia Alley. Ficus Underpass. South canyon. Mmhm. They're heading out of town. Where does that road go?  Gary, quit it! You're gonna start a howl! I didn't start it. Come on. You are a clever bunny. It looks like this was a hospital. You know, after you, you're the cop. Okay, all clear. Ha. All this equipment is brand new. Carrots. Claw marks. Yeah, huge, huge claw marks. What kind of... Mr. Manchas. It's him! We found our otter. Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to find you. We're gonna get you out of here now. Or not. Guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus. Not including Manchas, it's... it's fourteen. Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files. They're all here... All the missing mammals are right here. Huh! Enough! I don't want excuses, doctor, I want answers. Mayor Lionheart, please. We're doing everything we can. Really? Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here who've gone off the rails crazy, And you can't tell me why. Now I'd call that awfully far from doing everything! Sir, it may be time to consider their biology. What? What do you mean ""biology""? The only animals going savage are predators. We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward. Hm, great idea. Tell the public. And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor who is a lion?! I'll be ruined! Well, what does Chief Bogo say? Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are going to keep it that way. Oh, no! Someone's here. Sir, you need to go. Now. Security, sweep the area. Great, we're dead. We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead. Can you swim? What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why? Aaahhhh! Carrots! Hopps! Judy! We gotta tell Bogo! Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo. Chief Bogo! Not now. Wait, is that Gazelle? No! I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer. You have the app too? Ooohhh... Chief! Clawhauser! Can't you see I'm working on the missing mammal cases? Oh! Yes, of course. About that, sir. Officer Hopps just called, she found all of them. Wow, I'm impressed. Mayor Lionheart, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you... You don't understand, I was trying to protect the city! You were just trying to protect your job. No, listen. We still don't know why this is happening. It could destroy Zootopia. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Ladies and gentlemammals, 14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found... by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment. I'm so nervous. Okay, press conference 101. You wanna look smart, answer their question with your own question and then answer that question. Like this: ""Excuse me, Officer Hopps. What can you tell us about the case?"" ""Well, was this a tough case? Yes, yes it was. You see?"" You should be up there with me. We did this together. Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not. Funny you should say that. Because, well, I've been thinking. It would be nice to have a partner. Here. In case you need something to write with. Officer Hopps. It's time. So now, I'll turn things over to the officer who cracked the case. Officer Judy Hopps. Yes? What can you tell us about the animals that went savage? Well, the animals in question... Emm. Are they all different species? Yes. Yes, they are. Okay, so what is the connection? Oh. All we know is that they are all members of the predator family. So predators are the only ones going savage? That is accu.. Yes, that is accurate, yes. Why? Why is this happening? We still don't know. But, emm. It may have something to do with biology. What do you mean, biology? A biological component. You know, something in their DNA. In their DNA, can you elaborate on that, please? Yes. What I mean is thousands of years ago Eh, predators survived through their... agressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Officer Hopps, could it happen again? It is possible. So, we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepered and are here to protect you. Will more mammals go savage? What is being done to protect us? Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators? Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps. That's all the time that we have. No more questions. Was I okay? Oh, you did fine. That went so fast, I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we... Oh, I think you said plenty. What do you mean? ""Clearly there's a biological component?"" ""These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways?"" Are you serious? I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage. Right, but a fox could? Huh? Nick, stop it, you're not like them. Oh, there's a 'them' now? You know what I mean, you're not that kind of predator. The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellant? Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met. Look. Let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? Do you think I might go nuts? You think I might go savage? You think I might try to eat you? Huh! I knew it, huh. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh? Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. No, Nick. Nick! Officer Hopps, were you just threatened by that predator? No, he's my friend. We can't even trust our own friends? That is not what I said. Please. Are we safe? Have any other foxes gone savage? More bad news in this city gripped by fear. A caribou is in critical condition. The victim of a mauling by a savage polar bear. This, the 27th such attack, comes just one week after ZPD Officer, Judy Hopps connected the violence to traditionally predatory animals. Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by popstar Gazelle was marred by protest. Go back to the forest, predator! I am from the savannah. Zootopia is a unique place. It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city. Where we celebrate our differences. This is not the Zootopia I know. The Zootopia I know is better than this. We don't just blindly assign blame. We don't know why these attacks keep happening. But it's irresponsible to label all predators as savages. It's not my Emmitt. We cannot let fear divide us. Please give me back the Zootopia I love. Come on, Hopps. The new mayor wants to see us. The mayor? Why? It would seem you've arrived. Clawhauser? What are you doing? Uh. They thought it would be better if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face that you see when you walk into the ZPD. What? They're gonna move me to records. It's downstairs. It's by the boiler. Hopps1 Integrity Honesty Bravery  Emm. I don't understand. Our city is 90% prey, Judy, and right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD. I'm... not... I'm not a hero. I came here to make the world a better place. But... ... I think I broke it. Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps. The world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops. Like you. With all due respect, sir, a good cop is supposed to serve and protect. Help the city. Not tear it apart. I don't deserve this badge. Hopps. Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit. Thank you for the opportunity. A dozen carrots. Have a nice day. Come on. Hey there, Jude. Jude the Dude. Remember that one? How we doing? I'm fine. You are not fine, your ears are droopy. Why did I think I could make a difference? Because you're a trier, that's why. You've always been a trier. Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators. Oh, not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time. Is that Gideon Grey? Yeah, it sure is. We work with him now. He's our partner. And we never would have considered it, had you not opened our minds. That's right. I mean, kid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the triburrows. That's... That's really cool, you guys. Gideon Grey. I'll be darned. Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry for the way I behaved in my youth. I had a lot of selfdoubt, and it manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and agression. I was a major jerk. Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk. Anyhow, I brought you all these pies. Hey, kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, now. There's a fourdollar word, Mr. H. My family always just call them Night Howlers. I'm sorry. What did you say? Oh. Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy. I use them to keep the bugs off the produce, but I don't like the little ones going near them on acoount of what happened to your uncle Terry. Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts. He bit the dickens out of your mother. A bunny can go savage. Savage? Well, that's a strong word. But it did hurt like the devil. Well, sure it did. There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage. Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing! Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry, come on! Oh. Thank you! I love you, bye! You catch any of that, Bon? Not one bit. That makes me feel a little bit better, I thought she was talking in tongues or something. Who is it? I need to find Nick. Please. Nick? Nick? Oh, Nick. Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're toxic flowers. I think someone is targetting predators on purpose and making them go savage. Wow. Isn't that interesting? Wait, please don't.. I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. It was ignorant, and irresponsible, and smallminded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this. But I can't do it without you. And... And after we're done... you can hate me. And... And that'll be fine. Because I was a horrible friend and I hurt you. And you can walk away knowing that you were right. All along. I really am just a dumb bunny. I really am just a dumb bunny.  I really am just a dumb bunny.  Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours. All right, get in here. Okay. Oh, you bunnies. You're so emotional. There we go, deep breath. Are youAre you just trying to steal the pen? Is that what this is? You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off! I'm sorry. HOPPS FAMILY FARM  I thought you guys only grew carrots. Mmph. What's your plan? We are gonna follow the Night Howlers. Okay, how? Know this guy? Uhhuh. I told you, I know everybody. Haha. Well, hello! Step right up. Anything you need, I got it. All your favorite movies. I've got movies that haven't even been released yet. Hey, 15% off. Make me an offer. Come on! Well, well, look who it is, the Duke of Bootleg. What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't you be melting down a Pawpsicle or something? Hey, if it isn't flopsy the copsie. We both know those weren't only onions I caught you stealing. What were you gonna do with those Night Howlers, Weselton? It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit. And there ain't nothing you can do to make me. Ice him. Ahhh! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ah! You dirty rat, why are you helping her? She's a cop! And the godmother to my future granddaughter. I'm gonna name her Judy. Ohhhh... Heh heh heh. Ice this weasel. Aww! All right, all right! Please! I'll talk. I'll talk. I stole the Night Howlers so I could sell them. They offered me what I couldn't refuse: Money. And to whom did you sell them? A ram named Doug. We got a drop spot underground. Just watch it. Doug is the opposite of friendly. He's unfriendly. Come on. The weasel wasn't lying. Yeah, it looks like old Doug's cornered the market on Night Howlers. You got Doug here. What's the mark? Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it. Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast, I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through the open window of a moving car. Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done. Or you'll see it on the news. You know, whichever comes first. Hey, Doug, open up! We've got your latte. All right, Woolter and Jesse are back, so I'm leaving now. Out. Hey. Wait, where you going? Where are you going? Get back here! What are you doing? He's gonna see you! What are you looking at? Hey! Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it. Carrots. Carrots. You better have the extra foam this time. HA! Hey! Open up! What are you doing? You just trapped us in here! We need to get this evidence to the ZPD. Okay, great. Here it is. Got it. No, all of it. Wait, what? Oh, great, you're a conductor now, huh? Hey. Listen. It would take a miracle to get this rustbucket going. Well. Hallelujah. We kinda got a situation at the lab. It just got worse! Mission accomplished. Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toottoot? All right. One toottoot. Well, I can cross that off the bucket list. I may have to rescind that victory toottoot. Maybe that's just hail. Back off! Incoming! Carrots! Don't stop! Keep going. No, stop. Please stop! Do not stop this car! Ahhh! Owww! Whoa! Speed up, Nick. Speed up! There's another train coming! Trust me, speed up. Stop the train! Hey. Need some help? Oh, no. Oh, no no no. Too fast! Too fast! Hold on! I think this is our stop. Okay, maybe... Maybe some of the evidence survived. Everything is gone. We've lost it all. Yeah. All, except for this. Ah, ha ha ha ha! Ooh, Nick! Yes! Ow. Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD. Cut through the Natural History Museum. There it is. Judy. Judy! Mayor Bellwether. We found out what's happening. Someone's darting predators with a serum. That's what's making them go savage. I'm so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job. Thank you, ma'am. How did you know where to find us? I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now. You know what? I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD. Run. Run. Get them! Ah.... Carrots! Aww. Here, I got you. Get in here. Okay. Now, just relax. Whoops. Blueberry? Pass. Come on out, Judy. Take the case. Get it to Bogo. I'm not gonna leave you behind, that's not happening. I can't walk. Just.. We'll think of something. We're on the same team, Judy. Underestimated. Underappreciated. Aren't you sick of it? Predators. They may be strong and loud. But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. Think about it. 90% of the population united against a common enemy. We'll be unstoppable. Huh? Over there! Oh! Ah! Well, you should have just stayed on the carrot farm, huh? It really is too bad, I did like you. What are you gonna do? Kill me? Oohhh. No, of course not. He is. No! Oh, Nick? Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the Natural History Museum! Officer Hopps is down. Please hurry! No, Nick. Don't do this. Fight it. Oh, but he can't help it. Can he? Since predators are just biologically predisposed to be savages. Get back! Gosh! Think of the headline! Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox. So that's it? Prey fears predator, and you stay in power? Yeah. Pretty much. It won't work. Fear always works. And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way. Ah! Oh, Nick. No. Byebye, bunny. Blahhh... Blood, blood, blood! And death. All right, you know you're milking it. Besides, I think we got it. I think we got it. We got it up there, thank you, yaketyyak. You laid it all out beautifully. What? Yeah. Oh, areare you looking for the serum? Well, it's right here. What you've got in the weapon there, those are blueberries, from my family's farm. Mmmuch. They are delicious. You should try some. I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too. It's my word against yours. Ooo. Actually... And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.  It's your word against yours. Huh? It's called a hustle, Sweetheart. Boom! Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether is behind bars today, guilty of masterminding the savage attacks that have plagued Zootopia of late. Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart, denies any knowledge of her plot, claiming he was just trying to protect the city. Did I falsely imprison those animals? Well, yes. Yes, I did. It was a classic doing the wrong thing for the right reason kind of a deal. In related news, doctors say the Night Howlers' antidote is proving effective in rehabilitating the afflicted predators. Oh, Emmitt! Thank you. When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place. Where everyone got along, and anyone could be anything. Turns out, real life is a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations. We all make mistakes. Which means, hey, glass half full, we all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another. The more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. So no matter what type of animal you are. From the biggest elephant, to our first fox. I implore you. Try..... Try to make the world a better place. OFFICER Nicholas P. Wilde  Look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us. Yeh! Yeh! All right, all right, enough. Shut it! We have some new recruits with us this morning. Including our first fox. Who cares. Hah. You should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir. Shut your mouth, Wilde. Assignments. Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato. Tundratown SWAT. Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard. Undercover. Hopps, Wilde. Parking duty. Dismissed. Just kidding! We have reports of a street racer tearing up Savannah Central. Find him. Shut him down. So are all the rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you? Oops. Sorry. Heh heh. Sly bunny. Dumb fox. You know you love me. Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do. Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour, I hope you have a good explanation. Flash, Flash. Hundred Yard Dash! Nick... Good evening, Zootopia! Come on, everybody. Put your paws up.  I messed up tonight   I lost another fight   I still mess up but I'll just start again   I keep falling down   I keep on hitting the ground   I always get up now to see what's next   I wonât give up,   no I wonât give in   Till I reach the end   And then Iâll start again   Though Iâm on the lead   I wanna try everything   I wanna try even though I could fail   I wonât give up,   no I wonât give in   Till I reach the end   And then Iâll start again   No I won't leave   I wanna try everything   I wanna try even though I could fail   Oh oh oh oh   Try everything  "
