Eeyore, Rabbit, Tigger and Pooh are working on a plan to get honey from a beehive. This involves getting the bees to move into a new hive by convincing them that Eeyore is a bee. Piglet comes up to them during the attempt, but is effectively told that he is too small to help. The plan goes awry when the bees do not fall for it, but Piglet manages to divert the bees into the new hive using a funnel and then seals the hive shut, trapping the bees. Unfortunately, no one has seen Piglet's heroism. Piglet, feeling uncared for, wanders sadly away right before the bees escape from the fake hive. After escaping from the bees, Pooh, Rabbit, Tigger, and Eeyore notice that Piglet is missing and decide to find him by using a scrapbook, in which he has drawn pictures of the adventures that he has shared with his friends. On their way to Kanga’s, they start to remember when Kanga and Roo first moved to the Hundred Acre Wood, which Rabbit pretends not to remember, so they decide to tell the story. When Kanga and Roo arrived, Pooh, Tigger Piglet and Rabbit were scared of the newcomers and thought they were fierce monsters. So Rabbit comes up with a plan to kidnap Roo and replace him with Piglet so Kanga would be forced to leave for Roo’s safe return. But Kanga notices Piglet and pretends to fall for it, giving Piglet fishy oil, causing him to bounce off the walls, and giving him a bath. After the bath, Kanga gives Piglet a cookie and a kiss and Piglet realizes that Kanga is nice. Rabbit and Roo have become friends and they decide that Kanga and Roo should stay. Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit and Eeyore make it to Kanga’s, where Roo decides to join them to look for Piglet. They find a drawing of the day Christopher Robin took them on an expedition to find the North Pole. Rabbit and Tigger argue over which way to go, so Pooh decides to tell the story to figure out the way. During the expedition, Roo falls into the river. Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit and Eeyore attempt to save him, but fail. Piglet tries to help, but Tigger tells him to stay back. Piglet uses a really long stick to catapult Roo out of the river and gives the stick to Pooh so he can catch Roo, but Roo is caught by Kanga. Christopher Robin arrives and sees Pooh holding the stick, which is actually the North Pole. Piglet’s heroism is over shadowed. Back in the present, the friends regret not sharing the praise of Piglet. They start to worry when a storm arrives. To reassure Roo, Pooh and Eeyore tell him the story of how Piglet built Eeyore’s house. Piglet and Pooh come up with the idea to build Eeyore a house. Piglet wants to call it “Pooh and Piglet Corner”, but Pooh thinks that Pooh Corner sounds better. Tigger joins them and they decide to use a pile of sticks in build it. Tigger and Pooh do most of the work, whilst Piglet, unintentionally, gets in the way. The final house, however, collapses, but Tigger and Pooh go off to tell Eeyore that Pooh is offering Eeyore to live with him. Pooh and Tigger find out that Eeyore already built his house out of the same sticks they used. Piglet arrives and they take Eeyore to his house, which Piglet built perfectly. But the wind gets the credit for moving it. Piglet shows Eeyore a sign so he’ll remember where it is. As the rain begins to fall, Tigger wants to skip to the end of the scrapbook, but Rabbit insists that they should go in order. The raindrops ruin the drawings and the book falls into the river. The friends decide return to Piglet’s house to avoid Roo catching a cold. Pooh regrets not calling Eeyore’s house Pooh and Piglet Corner. While at Piglet’s, they start to draw new pictures of Piglet and their adventures. They decide to go back to looking for Piglet. They come across several pictures from the scrapbook, which have floated downstream and then find the book’s bindings, suspended on a broken hollow old log, overhanging a raging waterfall. Pooh goes to retrieve it, but falls into a hole in the log. The others try to reach him, but the rescue attempt is just too short. Just as they ask who can help, Piglet arrives and helps pull Pooh to safety just as the log begins to collapse, causing the scrapbook to fall into the river. Eeyore, Roo, Rabbit and Tigger make it to the other side of ravine, but Pooh and Piglet fail to make it. They being to cry and fail to see Pooh and Piglet emerging from the log. The friends take Piglet to show him their new drawings, including a large one of Piglet dressed as a knight in shining armour. The film ends with everyone throwing a party to celebrate Piglet’s heroism and Pooh taking Piglet to Eeyores' house, where he has changed the sign to “Pooh and Piglet Corner; """the" least [they] could do for a little Piglet, who has done such big "things!""."
