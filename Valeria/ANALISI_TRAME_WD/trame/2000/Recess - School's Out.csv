An unidentified group of criminals break into a U.S. Army base in the southwestern desert. After overpowering and tasering the scientists working on a top-secret project, their leader tells the group that the next part of their plan is to establish their base at Third Street Elementary School. On the last day of the school year at Third Street, T.J. Detweiler and his gang pull off one last big prank before summer vacation begins. Since the school year is over and there is no time left for Miss Finster and Principal Prickly to impose and carry out any more punishments, they have no choice but to let the kids go free. T.J. is at first happy that school is out and he will have all summer to play with his five best friends. His happiness ends when his friends reveal that they’re all going to summer camps. Vince LaSalle is going to baseball camp, Ashley Spinelli is going to wrestling training camp, Gus Griswald is going to military camp, Gretchen Grundler is going to space camp and Mikey Blumberg is going to a summer-long singing training program. The next morning, T.J. says good-bye to his friends thinks that it’s going to be a bad summer. Completely alone and with no enriching activities to do, T.J. reluctantly goes to a play date with Randall, who is the snitch and most unpopular kid at Third Street. On the way to Randall's house, T.J. passes by the school and sees a strange green glowing light emanating from all the windows. He goes over to investigate, but before he can see any more, T.J. is chased away by a tall, burly bald man. The next day, T.J. goes back to the school to investigate. He climbs over the fence, peers into a window and sees a group of scientists testing a laser device. Horrified, he runs to tell his parents, but they don’t believe him. So he tells the police, but they don’t believe him either. Just as T.J. comes out of the police station, he spies Principal Prickly and follows him to a golf course. Prickly doesn’t believe him, but his friends convince him to go with T.J. to the school to see what is happening. Upon arriving at the school, Prickly inserts his key into the school's main entrance. But as soon as he does this, Prickly is zapped by a massive surge of green electric energy and is dematerialized, leaving only his smoldering golf shoes on the steps in front of the school. Out of options, T.J. blackmails his sister Becky into driving him to each of his five friends' summer camps to bring them back and help him investigate more. When they get back, they see a group of guards unloading crates from one of their vans. They steal one of the crates, but only see a bunch of school papers. The gang accuses T.J. of making the whole thing up to bring them back and Gus points to Prickly getting into his car and driving away. They attempt to return to their camps, until they see a giant laser device being used in the school and they realize that T.J. was telling the truth and agree to help him investigate. They decide to do a stakeout every night, until Vince realizes that they have to go back to camp, so T.J. tells them that he’ll have Becky drive them back to camp in the morning and pick them up at night and he calls their friends at the camps to cover for the gang. The next day, T.J. finds Prickly's golf pants in the dumpster and finds out that the Prickly he saw driving away was really the bald man in disguise. That night, the gang finds a note in the pants pocket requesting help and they decide to infiltrate the school to rescue Prickly and find out what is really going on. The gang enter the school and climb through an air vent, where they find out that the school auditorium has been converted into a science lab. The gang is caught trespassing and they escape, but T.J. is captured. The gang attempts to save him, but they are chased by a group of ninjas. T.J. is locked in a storage room where Pricky is held prisoner. It is revealed that the school has been taken over by an anti-recess group led by Phillium Benedict, an old friend of Pricky’s. Prickly tells T.J. the full story of himself and Benedict. Back in 1968, when Prickly and Finster were hired as teachers, Benedict has been named principal of Third Street School and decides to abolish Recess to raise students’ test scores. Prickly tells the superintendent about this and the latter fires Benedict for his actions and hires Prickly as Benedict’s replacement and Finster dumps Benedict. Benedict accuses Prickly for doing it to get his job and vows revenge. Prickly also tells T.J. that Benedict entered politics. He eventually became the Secretary of Education, until the president fired him for attempting to abolish recess again on a nationwide scale. After the police didn’t believe the gang, they look through the crate of documents to find out Benedict’s plan. Spinelli and Gretchen find Benedict’s datebook and Gretchen sees an event that’s happening the next day where the moon is closer to the Earth and she finds out that the laser device is a tractor beam. Meanwhile, T.J. and Prickly discover Benedict’s plan, which is to use the tractor beam to destroy summer vacation by moving the moon into a different orbit, causing the Earth to be put into a permanent ice age. With Becky's help, the gang brings all the students of Third Street from their camps back to the school to stop Benedict's plan. Benedict locks T.J. and Prickly in a giant bird cage where an angry T.J. tells Prickly that he doesn’t know about summer vacation. Prickly tells T.J. that he actually misses the summer vacations he had when he was a kid and they escape. With a plan by Gus, Mikey distracts the guards and lures them to a giant hole made by the Diggers using space power shovels from the space camp. T.J. and Prickly steal two guards’ uniforms and attempt to infiltrate the auditorium, but their cover is blown and they hide in the cafeteria. The kids defeat the guards and ninjas, but the bald man attempts to capture them, but T.J. and Prickly pour a kettle of corn chowder from the cafeteria on him. The kids and Prickly try to stop Benedict’s plan, but he prepares to activate his tractor beam. Before he can complete the activation, Finster arrives with all the school's staff and faculty to help Prickly and the kids and a big battle begins. Benedict tries to activate the beam and attempts to taser Prickly when he tries to stop him, but Prickly punches Benedict and Benedict accidentally activates the tractor beam. The switch becomes stuck and Prickly is unable to shut it off, so T.J. tosses a baseball to Vince and he throws the ball into beam's power core, short-circuiting the power supply and causing the tractor beam device to collapses. Benedict and his men are arrested and T.J., the gang and the students and teachers of Third Street School are considered heroes. The gang decides to spend the rest of the summer with T.J. instead of going back to summer camp. Before they leave, T.J. decides to thank Prickly for everything he did, but Prickly thanks him for reminding him of his true and original motivation for becoming an educator: to help children. As T.J. leaves, Prickly reminds T.J. that he might be facing punishment for his last day of school prank. T.J. replies equally humorously that September is still a long way off, before heading to a pond with his friends.
