In the six years since the first film, Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz have stayed best friends, hanging out after work in Litwak's Arcade. One day, Vanellope expresses how bored she has become of Sugar Rush's tracks, so Ralph sneaks into the game and makes a new track for her. The arcade player fights Vanellope's control, causing the cabinet's steering wheel to pop off. Mr. Litwak attempts to reattach the wheel to the console, but accidentally breaks it in half. As the company that made Sugar Rush is defunct, and the cost of a replacement wheel on eBay is too high, Litwak decides to scrap Sugar Rush, and unplugs the game. With Fix-It Felix and Tamora Jean Calhoun's help, Ralph finds homes for all its citizens as a short term measure as they figure out how to save the game. After talking with Felix, Ralph decides to grab Vanellope and travel to the Internet via Litwak's new Wi-Fi router. With the help of the search engine KnowsMore, they are directed to eBay. They end up winning the auction for the wheel, but they unintentionally spike the price to US$27,001, and only have 24 hours to come up with the funds or they will forfeit the bid and lose the wheel. On the way out, they run into clickbait salesman J.P. Spamley, who offers them a lucrative job of stealing a car from Shank, the lead character in the popular online game Slaughter Race. They steal Shank's car, but she stops them before they can leave the game with it. Shank explains that there are better ways to make money on the Internet than stealing, and she then makes a viral video of Ralph and uploads it to video sharing site BuzzzTube, and tells them to check with BuzzzTube's head algorithm, Yesss, about getting money for it. At BuzzzTube, Yesss is elated by how popular Ralph's video is, and they come up with the idea of making more videos, which if given enough views, will earn them the money for the wheel in no time. Vanellope offers to help advertise the videos, and Ralph has Yesss send her to """Oh" My "Disney""." There, Vanellope befriends the Disney Princesses, being encouraged by them to address her sense of un-fulfillment and reaching a musical epiphany. Once Ralph makes enough money to purchase the wheel, he contacts Vanellope through a device Yesss had given them; he finds Vanellope talking with Shank about staying in Slaughter Race, having found her epiphany there due to its relative novelty compared to Sugar Rush. Ralph asks Spamley for a way to draw Vanellope out of the game, and he takes him to the deep web vendor Double Dan. Dan provides Ralph with a virus, Arthur, that feeds off insecurities and replicates them. When Ralph unleashes Arthur into Slaughter Race, it replicates Vanellope's glitch, triggering a server reboot. Shank and the others help Vanellope to escape before the game resets. Ralph confesses to her that the crash was his fault, and an outraged Vanellope ends her friendship with Ralph and throws away his hero cookie medal, causing it to break in half. Arthur copies Ralph's insecurities and starts making duplicates of Ralph. The clones soon overrun the internet in a DOS attack, all chasing after Vanellope to keep her for themselves. Ralph saves her and attempts to lure the clones into a firewall, but they form a giant Ralph monster that seizes them both. Ralph comes to accept that Vanellope can make her own choices, letting go of his insecurities, and causing the giant Ralph monster and the clones to disappear. Ralph gives half of the broken medal to Vanellope and they bid each other a tearful farewell as Shank has arranged for Vanellope to respawn in Slaughter Race. Back in the arcade, Sugar Rush gets repaired, and Ralph partakes in social activities with the other arcade characters as he stays in touch with Vanellope over video chat, feeling content with his ability to be independent.
