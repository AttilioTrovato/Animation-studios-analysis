In the land of Prydain, Taran is an """assistant" "pig-keeper""" on the small farm of Caer Dallben, home of Dallben the Enchanter. Taran dreams of becoming a famous warrior. Dallben learns that the Horned King is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the """Cauldron-Born""." Dallben fears the Horned King will try to steal his pig Hen Wen, who has oracular powers, and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by Gwythaints, the Horned King's dragon-like creatures. Taran follows them to the Horned King's castle. Along the way, he encounters the pestering, dog-like creature Gurgi, who wants to be Taran's friend. Frustrated by Gurgi's antics and fear of the castle, Taran leaves him. He sneaks inside and rescues Hen Wen, but although she escapes, Taran is captured and thrown into the dungeon. A fellow captive named Princess Eilonwy frees Taran as she is trying to make her own escape. In the catacombs beneath the castle, Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king, where Taran arms himself with the king's sword. It contains magic that allows him to effectively fight the Horned King's minions and so to fulfil his dream of heroism. Along with a third prisoner, the comical, middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are soon reunited with Gurgi. Upon discovering that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his goblin, Creeper, to send the Gwythaints to follow Taran. Following Hen Wen's trail, the four companions stumble into the underground kingdom of the Fair Folk who reveal that Hen Wen is under their protection. When the kindly King Eidilleg reveals that he knows where the cauldron is, Taran decides to destroy it. Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur agree to join him and Eidilleg's obnoxious right-hand man Doli is assigned to lead them to the Marshes of Morva while the Fair Folk escort Hen Wen safely back to Caer Dallben. At the marshes they learn that the cauldron is held by three witchesâ€”the grasping Orddu, who acts as leader; the greedy Orgoch; and the more benevolent Orwen, who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight. Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran's sword and he reluctantly agrees, knowing it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal that the cauldron is indestructible, and that its power can only be broken when someone climbs in under his own free will, which will kill him. Doli angrily abandons the group. Although Taran feels foolish for aspiring to destroy the cauldron alone, his companions show their belief in him; and Eilonwy and Taran almost kiss. Suddenly they are interrupted by the Horned King's soldiers who have followed them to Morva. Gurgi runs away before they seize the cauldron and take the companions back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world. Gurgi manages to sneak into the castle and rescue his friends. Taran decides to cast himself into the cauldron to save everyone, but Gurgi stops him and jumps into it himself. The undead army collapses. When the Horned King spots Taran, he infers the turn of events, says that Taran has interfered for the last time, and throws the youth toward the cauldron; however, the cauldron's magic is out of control. It consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire, killing him and destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever. The three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. However, Taran has finally realised Gurgi's true friendship, and he asks them to revive his friend in exchange for the cauldron, choosing to give up his magical sword permanently. Fflewddur challenges the reluctant witches to demonstrate their powers, and upon hearing Fflewddur's remarks, the witches honor the request, returning Gurgi to them. At first, Gurgi appears to be dead but is resurrected. After they reunite, he pushes Taran and Eilonwy into a kiss. The four friends then journey back to Caer Dallben where Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism.
