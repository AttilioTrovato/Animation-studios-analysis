Love is a song that never ends 
Life may be swift and fleeting 
Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music 
Comes each day like the dawn 
Love is a song that never ends 
One simple theme repeating 
Like the voice of a heavenly choir 
Love's sweet music flows on 
Like the voice of a heavenly choir 
Love's sweet music flows on 
Hoo!
Hoohoo, hoo, hoo.
Hoohoo!
Wake up! Wake up!
Oh, what now?
Wake up, Friend Owl.

The new prince is born.
We're going to see him.
Come on. You better hurry up.
Oh. Well, look.
Well.
Isn't he cute?
Oh...
Well... this is quite an occasion.
Yes, sir, it isn't every
day a prince is born.
You're to be congratulated.
Yes, congratulations.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

Good morning, young prince.
Goodbye.
Good morning, young prince.
Good morning, young prince.
Good morning. Hm.
Nice sunny day.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Did the young prince fall down?
Is he hurt?
No, he's all right.
He doesn't walk very good, does he?
Thumper.
Yes, Mama?
What did your father
tell you this morning?
If you can't say something nice...
don't say nothing at all.
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.
Come on, get up. Get up, Bambi.
Get up.

I'm thumping. That's why

Thumper!
Thumper!
Come on. You can do it.
Hop over it. Like this.
Hop over it.
Hop over it.
Like this.
You didn't hop far enough.
That's it. Now the other one.
Gee whiz, what happened that time?
Those are birds.
Bur.

Look, he's trying to talk.

He's trying to say "bird".
Say "bird".

The young prince said "bird".
Bird, bird, bird,

Bird!
No, that's not a bird.
That's a butterfly.
Butterfly?
Butter...
Butterfly.
No, that's a flower.
Flower?
Uhhuh, it's pretty.
Purty.
Flower!
Me?
No, no.
That's not a flower.
He's a little...
Oh, that's all right.
He can call me a
flower if he wants to.
I don't mind.
Purty! Purty flower!
Oh...
gosh.
I think I better go home now.

Mother, what we going to do today?
I'm going to take
you to the meadow.
Meadow? What's the meadow?
It's a very wonderful place.
Then why haven't we
been there before?
You weren't big enough.
Mother, you know what?
What?
We're not the only
deer in the forest.
Where did you hear that?
Thumper told me.
Well, he's right.
There are many deer in
the forest besides us.
Then why don't I ever see them?
You will, sometime.
On the meadow?
Perhaps.
Hush now.
We're almost there.
The meadow!
Wait!
Bambi, wait!
You must never rush
out on the meadow.
There might be danger.
Out there, we're unprotected.
The meadow is wide and open,
and there are no trees
or bushes to hide us.
So we have to be very careful.
Wait here.
I'll go out first. And if the
meadow is safe, I'll call you.
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.
Come on.
Good morning, Prince Bambi.
Good morning, young prince.
Hello. What ya eatin'?
Clover.
It's awfully good.
It's delicious.
Why don't you try some?
No, no, not that green stuff.
Just eat the blossoms.
That's the good stuff.
Thumper.
Yes, Mama?
What did your father tell you?
About what?
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?
Oh, that one.
Eating greens is a special treat.
It makes long ears
and great big feet.
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.
I made that last part up myself.
Watch out.
Watch out.
That's little Faline.
He's kind of bashful,
isn't he, Mama?
Well, maybe he wouldn't
be if you'd say hello.
Hello, Bambi.
I said hello.
Well, aren't you
going to answer her?
You're not afraid, are you?
Well, then, go ahead.
Go on, say hello.
Hello.
You!
He stopped and looked at me.
Yes, I know.
Why was everyone still when
he came on the meadow?
Everyone respects him.
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.
He's very brave and very wise.
That's why he's known as the
Great Prince of the Forest.
Faline!
Bambi!
Mother!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Come on out, Bambi.
Come on.
It's safe now.
We don't have to hide any longer.
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?
Man... was in the forest.
Mother, look! What's
all that white stuff?
Why, it's snow.
Snow?
Yes.
Winter has come.
Hiya, Bambi.
Watch what I can do.
Whoo!
Come on! It's all right!
Look!
The water's stiff.
Yippee!
Some fun, huh, Bambi?
Come on, get up. Like this.
No, no.
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.
Guess you better unwind it.
Arghh!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Flower!
Is it spring yet?
No. Winter's just started.
What ya doin'? Hibernatin'?
Uhhuh.
What do you want to do that for?
All us flowers sleep in the winter.
Well... good night.
Winter sure is long, isn't it?
It seems long.
But it won't last forever.
I'm awful hungry, Mother.
Yes, I know.
Bambi.
Bambi, come here.
Look.
New spring grass.
Bambi. Quick!
The thicket!
Faster! Faster, Bambi!
Don't look back! Keep running!
Keep running!
We made it!
We made it, Mother!
We...
Mother!
Mother!
Mother, where are you?!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Your mother can't be
with you anymore.
Come.
My son.
Let's sing a gay
little spring song 
This is the season to sing 
So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best 
And warble a song about spring 
Spring, spring, spring 
Let's get together and sing 
Let's sing a gay
little spring song 
Just like the bird on the wing 
Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright 
So let's get together and sing 
Sing, sing, sing 
Let's sing a song about spring 
Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May 
Get into the mood
And be merry today 
Forget all your troubles
And warble away... 
Wait!
Oh, what now?
Hey! Hey!
Stop that racket!
Scat! Shoo! Shoo!
Let's sing a song about spring 
I'll fix 'em.
There. I guess...
that'll teach 'em.
Oh, what's the use?
This is the season to sing 
Same thing every spring.
Tweettweet! Tweettweet!
Tweettweet! Tweettweet!
Love's sweet song.
Hm! Pain in the pin
feathers, I call it.
Stop it!
Get out of here. All of you.
And you, too!
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?
Why, it... it's the young prince.
Bambi!
My, my, how you've changed.
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.
I see you've traded in your
spots for a pair of antlers.
You know, just the other day I
was talking to myself about you.
And we were wondering
what had become of you.
Hello, Bambi!
Remember me?
Thumper!
Righto!
Hi, fellas.
Flower.
Yeah.
Well, what's the matter with them?
Why are they acting that way?
Why, don't you know?
They're twitterpated.
Twitterpated?
Yes.
Nearly everybody gets
twitterpated in the spring time.
For example...
you're walking along,
minding your own business,
you're looking neither to
the left nor to the right,
when all of a sudden...
you run smack into a pretty face.
You begin to get weak in the knees.
Your head's in a whirl.
And then you feel
light as a feather.
And before you know it,
you're walking on air.
And then you know what?
You're knocked for a loop.
And you completely lose your head.
Gosh, that's awful.
Gee whiz.
Terrible.
And that ain't all.
It can happen to anybody.
So you'd better be careful.
It could happen to
you, and you, and...
Yes, it could even happen to you.
Well, it's not going
to happen to me.
Me neither.
Me neither.
Ha! Twitterpated!
Oh...
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Bambi.
Don't you remember me?
I'm Faline.
Bambi.
Bambi.
Bambi!
I bring you a song 
And I sing as I go 
For I want you to know 
That I'm looking for romance 
I bring you a song 
In the hope that you'll see 
When you're looking at me 
That I'm looking for love 
I'm seeking that glow 
Only found when you're
young and it's May 
Only found on that wonderful day 
When all longing is through 
I'm seeking that glow 
Only found when
a thrill is complete 
Only found when two
hearts gently beat 
To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new 
I bring you a song 
For I'm seeking romance 
You're by my side
There's a moon up above 
It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright 
It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love 
I bring you a song 
For I'm seeking romance 
And you 
It is Man.
He is here again.
There are many this time.
We must go deep into the forest.
Hurry! Follow me!
Faline!
Bambi.
Bambi, where are you?
Bambi!
Bambi!
Faline!
Faline!
Faline!
Listen.
He's coming!
Hush!
Be quiet.
He's coming closer.
Be calm. Don't get excited.
We better fly.
No. No, don't fly.
Whatever you do, don't fly.
He's almost here! I can't
stand it any longer!
Bambi! Bambi!
Faline!
Bambi!
Bambi!
Quick, Faline! Jump!
Get up, Bambi.
Get up!
You must get up.
Get up!
Get up!
Now... come with me.
Bambi.
Hoo!
Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl.
Wake up, Friend Owl.
Oh, what now?
Hey, what's going on around here?
It's happened.
Happened?
Yes. In the thicket.
Hurry up, Bambi.
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.
Oh. Well.
Look.
Two of them.
Oh!
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.
Prince Bambi ought
to be mighty proud.
Love is a song that never ends

Of a heavenly choir
