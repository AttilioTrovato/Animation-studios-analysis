Ain't that the funniest thing

Hey, guys, look it!
Smitty's an elephant!
Aw, let me see!
Boo!
You can't hide him from us.
Yeah, his ears are still sticking out.
Come on!
We wanna see him!
We wanna laugh.
Sure, that's what we came for.
Hey, the biggest
slingshot in the world.
Hey! Cut that out!
Hey, let's get out of here.
You're hurting me! Help!
Here, you! What's going on?
Down. Mrs Jumbo, down!
Surround her. Tie her down.
Get down!
Calm down! Tie her down!
Darling, it was so funny.
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.
After all, one mustn't
forget one is a lady.
Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
Oh, that's very true.
Oh, well, I suppose
that's mother love.
But it's certainly no
excuse for what she did.
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.
It's true, my dear, and she
has such a streak in...
A guy can't eat in peace.
Yes, but mother love does...
Gab, gab, gab. Always gossiping.
Girls, girls! Listen!
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.
Well, darling, tell us all.
Go on, go on.
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.
No!
You don't mean it!
Oh, how awful for her!
Well, II must say, II don't
blame her for anything.
You're absolutely right. It's
all the fault of that little...
FREAK.
Yes, him with those ears that
only a mother could love.
What's the matter with his ears?
I don't see nothing wrong with
'em. I think they're cute.
Ladies, ladies! It's no
laughing matter at all.
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.
His disgrace is our own shame.
Yes, that's true. That's very true.
Oh, indeed it is.
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at
the same bale of hay with him.
No. Right.
Me either, dearie.
I should say.
Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.
Here he comes now.
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.
Shh.
How do ya like that? Giving
him the cold shoulder.
Poor little guy.
There he goes, without
a friend in the world.
Nobody to turn to.
Oh, I'll do something
about this.
A mouse!
So ya like to pick
on little guys, huh?
Well, why don't you pick on me?
A proud race.
Overstuffed hay bags!
Boo!
Still afraid of a mouse.
Hoho, boy. Wait'll I
tell the little guy.
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.
You can come out now.
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.
Come on out, won't ya?
You're not really afraid
of little me, are ya?
Ya are? Must've
overdid it in there.
Don't know my own
strength sometimes.
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.
Uhuhuhuh. Ya gotta
come out first.
Too bad ya don't trust
me, 'cause I thought...
uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.
Well, that's more like it.
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.
She's just brokenhearted.
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.
Uhoh. Boy, I stepped
in it that time.
Aw, gee, Dumbo. I think
your ears are beautiful.
Sure. As a matter of fact, I
think they're very decorative.
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.
Hoho, boy. All we gotta
do is build an act.
Make ya a star. A headliner!
Dumbo the Great!
Uhoh. The great what?
Ya know, Dumbo, we
gotta get an idea.
Not just any idea. Something
colossal, like, uh...
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!
Huh. He never had an
idea in his life.
Just visualize: One
elephant climbs up...
on top of another
elephant until finally...
all 17 elephants...
have constructed an
enormous pyramid...
of pachyderms.
I step out.
I blow the whistle.
Yeah.
The trumpets are trumpeting.
Yeah.
And now...
comes the climax!
Yeah? What is the climax?
Hmm. I don't know.
I knew he never had nothing.
Well, maybe it comes to me...
in a vision while I dream.
Good night, Joe.
Good night, Boss.
Climax.
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.
I'll be back in a minute. I'm
gonna take care of your future.
I am the voice of your
subconscious mind.
Your inspiration.
Now, concentrate.
Remember? Your pyramid
of elephants...
are standing in the ring
waiting for a climax.
Climax.
You are now getting that climax.
Climax.
How's the reception?
Coming through okay? Good.
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.
Climax.
Galloping across the arena.
Arena.
He jumps from a springboard...
to a platform.
At the very pinnacle of your
pyramid, he waves a flag...
for a glorious finish!
Finish?
And who is your climax?
The little elephant
with the big ears!
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon! Dumbo!
What?
Dumbo.
Dumbo.
Dumbo.
Dumbo.
Dumbo.
Dumbo.
I got it! I got it!
Ladies and gentlemen...
we will now present for
your entertainment...
the most stupendous,
magnificent...
supercolossal spectacle.
On this tiny...
little, insignificant ball...
we will construct for you...
a pyramid, not of
wood, not of stone...
To hear him talk, you'd think
he was going to do it.
But a living, breathing...
The stuffed shirt.
Pyramid of ponderous,
pulsating...
pulchritudinous pachyderms!
I give you the elephants.
Aren't we a bit clumsy?
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?
You're no cream puff
yourself, dearie.
Quiet up there. Tend
to your work, girls.
Take your foot out of
my eye, clumsy ox.
Steady, girls.
Boy, that was a close one.
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.
Okay, okay. Don't wave
it no more. I saw ya.
Now, look. All ya gotta
do is run out, see?
Jump on the springboard.
All right, now show me just
how you're gonna do it.
That's it. Attaboy. That's
the stuff. Come on.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!
Oh, those ears. We gotta
do somethin', quick.
Ladies and gentlemen...
you have now seen
the impossible...
accomplished in front
of your faces.
Seven jungle giants...
each one weighing not...
That windbag!
Why doesn't he come to the point?
7,500 pounds!
And now, I present...
the world's smallest
little elephant...
who will spring from
this springboard...
in one spring...
to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...
for a grand climax!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you Dumbo!
Go on! Get goin'!
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!
You're on, Dumbo.
Out of my way, assassin!
Dear!
Ohh.
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.
Because of that Dumbo, I never
can show my face there again.
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!
I'd just like to spank the
daylights out of him...
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.
Oh, that won't be
necessary, dearie.
They fixed him good.
What do you mean?
WhWhat did they do?
Did they beat him?
What is it, darling?
Tell us.
Come, come. I demand to know.
Oh. Well, they've
gone and made him...
Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
Out with it!
Made him a clown.
A clown?
No!
Yes.
Oh, the shame of it.
Let us take the solemn vow.
From now on, he is no longer...
an elephant.
Please! Help me
save my poor baby!
Whoo! Save my child!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you? Yoohoo!
Yoohoo! Yoohoo!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Are we good?
Thirteen curtain
calls. Thirteen!
Yeah, sure brought down
the house, all right.
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em. Ask
me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.
You said it. We rolled
'em in the aisles.
Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
Oh, "what a act" is right.
Stupendous, I calls it.
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.
Yeah, yeah, you bet.
Here, boys.
This calls for a real
celebration. Come and get it.
Poison! Am I thirsty.
I could use one of them myself.
This one's on Dumbo.
Yeah, Dumbo.
Dumbo!
Here's plaster in his eyes.
See? They're drinking
a toast to ya.
Yeah. You're a big hit.
Why, uh, you're terrific.
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

Oh. Right over there.
Cosy little place, ain't it?
Mrs Jumbo. I hope she's in.
Someone to see ya.
Baby mine. 
Don't you cry. 
Baby mine. 
Dry your eyes. 
Rest your head. 
Close to my heart.

Baby mine. 
Here ya are. Pour it

Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.
Just wait'll we hit the big town.
This gives me an idea.
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.
Yeah! If they laugh when
he jumps 20 feet...
they'll laugh twice as
hard if he jumps 40 feet.
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
Simple mathematics.
Let's make it 80 feet.
Don't be a piker. 180.
Make it 300.
A thousand.
Yeah, that's good.
Hey, be careful.
You'll hurt the little guy.
Aw, go on.
Elephants ain't got no feelings.
No, they're made of rubber.
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, hey! Let's hit
him for a raise.
Yeah, sure. This is
worth real dough.
Oh, we're gonna hit the
big boss for a raise. 
Yes, we're gonna hit the
big boss for a raise. 
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny. 
We're gonna hit the
big boss for a raise 
I know how ya feel, Dumbo, but you
gotta pull yourself together.
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?
Remember, you come
of a proud race.
Why you're aaa...
a pachyderm...
and pachyderms don't cry.
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.
There. Ya see?
Well, ain't nothing a

Swallow it.
Hoho. They can't keep us down.
Oh, I guess you had one
little one left over.

Now, let's see.
Elephants can't climb

Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.
Couldn't jump up.
Mmmm. It's too high.
Hey there, son. Maybe

Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!
Boy, am I stupid. Why didn't

This has gone far enough.
Quiet, gentlemen.
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.
You ought a be ashamed
of yourselves.
A bunch of big guys like you...
picking on a poor
little orphan like him.
Suppose you was torn away from your
mother when you was just a baby...
nobody to tuck you
in at nights...
no warm, soft, caressing
trunk to snuzzle into.
How would you like to
be left out alone...
in a cold, cruel,
heartless world?
And why? I ask ya, why?
Just because he's got those big
ears, they call him a freak.
The laughing stock
of the circus.
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...
they threw her into the clink.
And on top of that,
they made him a clown!
Socially, he's washed up.
Ah, but what's the use of talking
to you coldhearted birds?
Go ahead. Have your fun.
Laugh at him. Kick him,
now that he's down.
Go on!
We don't care.
Come on, Dumbo.
Hey, brother, wwwait a minute.
