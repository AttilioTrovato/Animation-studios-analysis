Once upon a time,
in a faraway land, 
a young prince lived
in a shining castle. 
Although he had everything
his heart desired, 
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind. 
But then, one winter's night, 
an old beggar woman came
to the castle 
and offered him a single rose 
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold. 
Repulsed by her haggard appearance, 
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away. 
But she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances, 
for beauty is found within. 
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away 
to reveal a beautiful enchantress. 
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late, 
for she had seen
that there was no love in his heart. 
And as punishment, 
she transformed him
into a hideous beast 
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there. 
Ashamed of his monstrous form, 
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle 
with a magic mirror as his only window
to the outside world. 
The rose she had offered 
was truly an enchanted rose, 
which would bloom until his 21st year. 
If he could learn to love another 
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell, 
then the spell would be broken. 
If not, he would be doomed 
to remain a beast for all time. 
As the years passed, 
he fell into despair and lost all hope, 
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

Good morning.
I've come to return the book I borrowed.
Finished already?
I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?
Not since yesterday.
That's all right. I'll borrow this one.
That one? But you've read it twice.
Well, it's my favorite.
Faroff places, daring sword fights,
magic spells, a prince in disguise.
If you like it all that much, it's yours.
But, sir...
I insist.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

No beast alive
stands a chance against you.
And no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou.
And I've got my sights set on that one.
The inventor's daughter?
She's the one.
The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
But she...
The most beautiful girl in town.

Bonjour.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
Hello, Belle.
Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston, may I have my book, please?
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.
Well, some people
use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books
and paid attention
to more important things.
Like me.
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas
and thinking.
Gaston, you are positively primeval.
Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern
and take a look at my trophies?
Maybe some other time.
What's wrong with her?
She's crazy.
He's gorgeous.
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.
Goodbye.
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.
Don't talk about my father that way.
Yeah! Don't talk
about her father that way.
My father is not crazy. He's a genius.
Papa?
How on earth did that happen?
Doggone it!
Are you all right, Papa?
I'm... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.
You always say that.
I mean it this time!
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!
Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.
And become a worldfamous inventor.
You really believe that?
I always have.
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.
Hand me that...
The doglegged clincher there.
So, did you have a good time
in town today?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
Well, don't you worry.
'Cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
It works!
It does?
It does!
You did it.
You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.
We should be there by now.
Maybe we missed a turn.
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.
No. Let's go this way.
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
Oh!
Look out! No!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Back up, back up, back up!
Good boy. Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!
Steady, steady, now. Steady.
Steady. No, Philippe!
Philippe?
Oh.
Help! Is... Is someone there?
Help!
Oh!
Wha...
Ooh!
Hello?
Hello!
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.
Is someone there?
Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word.
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse
and I need a place to stay for the night.
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
Shh!
Ow!
Of course, monsieur, 
you are welcome here.
Who said that?
Over here.
Where?
Hello.
Incredible!
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.
Splendid. Just peachy. Ah!
How is this accomplished?
Put me down at once.
Stop that! Stop that, I say!
Ow! Ah! Ah!
Sir, close that at once!
Do you mind?
I beg your pardon.
It's... It's just
that I've never seen a clock that...
Oh, you are soaked
to the bone, monsieur. 
Come. Warm yourself by the fire.
Thank you.
No, no, no!
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.
I demand that you stop right there.
Oh, no, no. Not the master's chair.
I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this.
Well, hello there, boy.
What service.
All right.
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...
How would you like a nice spot of tea,
sir? It'll warm you up in no time.
No. No tea. No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama.
Oh!
Hello.
Uhoh!
There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so...
Master, I'd like to take this moment
to say
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I... I... I was lost in the woods and...
You are not welcome here!
I... I'm... I'm sorry.
What are you staring at?
Nothing.
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed a place to stay.
I'll give you a place to stay!
No, no, please! No! No!
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna
get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day.
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.
First, I better go in there
and propose to the girl.
And you, LeFou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...
I know. I know. I strike up the band!
Not yet.
Sorry.
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day...
This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty! Here. Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire
and my little wife massaging my feet
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.
We'll have six or seven.
Dogs?
No, Belle.
Strapping boys like me.
Imagine that.
Do you know who that little wife will be?
Let me think.
You, Belle.
Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless.
I really don't know what to say.
Say you'll marry me.
I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...
But I just don't deserve you!
Whoa!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife.
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy.
Is he gone?
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...

Philippe! What are you doing here?
Where's... Where's Papa?
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Papa!
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.
I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Papa? Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama. I saw her.
Not another word. Into the tub.
But... What?
A girl. I saw a girl in the castle.
See, I told you.
Irresponsible, devilmaycare,
waxyeared, slackjawed...
Papa?
Did you see that?
It's a girl!
I know it's a girl.
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.
She has come to break the spell.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Papa?
Papa?
Hello? Is someone here?
Wait! I'm looking for my father. I...
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
Is anyone here?
Belle?
Papa!
How did you find me?
Your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.
Belle, I want you to leave this place.
Who's done this to you?
No time to explain. You must go. Now!
I won't leave you.
What are you doing here?
Run, Belle!
Who's there? Who are you?
The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?
Then he shouldn't
have trespassed here!
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
There must be some way I can...
Wait!
Take me instead.
You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!
If I did, would you let him go?
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle! I won't let you do this!
You have my word.
Done.
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.
Wait.
Belle!
Wait.
No! Please spare my daughter. Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out. Please let me out!
Let me out! Please! Please!
Master?
What?
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
I didn't get to say goodbye.
I'll show you to your room.
My room? But I thought...
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower?
No.
Then follow me.
Say something to her.
Huh? Oh.
I hope you like it here.
The castle is your home now,
So you can go anywhere you like,
except the west wing.
What's in the west...
It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.
No one says no to Gaston.
Darn right.
Dismissed. Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.
Why, it's more than I can bear.
More beer?
What for? Nothing helps.
I'm disgraced.
Who, you? Never.
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

Who is it?
Mrs. Potts, dear.
I thought you might like a spot of tea.
But you're... You're a...
Oh!
Careful.
This is impossible.
I know it is, but here we are.
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.
Thank you.
Wanna see me do a trick?
Chip!
Oops! Sorry.
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.
We all think so.
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me jabbering on
while there's a supper
to get on the table.
Chip?
Bye.
Well, now,
what shall we dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers.
Oh, how embarrassing!
Ah, here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.
But you must.
Ahem, ahem, ahem.
Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?
Try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.
Master, have you thought
that perhaps this girl could be the one
to break the spell?
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.
Good! So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.
But the rose has already begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!
You must help her to see past all that.
I don't know how.
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.
Yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come, show me the smile.
But don't frighten the poor girl.
Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
Shower her with compliments.
But be sincere.
And above all,
you must control your temper!
You must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who?
Oh!
The girl, yes. The girl.
Well, actually, she's in the process of...
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.
What?
Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence!
Let's not be hasty!
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!
I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong,
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
Will you come down to dinner?
No!
Hmm?
Eheh.
Suave, genteel.
It would give me great pleasure
if you would join me for dinner.
And we say "please."
Please.
No, thank you.
You can't stay in there forever!
Yes, I can.
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch at the door
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me, mon capitaine. 
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she refuses.
What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad,
once you get to know him. 
Why don't you give him a chance? 
I don't want to get to know him. 
I don't want to have anything
to do with him. 
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me as anything
but a monster.
It's hopeless.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
I've been burned by you before.
Zut alors! She has emerged!
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.
After all, he did say "please."
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,
he'll never break the...
Splendid to see you
out and about, mademoiselle. 
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.
This is Lumiere.
Enchanté, chérie. 
If there's, stop that,
anything we, please,
can do to make your stay
more comfortable... Ow!
I am a little hungry.
You are?
Hear that? She's hungry.
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver. Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Oh, pish tosh. I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest.
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle. 
Well, keep it down.
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner
without a little music?
Music?
Ma chére mademoiselle! 
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure
that we welcome you tonight.

Bravo! That was wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle. 
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
My goodness, look at
the time. Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?
It was you, wasn't it?
I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.
Would you like a tour?
Wait a second. Wait a second.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,
if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me.
I'm sure you know everything there is
to know about the castle.
Oh, well. Actually, I...
Yes, I do.
As you can see,
the pseudofacade was stripped away
to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example
of the lateneoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...
Uh, mademoiselle? 
What's up there?
Where? There? Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest at all
in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so, that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what he's hiding up there.
Hiding?
The master is hiding nothing.
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
Perhaps mademoiselle 
would like to see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...
Maybe later.
The gardens.
Or... Or the... The library, perhaps?
You have a library?
Oh, yes. Indeed.
With books.
Scads of books.
Mountains of books.
Forests of books.
Cascades.
Cloudbursts.
Swamps of books.
More books than
you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever studied
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.
Oh, oh.
Why did you come here?
I'm... I'm sorry.
I warned you never to come here!
I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize
what you could have done?
Please! Stop!
Get out!
No!
Get out!
Where are you going?
Promise or no promise,
I can't stay here another minute.
No, wait, please! Please, wait!
No!
Here, now. Don't do that.
Just hold still.
That hurts!
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
Hmm?
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave
the asylum in the middle of the night,
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.
Ah!
I'm listening.
It's like this.
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle,
but she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat.
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So, you want me to throw her father
into the asylum,
unless she agrees to marry you.
That is despicable.
I love it.
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...
I'll get her out of there.
Belle! Maurice!
Oh, well.
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.
LeFou, don't move from that spot
until Belle and her father come home.
But... But I...
Ah, nuts.
I've never felt this way about anyone.
I want to do something for her.
But what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.
No, no.
It has to be something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.
Belle?
There's something I want to show you.
But first, you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
Can I open them?
No, no. Not yet.
Wait here.
Now can I open them?
All right. Now.
I can't believe it.
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.
You... You like it?
It's wonderful.
Then it's yours.
Thank you so much.
Would you look at that!
I knew it would work.
What? What works?
It's very encouraging.
Isn't this exciting?
I didn't see anything.
Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

Shh.
I'll tell you when you're older.
Tonight is the night.
I'm not sure I can do this.
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold. Daring.
There will be music,
romantic candlelight
provided by myself.
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.
Yes, I...
I... I... No, I can't.
You care for the girl, don't you?
More than anything.
Well, then, you must tell her.
Voila! Oh, you look so, so...
Stupid.
Not quite the word I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.
Your lady awaits.

Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love.
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see my father again,
just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way.
This mirror will show you anything.
Anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa. Oh, no.
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.
Then you must go to him.
What did you say?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean I'm free?
Yes.
Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.
Take it with you
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in you.
I let her go.
Yes, yes, splen...
You what?
How could you do that?
I had to.
Yes, but... But why?
Because I love her.
He did what?
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.
That's it then.
That should break the spell.
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
Papa?
Papa?
Ooh, ooh!
They're back.
Belle.
Shh.
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I missed you so much!
But the Beast...
Did you... How did you escape?
I didn't escape, Papa.
He... He let me go.
That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
Hi!
Oh! A stowaway.
Why, hello there,
little fella.
Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us anymore?
Chip, of course I do. It's just that...
May I help you?
I've come to collect your father.
My father?
Don't worry, mademoiselle. 
We'll take good care of him.
My father's not crazy!
He was raving like a lunatic!
We all heard him, didn't we?
Yes!
No, I won't let you!
Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was... I mean, he was...
He was enormous!
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
no, more like 10 feet!
Well, you don't get much crazier
than that.
It's true, I tell you.
Get him out of here!
Let go of me!
No! You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...
If what?
If you marry me.
What?
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.
Never!
Have it your way.
Belle? Let go of me!
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.
Show me the Beast.
Is it dangerous?
No, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.
He's my friend.
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!
She's as crazy as the old man.
The Beast will make off
with your children.
He'll come after them in the night.
No.
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!

No, you didn't. I told you.
You most certainly did not,
you pompous,

En garde, you overgrown pocket watch!
Take that.
Stop shoving.
Are they gonna live

Of course, my dear.
Of course.
