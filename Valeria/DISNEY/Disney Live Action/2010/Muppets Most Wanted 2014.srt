And cut!
Wow. That was so amazing!
Walter, you did a wonderful job.
Thank you, Kermit. Did we get that?
We got it.
We got it, yup.
Movie's over, people.
Go home. That is a wrap. 
Okay, nice work, everyone.
Make sure to fill out your I9s,
and we'll see you on the next one.
So... What do we do now?
Well, we're together again.
We got the theater
and all our fans are back.
Yeah!
Actually, those were extras.
I saw a few tapping their toes.
Yeah, those were paid dancers.
Or...
Maybe since we're all here,
now could be the perfect time for
you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!
Well, I mean, maybe I could.
Hey, what's the camera
still doing here?
Oh, no. Disaster! That
can only mean one thing.
Doggone it, you're right! It looks
like they've ordered a sequel.
We're doing a sequel 
We're back by popular demand 
Come on, everybody,
strike up the band! 
We're doing a sequel 
That's what we do in Hollywood 
And everybody knows 
That the sequel's
never quite as good 
A sequel
Another feature attraction 
Places, please
Light the lights 
Roll camera, "Action!" 
I thought it was the end 
But no, my friends, this is when 
We get to do it all again! 
Do it all again 
Until the credits roll 
We got another go to show them 
We can do it all again! 
We're doing a sequel
There's no need to disguise 
The studio considers us
a viable franchise 
We're doing a sequel
The studio wants more 
While they wait for Tom Hanks 
To make Toy Story 4! 
I thought it was the end 
But no, my friends, this is when 
We get to do it all again! 
Do it all again! 
Until the credits roll 
We've got another go to show them 
We can do it all again! 
We're doing a sequel 
Let's give it a go 
With Hollywood stars 
And more oneliner cameos 
We're doing a sequel 
I don't mean to be a stickler 
But this is the seventh sequel 
To our original motion picture 
We're doing a sequel 
Let's give it a shot 
All we need now is
a halfdecent plot 
Got it. An epic love story
between a very handsome,
longnosed purple thing
and a beautiful chicken.
Gonzo with the Wind. 
Does anybody have any other ideas?
It's about getting the
Muppets back together again
to stop an evil oil baron from
demolishing the old studio!
Fozzie, did you even
watch our last film?
It's about a frog who marries
a beautiful, perfect pig.
And they have to kiss
each other a lot!
I don't think Americans
Kermit, how about the
Muppets go on a world tour?
That's perfect!
I thought it was the end 
But no, my friends, this is when 
We get to do it all again! 
Until the credits roll 
We've got another go to show them 
We can do it all again! 
We're doing a sequel 
It's more of the same
Let's give it a name 
How about The Muppets Again? 
It's the Muppets again
with The Muppets Again 
It's the 
Muppets 
Again! 
Okay?
I'm okay!
Okay!
Boomabooma!
Hey! Pepperoni!
Come on!
Let's dance.
It's time to light the lights.
Muppet news flash. 
Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog, 
has escaped from
a maximum security gulag 
in Siberia, Russia. 
This move has
leapfrogged Constantine 
to the number one most wanted
criminal in the world, 
one place ahead
of the mysterious Lemur. 
Wow.
Thanks for seeing me at my
regular booth, Muppets.
Big fan. Huge.
Dominic. International
tour manager.
"Dominic Badguy"?
It's pronounced
"Badgee." It's French.
It means "good man."
Oh, yes.
Listen up.
You're hot. You're having a moment.
But what is inevitable
about a moment? It ends.
I don't want this moment to end!
That's why we got to
get out there now
and capitalize on this
moment with a capital yeah?
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.
Show a global audience
what you can do.
Yeah, that sounds great
but I'm just not sure...
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.
Okay, I am inundated with offers
of management at the moment.
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.
Wow, that's a good list!
And now, I wanna tour
manage you guys.
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.
We would share our managerial roles
because you've got a special
bond with these little guys.
Sure.
President Clinton?
What?
I'm on my way, Number Two.
Great, they're taking the bait.
Well, he seems like a nice guy.
Yeah.
Humble and honest.
I just... I think we have to
get settled first, you know?
Hone the show, get some new material,
and then maybe go on a world tour.
See you in Berlin.
Yes. Auf Wiedersehen,
Number Two.
So...
What's it gonna be, Muppets?
Ready to be world famous?
No pressure, but I
am a very busy man.
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.
World tour! World tour!
Well, I mean...
I guess we could always hone our acts
on the road, and that would be okay.
Wouldn't it, Kermit?
World tour! World tour!
Come on, froggy!
Okay, let's do it.
Dominic, you're hired.
Thanks, Kermit. I mean, boss.
You won't regret this.
Is everybody here? Yeah?
Okay, guys, guys. Get them
up and move them out.
All aboard, Dominic.
I didn't know there was
still third class.
Third class? How about no class?
Watch the heels!
Piggy. Why do you need
so much luggage?
For our honeymoon, of course!
For our what?
Let's go, guys!
That must be reverse.
Oh, well. This way looks good, too.
Okay, Dominic, I thought we could
start our world tour in London. 
Or how about the world
capital of comedy? 
Berlin, Germany. 
Germany! 
Was that supposed to happen?
You guys are gonna love this place. 
Okay, here we are, guys.
The Hole in the Wall Club!
"Die Muppets"?
Looks like they put
the reviews up early.
Yeah, or is that the
suggestion box?
"Hole in the Wall Club"?
More like "Hole in
the Ground Club."
Okay, everybody.
So, we'll start at the bottom
and work our way up.
I've booked us into cabaret
bars and coffee houses
all across the industrial
cities of Northern Germany.
Dusseldorf, Hamburg,
Mudburg, Vomitdorf.
Poopenburgen?
Fozzie, we have a solid week
booked in Poopenburgen.
This looks great.
And I think we should commend
Kermit on his efforts.
Thank you, Dominic. Thanks.
Or, if I might be so bold,
maybe we could consider
another venue.
Another venue?
To be precise, this other venue.
Look at that theater!
What? No, no.
We don't have the money to rent
the Berlin National Theatre!
We'll make our money back
when we sell it out.
Kermie, I've always dreamed of
playing the Berlin National Theatre.
"Ich bin ein Berliner." 
More like, "Ein frankfurter"!
Watch it, buster.
Guys, I'm not sure
we can do this, you know?
Okay, let's put this to the vote.
All those in favor
of believing in ourselves,
raise your hands.
That's not what I'm saying.
And all those in favor
of just giving up.
I can't believe I'm
voting for giving up.
Good. Well, I'm glad
we made this decision.
Wonderful!
So cool!
Isn't that exciting.
I can't believe it.
All right, gather round,
troops. Everybody?
Okay, guys.
Since we're playing such a big theater,
let's stick with what we know.
We'll open with a cabaret number...
Kermit, when do I do the
indoor running of the bulls?
Mr. Kermit, sir?
I would very much like to demonstrate
my magnetic bombattractor vest.
Bunsen, why would you even
invent one of those?
Why did I invent the
unexpectedly exploding cupcake?
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?
Muppet Ladder? That's
never, ever worked, Gonzo.
Last time we all tried that
was 20 years ago
and you ended up
in a cast for six months.
Yeah, good times.
Kermit, what if I do four
or five Celine Dion songs?
You know Celine Dion,
she works in Vegas.
No, Piggy, there's
no time for that.
What about the band's
marathon jam session?
Drum solo! Drum solo!
No drum solo!
Guys, guys, guys!
We can't just do whatever we want.
This is our opening night.
Let's play to our
strengths, because...
Well...
Look, I didn't want
to worry you guys
but if we don't sell this theater out,
it would mean the end of the tour.
What?
And maybe the end of us.
Great news, Muppets.
We're sold out.
What?
Fine.
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.
Hey, I have an amazing
idea for an act.
It's called "The Indoor
Running of the Bulls."
Gonzo, I've told you, that
act is far too dangerous.
Actually, Kermit, I was asking
Dominic what he thinks.
Good grief.
Dominic, Dominic! Five songs.
"Sold out." Like we've
sold out a show in 30 years.
Is this a good time to discuss
our upcoming European wedding?
No, actually, I'm kind
of busy right now.
Perfect!
I have 23 swatches for the
seat covers for the reception,
eight font choices for the menu,
which, by the way,
we are not serving flies.
Piggy, what are you talking about?
I'm just trying to involve you in
some of the decisionmaking, dear.
What about being involved
in the decision
to get married in the
first place, huh?
Kermit, you never let
me do what I want!
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about what I want?
What about that?
I haven't even proposed yet.
You can do that on our honeymoon.
What?
That's insane! Do you hear
what you're saying?
Insane? How dare you call
your fiancée insane?
You are not my fiancée!
We are not engaged!
And, as a matter of fact,
the way this particular conversation
is going right now... Well...
I'm fine with that!
Piggy. Wait! I'm sorry!
Get out!
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.
They just prefer me now.
Thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.
Do you know what I think helps
sometimes in situations like this?
What?
A walk alone in the fog
in former East Berlin.
Maybe along a deserted canal.
Well, I guess a quiet stroll
is not a bad idea.
Let the others know
I've gone, will you?
Sure. I promise.
Thanks.
Corrine, come here!
Boo.
What just happened?
What?
Wait a second.
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Silence, Constantine.
The game is up.
Who?
No, no! Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Guys, this is a mistake!
I'm telling you!
Hey, hey! Hello! Somebody!
Open up!
I'm an AmphibianAmerican!
It's not easy being mean.
Has anyone seen Kermit?
It's 15 minutes to curtain.
Hi, guys. Look, it's Kermit, just
back from his afternoon stroll.
Hilo! I am Kermit.
What...
He's got a cold.
That's why his voice
sounds a little bit
different at the moment.
See? Just calm down. Just relax.
You are right. Dominic is terrific!
From now on, let's
do whatever he says.
All right. Yeah.
Wow, that walk
must have really helped.
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.
I humbly beg your forgiveness.
You're not getting off
that easy, bucko.
Come on, Foo Foo.
Bad frog! Bad frog!
What is this? Let go, dog!
Animal, stop it!
Kermit has agreed that Dominic
is right all the time, man.
Good.
So, now that Kermit agrees
with me on everything...
I am Kermit.
Definitely.
Let's go and hang out
backstage, yeah?
Okay, all right.
Come, little friend.
Let us get on with the show and
enjoy our familystyle adventure
during which we shall bond and
learn heartwarming lesson.
Perhaps about sharing,
or waiting your turn,
or the number three.
Right, Kermit.
Sure.
Flawlessly executed. Bravo.
What did you expect from
world's most dangerous frog
and number one criminal,
Number Two?
Yeah, I know. You're number
one, I'm number two.
I think you mentioned that before.
Now that we control
the Muppet tour, Number Two,
phase one of our plan is complete.
We are now positioned
to carry out greatest...
"Burglary."
Yes.
of all time, and pin it
on those gullible Muppets,
who will spend the rest of their
miserable lives behind bars.
Tonight,
we steal the painting
and then we'll have all we need
to steal the unstealable,
the Crown Jewels of England.
Ensuring that my name
goes down in history
as greatest thief of all time!
You mean our names, right?
Of course.
My name first, then spacebar,
spacebar, spacebar, your name.
Sure.
I'm number one
You're number two 
We're criminals at large
But I'm at larger than you 
I'm number one 
You're number two 
I believe in equality 
As long as you get less than me 
I'm one
You're one 
You're number two 
I'm number two.
You may think that you're smarter 
But I'm smarterer than you 
I'm number one
You're number two 
You're lucky to be number two 
Not number three 
I can see by the look in your eye 
You want to get a bigger
piece of the pie 
One day you'll get your chance 
But in the meantime 
You've got to dance, monkey, dance! 
Really? I hate dancing.
Do it!
Dance, monkey, dance! 
I'm number two
He's number one 
I can't believe I'm
working for an amphibian 
I'm number two
He's number one 
I'm number one!
You know life's gone to the dogs 
When your boss is a frog 
I can see it's just
a matter of time 
Before he's gone 
And I'm at the front of the line 
It won't be long
till I get my chance 
But in the meantime 
I've got to dance, monkey, dance 
Dance, monkey, dance 
Now, watch me.
I'm number one
He's number one 
You're number two
I'm number two 
That's it, kid
There you go 
Now step aside
This ain't your show 
I'm one
"I'm one" 
I'm number one 
Yes, we know 
I'm...
He's... 
Number one! 
That's how it's done.
15 seconds to curtain... Kermit?
Sure.
Okay.
Have you studied
your Kermit tapes yet?
Of course not. This is child's
play for frog of my talent.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome... 
"Study Kermit tapes." Nonsense.
It's...
Oh, no.
Kermit! Introduce the show.
It's the Muppet Show!
With our very special guest
star, Christoph Waltz!
What is happening? Why am I flying?
What the...
We gotta do something!
Please welcome our first act,
Herr Christoph Waltz
dances the waltz!
Darling, you set my world on fire.
Did somebody say "explosion"?
No! He says I set
his world on fire.
There it is again!
Wait for me! Please! Wait for me.
One more!
Keep Waltzing, Mr. Waltz!
Hey!
It was vertigo.
Not stage fright, if that's what
you're thinking, Number Two.
Sure.
Right, now to cover our tracks.
Let's get out of here!
CIA.
Interpol!
What is the CIA doing here?
This is my jurisdiction.
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.
One of the stolen
paintings was on loan
from the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.
Also, this is my travel badge.
Here's my real badge.
You must have been
looking at the wrong...
Badge!
What?
You've won this round, Pierre.
My name is "Jean."
Okay, Shawn.
It looks like we're gonna
be working together.
But that doesn't mean
I have to like you.
I didn't like you first.
I didn't like you before I met you.
So, what have we got?
Two priceless paintings stolen
and one average painting of
an obscure English colonel.
This has all the markings
of the work of the Lemur.
What's a lemur?
Only the second most wanted
criminal in the world.
And my personal nemesis.
Unfortunately for me,
his identity is a mystery.
No, literally, what is a lemur?
It is also a ratmonkey
from Madagascar.
Just as I suspected.
This coin is his calling card.
The Lemur, he is playing with us.
I have a delivery
here for Mr. Eagle.
Right here.
And here's your rope.
You were saying?
Look at that.
"Muppets sell out in
Berlin." Five stars!
Kermit the Frog is
liking this news.
Choochoo, yeah!
Tunnel.
It's not there.
You were wrong!
Not so fast.
Oldest trick in the book.
Write it in lemon juice,
then simply apply heat
to reveal Colonel Blood's map.
Of course, today,
the Crown Jewels lie behind
the most sophisticated
security system on the planet.
And this map, along with
Blood's key and locket,
is the only way to
get close to them.
Good work, Number Two.
What does it say about
location of Blood's key?
Right.
Something, something.
"Finest wooden teeth."
That is not helpful.
Wait.
There's the name of a city here.
Madrid.
You've got the wrong frog!
Hey, hey, hey!
It's Constantine.
What?
He's back.
What are you doing?
I'm not Constantine.
My name is Kermit.
Constantine, always with the jokes!
Good old Constantine. Always
trying to pull a fast one.
Old friend.
Since you are back,
I guess you are in charge
of prison again.
Here, take prison crown.
We have to readjust it again.
Sergei, you get on that.
Take, take.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
I've known Constantine for years.
And he has never...
Ever...
Said, "Thank you."
Because I am not Constantine.
How dare you?
He's not Constantine!
Let's throw him
in the recycling compacter!
Yeah!
Throw him in the compacter!
But I'm already green!
Squash that frog!
Put the frog down.
Or I will deploy.
Where am I?
The Gulag.
A gulag?
Gulag. The Big House.
The Big House!
Hit it, boys.
This is Russia's premier
statefunded hotel 
We're very proud
of our eclectic clientele 
Excellence in service since 1932 
Don't believe what you read
in the online reviews 
It's the Big House
The perfect getaway 
Welcome into the Big House 
You'll never get away 
It's no Hilton or no Hyatt
But you will have a riot 
So please enjoy your stay 
Here's the dining room
The menu is minimal 
What the cook does
to the food is criminal 
Pull up a seat, frog 
Grab yourself a stool 
May I recommend 
You try our famous gruel? 
In the Big House 
You'll never be alone 
Life ain't bad in the Big House 
No, froggy, no 
Check out after 10 
Or 11 years 
Make yourself at home 
Accommodation here is far superior 
Than anything else 
You Will find in Siberia 
Let me know if
there's anything you need 
Everything is free 
Money back, guaranteed 
In the Big House 
You will not survive 
When you arrive in the Big House 
Run for your life 
Two, three, four 
It's the Big House
The perfect getaway 
Welcome into the Big House 
You'll never get away 
For your security 
I'll keep the only key 
Now, please enjoy your stay 
Listen, I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong frog!
If you are not Constantine,
why do you have that mole?
It's not real. Someone
glued it to my lip.
As far as authorities are
concerned, you are Constantine.
Glue or no glue.
Make yourself comfortable.
You're going to be here a while.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My friends will be here soon!
Now, lights out!
Turn them back on!
I can't see anything.
You have to wait until I'm,
like, out of the hallway.
It's figure of speech.
Okay.
It seems that Blood's key
is hidden in a marble bust
of his accomplice,
Godfrey the Unknown,
which is kept in the Statue
Room at the Prado Museum.
Perfect.
We break in, steal the bust,
destroy it and grab key.
Yeah, it's not that simple.
You see, no one knows
what Godfrey the
Unknown looked like.
Of course not. He was second
in command, so no one cared.
And there's 250
statues in that room.
That may be problem.
Let me think, Number Two.
Excusezmoi , Kermie.
Do you have a moment?
Kermit.
I just wanted to say
that I accept your apology
and I'm ready to put
our little disagreement
or whatever it was, behind us.
And, perhaps, I was a little
too eager about our wedding...
Pig, I have question.
Am I wearing sign
that says "Bother Me"?
What was that? What was that?
I was in the middle
of evilly plotting.
I do not like to be interrupted
while evilly plotting.
If we're to get away with this,
you've got to keep up appearances.
I am keeping up appearances.
If you want the Crown
Jewels, stick to the plan.
Do whatever the pig wants. Keep her
happy. Whatever she asks of you.
Stupid frog!
Stupid train!
I don't want to talk
to you, Kermit.
I said, I want you out!
I don't think you
know what you want.
Yeah, I do. I just told you, I...
You're my lady
and I'm your man, baby.
And that's why,
if you stick with me,
I can give you what you want.
Baby, stop right there 
Let me clear the air 
Baby, look into these eyes
Let me apologize 
I know what you're thinking of 
You're thinking,
"Where's the love?" 
Babe, the love ain't gone
It's here where it belongs 
I know what you're waiting for 
Well, you don't need
to wait no more 
I can give you anything you want 
Give you anything you need 
I'll make your dreams come true 
Give you anything you want 
Fulfill your fantasies 
I'll make your dreams come true 
You want a unicorn
I'll give it to you 
You want a puppy dog
I'll give it to you 
You want an ice cream cone
I'll give it to you 
You want a mortgage loan
I'll give it to you 
You want a satin pillow
I'll give it to you 
You want an armadillo
I'll give it to you 
You want a diamond ring
I'll give it to you 
You want a thingything
I'll give it to you 
I know what you're waiting for 
Well, you don't need
to wait no more 
I can give you anything you want 
Give you anything you need 
I'll make your dreams come true 
Give you anything you want
Fulfill your fantasies 
I'll make your dreams come true 
I'm singing
Cockatoo

I'll give it to you 
I'll make your dreams come true 
Cockatoo
Cockatoo 
Kangaroo
Kangaroo 
In Malibu 
I'll make your dreams come true 
Kermie.
You are what I've always wanted.
Excuse us.
But we are all wondering, what's
the set list for tomorrow, chief?
I don't care. Do whatever you want.
What?
Is he serious?
Kermit, could I do
indoor running of the bulls?
Sure, Zongo. Who cares?
Wow! Thank you, Kermit!
Kermie, if he can do his thing,
why can't I sing my five songs?
Well...
You can. Who cares?
We don't have time
for all this stuff.
We're up to a threehour
show, Kermit.
You are forgetting one thing,
small man with glasses.
I can give you what you want.
All right!
Okay. Indoor running the bulls.
Won't the show be terrible? Guys?
I'm so confused.
Where are you guys?
Looks like I'm gonna have to
break out of here myself.
It's The Muppet Show,
with our very special
guest star, Lynn Redgrave. 
Yes!
Hiho! Kermit the Frog, here. 
Hilo.
Kermit the Frog here.
The lovers, the dreamers and me 
The lovers, the dreamers and cheese 
Nailed it.
It's El Muppet Show ,
with our very special guest,
Salma Hayek.
Hey!
Would you look at that?
No.
Good idea.
Yes! Hello and welcome
to El Muppet Show .
Please welcome our opening
act, the Great Gonzo
and the indoor running
of the bulls!
Gonzo? Gonzo, I don't
want to do this.
What? This is gonna be great.
Are you sure about this?
Nope. Come on. Let's go.
Where have you been?
On stage.
Why did the...
The bulls are out of control!
Who could have foreseen this?
Me. I did.
Here they come again!
Okay. Sorry about that, folks,
but now put your hands
together for Miss Piggy.
I don't believe it.
They've managed the impossible.
What an achievement!
Bravo! Bravo!
What? You mean you actually
like this show now?
No! They've made the show
even worse!
Bravo! Bravo!
Amazing!
Where is it?
It's got to be here somewhere.
Keep smashing, Number Two.
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm smashing.
Where is that key?
The last one. It better be in here.
He looks a little bit
like you, Number Two.
Colonel Blood's key.
Nice of him to label it.
So, where is the locket?
There's more.
Of course. That's where
Blood's locket is.
In the vaults of the
Irish National Bank.
Then I know where Muppet
tour must stop next. Dublin.
Drum solo!
A standing ovation?
I am Kermit.
I hope you enjoyed my show.
I love you, Madrid!
Wow, what an audience!
Great show, Kermit!
They loved me, Kermie!
They loved me!
Guys?
I'm not sure that was
such a great show.
Like, what are you talking about?
That jam was, like, totally epic.
Exactly.
And I'm glad to say
the Spanish reviewers
disagree with you as well, Walter.
They loved us.
Five out of five jamón serranos. 
Those reviews really came out fast.
And Citizen Kane only got
four jamón serranos. 
And more good news.
Pack up, everyone. I've booked
our next gig. In Dublin.
Oh, great! Now we all
have time to rehearse.
Rehearse? Let's celebrate.
Yeah!
Yes! You deserve it, comrades!
Go do whatever you want.
Looks like we are busted.
Exactly what are we doing today?
I am doing my job.
All we need to do is look at the map
with the blinky lights, and wait.
This is how it is
done here in Europe.
In America, we use 3D
satellite LED displays.
Not cardboard with Christmas
lights stuck through it.
A blinky light!
She is blinking! Let's go.
What is this? A toy?
This is my car, Le Maximum.
It is illegal now in most of
the EU for its massive size.
It's so needlessly
spacious, I feel guilty.
I hate Europe.
Madrid, here we come! 
Get out of the way.
Stay on the road!
Interpol!
Watch out, everyone!
37 hours. Not bad.
The Lemur. I knew it.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why break in,
smash some priceless busts
and then not steal anything?
There must be something
bigger going on.
But what?
I've got it!
Sorry. 2:00 PM. My day is over.
Wait. Those weirdos, the Muppets,
were performing next to the
crime scene in Berlin.
And here they are,
performing right next to
the crime scene in Madrid!
You know what that means.
Yes, they love museums!
No!
They're suspects!
Okay. Overtime.
We must find these Muppets
before they flee the country.
To the train station!
Hey, Larry, want a
bite of my bocadillos?
What the...
Are you all Les Muppets? 
Wow, those are big badges!
Thank you.
Come, come. You must come with
us to answer some questions.
Kermit, let's begin
Describe the day you played Berlin 
We rehearsed,
and then we walked about 
We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut 
That night at 10:03 
Were you inside the
portrait gallery? 
My alibi is watertight 
The audience saw me sing all night 
Monsieur, we know you did the crime 
I was on stage that whole time 
Ask who sang Rainbow Connection 
Thank you, Kermit,
no more questions 
I think it's time for
good cop/romantic cop.
Miss Piggy, you could
end up locked inside 
And now's your chance
to save your hide 
Gentlemen, I did not know 
It's a crime to steal the show 
Tell us how the art was taken 
If you want to save your bacon 
I haven't seen your missing art 
All I've stolen is audience hearts 
We'll catch the swine 
That did this job 
Give up the pig puns, creep! 
Go jump in a lake,
that's my suggestion 
Thank you, Piggy, no more questions 
I think she likes me. Huh?
I don't think your puns are
helping the investigation.
You know, I think they did it
No, they didn't 
Yes, they did and we can pin it 
If they did how did they do it? 
If they didn't how did they didn't? 
If they didn't then it's easy
'cause they simply didn't do it 
If they did it, then I knew it but
we've nothing that can prove it 
Excuse me.
Let's go from the start 
What do you know
about the stolen art? 
I didn't know there was a plan 
Your accusation's far out, man 
The chances of us committing
a crime are less than .009 
I can do an Elvis impression 
Thank you, Muppets
No more questions 
They didn't
No, they didn't 
There's no way they did the crime 
They couldn't, they're too stupid
Not criminal masterminds 
We do not know who did it
But we know who didn't do it 
So we know who didn't do it 
Yes, we know who didn't do it 
They're incapable
of being culpable!
Hi!
Come on. Let's go
over the files again.
Stop digging escape tunnel, frog.
How did you know?
It's the first escape
everyone tries.
That's the second
escape people try.
Oh, boy.
Third way!
Give up, frog.
I have Netflix account
with search keywords
"prison escape."
I have seen every
prison movie ever made.
Even the ones in space.
Yeah, well... Hey, wait a second.
That's them! That's my friends!
What happened to them?
"Dominic Badguy.
"An interview with
the brains behind
"the Muppets' triumphant
comeback world tour."
What?
It seems your friends
do not need you anymore.
They have forgotten about you.
No, no, no.
They wouldn't.
They couldn't.
We're a family.
"Family"?
No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog.
People are only
ever out for themselves.
Listen, Kermit.
We have annual lighthearted
Gulag Revue coming up.
It is that, or they riot.
I thought you might help me.
The thing is, Nadya,
I'm sort of done doing that,
but thanks for the offer.
This is not offer. This is prison.
You are going to help me.
Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM.
Or I put you on The Wall.
"The Wall"?
Why would I be afraid of a wall?
Just direct the show.
You'll never escape.
What time did you say
that rehearsal was?
Okay. What about
this comedian bear?
He is too stupid to be stupid.
He must be some sort of genius.
Maybe your "Lemur"
hunch is correct.
Except for the fact
that Les Muppets 
play tomorrow night
at the Dublin Theatre.
Which just happens to be next
door to the Irish National Bank!
Maybe your Muppet hunch is...
Correct.
It's almost as if we're...
Not so different
after
all.
Come, come, mon ami! 
We must follow Les
Muppets to Dublin!
To Dublin!
Kremlin!
Putin!
No, what are you doing?
Okay, number five, baby. Blow.
Come on.
There you go. You know the routine.
Come on, Diddy Daddy!
Hey, guys? Fellas?
Whoa, man!
Hey, did you see that?
Do you guys think that Kermit's
been acting a little weird lately?
No.
You're probably right.
It's just me.
Bad frog.
Enough!
You're all terrible.
Fix this. Or it's The Wall.
Of course.
Guys...
It's always good to start with
an uptempo song and dance
and then go into a comedy routine.
But we like Boyz II Men!
It is Big Papa's favorite song. Lot
of emotions in that song for him.
I'm not learning no other song.
I'm a triple threat!
A singer, a dancer and a murderer!
There you go. How do you like that?
Drum solo! Drum solo!
When do I do the indoor
running of the bulls?
What about the band's
marathon jam session?
Four or five musical numbers.
Quiet!
Now, look! We are holding
auditions tomorrow.
And if any of you
have a problem with that,
any of you,
then my door is always open!
Thank you, Kermit.
This is what we've all
been waiting to hear.
Teach us, Kermit.
We will do whatever frog say.
Put it there.
Good night, frog. Nice work today.
Thanks, Nadya.
Even if your friends don't
need you, we certainly do.
Good night.
Good night, Big Papa.
'Night, Nadya.
Good night, Carl.
Good night, Nadya.
Good night, Prison King.
Good night, Nadya.
Good night, Skullcrusher.
Good night.
Good night, Danny Trejo.
Good night, Nadya.
No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog. 
People are only
ever out for themselves. 
Well, well, well.
What's he up to?
Gentlemen.
I need this review
to go into Friday's paper.
Super positive. Five stars.
I won't be paid off for a review.
I'm a journalist.
I'm joking, of course.
Cash or credit?
What was that?
Rats.
Who cares?
Hand these tickets out to
anyone who will take one.
In fact, you may have to
actually pay people to come.
It's the Muppets.
It's not gonna be easy.
And I want a standing ovation.
Oh, dear.
Where does he keep
all those suitcases?
Let's see here.
What's Kermit doing on the
cover of this newspaper?
Dominic's the bad guy!
Dominic's the bad guy!
Fozzie!
Dominic's the reason we've
been selling out our shows!
He's been giving away tickets
and bribing journalists
to write great reviews!
Why didn't we ever
think of doing that?
I mean, that's terrible!
The question is, why?
And could it have
anything to do with
why Kermit's been
acting so weird lately?
Hey, wanna see something funny?
Yes, Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog.
Fozzie, what does he have to
do with what I just told you?
Nothing, but check this out.
Look, it's Kermit.
What did you do with Kermit?
Wait a minute.
Fozzie...
What if Kermit has been replaced
by this Constantine guy?
Nah, that's impossible.
We'd all notice!
Wouldn't we?
Kermit?
Are you there?
Hello?
Kermit?
Everything's fine.
Let's get out of here.
Wait!
We should look around.
Kermit's got a big bomb collection.
Looks like he's planning some
sort of comedy heist bit.
I hope not. Those never work.
What's that?
Oh, no.
What, what, What? What?
Oh, no.
We got to get out of here!
Yeah!
Not so fast.
Where's Kermit?
What do you want?
You have wockaed
your last wocka, bear.
Bad frog!
Animal!
Oh, good boy!
Great job!
Thank you.
Quick! The freight train!
Go, go, go!
We got to go back! Warn the others!
I tried. They didn't believe me.
It's our word against his and,
well, he's fooled them all.
Should we go to the police?
We don't have any evidence!
I feel terrible.
I'm the one who talked Kermit into
doing this tour in the first place.
I wish Kermit was here!
He would know what to do.
You're right.
There's only one guy in
this world who can save us.
Only one frog who
can restore order,
bring justice,
and set things right!
You are talking about
Kermit, right?
Yes, Fozzie. Kermit.
Good!
Great!
That's it, guys, that's it!
That's good, guys! Come on!
And hit it hard!
Okay. All right. Yes.
Nadya?
I think perhaps we should,
perhaps, keep it prisoners only.
Of course. I just love Broadway.
But you are right, Kermit, as ever.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay, fellas, listen up.
Here's who made the cut.
Sergei! King! That's you.
You are always right, my
beautiful amphibian prince.
I will never let you go.
This is better.
What's wrong? You only ever
knit when you're stressed.
The bear,
the little guy and their
dog, they are onto us.
They got away.
How are we gonna spin this?
Comrades, I'm afraid
I have bad news.
Walter and Fonzie
have quit the Muppets.
Wait.
You can quit the Muppets?
Wait a second.
Walter quit the Muppets?
We just did a whole movie
where he joined the Muppets.
Yeah, we sure spent a
lot of time on it.
I'll say.
Maybe even at the expense of other
longstanding, beloved Muppets.
Come on, Robin.
Coming.
Well, as the old saying goes...
The show must continue,
in a timely fashion.
Wait.
Fozzie and Walter are
part of our family.
We can't let them
go without a fight.
Right, Kermit?
I know this is hard, Gonzo.
Walter and Fonzie
were my best friends.
Kermit...
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm fine, pig.
I could never lose you.
You complete me.
Kermie.
Guys, come on!
This is gonna be fantastic.
We should be celebrating!
Yes. Remember, I can
give you what you want.
Yeah?
Yeah, right.
I'll keep that in mind.
Say, has anyone seen Animal?
Does anybody else feel like
we're traveling in circles?
There it is!
Finally!
Do you have evidence
to frame the bear?
Excellent.
Where are the guards?
Stay here. I'm going
to check on the vault.
Stop it!
Colonel Blood's locket.
Of course. Now grab it.
Shawn.
Someone's coming. Abort!
I think I just saw something. It's
headed back towards the theater!
That was close.
Too close.
We need to move to
final phase three. "Wedding."
Hey, Kermit, you can't go out there.
It's Piggy's Celine Dion number.
Did you see anything?
Not a thing. It is my lunch hour.
It lasts six hours.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I have an announcement!
What?
Kermit,
I'm in the middle of a song here!
Miss Piggy.
I have very important
question for you.
Yeah? What are you doing?
Do you wish to become Mrs. Piggy?
Or rather, Mrs. The Frog?
Kermie, I thought you'd never ask.
I really thought you'd never ask!
So?
What do you say?
It's beautiful.
Yes! Yes! Of course! Yes!
I can't believe this!
After all this time,
it was finally just so easy!
That's right, folks,
it's the Muppet wedding
the world has been waiting for.
We're putting our tour on hold...
What?
to be married in two days' time
at the world's most
romantic location,
the Tower of London.
Here's a Muppet newsflash. 
The years of waiting are over. 
The biggest "Will they,
won't they?" of all times 
has been answered
with a firm, "They will. " 
Kermit the Frog and Miss
Piggy are to be married! 
That's right, folks. They're
finally tying the knot. 
Well, at least they didn't
get the pot of gold.
No, they did not.
I have never been to a more
ridiculous crime scene.
The comedian bear, he was here.
The Lemur. He, too, was here.
Could the comedian bear and the
Lemur be one and the same?
The comedian bear is the Lemur.
That is brilliant.
But why would he steal
a bunch of old bones?
The bones apparently belonged
to one Colonel Thomas Blood.
He was the only man to ever nearly
steal the Crown Jewels of England.
Wait! Where did the frog say
he was getting married?
The Tower of London.
The comedian bear
is planning on stealing...
The Tower of London!
The Crown Jewels!
The Crown Jewels.
Sir, where would you
like the flowers?
Who cares?
Hey, chief.
Hilo.
We've all been thinking, and...
Well, after you and
Miss Piggy get married,
what's gonna happen to the tour?
And to us?
Well, now you guys have
all the freedom you want.
You don't need me.
I'm done with Muppets.
But, hey, it's been
a good run, right?
Good luck.
Kermit!
Did he just say what
I thought he said?
What are we gonna
do without Kermit?
The only thing we can do.
Pack up, go to the wedding,
and head back home.
Foo Foo, it's always been a fight.
But this is so easy,
it just doesn't feel right.
This is my dream come true 
The day has come for
us to say "I do" 
There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Nothing in the world means
more to me than you 
I've waited so patiently 
I knew you were the
only frog for me 
Always knew this day would come 
It's written in the stars
It's destiny 
So how can something so right 
Feel so wrong tonight? 
After all we've been through 
Why do I feel I don't know you? 
We'll settle down
and start a family 
Have a mini you and a mini me 
A little pink frog and
a little green piggy 
They'll learn to say hello
and say goodbye 
We'll grow gray and old 
And live the quiet life 
Just you and I 
Hand in hand we'll stay together 
Hey. Look at that sky.
Forever and ever 
So how can something so right 
Feel so wrong tonight? 
After all we've been through 
Why do I feel I don't know you? 
How can something so right
feel so wrong inside? 
How can something so good
leave me feeling so bad? 
How can my dreams coming true 
Leave me lonely and blue? 
How come the happiest day
of my life is so sad? 
How can I feel the high
when I feel so low? 
After all we've been through
After coming so far 
Is this my destiny? 
Where is the love that's written 
In the stars? 
How can something so right 
Feel so wrong tonight? 
After all we've been through 
Why do I feel I don't 
Know you? 
Oh, Kermie.
Hey, the show's starting.
Yeah!
Lady and gentlemen,
good evening and welcome to
the Gulag Annual Revue Show!
Escapo, you're up after the ballet.
Okay.
Kermit! Kermit!
Kermit.
Fozzie. Walter. Animal.
We're here to rescue you.
Yes! And we've got to go right now!
Yeah!
Hey!
I can't believe you're here.
It's so good to see you guys!
Kermit, listen.
An evil frog named Constantine
has taken over the Muppets
and replaced you!
What? Constantine replaced me?
Yeah.
And he was working
together with Dominic.
They're planning something
terrible, but we don't know what.
But...
How could you not have noticed
that he'd replaced me, Fozzie?
He looked like you
and he talked like you.
Okay, he didn't talk that much
like you, come to think of it.
But he said he had a cold.
Animal know.
"Animal know"?
You mean, all this time, I've
been locked in a Russian gulag,
no one, not one single person
from the Muppets except Animal
noticed I'd been replaced by
an evil criminal mastermind?
It sounds worse than it was.
No. It's as bad as it sounds.
I thought you guys
had forgotten about me.
That you didn't need me anymore.
We'd never forget about you.
We need you more than ever, Kermit.
Good frog.
Late extra! Late extra!
Read all about it!
Kermit and Miss Piggy
to be married in London!
What?
Piggy?
Piggy's gonna marry the world's
most dangerous frog tomorrow?
Piggy and the gang are in danger!
To London!
No. Kermit!
Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'm in a gulag.
Sorry about that, Ivan!
It's okay!
No problem, Kermit.
It's easy mistake.
Right. Thanks for not shooting me!
Sure. No problem...
Hey, nothing personal.
We have to escape, guys. Tonight!
But how?
Kermit.
Do you know where these prop
pickaxes and shovels
are supposed to go
for this big mining number?
Wait!
I've got it!
And now, folks, the Great Escapo!
Oh, no, you don't.
Nice try, Escapo.
I sure hope this works, Walter.
I have tried a lot of ways
to get out of here.
This is gonna work, Kermit.
I'll see you on the outside.
Okay!
Gosh, I hope this works.
Thank you, thank you,
everybody. And now,
we're going underground.
Working in the coal mine!
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!
Oh, no.
Kermie!
I can't believe that worked!
We did it! Great work, guys!
Now put the pedal to the metal.
We have a wedding to crash!
Yeah!
That's a nice venue.
The main entrance is
too wellguarded.
I'm gonna need to get in
some other way.
Here you go.
You're the new guy?
Yes, I am.
Next time, wear a uniform.
Right.
Wow, Kermit, you were like
James Bond back there.
Thanks, Fozzie. Okay, listen, guys.
Walter, you and Animal
go look in the chapel.
Right.
Fozzie, come with me.
Yes, sir.
Good luck, guys.
You, too, Kermit.
Piggy?
Where is she?
Kermit, these are your clothes.
This tuxedo is too tight.
Someone's coming! Hide! Hide!
Which room am I supposed to be in?
Here it is.
I hate weddings.
What the...
There you are.
Well, don't just stand there
gawping, Number Two.
Come in.
Let us take this convenient
opportunity to review our plans.
Once you've stolen the Crown
Jewels and framed the Muppets,
ring the tower bell five times and
we will rendezvous on the roof.
But what will you do
when you're married?
Because the pig will
know everything.
Once she's served her
purpose, kaboom.
It will be bacon for breakfast.
Champagne fridge delivery.
Put it over there on
the bearskin rug.
Thank you!
It's show time.
Fozzie, are you okay?
Yeah, I think so. How do I look?
You look fine. You look fine.
Come on, we have to
go rescue Miss Piggy!
Right! Let's go!
The Lemur! I have you finally!
And Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog!
No, no, no.
As you might say, case solved!
Perfect! Time for my annual
eightweek paid vacation.
No, wait!
What am I supposed to do with them
until the mobile holding unit arrives?
On holiday!
No, you've got the wrong frog.
And stay there!
And so you know, Number Two,
I have hired us help.
The world's smallest team
of jewel thieves.
Babies, meet your new boss.
Genius, I know! Who would suspect
babies of stealing Crown Jewels?
Look at their sweet faces.
Let's see. Where am I seated?
I'll need an usher.
Usher? Is there an usher?
Yes. I'm the Usher.
Pig or frog?
What do you think?
I don't know, man. Pig?
No. Frog. I'm related
through marriage.
What kind of an usher are you?
You're up, little dudes.
Go, go, go.
Down.
Tip.
Come on! What the...
Dominic. Hey, Dominic.
Shut up.
The wedding, it's starting.
She looks beautiful.
Fozzie, we got to do something.
This is so frustrating!
Wow, would you look at that?
Now that's a poorly made car.
Let's get out of here!
I'm just happy for them.
Really happy for them.
Would you please stop talking?
Okay.
Dearly beloved...
What! Code Red! Code Red!
Oh, come on.
Not a laser web.
Pretty.
Right. Go and get
the suspendy ropey thing.
And my really cool skintight outfit.
Yep.
Shawn, come back from vacation!
Constantine and the Lemur
have escaped.
The Crown Jewels are in danger!
We are gathered here today
to witness the union
of this pig and this frog
in Holy Matrimony
before the presence of God.
Do you, Kermit the Frog,
take Miss Piggy to be
your lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?
Yes. Yes, I do.
And do you, Miss Piggy,
take Kermit the Frog to be
your lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?
I...
I...
Just say "I do."
This is what you've
always wanted, right?
I do?
I'm sorry, is that a question?
No, it was not a question.
We have to do something, guys.
Kermit, we've got to get
you close to Miss Piggy!
What does this do?
What the...
Piggy, it's me, Kermit.
Come on, we have to get out
of here! The wedding is off.
Oh, wow!
Like, I kind of knew
he'd get cold flippers.
Excuse us.
No, Kermit! What are you doing?
Piggy, I will explain later.
I cannot believe...
Come here, frog!
Where you going?
I'm sorry, my dear, forgive me.
What is going on at my wedding?
Gotcha!
What?
Animal, pull!
What is happening here?
Catch froggie! Catch froggie!
Well, this is the best
Muppet wedding ever!
Piggy, listen!
That's not me! I'm me!
He's Constantine, the
world's most dangerous...
Two Kermits?
Well, that explains a lot.
How can there be two Kermits?
Of all the ways to ruin a wedding,
this has got to be the most creative.
Two Kermits!
No, just one Kermit. Me.
No, no, no. Do not listen to him!
I am the real Kermit.
That's ridiculous!
I am Kermit the Frog!
No, I am Kermit the Frog!
Hilo, Kermit the Frog, here.
"Hilo?" It's "Hiho!"
Would every Kermit be quiet!
Well, there's only one
sure way to settle this.
First Kermit.
Will you marry me?
Yes, of course, let's go!
The helicopter is waiting, my love!
And you, the other Kermit...
Will you marry me?
Well, I mean, I...
I would. I mean, I could. It's...
That's my Kermit!
That's our frog!
Kissykissy!
That is right, Muppets!
I am Constantine,
the world's most dangerous
frog and number one criminal!
And a thousand times more
frog than this Kermit person!
And now,
I have only one thing
to say to you fools!
Good night, folks!
What is that?
It's a bomb!
This is where my patented magnetic
bombattractor vest can aid us,
that Beaker is
conveniently wearing.
What? What's going on?
Wait! Miss Piggy's
ring is the bomb!
Some of you guys grab Piggy,
and some of you guys grab me.
Pull!
That's only 800 years old.
Nicely done, Beaker!
Kermit! Help!
Piggy!
Help!
She's on the roof!
Shut up and keep moving, pig!
You are my insurance policy!
Number Two, you look ridiculous.
Why are you wearing that?
Because I am the Lemur.
And the world's
new number one criminal.
That's right.
This is where I doublecross you.
First rule of doublecross.
You don't announce the doublecross
before you doublecross.
It's not even a rule
because it is so obvious.
The Lemur is literally the worst
bad guy name I have ever heard!
Let's go!
Oh, no!
He's getting away!
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna stop that helicopter.
We're coming! Hang on, Miss Piggy!
Jump!
Shut up, pig!
Kermit!
We have to do something!
I got it!
There's only one way
we can reach him up there!
Muppet Ladder!
What the...
Kermit!
Come on up, Chef!
Watch the hair, bear.
Give up, Constantine.
I've got you now!
Bad move, frog.
Kermit!
Okay, Kermit, we're
coming to get you.
Now!
No, something's wrong.
We're not moving.
You're ruining my getaway!
Hang on, Piggy! I'm coming!
Go get 'em, Kermit!
Kermie!
Welcome aboard, Kermit.
You don't know who
you're dealing with.
I am the world's
most dangerous frog.
Oh, brother!
You may be the world's
most dangerous frog,
but you're still a frog!
No one tricks me into marrying them
and then hurts my Kermie!
What a woman!
Yeah. My woman.
And I believe this belongs to you.
Well, I'm sorry I
ruined your wedding.
Oh, Kermie.
I'm so glad you did.
Okay. Can we get down now?
We did it, guys!
What an action sequence!
You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy.
Thank you.
Congratulations, weirdos,
you've saved the Crown Jewels!
And you've caught my
nemesis, the Lemur.
Look at his little costume.
That's adorable!
I'm not adorable.
He is adorable.
You're adorable!
Did you make that kittycat outfit?
The bad guy is Dominic Badguy!
Well, mon ami , I guess
this is where we say goodbye.
You go your way, and I go mine.
Here comes the rain. Oh, boy.
And I said I wasn't
going to do this.
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop crying.
We're only saying
our final farewell.
Goodbye forever!
I'm going to miss you so much!
I'm going to miss you,
my French friend.
Whenever you're ready.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Take them away!
Take them away!
Thank you.
Au revoir , Muppets.
Byebye.
See you!
You're number two 
Sam.
Shut up.
Sam! Wait for me!
You know, I missed
all of you so much.
There he is, right there!
Arrest him! Arrest that frog!
Nadya? Wait. For what?
For leading the largest mass
breakout in Gulag history.
You will get 30 years. Maybe 50.
But“
No "buts," Kermit.
You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue,
and you didn't even say goodbye.
What?
What?
You are coming with me. Now, move!
Fellas, listen. Easy.
No, no, no! Kermit!
Wait!
We're sorry, Kermit.
We're sorry that we didn't
notice you were missing.
We're sorry we didn't
tell you often enough
how much you mean to all of us.
We're sorry we ever
took you for granted.
But that's never going
to happen again.
Because if Kermit has to
go back to the gulag,
you'll have to take me, too.
No.
You're my best friend, Kermit.
Wherever you go, I go.
You'll have to take me, too.
And me.
Kermit, we convinced ourselves
that evil frog was you
because he gave us
what we thought we wanted.
When what we really wanted...
What we really needed...
Was you, Kermit.
The actual, real you.
It would appear you
were right, Kermit.
I guess this is your family.
And families belong together.
You are free to go.
Forever.
Kermit, did you hear that?
We're free!
Nadya, thank you! Great!
That's wonderful!
Wait!
Hey, guys, listen. We still
have to finish our world tour.
And I know where we
need to play next.
For one night only,
Siberia, Russia!
Yes, yes! I'll pack my
swimsuit right away!
Wonderful!
It's terrible. You will hate it.
You will hate it.
Okay, guys, this is it.
The Gulag Finale!
Here we go!
Aone, two, three, four!
Together again, again 
Gee, it's good to be
together again, again 
I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone 
It's not starting over
It's just going on 
Together again, again 
Now we're here 
And there's no need
remembering when 
Because no feeling
feels like that feeling 
Together again 
Again, again, again 
Together again, again 
Gee, it's good to be
together again, again 
I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone 
It's not starting over 
It's just going on 
Together again, again 
Now we're here 
And there's no need
remembering when 
'Cause no feeling feels
like that feeling 
Together again 
Again 
I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone 
It's not starting over
It's just going on 
Together again, again 
Gee, it's good to be
together again, again 
'Cause no feeling feels
like that feeling 
Together a... 
Together again! 
Okay, Nadya, this is it. Your solo.
Kermit! 
Oh, boy.
Hey, pull the rope!
Oh, right.
This cast is really heavy.
Rowlf, come here.
Come here, come here.
Yeah, what do you got there?
Take this.
You should have negotiated
a smaller font size.
I believe I may have
something that could help.
This is my automated
endcrawl operating machine.
All I have to do is push this button
and it will crawl all by itself.
Let's try this.
Another qualified success.
Check this out.
You can go home now, Ma.
The movie is over.
