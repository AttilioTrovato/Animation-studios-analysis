Morning, folks. How you doing?
Morning, Ozzie.
I hear he's some kind of inventor.
Nick, breakfast.
Nick!
I'm coming.
Wayne.
Yeah, honey?
Where's the baby?
He's in the playpen.
He gets out of the playpen.
No, I fixed it.
Sweetheart,
I hate to remind you,
but the last time
you fixed the playpen,
he still got out of it.
Well, he won't get out this time.
Hi. Will you, big buddy, huh?
I'm certainly capable
of fixing a playpen, aren't I?
You're just a little baby after all.
Your hat?
It's my helmet.
New one?
Yeah, it's a new one.
See, it shaves me. See that?
There.
Amy, it's decided.
I'm going with you. Period.
Mom, in the first place,
I'm not the first girl
who has ever gone away to college.
And in the second place, we're...
Mom.
Excuse me.
Amy, I'm gonna help you
get settled in.
That's it.
Want a noise? Noise?
Yeah, I want to hear a noise.
This one?
Yeah, not this time.
This one.
Okay.
Hear it?
Yep, I heard it.
More?
Sure.
Mom, let's say you were a girl.
I think I can visualize it.
Would you think I was a nerd?
Just by looking at me I mean.
It's a rhetorical question, mom.
It doesn't require an answer.
Am I any girl in particular?
No.
Just a girl I might, I don't know...
ask to go to the movies or something.
Nicky, you are turning
into a very handsome young man.
You're going to be
just like your dad.
Honey,
can you help me adjust
this servo regulator?
Now, if you and Nicky want to get out
by yourselves while I'm gone,
the babysitter's number's
in the kitchen.
What's with him?
I think there's a girl.
Nick? Our Nick?
You know, he's growing up,
in case you haven't noticed.
Uhoh.
I'll fix it.
I'll fix you, you little punk!
Nick, stop.
Adam, no.
Sorry, Mama.
Yes, I should hope so. Come on.
Oh, man.
You're getting to be a big boy.
How do you keep getting
out of there, anyway?
I think maybe we should forget
about the playpen idea.
I said I could fix it.
I'm not stupid.
I never said you were stupid.
Taxi's here.
So what's for breakfast?
Anything good?
Mmm, fantastic.
The taxi's gonna
take mommy to the airport.
And then mommy's gonna show
Amy her new room at school.
Hopefully they'll tire him
out at day care.
So when I get home,
he'll take a late nap.
No nap!
Honey, we don't say the "n" word
around two year olds.
Adam.
Colored car.
Okay, now, Adam's lunch
is in the freezer,
and I put the babysitter's number
on the refrigerator.
Is there something I'm forgetting?
I'm sure I'm forgetting something.
Diane, Diane, relax.
Don't you think
I can handle things around here?
Of course, you can, honey.
Ooh.
Break it up, guys.
Don't worry, dad. She'll get there
and realize there's nothing to do,
turn around, and come right back.
Bye.
Bye, Nick.
Come on, Amy,
we got to get going.
Oh, don't forget to drop Nick and
Adam off on your way to work.
Gosh, the time.
I got to get you to work.
I got a big test today.
Bye.
Byebye, Mama.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
You can do it. Atta girl.
Szalinski test number 1277. 
Crystal group 5. 
Shouldn't we wait for Szalinski?
Maybe this will
teach him to be here on time.
Szalinski isn't running the show;
I am.
This better work this time,
so concentrate.
Nine, eight,
seven, six, five, 
four, three, two, one, zero. 
Here.
Sorry, everybody.
There were some large
cumulonimbus clouds blocking the sun
and I lost power.
And my son got a job for the summer,
Wet and Wild,
and I had to drop him off.
What's that stuff on your face?
Oh, excuse me, Dr. Hendrickson?
I'm sick and tired of this.
Now, we have had some success
replicating Szalinski's experiments
shrinking matter,
but reversing the process,
enlarging matter,
has seen us run up
one blind alley after another.
Clifford Sterling demands results.
His board of directors
demands results;
the United States government
demands results;
and as project director...
Excuse me, Dr. Hendrickson.
I beg your pardon, Wayne.
As project codirector,
I intend to deliver results.
I've been doing some work,
on my own, on the problem, sir.
Yes, Wayne.
I think you'll find
if you look at these calculations...
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.
When you licensed your device
to Sterling labs,
you were promised the finest minds
in the country would be working on it
and they are.
I know that, sir.
Good, good.
But I think
if you look at these notes,
you'll find that although...
Mandy?
Yeah, Rick?
Nick.
Nick.
Hey, Nick, your dad's
here in his spaceship.
It's the dweeb mobile.
Here we go again.
Hey, Nicky! Want a ride?
Hey, look at the nerdmobile.
Oh, man.
Have a nice flight.
Thanks a lot, Dad.
For what?
Nothing.
Dad, were you ever
popular in school?
You bet.
I was president of the astronomy club
two years in a row.
We were happenin' guys.
So, Mom tells me that...
there's some girl?
What?
No. No, I.. I was just wondering.
How was your flight?
Uhhuh. No, fine.
No, we just got home.
We're fixing dinner now.
What noise? It was just
a bad connection, that's all.
The baby? Well, he's fine.
He's in the playpen.
No, I fixed it.
He can't get out.
Ice cream.
How's Amy's dorm?
Uhhuh. Yeah.
Hey, stop it.
Nothing. Just the dog. Uhhuh.
No, everything's fine.
Oh, you worry too much.
What? The chicken?
The chicken you left us
really looks fine, honey.
So, I was thinking,
with mom and Amy out of town,
that this would give us guys
a chance to talk about the...
you know, the birds and the bees.
Here, Nicky.
You know what I was thinking,
Big Bunny?
What?
I was thinking, we got to be
real nice to our brother Nick.
You know why?
No, why?
Well, because he moved away
to a new place now,
and he's got to make all new
friends, just like me and you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Should we sing a song now?
Yeah.
What song should we sing?
"ABC's."
How about "Twinkle, twinkle"?
"ABC."
"ABC"?
Yeah.
Twinkle, twinkle... 
"ABC's"!
Let's sing
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star."
"ABC's."
Okay, first "ABC's."
ABCDEFG, HIJK, LMNOP 
Now "Twinkle, twinkle," okay?
Okay.
Twinkle, twinkle little star 
How I won... 
...der what you are 
It'll be a hell of a thing
for you, Charles, if it works.
It'll work. I'll make it work.
Over the years, I've seen
Clifford Sterling attach himself
to one crazy idea after another.
I have to tell you, the board
of directors is very worried.
Pardon me a moment.
Hendrickson.
Hello? 
What was that?
It was a balloon popping,
Dr. Hendrickson.
I got the idea
while singing my kid to sleep.
You see, if you hit a balloon
with too much force,
you don't allow the molecules
time to expand, and the balloon pops. 
Problem?
No. Szalinski.
Oh, him.
Why Clifford insists on keeping him
involved is absolutely beyond me.
If I were running
this project by myself right now,
we'd be neckdeep in apples
the size of Buicks.
There are those of us on the board
who agree with you.
...Fundamental integrity
of the atomic substructure... 
Clifford Sterling just may have
outlived his usefulness...
to the corporation,
to its stockholders.
I should think his successor
would be a foregone conclusion,
especially if you're the one
to actually make this thing work.
...Thereby allowing
the molecules time to expand... 
without tearing
the atomic fabric. Hello?
Szalinski? Szalinski,
why don't you write up this
balloon research of yours? 
I can do the math and have
it on your desk tomorrow.
No, it's not necessary.
All right,
have a good weekend, Szalinski.
"Have a good weekend, Szalinski"?
Hello? 
Hi, may I please speak to Mandy?
Sure. Mandy, phone! 
Hello? 
Hi, Mandy?
I'll fix it.
Daddy!
Hey, what are you doing up,
little guy?
Hey, Nick, want to do
something with me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Okay. Come on, fella.
One more story.
Then tomorrow, you want
to come with me and Nicky
down to the lab and we'll play?
Okay, guys.
See, Adam, this is where daddy works.
Want me to take that?
Yeah.
Got to be a little bit discreet
about this.
Huh?
Mr. Szalinski.
Hi, Smitty.
Hello. You working today?
Uh, just gonna tidy up a little.
Wow.
Wow.
This is some lab.
Some lab.
Way better than what we had
in the attic, huh?
Way better.
Way better.
Yes, would you connect me
with Dr. Hendrickson please?
Call up a command directory labeled
"primary laser drive."
Tell me what it says
under "intensity."
It says "access denied."
Access denied?
I got to figure out some way to lower
the intensity of the laser.
Hey, Dad.
We could diffuse it maybe.
That's a good idea.
Now, we'll set final target.
Target what, Dad?
Hey, can I borrow this, pal?
No.
Come on, let me see if I can make
Big Bunny really big bunny, huh?
Yes sir, I thought it was unusual,
him being in here on a Saturday.
You did the right thing
letting me know. Thank you.
Well, that's it for me.
Hey, you're gonna have
to wear some glasses.
There you go.
Thirty seconds. 
Twentyfive seconds. 
Twenty seconds. 
19, 18, 17, 16... 
15, 14, 13... 
12, 11, 10... 
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...
Dad!
Power surge!
Three, two, one... 
Quick, the abort switches!
Unable to abort.
Joe, what's happening up here?
Uh, Mr. Szalinski,
your security clearance
denies you access to the equipment
without Dr. Hendrickson's permission.
You are aware of that, right?
Yeah, Smitty.
Uh, Mr. Szalinski...
I'm sorry I had to, uh, uh...
That baby of yours...
Sure starting to get big.
See you, Smitty.
I'm bigger.
Bigger, bigger, bigger.
Dad, how come you got to ask
somebody's permission
to work on your own invention?
Well Nick,
Dad's a member of a team now,
and I'm working
with some real talented people.
But, Dad, it's your invention.
They didn't have the idea, you did.
OK, bud.
Looks like daddy needs to spend
a little quality time with Nick. OK?
So, I'm gonna get you a babysitter.
You're gonna have yourself
a good time.
Nick.
Yeah.
You puttin' on
a little bit of weight?
I'm big.
You know what? Daddy's gonna
make you a nice quick lunch.
Maybe kind of a... lowcal thing.
What do you think? Huh?
It's gonna be good.
Okay, you know what?
Sit down and hang onto him.
He'll keep you company,
and I'll make...
Uh, babysitter,
babysitter, babysitter.
Okay, so... lunches.
Whoa. How about that, huh?
Yeah.
Hi, is this Mandy Park? 
Yeah.
This is Wayne Szalinski.
Can you come over about 3:30 for us?
Uh, 3:30? Sounds okay,
Mr. Schlitzminski.
Szalinski, dear.
Szalinski, right. That's what I said.
I, like, charge $2.50 an hour.
Unless, of course,
I actually have to do anything
like change diapers or clean up.
In which case, the price goes up.
Oh no. All you have to do
is just... just watch him, really.
Okay, see you at 3:30. 
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Are these Quark's or yours?
You just stay here, okay?
She sounded great on the phone.
I want to go a restaurant.
You want to go to a restaurant?
But, I just made this stuff.
It's gonna be good.
I want to go eat in restaurant.
Well, I'll be the waiter, okay?
And, uh... Let me take your order.
What would you like?
I want the duck.
Duck. The duck
is not very good tonight.
Can I recommend the special?
Okay.
Okay, fine. We have soup du jour. 
We have hamburger.
We have French fries today.
Would you like 'em?
Okay.
All right, I'll be right back.
Okay.
Hey, Nick, want to go to a movie?
Just the two of us.
Yeah, there's a movie at the Desert 6
I wanted to see.
Great. Come on.
It'll take our minds off everything.
I'll check show times.
Okay and then maybe afterwards,
we can get
a bite to eat or something.
Big, Big Bunny.
What's that?
What's gotten into him?
Dad, how?
Where were you in the lab
this morning? Were you watching Adam?
He was off to the side.
At the moment of discharge,
where was he?
Just before, I know,
he was off to the side... wasn't he?
Somehow, I don't think so.
Boo.
Don't worry, Adam.
Daddy's going to make
everything okay.
Okay, we got to get him
back to the lab,
analyze the data,
and reverse the process.
One thing, Dad.
What?
Do you think the security guard
might get suspicious
with us walking in
with a sevenfoot baby?
Uhoh.
Good point.
This will cover your
head and your hair.
Here, Adam, put this on.
There.
He looks like
a badly dressed beekeeper.
All right.
Okay. Just act natural.
Come on, bud. Atta boy.
Smitty! I forgot the keys to my van,
and I couldn't start the van.
It's in the lab, but I'm not going
to use anything in there
because of my security access thing,
which you mentioned earlier.
So I'm just gonna get the keys
from the lab.
Adam.
Come on, down.
Szalinski.
Go back up.
Just stopped by to do
some computations
in the... in the data base.
The data base has been erased.
Our entire experiment: gone.
Get back! Back!
Erased?
All 38 gigabytes.
It can't be.
Sure it can,
if the main controller was trying
to compensate laser intensity
for this, which you jammed
into the filter pack, you idiot
causing a power surge
through the entire main drive system.
Who was that?
Stop it.
Who?
The guy in the hat.
Uh, a friend of mine.
What language was he speaking?
Yugoslavian.
You let a foreigner into the lab.
He's not a foreigner, he's my wife's
uncle Yanosh, from Yugoslavia.
He's family,
and he just wanted to see the lab,
and I brought him here.
The man's a genius.
Did you see the size of his head?
225, the I.Q. on that man.
An extended brainpan.
Extended brainpan?
Bathroom.
Did he say "bathroom"?
Bafoom. Yugoslavian.
It's a term of... of appreciation.
"Bafoom: thank you for bringing
me down here on a Saturday
to the lab to look around,"
that's all.
How long before we can restore
the system from the backups?
That doesn't concern you.
You're off the project.
You don't have the authority
to make that decision.
Well, maybe I don't. So why don't you
call Clifford Sterling personally
and plead your case.
However,
after this morning's little escapade
and the time and money
it will cost Sterling Labs,
I don't think the old man will
have a great deal of sympathy.
I hope you'll spare yourself
the embarrassment
of having to be escorted...
to the gate.
Start working data
restoration backwards,
from 8:56 this morning
to the exact time the system crashed.
I want to know what he was up to.
Why didn't you tell 'em, Dad?
I mean, at least then they'd know
that you were able to make it work
when nobody else could.
Look, Nick, remember we made you kids
promise never ever to tell anyone
you were accidentally shrunk
and lost for two days?
Yeah.
That's because we didn't want
you guys to become specimens,
to undergo countless tests,
to go through endless observations,
and who knows what else.
What about Adam?
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
What I do know is:
we got to figure some way to fix this
before your mother gets home.
Hi, guys. I'm home!
Where'd this come from?
What do we do?
I don't know.
We could drive to Mexico,
Dad, and hide out.
Come back when he's bigger.
I mean older.
Maybe she wouldn't notice then.
No.
Honesty's the best policy, Nick.
I'll just... explain.
Sure.
It's not the first time
something like this has happened...
...to our family.
I'll just tell the truth.
Then beg for mercy.
Colored car.
What was that all about?
Umm...
I had a little trouble with the van.
I thought I put it in park,
and it went into reverse
'cause the "p" and the "r"
look... You're back early.
Come on, big guy.
Yeah, I took a cab from the airport.
You know, it really was silly.
Amy didn't need me at all.
Who's the man
in the loud sport coat?
No. No, those are Nick's.
Well Diane, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
Sit down. Sit down!
Mom.
You know how sometimes
the things that I invent
don't always work
the way they're supposed to?
Sweetheart. You can tell me.
How bad can it be?
After all,
it's not like you did something
to one of the kids again.
Wayne, where is Adam?
Well, uh...
Who is that man in the van?
And where did this bunny come from?
All right, I confess! I did it!
Did what?
Peekaboo!
I blew up the baby.
Mama fall down.
Mama?
How'd she take it?
About like usual.
Mama sleeping?
I'll kill Wayne.
You don't want to kill Wayne.
I want to kill Wayne.
What's he doing?
He's playing with his toys.
Well, make him stop.
"Make him stop."
Why didn't I think of that?
Adam.
Adam, stop fooling around!
Catch.
Adam.
That was a real rocket.
Let's go for a walk, Adam.
Play ball, Nick.
Don't throw things at Nick!
Catch it, play ball.
This is your last warning.
Okay, I'll give you
one more warning.
Shh. It's not as bad as it seems.
It almost couldn't be, could it?
Well, I finally got him in his room.
Tell him to stay inside,
and close the door.
I did close the door.
He just opened his door.
And he decided to share it with us.
I break off.
Oh, baby.
Adam, put the door down, sweetheart.
Why don't you give
the door to daddy, Adam?
Give daddy the door, Adam.
I fix it, I fix it.
Wait till the Vista del Mar
standards committee sees this.
Maybe we shouldn't bother.
It's just a mailbox.
Little things have a way of
becoming very big things, Patty.
Let go of the door, Adam.
No, my door.
Stop before someone gets hurt.
Let go!
I fix it!
Don't fix it, Adam. Just
put down mommy's coffee table.
Be careful, baby.
Slow down, Adam. Adam, Adam.
Ooh.
Gentle, gentle.
Not my antique chair!
They remodeling in there?
Come back. Come back here.
Adam. Adam!
Adam, sit down.
He's on this side.
Stop him, Dad. He's yours.
Oh, Adam!
This is not a game.
What do we do when we catch him?
Adam, hang on!
Okay, okay. You guys go that way.
I'll go this way.
Hi, little guy.
Adam, put daddy down!
Adam, put daddy down!
Guitar.
Not my room!
Adam. Adam, put down my guitar.
Put it down.
Get back here. Get back.
That's enough, fellas. Stop.
Adam, sweetheart.
He's got my guitar!
Nicky, he's just a baby.
He's not a baby.
He's a monster.
He's going to break my guitar!
Come back here.
Give me back my guitar!
Give it back, you brat!
Other way.
Guitar all gone.
Got it. Here, hide it.
He targeted something.
It's gonna take a lot more enhancing
to figure out what.
I can do it.
What do you suppose this is here?
Condensation on the lens?
Nah, it's much too solid.
How can you be sure?
I'm sure. It's not amorphous.
It's a mass. I can see.
Play in here with daddy.
Play what?
Play anything.
This should distract him.
Great!
Dance, Adam.
Good, do some more.
Isn't this fun, Wayne?
Adam, clap your hands.
Clap your hands.
Put your foot in.
Why are you closing the shutters?
So one of the neighbors doesn't
look in, see a sevenfoot baby,
and call "The National Enquirer."
Doorbell.
Who's that?
One of the neighbors.
So far, your plan's
working perfectly.
Hi.
Hello. We heard shouting
and a lot of noise,
so we were wondering
if everything was all right.
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
We were just entertaining.
Uncle Yanosh.
Uncle Yanersh.
Not too hard.
You're denting the floor!
Bye.
Dad, help me. He's got me.
He's breaking my ribs.
Don't do that, Adam.
My God, it appears
to have three eyes.
A new lifeform of some sort?
Try scaling up the window.
This could be big.
These could be very big.
Well, I think you did
a great job with these.
This should really distract him.
Well, he likes noise.
Here you go, honey.
Yeah.
You know what, Nicky?
I don't care what you say.
It's still a playpen,
and a playpen's a playpen to Adam.
Yeah, but you have to admit Mom,
not many guys could come up
with something like this
in half an hour.
Cuckoo.
No, no, Adam!
Sweetheart, stay away from that.
Adam, please don't touch that.
Adam, no, don't touch mommy's cuckoo.
Come on away from there, Adam.
Come over here, and play with Nicky.
Play with Nicky, Adam.
When you get a minute,
you might take a look at this.
Wayne?
Well... some of the numbers indicate
that on an atomic...
Please, honey, the truth, okay?
The truth, Diane, is that without
access to the data at the plant,
I don't know
that there's anything I can do.
I know what's happening,
but I don't know why.
I'm sorry, honey.
Hey Mom, look I finally found
a way to keep him quiet.
There were 12 icecream bars
in there.
Well, he's ruined his dinner.
Not necessarily, Mom.
At his body weight,
he should be able to metabolize...
Maybe I should just shut up about it.
Okay, boys, we're going out.
Diane, what are you doing?
I'm taking him to the lab.
Maybe there's somebody there who...
Who knows what they're doing?
I didn't mean it
like that.
I'm sorry,
but all I care about right now
is getting my baby
to shrink back to normal size.
Come on, Nicky,
help me get him out to the van.
Shrink?
Diane, wait! I got an idea.
My original machine.
it's in the lab security warehouse.
Yes!
This'll have to be
a covert operation.
Diane, you come with me.
Nick, you stay with... the baby.
Oh no!
We are not leaving them here alone.
Diane, you can't take him to the lab.
There's no telling what Hendrickson
will do if he gets his hands on him.
Look at him, he's exhausted.
He can take a nap while we're gone.
No nap!
Look who I got:
really Big Bunny.
Hi, Adam.
Hello, Adam.
You're real tired, aren't you Adam?
Yeah, he looks real tired to me.
Should we sing the song?
Twinkle, twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
Up above the world so high 
Like a diamond in the sky 
Twinkle, twinkle little star 
How I won... 
Mine!
Let go!
Gimme.
Adam Szalinski,
you let go of that bunny right now!
Put daddy down, Adam.
It's not nice to hurt daddy.
Sorry, Mama.
Okay, I'm bringing up
the structural overlay.
Dr. Hendrickson,
we can make out hair, bone and metal,
all sort of intertwined.
I think you should
take a look at this. Yes, sir.
He's on his way.
We'll show him
the keratin analysis first.
Structural overlay first.
It's not clear enough.
I think it is.
Why don't we see what he thinks?
Don't worry.
We'll be back in an hour.
Come on.
Byebye.
This is our latest image,
superimposing structural
and keratin analysis.
As you can see, there appears to...
All right, just move over.
It's a baby
and a stuffed bunny.
Szalinski.
I'm going to pay him a little visit.
Back to work.
I knew it was a baby.
I just wasn't sure it was a bunny.
This'll just take a second.
They stored all my stuff
in one large crate.
It should be easy to spot.
Oh, Wayne?
Maybe it's in alphabetical order
or something.
What if it's not?
All I wanted to do
was take Nick to the movies.
Uhoh.
What?
Doorbell.
Twinkle, twinkle little... 
Bunny.
Wait here!
Mandy.
Rick.
Nick. Nick Szalinski.
Right.
I'm here to babysit.
We don't need a babysitter.
Adam, no!
Very funny. Can I come in?
I'm already charging you.
We changed our mind. That's all.
We don't need a babysitter.
I don't think so.
Look, I was promised
three hours at $2.50 an hour.
Plus, the extra if I'm grossed out.
Uh, listen, Mandy, take it from me,
you don't want to babysit.
Not this baby.
I'm really sure I can
handle some stupid baby.
Wayne, we've gotta
get back to the kids.
This is just taking too long.
Honey, it's up here!
See if you can find a forklift.
Mandy, believe me,
I have everything under control.
Now if you promise not to scream,
I'll take the gag out of your mouth.
Promise?
Help me! Someone help me!
Mandy!
Please, someone help me!
Giant baby!
You're scaring him.
Out of my way! Please!
Mandy, calm down.
Help me!
What's that?
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Giant baby!
Help! Giant baby!
The Slitzitskis.
Wayne this is a solar van.
We're inside.
There's a switch marked "batteries".
Just be careful not to switch it to
Whoa!
High.
No! No!
Hold on!
Can we try again?
Good.
Now despite what he looks like,
Adam is just a little kid.
He's in there watching TV,
not hurting anyone.
Summertime.
The active woman. 
She knows what it is
to have a headache. 
Let's welcome 'em. 
Again! 
Wiggle that butt! 
Sorry.
So, two years ago, he made
you and your sister tiny.
And the guys next door.
Then he made you regular size again.
And now
he's made your baby brother big.
Right.
And you don't, like, think
that's unusual.
Oh, my God, he's out and he's bigger.
You got to help me, okay?
This wasn't in the job description.
We'll pay you overtime.
Okay.
There's no way I'm changing
those diapers.
Come on.
Adam! Adam!
Adam, where are you?
Come on!
Julia, be quiet and sit down.
Now for the famous
Chinese blocks trick.
Shazam.
Okay.
Now for my next trick.
Adam!
Now for the disappearing
bunny trick.
Watch carefully. The hand
is quicker than the eye.
Shazam.
Can anyone tell me
where the bunny is?
There!
You think it's still on my head?
Big Bunny.
Bye.
There he is! Come on!
I don't care if Clifford's
at the Rand Institute this weekend.
I want him notified.
I also want
the board of directors in on this.
Hey! What the...
Contact the Federal Marshals.
Get them out here.
I want something large enough
to hold...
To hold something large.
Big Bunny.
Big, big, Big Bunny.
Big trouble.
Stop where you were right there.
I'm just the babysitter.
Yeah, an hour tops. Sure.
Wayne, how's it coming?
Just about got it, honey.
Hold on. I'm taking a shortcut.
Oh.
What do I do?
Okay, let's see
if this thing works.
Wayne Szalinski, you unshrink
those policemen right now.
It works!
They're getting away.
I think they're
out of our jurisdiction.
Hold it. You can't go in.
It's okay, Officer.
That's our house.
Excuse me.
Where are my boys?
Where are they?
Hold it, hold it.
Just a minute.
Preston Brooks, U.S. Marshals.
Now, we found this guy
down the street, hiding in a garage.
The children are perfectly safe,
Mrs. Szalinski.
We just needed to get
the baby some more room,
so he wouldn't hurt himself.
Of course, the mutated child will
have to undergo immediate testing.
That's my kid you're talking about!
Let go of me!
Hold on, Mr. Szalinski.
Let go of me.
You can't keep him in that truck.
Don't worry. It's all fixed up.
As far as your brother's concerned,
it's one big playpen.
That's what I mean.
I'd listen to him if I were you.
Look, miss, when I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.
Mama, help!
Out! Out!
He's got a 40inch neck.
Adam's going to be fine, Quark.
I know it.
The parents are here.
We'll bring them to meet the child
when he's secure.
I can authorize that!
Marshal Brooks?
I'm afraid I have to insist
that these two be taken into custody.
On what charge?
Theft. Malicious mischief.
Child endangerment.
If you'll excuse me.
Clifford.
Well, I hardly know what to say.
I tried to warn you about Szalinski
from the very beginning.
Yes, you did, Charles.
And if it's any consolation to you,
the board of directors
believes that you were right
all along.
Dr. Sterling! Dr. Sterling, sir,
I can reverse my son's growth.
Just give me a chance, sir.
I can get him back to normal.
You can?
With what, Szalinski?
CocaCola bottles?
Hmm? Maybe some
chewing gum and twine?
Just who do you think you are,
talking to him like that?
Diane, let me handle this.
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?
Clifford, the situation demands
that I bring in the people
with the expertise
and the credentials.
Wait a second, you think I'm just
some guy from Fresno
who tinkered with crackpot ideas
in his attic?
Well, let me tell you something.
This whole country is built
on the shoulders of people
who tinkered with crackpot ideas
in attics and basements
and backyards.
Alexander Graham Bell
working in a tworoom flat.
Young man, don't presume
to stand there and lecture me
about great minds
and great inventors.
Whatever I've been over the years,
I've never been a fool...
or been involved
with anyone else who is.
I certainly don't intend
to start now.
Charles?
Yes, Clifford?
You're fired.
What?
You're fired.
So Szalinski, what have you
got in mind
so we can get that kid of yours
back to normal size by bedtime?
Well sir, the prototype's
in the van...
Hold on folks. We've got a problem.
Your son's escaped,
and he's over 50 feet tall.
That's impossible.
My son's only 14 feet tall.
I'll drive.
That's still pretty tall.
Yes, get me Terence Wheeler.
This is an emergency.
He broke out? 
He busted out of the truck
and knocked it completely over.
What's he doing now? 
He's just standing there.
But he's smiling.
Adam, sit down.
Nick, I don't think sitting's
such a good idea.
Ooh, toys.
He did what?
Put your son and the babysitter
in his pocket and left.
He's always doing that.
I find the strangest things
in his pockets.
Wayne, what do you suppose
is causing this growth phenomenon?
I don't know.
They were transporting him
along Copper Mine Road.
That runs alongside
highvoltage lines.
Oh?
Yesterday, when I gave him lunch,
he was right near the microwave oven.
And, you said the baby grew
while he was watching TV.
Of course!
I don't understand any of this.
Electromagnetic flux.
Around every
operating electrical device,
there's a flux.
Like an electromagnetic force field.
That's what's causing
the baby to grow.
Would this electromagnetic...
would it surround
neon lights, too?
Yeah, why?
Your kid...
He's headed toward Las Vegas.
Uhoh.
You are not fired,
not by a long shot.
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for.
At last, Sterling has gone
too far this time.
The board
is getting together tonight.
Until then, I want you on this.
Whatever it takes,
just get the situation under control.
I did have one thought, sir,
but I'll need military cooperation.
Fine, I'll get the clearance.
Charles, just...
just handle this for us.
We'll... we'll do
the right thing by you.
Police reports just in say 
that some kind of large creature
has just escaped 
from a government caravan
and is heading toward the city. 
Mrs. Szalinski,
if he heads for the lights,
he has to come this way.
According to my calculations,
he's gotta hold still
for 12.2 seconds.
What?
His increased mass requires a longer
period of exposure.
How do you expect
to get a twoyearold
to hold still
for 12 point anything seconds?
She's right, Doctor.
We tried to have his picture
taken a month ago. Total bust.
We're just
pulling up now, Dan.
There are
a lot of police cars gathered.
We'll find out what going on.
Call the paramedics now!
All right, here's a shot. Okay.
This is Constance Winters
reporting live from the site
of what will certainly become
the most important news story
of the decade.
Dan, I'm seeing a giant...
Oh, my God.
Oh, Adam.
Well, honey, he looks okay.
Let me see.
Do you think this
is gonna affect him for life?
I mean, something like this
could ruin a kid.
Honey, it might give him
a different perspective,
help him see the big picture.
Baby.
There they are!
Let's move into position!
I'm with you, pal!
Help!
Help us down from here!
Get us down!
We're up here!
We're up in the pocket!
...Reporting live on the
progress of the giant baby
who has just been identified as
Adam Szalinski from Vista del Mar.
The Governor's
on the phone for you, sir.
Yes, Governor.
He's a pretty big baby.
I can get rope guns.
We can shoot ropes over him.
Absolutely not. You are not
shooting anything at my baby.
Baby? Look at him.
Hey, we're his parents OK?
We'll handle this.
Diane?
Yeah, Wayne?
How do we handle this?
Ready!
Watch out! Look out!
Mommy...
Mom!
Nicky, are you okay?
Adam, put your brother down.
Adam baby, mommy's here.
Nicky, I'm gonna get ya
outta here right away!
Okay, Dad, but hurry!
We can get a fire truck in here
and run a ladder up to 'em.
That ladder wouldn't even
reach beyond his knees.
Adam, now, sit down
really slowly.
I got it! Big Bunny.
I need Big Bunny.
I need something called big dummy?
No, Bunny!
Bunny?
It's his favorite toy!
It's the kid's favorite toy.
A helicopter
is approaching with what looks like
a giant stuffed animal
of some sort hanging from it.
Thanks.
Honey, this is dangerous!
Don't worry.
Pilot's ready for you, Wayne.
It's all primed.
Be ready to activate
as soon as he's down.
I'll be fine.
I'm positive my dad will
have a plan to get us...
Tell me I'm not seeing this.
Twinkle, twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
I told you my dad would have a plan.
Up above the world so high 
Like a diamond in the sky 
Bunny.
Twinkle, twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star 
How I wonder 
What you are 
Oh, I'm tired.
Are you tired, Big Bunny?
Oh, yeah, I'm really tired.
I can't remember
when I was this tired.
Get ready, Dr. Sterling.
He's getting blinky.
Yeah, me too.
I don't know what to do.
He's getting sleepy!
It's working.
Your husband's a genius.
I got an idea.
Why don't we all have a nice...
No!
...long...
Don't say it!
...nap?
Brace yourself!
No nap!
Whoa! Help! Help! I'll hang on!
Get me away from him!
Move me away!
No nap!
I get it! No nap!
Hold on, Dad!
Take me up or put me down!
Roy, let's move in closer!
I'm gonna jump!
I'm gonna jump!
Release the bunny!
Whoa!
Dad!
Release it now!
Run!
Dad, this is Mandy.
Hi... oh!
Stay right there, kids.
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about.
I feel a whole lot better.
Oh! Oh!
That's my dad.
He seems really nice.
Run, Dad!
Watch out for his foot!
Whoa!
Are you all right?
Nice try, buddy.
He's headed for the Strip.
You little devil.
He's heading toward the city.
We'll follow and bring you
a live update.
Adam Szalinski,
this is your mommy talking.
You stop right now!
Afraid that won't do any good,
Mrs. Szalinski.
I'm sure he expects his mommy
to be bigger than he is.
To him you're just...
well, you're nothing more
than a talking doll.
Nothing can stop him now.
I don't know what
these guys are gonna want.
But we'll have to cooperate with 'em.
All right, go brief the men.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Hendrickson. Captain Ed Myerson,
Nevada State Militia.
Captain, let's hope
we can wrap this up quickly.
Just so you're aware, sir.
My orders state we do nothing
without final authorization.
Frankly Captain,
I'm not under the jurisdiction
of the state militia.
Your orders mean nothing to me.
A giant infant
is heading toward the city. 
The baby is over 50 feet tall 
and appears to be growing even bigger
at an alarming rate. 
All right,
let's move it, Captain, now.
If it's okay with you,
I'll just sit tight.
..more on this story as it develops. 
There's something down
by my foot.
Look at this.
Wow, let's see what else
is down here.
Cereal.
Hey cool, want some?
No, thanks, I'm on a diet.
Have a raisin.
Please clear the streets
for your own safety. 
Please stay indoors.
This is an emergency. 
All pedestrians are in grave danger. 
Please clear the streets! 
This is the Emergency
Broadcast System. This is not a test. 
A human baby of abnormal proportions
is approaching the city. 
The giant appears to be
growing at a tremendous rate 
and has now reached 100 feet. 
What's happening here?
Is Wayne Newton in town?
No, they don't do this
for Wayne Newton.
It must be somebody bigger.
Listen, babe,
there's nobody bigger
than Wayne Newton in this town.
Of course, I could be wrong.
Peekaboo!
Is he growing or are we shrinking?
It's amazing!
He's doubled in size
in just a few minutes.
Adam! Put us down!
You put us down now!
Howdy, partner. 
Welcome to downtown Las Vegas. 
Hidy, partner.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
He's toddling down the center
of Fremont Street.
He knows not to go
in the street by himself.
There's no telling
how huge he might get.
Especially if he touches
any of those lights.
We've got to get him away from them.
But how? There's nothing
that's gonna make him leave.
Unless he sees something
that he wants more.
Tell your men to pull over.
I think Wayne's got an idea.
Follow that icecream truck.
We'll need a
really big loudspeaker.
Who can drive an
icecream truck real fast?
I can burn rubber.
Well, start burning it.
We'll be with you
on the walkietalkie.
Preston Brooks, U.S. Marshals.
We're commandeering this vehicle.
Come on!
Wait a minute!
What's that?
It's a tranquilizer cannon.
It's used on large mammals.
Cartridges can incapacitate
a target in seconds.
It's like a normal injection
but on a slightly larger scale
of course.
Frankly, sir, I have kids myself
and that just doesn't seem
like the type...
Well naturally, Captain.
This is just a... a last resort.
I'm Bradley Swallow,
reporting live
from the famous Glitter Gulch
where certainly the biggest
story of the year is unfolding.
Casino owners
are understandably upset.
They've been ordered to evacuate...
The answers to our
questions lie with two key players
in this drama:
Dr. Clifford Sterling...
What we do know
is that a baby
by the name of Adam Szalinski...
has somehow measured
over 100 feet tall.
Stop the clapping.
I've got a plan.
Great. 'Cause I'm starting
to get airsick.
We'll pull the thread out of
the bottom of the pocket
and use it as a rope to slide down.
The scene here is one
of total confusion and chaos.
But so far, all the casinos
are still standing.
Watch out!
Hi!
Hey, don't! What are you doin'?
Stop! Stop! Stop!
We'll have to jump.
Hold on!
Don't look down.
Watch out for the gearshift. Jump!
Go!
I'm trying!
I'm trying, I'm trying.
Hurry, do something!
I'm used to an automatic.
Ooh!
We've gotta get outta here.
Toy car!
Buckle up!
Get away from me!
Adam! Adam! Don't eat us!
Whoa!
We're here live
in Glitter Gulch,
standing just below Adam Szalinski,
who has lifted a small, yellow
sports car into the air
with three
unidentified persons in it.
From what I can make out,
it looks like two young teenagers,
a boy and a girl,
and a man dressed
in an Indian costume.
What's he doing?
He's taking something out
of his pocket. A peppermint!
Man!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Howdy, partner. 
Geez! Oh!
That car is like a toy to him.
I hope this thing has air bags!
Do something, Nick!
Tell him to stop!
I can't! He's too big!
We gotta get him
away from those lights
before he touches any of them.
Brooks, what's happening
with that icecream truck?
We're almost set.
Roger! 
Oh, no!
Watch the tree!
Oh no! I'm gonna throw up!
No! No!
Just a big baby with his toy.
Coming through!
Get out of the way!
Come on, Adam, put it down.
Come on sweetheart, put it down.
Ooh!
What's he doing now?
Put us down! Put us down!
He put it down.
Pick us up! Pick us up!
Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!
What about that truck?
Brooks? What's happening there?
Okay.
We're set.
No! Wait!
Hold it! Hold it!
We need him
to get the kids down.
Cut it off!
I can't stand it.
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Whatever you do, don't look down!
Nick, don't let go! Please!
I won't.
I'm gonna pull you back up, okay?
Nick! Mandy!
Hold on!
But you gotta help.
Okay!
Get the car, Adam!
Adam! Pick up the car!
Pick up the car!
Come on, Adam, come on!
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, I got you.
Car fall down.
Lock your door.
Thank you, Adam.
He put 'em in the pocket!
Honey, we can't wait any longer.
Let's do it.
Everyone stand by now.
Attention, all casinos, 
wait for my signal
to turn off your lights. 
Marshal Brooks, bring on the truck. 
Nick, come on.
Ready, set, go, Union Plaza.
Go, Golden Gate.
Las Vegas Club.
Now, hit the searchlights.
Go, Brooks! 
Lucky Lady, Jackpot. 
Come on, Adam. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Go for it!
Glitter Gulch. 
Golden Goose. 
Ice cream.
Coin Castle. 
Binion's Horseshoe, 
Vegas World. 
This must be another one
of my dad's plans.
Star Palace. 
Great.
Four Queens.
The Fremont. 
It's working, Wayne.
Go, Adam!
He really likes ice cream.
Mmm!
Yes!
It's working!
Ice cream!
Where are you guys?
This kid's gaining on me. 
We have clearance, Captain.
Move it.
Brooks said he caught the icecream
truck just outside of town.
Next thing I know,
he grabbed it, right off the truck.
What'd he do with it? 
What do you think he did with it?
You got another idea?
I will. Come on, let's go.
Dr. Sterling?
Wayne!
Do you remember
how we got Adam to hold still
to have his picture taken?
I put him in my lap and I held him.
Yeah?
Honey, he needs me.
The problem is, to Adam, his mommy
is somebody much bigger than he is.
No, Diane. It's a crazy...
Wayne. For almost 20 years
I have watched you have one
crazy idea after another.
It's my turn to have just one.
Ooh!
Fire!
My guitar.
Uhoh!
What now?
Adam, don't touch that guitar!
I am preheating the lasers now,
600 volts.
Diane, I should be doing this,
not you.
There's one thing
every little kid knows.
Daddies mean fun.
Mommies mean business.
But this was never meant
to do anything like this.
Too little power
and you'll grow too slowly like Adam.
Too much power...
I trust you, Wayne Szalinski.
Wayne, time to get large.
Here's your soda, sir.
What do you need a coke bottle for?
I don't. Just the bottom.
Oh.
Tom, I'm here just outside
the Hard Rock Cafe.
The giant baby is approaching.
Hello? I can't hear you.
Turn off the lights?
A giant what? Baby?
Guitar!
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.
Get off the street!
Adam! Don't touch the guitar!
No, Adam!
Adam, put down the guitar!
Can't this thing go any faster?
The kid might be growing again!
This is as fast
as we can go safely, Doctor!
Constance Winters live
across the street
from the Hard Rock Cafe.
He thinks the guitar
is a real musical instrument.
He's trying to play a tune!
Bring me into range
and hold it steady.
Doctor, wait a minute,
if we hit him and he stumbles,
he could fall into the crowd.
We'll just have to hope
that doesn't happen.
Adam, put down the guitar
and get the airplane.
Airplane. Hi.
Hold it.
Steady.
They're shooting at Adam!
I assume that little maneuver
was an error, Captain.
Now steady or I'll make sure this
is the last mission you ever fly.
Hey! Pick on somebody
your own size.
Ow!
All right, let's go again.
Dan...
Hold it stead...
Back off!
Yes, ma'am.
You tell 'em! That's my mom!
I need a vacation.
Whoa. Look at that mother.
Come here, baby.
Mama!
Come to Mommy.
Come here, baby.
Come to mommy!
Mom!
Easy, Mom!
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetie.
Mommy's here.
Everything it's got, doctor!
Roger!
You crying?
Yeah. It's okay to cry
when you're so happy.
The bearings in the generator
are about to burn out.
We better do it.
Okay, now, look at daddy.
Smile for daddy.
There he is.
Daddy.
Wayne, 1450!
It's all she can take!
Say cheese, Adam.
Cheese, Adam.
Come on, Wayne.
Look, Adam, there's daddy.
Daddy!
Honey, you did it.
Adam!
Adam, oh!
You gave us quite a scare,
little man.
I knew you could do it, honey.
There he is!
Let me through!
Well, Szalinski, you pulled it off.
Who would have thought?
Dr. Hendrickson...
that looked like some sort of rifle
that you were shooting at my baby.
They were tranquilizer cartridges.
They wouldn't have hurt him,
I assure you.
Oh.
Tranquilizer cartridges.
Never cross mommy.
We got an emergency here.
Dr. Hendrickson needs help.
He's overcome with the prospect
of having to find a new career.
Hey, big fella,
is this what you were lookin' for?
Oh.
Wayne! Nick and Mandy!
Weren't they...
In Adam's pocket!
Don't tell me...
Oh, my God.
Honey, I shrunk the kids.
Nobody move!
Now, don't worry.
I have highly specialized equipment
to deal with this.
I'll need the helmet
and I'll need the dog.
Good morning, Las Vegas.
All vehicles are asked 
to stay clear of the Hard Rock Cafe
where inventor Wayne Szalinski 
is conducting a oneman search
to find some missing children. 
It was Szalinski's matterexpanding
machine that was responsible 
for last night's amazing events. 
Dr. Clifford Sterling
has just announced... 
I guess your father's about the most
famous guy in the world today.
And I guess you're about the bravest.
That's for saving my life.
It wasn't much.
I don't mean your life wasn't much.
What I did wasn't so much.
How long do you think
it'll take before they find us?
I think it may be a while
before they find us.
You're kind of different, Nick.
Like your dad.
We're not all that different.
Yeah, you are.
But when you think about it...
I guess the world needs
people who are different.
People who see things a little
differently, I guess you could say.
Are they okay?
Yep. I think we better give them
a couple of minutes though.
What are we gonna do about that?
Adam, look!
Big, Big Bunny.
What are we gonna do
with this?
Don't worry. I'll think
of something. Don't I always?
Don't you trust me?
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh, come on,
when have I ever...
