My name's Huck... Huck Finn, and this
story's about me and a slave named Jim.
It's mainly the truth. Oh, sure,
there's a few stretchers here and there,
but I never met anybody who didn't lie
a little when the situation suited him.
So kick off your shoes,
if you're wearin' 'em,
and get ready
for a spitlickin'good time.
Come on, Finn!
Hit me! Come on!
Come on, Finn!
Come on!
Come on, Finn!
Come on! Let's go!
Hit me! Hit me! Come on!
Hit me! Afraid of me?
That all you got?
Come on...
Knock him
into Tuesday, Huck!
Ahhh! Ahhh!
Oooh!
Ahhhhhh!
Go for the glory, Huck!
Yeah, go for the glory!
Personally I can't see no glory
in punching an ignorant lard ass.
But... I gots to.
Pap.
Come on! What're you doin', Huck?
I whooped him!
I whooped him good!
Hey, Louise! Is Jim home?
Hello, Huckleberry.
Hey. Thanks.
My husband's in the cabin.
Ohhh! I'm startin'to lose
the vision. I'm startin'to lose...
It's goin' and it's goin'!
Ahhh, now it's comin' back.
It's comin' back now.
Aaah!
Hey, everybody.
Hey, Sam. Hey, Otis.
Hey, Huck.
Sorry for bustin' in, Jim.
That's all right.
But I need some advice on my futures.
What kinda advice you need?
Pap's back.
Are you sure? 'Cause he ain't
been seen for more than a year now.
I saw his boot print,
the cross made with nails.
To ward off the devil.
Yeah, that's your pap, all right.
I need to know what he's gonna do and
how long he's gonna stay. Now hold on.
I ain't never done this
for no white folks before.
III don't even know
if it's gonna work.
Give you some marbles.
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to try.
Thanks, Jim.
What in hell's bells is that?
Hair ball... from a ox!
Puked it up just the other day.
That'll tell me my future?
Shhh!
Spirit lives on the inside of it.
Yeah. Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Ya don't say?
No! Not to my good friend
Mr. Finn here!
No!
Your old Pap got two spirits
hoverin' around him.
A sweet one with wings
and a mean one with horns.
Sometime he listen to the good one,
and sometime he listen to the bad one.
The good spirit tell 'im
to leave you alone,
but the bad one tells him
to come and get ya!
Now, the hair ball
don't know...
which spirit gonna be
the most convincin'.
It says that your future...
is driftin' like...
the river.
When your Pap's around...
he always beatin' on you, ain't he?
Yeah...
when he can catch me.
Well, the hair ball thinks that maybe
you ought to skedaddle for a while.
At least until after
your Pap goes away again.
Come tomorrow morning, they'll be
talkin' about me in the past tense.
Jim was owned
by Miss Watson, and about a year ago...
Miss Watson and her sister,
the Widow Douglas, took me in.
They wanted to civilize me, which most
people thought was a right nice idea.
But seein' as how I'm so ignorant
and kinda lowdown and ornery...
Huckleberry!
You come in here!
it wasn't workin' out real well.
You missed dinner.
You'll go to bed hungry.
So if ya starve to death by mornin'...
we'll lay your carcass out for
the birds to eat. Oh, my land!
What happened to your eye?
How'd ya get that shiner?
I saw a blind man
walkin' down the street...
when all of a sudden a gang
of thieves jumped out and grabbed him.
Well, I tried to stop 'em,
but bein' so little and all,
they just walloped me
in the eye and ran off.
That the same gang of thieves who stole
your school books last week?
Yep, same gang.
You told us you whopped 'em so bad
they was never comin' back!
II did. But this time
they brung reinforcements.
Hey, where is your fancy school clothes,
Huckleberry! What are these rags?
You played hooky, didn't ya?
No, ma'am.
I went to school.
And on my way home, I ran into a poor
mother with her ten poor children.
Last week that poor mother
only had eight children.
Well, now she's got two more.
Uhhuh.
Anyways, I gave 'em my fancy clothes
to help 'em stay warm. Hmm!
You sweet child!
I knew we could change him.
I just knew it.
Why, he's downright chivalrous.
Why, he's downright nauseous.
And for being so chivalrous, I'm going
to clean you up and dress you up...
and give you something to eat
before evening prayers.
Meow!
Meow.
Shhh!
Come on down, Huck.
Aw, hell.
I should've known better.
I should've finished packing and
ran away right then. But no,
I had to go sneak out and play
with my friends one last time.
Little did I know... that that one
mistake was gonna change my life forever.
Goin' somewhere?
Maybe I am, and maybe I ain't.
Don't you give me none of your lip!
I don't wanna wake
anybody up just yet.
But you move, and
I'll wail ya good.
Well, looks like you put on considerable
many frills since I've been away.
I hear ya can read and write.
Who told you to meddle in such
highfalutin foolishness anyhow?
The widow told me.
I'll wail you good for meddlin'
in something like that!
Pretty soon you'll be taking up
religion like your ma did.
Would you leave Ma out of this?
She's dead and you better...
Don't you sass me,
or you'll be joinin' her!
Well, ain't you
the sweetscented dandy!
With your polished clothes
and your nice bed.
I never seen such a son as you!
Well, I'm not gonna stand for it.
Leave me alone! Let me go!
You're comin' with me!
Let me go!
Oh!
No!
Let me go! Let me go!
Pap Finn, you devil in disguise!
Outta my way, you old maid! This here
is what's mine, and I'm takin' it!
Put that sweet boy down! Ohh!
Leave them alone! Leave them alone!
Say goodbye, boy,
'cause you ain't never gonna see...
these two old biddies again.
I knew I was in trouble, and
it were only gonna get worse...
once Pap started drinkin'.
I was up the river
with some acquaintances of mine,
and we were doin' some...
jobs, and I got the news.
So when I found out
your ma left you $600,
I figured I'd come and get my due.
I mean, don't I deserve it...
after all the trouble and expense
I went through to raise you proper?
But no.
judge Thatcher says
that money's gotta stay
in the bank 'til you get
yourself to legal age!
Legal age.
I can't be waitin' that long!
What'd I do with that bottle?
But I'm...
I'm your next of kin.
And you're my little angel.
II ain't no angel, Pap.
You can ask Miss Watson.
Aaah!
Damn it!
No, Pap! No!
No! No!
No, Pap!
Yes!
Pap!
What're you doin' with my gun?
Uh... I thought I heard
somebody tryin' to break in,
and I was waitin' for 'em, Pap!
Well, why didn't ya rouse me?
I tried, but I couldn't.
Hey, what're you
doin' here anyway?
You brought me here, Pap.
Did I? Why?
'Cause you said you missed me so.
Don't you lie to me.
That couldn't be the reason.
Oh, yeah, that money your ma left you.
Damned Judge Thatcher!
Have to think of another way.
Look at this place.
What'd you do to my house?
I didn't do anything, Pap.
I'm goin' to town.
You clean up around here.
Yes, Pap.
Mmmm. "Yes, Pap."
Little runt.
I knew if I stuck around I'd be dead.
But dead was the only way
Pap would ever leave me alone.
Wild boars are mighty good eatin'. And
this one were gonna save my life as well.
What the...
Now that I was dead,
I could do what I wanted...
and go where I wanted, and neither Pap nor
Miss Watson would ever try and follow me.
And right now, I figured
I'd go to Jackson's Island.
No one lives there
nor hardly visits,
and the fishin's
awful good too.
Aaah!
Aaah!
Huck? Hell's bells, Jim! I
almost puked up my livers.
I thought you was dead.
I ain't dead.
But your Pap came into town
this mornin'...
screamin' about how some robbers
had cut you into a million pieces.
Faked it all, Jim.
I'm as alive as you.
Nope. You ain't dead.
Funny, Jim!
Your Pap look like he done seen the
devil himself. Scared him, did I?
Scared him? You scared
the whole town. They's
out huntin' down your
murderer right now.
That's mighty nice of 'em. The widow
wants you to have a proper burial,
so she got all the womenfolk fleecin'
the woods lookin' for your carcass.
Wish 'em luck, Jim. They ain't gonna
find my remainders. No, they're not.
You know,
I kinda like bein' dead.
Come on!
Whoo!
Whoohoohoo!
Say, Jim! Shouldn't ya be gettin'
back before Miss Watson misses ya?
Well, Huck...
You promise not to tell on me
if I tell you somethin'?
Damned if I would, Jim.
Honest Injun.
Well, I believe you,
so I'm gonna tell you.
This mornin' in all the confusion
caused by your murder...
I ran off!
Jim!
You promised not to tell!
I know I did! I know.
And my word's my word,
and I'll keep my word.
But Jim...
you're a runaway slave!
I could get tarred
for not turnin' you in.
I could get lynched.
Why'd ya do it, Jim?
A slave trader come by the other day
and offered Miss Watson $800 for me.
Her and the widow felt
so bad they pert near cried.
But times is tough. It was
just too much money to resist.
I couldn't let myself get sold
all the way down New Orleans.
I'd never see my wife and
my children again! But Jim!
Now ya ain't never
gonna get to see 'em.
My only chance is
to go downriver to Cairo.
Go south? A runaway slave go south?
I know, I know!
But I got me a canoe,
Huck, and this.
A map to freedom.
Now, here's me.
If I can get myself
all the way down here to Cairo,
where the Ohio River
comes into the Mississippi,
I can take it all the way
up to the free states.
You know how hard that'd be, Jim?
It's a million miles to Cairo!
And a slave
on the river by himself?
Ya won't get five miles.
I know.
But if I could do it,
if I could...
I'd get the chance to earn
money to buy my family.
Ah, hell!
We'll do it together.
I'll help you get to Cairo.
Aw, shut up, Jim!
Now, don't be long, and don't forget
the eggs. All right. All right.
And the flour.
All right.
And the candles,
matches, tobacco...
Hell's bells, Jim! Whatever ain't
nailed down is what I'll get!
And don't let nobody
recognize you.
Well, hello, ma'am.
Hello, child. My lands!
What happened to your eye?
A cow kicked me.
Gracious! Well,
what can I do for you?
Well, I was comin' from
Hookville to visit my cousin...
when my horse went lame.
Oh, dear me! Well, come in, come in.
My, that's a pretty bonnet!
A little girl across the lane has one
just like it. It's a popular style.
Well, it looks so much cuter on you.
So, what's your name?
Sarah.
Sarah Williams.
Well, she got
to talking about this and about that...
and blahdiblahdiblah until I wanted
to wring her scrawny little neck.
So I decided to take advantage
of the situation.
But by and by, she got to
talking about the murder.
That's where
my husband is right now,
out with some of the other men
trying to hunt up the murderer.
And when they find him,
they's gonna shoot him.
That's good! 'Cause I heard
Huck Finn was such a sweet boy.
That ain't what I heard.
So who do they think
killed him?
At first, everyone figured that
old Pap Finn done it himself.
Is that so?
They almost lynched him, too.
But then he up and vanished with
some of his rapscallion friends.
It ain't no matter.
'Cause now everyone judges
that the man who
murdered poor Huck Finn...
were a runaway slave named Jim.
Jim!
Jim?
Missus, where's my jacket?
Howdy, little one.
Hello, good sir.
What're you fetchin' off for? I think
we found that murderin' runaway slave.
Huh! Now, we been lookin' everywhere,
and some old codger just now...
said that he saw smoke
out on Jackson Island.
Ain't nobody lives there and hardly
anyone visits, so it's gotta be him!
Hey, hey!
Now, you watch yourself there, little
precious. You be careful!
Oh, don't worry, I will. That slave
is worth $400, dead or alive.
I best be goin' now.
Oh, not until
you've had some vittles.
What was your name again?
Mary... Williams.
I thought you said it was Sarah.
Yessim, I did.
Sarah Mary Williams.
Somes calls me Sarah;
somes calls me Mary.
My goodness!
You think you could hit that rat for me?
Be happy to.
Got 'im!
Good arm you got there.
Ohhh, I keep it in shape
with lots of knittin'.
You is a boy!
Oh, how you do tease a poor girl so.
You may fool some, but not me!
If you was a girl, you'd have missed
that rat by six or seven feet.
Now fess up!
Who is ya?
You fess up, you little thing! You tell
me, who is ya? You tell me, who is ya?
Oh! Oh!
Come back here!
Jim! Jim, wake up! Wake up!
Huh?
Oh, man! Look at you, Huck.
If you ain't the prettiest...
They's after us, Jim, and there ain't
a minute to lose. Come on!
Come on.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on! Them dogs sound hungry!
Then get a move on.
Hey!
We was off,
headin' down the mighty Mississippi...
on the journey to Cairo
to set Jim free.
'Course, first we had to stop
along the way and borrow a few things.
Say, Huck,
I been feelin'...
mighty guiltful 'bout all this
borrowin' we've been doin'.
Ah, you'll get over it.
That ain't the point.
That ain't who
I think it is, is it?
It's you, all right, Jim.
" Four hundred dollar reward.
Runaway slave."
And what's that say?
Uh... handsome
and wellmannered.
Oh... Now come on, Huck,
what's it really say?
Nothin'.
Just that you're wanted for murder.
Murder! I...
Ohhh, I see.
I'm wanted for your murder.
Well, we best travel only at night.
Is that what I really look like?
'Fraid so, Jim.
Damn!
Oh, did you see that?
Let's go for it!
What if there's people on it?
No way!
A body'd have to be crazy to be on that
wreck! She's bound to break up any second.
Oh, fine! Then let's
just get right aboard!
Looks like she ain't
been here long.
Yeah. Might be some good loot around.
Let's split up and see what she's got.
Hold on, hold on! Dead bodies is
what she's got, so let's be careful.
Right!
I'll go this way.
I'll go below.
Oh!
Oh!
Please don't kill me, boys.
Please don't kill me!
You're a lyin' thief, Joe Turner, and now
you're gonna pay for it with your life!
Wait, listen! You can keep my share,
I won't tell nobody!
It's too late for that now!
Ohh! Ohh!
This thing's sinkin'
quicker than we figured!
Yeah, let's get the booty
and get outta here!
You can't just leave me here. You can't
leave me! You killed your own partner.
He deserved the bullet
I gave him!
Uhhh!
Aaah!
Damn! One more like that
and she's had it!
You can't just leave me here, boys.
You can't just leave me!
Ah, shut up!
Uhh!
Hey, get over here!
Aaah!
Who are you?
Nobody.
What're you doin' here?
Nothin'.
Grab the silver!
Oh, my God!
We're goin' down!
Aaah!
We best be goin',Jim! There's pirates
on board! I know, I know!
The canoe!
Damn!
They must have a boat on the other
side! Come on! Let's get it!
There it is!
Move it, move it!
Come on! Help me, Jim!
I'm comin', I'm comin'!
I feel sort of bad for them
murderers dyin' like that.
I might end up bein'
murderer myself someday,
and how would I like it,
drownin' on some barge?
Huck?
Yeah, Jim.
If you was to hear that your Pap wasn't
ever gonna return to St. Petersburg,
like, if he up and
died or some such, would
you still help me to
get to Cairo and be free?
Or would you go on back home?
I'd go back, most likely, just to see
the look on people's faces.
We'd both go back, Jim,
bein' the right thing and all.
Yeah. Sure, bein'
the right thing and all.
Don't you worry. I'll make sure
Miss Watson takes you back.
Smell that, Huck?
Smells like freedom.
If that's Cairo,
I'm a free man!
And when I'm free,
I'm gonna work hard...
and save every penny and buy
my wife and my children.
And if they won't sell 'em,
I'll steal 'em!
You wouldn't.
Only if they won't
sell 'em, Huck.
They're my wife and my children. It
ain't right that they be bought and sold.
Someone gonna do it.
Ought to be me.
Listen to yourself.
Ya hear what you're sayin'?
Sellin' people and usin' 'em
for slaves ain't right, Huck.
Somehow... That's the way it is,
and that's the way it's always been.
But it ain't right, Huck.
Don't ya see that to be true?
Slavery ain't right.
All men should be free.
I've never heard
such talk in my life.
Right then I knew
what I was doin' was wicked.
And I could feel the hand of God
about to take a swing at me.
Then suddenly I knew what I had to do.
I had to turn Jim in.
Say, uh...Jim?
Yeah, Huck.
All these towns lookin' the same,
how're we gonna know
which one's Cairo?
We'll see the Ohio River comin' in,
won't we? We might miss it.
I'll tell you what. Next time we
see someone I'll grab a log,
paddle ashore and ask 'em. Don't worry,
Huck. We'll see the Ohio River comin' in.
But we might miss it!
Best make sure.
Yeah.
Sure, Huck.
Find anything, boys?
Nothin' over here!
I know we're close, Huck.
We're safe!
You really don't have to do this!
Cairo could be anywhere.
I'll be right back.
I'd come mighty close to helpin' set Jim
free and goin' to hell for it.
But now I was gonna
do what's right,
and I was startin'
to feel real good.
There he goes...
true blue Huck Finn.
The only white gentleman ever kept
his promise to old Jim.
Huck Finn, a man of his word.
A man who sticks by his friends
come hell or high water.
I'm mighty proud to know him.
Ah, shut up, Jim.
Never forget ya, Huck.
Best friend I ever had.
I felt just sick,
but I says to myself,
"Self, you's got to tell on 'im.
It's the only right thing to do. "
You boy! That a raft out there yonder?
Yes, sir, it is.
Is it yours?
Yes, sir.
Any men on it?
just one, sir.
We're lookin' for five slaves
that ran away last night.
The man on the raft,
is he white or black?
He's white.
And maybe you're one of them abolitionist
boys that likes to help runaway slaves?
I believe we'd better look for ourselves.
Oh, I wish you would.
'Cause it's my Pap out
there, and he's awful
sick. And so is my mom,
my sister, my brother...
You said there was
one man on that raft.
I saw your guns and just
got scared, I guess.
Need a tow over,
if ya don't mind.
We do mind, boy.
We're in a hurry.
Oh, come on, get on board.
Thank ya.
People usually just run away when I tell
'em my whole family is sick as dogs.
What's wrong with 'em?
Well...
my sister's pukin' everywhere,
my ma's smellin' real bad,
my brother's skin's kinda rottin'
off his body. Oh!
Pa... Oh,
it's disgusting!
Your whole family's got the pox, boy!
You wanna spread it around?
But I've asked everybody,
and nobody'll help me.
Downstream about 20 miles is
another town. You go ask them!
Would that be Cairo? No, Cairo
ain't for another hundred miles.
Listen, boy!
Next time, don't tell people what ya got.
Just lie your little face off. Now, get!
Uhhh! I can't believe
you're not gonna help us.
The smell on that raft's
just killin' me.
You see any runaway
slaves, boy, you get some
help and nab 'em. You
can make some money.
You bet, sir. I won't let
no runaway slaves get by me.
True blue Huck Finn.
It's always so damn troublesome
doin' right and so damn easy doin' wrong.
But I decided from now on, I'm just
gonna do whatever come handiest.
You mean French people don't talk
the same as us? Why, no, Jim.
You couldn't understand
a single word they said.
Oh, I suppose you could.
You suppose right.
I was taught some of
their jabber out of books.
Oooh, you know some of their jabber, huh?
Yeah, I do.
What would you think if a man came up
to you and said, " Palleevoo Franzee?"
I wouldn't think nothin'.
I'd just bust him over the head.
He ain't sayin' nothin' bad!
He just asked you if you talk French.
Well, why didn't he just say it?
He did just say it.
No, he didn't!
He said, " Palleevoo Francine!"
Well, that's a Frenchman's way
of askin' if you talk French.
It's a stupid way of askin' it!
It ain't stupid!
Well, it is! It's ridiculous!
It ain't ridiculous.
We just talk different.
Lookit here, Jim! Does a cat talk like
we do? No, a cat don't.
Does a cow?
No, a cow don't neither.
Does a cat talk like a cow
or a cow like a cat?
All right, all right. No, they don't.
They talk different.
Right! And French people talk
different than us! Ya see?
I rest my case!
All right, Mr. Finn.
Is a cow a cat?
No.
Is a cat a cow?
No.
Is a cow a man?
No, Jim.
Is a cat a man?
No.
Is a Frenchman a man?
Yeah.
Then we don't he
talk like a man?
Poke.
You see?
I rest my case.
You know... you've got
a point there, Jim.
And the point is...
just because you're taught
somethin's right,
and everybody believes
it's right,
it don't make it right.
You get my meaning?
Yeah, I do.
Jim! Let's get!
Huh!
Jump, Huck! Jump!
Jump!
Aaah!
Jim! Jim!
Jim! Jim!
Jim!
Jim!
Jim.
Make a move, and I'll
blast you in half!
That's far enough now.
See if there's anybody else out there.
Why, Pa!
He's no Shepherdson!
Hush, Sophie.
No, he isn't. Put those guns down!
There's nothin' Shepherdson
about him at all.
Look at that face.
Well, then, what is your name, son?
IIIt's
George Jackson, sir.
You see! Put your hand
down. Hey, what's goin' on?
Here, let me dry you off.
Ain't there no Shepherdsons around?
You know, we might've been shot,
you bein' so slow in comin', Billy.
Where did you come from, George?
I fell off a steamboat, sir.
Whoa, fell off a steamboat!
Oh, you poor boy! Falls off a steamboat,
and then you go and
scare him to death!
They was real nice
once they decided not to kill me.
They told me they was the Grangerfords,
and asked me a million questions.
I decided it'd be best to leave out
the truth, so I slung 'em a story.
And after my pa got killed
in that stampede,
my ma ran off
with a circus clown.
Never saw her again.
Well, you can stay here with us.
As long as you like.
Thanks.
You see what I'm talkin' about?
Hey, George! Here's
a present for bein' my new friend.
This is the nicest thing
anybody's ever given me.
Thanks, Billy.
Billy!
Everything's been real quiet between
the Shepherdsons and us lately,
so don't you go
stirring things up.
Oh, Sophie, leave me alone.
Come on, George.
Say, Billy, let's
slide on down to the river.
I wanna see if any of my...
belongings washed up on shore.
Well, first we gotta
take care of something.
Seems a lot of things have been
washing up lately.
A steamer hit his raft last night
and killed his master.
So he's ours.
We had to chain him.
Hey! Get up!
Come on, get up!
Looks a little rough. Me and you
gotta break him in a little bit.
Huck! So good to see you.
Huck? Who you callin' Huck?
Why, my name's...
Bet ya can't spell my name?
I'll bet ya that dare.
It's GORG JXON.
You done it, all right.
I'm George Jackson.
Pleased to meet ya, sir.
Say, Billy...
why is everybody carryin' all them guns
and lookin' so itchy to use 'em?
Well, we got us
a feud goin' on.
Feud!
What's a feud?
You don't know
what a feud is?
It's like this. A man has a fight
with another man and kills him.
Then his brother kills him. Goes
on and on with everybody's brother...
tryin' to kill everybody else's brother,
until everybody's killed off.
Our feud's been goin' on
for 30 years.
30 years!
Well, how'd it start?
I don't know. You mean, you don't
know why y'all killin' each other?
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Hey, Boggs! You know Pa don't want
you doin' that any more.
Get to work now. Come on!
Yes, master.
Your child got three days work
before he can move on.
Hello, boys.
Hey, Pop.
Huck!
On that river, I had
a taste of freedom.
And now bein' a slave again...
Well, it feels so...
so very bad.
Let's get on to Cairo,
Huck. Please.
Let's get on outta here.
All you think about is yourself, Jim.
Well, what about me?
Don't I deserve somethin'?
I ain't had it so good
in all my life.
Come on, George,
we're goin' fishin'!
And I ain't
in no hurry to leave.
Hey, Boggs,
this one's all yours.
All right, come on,
get down outta there.
Come on, over here.
Now, my daddy was fishin'
on that other bank,
not payin' any attention
to all the rain.
And all of a sudden the bank gave way,
and into the river he went.
Yeah, that's my boy.
All you think about is
yourself, Jim. Well, what about me?
Come on, George,
it's supper time!
I'll be right there.
Jim!
Jim.
It weren't my fault.
If you think I feel bad,
well, you're wrong!
If you think I'm gonna
apologize to a slave,
a runaway slave at that,
well, hah.
I didn't mean for this
to happen, Jim.
It were the worst thing
I ever done in my life.
I'm real sorry, Jim.
Honest, I am.
You're still my best
and only friend.
Huck Finn.
Okay, all right.
Enough of this slop.
Jim?
Hmm?
'Bout time for us
to be leavin'.
Huck?
Shut up, Jim.
Sorry I'm late.
Cyrus!
What's goin' on?
Miss Sophie went off
to marry a Shepherdson.
Well, where'd everybody go?
The women went to raise the relations.
Billy and the menfolk, they gonna
try and kill that Shepherdson boy...
before he crosses the river
with Miss Sophie.
Thanks.
Lots of people
gonna die today.
They're right
up ahead, boy!
Oh, let's go!
Hey, Billy!
Hey, Billy.
IIt's me, it's me! Huck...
I mean, George! What's goin' on?
George, they ambushed us! They killed
my pa and all my brothers!
Hell, they pert near killed us all!
Come on, come on!
We should've waited
for the relations.
Them Shepherdsons
knew we were comin'!
What happened to Miss Sophie? Her and
that Shepherdson made it across the river.
Them dirty scoundrels.
George, I'm gonna kill 'em.
Billy!
Shoot 'im, boys!
Don't let 'im get away!
See anything?
No.
Let's try this way!
Huck! Huckleberry!
You were mighty good
to me, Billy.
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you my real name.
It's Huck.
Huckleberry Finn.
I'm sorry, Billy.
Come on, Huck.
Gotta bring him home.
Jim and me found the
raft and fixed it up as best we could.
It felt good gettin' back on the river.
Other places feel so cramped and smothered.
But the river don't. You always feel
warm and safe and free on the river.
That wasn't my fault.
You are the sorriest
thing I've ever seen.
That Russian fell in the river,
that's what happened.
Hello there!
We're lookin' for Cairo!
Can you tell us
how close we are?
Chuckleheads, you already passed it!
It's about 40 miles back!
Talk about lost!
Must've missed it
that night in the fog, Jim.
I'll be caught
and sold for sure.
How're we gonna
get back to Cairo, Jim?
Sure can't take this raft
back up the river.
And no how can we fight this current.
No, but we could take a
steamboat upriver! Yeah!
We'll find one that's goin' north,
and then you can buy us passage.
Yeah, we'll keep headin' south
'til we find us a steamboat.
Take it all the way back up to Cairo.
Right up the Ohio.
All the way up
to the free states.
Good thinkin', Huck.
Why, thank you, Jim.
Here's some more wood, Jim.
Right there.
Tryin' to get this fire goin'.
Come on, Duke! Over here!
Why are you always
stealin' chickens?
I love chickens.
They're succulent.
We're chicken thieves! That's as low
as it gets. Shut up and keep runnin'!
It seems to me, Jim, whenever
anybody's after anybody,
it's usually me
they's after.
Hello there,
we's in need of assist!
Let's get!
You bet!
Grab the oars!
Hold up! I'm right behind you, Duke!
Come on, push off!
Huh?
What the...
Hey!
Get your own raft!
Thank you, lads. We'd be obliged.
Thanks, nothin'!
You was gonna hightail out and just leave
us, wasn't ya? No, I weren't. Honest.
Please, sir. If ya don't let the boy
go, how's he gonna save our hides?
Sorry, boy.
People tryin' to kill me and...
dogs tryin' to rip my face off,
and it ain't even breakfast yet.
They call me the King, the King
of Bilgewater, and this here's the Duke.
Pleased to meet ya.
The King and
the Duke seemed like nice enough fellas,
but something about 'em
made me feel mighty uneasy.
They asked us
a considerable many questions.
Yeow! Bull'seye.
And once again...
I decided it would be best
to leave out the truth.
So... my ma grabbed onto
the trapeze and swung one way.
My pa came aswingin' on the other.
My ma let go, did a double flip...
and missed my pa
by a good six feet.
She made quite a mess
when she hit them bleachers.
I think this boy's gonna fit right in.
Thank you, Jim. So what is it
you two fellas do, exactly?
We do a fair bit
of doctorin'.
Yeah. We can cure cancer,
paralysis, baldness.
This time we're sellin' a thing
that takes tartar off of teeth.
And it does take it off too.
But unfortunately the...
enamel goes right along with it.
Yeah, well!
We also do some theatre.
Tragedy, you know.
Yeah, we got enough... Shakespearean
costumes here for the lot of us.
But what we do best
are the three Es.
Robbery, forgery...
and burglary.
Hell's bells!
I wish I knew a good trade.
Well, maybe we'll teach you one, huh?
Yeow! Go...
You skinny little rat bag!
I'm gonna wring
your skinny little neck!
Hey, watch it!
Stop peckin' at me!
Oh, good morning, boys.
Good morning.
Aw, hello, Duke.
We gotta run, now, huh?
Naw, naw, naw, naw.
I just been borrowin' a few things.
Ah, yeah.
Nobody saw me.
But lookee what I found.
You were headin' for your Uncle Billy's
plantation, huh? Now, wait a minute.
You're a runaway murderin' slave's
what you are.
I think maybe I'll just
collect that reward.
He only murdered me.
Now, look, we ain't exactly the type...
to turn others
into the law.
We stay as far away from the law
as is humanly possible.
So if you two just, uh...
Listen up and shut up
and do as you're told...
and wait on us hand and foot...
and be real nice to us,
we won't say a word.
You step out of line,
try and run and...
Oh, ho ho!
Easy prey.
I'm all right!
Ya think? I do.
Shall we?
Let's.
Hello, there!
Happy morn to ya!
And a good mornin'
to you all too!
Say, you wouldn't
happen to be...
the Wilks brothers,
now, would ya?
Yes.
No!
No. My name is Blodgett,
Dr. Alexander Blodgett.
This here is Franciscus, uh,
Adolphus and Jim.
Oh, shoot.
Adolphus?
I reckon it don't matter. They already
missed it anyways. Missed? What?
Was an, um,
economic opportunity
they missed, huh?
Oh, ho ho!
No, no, no.
They'll get the money
and the property all right, but...
they missed the death
of their brother Peter Wilks...
down at Phelps Landing.
He died.
Last night.
Too bad.
So sad.
Yup. He said he ain't
seen his two brothers...
in more than 20 years.
Yeah? So, uh,
why did you think
we was them?
Well, one of the brothers,
the preacher?
He's a lot older.
And the one that's deaf and dumb...
he's a lot younger, see.
So when I saw you two,
I just reckoned maybe...
Are you leaving the area for a while?
I'm goin' to New Orleans.
Well, methinks this calls
for a small libation!
Ha ha ha ha!
I'll drink to that!
Right this way,
my goldtoothed friend!
We in trouble, Huck.
The King
and the Duke found out...
that the dead guy's brothers
lived over in England.
They hadn't had much time
to get the letter...
and might not have
gotten it at all.
So those two rat bags
grilled that flathead...
about everything and
everybody in his village,
right down to the damn
dog next door.
Woof!
Mighty smart of ya!
Mighty smart of ya.
Was Peter Wilks well off?
Oh, he was, uh,
he was as rich
as King Soromon himself.
I tell you, Jim,
the hand of providence is bound
to take a swing at them two.
And knowin' them,
they'll duck.
How are you at
playing a preacher?
How are you at playin' deaf and dumb?
Pardon?
Heh heh heh heh heh!
Ha ha ha ha!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Attention, passengers!
jubilee leaving for Phelps Landing
in 15 minutes!
Do I have to wear this?
Wanted to learn
a trade, didn't ya?
Why can't we just wait here?
Because I don't trust ya.
You'd hightail it for sure,
and we need to leave this raft
here for our getaway.
Besides, we'll be
more convincing...
after we arrive with an innocent
young boy as our valet.
Who you callin' innocent?
Look, you wouldn't want us
to accidentally turn in...
your runaway slave friend,
now, would ya?
Come on. Play along with us
for a couple of days.
We'll give ya 10 percent.
Deal.
You never looked better!
I have too looked better!
You're beautiful!
I feel ridiculous!
Hey, King!
Yeah?
Let's go buy those tickets.
All right.
Be right back.
Shoo! Shoo, fly!
Shoo!
Hahahahaha!
Funny, Huck. Very funny.
What in hell's bells
are you supposed to be?
The King said I was
a Swahili warrior.
Even taught me some Swahili,
or what he said was Swahili.
Sounded like a pig in heat to me.
Hee hee.
I'd poked around a little...
and found out that
a steamboat was leavin'...
from Phelps Landing
the day after tomorrow...
and headin' all the way
up to Cairo.
So all we had to do was put up with
them rat bags for two more days,
then it was
off to freedom.
Uh, begging your pardon
on this,
can any of you
good people tell me...
where Mr. Peter Wilks
lives?
I'm looking for
Mr. Peter Wilks.
Get out of the way,
for heaven's sake.
Peter's brothers,
right?
Uh, hehhehheh.
I can tell by your fancy accent.
But we're sorry to say...
we can only tell you
where Peter did live...
up until yesterday.
Oh. What you're
tellin' me, I think,
is that my dear,
sweet brother Peter...
has gone to the Lord.
He held on for you as long as he could,
but yesterday he passed.
And we came all the way from England.
Alas. Alas.
And we never got to see him.
Excuse me.
I must communicate
with me deaf brother.
I told you before, she's my woman!
No, she's not!
Hey, don't I know you two?
Yeah, I do!
You're that...
Stand aside!
Welcome to America!
My dear, sweet Mary Jane.
Uncle Harvey.
Hohoho!
Mmm, mmm...
Enough. Hehheh.
Ah, you're as bloomin' beautiful
as Peter said you was.
You sure are.
Ha ha ha!
This is my,
uh, valet, Adolphus.
My English valet,
right?
Right, right. Heh.
Isn't he the sweetest looking boy?
Why, thank you, missus!
Hehheh.
Oh, and this is my Swahili warrior...
I picked up in Africa
on a safari with the Duke of York.
He makes a great slave.
Yeah. Yes, of course.
Er, might we, uh,
pay our respects
to our brother's remainders?
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Rather, William.
Uh, my brother says...
he'd like to invite friends
of the family for supper,
people mentioned by our dear Peter
so often in his letters.
No, I won't forget...
You know, we might just prosper...
hanging around with them two.
More than likely,
we'll get our necks stretched.
Well, that old King
juiced it plenty,
spittin' out wordforword everything
that young flathead told him.
And how's that
damn dog next door?
Smelly as the dickens.
Oh, thank ya ever so.
So I says to the pope,
" Pope, I'd like to
stay and help ya,
but I've got a
blinkin' job to do...
down in the bloomin' Indian Ocean
savin' the blinkin' pirates."
Watch yourself, Huck.
She's just a girl, Jim.
Adolphus, have you
ever seen the king?
Him? Oh, yeah. William III.
George IV.
Oh, the King of England!
Oh, why didn't you bloody say so?
Course I have.
He goes to our church, regular.
But I thought he lived in London.
Well, he does.
But you live in Sheffield.
That is to say...
he goes to our church
when he's in Sheffield.
Do you go to church?
Of course I do.
We got our own pew right up front.
Whose pew? Why, ours.
Your Uncle Harvey's, of course.
What would he need a pew for?
Isn't he preaching up in the pulpit?
My thoughts exactly.
Now, do you suppose...
there ain't but one bloody, blinkin'
preacher to a bloomin' church?
What would they want more for?
Style.
If it's a priest before a king,
you got to have
lots of style goin' on.
In our church,
we've got 17 bloody, blinkin',
bloomin' preachers.
Where's Buckingham Palace?
In Buckingham.
Who's the King married to?
His wife. What's her name?
Uh, the queen. Queen
what? Queen of England.
Ha! You don't know anything, do ya?
Well, I think...
you're the biggest fibber...
Susan!
How dare you
speak to him so,
him being a stranger
in a strange land,
so far from his own people.
He was telling a few stretchers,
and I wasn't swallowing them.
You apologize to him
this instant.
I apologize, Adolphus.
You're a dear, sweet boy.
I'm ashamed
I called you a fibber.
Women.
Here, now, have some pie and milk,
because you are so sweet.
Why, thank you ever so.
And these are the girls
we're lettin' those reptiles...
rob of their money.
A right good day, Mary Jane!
Good day to you, Adolphus.
Ah, we've just been...
for a marvelous walk in the woods.
What a lovely country!
Hahaha!
A right good day, sirs!
Would you happen to know where the...
the great Swahili
warrior's sleepin'?
We decided the Swahili bit was pushing
it and asked him to wait at the raft.
Well, what about...
A good lad!
Here it is, Uncle.
Father said only you
should open it.
Oh. Bless him.
" Last Will and Testament
of Peter J. Wilks.
I, Peter J. Wilks,
being of sound mind..."
Well, the dead
geezer gave the girls his houses,
the slaves, and thousands
of dollars in gold.
Then he gave more gold...
"to my dear, beloved brothers
Harvey and William."
Praise be to the Lord.
Er, "The gold is hidden in the barn
behind the vineyards."
Well, William, I guess we better
go and get it.
Well?
Well?
There, behind the grindstone.
Aah! Allow me.
Wow!
Begging your pardon!
Hmph!
If this ain't bully, nothing is.
Like I told you this morning,
we're goin' all the way
with this one.
All for us and none for them.
Let's count it.
I don't think it's right, us stealin
from them nice girls.
You're in it now,
you little stinkweed.
Right up to your sneaky little eyeballs.
And if it goes wrong...
You'll take your punishment
right along with us.
Ya know what they'll
do if they catch us?
Ya know what happens to ya
when they tar and feather ya?
Do ya?
No, sirs!
No, I... I don't know!
The tar oozes into your pores.
Clogs 'em up real tight.
Suffocates your skin.
Ya get all green and sick.
Then ya choke and ya cough.
Until ya tear your own flesh
so's ya can breathe.
But ya can't breathe!
And half the time,
ya die from it.
And those
that don't die...
feel so bad,
they wish that they had.
And that's just what'll happen to you
if ya open your mouth.
Hey.
Maybe young Adolphus here
has the right idea.
We should give the money
back to the girls.
That's a dazzling idea, King.
That'll knock over their suspicions.
Shut 'em up for good.
Until we steal it all back.
Yeah, we give them the money...
and that gives us the time
to steal everything else.
Genius.
We're gonna be set for life!
I'd had enough,
and steamboat or no steamboat,
I figured it were time
to grab Jim...
and hightail it to Cairo.
Hehheh. Friends,
our dear departed...
has done generous
to his little lambs,
and as their uncles,
I think we'd
like to enhance...
the generous spirit
of the day.
You see, I knew he'd
feel the same as me.
Mary Jane, Julia, Susan,
take the money.
Take it all.
A gift from your uncles.
Wonderful!
Dear souls, how could you?
Englishman, my butt!
You're a couple of frauds.
I beg your pardon.
And who might you be?
Dr. Robinson, ain't you heard?
They're Peter's brothers.
Doctor...
Dr. Robinson! Oh!
My brother's, oh, good friend
and physician.
Take your hand away from me,
you impostor!
They proved it 40 ways
that they're the brothers.
They even knew everything about
the village! And everybody's name!
They even know about the damn
dog next door. Enough!
They came here
with lots of names and facts...
they must've picked up
somewhere, that's all.
Yup,
it was time to leave, all right.
I could smell the winds achangin',
and they stunk.
Turn these rascals out,
I beg you.
They're liars.
Based on what evidence?
Here's my answer, doctor.
Uncle Harvey, Uncle William,
take the gold back...
and invest it for me
and my sisters any way you want.
That's my answer, doctor.
Whooo!
Marvellous.
I hated to run out
on them sweet girls,
but I figured
if I stuck around,
that dead geezer 'n'me
would be sharin' lodgin's.
Hey, you seen a big slave around,
maybe hangin' on my raft?
You bet I was. Two men catched him,
and now he's in jail.
What?
They had a handbill...
that said he was a murderer
and a runaway...
and worth $400.
So where is he now?
Took him down
to the jail in Phelps Landing.
Phelps Landing.
Yeah, we're gonna keep him there...
until we can take him up north
for the hangin'.
I'm gonna fix their wagons
but good.
I'd come all the way
down the Mississippi...
and hadn't gotten anywhere,
and I realized right then that ya
can't run away from your problems,
ya gotta make a stand
and face 'em.
I didn't tell 'em nothin'.
I didn't want to get you in any trouble.
Good,
because my butt's hangin' way out,
and I'd rather
not get it shot off.
I got to tell 'em
you're not a murderer.
That don't matter.
Me bein' a runaway's even worse
than me bein' a murderer.
The steamboat leaves the wharf
at 10:00 tomorrow tonight.
Don't you worry, Jim.
We'll both be on it.
There's something I got to tell ya
before you risking yourself for me.
You know that night on the steamboat
with all them murderers?
Yeah.
Your Pap was one of 'em.
I saw him, and he was dead.
Dead?
Pap's dead?
You saw him and you didn't tell me?
I'm sorry.
I'm dreadful sorry.
I was so selfish.
That was a lie, Jim.
That was a lie!
And I thought we were friends.
I did wrong.
Ain't no gettin' around it.
Now I'm gonna get
what I deserve.
Hey, boy!
Take care of yourself, Mr. Finn.
Now, where have you been,
you little turd pie?
just playin' with
the damn dog next door.
Just playing with the little doggies?
I oughta...
Just stay right here today!
Understand? Hmm?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!
What's that
old fool up to now?
Me dear brother and I have a little
announcement we'd like to make.
It don't seem right...
for William and I to leave
these little lambs...
without any kinfolk around.
So we have decided,
er, Mary Jane,
Julia, Susan...
We have decided...
to take you back
with us to England!
We'll be havin' an auction
tomorrow mornin'...
after the funeral,
so tell one and all!
We will be selling everything!
We're going to England!
I figured that
before I took off,
I'd grab that gold
away from them two frauds.
Then when I was long gone,
I'd write Mary Jane
and tell her where I hid it.
Well, what is it?
Make it quick.
I gotta tell ya, King,
I'm just not comfortable.
That doctor's been layin'
on my mind all day.
We should just glide out
of here tonight with what we got.
And not sell the rest
of the property?
I reckon these sacks of gold
are plenty for me.
I figure we should just
knock off and light out.
We can't leave thousands of
dollars worth of property lying around.
What about
the damn doctor?
Forget about the doctor!
He's the only one that's suspicious.
Everyone else
is on our side!
Now, look, Duke, old friend.
My brains and your bullocks,
we ain't never
gonna get caught.
Yeah, all right.
Well, just let me
take another peek at that gold...
before we head back down.
Slice of heaven, King.
Feels like a slice of heaven.
Come on!
My Pap were a bad one,
but he were my Pap.
If you see him,
tell him Huck says hello.
Good night!
Where's the stiff?
What? Who?
The coffin! Where's the coffin?
We buried him this morning.
And ever since, Uncle Harvey's
been having the auction.
First thing he sold
were the slaves.
He separated the families.
Come on!
Where are we going?
Got any friends out in the country?
Yes, the Lothrups. Why?
If I tell you somethin', promise not to
come back here until 10:00 tonight.
Now, why would I do that?
Just promise me, Mary Jane!
All right, I...
I promise. Say...
what happened
to your accent?
Those uncles of yours
ain't no uncles at all.
They ain't even English.
Dr. Robinson was right.
Them two are liars and frauds.
What?
Don't you worry! I got the gold.
When this all blows over, I'll write
and tell ya where it's buried.
Oh, no. I'm gonna get those two
right now and get 'em tarred...
No, you're not, Mary Jane.
You promised me.
Why until 10:00?
'Cause there's a goodhearted fellow
I gotta save,
and at 10:00, we'll be gone.
Come on.
Well, why do I have
to leave town?
Why can't I just pretend
I don't know?
Because there ain't an easier book
to read than your face.
You'd give it away
for sure.
Even $225... $225...
$300... now higher...
Yeah.
$375 and a $400.
Even $400. Sold, $400!
Let's sell the next lot.
Mary Jane
was safe, the gold was safe,
them reptiles
would soon be in jail,
and at 10.00 tonight, Jim and me
would be on a steamboat...
headin' for Cairo.
All I had to do
was find that deputy,
steal his keys,
and break Jim oouut!
Oh, I told you...
Let me go!
not to disappear! Didn't I?
Let me go!
Oh, now,
don't kill him...just yet.
Answer up, and quick.
Were you in our room last night?
No, your maj... Unh!
Where is our money?
I ain't seen it since
Mary Jane gave it to ya.
Honest, your majesties!
If I stole it, would I still be here?
No, I guess not,
unless you're a complete numskull.
Uhoh.
Here's another
set of Wilks brothers!
Just got here on
the Mississippi Queen!
Ya pays your money
and ya takes your pick!
Now is the hour of
your demise, you impostors!
What's this all about,
my good sir?
Please let the man through!
That's right!
I'm with you, Harvey.
I am Harvey Wilks,
and this is my brother William.
And you two gentlemen
are quite a surprise to us.
And you to us, sir.
But I must say,
you should have worked on your
English accent a wee bit more!
For this town
has few fools,
and only a fool would be
fooled by that foolish accent.
That's the worst
English accent I ever heard.
Ain't nothin' like yours, Harve.
I'm not very well fixed...
to show proof of
these frauds at the moment,
for last night,
all our bags were put off by mistake.
Convenient mistake, huh?
Yeah, convenient.
What are you doing?
What's he doing?
Making deaf and dumb signs,
that's what he's doing.
Don't your brother know how?
Those are just nonsense!
And of course William
can do real ones,
only he broke
his arm in a fall.
Ahhaha!
Broke his arm, very likely,
for a man who's got to make
deaf signs to prove himself.
Oh, wait,
wait, wait!
Now, I'm not sure these two
are the real Wilks brothers,
but by God, I know
them two sure ain't.
By the way, Adolphus,
are you from England?
Why, yes, I am.
Speak the truth now,
or by God, there's gonna be
one less idiot around here.
That is to say, sir,
I'm originally from Missouri,
but several years ago,
I was sent to England...
to live with
my greatgrandfather,
the Duke of Bilgewater.
Bilgewater?
But he died last year,
and his good friend,
Mr. Harvey Wilks here,
took me in.
Personally, I think
you're just a damn good liar.
Why, thank you for
the compliment, sir.
All right, enough.
We're gonna figure out
who's who right here and now,
and nobody's goin' nowhere
until we do.
Well, they sailed
into the investigation,
hour in and hour out,
the King tellin'
one story and Harvey Wilks another.
But no one knew nothin'
about England,
so they couldn't
figure out who was lyin'.
Although most people were comin'
to believe they both was.
I got it! I got it!
I can prove I'm Harvey Wilks
and these men frauds!
Why didn't I think
of it sooner?
Now, who here
helped lay out my brother...
the late Peter Wilks... in his
coffin? Hmm? They did!
Me and Abe here dressed him up
and layed him out ourselves.
All right, then.
Perhaps you can tell me what was
tattooed on Peter's breast.
Come on!
Come on, out with it!
We want to hear it!
Out with it!
Yeah!
All right, all right.
I can tell you what was tattooed
on his breast, all right.
You'd have to look
real close to notice it.
Just tell us
what the tattoo is about!
Come on, out with it!
Tell him!
Come on!
Get to it!
It was a small...
thin...
blue...
arrow!
Arrow?
Yes! There! You all heard what he said?
Yeah!
Did you see any such mark?
Nope.
Nope.
You fraud!
That's right, because
there isn't any blue arrow.
Peter had his initials
tattooed on his breast,
the letters " P" and "W".
Well, come on, then!
Isn't that what you saw?
I didn't see
any tattoo, did you?
I never noticed
no tattoo at all!
They're all frauds!
I say we tar 'em!
Yeah!
I say we shoot 'em!
Yeah!
I say we hang 'em!
Yeah!
Hang 'em!
Hang all of 'em!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
There is one way to see which pair
is the real Wilks brothers,
or if neither of them is!
Let's dig up the corpse!
Yeah!
To the cemetery!
We've got the tar!
Well?
Dig it up!
Hey, we found it, doc!
They hit it!
All right, heave!
Won't be long now,
Deputy Hines!
Push it! Push it!
Got it?
Almost got it!
Push!
Eeewwhh!
Oh!
My good God!
There's gold in there!
Aah!
It's the Wilks' gold!
We'd best be goin', Jim!
Huck? I thought you'd have
your neck stretched by now!
I'm a little quicker
than that.
Why, Huck?
Why, what?
Why'd ya come and get me?
'Cause you're my friend, Jim.
Oh, come on.
Now, let's get
to that steamboat!
Come on!
It's the boy with that runaway slave!
Hit the trail!
Get 'em!
Fire!
Aah! Unh!
You all right, Huck?
I just tripped. I'm all right.
Keep goin'!
Unh! Unh!
Last call for Cairo
and all points north!
All aboard!
Almost there, Huck!
We made it, Huck!
Huck?
Oh! Oh, my little friend!
Oh. Oh.
Go on, Jim. Go on.
I ain't goin' nowhere without you.
What are ya doin',Jim?
They'll catch ya.
They won't find ya
in the dark.
I got to get ya to a doctor.
I'll be okay.
Ya...
Ya can't take me, Jim.
They'll catch ya.
They'll lynch ya.
Don't go, Jim.
Last call for Cairo! Last call for Cairo!
All aboard!
I don't care what happens to me, Huck.
I just want
to get you well.
Jim...Jim...
We had us
a great adventure, didn't we, Jim?
We sure did, Huck.
And I'd do it all over again.
Yeah.
Get 'em!
Oh!
You can't...
You can't kill him.
Don't you cry for me,
Mr. Finn.
You're the best friend
I ever had, Jim.
You're the only friend
I ever had.
Ya can't.
Aah! No!
Jim!
No, ya can't take him.
He's all I got.
Ready?
Tighten it up.
Aah! Aah!
Leave the boy alone! He's innocent!
Now, Mary Jane!
And if he was trying to help that slave,
he had a good reason for it.
Now you let them both go!
Now!
Aw, let him go.
Lucky day, boy!
You're awake.
He's awake.
He's awake!
Sweetie, we were so worried about you
but you're going to be all right now.
My little Huckleberry!
Widow Douglas.
Why, how'd you get here?
Lands, child.
You've been out cold for a week.
When I heard what happened,
I took the first steamer down.
Well, I'm sure ya think
I'm lowdown and miserable...
for tryin'
to set Jim free,
but do ya hate me?
Not at all, child.
I'm right proud of you. Just because
an idea is popular, like slavery,
don't make it right.
That's what Jim told me.
Your little heart
guided you quite well.
Hey, Jim!
You lie still,
and I'll bring you some soup.
Well, look at you.
What is it, Jim?
Did somebody
do something to you?
'Cause if they did, why...
Miss Watson died.
A few weeks ago.
And, well, she was so ashamed...
that she was going to sell me away
from my wife and my children, that...
she set me free
in her will, Huck.
I'm a free man, Huck.
I'm a free man.
Children, come here, please.
Mr. Jenkins!
Goodbye, Adolphus Huckleberry.
Well, I healed up just fine.
Mary Jane and her sisters,
along with the Wilks brothers,
gave me $500 for my troubles
and my chivalrousness.
But since I got no real use
for money, I gave it all to Jim...
for his family.
The Widow Douglas
said she'd adopt me...
and take me home
and try and civilize me...
but I don't know
if I could stand it...
'cause I've been there before.
Now, where did
Huckleberry go to?
