2
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,994
Mayday! Mayday!

3
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,998
This is the trawler Annabelle. I've lost
my bearings and I'm taking on water.

4
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,669
My last good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees...

5
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,885
Portland Station to
Annabelle. What is your current position?

6
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,178
I don't know exactly, Portland.

7
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,223
Off the coast somewhere
near Rockwell! Wait.

8
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,558
The lighthouse! I see it!

9
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,682
Over here, honey!

10
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,521
Hey, Mom!
You won't believe our good luck.

11
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,939
Guess what I found?

12
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,150
Hogarth, we've been through this before.

13
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,610
No pets.

14
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,320
- Oh, but he's not a pet, Mom.

15
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,613
He's a friend.

16
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,489
Hogarth, we've got
to rent a room this year

17
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,782
if we're gonna make ends meet,

18
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,951
and no one wants to live in a place
with shredded upholstery.

19
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,203
You'll never know he's there.
I'll keep him in a cage.

20
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,999
Until you feel sorry for him
and set him free in the house!

21
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,460
Do you remember
the raccoon, Hogarth?

22
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,129
Ugh... I remember the raccoon.

23
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,215
Please, Mom, at least look at him.

24
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,677
Oh, all right, all right.
Where is this guy?

25
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,138
Annie,
I can't read this handwriting.

26
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,141
Yeah, that one, that one should
have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo.

27
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,811
I will go get him, okay?

28
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,690
So he wants us to hold
the mayo and the mustard.

29
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,693
How about just hold the flavor altogether?

30
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,242
Excuse me.

31
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,496
Excuse me. Sir?

32
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,915
Sir?

33
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,208
Sir!

34
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,168
- Excuse me...

35
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,340
- Huh? What's that?
- Please don't move, sir.

36
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,176
My pet's under your table. Don't look!

37
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,346
If you make a scene,
my mom won't let me keep him.

38
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,431
- What kind of pet, kid?
- A squirrel.

39
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,849
But don't worry. He's friendly.

40
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,019
I'm telling the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space.

41
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,437
I saw it.

42
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,524
And it was headed toward land.

43
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,193
I called the government
in Washington about it.

44
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,863
May, maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.

45
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,075
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!

46
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,787
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.

47
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,708
Unidentified? Knowing you, Earl,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.

48
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,549
Hey. I saw it, too.

49
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,969
I rest my case.

50
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,058
- Ah...
- I believe you.

51
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,893
What if it is Sputnik?

52
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,230
- Or a flying saucer from Mars?

53
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,940
I bet we could find it.

54
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,277
Sorry, kid. I didn't really see anything.

55
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,738
But if we don't stick up
for the kooks, who will?

56
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,906
Is my son bothering you, sir?

57
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,328
Yes.
No!

58
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,079
Call me Dean.

59
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,583
Uh, Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

60
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,792
I will, Mom.

61
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,836
- Right after I finish talking with...
- Dean.

62
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,255
- Dean.

63
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,759
- Found your pet.
- Where?

64
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,968
It's up my leg, man.

65
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,763
Squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.

66
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,972
Don't wig out.

67
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,641
Okay. He's heading north now.

68
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,271
I'm sorry, kid. I'd like to apologize
to everyone in advance for this.

69
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,609
Ooh!

70
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,529
Ah!
Oh!

71
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,284
Check, please.

72
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,119
It's a rat!

73
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,794
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling, please?

74
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,130
Hogarth, honey,
I'm really sorry, but...

75
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,507
Thank you.

76
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,135
I need to work late tonight.
There's some cold chicken in the icebox.

77
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,970
You can have that and

78
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,640
- some carrots...
- I'm way ahead of you, Mom.

79
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,059
- Good. I'll make it up to you, okay?
- Okay.

80
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,852
- I love you, honey.
- Me too.

81
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,732
And, Hogarth, no scary movies,
no late snacks, in bed by 8:00. Got it?

82
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,401
Come on, Mom. It's me, remember?

83
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,322
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Mullen.

84
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,660
If we can transplant at least 15%
of their brain matter into ours,

85
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,329
we may be able to read minds.

86
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,418
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.

87
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,671
I think you've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?

88
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,673
Let's say, my place.

89
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,924
- Oh, jeez.

90
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,511
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.

91
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,597
Darn. I seem to have left my keys
in the lab.

92
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,104
Hmm.

93
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,234
You're gonna get it.

94
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,369
Who's there?

95
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,211
No. No. No!

96
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,720
Oh, come on!

97
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,388
Stupid antenna.

98
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,259
Invaders from Mars!

99
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,978
Oh, Hogarth.

100
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,735
Oh!

101
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,948
Hogarth?

102
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,241
Honey?

103
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,295
Hogarth?

104
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,673
Hogarth!

105
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,360
Help! Help! Stop! Help!

106
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,075
Hogarth?

107
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,202
- Hogarth!
- Mom!

108
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,453
What do you think you're doing?

109
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,081
Don't you know better
than to wander off at night alone?

110
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,582
What if something happened to you?

111
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,459
I'm sorry, Mom.

112
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,462
Oh, don't you ever do that
to me again, Hogarth.

113
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,799
I was so scared. I thought I'd lost you.

114
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,553
Mom, you won't believe this.

115
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,972
Something ate our TV antenna.

116
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,810
- Oh, Hogarth...
- No, no! I'm serious!

117
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,062
Oh, but it's not Sputnik,
like Mr. Stutz thought.

118
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,397
Hogarth...

119
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,066
- No, it's a robot! No, really, it is!
- Hogarth... Hogarth...

120
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,944
- And the robot, it's 100 feet high!
- Please...

121
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,904
- Hogarth!
- And it eats metal!

122
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,282
Stop it! Just...

123
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,741
Stop.

124
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,952
I'm not...

125
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,122
I'm not in the mood.

126
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,293
Come on. Let's go home.

127
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,646
A peaceful stay-at-home
kind of day, in a town

128
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,189
very much like your own.

129
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,650
But then, suddenly
without warning...

130
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,821
Atomic holocaust!

131
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,449
But how does one survive
an atomic attack?

132
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,659
Hey. Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

133
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,037
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

134
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,122
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

135
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,166
No, no, no. It was a metal meteor.

136
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,209
- It ate his boat. My dad says...
- Ah...

137
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,836
It wasn't any of those things.

138
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,671
What would you know about it, Poindexter?

139
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,131
- Hogarth!
- Shh...

140
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,050
Don't make me come over there.

141
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,021
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it only eats metal.

142
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,481
Shut up, you little spaz!

143
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,817
It's probably been sent by foreign enemies
to take over the country.

144
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,737
We should bomb it to smithereens
before it does.

145
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,040
Thanks for the scrap, Floyd.

146
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,959
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it, it's got this,

147
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:59,546
- um, this large bite out of it.

148
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:03,342
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a large bite out of it.

149
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,177
What could've done this?

150
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:07,804
- I told you what.
- Oh, yeah.

151
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:11,475
Strange invaders.

152
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:14,853
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.

153
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,815
Yeah. They're sending someone
to take care of the whole thing.

154
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,401
Jeez, Earl. You really are crazy.

155
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,737
I mean, who in the hell would
the government send?

156
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,868
Kent Mansley, United States Government,
Unexplained Phenomena Department.

157
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:31,745
- Marv Loach. I'm the foreman here.
- What happened here?

158
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:35,999
Not sure. Sometimes the line'll snap
if the weather is bad, sure.

159
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,209
- But for a whole tower

160
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:40,003
to get twisted up like that, whoa!

161
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,339
It's got me beat.

162
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:47,677
It's almost like it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.

163
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:49,721
Enormous beast.

164
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,224
Yeah, what do you think? Escaped gorilla?

165
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,725
Uh, what department is that again?

166
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:57,896
Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the
particulars of the agency I work for

167
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,564
and all that, that implies.

168
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,109
You mean, uh, national security?

169
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:03,610
Let's put it this way.

170
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:05,028
Every once in a while, things happen

171
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:08,782
that just can't be rationalized
in a conventional way.

172
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,576
People wanna know that
their government has a response.

173
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,246
I am that response.

174
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:16,540
So, were there any witnesses?

175
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:19,084
Well, sir, if you'll just follow me.

176
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:22,421
- We did find this.

177
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,591
United States Government, huh?

178
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:29,427
Guess that means something big's
happening here, eh?

179
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:33,473
No, Marv. Big things happen in big places.

180
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:37,644
And the sooner I fill out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.

181
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,272
Enormous beast, yeah...

182
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,152
Biggest thing in this town is probably
the homecoming queen.

183
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,279
Oh, my God!

184
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,410
- Come on, Marv. Come on.
- Okay.

185
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:54,911
I need a witness.
It's around the corner. Come on.

186
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,246
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.

187
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:58,290
I've never seen anything like it.
It's like a big, big "chomp"

188
00:17:58,457 --> 00:17:59,624
- out of the side of the car.
- Take it easy...

189
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,002
It's like a bite out of a ham
sandwich, like a, uh...

190
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,676
What uh, what are we looking
at here, Mr. Manley?

191
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:12,262
Something big, Marv.

192
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,475
Something big.

193
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,317
Hello!

194
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,153
Come out!

195
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,280
- Hey, big metal guy!

196
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:33,366
- I got food here for you!

197
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:35,285
Metal!

198
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,787
Crunchy, delicious metal!

199
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:40,373
- Come and get it!

200
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:21,141
So, I guess you're not gonna hurt me, huh?

201
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:30,275
The shutoffswitch.

202
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:34,404
You saw me save you.

203
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:40,243
So, where are you from?

204
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:45,290
You came from the sky, right?

205
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,292
From up there?

206
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,461
Don't you remember anything?

207
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:56,176
Hmm. Maybe it's that
bump on your head.

208
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:00,513
Do you talk?

209
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,768
You know, words?
"Blah, blah, blah," like that?

210
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:06,478
Can you do that? "Blah, blah, blah?"

211
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:13,526
Well, you get the idea anyway.

212
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:16,154
Let's see.

213
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:19,783
See this? This is called a rock.

214
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,117
Rock.

215
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:22,994
Rock.

216
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:24,329
Good.

217
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,167
Rock.

218
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:31,127
Yes!

219
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:35,507
- Rock.
- No, no.

220
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:38,009
That is a tree.

221
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:40,720
Rock. Tree.

222
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,138
Get it?

223
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:45,892
Rock. Tree.

224
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,519
That's right!

225
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:50,188
Wow! My own giant robot.

226
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:53,817
I am now the luckiest kid in America!

227
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:55,068
This is unbelievable.

228
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,028
This is the greatest discovery since...

229
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:59,823
I don't know, television or something!

230
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,200
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...

231
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:03,868
No, they'll panic.

232
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:06,871
People always wig out and start shooting
when they see something big like you.

233
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,708
- Hmm?
- Oh, wig out. It means crazy.

234
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:12,043
You know, like, uh...

235
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:17,382
No, no, no! Don't do that!

236
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:20,051
That's the kind of stuff
that makes them shoot at you.

237
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:23,596
Two nights ago,
at approximately 1900 hours, sat com radar

238
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:27,725
detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere.

239
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:31,062
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half
miles off the coast of Rockwell.

240
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,107
Some assumed it was a large meteor
or a downed satellite.

241
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:37,026
But my office in Washington received
a call from someone

242
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:40,363
who reported an actual encounter
with the object.

243
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:43,575
This is no meteor, gentlemen.

244
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:47,203
This is something much more serious. So...

245
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:48,913
So, we can't call
Ripley's Believe It or Not

246
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,458
because they wouldn't believe it.

247
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,251
- And...

248
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:56,296
Oh, it's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon

249
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:58,256
Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

250
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:02,802
If she comes looking for me and sees you
then we got the screaming problem again.

251
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,598
So, for now, would you, you know, just...

252
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,933
Just stay here, okay?

253
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:10,602
I'll come back tomorrow.

254
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:17,442
Wow.

255
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:20,278
Well, goodbye.

256
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:25,116
No, no.

257
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:26,826
Me go.

258
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:28,453
You stay.

259
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:30,455
No following.

260
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:33,082
Good.

261
00:23:34,752 --> 00:23:36,294
I told you!

262
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:40,089
I'll come back tomorrow!

263
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:42,634
Now, stay!

264
00:23:46,514 --> 00:23:48,473
No, no, no!

265
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:50,475
Bad robot!

266
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,660
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.

267
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:10,828
My mom will wig out.

268
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:13,289
- That's right.

269
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:18,837
So you have got to stay in the forest,
and I'll bring you some food tomorrow.

270
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:22,799
But I gotta go home now.

271
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,510
So, goodbye.

272
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:32,851
Hmm...

273
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:34,185
Hey.

274
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,522
- Hey, wait a minute!

275
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,357
What do you think you're doing?

276
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,317
Look at this mess!

277
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,408
Oh, no.

278
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:50,868
Put it back!

279
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:52,579
Put it back right now!

280
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:57,041
Help me! I need your help!

281
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,753
Good, good!

282
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:08,386
Okay, put them together. See, like this.

283
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,054
This one here, that one there.

284
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:13,558
- Okay, over, over. Good, good.

285
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:15,518
- Now the other one.

286
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,729
Okay. Good enough. Let's go!

287
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,609
- What the...

288
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:26,613
That's fine! Leave it alone!
The train is coming!

289
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,573
The train is coming!

290
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:30,908
Come on, let's go!

291
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:51,429
Oh, no, no, no, no.

292
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:55,933
You're alive!

293
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,781
Hello? Anybody out there?

294
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,574
Oh, we're in trouble now.

295
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:12,784
Are you all right?

296
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,619
Look, I've changed my mind.
You can follow me home.

297
00:26:14,787 --> 00:26:16,079
Okay. Let's go.

298
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:18,957
Mayor's office.

299
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,334
What? A train accident?

300
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:23,294
What do you mean,
he hit a giant creature?

301
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:25,296
What creature could be big enough to...

302
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,007
I need your car.

303
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,008
Hmm...

304
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,677
Wow! You can fix yourself?

305
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:14,804
Neato.

306
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:16,514
Uh-oh, Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?

307
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:18,182
- I'll be back. Bye!

308
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:22,353
Bye. Hmm?

309
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:32,071
What happened here?

310
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,700
Go on. Tell him what you saw, Frank.

311
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:44,417
You're not gonna believe this,
but it was a giant metal man.

312
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:52,383
Does anyone know where I can get
to a telephone nearby?

313
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:57,346
Would you say grace, please?

314
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:04,729
Oh, my God!

315
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:09,233
Um... Oh, my God,

316
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,736
we, uh, thank you.

317
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:14,405
For the

318
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,783
food that Mom

319
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,077
has put in front of us and... Stop!

320
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:22,455
The, the devil

321
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:26,542
from doing bad things and, uh...

322
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,920
Get out of here! Ah...

323
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:31,089
Satan?

324
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,926
Go! Go, so...

325
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:37,929
That we may live in peace. Amen.

326
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:39,430
Amen.

327
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:43,810
That was, hmm, really unusual, Hogarth.

328
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:47,025
- Forgot to wash my hands.
- Well, uh, okay.

329
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:01,923
Stop, stop, stop!

330
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,759
All right. Come on.
Come on. Over here.

331
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,806
Oh.

332
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,859
- Oh...

333
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:24,154
Come on. Come on, over here. Come on.

334
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:28,658
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.

335
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:30,493
- I work for the government.

336
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:32,662
- Hogarth?

337
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:36,666
Hogarth?

338
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,335
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.

339
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,129
Work for the government.
Your parents home?

340
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:43,173
- We're eating.
- Mmm, boy.

341
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:45,133
Who's there, honey?

342
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:46,676
Oh, hello there.

343
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:48,511
- Do you have a telephone I could use?
- Yes.

344
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,555
- There's one in the kitchen.
- Well, thank you.

345
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,515
Thank you very much.

346
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:55,310
Here. Pretend you're a gangster.

347
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:58,980
Damn it, Mansley.
You call me at home for this?

348
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:02,233
You don't understand, sir.
It ate my car.

349
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:03,818
And you saw this happen?

350
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:07,906
No, I didn't actually see it.
It went off into the woods.

351
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:09,908
So, you don't have any evidence?

352
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,868
But, but, sir, I've got an eyewitness!

353
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:13,703
An eyewitness with a concussion.

354
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,539
This thing... This thing is a menace.

355
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:18,708
It tore up
the power station. It...

356
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:20,210
- It caused a train wreck!

357
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:23,671
What did?
Tell me again, Mansley, and this time

358
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,215
listen to yourself.

359
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:28,676
A giant metal monster.

360
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:34,057
Please, sir. I've got a feeling
about this one.

361
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:37,685
That's lovely, Kent.
But let me try to explain how this works.

362
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:41,689
If you told me you'd found, say,
a giant footprint,

363
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:44,400
I might send over an expert
to make a plaster cast of it.

364
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:46,069
Hell! You get me
a photograph of this thing

365
00:30:46,237 --> 00:30:48,238
and I could probably
get some troops over there!

366
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,907
But you tell me you've got a "feeling"?

367
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:53,118
All right then, fine. You want evidence?

368
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:58,081
I'll get you evidence. And when I do,
I'm gonna wanna a memo distributed.

369
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:59,290
- That sounds swell, Kent.

370
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,377
I'm gonna want that memo
carbon copied and redistributed...

371
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:19,811
Hi. Thanks for the use of your phone.

372
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,273
Well, thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs...

373
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,609
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.

374
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,778
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

375
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:30,989
That's Hogarth!

376
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,283
- Hogarth.

377
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,951
What an embarrassing name.

378
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,120
Might as well call him Zeppo or something.

379
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,956
What kind of a sick person
would name a kid Hogar...

380
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,251
Hog Hug...

381
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:45,128
Hog Hug. Hogarth Hughes!

382
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:52,135
Kent Mansley.
You work for the government.

383
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,471
I wasn't gonna say that.

384
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:56,973
I have something for you, Hogarth.

385
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:59,475
Your BB gun. Where did you find that?

386
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:00,977
Up at the power station.

387
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:03,813
- Hogarth was out there the other night.
- Really?

388
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:06,274
See anything unusual, Hogarth?

389
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:11,821
No...thing...unusual, really.

390
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:18,036
Gotta use the bathroom.

391
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,962
Strange, he's so tightlipped now.

392
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,839
And the other night
he couldn't stop talking.

393
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:32,175
I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot.

394
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,010
A hundred-foot robot?

395
00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:36,012
That's nutty!

396
00:32:37,515 --> 00:32:39,349
- What else did he say?
- No, wait, stop!

397
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:42,518
Excuse me.

398
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,024
- Hogarth?

399
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:49,692
What is going on in there?

400
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,364
- Are you all right?

401
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:55,990
I'm fine.

402
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,534
You know, this sort of thing
is why it's so important

403
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:01,204
to really chew your food.

404
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,877
- Hogarth?

405
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:09,587
- Hogarth?

406
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,423
- Mom! A little privacy?
- Sorry.

407
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,217
- Ow. Ha-ha. Ow.
- Sorry.

408
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:16,386
Oh, Lord, he's been acting strange lately.

409
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:17,595
That hurt.

410
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:30,567
Thank you again, Annie.

411
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:34,862
Good night, Hogarth.
I'm sure we'll see each other again

412
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,573
- real soon.

413
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:48,918
If you're gonna stay here
you gotta keep better track of yourself.

414
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:50,420
Sheesh.

415
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:55,133
Anyway, I thought you'd like, you know,
a bedtime story or something.

416
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:58,094
I've got some really cool ones.

417
00:33:58,762 --> 00:33:59,971
MAD Magazine,

418
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,931
very funny.

419
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,767
The Spirit, very cool.

420
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:06,811
Boy's Life... Ehh...

421
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:08,271
Oh, here.

422
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,107
This guy is Superman.

423
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,318
Sure, he's famous now,

424
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,570
- but he started offjust like you.
- Hmm...

425
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:19,115
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.

426
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:24,120
But he only uses his powers for good,
never for evil.

427
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:26,289
Remember that.

428
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:34,631
Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace.

429
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:37,467
He's not the hero. He's the villain.

430
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,427
He's not like you.

431
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:41,262
You're a good guy.

432
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:43,264
Like Superman.

433
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,308
Superman.

434
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:52,315
- Oh, you're hungry, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

435
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:54,817
But I don't have any metal here.

436
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:56,986
Just follow me.

437
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:00,490
Pick me up, okay?

438
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,958
Wow.

439
00:35:12,503 --> 00:35:14,128
Okay, now, march!

440
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:20,510
Whoo.

441
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,191
Hmm?

442
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,068
Oh, yeah. That's Rockwell.

443
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:40,029
- Nice place, huh?
- Rockwell?

444
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:42,699
Yes, I was born right down there.

445
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:44,242
Rockwell!

446
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:48,204
No, stop! Look out for the cow!

447
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,873
- Come on, no, not there!

448
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,876
Please stop. No, stop!

449
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,214
We can't go there yet.

450
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:01,050
People just aren't ready for you.

451
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:15,064
That was close.

452
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,567
We can't go running
around like that, okay?

453
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:20,111
- Hmm...
- Hey, look!

454
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,696
Hmm?

455
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:26,742
I guess that would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.

456
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,288
Oh, no. We gotta hide!

457
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:32,081
You know, hide?

458
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:34,208
It's when you... You know, when you...

459
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:36,252
Just get behind something, quick!

460
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,924
Don't move.

461
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:12,455
Our troubles are over.

462
00:37:17,294 --> 00:37:18,419
This is it.

463
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:20,171
All you can eat.

464
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,270
Shh. Turn it off!

465
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:43,486
Come on, just turn it off!

466
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,663
- Oh, no.

467
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:55,498
All right, who's out there?

468
00:37:59,002 --> 00:38:02,505
Hey, hey, I know you. Squirrel boy.

469
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:03,839
Hogarth.

470
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,634
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

471
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:08,845
Well, come on inside, kid.

472
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:10,346
Sorry about the crowbar.

473
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:14,058
You'd be surprised how many
people wanna steal scrap.

474
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:18,020
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.

475
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:19,397
I mean, what am I?

476
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:23,192
A junkman who sells art
or an artist who sells junk?

477
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,735
You tell me.

478
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,029
I like it... I think.

479
00:38:27,864 --> 00:38:32,034
Listen, you're, you're not
gonna call my mom, are you?

480
00:38:32,202 --> 00:38:34,036
She doesn't know I'm out. I...

481
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:37,832
Don't worry, kid. Look, it's not my style
to report a guy to the authorities.

482
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,544
I'm gonna have some coffee.
What do you want, some, uh,

483
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:44,255
milk, or what? Milk?

484
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,715
Coffee's fine.

485
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:50,052
- Yeah. I drink it. I'm hip.

486
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,387
I don't know.

487
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:55,057
This is espresso, you know?
It's like coffee-zilla.

488
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:57,268
I said, I'm hip.

489
00:39:00,397 --> 00:39:02,023
So she moved me up a grade
because I wasn't fitting in.

490
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,524
So, now I'm even more not fitting in.

491
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:05,026
I was getting good grades.
You know, like all A's.

492
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:06,444
So, my mom says, "You need stimulation."

493
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:08,237
And I go, "No, I'm
stimulated enough right now."

494
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:09,447
- That's for sure.
- She goes,

495
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:10,781
"Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge.

496
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,742
"You need a challenge."
So, now I'm challenged, all right.

497
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,869
I'm challenged to hold on
to my lunch money,

498
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:16,621
because of all the big mooses
who wanna pound me

499
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,748
because I'm a shrimpy dork
who thinks he's smarter than them.

500
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,125
But I don't think I am smarter,
I just do the stupid homework.

501
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:22,710
If everyone else just did
the stupid homework

502
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:23,961
they could move up a grade
and get pounded too.

503
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:25,463
Is there anymore coffee?

504
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:27,757
Look, it's really
none of my business, kid,

505
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:31,594
but, um, who cares
what these creeps think, you know?

506
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:34,597
They don't decide who you are. You do.

507
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:37,933
You are who you choose to be.

508
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:42,229
Did you hear that?

509
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:43,814
No, wait. Stop!

510
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:57,787
- It's okay!
- My God!

511
00:39:57,955 --> 00:40:00,122
- He isn't gonna...
- Run, kid! Run!

512
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,087
- It's okay. He isn't...

513
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:08,089
- It's okay. He isn't gonna hurt me.

514
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:09,340
Oh, hey...

515
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,258
Don't squash him! No! Don't...

516
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:12,968
Do not...

517
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:15,304
Squash him.

518
00:40:16,306 --> 00:40:17,473
His name is Dean.

519
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:19,600
We like Dean.

520
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:21,769
- Dean.

521
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,980
- So...

522
00:40:25,148 --> 00:40:27,316
Where'd, uh, where'd he come from?

523
00:40:27,818 --> 00:40:29,318
He doesn't remember.

524
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:31,779
He's like a little kid.

525
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:34,323
Little. Yeah.

526
00:40:34,491 --> 00:40:36,993
Wait a minute. You can talk to him?

527
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,122
Kinda. He can't say a lot of words yet
but he understands things pretty good.

528
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:42,498
Oh, yeah. I see.

529
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,839
He needs food and shelter.

530
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:05,855
You got plenty of room here.
This place is perfect.

531
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:07,231
Go away.

532
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:10,860
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.

533
00:41:11,027 --> 00:41:13,362
Hogarth. I can't hide it here.

534
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,531
- "Him," not "it."
- Whatever.

535
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,908
You don't even know where "he" came from

536
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,327
or, or what the hell "he" is!

537
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:22,204
He's my friend.

538
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:25,875
Yeah, what am I? Am I your friend?

539
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:28,210
Bring some Franken-bot with
out-of-state plates over here,

540
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,212
make me change my tune.

541
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,215
I don't like that jazz. God, I'm tired.

542
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:35,217
So, he can stay?

543
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:39,346
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.

544
00:41:48,398 --> 00:41:50,065
Sleep tight.

545
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:52,234
I'll see you tomorrow.

546
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,584
- You're up already?
- Just making the bed.

547
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:12,463
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

548
00:42:17,093 --> 00:42:19,637
Morning, sport. Sleep well?

549
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:21,430
Mom?

550
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:25,434
Isn't it wonderful, Hogarth?
We finally rented our room.

551
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:28,312
Ugh. I'm not very hungry.

552
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:38,113
Oh, yeah.

553
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,159
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling, please?

554
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,787
I said he could stay the night, kid.

555
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:45,996
It's morning now.

556
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,165
Look, I'll try
to come over, okay?

557
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,626
But there's this weird guy here
who's watching me.

558
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:51,919
What's that supposed to mean?

559
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:55,631
I got this big, giant...
Giant thing out here.

560
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:58,634
- I can't talk right now, okay? Bye.
- Hogarth!

561
00:42:58,802 --> 00:43:00,678
Who was that, sport? Friend of yours?

562
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:03,013
Yeah. He's, uh, a new kid.

563
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:07,977
What... I...
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop that! Stop it!

564
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:12,106
Hey, mind if I ask you a few
questions there, buckaroo?

565
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:15,317
Now, why would you tell your mom
about a giant robot, slugger?

566
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:17,153
Say, what'd you see at the power station?
Huh, tiger?

567
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,655
You tell anyone else about this, buddy?
How big is this thing, ranger?

568
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:21,115
Been in the forest lately?
Hey. Where you going?

569
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:22,950
Champ? Slugger? Hey, cowboy?
Where you goin'?

570
00:43:23,118 --> 00:43:25,494
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going out!

571
00:43:25,662 --> 00:43:28,622
Why don't you take Mr. Mansley with you?
Show him the sights.

572
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,666
Oh, Mom, the sights?

573
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,835
Hey, I'd love that. Give us a chance
to get acquainted,

574
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:34,461
swap some stories, huh, chief?

575
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,714
There are two kinds of metal in this yard.

576
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,507
Scrap and art.

577
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:41,010
If you gotta eat one of them,
eat the scrap.

578
00:43:41,178 --> 00:43:45,639
What you currently have
in your mouth is art!

579
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:50,352
Art?

580
00:43:56,484 --> 00:43:58,360
Oh, forget it. Forget it!

581
00:43:58,528 --> 00:44:01,655
It's gone. It's...

582
00:44:01,823 --> 00:44:04,658
Hmm. That's not bad.

583
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:10,831
First, you take
a chocolate bar. Any bar'll do.

584
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:12,541
- Oh.
- Do you mind if I, uh...

585
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,209
No, knock yourself out, skipper.

586
00:44:15,003 --> 00:44:18,005
You crumble up the chocolate
into little pieces.

587
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:21,550
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?

588
00:44:21,718 --> 00:44:23,844
Yes, I see. What do you call this again?

589
00:44:24,012 --> 00:44:26,597
Landslide. It's new. Very new.

590
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:32,228
Mmm. Landslide. Topnotch. Mmm.

591
00:44:32,395 --> 00:44:37,066
You know, Hogarth, we live
in a strange and wondrous time.

592
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:38,901
The Atomic Age.

593
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:42,029
But there's a dark side
to progress, Hogarth.

594
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:43,739
Ever hear of Sputnik?

595
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:46,283
Yeah, it's the first satellite in space.

596
00:44:46,576 --> 00:44:50,246
Foreign satellite, Hogarth,
and all that that implies.

597
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:53,082
Even now, it orbits overhead.

598
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:54,875
Boop. Boop.

599
00:44:55,043 --> 00:44:56,919
Watching us.

600
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:59,088
We can't see it, but it's there.

601
00:44:59,256 --> 00:45:01,757
Much like that giant thing in the woods.

602
00:45:02,092 --> 00:45:03,926
We don't know what it is
or what it can do.

603
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:05,803
I don't feel safe, Hogarth.

604
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:08,263
- Do you?
- What are you talking about?

605
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:12,059
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?

606
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:14,937
I'm talking about
your goldarned security, Hogarth!

607
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:16,939
While you're snoozing
in your little jammies,

608
00:45:17,107 --> 00:45:19,566
back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?

609
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:22,611
Because everyone wants
what we have, Hogarth! Everyone!

610
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:24,738
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?

611
00:45:24,906 --> 00:45:28,450
The Russians? The Chinese? Martians?
Canadians? I don't care!

612
00:45:28,618 --> 00:45:30,953
All I know is, we didn't build it,
and that's reason enough

613
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:33,789
to assume the worst
and blow it to kingdom come!

614
00:45:33,957 --> 00:45:37,293
Now, you're going to tell me about
this thing. You're gonna lead me to it.

615
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,920
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!

616
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,008
Just hold that thought
and stay right there.

617
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,676
Oh-oh.

618
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:53,517
Little lower. Little bit lower...

619
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:56,312
Hey. I thought you were in trouble.

620
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:57,855
That sucks.
Let me just... Up a little.

621
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:00,774
I had to ditch this weird guy
who's staying at our house.

622
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:02,985
It took me hours to shake him!

623
00:46:03,153 --> 00:46:05,112
I kill myself to get out here!

624
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,824
And you have him doing... Arts and crafts!

625
00:46:08,992 --> 00:46:11,785
You got a problem with
arts and crafts, little man?

626
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:15,873
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a little undignified.

627
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:19,501
Yeah? Well, smart guy,
what would you have him do?

628
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:26,508
Main systems on. Main engines.

629
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:28,343
One, two and three.

630
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:34,183
All systems go.
Five, four, three two, one!

631
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:35,642
Blast off!

632
00:46:46,696 --> 00:46:49,073
We're landing. We're landing!

633
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,658
We're landing!

634
00:46:57,582 --> 00:47:00,042
Say, can you guys
cool yourselves a little?

635
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,044
I feel like we're pressing our luck here.

636
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:04,213
Hey, baby, we are cool!

637
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,216
Welcome to downtown Coolsville.

638
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:09,384
Population? Us.

639
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:14,556
Well, can you move Coolsville
to someplace less conspicuous?

640
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:17,684
- How about the lake?
- Okay.

641
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:20,562
Aw, come with us. It'll be fun.

642
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:15,284
This can't last forever, Hogarth.
We gotta tell somebody about him.

643
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:17,286
Ah, you worry too much.

644
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:23,125
Hey, Dean! Watch this!

645
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:25,460
All right, we're watching. We're watching.

646
00:48:25,628 --> 00:48:28,797
This one's for professionals only!

647
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:32,134
Banzai!

648
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,934
Come on in!

649
00:48:41,102 --> 00:48:43,770
The water's great!

650
00:48:43,938 --> 00:48:45,814
No, thanks.

651
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:47,983
You weenie!

652
00:48:49,652 --> 00:48:50,694
Come on in.

653
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:53,947
It's really, really refreshing.

654
00:49:01,164 --> 00:49:03,707
What? You too?

655
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:07,169
You big baby!

656
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,510
Banzai!

657
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,543
Whoo!

658
00:49:52,507 --> 00:49:54,049
- Hey.
- Yeah?

659
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:57,094
- You're right in the middle of the road!
- Yeah?

660
00:49:57,262 --> 00:49:58,387
All right.

661
00:50:02,058 --> 00:50:05,727
I think that's enough fun for one day.

662
00:50:20,243 --> 00:50:22,244
Are you okay in there,
Mr. Mansley?

663
00:50:22,412 --> 00:50:24,037
I'm back with the toilet paper you needed.

664
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:27,916
Thanks!
I think I'm feeling better now.

665
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:30,711
Much. Much better.

666
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,762
It's beautiful, huh?

667
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,597
Hey, look!

668
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:46,101
It's a deer.

669
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:47,477
- Deer?
- Shh.

670
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,271
Let's get closer.

671
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:24,514
Hmm. Well, I guess he decided to...

672
00:51:33,483 --> 00:51:35,525
It's the monster!

673
00:51:38,613 --> 00:51:39,988
Oh, no.

674
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:49,873
It's dead.

675
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:53,502
Dead?

676
00:51:56,672 --> 00:51:58,131
Don't do that!

677
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:01,176
Why?

678
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:04,137
It's dead. Understand?

679
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:07,683
They shot it with that gun.

680
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:18,193
Hey, what's wrong?

681
00:52:20,196 --> 00:52:23,407
- Guns.
- Yes. Guns kill.

682
00:52:24,534 --> 00:52:27,202
Guns kill.

683
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:56,523
I know you feel bad about the deer.
But it's not your fault.

684
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:58,191
Things die.

685
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:00,193
It's part of life.

686
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:02,529
It's bad to kill.

687
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:04,739
But it's not bad to die.

688
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:07,451
You die?

689
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:12,414
Well, yes, someday.

690
00:53:12,582 --> 00:53:14,875
I die?

691
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:16,751
I don't know.

692
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:21,381
You're made of metal
but you have feelings.

693
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:23,592
And you think about things.

694
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,803
And that means you have a soul.

695
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,723
And souls don't die.

696
00:53:29,891 --> 00:53:31,766
Soul?

697
00:53:31,934 --> 00:53:35,937
Mom says it's something inside
of all good things,

698
00:53:36,105 --> 00:53:38,732
and that it goes on forever and ever.

699
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:56,584
Souls don't die.

700
00:54:09,806 --> 00:54:11,432
- You're late for dinner, Hogarth.

701
00:54:14,686 --> 00:54:16,979
Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth.

702
00:54:17,314 --> 00:54:18,606
So it's just us guys.

703
00:54:18,774 --> 00:54:21,525
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!

704
00:54:23,028 --> 00:54:26,656
How's that? A little too bright? Good.

705
00:54:28,617 --> 00:54:31,994
Forgive me, Hogarth.
I wanted you to learn something.

706
00:54:32,162 --> 00:54:33,871
What can I learn from you?

707
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:35,206
You can learn this, Hogarth.

708
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,541
That I can do anything I want,
whenever I want,

709
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:40,002
if I feel it's in
the people's best interest.

710
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,296
The giant metal man, where is it?

711
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:45,049
I don't know what you're talking about.

712
00:54:45,217 --> 00:54:47,051
You don't? Well.

713
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,638
Does this ring a bell?

714
00:54:51,473 --> 00:54:52,682
No?

715
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:54,225
How about this?

716
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:57,395
You've been careless, Hogarth.

717
00:54:57,563 --> 00:54:58,896
It doesn't prove anything.

718
00:54:59,064 --> 00:55:01,649
It's enough to get the Army here
with one phone call.

719
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:04,735
- Then what's stopping you?
- Where's the giant?

720
00:55:04,903 --> 00:55:07,196
You can't protect him, Hogarth,

721
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:10,741
any more than you can
protect your mother.

722
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:12,076
My mom?

723
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:14,704
Ah, it's difficult
to raise a boy all alone.

724
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:16,247
We can make it more difficult.

725
00:55:16,415 --> 00:55:18,416
In fact, we can make it so difficult

726
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:21,752
that it would be irresponsible
for us to leave you in her care

727
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,879
and all that that implies.

728
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:26,757
- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth.
- You can't do that!

729
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:29,552
Oh, we can. And we will.

730
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:35,683
He's in the junkyard.

731
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:38,102
McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Road.

732
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:42,773
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metal-eater.

733
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:46,944
I wouldn't worry about this, Hogarth.
It isn't really happening.

734
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:49,405
This is only a bad dream.

735
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:56,787
Where's the giant?

736
00:55:56,955 --> 00:55:59,790
This is only a bad dream.

737
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:01,292
Yes, sir.

738
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,877
This thing is real, sir.

739
00:56:03,045 --> 00:56:05,921
I not only have incontrovertible
evidence, General,

740
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:07,798
I know where it's hidden.

741
00:56:07,966 --> 00:56:09,300
I don't know who built it, but it's here.

742
00:56:09,468 --> 00:56:12,053
It's massive
and we're running out of time.

743
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,972
There's no doubt we should act.
The only question, sir, is...

744
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,475
Can you afford not to?

745
00:56:17,643 --> 00:56:21,645
Excellent, sir. You won't regret it.
Thank you, sir.

746
00:56:32,324 --> 00:56:36,118
The Army arrives in the morning, Hogarth.
Don't get cute.

747
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,000
I gotta warn Dean.

748
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:56,347
I'll be watching you.

749
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:15,676
Morning, Kent.

750
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:28,439
For some reason, the Army
is in our front yard, Mr. Mansley.

751
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:30,733
Please, call me Kent.

752
00:58:38,283 --> 00:58:40,576
Okay.

753
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,969
- All right, where is it?
- What?

754
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:01,096
You know darn well what. The monster.

755
00:59:01,264 --> 00:59:04,433
The giant thing. The metal man.

756
00:59:05,727 --> 00:59:10,606
Ah, the metal man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.

757
00:59:10,774 --> 00:59:13,817
I thought I was under attack or something.

758
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:15,236
He's in the back.

759
00:59:15,403 --> 00:59:17,321
Come on. I'll show you.

760
00:59:22,828 --> 00:59:24,995
You guys got here just in time.

761
00:59:25,163 --> 00:59:27,957
This rich cat,
you know, some industrialist,

762
00:59:28,124 --> 00:59:30,417
wants him for the lobby of his company.

763
00:59:30,585 --> 00:59:32,503
He whipped out his checkbook on the spot.

764
00:59:32,671 --> 00:59:36,006
I said, "Hey, you got him
for the rest of your life.

765
00:59:36,174 --> 00:59:40,261
"But, what, I gotta let go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.

766
00:59:40,428 --> 00:59:42,680
"Give me some time
to cut the umbilical, man."

767
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,599
Here he is.

768
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,274
Anyway, I haven't sold him yet.

769
00:59:53,441 --> 00:59:57,861
So if you really want him and if,
you know, you throw in

770
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,197
a competitive bid...

771
01:00:00,365 --> 01:00:02,116
Sir, I... Listen... Sir, listen...

772
01:00:02,284 --> 01:00:04,535
- Step outside, Mansley.
- Yes.

773
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:07,871
You realize how much hardware
I brought out here?

774
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:12,126
You just blew millions of Uncle Sam's
dollars out of your butt!

775
01:00:12,294 --> 01:00:15,045
I gotta admit, I'm relieved that

776
01:00:15,213 --> 01:00:17,548
this is what Hogarth was talking about.

777
01:00:17,716 --> 01:00:21,010
I mean, I was beginning to, um,
think it was real.

778
01:00:21,177 --> 01:00:24,888
- I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it.

779
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:27,892
But, uh, do you need all this stuff
on the surface?

780
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:31,562
Well, um, no, actually.

781
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,732
It just sort of...
It seems kind of slapped on.

782
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:37,192
You know, not as thought-out
as this other piece.

783
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,070
- You like that one?
- Yeah.

784
01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:43,699
You'll be chief inspector
of subway toilets

785
01:00:43,867 --> 01:00:45,576
by the time I'm finished with you!

786
01:00:45,744 --> 01:00:50,080
Now, pack up. I'll expect you back
in Washington to clear out your office.

787
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:51,540
Yes, sir.

788
01:00:54,252 --> 01:00:56,712
Hmm. I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

789
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,089
You mean, you know about that?

790
01:00:59,382 --> 01:01:01,216
Aw. Now I do.

791
01:01:15,398 --> 01:01:19,109
Bye, Kent, and all that that implies.

792
01:01:19,277 --> 01:01:20,861
Okay, you can move now.

793
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:23,781
Nice job!

794
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,788
Thruster to base.

795
01:01:30,955 --> 01:01:32,623
I'm goin' in.

796
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:35,793
Only one creature could create
so much destruction.

797
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:37,753
The hideous, people-eating,

798
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:41,256
killing machine, Atomo!

799
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,635
Atomo?

800
01:01:44,803 --> 01:01:46,804
No Atomo.

801
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:57,147
I Superman.

802
01:01:57,315 --> 01:01:59,400
Okay, Superman.

803
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:00,818
Take this!

804
01:02:04,823 --> 01:02:06,156
Stupid gun.

805
01:02:19,129 --> 01:02:20,796
Hey. What's wrong?

806
01:02:23,466 --> 01:02:25,968
As I was saying, take this!

807
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:31,015
Oh!

808
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,350
What happened? What was that...

809
01:02:33,518 --> 01:02:35,936
Shh. Stay down and follow me.

810
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,525
Shh.

811
01:02:42,527 --> 01:02:43,861
Get back!

812
01:02:46,698 --> 01:02:49,032
I said, get back! I mean it!

813
01:02:49,868 --> 01:02:51,869
No, stop. Why?

814
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:54,204
It was an accident. He's our friend.

815
01:02:54,372 --> 01:02:58,167
He's a piece of hardware, Hogarth.
Why do you think the Army was here?

816
01:02:58,334 --> 01:03:01,795
He's a weapon! A big gun that walks!

817
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:05,382
I, I...

818
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,051
I not gun.

819
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:09,053
Yeah, what's that, huh?

820
01:03:09,554 --> 01:03:12,222
You almost did that to Hogarth!

821
01:03:13,391 --> 01:03:14,725
No.

822
01:03:18,313 --> 01:03:19,730
- Come back!
- Hogarth.

823
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:21,523
- Hey, stop!
- Giant!

824
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:23,192
Come back!

825
01:03:27,489 --> 01:03:29,072
It was defensive.

826
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,492
He reacted to the gun.

827
01:03:34,704 --> 01:03:36,914
You're not gonna
get there fast enough on foot.

828
01:03:56,768 --> 01:03:59,269
See, I told you it was a big hoax.

829
01:03:59,437 --> 01:04:01,063
- Dad said...
- Give me the binoculars.

830
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:03,690
- What? What?
- Hey, there it is. I see it!

831
01:04:04,776 --> 01:04:06,693
It's big. It's walking away.

832
01:04:06,861 --> 01:04:09,029
- Hey. Gimme those.
- Over there. See it?

833
01:04:09,197 --> 01:04:10,614
The monster! Holy cow!

834
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:13,450
Watch it!

835
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:14,952
Help!

836
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,954
Somebody help me!

837
01:04:17,622 --> 01:04:19,123
I don't wanna fall!
Help!

838
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:22,543
I'm slipping!

839
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,962
- I can't hold on much longer!

840
01:04:33,972 --> 01:04:35,472
Dad!
Daddy!

841
01:04:37,976 --> 01:04:40,602
He saved those boys!
It's friendly!

842
01:04:55,118 --> 01:04:57,244
What...

843
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:01,290
Oh!

844
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:04,167
Stop! Look!

845
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:06,837
Look behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!

846
01:05:07,005 --> 01:05:08,797
It's stomping the town! I was right!

847
01:05:08,965 --> 01:05:11,967
- Sweet mother of God.
- Look, damn you!

848
01:05:19,684 --> 01:05:22,853
I am not a gun.

849
01:05:30,945 --> 01:05:32,821
Hey, Mom.

850
01:05:46,377 --> 01:05:47,628
Let's get out of here!

851
01:05:47,795 --> 01:05:48,962
Run!

852
01:06:00,308 --> 01:06:02,851
Hey. Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

853
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:04,394
Stop shooting!

854
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:07,689
Kent! He only reacts defensively.

855
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:11,068
If you don't shoot, he's harmless.
You gotta tell the General!

856
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:13,362
This is all your fault, beatnik.
If you hadn't...

857
01:06:13,529 --> 01:06:14,696
Would you shut up and listen?

858
01:06:14,864 --> 01:06:18,200
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.

859
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:20,410
I'll take care of it.

860
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:30,337
He says the monster's killed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at all costs.

861
01:06:30,505 --> 01:06:32,923
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!

862
01:06:34,384 --> 01:06:37,052
Mr. President, we have a situation, sir.

863
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:45,686
Watch it, lady!

864
01:06:58,074 --> 01:07:00,200
- Look out for the bus!

865
01:07:14,465 --> 01:07:15,966
You can fly?

866
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:19,720
You can fly!

867
01:07:25,643 --> 01:07:26,977
Hogarth!

868
01:07:28,438 --> 01:07:31,606
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
like Superman!

869
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:51,585
No, no!

870
01:07:58,259 --> 01:08:00,594
I've lost visual. Repeat, lost visual!

871
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:07,684
Man, that was close!

872
01:08:10,938 --> 01:08:12,189
No!

873
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:16,318
Ha. Gotcha!

874
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:35,879
Good call, Mansley.

875
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:40,717
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.

876
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:48,642
Huh?

877
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:05,534
Halt! Set your perimeter!

878
01:09:06,828 --> 01:09:09,246
- It's still alive!
- Shoot at it!

879
01:09:32,562 --> 01:09:33,937
Retreat! Retreat!

880
01:09:35,857 --> 01:09:37,566
Let's get out of here!

881
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,035
Hogarth!

882
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:53,415
He's unconscious, but he's okay.
Let's get him in the car.

883
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,585
Drive, baby, drive! Step on it! Floor it!

884
01:09:56,752 --> 01:10:00,297
It's gaining on us. Faster! Faster! Hurry!

885
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:12,100
All battleships fire at the robot!

886
01:10:12,268 --> 01:10:13,435
Now!

887
01:10:13,603 --> 01:10:15,228
Now, damn it, now!

888
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,448
Nothing can stop this thing!
We've hit it with everything we've got!

889
01:10:26,616 --> 01:10:28,575
Not everything, General. The bomb.

890
01:10:30,286 --> 01:10:32,954
The Nautilus has first strike capability
and is not far offshore.

891
01:10:33,956 --> 01:10:35,248
You scare me, Mansley.

892
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:38,168
You want us to bomb ourselves
in order to kill it?

893
01:10:38,336 --> 01:10:40,670
General, the giant seems to follow
whatever attacks it.

894
01:10:40,838 --> 01:10:43,590
We can lure it away from the town,
then destroy it.

895
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:48,970
Radio the Nautilus. Tell them to target
the robot and await my command.

896
01:10:50,765 --> 01:10:53,183
This is Nautilus.
What is the giant's current position?

897
01:10:53,351 --> 01:10:56,019
67. 71972 degrees west,

898
01:10:56,187 --> 01:10:59,189
by 44.50177 degrees north.

899
01:10:59,357 --> 01:11:00,482
Locked and loaded.

900
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:02,359
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

901
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:04,819
- Stop the car.
- Hogarth! My God, honey, you're all right.

902
01:11:04,987 --> 01:11:06,530
Go back! We've gotta help him!

903
01:11:06,697 --> 01:11:08,990
Are you crazy, kid?
You're lucky to be alive!

904
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:10,700
We're taking you to a hospital.

905
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,708
Everyone! Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.

906
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:20,961
What are you talking about?
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.

907
01:11:21,128 --> 01:11:22,295
What boy?

908
01:11:22,964 --> 01:11:24,172
Hogarth!

909
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:29,344
Hogarth, no!

910
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:42,065
Hey! No! Stop!

911
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:54,661
This is General Rogard.

912
01:11:54,829 --> 01:11:57,414
Ready the attack and prepare
to retreat to the fallback position.

913
01:11:57,581 --> 01:12:01,084
No! No! Stop! My son is out there!

914
01:12:03,671 --> 01:12:07,090
No, wait. It's me, Hogarth. Remember?

915
01:12:07,758 --> 01:12:11,720
It's bad to kill. Guns kill.

916
01:12:11,887 --> 01:12:14,222
And you don't have to be a gun.

917
01:12:14,682 --> 01:12:17,225
You are what you choose to be.

918
01:12:17,852 --> 01:12:19,811
You choose.

919
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,063
Choose.

920
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,483
Hogarth.

921
01:12:33,284 --> 01:12:34,784
It's okay. It's okay.

922
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:37,245
We gotta show them you're good.

923
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,251
Nautilus to Rogard,
missile armed and ready.

924
01:12:43,419 --> 01:12:45,045
What are you saying, he's friendly?

925
01:12:45,212 --> 01:12:47,756
Yes. Attacking him is triggering
a defense mechanism.

926
01:12:47,923 --> 01:12:50,675
Don't listen, General! Destroy the monster
while we still have the chance!

927
01:12:53,137 --> 01:12:55,430
General, you shoot and the whole thing
starts all over again.

928
01:12:55,598 --> 01:12:58,183
- Stop it now! Our future's at stake!
- Orders, sir?

929
01:12:58,351 --> 01:13:00,435
Which is why you have
got to stop, General!

930
01:13:00,603 --> 01:13:03,855
- It's getting closer! Orders, sir?
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

931
01:13:04,023 --> 01:13:06,608
- Hogarth!
- Hold your fire! The boy's alive?

932
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:08,026
It's a trick! Launch the missile.

933
01:13:08,194 --> 01:13:10,070
Are you mad, Mansley?

934
01:13:10,237 --> 01:13:11,863
All units, stand down!

935
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:14,074
Rogard to Nautilus. Come in, Nautilus.

936
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:16,034
This is Nautilus standing by.

937
01:13:16,202 --> 01:13:17,452
Launch the missile now!

938
01:13:25,294 --> 01:13:28,171
That missile is targeted
to the giant's current position!

939
01:13:28,631 --> 01:13:30,382
Where's the giant, Mansley?

940
01:13:30,966 --> 01:13:34,552
What... Oh...

941
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,138
We can duck and cover.
There's a fallout shelter right there.

942
01:13:37,306 --> 01:13:39,974
There's no way to survive this, you idiot!

943
01:13:40,142 --> 01:13:42,018
You mean, we're all going to...

944
01:13:42,186 --> 01:13:45,563
To die, Mansley, for our country.

945
01:13:46,649 --> 01:13:49,734
Screw our country! I want to live!

946
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,324
Hold him, men.

947
01:13:56,492 --> 01:13:59,703
Make sure he stays here,
like a good soldier.

948
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:04,833
Oh!

949
01:14:07,795 --> 01:14:10,338
- Oh, no.

950
01:14:13,217 --> 01:14:15,552
- Hmm?
- It's a missile.

951
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:20,098
When it comes down
everyone will die.

952
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:21,641
There it is!

953
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:40,744
- Shouldn't we get to a shelter?
- It wouldn't matter.

954
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,538
I fix.

955
01:14:50,212 --> 01:14:51,504
Giant?

956
01:14:55,676 --> 01:14:57,218
Hogarth.

957
01:14:58,345 --> 01:15:00,972
You stay.

958
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:04,601
I go.

959
01:15:09,565 --> 01:15:13,109
No following.

960
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:23,995
I love you.

961
01:15:52,483 --> 01:15:54,359
You are who you choose to be.

962
01:15:57,321 --> 01:15:59,697
Superman.

963
01:16:31,647 --> 01:16:33,106
Let's go home.

964
01:17:20,029 --> 01:17:23,156
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.

965
01:17:23,324 --> 01:17:25,700
You think this is my best? Really?

966
01:17:25,868 --> 01:17:29,662
Well, you know,
next to that bug, uh, thing.

967
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:33,166
You know, the one with the, uh, shovels...

968
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:37,295
Um, Hogarth?
Come on, honey. Time to go.

969
01:17:37,463 --> 01:17:40,214
- See you later, guys.
- See you later, Hogarth.

970
01:17:40,382 --> 01:17:42,800
Oh, hey, Hogarth, um,
the General sent this to you.

971
01:17:42,968 --> 01:17:44,177
What is it?

972
01:17:44,345 --> 01:17:46,721
He said it was
the only part recovered.

973
01:17:47,139 --> 01:17:49,182
He thought you should have it.

974
01:17:51,143 --> 01:17:52,727
I miss him.

975
01:18:41,944 --> 01:18:43,403
See you later!
