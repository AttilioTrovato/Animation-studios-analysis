1
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,375
Come on!

2
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,638
Father!

3
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,149
- Father, do you really have to go?
- I'm afraid I must, Kayley.

4
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,652
You know the king's knights
will be here soon.

5
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,488
Tell me again why you became a knight.

6
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,658
Kayley, you've heard it a thousand times.

7
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,161
But it's fine, dear.

8
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,623
Well, my daughter, before you were born...

9
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,501
...the land was dark and treacherous.

10
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,004
The people stood divided...

11
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,089
...brother fighting brother.

12
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,300
The only hope for peace...

13
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,470
...was in the legend of the sword Excalibur.

14
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,933
For it was said that only the true king...

15
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,603
...could pull this magical sword
from its stone...

16
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,438
...and unite the people.

17
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,023
Many tried.

18
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,776
All failed.

19
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,028
Then...

20
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,697
...on the very day that you were born...

21
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,034
...an unexpected hero stepped forth.

22
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,662
His name was Arthur...

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,042
...and he was the true king.

24
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,089
With Excalibur at his side...

25
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,716
...he led us out of the darkness...

26
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,718
...and together...

27
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,013
...we built the greatest kingdom on earth.

28
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,933
Everyone rejoiced.

29
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,461
Camelot!

30
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,343
And so these three rings represent
the unity of our kingdom.

31
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,470
As a knight, I took an oath...

32
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,015
...to protect Camelot, King Arthur...

33
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,683
...and Excalibur.

34
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,351
The knights are here.

35
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,689
I must go now, Kayley.

36
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,860
The king has summoned his knights
for a special day in Camelot.

37
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,780
Goodbye.

38
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,158
I'm coming with you, Daddy!

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,785
Yes, when you're old enough, Kayley...

40
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,455
...I will take you to Camelot. I promise.

41
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,999
I love you!

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,251
One day, I will be a knight...

43
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,961
...like Father.

44
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,048
Let's go!

45
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,447
"United we stand

46
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,366
"Now and forever

47
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,451

"No one shall be greater than all

52
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,135
"United we stand

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,804

"It's been ten years we celebrate

"All that made our kingdom great

"Liberty and justice

00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,705
"For all

63
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,709
"Each of us will now divide

00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,420
"In equal shares, our countryside

00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,923
"Promising equality

"No one shall be greater than all"

74
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,072
Liberty!

75
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,323
Justice!

76
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,574
Trust!

77
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,494
Freedom!

78
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,912
Peace!

79
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:52,955
Honor!

80
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,707
Goodness!

81
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,125
Strength!

82
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,252
Valor!

83
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,672
Me!

84
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,674
Charming sing-along.

85
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,926
Now let's get down to business.

86
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,721
I've waited a long time for this day.
What about my new land?

87
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,223
Sir Ruber...

88
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,725
...always thinking of yourself.

89
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,396
As Knights of the Round Table,
our obligation is to the people...

90
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,147
...not to ourselves.

91
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,734
The lands will be divided
according to each person's needs.

92
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,070
Then I need more than everyone.

93
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,531
I wouldn't have supported you
all these years...

94
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,492
...if I thought you were running a charity.

95
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,327
The king has decided!

96
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,538
Then it's time for the new king...

97
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,540
...and I vote for me.

98
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,959
I will not serve a false king!

99
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,919
Then serve...

100
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,713
...a dead one!

101
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,356
One day that sword will be in my hand...

102
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,401
and all will be mine!

103
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,282
Is he all right?

104
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,700
Sir Lionel?

105
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,422
Mother, listen.

106
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,132
Father!

107
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,328
No!

108
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,585
Your husband died saving my life...

109
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,171
...and saving Camelot.

110
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,548
Lady Juliana...

111
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,134
...the gates of Camelot
will always be open to you.

112
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,719
Sir Lionel...

113
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,264
...was my most trusted knight...

114
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,140
...and also...

115
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,184
...my dear, dear friend.

116
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:25,274
We will always remember how
he bravely upheld the ideals of Camelot.

117
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,296
"If you were with me now

118
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,923
"I'd find myself in you

119
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,844
"If you were with me now

120
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,556
"You're the only one who knew

121
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,018
"All the things we planned to do

122
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,356
"I want to live my life

123
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,444
"The way you said I would

124
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,156
"With courage as my light

125
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,158
"Fighting for what's right

126
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,660
"Like you made me believe I could

127
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,833
"And I will fly on my father's wings

128
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,462
"To places I have never been

129
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,257
"There is so much I've never seen

130
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,428
"And I can feel his heartbeat still

131
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,264
"And I will do great things

132
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,808
"On my father's wings

00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,567
"This world I'll never see

134
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,321
"My dreams that just won't be

00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,659
"This horse's stride with one-day's ride

136
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,995
"Will have covered more distance than me

00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,082
"And I will fly

"On my father's wings"

155
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,557
In the ten years
since Sir Lionel's death...

156
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,142
...equality...

157
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,810
...and freedom...

158
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,271
...have spread throughout the lands.

159
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,565
Excalibur...

160
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,903
...has given us the strength
to stand together against all injustice.

161
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,702
Camelot has prospered
beyond our greatest dreams.

162
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,589
It's a griffin!

163
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,273
- It's taken Excalibur!
- Arthur is wounded!

164
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,568
Never mind me!
Find Merlin and go after the sword!

165
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,998
Send word across the land:
Excalibur's been stolen!

166
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,547
Silver Wings...

167
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,465
...protect the sword!

168
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,953
Excalibur! It's been stolen!

169
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,753
No, absolutely not!

170
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,005
But, Mother, Excalibur is missing.

171
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,549
I must go after it.

172
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,009
That's a job for the knights,
not for a young girl.

173
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,678
But I want to be a knight.

174
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:32,140
I'll go on grand adventures fighting evil,
rescuing damsels in distress.

175
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,018
What is a damsel anyway?

176
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,938
Now, Kayley, stand still
and try on your new dress.

177
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,985
Mother, I don't want a new dress.
I want to save Camelot!

178
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:47,030
If you'd just let me, I know
I could find Excalibur all on my own.

179
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:50,868
The knights will find the sword
and they'll do it by working together.

180
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,661
While I'm working here...

181
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:56,498
...doing the chores, fetching the eggs,
taking care of the house.

182
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,791
Boring!

183
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,877
Where's the glory in that?

184
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,130
Kayley, one day you will learn
what Camelot means.

185
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,509
- Till then, you'll stay here with me.
- All right!

186
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,478
What would you do?

187
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,508
How am I ever going to do great things
if I'm stuck here...

188
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,427
...with these silly chickens?

189
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,898
Knock, knock.

190
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,192
Who are you?

191
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,111
Ruber!

192
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,530
Juliana.

193
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,116
I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd invade.

194
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,160
How about a little kiss?

195
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,954
I hear you're still single.

196
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,664
Impertinent pig!

197
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,123
Is that a "no"?

198
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,334
I demand you leave immediately!

199
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,669
So rude!

200
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,464
And after I came all this way
just to see you.

201
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,507
What do you want?

202
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,842
Camelot.

203
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,802

I'm so glad you noticed.

212
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,657

I think you'll find
you won't be able to resist!

Don't you dare harm her!

00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,237
Follow my plan...

224
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,283

in three days.

Take the main road. Get there before us.

- But, Mother...
- Go...

My faithful pet.

00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:01,738
How was the flight?

292
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,616
- Panic sweeps across the land.
- Precisely.

293
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,369
- My plan is perfect.
- Precisely.

294
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:10,372
- Without the sword, Arthur is vulnerable.
- Precisely.

295
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,040
Now Excalibur...

296
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,709
...is mine.

297
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,047
Here's where we enter a gray area.

298
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:21,675
Excuse me?

299
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,927
You lost Excalibur?

300
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,555
How?

301
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,558
- I was attacked by a falcon.
- What?

302
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:33,187
My magnificent beast outmatched
by a puny, little pigeon?

303
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,563
It wasn't a pigeon.

304
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,398
It was a falcon...

305
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,066
...with silver wings.

306
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,277
Silver wings? Oh, scary.

307
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,821
You stupid animal!

308
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,823
Where is the sword now?

309
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,577
In a place of untold danger.

310
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,663
The Forbidden Forest.

311
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,916
Precisely, Master.

312
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,335
Have I told you today...

313
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,004
...how magnificently and totally...

314
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,632
...worthless you are?

315
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,802
Excalibur is the one thing...

316
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,972
...that can keep me
from my conquest of Camelot!

317
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,935
No, not the girl!

318
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,812

...Fancy-Feet, get after her...

320
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,525

And you!

322
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,862
You are going to lead me...

323
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,365
...to Excalibur.

324

The Forbidden Forest.

We're not going
in there, are we?

340
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,948
- Chicken.
- But I got a wife and two eggs at home!

341
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:35,786
Hey, don't leave me here!

342
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,407
Hey!

343
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,826
That's my net.

344
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,422
Wow!

345
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,425
That was incredible...

346
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,888
...how you smashed those creatures,
how you avoided that thing.

347
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,891
You're amazing. You're...

348
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,603
...not even listening to me.

349
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,021
Great.

350
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,524
It took me six weeks to make this net.

351
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,151
Net? You saved my life. Thank you.

352
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,696
Well, anyone can make a mistake.

353
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,698
I get it.

354
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:40,369
This is where King Arthur sends
his unfunny jesters, right?

355
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,413
- And now I'll thank you.
- For what?

356
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,416
For reminding me why I'm a hermit.
Good day.

357
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,961
No, wait. What's your name?

358
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,295
It's Garrett.

359
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,797
I'm Kayley.

360
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,093
Why won't you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

361
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:59,680
I didn't realize you were...

362
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,181
What? Tall?

363
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,267
Rugged? Handsome?

364
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,269
Blind.

365
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,522
You know, I always forget that one.

366
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,904
Moving bush.

367
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:18,782
Not now, Ayden.

368
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,535
Look! Your falcon has silver wings.

369
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,204
Really? I'll have to take your word for that.

370
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,789
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

371
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,333
It means he knows
where Excalibur is.

372
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,460
Sure he does. In Camelot.

373
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,546
You know... big castle, lots of flags.

374
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,048
No, it's somewhere in the forest.

375
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,885
Ruber has stolen it
and he's taken my mother hostage.

376
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,636
That's why I'm here!

377
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,598
I must find the sword
and return it to Arthur...

378
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:45,058
...or Camelot and my mother are doomed.

379
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,688
Excalibur is here?

380
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:53,025
Right. We're going after it.

381
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,651
Great!

382
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,820
Not you. Me and Ayden.

383
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,780
We work alone.

384
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,867
I see no reason why I can't come along.

385
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,829
"I know the sound
of each rock and stone

386
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,501
"And I embrace what others fear

387
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,379
"You are not to roam

388
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:16,423
"In this forgotten place

389
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,552
"Just the likes of me are welcome here

390
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,848
"Everything breathes

391
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,392
"And I know each breath

392
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,645
"For me it means life

393
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,356
"For others it's death

394
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:35,067
"It's perfectly balanced

395
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,236
"Perfectly planned

396
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,072
"More than enough

397
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,824
"For this man

398
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,703

"I stand alone"

425
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,803
I stand alone, too.

426
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,097
Ayden.

427
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,267
I just need your help this once.

428
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,061
All right, all right!

429
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,605
But don't give me any trouble.

430
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,735
It's a fine mess you've gotten us into,
Ayden.

431
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,695
Hey, this isn't so bad!

432
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,786
I don't know why you made
such a fuss.

433
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:54,039
I've had a tougher time collecting eggs.

434
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,543
Trouble, trouble, trouble...

435
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,211
...with a capital "T."

436
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,763
You wretched,
mythological moron!

437
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,140
Where did you drop the sword?

438
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:17,229
It all looks so different from down here.

439
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,239
You! Report!

440
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,493
The girl and the blind warrior...

441
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:34,163
...are following a silver-winged falcon...

442
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,832
...who knows where Excalibur is.

443
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,334
They'll lead us right to it.

444
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:42,087
We're going after them!

445
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,301
You lookin' at me?

446
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,387
You lookin' at me?

447
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:05,694
Come on, men!
We must repair this tower.

448
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,743
Merlin, is there any news?

449
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,037
Have the knights found Excalibur?

450
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,663
I'm afraid not.

451
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,374
Then I'll go after it myself.

452
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,751
No!

453
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,253
You have to regain your strength.

454
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,256
Is there anything your magic can do?

455
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,635
You must rely on the courage
of your people.

456
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:49,196
Have you got a cold?

457
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,366
- What is it?
- We're in dragon country.

458
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,206
Right.

459
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,298
Are you sure
this is dragon country?

460
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,552
Shouldn't there be a sign or something?

461
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,345
It could say:

462
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,556
"Welcome to Dragon Country."

463
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,141
You don't think we'll see any...

464
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,393
...do you?

465
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,563
Is a group of dragons a pack or a flock?

466
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:26,149
Is it a gaggle or a pride?

467
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,234
Is it a herd?

468
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,403
- Quiet.
- Do you hear something?

469
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,072
No. I just want you to be quiet.

470
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:00,642
Garrett! Where are you?

471
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:14,573
- Dragons!
- Where? I don't see any dragons!

472
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,870
But you're dragons.

473
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,040
Heavens! Someone's found
our hiding place.

474
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,918
Shut up, Cricket Ball.
Let me handle this.

475
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:27,419
We are dragons!

476
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,505
Ferocious, hungry dragons!

477
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,882
So go away before we eat you!

478
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,347
Good show, Corny. That is clever.

479
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,098
Let me have a go.

480
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:43,101
Oh, great.

481
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,478
Bunny is dead.

482
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,233
They're probably cringing in fear.

483
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,154
Please don't hurt us.

484
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,950
And I thought you were
ferocious dragons.

485
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,618
Not exactly.

486
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:03,413
The real ferocious ones are those
fire-breathing bullies out there.

487
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:07,668
They're always picking on us, calling us
names, pushing us around. I hate them.

488
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,336
Easy with the stick, buddy.

489
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:10,587
What are you?

490
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:14,174
Well, frankly, we're the reason
cousins shouldn't marry.

491
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:19,346
Enchante, Mademoiselle.

492
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:20,931
I'm Devon...

493
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:23,934
...and this growth on my neck is Cornwall.

494
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,770
But you can call me "Corny," for short.

495
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,815
Yeah, short on wit, manners and charm.

496
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:33,318
- Everything I hold dear.
- How about holding your breath?

497
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,737
Come on, Kayley, let's go.

498
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,239
Hey, where are you going?

499
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,657
To save Camelot!

500
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,535
Camelot? The restaurants, the theaters...

501
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,620
The waitresses, the actresses...

502
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:44,788
The dragons...

503
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:47,332
The dragons?

504
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:05,142
Wait!

505
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:06,810
What is this?

506
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,479
Don't worry.
It's perfectly safe.

507
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,319
Safe?

508
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,989
So long as you don't step in it.

509
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:32,377
Garrett, hurry!

510
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,047
Do you think this is easy?

511
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,527
It's another dragon!

512
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,903
That's not a dragon!

513
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,279
It's a griffin!

514
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,323
And Ruber!

515
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,658
They found us!

516
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:05,911
Down here!

517
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,695
Are you sure we're safe down here?

518
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,322
It's a lot safer down here
than it is up there.

519
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,700
We know
all the best escape routes.

520
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,328
We've been dodging
those bullies since we were 200 years old.

521
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:51,290
- Were we ever that young?
- Of course we were, you moron!

522
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,292
- I'm not a moron.
- Yes, you are.

523
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,459
No, I'm not!

524
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:57,796
With all that bickering,
I'm surprised you haven't fried each other.

525
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,881
Fry?

526
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,716
We can't even simmer.

527
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:05,345
Yeah, you see, unlike most dragons,
he can't breathe fire or fly.

528
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,514
It's sad, really.

529
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:11,226
Excusez-moi, Mr. Self-Denial,
but we can't breathe fire...

530
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:12,644
...or fly.

531
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,105
Only 'cause you're holding me back.

532
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:18,400
If I didn't have you,
I could do a lot of things.

533
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,653
"I'd be rocking with the dinos

534
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,155
"Swinging with the rhinos

535
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,908

00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,163

00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:34,082
"I would love this world without you in it

"Well, how about if I didn't have you?

00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:46,553
"Oh, what I could be

544

"Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you"

545
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,518
Stop bickering
and get your act together.

546
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,602
"Act?"

547
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,562
Did someone say "act"?

548
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,105
I can act.

549
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:58,565
"If only

550
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:00,442

00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,784
"Of Camelot

555
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,120
"You'd be the half
that the whole world forgot

556
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:14,039
"If I didn't have you

557
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,958
"I should be so lucky

558
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,918
"If I didn't have you

559
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,128
"Oh, wait, you'd be dead

560
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:24,883
"Oh, what I could be
if there was only me

561
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:27,553
"Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you

562
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:31,598
"Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you"

563
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,976
Trapped, trapped.

564
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,520
Stuck here with you for 500 years.

565
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:38,647
Oh dear, it's learned to count.

566
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:41,733
If you'd got me a good lawyer,
I would've split 400 years ago.

567
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:45,112
Now, listen here, pal,
I didn't come here to be insulted.

568
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:46,947
Where do you usually go?

569
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,034
"I'd be a fire-breathing lizard
CORNWALL: I'd be one high-flying wizard

570
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,953
"You'd be nothing without me

571
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,997
"You'd be extinct, you'd cease to be

572
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,166
"I'm so tired of your nagging

573
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,376
"And I'm so tired of your bragging

574
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,503
"Without me, you'd have no brain

575
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,338
"With which to think

576
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:07,509
"I'd be rocking with the dinos

577
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,052
"Swinging with the rhinos

578
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,680
"I'd re-dragonize

"'Cornwall, ' they would sing

"'Cause I would be the dragon king

"If I didn't have you"

587
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,076
This way.

588
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,536
Let me lead.

589
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:37,539
No, this way, Twinkle-Toes.

590
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,458
"Life could be so sweet

591
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,293
"If these were both my feet

00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,799
"Oh, what I'd do if I didn't have you

595
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:54,515
"Oh, if I didn't

596
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,892
"Oh, if I didn't

597
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,394
"Have you"

598
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:03,649
Thank you very much.

599
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:07,778
- Devon just left the building.
- You've never sung before, have you, man?

600
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:13,033
- Come on, Garrett.
- You don't need him, honey.

601
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:16,328
Now you've got Cornwall
keeping an eye on you.

602
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:29,091
Well, the good news is...
we're out of dragon country.

603
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,678
The better news is...
this is where we say goodbye.

604
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,847
But, you can't leave us here.

605
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:38,392
If we try to go back we'll be banished,
ostracized...

606
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:40,602
...exiled.

607
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,272
Not to mention kicked out.

608
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:44,565
Why?

609
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:47,109
We just broke the dragon's cardinal rule.

610
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:50,112
What? "Never wear brown shoes
with a blue suit"?

611
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,780
No, you moron.

612
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:53,740
"Never help a human."

613
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,870
Come on, Kayley.
We must make camp before dark.

614
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:00,873
- Camp?
- Garrett, let's take them with us.

615
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:01,957
Please.

616
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,750
Oh, I suppose so.

617
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,836
But no more singing.

618
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,964
How do you feel about interpretive dance?

619
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,600
Dragon a la king.

620
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,980
It's such a pleasant relief from...

621
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,231
...chicken.

622
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:29,776
I can't believe I'm reduced
to chasing a little girl...

623
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,904
...a blind man...

624
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,572
...and a pigeon.

625
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:36,867
Find them all and report back to me.

626
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,746
Did you hear me?

627
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,707
Sorry, Master, my mouth was full.

628
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,000
Typical.

629
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:49,713
Of all the evil creatures in the world,
I had to find one with table manners.

630
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:51,381
And no mistakes...

631
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:54,718
...or I'll make space on the spit for you.

632
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:56,053
Hey, Useless!

633
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:59,306
Rendezvous with the wagons
and tell them to press on.

634
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,642
As soon as I have Excalibur...

635
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:03,310
...we'll join them...

636
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:05,604
...and the kingdom will be mine.

637
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:18,826
I'm starving.
All these heroics worked up my appetite.

638
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,537
Hey, something smells delicious.

639
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:25,582
Yes, I could whip up a little something.

640
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,126
Well, here's where we stop.

641
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,587
Stop? But what about Excalibur?

642
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:34,716
No one travels through
the Forbidden Forest after dark.

643
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,927
My father, Sir Lionel, would have.

644
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,930
Come on, baby, light my fire.

645
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:44,351
You know, there's nothing more pathetic
than a flame-retarded dragon.

646
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:48,272
Hey, Devon, you blew fire.

647
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:51,775
No, no, my mistake. Just hot air.

648
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,243
Kayley, I must tell you, I knew your father.

649
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:02,327
You did?

650
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:05,080
I used to live in Camelot.

651
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,291
I was a stable boy...

652
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,586
...but I dreamt of becoming a knight.

653
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:14,006
One evening, there was a fire.

654
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:18,635
I rushed to save the horses, but...

655
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,308
...I was hurt.

656
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,896
At first, all I could see were shapes,
then shadows.

657
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,107
Finally...

658
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,276
...my world went black.

659
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,488
After I lost my sight...

660
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:41,116
...your father was the only one
who still believed in me.

661
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:45,162
He taught me that a knight's strength
comes from his heart...

662
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:48,081
...and his loyalty to the Oath of Camelot.

663
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,503
"United we stand...

664
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,505
"...now and forever."

665
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:57,883
Any hope I had
of becoming a knight...

666
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,092
...died with him.

667
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,930
I felt that way too, but I knew
he would never want me to give up.

668
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:05,307
He wouldn't want you to give up either.

669
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,893
You're as good as any knight in Camelot.

670
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,978
You really think so?

671
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,944
Come here, Stick.

672
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,445
Come back, Stick.

673
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:24,952
I've got three words for you, Birdie:

674
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,662
Dinner is served.

675
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:35,546
And how did you find Ayden?

676
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:38,966
I didn't. When I came to live here,
Ayden found me.

677
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,010
He just appeared one day...

678
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:44,805
...as if destiny were watching over me.

679
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:48,976
He taught me all the secrets
of the forest, what can hurt you...

680
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,811
...and what can heal you.

681
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:56,400
With Ayden as my eyes,
I can survive anything.

682
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,360
Look, I'll show you.

683
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:02,239
I take my position...

684
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,575
...face my fears...

685
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,705
...and hold my ground...

686
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:12,332
...until the last possible moment...

687
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,169
...waiting for Ayden's signal...

688
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,629
...to evade.

689
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,757
Simple. Now you try.

690
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,218
All right. No problem.

691
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,470
- Take position.
- "Take position."

692
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,764
- Face your fears.
- "Face my fears."

693
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:32,269
And hold your ground
until the last possible moment.

694
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,322
You moved too soon.

695
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,580
- Behind your backs.
- Coming through.

696
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:52,998
Nice try, buddy.

697
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,792
I say, Kayley, do you have a light?

698
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:01,173
When I get my hands
on that girl...

699
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:15,771
Ayden's spotted Excalibur!

700
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,483
It must be near. Come on, let's go.

701
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:27,699
Look!

702
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,827
This must be from Excalibur.

703
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:31,495
But where's the sword?

704
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:33,372
Someone must have taken it.

705
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,583
Or something.

706
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:39,294
Now I'll never find Excalibur in time.

707
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:42,172
If we follow these tracks, we will.

708
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,424
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

709
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:47,135
- Yes. If we hadn't stopped...
- Quiet!

710
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,012
We should have kept going.

711
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,722
Shush!

712
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,724
I have to save my mother.

713
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:55,352
I need to hear.

714
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:57,688
Garrett!

715
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,148
Get them!

716
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,139
We're trapped!

717
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:48,447
My brave daughter...

718
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:50,282
...please be safe.

719
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,622
Nobody can stop Ruber's plan
to take over Camelot.

720
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,501
You don't know my daughter.

721
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:24,650
Please...

722
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,151
...don't die.

723
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:29,738
I can't do this on my own.

724
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,162
I'm sorry.

725
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,915
It's all my fault you were hurt.

726
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:43,168
I mean, I was rattling on
when I should have been quiet.

727
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,546
I'm no help to anyone.

728
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:47,881
Shush.

729
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:50,926
You're wrong.

730
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:56,014
"Look at the sky

731
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,475
"Tell me, what do you see

732
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:01,770
"Just close your eyes

733
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,897
"And describe it to me

734
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,776
"The heavens are sparkling

735
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,987
"With starlight tonight

736
00:51:12,114 --> 00:51:14,658
"That's what I see through your eyes

737
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,580
"I see the heavens

738
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:22,374
"Each time that you smile

739
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:25,586
"I hear your heartbeat

740
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:27,796
"Just go on for miles

741
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:31,049
"And suddenly I know

742
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:33,844
"Why life is worthwhile

743
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:37,181
"That's what I see

744
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,141
"Through your eyes

00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,270

"Through your eyes

00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:49,359
"Here in the night

748
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,029
"I see the sun

749
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:55,240
"Here in the dark

750
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,701
"Our two hearts are one

751
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:01,163
"It's out of our hands

752
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:02,998
"We can't stop

753
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,833
"What we have begun

754
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:08,712

"I see a night

00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:22,809
"I wish could last

00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:24,770
"Forever

760
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:27,856
"I see a world

761
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:30,108
"We're meant

762
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:31,819
"To see together

763
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,280
"And it is

00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:37,032
"So much

00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,076
"More than I

00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:41,787
"Remember

"Looking through your eyes"

780
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,982
Well, Master, we lost them again.

781
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:06,246
That's where they went.

782
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,713
- What is it?
- We've lost the tracks.

783
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:19,218
Tell me that was your stomach.

784
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:20,802
Just the ogre.

785
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:23,931
- Ogre?
- See you. Good luck. Have a nice life.

786
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:25,807
Whatever's left of it.

787
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,809
What's so scary about ogres?

788
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:31,063
Their appetite!

789
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:35,734
Oh, no,
I think it's Uncle Yorick.

790
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:37,986
"Alas, poor Yorick...

791
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,863
"...I knew him well."

792
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:45,035
Quick! Get out of the way!

793
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:56,213
It's the scabbard from Excalibur!

794
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:00,801
He does have the sword.

795
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:09,059
Ogres sleep in the day.

796
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:12,146
We'll wait for him to fall asleep,
then we grab the sword.

797
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:13,355
Define "we."

798
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:14,815
Shh! Quiet!

799
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:17,359
The slightest noise and we're finished.

800
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,070
Charming place.

801
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:22,281
I must get the name of his decorator.

802
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:23,615
What's he doing?

803
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:25,492
I don't see him.

804
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:26,660
He's here.

805
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,162
I can smell him.

806
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,418
You were right.

807
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:35,878
He is here.

808
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,797
Where is Excalibur?

809
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,301
He's using it as a toothpick!

810
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,303
Tell me when he falls asleep.

811
00:55:52,394 --> 00:55:54,646
Let me guess. He fell asleep.

812
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,108
- Describe the layout.
- There's a ledge...

813
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:00,527
...which hangs just above the sword.

814
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:03,155
But it must be a 20-foot drop.

815
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:16,335
Lower me down.

816
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:17,586
More.

817
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,966
- Hey, Boss, look! That's Excal...
- Shh!

818
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,929
I hate ogres.

819
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,556
Walk this way.

820
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,562
Oh, no. It's him!

821
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,912
Naptime's over.

822
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,581
Quick! Swing me back and forth.

823
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:57,167
You are getting very sleepy.

824
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:00,796
Sleepy.

825
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,215
Can you reach it?

826
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:04,842
I've got it.

827
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:33,453
The ogre's butt.

828
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,456
Well, Master...

829
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:39,376
...at least things can't get any worse.

830
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:42,212
Want to bet?

831
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:45,465
Whoa! Watch it!

832
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,346
Seize them.

833
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,056
Yes, Master.

834
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:58,228
There's no way out!

835
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:00,606
There's one way out! You'll have to fly!

836
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:03,817
We can't fly.
We explained that before our song.

837
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,195
"Houston, we have a...

838
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:07,613
"...problem! "

839
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:14,953
After you.

840
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:33,639
Ladies and Gentlemen: Please
put your seats in the upright position.

841
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:37,351
Assume the crash position
and hope you don't smell your socks.

842
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,520
Tray tables up
and put away your sandwiches.

843
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:40,604
Turbulence!

844
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,357
Hold on, gang. I think we're going in.

845
00:58:43,857 --> 00:58:45,859
Help! Mayday! Mayday!

846
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:56,203
We know you do have a choice,
so thank you for flying Dragon Air.

847
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:02,835
Tell you what, next time you try to fly,
and we'll hold on.

848
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:04,253
We did it.

849
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:07,214
We did it! I can't believe it! We did it!

850
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,508
Congratulations.

851
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:12,302
So this is Excalibur.

852
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:16,557
- Can I hold it? Give it to me!
- Please, let me hold it. Me!

853
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:20,477
No! Excalibur only belongs
in the hands of Arthur.

854
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:22,104
Come on, Kayley.

855
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:38,954
Garrett, do you think my mother's safe?

856
00:59:39,163 --> 00:59:41,999
If she's anything like you,
I'm sure she's fine.

857
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,377
We must hurry. There isn't much time left.

858
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,630
The first two-headed dragon in Camelot.
We'll be famous.

859
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:50,757
I can see us on the poster now:

860
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:53,468
"Presenting the wonderful Devon...

861
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,597
"...and his little head, Cornwall."

862
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:00,267
Garrett, up ahead...

863
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,685
...the sky.

864
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:05,481
The end of the Forbidden Forest.

865
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:11,069
It's okay.

866
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:13,071
You go ahead.

867
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:14,531
I'll be...

868
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:16,867
...right behind you.

869
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:21,497
Why don't you shut up?

870
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,000
How about: "Cornwall
and his Obnoxious Talking Wart"?

871
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,211
Knock it off.

872
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,254
I don't know what's eating this guy.

873
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:30,881
Envy, poor lad.

874
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:42,851
Camelot.

875
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:49,274
It's so beautiful!

876
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,820
I wish you could see it.

877
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:57,449
I have seen it...

878
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:00,035
...and there was no place for me.

879
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:01,954
Garrett, what's wrong?

880
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:03,914
Take Excalibur to Arthur.

881
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,749
You don't have much time.

882
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:11,797
But we'll deliver the sword together.

883
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,881
No.

884
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,592
You deliver it.

885
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:19,638
I don't belong in that world.

886
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,017
Come on, Ayden.

887
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:31,483
But you belong in mine.

888
01:01:37,156 --> 01:01:39,408
"Like every tree

889
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:43,162
"Stands on its own

890
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,000
"Reaching for the sky

891
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:50,127
"I stand alone"

892
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,589
You don't understand.

893
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:56,675
In Camelot, she'd only see me
through their eyes.

894
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:58,886
Not a knight, not a man...

895
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:01,680
...not anything.

896
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:04,516
"I share my world

897
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:07,144
"With no one else

898
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,731
"All by myself

899
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:15,402
"I stand

900
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:18,906
"Alone"

901
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,329
Forget about him.

902
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,122
You're better off alone.

903
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,750
He walks funny. He even looks funny.

904
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,335
People throw darts at him.

905
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,837
How could you be so cold-blooded?

906
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:35,506
I'm a reptile.

907
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,675
Listen, you Jurassic twit...

908
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,386
...Kayley deserves someone
who will love her.

909
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:44,097
Someone who'll hold her in his arms...

910
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:47,851
...who'll run his fingers through her hair...

911
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,854
...look deeply in her eyes and...

912
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:53,607
...make her feel like a real woman.

913
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,827
I got your tongue
on my gums!

914
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:16,755
I'm going back for Garrett.

915
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,426
I'll take that.

916
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:25,973
Excalibur.

917
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:28,267
Mine forever.

918
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:32,312
You've been quite annoying, for a girl.

919
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:36,859
Cheer up. In Camelot, we'll be kissed
by the world's most beautiful women.

920
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:39,653
Right. We're a giant lizard with two heads.

921
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:42,239
We'll have to beat them off with a stick.

922
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:45,868
Help! Help!

923
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,996
I've waited ten years...

924
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,956
...to hold this sword.

925
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,002
And now I'll make sure...

926
01:03:55,252 --> 01:03:57,087
...I hold it forever.

927
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:01,925
Prepare...

928
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,344
...for the dawning...

929
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:06,638
...of a new age!

930
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:09,892
No!

931
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,071
Chicken!

932
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,324
It's hot.

933
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:28,535
Don't worry, little girl.

934
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:31,205
I'll make sure Arthur gets it back.

935
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,457
Or gets it in the back.

936
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,627
As the case may be.

937
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:39,129
Throw her in the wagon.

938
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,218
Kayley!

939
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:45,344
Mother?

940
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,430
Thank heavens you're safe.

941
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,140
I failed you, Mother.

942
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:52,768
And now Camelot will be lost.

943
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:57,022
No, dear, you were brave.

944
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:01,860
What a touching reunion.

945
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,822
But all this love is making me nauseous.

946
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:07,407
And you've got a job to do, Juliana.

947
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,535
Remember, if you don't...

948
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,620
I'll do my job on her.

949
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:15,749
Don't lose hope.

950
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,843
Garrett, something awful
has happened.

951
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:27,678
We've got to go.

952
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:30,556
- Kayley's been captured.
- And Ruber's got Excalibur.

953
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:31,640
What?

954
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:33,809
Take me to her. Come on, Ayden.

955
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:36,436
They're halfway to Camelot by now.

956
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,357
Cornwall's right. We'd have to fly there
to get there in time.

957
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:43,402
Ruber drives me completely nuts!

958
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:45,737
He makes me so mad and angry!

959
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:48,490
He's definitely a jerk! A giant jerk!

960
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:50,951
That foul barbarian.

961
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:54,621
Wait till we get our hands on him.
I'll tear him limb from limb.

962
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:57,624
Yeah, we'll show him
a thing or two.

963
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:00,627
- Won't we?
- Yes, we darn well will.

964
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:02,212
You're flying!

965
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:04,965
Gosh, he's right! We are flying.

966
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:07,217
I did it!

967
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:08,844
I'm great!

968
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:10,679
I love me. I did it.

969
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,890
Excuse me, Egomaniac. You mean...

970
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,266
...I did it.

971
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:16,768
Don't you get it?

972
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:20,689
The only reason you can't fly is
because you can't agree on anything.

973
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:23,275
There must be something
you can agree on.

974
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,402
You both love Kayley, don't you?

975
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:41,585
Wagons approaching!

976
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,337
Not a word.

977
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:46,965
Let's all keep our heads, shall we?

978
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:55,015
It's Lady Juliana!
Lower the bridge at once!

979
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:09,404
Pardon me, my king.

980
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:11,990
Lady Juliana has paid us
a surprise visit.

981
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:13,367
Oh, good.

982
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,161
Tell her I'll receive her at the Round Table.

983
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:36,390
Steady.

984
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:38,100
Steady.

985
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:56,368
Bladebeak at your service.

986
01:07:59,538 --> 01:08:00,914
Lady Juliana?

987
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:02,791
It's a trap!

988
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:04,835
Attack!

989
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,051
Seal off the castle!

990
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:37,075
Ruber has breached
the castle keep.

991
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:39,328
The king is still inside!

992
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,539
Mother, I must help the king.

993
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:45,042
Don't worry! We'll be fine!

994
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:05,854
Garrett, you came back!

995
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:07,439
Heads up!

996
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:12,277
Sorry I'm late.

997
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:13,904
I hate flying coach.

998
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:18,867
You're flying!

999
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:21,286
Yes, we're frequent fliers now.

1000
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:24,289
Juliana?

1001
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,209
Ruber!

1002
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:28,794
Pleased to see me?

1003
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:32,506
A spear?

1004
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:35,300
How Stone Age!

1005
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:38,178
A king would hold a more noble weapon.

1006
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:40,180
A king would hold...

1007
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:43,016
...Excalibur.

1008
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:44,476
Where's Ruber?

1009
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,437
He has the king trapped inside.
There's no way in.

1010
01:09:47,521 --> 01:09:48,981
The king. Wait.

1011
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:52,067
I know a way.
Through the stables.

1012
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:00,784
Give me your hand.

1013
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:03,162
Jump!

1014
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:09,084
What are you doing?

1015
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,879
- I'm driving!
- Do you think that's a good idea?

1016
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:13,213
No problem!

1017
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:14,840
Hang on!

1018
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:16,884
Garrett, Garrett, on your left!

1019
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:18,343
Your other left.

1020
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:20,679
No, Garrett, right! Right!

1021
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,806
Look out!

1022
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:29,688
See?

1023
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,483
That wasn't so bad, was it?

1024
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,279
So many memories in this room.

1025
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:39,239
Makes me want to puke.

1026
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:42,743
You said everyone
at this table was equal.

1027
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:44,620
Well...

1028
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:46,872
...I have something sweeter:

1029
01:10:48,499 --> 01:10:49,917
Revenge!

1030
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,048
These tunnels lead to the Round Table.

1031
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,510
I can't see.

1032
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,095
Don't worry. I'll be your eyes.

1033
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,773
Finally, Silver Wings, you're mine.

1034
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:14,983
Well, excuse me.

1035
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:17,778
Pick on somebody
your own size.

1036
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:20,989
Let's barbecue this bully.

1037
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,116
I couldn't agree more.

1038
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:37,673
Hang on, little birdie.

1039
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,684
You've got to ask yourself:

1040
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:50,561
"Do I feel clucky?"

1041
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,646
Well?

1042
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,314
Do you, punk?

1043
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:05,450
I'm going to have more fun
getting rid of you...

1044
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:07,870
...than when I got rid of Sir Lionel.

1045
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:11,999
- I may not survive.
- Kayley, no!

1046
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:13,709
But you'll never destroy...

1047
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,252
...the ideals of Camelot.

1048
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:17,754
Well, I've got to start somewhere.

1049
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:22,009
Say hello to your new king.

1050
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,012
You're no king.

1051
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:27,097
You're right.

1052
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,682
Perhaps I'm...

1053
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:31,018
...more of a god.

1054
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:34,271
Hey, Ruber!

1055
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:35,564
You!

1056
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:38,150
I will not serve a false king.

1057
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:05,636
You.

1058
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:09,056
You're in the way, just like your father.

1059
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:13,352
Since you're dying...

1060
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:15,938
...to be like him...

1061
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,981
...let's see...

1062
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:20,067
...if I can help you out!

1063
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:28,742
Oopsy-daisy.

1064
01:13:28,826 --> 01:13:30,828
You probably needed that.

1065
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:36,458
Where is your pigeon now?

1066
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:42,005
Hold your ground
until the last possible moment.

1067
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:45,133
Yes, and you give the signal.

1068
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,219
Two for the price of one.

1069
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:50,764
This must be my lucky day.

1070
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:53,350
Now!

1071
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:56,311
Oh, no!

1072
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:57,771
The stone!

1073
01:15:14,932 --> 01:15:16,308
Kayley?

1074
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:18,602
You forgot this.

1075
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:22,940
Take it, it's yours.

1076
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:24,525
I dub thee...

1077
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:26,610
...Sir Garrett.

1078
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:28,195
I dub thee...

1079
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:30,405
...Lady Kayley.

1080
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:32,908
Thank you for saving Camelot.

1081
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:38,580
You have reminded us
that a kingdom's strength...

1082
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:41,124
...is not based on the strength of the king...

1083
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,252
...but the strength of the people.

1084
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:45,003
From this day forward...

1085
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:48,340
...you will both sit
as Knights of the Round Table.

1086
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:09,319
Isn't this everything you've ever wanted?

1087
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:11,280
Not quite everything.

1088
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,958
Don't even think about it.

1089
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:28,213
Well done, Ayden.
