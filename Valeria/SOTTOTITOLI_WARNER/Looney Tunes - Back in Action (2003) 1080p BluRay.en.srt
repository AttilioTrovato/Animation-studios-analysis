1
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:26,777
Shh.

2
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,489
Be very, very quiet. I'm hunting rabbits.

3
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,458
I am a duck bent on self-preservationum.

4
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,130
Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.

5
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,425
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season!

6
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:51,886
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season!

7
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,512
Rabbit season.

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,722
Duck season! Fire!

9
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,896
Fire!

10
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,028
<i>Hold everything.</i>

11
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,490
- "Daffy gets blasted." Mm-hm.
- "Daffy gets blasted."

12
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,077
"Daffy gets blasted again!"

13
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:20,039
What's the matter with you people?
We can't do this kind of stuff anymore.

14
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,665
Brothers Warner...

15
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,211
...show biz legends like me
shouldn't have to play stooge...

16
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,214
...to that long-eared,
carrot-chomping, overbite-challenged...

17
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:29,965
What's up, doc?

18
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,220
Hey, Bobby, how's the wife?

19
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,098
Great nose job, Chuck. Thanks, girls.

20
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,850
Good rug, Mel. Never would have guessed.

21
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,686
- Pardon me.
- The pleasure is mine.

22
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,357
Fellas, I think Daff's right.
Maybe I'll take a vacation.

23
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,901
Go visit my 542 nieces and nephews.

24
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,903
Mr. Duck, excuse me, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,157
I don't see how we can have
a Bugs Bunny movie without Bugs Bunny.

26
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,700
Oh, my heavens, no.

27
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,578
You couldn't have a movie
without Bugs Bunny.

28
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,624
And if you don't mind me asking,
whose glorified personal assistant are you?

29
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,293
Kate Houghton, Vice President, Comedy.

30
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,671
Right.

31
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,214
<i>Kate did Lethal Weapon Babies.</i>

32
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:14,176
Finally, a Lethal Weapon
that I can take my grandchildren to.

33
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,970
Um, gentlemen, check your phones.

34
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,598
Our latest research shows
that Bugs Bunny is a core asset...

35
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,978
...that appeals to male and female,
young and old throughout the universe...

36
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,231
...while your fan base
is limited to angry fat guys in basements.

37
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:32,111
Yeah, but... Come on, fellas,
I'm thrice the entertainer the rabbit is!

38
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,032
Fine, he's hilarious...

39
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,578
...but moviegoers these days
demand action heroes, like me!

40
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,503
Top that, rabbit.

41
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,219
So it has come to this, has it?

42
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,930
I'm afraid
the Brothers Warner must choose...

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,599
...between a handsome matinee idol...

44
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,436
...or this miscreant perpetrator
of low burlesque.

45
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,106
Whichever one's not the duck.

46
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,152
Hey, that's the stuff from my office.

47
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,279
- You don't have one.
- Not anymore.

48
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,948
Symbolically, this is bad.

49
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,284
Please, brother. Other brother?

50
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,245
Icy she-wolf? Help me, please.

51
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,207
I'm too moist and tender to retire.

52
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,542
- Let me escort you out.
- Wait!

53
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,337
I haven't tried toadying, kowtowing,
or butt-kissing yet.

54
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,088
I'm still begging here!

55
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,509
Freeze!

56
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,234
Can I try that again?

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,862
No, thank you. We'll call you.

58
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,662
- Sir.
- Hey, D.J. How did your tryout go?

59
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,624
Well, let's see.
Uh, I can say I made an impression.

60
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,877
Your father can get you a job
anytime he wants to.

61
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,214
I know, but I don't want that.
I'd really rather earn it, sir.

62
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,134
- Mr. Warner mentioned you this morning.
- He did? What did he say?

63
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,887
He said don't forget the TurtleWax.

64
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,808
What about animation?
I could do cartoons.

65
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,101
Dead duck walking.

66
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,852
- Morning, Mr. Bunny.
- Very hot now.

67
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,187
And I do voices. Listen.

68
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,438
- Excuse me.
DJ;Hmm?

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,791
"Fetch the stick, boy."

70
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,000
"What a maroon."

71
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,824
"You can't handle the truth."

72
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,987
Unh. Some grip, lady.

73
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,697
I need you to eject this duck.

74
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,992
- Lady, this is Daffy Duck.
- Exactly.

75
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,838
- Not anymore. We own the name.
- Oh, yeah?

76
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,538
You can't stop me from calling myself...

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,291
- What do you know?
- You fired Daffy Duck?

78
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,419
No, I didn't. Well, I did. They did.

79
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,379
You just were following orders.

80
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,966
You know what? You don't know me.

81
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,262
You're Kate Houghton,
you're the VP of Comedy. Go figure.

82
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:07,641
You drive a red 1988 Alfa Romeo.
Good engine. Little under-driven.

83
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,312
I know this
because you nearly ran me over last week.

84
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,107
Anyway, um, about that duck,
you want me to get rid of him still?

85
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,317
Hmm?

86
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,437
- Duck, yes. Eject the duck, please.
- I can't do that.

87
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,281
- Why not?
- He's gone.

88
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,247
What are you waiting for, backup?

89
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,421
- Daffy!
- Look, Mommy, there's Daffy.

90
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,840
Shabby job so far, constable.

91
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,009
Quick! After me!

92
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,387
Now you're gonna pay for that one.
Come here!

93
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,598
- Dress Inspector!
- Look out!

94
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,641
One side, Spartacuses.

95
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,022
- Come on.
- Daffy, stop!

96
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,441
Cut him off at the pass, boys.

97
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,778
All units in pursuit of little black duck.

98
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,743
Well, that's just cheating.

99
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,371
Daffy!

100
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,914
Come here!

101
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,166
<i>Autumn in fake New York</i>

102
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,675
Don't follow me.

103
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,393
That's not right. Cut. Cut!

104
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,939
That's lunch, everybody!

105
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,694
- That airbag cost a lot of money.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

106
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,532
Good morning. Batman, you good?

107
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,075
All right.

108
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,452
My chariot awaits.

109
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,954
Yes!

110
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,873
Bat-lights. Bat-conditioning. Bat-stereo.

111
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,626
To the Duck Cave.

112
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,795
- Now what are you doing?
- Hey.

113
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,090
- Stay away from that Batmobile!
- Come here.

114
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,384
I'm allowed to steal. I'm a celebrity.

115
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,052
Tell it to the judge!

116
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,805
- Feeling pretty good about yourself?
- I am.

117
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,269
- You bested that dastardly duck?
- I did.

118
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,398
And now you're gonna offer your catch
to the pretty executive?

119
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,732
Indeed.

120
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,236
Miss Houghton!

121
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,037
Get out of the way!

122
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,752
Look out!

123
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,476
Hey, what do you know? I found Nemo.

124
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,399
I think she likes you.

125
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,653
Oops.

126
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,328
Your father would be so ashamed of you.

127
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,972
But I was... It was...

128
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,688
At first, they told me to lose the stutter.
Now they tell me I'm not funny.

129
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,901
It's a pain in the butt
being politically correct.

130
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,736
You're telling me.

131
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,322
What kind of performance
do you call that?

132
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,450
You made me sound
like a total space cadet, man.

133
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:57,579
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I was trying to be real to your character.

134
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,707
If you, like, goof on me in the sequel,
I'm coming after you.

135
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,169
Yeah, and I'll give you a Scooby Snack!

136
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,798
There are some areas of the script
I think we need to address.

137
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:11,134
There's no heart, no cooperation,
nobody learns anything.

138
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,845
Daffy learns not to stick his head
in a jet engine.

139
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,723
- He's gone.
- No, Daffy always comes back.

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,684
I just tell him how much I need him.

141
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,728
We hug, we cry,
I drop something heavy on him, I laugh.

142
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,690
The duck is history, okay?
So the question is...

143
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,860
...how can I help you
reposition your brand identity?

144
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,490
We team you up
with a hot female co-star.

145
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,033
Usually...

146
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,661
...I play the female love interest.

147
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,997
<i>Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey</i>

148
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:44,501
About the cross-dressing thing?
In the past, funny. Today, disturbing.

149
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,754
Lady, if you don't
find a rabbit with lipstick amusing...

150
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,048
...you and I have
nothing to say to each other.

151
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,759
Look, I'm trying to be nice...

152
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,512
...but I was brought in
to leverage your synergy...

153
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,390
...and I am not going to let you
or some wacky duck...

154
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,600
Daffy-

155
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,228
Wacky, daffy, nutty, fruitcake,
crispy over rice, it doesn't matter.

156
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,188
Well, these matter.

157
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,107
And this.

158
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,111
And they say we get Daffy back.
Right, boys?

159
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,280
- We want Daffy!
- Bring him back!

160
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,698
We love Daffy!

161
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,872
Little Damian.

162
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,291
Hey, Granny.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,126
Hi, Tweety.

164
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,753
How was work today?

165
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,380
Eventful.

166
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,758
What a nice young man.

167
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,444
Guess who? So did you miss me?

168
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,450
- Hey.
- I'm glad I was fired.

169
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,411
In a few days,
they'll be kissing my befeathered rump...

170
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,372
...begging me to come back. But I won't.

171
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,540
Did I miss the part where I invited you in?

172
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,502
I'll be too busy accepting numerous,
multiple offers.

173
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,797
Every studio in town will... Hey.

174
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,510
Who am I kidding? My career is over.

175
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,471
Perhaps I was being too polite. Get out!

176
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,307
I'll starve. I'll have to eat envelope glue.

177
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,850
Wait, a sushi bar.

178
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,937
No!

179
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,944
- Daffy.
- Yes.

180
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,072
Leave my father's house. Now.

181
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,954
You live with Daddy?

182
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,457
Yeah, so?
Just, you know, kind of temporarily.

183
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,751
I've hit rock bottom.

184
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,964
I'm hanging out with a security guard
who lives with his father.

185
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,761
My grease and gravy!
Your dad is Damian Drake.

186
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,890
- The super spy.
- He's an actor who plays a spy.

187
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,645
- And that? That was his I Spy Award.
- Ingenious.

188
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:13,859
An actor playing a super spy as a cover
for being a super spy playing an actor.

189
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,778
In fact, <i>I'll</i> bet this whole dump
is a super spy lair.

190
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,405
Nothing is as it seems.

191
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,452
You know, you're probably protected by
an invisible force field right this minute.

192
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,456
Aha! The force field-penetrating apple.

193
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,750
Just feel free to continue
your delusional ranting...

194
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,169
...while I answer my...

195
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,130
Remote?

196
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,718
Hello?

197
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,846
Hmm.

198
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,565
<i>- Son?</i>
- Dad?

199
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,401
What are you doing in the painting?

200
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,404
<i>I wanted to keep you out of this,
but there's no one else I can trust.</i>

201
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,332
<i>- There he is. Stop him!
- Can you hold on</i> a <i>second?</i>

202
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,368
Are you shooting a movie or something?

203
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,412
A new Damian Drake movie? Cool.

204
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,539
<i>Come to Las Vegas.</i>

205
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,128
<i>Ask Dusty Tails for the Blue Monkey.</i>

206
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,130
The Blue Monkey? What's a Blue Monkey?

207
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,966
<i>A diamond. A very special diamond.</i>

208
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,593
<i>Find Dusty Tails.</i>

209
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,054
Hey!

210
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,307
Dad, you need me
to call the police or something?

211
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,683
Uh-oh.

212
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,937
- No. No police.
- Dad, are you all right?

213
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,231
<i>I'm sorry I never told you this before,
but I...</i>

214
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,363
- Dad?
- Diamond? I'm rich!

215
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,537
- I've joined the leisure class.
- I gotta go save my dad.

216
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,582
Oh, yeah. Your dad, yeah.
So count me in. A spy caper.

217
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,753
Double agents, exploding bikinis,
tigers hanging from helicopters!

218
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,839
I'm through with show biz!

219
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,091
From now on,
I'm gonna live the adventure.

220
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,885
- Next stop, Las Vegas.
- I'll take my dad's old car.

221
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,973
- Ah, a super spy car. Let's ride.
- This isn't a spy car.

222
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,018
Heh. Your dad is a spy. Ipso ergo, a spy car.

223
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,646
I used to deliver pizzas in this car.

224
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,440
Secret pizzas?

225
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,733
A spy pie, maybe?

226
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,697
Fine, be that way.
But it's definitely a spy car!

227
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,323
A little help here?

228
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,159
Ducks.

229
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,668
- Hey.
- Aah!

230
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,920
You know how I know it's a spy car?

231
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,382
Because it looks
absolutely nothing like a spy car.

232
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,652
<i>I don't think this routine
is gonna work without Daffy, but, uh...</i>

233
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,862
Action.

234
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,573
<i>Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.</i>

235
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,159
<i>- Duck season.
- Rabbit season.</i>

236
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,286
<i>- Duck season.
- Rabbit season.</i>

237
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,164
<i>- Rabbit season.
- Wait a minute.</i>

238
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,458
<i>See, I told you
this wasn't gonna work without...</i>

239
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,562
Can <i>we</i> do another <i>take,</i> please?

240
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,214
Oh, pain. Oh, agony!

241
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,091
- Ahh.
- You're fired.

242
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,385
What?

243
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,764
- But you...
- You got rid of our best duck.

244
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,393
You can't fire me.

245
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,813
My films have made $950 million!

246
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,733
- That's not a billion.
- Nope. Not a billion.

247
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,360
<i>Okay -</i>

248
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,030
All right.

249
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:51,534
I think we can all agree that the decision
to get rid of Daffy was a poor one.

250
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,744
But it's time to move on.

251
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,665
And by move on, I mean reversing course
and getting Daffy back.

252
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,458
By Monday.

253
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,420
I will have Daffy back on Monday.

254
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,966
That went well.

255
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:11,096
Listen, doll face, if I know Daffy,
he's already hit the road by now.

256
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,062
Ah, it's good to stretch.

257
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,481
I'm getting really tired
of throwing you out of the car.

258
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,900
That's my plan in a nutshell. Ha, ha.

259
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,654
Now, listen, if we run into anything
that requires super spy skills...

260
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,991
...like cracking wise, smooching dames,
you better leave that to me.

261
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,577
However, if we have
any security guarding needs...

262
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,664
Very funny, duck. I'm not a security guard.

263
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,542
For your information, it's just a job.
It's what I do for money.

264
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,294
- Mm-hm.
- What I really do is...

265
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,588
- I'm a Stuntman.
- Ha!

266
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,174
- You? A Stuntman? Please.
- I am!

267
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,178
Did you see those Mummy movies?
I'm in them more than Brendan Fraser is.

268
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,223
No, he couldn't stand that.

269
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,102
One day he decides that, "No, no, no!
The Bren-master does all his own stunts!"

270
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,355
Listen, muscles, if this heap ever makes it
to Vegas, I'll do all the stunts.

271
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,816
Duck here.

272
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,403
- Daffy, old chum, how the heck...
- Cram it down your rabbit hole.

273
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,532
I think I can get you your old job back
with less of a pay out than usual.

274
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,117
So not interested.

275
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,328
I'm off to Las Vegas
with my new sidekick D.J...

276
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,831
...to match wits with spies and Showgirls.

277
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,833
It's a little adventure I call:

278
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,711
"Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey."

279
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,796
And you're not in it.

280
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,300
Blue Monkey?

281
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,773
<i>Blue Monkey?</i>

282
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,003
<i>It's a little adventure I call:</i>

283
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,946
<i>"Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey."</i>

284
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,420
This is unacceptable!

285
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,011
We cannot have 9-year-olds working
in sweatshops making ACME sneakers...

286
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,223
...not when 3-year-olds
work for so much less.

287
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,435
- Yes.
- But, sir, they require naps.

288
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,272
Put double espresso in their sippy cups.

289
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,777
What's next on the agenda?

290
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,280
Where's my people? What's coming up?
What's the next thing? Aah!

291
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,577
Thank you, Bob.

292
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,913
Grave news, my friends.

293
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,999
Direct your attention to the video screen.

294
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,756
Cable, input, VCR, satellite.

295
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,551
<i>I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the...</i>

296
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,596
Input, satellite,
tape, menu, rewind...

297
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,306
...power, on.

298
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:07,188
Well, it seems that Damian Drake's son
knows about the Blue Monkey...

299
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,566
...and he is on his way to Las Vegas.

300
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:14,070
He must not find the location
of the diamond before we do.

301
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,031
How is the interrogation going?

302
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,789
<i>He's about ready to crack, boss!</i>

303
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,799
Cable, input, VCR and satellite, off.

304
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,677
We cannot let the good guys
win this time, people.

305
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,804
We must capture this son of a spy...

306
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,431
...and we must locate the diamond...

307
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,350
...and use its powers
for our own diabolical ends!

308
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,732
- Copy that to all departments.
- I didn't quite get that.

309
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,317
Didn't quite...

310
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,069
Uh, something about
capturing the son of a spy...

311
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,739
...and using the diamond's power
for our diabolical ends.

312
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,658
Be sure and use the laugh.
I like the laugh. Don't you?

313
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,702
- And what is your name?
- Mary.

314
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,329
Well, Mary...

315
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,041
...how'd you like to do a little kissing later?

316
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,837
That's what they all say at first.

317
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,717
Soon the ACME Corporation
will tower over all of creation!

318
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,344
All of creation!

319
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,308
- ACME.
- ACME.

320
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,060
- ACME.
- ACME.

321
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,564
Wait a minute.

322
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,110
- Yes?
- What about the duck?

323
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,661
Extra crispy.

324
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,131
Hello?

325
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,015
Hello.

326
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,273
Hello?

327
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,693
D.J., I'm not here to fire you again.

328
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,780
I just want to know
if that duck told you where he was going.

329
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:15,251
- Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
- Why are you torturing me?

330
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,879
What have I ever done that...

331
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,675
Great.

332
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,179
I just fired the son of our biggest star.

333
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,185
This has been a career-making day, Kate.

334
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,771
First you get rid of the duck
that everybody hates...

335
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,690
...but then, of course,
they all want him back.

336
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,445
And worst of all,
you get into a big fight with Bugs Bunny...

337
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:47,033
...who you revere and who you've tried
to model your life after.

338
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,204
Oh, I hate to see a grown man cry.

339
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,830
Especially when it's a girl.

340
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,501
Listen, toots,
would it stop the waterworks...

341
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:00,546
...if I told you Daffy was going to Las Vegas
with that guy D.J.?

342
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,258
It might.

343
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,596
Well, then,
how's about we travel in style in this?

344
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,519
Las Vegas, Jeeves.

345
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,480
<i>Taking you to Las Vegas.</i>

346
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:39,877
<i>Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire</i>

347
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:46,634
<i>Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher</i>

348
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:50,054
<i>So Viva Las Vegas</i>

349
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,058
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

350
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:58,396
<i>Viva
Viva Las Vegas</i>

351
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,985
You've got no music in your soul, sister.

352
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,446
I am aware of that, yes.

353
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,533
He sure went for all the extras.
What a maroon.

354
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,994
Don't touch anything.
This is Damian Drake's car...

355
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,580
- Let's see.
- No!

356
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,670
What does this one do?

357
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,843
<i>CAR'.
Shaken, not stirred, sir.</i>

358
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,846
It's 5:00 somewhere.

359
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:36,017
- If you touch one more thing...
- Shh. I'm about to defy you.

360
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,539
<i>- Now you done it.
- Arms at your side, please.</i>

361
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,449
<i>Formalwear activated.</i>

362
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,160
Enh, you clean up nice, kid.

363
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,038
- Oh, no!
- So...

364
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,831
<i>Viva</i>

365
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:03,002
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

366
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,132
Woo-hoo! Las Vegas!

367
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,737
Smell that, D.J.?

368
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,281
That's the sweet aroma
of money, glamour...

369
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,201
...and busload upon busload
of senior citizens.

370
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,970
Cool it, duck
This could be dangerous.

371
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:40,873
Right, we find Dusty Tails,
save your dad, get the diamond...

372
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,376
...apply kung fu liberally as needed.

373
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,298
<i>MAN'. Under no circumstances
are you to allow...</i>

374
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,843
<i>...the young Mr. Drake and his duck cohort
out of the casino in one piece.</i>

375
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,762
<i>- Is that clear?
- Okay.</i>

376
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,598
You want the varmints
and what they come for.

377
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,602
I got you. But what's in it for old Sam?

378
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,239
I 90'! you.

379
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,871
Did you know that Dusty Tails sang the
theme song to six Damian Drake movies?

380
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,081
I know. He's my father.

381
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,166
- Your dad is Damian Drake?
- Yes!

382
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,168
I'm kidding, relax. We did that.

383
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,338
I say, listen up, y'all.

384
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,758
Please put your greasy,
buffet-shoveling hands together...

385
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,302
...for our next act.

386
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,555
If you've heard her before,
you're not here now.

387
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,557
So, I say, let me introduce you...

388
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:42,560
...to Miss Dusty Tails.

389
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:50,610
<i>If you want it to be good, boy
Get yourself</i> a <i>bad girl</i>

390
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,371
<i>If you want it to be wild
Gotta know just who to dial, baby</i>

391
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,166
<i>That's me</i>

392
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:10,755
<i>If you really like it hot
Get someone who hits the spot, honey</i>

393
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,841
Oh, yeah

394
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,056
Hey. Dusty! Hey. Dusty.

395
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,017
Dusty, can I talk to you?

396
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,602
Dusty.

397
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:30,232
<i>Then get yourself a bad girl
Bad girl</i>

398
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,817
<i>If you really want</i> it...

399
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,211
What the...?

400
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,571
<i>Get yourself</i> a <i>bad girl</i>

401
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,449
<i>Bad girl
A bad girl</i>

402
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,535
<i>Get it like you could, baby</i>

403
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,162
What?

404
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,082
Dusty, I gotta talk to you.

405
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,502
- I'm Damian Drake's son, D.J.
- What?

406
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,130
How do I know it's you?

407
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,717
Oh. You are Damian's son.

408
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,969
Is there someplace we can talk?

409
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,475
- Excuse me, I have to change.
- Okay, toots, hand over the diamond.

410
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,061
- He brought a goose?
- It's duck, thank you.

411
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:10,022
- Uh, hi, uh...
- You again.

412
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,066
Listen up, you darn imbeciles!

413
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,402
We gotta get them varmints
and what they come for!

414
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,947
- And then we blast them?
- Then we blast them.

415
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,158
Now if I were a giant diamond,
where would I be? Ow.

416
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,868
- Well, not there.
- So...

417
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,788
- ...my, uh, dad's in trouble...
- Not here.

418
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:29,375
...and, uh, he said that
I should ask you about the Blue Monkey.

419
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,712
- So then you know?
- Definitely. Yes.

420
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,798
I figured something must have happened
when he didn't show up.

421
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,134
I'm sorry,
but that's what comes with being a spy.

422
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,930
So you're, um, a spy too?

423
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:46,475
Heh. The pop diva thing?
That's just one side of me.

424
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,437
I also work for the Agency.
Professional assassin.

425
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,647
It's really hard
trying to juggle the two sometimes.

426
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,358
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when I have kids.

427
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,445
Do you know how hard it is to find a nanny
with advanced weapons training?

428
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,199
Woo-hoo. How many galoshes died
to make that little number?

429
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,993
What about this Blue Monkey?

430
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,080
Your father was assigned to track it down
before the chairman could.

431
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,583
The diamond has supernatural powers.

432
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,502
It would be a disaster
if it fell into the wrong hands.

433
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,380
I was supposed to give him this.

434
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:20,509
This is not a king-sized diamond.
This is a queen of diamonds.

435
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,095
What kind of sick joke is this?

436
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,055
- Can I have that?
- Very funny.

437
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,891
That is so sweet.

438
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,351
You trying to take over for your father.

439
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,687
These evil forces? They're bad people.

440
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,940
Relax, sister. I don't know
the meaning of the word "fear."

441
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,525
Say your prayers, duck!

442
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,694
noun. A state of terror. Aah!

443
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,613
Incoming!

444
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,542
This mission
needs years of experience and training.

445
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,962
Maybe. I ain't got time for that right now.
I gotta go save my dad.

446
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,839
Don't lose that card. It's important.

447
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,966
After him, boys!

448
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,527
Easy on the feathers.

449
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:23,197
Come back here, you card-carrying coyotes!

450
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,409
Dadburn slapstick cliché!

451
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,705
Faster! Climb like my life depended on it.

452
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,918
You run, <i>I'll</i> steer.

453
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:40,297
- Right! I mean, left. Your other left.
- Daffy!

454
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,262
That's what I'm talking about!

455
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,223
Is that all you got?

456
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,227
That's gonna leave a mark.

457
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,107
That's not boxing. Bite his ear!

458
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:04,405
Left and a right and a left and a right-left!

459
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,285
I'm gonna come up on you.

460
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,337
<i>I'll</i> take that playing card.

461
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,097
- After it, stunt boy.
- Man.

462
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:31,891
Jump. Jump!

463
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,953
All right, I say,
place your bets, gentlemen.

464
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,498
Money plays, loser stays.
Everyone's a winner... Well, not everyone.

465
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,209
Here's my money. Now play.

466
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,420
- Card, sir?
- Hit me.

467
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,173
Don't you want to
look at your cards first, son?

468
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,051
Boy's about as sharp as a bowling ball.

469
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,720
- Hit me.
- No, hit me first!

470
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,889
I said await your turn, sir.

471
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,098
Hit me.

472
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,351
Hit me.

473
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,144
Hit me. Hit me.

474
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,479
- Hit me.
- Hit me.

475
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:23,400
- Hit me.
- No, hit me, fragnabbit!

476
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,404
- He's the boss.
- You son of a...

477
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,114
Card, sir?

478
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,991
Hit me.

479
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,993
Twenty-one, a winner!

480
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,453
Let's go!

481
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,750
"And then they made their heroic escape!"

482
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,300
I say we do Cirque du Soleil
and call it a night.

483
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,887
How about the Liberace Museum?

484
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,519
All right, let's see what this baby
can really do.

485
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,611
Now, that's an interesting feature.

486
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,280
Come back, you absconders!

487
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,700
- Aah!
- Watch yourself, ma'am.

488
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,327
I love this rug.

489
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:19,373
- Hey, come back here, you varmints!
- Run. Move. Go.

490
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,504
Nice car.

491
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,506
Don't hit me.

492
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:31,343
It's a modified Chevrolet
with a big 24 on the side.

493
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:40,060
Out of the way, fancy boy.
I'm a-commandeering this here clown car.

494
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,104
After them, boys!

495
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,522
Shotgun!

496
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,901
Rag-flagging ragtag Sidekicks!

497
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,990
Slow down, will you? I'm waddling here.

498
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,743
Come back, you darn idiot galoots!

499
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:04,918
There's gotta be 314 hotels
and 142 casinos in Las Vegas.

500
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,087
We are never going to find that duck.

501
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,886
Heh. Daff never misses a cue.

502
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,312
- What's up, duck?
- Don't you start with me.

503
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,522
Excuse me.

504
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,608
- You.
- You.

505
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:28,817
- You.
- Him.

506
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,194
- Her.
- Them!

507
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,612
Out of my way!

508
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,409
Dagnabbit!

509
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,163
- You are in big trouble, mister.
- Agreed!

510
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,628
Out!

511
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,422
What are you doing, kidnapping me?
Stop the car.

512
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,257
This is my adventure, bub.

513
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,183
- Coming through.
- Aah!

514
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:08,273
So, what brings you to Las Vegas?
You ran out of people to fire in L.A.?

515
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,275
You stole my duck.

516
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,946
- Your duck? Bah! I belong to the world.
- You know what? You can have him.

517
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,250
Dynamite? Who has dynamite?

518
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,085
Welcome to my world.

519
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,547
Hang on.

520
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,936
Throw it out the window.
Throw it out!

521
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,273
- But innocent people could be hurt.
- Throw it out the window!

522
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,942
It will send the wrong message
to children.

523
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,877
Didn't he used to be behind us?

524
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,227
We're having duck tonight, boys. Ha, ha.

525
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:31,607
Just a suggestion, but all those in favor
of not hitting that wall say "aye."

526
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,358
- Aye!
- Mother.

527
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,860
<i>CAR'.
Taking you to Mother.</i>

528
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,619
Uh-oh.

529
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,639
Look, a shooting star.
Quick, everybody make a wish.

530
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,644
You know, I'm beginning to think
that this one is the spy car.

531
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,853
What?

532
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,650
<i>CAR'.
ETA to Mother, 10 minutes.</i>

533
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,791
<i>Please return your
seatbacks to their upright position.</i>

534
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,044
So, what are your plans now, if I may ask?

535
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,546
Daffy will save us. He's the hero.

536
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,715
All right, bucktooth. Stick a carrot in it.

537
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,718
Everybody calm down, all right?
I can handle this.

538
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,899
Sell my Warner Bros. stock.

539
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,027
I got an inside tip
that Bugs Bunny is about to die.

540
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,035
Huh. Out of gas.

541
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,038
What? It doesn't work like that.

542
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,751
Thanks, toots.

543
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,598
- Enh, carrot?
- No, thanks.

544
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,317
You really think that playing card
is going to help you rescue your father?

545
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,027
Mm-hm. Yeah, I do.

546
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:44,281
Heh. You know this all sounds insane, right?

547
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,830
I remember the first time
I saw your dad in the movies.

548
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,667
- Yeah.
- 80 breathtaking.

549
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,092
Your hair smells nice.

550
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:09,681
- Hmm? You say something?
- No, just, um, saying good night.

551
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,018
I'm telling you, Daffy...

552
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,021
...I heard the Warner Brothers say
you were their best duck.

553
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:19,232
Flattered though I may be,
flattened I will not...

554
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,109
...in order for you to get the laughs.

555
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,819
H00-hoo! Yuk, yuk.

556
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,030
Barn! Wham! Barn!

557
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:28,450
- And your tail is on fire.
- Exactly my point.

558
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,744
No, really, your tail's on fire.

559
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,957
Ha, ha. Daff, you're accident-prone.

560
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,044
What am I talking to you for?

561
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:43,590
All you have to do is munch on a carrot,
and people love you.

562
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:55,185
I need you to move my 12:00 appointment
up to 2:00 and then back to 11:00.

563
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:59,022
Then just cancel it.
And I need you to get a helicopter and, uh...

564
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,233
No, don't put me on hold.

565
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,235
Oh, God.

566
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,073
I can't die out here.

567
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,075
This wasn't the plan.

568
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,994
After this comedy...

569
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,957
...I promised myself
I would only do real movies...

570
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:20,252
...about the human condition
crammed with social relevance.

571
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:25,757
There's nothing but a big rock
for 10 miles in that, that...

572
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,009
...that, and that direction.

573
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,264
I say we go that way.

574
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,184
Say, who are you kidding here?
We're goners!

575
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,437
Water! I can't die now.

576
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,607
Think of the millions of children
who want me to have the diamond.

577
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,609
The poor children!

578
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,236
Look at that.

579
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,409
Is it a mirage? Or just product placement?

580
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:55,829
Who cares? With shopping convenience
at such low prices.

581
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:59,499
Water, Fresca, Mountain Dew.
Your product name here.

582
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,461
Is this your idea?

583
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,006
The audience expects it.

584
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:09,426
They don't even notice
this kind of thing anymore.

585
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,723
Nice of Wal-Mart
to provide these Wal-Mart beverages...

586
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,934
...in return for us saying "Wal-Mart"
so many times.

587
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,649
Where's Yosemite Sam?

588
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,694
- What is your report?
- Boss, it wasn't me.

589
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:31,364
That razzan-frazzan duck
and that crazy son D.J...

590
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,867
...and a humina-humina Dusty Tails.

591
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,746
You know, that makes a lot of sense.

592
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,247
Thank you.

593
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:47,214
Mr. Drake, are you going to save us
the bother of eliminating your son?

594
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,133
My son is going to kick your evil butt.

595
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,303
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes, Dad.

596
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,264
- Desert operative.
- No.

597
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,850
Not a bad idea, Dad.

598
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,312
Our desert operative is due for a win.

599
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,746
I told you we should have
made that left turn at Albuquerque.

600
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:21,873
Don't start that again.

601
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,365
All right. Here's the plan.

602
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:59,744
We wait here for the next truck or car
or camel or whatever...

603
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,746
...and take Bugs and Daffy...

604
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,124
...get back to Hollywood
and finish making the movie.

605
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,834
What are you going to do?

606
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:09,588
- I'm just gonna keep walking that way.
- That's your plan?

607
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,676
Yep. That's the direction
the car was going.

608
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,604
You're not leaving me
while you make off with my diamond.

609
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,537
I don't wanna get too wrapped up
in your caper...

610
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:46,333
...but let's assume that you're right
and Damian Drake is a spy?

611
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,542
Super SPY-

612
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:52,213
Um, what's the point of just meandering
through the desert if...?

613
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:58,637
Here.

614
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,222
Be safe.

615
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,017
- Attaboy. Trust your instincts.
- Yeah.

616
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:08,313
Except for the water tower, the Batmobile,
the rubble known as Las Vegas.

617
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:13,234
There's nobody as rich, famous,
and powerful as my father...

618
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,029
...who just disappears into thin air.

619
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:24,704
Suddenly I feel like
I'm in Aunt Marge's Jell-O mold.

620
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,208
Guys, it's air-conditioned in here.
Come on in.

621
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:35,548
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

622
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:53,858
Easy. Whoa.

623
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,575
Earth freak.

624
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,584
Okay, buster. Where's Damian Drake
and that big diamond?

625
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:17,090
Cleanup on aisle three.

626
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,384
Can I be of service?

627
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,971
I am monitored to respond
to the name Robbie.

628
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:25,432
Hi, D.J.

629
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,059
At ease. I'm Mother.

630
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:32,063
Yeah, like the car said
that we would be meeting you.

631
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,690
How do you know my name?

632
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:36,067
D.J., I've known you
since you were this big.

633
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:41,072
That's not really possible, is it?

634
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,949
Must have been a photo.

635
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:45,326
Let me just take care of this, and we'll...

636
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,165
Give it to me straight.
How bad is it?

637
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,375
So shall we?

638
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,211
So little to do, so much time.

639
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:59,299
You're going to put him back, right?
I can't go back to L.A. with duck soup.

640
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:03,762
We do have the facilities
to reconstitute the body.

641
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,806
The mind, though,
will remain a gooey mess.

642
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,350
Uh, so about my father?

643
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,104
All in due time.
Lovely. Yes. Blow.

644
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:17,650
All right, break it up, fellas. Nice coats.
White is the new black, you know.

645
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:18,902
Yes.

646
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,862
Look.

647
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,490
- So this is Area 51, right?
- No.

648
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,701
The secret military base
where they keep the aliens?

649
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:30,830
No, Area 51 is actually
a paranoid fantasy we concocted...

650
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,958
...to hide the true identity of this facility.

651
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,461
- Which is?
- Area 52.

652
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,005
But don't quote me on that.

653
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:43,468
Oh, right. Area 52.

654
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,263
- So, uh, Mother...
- Call me "Mom."

655
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:51,142
Uh, Mom, what is it
that you do here exactly, anyway?

656
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,772
Creation, transubstantiation, destruction.
It's stressful. All kinds of things.

657
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:58,817
They're already here. You're next.

658
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,991
My God, what am I going to do with you?
You've done nothing but screw up!

659
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,617
You've walked off mesas.
You've been smashed by boulders.

660
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:09,452
You've been run over by diesel trucks.

661
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,872
Don't blame the equipment. It's good.
It's ACME equipment.

662
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,500
You're a coyote. Be wily.

663
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:20,004
All right, now.
Buck up and let's see a little smile.

664
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,174
Little bigger.

665
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,634
Little bigger.

666
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,304
That's nice.

667
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:33,184
Now, just go take a shower,
and don't come back till you smell better!

668
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,034
Be careful. There are men moving a safe
and I don't want you to...

669
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:41,067
And be careful
of the box of fireworks because...

670
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,865
I suppose I should mention
the plate-glass window...

671
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,830
It's tough being the boss.

672
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,003
Ah, a communication.

673
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,049
<i>Memo to Marvin the Martian.</i>

674
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,552
<i>Obtain the playing card,
and destroy the duck.</i>

675
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:12,515
<i>And when I say destroy the duck,
I mean kill him viciously and painfully.</i>

676
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:16,811
A mission? I'm all a-tingle.

677
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:21,107
So here we are
in the I-can't-tell-you-what room.

678
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:24,652
- Robert, can you take care of that, please?
<i>- Yes,</i> madam.

679
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,989
When you bring Daffy back,
could you make him 20 percent funnier?

680
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,909
- I heard that.
- What were we discussing?

681
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,077
This isn't about the giant ants, is it?

682
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:38,166
- Giant ants?
- Because they're not really ants anymore.

683
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,168
Tell me about the Blue Monkey.

684
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:45,715
How do you know about that thing
that I've never heard of in my entire life?

685
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,052
My dad told me.

686
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:54,223
What is the point
of making them pinky swear?

687
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,018
All right.

688
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,938
Now this tape will explain everything.

689
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,149
It was prepared especially for your father.

690
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,404
<i>Greetings, Damian Drake.</i>

691
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:13,034
<i>If you are watching this, you are aware
that the world indeed is in grave danger.</i>

692
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:17,413
<i>The ACME Corporation is in hot pursuit
of the Blue Monkey diamond...</i>

693
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,960
<i>...a supernatural gem with the ability
to turn people into monkeys...</i>

694
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,336
<i>...and then back again.</i>

695
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:26,589
<i>It is the ACME chairman's goal
to turn the population...</i>

696
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:30,885
<i>...into monkey slaves
to manufacture shoddy ACME goods...</i>

697
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:33,680
<i>...and then change them back to people
to buy the stuff.</i>

698
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,265
Unbelievable.

699
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,017
<i>Unbelievable, you may say.</i>

700
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:42,605
<i>Find it, destroy it, save humanity.</i>

701
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:43,815
<i>Ya y!</i>

702
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:47,235
<i>And remember,
no one wants to be turned into a monkey.</i>

703
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,241
So that's why.

704
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:58,496
Those guys came after my dad
because he was going to save the world.

705
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:02,792
So that means if I go after the diamond,
then the bad guys come after me.

706
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,920
Hang on.
You're not seriously thinking about...

707
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,798
Taking over your father's mission?

708
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,510
- I guess that would be all right.
- What?

709
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:17,140
Listen, if you're going to be a spy,
you'll need spy stuff.

710
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,561
So is this where you keep
all the high-tech spy gadgets?

711
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:25,189
Yes.

712
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,983
Oh, wow!

713
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:31,070
Oh, yeah, that's cool.
So I get to use all this stuff?

714
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,323
No, your stuff is over here.

715
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,910
But I really like the...

716
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,748
All right.
Looks like an ordinary cell phone.

717
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,084
Three-way calling, voice dialing,
downloadable ringtones.

718
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:50,465
- My phone does all that.
- Superconducting electromagnet.

719
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,301
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

720
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,054
GPS with mapping software...

721
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,848
...tip calculator, Game Boy.

722
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,224
Game Boy?

723
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,311
High-powered laser.

724
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:07,940
Polycarbonate rappelling line
with jet-propelled micro grappling hook.

725
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,069
Nose hair trimmer.
You always want to look your best.

726
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,739
Get over here, you idiot.
No, cold. Cold. Warm, warmer.

727
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,453
<i>Permit me, madam.</i>

728
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,456
Robert, darling. Excellent choice.

729
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:24,791
Swank pants.

730
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,043
And comfortable too.

731
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,547
Plus, liquid hydrogen rocket pockets,
here and here.

732
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,841
Hand stitching,
nuclear-powered crotch pad...

733
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,137
He'll be down in a moment.

734
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,351
Wakey, wakey, friends.

735
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:46,437
Time to wreak mayhem
in the cause of evil.

736
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:53,152
Mother, just one last question.
What's the deal with this card?

737
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:57,198
Well, that is the window
into what lies behind her smile.

738
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:58,407
What?

739
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:02,537
I'm sorry, our intelligence people
feel a need to code everything in a riddle.

740
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:07,416
They get some kind of perverse pleasure
out of it. I think it's corporate.

741
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:08,960
Fool humans.

742
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,796
Enh, looks like we got company.

743
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,134
Yipes!

744
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,177
Illegal aliens.

745
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,597
Exterminate them.

746
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:25,184
Darn. I knew this day would come.

747
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,063
Let us exterminate them.

748
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,738
<i>Emergency shutdown activated.</i>

749
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,905
<i>Force-barrier seal in 30 seconds.</i>

750
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,574
Exterminate.

751
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,287
The playing card, please.

752
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,415
<i>I'll</i> take that. Out of my way.
Hero coming through.

753
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,626
There is no escape.

754
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,508
You pesky fowl!

755
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,514
Yum, yum.

756
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:14,192
Isn't it about time to enjoy a frosty,
cold soda at the concession stand?

757
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,569
Exterminate!

758
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,614
Get the lead out. Bus is leaving.

759
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:23,367
Halt or be fricasseed.

760
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,793
That was fun.

761
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,587
Looking for this?

762
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,967
Now, what did she mean by a window?

763
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,888
The window into what lies
behind her smile.

764
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,016
That's the Mona Lisa.

765
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:50,144
- Which is in the Louvre.
- Which is in Paris.

766
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,397
Just how are we supposed to get to Paris?

767
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,815
Like this.

768
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,348
It doesn't look like
much of a window to me.

769
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,600
- Maybe the diamond is in the painting.
- Huh?

770
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,603
- All we have to do is steal the Mona Lisa.
- Way ahead of you.

771
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,896
No, no, no.

772
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:36,983
- No, you look, you don't touch, right?
- Yeah.

773
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,985
But I'm already in costume.

774
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,612
- That's a good look for you.
- Do you think so?

775
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,114
Wait a minute.

776
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,292
Aha! It is a window.

777
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,213
- Wow.
- It's an X-ray.

778
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,465
Heh. Sorry.

779
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,595
It's a map of Africa.
Maybe that's where the diamond is.

780
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:08,848
Hold it up. <i>I'll</i> take a picture.

781
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:11,267
Hey, can I take a picture? Please?

782
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:14,103
Come on, give me your phone.
I want to take a picture too.

783
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,022
Cheese it, the cops.

784
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,192
He's gone.

785
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,571
So let me take a picture, will you?
I want to take a picture too.

786
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,782
Come on, please? Can I hold the window?
Let me see the window.

787
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,492
<i>I'll take that!</i>

788
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,372
Um, what gives, doc?
We made 35 pictures together.

789
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,625
Well, as it turns out, I'm secretly evil.

790
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,336
That's show biz for you.

791
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:42,340
Now make with the card,
so I can please my dark masters.

792
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,425
Yes, sir. Queen of diamonds is your card.

793
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,553
Just put it back in the deck,
anywhere is fine. And oopsie-daisy!

794
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,057
- Aha! Is this your card?
- No.

795
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:54,185
- This?
- No.

796
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:58,064
- Run. This?
- No.

797
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,608
I said it's the queen of diamonds,
I tell you.

798
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,443
You mean, like this one?

799
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,740
Think we should go back and help him?

800
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:11,160
Nah, Elmer never gets Bugs.
It's a formula, but it works.

801
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:14,372
The great thing about movies,
you always know what will happen.

802
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,165
For instance, if this was a movie...

803
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,876
...you and I'd probably wind up together.

804
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,466
If you don't let go of me, I'll scream...

805
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,718
...but I'm not gonna stop screaming!

806
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,197
Well, this is surreal.

807
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:52,410
Stop or <i>I'll</i> fire.

808
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,496
Yikes.

809
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,697
Hello.

810
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:32,867
Oh, my.

811
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,744
Ladies, please.

812
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,509
Hey!

813
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,470
Gendarme!

814
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,600
There's a man there. He's got a woman.

815
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,519
She's tied up in a burlap sack.
He's taking her to the Eiffel Tower.

816
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:03,481
Ah, it is spring, is it not?

817
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:23,584
Ooh, I'm gonna blast you.

818
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:34,261
- Shh.
- Aw, shucks.

819
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:39,391
Ooh.

820
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:53,280
A technique
of using individual dots of pigment...

821
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,367
...which, taken together, make an image."

822
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:58,285
Oh, crud.

823
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:03,874
I think when you go to the movies,
you should learn something.

824
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:46,500
Ha, ha. Look at that clown here.

825
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,003
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

826
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,797
You.

827
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,465
- Huh?
- Come here.

828
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,054
- Wait a minute.
- I don't want trouble.

829
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:59,471
- What're you doing?
- I just want your pants!

830
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:07,855
Heh. That's right. I'm a vicious bird of prey.

831
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,102
He's got the camera!

832
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,367
Give the girl back!

833
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,876
- Enh, what kept you?
- You okay?

834
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:54,712
That was great.

835
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:05,514
I'd say it's a perfect day.
Except for the fact that we lost the map.

836
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,517
- We?
- All right, I'm the jerk who lost the map.

837
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:11,854
And I'm the bunny
who saved the card. Voilà.

838
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,606
Nice going, Bugs.

839
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,152
Africa.

840
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,113
Chair people, I reveal to you...

841
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,991
...the whereabouts of the Blue Monkey.

842
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,164
All right.

843
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:37,004
There's a duck in the middle of the map.
Remove the duck.

844
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,758
Remove the duck! The duck is in the...

845
01:02:41,008 --> 01:02:42,134
Duck!

846
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,474
Oh.

847
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:54,772
Now, we cannot let a boy, girl, duck, and rabbit
thwart our plans for global domination.

848
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,608
- Wanna bet?
- A wager?

849
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:02,237
Five dollars says my son will scuttle
your diabolical plans and save the world.

850
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,782
You're awfully spunky
for a man in your position.

851
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,453
How do you like that,
Mr. Slap Yourself in Your Own Face?

852
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,622
Give him a good zets
every once in a while.

853
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:12,998
My pleasure.

854
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:16,001
Now, I think I'm going to
hedge my bet.

855
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:19,046
I'm going to unleash
our most vicious operative.

856
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:33,268
Uh, Mr. Chairman, while we agree
that the Tasmanian Devil is quite vicious...

857
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:37,231
...if memory serves, he is also really stupid.

858
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,942
Really? So are you.

859
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,451
That's a good boy.

860
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,125
I withdraw my objection.

861
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,394
This would have been
a lot easier underground.

862
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:19,940
Come on, it's only another 6,000 cubits
in this here thick direction.

863
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:29,116
Look, Granny,
it's that nice boy from next door.

864
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:31,285
Little Damian.

865
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,079
How funny seeing you here, dear.

866
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,039
Hi, Granny.

867
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,625
Would you and your little friends
like a lift?

868
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:40,711
Giddyup, Dumbo.

869
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:45,841
Sure was a lucky coincidence
you showing up just now.

870
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,968
Yes, wasn't it?

871
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,322
I've discovered my roots.

872
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,991
I've discovered my lunch. Heh, heh.

873
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,330
Ow, ow, ow!

874
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,040
Cry freedom!

875
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:32,095
What a fantastic view.

876
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:33,742
Unless you're in the audience...

877
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:37,851
...in which case you've been staring
at an elephant's behind for 30 seconds.

878
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,189
My destiny awaits.

879
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:49,488
I guess this is our stop.

880
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:52,616
Enjoy the rest of your adventure, children.

881
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:24,064
This is the Blue Monkey?
This dime-store bauble?

882
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:27,567
- I've been rooked. Shafted by the gods.
- That shouldn't happen. Nice going, Daffy.

883
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,862
I demand recompense.
I want my diamond.

884
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,657
Where is my humongous rock?

885
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,370
Huh. Pressed duck.

886
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:49,006
- Hey.
- Unh.

887
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,882
- This looks like a puzzle piece.
- What?

888
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,011
Wait a minute.

889
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:10,110
Yipe!

890
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,159
Are we rich yet?

891
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,619
Kate. Any time now.

892
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,658
I'm rich. I'm affluent.
My liquidity is assured.

893
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:03,663
Daffy, get back here. Don't touch that!

894
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,624
Let go! Don't you dare!

895
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:08,335
- The rock is mine. So close.
- You mind?

896
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:11,713
Yes, I mind. I'm the hero.
I should get the treasure.

897
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,508
The girl too, but we'll discuss that later.

898
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:21,264
Careful.
Careful with my diamond. Easy, now.

899
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:32,234
Dad, this is for you.

900
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:42,828
Why, D.J., why you? Why wasn't it me?

901
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:45,580
Just academic curiosity, you understand.

902
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:48,333
Well, gotta go. Bank closes at 5.

903
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,878
- Come on, Daffy, change him back.
- All right.

904
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,172
Buddy pictures.

905
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,970
- D.J., pal, you're okay.
- Yeah.

906
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,014
Give me that.

907
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,976
- I liked you better as a monkey.
- Thanks.

908
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:09,187
That is so sweet.

909
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:12,774
Now if you could just
hand over the diamond.

910
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:18,446
Immediately!

911
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,032
My turn.

912
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,583
Pardon.

913
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:34,212
- I've come for the diamond.
- I knew it was you.

914
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,966
Oh, you knew it was me, did you?
You're wrong. Because I'm not me.

915
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:39,718
I'm actually...

916
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,096
I can't. I can't reach over the hat.

917
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:46,183
I'd rehearse back at ACME,
but I never wore the hat.

918
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,186
And now the hat is throwing me off.
Would you...

919
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:52,314
Thank you very much. Now, I'm actually...

920
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,276
Your father.

921
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,154
- Dad.
- Saw that one coming.

922
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,156
Look into your heart, D.J.

923
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:05,327
- You know it's true.
- No, it can't be true.

924
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,120
You're right, it isn't.

925
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,124
Let's do some drills.

926
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,793
This doesn't make a lick of sense.

927
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:18,131
Ha, ha. Well, who's laughing now?

928
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:22,969
Well, apparently, no one.
Anyway, give me the Monkey!

929
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,763
No, forget that, man. You're evil.

930
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:28,308
Thank you, but...

931
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:32,896
Anyway, Mr. Smith,
let's show this muscle-bound beefcake...

932
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,482
...who I have sometimes been mistaken for...

933
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,109
...what it's like to live in the real world.

934
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:45,617
Have you ever been disintegrated in one
place and then reassembled in another?

935
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,202
Fire away.

936
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,335
Oh, no, you don't!

937
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:09,391
Ooh.

938
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:28,201
I thought they fixed that glitch.

939
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:31,371
Mr. Smith is fired!

940
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:33,957
I have to do everything myself
around here.

941
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,754
- Ah, good.
- You...

942
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,054
Henchmen.

943
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,347
Dad.

944
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,683
So this is the remote that works.

945
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:56,187
Now, this, my friend,
is the ACME Train of Death...

946
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,648
...which is not good news for your father.

947
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,191
<i>Don't worry about me, son.</i>

948
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:02,652
<i>I've gotten out of worse scrapes
than this one.</i>

949
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,572
You see, if the Train of Death
doesn't kill him...

950
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,074
...then those crates of TNT will.

951
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,744
Not to mention
the 2-ton anvil hanging over his head.

952
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:13,997
And, oh, look.
There's the Pendulum of Doom.

953
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:17,042
What's the Pendulum of Doom
doing there? I did not order it.

954
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,627
It's overkill. Get rid of it.

955
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:25,175
Now, if you want to
keep your family "together"...

956
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:28,803
...I would hand over the Blue Monkey now.

957
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:32,974
<i>Don't worry, son. I'm fine.</i>

958
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:41,358
- You're a sick man, you know that?
- Get used to it.

959
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,361
Excuse me? What about my father?

960
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,653
Oh, heh.

961
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:49,407
- He's waiting for a train.
- What? You...

962
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:50,950
Where's Marvin the Martian?

963
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:55,663
Ah. All right, here is the Blue Monkey.
Go put it on the satellite. Go!

964
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,584
Oh, no, you don't, eight ball.

965
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:18,269
Ha. You'd never catch that rabbit
being this heroic.

966
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:23,024
- Enh, what's up, doc?
- You're despicable.

967
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,591
Vandals.

968
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:56,766
Your friends' efforts will prove to be futile.

969
01:13:56,933 --> 01:14:00,812
You see, here is the Blue Monkey,
here is the ACME satellite.

970
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:04,649
When the Blue Monkey
is finally docked in the satellite...

971
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,319
...I will transmit a beam around the world...

972
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:11,948
...which will transform
everyone but me into monkeys.

973
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,492
Now take them away!

974
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,744
Don't you think that'll get lonely...

975
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:20,999
...Mr. All My Friends Swing from Trees
and Pick Fleas Out of Their Furry Butts?

976
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:25,336
Lonely? I suppose I could use
a little human companionship.

977
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:27,213
Thanks a lot.

978
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,757
I've seen you notice me.

979
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,051
- I know I'm hot.
- Ew.

980
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:36,222
But I prefer someone
with a little more oomph.

981
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,267
I prefer Mary!

982
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,106
Hello, Mary.

983
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,753
We're a cute couple, don't you think?

984
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,612
Now take those future simians away
and lower the Monkey shield.

985
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:11,090
Earthlings have the worst
sense of direction. Aah!

986
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:15,887
What do you know, he fell for it.
I guess I owe you <i>5</i> bucks.

987
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,448
Uh, did you order satellite?

988
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,450
Enh, I don't even have cable.

989
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,380
You know, when I fired that duck...

990
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:52,423
...I never would have seen this coming.

991
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,551
Gotta be a way out of this.

992
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:58,179
You can get out of this, son.
You've just got to set your mind to it.

993
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:01,307
Besides, I'm hearing my dad's voice
in my head.

994
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,561
Actually, I'm down here, son.

995
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,237
Hold on, Dad, <i>I'll</i> be right there!

996
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:19,826
That was too easy.

997
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,963
What was that noise, son?

998
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:38,553
- You know how I always wanted a dog?
- Yeah?

999
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,762
I just got one.

1000
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:56,112
Wait. Maybe he wants to play fetch.

1001
01:16:56,779 --> 01:17:00,617
- Nice mechanical doggy.
- Good dog. Want to play?

1002
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:04,203
Good boy. Fetch!

1003
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,301
It looks to be
a deadly mission requiring strength...

1004
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:20,428
...cunning and nerves of steel.

1005
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:23,389
So good luck, Bugsy,
<i>I'll</i> keep the engine running.

1006
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:26,851
You tricked me!

1007
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:28,519
Enh, what's up, Darth?

1008
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,939
Now I must incapacitate you
with my bubble gun.

1009
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,900
Ain't that cute?

1010
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:39,030
Of course you realize this means war.

1011
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,379
Uh, you go that way. I'm gonna go this way.

1012
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:11,270
Bad dog! Sit!

1013
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,940
Don't want to put you
under any added pressure...

1014
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:17,360
...but judging by the vibrations
of these train tracks, I've got about...

1015
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,570
...one minute and 42 seconds left.

1016
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:21,572
Down! Put him down.

1017
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:34,001
What am I gonna do?
What would Damian Drake do?

1018
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:35,920
What would Duck Dodgers do?

1019
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:38,297
Wait a minute. I am Duck Dodgers!

1020
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,342
Yes, I'm going to be the hero
of this picture!

1021
01:18:41,509 --> 01:18:43,761
Duck Dodgers to the rescue!

1022
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:49,308
Duck Dodgers to the rescue!

1023
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,520
Duck Dodgers.

1024
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:55,690
Duck...

1025
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:02,864
Aha! It's you-know-who to the rescue!
It helps if you don't say the name.

1026
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:09,954
Bad dog!

1027
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:09,430
Disgusting Earth rodent.
Now to neutralize that duck.

1028
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:18,397
Oh, this can't be good.

1029
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:26,989
Now the diamond will bathe the Earth
in a monkey-transforming glow.

1030
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:31,327
Ten, <i>nine,</i> eight, seven...

1031
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:34,747
<i>...six, five, four...</i>

1032
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,708
<i>...three, two, one.</i>

1033
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:42,088
Thwarting evil
makes me so angry.

1034
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:49,720
Well, that takes care of that. Yipe!

1035
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,736
Enh, thanks, Daff.

1036
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,283
Darn dark side!

1037
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,911
Are you all monkeys yet?

1038
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,789
Uh-oh.

1039
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,681
Checkmate, Mr. Chairman.
You're going down.

1040
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:39,145
Say it.
Just a little "You're my hero"?

1041
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:41,192
- Nope, sorry.
- Bugs, say it, come on.

1042
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,595
Uh-uh. Not interested.
- No one will ever know.

1043
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:44,859
Nope.

1044
01:21:47,737 --> 01:21:49,989
I'm really proud of you, D.J.

1045
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:52,533
I knew I could count on you.

1046
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:54,952
Yes.

1047
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:58,456
Dad, I think we should move.

1048
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:03,669
- What was wrong with Beverly Hills?
- I meant from this spot.

1049
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:26,067
- I think we scratched it.
- Don't worry, it's a rental.

1050
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,361
You guys, you pulled it off!

1051
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:31,113
- You pulled it off, all right.
- Give me that.

1052
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,657
Way to go, Daffy-

1053
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:35,159
You didn't do so bad yourself, stunt boy.

1054
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:36,619
To set the record straight...

1055
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:40,456
...all credit for saving the human race
goes to Daffy.

1056
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:41,832
Exactly.

1057
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:44,669
Oh, no, you don't, buster. You're the hero.

1058
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,587
- You're the hero.
- You're the...

1059
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:51,008
Wait a minute. Pronoun trouble.
I'm the hero.

1060
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,635
I'm the hero, all right.

1061
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:55,012
Are you gonna introduce us, D.J.?

1062
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:58,265
- Dad, this is Kate. Kate, this is...
- Damian Drake.

1063
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:03,396
I'm a really big fan of your son.

1064
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:06,941
Well, Daff, you achieved your goal
of being a hero.

1065
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:09,527
Yep, but you didn't achieve your goal...

1066
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:13,322
...of getting me back in your stupid movie.
Aha!

1067
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:16,200
- Cut. Print. That's a wrap.
- That's it, guys.

1068
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:18,911
Remind me to get a new agent, will you?

1069
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,329
Thanks.

1070
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:23,582
Wait a minute. Maybe we are a team.

1071
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:27,336
Bugs and Daffy. No, Daffy and Bugs.
What do you think?

1072
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,176
Excuse me, do you remember me?

1073
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:37,513
I, uh, threatened your manliness,
and you got me fired?

1074
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,807
Oh, I know you.

1075
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:41,350
Do I know him?

1076
01:23:41,726 --> 01:23:45,271
You must be someone that I got fired.
See, I get a lot of people fired. Ha, ha.

1077
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:49,692
- You be good now.
- So like I said...

1078
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:55,489
Not again. He's down again.
Are you okay?

1079
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:57,825
- Come on.
- He said he can do stunts.

1080
01:23:57,992 --> 01:23:59,452
Bugs is here. Gotta go.

1081
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:00,953
Daffy, you're right.

1082
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,247
- The usual place, Mr. Bunny?
- Very good.

1083
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:07,251
From now on, you and I are going to be
equal partners in this thing.

1084
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,503
No more second banana for you.

1085
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,840
Thanks, pal. I really appreciate this.

1086
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:15,426
At last my star is rising.

1087
01:24:15,593 --> 01:24:18,554
All my hopes and aspirations... Whoops.

1088
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,936
What do you know?
My luck is changing already.

1089
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:36,822
