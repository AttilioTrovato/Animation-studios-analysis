1
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:55,235
Dad, you have the coolest job.

2
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:59,949
I should hang out with
a better class of animals.

3
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,744
Oh, come on.

4
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,123
Have some class.
We got mixed company here.

5
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:15,381
You know, genetically speaking,
monkeys are our first cousins.

6
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,969
Uncle Bob's kids?
I'd agree with that.

7
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:21,553
No, I'm serious.

8
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:25,808
Some scientists say their diets
are more evolved.

9
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,477
This is about diets again, huh?

10
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:33,274
You should eat more fruits and
vegetables. Like monkeys do.

11
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:38,862
Honey, the reason that monkeys
eat so many fruits and vegetables...

12
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:42,658
...is because they're not
smart enough to butcher a cow.

13
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:46,996
Your mother, bless her soul,
didn't believe the old ideas...

14
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:49,623
...about nursing and breast-feeding.

15
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:52,668
You were fed cheeseburgers as a baby.

16
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:56,171
And you're as strong as a bull.
Smell like a cow.

17
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,675
High cholesterol,
but there's medicine.

18
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:03,679
An angioplasty clears it out.
You're great, honey.

19
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:10,436
I'll start working out tomorrow.

20
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:17,443
-I'll take better care of myself.
-So you'll go on the hike with me?

21
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:21,572
First things first. Eat your lunch.
We'll talk later.

22
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:26,368
Give me that egg, pal!
Give me the egg!

23
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:29,705
Dad, stop it! What are you doing?

24
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,874
It's my egg! Come on!

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,420
It's just an egg!

26
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,799
Okay, now I gotta choke you!

27
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:50,476
Now who's evolved?

28
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,188
All that salad slow you down, buddy?

29
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:58,901
That's filthy.

30
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,945
Ten-second rule:

31
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:04,573
Hits the ground, you can
eat it within 10 seconds.

32
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:43,570
-Saliva one, what have you got?
-An egg 2-20. E-Gamma-Gamma. Over.

33
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,364
-Any mayo?
-Affirmative.

34
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:46,573
Slow bowel traffic....

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,202
Enzyme breakdown in ten.

36
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:54,081
When I was a rookie cell,
you could eat off this place.

37
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,874
Look at it now. Jeez...

38
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,793
...what a disgrace.

39
00:03:58,002 --> 00:03:59,795
See anything, kid?

40
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,672
I do.

41
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,467
Nice genes. Got chromosomes
in all the right places.

42
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:08,595
-Jones.
-A toothbrush can handle this.

43
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:11,765
I wish you'd take this job
more seriously.

44
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:14,643
You see this badge?
You see this gun?

45
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:18,564
See this gooey sackus membranous
around my personhood?

46
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:22,568
-Here we go again.
-You dealing with a white blood cell!

47
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:28,032
I should fight disease in the veins!
Not here, on tartar control!

48
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,034
Lucky you ain't in a scab.

49
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:32,369
We got germs on that egg.

50
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:34,830
Baby! It's Ozzy time!

51
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,000
Probably gingivitis,
don't get carried away.

52
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,794
You have entered the city of Frank.

53
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:43,547
Hands up.
Surrender for digestion.

54
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:47,217
Saliva one, requesting
ground support. Over.

55
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:50,512
Bicuspid four,
we're in the vicinity.

56
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:54,058
This is a private organism.
Don't run.

57
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,518
Up spit creek without a paddle.

58
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,690
Don't get me mad.
I will turn into a germicidal maniac.

59
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,276
Halt. Saliva Patrol.

60
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,695
Son of a botulism!

61
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:09,198
They swiped the patrol car !

62
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,367
Get out of here.

63
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,954
You done done it now.

64
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,628
Holy Frank!

65
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:26,048
He's about to yawn!

66
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:31,887
We're getting sucked in!

67
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:34,723
I told city hall we need more sleep!

68
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,101
Hold tight, kid!

69
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:40,354
Osmosis Jones to dispatch.

70
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:43,857
We got multiple germs
coming down the windpipe.

71
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:47,695
If they hit the blood stream,
we'll be illing.

72
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:50,406
Nose-dripping,
chicken-soup-drinking...

73
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,950
...rectal-thermometer-sticking,
illing!

74
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:54,910
-Permission to pursue?
-Chief.

75
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,793
-You got plans for the weekend?
-Oh, yeah.

76
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:06,588
Me and my girlfriend are going
to the Kidneys to see the Stones.

77
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,841
Good, they could pass any day.

78
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:13,262
All units south of the stomach,
look out for illegal organism.

79
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,723
Jones, you want to keep your job?

80
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:17,558
Wait for backup!

81
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:18,851
I can get them.

82
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,477
I said stay put.

83
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,563
-Over.
-You heard the chief.

84
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,523
Out of our jurisdiction.

85
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:28,736
It's lmmunity's problem.
We should get to the mouth.

86
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:32,656
-Hey, Jones!
-Chief, you'll thank me later.

87
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:36,368
Don't think about it.
You're in enough trouble.

88
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:38,120
Jones!

89
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,002
Slow down! Slow down!

90
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:48,255
Wait, wait, what the--?

91
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:51,508
Shouldn't you be up in the mouth?

92
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:54,970
This is my bust. I saw him first.

93
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:22,039
You want Osmosis? You got Osmosis.

94
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:33,509
Bye-bye, cop!

95
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:39,139
Sorry, baby. But it's time
you take your medicine.

96
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:53,612
Dang. Always pulls to the right.

97
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,166
Dad, what's wrong? Oh, my God.

98
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,085
It's a cramp!

99
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:19,388
Officer down.

100
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:24,018
These stairs are killing me, honey.
We may have to move.

101
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:27,104
But, Dad, there's only four steps.

102
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,691
All right, if you love it here...

103
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,818
...I'll build a ramp.

104
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:47,750
It's been three hours since lunch
and we're still cleaning up this egg.

105
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,378
Man, would you look at all that gunk.

106
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:52,588
Seriously.

107
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:56,634
Does he roll his food
on the ground before he eats it?

108
00:08:57,134 --> 00:09:02,389
We need to send a letter to the mayor
about washing our hands before we eat.

109
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,855
Like he's going to listen to us.

110
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:12,900
Hey, cells vote, man.

111
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,693
Cells vote.

112
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:29,917
Got you, you little... .

113
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:35,923
Artie?

114
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,926
What's going on over there?

115
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:11,959
Holy spit.

116
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,631
Careful, I'm contagious.

117
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,943
I don't like!

118
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,002
I'll turn up the heat in here.

119
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,605
Connecting, please hold.
One moment.

120
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:15,898
Now connecting.

121
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:20,361
Mr. Mayor, how will you deal
with the fat-cell housing shortage?

122
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:25,324
I'd like to announce we're beginning
construction on a third chin.

123
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:27,451
We're having jock itch!

124
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,078
Any comments on today's cramp?

125
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:32,831
What about the hair cells
laid off from the scalp?

126
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,918
There'll be plenty of new jobs
on the back.

127
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:39,797
What about the request
for better nutrition?

128
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:43,926
85%%% of red blood cell children
don't know how to carry oxygen.

129
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:46,887
People, people, you worry too much.

130
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:49,556
The body is in perfect shape.

131
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:55,479
No more questions. Thank you.

132
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,068
Do they know I work hard?

133
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:02,444
Nobody cares.

134
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,239
-Mr. Mayor--
-Leah, I've got a body to run.

135
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:09,410
-I've got Tom Colonic's new ad.
-Let's go, put it on.

136
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:13,247
This is a paid announcement.

137
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,420
The bowels didn 't always
smell this way.

138
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:22,256
Eating right and ex ercise...

139
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:25,175
...kept this area
a center of activity.

140
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:28,846
But during Phlegmming's term,
rot and stagnation...

141
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,806
...paralyzed this neighborhood...

142
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,767
... the colon, and the sphincter.

143
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:36,895
It's time we get things moving again.

144
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:40,482
I'm Tom Colonic.
As mayor, I'd set long-term goals...

145
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:43,694
... that include salads
and eating bran.

146
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:48,365
Mayor Phlegmming may think
things are fine the way they are.

147
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:53,245
But if we pull together
and put in a little hard work...

148
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:57,833
...a new Frank could be
right around the corner.

149
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,544
Mr. Colonic? What's that smell?

150
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:04,423
That's the smell of change, Billy.

151
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,468
The smell of change.

152
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,136
Paid by Colonic for Mayor.

153
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:12,681
Can you believe those lies?

154
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,561
He's got a point. You promised
to focus on health issues.

155
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,896
I want health...

156
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:23,359
...but think of the sacrifices,
the hard work and lack of chips.

157
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:25,736
That's not what voters want.

158
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:29,323
-Why are you behind in the polls?
-Don't you worry.

159
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:32,910
I have a plan to flush Colonic
down the toilet.

160
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,412
Honey.

161
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:38,999
Shane.

162
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,169
Coming!

163
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:46,048
You okay? Where does it hurt?

164
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,175
Leg.

165
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,885
Is it here?

166
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:51,387
A leg.

167
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:53,555
Here?

168
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:55,849
Leg.

169
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,563
Here.

170
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,320
I just needed some sodium.

171
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:10,864
That's what made me cramp up.

172
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:15,577
Heads up!

173
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:18,956
Chicken going down rough.
Going down rough.

174
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,209
Oh, now what?

175
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:26,672
Sir, turn on the optical feed.

176
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:30,968
Let me take a look, Dad.

177
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,304
Open wide.

178
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:35,681
Open wide.

179
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:40,227
Could you swallow first, please?

180
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,361
Definitely red.

181
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:54,783
Are you ordering out?

182
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,870
I'm making an appointment
with the doctor.

183
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,291
Sick? We're not getting sick!
We have far too much planned.

184
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:13,469
You can't override without
a vote from city council.

185
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:15,971
Yes, my dear.

186
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:19,099
voice manual control on.

187
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:24,730
-That's only for emergencies.
-Leah, this is an emergency.

188
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,482
On second thought...

189
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:28,400
On second thought...

190
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:32,279
-...l'll take a cold pill.
-...I'll take a cold pill.

191
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,326
Uh, sir?

192
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,996
Thank you. Get me the chief.
There's a good girl.

193
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,839
" Drix enol. "

194
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:02,685
Next.

195
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:06,146
I caught him with six micrograms
of adrenaline.

196
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:09,066
It's not mine.
I swear, it's my cousin's.

197
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:14,321
Yeah, I never heard that one before.
Take him to lockdown. Next.

198
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,075
Hey, it's "the Germinator! "

199
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:23,289
You got me there.
Save some for the criminals.

200
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:27,710
-You never catch anything, Jones.
-You should've seen this thing.

201
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:29,878
It's no ordinary germ.

202
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:33,007
This thing ain't even
from Frank's body.

203
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:36,552
This is like a AI Roker germ,
a Heavy D germ.

204
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:39,013
Talking about this?

205
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,436
Yeah, he's slouching right now.

206
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:46,979
In my office!

207
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:52,109
-Chiefy-weefy, what's up?
-Don't "chiefy-weefy" me.

208
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,527
See the headlines?

209
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:58,574
The papers call it the most powerful
cramp since Shane made us try Tae-Bo!

210
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:02,494
-Hold on a second.
-I told you to wait for backup!

211
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:05,831
But again, you had to
do it your own way.

212
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,875
-Man, I could have--
-Right!

213
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,669
Trillions of cells
working together...

214
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:13,422
...you're the only one doing it alone.

215
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,799
That's your problem, Jones.

216
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:20,054
What?! Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.
The missus? She's great, yes.

217
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:22,681
What? I'll put a man right on it.

218
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,684
Yes, sir.
Stupid political decisions.

219
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:27,061
Now where was l?

220
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:29,647
You said you were giving me...

221
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:32,858
...a promotion to
Head of Brain Security.

222
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:37,905
You know what? You're right.
Maybe it is time I give you a case.

223
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:39,657
Talking about what?

224
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:42,368
I'm putting you on a job
in the throat.

225
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,206
Thank you, chief. Thank you, chief.
You won't regret this.

226
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:50,376
You a good man.
You a upstanding man.

227
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:53,879
-Whatever.
-It was on the fence for a while.

228
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:58,467
"Good man, bad man. "
Now it's official: You are a good man.

229
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:02,721
You done? Now our pill
is getting swallowed as we speak.

230
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,350
So get your nucleus
down to the stomach, pronto.

231
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,269
Pill? What pill?

232
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:12,147
I wouldn't trust you to
handle a sore throat alone!

233
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:17,069
Get out. Or you're on butt-hair
patrol for the next three years!

234
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:30,124
Rinky-dink, stink, pinky pill.

235
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:35,504
The white zone is for ingestion and
digestion only. No parking.

236
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:39,216
Peanut boarding
for intestine and liver...

237
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:42,928
... with direct service
to the colon.

238
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:44,596
Now boarding.

239
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:50,060
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna....

240
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,690
All right.

241
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,655
All fat cells
proceed to love handles.

242
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:05,659
Oh, yes, Mr. Mayor.

243
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:07,870
No, sir, it hasn't arrived yet.

244
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:12,207
What the--
Look out now.

245
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,798
Did you look at my notes
on your speech?

246
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:21,300
The in-box.

247
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:25,304
Yes, it says "in" on it, sir.
I'll check back later.

248
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,014
All right, goodbye.

249
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:31,810
Well, well, what do we have here?
Somebody been working out!

250
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:34,480
Leah, you looking fine.
Mighty fine.

251
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:38,150
Did they have to assign you to this?

252
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,487
Spit. Wasn't my idea,
but now I like it.

253
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,572
Baby, when are we hooking up?

254
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:47,368
I know a spot behind the eye,
has a perfect view.

255
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:51,705
Perfect for a little rendezvous
between me and you.

256
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:56,293
Do you know what I'm saying?
I been saying it a long time.

257
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:59,338
Why would I ever go out with you?

258
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:03,592
What? I'm a legend!
The chicks line up to divide with me.

259
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:04,885
Oh, really?

260
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:08,430
You look like a cell
who divides with himself.

261
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:13,018
Who cut off the heat?
Somebody pay the bill! It's cold.

262
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:18,274
Now arriving with some milk, a cold
pill with a pleasant fruity flavor.

263
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,737
Wow, this is huge.

264
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:27,283
Don't be all impressed.
It's 99%%% sugar.

265
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:30,244
Yeah? And 99%%% of you is just stupid.

266
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:33,330
Like I haven't heard that one before.

267
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,256
What is that cherry stank?

268
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,472
Special agent
Drix obenzometaphedramine.

269
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:55,561
"The brand that eases
your coughs and sneezes. "

270
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,148
Don't ex ceed dosage.
If symptoms persist, see a physician.

271
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:01,609
May cause drowsiness.
Do not operate machinery.

272
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:04,361
Pregnant women shouldn't handle pills.

273
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,988
I feel better already.

274
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:09,366
-You can call me " Drix. "
-Welcome to Frank.

275
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:12,077
I'll examine your irritated areas.

276
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,455
Never on the first date, Drips.

277
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:16,165
-Drix.
-I said that.

278
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:19,877
-You said " Drips" with a " P. "
-Whatever.

279
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:25,549
This ain't working. I'll ask
the chief to assign someone else.

280
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:26,717
Wait.

281
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:29,470
Hold up. I need this job, Leah.

282
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,805
Just give me a shot.

283
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:37,311
All right. But no screw-ups, you dig?

284
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,149
I promise everything will be fine.
Not as fine as you, but fine.

285
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,695
Man, what you been eating?

286
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:49,365
That's my effervescent propulsion.

287
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:53,786
We're driving with the windows open.

288
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:57,164
I don't want bubbles
stinking up my ride.

289
00:21:57,373 --> 00:21:58,624
You got that?

290
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:03,462
Look what you're doing to my baby.

291
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:07,257
Don't touch my radio!

292
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:12,805
Where you from?

293
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:16,517
The University of Chicago,
graduated Phi Beta Capsule.

294
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:19,478
Great, got me a college boy.

295
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:22,064
FDA-certified for colds and flu...

296
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:26,068
...and a master's in Symptom Relief.
Where'd you study?

297
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:31,240
I grew up on the wrong side of the
digestive tract. No fancy schools.

298
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:34,535
My high school was crack central.

299
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,748
No, it was in the crack!
Right in the stanky puckered center!

300
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:45,587
We lived on peanut butter
and cellulite sandwiches.

301
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:48,257
Ever blow-dry your hair with a fart?

302
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,718
-Okay, you were poor.
- You bet!

303
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:54,263
Ever make a snowman from paper
cling-ons? That's poor!

304
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,140
You'll make me vomit.

305
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:59,643
We couldn't afford vomit,
that's for rich folks.

306
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:03,314
-I have to wipe my eyes.
- Wanna talk about wiping?

307
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:10,904
You're all new so follow my lead,
all right?

308
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:15,951
Wait up! Didn't they teach you
manners in that lvy League petri dish?

309
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,789
Murphy, it's flaring up again!
Give me a status on the pain relief.

310
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:23,959
Foreign substance in upper....

311
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:28,464
Inflammation and glandular swelling.
We meet again.

312
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:33,135
Dougy-Doug, the firebug!

313
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:34,803
My boy is hot!

314
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:38,515
Osmosis Jones.
Like I don't have enough problems?

315
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:41,185
Start redirecting traffic over there.

316
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:44,438
I'm in charge of this
sore throat, baby.

317
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:47,942
-You're kidding me.
-No. Straight up. What we got?

318
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,110
It's a routine sore throat.

319
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,739
Looks like a saliva boat
went haywire and crashed.

320
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:56,450
Saliva boat? That's pretty unusual.

321
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,119
Knock down that hot spot, ladder team!

322
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,039
Step away.

323
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:06,502
The tamperproof seal is there
for your protection.

324
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:54,049
Not my suedes!

325
00:24:58,137 --> 00:25:00,014
What the dilly?

326
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,076
Por favor, don't shoot!

327
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:24,872
La Muerte man esta aqui!

328
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,707
He'll kill us, hombre!

329
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:30,127
Talk English, man.
We ain't on Telemundo here.

330
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,590
La Muerte Roja!
He's coming, man. I saw him.

331
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,760
I saw him. I saw him!
La Muerte Roja--

332
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:42,723
When your body 's full of aches
A Drix enol is all it takes

333
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:45,559
Ex cuse me! What are you doing?

334
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:47,770
I'm soothing the irritation.

335
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:51,440
You just soothed my witness
into a germ-cicle.

336
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:56,153
Don't worry, he'll be normal
in a few days.

337
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:57,821
That's too late.

338
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,783
He has information on what went down.

339
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:04,203
Nothing "went down. "
It's a common sore throat.

340
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:06,622
This is a crime scene.

341
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:15,089
Want to be useful? Plug some
Turtle Wax into that thing...

342
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,174
...and wash my car!

343
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:21,720
Now that's inflammation relief.

344
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:23,430
Later, Doug.

345
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:25,599
Be cool, Oz.

346
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:37,820
How's it feel working with
the two dumbest animals in the zoo?

347
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:41,115
-Not bad.
-It's okay.

348
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:43,742
I'm talking to the camels.

349
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:50,249
They're talking to the camels.

350
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,501
Ex cellent.

351
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:58,173
I'm so psyched for this long weekend.

352
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:59,967
Getting out of town?

353
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:03,345
I'm not getting out of my bathrobe.

354
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:08,559
I'll get a keg and plop myself down
on the sofa in front of the Tv.

355
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:11,478
Some quality time
with the wife and kids.

356
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:16,066
What's that smell?

357
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,112
That's Bruno. His tummy's still upset.

358
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:25,284
No, I'm talking about that
nasty, skanky, sweaty smell.

359
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:28,621
Shane won't buy me deodorant anymore.

360
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:31,081
She says it causes cancer.

361
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:46,555
Did the foot fungus pay up yet?

362
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,391
No, that guy's getting flaky on us.

363
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,355
You ain't going to collect
nothing from him up here in the pit.

364
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:58,233
Now get down there,
send him a message.

365
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:08,285
So, this is where the scum of Frank
comes to fester.

366
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:13,624
Hey, you lost, pal? This is
a private sweat gland. Now beat it!

367
00:28:13,832 --> 00:28:18,379
I'm looking for volunteers. Some
germs who want in on a big score.

368
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:24,718
Yo, Red, we run the rackets here.
Take your hustle someplace else.

369
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:27,012
This ain't about no hustle.

370
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:30,224
This is about the baddest illness
you've ever seen.

371
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:33,477
Look who thinks he's
the Ebola virus, huh?

372
00:28:35,854 --> 00:28:37,815
Ebola?

373
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,151
Let me tell you something
about Ebola, baby.

374
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:45,656
Ebola is a case of dandruff
compared to me!

375
00:28:45,864 --> 00:28:48,575
All right, pal. You're out of here.

376
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:52,788
Bruiser, take him to the face
and bury him in a blackhead.

377
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:57,459
It'll take a Swedish facialist
and six steaming washcloths...

378
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,086
...to get you out!

379
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:02,298
Sounds like a gas, baby. Bring it on.

380
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:11,515
Bruiser! What are you? A sissy Mary?

381
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,058
What are you doing?

382
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:15,269
Che fa? What's he doing?

383
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:28,824
You ain't so tough, huh?
That was nothing.

384
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,744
So, uh...

385
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:34,830
...what kind of sickness
do you have in mind...

386
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,708
-...boss?
-Deadly.

387
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,631
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Uncle Bob.

388
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:45,883
Hello, beautiful.

389
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,802
I stopped by the camping store...

390
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:51,805
...and I got some stuff for the hike.

391
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:58,020
Right. On this hike, is that
teacher of yours going to be there?

392
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,815
Yeah, my whole class is.
Why?

393
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:05,486
I was thinking I might
take a rain check.

394
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:09,198
Mrs. Boyd isn't still mad at you.

395
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:13,285
I didn't think so.
We could do something better.

396
00:30:14,662 --> 00:30:18,999
Yesterday, without thinking,
I did all my hiking for the week.

397
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:22,920
I hiked to the liquor store,
the cigarette warehouse... .

398
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:26,465
-But, Dad, you said--
-I said I'd think about it.

399
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:30,386
It's a holiday weekend.
It's important to be together.

400
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:36,100
Yeah, I guess you're right.

401
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:40,813
Well, I have something special
up my sleeve.

402
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,569
Have you ever seen a rattlesnake
swallow a football?

403
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:49,363
I don't think she has.

404
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,031
It's fun. Come on.

405
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,536
-Come on. I'll show you.
-Thank you, Uncle Bob.

406
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:58,747
You're gonna love it!

407
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,337
Why are we wasting time here?

408
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:08,549
I am on a 12-hour
time release program.

409
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:12,344
-Throat, nose, then aches and pains.
-I got it.

410
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:15,389
Real important stuff.
Wait in the car.

411
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:18,017
I got police work to do.

412
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:21,520
One glazed and one
with a jelly-filled nucleus.

413
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,858
Brain memory library.

414
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:29,153
You got any information
on something called...

415
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:31,739
-... "EI Morry Roho"?
-Stand by.

416
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:36,160
I'll check, but we're really
all about sports statistics here.

417
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:40,623
-Sir?
-I'm here.

418
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,876
-What you got?
-" La Muerte Roja" is Spanish.

419
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:47,046
-It means "The Red Death. "
-The Red Death?

420
00:31:47,254 --> 00:31:50,758
-Is that some taco sauce?
- You have a nice day.

421
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,932
Yo, Drips!

422
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:03,103
You ever hear of The Red Death?

423
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:41,558
Look alive, boys.
Dust at nine o'clock.

424
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,898
Eat hot nose juice, dust.

425
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,291
-We're here. You happy?
-Hear that?

426
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:07,710
Quick! The dam is under attack!

427
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:09,712
Hey, chill, pill!

428
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,673
Snot guns are booger-coating
some dust.

429
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:31,442
Now, get to work!

430
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:35,613
This is your big plan?
A sore throat? A stuffy nose?

431
00:33:35,821 --> 00:33:38,991
-People will think you're--
-A common cold.

432
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:43,412
Until I make my move,
that's precisely what I want.

433
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:45,331
Yo, we got cops here!

434
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:53,422
Be careful! That's a pollen pod.
Frank is allergic to this stuff.

435
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,925
-I didn't know he had allergies.
-Of course not.

436
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:01,847
Pills know nothing
about what goes on in here.

437
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:07,978
In the words of the immortal
James Brown, get down!

438
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:09,229
James who?

439
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,497
-Hey, Frank.
-Danny.

440
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,461
You could've damaged the dam!

441
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,924
Relax, this baby was built to last.
Solid cartilage.

442
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:41,261
You're an engineer now.
I need to test the mucous viscosity.

443
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:46,475
Frank! Why are you leaving so early?

444
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:51,730
It's all shoveled. Hippo's asleep.
I'm taking Shane to Docky's.

445
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:55,442
-Did you think of something?
-Yeah, I did great.

446
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:01,156
I guarantee you there ain't
nothing wrong with this dam.

447
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,952
So you want me to take care of them?

448
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,790
No. Hit all the pressure valves.
They're about to blow the scene.

449
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,801
What in the name of sweet
bleeding Frank?!

450
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,054
The membrane is cracking, you--

451
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,959
-You missed a spot!
-Come on, fellas. Go!

452
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:56,462
-Let's get out of here!
-Stop!

453
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,796
Immunity!

454
00:35:58,005 --> 00:35:59,381
What the Frank?

455
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:04,803
Wait!

456
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:30,746
Nose hairs!

457
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:36,710
Watch out!

458
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:41,465
Look out!

459
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,722
We're going to die!

460
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:54,937
I'm standing here.
Can you use a tissue?

461
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:58,190
-I don't have one.
-Use your imagination.

462
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,942
What's that there?

463
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:11,578
I gotta go get her.
She'll be ex cited and call you.

464
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:17,418
If not for you, none of this
would have ever happened.

465
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,378
If you'll ex cuse me, l...

466
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,797
...have a nose to dry.

467
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:28,762
This is Nerve Network News. NNN.

468
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:37,021
In an act of selfless bravery,
a cold tablet stopped a runny nose.

469
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:41,108
The heroic tablet will be
honored this afternoon.

470
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:42,610
Trudy?

471
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:47,072
In lighter news, there was pandemonium
in the stomach today...

472
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,074
...as animal crackers arrived.

473
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:51,619
They are adorable, aren't they?

474
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:56,874
Now, we go live to Cerebellum Hall for
an address from Mayor Phlegmming.

475
00:37:57,124 --> 00:37:58,542
Okay, Mayor.

476
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:01,879
In five, four, three... .

477
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,675
Good evening, citizens of Frank.
In the past few weeks...

478
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:11,472
...my opponent has used fancy words
to try to confuse the issues.

479
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,268
Words like "ex ercise, "
"Iow-fat, " and "diet. "

480
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:21,815
Words designed to scare us into
changing what has worked for years.

481
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:26,153
Well, I say let's stay the course.

482
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:29,740
Remember, a fat Frank
is a happy Frank.

483
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:31,784
That's not what I wrote.

484
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:36,288
I propose something that every
organism in this city will enjoy.

485
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,040
I give you...

486
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:42,670
...a dream vacation to
the annual chicken wing festival...

487
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:44,713
...in Buffalo, New York.

488
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:53,597
Final plans have been made and nothing
is going to stand in our way.

489
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:55,975
And we're out.

490
00:38:57,393 --> 00:39:02,314
-That wasn't the speech we agreed on.
-Where's the twerp in the wheelchair?

491
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,483
Hello, Johnny. How you doing?

492
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:09,488
Congratulations. Ex cellent work
in the nose. Let's get some pictures.

493
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,076
The caption should read,
" Mayor and Pill Stop Cold...Cold. "

494
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:19,081
Mr. Mayor? Ex cuse me, sir,
but we have a problem.

495
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:20,708
Now what, Jones?

496
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:24,586
Whatever was in the sinuses
is a lot more than a cold.

497
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:29,049
Don't listen to Jones. His diagnostic
skills are remedial at best!

498
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:32,177
You iced a key witness
to a viral attack!

499
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,637
It was an accident!

500
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:36,765
The kind a time-release dipstick
would have.

501
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,686
I am sick of you!
That's it, I can't work with him!

502
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:42,896
I can't work with you!

503
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:44,565
Officers, please.

504
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:49,653
-Jones, what's this virus?
-The virus that torched the throat.

505
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:52,740
It caused those snot crests
I was surfing!

506
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:56,577
They were caused by the sneeze,
which you caused.

507
00:39:56,785 --> 00:40:00,331
Then why was that
viral-looking mother fleeing?

508
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:03,584
We should put the city on full alert.

509
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:07,838
-Liquids, bed rest. Just to be safe.
-We'll do no such thing.

510
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:13,469
I won't listen to the white blood cell
with the worst record in Frank.

511
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,847
Keep those opinions
in that mushy head...

512
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:21,352
...or you'll find yourself
in our next nosebleed. Understood?

513
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:24,897
Son, I apologize for all this.

514
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:28,359
Now, why don't we find you
a more capable officer...

515
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:29,526
...to work with.

516
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,324
Sir, if it's all the same to you...

517
00:40:35,574 --> 00:40:37,826
...I think I'll stay with Jones.

518
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,541
Suit yourself.

519
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:52,383
You didn't have to do that.
I don't need your sympathy.

520
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:54,093
It's not sympathy.

521
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:58,263
I'm here to make Frank feel better.
If this alleged virus...

522
00:40:58,514 --> 00:41:00,975
...impedes my mission,
I must pursue it.

523
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:03,435
Yeah, whatever.

524
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,190
What did the mayor mean by " record" ?

525
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:12,152
You did something terrible,
didn't you?

526
00:41:12,945 --> 00:41:16,198
Sometimes being too careful
is all it takes.

527
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,408
How so?

528
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:22,162
I was cruising the digestive tract,
just minding my own business.

529
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:27,584
Outside was Shane's science fair.
Everyone was ex cited.

530
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:31,797
The winner would get their picture
in the local paper.

531
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:37,303
-Think they'll like my volcano?
-All the parents are going home sad.

532
00:41:38,137 --> 00:41:42,391
Their kids'projects are cardboard
and glitter paint and science.

533
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,560
Shane, yours is art.

534
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:48,480
-Wow, what a great tepee.
-Tepee?

535
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,108
Mrs. Delirious, come on.

536
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:56,780
I'll check the competition. Try and
learn them something about volcanos.

537
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,704
Partner, what you got there?

538
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:08,208
These are polluted oysters.
Well, they were polluted.

539
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:13,005
I replanted them six months ago.
That's how long the state says.

540
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:16,050
Every time the tide came in,
they'd flush...

541
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:18,052
...all the bad stuff out.

542
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,846
Can you eat them?

543
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:25,100
Well, if my hypotenuse is correct,
sure:

544
00:42:26,852 --> 00:42:28,354
Yeah, definitely.

545
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:30,773
You got yourself a sale.

546
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,288
You should check your math
on that one.

547
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:52,086
I was in the kidneys
while a 6-31 was in progress.

548
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:56,382
That's incoming shellfish.
I went to the stomach, to be safe.

549
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,969
Unscheduled shellfish
now arriving at gate six.

550
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,138
And you must be Shane's dad.

551
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,891
Guilty as charged. Frank Detorre.

552
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,727
Pleasure to meet you.
I am Mrs. Boyd.

553
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:11,563
I am Shane's science and PE teacher.

554
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:15,442
I am just absolutely crazy
about your daughter.

555
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:16,735
She is a doll.

556
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:19,738
If you mean that, I'll keep her.

557
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:29,039
Oh, my God.

558
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:33,335
That is so funny!

559
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:36,964
Oh, my God, I got the giggles.

560
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,301
She's a sweetie-pie.

561
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,139
She wants to go to the city
and help people someday.

562
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,934
No kidding.
You mean like a concierge?

563
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:51,812
No, like, poor people.

564
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:54,356
Yeah, she told me that.

565
00:43:55,149 --> 00:43:58,944
Frank, it's so wonderful to see...

566
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:02,156
...Shane participating
in the science fair.

567
00:44:02,448 --> 00:44:06,910
Since her mother passed away,
she's had a really hard time...

568
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:09,747
...being part of the group activities.

569
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,249
She's going to be okay.

570
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,797
And then I saw him.

571
00:44:19,882 --> 00:44:22,426
He was on the clammiest oyster
I'd seen.

572
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,556
Mr. Detorre?

573
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:32,728
Are you okay?

574
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,149
Those oysters.

575
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:41,904
The oysters?
Oh, yeah, that's Zach's project.

576
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:44,406
He's a little slow.

577
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:48,661
The doctor says he has a brain
the size of a tangerine.

578
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:54,249
We gave him this project
to push him along.

579
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:59,213
He just started it this morning.
We'll give him an 'A'anyway.

580
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,591
Mr. Detorre?

581
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:14,228
There was no time for questions.
I did what I had to do.

582
00:45:14,895 --> 00:45:17,064
Look at that guy!

583
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:31,370
You can guess which photo
made it to the paper the next day.

584
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:34,707
Overnight, Frank became
the town laughingstock.

585
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:39,044
The photo ran in every daily
across the country.

586
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:42,548
He got fired from his job
at the pea soup factory.

587
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:46,677
Lucky for us, Bob hooked up
Frank with a job at the zoo.

588
00:45:46,885 --> 00:45:51,515
It was a 90%%% cut in pay,
but it was the best we could do.

589
00:45:51,724 --> 00:45:55,227
Needless to say,
none of this helped Shane.

590
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:59,356
And as for me, I got suspended
for unnecessary force.

591
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:02,443
Since then, every day I wonder:

592
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:04,737
" Did I do the right thing?"

593
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:08,741
From the description,
it sounds like you were justified.

594
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:10,159
Ex cuse me?

595
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,454
Oysters are filled
with dangerous bacteria.

596
00:46:13,662 --> 00:46:16,457
I've been trying to tell everybody!

597
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:20,711
-I never thought you'd be on my side.
-I never thought you'd be right.

598
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:28,636
Sir, we have a strict
no-shoes-no-service policy.

599
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:30,262
You have to leave.

600
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:33,641
Is that how you treat
the handicapped?

601
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:36,268
Handicap?

602
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:40,105
I have a chronic
ingrown-toe condition.

603
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:43,943
Doctors say that soon
I won't be able to wear...

604
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:48,113
-...even the roomiest of footwear.
-I'll bring your menus.

605
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:52,993
Bring some clam strips and some
steamers when you come, please?

606
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:56,747
What's the big surprise?

607
00:46:56,956 --> 00:47:01,710
I know you wanted to go
on a trip this weekend, so... .

608
00:47:06,215 --> 00:47:07,216
Buffalo?

609
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,969
Buffalo, New York.

610
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:13,138
The buffalo wing festival
this weekend.

611
00:47:15,057 --> 00:47:17,559
Great. So, what's the big surprise?

612
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:21,063
We got tickets!
I called a scalper!

613
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:22,439
Look.

614
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:25,276
Ninety-nine kinds of wings.

615
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:29,655
One hundred and twenty-eight
different dipping sauces.

616
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:32,700
You love math.
Crunch the numbers on that.

617
00:47:32,908 --> 00:47:35,494
The possibilities are infinite.

618
00:47:35,744 --> 00:47:37,997
Look! Here you are.

619
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:40,374
Ms. Chicken Wing Festival.

620
00:47:43,252 --> 00:47:44,545
See this?

621
00:47:45,504 --> 00:47:48,799
He's the champion.
But he won't be for long.

622
00:47:49,008 --> 00:47:53,762
Because I'm coming.
I'm coming to get you, baby. Fun?

623
00:47:55,097 --> 00:47:58,017
Yeah, that's really cool, Dad.

624
00:47:58,225 --> 00:48:00,686
See, I told you she'd be ex cited.

625
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:02,563
Now, tidy up, will you?

626
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:15,909
Okay, Frank. This is your conscience
speaking. Now listen carefully.

627
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:20,039
This hiking trip means
a lot to her. Make it work.

628
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:22,791
Use that charm.

629
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,545
What's wrong now?

630
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,883
Oh, jeez.
Oh, it's this damn toe.

631
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:32,718
Do me a favor, huh?

632
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:35,679
Don't you get old.

633
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:38,891
Listen to the toe.
Don't you get old.

634
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:51,070
Boss, your plan worked.

635
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,199
That's right. I got this city
exactly where I want it.

636
00:48:56,825 --> 00:49:01,497
-What about the cop and the pill?
-If they give us a problem:

637
00:49:01,747 --> 00:49:03,749
Fire!

638
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:17,554
Get it down! Money on the wood
make the game go good.

639
00:49:17,763 --> 00:49:20,432
Five bucks says size don't matter.

640
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,687
Let's do this thing now.

641
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:29,400
-Chicken-pock fights.
-Get back!

642
00:49:29,858 --> 00:49:31,443
Yeah, get him!

643
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:34,321
That's my baby! Try the headlock!

644
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:37,992
-See that dude?
-A virus! We should arrest him!

645
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,578
No, that used to be a virus,
now he's on our side.

646
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:45,374
-That's Chill. He's a flu shot.
-He doesn't look fluish.

647
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:49,378
Just stay here and watch
the maestro work.

648
00:49:50,212 --> 00:49:51,630
Yo, Chill! Chill!

649
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,508
Pock fights are against the law.

650
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:57,136
Where you all going?

651
00:49:57,344 --> 00:50:00,931
Thanks a lot, junior.
You just cost me twenty.

652
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,561
Money won't be your problem if
you don't tell me about the sinuses.

653
00:50:05,811 --> 00:50:09,607
I was injected into this body
to rat on influenza only.

654
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:13,944
And this don't sound
like influenza to me. Now beat it.

655
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:18,324
I bet Johnny Streptococcus and the
Melanoma family will be interested...

656
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:20,618
...to hear about your work.

657
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:25,873
You can't jack me on that, brother!
I'm in the virus protection program.

658
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:30,377
You, virus. Children's strength
ought to take care of you.

659
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:34,298
You done done it now, Chill.
He's a psycho cop.

660
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:36,634
It's too late to spill it.

661
00:50:36,842 --> 00:50:40,512
Just off the Thorazine.
He's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

662
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:44,516
He's going EI Pollo Loco
on your crazy behind.

663
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:47,269
I just can't look.

664
00:50:47,603 --> 00:50:48,646
All right!

665
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:55,694
The guy's big time.
He goes by the name of Thrax.

666
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:58,864
Go to that new place.
The Zit, on the head.

667
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:02,701
You can't miss it. It's huge.
They're meeting tonight.

668
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,911
I'm out.

669
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:09,625
But you didn't hear that from me.
You didn't hear that from me.

670
00:51:10,918 --> 00:51:13,295
Next time, I'll be the bad cop.

671
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,172
You are a bad cop.

672
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,092
Who you calling a bad cop?

673
00:51:33,148 --> 00:51:36,735
My, what big zits he has.
How does this happen?

674
00:51:36,944 --> 00:51:39,446
You wash your face
with fried chicken.

675
00:51:44,243 --> 00:51:47,246
Wait. Where do you think you're going?

676
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:49,707
-To get our cootie.
-Like that?

677
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:53,460
-They'll tear you up. Get spiffy.
-Spiffy?

678
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:08,350
Peep this. Check it out.

679
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,063
Pliable cellular dynamics.
What an ingenious defense mechanism.

680
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:15,232
Ooh, let me try.

681
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:20,779
What do you think?

682
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,282
You should guard the car.

683
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,494
This is my mission too.
I am going in with you.

684
00:52:27,703 --> 00:52:31,248
All right. But we gotta
get you something to wear.

685
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:39,298
You sure this is working?

686
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:43,344
-Trust me, it's perfect.
-Perfect.

687
00:52:59,068 --> 00:53:00,819
We got company. Be cool.

688
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:07,284
Now, try to relax. Fit in.
Shake a tail cell or something.

689
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:10,704
I don't dance.
I have no left feet.

690
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,289
You don't dance?

691
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:16,126
Don't tell me you ain't
never gotten jiggy with it.

692
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:18,379
I don't believe I have.

693
00:53:18,587 --> 00:53:21,674
Come on, baby, give me
a little bit of this.

694
00:53:22,257 --> 00:53:23,217
Oh, all right.

695
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,178
-Here you go.
-That's it, baby.

696
00:53:26,387 --> 00:53:29,515
-Get down.
-Don't let it settle at the bottom.

697
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:32,601
Oh, mama. Yo!

698
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:41,193
You stay and practice.
Boy, you need it.

699
00:53:41,443 --> 00:53:44,863
If I'm not back in five,
you come looking, okay?

700
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,237
Barkeep, what you got?

701
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:37,833
-You got a problem with that?
-No. It's just the way I like it:

702
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:40,753
Extra disgusting.

703
00:55:04,693 --> 00:55:08,280
Three teams will move through
the cranial artery...

704
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:11,116
...and one through
the nasal passages.

705
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:15,788
We are going to the brain, baby.
And we are stealing one of these.

706
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:20,167
This sucker comes from a place
called the hypothalamus gland.

707
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:25,255
Hypothalamus. Hypothalamus.

708
00:55:25,464 --> 00:55:28,133
Controls the temperature for the body.

709
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:31,929
We are going to march in
and take the prize.

710
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:35,975
Frank's gonna heat up
like a sidewalk on a summer day.

711
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,526
Go away.

712
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,282
I need to talk to you.

713
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:58,956
What a zit!

714
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,500
What is it? What do you want?

715
00:56:02,418 --> 00:56:04,586
I want you to help me.

716
00:56:05,004 --> 00:56:06,880
Should I call the cops?

717
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:11,844
Or maybe Shane should know
about the 200-yard restraining order.

718
00:56:12,052 --> 00:56:15,848
Please. She's been
humiliated enough already.

719
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:18,225
Humiliated.

720
00:56:18,434 --> 00:56:22,021
You turned me into
a walking air-sickness bag.

721
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:25,190
My family was humiliated.
You understand?

722
00:56:25,399 --> 00:56:27,860
Do you have any idea
of the teasing...

723
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:31,322
...that my sons, Ralph and Chuck,
had to endure?

724
00:56:32,114 --> 00:56:35,618
I know your daughter Hurly
had to transfer.

725
00:56:35,868 --> 00:56:37,369
Her name is Shirley.

726
00:56:38,078 --> 00:56:40,122
That is much prettier.

727
00:56:40,873 --> 00:56:44,126
-Tom Brokaw called her Hurly.
-What?

728
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:46,378
But it was a cute picture.

729
00:56:47,546 --> 00:56:51,800
We gotta get this water underneath
our bridge, for Shane's sake.

730
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:56,055
I would never hold anything
against one of my students.

731
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,390
Get back to work!

732
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:04,063
-Be prepared. It's going down tonight.
-Tonight?

733
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:07,566
Me and Madcow
are going to Wrestlemania.

734
00:57:08,317 --> 00:57:09,318
See this?

735
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:13,822
This DNA bead comes from a girl
in Riverside, California.

736
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:18,285
Didn't like to wash her hands.
Took me three whole weeks.

737
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:22,081
And this one.
Nice lady in Detroit, Motown.

738
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:23,832
Six days flat.

739
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:26,585
Then there's this old guy in Philly.

740
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:30,089
I killed him in seventy-two hours.

741
00:57:30,297 --> 00:57:35,094
I'm getting better as I go, but
the problem is I never set a record.

742
00:57:35,344 --> 00:57:37,471
Until my man Frank, that is.

743
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:42,434
I'll take him down in 48 hours.
Get my chapter in the medical books.

744
00:57:45,104 --> 00:57:48,774
Ex cuse me. Ex cuse me.
I got one more question here.

745
00:57:48,983 --> 00:57:53,904
Could a white blood cell
do anything to stop this evil plan?

746
00:57:54,113 --> 00:57:57,449
You know, hypothetically speaking,
that is.

747
00:57:57,992 --> 00:58:02,246
-And, who are you?
-Who am l? Who am l?

748
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,876
A bad, booty-shaking pickinosis.
Yeah. That's who I am.

749
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,796
-Never heard of you.
-You just got here.

750
00:58:11,005 --> 00:58:14,425
But ask any of them,
when it comes to illing...

751
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:18,387
...bad, booty-shaking pickinosis
stands above the rest.

752
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,723
Oh, that hurts.

753
00:58:21,974 --> 00:58:23,267
That ain't no germ.

754
00:58:23,475 --> 00:58:25,185
That's a cop.

755
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:31,650
Well, what do we have here?
An officer of Frank's finest.

756
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:35,779
Somebody lay down a towel.
This is going to be messy.

757
00:58:37,656 --> 00:58:40,659
Attention, germs. You are surrounded.

758
00:58:42,661 --> 00:58:43,662
Surrounded.

759
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:46,457
Yo, Hammer. You can stop dancing.

760
00:58:52,755 --> 00:58:53,756
What kept you?

761
00:58:55,883 --> 00:58:58,844
Es el Muerte Rojo! No me mates!
Get out of here!

762
00:59:01,013 --> 00:59:05,309
Lift the restraining order
so I can do this father-daughter trip.

763
00:59:05,517 --> 00:59:07,519
The answer is no.

764
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:09,647
Please.

765
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,692
Think about it overnight.

766
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:20,366
It would make a little girl
very happy.

767
00:59:23,494 --> 00:59:27,164
Only for use against
the most stubborn cold symptoms.

768
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,877
-Childproof caps.
-Get him!

769
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:41,929
Why you hit so hard?

770
00:59:47,434 --> 00:59:50,437
Drix, I could use a little help here.

771
00:59:50,646 --> 00:59:51,647
Give me that.

772
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:01,865
Oh, no. Not again.

773
01:00:10,249 --> 01:00:13,585
You have something white on your lips.

774
01:00:15,087 --> 01:00:16,755
Other side.

775
01:00:22,803 --> 01:00:24,013
Get out!

776
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:25,472
Out!

777
01:00:25,681 --> 01:00:30,019
The answer is no! Absolutely not!

778
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,446
Thanks. You saved my cytoplasm
in there.

779
01:00:44,325 --> 01:00:46,744
Mr. Thrax has left the building.

780
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:56,128
Let's call for a scab
and get to the precinct.

781
01:01:00,341 --> 01:01:02,843
Jones! ln my office.

782
01:01:03,385 --> 01:01:07,431
Hey, hey, who died?
Other than Thrax, that is. Brandy!

783
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,477
-I mean, Leah. Why are you here?
-You really did it now.

784
01:01:11,685 --> 01:01:16,482
-I didn't see you back there.
-Disregarding orders, destruction...

785
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:20,945
...popping a pimple without a permit!
What were you doing there?

786
01:01:21,153 --> 01:01:24,865
-Promoting good health, sir.
-Is that what you call it?

787
01:01:25,074 --> 01:01:27,868
He was lethal.
If we hadn't stopped him--

788
01:01:28,077 --> 01:01:32,539
-We'd be frying eggs off of Frank!
-Watch it, you'll cause a panic.

789
01:01:32,748 --> 01:01:36,502
People would think
about what's going on in this body...

790
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,128
...not the stupid trip!

791
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:42,716
Okay, you want us to start thinking?
Well, here's a thought:

792
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:44,343
You're fired.

793
01:01:44,927 --> 01:01:47,054
-Mr. Mayor--
-Your badge, mister.

794
01:01:47,596 --> 01:01:52,059
Figures. I finally do something right
for Frank, and I get fired.

795
01:01:56,105 --> 01:01:59,525
Without him, Frank could've been
in mortal danger.

796
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:04,321
Mortal danger? You'd love to prove
that, wouldn't you, Mr. Drix enol?

797
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:07,866
Get your name in the
New England Journal of Medicine.

798
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:11,370
Son, read what it says on your arm.

799
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:14,290
" For the temporary relief
of symptoms--"

800
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:17,710
Exactly. Temporary.

801
01:02:17,918 --> 01:02:19,920
You're a wannabe. A placebo.

802
01:02:20,129 --> 01:02:24,133
A generic brand.
An over-the-counter Tic-Tac.

803
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:27,594
Now, get out of my body!

804
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:34,476
Continuing symptoms,
while annoying...

805
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:38,439
... will not derail plans
for the trip to the annual...

806
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,816
...chicken wing festival.

807
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:45,654
-What's so funny?
-I don't know.

808
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:50,034
They're making this too easy.

809
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,414
You know, no one has ever
gotten wise to me...

810
01:02:55,623 --> 01:02:57,541
...and now for the first time...

811
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,086
...an immunity cell
has figured out everything...

812
01:03:01,295 --> 01:03:03,297
...and they don't believe him.

813
01:03:06,008 --> 01:03:08,927
Can you taste the irony in that?

814
01:03:10,596 --> 01:03:13,307
Shut up! What are you two laughing at?

815
01:03:15,267 --> 01:03:16,852
We're back on schedule.

816
01:03:17,353 --> 01:03:20,105
But boss, we're the only ones left.

817
01:03:20,356 --> 01:03:23,525
Maybe we should incubate for a while?

818
01:03:24,818 --> 01:03:26,320
You incubate.

819
01:03:26,528 --> 01:03:29,281
I'm going to make my deadline.

820
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:34,495
Medical books aren't written
about losers.

821
01:03:40,334 --> 01:03:41,710
I'm not going.

822
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,675
-You're not going where, hon?
-To Buffalo. I'm not going.

823
01:03:49,802 --> 01:03:53,973
Honey, we're all packed.
Buffalo's going to be a blast.

824
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:57,935
I'm going camping with my friends.

825
01:03:58,143 --> 01:03:59,979
You're welcome to join us.

826
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:02,731
Well, I don't think... .

827
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,984
I'd really like you to come.

828
01:04:06,735 --> 01:04:10,114
You don't want me
huffing and puffing after you.

829
01:04:10,322 --> 01:04:11,949
You want to go, okay.

830
01:04:12,157 --> 01:04:14,743
Uncle Bob will go with me to Buffalo.

831
01:04:17,204 --> 01:04:19,915
I'm tired of this. It's not fair.

832
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:22,835
I go where you want.
I eat what you want.

833
01:04:23,043 --> 01:04:25,838
Don't you ever think
about anyone else?

834
01:04:26,672 --> 01:04:28,465
I think about you.

835
01:04:28,841 --> 01:04:32,803
Like when you packed me
a fried Slim Jim sandwich?

836
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:36,682
Yeah. It was a turkey Slim Jim.

837
01:04:36,932 --> 01:04:38,309
You know, Dad... .

838
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:43,814
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...

839
01:04:44,023 --> 01:04:46,233
...and took care of yourselves...

840
01:04:46,442 --> 01:04:48,444
...maybe she'd still be here.

841
01:04:50,154 --> 01:04:54,533
Knock off that hamburger talk.
Come here, honey.

842
01:04:57,828 --> 01:04:59,705
Your mom died...

843
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:02,416
...because she got sick.

844
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:06,128
And how do you think you get sick?

845
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:07,880
Germs.

846
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:10,215
It's the way you eat.

847
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,380
Who's that?

848
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:53,425
You know my great-great-grandpappy
fought the measles?

849
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:58,847
There's been a Jones on the force
since we came on the umbilical cord.

850
01:05:59,098 --> 01:06:01,183
Until now, that is.

851
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:04,436
All right, ladies.
Wrap it up now.

852
01:06:07,773 --> 01:06:11,277
Well, l... .
I guess I should get going.

853
01:06:11,527 --> 01:06:14,530
Wouldn't want Frank
to build immunity to me.

854
01:06:14,738 --> 01:06:18,367
Maybe next time he takes Drix enol
it'll do him some good.

855
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:22,997
-Goodbye, Drips.
-That's Drix.

856
01:06:23,622 --> 01:06:24,748
Whatever.

857
01:07:21,013 --> 01:07:22,890
People, let's get started.

858
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:27,978
I don't need to remind anyone
that today's our trip to Buffalo.

859
01:07:28,187 --> 01:07:33,525
Frank will be up in 20 minutes.
I don't want him losing an eyelash...

860
01:07:33,734 --> 01:07:35,319
...or stubbing his toe.

861
01:07:40,532 --> 01:07:41,575
Free screening?

862
01:07:41,784 --> 01:07:46,246
We're broadcasting live dreams
from the brain's subconscious.

863
01:07:56,465 --> 01:07:58,926
You get back to work right now.

864
01:08:10,104 --> 01:08:13,816
That's right, big boy.
You keep on dreaming.

865
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:16,568
At least you got your health.

866
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:20,322
Ninety-eight point six.

867
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:23,575
Ninety-eight point six.

868
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:27,830
-Ninety-eight point six.
-Perfect.

869
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:33,585
You can't come in here!

870
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,720
Baby...

871
01:08:42,928 --> 01:08:46,432
...you are looking fine today.

872
01:09:09,288 --> 01:09:12,833
Don't forget the cushion
we take to football games.

873
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:16,629
Don't want the voters
in the hemorrhoids complaining.

874
01:09:16,879 --> 01:09:19,381
Something's wrong with the weather.

875
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,926
-We're probably drinking coffee.
-Look at the map.

876
01:09:23,135 --> 01:09:25,679
-What if Jones is right?
-Jones?

877
01:09:26,972 --> 01:09:28,474
Funny. Funny.

878
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:31,602
You care more about your reelection...

879
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,771
...than our lives.

880
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:37,149
I'm going to the hypothalamus
to check it out.

881
01:09:37,358 --> 01:09:38,859
Hypo-who-what is this?

882
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:41,779
Leah, wait!
Who will answer the phones?

883
01:09:53,207 --> 01:09:55,542
Be advised. We have a break-in.

884
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:03,050
Sarge?

885
01:10:04,343 --> 01:10:06,762
Nothing down there but bad dreams.

886
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,848
Frankie.

887
01:10:13,936 --> 01:10:14,937
Wait.

888
01:10:16,188 --> 01:10:21,318
Maybe Shane would like to know
about the 200-yard restraining order.

889
01:10:22,653 --> 01:10:26,282
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...

890
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,993
...and took care of yourselves...

891
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:33,414
-...maybe she'd still be here.
- You're fired. Get out of here!

892
01:10:33,998 --> 01:10:37,084
-Get out!
-No, I can't.

893
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:41,005
-Get back to work.
-What the-- Huh?

894
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,467
What the heck was that?

895
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,139
Francis Detorre,
you stand up right now!

896
01:10:52,766 --> 01:10:55,894
Thrax is alive and he's in the brain!

897
01:10:56,103 --> 01:10:58,731
Oh, great, pal. Spoil the ending.

898
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:01,525
-What's your temperature?
-98.6.

899
01:11:01,734 --> 01:11:04,111
-Is this broken again?
-Drix!

900
01:11:05,154 --> 01:11:10,159
You get those skid marks
out of my class! Out the door !

901
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:37,811
This cat was sick before I
even got here.

902
01:11:39,605 --> 01:11:43,567
Now boarding: the 9: 37,
with nonstop service...

903
01:11:43,776 --> 01:11:46,612
-... to the toilet bowl.
-Tickets, please.

904
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:53,035
Keep it moving.

905
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:54,703
-Thank you.
-Drix!

906
01:11:54,912 --> 01:11:56,497
-Yo, Drix!
-Jones?

907
01:11:56,705 --> 01:11:58,666
Get your butt off this boat!

908
01:11:58,874 --> 01:12:03,504
-Thrax is alive. Let's go.
-I'm sorry, Osmosis. I can't help you.

909
01:12:03,712 --> 01:12:04,797
Ex cuse me?

910
01:12:05,005 --> 01:12:07,841
I can't combat a virus.
Read my label.

911
01:12:08,092 --> 01:12:10,511
Learn to think outside the pillbox.

912
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:11,887
Keep it moving.

913
01:12:12,304 --> 01:12:16,475
I know sugar pills who cured cancer,
because they believed.

914
01:12:16,892 --> 01:12:19,979
Oh, I don't know, Ozzy. Look at me.

915
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:22,481
I'm cherry-flavored.

916
01:12:24,692 --> 01:12:27,361
Hey, pal, are you on or off?

917
01:12:27,861 --> 01:12:30,531
Fine. Flush your life
down the toilet.

918
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:35,369
The zipper's down.
All ashore that's going ashore.

919
01:12:46,422 --> 01:12:50,301
-You know a pill who cured cancer?
-No.

920
01:12:50,509 --> 01:12:52,469
It makes for a good pep talk.

921
01:12:53,929 --> 01:12:56,015
Let's go catch a cold.

922
01:12:59,602 --> 01:13:02,980
How about a hug for your Uncle Bob?

923
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:06,567
Okay. Nice talking to you too.

924
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:09,528
Hey, muscles.

925
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:13,324
-You don't look so good.
-I feel a little fluey.

926
01:13:13,532 --> 01:13:17,661
You know what they say,
"Starve a cold, drown the flu. "

927
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:21,165
Your body needs fluids.
And lots of them.

928
01:13:21,624 --> 01:13:22,958
Is beer fluid?

929
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:24,335
Of course.

930
01:13:24,543 --> 01:13:29,048
-What about all that wet stuff in it?
-I thought that was the beer.

931
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:33,427
No, finish that up.
Come on, we want to get better.

932
01:13:33,636 --> 01:13:38,557
There we go. That's it.
That's my good washboard-tummy guy.

933
01:13:40,392 --> 01:13:43,187
This is it. Men, go, go, go.

934
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:46,315
Hi, baby.

935
01:13:47,441 --> 01:13:49,443
Why are you waiting?
Shoot him!

936
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:51,904
If you follow me, she dies.

937
01:13:52,112 --> 01:13:53,113
Don't shoot.

938
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:04,792
-This ain't time to get carsick.
-I'm okay, I'm 1/8 Dramamine!

939
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,336
It's just this darn heat!

940
01:14:08,253 --> 01:14:12,132
As long as it don't hit 108 degrees,
or Shane's an orphan.

941
01:14:17,054 --> 01:14:21,517
Shane, look what I bought for you.
They're false eyelashes.

942
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,102
Whatever.

943
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:29,608
Just close your eye.

944
01:14:31,443 --> 01:14:34,029
You look good with falsies.

945
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:41,704
-What the--?
-Let me go!

946
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,633
Oh, Don't worry.
Shane will be fine.

947
01:14:55,175 --> 01:14:59,013
I want to her to be at ease
and not worry.

948
01:14:59,221 --> 01:15:00,347
Listen...

949
01:15:00,764 --> 01:15:03,934
...why don't you sit her down
and tell her...

950
01:15:04,184 --> 01:15:08,480
...that if anything happens to you,
I will take care of her. Okay?

951
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:11,984
I will nurture her,
I will love her...

952
01:15:12,192 --> 01:15:15,154
...and when she's 16,
I'll boot her out.

953
01:15:15,654 --> 01:15:16,822
Sixteen?

954
01:15:17,031 --> 01:15:21,702
I'm not gonna mommy her forever, okay?
I mean, sixteen, sure.

955
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,164
Frank? Are you all right?

956
01:15:29,043 --> 01:15:32,463
We've a hostage situation
involving the mayor's aide.

957
01:15:32,671 --> 01:15:35,215
Leah, girl, what were you thinking?

958
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:36,675
Now, we go live...

959
01:15:36,884 --> 01:15:40,387
... to a chase in the superior
vena cava expressway.

960
01:15:40,596 --> 01:15:43,307
Reports of a hostage are confirmed.

961
01:15:50,397 --> 01:15:51,482
Look out!

962
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:59,239
Suspect is headed towards the uvula.

963
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:01,241
What the heck is a " uvala" ?

964
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:05,621
-It's that dangly thing in Frank's--
-Box er shorts! Okay!

965
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:07,122
Not that thing!

966
01:16:07,331 --> 01:16:08,916
The one in his throat!

967
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,169
I knew that. I knew that.

968
01:16:16,382 --> 01:16:17,883
Are you with me?

969
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:21,345
Frank, are you with me?
Are you okay?

970
01:16:21,595 --> 01:16:23,973
I feel fine. Say it!

971
01:16:25,808 --> 01:16:27,643
Frank. Hold on, here.

972
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:31,689
You're going to the hospital.
The trip is off.

973
01:16:31,897 --> 01:16:35,484
-Pull it over, big guy.
-The trip is off? No!

974
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:41,573
Shane, isn't that your dad?

975
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,495
Oh, my God.

976
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:48,956
Stop the bus!

977
01:16:49,581 --> 01:16:51,792
Dad! Uncle Bob!

978
01:16:55,129 --> 01:16:56,547
Shane, you're here?

979
01:16:56,797 --> 01:16:58,716
-I'm her niece!
-What happened?

980
01:16:58,966 --> 01:17:01,135
Your daddy's had an accident.

981
01:17:01,343 --> 01:17:03,846
-Is he okay?
-He's going to be fine.

982
01:17:04,096 --> 01:17:07,099
I hope he's going to be okay.
Come on.

983
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:20,779
Let me go! Watch the hands, buddy!

984
01:17:20,988 --> 01:17:22,740
-Hold up.
-Put me down!

985
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:25,826
-Critical one here!
-Coming through.

986
01:17:28,954 --> 01:17:33,876
-What's the story on this one?
-I don't know. He's burning up.

987
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:37,546
Let's move on my mark.
One, two, lift!

988
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:48,724
-What is that nasty smell?
-Cherry. Wild cherry.

989
01:17:48,974 --> 01:17:50,225
Now let her go.

990
01:17:51,602 --> 01:17:54,605
Why? So you can ice me again?

991
01:17:54,813 --> 01:17:56,357
No! So I can!

992
01:17:58,901 --> 01:18:00,819
virus con Dios.

993
01:18:12,164 --> 01:18:14,124
Jones! Ooh, thank Frank.

994
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:15,417
Temperature?

995
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:17,962
-It's at 106.2.
-Put him in ice!

996
01:18:18,212 --> 01:18:20,005
We gotta cool him down!

997
01:18:22,091 --> 01:18:25,469
-We need some ice in here!
-Right, I'll get it.

998
01:18:26,845 --> 01:18:27,888
Daddy?

999
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:29,306
Maggie.

1000
01:18:29,515 --> 01:18:31,850
No, Dad. It's me, Shane.

1001
01:18:32,601 --> 01:18:35,271
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1002
01:18:36,313 --> 01:18:38,607
I ain't got time for this.

1003
01:18:43,988 --> 01:18:47,366
This is Frank PD.
We have you surrounded.

1004
01:18:47,574 --> 01:18:48,617
Surrender.

1005
01:18:48,826 --> 01:18:52,371
-Give it up. You're busted.
-Hand over the bracelet.

1006
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:54,665
You're making this too easy.

1007
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,084
-Pollen?
-Check this out.

1008
01:18:57,293 --> 01:18:58,919
Oh, no!

1009
01:18:59,545 --> 01:19:00,796
Mother of Frank!

1010
01:19:04,675 --> 01:19:07,177
Enjoy the funeral, boys!

1011
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:15,728
-We're dead.
-How's your aim?

1012
01:19:15,936 --> 01:19:17,563
A lot better than yours!

1013
01:19:17,771 --> 01:19:19,565
What are you doing?

1014
01:19:21,025 --> 01:19:22,067
Saving Frank.

1015
01:19:22,443 --> 01:19:23,652
Let's do it.

1016
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,530
You want Osmosis?

1017
01:19:26,739 --> 01:19:28,407
You've got Osmosis.

1018
01:19:56,268 --> 01:20:00,397
You just don't know when to quit,
do you, Jones?

1019
01:20:17,623 --> 01:20:21,210
You know what, Jones?
You want this chain so bad...

1020
01:20:21,877 --> 01:20:25,881
...Big Daddy Thrax
is gonna let you have it.

1021
01:20:26,465 --> 01:20:28,300
Looks good on you, Jones.

1022
01:20:28,509 --> 01:20:30,010
You wear it well.

1023
01:20:30,427 --> 01:20:33,681
It's a shame you came
this far just to die.

1024
01:20:48,654 --> 01:20:50,864
Who's the Germinator now?

1025
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,875
It's a falsie.

1026
01:21:06,297 --> 01:21:09,675
Can you feel the heat, Jones?

1027
01:21:10,801 --> 01:21:14,513
Too bad you won't be here
to see me break my record...

1028
01:21:14,722 --> 01:21:17,850
...when I take down
Frank's pretty little girl.

1029
01:21:20,019 --> 01:21:21,895
She ain't going down.

1030
01:21:23,397 --> 01:21:26,066
-You are.
-What?

1031
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,245
No!

1032
01:22:13,113 --> 01:22:15,240
We're losing him. Breathe!

1033
01:22:16,408 --> 01:22:20,537
-Come on, man.
-Daddy! No! I don't want to lose you!

1034
01:22:21,121 --> 01:22:23,082
-Take her out.
-Come on, honey.

1035
01:22:23,457 --> 01:22:27,544
-No, that's my dad!
-The doctor's doing everything he can.

1036
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:28,796
Hey! Wait!

1037
01:22:29,672 --> 01:22:31,006
Frank!

1038
01:22:31,256 --> 01:22:32,549
Frank!

1039
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:42,810
Things are grim as temperatures
rise dangerously.

1040
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:45,896
We've lost contact
with the extremities.

1041
01:22:46,146 --> 01:22:49,566
NNN will stay on the air
as long as possible.

1042
01:22:49,775 --> 01:22:54,822
When we return, household appliances
that can improve your golf swing.

1043
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:59,410
You silly twit, Don't you get it?!
We are going to die!

1044
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:03,330
I knew it. At the first dark cloud,
you fall apart.

1045
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:04,581
-Moron!
-Phony !

1046
01:23:13,507 --> 01:23:18,762
Gentlemen, playing with you has been
the greatest pleasure of my life.

1047
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:42,911
He's not coming back.
He's not gonna make it.

1048
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,794
Come on, sweetheart.
He'll be... .

1049
01:23:57,509 --> 01:23:58,469
That's it.

1050
01:23:58,677 --> 01:24:00,179
-Wait, hey.
-Daddy!

1051
01:24:00,387 --> 01:24:03,015
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.

1052
01:24:03,474 --> 01:24:07,227
I don't blame you for Mom's death.
I didn't mean it.

1053
01:24:07,478 --> 01:24:09,980
You're the greatest dad in the world.

1054
01:24:41,011 --> 01:24:42,054
Look!

1055
01:24:57,486 --> 01:25:00,239
Get that thing
to the hypothalamus now!

1056
01:25:05,953 --> 01:25:07,746
Okay, I'm calling it.

1057
01:25:07,955 --> 01:25:11,750
I'm sorry. sweetie.
Come on. I know.

1058
01:25:17,298 --> 01:25:20,092
Wait a minute!
He's got a pulse!

1059
01:25:23,804 --> 01:25:25,681
He's coming back.

1060
01:25:25,973 --> 01:25:27,850
One-oh-seven-point-seven.

1061
01:25:28,058 --> 01:25:30,394
One-oh-seven-point-six.

1062
01:25:39,653 --> 01:25:41,697
Your mama says, " Hi. "

1063
01:25:58,047 --> 01:26:02,968
As temperatures stabilize, a
grateful city salutes Osmosis Jones.

1064
01:26:03,177 --> 01:26:05,179
The officer who saved us.

1065
01:26:05,471 --> 01:26:09,850
Jones has been reinstated
to the force with full privileges.

1066
01:26:10,059 --> 01:26:13,354
Ozzy, can I count on you
to keep Frank in shape?

1067
01:26:13,604 --> 01:26:16,065
We got that insurance
exam next month.

1068
01:26:16,273 --> 01:26:20,527
You're going to have to talk
to my new partner.

1069
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:24,531
-If he feels like hanging around.
-But my visa's expired.

1070
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:28,619
We'll go to the hemorrhoid
and get you a good lawyer.

1071
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:37,044
Come here, baby. I'm still Jonesing
for a little more Osmosis.

1072
01:27:19,211 --> 01:27:22,756
Oh, my God. Look how beautiful.

1073
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,426
I told you it'd be worth it.

1074
01:27:28,053 --> 01:27:32,099
Didn't think I'd break a sweat
coming up here. But I did.

1075
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:36,103
Yeah, it was kind of a long drive.

1076
01:27:37,062 --> 01:27:38,439
Carrot?

1077
01:27:54,121 --> 01:27:55,789
I wonder what this does.

1078
01:28:00,586 --> 01:28:02,713
-Dad.
-Was that you?

1079
01:28:05,924 --> 01:28:08,302
Out with the old, in with the new.
