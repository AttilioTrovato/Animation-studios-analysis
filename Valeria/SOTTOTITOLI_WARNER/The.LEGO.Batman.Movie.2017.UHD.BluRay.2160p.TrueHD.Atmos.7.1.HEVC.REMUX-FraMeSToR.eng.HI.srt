these pants are just a little tight.

A month ago, I had no dads.

00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Then I had one dad. Now I have two dads!

Superman has zero friends,

basking in sweet, sweet isolation,
here at his alone palace.

So, I'll keep him busy

while you sneak into that vent
and get the Projector. Got it?
