00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,153
For as long as can be remembered,
storks delivered babies

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,157
from their perch on Stork Mountain.

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,199
It was an honor and a privilege to serve.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,989
It was our duty, our core belief,

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,914
the driving force of our very lifeblood.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,479
Aw... Ow!

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,633
It wasn't always easy.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,028
Oh...

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
This was our challenge.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,753
This was our sacred duty.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,151
No matter how tough or impossible

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,553
or brutal or harsh or inhumane or savage,

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,995
we would triumph over adversity.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,548
Phew!

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,074

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,552
Gotcha!

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,118
Oh!

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,350
Hey.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,816
- On your right.
- Left.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Bike lane.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,515
Thank goodness
we don't do that anymore.

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,389
There! Right there!

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,352
The problem was,

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,918
we had the wrong cargo.

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,356
Our new phones!

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,593
Luckily, now, storks deliver
packages for Cornerstore. com!

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,873
- My dude!
- Oh, yeah!

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,875
Yo, Kevron! Lookin' good, my man!

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Oh, I love this guy!

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,190
Perfect landing. Chiggy-check.

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
You're the man!

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
What? Millionth package? Not possible.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,198
I thought I was only at 20.

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
Hey, Junior, are you gonna celebrate?

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,229
You know what? You're right.
I should celebrate.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,696
What are you guys doing this weekend?

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Are you guys free?

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,916
The wife and I
are celebrating another anniversary.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,718
Got my kid's game this weekend.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,514
Family reunion. The whole family's coming.

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,950
Oh. Just wanted to confirm.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
That you were all busy.

44
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
I assumed you were all busy and you are.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,336
So, if anything changes, let me know.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,496
I maybe could get out of work.

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,096
Probably can't,
but let me know if you can.

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,270
Great job out there, brah!

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,998
Thanks, Pigeon Toady.

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,000
Check out my girlfriend.

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,600
- She's in Canada.
- Yeah-huh.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
She migrated.

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,438
- She's not made up.
- Okay.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,397
Look at her! Look at her!

55
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,630
- She exists, brah!
- That's great.

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,075
Hey, did you guys hear about Roger?

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,838
Ah!

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,911
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,319
What? Hey, brah. I say... What? Okay.

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,118
I tell you about my girlfriend?

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,596
Hey, boss wants to see you.

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,829
Uh...

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,718
Hunter wants to see me?

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,670
All right. Head in the game, Junior.

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,671
So, you're Hunter.
What do you do around here?

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
No, I hate that.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,792
Hunter. Nice. To. Meet. You.

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,995
No, that's too robot.

69
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Just say it normal. Just say it normal.
Here we go.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,389
Nice to meet you!

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
What is wrong with me?

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Junior.

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,235
Hunter.

74
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,920
You know why
I built my office entirely out of glass

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,633
even though birds can't see glass?

76
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,435
I do not.

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,910
Power move.

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,835
Eighteen years ago, I saved all storks
by getting out of babies

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,230
and into package delivery.

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,470
Now, this Monday at Storkcon,

81
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,875
the board will announce
they're kicking me upstairs.

82
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,280
I'm going to be named Chairman.

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,999
Which means you are going to be named

84
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,396
boss.

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,795
Boss!

86
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,416
Cool, cool, cool. Very cool, very cool.

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,194
Now, look upon your domain
with your eyes wide open.

88
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,240
- Yeah.
- Wider.

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,355
I love it. Feels good.

90
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,875
How can you be boss
if you can't look at it?

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,235
If I go blind, it was worth it.

92
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,096
You know the hardest thing
about bein' boss?

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,189
Staring at the sun?

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
No, this is easy.

95
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,801
Whether to be like a friend boss
or a distant, weird boss?

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,976
Always be distant and weird.
What's the matter with you?

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Sorry.

98
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,232
No, it's dealing with that.

99
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,715
The orphan Tulip?

100
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,029
I don't understand.

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,158
Do you know why
we stopped delivering babies?

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
Because there are so many
other ways of getting babies?

103
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,836
Yes. But that's not the whole story.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,992
Eighteen years ago,
when we still delivered human infants,

105
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,228
a stork named Jasper
went crazy and tried to keep a baby.

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,713
Tulip's beacon broke.

107
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,555
Her address was destroyed,
so we could no longer deliver her.

108
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,517
My baby!

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,071
It was then I realized that
there was no future in baby delivery.

110
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,313
Now, the orphan Tulip has just turned 18,
which means we can finally liberate her

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,277
and return her to the human world.

112
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,555
But she's no trouble.

113
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,312
Oh, she isn't, is she?

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,351
Here's our profit chart.

115
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
- I love a good profit chart.
- Me, too.

116
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Yeah!

117
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,631
The peaks are when Tulip is on vacation,
asleep or out with the flu.

118
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,519
The valleys are when she tries to help.

119
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,877
Cool. I will liberate her.
Consider her liberated.

120
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,192
And if she doesn't want to be liberated?

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,920
Fire her. I'm talking about firing her.

122
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,995
Really?

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,016
The only thing you need to do
to be named boss on Monday

124
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,234
is liberate the orphan Tulip.

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,976
If I'm not being clear, I mean fire her!

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,115
Yes, sir. I am on it.

127
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,430
I have read between the lines
and heard you overtly.

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,950
Ow, ow, ow...

129
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,670
Excuse me! Orphan Tulip?

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Junior?

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,949
You're talkin' to me?

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,235
Yes, Orphan Tulip!

133
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,271
No, it's just that you never talk to me.

134
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,616
Well, yeah, that's changing
starting today, Orphan Tulip.

135
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Oh, "Tulip" is just fine.
"Orphan" hurts my heart.

136
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,398
I have so many questions to ask you!

137
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,630
Why don't you come down
and we can talk all day?

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,552
Okay. I will be down.

139
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,948
As will my friends.

140
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,469
We are going to fly right down.

141
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
What? No, no.

142
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,216
That's a quail, an emu, there's a chicken.

143
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
They cannot fly.

144
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,675
Yeah. Until now.

145
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,136
She's helping us achieve our dreams.

146
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,752
- That's right, Dougland.
- You know it.

147
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,520
It is still a personal victory
if you use the bucket.

148
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,118
Okay, we'll all not use the bucket!

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,349
Wait, what?

150
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,591
Ha-ha! Tulip doesn't fit in.

151
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,990
We're all the same and she's a weirdo.

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,736
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not nice. She's...

153
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,273
She's had a hard life.

154
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,677
Okay.

155
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,116
This is gonna be great, guys!

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,039
Countdown.

157
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,148
Three, two, one!

158
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,275
Oh.

159
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,199
It's working! We're flying!

160
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,554
Ho-ho! Whoa!

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,194
Yeah, yeah!

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,795
Yeah!

163
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,791
Enough of this, I wanna go fast!

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,715
No! Dougland, wait!

165
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,029
No, no, no!

166
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,031
This is the greatest day of my life!

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,073
I'm flying!

168
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,955
This is my moment!

169
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,320
- Dougland! No!
- Get out of my way!

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,869
Bad Dougland! No!

171
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,190
How could my dreams go so horribly wrong?

172
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,394
I got ya!

173
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,595
Okay.

174
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,909
I'm fallin'.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,389
Oh, no! No! No, no, no, no, no!

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,634
I don't fit in anywhere
and all I want to do is help!

183
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,438
Oh, boy.

184
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,592
Uh, Tulip, okay. I have news for you.

185
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,791
Before you finish,

186
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,680
for you to come to wish me
a happy birthday,

187
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,394
that's just the nicest, you know?
It's like a little rainbow.

188
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,715
So, thank you.

189
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,199
That's really nice.

190
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,136
But, oh, I'm sorry.
I interrupted you.

191
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,276
- What were you gonna tell me?
- Uh...

192
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Oh, boy.

193
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,155
I have wonderful news for you.

194
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,318
You have been liberated.

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,632
What does that mean?

196
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,997
Well, it means that you are
fired.

197
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,792
- What?
- You're...

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,191
Are you okay?

199
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,430
Excuse me. You're...

200
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,192
You're fantastic!

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Really?

202
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,674
Because I just blew up
most of the factory.

203
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,034
Oh, yeah.

204
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,714
What a twist! Um...

205
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,152
Well, it means...

206
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,439
Oh.

207
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,358
I'm putting you in charge
of your very own department.

208
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,069
You are the new head of Letter Sorting.

209
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,677
I didn't even know we still got letters.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,592
We do!

211
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,196
- And now, you're in charge of them.
- Oh, yes! I will rock this!

212
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,509
You will rock this!

213
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,336
- Oh, yeah! Rock it hard!
- Gonna rock it hard!

214
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,998
And what's the number-one rule?

215
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,559
Always deliver!

216
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,358
- Wrong. Never leave this room.
- Oh.

217
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,715
I always thought it was
something more like "Strength"!

218
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,871
- "Determination"!
- Nope. That's way off.

219
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,996
Number-one rule, never leave this room.

220
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,752
Okay, well, if that...

221
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,196
Bored, bored, bored.

222
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,993
So, how was your commute?

223
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,673
Oh, I took the bucket.

224
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,638
Me, too. Real backed up.

225
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,239
Oh, yeah.

226
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,392
You hear about Steve and Gloria?

227
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,789
What?

228
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,712
I hear they're an item.

229
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,949
- No.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,519
Are you kidding me?

231
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,096
Are you guys talking about us?

232
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,016
You guys better not be talking about us.

233
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,598
I told you that in confidence.

234
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,536
You don't make her upset. She's my life!

235
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,754
Oh, no, I said it out loud.

236
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,336
You're not supposed to say anything!

237
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,759
Sorry, guys. Cat's out of the bag!

238
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,717
- No!
- Meow!

239
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,633
Are you gossiping?
No gossip allowed! Go to HR!

240
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,952
I've called you both in because
I hear you've been having problems.

241
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,416
- And it's important we have...
- She's the one who started it!

242
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,576
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

243
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,376
- How dare both of you! You're fired!
- You can't fire me!

244
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,176
- I just did!
- Wait! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that!

245
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,758
- Guys! Group hug!
- Group hug!

246
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,109
Aw.

247
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,112
I'm hugging myself. Okay.

248
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,673
Somebody write me a letter!

249
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,195
Come in, Ninja Commander.

250
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,954
This is Cowboy Astronaut Agent Nate, over.

251
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,111
Ninja Team Commander, are you in position?

252
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,639
I'm about to launch the assault.

253
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,776
We can absolutely do that.

254
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,313
That's not gonna be a problem.

255
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,552
Ha-ha! Dr. LeFreeze!

256
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,911
You may have me outnumbered 7,000 to one,
but you weren't counting on one thing,

257
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,559
I'm not alone.

258
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,478
Ninja force, attack!

259
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,314
Ninja force?

260
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,393
Oh, ow! No! Oh!

261
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,636
This is the end.

262
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,998
Ninja force, tell my wife I loved her.

263
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,639
Gardner Real Estate. Henry...

264
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,313
- And Sarah...
- Gardner!

265
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,029
A house is not a home
without a Gardner!

266
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,997
Ninja Commander, where were you?

267
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,040
- Uh, can you hold one second?
- Can you just...

268
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,918
You promised me that we were taking down
Dr. LeFreeze this afternoon.

269
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,115
You didn't show up,

270
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,430
and now he controls
most of Western Europe.

271
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,959
Ethnic tension is on the rise.

272
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Yeah.

273
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,271
- We're totally done after this call, okay?
- Really?

274
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,440
- Five more minutes.
- And then we'll stop.

275
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,118
We promise.

276
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,436
We never stop.
That's the Gardner promise.

277
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,640
Not even for five minutes.

278
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,896
Oh, look! There's one of our bench ads.

279
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,960
And you know what it says?

280
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,354
"We never stop."

281
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,074
We never stop. We never stop.

282
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,536
There's a stop sign.
We're stopping.

283
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,629
We do stop for that.

284
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,835
I love you, brother.

285
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,395
It's like we're best friends
that live together!

286
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
And we yield.

287
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,800
And the yield
you're gonna get on this house, Kyle...

288
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,736
And that's what we were saying,
like you've gotta be up...

289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,673
Mom, Dad,
I've decided I want a baby brother.

290
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,600
- Oh, honey, can you...
- Can you hold one second?

291
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,908
- Oh...
- Um...

292
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,589
I think we're fine as a family of three.

293
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Why can't I have one?

294
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,911
Let's make this easy.
Where do you get one?

295
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,476
Why are you laughing and not answering me?

296
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,676
Where did you get me?

297
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What is the joke?

298
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,336
Is there a different subject?

299
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,591
Okay, so there's a super weird
vibe in this car right now.

300
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,916
Oh, honey, this is very sweet.

301
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,712
But we have you.

302
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,399
And that's all we need.

303
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,595
That's right.

304
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,096
No, no, no, don't feel bad.

305
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,155
You can call us anytime.

306
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,912
Call us morning, noon or night.

307
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,274
Weekends, holidays.

308
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,160
No, we will pick up the phone
on Christmas.

309
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,456
Oh, well, I don't... Will we?

310
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
Yeah, you can call us on Christmas.

311
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,035
"Dear Stork Delivery Service,

312
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,668
"our adult names are Henry and Sarah.

313
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,719
"We are adult parents
of an absolutely perfect son named Nate.

314
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,280
"He really deserves a baby brother.

315
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,351
"As adults, it is our adult belief

316
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,353
"that it would be irresponsible
if this baby did not have ninja skills.

317
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,997
"Sincerely, adult parents
Henry and Sarah Gardner comma adults.

318
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,759
"Not Nate.

319
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,672
"P.S. He has to have ninja skills!"

320
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Hi-ya!

321
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,874
Nailed it.

322
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,913
Happy birthday, dear Tulip!
Happy birthday to you!

323
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,958
Whoo!
Guys, thank you so much! Oh, my gosh.

324
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,176
Don't you think Junior put
you down here to get you out of the way?

325
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,256
Cheryl, that's not fair.
Why would you say that?

326
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,296
What? I can't help it.
I'm your outspoken friend.

327
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,456
I've never done this before,

328
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,040
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

329
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,152
Aha! A letter!

330
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,359
"The H.I. Department."

331
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,078
Don't know that one.

332
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,515
He said the number-one rule is
"Don't leave."

333
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,759
But if I don't deliver the letter,
I won't be doing my job.

334
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,176
I'll cover for you!

335
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,349
Okay, thanks!

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,200
I have excellent news.

337
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,840
I have taken care of the Tulip problem.

338
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,515
Wonderful.

339
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,997
Monday, it'll all be yours.

340
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,877
Barring any monumental screw-up.

341
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,714
Do you know what we'll do
when you're boss?

342
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,359
No. Tell me!

343
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,800
We'll barbecue together.

344
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,279
We'll point at things together.

345
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
We'll team-build together.

346
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,312
We'll wear suits together.

347
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,592
You'll never be alone
because Cornerstore is your family.

348
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,696
- What?
- And I'll be like your dad.

349
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,119
And you're like my son.

350
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,793
My son-ployee.

351
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,994
And like any family...

352
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,559
No, no, no, no, no.

353
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,517
No, no, no, no, no, no.

354
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,671
How do you turn this thing off?

355
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,751
And racquetball and fishing...

356
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,194
Why are there so many screens?

357
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,674
Turn off, turn off, turn off!

358
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,360
You're about to
get everything you ever wanted.

359
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,839
Great convo, Hunter!

360
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,429
I'm so stupid!

361
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
I should have just fired her!
Why didn't I just fire her?

362
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,632
Tulip!

363
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Hey!

364
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,176
Hey, what are you doing out of the room?

365
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,336
I told you not to leave the room!

366
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,856
Nah, it's cool. I'm covering for myself.

367
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
What?

368
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,359
Okay, we need to get outta here.

369
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,114
Come on. We have to go now.

370
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,716
Junior, you asked me to do a thing,
and I will not fail you!

371
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,518
Always deliver!

372
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,910
Wait! No!

373
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,673
This is the Baby Factory!

374
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,638
This is the Baby Factory?

375
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,711
No, no, no!

376
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,400
See ya!

377
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,635
Why did you do that?

378
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,392
Touchdown Tulip!

379
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,788
Stop celebrating!

380
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,230
I think it was supposed to go over there.

381
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,718
Oh...

382
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,078
You're right. That was wrong.

383
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,755
Oh, come on!

384
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,797
Why didn't we destroy
this place years ago?

385
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,995
Oh, my gosh!

386
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,440
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

387
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,674
Do you see all this?

388
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,637
Junior! This is amazing!

389
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,789
Why put the button there? Uh...

390
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,589
Come on!

391
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,072
Hi-ya!

392
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,949
Is it off?

393
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,394
Uh, I believe so.

394
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,635
Are you okay?

395
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,268
Your wing looks a little mangled.

396
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,994
My wing is fine. It's A-O-great.

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,638
Yeah, that seems bad.

398
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,028
Let's go.

399
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,072
This place is dangerous.

400
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,671
Huh. What is that?

401
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,593
Cool beans.

402
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,548
- What?
- What?

403
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
- What's happening?
- Mom, Dad.

404
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,468
The storks are bringing me a baby brother!

405
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,756
That sounds like
a nice dream, buddy.

406
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,990
Let's go back to sleep, honey.

407
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,674
This is the best day of my life!

408
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,592
This is the worst day of my life!

409
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,239
Hunter's gonna kill me!

410
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,496
- Why don't we just tell someone?
- Are you insane?

411
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,360
If anyone finds out about this,
I am dead meat.

412
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,198
My hopes of becoming boss destroyed.

413
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,828
No, no, no.

414
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,191
Come on!

415
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,068
What up?

416
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,952
- Hey, Pigeon Toady.
- Hey, there.

417
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,519
Hey, cool metal thing, brah.

418
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,432
New kind of package? What's in it?

419
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,272
- Candy canes.
- Some gas. Uh...

420
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,790
Cool, brah. You catch the game last night?

421
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,856
- Oh, yeah. Real great game.
- Excellent playing.

422
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,472
Yeah, too bad about the last quarter.

423
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,716
- Yeah, that was too bad.
- Real bummer.

424
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,348
And yet then with a little
time left, we pulled it out...

425
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
- Totally!
- Yeah.

426
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,597
Only to lose it again
in the last second.

427
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,557
- Such a disappointment.
- It was a comedown.

428
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
- Only to get it back.
- Best day of my life!

429
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,136
- Only to lose it!
- Worst day of my life!

430
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,275
Only to get it back.

431
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,520
A roller-coaster of a game!

432
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,631
Only to lose it again.

433
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,360
What a game! Here we go, see you later.

434
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Bye!

435
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,676
Cool. No big deal.

436
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,717
Wait... Wait a second.

437
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,713
There was no game last night.

438
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,233
What the...

439
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,232
Come on. Let's get to my workshop.

440
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,958
We'll be safe there.

441
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,792
All right, okay, all right, all right.

442
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,632
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

443
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,394
We just need to keep a low-pro here. Okay?

444
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,352
If one person sees a stork with a baby,

445
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,755
my chances of being named boss
are ruined. So...

446
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
What are you doing?

447
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,456
- I wanna see the baby!
- No, no, no.

448
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,520
We do not open that thing.

449
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,949
Just a brief exposure
to baby cuteness can ruin your life.

450
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Remember Jasper?

451
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,376
Hmm. I'm trying to put my finger on it.
I can't think of who...

452
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,616
You're being sarcastic because
he changed the course of your life.

453
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
- That's right.
- Yeah.

454
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,440
Huh. How about this?

455
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,038
Huh. All right, Storkcon is on Monday.
Today is Friday.

456
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,954
If I can just deliver this thing by then,
I can still be named boss.

457
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,634
Gardner family, here I come!

458
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,912
But your wing's broken. You can't...

459
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,275
Make a plan! Stick to the plan!

460
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,919
Always deliver!

461
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,715
I'll never fly again!

462
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
What's that?

463
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Hmm? What's what?

464
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,359
That. Right there.

465
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,278
Uh... Oh, that? No.

466
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,475
That's nothing.

467
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Looks like an airplane.

468
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,791
Well, it kind of is an airplane, I guess.

469
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,228
Great! I'll use it.

470
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,874
Oh, well, it kind of took me
a long time to make,

471
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,075
like years and years...

472
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,920
Great. All leading to this moment.

473
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm saving it for something else.

474
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
- For what?
- Hmm?

475
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
What were you gonna use it for?

476
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,633
Uh, it's my dream to deliver packages
for Cornerstore.com.

477
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,157
Oh, well, hey there, kid.

478
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,437
Now's your chance.

479
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,791
- Uh, I don't know.
- Yeah.

480
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,991
I don't even know if it flies.

481
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,315
Eh, uh...

482
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,155
You know what?

483
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,550
Yeah, you can use it.
Let's deliver this baby.

484
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,835
Are you sure though?

485
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,390
- Uh...
- All right, let's do it!

486
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,440
Okay, great.
Let me show you how to fly this.

487
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,152
Um, hello? I'm a bird.

488
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,878
I'm pretty sure I know how to...

489
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,834
I was wrong! I was immediately wrong!

490
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,314
Of course, the autopilot button.
That makes perfect sense.

491
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,920
I knew that. I was testing you.

492
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,696
Oh, you were testing me
on a thing that I made.

493
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,456
- That's correct.
- Is your seat wet?

494
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,616
Yep. That's my urine.

495
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,437
I peed in the seat when we were falling.

496
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,552
Whoo. What else do you want to talk about?

497
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,312
My baby.

498
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,353
Now, I really think you're
gonna love this one, Becky.

499
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,800
I think we found you a good one.

500
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Yeah, when we saw this,

501
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,071
we looked at each other
and we were like, "Wow."

502
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,559
"This is theirs." Yeah.

503
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,216
- And it's a fixer-upper...
- Yeah. It is.

504
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,696
Which I know we weren't looking for.

505
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,757
But at least it's not a fixer-downer.

506
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
Oh, honey, can you just...

507
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,336
- Can you hold one second?
- Yeah, can you?

508
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,376
- You're up. You're up.
- What? No, it's not my turn.

509
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,709
- You're up, now. You're up.
- It can't be.

510
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
So you want a panic room, okay.

511
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,035
Uh...

512
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,355
Nate?

513
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
What?

514
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,308
Nate?

515
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,992
Hey there, buddy.

516
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,195
Whatcha doin' here?

517
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,435
I'm preparing.

518
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,999
Right, you're preparing.

519
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,593
For what?

520
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,751
To get my baby brother from the storks.

521
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,114
Right.

522
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,553
Hey, I love your school encourages
imagination over actual learning,

523
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,712
- but the storks don't deliver anymore.
- I know.

524
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,216
They haven't done that in, like, forever.

525
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,760
Dad, you don't have to help me at all.

526
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,598
This is a guilt-free pass for you
to go back inside and work.

527
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Just go.

528
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,349
- Go. Shoo, shoo, Dad. Go.
- What?

529
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,995
Okay, all right. Fine.

530
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,559
You blink and I'll be in college.

531
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,869
What was that?

532
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,679
Hmm? No, I'm just walking, working.

533
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,956
- I didn't say anything. You should just...
- Okay.

534
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,096
Remember when I was a baby?
It felt like one minute ago?

535
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,350
- What?
- What? Hmm?

536
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Fine.

537
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,096
Dad, you'll be my idol
for, like, two more years.

538
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,439
Okay, I heard that one.

539
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,318
Okay. All right, look.

540
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,677
Five minutes. That's all the time I have
is five minutes, and then we stop.

541
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Yeah, five minutes.

542
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Five minutes, and then...

543
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
We stop.

544
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,591
Five minutes and then we stop.

545
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,959
What?

546
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,915
Powder?

547
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,633
Baby powder.

548
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,116
Homing pigeon powers activate!

549
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,471
Ah!

550
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,277
Baby, what are we
gonna call you, baby?

551
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,991
This is crazy.
We are delivering a baby!

552
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,792
No, we are delivering a package.

553
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,320
Maybe we should name it
instead of calling it "the package."

554
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,072
We do not name the package, okay?

555
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
It's very simple.

556
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,436
We make a plan. Stick to the plan.

557
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,192
Always deliver.

558
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,432
And then we get back to Storkcon
so the board can name me boss.

559
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,669
Oh, it's so exciting.

560
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,836
What can we expect from boss Junior?

561
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,336
Oh, you know that's top secret.

562
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
- You can tell me. Come on.
- It's gonna be big!

563
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,336
Like what? Like, what, how big?
Like, what are you gonna do?

564
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,351
I prefer not to talk about it right now.

565
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,629
- Do you not know?
- What?

566
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,976
- Oh, my gosh. You don't know.
- I know.

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,736
If you don't know,
then why do you wanna be boss?

568
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,795
- I know.
- You don't.

569
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,520
Oh, man,
you laugh when you're uncomfortable.

570
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
No.

571
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,320
- Am I pushing your buttons?
- Uh, no.

572
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,759
- Yes, I am.
- Nah. No.

573
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,416
- Beep, beep, boop, boop...
- No, those aren't even where my buttons

574
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,759
would be if I had buttons.

575
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,256
- Beep, beep, boop, boop...
- So, nice try.

576
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,776
I am programming you to tell me
why you want to be boss.

577
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,916
I love robots, so this is fun.

578
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,376
We're having a good time together.

579
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,056
Why do you wanna be boss?
Why do you wanna be boss?

580
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,479
Back off!

581
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Oh, God! No!

582
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,239
No, no, no!

583
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,839
Wow! Well, that was funny.

584
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
You almost died.

585
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,036
I guess the lesson we learned today is
don't ask me why I want to be boss, right?

586
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,749
Okay, good talk.

587
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,480
Good talk.

588
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,513
That didn't sound happy.

589
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,433
Yeah, well, the package
will be delivered soon enough.

590
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,635
Uh...

591
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,936
I really think that
we should check that out, you know.

592
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Ah, just relax.

593
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,798
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

594
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,315
Ah, you see, the package has
cried itself gently to sleep.

595
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,792
I can't take it!

596
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,951
Can't help body movements! Must open pod!

597
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,235
Wait! No!

598
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,799
The pod! Gotta open the pod!

599
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,880
Oh, no! No, no, no!
Come back! Come back!

600
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,816
- Be there in a jiff!
- Pull yourself together!

601
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,360
- Fly this plane!
- Gotta open the pod!

602
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,038
We're gonna die!

603
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,640
Well, at least the baby's quiet.

604
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,989
Are you out of your mind?

605
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,912
A baby cries and you crash a plane?

606
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,991
Hey, hey, hey! I was busy with the pod!

607
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,993
Why didn't you turn on the autopilot?

608
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,640
I was panicking! Listen to me, Tulip.

609
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,056
- You crashed a plane, did you hear me?
- The baby is quiet.

610
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,798
- You crashed a plane!
- The baby is quiet!

611
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,256
- The baby is quiet?
- The baby is quiet!

612
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,918
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Oh, no!

613
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,229
Why is it quiet?

614
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,034
Open the pod! Open the pod!
Open the pod! Open the pod!

615
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,400
How do you open this thing?
How do you open it? Come on!

616
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,232
Aw.

617
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
Oh, my gosh.
You know what I just realized?

618
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,438
This baby and I have the same birthday.

619
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,238
Oh, yeah. I don't care.

620
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,320
You crashed the plane.
I don't need you anymore.

621
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,954
I'm going to deliver
the package myself. Goodbye.

622
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,555
What? You're breaking up the team?

623
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,195
"Team"? What is wrong with you?

624
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,271
You and I are not a team. We are nothing.

625
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,998
There is no "we."

626
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,354
This is all your fault. This.

627
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,875
This. This!

628
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,197
All of this.

629
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,958
A good day to you, Orphan Tulip.

630
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,394
A good day.

631
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,158
Well, just so you know, I'll be fine.

632
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,873
I'm the most popular person
in the entire Letter Sorting department.

633
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,760
- I can't hear you!
- I said that...

634
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,536
Yeah, it just sounds
like "Blah, blah, blah,"

635
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,788
but mixed with crying.

636
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,656
But that's not what I'm...
Junior, come here.

637
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,056
I can't hear what you're saying,
but I assume it's lame.

638
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,560
I said I'm the most popular person...

639
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,392
Lame!

640
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,233
Tulip's dumb.

641
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,356
There's a reason she doesn't fit in.

642
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,239
Ifyou're smart enough to build a plane,
then who wrecks one?

643
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm gonna deliver this package
and be back at Stork Mountain in no time.

644
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,393
Oh, great. Now I'm surrounded by wolves!

645
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,120
What are you gonna do,
knock me unconscious?

646
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,349
Perfect!

647
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,235
Oh, seriously?

648
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,436
I'm not talking to you. I'm mad at you!

649
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,456
Oh, no. Really? What am I gonna do?

650
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,936
We are done! This conversation is over.

651
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Last word, me!

652
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
- Last word.
- Me.

653
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,838
- Last word. Last word.
- Me. Me. Me.

654
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,475
Listen, I'm the alpha.

655
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,776
I'm gonna eat this thing first.

656
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,153
I'm gonna be the new alpha.

657
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,959
No. There is no...
There's no need for a new alpha.

658
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
I'm the alpha!

659
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,640
- You...
- You're not even a beta.

660
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
I'm the alpha!

661
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,718
No, you're not the alpha!

662
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,110
Aw!

663
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,680
What just happened?

664
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,997
- What was that?
- What did that thing just do?

665
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,236
- I'm sorry. Where were we?
- Oh, yeah.

666
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,113
I'm gonna devour this thing.

667
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,589
I'm gonna bite her arm clean off.

668
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,136
You didn't bite her arm clean off.

669
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,639
This tastes like flowers.

670
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,233
Okay, stand aside.

671
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,496
Look at you. Look what you did.

672
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,431
I did the same thing you did.

673
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,640
- Are you in love?
- I am in love.

674
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,016
- Are you in love?
- I'm in love, too.

675
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,296
I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree.

676
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,719
Hey, guys!

677
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,115
This tiny thing is now a wolf, everybody.

678
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,016
- What did he say?
- What? What's happening?

679
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,296
- Louder. We're in the back!
- We're keeping it!

680
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,520
- Back of the pack, we're keeping it!
- Okay, thank you.

681
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Aw, look at that.

682
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,216
The delivery is now complete.

683
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,416
Now, I just need to find
a way out of here.

684
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,680
Wait, you're not gonna deliver
her to her actual parents?

685
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,229
Baby doesn't know the difference
because babies are dumb.

686
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,555
Oh, babies are not dumb.

687
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
They are super dumb.

688
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,696
Babies have a higher level of intelligence
than we will ever understand.

689
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,336
You sound like a baby
that learned how to talk.

690
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,816
I am a baby that learned how to talk!

691
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,990
Hey, I want to teach it
to walk around in circles

692
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,720
- before it lays down.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

693
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,896
That's my favorite thing to teach.

694
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,216
Don't get too close,
you're gonna scare it!

695
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
I'm not... Ow!

696
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,835
Aw!

697
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,868
- Huh. The baby, it's laughing!
- Yeah. Good for it.

698
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,075
No.

699
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,515
Okay, I apologize for what
I'm about to do.

700
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,668
- Ow!
- Sorry.

701
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,096
Aw!

702
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,235
- Stop it!
- Sorry.

703
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,356
Sorry.

704
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,112
- That's my face!
- Sorry!

705
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,798
- Why did you stop?
- Come on!

706
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,996
Okay, I get the plan.
I can fake it. I can fake it!

707
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,639
Okay, okay. Fake it!

708
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,069
Ow!

709
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,176
Wait!
Hold on a second, okay? Wait.

710
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,758
All right, I have an idea.

711
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,071
Imagine how much harder
she could hit me if you cut us down.

712
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,515
Oh, yeah! I could really wail on this guy.

713
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,109
I mean, you don't have to
go that hard, but...

714
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,111
- Oh, I think I do.
- Well...

715
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,759
Oh, I'm still mad at you.

716
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Cut 'em down!

717
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,429
Grab a stick or something!

718
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,794
Wait, what?

719
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,233
Aw!

720
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,471
Do you want more?

721
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,074
Yeah!

722
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,959
Will this tiny twig be enough?

723
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,838
- Yes!
- No! No!

724
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Bigger!

725
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,520
Get the biggest twig you can find!

726
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,154
Sorry, Junior.
Gotta give the people what they want.

727
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,918
Grab the baby! Let's go!

728
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,518
Wolf pack, chase!

729
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,696
Chase, chase, chase.

730
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,976
Why wouldn't you stop hitting me?

731
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,200
I was distracting them.

732
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,355
Okay, here we go.

733
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,456
Oh! Oh! We should untie the bridge!

734
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,160
Yeah, I know. What do you think I'm doing?

735
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,472
Chase, chase, chase.

736
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,513
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

737
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,593
Suck it, wolves!

738
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,314
Wolf pack! Form of wolf bridge!

739
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,678
Hut, hut, hut.

740
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,715
What is happening?

741
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,840
The wolves are forming
a suspension bridge.

742
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,520
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

743
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,874
All right, let's go!

744
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,758
A bridge!

745
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,873
We're probably gonna die!

746
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,189
Chase, chase, chase!

747
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Let's go!

748
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,176
- The door!
- Leave it!

749
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,120
Almost gotcha,
almost gotcha, almost gotcha!

750
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,320
Oh, my gosh!
We can use that thing as a thing!

751
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,873
Right! To thing to the thing!

752
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,598
Let's go!

753
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,176
- You sound like a monkey.
- You sound like a monkey!

754
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,909
Wolf pack, form of wolf boat!

755
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,475
Boat!

756
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,868
Are you kidding me?

757
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,359
That is so unpredictable!

758
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Ha-ha!

759
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,199
Wolf pack! Form of submarine!

760
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,588
Submarine!

761
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,360
I didn't know wolves could
form a submarine!

762
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,397
I've never seen that before
on nature shows.

763
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,232
Okay, quick, get to the plane!

764
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,656
What? I thought it was broken.

765
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,910
No, I fixed it with some spare parts.

766
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,475
We're gonna get ya. We're gonna get ya.

767
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
All right, let's go!

768
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,395
Junior!

769
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,280
Obviously, I'm not gonna push it.

770
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,679
Wait!

771
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,997
Oh, I could push it so easily.

772
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,674
It would take
such a little amount of force.

773
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,275
Don't look at me like that.

774
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,393
If you don't give us Tiny Thing,
we're gonna eat you.

775
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,959
We're gonna eat you anyway!

776
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,314
You don't say it.

777
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,550
You make the deal
and then you eat them anyway.

778
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
Gotcha!

779
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,995
We're not going to eat you!

780
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,474
Well, now it's too late!

781
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,471
Oh, no! No!

782
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,278
- Junior!
- Let's go!

783
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,149
All right, let's fly!

784
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
It doesn't fly.

785
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,118
- What?
- It falls!

786
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,317
Why did I save you?

787
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,159
Whee!

788
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,558
Wolf pack! Form of wolf plane!

789
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,111
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go!

790
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,470
Tiny Thing, come back!

791
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,518
Oh, come back, Tiny Thing. We need you!

792
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,752
My baby.

793
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,756
Hmm.

794
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
What?

795
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,474
Five more minutes and then we stop

796
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
What?

797
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,995
- Five more minutes...
- No!

798
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
That's our chimney!

799
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,480
You're gonna destroy the whole roof?

800
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,716
Mom, we have to replace
the chimney with a slide

801
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,871
for when the storks deliver
my baby brother.

802
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
What he said.

803
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,549
No! Don't be crazy.
You cannot do the chimney.

804
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,392
Come on, don't make me the mean mom.

805
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,551
- Dads are fun, moms are mean.
- I heard that!

806
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,392
- Parent conference.
- Pinching!

807
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,710
Henry, people are gonna think we're crazy.

808
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,989
We need to tell him.

809
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Tell him what?

810
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,673
What, to go watch more TV?

811
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,553
This is the best time I've had
with Nate in my life.

812
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,080
I actually feel like a dad again.

813
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,356
And when no baby brother shows up?

814
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,590
Well, then we tell him.

815
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
We can get a new chimney,

816
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,056
but we'll never be able to
replace this time with Nate.

817
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,798
And if we put those headsets back on,

818
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,235
how old will Nate be
when we take them off again?

819
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,668
I'm not a jerky teen yet.

820
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,195
Fleeting moments, precious memories.

821
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,278
Moms are fun, too.

822
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,594
Wow! That's...
That's not a well-made chimney.

823
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,560
I'm... I'm a small woman
and that just came...

824
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,033
Yeah, that came right down!

825
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,470
Okay, so, uh, what's next?

826
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,113
Okay, it's Saturday night.

827
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,590
As long as we deliver by tomorrow,
we can still make it for Storkcon Monday.

828
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,911
Thanks for waiting for me back there.

829
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,136
I don't know what you're talking about.

830
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,976
Oh, okay, "I'm too manly to
admit anything at all about anything."

831
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,040
Is that supposed to be me?

832
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,556
Oh, sorry, "This is a more
accurate representation."

833
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,314
Oh, you're so right.
That is what I sound like.

834
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,277
Let's both talk like this.

835
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,032
Baby's fussing.

836
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,156
She's bored. We have to distract her.

837
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,469
Oh, let's see. Oh!

838
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,029
You are a baby
You are a baby

839
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Little hands, little feet

840
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,096
- Look at you, you're so sweet
- JUNIOR: Stop! Stop! Stop!

841
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,155
You're so cute I wanna...

842
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,616
Let's just step aside, all right?

843
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,416
- And let me do it.
- You want to sing to her?

844
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,668
Yeah. Is that so surprising?

845
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,353
I'm a pretty good singer, actually.

846
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,913
Okay, fine! Sing to her.

847
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
When you need a little something

848
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,709
And there's too much to do

849
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,440
Just click your little finger
And we'll ship it for you

850
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,831
Cornerstore, Cornerstore. com

851
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,976
F ree shipping does not apply
in Alaska and Hawaii.

852
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,672
Wait, wait, wait, is that a song?

853
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
That's not a song, that's an ad.

854
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,396
- Well, strap in for this one then, Tulip.
- Okay.

855
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,153
Cornerstore

856
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,355
I like how this is going.

857
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,034
Let your packages rain down on me

858
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,757
Uh, this looks like a good place
to rest for the night.

859
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,376
Junior, what are talking about?
Why are you acting...

860
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,576
I can't hear what you're saying.

861
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,591
- Junior?
- I can't hear you!

862
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,629
Junior!

863
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,192
Hmm...

864
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,552
Hey! Have you seen
a red-headed lady and a stork?

865
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,755
A bird and a lady?

866
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,496
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

867
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,717
I saw two that fit that
description the other day!

868
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,912
No, man, I will not be your friend.

869
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,356
Sorry, thought we were vibing.

870
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,198
Why you being so creepy?

871
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,755
You know what? Just get... Here. Here.

872
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,077
I'm just gonna
put this right here.

873
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Uh...

874
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,799
What happened back there?

875
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,313
What? What do you mean?

876
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,835
Uh, you stabbed the raft?
For literally no reason!

877
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,309
It was not for no reason.
It was for personal reasons.

878
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,670
Anyways, there's a port
right there on the coast.

879
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,336
We'll just leave
first thing in the morning

880
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,793
and deliver the package.

881
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,754
Just call it "the baby."

882
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,478
Why are you so afraid of babies?

883
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,816
Because this one single package

884
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,229
could ruin everything
I've worked towards my entire life!

885
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,536
- Why do you wanna be boss again?
- Not this again.

886
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,630
No, really.
Why do you wanna be boss of Cornerstore?

887
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,473
I don't know, okay? I mean...

888
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,073
Why does anyone want to be boss?

889
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
It rules. That's why.

890
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,311
Yeah, but what would you do?

891
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,319
- I don't know. What would you do?
- I'm glad you asked!

892
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,438
Well, for one, I would employ a more
diverse variety of birds and animals.

893
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,631
Two, I would get rid of
the Cornerstore warehouse

894
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,313
because that building is a bummer.

895
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,552
And three, I would start
delivering babies again.

896
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,320
Okay, you were very prepared
for that question.

897
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,600
Man, I feel so close to you.

898
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,776
Like we're girlfriends already.

899
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,136
All right, I knew as I was saying it

900
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,656
that I should just keep my mouth shut.

901
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,478
Aw, I want to braid
your feathers immediately!

902
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,638
Look, uh...

903
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,069
Yeah?

904
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,515
While we're being real honest right now,
I'll tell you why I built my plane.

905
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,592
It's not to deliver packages
for Cornerstore.com.

906
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,834
I built my plane to find my parents.

907
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,551
But I thought you didn't know
where your parents lived.

908
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,517
When Jasper destroyed my
homing beacon, I lost all the pieces.

909
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,033
Except one.

910
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,391
And I thought this, plus some luck
might be enough to find my parents.

911
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,870
So, you sacrificed your plane
for this baby?

912
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,712
- Yeah.
- Why?

913
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,873
Oh, I don't know.
I guess if this baby finds her family,

914
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,798
I mean, it's worth it.

915
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,515
Right?

916
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,071
Fine. You can name her.

917
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,759
- Really?
- Yeah, go ahead.

918
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,035
Diamond Destiny.

919
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,536
Okay, I changed my mind.
You can't name her.

920
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,136
Too late! Her name is Diamond Destiny.
Yes, it is!

921
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,776
I thought it was gonna be,
like, an actual name.

922
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,456
It is a name. Diamond Destiny is her name!

923
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,391
Isn't that right, Diamond Destiny?

924
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,230
We're gonna find your parents,
and everything is gonna be just perfect.

925
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,153
You'll find your family.

926
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,634
You think?

927
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,028
For sure.

928
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,559
Good night.

929
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,748
Good night!

930
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,911
Huh!

931
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,554
What is it? I'm up.

932
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,599
Do you think she's hungry?

933
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,034
Yeah. I don't know.

934
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,236
Uh, maybe she just needs to be rocked.

935
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
Okay.

936
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,440
Oh, my gosh.

937
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,999
Her eyes could not be more open.

938
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,673
Okay, grab that end.

939
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,233
It's like we're a family.

940
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,509
We are not like a family.

941
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,831
We're just a guy and a girl
trying to put our baby to sleep.

942
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,558
Let's just put her to sleep.

943
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,319
Come on, close, close, close.

944
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,311
Okay, close. Close, close, close.

945
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,456
That's good, right?
Is that closed enough?

946
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,160
No! Look, I can still see eyeball.

947
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,596
Can we manually close them? Here.

948
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,637
No! Don't do that!
What are you doing?

949
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,776
I'm gonna... Wait!
Okay, give me the eye glue.

950
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,616
- What?
- You know, for gluing eyes shut.

951
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,198
No, we don't have any.

952
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,515
It's gonna stick.

953
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,150
What if she never goes to sleep?

954
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,656
All right, you know what? I got her.

955
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,376
You just go to bed.
You go to bed. It's fine.

956
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,153
No, I don't wanna go to bed
if you're gonna be up. I'll feel bad.

957
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,400
I know. But if I go to bed,

958
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,976
then I'm gonna feel guilty.
And I just can't.

959
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,336
No, that's what I'm saying.
Listen to me.

960
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,749
No, so that's why you go to bed,
and I'll take care of her.

961
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,232
All right. I'll go to bed.

962
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,120
I can't believe you went to bed!

963
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,136
What? You just said it was
okay for me to go bed!

964
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
Okay, you know what?

965
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,839
Can we just rock her in our arms?

966
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,831
No. We do not. No loving the baby.

967
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,194
You said "baby."

968
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,759
Fine. I don't care. I don't care.

969
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,355
You love it.

970
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,477
Goodbye, brah!

971
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,480
How you like me now? Huh!

972
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,191
"How you like me now"?

973
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,190
How you like me now?

974
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,795
How do you like me now!

975
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,076
Now there was a time

976
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,111
When you loved me so

977
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,069
I could do no wrong

978
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,711
And now you need to know

979
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,915
Dance break!

980
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,593
How you like me now? How you like me now?

981
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,115
And you're sure you saw this?

982
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,748
Yes, I'm sure I saw this.

983
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,837
All right. Let's keep this quiet.

984
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,274
Yes, sir.

985
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,317
Thank you for your loyalty, Pigeon Toady.

986
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,916
Or should I say boss.

987
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,153
Cool, cool, cool.

988
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,957
Whoa!
Steam room in an elevator. Mind blown!

989
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
Shut up! I'm planning.

990
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,320
Oh, that's cool.

991
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,595
All right. Now, listen.

992
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,273
First, we have to stop that delivery.

993
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,869
But we don't know where they're headed.

994
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,469
Indeed. We won't go to them.

995
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,755
We'll make them...

996
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,029
Come to us.

997
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,872
Yes!

998
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,912
Well, I'm off.

999
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,911
You're in a suit suddenly.

1000
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,195
Let's go.

1001
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,077
My towel blew away.

1002
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,634
Junior.

1003
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,136
Wake up. We gotta go.

1004
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,195
I'm still asleep.

1005
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,616
I know, we gotta go, we gotta go.

1006
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,136
Just let me sleep a little longer.

1007
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,549
Junior. Baby's awake.
Ship's leaving. Let's go!

1008
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,836
You do it. You get the baby.

1009
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,638
Junior, I'm tired, too!

1010
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,995
You made it, you get it.

1011
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,280
Hey!

1012
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,073
Ooh!

1013
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,308
Yes!

1014
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,936
Diamond Destiny,
you come back here right now.

1015
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
I'm not fooling around.

1016
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,576
All right, let's go.
We got a boat to catch.

1017
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,256
We got a boat to catch, oh!

1018
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,320
Here we go. On it.

1019
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,555
Home stretch!

1020
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,151
We have to be absolutely silent.

1021
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,999
One human sees a stork with
a baby and we'll get reported.

1022
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,355
All right, last one.
Let's pack it up.

1023
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,549
What was that?

1024
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,789
Sounds like a baby.

1025
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,639
That's very suspicious.

1026
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,997
- Why is she doing that?
- I don't know.

1027
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,639
Diaper?

1028
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Check.

1029
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Food?

1030
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Check.

1031
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,960
Maybe she needs a nap.

1032
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,656
Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop

1033
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,591
Nope. What is it? What does she want?

1034
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,880
It's coming from over there!

1035
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,296
I don't know. She's reaching for you.

1036
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,320
Maybe she just wants you.

1037
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,919
No. That doesn't make sense.

1038
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,920
Technically, she should be
perfectly happy.

1039
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,856
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

1040
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,279
I have no idea.

1041
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Oh, no!

1042
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Oh, no.

1043
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,838
She's gonna blow! She's gonna blow!

1044
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
What do I do with her?

1045
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,560
Take her, take her. Just take her!

1046
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,872
- Ah, look at that.
- Hmm.

1047
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,680
Actually seems to be working pretty well.

1048
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,195
Ha! She smells so nice!

1049
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,551
Who's got the little sparkly eyes? You do.

1050
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,234
You do.

1051
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,436
Oh, no! The boat's leaving!

1052
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,191
No, no, no! Come on!

1053
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,919
Wolf pack. Form of wolf minivan!

1054
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,148
Minivan!

1055
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,152
Ow, ow, ow...

1056
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
Give me a break!

1057
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,840
- Click, click.
- Click.

1058
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,149
My baby!

1059
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,696
Ah! We got the Tiny Thing!

1060
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,480
This is not a safe way
to transport the baby.

1061
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,915
- We're parents now.
- Just go slower.

1062
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,311
- You're right, you're right, you're right.
- Slower.

1063
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,875
Okay, good.

1064
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,118
Is that good, Tiny Thing?

1065
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,999
Hmm? Tiny Thing?

1066
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,798
We lost her again!

1067
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,314
Quick! We can get to
the boat through here.

1068
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,674
Ah!

1069
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,200
Wait. Why are you running so weird?

1070
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,191
What don't I know?

1071
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,592
My old nemesis.

1072
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,598
"Glass."

1073
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,473
Birds can't see glass!

1074
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,520
Give us Tiny Thing.

1075
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,716
Just go, Tulip. It's too late for me.

1076
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,840
You've got the baby.
You can deliver her yourself.

1077
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,956
What? No, I'm not leaving you behind!

1078
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,951
We can do this. Together!

1079
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,997
Where's the Tiny Thing?

1080
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,616
- All right. Tulip, you got this!
- Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!

1081
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,816
- Okay, left. Right. Straight.
- Where's the Tiny Thing?

1082
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,876
Straight! Left! Right!

1083
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,071
Oh, no! I'm panicking!

1084
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,435
Uh, right again! Left, I mean. Left!

1085
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,919
Right! Right, I mean.

1086
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,952
Left! Left! Right! Right!

1087
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,633
Left! Left! Left! Right!

1088
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,154
Rolft! I mean, ralft!

1089
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,399
Right! Left!
I'm just shouting words!

1090
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,232
This is not working!

1091
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,111
Oh-oh! We did that together!

1092
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,856
I ran into every piece of glass.

1093
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,154
Some, more than once.

1094
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,429
Oh, jeez.

1095
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,199
Ah!

1096
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,656
What are the chances of that?

1097
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,280
I guess, pretty high in a glass factory.

1098
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,396
- Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!
- Come on!

1099
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,397
First, we're gonna take Tiny Thing

1100
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,028
and raise her to be a strong,
independent woman.

1101
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,760
And then,
we're gonna eat you.

1102
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,919
We made a great team.

1103
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,878
My baby.

1104
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,311
That's my baby!

1105
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,998
It's Jasper!

1106
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,195
My baby!

1107
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,197
- No, no, no!
- My baby! My baby! My baby!

1108
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,395
Let go!

1109
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,232
Let go of us!

1110
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,391
Wolf pack, form of...

1111
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,033
Broken heart!

1112
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,470
Cry! Cry!

1113
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,829
Get away from us!

1114
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,200
- Get away!
- Stay back!

1115
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
- Go home!
- Come on!

1116
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Don't make me hit you!

1117
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,358
- Hey, hey, hey! Let me explain!
- I don't wanna hear it!

1118
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,016
When you orphaned me, you said "whoops!"

1119
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,680
Whoops! You said "whoops!" Who does that?

1120
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,392
Will you please let me explain?

1121
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,710
Hey! She doesn't wanna hear
your explanation, guy!

1122
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,955
Back off!

1123
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,111
I fell in love with you.

1124
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,480
Okay, fine.

1125
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,398
Honestly, I am very curious.
Let's hear it.

1126
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,675
Look, they tell you being
a stork isn't gonna be easy.

1127
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,955
Always deliver.

1128
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,078
I failed to do that.

1129
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,152
Your beacon broke. The pieces scattered.

1130
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,873
I spent my entire life

1131
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,670
searching for the missing pieces
so that I could deliver my baby.

1132
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,516
And yet, after all these years,
I'm still missing one piece.

1133
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,696
- But, I have pledged...
- Oh, my gosh! Wait.

1134
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,472
To be the parent
I took from you, Tulip.

1135
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,358
And I will lay down my life.

1136
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,192
I have the missing piece!

1137
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,873
Excuse me, what?

1138
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,110
I have the missing piece.

1139
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,439
My home!

1140
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,268
I'm going home!

1141
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,476
I'm gonna finally meet my real family.

1142
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,119
Oh, my gosh!

1143
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,151
This is crazy! Junior, can you believe it?

1144
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,873
No, that's so... That's so great.

1145
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,633
Yeah, yeah, you should go.

1146
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,198
Oh, yeah, well, after we deliver the baby.
But, yeah!

1147
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,351
No, no, no. I can take care of the baby.

1148
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,635
You should go now.

1149
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,856
No, no, no.
We have to finish the delivery.

1150
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,949
I'm sorry to cut you off.

1151
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,078
You know what's so funny is
just then when you said "real family",

1152
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,640
it, like, weirdly hurt my feelings.

1153
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,950
But I realized how stupid that is.

1154
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,356
I mean, I'm a bird
and you're, like, a sloppy human

1155
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,034
and that's not our baby.
It's just some baby.

1156
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,272
Well, I mean, we're not, like, a "family",
but we are like a family.

1157
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,989
Well, it's like we are
except instead we're more like employees

1158
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,816
who are delivering a package,
and that's all.

1159
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,159
Do you know what I mean?

1160
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,616
And you should go to where you belong.

1161
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,834
Now. Do you know what I mean?

1162
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,718
No! Junior, we are a team, okay?

1163
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,080
We're gonna deliver this baby,

1164
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,336
then we're gonna meet my parents,

1165
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,670
- then I'm gonna show them Stork Mountain.
- I was supposed to fire you.

1166
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,909
Okay?

1167
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,670
You were supposed to fire me?

1168
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,193
Yeah.

1169
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,033
Well, "liberate". "Free". Yes, fire.

1170
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,816
And then I didn't,
and then this all happened.

1171
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,240
Look, there's nothing waiting for you
back at Stork Mountain.

1172
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,355
Who cares though?

1173
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,336
It's time for you to go
and meet your real family!

1174
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,271
That's exciting, right?

1175
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Look, I...

1176
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,034
I just think this is
for the best, you know?

1177
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,237
It's what you've always wanted.

1178
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,720
Yeah, I wanna go meet my family.

1179
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,513
So, yeah, I better go now, I guess.

1180
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,910
It's gonna be fine.
I'll take good care of her.

1181
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,395
- Okay, okay.
- Fine.

1182
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,714
Goodbye, little girl.

1183
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,871
Have a good trip back home.

1184
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,439
You take care...

1185
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,875
And be safe.

1186
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,436
I'm scared.

1187
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,637
They're your family.
They're going to love you.

1188
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,717
I'll be right here.

1189
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,433
Oh, oh! Give me your camera.

1190
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,955
I'd love to capture this family moment.

1191
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,552
Okay, camera rolling and action.

1192
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,671
Yup. Okay.

1193
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,474
Ring the doorbell.

1194
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,951
I don't hear a doorbell ringing.

1195
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,557
You're right. Let's take our time.

1196
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,950
I've only waited my whole life for this!

1197
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Tulip?

1198
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,997
Hmm?

1199
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,513
The storks!

1200
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
Oh, boy!

1201
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,256
- Here we go!
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

1202
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,736
- Okay. Big smile!
- I'm a little nervous. Okay.

1203
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,193
Everyone, calm down!

1204
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,793
This is not to code.

1205
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,558
- What?
- This all has to come down.

1206
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
Hunter?

1207
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,311
- You're fired!
- But, but, but...

1208
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,296
"But, but, but..."
You are so idiotic!

1209
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,548
How were you not suspicious?

1210
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,760
I thought it was
a gentrifying neighborhood.

1211
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,871
Didn't expect to see you here, brah!

1212
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,712
Oh, yes, I did. I set it up.

1213
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,109
Seize the thing!

1214
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,752
Wait, no! Not the baby!

1215
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,431
Don't worry. She's gonna be fine.

1216
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,709
She's with penguins.

1217
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,641
They have whole documentaries
about how great they are at babysitting.

1218
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,096
And she'll be an excellent swimmer.

1219
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,873
And then when she's old enough,
we'll return her to the human world.

1220
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,395
That's insane! You need to deliver her!

1221
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,836
We can't let it get out that the new
boss accidentally made a baby!

1222
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,956
Our stock would plummet,
everything we've built.

1223
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,390
My entire company will fall apart!

1224
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,232
Those parents can never find out.

1225
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,118
Okay, we're ready to go.

1226
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,711
Who's the baby now?

1227
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,195
Good enough.

1228
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,117
- "Cease and desist"?
- Why?

1229
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,919
This is not up to code,
and quite frankly, it looks dangerous.

1230
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
We can't tear it down.

1231
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,320
'Cause then the storks won't
deliver my baby brother.

1232
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,636
The policeman's right, Nate.

1233
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,792
They don't deliver babies. Not anymore.

1234
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,752
Then why did we do all this stuff?

1235
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,430
Because we were having
such fun playing with you.

1236
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,512
Oh, honey. We spent time together.

1237
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,432
And that's what matters.

1238
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,955
So is this like
a ticket thing or a warning thing?

1239
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,400
It feels like a warning, right?

1240
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,480
Yeah, we are warned.
We are properly warned.

1241
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,072
Oh, buddy.

1242
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,874
Come on.

1243
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,435
What?

1244
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,560
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

1245
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,960
What happened? Where's the baby?

1246
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,319
They tied me up and took her.

1247
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,816
Why would you think this was her house?

1248
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,616
It's surrounded by
a bunch of scary warehouses!

1249
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,640
Gentrification!

1250
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,816
How could they just take her?
She was your responsibility!

1251
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,016
It wasn't my fault, okay?

1252
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,936
I'm not blaming you.
I'm just worried about the baby!

1253
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,916
Well, I'm also worried,
which is why I'm yelling!

1254
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,680
We're yelling 'cause we're wasting time!

1255
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,638
How can we
get back to Cornerstore?

1256
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,793
You're shopping? What are you doing?

1257
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,256
Oh, I see.
You did that so we could hide in the box

1258
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,576
and get back to Cornerstore real quick.

1259
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,715
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1260
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,588
Wait a minute. Junior, what is going on?

1261
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,515
What the heck is this?

1262
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,318
This is Storkcon.

1263
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,392
Once a year, storks come
together for one thing.

1264
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,560
Storkcon!

1265
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,508
The biggest stork convention
on the planet Earth, where birds and...

1266
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,874
- Uh, Junior?
- What?

1267
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,800
What are you doing?
We have to save the baby.

1268
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,671
I'm just a huge fan of Storkcon.

1269
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,068
'Cause it's so cool.

1270
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,595
There. Look, look, look!

1271
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,716
They're headed
towards the flight deck.

1272
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,553
What? It calms me.

1273
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,759
Presenting the world's first round box

1274
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,239
Sphericus!

1275
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,957
Circles can hold dreams!

1276
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,672
How are we gonna get through this crowd?

1277
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,159
Hello.

1278
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,836
I'm full of dreams!

1279
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,915
Hey, you guys aren't
supposed to be back here.

1280
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,600
Pardon me, big guy.

1281
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,920
I'm full of dreams!

1282
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,200
Listen to me, Tulip.

1283
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,919
Even if we get the baby,
we have no way to get out of here.

1284
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,314
Storkcon is huge

1285
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,240
for storks come from
all across the world...

1286
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,576
Junior, stop talking about Storkcon!

1287
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,816
All right, I'm sorry.

1288
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,440
It's just really impressive. Here we go.

1289
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,591
Put down that baby!

1290
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,753
Whoo!

1291
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,160
Growth analytics suggest
increased bandwidth

1292
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,959
enabling us to silo
creative core components.

1293
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,120
I got your text.

1294
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,896
Sorry, but we could only find
one jet pack.

1295
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,336
All right, give me the pack.
I'm taking her.

1296
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,800
- What? No, I'm taking her.
- No way.

1297
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,056
When you had her last, you lost her.

1298
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,071
- After you left us.
- After you fired me!

1299
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,520
'Cause you're bad at everything.

1300
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,856
- I wish I'd never met you.
- Whoa! Wow,

1301
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,216
well, you know what?
I wish I'd never met you.

1302
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,976
The only good thing
to come out of all of this

1303
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,136
is this baby, and I am taking her.

1304
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,856
This baby is far too precious
and perfect for you. I'm taking her!

1305
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,056
- I'm taking her.
- I'm taking her!

1306
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,911
- I'm taking her!
- I'm taking her!

1307
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,031
What is that?

1308
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,639
My pants fell down. Oh, no!

1309
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,150
- Where are we going?
- I don't know!

1310
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,039
Oh, okay. Not that way.

1311
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,280
Not that way either.

1312
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,440
Hey, guys.

1313
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,917
This is very overwhelming.

1314
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,000
Hand over that thing!

1315
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,954
Come one step closer,

1316
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,312
and I will drop this.

1317
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,073
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

1318
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,311
Junior, look, hand over the baby,
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

1319
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,515
More than that.

1320
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,716
You can still be...

1321
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,069
Why isn't it working?

1322
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,040
One baby?

1323
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,912
How about a million!

1324
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,115
Wait, no!

1325
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,674
Danger. Danger.

1326
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,274
I did not think that through.

1327
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,199
No!

1328
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,389
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- Aw!

1329
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,751
You stop it this instant!

1330
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,711
Shut it down! Shut it down!

1331
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,678
This is my moment!

1332
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,434
Whoa!

1333
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,234
Ooh!

1334
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,115
Oh, no!

1335
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,309
Uh...

1336
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,794
Uh-oh.

1337
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,791
- Let's go!
- Come on!

1338
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,951
Go, go, go! Grab it!

1339
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,256
- Over here. I got this one.
- Catch it!

1340
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,077
Got it! Whoo!

1341
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,639
Out of my way! Out of my way!

1342
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,959
Oh, no!

1343
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,477
One million babies!

1344
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
Oh, hi.

1345
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,955
- Oh, no!
- No!

1346
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,155
Come on!

1347
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,555
Now it's time to do what
I should've done so long ago.

1348
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,394
Destroy the Baby Factory!

1349
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,595
No, you can't.

1350
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,016
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

1351
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,519
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

1352
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,016
We could go on like this all day.
I'm just gonna go on

1353
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,712
and destroy the Baby Factory.

1354
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,195
Goodbye, baby-making machine.

1355
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,479
What the heck?

1356
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,599
Told you babies were smart.

1357
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,034
Babies are dumb.
Babies are super-duper dumb.

1358
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,336
- No, no, no.
- No, no. Wait, no.

1359
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,920
- Diamond, give it back!
- You stop it, this instant! Stop! Stop!

1360
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,909
Come on!

1361
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,155
What?

1362
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,590
No!

1363
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,074
Whoa!

1364
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,829
Now get over here and get me out of here.

1365
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,080
Oh!

1366
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,431
All right. Don't move.

1367
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,276
Whoa!

1368
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,675
What?

1369
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,800
Oh, no.

1370
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,480
No!

1371
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,590
Always deliver!

1372
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,440
Whoo! You did it!

1373
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,113
I can hear my bones.

1374
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,435
Yeah, we should land
because this hurts so much.

1375
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,200
We did it! We did it! We're a family!

1376
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,271
Yes! We're a...

1377
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,552
Sorry, I kinda ruined the moment there.

1378
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,557
I just have so much internal bleeding.

1379
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,318
We're a family!

1380
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,669
Look at that.

1381
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,189
Uh, what? What? I thought it was broken.

1382
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,600
I guess it was just dislocated.

1383
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,360
It must've popped back in when we landed.

1384
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,073
Oh, yep. What a twist.

1385
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,469
- Oh, no.
- Uh...

1386
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,108
So many of them.

1387
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,400
They're pulling my feathers!

1388
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,357
What are we going to do?

1389
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,520
All right, everybody.
Gather around. Gather around.

1390
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,079
An annoying person
asked me once why I wanna be boss.

1391
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,549
Well, I never knew why until today.

1392
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,593
Baby delivery is our true calling.

1393
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,194
This is not just a bunch of
metal and glass

1394
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,511
and whatever that giant
magical crystal-looking thing is made of.

1395
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,150
This is the heart of what storks were
put on this Earth to do.

1396
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,435
This is our mission.

1397
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,670
We pride ourselves on customer service.

1398
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,798
Well, this is a family that never
got the baby they asked for.

1399
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,269
Make a plan.

1400
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,078
Stick to the plan.

1401
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,554
Always deliver.

1402
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,634
That's great. This is great.
But we don't have any pods.

1403
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,156
Wait! Everyone, stop. Would you stop?

1404
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,320
Hey!

1405
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,270
- What about these?
- Yes!

1406
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,475
Thank you, Jasper!

1407
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,755
I agree.

1408
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,559
Baby delivery is what we're born to do.

1409
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,431
Should we do anything about him?

1410
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,675
It's...

1411
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,955
It's fine.

1412
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,638
They're here! Oh, my gosh.

1413
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,120
I can't believe it! They're here!

1414
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,469
They're here!

1415
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,429
Aw...

1416
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,634
Sign here.

1417
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,835
And sign here.

1418
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,393
Initial here.

1419
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,518
Initial here, here, and...

1420
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,317
I love you, my little lady.

1421
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,637
And we always will.

1422
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,954
Bye.

1423
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,309
Oh, so you deliver to the front door.

1424
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,471
So we didn't have to destroy
our entire house.

1425
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,640
Yeah.

1426
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,030
Yo, Stork! I ordered a brother!

1427
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,674
I ordered a brother!

1428
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,871
You wanna feed her her bottle?

1429
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,799
Ninja skills.

1430
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,595
You okay?

1431
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,478
Of course. I'm fine.

1432
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,670
Oh, this does not feel good.

1433
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,637
Is every delivery gonna be like this?

1434
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,439
What can I say? It's a terrible business.

1435
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,114
I feel so sad all the time.

1436
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,391
No. I'm actually fine now.

1437
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,576
Yeah, it looks like you're
handling stuff real well.

1438
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,636
Yeah. Look good, feel good.

1439
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,792
Yeah, pretty cool, man.

1440
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,638
Just enjoying it.

1441
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,473
You know, I'm here if you
wanna talk about anything.

1442
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,760
- I'm here to listen.
- Nope.

1443
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,976
Okay, well, it seems like
you're handling it pretty well.

1444
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Yeah, I am.

1445
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,696
- You're shaking.
- You're shaking!

1446
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,496
Junior, it's okay
to let your feelings out.

1447
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,520
I'm not feeling.

1448
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,600
- It's healthy.
- I have no feelings!

1449
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,908
Come on, let it out.

1450
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,035
Hey.

1451
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,030
We're all right behind you.

1452
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,789
Go on.

1453
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,876
Who is it, honey?

1454
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,752
Who is it, Dad?

1455
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,119
Mom and Dad?

1456
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,834
All right, guys.

1457
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,433
We delivered her.

1458
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,600
Let's go.

1459
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,829
Junior!

1460
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,239
Where are you going? Get over here.

1461
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,400
Yeah!

1462
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,120
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

1463
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,799
You love it.
