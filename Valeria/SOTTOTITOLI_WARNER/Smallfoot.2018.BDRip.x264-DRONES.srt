1
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:32,587
This is my world.

2
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:36,124
Harsh, jagged, freezing.

3
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:38,127
And I gotta say,

4
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,661
it's awesome!

5
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:41,530
It's got everything.

6
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:44,399
Ice, rocks, ice, snow, ice.
It's got a lot of ice.

7
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,035
Plenty of modern amenities.

8
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,103
And the best part,
everyone's happy.

9
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:49,639
That's because
our world is built

10
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:52,041
on a foundation of stones.

11
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:54,010
Not those. These.

12
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,346
See, we have these laws
that are written in stone.

13
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,081
Literally, written in stone.

14
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,185
Interpreted and enforced
by the Stonekeeper.

15
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,654
The stones are here to
protect us and keep us safe.

16
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:07,089
They pretty much tell us

17
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:08,690
everything that we need
to know.

18
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,459
Important stuff, like how
the world was created...

19
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:13,231
when we all fell from
the butt of the great sky yak.

20
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:16,598
And how our world is an island

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,468
that floats on a sea
of endless clouds

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,771
resting on the backs of
the great mountain mammoths.

23
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:24,339
And how we have to feed ice

24
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,741
to the mammoths
so they don't overheat.

25
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:27,476
'Cause if they did,
they would die

26
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,380
and we would all fall
into the great nothing.

27
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,315
There's nothing
down here!

28
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:34,050
But my favorite
stone of all

29
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,318
is the one that says
the gong must be rung

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,521
to wake
the great glowing snail

31
00:01:38,523 --> 00:01:40,455
so it can crawl across the sky

32
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,724
and bring light
to the village.

33
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,459
I love that one.

34
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:47,429
It might be the most
important job of all.

35
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,234
And, humble brag,
that job belongs to my dad.

36
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:58,107
He does it with passion,
commitment,

37
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:59,642
and the help of
his able-bodied assistant.

38
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:01,643
Up and at 'em, Migo!
Time to ring the gong.

39
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:02,779
Me.

40
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,514
Yes!

41
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:07,182
I guess you could say
I'm learning the ropes.

42
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:08,186
And the wheel.

43
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:13,056
And the crank.

44
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:14,790
Because if my dad
didn't ring the gong,

45
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,159
we'd all be in the dark.

46
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,326
Launch!

47
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:21,264
It isn't easy.

48
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,066
It requires skill,
rock-solid nerves,

49
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:25,735
and a good,
strong head on your shoulders.

50
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,117
Because there's literally
no other way to ring a gong.

51
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,773
Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,277
It gives my dad
a great sense of purpose.

53
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,279
Like I said,
it's an important job.

54
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,150
A job that'll one day be mine.

55
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,684
Whoo-hoo! Good one, Dad!

56
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:44,420
And I can't wait
for the day

57
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,689
that it's me
who gets to wake the village.

58
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,124
<i>Look at everybody there below</i>

59
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,760
<i>All the yetis
that I love and know</i>

60
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:55,700
<i>And they're waking up to see
this awesome morning</i>

61
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:59,635
<i>They've all got a smile
on their face</i>

62
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,671
<i>Another reason
I love this place</i>

63
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,574
<i>'Cause it's always
full of life</i>

64
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,641
<i>And never boring</i>

65
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:10,278
<i>Look all around us</i>

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,881
<i>It's all rock and ice and snow</i>

67
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:14,816
<i>Frigid and freezing</i>

68
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,185
<i>Yeah, it's pretty great
I know</i>

69
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:20,490
<i>And hey, hey,
it's another day</i>

70
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,325
<i>Like every other</i>

71
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,659
<i>I don't wanna change a thing</i>

72
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,796
<i>Not one little thing, I mean</i>

73
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:29,532
<i>Because I do
what the stones say</i>

74
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,701
<i>And I'm doing okay</i>

75
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,869
<i>What could be better
than this?</i>

76
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,671
<i>It is what it is</i>

77
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,177
<i>It is perfection</i>

78
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:47,149
<i>Look at everybody
do their part</i>

79
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:49,819
<i>And they do it
with a happy heart</i>

80
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:54,189
<i>And it gives them all
a sense of greater purpose</i>

81
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,492
<i>Well, that's the way
that I wanna be</i>

82
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:59,427
<i>I wanna make 'em all
proud of me</i>

83
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:03,665
<i>Just be a steady yeti
at their service</i>

84
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,367
Do you seriously believe

85
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,601
mammoths are holding us up?

86
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:08,303
What's holding
up the mammoths?

87
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:09,539
Hello.

88
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,839
It's just mammoths
all the way down.

89
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,274
Don't listen to them.

90
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:13,308
They're questioning
the stones.

91
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,910
And we don't do that. Okay?

92
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:18,847
<i>If there's a question
causing you to go astray</i>

93
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:22,885
<i>Just stuff it down inside
until it goes away</i>

94
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,721
- Got it?
- Where's Migo?

95
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,455
Migo, you will never
be the gong ringer...

96
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:28,657
Wait, what?

97
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,859
...if you don't practice.

98
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,527
He's giving you
your own helmet.

99
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:32,794
Oh, I blew the surprise!

100
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:34,296
Sorry, Dad.

101
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:36,632
My own helmet?
You mean today's the day?

102
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:37,636
Congratulations, Migo.

103
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:39,969
Big day, son!

104
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,305
Hey, everyone,
I get to do a practice gong!

105
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:45,575
<i>And now we all say</i>

106
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,411
<i>Hey, hey,
it's another day</i>

107
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,979
<i>Like every other</i>

108
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:52,315
<i>And I don't wanna
change a thing</i>

109
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:53,883
<i>Not one little thing</i>

110
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:57,587
<i>I mean, because we like
living this way</i>

111
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,822
<i>And we're doing okay</i>

112
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,957
<i>What could be
better than this?</i>

113
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,926
<i>It is what it is,
it is perfection</i>

114
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,395
<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

115
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,698
<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

116
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,433
<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

117
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,001
<i>I said doo-doo-doo, doo-doo</i>

118
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:14,704
<i>It is perfection</i>

119
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:16,738
<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

120
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,442
<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

121
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,875
<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

122
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:22,745
<i>I said doo-doo-doo, doo-doo</i>

123
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:25,815
<i>It is perfection</i>

124
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,383
Practice gong!

125
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:28,618
Practice gong!

126
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,385
- Practice gong!
- Practice gong!

127
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,287
- Practice gong!
- Practice gong!

128
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,522
- Practice gong!
- Practice gong!

129
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:36,291
You ready?

130
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:37,892
Beyond ready! Can't wait
till this is my actual job!

131
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:42,330
Yup. Soon you will join
a long line of family greats.

132
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,500
Uncle Flathead,
Grandpa Smashhead,

133
00:05:44,502 --> 00:05:45,834
Great Grandpa Shelfhead,
Aunt Crushedhead,

134
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:47,536
Uncle Mushbrain,

135
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:49,337
Aunt Bam Bam, No-neck Nando,
Cousin Squatly,

136
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:52,008
Doug.
And his dumb mallet theory.

137
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,875
We don't talk about him.

138
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,443
And your mom.

139
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,779
Wish she was here
to teach you.

140
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:00,315
- You're doing great, Dad.
- Thanks, son.

141
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,450
Okay, first, check your wind.

142
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,753
Doesn't take much
to blow you off course.

143
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:05,887
Wind, check.

144
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,491
Good. Now, true your aim.

145
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,659
You'll never succeed
if your aim isn't true.

146
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,361
Aim, check!

147
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:14,363
Great! Now, this is important.

148
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:15,731
Even though you know
it's gonna hurt,

149
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,467
you gotta hit it head-on.

150
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:19,669
Does it really hurt?

151
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,536
Only for the first
year or two.

152
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:23,471
Did you actually
used to be my height?

153
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:25,041
Nope, I was much taller.

154
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,875
Took me years to achieve this.

155
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,810
Never missed a day!

156
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:30,512
- Oh, yeah!
- Cool!

157
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:31,647
- Ready?
- Ready.

158
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,851
Say the word, son.

159
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:35,051
Launch!

160
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:37,753
Did I mention

161
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:39,387
- you gotta keep your feet up?
- No.

162
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,657
- You gotta keep your feet up.
- Check.

163
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,592
Okay. Launch!

164
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:46,395
Launch!

165
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,698
Launch!

166
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,900
Never seen that happen.

167
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,435
Launch!

168
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:57,640
Attaboy, Migo!

169
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:04,779
Meechee.

170
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:07,817
Migo, true your aim!

171
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,851
True your aim!

172
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:11,289
Oh, no.

173
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,698
My helmet!
Where's my...

174
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,450
What is that?

175
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,489
Hey, hey! What?

176
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,800
Go! Get away!

177
00:07:58,536 --> 00:07:59,834
Stop it!

178
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,003
Not funny!

179
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:02,998
Look at your small foot!

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,900
Small foot.

181
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,673
Smallfoot. Smallfoot!
Oh, my gosh, it's a smallfoot!

182
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,442
Oh, no! No. Come back!

183
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,513
Oh, holy wowness!

184
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,516
Everyone!
You gotta see this!

185
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,421
Come here, come here,
come here!

186
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,754
Hey, everyone!

187
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:27,956
Listen, listen! Everyone!

188
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,023
Hey, Migo.
You missed the gong.

189
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,526
I know.

190
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,893
- You missed the gong, Migo.
- I know.

191
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:33,495
Come here. Gather round,
gather round. Okay.

192
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:36,898
I saw a smallfoot!

193
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,999
- What?
- What?

194
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,067
- What?
- What?

195
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:40,134
- What?
- What?

196
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:41,804
- What?
- What?

197
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,175
Just come here and see for
yourself! Let's go, come on!

198
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:48,176
- Everyone, let's go!
- Okay.

199
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,485
He's crazy!

200
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:55,820
Dad!

201
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,105
It came at me from the sky.

202
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:19,608
It was like some sort of
hard, shiny flying thing!

203
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,876
It made a sound like...

204
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,579
And that's when
it scooped me up!

205
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,850
Look, it's right this way.

206
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,889
No! But...

207
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:35,192
No! No, no! No!

208
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:39,695
It was right here!

209
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:41,897
Look, I swear!
This shiny, flying thing.

210
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,632
That's what the smallfoot
shot out of.

211
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:45,133
It was like, poof!

212
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,335
And then this big skin thing
landed on top of it.

213
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,104
It was like...

214
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,772
And then it saw me,

215
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:52,641
and it sang the most strange,
beautiful song.

216
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,609
It was like...

217
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,311
Almost, it was more like...

218
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,148
Oh, it's probably still around here somewhere.
Let's look for it. Come on, everyone!

219
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,883
Still around here?

220
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:03,252
- It could be in the village!
- It could be at my house!

221
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:04,820
Get the children!

222
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:06,689
Migo's gone crazy!

223
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,823
He said he saw
a smallfoot!

224
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,958
Is that possible?

225
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,593
Oh, there you are!

226
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:12,127
- Is it real?
- Wait! Hold on! Everyone!

227
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,964
It didn't seem all that scary!
It was kind of cute!

228
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:20,234
Everyone, make way for my dad!

229
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:22,338
I mean, the Stonekeeper.
Sorry, Dad.

230
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,706
I mean, Stonekeeper.
Come on, Thorp. You blew it.

231
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,742
Good morning, everyone!
Hey, how are you?

232
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:27,977
Oh, boy.

233
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,210
Is this about Migo
missing the gong?

234
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:30,679
Stonekeeper,
he saw a smallfoot!

235
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:32,080
It might still be out there!

236
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,382
He said it fell from the sky!

237
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:35,850
Garry, calm down.
You know how you get.

238
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:37,353
Okay, I'll try.
But I'm just so scared.

239
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:40,022
Now, I know Migo has gotten
you all very anxious

240
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,857
with his little story,

241
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:45,360
but there's nothing to fear
because it isn't true.

242
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:47,729
But I saw one!

243
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,632
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

244
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,734
You can't have seen it
because it doesn't exist.

245
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:53,636
I know, I know.

246
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:54,869
Because the stone says there's
no such thing as a smallfoot.

247
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:57,373
Yeah, right there,
clear as day.

248
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,843
I know, but it was right there
in front of me!

249
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,644
Hey, Migo!

250
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:04,245
How do you know
it was a smallfoot?

251
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,882
Because it had a small foot.

252
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:09,350
Dad?

253
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,786
Daddy, clearly,
he saw something.

254
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:14,089
Oh, I'm not denying
he saw something.

255
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:16,691
Most likely, he slipped,
hit his head,

256
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,161
got confused and saw a yak.

257
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:21,330
Oh, okay, I get it now.

258
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:24,299
Because if Migo is saying
he saw a smallfoot,

259
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:26,368
then he's saying
a stone is wrong.

260
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:29,872
Is that what
you're saying, Migo?

261
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,339
That a stone is wrong?

262
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:33,676
Nope! He is not saying that!

263
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:36,310
Let me talk to him.
Kids, right?

264
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:38,180
Migo, what are you doing?

265
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:40,382
Challenging the Stonekeeper
in front of the whole village?

266
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,850
Dad, what's the piece of advice
you're always giving me?

267
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:44,085
Do what you're told.

268
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,454
- The other one.
- Blend in.

269
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,156
The other one.

270
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,990
Follow the stones.
Be a cog. Do your part.

271
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:50,392
Never disagree
with the Stonekeeper.

272
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,127
Always be true!

273
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,863
That was about hitting a gong.
Not challenging a stone.

274
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,833
'Cause if it goes against
a stone, it can't be true!

275
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:00,301
But if I say I didn't see
a smallfoot,

276
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:01,869
then I'm lying.

277
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,372
Migo...

278
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:05,239
I thought you wanted
to be the next gong ringer.

279
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,742
I do.

280
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,911
Then are you still saying
a stone is wrong?

281
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,247
If saying I saw a smallfoot
means that a stone is wrong,

282
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,148
then I guess I am.

283
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:23,224
Oh, Migo.

284
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:27,028
It pains me to say this,
it truly does.

285
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,034
But you leave me no choice.

286
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:34,203
Disobeying the stones
is a grave offense.

287
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:35,738
From this day forward,

288
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,406
you will be banished
from the village!

289
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,307
What?

290
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,376
Until you are ready
to stand before us all

291
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:43,112
and tell us the truth.

292
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,013
I am telling the truth.

293
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:48,316
That's all, everyone.
Back to work.

294
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,917
Let's make it

295
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,521
another perfect day.

296
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:54,288
Stonekeeper, please.

297
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,023
That's my son.

298
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,259
Just give him a little time
alone out there to think.

299
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,264
He'll come to his senses.

300
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,343
- Sooze.
- Hey!

301
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:16,945
You're banished, remember?
You know what that means.

302
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:18,046
Yes, Thorp.

303
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:19,848
You do? What does it mean?

304
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,150
- Thorp!
- Coming!

305
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,216
We'll circle back.

306
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:58,554
Few can survive
the cold, brutal environment

307
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,254
of the Himalayas,

308
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:03,325
but this ingenious creature
defies the odds.

309
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,560
The rare Himalayan
jumping spider!

310
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:08,863
This week on
Percy Patterson's Wildlife!

311
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:12,533
This agile arachnid can lay
1,000 eggs at a time

312
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:15,305
and can jump 50 feet
into the air!

313
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:20,142
There's an element
of mental preparation,

314
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:21,344
I'm sure.

315
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:26,480
It's attacking!

316
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:28,050
Oh, no!

317
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,517
The venom!
It's going to my brain!

318
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,052
I can't feel my face.

319
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:33,387
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

320
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,522
Cut!

321
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:37,025
I'm melting before your eyes.

322
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,493
Percy!

323
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,094
And we'll add an effect.
Melting, melting, melting.

324
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,530
Percy!

325
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:43,431
Cut this bit out.
I'm gonna shut one of my eyes.

326
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,200
Oh, my eye! My eye!

327
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:48,070
Cut! What are you doing?

328
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,403
I'm saving our show.

329
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:51,974
Me being attacked
would get huge ratings!

330
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,910
Our show is educational
and enlightening!

331
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,277
A show that promotes respect

332
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,312
for our fellow creatures
on this planet.

333
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:00,916
I know.
That's why no one's watching.

334
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,517
That's why I don't watch.

335
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,887
Look, Brenda, unless
our spider jumps, it's boring.

336
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,455
Hey, it jumped!

337
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:12,393
Now, that was exciting.
Did we film that?

338
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:13,929
No, of course not.

339
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,229
All right, I'll just have
to go over here

340
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,599
and interview a piece
of bark, shall I?

341
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,001
- Yeti.
- What?

342
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:21,103
Plane crashed in the snow.

343
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,137
Teeth, claws, huge!

344
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,174
I saw a yeti!

345
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:31,079
Yeti, you say?

346
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:33,681
Let me buy you a drink and
you can tell me all about it.

347
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:35,117
You believe me, right?

348
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,618
Of course,
I believe you!

349
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,320
You do?
You can trust me.

350
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:39,457
I fly planes!

351
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,062
Migo.

352
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,196
Who's there?

353
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:50,464
Migo.

354
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,066
Hello?

355
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:54,171
Smallfoot?
Is that you?

356
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,508
Maybe you are going crazy.
No wonder no one believes you.

357
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,009
We believe you.

358
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:03,612
Hi.

359
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,247
Migo.

360
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,580
- Fleem!
- What?

361
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:08,416
You guys.

362
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:11,285
Is it just me, or does he look
disappointed that it's us?

363
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,355
- You want proof that you saw what you saw?
- Yeah.

364
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:14,622
We got proof.

365
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:15,957
So, you believe me
that I saw a...

366
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,426
A small...

367
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:19,727
- They're listening.
- Who?

368
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:21,562
The ears of oppression.

369
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:23,397
Yeah.

370
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,333
This way, stealth mode.

371
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:31,976
Could this day get
any more bizarre?

372
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:34,141
Is this too close?

373
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:36,177
You know what you are now?

374
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,412
One of us.

375
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,013
Hey, wait up!

376
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:43,385
One of us!
One of us! One of us!

377
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,153
Now, don't tell Gwangi
I said this,

378
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:46,455
but he's a bit paranoid.

379
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:47,522
Fleem,
are you talking about me?

380
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,657
Do you see what I mean?

381
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:52,394
- Kolka talks to rocks like they can hear her.
- Fleem!

382
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:54,695
I've been told I'm pesky,
annoying, and a real pain,

383
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:57,232
but, hey, who listens
to their mom, right?

384
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:00,702
Where are you taking me?

385
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,704
Our leader requests a meeting.

386
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,438
Wait, you have a leader? Who?

387
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,543
You'll see.

388
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:12,684
Oh, boy.

389
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:22,159
He's here.

390
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:27,495
Meechee?

391
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,197
Welcome!
I'm really glad you're here.

392
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,733
What?

393
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,235
What is this place, exactly?

394
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:37,472
The secret headquarters
of the S.E.S.

395
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,740
The Esias?

396
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,574
No, no, no.
It's three letters.

397
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:42,043
Like S-E-S.

398
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,712
Stands for
Smallfoot Exists, Suckas!

399
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:45,246
Fleem.

400
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,448
It's Smallfoot
Evidentiary Society.

401
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,583
I mean, my name's got
a lot more pizzazz, but...

402
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,685
Wait. You're, like,
a smallfoot club?

403
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,187
And, hold on.

404
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:54,522
You're the leader?

405
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:55,791
But you're the
Stonekeeper's daughter.

406
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,359
Look, I love my father,

407
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:58,627
but he isn't exactly
what you would call

408
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:00,128
open to new ideas.

409
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,496
Because questions
lead to knowledge.

410
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:04,499
And knowledge is power.

411
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:07,135
So you don't just believe
in the smallfoot,

412
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:08,770
you've been looking for one.

413
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,705
Yes. You see all the X's?

414
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:12,840
We have searched
the entire mountain

415
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:14,208
for years trying to find one.

416
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,543
Why are you looking for X's?

417
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:16,778
We're not looking for X's.

418
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,547
We're looking
for the smallfoot.

419
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:19,848
And you have seen one.

420
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,515
But I can't prove it.

421
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,385
That is where we come in.

422
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,454
Gwangi, show him the evidence.

423
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:27,558
Here's your proof.

424
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:33,494
First item, smallfoot pelt.

425
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,730
Evidence suggests it sheds
its skin annually.

426
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:40,135
Second item, smallfoot horn.
We believe it only has one.

427
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,170
And then there's this.

428
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:45,540
The scroll
of invisible wisdom.

429
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,843
Just imagine the amazing stuff
they put on here.

430
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,645
A bunch of crap,
if you ask me.

431
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,746
This proves nothing!

432
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:54,215
Show him the last one.

433
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:55,716
It's the first piece
I ever found.

434
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:57,586
It's the thing
that started all of this.

435
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,120
That was a trigger.

436
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:00,522
He's triggered!

437
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:04,291
Look at your small foot.

438
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:05,860
- You did see one.
- Where did it go?

439
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,262
- I don't know!
- Think!

440
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,864
- Reach into your memory!
- Slap him!

441
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,332
No! It got whisked away
on the wind, over the clouds!

442
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,403
Which way? Up?
Sideways? Where?

443
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,338
Down!

444
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,906
Did you say down?

445
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,507
- Slap him!
- Fleem!

446
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,208
Down! Of course!

447
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,476
You know,
I have always thought

448
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,778
it was weird
that a mountain floats

449
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,347
when there's obviously

450
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,182
some invisible force
pulling us downward

451
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,382
and keeping everything
around us

452
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:30,918
from drifting off
into the sky.

453
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,587
Of course, this is just
a theory.

454
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,423
But that's why
we haven't found one up here.

455
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:40,494
Because it's down here.
Below the clouds.

456
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:44,331
And if you want proof,
that's where we need to go.

457
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,837
In...
In the nothing?

458
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,338
You're crazy.

459
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,572
Don't call me crazy.

460
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:53,175
Yeah. Never call
a crazy guy crazy.

461
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:54,542
You want to know why
it's called the nothing?

462
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,410
Because there's nothing
down there!

463
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:57,646
Why do you believe that?

464
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:59,380
Because it's in the stones.

465
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:01,483
So is the one that says
there's no smallfoot.

466
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:02,650
And yet, you saw one.

467
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:03,918
Yeah. Why is there a stone

468
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,587
that says something
doesn't exist?

469
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:07,355
Doesn't that just prove
that it actually does?

470
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,591
And if one stone is wrong,
then others could be as well.

471
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,726
What? Other stones?

472
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:13,928
How many do you
think are wrong?

473
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,397
The whole robe.

474
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,827
You know what? This whole
thing's insane. I'm out.

475
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:20,935
Migo, wait.

476
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:22,670
Hey, I just wanna prove
that I saw a smallfoot

477
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,339
so I can get un-banished.

478
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,241
But you, you wanna, what?

479
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,943
Tear down everything
our world is built on?

480
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:31,512
It's not just about
tearing down old ideas.

481
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:33,447
It's about finding new ones.

482
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,919
You know what, come with me.

483
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:45,926
<i>Take a look around</i>

484
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:48,830
<i>And see the world
we think we know</i>

485
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:52,234
<i>And then look closer</i>

486
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:55,770
<i>There's more to life
than meets the eye</i>

487
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,005
<i>A beauty to behold</i>

488
00:21:58,007 --> 00:22:03,514
<i>It's all much bigger
than we know</i>

489
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,819
<i>It's only just beginning
to unfold</i>

490
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,020
<i>So let it all unfold</i>

491
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:16,791
<i>Far beyond all reason
in your mind</i>

492
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:21,529
<i>There's a world mysterious,
there for you to find</i>

493
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:26,268
<i>All these questions
that we always had</i>

494
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,535
<i>All we are is curious</i>

495
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:30,672
<i>There's nothing
wrong with that</i>

496
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:35,443
<i>So go 'round every corner</i>

497
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:39,813
<i>Search every part of the sky</i>

498
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:44,521
<i>'Cause a life
that's full of wonder</i>

499
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:48,359
<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

500
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:02,870
<i>Dig beneath the surface</i>

501
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:05,773
<i>Find the lessons
there to learn</i>

502
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:10,544
<i>And then dig deeper</i>

503
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:15,416
<i>Feed your intuition,
don't leave any stone unturned</i>

504
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:20,257
<i>Be the seeker of the truth</i>

505
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:25,595
<i>Listen when you hear it
calling you</i>

506
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,963
<i>You know it's calling you</i>

507
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:33,835
<i>Far beyond all reason
in your mind</i>

508
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:38,473
<i>There's a world mysterious,
there for you to find</i>

509
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:43,043
<i>All these questions
that we always have</i>

510
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:45,512
<i>All we are is curious</i>

511
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:47,581
<i>There's nothing
wrong with that</i>

512
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:52,454
<i>So go 'round every corner</i>

513
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:56,824
<i>Search every part of the sky</i>

514
00:23:56,826 --> 00:24:02,864
<i>'Cause a life
that's full of wonder</i>

515
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:05,069
<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

516
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:16,744
<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

517
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:21,448
<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

518
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,587
<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

519
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:30,361
Down there, Migo,
a world awaits.

520
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Okay, I'll go.

521
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:35,530
- Really?
- Do you have a plan?

522
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:37,432
Of course we have a plan.

523
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,768
I think the plan
might need more planning.

524
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,770
It was nice knowing you!

525
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,870
Hey, I need to readjust
the harness.

526
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,438
It's a little too tight.

527
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,140
- This should be enough rope.
- Should be?

528
00:24:46,142 --> 00:24:48,475
We don't know exactly
how far down it is.

529
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:50,145
It's also
all the rope we have.

530
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,945
Okay, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do it fast.

531
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:53,147
Gwangi, tell him the plan.

532
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:54,916
- Oh, boy.
- Listen up.

533
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:56,751
Pull once to go lower,
twice to stay put,

534
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,485
three times to come up.

535
00:24:58,487 --> 00:25:00,053
Four pulls means
you've reached the bottom

536
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:01,121
and it's safe for us
to come down.

537
00:25:01,123 --> 00:25:02,791
Wait, what was the second one?

538
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,958
Look, it doesn't really
matter.

539
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,662
Your safe word
is mystical creature.

540
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:09,731
That's more
of a phrase, really.

541
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,000
If you shout it, we'll abort the
mission and pull you right on up.

542
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:13,501
How about just help?

543
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:14,769
I'll scream, help!
Nice and short.

544
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:16,170
You're gonna do great.

545
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:18,071
Yeah? You really think so?

546
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,607
Let's do this!

547
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:24,878
Migo!

548
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,947
If you die, can I have
all your worldly possessions?

549
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:28,916
- Fleem!
- Right. Sorry, when you die.

550
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:32,686
What do you see?

551
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:35,924
So far just seeing cloud,
and more cloud.

552
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:37,492
Wait, wait,
what is that?

553
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,760
Oh, no!

554
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:40,128
Sorry,
that was just my hand.

555
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,195
Okay.

556
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:42,530
Still clouds.

557
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:43,731
More clouds.

558
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:44,799
Man, there's a lot
of clouds.

559
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:45,867
Meechee, you out here?

560
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:47,068
Thorp!

561
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,773
Why...

562
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,805
Mystical creature!

563
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:53,574
Hey, what are you freaks
doing out here?

564
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:55,143
Mystical creature!

565
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:56,610
What was that?

566
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,179
It's the wind!

567
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:01,683
Yeah, it makes
strange noises out here.

568
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,821
Mystical creature!

569
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:11,893
Stop it.
You're all acting weird.

570
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:14,932
I don't like weird.
Weird is weird, okay?

571
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:19,868
I thought I heard
Migo's high-pitched,

572
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,602
kind of annoying voice.
Where is he?

573
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:23,037
Hanging over the...

574
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,539
Honestly, we have no idea...

575
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,706
of the status
of his whereabouts.

576
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,108
How many times was up?

577
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,943
How many times?

578
00:26:28,945 --> 00:26:31,512
Something's not right here.
Let me think about this.

579
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:36,984
Something's not adding up.

580
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,887
Yeah, I can't do math.

581
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:39,889
You're coming with me.

582
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:43,657
Oh, no!

583
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,926
Definitely not enough rope!

584
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:13,791
Guys?

585
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:16,159
Guys?

586
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,260
Oh, boy.

587
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,907
This is so
not nothingness!

588
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:37,278
This is
definitely something-ness.

589
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:46,220
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

590
00:27:46,222 --> 00:27:47,224
Hi, little guy!

591
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:51,562
No!

592
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,096
That is just harsh!

593
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:56,697
I'll teach you
a little lesson.

594
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,232
Take that!

595
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,269
Yes!

596
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:03,674
Run, little one!
Run, run, be free!

597
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,610
Oh, the shiny flying thing!

598
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,961
A smallfoot.

599
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,202
No. No, no, no!

600
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:11,705
No! Rock! Rock!

601
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,918
No. No, no, no.

602
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:39,060
Okay, okay,
back up, back up.

603
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:42,230
You wanna interview a man
who says he saw a yeti?

604
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:43,531
And you actually believe him?

605
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,899
Of course not.
But it makes for good TV.

606
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:47,335
That man
has altitude sickness.

607
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:48,503
He needs help!

608
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:50,937
- After he helps us.
- What?

609
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:53,107
Brenda, do you know what
this village is famous for?

610
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:54,407
Yetis.

611
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:56,210
More reported
yeti sightings here

612
00:30:56,212 --> 00:30:58,079
than anywhere else
on the planet.

613
00:30:58,081 --> 00:30:59,513
So?

614
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:00,848
Picture this.

615
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,049
We're here looking

616
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:03,917
for the Himalayan
jumping spider...

617
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,820
but we capture on film a yeti.

618
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,089
We post the video,
it goes viral, then boom!

619
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:10,491
My ratings skyrocket!

620
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,326
Yetis don't exist.

621
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,529
Or do they?

622
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,030
Picked up a suit in town
this afternoon,

623
00:31:16,032 --> 00:31:17,197
and it's a cracker.

624
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:18,965
Has stilts and everything.

625
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,234
You're gonna put that thing on
and deceive your fans?

626
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:24,371
Of course not!
I'll be on camera.

627
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,907
You'll be in the suit.

628
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:28,975
What has happened to you?

629
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:31,412
Where is the Percy Patterson
who loved animals,

630
00:31:31,414 --> 00:31:35,483
who inspired me to love them,
who had integrity?

631
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:36,984
I have integrity.

632
00:31:38,554 --> 00:31:41,054
Okay, yes, I've gotta do
one thing without integrity

633
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,890
and then I'll just be
all integrity all the time.

634
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:45,259
I will ooze integrity.

635
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:46,894
I shall bathe in it.

636
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,862
I will have a sports drink
called Integrity

637
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:50,598
that I will endorse
not for free

638
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,067
but I will take that money
and give it to charity.

639
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,901
That's how much integrity

640
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:56,303
I will have!

641
00:31:56,305 --> 00:32:00,474
Brenda, please.
Nobody's watching my show.

642
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:03,410
You wanna save a species
on the verge of extinction?

643
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:05,346
Save me.

644
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,048
Brenda!

645
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,482
Yo, I'm really nervous.

646
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:09,550
This one goes out
to my girlfriend.

647
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,051
Brenda, wait.

648
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,320
Let me explain.

649
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:13,955
Lisa, will you marry...

650
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:15,522
<i>I thought I'd made it</i>

651
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:18,492
<i>Celebrated when
I got my TV show</i>

652
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:20,360
<i>But the haters
out there hating</i>

653
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:23,196
<i>Got my ratings low, low, low</i>

654
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:25,299
<i>It's hard to compete
with videos</i>

655
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:27,167
<i>Of twerking hogs</i>

656
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:28,636
<i>And waterskiing squirrels</i>

657
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:31,172
<i>And monkeys riding
on the backs of dogs</i>

658
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:33,073
<i>So much pressure</i>

659
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:36,143
<i>Have mercy, I'm not the Percy
that you've always heard about</i>

660
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:40,580
<i>That Percy, he was successful,
that Percy had a lot of clout</i>

661
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:43,650
<i>Back then, back when
I was high on that hill</i>

662
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:45,986
<i>But now I'm broke here
on the bottom</i>

663
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:48,555
<i>With no way to pay my bills</i>

664
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:52,525
<i>It's getting harder every day
to catch a break</i>

665
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:54,361
<i>So when I see a chance</i>

666
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,997
<i>Then it's a chance
I really need to take</i>

667
00:32:56,999 --> 00:33:00,667
<i>I'm just looking for a way
of bouncing back</i>

668
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:04,605
<i>The rent is due, I'm in a fix
and I'm about to crack</i>

669
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,273
<i>Under pressure</i>

670
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,676
Brenda? I'm making this up
on the spot.

671
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:10,310
<i>He's under pressure</i>

672
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:12,580
Which is impressive,
let's be honest.

673
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:14,282
Come on!

674
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,518
<i>Brenda, Brenda,
I'm a desperate man</i>

675
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,656
<i>So help me get back on the top
of rockin' again</i>

676
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:23,256
<i>No pressure</i>

677
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:26,260
<i>Brenda, Brenda,
won't you hear my plea?</i>

678
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:29,930
<i>The weight of all the world
is really weighing on me</i>

679
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:31,532
<i>So much pressure</i>

680
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:35,168
<i>This is no time to quit
I'm on the verge of a hit</i>

681
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:39,372
<i>And I'm determined to
make this a success</i>

682
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:43,444
<i>Brenda, tell me you see
all the potential in me</i>

683
00:33:43,446 --> 00:33:47,281
<i>I'll do whatever it takes
to make you say yes</i>

684
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:50,451
<i>Down on my knees,
begging you please</i>

685
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:53,087
<i>Won't you tell me
you understand?</i>

686
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:54,621
<i>Lend me a hand</i>

687
00:33:54,623 --> 00:34:00,529
<i>Oh, you gotta save me, save me,
save me, save me</i>

688
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:04,365
Those aren't even the words.

689
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,670
You think I don't know that?
Brenda?

690
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,136
Brenda?

691
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,072
Oh, no, no, no.
The bag! The suit!

692
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:12,540
No!

693
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:32,662
Hey, what you got there?

694
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:35,496
It's okay.

695
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,000
I must be close!

696
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:42,406
There it is!

697
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,710
I should introduce myself.
Oh, but why am I so scared?

698
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,715
No language skills.

699
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,986
Didn't see that one coming.

700
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:59,619
Excuse me...

701
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:01,087
Brenda,
please come back.

702
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:02,456
It's just this one time,

703
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,290
then we'll do the whole
integrity thing.

704
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,562
I promise. Please call me
when you get this!

705
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,206
Thank you, Brenda!

706
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:22,243
You've even put on the stilts.
Oh, I love it.

707
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,145
And the suit does not
look fake.

708
00:35:24,147 --> 00:35:26,147
It's actually
quite convincing.

709
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:28,114
Okay, here's the shot.
I'll film over...

710
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:37,491
He's doing all the talking.
Just say something, you idiot.

711
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:39,159
Here we go.

712
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:40,427
Hi.

713
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,695
I'm Migo and I have...

714
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,168
Blimey, good growl.

715
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,436
Did you put an amplifier
inside there or something?

716
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,737
This is why I work
with you, Brenda.

717
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:53,406
When you're in, you're all in.

718
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:55,342
Okay, hair looks good.

719
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:56,710
Nice bit of back light.

720
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:02,282
Here we go, yeti
discovery shot, take one.

721
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:04,317
Percy Patterson here,

722
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,453
high in the Himalayas.
I was looking for the rare...

723
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:09,556
Not yet. Thank you.
Cut that bit out.

724
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,125
In three, two...

725
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,426
I was looking

726
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:13,726
for the rare Himalayan
jumping spider...

727
00:36:13,728 --> 00:36:15,462
but I just heard
a low growling

728
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,531
coming from this direction.

729
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:21,368
Is that a yeti?

730
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,502
Do the growl.

731
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:25,105
Do you mind?

732
00:36:25,107 --> 00:36:26,607
Brenda,
will you turn that off?

733
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:29,446
I'm trying to shoot Brenda
in this... Wait a minute.

734
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,112
Brenda?

735
00:36:32,114 --> 00:36:33,116
Brenda?

736
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,686
It's a yeti!
It's a yeti! It's a yeti!

737
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,589
I can't seem to shout.

738
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:44,224
You know, you'll laugh,
because in my world

739
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:47,261
everyone thinks you're this
terrifying monster that's all.

740
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,132
But you don't look
terrifying to me.

741
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:53,299
You're adorable.

742
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:55,402
Ooh, the smallfoot song.

743
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:57,270
I know this one.
I know it. I know it.

744
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,507
Was that not right?

745
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,846
I just need
to take you home

746
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,581
and prove to everyone
that you exist

747
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,183
so I can get un-banished.
Okay?

748
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:15,389
You wanna bring anything?

749
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:16,523
Okay.

750
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,513
You wanna bring that, too?
Okay, come here.

751
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:28,302
Ooh, that looks cool!

752
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:29,639
No!

753
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,778
Wait! Where you going?
Look how excited you are.

754
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,321
Stop it!

755
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:49,326
That's ironic.

756
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,366
Smallfoot? Hello?

757
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:01,467
That supposed
to fall out like that?

758
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:02,869
We need to put that
back in there.

759
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:04,274
It goes there, right?

760
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:06,306
Oh, boy.

761
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:16,482
All right, take a little
bit of that...

762
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:19,552
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm taking you home.

763
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:21,422
I'm gonna be all like...
Yo, what's up?

764
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,424
And they're gonna be like...
Yo, is that a... What?

765
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,757
And I'm gonna be like...
Yeah!

766
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:25,960
Their faces are gonna
be like...

767
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:27,828
Then my face is like...

768
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,232
Smallfoot exists, suckas!

769
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,942
Is that a blizzard?

770
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:54,721
You okay?

771
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:56,956
Wow, that storm came out
of nowhere, didn't it?

772
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,324
Don't worry.
We'll wait it out in here.

773
00:38:58,326 --> 00:38:59,328
It's nice and warm.

774
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:02,596
No!

775
00:39:06,435 --> 00:39:08,335
Please don't die, please
don't die, please don't die.

776
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:09,837
Don't worry, smallfoot.
I'm gonna save you.

777
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,272
I'm gonna save you.
Just hang on!

778
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:12,754
Hang on! Hang on!

779
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,980
Fire.

780
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:20,014
So warm.

781
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:21,949
So nice...

782
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:23,951
Wait a minute. What's...

783
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,786
No, no, you can't...

784
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:28,288
How's that?

785
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,790
Nice and toasty
all the way around.

786
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,625
Oh, hey. What's wrong?

787
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:33,627
You hungry? I found your food.

788
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:34,694
Please...

789
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:37,965
You still cold?

790
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:40,067
I can see why.
You have, like, no fur.

791
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:42,636
Oh, your cocoon is almost dry.

792
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:45,798
I'll clear off a space where you can just
lie down until the storm passes, okay?

793
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:49,810
Percy Patterson here

794
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:51,645
in what might be
my last broadcast ever.

795
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:53,913
I might get eaten or roasted
or frozen solid

796
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:55,882
or some horrible combination
of the three.

797
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,016
But know this...

798
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:58,552
Know that I risked my life

799
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:00,386
in pursuit of something
extraordinary.

800
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:02,456
Something bigger than us.

801
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,525
Literally, so much bigger.

802
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,994
Oh, great! You're moving.
I've almost finished clearing off...

803
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:11,333
I think he's saying he wants
to have me for dinner.

804
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:21,844
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

805
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,511
Oh, what?

806
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:28,781
Come on,
you stupid frozen fingers!

807
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:31,784
There we go.

808
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,121
Brenda, give me my glory.

809
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:37,924

810
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:39,795
Please work, please work,
please work!

811
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:42,732
Yes!

812
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,433
No!

813
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,806
Something else is in here.

814
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:54,540
Judging by the echo...

815
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,613
I'd estimate distance
is approximately 200 meters.

816
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,813
Estimation wrong.

817
00:41:15,397 --> 00:41:18,465
My husband is back there
sound asleep!

818
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,500
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Not to mention the children!

819
00:41:20,502 --> 00:41:22,469
Took me weeks
to get them to sleep!

820
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:23,837
I don't even have kids,
but I can imagine

821
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,505
that that is just a really
hard thing to do.

822
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:27,540
All I get is six months
of a little mommy time...

823
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:28,942
and you are ruining it!

824
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:40,554
You just walk into my cave.
You don't even wipe your feet!

825
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:42,156
- Again, very, very sorry!
- You better be sorry.

826
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:44,458
I don't know what you are
or where you came from

827
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,159
but you better
learn some manners!

828
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,496
Did you see that? She was all,
you're gonna wake my husband.

829
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:51,764
And I was like,
you gotta get out of here.

830
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:52,965
And then you totally
understood me.

831
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:54,134
We were communicating.

832
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,404
This is amazing!

833
00:42:05,214 --> 00:42:06,813
Don't be stupid, Percy.

834
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,514
Do not go back to help
the big, ferocious yeti.

835
00:42:08,516 --> 00:42:10,583
Do not do it!

836
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:13,487
Although he did just
save you from a bear.

837
00:42:14,924 --> 00:42:17,694
This is the wrong time
to grow a conscience!

838
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,904
It's okay, big fella.

839
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:32,572
Let's get this thing off.

840
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:33,873
Does this hurt?

841
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,476
Sorry.
This? How about this?

842
00:42:35,478 --> 00:42:37,143
This? This? Sorry.

843
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:38,612
- Stop it!
- Got it.

844
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:41,047
Okay.
It's okay. I'm okay.

845
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:02,668
Oh, the storm's lifted!

846
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,003
What do you say me and you
get up that mountain

847
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:05,272
and prove you exist?

848
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:08,174
Oh, right. Hand signals.

849
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,688
This is unbelievable

850
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,958
but I think the yeti
is actually trying

851
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,728
to communicate with me.

852
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,931
And I think he wants me
to go with him.

853
00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:33,032
This is either the bravest
thing I've ever done

854
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:34,268
or the stupidest.

855
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,105
Here's hoping it's the former.

856
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:39,005
Oh, I almost forgot.

857
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,574
Here. These should
keep you warm.

858
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,174
No, no, no.

859
00:43:42,176 --> 00:43:44,580
That's actually
quite nice.

860
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:49,953
Yeah!

861
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,674
We're almost there.

862
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:26,152
Up and at 'em, Migo.
Time to ring the gong!

863
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:28,956
Why is this
so hard this morning?

864
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:33,927
Launch!

865
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:35,127
Migo?

866
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:36,932
Migo, time to ring the...

867
00:44:37,866 --> 00:44:40,303
Oh, yeah. Banished.

868
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:00,122
What the...

869
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:11,697
Two gongs?

870
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:14,034
What just happened?

871
00:45:14,036 --> 00:45:16,069
Don't ask. Just push it down.

872
00:45:16,071 --> 00:45:17,806
Push it down.

873
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,010
My helmet?

874
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,181
Drop me! Quickly,
before I change my mind.

875
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,650
You can't
do this, Meech!

876
00:45:29,652 --> 00:45:30,884
You're our leader!

877
00:45:30,886 --> 00:45:32,719
Exactly why I should do it!

878
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:33,853
Drop me!

879
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:35,389
Okay.

880
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:37,891
This is terrifying. I cannot
believe Migo did this.

881
00:45:37,893 --> 00:45:40,860
Which is why maybe, you know,
you shouldn't!

882
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:42,962
I just wanna say,
I'm fine with it being you.

883
00:45:42,964 --> 00:45:44,297
I should go.

884
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:45,831
I'm strongest
and I've trained myself

885
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,366
to sleep with my eyes open.

886
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:50,170
I'm asleep right now.
You're all part of my dream.

887
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:52,304
He's down there
because I convinced him to go!

888
00:45:52,306 --> 00:45:53,906
And he might be lost or hurt.

889
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:55,342
- Or dead.
- Fleem!

890
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:57,244
Oh, what? Now we're not
about the truth?

891
00:45:57,246 --> 00:45:59,246
Last time, we dropped
him because Thorp showed up

892
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:01,114
which he might do again,
so can we please go?

893
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:02,882
Guys! Guys!

894
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:04,183
Oh, I can still hear
his voice in my head.

895
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:05,686
- Guys!
- It's in my head too.

896
00:46:05,688 --> 00:46:06,886
Hey!

897
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:08,087
Migo! He's here!

898
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:10,023
I know. And he always will be.

899
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:12,759
No, no, no. He's here!
As in, over there!

900
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,027
Guys!

901
00:46:14,029 --> 00:46:15,395
- Migo!
- Migo!

902
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,697
Mystical creature!

903
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:18,931
Oh, no!

904
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:21,234
I've got you!

905
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,969
Migo!

906
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:25,072
I am so relieved!

907
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,440
- Oh, hi!
- Hey!

908
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:28,375
- Hi.
- Hi.

909
00:46:28,377 --> 00:46:31,110
- See? I told you he was alive!
- My brother!

910
00:46:31,112 --> 00:46:32,712
Oh, Migo! Oh, Migo.

911
00:46:32,714 --> 00:46:35,081
Guys, easy. Easy, easy.

912
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:38,884
What is that?

913
00:46:38,886 --> 00:46:42,225
Smallfoot Evidentiary Society,
meet your mystical creature!

914
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,971
I knew it was real.

915
00:46:57,973 --> 00:47:00,005
No one's gonna think
I'm crazy anymore.

916
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:01,474
He's so beautiful!

917
00:47:01,476 --> 00:47:04,311
And so short.

918
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:06,880
You did it, Migo.
You actually did it!

919
00:47:06,882 --> 00:47:09,348
No, we did it. The S.E.S.!

920
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,418
Four more Sasquatch.

921
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,286
It's a whole Sasquad.

922
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,991
Fear me, little creature.
I am your god!

923
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:20,927
- Fleem, what are you doing?
- Establishing dominance.

924
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:22,429
No.

925
00:47:22,431 --> 00:47:25,498
We don't dominate.
We welcome him with open arms.

926
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,266
Oh, did I just do that?

927
00:47:27,268 --> 00:47:29,069
I am so sorry!

928
00:47:29,071 --> 00:47:30,369
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

929
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:32,538
I'm so sorry. I love you.
I love you.

930
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,241
We gotta bring this truth
to the village,

931
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:36,009
blow some tiny minds.

932
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:37,978
What was that?

933
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,212
Their minds are really tiny.

934
00:47:39,214 --> 00:47:40,880
Gwangi's right.

935
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:42,317
Let's wake them up.

936
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,989
What? Migo's back?

937
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,460
Yeah, that's right.
In your face!

938
00:47:53,462 --> 00:47:54,860
My face!

939
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:56,163
Hey, listen! Everyone!

940
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,898
Stop what you're doing
and follow us!

941
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,098
'Cause this is gonna be
the best part of your day!

942
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,833
You heard Migo.
Everybody.

943
00:48:00,835 --> 00:48:02,268
- That's right!
- Migo?

944
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,335
Hey, you up there!
Come on down!

945
00:48:03,337 --> 00:48:04,471
Come on, kids.

946
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:06,005
You too, Garry.
Get over here.

947
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:07,007
Let's go!
You're gonna love it!

948
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,440
Hey, Migo, welcome back...

949
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:10,844
Hold on, aren't you supposed
to be banished?

950
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,344
- Yep.
- Ah, cool.

951
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:13,913
Everyone, listen up.
Gather 'round.

952
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:16,081
I promise, you're gonna
wanna see this.

953
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,317
My fellow yetis,

954
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,853
there are moments in life

955
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,987
that are imbued
with such importance.

956
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:24,523
We must pause
and look deeper

957
00:48:24,525 --> 00:48:27,092
into the moment
of the place in which we are.

958
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:30,429
To hold such
beauteous gravitas

959
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:32,165
and take in the beauty...

960
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:33,500
- I'm losing interest!
- Get to the point!

961
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:35,235
Yep, okay. Here we go.

962
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:39,339
Fellow yetis,
behold, the smallfoot!

963
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,520
I can't believe my eyes.

964
00:48:53,522 --> 00:48:56,590
These aren't primitive beasts
living in caves.

965
00:48:56,592 --> 00:48:59,926
This is a complex
civilization.

966
00:48:59,928 --> 00:49:02,061
Do you know what this means
for the world?

967
00:49:02,063 --> 00:49:05,197
A Percy Patterson
network special.

968
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,868
You're welcome, world!

969
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:11,605
So...

970
00:49:13,174 --> 00:49:15,641
What's all the excitement
about this time?

971
00:49:15,643 --> 00:49:17,543
Migo found a smallfoot!

972
00:49:17,545 --> 00:49:19,078
That's one guess.

973
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,882
But, Dad,
look at the small foot!

974
00:49:23,118 --> 00:49:25,418
Don't yaks have small feet?

975
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,119
Let me take it
into the palace,

976
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:28,420
consult the stones

977
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:30,023
and determine what it is.

978
00:49:30,025 --> 00:49:31,625
What if
it is a smallfoot?

979
00:49:31,627 --> 00:49:33,360
Does that mean
a stone is wrong?

980
00:49:33,362 --> 00:49:34,927
They're all wrong.

981
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:36,061
Yeah.

982
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,665
Garry, just breathe.

983
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:41,400
Everyone, please.

984
00:49:41,402 --> 00:49:44,136
What do the stones
tell us about questions?

985
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:59,455
I have so many questions!

986
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:02,355
- Where is it from?
- Why is it pink?

987
00:50:02,357 --> 00:50:04,123
- How did you get it here?
- What does it eat?

988
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:06,159
How does it think
with such a tiny little brain?

989
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:09,561
Honestly, I have just as many
questions as you do.

990
00:50:09,563 --> 00:50:11,163
- Where is its horn?
- Is that its ear?

991
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:12,465
Does it want a bite of fruit?

992
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,199
How is it here if a stone
says it can't be?

993
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:18,471
<i>It's all much bigger
than we know</i>

994
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,672
- How?
- Why?

995
00:50:19,674 --> 00:50:21,273
What do you mean?

996
00:50:21,275 --> 00:50:23,176
<i>It's only just beginning
to unfold</i>

997
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:24,978
- I'm so confused.
- There's more to know?

998
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,346
<i>So let it all unfold</i>

999
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:29,516
<i>I never knew
there was more to know</i>

1000
00:50:29,518 --> 00:50:31,650
<i>Isn't it all so amazing?</i>

1001
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:36,121
<i>There's a world mysterious,
there for you to find</i>

1002
00:50:36,123 --> 00:50:38,324
<i>Out of the blue,
there was room to grow</i>

1003
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,427
<i>Isn't it all kind of crazy?</i>

1004
00:50:40,429 --> 00:50:42,395
<i>All we are is curious</i>

1005
00:50:42,397 --> 00:50:44,531
<i>There's nothing wrong
with that</i>

1006
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:47,734
<i>So go 'round every corner</i>

1007
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:49,101
You call that art?

1008
00:50:49,103 --> 00:50:51,603
<i>Search every part of the sky</i>

1009
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:53,239
- What is he doing?
- Is he really gonna fly?

1010
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:57,313
<i>'Cause a life
that's full of wonder</i>

1011
00:50:58,612 --> 00:51:01,183
<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

1012
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,047
- Blossom, sit.
- I got you.

1013
00:51:35,049 --> 00:51:36,516
Down. Down!

1014
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:45,224
Do you see
what you've started?

1015
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:46,525
Yes! Do you?

1016
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:48,127
Look at them!

1017
00:51:48,129 --> 00:51:50,195
We have been living in fear
for too long, Dad.

1018
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:53,232
All I ever wanted to do
was keep you safe, Meechee.

1019
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:57,103
Everything I do, I do to
protect the village. And you.

1020
00:51:57,105 --> 00:51:58,737
I don't need you
to protect me,

1021
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:00,440
I need you to listen to me.

1022
00:52:00,442 --> 00:52:01,741
To all of us!

1023
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,509
Especially Migo!

1024
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:05,744
Dad, he went below the clouds.

1025
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:09,114
They're talking to Migo because they
have questions and he's listening,

1026
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:11,351
instead of telling them
to just push them down.

1027
00:52:11,353 --> 00:52:13,085
But, believe me,
you are their leader,

1028
00:52:13,087 --> 00:52:15,121
and they wish it was you.

1029
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:17,656
So, just talk to Migo
about what he saw.

1030
00:52:17,658 --> 00:52:19,726
Please.

1031
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:23,328
You're right. That's exactly
what I need to do.

1032
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:27,433
Oh, thank you!
I knew you'd come around.

1033
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,335
I'm gonna go get
the smallfoot! Bye!

1034
00:52:30,337 --> 00:52:33,172
That's a snood.
It's like a sort of scarf.

1035
00:52:33,174 --> 00:52:35,741
That's a fiber supplement.
I'd rather not go into it.

1036
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:37,342
That's a sock.

1037
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:39,411
It's a lining between
your shoe and your foot.

1038
00:52:39,413 --> 00:52:41,514
That's not how
you're supposed...

1039
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:43,616
Four days I had them on.

1040
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,786
Can you translate the Scroll
of Invisible Wisdom?

1041
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:51,558
Yes. Actually, I do need this.

1042
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,594
Okay.

1043
00:52:55,163 --> 00:52:56,563
It is not wisdom

1044
00:52:56,565 --> 00:52:58,531
and definitely not invisible.

1045
00:52:58,533 --> 00:53:00,666
Hey, where's Migo?

1046
00:53:00,668 --> 00:53:03,168
Hey, Dad! Dad!

1047
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,341
Oh, is this the best day ever
or what?

1048
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:07,107
Dad?

1049
00:53:08,877 --> 00:53:10,710
What's wrong?
What happened to your helmet?

1050
00:53:10,712 --> 00:53:12,344
I missed the gong.

1051
00:53:12,346 --> 00:53:16,648
But the sky snail,
it came up anyway.

1052
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,152
So another stone is wrong.

1053
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:22,355
- This is amazing.
- Amazing?

1054
00:53:22,357 --> 00:53:24,357
What's so amazing about it?

1055
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,560
The stones are supposed
to be stones, you know?

1056
00:53:27,562 --> 00:53:30,730
Sturdy, reliable, true.

1057
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:33,433
And now the snail
is just rising on its own?

1058
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:35,134
If it even is a snail.

1059
00:53:35,136 --> 00:53:36,902
Meechee thinks it might be
a flaming ball of gas.

1060
00:53:36,904 --> 00:53:38,404
Gas?

1061
00:53:38,406 --> 00:53:39,839
I've been banging my head
on that thing

1062
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,741
to wake up a gas ball?

1063
00:53:41,743 --> 00:53:44,511
That's usually
what wakes me up.

1064
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,545
Look, Dad, I know
all of this change is scary.

1065
00:53:46,547 --> 00:53:48,614
But maybe
this is a good thing.

1066
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,449
Maybe there's something
even better

1067
00:53:50,451 --> 00:53:52,685
than banging your head
against the gong.

1068
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,389
But if I don't ring the gong,
I'm not the gong ringer.

1069
00:53:56,391 --> 00:53:58,891
And if I'm not
the gong ringer

1070
00:53:58,893 --> 00:54:00,662
then what am I?

1071
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:06,535
Hey, Migo!

1072
00:54:08,236 --> 00:54:10,302
My dad wants to see you.

1073
00:54:10,304 --> 00:54:11,871
The Stonekeeper. Really?

1074
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,473
Which must be nice for you,

1075
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:15,607
'cause he never wants
to see me.

1076
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:17,277
Okay.

1077
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:19,411
Why did I shout that out?
That's so embarrassing.

1078
00:54:19,413 --> 00:54:20,850
Blew it again, Thorp.

1079
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,819
Hey, Dad. I'll be back.

1080
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,455
Dad?

1081
00:54:41,803 --> 00:54:43,703
Look at them.

1082
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:45,808
The great Stonekeepers
of the past.

1083
00:54:47,342 --> 00:54:49,241
Each one adding new stones

1084
00:54:49,243 --> 00:54:51,913
as they received wisdom about
what was best for the village.

1085
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,449
- Robe looks heavy.
- It is.

1086
00:54:56,451 --> 00:54:59,355
It requires a strong backbone.

1087
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:23,245
Secret stairs. Okay.

1088
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:36,389
Where are you taking me?

1089
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:38,861
So many questions.

1090
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:43,565
Think it's about time
I give you some answers.

1091
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,340
What is this?

1092
00:55:54,342 --> 00:55:56,041
You see, Migo...

1093
00:55:56,043 --> 00:55:57,643
<i>There was a time</i>

1094
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,045
<i>When yetis lived
beneath the clouds</i>

1095
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:00,746
<i>We were alive
and we were thrivin'</i>

1096
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,982
<i>Till we came across a crowd
of smallfoot</i>

1097
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,485
<i>That's right, we used to live
down there</i>

1098
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,819
<i>But there were actions</i>

1099
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,621
<i>We could not forgive
down there</i>

1100
00:56:08,623 --> 00:56:11,556
<i>And though they used
a different nomenclature</i>

1101
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:14,793
<i>Man or human,
they showed us human nature</i>

1102
00:56:14,795 --> 00:56:16,362
<i>A dangerous species</i>

1103
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:17,797
<i>Though we approached
with wonder</i>

1104
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:19,431
<i>They attacked
with their spears</i>

1105
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,366
<i>And their smoking
sticks of thunder</i>

1106
00:56:21,368 --> 00:56:24,304
<i>They called us Sasquatch,
they called us abominable</i>

1107
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:27,440
<i>They chased us, pursued us,
their persistence indomitable</i>

1108
00:56:27,442 --> 00:56:30,409
<i>We had no choice
but to run and hide</i>

1109
00:56:30,411 --> 00:56:33,612
<i>Otherwise, we surmised
we were facing genocide</i>

1110
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:35,982
<i>So we climbed this mountain
just to stay alive</i>

1111
00:56:35,984 --> 00:56:39,886
<i>You see, we knew that up here
smallfoot could not survive</i>

1112
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:42,554
<i>So it was here the first law
was written in stone</i>

1113
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:45,924
<i>It was named and proclaimed
as a truth to be known</i>

1114
00:56:45,926 --> 00:56:47,994
<i>Our world is an island</i>

1115
00:56:47,996 --> 00:56:50,496
<i>That floats on a sea
of endless clouds</i>

1116
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:52,098
<i>That's how it would be</i>

1117
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,067
<i>And then we wrote more laws,
more rules to obey</i>

1118
00:56:55,069 --> 00:56:57,869
<i>For the sake of us all,
it was the only way</i>

1119
00:56:57,871 --> 00:57:01,641
<i>To protect us from all
of the human ravages</i>

1120
00:57:01,643 --> 00:57:05,110
<i>Heaped upon us
by those human savages</i>

1121
00:57:05,112 --> 00:57:07,980
<i>Now you know, now you know,
now you know</i>

1122
00:57:07,982 --> 00:57:09,681
<i>Now you know, now you know</i>

1123
00:57:09,683 --> 00:57:11,516
<i>And new rules apply</i>

1124
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:14,420
<i>Now you know, now you know,
now you know</i>

1125
00:57:14,422 --> 00:57:15,688
<i>That it's best just</i>

1126
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,656
<i>To let it lie, let it lie</i>

1127
00:57:17,658 --> 00:57:20,493
<i>Now you know, now you know,
now you know</i>

1128
00:57:20,495 --> 00:57:22,395
<i>Now you know, now you know</i>

1129
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,929
<i>And you can't deny</i>

1130
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:26,998
<i>Now you know, now you know,
now you know</i>

1131
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,436
<i>That it's best just
to let it lie, let it lie</i>

1132
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:33,672
But my smallfoot,
he's not like that.

1133
00:57:33,674 --> 00:57:35,407
They're all like that.

1134
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:36,808
Tell me, when you found him,

1135
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,643
did he greet you
with open arms?

1136
00:57:46,388 --> 00:57:47,853
They don't care about us.

1137
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:50,156
They don't care about anything
but themselves.

1138
00:57:50,158 --> 00:57:52,824
Which is why
we must do the same.

1139
00:57:52,826 --> 00:57:54,996
If we care about our future.

1140
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:27,627
We're below the clouds.

1141
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,795
Or so it would seem,
but look closer.

1142
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,632
Those aren't clouds!
It's steam.

1143
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,034
The stones are working.

1144
00:58:35,036 --> 00:58:37,737
The stones?

1145
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:39,806
<i>Every job and every task</i>

1146
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,607
<i>As pointless as it seems</i>

1147
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:44,643
<i>All of it ensures
that this important machine</i>

1148
00:58:44,645 --> 00:58:46,913
<i>Keeps churning and turning
and spinning around</i>

1149
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:48,181
<i>So those below don't look up</i>

1150
00:58:48,183 --> 00:58:50,049
<i>And those above
don't look down</i>

1151
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:51,817
<i>And they'll look</i>

1152
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,686
<i>'Cause even if they hear
of these atrocities</i>

1153
00:58:53,688 --> 00:58:55,688
<i>The only thing
stronger than fear</i>

1154
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,590
<i>Is curiosity</i>

1155
00:58:57,592 --> 00:58:59,692
<i>Now you know, now you know,
now you know</i>

1156
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:02,828
Wait, so none of those stones
are true? They're all lies?

1157
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,029
<i>Let it lie</i>

1158
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:06,531
Good lies.
To protect our world.

1159
00:59:06,533 --> 00:59:08,034
But they need
to know the truth.

1160
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:09,902
Oh, do they?

1161
00:59:09,904 --> 00:59:11,503
<i>You feel emboldened
by your noble quest</i>

1162
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:13,072
<i>To find the truth</i>

1163
00:59:13,074 --> 00:59:15,741
<i>I chalk it up to the naive
innocence of youth</i>

1164
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:17,710
<i>So let me share a secret
that you'll learn</i>

1165
00:59:17,712 --> 00:59:19,578
<i>As you grow older</i>

1166
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,047
<i>What's true or not true
is in the eye of the beholder</i>

1167
00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:24,549
<i>So do you wanna prevent
our own annihilation?</i>

1168
00:59:24,551 --> 00:59:25,650
Yes!

1169
00:59:25,652 --> 00:59:27,052
<i>Then our only goal should be</i>

1170
00:59:27,054 --> 00:59:28,621
<i>To control the flow
of information</i>

1171
00:59:28,623 --> 00:59:29,788
<i>Unless you want
to see the smallfoot</i>

1172
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:30,857
<i>Conquer and pillage</i>

1173
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,692
No!

1174
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,994
<i>Then protect the lie
and you protect the village</i>

1175
00:59:35,996 --> 00:59:37,996
Lives are at stake, Migo.

1176
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:41,199
Your friends, your father,
Meechee.

1177
00:59:41,201 --> 00:59:44,036
Okay. I want to know
everything there is to know

1178
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,038
about you and your world.

1179
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,873
She's curious.

1180
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:51,543
And you know what they say.
Curiosity killed the yak.

1181
00:59:51,545 --> 00:59:53,279
So what do you want me to do?

1182
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:56,181
Tell everyone you were lying
about the smallfoot.

1183
00:59:56,183 --> 00:59:58,150
But they've already seen it.

1184
00:59:58,152 --> 01:00:00,219
They're not gonna believe me.

1185
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,623
You'd be surprised
at what they'll believe.

1186
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:05,991
You think knowledge
is power, Migo?

1187
01:00:05,993 --> 01:00:08,927
<i>Now you know, now you know,
now you know</i>

1188
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:10,630
<i>Now you know, now you know</i>

1189
01:00:10,632 --> 01:00:12,531
Question is...

1190
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:15,634
<i>Now you know, now you know,
now you know</i>

1191
01:00:15,636 --> 01:00:18,703
What are you gonna do
with that power?

1192
01:00:23,678 --> 01:00:25,311
Okay. It's a little fuzzy,

1193
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:27,279
but I think I'm starting
to get it.

1194
01:00:27,281 --> 01:00:29,648
Your job is to tell stories
that fly through the air

1195
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,183
in a series of pictures
in rapid succession

1196
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:33,105
that magically appear
in other smallfoots' homes.

1197
01:00:33,955 --> 01:00:35,221
TV. Right!

1198
01:00:35,223 --> 01:00:37,156
And what is this thing here?

1199
01:00:37,158 --> 01:00:39,692
That's the roof of my home.

1200
01:00:39,694 --> 01:00:40,960
- Home.
- Home?

1201
01:00:42,864 --> 01:00:44,297
Are we saying the same thing?

1202
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,632
Oh, is that, like,
your best friend?

1203
01:00:47,634 --> 01:00:49,869
That is evil banker man.

1204
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:51,703
He wants to take
my home away

1205
01:00:51,705 --> 01:00:54,639
because of something called
a variable interest rate.

1206
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,277
Apparently, I don't know what
it means either.

1207
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:01,813
The air is really
thin up here, isn't it?

1208
01:01:03,217 --> 01:01:04,916
Those are animals.

1209
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:11,891
Cheeky.

1210
01:01:11,893 --> 01:01:14,659
Anyway, the point is, this
is why I do what I do, see?

1211
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:18,264
I was fascinated
with other species, like you.

1212
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:22,868
Actually, nothing like you.
You're quite extraordinary.

1213
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,603
But lately,
I started to only care

1214
01:01:24,605 --> 01:01:26,839
about how many people
are watching.

1215
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:28,009
How popular I am.

1216
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:32,143
Hearing myself
say this out loud...

1217
01:01:32,145 --> 01:01:35,081
What's the yeti word
for pathetic?

1218
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:38,016
When I was nine,
I saw my first lion.

1219
01:01:38,018 --> 01:01:40,252
It looked like this, see?

1220
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,924
It looked nothing like this.
That looks like a fat poodle.

1221
01:01:45,926 --> 01:01:47,326
Here, I'll just show you.

1222
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:53,965
Okay. What is that thing?

1223
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:55,368
They don't care about us.

1224
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,036
Lives are at stake, Migo.

1225
01:01:57,038 --> 01:01:59,105
They don't care about anything
but themselves.

1226
01:01:59,107 --> 01:02:00,940
Good lies.

1227
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:02,842
Which is why we must do
the same. Protect our world.

1228
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,645
Your friends, your father,
Meechee.

1229
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:07,246
No, don't do that.

1230
01:02:07,248 --> 01:02:08,313
What are you doing?
You're ruining it!

1231
01:02:08,315 --> 01:02:09,982
Stop! Stop it!

1232
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:11,650
Red one up! Up, up!
Now, over to the blue one.

1233
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:13,018
Blue one. Three in a row! Yes!

1234
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,719
- Meechee?
- Not now, Migo.

1235
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:16,855
Okay, down, down.
Right side. Purple thingy.

1236
01:02:16,857 --> 01:02:18,123
Slide it, slide it.

1237
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,092
There we go! Boom!

1238
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:23,762
Migo, I'm putting shapes
next to other shapes

1239
01:02:23,764 --> 01:02:25,130
to make the rows disappear.

1240
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:26,898
It's pointless
and a total waste of time,

1241
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,335
but I can't stop.

1242
01:02:29,337 --> 01:02:31,936
There goes our high score.

1243
01:02:31,938 --> 01:02:33,438
Smallfoot?

1244
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,040
Hey, are you okay?

1245
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:39,145
Getting a little woozy.

1246
01:02:39,147 --> 01:02:42,882
I'm going to need
some more oxygen. Oxygen.

1247
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,250
I can't remember my own name.

1248
01:02:45,786 --> 01:02:47,453
What's all this?

1249
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:49,688
Oh, we learned
how to communicate!

1250
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:50,755
That's his world...

1251
01:02:50,757 --> 01:02:52,123
and I think it's really big

1252
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,458
and there are more smallfeet
down there.

1253
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,996
Like, a lot more.

1254
01:02:56,998 --> 01:02:59,699
Migo, I think
something's wrong.

1255
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,166
He doesn't look so good.

1256
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:03,168
He's cold
and his breathing is off.

1257
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,837
You see,
we knew that up here,

1258
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:07,440
smallfoot could not survive.

1259
01:03:07,442 --> 01:03:09,107
I think we need
to take him home.

1260
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:10,909
What? No!

1261
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:12,344
No? Why not?

1262
01:03:12,346 --> 01:03:14,212
What if he's really sick?
What if he needs help?

1263
01:03:14,214 --> 01:03:15,947
Just stop asking questions!

1264
01:03:15,949 --> 01:03:17,750
Stop asking questions?

1265
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:22,387
Attention, everyone!

1266
01:03:22,389 --> 01:03:24,259
The Stonekeeper
has an announcement.

1267
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:26,859
What's going on? Do you know?

1268
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:28,127
'Cause you look
like you know something.

1269
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:30,328
Just stop. Please.

1270
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,996
Well, well, well,

1271
01:03:31,998 --> 01:03:33,833
what an interesting day
it's been.

1272
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:37,203
A day full of excitement
and questions.

1273
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:39,804
So many questions.

1274
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:41,773
I must admit,
the events of the day

1275
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:43,442
even had me asking a few.

1276
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,311
I smell cover-up.

1277
01:03:45,313 --> 01:03:47,179
So I asked Migo to join me

1278
01:03:47,181 --> 01:03:50,516
so I could question him
about his amazing discovery.

1279
01:03:50,518 --> 01:03:53,418
And together, we've reached
the same conclusion.

1280
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,221
Migo, tell them
what we learned.

1281
01:03:55,223 --> 01:03:56,288
Yeah.

1282
01:03:59,793 --> 01:04:03,295
The thing is, see...

1283
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,929
Yeah, it's...

1284
01:04:04,931 --> 01:04:08,236
What I was gonna
tell you is...

1285
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,507
It's not a smallfoot.

1286
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,810
Wait. What?

1287
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,246
Yeah. I was wrong,
I got confused,

1288
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:21,980
and the Stonekeeper
figured it out.

1289
01:04:21,982 --> 01:04:23,382
It's actually a type of yak.

1290
01:04:23,384 --> 01:04:25,049
A yak?

1291
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:26,786
Migo found a rare breed that

1292
01:04:26,788 --> 01:04:28,887
- even I didn't know about.
- No...

1293
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:31,422
A red-coated
pygmy hairless yak.

1294
01:04:31,424 --> 01:04:33,491
You know this is not a yak.

1295
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:36,427
As you can see,
its existence is confirmed

1296
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:37,866
in stone.

1297
01:04:41,368 --> 01:04:43,002
What is happening?

1298
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,471
The stones have protected us
for generations.

1299
01:04:45,473 --> 01:04:47,139
But we've been ignoring them.

1300
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:48,406
No one's been feeding

1301
01:04:48,408 --> 01:04:49,909
the great
mountain mammoths today.

1302
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:51,210
He's right.

1303
01:04:51,212 --> 01:04:53,279
And because of that,
we are sinking.

1304
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:54,913
I don't wanna sink!

1305
01:04:54,915 --> 01:04:57,382
Garry, you're right
to be afraid.

1306
01:04:57,384 --> 01:04:58,918
Everyone,
listen to Garry.

1307
01:05:00,154 --> 01:05:01,252
I don't wanna sink
into the nothing!

1308
01:05:01,254 --> 01:05:02,453
These are lies, Migo.

1309
01:05:02,455 --> 01:05:04,089
We saw you
go below the clouds.

1310
01:05:04,091 --> 01:05:06,458
I didn't.
I fell into the clouds

1311
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,226
and I found him
inside of a cave.

1312
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:09,360
What?

1313
01:05:09,362 --> 01:05:10,929
Don't listen to him.

1314
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:12,398
This is all part of
a massive cover-up!

1315
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,565
Please, just...

1316
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:14,567
We're all part of
a big machine.

1317
01:05:14,569 --> 01:05:16,168
Dude, no. Come on, stop!

1318
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,436
In fact, I think it might be
a big machine

1319
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:19,170
- that's down there!
- You need to stop!

1320
01:05:19,172 --> 01:05:20,339
- It does sound like a machine!
- I thought so too!

1321
01:05:20,341 --> 01:05:21,421
- You heard me!
- Just stop!

1322
01:05:23,043 --> 01:05:25,578
A big machine.

1323
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,378
Right!

1324
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,415
Let's all listen to Gwangi
and his whacked-out theories

1325
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:31,516
because we all know
that Gwangi is

1326
01:05:31,518 --> 01:05:33,418
just straight-up crazy.

1327
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,320
- What?
- Don't call him crazy.

1328
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:37,022
Come on, are we really
gonna listen to these guys?

1329
01:05:37,024 --> 01:05:38,156
They're the village weirdos,
right?

1330
01:05:38,158 --> 01:05:39,891
We all know that.

1331
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:41,960
They're just trying to prove
all the stones wrong.

1332
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:43,628
But if we don't follow
the stones,

1333
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,065
really bad things can happen.

1334
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,201
Well said, Migo.
That's the truth.

1335
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:51,904
The truth?

1336
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,810
I don't think anybody around
here cares what that is.

1337
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:58,610
Guys, wait.

1338
01:05:58,612 --> 01:06:00,511
Migo, give him to me.

1339
01:06:00,513 --> 01:06:01,647
Wait,
what are you doing?

1340
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:05,049
No, no, no! He need warmth
and he can't breathe!

1341
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:06,185
Meechee.

1342
01:06:06,187 --> 01:06:07,920
Why are you doing this?

1343
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,159
This is something
we should discuss inside.

1344
01:06:12,326 --> 01:06:13,495
Inside.

1345
01:06:16,596 --> 01:06:18,464
Yes, Father.

1346
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:20,465
Meechee, we need to talk.

1347
01:06:20,467 --> 01:06:22,571
I think you've said enough.

1348
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:25,503
Okay, everyone.

1349
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:28,206
Now everything can go back
to the way it was.

1350
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:31,944
Everyone, back to work.
The village won't run itself.

1351
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,413
The smallfoot, what are you
gonna do with him?

1352
01:06:34,415 --> 01:06:37,415
We're taking him back to
the cave where you found him.

1353
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:39,485
But I didn't find him
in a cave.

1354
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:43,087
But you said you did,
so they believe you.

1355
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:44,592
You've done a good thing,
Migo.

1356
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:00,507
Stonekeeper, wait!

1357
01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:03,111
No!

1358
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:06,947
You've done your job, Migo.

1359
01:07:07,614 --> 01:07:09,417
Go home.

1360
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:52,357
Migo?

1361
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,027
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

1362
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,332
I was just thinking
about Stone 15.

1363
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,565
Ignorance is bliss?

1364
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:03,268
Yeah. That one's true.

1365
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:05,371
Ignorance is bliss.

1366
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,473
Or at least it was.

1367
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:09,007
I was pretty happy

1368
01:08:09,009 --> 01:08:11,043
when I didn't know
about the smallfoot.

1369
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,444
Or the S.E.S.

1370
01:08:12,446 --> 01:08:15,714
Or how amazing
Meechee really is.

1371
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,315
And I'm pretty sure
I'd be happier

1372
01:08:17,317 --> 01:08:19,250
not knowing that they hate me.

1373
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:23,023
Or that I lied
and betrayed them all.

1374
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,628
I miss being ignorant.

1375
01:08:28,162 --> 01:08:29,794
So let's just, you know,

1376
01:08:29,796 --> 01:08:31,663
go back to the way
things were.

1377
01:08:31,665 --> 01:08:34,066
With one change.

1378
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,735
I'll be the gong ringer
from now on.

1379
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:38,771
Maybe banging my head
into that thing

1380
01:08:38,773 --> 01:08:41,373
will make all of these
feelings go away.

1381
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:43,307
Oh, yeah.
You'll pretty much go numb.

1382
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:44,575
You won't feel a thing.

1383
01:08:44,577 --> 01:08:47,982
Good. Because I feel like
such a jerk.

1384
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:54,786
Okay.

1385
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:57,088
Now, you remember
the advice I gave you, right?

1386
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,757
First, check the wind.

1387
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,659
Pretty easy
to get blown off course.

1388
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:02,998
Wind, check.

1389
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:06,164
And you gotta true your aim.

1390
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:08,801
You'll never succeed
if your aim isn't true.

1391
01:09:08,803 --> 01:09:10,768
Aim, check.

1392
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,337
And don't forget,

1393
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:14,639
even though you know
it's gonna hurt,

1394
01:09:14,641 --> 01:09:16,678
you gotta hit it head-on.

1395
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,749
He's in there.

1396
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:26,185
She's in there.

1397
01:09:26,187 --> 01:09:27,255
But...

1398
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:32,191
You already woke
the village, son.

1399
01:09:32,193 --> 01:09:34,362
Now, go make sure
they stay awake.

1400
01:09:36,764 --> 01:09:38,297
I love you, Dad.

1401
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,298
I love you too, son.

1402
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,535
Now, say the word.

1403
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,305
Launch!

1404
01:09:56,382 --> 01:09:58,153
Meechee, I am so sor...

1405
01:10:00,587 --> 01:10:02,120
Oh, no.

1406
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:03,621
Meechee?

1407
01:10:03,623 --> 01:10:05,393
What are you doing here?

1408
01:10:15,803 --> 01:10:16,869
Meechee.

1409
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:18,105
Where's the smallfoot?

1410
01:10:21,274 --> 01:10:24,446
Hold on, little guy, okay?
You're almost home.

1411
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,420
Yeah, so Meechee
took the smallfoot.

1412
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:39,857
And convinced me
I have a lot of anger issues

1413
01:10:39,859 --> 01:10:42,861
because of something
called a father complex.

1414
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,295
I don't know, something about

1415
01:10:44,297 --> 01:10:46,231
not getting enough hugs
as a kid.

1416
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:51,203
Really doing some serious
processing right now, Dad.

1417
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,870
What have I done?

1418
01:10:52,872 --> 01:10:54,839
Open the door!

1419
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,913
Guys!

1420
01:11:00,915 --> 01:11:03,182
Guys! You have to help me!

1421
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:05,253
Meechee's taken the smallfoot
below the clouds!

1422
01:11:07,821 --> 01:11:10,289
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.

1423
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,857
I can explain everything.
After we find Meechee.

1424
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:15,360
She's in danger.
You have to believe me!

1425
01:11:15,362 --> 01:11:18,396
Why should we believe you?
You lied.

1426
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:19,731
Friends don't do that.

1427
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,933
Or stab you in the back
and call you crazy

1428
01:11:21,935 --> 01:11:23,669
in front of the whole village.

1429
01:11:23,671 --> 01:11:26,774
You acted like me.
I expect more from you.

1430
01:11:28,908 --> 01:11:30,844
You're right. I lied.

1431
01:11:33,546 --> 01:11:35,547
You know, you've always
searched for the truth.

1432
01:11:35,549 --> 01:11:36,949
No matter what anybody said.

1433
01:11:36,951 --> 01:11:38,950
They laughed at you,
they called you names.

1434
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:41,219
Wait. What names?

1435
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:43,925
But you never let fear
get in the way.

1436
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,862
That's what
I should have done.

1437
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,535
And it's what
I'm gonna do now.

1438
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:58,773
Migo!

1439
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:03,443
Wait! What names?

1440
01:12:15,823 --> 01:12:18,557
Oh, Meechee, where are you?

1441
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:29,301
- Kolka!
- Hi!

1442
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,703
Hi! Wait.
If you're here, that means...

1443
01:12:36,277 --> 01:12:38,610
Man! That is
a long way down!

1444
01:12:39,747 --> 01:12:40,748
Guys!

1445
01:12:43,617 --> 01:12:44,816
You came!

1446
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:47,319
Of course we came.
For Meechee.

1447
01:12:48,855 --> 01:12:50,688
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

1448
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:53,458
And a little bit for you.
But mostly Meechee.

1449
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,893
Thank you. Even you, Fleem.

1450
01:12:55,895 --> 01:12:57,329
Wait, where's Fleem?

1451
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,330
Okay, pros and cons.

1452
01:12:59,332 --> 01:13:00,731
Pro, Migo needs you.

1453
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:02,700
Con, you're useless to him
if you're dead.

1454
01:13:03,937 --> 01:13:06,804
Cons, one, pros, zero.
Okay. Pro.

1455
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:08,706
Yeah, Fleem sucks.

1456
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:10,609
We can't wait.
We have to find Meechee

1457
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:12,447
right now
before someone else does.

1458
01:13:15,549 --> 01:13:17,749
It's so big.

1459
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:19,151
How do we even know
she landed here?

1460
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:24,690
Okay, little guy.

1461
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,325
You can breathe easy now.

1462
01:13:27,327 --> 01:13:28,328
You're home. See?

1463
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:30,331
Home.

1464
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,467
What is that?

1465
01:13:40,373 --> 01:13:41,908
Wait, where am I?

1466
01:13:49,515 --> 01:13:51,016
What?

1467
01:13:51,018 --> 01:13:53,084
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

1468
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,391
Okay.

1469
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:00,124
- Brenda?
- Percy?

1470
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,129
Percy! You're alive!

1471
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:06,831
You're alive!

1472
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,366
Oh, my gosh,
you are alive, aren't you?

1473
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:09,868
Not dead. Raring to go.

1474
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:11,535
Know that I risked my life

1475
01:14:11,537 --> 01:14:12,803
in pursuit of
something extraordinary.

1476
01:14:12,805 --> 01:14:14,039
Something bigger than us.

1477
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:15,507
My video.

1478
01:14:15,509 --> 01:14:16,874
I uploaded it
like you told me to

1479
01:14:16,876 --> 01:14:19,378
and it went totally viral!

1480
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,679
It was real, right?
I mean, I have the suit.

1481
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:23,981
You found a yeti.

1482
01:14:23,983 --> 01:14:25,784
My phone has been ringing
like crazy.

1483
01:14:25,786 --> 01:14:27,486
Everyone wants you.

1484
01:14:27,488 --> 01:14:29,490
Haven't you checked
your messages?

1485
01:14:31,992 --> 01:14:33,090
My life in pursuit

1486
01:14:33,092 --> 01:14:35,627
of something extraordinary.

1487
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:36,828
Percy, my favorite client! It's
your agent. I want you back. Call me.

1488
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,629
This is Mark Birden

1489
01:14:38,631 --> 01:14:40,531
from the National Geographic
Society. Call me!

1490
01:14:40,533 --> 01:14:42,700
Percy, it's your dad!
I'm no longer ashamed of you!

1491
01:14:42,702 --> 01:14:44,736
Hi, this is the New York
Times calling again...

1492
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:45,937
I got your number
from a friend of a friend.

1493
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:47,539
I saw your video.

1494
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:55,045
Percy,
it's Gayle at the network.

1495
01:14:55,047 --> 01:14:56,580
I saw your video!

1496
01:14:56,582 --> 01:14:58,682
If you can
get that yeti alive,

1497
01:14:58,684 --> 01:15:00,518
you and your show are saved!

1498
01:15:01,854 --> 01:15:03,088
This is
everything you wanted.

1499
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:06,094
Wait, the yeti is here?

1500
01:15:08,694 --> 01:15:10,762
I can't believe
what I'm looking at.

1501
01:15:10,764 --> 01:15:12,463
This is incredible!

1502
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:17,004
What is that?

1503
01:15:18,205 --> 01:15:20,038
So pretty.

1504
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,973
Oh, my gosh, a baby smallfoot!

1505
01:15:22,975 --> 01:15:24,942
You are so cute!

1506
01:15:26,846 --> 01:15:29,847
Wow, you are so limber!

1507
01:15:29,849 --> 01:15:31,651
Yeah!

1508
01:15:33,053 --> 01:15:34,455
Wait, you're not real,
are you?

1509
01:15:37,657 --> 01:15:40,224
Super pointy.

1510
01:15:40,226 --> 01:15:42,460
Oh, it's so pretty.

1511
01:15:42,462 --> 01:15:44,463
Another smallfoot!

1512
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:46,097
How many of you are there?

1513
01:15:46,099 --> 01:15:48,200
Oh, a lot.

1514
01:15:48,202 --> 01:15:49,804
Hi.

1515
01:15:55,608 --> 01:15:58,477
Those are fast.

1516
01:16:09,989 --> 01:16:12,190
Guys, I've looked everywhere.
Meechee's not here.

1517
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:13,761
Yeah, I think I found her.

1518
01:16:16,529 --> 01:16:18,896
Oh, this is amazing!

1519
01:16:25,506 --> 01:16:26,741
Hey...

1520
01:16:27,741 --> 01:16:29,508
Oh, no, no, no.

1521
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,645
Okay, that's really bright.

1522
01:16:31,577 --> 01:16:34,078
Hey!

1523
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,746
What is going on?

1524
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:44,789
Why are you doing this?

1525
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,969
Meechee! We're here.
It's okay.

1526
01:16:58,971 --> 01:17:00,704
Thank you.

1527
01:17:00,706 --> 01:17:02,039
Actually, it's not okay,
we're in the worst place ever.

1528
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:03,240
But we're together!

1529
01:17:03,242 --> 01:17:04,575
Yes.

1530
01:17:04,577 --> 01:17:06,076
Wait, where's Fleem?

1531
01:17:06,078 --> 01:17:09,614
Pros, 10. Cons, 65.
Oh, this is torture!

1532
01:17:09,616 --> 01:17:11,148
- Fleem's pathetic.
- Yeah.

1533
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,784
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

1534
01:17:12,786 --> 01:17:14,886
But why did they just
turn on me like that?

1535
01:17:14,888 --> 01:17:16,754
Because they're
terrible creatures.

1536
01:17:16,756 --> 01:17:18,222
You! Why are you here?

1537
01:17:18,224 --> 01:17:19,824
- You're angry.
- You think?

1538
01:17:19,826 --> 01:17:22,294
Meechee, I'm so, so sorry.

1539
01:17:22,296 --> 01:17:25,129
But believe me, I said
what I said to protect you.

1540
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:27,065
Protect me? By lying?

1541
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:28,333
She's got a point there, Migo.

1542
01:17:28,335 --> 01:17:29,633
Haven't you been lying
to your dad,

1543
01:17:29,635 --> 01:17:31,136
secret leader of the S.E.S.?

1544
01:17:31,138 --> 01:17:32,337
He's got a point there, Meech.

1545
01:17:32,339 --> 01:17:33,804
This is completely different.

1546
01:17:33,806 --> 01:17:35,072
Besides, what did you think

1547
01:17:35,074 --> 01:17:37,776
you were protecting me
from anyway?

1548
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,280
From that.

1549
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:47,352
This is what your dad
showed me.

1550
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:48,723
This is why I lied.

1551
01:17:49,656 --> 01:17:50,725
They're monsters.

1552
01:17:56,129 --> 01:18:00,197
No, they think we're monsters.

1553
01:18:00,199 --> 01:18:02,303
Guys, guys!
They're getting closer.

1554
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,705
They're gonna find us.
What are we gonna do?

1555
01:18:07,707 --> 01:18:09,074
We gotta go. Now.

1556
01:18:09,076 --> 01:18:10,944
Are they really all bad?

1557
01:18:13,046 --> 01:18:14,646
I don't know.

1558
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,288
But we can't wait around here
to find out.

1559
01:18:54,921 --> 01:18:56,053
Where are they?

1560
01:18:56,055 --> 01:18:58,789
I swear they came this way.

1561
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,825
Found them!

1562
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:02,192
Oh, no!
Where are you going?

1563
01:19:02,194 --> 01:19:04,396
They're not gonna get 'em
before I do!

1564
01:19:04,398 --> 01:19:05,996
Percy!

1565
01:19:05,998 --> 01:19:07,999
Let's go. Come on.

1566
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:09,337
Getting down here was easier.

1567
01:19:27,386 --> 01:19:29,189
Oh, no! Migo, we're trapped!

1568
01:19:31,257 --> 01:19:32,859
Stay out of the light!

1569
01:19:44,336 --> 01:19:46,139
The whole robe.

1570
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,749
I told you the stones
were here to protect us.

1571
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:58,816
Daddy!

1572
01:19:58,818 --> 01:19:59,819
Meechee!

1573
01:20:00,854 --> 01:20:02,053
You came for me.

1574
01:20:02,055 --> 01:20:04,759
Of course I came. I listened.

1575
01:20:06,326 --> 01:20:07,491
Thank you.

1576
01:20:09,129 --> 01:20:10,895
What are those things?

1577
01:20:17,336 --> 01:20:18,772
Migo, come on! We can make it.

1578
01:20:20,073 --> 01:20:21,205
Go!

1579
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:22,406
What are you doing?

1580
01:20:22,408 --> 01:20:23,907
We can't let them
follow us home.

1581
01:20:23,909 --> 01:20:25,375
- Migo!
- Just go!

1582
01:20:25,377 --> 01:20:26,880
No!

1583
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,752
Here I am! Come and get me!

1584
01:20:56,777 --> 01:20:58,779
Gwangi, come on! Gotta hurry.

1585
01:21:17,029 --> 01:21:18,463
Friends, right?

1586
01:21:18,465 --> 01:21:21,268
I hope you understand
why I have to do this.

1587
01:21:24,037 --> 01:21:25,203
No!

1588
01:21:27,107 --> 01:21:29,072
Oh, no! They got him!

1589
01:21:29,074 --> 01:21:31,142
- Meechee!
- Migo!

1590
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,402
There!

1591
01:22:02,274 --> 01:22:04,210
No!

1592
01:22:16,956 --> 01:22:19,156
Oh, darn! You got me.

1593
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:21,191
Do you
think this is some kind of joke?

1594
01:22:21,193 --> 01:22:23,328
That depends.
Did you think it was funny?

1595
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:25,362
Just a publicity stunt
for ratings.

1596
01:22:25,364 --> 01:22:27,565
Loser.

1597
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:30,235
That's not Migo!
So, where's Migo?

1598
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:31,636
He shot me.

1599
01:22:31,638 --> 01:22:35,606
- Migo!
- You smallfoot shot me.

1600
01:22:35,608 --> 01:22:37,374
I can't feel my face!

1601
01:22:37,376 --> 01:22:39,009
Wait, so he is bad?

1602
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:41,111
No, no, he's not bad.

1603
01:22:41,113 --> 01:22:43,548
I think he shot me to save me.

1604
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:46,116
Yeah. You're right. He did.

1605
01:22:46,118 --> 01:22:47,554
He saved all of us.

1606
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:52,289
Well, there goes my fame.

1607
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:55,862
Yeah. But you have
something better. Integrity.

1608
01:22:57,063 --> 01:22:59,998
Where was that hiding?

1609
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,532
Thank you, Brenda.

1610
01:23:02,534 --> 01:23:04,602
You're under arrest
for disturbing the peace,

1611
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,437
destruction
of public property,

1612
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:08,071
discharging fireworks
within the city limits...

1613
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:09,206
Wait. Hang on.

1614
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,209
Internet fraud, loitering,

1615
01:23:11,211 --> 01:23:12,346
looking weird.

1616
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:39,469
I love that little guy.
I love you guys too.

1617
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:45,043
And you are so awesome
and smart,

1618
01:23:45,045 --> 01:23:47,581
and I'm meet you. I mish you.

1619
01:23:48,415 --> 01:23:50,080
I mush you.

1620
01:23:51,283 --> 01:23:53,418
I mush you too, Migo.

1621
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:56,987
Okay, everyone, let's go home.

1622
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:06,230
Okay, what'd I miss?

1623
01:24:14,273 --> 01:24:17,208
This is our history.
And these are our ancestors.

1624
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,709
There was a time when yetis

1625
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:20,378
lived beneath the clouds.

1626
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,646
We came up here

1627
01:24:21,648 --> 01:24:23,246
where the smallfoot
couldn't survive.

1628
01:24:23,248 --> 01:24:25,148
You see, I thought
the smallfoot was my enemy.

1629
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:26,584
And then he saved me.

1630
01:24:26,586 --> 01:24:29,087
And I know that I said
it wasn't a smallfoot,

1631
01:24:29,089 --> 01:24:31,356
but that wasn't true.

1632
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,293
And I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

1633
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,759
The smallfoot is real,

1634
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:38,562
and they live
below the clouds.

1635
01:24:38,564 --> 01:24:40,099
Clouds we make.

1636
01:24:42,668 --> 01:24:45,770
And this is why our ancestors
decided to do that.

1637
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:49,009
That's the truth. See?

1638
01:24:50,275 --> 01:24:52,776
It's complicated,
and it can be scary,

1639
01:24:52,778 --> 01:24:54,415
but it's better than
living a lie.

1640
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:57,351
Like, way better.

1641
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:01,386
So we didn't fall

1642
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,154
out of the butt
of the great sky yak?

1643
01:25:03,156 --> 01:25:04,288
Probably not.

1644
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:05,757
Whose butt did we fall out of?

1645
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:08,058
- You know what, we'll circle back.
- Got it.

1646
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,560
So, now you know.

1647
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:12,362
We think they're monsters,
and they think we are.

1648
01:25:12,364 --> 01:25:15,732
And that is not gonna change
by us hiding.

1649
01:25:15,734 --> 01:25:17,468
We have to communicate.

1650
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:20,303
So, it's up to us to decide
what we wanna do.

1651
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,496
Oh, yeah!

1652
01:26:23,769 --> 01:26:28,572
<i>It's time, time to do</i>

1653
01:26:28,574 --> 01:26:32,211
<i>Something drastic,
something new</i>

1654
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:37,514
<i>Right here
and right now</i>

1655
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:42,853
<i>We need to find a way somehow</i>

1656
01:26:42,855 --> 01:26:47,325
<i>It's about reaching out,
closing up the distance</i>

1657
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:48,758
<i>Instead of hate</i>

1658
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,230
<i>Celebrate all the ways
we're different</i>

1659
01:26:52,232 --> 01:26:56,633
<i>I am optimistic,
yes, I do believe</i>

1660
01:26:56,635 --> 01:27:00,504
<i>We have the power to make
this world a better place</i>

1661
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:02,740
<i>But if it's ever gonna change</i>

1662
01:27:02,742 --> 01:27:05,575
<i>We gotta come together,
me and you</i>

1663
01:27:05,577 --> 01:27:09,614
<i>In a mo-oh-oh, oh-oh,
a moment of truth</i>

1664
01:27:09,616 --> 01:27:11,883
<i>If it's ever gonna change</i>

1665
01:27:11,885 --> 01:27:14,919
<i>We gotta come together,
me and you</i>

1666
01:27:14,921 --> 01:27:19,423
<i>In a mo-oh-oh, oh-oh,
a moment of truth</i>

1667
01:27:26,632 --> 01:27:28,231
I'm not crazy!

1668
01:27:40,779 --> 01:27:43,713
Pro, if you go down there,
you'll meet lots of people.

1669
01:27:43,715 --> 01:27:46,217
Con, you're not really
a people person.

1670
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,752
Oh, this is torture!

1671
01:31:11,991 --> 01:31:14,090
Okay, in three, two...

1672
01:31:14,092 --> 01:31:15,558
On the next episode of...

1673
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,764
Wait. Am I missing a tooth?
