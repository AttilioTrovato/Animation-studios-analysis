Flint Lockwood is a wannabe-scientist who lives in Swallow Falls, a fictional tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean that has sardines as the base of its economy, but the Baby Brent Sardines cannery shut down due to worldwide disgust of sardines as food, which was all the residents had to eat from then on. Flint lives with Tim, his widowed technophobic father, and his pet monkey, Steve. Despite Flint's enthusiasm, his inventions, including spray-on shoes, a flying car, a monkey thought translator, hair "un-balder", a remote-controlled TV, and rat birds, all end in failure.

One day, Flint invents a machine that transforms water into food called the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator" (FLDSMDFR). Flint turns on the FLDSMDFR in his laboratory, but ends up overloading and subsequently shorting out his house's electrical supply. He then decides to power the machine by hooking it up to a nearby transformer. When he turns the machine back on, it ends up rocketing through town, destroying Sardine Land (a park conceived by the mayor) before ultimately shooting up into the sky. While recovering from his failure, Flint meets Samantha "Sam" Sparks, a weather intern whose big break was ruined by the incident. Their conversation is curtailed when brightly colored clouds float over the town and began to rain cheeseburgers.

The town rejoices in their renewed food choices, and Flint creates a communication device to send orders to the machine and order it to create different types of food. As a result, Swallow Falls (now renamed Chewandswallow) suddenly becomes a successful "food tourism" destination. Flint and Sam grow closer and Sam opens up to Flint about her bullied past and how she felt like she had to hide who she truly was: a “nerd”. Flint encourages her to be herself because she’s beautiful just the way she is and the two almost kiss. Everything is going well until the townsfolk start greedily requesting food from Flint's machine. Flint notices that the food is beginning to grow larger in size. Although he is concerned that the food is starting to "over mutate", the now morbidly obese mayor sees it as profitable for him and the city, and guilt trips Flint into continuing to make food rain.

Citizens and worldly tourists in Chewandswallow are blissful until suddenly a large tornado formed of spaghetti and meatballs threatens the town. Flint rushes to his lab to turn off the FLDSMDFR by sending a "kill code" to stop the machine, but the mayor, while trying to stop him by throwing a giant radish at him, accidentally destroys the communication device after ordering a Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet (VSAYCB). Now unable to control the machine, the FLDSMDFR creates a massive food storm which threatens the entire world, and colossal food downpours terrorize various cities and their landmarks. Flint gives up and loses hope; however, Tim encourages him to fix the mess. Flint gains self-confidence, places the kill code in a USB flash drive, and builds a new flying car to reach and destroy the FLDSMDFR, with the aid of Sam, her cameraman Manny, Steve and Brent (namesake of the Baby Brent Sardines cannery).

As they approach the machine in the sky, they find that it is now serving as the core of a giant meatball asteroid which it created, where clouds go in the top and large food storms comes out the bottom. The machine sends living food to attack them as the flash drive with the kill code flies out of the window.

Back at Chewandswallow, the citizens and tourists escape while the last leftovers fall. Mt. Leftovers collapses, causing an avalanche of food that destroys the town. Despite the avalanche ravaging Flint's lab, Tim manages to re-send the kill code to Flint's cell phone from there. Flint, Sam and Brent then go inside the meatball and Brent gets eaten by a roast chicken; becoming Chicken Brent. Sam lowers Flint down a tunnel covered in peanut brittle, until she gets cut and her face and arms begin swelling up because of her allergy to peanuts. Flint instructs Brent to take Sam back to the plane and get her a shot but Sam refuses to let Flint go. They two confess their attraction for each other before Flint selflessly cuts the rope and plummets down. There, he finds the machine, and connects the phone to a port. To his horror, Flint discovers that Tim accidentally sent him the wrong file, which is a funny cat video, so he is unable to stop the FLDSMDFR. Instead, Flint uses his Spray-On Shoes formula on the machine, causing it to explode, seemingly killing him. With the machine destroyed, the food storm subsides and everyone is able to return safely to Chewandswallow. Flint is revealed to have survived the explosion and Tim finally shows his appreciation for his son and his inventions and Flint and Sam celebrate with a kiss.

Meanwhile, the obese mayor is seen stranded in the middle of the sea, having eaten nearly all of his peanut butter and jelly sandwich boat, while muttering to himself that his plan was not well thought out.
