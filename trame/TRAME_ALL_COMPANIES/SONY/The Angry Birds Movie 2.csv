Three years[N 2] after the Birds destroyed Pig City as retribution for the Pigs' theft of their eggs,[N 3] Red now protects Bird Island from pigs with Chuck and Bomb. The pigs, led by King Leonard Mudbeard, are in a prank war against the birds after Piggy Island is rebuilt. Eventually, a giant ice ball from a nearby island called Eagle Island hits the sea near Piggy Island, forcing the pigs to seek a truce with the birds. Zeta, the leader of Eagle Island, is fed up with her frozen surroundings and wants to occupy the two islands by shooting ice balls from a super-weapon to force their inhabitants to evacuate. Meanwhile, three hatchlings, one of whom is Terence and Matilda's daughter Zoe, plan to reenact a battle using Zoe's three egg siblings, but the eggs drift out to sea by accident. They set sail to retrieve them, but a whale blows them into a cloud. They manage to get them down after inflating Zoe into the air only to misplace them again. Chuck and Bomb force Red to join them in a speed dating activity, where Red meets Chuck's sister Silver, an engineering student who deems Red incompatible.[N 4] Leonard visits Red and convinces him to ally with the pigs. They recruit Chuck, Bomb, Silver and Bird Island's retired hero, Mighty Eagle. Silver was demonstrating a new invention, Super String, a very strong string, when she was recruited. A meeting in Mighty Eagle's cave is disrupted when an ice ball from Zeta's super-weapon hits Eagle Mountain, which alarms the other birds living on Bird Island. As the team travels to Eagle Island by submarine, Red assures the other birds that they do not need to evacuate. Once there, Mighty Eagle confesses that Zeta was once his fiancée but he abandoned her due to cowardice before he flies away. Red insists on fighting alone but Silver decides to follow him instead. They intrude the base from the mouth of the weapon only to be captured. The other team members disguise themselves as an eagle and grab a key card to get into the base. Elsewhere, the three hatchlings finally find the eggs on a small island, guarded by a snake. They defeat it and plan to drift back to Bird Island, but arrive at Piggy Island by mistake and are greeted by three piglets. As Red and Silver are frozen to inflatables, Zeta tells them her plan to fire ice balls filled with lava at both islands, then demonstrates her newly upgraded cannon. Red, regretting not telling the birds to evacuate, admits his selfish desire to be liked by everyone to Silver, who comforts him and frees them both. The duo reunite with the rest of the team and Red gives up leadership to Silver, who establishes a plan to destroy the weapon. Red and Silver put themselves inside an ice ball and roll it down the spiraling ammunition track of Zeta's super weapon, with their allies working to sever the track by reaching and pulling a switch so that the ball would fly off and crush the cannon, but the plan fails and the whole team are confronted by Zeta and her guards, giving her a chance to fire the weapon. Mighty Eagle (whose real name is revealed as Ethan) arrives and makes a desperate attempt to stop Zeta by apologizing to her. Zeta brushes him off, revealing that her servant Debbie is their daughter. While Zeta is distracted, Chuck ties up the weapon using Silver's super-string, which catches and decelerates the lava balls after Zeta fires them. As the string breaks, the hatchlings and the piglets passing by Eagle Island help grasp it. The lava balls slide back into the weapon, destroying it and the whole base. Everyone escapes, and Mighty Eagle protects Debbie from being crushed by a metal plate, redeeming himself to her and Zeta. Mighty Eagle and Zeta get married on Bird Island, with Red as the chief witness. Afterwards, Red credits Silver and the entire team for saving the islands, and finds himself being even more beloved for his honesty and selflessness. Meanwhile, Silver and Red start a relationship. The hatchlings put the eggs back home, but three snakelets hatch instead. The injured mother snake comes and exchanges the babies with them, only for the three new babies to drift out to sea again, much to the hatchlings’ dismay.
