The film begins where the previous film left off. Inventor Flint Lockwood and his friends celebrate their success of saving the world from the food storm created by the """Flint" Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food "Replicator""" (FLDSMDFR), but this has left their island home town of Swallow Falls covered in food. Super-inventor Chester V, the CEO of Live Corp and Flint's childhood idol, offers his company's services to clean the island and helps to relocate the population to nearby San Franjose, California. Chester also invites Flint to work at Live Corp. During his short tenure at Live Corp, Flint attempts to become a Thinkquanaut (one of Chester's most trusted employees), only to humiliate himself during a presentation. Chester shows Flint that the FLDSMDFR is apparently still functioning, as the island is full of food-animal hybrids (foodimals), one of which is attacking and eating the thinkquanauts stationed on the island. Chester tells Flint he needs to travel to the island, find the FLDSMDFR, and insert a special USB device into it to destroy it and end the threat before the foodimals escape to the rest of the world. Though the mission is meant to be classified, Flint invites his friends to help: his girlfriend and meteorologist Sam Sparks; her cameraman Manny; police officer Earl Devereaux; Steve, his pet monkey who communicates via a device on his chest; and his former rival, “Chicken” Brent. He also grudgingly accepts the help of Tim, his widowed father, who takes them to the island by his fishing boat. When Chester learns that Flint is not alone, he and his assistant Barb, a super-intelligent orangutan with a human brain, soon follow along with several Live Corp employees. While Tim stays with the boat, thus making friends with some bipedal pickles and teaching them to fish, Flint and his friends work their way through the jungle-like environment that now completely covers Swallow Falls. They encounter the numerous forms of foodimals, such as bananostriches, shrimpanzees, hippotatomuses, etc, including a living strawberry they call """Barry""." Meanwhile, a giant cheespider (a cheeseburger for the body and french-fries for the legs) chases Flint and the gang, but Chester arrives shortly before it closes in on them, scaring it off and offering to help Flint with the rest of the mission. Sam becomes suspicious of Chester's motives, as his claims that the foodimals are dangerous do not align with what they have observed already. Flint, afraid to fail again, refuses to accept Sam's statements, and she and the rest of Flint's friends strike out on their own. Sam and the gang eventually encounter the cheespider again, only to find that she's a warm and gentle foodimal. She and the other animals only attack people wearing Live Corp gear, which Sam and the gang were doing earlier. When Manny deduces that the foodimals have realized """live""" is merely meant to be an anagram of """evil""," the remaining Live Corp employees, of which are named 'Sentinels of Safety', attack and hold the group hostage. Flint, Barb, and Chester finally track down the FLDSMDFR. As Flint is about to insert the USB device, the sentient machine creates a baby marshmallow, which is lovingly welcomed by a family of marshmallows. Flint recognizes the mistake he almost made, as the machine, which attached itself to the island's ecosystem and altered it in the process, is acting as the life force to all the foodimals on the island and is not dangerous to them in any way. He refuses to use the USB device, but Chester attacks and is able to seize control of the FLDSMDFR. Chester knocks Flint into a river, where he is rescued by the marshmallows and reunites with Tim. Without the FLDSMDFR, he and his father find that the existing foodimals on the island are unable to produce new foodimals and flourish. As Flint offers his condolences to the endangered foodimals, he is surprised to discover that the foodimals, having watched old footage of Flint inventing the FLDSMDFR, have dubbed him """Inwoo""," their creator, and revere him. Inspired, Flint vows to get his machine and friends back. Tim and the foodimals help Flint and Barry sneak into the Live Corp base. Flint challenges Chester to turn over the FLDSMDFR, but Chester threatens to use his friends in his food bar processing machine. Chester announces his plan to use the FLDSMDFR and the foodimals he's captured to make food bars as well. Barb, who has grown tired of Chester's insults, objects to the violence and is fired by Chester. Flint apologizes to the gang, and with the help of Sam and Steve is able to use his inventions to beat Chester and free the others, while Chester's captive foodimals are freed by Barry and proceed to drive away the Live Corp employees. Chester tries to escape with the FLDSMDFR, but he is cornered by the gang and the foodimals, and Barb steals the machine back from him, inadvertently sending him tumbling into the food processor. Chester manages to survive with the help of his own inventions, but is swallowed by the cheespider while he is gloating. Later, Flint returns the FLDSMDFR to the rock candy mountain where he found it and removes the USB device, successfully reactivating it. Doing this allows the machine to continue being sentient, and create foodimals at its own will. The foodimals continue to flourish naturally. Flint reconciles with Sam and Tim, who lets him try out fishing for the first time. It is shown during the credits that the residents of Swallow Falls have returned to their proper homes, adapting to the altered ecosystem and happily continuing their lives. The FLDSMDFR still continues foodimal production, and they continue to flourish alongside the humans. In a mid-credit scene, Barb develops a crush on Steve, attempting to ask him out on a date.
