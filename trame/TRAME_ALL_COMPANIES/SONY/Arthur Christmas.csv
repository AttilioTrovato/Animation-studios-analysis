On Christmas Eve, hundreds of Christmas elves helm the command centre of Father Christmas's mile-wide,[6] ultra-high-tech sleigh-esque craft, the S-1. The current Santa, Malcolm Claus, and the Christmas elves deliver presents to every child in the world using advanced equipment and military precision. These complex operations are micromanaged by thousands more elves under the command of Malcolm's militaristic eldest son and heir-apparent Steve and his obsequious elfin assistant Peter at mission control underneath the North Pole. Meanwhile, his younger son—the clumsy, nervous, yet enthusiastic Arthur—devotedly answers the letters to Santa. During one of the delivery operations in France, a toy is accidentally activated, waking a child and nearly revealing the presence of Santa. A tense escape operation ensues, during which a Christmas elf aboard the S-1 inadvertently leans on a button, causing a present to fall from the supply line and go unnoticed. Having completed his seventieth mission, Malcolm is portrayed as far past his prime, his role in field operations largely relegated to that of a figurehead. He delivers a congratulatory speech to the elves, announcing that he looks forward to his seventy-first mission—much to the frustration of Steve, who had prepared to succeed his father as Santa at the conclusion of this mission. During their family Christmas dinner, a board game degenerates into a tense quarrel between Malcolm and Steve, while Malcolm's father and predecessor Grandsanta, bored by retirement, expresses resentment of the modernization of the operation. In a moment alone, Arthur tries to reassure Steve he'll be Santa soon, but is ignored when it transpires a wrapping elf, Bryony Shelfley, has found the missed present—a bicycle for a little girl in England named Gwen, to whose letter Arthur had personally responded. Arthur alerts his father, who is exhausted and at a loss as to how to handle the situation; Steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable error whose correction can wait a few days, citing this year's Christmas as the most successful in history. Malcolm uneasily takes Steve's side. Arthur falls into despair at the thought of Gwen's broken heart, and Grandsanta, on learning of the situation, whisks Bryony and a reluctant Arthur away in """Evie""," his old wooden sleigh. In the process, the three get lost, lose several of their reindeer, and land in danger several times, ultimately being mistaken for aliens and causing an international military incident. Arthur learns, to his disappointment, that Grandsanta's true motive is to fulfill his own ego. His hopes are further dashed when Steve, given a perfect opportunity to help, refuses, to protect his own standing as """hero" of the "day""." He also shows Arthur that their father has gone to bed, to make Arthur think Malcolm doesn't care either. Stranded in Cuba after losing the sleigh, Arthur regains his Christmas spirit when he rereads Gwen's letter and realizes that even if his father and Steve don't care, Gwen will still believe in Santa and think he cares no matter who delivers the present. He manages to recover the sleigh, but they lose Bryony's GPS and set off into orbit to find England from there. Meanwhile, the elves grow increasingly alarmed at rumours of the neglected delivery and the Clauses' apparent indifference, sending the North Pole into a panic. In response, Malcolm, Margaret, and Steve take the S-1 and deliver a superior present, but to the wrong child. Trying to manage without Steve or the elves, Malcolm is finally forced to admit he is no longer up to the job. Arthur and his company reach England but lose the remaining reindeer coming back into the atmosphere. Furthermore, a Predator drone scrambled by Chief De Silva of UNFITA intercepts and opens fire on the sleigh, believing it to be an alien spacecraft. Grandsanta sacrifices Evie, while Arthur and Bryony parachute to the ground. Bryony manages to re-wrap the present but is injured and left stranded in a tree, and Arthur goes on alone. All four male Clauses ultimately arrive at Gwen's house before she awakens, only to have all but Arthur quarrel about who gets to actually place the gift. Noticing that only Arthur truly cares about the girl's feelings, the elder Clauses collectively realize that he is the sole worthy successor. As a result, Malcolm gives Arthur the honour of delivering the gift, and Steve, recognizing his own shortcomings, forfeits his birthright and acknowledges his brother's worthiness to take up the mantle. Gwen glimpses a snow-bearded Arthur in a wind-buffeted sweater just before he vanishes up into the S-1. In a postscript, Malcolm goes into a happy retirement with Margaret—where he also becomes Grandsanta's much-desired new companion—and plays Arthur's board game with him for many happy hours. Meanwhile, Steve finds true contentment as the chief operating officer of the North Pole. Bryony is promoted to Vice-President of Packing, Pacific Division. The high-tech S-1 is rechristened EVIE in honour of Grandsanta's old sleigh and refitted to be pulled by a team of five thousand reindeer led by those sired by the original eight, all of whom have managed to return home safely. Arthur happily guides the entire enterprise as Santa Claus XXI.
