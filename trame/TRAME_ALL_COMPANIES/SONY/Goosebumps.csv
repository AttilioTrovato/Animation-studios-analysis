After his father's recent death, Zach Cooper and his mother Gale move from New York City to the peaceful town of Madison, Delaware. While settling in the neighborhood, Zach meets his neighbor Hannah, but her overprotective father warns him to avoid contact with them. The next morning, at Madison High School, where Gale works as vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ, a clumsy student. That night, Hannah invites Zach to an abandoned amusement park where they start to befriend. However, when they return home, Hannah's father warns again that Zach stay away or something bad will happen. The following night, Gale leaves to supervise a dance at the school, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine Conyers. Fearing that Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the local police station while he and Champ enter in his home. While investigating, both find a bookshelf with numerous books from the Goosebumps franchise, each mysteriously locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach opens The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena, releasing the book's titular monster. With Hannah's help, they chase the creature to a local ice rink where Hannah's father appears and encloses the monster again the book. Hannah's father unwittingly reveals that he is Goosebumps creator, R. L. Stine. Back home, the group encounters Slappy the Dummy from the Night of the Living Dummy books. As revenge for being locked up for years, Slappy burns his book and flees with all the others. Stine and the kids are attacked by the lawn gnomes from Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes, being forced to escape. Slappy begins releasing several other monsters from their books, causing panic and destruction around Madison. Meanwhile, Lorraine is attacked by Fifi the Vampire Poodle from Please Don't Feed the Vampire!. Zach implores Stine to write a new book that can lock all the monsters back, but it can only be done with a supernatural typewriter in the school. Along the way, the group is attacked by Brent Green from My Best Friend Is Invisible and the giant praying mantis from A Shocker on Shock Street, forcing them to hide in the local supermarket. Will Blake from The Werewolf of Fever Swamp chases them to the parking lot where he is run over by Lorraine, who survived Fifi's attack. Stine and the kids go through a cemetery, where Zach realizes that Hannah shines in the moonlight before being attacked by ghouls from Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls. When they arrive at the school, Zach confronts Stine in private; he reveals that his """daughter""" is Hannah Fairchild from The Ghost Next Door, and that he created her to face his loneliness, although Hannah is unaware of this. Stine finds the typewriter and begins writing a book based on the events around them, while Zach and Champ try to warn everyone, but nobody believes them until the mantis attacks the building. Slappy releases the rest of the monsters from the books and they storm the school. Despite the students and school staff's efforts to keep the monsters out, they break in nonetheless. Slappy finds Stine and breaks his fingers with the typewriter's case before he can finish the book. To ensure everyone's safety, Stine and the kids trick them into following a school bus rigged with explosives while they board another bus to the abandoned amusement park. After realizing the group's ruse, Slappy tracks down and confronts them, he then releases the Blob from The Blob That Ate Everyone as the other monsters arrive at the park. Stine confronts the creature but is devoured while Zach, Hannah and Champ climb a ferris wheel to finish the book. However, the mantis causes it to collapse and roll towards the forest. Zach refuses to open the book, because Hannah will also be sucked in, but she reveals that she knew the truth about herself all along. Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the monsters inside, saying goodbye to Zach with a kiss before accepting her fate. Some time later, Stine starts working as a new teacher at Madison High School while starting to date Lorraine. After school, Stine reveals to Zach that he re-wrote Hannah back into reality with a new book. When Zach and Hannah leave school together, Stine burns Hannah's book, making her permanently real. However, when Stine is about to leave school, he looks at his typewriter writing by itself. To his horror, Brent Green was omitted in imprisonment, beginning to write a new Goosebumps book entitled The Invisible Boy's Revenge.
