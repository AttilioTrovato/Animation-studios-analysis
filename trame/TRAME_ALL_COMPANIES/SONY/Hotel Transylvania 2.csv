After the events of the first film,[10] Mavis (Selena Gomez) and her new fianc√© Johnny (Andy Samberg) are finally married, with the approval of her father Dracula (Adam Sandler), and the world becomes aware, and unafraid of the existence of monsters. Mavis later reveals to Drac that she is pregnant and later, she gives birth to a baby boy named Dennis (Asher Blinkoff). As Dennis' 5th birthday nears, he has yet to grow his fangs and Drac worries that his grandson might not gain vampire powers. Noticing the potential dangers of Transylvania, Mavis starts to consider raising Dennis where Johnny grew up, much to Drac's disapproval. Drac tells Johnny (who does not want to leave the hotel either) to bring Mavis to California to visit his parents, Mike and Linda, but to make sure to keep her distracted so that she will not move, leaving Drac to """babysit""" Dennis. Drac enlists his friends Frank (Kevin James), Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Griffin (David Spade), Murray (Keegan-Michael Key) and Blobby (Jonny Solomon) to help train Dennis to become a monster, to no avail. Drac takes Dennis to his childhood summer camp, Camp Winnepacaca, where he learned to hone his vampire abilities and discovers that the camp is safer than it was when he went there. Drac stubbornly believes Dennis is a """late" "fanger""," so he hurls Dennis from a tall, unstable tower to pressure the boy's transformation into a bat. Dennis, however, does not transform and Drac has to fly down and rescue him at the last second. The stunt is filmed by the campers and uploaded to the Internet, which eventually reaches Johnny and Mavis. Mavis angrily transforms into a bat to Johnny and Mavis back to Transylvania. Drac and his friends reach the hotel a couple of seconds after Mavis. She confronts her father for putting Dennis in grave danger and his inability to accept that he is human. She states she will move out of the hotel after Dennis' 5th birthday the following Wednesday. Drac hangs his head with deep guilt after Mavis tells him that he may have let humans into the hotel, but hasn't let them into his heart. Mavis invites Vlad (Mel Brooks), her grandfather and Drac's father, to Dennis' birthday party. As Vlad is much worse than he was when it comes to humans, Drac tells Johnny to have the human party-goers disguise themselves as monsters. Vlad receives the invitation and arrives with his monstrous bat-like servant Bela (Rob Riggle) to meet his great-grandson for the first time. Meeting him, he believes that fear will cause Dennis' fangs to sprout and possesses a stage performer dressed as Dennis' favorite TV monster """Kakie" the Cake "Monster""" (Chris Kattan) to scare Dennis, but Drac shields his frightened grandson at the last moment, breaks Vlad's hold over the performer, and exposes the deception to Vlad, who is outraged that Drac has accepted humans as guests in his hotel and let Johnny and Dennis be human. Drac confronts Vlad about how humans are different now. Mavis becomes upset with her grandfather's behavior. While the family argues, Dennis sadly flees the hotel and enters the forest with Wayne's daughter, Winnie (Sadie Sandler), who has a crush on Dennis, in tow, hiding in her treehouse. They are attacked by Bela, who mistakes Dennis for a human. When Bela injures Winnie and threatens to destroy the hotel, Dennis' anger causes him to instantly grow his fangs and his vampire abilities manifest. He begins to fight Bela, who calls his giant-bat minions. Drac, Johnny, Mavis, Dennis, the Loughran family and the rest of the monsters team up to defeat Bela's minions and drive them away. A livid Bela then attempts to kill Johnny himself with a stake. However, having been won over by Drac's claim that humans now coexist peacefully, Vlad shrinks Bela and tells him never to bother his family again, saving Johnny. Bela then tries to flee, but is caught and licked excessively by the werewolf pups. With Dennis having vampire abilities, Johnny and Mavis decide to continue raising him in Transylvania, and they resume the party with his friends and family.
