In the small town of Timberline, a 900-pound (408 kg) grizzly bear named Boog enjoys a captive, but pampered existence and spends his days as the star attraction of the town's nature show, while at night living in the garage of park ranger Beth, who has raised Boog since he was a cub. One day, the sadistic hunting fanatic Shaw drives into Timberline with a one-antlered deer strapped to the hood of his truck. After Boog frees him, the deer follows Boog home, only to find Boog sleeping in the garage. To wake Boog up, the deer throws rabbits at the window and introduces himself as Elliot. He tells Boog to be "free" from his garage captivity and introduces him to a world of sweet temptations he has never known. When Boog becomes sick from eating too many candy bars, events quickly spiral out of control, as the two raid a local convenience store. Elliot escapes before Boog is caught by a friend of Beth's, local police officer Gordy. At the nature show, Elliot, being chased by Shaw, sees Boog, who "attacks" Elliot. This causes the whole audience to panic.

Shaw attempts to shoot Boog and Elliot, but Beth sedates both animals with a tranquilizer gun just before Shaw fires his own gun. Shaw flees before Gordy can arrest him. The two animals are banned from the town and forced into the Timberline National Forest, only three days before open season starts, but they are relocated above the waterfalls, where they will be safe from the hunters. Since he lacks any outdoor survival skills, Boog reluctantly takes Elliot as his accident-prone guide to get him back home to Timberline to reunite with Beth, but in the woods, they quickly learn that animals can be extremely competitive. The two run into their share of forest animals, who think they are pests. The only forest animals they befriend are skunks, Maria and Rosie, ducks, Serge and Deni, various unnamed panic-stricken rabbits, the Scottish-accented squirrel, McSquizzy, along with his roguish gang, Reilly, a beaver and his construction worker team, a porcupine named Buddy that is in search of a friend, and the herd of deer led by Ian and his assistant, Giselle, with whom Elliot is in love.

Eventually, Boog learns about self-reliance and Elliot gains self-respect, and they start to become friends. The next day, it is revealed that Elliot has absolutely no idea where he and Boog are going and has been leading Boog in a big circle. After accidentally causing a flood at Reilly's dam, Boog and Elliot are confronted by Shaw; Boog then loses his toy bear, Dinkleman, as the current makes the doll float out of Boog's paw. They end up in a waterfall, which floods and sends the animals falling down into the hunting grounds. After thinking Shaw is dead, at first all the animals are furious at Boog, but then he accuses Elliot of lying to him about leading him home and driving everyone to the hunting grounds. Boog storms off, but unwittingly ends up in Shaw's log cabin, where he is discovered by Shaw, who is revealed to have survived, and pursues him to the city road where Boog happens upon the glowing lights of Timberline. Instead of deserting his companions, Boog reconciles with Elliot and helps the animals defend themselves using supplies taken from an RV owned by a friendly married couple named Bob and Bobbie, who are looking for Bigfoot, while their pet dachshund Mr. Weenie joins the forest animals.

The next day, the animals overpower the hunters, causing the hunters to retreat in defeat after McSquizzy blows up their trucks with a propane tank ignited by using an emergency flare. Shaw returns for a final confrontation and seemingly shoots Elliot, allowing Boog to furiously confront Shaw and quickly overpower him and ties him up with his own gun. Boog accompanies Elliot, who is actually alive but his second antler is broken by the shot. The forest animals thank Boog for his help and then proceed to take out their vengeance on Shaw by smothering him with honey and pillow feathers and banishing him from Timberline. While he gets banished, Shaw suddenly gets struck by Bob and Bobbie, who humorously mistake him for a Sasquatch and strap him on top of their trailer. Beth later returns in a helicopter to take Boog back home where he will be safe, but realizing how the adventures changed him, Boog decides to remain in the forest with his new friends.
