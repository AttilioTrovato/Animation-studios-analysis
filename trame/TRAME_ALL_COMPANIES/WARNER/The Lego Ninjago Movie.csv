A young boy visits an old relic shop where he meets the mysterious elderly owner Mr. Liu, who begins to tell him the story of Ninjago, a city within the LEGO universe which is frequently terrorized by the evil Lord Garmadon, who is the father of teenager Lloyd Garmadon and ex-husband of Misako (a.k.a. Koko). Everybody in all of the city of Ninjago hates Lloyd for being Lord Garmadon's son, thus putting Lloyd under emotional stress. Unbeknownst to them, Lloyd is part of a secret ninja force consisting of Nya, Zane, Jay, Cole, Kai and their master named Wu, who always stop Garmadon from taking over Ninjago City by fighting with mechs. When the general is again unsuccessful at conquering Ninjago, Garmadon's tech division shows him a new mech.

Meanwhile, Lloyd and his friends see the return of Master Wu, who tells them they aren't real ninja if they use only mechs to fight and hints that what will truly defeat Garmadon is their "unique element". He tells Lloyd that his particular element is green, but to Lloyd's frustration, all the other ninjas have a certain special element (for example, Jay has lightning, Cole has earth, Zane has ice, Nya has water and Kai has fire). Wu also mentions an "Ultimate Weapon" during their talk, giving Lloyd the hope of defeating Garmadon once and for all, despite Wu warning them that nobody can ever use the device. The next day, Garmadon again attacks Ninjago City with his giant mech and finally defeats Lloyd. As Garmadon arrogantly gloats over his conquering of Ninjago, Lloyd returns with the Ultimate Weapon and fires it only to reveal it's a laser pointer that attracts a live-action cat named Meowthra. Garmadon points the laser at the mechs which the cat destroys, but Lloyd breaks the laser pointer. As Garmadon celebrates his victory, Lloyd unmasks himself and tells Garmadon that he wishes he weren't his father, leaving Garmadon confused.

Lloyd meets up with his friends and Master Wu, who tells them they must use an "Ultimate, Ultimate Weapon" in order to stop Meowthra from destroying Ninjago City which is on the other side of Ninjago Island. Garmadon overhears Wu talking about the weapon, follows close behind, intercepts Wu and fights him only to end up in a cage defeated. However, Wu loses his balance and falls off a bridge into a river telling the ninja they must find "inner peace" before getting swept away. The ninja decide to continue on with Garmadon leading them, much to Lloyd's disappointment. Despite this, the two bond through their journey while the ninja learn to not to rely solely on their mechs to fight. The group survives an encounter with Garmadon's fired generals, and Garmadon teaches Lloyd to throw things (something which Lloyd was never good at).

They eventually crash down onto the Temple of Fragile Foundations, Garmadon's childhood home. He tells Lloyd that he wishes he had stayed with him and his mom after deciding to conquer Ninjago but he couldn't change so he had to stay behind. The ninja find the Ultimate, Ultimate Weapon consisting of a set of trinkets, only to have it stolen by Garmadon who remains resolute in taking over the city. He offers for Lloyd to be his general (who was fired earlier for defying Garmadon), but Lloyd rejects his offer. In a villainous breakdown, Garmadon locks all of them in the temple as it begins to collapse. Lloyd realizes that "inner peace" (piece) means for them to unleash their power within, and they successfully do this using their elemental powers and escaping from the collapsing temple. As they fall off a cliff, Wu saves them with his ship, the "Destiny's Bounty", and they head toward Ninjago.

Garmadon arrives and tries to defeat Meowthra with the Ultimate, Ultimate Weapon but Meowthra eats Garmadon instead. Lloyd and the crew arrive and begin fighting Garmadon's army. As Lloyd approaches Meowthra, he reveals to everyone that he is the green ninja and realizes that green means life and that his element of green is what connects the ninja together and his family together. He comforts Meowthra and apologizes to Garmadon profusely, saying that he forgives him. Garmadon cries tears of fire, which causes Meowthra to vomit him out. After reconciling, Meowthra becomes the mascot of Ninjago and Lloyd is hailed as a hero.

As the story concludes, Mr. Liu informs the boy that he will start training him as a ninja at dawn after the boy shows him great reflexes and ninja potential after listening to the story.
