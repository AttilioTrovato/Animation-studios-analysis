Following the events at the end of the first film, Duplo aliens arrive in the Lego universe and threaten destruction. Emmet builds the aliens a heart as a token of friendship, but one eats it and demands more. Lucy and the Master Builders believe this to be an attack and retaliate, and the ensuing battle ravages Bricksburg. Emmet tries to reassure Lucy that "everything can still be awesome".

Five years later, the now-teenaged Finn has rebuilt Bricksburg as "Apocalypseburg". Within the Lego universe, they have been ravaged by repeated Duplo attacks, and several of their friends have gone missing searching for the Duplo home planet. Emmet remains upbeat in stark contrast to Lucy and his friends, though he has visions of an impending "armamageddon". A mini-doll called General Sweet Mayhem arrives and kidnaps all of Emmet's friends and takes them to the shape-shifting empress of the "Systar System", Queen Watevera Wa'Nabi. Wa'Nabi is able to brainwash Emmet's friends into accepting the joy of her world, and convinces Batman to marry her as a way to unite the Lego and Duplo worlds. Only Lucy remains skeptical of Wa'Nabi's plans after they find their other friends from Apocalypseburg there, similarly brainwashed.

Back in Apocalypseburg, Emmet tries to convince the Master Builders to help him save Lucy and the rest of his friends, but they refuse to help, believing that Emmet is “stuck in the past”. So the construction worker crafts a spaceship to pursue Mayhem but must pass through the "Stairgate". The ship is heavily damaged and nearly collides with an asteroid field, but is saved in time by rugged adventurer Rex Dangervest. After hearing Emmet's story, Rex offers to help and takes them to the Systar System, and en route, Emmet tries to emulate some of Rex's mannerisms. When they arrive, they quickly reunite with Lucy and learn of the marriage plans, which Rex insists must be a front to bring on "armamageddon".

As the wedding starts, Emmet, Rex, and Lucy split up to sabotage the event. However, Lucy is intercepted by Mayhem, who insists the wedding is intended to prevent "armamageddon". At the ceremony, Wa'Nabi reveals her true form: the heart that Emmett tried to give the Duplo invaders. Lucy realises Mayhem is right, and Rex is the villain, but Emmett, with prompting from Rex, crashes the ceremony. In reality, Finn, after finding that Bianca had taken his Lego figures, has smashed her own creations. Their mother, who had to step in when they brawled over the last 5 years, is finally fed up with the children's fighting, and orders them to put away the Lego toys as punishment; Lucy recognizes this as Emmet's "armamageddon" (as in "Our mama gets in"). Both the Lego and Duplo figures are put into the "Bin of Storajj" and fear they will not escape.

Emmet tries to stop them but is prevented by Rex, who reveals he is a version of Emmet from his future. Rex had experienced these same events, and ended up under the dryer, forgotten by Finn. To ensure his future existence, he changed his appearance and created a time-travel machine to return to help Emmet but ensure "armamageddon" came to pass. When Emmet tries to fight back, Rex knocks him under the same dryer, ensuring that he would continue to exist.

Meanwhile, Finn and Bianca reconcile and start playing together. In the Lego universe, this act inspires Lucy and the others to escape the Bin and help rebuild Wa'Nabi's world. Lucy helps to save Emmet from Rex and destroy his time machine. Emmet comes to accept he will never be as skilled as Rex, and with this self-realization, Rex fades from existence, correcting a time paradox.

Finn and Bianca's mother sees them playing together, and lets them unpack their Lego toys. The Lego universe is recreated as a mish-mash of Apocalypseburg and the Systar System, renamed "Syspocalypstar". Emmet's home is rebuilt, and the film ends with Lucy gifting Emmet with the original album of "Everything Is Awesome", revealing that she co-originated the song, causing Emmet to gasp in shock.
