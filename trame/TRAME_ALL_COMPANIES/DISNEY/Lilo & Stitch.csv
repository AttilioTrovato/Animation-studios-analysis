On Kauaʻi, Hawaii, a young woman named Nani Pelekai works as a waitress. One day, a social worker expresses increasing concern whether Nani is able to take adequate care of her rambunctious, disobedient, and lonely younger sister, Lilo. Since Lilo has been ostracized by her hula classmates, Nani decides to let her adopt a dog. At an animal shelter, Lilo immediately takes a keen interest in """Experiment" "626""," a small blue sentient alien with unparalleled intelligence and strength, but also a propensity to cause chaos, who is impersonating a dog. In spite of Nani's doubts, Lilo calls 626 """Stitch""," and shows him around the island. Meanwhile, Dr. Jumba Jookiba, an extraterrestrial mad scientist who was arrested and put on trial by the Galactic Federation for illegal genetic experimentation, as evidenced by Stitch, and Agent Pleakley, the Council's Earth expert, got sent by their boss, the Grand Councilwoman, to capture Stitch. That evening, at the restaurant where Nani works, They try, but fail every time, to capture him. The indescribable chaos is blamed on Stitch, which results in Nani getting fired. The next day, Cobra warns her that unless she finds another job, he will have to place Lilo with a foster family. However, Stitch's antics, which occur in the course of his evasion of his two pursuers, persistently ruin Nani's chances of finding work. Nani's friend David invites her, Lilo, and Stitch to enjoy a day of surfing. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch ride a huge wave, Jumba makes one final effort to capture Stitch from underwater, causing Stitch to unintentionally pull Lilo underwater. They survive, but Cobra witnesses this event and tells Nani that, although she means well, Lilo has to be taken away unless Nani finds another job. Seeing how much trouble he has caused, Stitch runs off into the night. The next morning, the Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley from their assignment and gives it to the galaxy's oversized militant captain, Captain Gantu (incidentally freeing Jumba to pursue Stitch using less covert methods). Meanwhile, David informs Nani of a job opportunity, which she excitedly rushes off to pursue. Stitch, hiding in the nearby woods, encounters Jumba, who chases him back to Nani's house. A fight ensues which destroys the house; Cobra arrives to collect Lilo and take her away. As Nani and Cobra argue, Lilo runs away into the woods and finds Stitch, who reveals his alien identity just before they are captured by Gantu. Stitch manages to escape from Gantu's ship and is confronted by Nani. Before he can explain, Jumba and Pleakley capture Stitch themselves. Nani demands that they help her rescue Lilo, but Jumba insists they only came for Stitch. When Nani breaks down, Stitch reminds her about ʻohana, a term for """family""" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue Lilo. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani all board Jumba's personal spaceship and chase after Gantu, rescuing Lilo. Back on the shore, the Grand Councilwoman arrives on Earth preparing to take Stitch into custody and is forced to retire Gantu for putting Lilo in danger and blames Jumba for the mess. However, Lilo insists that because Stitch is her pet under local law, he cannot be taken away. The Grand Councilwoman is so impressed with Stitch's newfound civility and empathy that she goes against the prior decision of the Federation and decrees that Stitch will live in a peaceful exile on Earth. He will be entrusted to the care of Lilo and Nani, and the Councilwoman asks Cobra, who is revealed to be a former CIA agent that she previously met in 1973, to watch over them. Lilo, Nani, and their newfound friends rebuild their house, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Nani, Lilo, and Stitch's family, and they all build a new life together.
