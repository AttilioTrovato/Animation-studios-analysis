The Trolls are small, colorful creatures who live in an almost perpetual state of happiness, singing, dancing, hugging, and having fun all day. However, they are discovered by the Bergens, large, ugly, mean, and miserable creatures who can only feel happy by consuming a Troll. The Bergens imprison the trolls and eat them every year on a special occasion, called """Trollstice""." The Trolls, led by their king, King Peppy, with his infant daughter, Princess Poppy, escape through tunnels on the day of Trollstice when Prince Gristle Jr. was going to eat his first Troll. Enraged, Gristle Jr.â€™s father King Gristle Sr. banishes his Chef, who was in charge of preparing for Trollstice. Chef promises to leave and find the Trolls herself, while secretly plotting to overthrow the monarchy as revenge for her exile. Twenty years later, the now-adult Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the warnings of the over-cautious and egotistical gray troll, Branch (who has a secret crush on her), that loud parties will attract the Bergens. At the party, Branch's warnings come true when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Poppy's friends, including a """Zen""" troll named Creek, whom Poppy is in love with. Poppy decides on a rescue mission alone, as no other troll is willing to venture towards Bergen Town, and is later joined by Branch who saves her from a group of spiders. Once inside the Bergen king's castle, Poppy and Branch witness the now-King Gristle Jr. seemingly eat Creek, but Poppy remains hopeful that Creek survived. Poppy and Branch find the rest of the captured Trolls being guarded by a scullery maid named Bridget. Poppy discovers that Bridget is secretly in love with King Gristle Jr. and offers to help her get a date with the king while trying to confirm if Creek is alive. While setting Bridget up for the date with a musical number, Branch refuses to sing and triggers an argument with Poppy, revealing that, as a child, his grandmother was captured and got eaten while trying to save him, because his singing compromised his location to Chef, and that his guilt caused his color to turn from blue to gray. After Poppy comforts him with a hug, the trolls help Bridget, disguised under the name of """Lady" "Glittersparkles""," gets her date with Gristle Jr. at a roller rink and arcade restaurant and Gristle Jr. agrees for her to come to Trollstice. During this time, Poppy notices Creek being held captive inside the jewel adorning the king's mantle. Having helped Bridget, the Trolls attempt to rescue Creek from Gristle's room and steal his jewel but discover that it is empty. The Trolls are then captured by Chef, and Poppy gets shocked to discover that Creek sold them out to the Bergens to spare himself from being eaten. Creek lures out every troll from Troll Village (via Poppy's cowbell) and they are captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured, thrown into a pot and soon to be eaten, a heartbroken Poppy falls into despair and loses hope as she and all the other Trolls turn gray. Branch tries to sing """True" "Colors""" for Poppy to cheer her up, confessing his love for her. Poppy, after regaining her colors and realizing that she has fallen in love with Branch, returns his feelings, and they restore all the trolls' colors, including Branch's. Bridget saves the trolls, willing to sacrifice herself. Poppy can't bring herself to abandon Bridget and, with Branch and her friends, shows Gristle Jr. and the Bergens that Bridget is Lady Glittersparkles and that it is not necessary to eat Trolls to be happy, and they too, can find happiness within themselves. The vengeful Chef refuses to accept the peace and tries to kill the Trolls, but is knocked into a serving cart, set on fire, and sent rolling out of Bergen Town with Creek, who is still in her pouch. Both species celebrate, bringing new life to the town. Poppy is then declared queen of the Trolls, and Poppy and Branch share a friendly hug.
