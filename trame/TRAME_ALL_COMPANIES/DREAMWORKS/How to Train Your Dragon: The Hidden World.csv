One year after the events of the previous film, Hiccup, Toothless, and their fellow dragon-riders continue to rescue captured dragons in order to bring them to Berk and its bustling dragon and human utopia. Their efforts have resulted in the island becoming overpopulated with dragons. In response to the overcrowding, Hiccup desires to find the """Hidden" "World,""" a safe haven for dragons spoken of by his late father, Stoick. Meanwhile, a white female Fury dragon, held captive by warlords, is given to infamous dragon hunter Grimmel the Grisly as bait for him to capture Toothless for the warlords' use as an alpha. Toothless discovers the female Fury (that Astrid dubs a """Light" "Fury""[10])" in the woods, and the two become enchanted with each other until the Light Fury, sensing Hiccup's nearby presence, flees. Hiccup and Tuffnut later discover Grimmel's dragon traps in the area. Grimmel visits Hiccup that night, demanding he hand over Toothless, revealing that he's hunted and killed all the other Night Furies, but Hiccup has prepared an ambush for him; Grimmel escapes, burning down Hiccup's house and most of Berk with his six Deathgripper dragons in the process. In response, Hiccup rallies the citizens and dragons to leave Berk on a quest to find the Hidden World and safety from dragon hunters. Mid-journey, the Berkians discover an island on which they initially plan to rest for a short while, but soon begin to settle there, dubbing it """New" "Berk.""" Seeing Toothless's inability to fly solo hindering his growing relationship with the Light Fury, Hiccup rebuilds an automatic tail for him. Upon receiving the tail, Toothless flies off, meeting the Light Fury on his own and flying with her to an unknown land. Valka, on a scouting patrol, notices Grimmel's approaching army and quickly reports back to Hiccup. Hiccup and the dragon riders head to capture Grimmel; yet, they fall into his trap and barely escape. Ruffnut is captured but irritates Grimmel until he lets her go and secretly follows her to the Berkians' new location. Hiccup and Astrid, searching for Toothless, find the Hidden World and see Toothless and the Light Fury leading the dragons there as a happily mated couple. When the two are soon discovered, Toothless rescues Hiccup and Astrid and returns them to the Berkians, with Hiccup realizing his people would be intruders and unsafe in the Hidden World. Suddenly, Grimmel appears and captures Toothless and the Light Fury (who followed Toothless). Toothless's alpha status allows Grimmel to capture the rest of Berk's dragons by threatening to kill the Light Fury if any dragon or Berkian attacks. With Astrid's encouragement, Hiccup sets out with the dragon riders to stop Grimmel and his army. Gliding on wingsuits, they catch Grimmel's army off-guard, igniting a massive battle. Hiccup frees Toothless, resulting in two of Grimmel's Deathgrippers drowning, while Grimmel drugs the Light Fury into obeying him. Hiccup and Toothless give chase, with Toothless using his newly acquired ability to draw in lightning to kill the remaining Deathgrippers. Hiccup manages to jump onto the Light Fury, but Grimmel tranquilizes Toothless midair causing the dragon to fall helplessly. Hiccup, realizing he cannot rescue Toothless alone, frees the Light Fury and implores her to save Toothless. Hiccup is fully prepared to sacrifice himself in order to save Toothless as both he and Grimmel plummet toward the sea. The Light Fury, however, returns to save Hiccup as well. In the flash, Hiccup disconnects his prosthetic leg from himself, which Grimmel is holding on to, causing him to impact with the water and die, while the Light Fury grabs Hiccup and flies him to safety. Back on the island, both Toothless and Hiccup fully realize that dragons will never be safe in the human world. Hiccup tells Toothless it's time to return to The Hidden World, and he bids an emotional farewell to Toothless as all of the Berkians set their dragons free to live in the Hidden World. Toothless and the Light Fury lead the rest of the dragons away to their new home. Three months later, Hiccup and Astrid finally marry on New Berk. Years later, Toothless and the Light Fury are shown to have mated and have given birth to three dragon hatchlings named Night Lights. Hiccup, Astrid, and their two children sail across the sea and reunite with their dragons at the edge of the Hidden World. After introducing his children to his best friend, Hiccup takes their son flying on Toothless while Astrid and their daughter fly on Stormfly, accompanied by the Light Fury and their offspring. Hiccup vows that until humankind is ready to coexist peacefully with dragons, the dragons will stay hidden while the Berkians guard their secret.
