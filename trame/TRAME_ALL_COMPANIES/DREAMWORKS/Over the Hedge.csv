After RJ (Bruce Willis), a hungry raccoon, fails to get snacks from a vending machine, he becomes so desperate that he tries to raid a large food cache belonging to Vincent (Nick Nolte), a hibernating bear. However, while trying to finish by stealing a can of """Spuddies""" potato chips, he wakes Vincent and loses both the food and the wagon that it is on when a truck runs it over. Hastily, he promises to replace everything by the time Vincent reawakens in a week. Meanwhile, a group of forest animals, led by Verne (Garry Shandling) the turtle, emerge from hibernation to find their food cache nearly empty. They begin foraging but find a large hedge blocking their way. Verne investigates, discovering a human residential community that confuses and frightens him. RJ, who sees the entire commotion, convinces the other animals that it is easier to raid the humans' garbage for food rather than forage for it, and they manage to get enough food to keep them from starving. Verne, however, remains wary, especially after homeowner Gladys Sharp (Allison Janney) discovers the animals in her yard, chases them out through the hedge, and hires VermTech exterminator (or """Verminator"")" Dwayne LaFontant (Thomas Haden Church) to keep them out. Worried for his family's safety, Verne decides to return the food to the humans. RJ tries to stop him, resulting in an argument between the two. This attracts the attention of a playful Rottweiler named Nugent (Brian Stepanek), who chases them across several lawns before all of the food the animals gathered, as well as Gladys's car is destroyed. Verne gets into a fight with RJ and insults the others, causing them to turn against him. After RJ and Verne reconcile, they discover that Gladys has just restocked her pantry with a large food supply for an upcoming party and concoct a plan to get past the exterminator-planted boobytraps in her yard. Working together under cover of darkness, the animals get the food. RJ and Verne get into another argument, again over a can of """Spuddies""," during which Verne and the others learn of RJ's true motives. Gladys wakes up, discovers the animals in her house, and calls VermTech. Dwayne arrives and captures the animals except for RJ, who escapes with the food. RJ takes the food to a now-awake Vincent, but when the latter points out and praises RJ's treachery, the raccoon decides to sacrifice the food to save his friends. This angers Vincent, who chases RJ as he pursues Dwayne's truck. RJ pleads to be let in the truck as Vincent tries to catch him, but the others, angry at him for abandoning them, refuse before Verne finally convinces them otherwise. Vincent gets taken by giant balloons, the animals then subdue Dwayne, hijack his truck, and turn it toward home, but the truck goes out of control and demolishes Gladys' house. The animals hide in the hedge, trapped by Vincent (who comes down with a balloon) on one side and Dwayne and Gladys on the other. RJ and Verne get an idea to give Hammy (Steve Carell) the hyperactive squirrel his first caffeinated drink, which puts him into overdrive. Exceeding the speed of light, Hammy activates an illegal trap that Dwayne had installed (at Gladys' insistence, while warning her that it was illegal in every state except for Texas), capturing Vincent, Dwayne, and Gladys and destroying a satellite in the process. Gladys and Vincent are taken into custody by the police and animal control, respectively, while Dwayne tries to escape after taking advantage of Gladys' attempt at fighting a police officer and resisting arrest, only to encounter Nugent. Back in the forest, Verne tells RJ that if he had explained what he was trying to do in the first place, the others would have helped because """that's" what families "do,""" and welcomes him back to the family. The animals also find that while Hammy was in his caffeine-charged state, he had refilled their food cache with nuts to satisfy them for the year.
