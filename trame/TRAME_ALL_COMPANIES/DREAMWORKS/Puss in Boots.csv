Puss in Boots is an anthropomorphic talking cat, who is named for his signature pair of boots. A fugitive on the run from the law, Puss is seeking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack and Jill have the magic beans he has been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle. The castle holds valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a ruthless hitcat that was hired by Jack and Jill to kill him interrupts, and both fail. The hitcat turns out to be a female cat named Kitty Softpaws and is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a friendly talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs. The trio steals the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio rides the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror, a giant goose that guards the Golden Eggs. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a gosling, and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knocks Puss unconscious. When Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to San Ricardo where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty, who turns out to be the dangerous boss of Jack and Jill, to lure him home to be arrested, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty, who is working for Humpty, were involved in the con. After pleas from Imelda, his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero. While in prison, Puss meets the original Jack from """Jack" and the "Beanstalk""" from whom Humpty had stolen the beans from in the first place; he warns Puss that the Great Terror is in fact the Goose's mother, and she will stop at nothing to get her child back. Realizing Humpty intended to destroy the town all along, Puss requests that Kitty help him break out of prison and she also tells him she loves him. Tracking him down just as the Great Terror arrives, Puss convinces Humpty to help him fight off the Great Terror, saying he knows Humpty is a good person at heart. Using the Goose as bait, Puss and Humpty lure the Great Terror out of the town. During the chase, Jack and Jill betray Humpty and try to take the Goose, but get crushed by the Great Terror. Humpty and the Goose are knocked off a bridge with Puss holding onto them. Humpty knows Puss cannot hold both of them, so he lets go, sacrificing himself to save the Goose and the town. Humpty turns into a golden egg as he dies. The Great Terror then takes the Goose and Humpty back to the giant's castle. Though still considered a criminal by the law, Puss's efforts to save San Ricardo make him a hero once again among the townspeople and Imelda. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries, it turns out Humpty faked his death wearing a golden egg suit, and Puss and Kitty kiss.
