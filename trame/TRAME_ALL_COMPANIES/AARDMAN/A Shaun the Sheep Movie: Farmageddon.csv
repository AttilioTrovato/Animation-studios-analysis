In the town of Mossingham, Farmer John and his dog, Bingo, discover the landing of a UFO and flee from the alien who comes out of it. On Mossy Bottom Farm, Shaun and the flock attempt to pass time with several dangerous activities, only for Bitzer to stop them and ban their escapades completely. After being banned from having a barbecue for dinner, Shaun decides to order three pizzas, but when the pizzas arrive, both Bitzer—who intercepts two-thirds of the delivery—and the flock discover the pizza boxes are completely empty.

The next morning, Shaun discovers a trail of pizza crusts and encounters the alien. The visitor introduces herself as "Lu-La", an impish alien from the planet To-Pa with extraterrestrial powers, and she can mimic sounds. When Shaun introduces her to the flock, she causes mischief with a combine harvester, damaging it while transforming a field behind the farm house into unintentional crop circles. Taking advantage of the recent news of alien sightings, the Farmer deduces he can create an alien-based theme park, "Farmageddon", in which he can earn money to afford a new harvester.

The Ministry of Alien Detection's (M.A.D.) leader, Agent Red, who has been obsessed with proving the existence of aliens since seeing two of them as a child, investigates the UFO claims. After discovering the UFO has disappeared, both John and Bingo are arrested. Meanwhile, Lu-La and Shaun track down the UFO, which is revealed to have been made invisible earlier. The pair try to get the UFO started but they are unable to. Trying to recall how to start the spaceship and Shaun's query on a picture of her family, Lu-La transmits her memories to Shaun, revealing that she is actually a child and accidentally launched her parents' spaceship while playing on it. They also realize they need an egg-shaped sphere device to activate it. M.A.D. captures the spaceship with Shaun and Lu-La still on board and takes it to their headquarters.

At the base, Shaun and Lu-La slip out and manage to retrieve the device, while the others are distracted by Bitzer, who has been following Shaun and is mistaken as the alien due to the Farmer having dressed him as an alien. Shaun and Lu-La restart the ship and manage to escape with Bitzer, plotting a course for To-Pa; en route, Shaun ignores Bitzer's instructions not to touch anything on the ship and causes them to crash back to Earth. Seeing the UFO destroyed, Lu-La is left heartbroken and powerless. Feeling bad for what he has done, Shaun tries to find another way to get Lu-La home. He discovers that the device can be used to contact Lu-La's parents back on her planet, but requires a signal at a greater height. Shaun suggests that he and Lu-La attempt to reach the top of the Farmer's "Farmageddon" theme park signboard to make contact.

With the help of the flock and Bitzer, Shaun and Lu-La climb the sign while the Farmer launches a show at the theme park. Meanwhile, Red arrives and chases Shaun and Lu-La up the signboard using a robotic device. Delaying her from capturing the alien and eventually pushing her down, Shaun manages to send a distress message to To-Pa. Lu-La's parents, Ub-Do and Me-Ma, quickly arrive and reunite with their daughter. Red eventually welcomes the aliens, recognizing them as the aliens she saw as a child. Shaun, Bitzer and the flock bid the aliens farewell, while the "Farmageddon" theme park and show receive rave reviews as the entire incident is regarded as part of the theme park's show's 'special effects'. On their way back to To-Pa, the aliens discover the Farmer on their UFO, prompting them to take him back to Earth.

In a mid-credits scene the Farmer, now back on Earth, tries out his new harvester, whilst Bitzer and the flock play frisbee. The frisbee blows into the field where the Farmer is, entering the harvester, clogging the machinery, and destroying it by mistake, scaring Shaun, Bitzer, and Timmy.

In a post-credits scene, one of the M.A.D. agents reveals himself to be a clay version of Professor Brian Cox; he plays the song "Things Can Only Get Better" on an electric piano, only for Timmy, in his pyjamas, to come and unplug it, claiming it's too loud.
