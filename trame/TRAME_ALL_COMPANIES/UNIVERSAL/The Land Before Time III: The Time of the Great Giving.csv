A meteorite impacts near Great Valley, which causes a drought to threaten the dinosaurs' lives. The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the inhabitants of Great Valley, who have previously lived in relative peace and harmony. When the inter-species situation deteriorates, Littlefoot and the others set out to find water to keep the peace in Great Valley. They are pursued by a trio of arrogant teenage dinosaurs consisting of Hyp the Hypsilophodon, Mutt the Muttaburrasaurus, and Nod the Nodosaurus. When Littlefoot and the others find a small lake, the trio emerges and claims the waterhole for themselves, demanding that Littlefoot and the others keep silent about their discovery. Unwilling to comply, Littlefoot and the others flee from the bullies. During the pursuit, the bullies are chased away by a wasp, and the children discover the reason behind the blockage of the Great Valley's water source. Before they can return and tell the other inhabitants the truth, a lightning strike ignites a wildfire that spreads rapidly throughout Great Valley. The fire then devastates Great Valley destroying most of the green food. The dinosaurs barely make it to safety at the edge of Mysterious Beyond. When the children tell the adults of their discovery, disagreements about what to do erupts among the adults, preventing them from doing anything to utilize this knowledge. Hyp, Nod, and Mutt set out into Mysterious Beyond on their own to get to the water first. Anticipating the danger Hyp and his cohorts have gotten into and recognizing commonality with them, Littlefoot and the others follow to help if necessary. It becomes so when Hyp jumps into a tar pit after mistaking it for water. He screams for help, but Mutt and Nod do not save him. Instead, they argue about which one of them must save him. But Littlefoot cuts in, and tells Mutt and Nod that Hyp is stuck in the tar pit. Then, he hatches a plan to pull Hyp out. Finally, Littlefoot and the others pull him out of the tar. Soon afterwards, the adults appear in search of their children, and are finally united by the understanding that it was the unity of their children that helped them find water. Before they are able to take further steps, the herd is attacked by a pack of four velociraptors. The pursuit leads to a dam of boulders created by the rock slide that caused the drought. As the Sharpteeth and the adults battle, the children, including Hyp and his cronies, work together to break the dam. They all watch as the freed water washes away the Sharpteeth. The water also puts out the fires which are still burning in Great Valley. Finally, they manage to survive and land on the opposite bank. Now the herd is able to return to Great Valley. The herd returns to Great Valley, which now has enough water for them. However, when they return home, the fire has destroyed most of their green food. The now devastated plants in the valley are beyond repair from the fire. However, despite being irreparable, the dinosaurs find the spots in the valley where green food still grows. They proportionately move from one verdant area to another and share everything they find. This pattern results in the event being called the Time of the Great Giving.
