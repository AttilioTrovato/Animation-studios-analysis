Littlefoot has been having nightmares of Grandma Longneck falling to her death, which almost occurred during an earthquake, but Grandma Longneck luckily saved herself before she fell. Grandma Longneck comforts and teaches Littlefoot important life lessons called "Wisdoms". Later on, Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Spike, and Petrie meet three yellow-bellied dinosaurs, Loofah, Doofah, and Foobie. They have lost their way while traveling to distant Berry Valley. Loofah, Doofah, and Foobie seem to be too unintelligent to find their way back, so Littlefoot and the others decide to help their new friends whilst sharing Wisdoms along the way.

During the trip, Littlefoot and his friends have been pursued by a quartet of Sharpteeth, led by a Sharptooth with a scar that goes around his head. They made it to a Watering Hole and meet other yellow bellies. Earlier, Loofah mentioned a so-called "wise one" among the Yellow Bellies but Littlefoot cannot find no sign of him. Littlefoot begins to lead the Yellow Bellies across the Mysterious Beyond to reach the Berry Valley, however, Littlefoot has never been to Berry Valley and worries that he might make unwise decisions while he came to teach the Yellow Bellies how to be wise. His friends reassure him that he should trust in his feelings to let him know what to listen to.

As an intense storm occurs, Littlefoot leads the Yellow Bellies onto a plateau for shelter, but Doofah becomes separated from the group, going the wrong direction. Once the storm ends, Littlefoot and his friends were able to find her and she rejoins the group. The sharpteeth attack again, but they were able to defeat them when the Yellow Bellies bounced up and down. After the Sharpteeth were defeated, they finally made it to Berry Valley. Foobie is revealed to be the "Wise One" all along. Littlefoot and his friends reunite with their family and they return to the Great Valley.
