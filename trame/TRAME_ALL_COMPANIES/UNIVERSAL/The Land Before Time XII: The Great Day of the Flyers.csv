Petrie is having a difficult time preparing for "The Day of the Flyers", an important day for all of the flying residents of the Great Valley, when all of the young flyers must participate in a very precise flying exhibition to prove that they are ready to fly with the adults. Always a nervous flyer, Petrie has even more trouble flying with his siblings in precise group formations -- he's more of an independent, free-style flier. At the same time, a strange newcomer to the Great Valley has Littlefoot and his friends trying to help figure out just exactly what he is. Named Guido, a Feathered Flyer, he's the strangest looking creature any of the Great Valley creatures has ever seen, especially since he's covered with feathers, and has never seen another like himself. Cera is having her own troubles, as her grumpy father and his new mate, Tria, get ready to welcome a hatchling to the family. The hatchling's name is Tricia and Cera begins to slowly bond with her new sister.

All of these issues come together on the night before "The Day of the Flyers," when Guido starts to figure out what he is. Guido begins sleep walking and Petrie and his friends follow him, inadvertently leading all of the gang on a perilous adventure into the Mysterious Beyond. They also discovered that Guido can glide during the adventure. In the Mysterious Beyond, Guido wakes up from sleep walking and accidentally wakes up a Spinosaurus which gives chase and tried to eat them. But Petrie, Guido, and the others defeat the Spinosaurus and they returned to the Great Valley.

As "The Day of the Flyers" arrived, Petrie and his siblings begin to participate. Following Guido's advice to be himself, Petrie's uniqueness ends up being the "key" to completing the day, changing the Great Day of the Flyers forever. Tricia was watching and following the flyers when she falls into a river and was carrying her straight to the waterfall. Guido, Petrie, and Petrie's siblings rescued Tricia just in time but they accidentally dropped Tricia. Cera saved her before she lands in the river again. She even said her first words, which is "Cera". The film ends with Cera and her family loving on Tricia while the other Dinosaurs watch in awe.
