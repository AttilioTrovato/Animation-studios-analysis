12-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a walled city where everything is artificial, with no living plants "(""Thneedville"")." Ted has a crush on environmentalist Audrey, and decides to impress her with a “real tree”. His Grammy Norma tells him the legend of the Once-ler, who knows what happened to the trees. Leaving Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, Ted discovers that the outside world is a barren, contaminated wasteland. He finds the Once-ler, who agrees to tell him the story of the trees over multiple visits. Returning home, Ted encounters Thneedville's greedy mayor, Aloysius O'Hare, whose company sells bottled oxygen to the polluted city. Explaining that trees, and the oxygen they produce freely, pose a threat to his business, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town, but Ted continues to visit the Once-ler. The Once-ler recounts how, as a young inventor, he arrived in a lush forest of animals and Truffula trees "(""This" is The "Place"")." Cutting down a tree, he was confronted by the Lorax, the guardian of the forest who “speaks for the trees”. After attempting to force the Once-ler out, the Lorax convinces him not to harm any more trees. Using the Truffula tree, the Once-ler created the “Thneed”, a piece of cloth with multiple uses, which became a major success "(""Everybody" Needs a "Thneed"")." His lazy relatives persuaded him to resume chopping down trees to mass-produce Thneeds, leading to enormous profits but deforestation and pollution "(""How" Bad Can I "Be?"")." After harvesting the last Truffula tree, the Once-ler was ruined, abandoned by his family, and became a recluse. The Once-ler was left heartbroken and unbearably guilty for destroying the forest. With the region uninhabitable, the Lorax sent the animals away to find a new place to live and disappeared into the sky, leaving a single word on a pile of rocks: """Unless""." The Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes he can regrow the forest and make others care about trees. Ted returns home to plant the seed, which is spotted by O'Hare’s city-wide surveillance. Enlisting the help of Audrey and his family, Ted is pursued by O’Hare to the center of town. O’Hare rallies the citizens against Ted, telling them that trees are dangerous and filthy, but Ted uses an earthmover to knock down a section of the city wall, revealing the environmental destruction outside. Inspired by Ted’s conviction, the crowd turns on O’Hare, and the seed is finally planted "(""Let" It "Grow"")." Time passes and the land begins to recover; new trees sprout, animals return, and the now-elderly Once-ler reunites with the Lorax. The film ends with a quote from Dr. Seuss: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.”
