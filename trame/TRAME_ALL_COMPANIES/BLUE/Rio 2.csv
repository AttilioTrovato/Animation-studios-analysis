Spix's Macaws Blu and Jewel and their three children—Bia, Carla, and Tiago—are living happily in the city but Jewel is disappointed to see her children becoming too domesticated like their father. Meanwhile, Blu's former owner, Linda Gunderson and her ornithologist husband, Tulio are on an expedition in the Amazon and, after a fall down a waterfall, discover a quick-flying Spix's macaw that loses one of its feathers. When word gets out about this through television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along. Blu brings a fanny pack full of supplies, including a GPS, much to Jewel's chagrin. Meanwhile, the leader of a group in a line of illegal logging named Big Boss, discovers Linda and Tulio's expedition to find the macaws and orders his henchmen to hunt them down to avoid disruptions to their work. At the same time, the evil cockatoo Nigel seeks revenge against Blu for crippling his ability to fly, and makes several failed attempts to kill Blu along with his new lackeys, an anteater named Charlie and a poisonous frog named Gabi, who is in love with Nigel. Blu, his family, and their friends, Rafael the toucan, Pedro the cardinal, and Nico the canary, use a boat to get to the jungle. When they arrive, they initially find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in an uncharted section of the Amazon. There, they meet Jewel's stern long-lost father, Eduardo, Jewel's paternal aunt Mimi, and Jewel's childhood friend, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu, but expresses gratitude to him over bringing Jewel back home. Having lost their previous habitat to arson from the illegal loggers, Eduardo is incredibly anti-human, and angrily brushes off Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection. At the same time, Blu is intimidated by the suave Roberto, who quickly bonds with Blu's kids. While searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually captured by the loggers. Meanwhile, Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, as his family are doing, but his continued reliance on human tools prevent him from connecting with anyone. Meanwhile, in another attempt to get closer to Blu, Nigel successfully wins a talent show to become a performer for a Carnival show that Rafael, Pedro, Nico and Blu's daughter Carla are hosting. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the scarlet macaws, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally swats Felipe with a branch. The war turns out to be just like football (soccer), and Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory when he scores an own goal. Blu flies off, upset over his failures despite his best intentions and efforts. Regardless of the difficulties, Blu decides that he will leave his human roots behind him if it means building a future with his family. He visits Linda and Tulio's campsite to drop off his fanny pack, but discovers that it had been raided. Roberto accuses Blu of betraying the flock, but before Blu can defend himself, loggers storm the area. Roberto, unable to deal with real danger, panics and Blu is forced to save him from an oncoming bulldozer. Blu immediately steps up and orders Roberto to warn the flock while he goes to rescue Linda and Tulio. After doing so, Blu persuades the macaws to defend their homes instead of running away. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, they're able to successfully disable the loggers' machinery. Big Boss tries to blow up the trees instead, but Blu steals the lit dynamite and takes it into the sky where it detonates harmlessly. Big Boss runs off before Linda and Tulio can stop him, and winds up getting away. Nigel then attacks Blu in a final attempt to get revenge, but Gabi, while attempting to help, accidentally hits Nigel with one of Charlie's pines filled with her poison; Nigel gives a theatrical death speech before seemingly dying, and Gabi then drinks her own poison to die alongside Nigel. However, the highly intelligent Bia realizes that Gabi isn't poisonous at all, and an overjoyed Gabi lovingly smothers a dismayed Nigel and drags him away. With the flock now under Linda and Tulio's protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids, though still agreeing to visit Rio in the summer. Eduardo finally drops his anti-human stance by wearing a fannypack of his own, and proudly accepts Blu into the flock. Nigel and Gabi are sent to Rio for study, Nico and Pedro's Carnival show goes on, and Luiz the bulldog arrives at the Amazon for a visit.
