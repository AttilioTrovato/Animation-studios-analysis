In Spain, a friendly, non-violent, flower-loving calf named Ferdinand (Colin H. Murphy) lives on Casa del Toro, a ranch that raises and trains bulls for bullfighting. Not willing to be raised as a violent bull that will one day be forced to fight against matadors in the bull ring, Ferdinand runs away from Casa del Toro after being ridiculed by Bones (Nile Diaz), Guapo (Jet Jurgensmeyer), and Valiente (Jack Gore), his father Raf (Jeremy Sisto) fails to return from a bullfight, and his flower got squished by Valiente and his father (Bobby Cannavale). He arrives at a peaceful farm run by a florist named Juan (Juanes) and bonds with his daughter Nina (Julia Scarpa Saldanha), much to his dog Paco's (Jerrod Carmichael) jealousy. Ferdinand lives happily on Juan's farm, where he spends every day smelling flowers and relaxing in the shade of trees until he grows up into an enormous bull. One day when Ferdinand (John Cena) is all grown up, Ferdinand is left alone when Juan, Nina (Lily Day) and Paco go to Ronda for an annual flower festival. Ferdinand follows anyway, but is stung by a bee on the butt and unintentionally causes chaos around town. Believed to be an aggressive, violent, short-tempered bull, Ferdinand taken to back Casa del Toro, saddening Nina. Ferdinand reunites with his childhood bullies, Bones (Anthony Anderson), Guapo (Peyton Manning) and Valiente (Bobby Cannavale) and discovers that they’re all grown up and are joined by two new bulls named Angus (David Tennant) and Maquina (Tim Nordquist). Still ridiculed by Bones, Guapo, and Valiente, Ferdinand befriends Lupe (Kate McKinnon), a goat who wants to coach him in bullfighting, and a trio of hedgehogs named Una (Gina Rodriguez), Dos (Daveed Diggs), and Cuatro (Gabriel Iglesias). Legendary bullfighter El Primero (Miguel Ángel Silvestre) arrives to choose the biggest, strongest, most aggressive bull to fight before he retires. Failing to impress the matador, the bulls turn on Ferdinand for making them look bad and blocking the entrance to the ring. Guapo is taken to a slaughterhouse, which Valiente and Bones tell Ferdinand will be their fate if they are not chosen for a bullfight. Ferdinand earns the bulls’ respect except Valiente after a dance-off with German horses (Flula Borg, Boris Kodjoe, and Sally Phillips), but they still believe fighting is their only way to survive. Ferdinand convinces Lupe to escape with him to Nina's farm, aided by the hedgehogs. Close to freedom, Ferdinand sees his father’s horns mounted on a wall with dozens of others, and realizes that every bull chosen to fight is slain by the matador. Ferdinand warns the other bulls, but Valiente is unconvinced and charges him outside. Primero witnesses Valiente making Ferdinand inadvertently defeat Valiente by breaking off his horn, and chooses Ferdinand to fight. When Valiente is taken to the slaughterhouse, Ferdinand rallies the remaining bulls to escape, and goes to the slaughterhouse to rescue him. They discover Guapo is still alive, and Ferdinand questions Valiente's courage after he refuses to help rescue him. Ferdinand's tail accidentally activates a series of deadly contraptions, but escapes with Valiente's help. The bulls, hedgehogs and Lupe steal Casa del Toro's truck, and escape the ranch’s owner, Moreno (Raúl Esparza), and his employees. The animals arrive at Atocha train station in Madrid. When the bulls push a small railroad cart to catch the train back to Nina's home, Ferdinand sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Lupe stays behind as Ferdinand is captured. News of the runaway bulls causing chaos around town, Ferdinand's upcoming fight with Primero reaches Nina, and she and Juan set out to rescue the bull. At Las Ventas arena, Lupe urges Ferdinand to fight in order to survive, but Ferdinand is silently unsure. Released into the ring, he gives a weak performance and accidentally sends El Primero flying into the bull pen. Primero attacks Ferdinand with banderillas, scratching him in the shoulder. Ferdinand almost retaliates, but sees a carnation crushed under his hoof; unwilling to resort to violence, he lets Primero live. Ferdinand resigns himself to being slain by the matador, but the crowd cries out for him to live. Primero spares Ferdinand and leaves with dignity, and Ferdinand is reunited with Nina, as the crowd throws carnations into the ring to praise the bull. The other animals arrive and witness him making history as the first bull ever to leave a bullfight alive by being himself. Ferdinand returns home with Nina, Juan and Paco, joined by Lupe, the three hedgehogs, and the rest of the bulls. During the credits, the hedgehogs are shocked that their brother Tres is still alive.
