In a world populated by sentient robots, Rodney Copperbottom is an aspiring young inventor who idolizes Bigweld, a famous inventor, entrepreneur, and philanthropist whose company provides robots with spare parts. Following Bigweld's example to """see" a need, fill a "need""," Rodney invents Wonderbot to assist his dishwasher father Herb. When Herb's supervisor confronts them, Wonderbot malfunctions and wreaks havoc in the kitchen, leaving Herb in debt. To help Herb pay for the damages, Rodney decides to move to Robot City, hoping to present Wonderbot to Bigweld Industries in order to get a job there. Upon arrival at Robot City, Rodney is ejected from Bigweld Industries by the company's current head Phineas T. Ratchet, whom in Bigweld's absence has stopped producing spare parts in favor of expensive """Upgrades""," thereby """outmoding""" robots who are unable or unwilling to pay for them. Ratchet's mother, Madame Gasket, runs the Chop Shop, an integrated metal producer that collects scrap and spare parts (and sometimes outmoded robots) and melts them to create ingots for Upgrades. Rodney stumbles upon ne'er-do-well Fender Pinwheeler (whom he met at the train station), who takes him in to a boarding home populated by other outmodes, known collectively as the """Rusties""." Word of Rodney's mechanical prowess spreads, and he is hailed as a local hero after he and the Rusties fix outmodes throughout the neighborhood, although they are eventually unable to cope with the demand due to the spare part shortage. Hoping to enlist Bigweld's help, Rodney and Fender infiltrate the Bigweld Ball – where Bigweld is reputed to make an appearance – only for Ratchet to announce that Bigweld will not attend. Enraged, Rodney publicly berates Ratchet, who orders his security team to eliminate him. Cappy, a Bigweld Industries executive opposed to Ratchet's plans, rescues Rodney and Fender. Fender is captured by a Sweeper, a vehicle that collects scrap metal and outmodes for the Chop Shop, and taken to the Chop Shop, where he discovers Gasket and Ratchet's plan to use a heavily-armed fleet of Super-Sweepers to destroy all outmodes throughout the city in order to make them into more upgrades, and escapes. Meanwhile, Rodney and Cappy fly to Bigweld's mansion, where Rodney confronts Bigweld, imploring him to return to Bigweld Industries. A disgruntled Bigweld reveals that Ratchet's greed and business sense won over his idealism in the management of Bigweld Industries, and orders Rodney and Cappy to leave. Crushed, Rodney calls his parents and prepares to return to Rivet Town but Herb encourages Rodney to pursue his dreams and fight for it or he will spend the rest of his life regretting it like Herb did. Fender returns and reveals Gasket and Ratchet's plot. Rodney rallies Cappy and the Rusties to stop them, and they are soon joined by Bigweld, having regained his resolve after realizing how much he and his ideals meant to Rodney. The group returns to Bigweld Industries where Bigweld fires Ratchet, but Ratchet knocks him unconscious, planning on melting him down as well. Rodney, Cappy, and Wonderbot rescue Bigweld from Ratchet and escape with the Rusties in a security vehicle with Ratchet close behind. Rodney unclips Ratchet’s vehicle to break free but their vehicle loses control in front of the Chop Shop and Bigweld is rolled inside. Undetermined to give up, Rodney upgrades the Rusties to rescue Bigweld. Rodney, Cappy and the Rusties battle Gasket and her army of Super Sweepers alongside an army of outmodes that Rodney had repaired earlier. Gasket is burned and destroyed when she falls into her own furnace, while Rodney and Bigweld immobilize the Super-Sweepers and defeat Ratchet (who tries to escape on a cable but bumps into the roof and loses all of his upgraded parts.) His father tries to comfort him with Bigweld's inspirational motto, but Ratchet cuts him off, growling """Oh," just "STOP!""." Taking control of Bigweld Industries once again, Bigweld promises to make spare parts available to everyone. Later, Bigweld holds a public ceremony in Rivet Town, where he nominates Rodney as his new second-in-command and eventual successor. Rodney provides Herb with new replacement parts and a flugelhorn-like instrument to fulfill his dream of being a musician. After a shaky start, Herb leads Rodney, Cappy, the Rusties, Bigweld and the townspeople in a rousing rendition of """Get" Up Offa That "Thing""."
