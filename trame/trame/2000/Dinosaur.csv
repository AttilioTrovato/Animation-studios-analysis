In the nesting grounds by the valley, a Carnotaurus triggers a stampede after being discovered by a young Parasaurolophus. An Iguanodon mother is forced to abandon her nest which is trampled by the pursuing predator and it kills a Pachyrhinosaurus. The only surviving egg is snatched by an Oviraptor, a Koolasuchus, passing two Talaruruses, and snatched by a Pteranodon, and journeying on through several terrains, dinosaurs and Ichthyornises and landing on an island populated by lemurs. Plio; the daughter of their patriarch Yar, names the hatched baby Aladar and raises him despite Yar's initial objections. Years later, a fully grown Aladar and the lemurs take part in a mating ritual, where his friend; Zini (Yar's younger brother) is unable to achieve a mate. Moments after the ritual ends, they are interrupted by a meteor shower and a gigantic meteoroid crashing into the Earth. The explosive blast wave destroys the island and annihilates nearly all the lemurs. Aladar, along with Plio, Yar, Zini and Plio's son Suri, manage to survive by leaping into the sea towards the mainland. They look back at their ruined home and mourn for the loss of their loved ones before deciding to move on. While crossing deserted wastelands, the group are attacked by a pack of Velociraptors. After escaping from them, the family encounter a massive herd of dinosaurs led by Iguanodons; Kron the leader and his lieutenant, Bruton (the other species in the herd are parasaurolophus, styracosaurus, struthiomimus, homalocepale, braciosaurus, and ankylosaurus). The herd are on a journey to the """Nesting" "Grounds""" a sanctuary left untouched by the devastation of the meteor. After the herd rest for the night, Aladar and the lemurs befriend Baylene, an elderly Brachiosaurus; her friend Eema, a Styracosaurus; and Url, her dog-like pet Ankylosaurus. The next morning, the herd reach a seemingly dried lake which they have relied on in the past. Kron orders the herd to move on until Aladar and his friends discover water trapped under the surface, saving the herd from dehydration. Kron's sister Neera, impressed by Aladar's compassion, begins to grow closer to him. Meanwhile, two Carnotaurus have been following the herd's tracks for days and begin stalking them for food. Bruton and a scout search for water in a canyon, but are ambushed and attacked by the Carnotaurs. An injured Bruton manages to escape and warns Kron about the predators, panicking the entire herd. Kron picks up the pace and evacuates the herd, leaving Aladar, the lemurs and the elderly dinosaurs behind while the Carnotaurs are in pursuit some distance away. During a thunder and a rainstorm, the group encounter Bruton who was left behind by Kron, before taking shelter in a cave. Shortly after, the Carnotaurus enter the cave and attack the group, but Bruton sacrifices himself by causing a cave in which kills one of them. The surviving Carnotaur leaves the cave swearing vengeance for its dead companion. Aladar and his friends escape and venture deeper, but reach a dead end. Refusing to admit defeat, Baylene uses her weight to smash through the wall of boulders, revealing the Nesting Grounds on the other side. While exploring, Eema finds a large wall of boulders blocking the original entrance to the valley. Realizing that the herd will never make it over, Aladar rushes off alone to rescue them, although he is pursued by the Carnotaurus along the way. Aladar soon catches up with Kron, Neera, and the herd, suggesting a safer way to the valley, but Kron selfishly refuses. Kron loses his temper and fights Aladar, but Neera comes to the latter's aid. The herd eventually turns against Kron and abandons him, deciding to let Aladar lead them to the Nesting Grounds instead. As they prepare to leave, Aladar, Neera, and the herd find themselves cornered by the enraged Carnotaurus. Aladar rallies Neera and the herd to stand together and they drive the predator back. The Carnotaurus then chases after Kron, who attempts to climb over the cliff himself. When Kron reaches a sheer drop, he realizes that Aladar was right and tries to defend himself against the Carnotaurus but is fatally wounded. As it prepares to finish Kron off, Neera saves her brother but is quickly overwhelmed. Aladar then fights the Carnotaurus until the cliff underneath breaks apart, sending the predator plummeting to its death. Kron then dies from his wounds. Now as their new leader, Aladar and Neera lead the herd to the Nesting Grounds. Sometime later, a new breed of dinosaurs hatch, among them are Aladar and Neera's children. The lemurs find more of their kind and the group all begin a new life together in their new home.
