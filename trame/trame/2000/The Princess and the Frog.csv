In 1912 New Orleans, a girl named Tiana and her friend Charlotte La Bouff listen to Tiana's mother read the story of The Frog Prince.[5] Charlotte, being a believer of true love, finds the story to be romantic, while Tiana proclaims she will never kiss a frog. Fourteen years later (in 1926), Tiana has grown into an aspiring young chef who works as a waitress for two local diners, so she can save enough money to start her own restaurant, a dream she shared with her father, who is implied to have died in World War I. Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in New Orleans to better his financial situation. After being cut off by his parents for being a philanderer and spendthrift, Naveen intends to marry a rich southern belle, and Charlotte is the perfect candidate. Eli """Big" "Daddy""" La Bouff, a rich sugar baron and Charlotte's father, is hosting a masquerade ball in Naveen's honor. Charlotte hires Tiana to make beignets for the ball, giving her enough money to buy an old sugar mill to convert into her restaurant. Meanwhile, Naveen and his valet, Lawrence, meet a voodoo witch doctor named Doctor Facilier. Inviting them into his emporium, Facilier convinces them that he can make their dreams come true, but neither man gets what they are expecting - Naveen is transformed into a frog while Lawrence is given a voodoo talisman that gives him Naveen's appearance. Facilier intends for the transformed Lawrence to marry Charlotte, after which he will kill La Bouff and split his fortune with Lawrence (while secretly giving himself the larger sum). At the ball, Tiana discovers she may lose the mill to a higher bidder (though itâ€™s possible the building was being withheld from her due to her race). Tiana then meets Naveen who, believing her to be a princess because of her costume, asks her to kiss him and break Facilier's spell. In exchange for the money needed, Tiana reluctantly accepts, but since she's not an actual princess she is turned into a frog herself when she kisses Naveen, which also gives her the ability to talk to other animals. A chase ensues and Tiana and Naveen escape to a bayou. In the bayou Tiana and Naveen meet a trumpet-playing alligator named Louis, who dreams of playing in a band with humans, but his ferocious appearance as an alligator prevents him from doing so. They also meet a Cajun firefly named Ray. Ray believes that the Evening Star is another firefly named """Evangeline,""" and is deeply in love with her, but no one has the heart to tell him otherwise. Louis and Ray offer to lead Tiana and Naveen to a voodoo queen Mama Odie who they believe can undo the curse. During the journey, Tiana and Naveen develop feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Facilier makes a deal with the voodoo spirits (his """friends" on the other "side"")," offering them the souls of the (wayward) people of New Orleans; in exchange, the spirits grant Facilier the services of a host of shadow demons, whom he orders to find and capture Naveen. When the four find Mama Odie after escaping from several of the demons and a trio of bumbling frog hunters she tells them that Naveen must kiss a true princess in order to break the spell, but Tiana misinterprets Mama Odie's advice for her as needing to work harder. They return to New Orleans to find Charlotte, who is the princess of the Mardi Gras Parade, but only until midnight. Naveen tells Ray he loves Tiana and is willing to give up his dreams for her but before he can tell her he is captured by the demons and brought to Facilier. After Ray tells Tiana that Naveen loves her, Tiana goes to the parade to confess her for Naveen, only to find Lawrence (still masquerading as Naveen) marrying Charlotte and she flees, heartbroken. Ray rescues the real Naveen and steals the charm that disguises Lawrence, then finds Tiana and gives her the charm, explaining the deception. He then turns to hold off the demons so she can escape, but is mortally wounded by Facilier in the process. Facilier then offers to make Tiana's restaurant dream come true in exchange for the talisman. Realizing she would rather be with Naveen, and recognizing Facilier's true intentions, Tiana attempts to destroy the talisman. Facilier's shadow stops her but she gets it back and smashes it. With Facilier's plan foiled, Tiana watches in horror as the angered voodoo spirits drag Facilier and his shadow into the voodoo spirit world for his debts to them, with his frightened expression being placed on a tombstone. As Lawrence is taken away by the police, Naveen explains everything to Charlotte; Tiana and Naveen reveal their love to each other. Charlotte agrees to kiss Naveen so he and Tiana can be together as people. The clock strikes midnight when she makes an attempt, but the couple decide they are content to live together as frogs. Ray dies shortly after and during his funeral, where his family places his body on a leaf and sends it floating down the river, a beam of light shines down and a new star appears next to Evangeline. Tiana and Naveen are married by Mama Odie and, because of Tiana's new status as a princess, they are both restored to human form after their kiss. Later the couple returns to New Orleans to legally marry and celebrate, and together they open their new restaurant, with Louis playing in the band.
