Mapping between WordNet Domains and Wikipedia categories


** WordNet-Domains - WordNet topics

Starting from version 3.0, Princeton WordNet has associated topic information with a subset of its synsets. This topic labeling is achieved through pointers from a source synset to a target synset representing the topic, and it was developed independently from WordNet-Domains.

The file "mapping-WN-domains-WN-topics.csv” contains this mapping.


** WordNet-Domains - Multilingual Wikipedia categories


The file "crossLanguage_Wiki-category_mappings_WN-domains.csv” contains this mapping.
