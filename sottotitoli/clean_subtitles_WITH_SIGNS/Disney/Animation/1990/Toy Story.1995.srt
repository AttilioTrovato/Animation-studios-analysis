All right, everyone!
This... is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!
Now, empty that safe!
Money, money, money!
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!
Help! Baal
Help us!
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!
Reach for the sky!
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!
I'm here to stop you,
OneEyed Bart.
How'd you know it was me?
Are you gonna come quietly?
You can't touch me, Sheriff!
I brought my attack dog
with the builtin force field.
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats forcefield dogs.
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.
You saved the day again, Woody.
You're my favorite deputy.
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed
Round 'em up, cowboy!
Just remember
what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeehaw!
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
Hey, cowboy!
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am
Big and stronger too
Come on, Woody.
Maybe
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do
It's me and you, boy
And as the years go by
Whoa! Whoa!
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see
It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
All right!
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
Score!
You got a friend in me
Wow! Cool!
What do you think?
Oh, this looks great, Mom!
Okay, birthday boy...
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!
I hope I have enough places.
Wow, look at that! That's so...
One, two... Four.
Oh, my gosh, you got...
Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
Could we leave this up 'til we move?
Well, sure! We can leave it up.
Yeah!
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.
Okay. It's party time, Woody.
Yeehaw!
Howdy, little lady.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole. 
Come on, Molly.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
See you later, Woody.
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be babysitting Princess Drool.
Hey, Hamm.
Look, I'm Picasso!
I don't get it.
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?
Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir! No, sir!
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.
Hey, uh, Slinky?
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.
No. Slink...
Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
Bad news?
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.
Got it.
Be happy!
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.
Hey.
Hey, Etch. Draw!
Oh! Got me again.
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.
Now, where is that... Oh.
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?
How're you doin', Rex?
Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared
that time.
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?
Oh, yeah!
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.
Yodelayheehoo!
Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.
Hey, Woody, come on.
Oh, thanks, Mike.
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.
For crying out loud.
Thank you.
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.
Okay. First item today...
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?
What?
Moving buddy? You can't be serious.
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.
Do we have to hold hands?
You guys think this is a big joke.
We've only got one week
left before the move.
! don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.
If you don't have one, get one!
All right, next. Oh, yes.
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting
was, I think, a big success.
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.
Thank you, Mr. Spell.
You're welcome.
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today. 
Wait a minute here!
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.
This is Andy
we're talking about.
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.
That's what we're made for, right?
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!
Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Stay calm, everyone!
Hey!
Meeting adjourned.
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?
I can't see a thing.
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.
Any dinosaurshaped ones?
Oh, for crying out loud.
They're all in boxes, you idiot.
They're getting bigger.
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.
Hi!
Spell, trash can.
We're doomed!
All right! All right!
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Okay! Save your batteries.
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!
You know what to do.
Yes, sir!
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!
Yeah!
Okay, come on, kids.
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
All right, gangway, gangway.
And this is how we find out
what is in those presents.
Okay, who's hungry?
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!
What in the world... Oh!
I thought I told him
to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.
Go on without me!
Just go!
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.
Okay, everybody, come on.
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?
Mine!
There they are.
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird.
All right, Andy's opening
the first present now.
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!
Hey, I can dream, can't I?
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.
It's a... If's...
It's a... a lunch box.
We've got a lunch box here.
A lunch box?
Lunch box?
For lunch.
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...
Okay, it's bed sheets.
Who invited that kid?
Oh! Only one left.
Okay, we're on the last present now.
Last present!
It's a big one. It's a...
It's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
Whew!
Hallelujah!
Yeah! All right!
Hey, watch it!
Sorry there, old spud head.
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.
Wait a minute. Oh!
What do we have here?
Wait! Turn that thing back on!
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.
Mom, what is it?
It's a huge package.
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.
It's a...
Wow!
It's a what? What is it?
Oh, no!
Oh, ya big lizard!
Now we'll never know what it is!
Way to go, Rex!
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!
Let's go to my room, guys!
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!
There!
Juvenile intrusion!
Repeat, resume
your positions now!
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!
Get to your places!
Get to your places!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!
We've got prizes!
What is it?
Can you see it?
What the heck is up there?
Woody, who's up there with ya?
Woody?
What are you doing under the bed?
Nothin'. Nothin'.
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.
Have you been replaced?
What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there
a nice, big
Andy'sroom welcome.
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?
Why don't they answer? My ship!
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4072.
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.
I've crashlanded
on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
And also, there has been
a bit of a mixup.
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.
My ship has crashlanded here
by mistake.
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?
Well, let's see. We got doubleA's.
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.
Do you know these lifeforms?
Yes! They're Andy's toys.
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!
Whwhy, thank you!
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!
Say, what's that button do?
I'll show you.
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.
Only it's...
Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.
Probably all copper wiring, huh?
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit
of the Space Ranger Corps,
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.
I'm actually from a smaller company
that was purchased
in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.
Well, sure. Look at him.
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss Army knife.
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
What's with him?
Laser envy.
All right, that's enough!
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.
Toy?
TOY. Toy! 
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?
Mr. Lightyear, now, I'm curious.
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger!
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!
Excuse me.
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!
They are a terilliumcarbonic alloy,
and I can fly.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
You can't.
Can.
Can't. Can't. Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!
Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
All right, then, I will.
Stand back, everyone!
To infinity and beyond!
Can!
Whoal!
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!
I found my movin' buddy.
Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?
Golly bob howdy!
Oh, shut up!
You know, in a couple of days,
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.
They'll see.
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
I was on top of the world
livin' high
It was right in my pocket
! was livin" the life
Things were just the way
they should be
When from out of the sky
like a bomb
Comes some little punk
in a rocket
Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
Strange
Things are happening to me
Strange
Things
Strange things are happening to me
Ain't no doubt about it
! had friends
! had lots of friends
Now all my friends are gone
And I'm doin' the best I can
To carry on
had power
Power
I was respected
Respected
But not anymore
And I've lost the love of the one
Whom I adore
Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange
Things are happenin'to me
Strange
Things
Strange
Things are happenin'to me
Ain't no doubt about it
Strange
Things
Strange
Things
Finally!
Hey, who's got my hat?
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Gimme that!
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.
Wow!
With permanent ink too!
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.
Don't let it get to you, Woody.
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.
Yeah, like the attic.
All right, that's it!
Unidirectional bonding strip.
Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
And another thing,
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?
Don't even think about it, cowboy.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?
The air isn't... toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me,
aren't you?
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!
Where?
Yes!
It's Sid!
Don't move!
I thought he was at summer camp.
They must've kicked him out
early this year.
Oh, no, not Sid!
Incoming!
Who is it this time?
I... I can't... I can't tell.
Hey, where's Lenny?
Right here, Woody.
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?
That's why, Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellow.
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.
That is Sid.
You mean that happy child?
That ain't no happy child.
He tortures toys, just for fun!
Well, then we've got
to do something.
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
Yeah, sure. You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes! He's gone! He's history!
I could've stopped him.
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.
The sooner we move, the better.
Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
All this packing
makes me hungry.
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring one toy.
Just one?
One toy?
Will Andy pick me?
"Don't count on it"?
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!
Trouble? Where?
Down there. Just down there.
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose.
I don't see anything!
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!
What kind of toy...
Buzz!
Buzz!
I don't see him in the driveway.
I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
Oh! Buzz!
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?
He's saying that this was no accident.
What do you mean?
I mean HumptyDumpty was pushed...
No!
By Woody!
What?
Wait a minute.
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you backstabbing murderer!
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!
You don't deserve to... Hey!
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.
So you got rid of him.
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?
I don't think we should
give him the chance.
There he is, men. Frag him!
Let's string him up
by his pull string!
I got dibs on his hat!
Would you boys stop it!
Tackle him!
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?
No, I haven't seen him.
Andy, I'm heading out the door!
But, Mom, I can't find him!
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!
Oh, okay.
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!
Oh, where could he be?
Can I help pump the gas?
Sure! I'll even let you drive.
Yeah?
Yeah, when you're 16.
Funny, Mom.
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.
Huh? Right? Buddy?
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.
Oh. Well, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.
Okay, come on!
You want a piece of me?
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
Next stop.
Pizza Planet! Yeah!
Andy!
Wh... Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
Oh, I'm a lost toy!
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.
Youl
According to my navicomputer, the...
Shut up!
Just shut up, you idiot!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship
and taken away everything
that was important to me...
Don't talk to me
about importance!
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What? What are
you talkin' about?
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg
has been secretly building
a weapon
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.
And you, my friend,
are responsible
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!
You... are... a... toy!
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.
Farewell.
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!
"Rendezvous with Star Command."
Hey, gas dude!
You talkin' to me?
Yeah, man. Can you help me?
Pizza Planet? Andy!
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?
Oh, no!
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.
Buzz! Buzz, come back!
Go away!
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! ll...
I found a spaceship!
It's a spaceship, Buzz!
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!
Cutting Boulevard, huh?
Yeah, yeah. Which way?
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin
once it jettisons its food supply?
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.
Well, then, let's climb aboard.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.
We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Yeah, bu...
Buzz! Buzz!
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?
Thanks for the directions, okay?
Yeah. And remember, kid...
Buzz!
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.
Next shuttle liftoff
is scheduled for
Tminus 30 minutes and counting.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...
Sheriff!
There you are.
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.
Great idea, Woody.
I like your thinkin'.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
Now!
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?
Watch where you're going!
Sorry.
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three,
two, one.
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?
Andy!
Now, we need to find a ship
that's headed for Sector 12.
Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.
There's a special ship. I just saw it.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive.
And Astro... turf!
Where is it? I don't see the...
Come on. That's it.
Spaceship!
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...
And the universe explodes!
Okay, Buzz, when I say go,
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!
No!
Mom, if I eat all my pizza,
can I have some alien slime?
This cannot be happening to me.
A stranger.
From the outside.
Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
Before your space journey,
reenergize yourself
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.
Who's in charge here?
The claw!
The claw is our master.
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.
This is ludicrous.
Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?
Take that!
Oh, no! Sid!
Get down!
What's gotten into you? I was...
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...
The claw, it moves.
I have been chosen!
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.
Gotchal!
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!
Yes!
Buzz! No!
Hey!
He has been chosen!
He must go.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Do not fight the claw.
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!
All right!
Double prizes!
Let's go home and... play.
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.
You're almost home.
Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!
Sit! Good boy.
Hey, I got something for you, boy.
Freeze!
Ready, set, now!
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!
What?
Did I get my package in the mail?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
What? Hey!
She's sick!
No, she's not!
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.
No!
No, not Sid's room. Not there.
Hey, give her back!
Sid! Sid!
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.
Prepare the OR, stat!
Patient is... prepped.
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.
Doctor, you've done it!
Hannah!
Janie's all better now.
Mom! Mom!
She's lying!
Whatever she says,
it's not true!
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!
Locked.
There's gotta be another way
outta here.
Buzz? Was that you?
Hey, hi there, little fella.
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
Buzz!
They're cannibals.
Mayday, mayday.
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.
Star Command, do you copy?
I've set my laser from stun to Kill.
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!
Buzz, is that you?
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!
Look, they're home.
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place
you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.
Woody's gone?
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.
Where are your rebel friends now?
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!
All right!
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door. It's open!
We're free!
Woody, we don't know
what's out there!
I'll tell you what?
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!
Shield your eyes.
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
Get away!
Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?
Stop that.
Back! Back, you savages! Back!
Woody, stop it!
Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home.
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.
Don't tell me what to do.
Yeehaw! Giddyap, pardner!
We got to get this wagon train
amovin'!
Split up!
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.
This is Star Command.
Star Command!
Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.
On the way!
Buzz Lightyear!
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!
Calling Buzz Lightyear!
Karate chop action!
Wow!
Pulsating laser light!
Total annihilation!
Multiphrase voice simulator!
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!
To infinity and beyond!
Not a flying toy.
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure
and save a galaxy near you!
Buzz Lightyear!
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the tricounty area.
And welcome back to the Point
Richmond Bowling Championship.
Out among the stars I sail
Way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sailed
To a dream
that ended too soon
Now I know exactly
Who I am and what I'm here for
You are a toy! You can't fly!
And I will go sailing
No more
But no, it can't be true
I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky
If I believed I could fly
Why, I'd fly
To infinity and beyond!
Clearly, I
Will go sailing
No more
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?
What, dear? What was that?
Never mind!
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.
Really?
That is so interesting.
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?
Buzz!
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.
Oh, no!
What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.
It goes quite well with your head.
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.
I'll be right back.
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?
Gonel! It's all gone.
All of it's gone.
Byebye. See ya.
What happened to you?
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darjeeling with
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.
I think you've had
enough tea for today.
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?
I am Mrs. Nesbitt!
Snap out of it, Buzz!
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.
I can get through this.
Oh, I'm a sham!
Look at me.
Quiet, Buzz.
I can't even fly out of a window.
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.
The apron is a bit much.
"Out the window"!
Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, come on. This way.
Years of academy, training, wasted!
B3.
Miss! G6.
You sunk it. Are you peeking?
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.
Give me the nose. Come on.
How about three out of five?
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!
Son of a building block. It's Woody.
He's in the psycho's bedroom.
Hi!
Everyone! It's Woody!
Woody?
You're kidding!
Woody?
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.
Buzz?
Hey, look!
Woody!
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.
Knew you'd come back, Woody.
What are you doin' over there?
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.
Here! Catch this!
Whoal! I've got it, Woody.
He got it, Woody.
Good goin', Slink. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?
Hey!
Potato Head.
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?
And now you wanna let him
back over here?
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!
You are a liar!
No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.
Just a sec!
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?
That's very funny, Buzz.
This is serious!
Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.
Oh! Hi, Buzz!
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!
Hey, look! It's Buzz!
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.
Give me five, man!
Something's screwy here.
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?
You bet. Give me a hug.
Boy, I love you too.
See? It is Buzz.
Now give back the lights,
Potato Head.
Wait just a minute.
What are you tryin' to pull?
Nothing!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Murderer!
No! No, no, no, no, no!
You murdering dog!
It's not what you think. I swear!
Save it for the jury.
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.
Come back! Slink!
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me! 
No! No! Come back!
Slinky!
Buzz! Go away!
You disgusting freaks!
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!
What are you don'? 
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.
But they're cannibals.
We saw them eat
those other toys.
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...
You know, you know, eat my friend.
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!
What's wrong?
Sid?
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!
Sid! Buzz, come on!
You left that door open.
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!
It came!
It finally came!
"The Big One."
"Extremely dangerous.
"Keep out of reach of children."
Cool! What am I gonna blow?
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.
Now. Yes.
Oh, no!
Oh, man!
Sid Phillips reporting.
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.
Sweet dreams.
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.
But what if we
leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.
I need air!
Will you quit movin' around?
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
l get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?
Everyone else was picked.
Oh, Woody.
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.
Hey, Buzz!
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.
Oh, come on, Buzz, ll...
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.
Then 
we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
No, it is.
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.
But why would Andy want me?
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.
You are a cool toy.
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?
All ll can do is...
There's a snake in my boots.
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me
when he's got you?
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.
You should get outta here
while you can.
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.
Now let's get
you out of this thing.
Yes, sir! 
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.
Woody, it's the moving van.
We gotta get outta here now.
Come on, Buzz.
All right.
Hey, I'm out!
Almost there.
I want to ride the pony.
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm okay.
Oh, yeah!
Time for liftoff!
To infinity and beyond!
Back, back.
Down, down!
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.
Guys!
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.
There's a good toy down there,
and he's gonna be blown
to bits in a few minutes.
All because of me.
We gotta save him.
And...
But I need your help.
Please. He's my friend.
And he's the only one I've got.
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.
Launch pad is being constructed.
All right, listen up.
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.
Legs, you're with Ducky.
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?
Okay. Let's move!
Wind the frog.
Wait for the signal.
Go!
All right, let's go!
I'll get it!
Now!
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Scud!
Stupid dog.
Lean back!
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.
Countdown will commence
momentarily.
Stand by.
Let's go.
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.
What?
It's okay. Everything's under control.
Woody, what are you doing?
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...
Hey? How'd you get out here?
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?
Roger. Permission granted.
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.
And counting.
Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two,
one!
Reach for the sky!
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.
What?
Somebody's poisoned the water hole. 
It's busted.
Who are you callin' busted, buster?
That's right.
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,
or smashed or ripped apart.
_llWell?
That's right! Your toys!
Mamal
Mamal
Mama! Mama! 
Mamal
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.
We toys can see everything.
So play nice.
We did it! We did it! Yes!
The toys!
The toys are alive!
Nice toy.
What's wrong, Sid?
Don't you want to play with Sally?
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.
Woody.
Thanks.
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"
Woody! The van!
Bye, house.
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!
Quick!
Just go. I'll catch up.
Come on!
You can do it, Woody!
I got it!
I made it.
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!
Down!
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it.
Take care of Andy for me!
No!
Buzz!
Are we there already?
Woody?
How did you...?
How'd he get here?
Where have you...?
What happened?
What's goin' on?
What's he takin'?
There you are!
Hey. What's he doing?
He's at it again!
Get him!
Come on!
No, no!
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoal!
Pig pile!
Get outta that car!
Move it!
No! Please!
You don't understand!
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.
No!
Toss him overboard!
No, no, no! Wait!
Hooray!
So long, Woody!
Oh! Woody!
Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
Look out!
Now let's catch up
to that truck.
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.
What?
And Buzz is with him!
It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth.
What have we done?
Great! Now I have guilt.
We're almost there!
Rocky, the ramp!
Look out!
Quick! Hold onto my tail!
Attaboy, Slink!
Oh! Woody!
Woody! Speed up!
Speed up!
The batteries!
They're runnin' out!
I can't hold on much longer.
Slink! Hang on!
Great!
Woody! The rocket!
The match! Yes!
Thank you, Sid!
No! No, no! No!
No! Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no,
no!
No!
Woody! What are you doing?
Hold still, Buzz!
You did it!
Next stop, Andy!
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!
I should have held on longer.
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!
Woody!
Take cover!
This is the part
where we blow up!
Not today!
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'l
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.
To infinity and beyond!
Buzz, we missed the truck.
We're not aiming for the truck.
Hey, wow!
What? What is it?
Woody! Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they? 
Here in the car!
See?
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.
Which one can I open first?
Let's let Molly open one.
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.
Whoal! It's time!
Oh, Bo.
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.
That way I could play
the dominant predator.
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!
Molly's first present
is Mrs. Potato Head.
Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head.
Way to go, Idaho!
Gee, I'd better shave.
Come in, Frankincense.
Andy is now opening
his first present.
It's...
Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,
you are not worried, are you?
I can't quite...
Me? No, no.
Make out...
No. No, no, no, no.
A large box... It's...
Are you?
Now, Buzz,
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?
Oh, what is it? What is it?
Wow! A puppy!
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed
You just remember
what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You got troubles
And I got 'em too
There isn't anything
! wouldn't do for you
If we stick together
we can see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do
It's me and you, boy
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
