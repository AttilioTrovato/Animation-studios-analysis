Not when he's standing.|You know what I mean?
Hmm. Well, it, uh,|looks fine to me,
but if it'll make|you boys feel better,

I'm going down to boat|to get things ready for loading.
In the meantime, don't touch anything,|don't feed anything,
don't do anything__ nothing!
| Eh!


The Fernfield Timberwolves|and the Tacoma Giants!
It's playoffs time.|This is Fred Davis...
with my good friend, Phil Phil,|35yearveteran of color here...
to bring you|this exciting game today.
I would say that excitement|Is at fever pitch, Phil.
This is it__|all the marbles on the table.
Oh, no. Disappointing news here, Phil.|We just got word that AirBud,
the canine wonder,|will not be playing today.
Not be playing. Yes.| Oh, no.
Have the checked the kennel?

| 
| 
Ready, Gus?| |Come on, Gus! You can do it!
Punch!| 
ShShShh!

| 
Gus! 

No!
| Well,|the Giants will be kicking off,
so the Timberwolves will be...
They'll be, uh, down there|on the field right with 'em.| receiving.
Coming to Goose! He's on the five,|he's on the ten, the fifteen__
He's at the fifteen, he's at the ten,|he's back at the five.
Ohh. All right, come on, offense.|Let's do it! Come on!
Josh, open up red 45.|Come on, red 45. Let's go!

He'll be here.|He wouldn't miss this for the world.
Hope you're right, Tom.| It'll be fine!
Prepare to eat dirt!
Ready! Down!
Set! Hike!| 

| And a fumble recovered|by the Giants!
| And into the end zone.|The Giants score!
Oh, this looks like|it's gonna be along day, Phil.| Oh, we're dead. We're dead.
Let's look at the scoreboard|and see how much time elapsed,|Phil, before that touchdown.
Where is the scoreboard?| Huh?
| Stop!
Come on, piggies. Work with me!| 
Ducks are my friend!|Comeback, please!
No! Dolly!| 
Listen to me! Listen tome, animals!| 

Natalya, you're back !Oooh!


Well, it looks like|Coach Fanelli is going to try|to put some points on the board.
They're going to go|For a field goal, Phil.|Looks like Vaughn kicking, and__
No, it hit Weeble's helmet|and it's way off to the left.| 
Well, I guess that wasn't|such a good decision after all,|was it, Phil?
I'll tell you, that could|give you some kind of headache.|You know, you get hit with a__

Oh, God!| Get out here, Popov!

| |I can't see anything!
I'll find you and then ll__| 
You__| 
I'm going to get you!
josh back to pass.|The ball is in the air__|it's intercepted!
Nowhere near a receiver.|And here they come|back the other way.
The Giants with__ No, josh has him.|Josh has him on the25.
He has him on the20.|He has him on the 15.|He has him on the 10.
He'sHe's__|Ah, boy.
Well, it looks like|another score for the Giants.|Oh, have you ever seen__

En garde!|Take that!
And that!| Natalya! Take this! I've got a net!
Not now, Popov! Can't you see I'm busy?|I'm fighting monkey!
|Musthurry! Musthurry!
|Natalya!

Come down from there!| Natalya!
Come get me!| Getdown!

Why don't you get yourself down|and clean up this mess|that you have created?
| Popov?
Coach Fanelli|takes a heavy anchor|to the half time locker room.
Down 24 to nothing.|Disappointed, downtrodden.

Hey, Coach, are you gonna tell us|another one of your stories?
You better believe I am.| 
This is the story|of a football team.
From the beginning, this football team|had heart and ability.
But there was one big problem:|they didn't believe|that they could win.
And then this dog came along,|and this dog could do amazing things.
And suddenly,|the team started winning.
But the truth is, even without the dog,|They were winners__
each and everyone of them.
So if you believe|that a dog can play football,
then you better believe|that we're gonna win this game.
Now, right now,|let's get out there...
and give them|some of that razzledazzle.
|Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff,
|ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!.
|Ruff!. Ruff!. Ruff!.
| You guys are the best!|Way to go, Marco!
It worked, Pudge!| 
|Timberwolves! Timberwolves!
Timberwolves!| |Giants on the attack again.
Here's Martin back to pass,|he's lookin'__|Ooh, he gets hit at the last minute.
They're gonna want that ball.|Goosesteps in__|he has it! it's an interception!
Goose! Go! Go!| The 40, the35__
Go!Go!|Go, Goose, go!

Well, that looks like|a little bit of inspiration|for the Timberwolves, doesn't it?
It just proves my theory.| What is that, Phil?
Score more points|than the other team,
and by golly,|you're gonna win!
All right, Brian!
All right? Go. Go!


| Yes! Yeah!
Popov!| Mother?
The animals!
|What is monkey's business?| 
|"Fish Guts. "

| 
Natalya__| Get off!.

To infinity__ and beyond!


| 
| 


| 

Where is monkey?| |I don't know, but there is dog.
Dog!

| 
Stop, stop!|Stop, stop! Stop!

| 
|It's okay. It's okay.
I'm glad to see you too.
What are you doin' down at the docks?|Don't you have a game to play?
Huh? Come on.| 
|Do you have a plan " B"?
We are Russian citizens!|We demand you take us|to the Russian imbecile!
It's "embassy," imbecile!


|Martin dropping back, Voss__
Oh, is he in the clear!
There isn't a Timberwolf|aroundfor20yards.
Touchdown! Looks bad now|for the ol' Timberwolves.

Oooh.
Now, come on, now. Forget about that__|ancient history.
Josh, get in here.|Come here. All right.
We're gonna get 'em|with a little "double trouble."|All right? Let's go.
But Coach, we've never done|"double trouble" without Buddy.
We're gonna have|to do it without Buddy.|Buddy's not here. Let's go.
Come on, offense.|Use Goose, all right? Let's go!
Come on, now!|Get out there!
| 
Ladies and gentlemen,|listen to that audience!
This is a sight to behold!|It's AirBud!
Good boy! Yeah! Yeah!|Let's go get 'em, boy.
| Phil, AirBud is back in the game!
Yeah, well,|this dispels that rumor.
What's that, Phil?| What's what?
Buddy, where were you?
Patrick?| Buddy! Buddy!
Like I said__ double trouble!
Looking for that ball__|Handoff!. Double reverse!
It's off to AirBud,|and he's off!.
He's down the field!|The Giants a reall chasing him!
It's AirBud in the clear!
It's AirBud down on the30,|down on the25__
| Yeah!
|Buddy! Buddy!

| 
|AirBud has put the timber|back in these Timberwolves.
I'm telling you, they are|on a scoring rampage now!

First down!
| Another score!
That is just amazing.
It's New Year's Eve|in the end zone with AirBud!
He's got fleas. You can't tell me|he doesn't have fleas.
Yea, Buddy!
AirBud has certainly|tightened up this game|for the Timberwolves,
but they're gonna need|another touchdown in order to win.
And now, this could be it!
Buddy!| Ooh, no!
1 84pound crushing tackle by Tyler.| Buddy's hurt!
And AirBud is down.
Teammates rushing onto the field.| Stay back. Give him room!
Air Bud__ We see movement.| I'm all right. Get the dog!
Excuse me. Comin' through.| 
How is he?| I don't know.
Is he okay?|Just hang on.
He's not sure yet.
Buddy, are you okay?| 
He's gonna be all right, Josh.|Why don't you get out there|and finish the game?
But what about Buddy?
It's okay. I'll take care of him.| Getup, Buddy.
Come on, Josh.|He'll be okay.
Josh, let's go.
Well, this certainly is|a crushing blow.
Poor AirBud__|out of this game.
Oh, I just__| Well, let's hope these guys can|go on by themselves.
Ready! Set! Hike! Hike!
| 
Third down coming up.|What do you think, Phil?
Well, I think__| Third down.|He's back for another pass.


If there's a miracle in the making,|it better show up now, Phil,
because this is the last chance.
We got ten seconds left|in this game.| 
Well, tenisisis enough|if you play your cards right.| Yeah, isn't it, Phil?
Sometimes you don't even have|to play cards, you know.| Yeah.
Come on, Tom. Get up.|We got a game to play.
I can't find my nosespreader.| Forget about your nosespreader.
But I can't catch without it.| Trust me, Tom. You don't need it.
It's gonna be fine.
This is our last shot, Josh.
I know. All right, guys.|Let's do B52, crossing pattern.
Deep.
That's 60 yards.|You can't throw 60 yards.| Are you sure you wanna do this?
I'm positive. You guys gotta trust me.| We're with you, Josh.
You just run, all right?| Break!| Let's rock.
| Hey, guys, look!

Come on, guys.|Let's go! Come on!
What about my nosespreader?


All right! Ready!
B! 52!
Down! Set!|Hike! Hike!
Get off!.

All right!
All right!|Honey, I'm so proud of you!
Congratulations, Josh!

Don't go.|Please don't go.


Third and three.|What would you do here?
Huh. Lemme see.|I think I'd go long to Joey Galloway.
Blue thirtyeight!
Good call.|They're not expecting that.
Oh, no!| I don't believe it!
