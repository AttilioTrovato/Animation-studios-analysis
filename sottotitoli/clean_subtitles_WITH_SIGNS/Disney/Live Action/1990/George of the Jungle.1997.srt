Get ready for room service,|mate, and girls.
We're gettin' our ape|and going to Vegas.
By next weekend,|we'll be headlining at the Tropicana.
Nobody is gonna stop us.| Right.
George of the Jungle|must be halfway to Frisco by now.
Ah, but the plotting poachers|were only half correct...
for at that very moment, our handsome|hero was all the way to San Francisco.
Yes, Mother, l'm safe.| You're sure you didn't|catch dengue fever?
No, Mother, l did not|catch dengue fever.
Well, how's your temperature?| Normal.
Colour of your tongue?| Pink.
What about your hmmhmm?| Regular.
Now, Lyle.|How is my darling future soninlaw?
Lyle is__
He's happy to be home, Mom.|Could you hold on one second?
George, please don't call any animals|into the car, okay? Thanks.
Mom? You there?
Mom, hold on. l'm losing you again.|George. George. No.
Are you paying any attention?|This is important.
No. l know it's important. GeoGeo__|George. George. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
This faster than riding big,|great, peanutloving poochie Shep.
Love you, Mom. Gotta go.|Bye. Watch out for that__
Ooh!
So, what do you|think of my jungle?
This very high tree house.
Good place to call friends from.|Sound carry.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
The neighbours.
Give it a rest!| We're ten storeys up, George.
l don't think the animals|can make it up here.
Oh, sure.|George know that.
George know that.
You must be tired. l'll, um...
make the couch up for you|to sleep in the living room.
Oh, no. George sleep here|in tree house.
Okay. Good night.
Sleep sweet, Ursula.
Sleep sweet, George.
Ooh.
Well, Ursula's fiance|is in prison...
and there's a jungle man|sleeping on her balcony.
She could use a best friend right now.| Hi.
Hi.| l got here as fast as l could.
Where is he?| He's under the waterf__|He's in the shower.
Not any more.
George.| Oh. Bad waterfall.
First water get hot, then George slip|on this strange, yellow rock. Oh!
Hi. George of Jungle.| Charmed, l'm sure.
George.|Um, take this big book.
Whoop! Cover the booty,|get into decent clothes.
Sorry, Betsy.| Bye.| No problem.
Okay.| l see why they made him|king of the jungle.
Betsy, l am|in trouble here, okay?
How am l gonna tell my parents|that my fiance's in an African jail...
and that l brought home|a jungle man?
You are totally stuck|on George, huh?
No, l am not!
Can l have him then?|Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.
Think, think, think, think,|think, think, think, think.|What am l gonna do about tomorrow?
Tomorrow is your engagement party,|and unless they give day passes...
out of Bujumbura Jail,|Lyle is not likely to attend.
So tell 'em the truth and don't|worry about it and take George.
He can back up your story. Right?| Yeah. All right.
So l'll tell my dad|first thing in the morning.
Make it second thing. First thing, l|suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.
Nice butt flap.
Being of a conservative mind|regarding gender roles...
Ursula Stanhope|wasted no time...
in taking George of the Jungle|to a fine haberdasher.
And this is Neiman Marcus.| Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.
Hello. Would you like|to sample our new fragrance?
Thank you.
Later, in the men's department, after|discovering his longlost brothers...
the jungle king was pleased to find|he looked pretty good in Armani.
Pretty darn good.
Watch out, man!
Why everyone run around crazy,|like antelope in mating season?
They're just trying to make a living.|lt's__ different kind|of jungle here, George.
lt's survival of the fittest.|Dog eat dog.
''Dog eat dog''__ Dog eat dog here?| No, that's not what l meant.
George never bring Shep here.|Uhuh. Never.
Every story gets to have a really big|coincidence, and here's ours.
Who should see them walking down|the street but Ursula's meddling mother?
Uh, yes, uh, Lyle Van de Groot,|please.
l'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.| He's not?
No. l'm sorry.
Meanwhile, back on Ape Mountain...
George's friends were going positively|gaga from missing the jungle king.
No!
Oh, look at this.|lt's ruined. Ruined!
Shep, come here at once.
Come on!
How many times do l have to tell you?|My violin bow is not a chew toy!
Bad dog!
And you! Out of my sight,|you feathered fool.
No! Not on the tree house!|l'll smack you__
Ursula, it's Mother.|Pick up the phone...
and tell me who that man was|l saw you strolling with today.
And where is Lyle?|We must discuss the engagement party.
l know you're there, Ursula.|Pick up the phone and tell me|why you have been avoiding me.
Pick up the phone!
Well, l think that|was an overreaction.
Just make sure you stay here|while l'm at work...
and you can watch TV|and eat and relax.
And l'll be back as soon as l can.|Just stay here.
''Stay here''? George is king|of the jungle. No four walls built|by modern man can contain him.
Not true. George have every intention|of doing exactly what Ursula say.
Really? ls that so?| For a while.
And at that very moment,|Betsy and Ursula were on their way to|break the news about Lyle to her father.
Good luck, kiddo.| Surprise!
Ursula, welcome home,|sweetheart...
and happy engagement day.
Chock Full O' Nuts
The heavenly coffee
The coffee that brings you together.| When you're in love
Now George understand. George get|coffee, then Ursula want George.
Javajavajavajava,|javajavajavajava,|javajavajavajava.
So the low has moved offshore.|High pressure's built a ridge in.
The weather|is absolutely gorgeous.
lf you're not outside, you oughta be!| Who, me?
l mean you.| Oh.
Okay!
And so, jazzed on java...
George of the Jungle made his way|into the city by the bay.
Whoo!
Quickly taking to tourism,|the jungle king enjoyed...
the first drivethrough|dining of his life...
and strolled the city streets until|he found something so scintillating...
he had to say:| Ooh!
But nothing excited|the jungle king more...
than the sight of the biggest|rope bridge he had ever seen.
Ooh. Yeah.
Help!| Ooh.
Somebody help!
To swing or not to swing?| Help!
Swing.
As the king of the jungle|quickly calculated the angle|and velocity of his next big swing...
Ursula felt like jumping|off a bridge herself.
l feel so guilty.|l don't know what l'm going to do.
First thing: l suggest you tell your|father what you came here to tell him.
Hi, Daddy.| Hi, honey. Take a look at this.
The most remarkable thing|is happening on the Bay Bridge.
...where strong winds|have carried him to the Bay Bridge.
Our own Valerie Devlin|is live on the scene. Valerie?
Thank you, Terilyn.|We do have a breaking story...
at the Bay Bridge...| Help!| where a parasailor dangles...
helplessly, 500 feet above the water.| Please! Hurry up! Help!
There's no word on who|this lone daredevil is.
That's George.| He appears to have some kind|of rope in his hand.
He might be preparing to swing on it.| l gotta go.
Excuse me, sir.|l have to get on this boat.
Hey, fella. George of Jungle.|Need a vine?
Hey, thanks a lot, man.|GGet me out of this stuff, huh?
Thanks, man.| Oh, don't mention it.
King of jungle only here to help!
George!| Ursula! Ow!
Watch out for that__
George!| Ursula!| What are you doing? Are you okay?
You just saved that man's life!| George just lucky, l guess.
Ooh. This coffee stuff|really work good.
...one of the most daring rescues|ever recorded live on television.
This is Valerie Devlin reporting|to you from under the Bay Bridge.|Back to you, Terilyn.
You know, they say the city by the bay|is the most romantic in the world...
and it looks as though|there might be a little romance|unfolding under the Bay Bridge.
We'll be back in a moment.| Ohh.
Meanwhile, back in the jungle__
There's five stinkin' apes out there.|Which one are we takin' to Vegas?
The one who's playing chess.| Checkmate.
Yes!| Sweet dreams, banana breath.| Grab him!
Tookie. Go find George.
TookieTookie.
Thor.
Let's get him in the cage|while he's still under. Come on.
As the pesky poachers|grunted and groaned...
pushing and pulling|the ponderous primate along...
the trusty TookieTookie bird|was already winging to the rescue...
making a birdline|for San Francisco...
where George of the Jungle was trying|to give the heiress Ursula...
the courage to face her parents...
by helping her discover|the juju within.
Make jungle call.|Then you'll feel brave.| No. l can't.
Come on. Big breath.|Here. Support voice.| NNo. No, no, no.
Ursula, please? Pl__ Please?| No, no!
l can't do it.| Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.|Come on, Ursula.
Wow.| Not bad for beginner.
Hi, Ursula.| Emboldened with jungle juju...| Hi.
Ursula Stanhope went inside|to break the news to her parents,|who took it extremely well.
Mother, Daddy,|l love you both very much.
l have something|very important to tell you...
and l hope you'll understand.
l don't want to marry Lyle any more.| We understand, dear.
Just kidding.
The young Miss Stanhope|proceeded to spill the beans...| So, anyway, l went to the jungle__
very quickly...
until she got to|the important part at the end.
Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle|is in jail and George is with me...
and l don't want to marry|Lyle any more.
l knew it. lt's that swinging man|from the bridge.
l saw you smooching on TV.
Mother, we weren't smooching__| How could you do this to me?
Don't you realize the calibre of people|who are going to be here?
Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say__| l thought we would be|introducing them...
to Lyle Van de Groot, not some|wild man you found in the jungle.
Beatrice, this is supposed to be|her wedding, not yours.
So?| Beatrice, l know you're upset...
and so am l, but we can't force her|to marry someone against her will.
Why not?| Mom. Dad.
l'm ready to go out there|and apologize to everybody|and tell them what really happened.
Absolutely not!
As far as l'm concerned, you__|you caught one of those viruses.
Yes, one of those dreadful|jungle viruses...
that get nice girls all confused.
And if Lyle survives that|awful jail, you will simply|have to kiss and make up.
As for this evening, we will hold|our heads high and we will carry on.
Now, darling, where is that charming|young friend of yours?
Well, where is he?| l don't know.|He's around here someplace.
Well, find him. We haven't got|all day. Oh, Ursula, look!| Oh, great!
How wonderful!|And look at Richard's exquisite|figurines of you and darling Lyle.
George, watch out for that__
Mom. Dad. This is George.
Hello, Mr and Mrs Ursula.
How do you do?
lt is always such a pleasure|to see you, Mr Mayor.
And, you know, it's so nice|to get away from City Hall...
and be around some normal people|for a change.
Well, we are perfectly normal,|l assure you__ in an exceptional way,|of course.
Of course.|AAnd what about this guy, Lyle?
You know, l'd really like to meet|the man you deem good enough|to marry your daughter.
Oh, well, unfortunately Lyle|is busy at the moment...
uh, tending to some legal affairs.
Some pate, Mr Mayor?| You know, l never touch that stuff.| Oh.
l had a lovely time.| Would you excuse us, please?| Excuse me, Dr Goldblum.
lt's 7:30. Do you know where|your jungle man is?
So this is what you were doing|in the jungle. Clever girl.
Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines|and fed me coconut milk.
l knew it.| He's not a real meat loaf, is he?
No. l mean,|he's not brainy...
in that doctor, lawyer,|banker way...
but he has something else.
He has a__| Sensual intelligence.
''Sensual intelligence.''
Wow.| Oh, my God.
What is it with chicks|and horses, huh?
George, how are you this evening?
Pretty sharp threads there,|uh__ George, right?
Yeah. Where're you based?| The jungle.
l hear ya.|We cut our teeth in New York also.
Eh, you considering a position|with Stanhope? That could be fruitful.
Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.|Nobody here have big coconuts.
George.
l wa__ Oh.
Would you mind|stepping outside with me__
Thank you so much__|for just a moment?
Sure.
Hello, Beatrice.| Hello, Ella.
Well, we haven't been friends|for very long, George...
but l already think l know|something about you.
Oh?| You are in love with my daughter.
Oh, Mrs Ursula not so dumb.| George.
My concern, however, is that Ursula|seems to reciprocate your feelings...
and that does present|a problem to me.
You see,|you and Ursula together...
would be unbefitting|her social stature.
You see? Let me put it in a way|you might understand.
Where you come from...
zebras marry zebras|and leopards marry leopards.
Stripes with stripes,|spots with spots.
Well, Ursula is a stripe|and you are a spot...
one which l intend to have removed|as soon as possible.
So you no want Ursula|to love George.
l would rather have my tongue nailed to|this table every morning at breakfast.
That hurt.| Not as much as you will|if you do anything...
to screw up my daughter's marriage|to Lyle Van de Groot.
When Lyle returns, this wedding|will proceed as planned.
lf you do anything to upset that...
l will remove your reason|for wearing a loin cloth.
Steak tartare, Mrs Stanhope?
Oh, no, no. Thank you.|l've had quite enough protein for today.
Have a pleasant evening,|Mr Jungle.
Tookie? Tookie!
Tookie.|George so happy to see Tookie.
Ape kidnapped?|Ape apenapped?
George save Ape!
Ursula.
Well, of course he went back to the|jungle. Where else would go__ the Hague?
But why would he leave|without saying goodbye?
Well, personally l think he acted|rather sensibly. Showed good character.
He understands that he belongs there,|you belong here.
lt's really all a question|of stripes and spots.
What? Oh, no.
You got to him.|Mother, what did you say?
l simply said that if he|really cared for you...
he'd leave you alone and let you|get on with your life and marry Lyle.
l am not marrying Lyle, Mother.| Beatrice, perhaps we should just__
Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,|don't be ridiculous.
There's a big difference|between marriageable material|and a fling in the jungle.
''A fling in the jungle''?|''A fling in the jungle.''
Who says l had|a fling in the jungle?
You don't think you can|fool your mother, do you?
You've been head over heels for that ape|ever since you brought him here.
Now, Ursula, that kind of love|is fleeting. You'll get over it.
Did you just say ''love''?| No.
You did.| Ursula.| You're right.
Don't say it.| l love him. l'm outta here.
Ursula, you can't love him.|Arthur, say something.
Be careful out there, honey.| What?
Goodbye, Daddy.| l love you.
Wha__| l love you, Mom. Thank you.
Ursula__ Arthur, do something!| What would you have me do?
There's obviously no stopping her.| Oh, God.
Ursula!| God, that woman's a pain in the ass.
Meanwhile,|halfway across the world...
another ass was feeling pain...
as an ape named Ape|was caged in a cage...
hoping to hear|the jungle king's awesome__
Hey, l'm pretty good at that__
and wondering|if he would ever come.
But the motionsick mammal|needn't have moaned...
for that defender of the innocent,|protector of the weak...
and allaround good guy|George of the Jungle...
was closer than he knew.
Next time George get bigger box.
Oh! Bad luck.
Did you hear something?| What?
l heard a noise.| Shut up and push!
Oh, l think l chipped a tooth.
Oh, Thor, you're disgusting.| God, that wasn't me.
Not me.
l'm hungry.| Oh, shut up.
You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,|and l'm gettin' mad enough to__
You know, you really should|work on your anger.
Have you tried Brankowski's|''Cage the Rage'' technique?
Don't let him get to you, Thor.|He's just an ape.
That's a fine way to talk|to your meal ticket.
You keep that up, it's liable|to affect my stage performance.
Give him a banana, Thor.|lt won't be long now.
That's what you said yesterday.
This trail's taking us|to the middle of nowhere.
The sign at the trail head said|''Short cut to Ape River.''
Now, why would it say ''short cut''|if it wasn't a__
Wait a minute.|Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.
Very good, Max.|Actually, the trail is a fake.
lt circles Ape Mountain six times before|heading right back to the tree house.
Ohh! Oh, l knew we was lost.| Don't listen to him, Thor.
He's just tryin' to trick us,|lead us off the short cut...
so we take twice as long|on the regular trail.
We're already taking twice as long!
Are you gonna let a monkey|make a monkey out of ya?
What?| Duh!
Let's go. lf he tells us the short cut|leads to the tree house...
then that's exactly|where it doesn't lead.
Ape?
Poor apenapped brother.| Careful.
Max, look.|We're back at the tree house.
Well, l tried, but you fellas|are just too smart for me.
Oh, no!| ''Oh, no'' was right,|for the exhausted apenappers had__
Hey! Why don't you say something|constructive for a change,|like what we should do now.
Because l don't like you.|Well, l hate you, you snotty son of a__
l'll pretend l didn't hear that.|Having some fun now, hmm?
Thor, were you fighting|with the narrator?| Well, he started it.
Did not.| You did too!
Did not.| You did too!| Did not!
You did too!| Thor, stop it!| Ohh.
That's it. l'm not draggin'|this thing another inch.
What are you doing? Get back there|and work. Where are you going?| You wretched little weasel.
Aren't you the little weasel,|you big brontosaurus?
Let's take care of him.| Huh? Huh?
Whoa!|Why didn't you come sooner?
Why Ape have little stars|around head?
George, remember|everything l taught you about|Queensberry rules and fighting fair?
Uhhuh.| Well, now's a good time to forget it.
Let's finish him off.
Oh, l can't breathe, Max.| Let it out, Thor. Let it out.
Right, jungle boy.
Huh?| Huh?
TookieTookie!
Take this!| Stop it! Ape!
Get it off!|Get it off of me, Max!
All right!
Shep, look out!
Ursula?
George good teacher.
George. George.|l came all this way to tell you that__
Ursula talk later.|George busy now.
What?| Fella got toucan on can.
l know.
Good show, George.|And you too, Tookie.
Oh, my hero.
Did l just say that?
George. Over here, George!| Ape, sit tight. George be right back.
Oh, l say.
Now George can talk.|What Ursula come back to say?
Only that l know in my heart...
that l really, truly__
Haven't seen the light yet.| Lyle.
Lyle?| Yes, Lyle.
For the venal Van de Groot had escaped|from the Bujumbura jail...
and joined an obscure cult|on the shores of Lake Tanganyika...
which had empowered him with|a peculiar piece of parchment.
What are you doing here?| Surprised, my little cupcake?
You see, l'm now|an mailorder minister...
ordained the Church of Celestial|Power and Light, lncorporated...
capable of performing legally binding|marriage ceremonies anywhere.
Lyle, l'm not marrying you.| Actually, you are.
Come on, let's go.|Come along, my little African queen.| George.
Now George really mad.|George tear off your__
At ease, jungle boy.| Everybody freeze now!
Operation completed|as ordered, sir.
Thank you, Gunnar, Gunter,|Hans, Jan and Phil.
No hard feelings, stone belly.
The best man won.|That's all.
l should say, the guy who brought|mercenaries won. That's all.
Okay, honey, you ready to go? l got|a boat waitin' to take us to Bujumbura.
Come on.| George!| Ursula.
Come on.| No!| Don't go that way!
Go that way. No__| See you later.
George! Stop it! Stop it!| Ursula!
Lyle, let go of me.| Come on. Come on. Come on.
Bongogram!|Work every time.
Good work, brother apes.|Now listen very carefully to George.
Let 'er rip, Shep.
Stop it! Stop it, Lyle!
Come on.| Let go. Stop it! You're such a jerk!
Come on in there!|Come here!
You know, l forgive you, and l'm|willing to give you yet another chance.
Lyle, you don't where you're go__
Where's George?
You see? l told you|l'd have a boat waiting.
Okay, then. All righty.
Reverend Lyle|ready to perform the ceremony.
Do you, Ursula Stanhope,|take me, Lyle Van de Groot...
to be your lawful wedded husband?| Get a grip, Lyle.
Lyle.| Yeah, honey?
Lyle?| Oh, my God!
Lyle!
TookieTookie!
Thanks, Tookie.
This biggest swing|in jungle history.
Will hurt very much,|but George have to do it.
George!| What the__
This gonna hurt.| George, watch out for that tree!
George not feel so good.
Oh, thank God we've made it.|Say ''l do,'' Ursula.
Ah, that's it. We're married.|Now to look at my bride.
No!
No! No!
George, what l came here to say|was that l love you.
Ursula love George?| So much.
George love Ursula too.
And so George of the Jungle received|the first kiss of his life...
that came from|neither elephant nor ape.
And on the following new moon...
Ursula Stanhope finally got|the simple wedding she had hoped for...
as the San Francisco heiress|and the king of the jungle...
joined their hearts forever|in wedded bliss.
The rings!| The rings.
The rings? Tookie.
Tookie.
Arthur, l wish you'd do something|about all these monkeys.
l feel like Jane Goodall.
Madam, l knew Jane Goodall,|and you are no Jane Goodall.
Listenin' to some inner call
Swimmin' blindly|to throw myself upon your shore
l think l know why|the dog howls at the moon
l think l know why|the dog howls at the moon
And l sing, dela, dela
When l'm with you
l burn for you
l been waiting for you|all my life
Hoping for a miracle
l been waiting day and night
Day and night
l been waiting for you|all my life
Waiting for redemption
l been waiting day and night
l burn for you
l love you.| Good boy.
And so ends our tale|of that defender of the innocent...
protector of the weak|and allaround good guy...
George of the Jungle.
A noble king,|his beautiful queen...
and their nimble young heir|to the jungle throne.
George, watch out for that__
l know what you're thinking__|How does a baby raised by an ape...
grow up to be king of the jungle,|find his queen...
and live happily ever after?
George just lucky, l guess.
George, George|George of the Jungle

Watch out for that tree
George, George|George of the Jungle

Wait a moment! Wait, wait, wait! Don't|you want to know what happened to me?
And now the end is near
And so l face the final curtain
My friends|l'll say it clear
l'll state my case|Of which l'm certain
l've lived a life that's full
l've travelled|each and every highway
And more, much more than this| Whoo
l did it my way|Yes!
There were times|l'm sure you knew
When l bit off|more than l could chew
But through it all
When there was doubt| Doubt
l ate it up and spit it out
l faced it all|and l stood tall
And did it my way
Doo, doo, doo
George, George|George of the Jungle
Strong as he can be
Watch out for that tree
George, George|George of the Jungle
Lives a life that's free

He's man's best friend|He's George's dog
He's George, George|George of the Jungle
Strong as he can be
Watch out for that tree

George, George|George of the Jungle
Lives a life that's free
Watch out for that tree
Left in the wild was a baby|with a smile named George
Who stayed for quite a while
And George grew up|in the trees above
When Ursula found him|they found love
She took him to the city|Took him straight downtown
But the concrete bliss|brought poor George down
So it's back to the jungle|for a wedding in the green
For the king and queen|of the animal scene
George, George|George of the Jungle
Strong as he can be
Watch out for that tree
Watch out for that__|Bang! Ooh! Tree
