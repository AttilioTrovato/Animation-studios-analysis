stay! 
"Felicitaciones , uh,
al Pato Donald..."
Oh! "Felicitations to Donald
Duck on his birthday",
"Friday the 13th, from his
friends in Latin America."
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
What a pleasant surprise!
Whoops!
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?
Which one should I open first?
My mama told me to take...
this one!
I wonder what's in it.
Oh, boy! Home movies!
Just what I wanted.
Well, well, well.
Well, doggone! A little penguin.
Oh! What a cute little fellow.
Well, what is this? How do you
open this thing, anyway, huh?
On with the show!
The show must go on!
Aves Raras.
A ves Raras? 
Sí, señor. That means
strange birds. 
Oh, sure, sure. I know, birds!
Yes, amigo. Your
feathered cousins. 
You know, Donald, you have more relatives
here than coffee beans in Brazil. 
For instance, take the one
who lives way, way down... 
Aha! 
But suppose we let my friend,
Professor Holloway, tell us about it. 
From the beginning to... 
El fin, the end. Yes, thank you. 
Professor? 
This stow takes us way
down to the south pole. 
Rather than stand on your heads,
let's turn the theater over. 
There, that's better. 
Two things you will find
most of down here are ice... 
and penguins. 
It's amazing that anybody
would want to live here, 
but most penguins wouldn't
live anywhere else. 
You couldn't find better
weather for fishing... 
skiing, tobogganing,
or swimming. 
And there is nothing the
average penguin likes better 
than a day at the beach. 
Uh, but come on, let's meet Pablo. He
lives down at the end of main street. 
Let's go in and see
what's cooking. 
Pablo could never remember
having been warm enough. 
And so his closest companion was
Smoky Joe, his little stove. 
Between chills, Pablo
had one burning desire, 
to spend the rest of his
life on some tropical shore. 
So, we see him bravely set forth
for the isle of his dreams. 
The other penguins turned out
to give him a big sendoff. 
But when he gets just so
far away from his stove... 
see what happens? 
Too bad. Perhaps he'll
give up this wild idea. 
But no, he's off
to another start. 
This time he's
bringing a friend. 
UhOh! Uhoh, uhoh! 
Uhoh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! 
Anyway, it was a hot idea. 
Well, maybe he'll be content
to stay at home this time. 
But no! There he goes! 
Hotfooting it to the
land of the sun. 
By now, the farewell committee
has been reduced to two. 
Discouraging, isn't it? 
Suddenly, Pablo got one of those ideas
that change a person's whole life. 
A boat! 
But where would he get a boat? 
Just watch! 
"Where there's a will,
there's a way," they say. 
And now, the official launching. 
Day after day, the south
wind carried him north. 
One day, a blanket
of fog rolled in. 
And it was so thick... 
Must be near Cape Horn. 
As the fog lifted... 
he found himself headed straight
through the straits of Magellan, 
and northward, along
Chile's rocky coast. 
One day, a storm cloud came up. 
Just a little bitty old
storm cloud, though. 
And just tried awful hard
to have its first storm. 
Didn't amount to much, though. 
One day on lookout, Pablo
had a bit of a shock. 
A waterspout off the port bow! 
But it proved to be the
Juan Fernandez islands 
where Robinson
Crusoe once lived. 
And still does, apparently. 
Four bells and all's well. 
According to Pablo's chart, he
should be nearing Vina Del Mar. 
And strangely enough,
that's just where he is. 
He sailed past Lima,
capital of Peru. 
Hugging the coastline with a tenacity
of purpose seldom found in a penguin. 
One day, his telescope picked out a
city high up on top of a mountain. 
The map said it was Quito. 
And it was right smack
on the equator. 
It wasn't as easy to cross, 
but with a little help
from Neptune, he made it. 
80, making a left turn,
he followed the equator, 
headed for the
Galapagos islands. 
Ah, that good old sun! 
Pablo felt that he would
never get enough of it. 
Oh, he hadn't counted on this. 
Things looked pretty bad. 
Help! Man the pumps,
she's sprung a leak! 
Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things, get going! 
Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship! 
Unruffle the mizzenmast
and man the poops, and... 
don't just stand there, get going!
Swab the decks and... Heavens! 
Look! What's that? Just
what he's been looking for. 
Pablo has finally reached
the isle of his dreams. 
And so, as the warm, tropical
sun sinks slowly in the west, 
we leave little Pablo,
a bird in paradise. 
A picture of health in
his new coat of tan. 
He should be the happiest
penguin in the world. 
Only... sometimes he
gets to thinking... 
Never satisfied! 
Well, that's human nature for
you, even if you're a penguin. 
You're absolutely right!
And now, Donald, let's
hop over the Andes. 
From these snowcapped peaks to
the depths of the amazon jungle, 
one finds many more
strange and exotic birds. 
Like the Anambepreto of
Colombia and Venezuela. 
He carries his own bagpipes
hidden under his beard. 
Then there's his
cousin, the Arapapa. 
Pride of Paraguay, whose
perfect appearance 
permits his pompous
pride in his pompadour. 
And La Tijerita,
the scissors bird. 
The Colombian cutter. 
Then there's the 
Arapacu de Pico Curvo.
He's always sticking
his nose into things. 
Did you ever see
such a freak beak? 
Huh? 
Speaking of beaks, what a time
two toucans have making love. 
When they're beak to beak,
they can't get cheek to cheek. 
Because when one
toucan turns his head, 
only one toucan can. 
Uhoh. Who's that?
Oh, a thousand pardons. 
Señor Donald, I would
like to have you meet 
one of the most eccentric
birds you have ever seen. 
His name is the Aracuan. You'll
find him most everywhere. 
Yeah, glad to know you.
Heh, pleased to meet ya!
Now he's called the Aracuan because
of the peculiar song he sings. 
Which sounds
something like this. 
Ahhh!
Bada, bup, bup Bup, bup, badia 
Bada, bup Toottoottoot 
Bada, bup, bup Bup, bup, bup 
Bada, bup, bup Bup, bup, badia 
Bada, bup Toottoottoot 
Bada, bup, bup Bup, bup, bup 
By the way, amigo,
did you know some birds
are skilled craftsmen? 
Uhuh. Is that so?
Yes, quite a builder is
the little Marrequito.
His nest may look haphazard in design,
ah, but every single stick and straw... 
is scientifically placed to withstand
the stress and strain of... 
Well, almost anything. 
Literally dotted are the shores
of many tropical marshes, 
with the brilliant
plumage of the flamingo. 
Ha, ha, ha.
And now, Donald, how
would you like to hear 
a story about another bird so
amazing you won't believe it? 
Oh, sure! You bet!
It's a tale told by an
old gaucho from Uruguay. 
Listen... 
It was early one
morning in springtime, 
just as day was
beginning to break. 
As the sun came up over the... Oh,
but I am forgetting my story. 
It was silent out there on the pampas.
Only one little bird was awake. 
From his nest, came the little
Homero to see if the... 
Oh, say, do you know why this
bird's called the Homero? 
No? 
Uhuh. Why?
You see, his nest is
just like the home.
That's the oven where we
bake bread and our... 
You know who that is? 
That's me when I was a little gauchito.
Many, many years ago, of course. 
And why was I up so early? Because
I was going out hunting all alone. 
First, I put on my bombachas
and tied on my chiripá.
Then I slipped
into my new Betas. 
And I put my Boleadoras Where I
could reach them in a hurry. 
Gauchito! Not forgetting
my hunting knife. 
And now I was ready to go. Ah! 
Now the best place to
hunt the wild ostrich 
is out on the wideopen plains. 
On the broad flat land of the... 
Flat land? Say, what
am I doing here? 
Oh, now I remember! 
This day I was hunting for condor
birds high up in the mountains. 
While looking for the condors, I
climbed to the top of a rock. 
No, come to think of
it, it was a tree. 
Let's see, maybe it
was a rock after all. 
Although, I could
swear it was a tree. 
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go, let it go. 
My sharp eyes soon
discovered the nest of a... 
Psst, Gauchito! The nest. 
El Nido, El Nido.
I could tell from
the wings he was... 
He was at least five
meters from tip to tip. 
The biggest condor bird in all of... 
caramba!
What's this? I couldn't
believe my eyes! 
No, it couldn't be!
But there it was! 
I was looking facetoface
with a flying donkey! 
The donkey bird
didn't seem bashful. 
He flew right up close to... Quick ,
Gauchito, now! Get him, quick! 
Ah, got him! 
Now, now. Easy, easy.
Tch, tch, tch. 
Oh, oh, oh, ohh!
This donkey should be worth a fortune.
I couldn't let him get away. 
So, I made up my mind I'd catch
him if it took me the rest of... 
Now I had him! Hold him, Gauchito!
Ride him, cowboy! 
He acted just like he was loco.
But I was an expert of course. 
He thought he could
throw this Gauchito, 
but he soon found out
who was the boss. 
Psst, Gauch'fio'?
Who is the boss? 
I decided to train him for racing
far out Where nobody could see,
'cause I planned to win thousands of
pesos for this little Burrito and me. 
I made brilliant plans
for the future. 
We 'd live like a couple of kings, and
I'd be the world's richest Gaucho.
With my hands full of
big diamond rings. 
Ah, macanudo! Okay. 
This Burrito was tame as a kitten. He
was learning new tricks every day. 
You should see how he
begged for my mate.
He liked it much
better than hay. 
Heehaw, heehaw!
Then we soon fell asleep by the campfire.
We both were as tired as could be. 
And tomorrow was very important
for little Burrito and me. 
For this was the day of fiesta. 
The gauchos were happy and gay.
They danced the Zamba and Gate, 
and gambled their pesos away. 
While the crowd sang and
danced in the plaza, 
I just stood in the
shade of a tree, 
and watched them toss
coins at the Sapo,
but this game meant
nothing to me. 
Some others were rolling the Bochas
and betting on games of this kind. 
I didn't join in these pastimes.
I had something bigger in mind. 
A Caballo! 
The race was about to begin, and
the grand prize was 1,000 pesos. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
The gauchos were howling with laughter
when they saw us come out on the track. 
I whispered, "Remember
the wings, Burrito." 
Oh, oh, oh, ohh!
Not yet, not yet! 
The gauchos and horses
were all on their toes. 
Listos! Larguen! 
We were off with the
speed of a bullet! 
We flew down the track like the wind.
Every gauche was, uh, uh... 
In the meanwhile, Burrito and I
were, uh, jockeying for position. 
Psst, Gauchito! They went that way.
That way! 
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
No wonder they laughed. I
didn't even look like a jockey. 
Hey, Gauchito. Come on,
look like a jockey. 
Pepito, the pride of Mendoza
was setting a furious pace, 
and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo, you
never have seen such a race. 
Now it's Pepito and Fuego,
it's Fuego and Pepito, 
and here comes Gordito on the rail!
Do your stuff, kid. 
No? Well, don't wait too long or...
Look out! 
Uhhuh, what did I tell you? 
Come on, Gauchito! The
Wings, the wings! 
Quickly, I untied the rope.
Come on, come on. 
Quickly, I untied the rope. 
Huh? The knife, the knife! 
Cortalo, cortalo!
And now we go. 
You should see little Burrito tearing up
the track so fast, you couldn't see us! 
And now, down the home
stretch comes Fuego. 
Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato, 
and Dorado is right on his tail! 
But where is Burrito? 
Here comes Burrito! 
We passed them like they
were standing still. 
And now coming down across
the line of finish, it's... 
Burrito, the winner! 
Well, amigos, it was all
over, but the shouting. 
I thought. Ohuh. 
Caramba! The jig was up.
Heehaw, heehaw!
What became of the
flying donkey, you ask? 
Neither him nor me was ever
seen again as long as we lived. 
Adiós, amigo.
Adiós, so long. Goodbye!
What's going on here?
Presents! Oh boy, let me at 'em!
Say, what's this?
Ah, Pato Donald, Como vai voce! 
Como vai essa forca?
Por onde tem andado? 
Há quanto tempo que nao o vejo!
¿Que hé de novo? 
Or, as you Americans
say, "What's cooking?"
Joe Carioca! Well,
I'll be doggoned!
Imagine meeting me here?
Donald...
have you ever been to Baía, no?
No, I haven't.
Ah, Baía.
Land of romance, moonlight,
music, beautiful girls.

very stupid fellow.

you ever been to Baía?
No, I haven't.

A song with love and
beautiful memories.

twilight in the sky.

Baía 
Can't you hear my lonely call 
Morena 
Make my life complete again 
How I pray for the day 
When I'll see your smile 
And my heart will beat again

When twilight is deep in the sky 
Baíaiaia 
Someone that I long to see 
Keeps haunting my reverie

Aha! My friends!
Bienvenidos, Cuates. 
Welcome to Mexico.
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to
see such fine gentlemen in Mexico!
Here, amigos. Donald!
Jose!
Caramba! Now we're
three gay caballeros. 
Yaaaaa!
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are
birds of a feather 
We're happy amigos No
matter where he goes 
The one, two, and three
goes We're always together 
Ah, ha, ha!
We 're three happy chappies
With snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath
our sombreros
Ah, ha, ha!
We're brave and we'll stay
so We're bright as a peso 
Who says so?
We say so! 
The three caballeros
Oh

Guitars here beside us 
To play as we go 
We sing and we samba
We shout Ay Caramba
What means "Av Caramba“?"
Oh, yes, I don't know. 
Oh 
Through fair or stormy weather 
We stand close together 
Like books on a shelf 
And pals though we may be 
When some Latin baby
Says yes, no or maybe 
Each man is for himself 
Ah, Jalisco no te rajes 
Me sale del alma
Gritar con Calor 
Ya, ha, ha!
Abrir todo el pecho pa' echar
Este grito que lindo es jalisco 
Palabra deeee Honorrrr 
Aha!
What's this?
What's this?
This is your gift
from Mexico, Donald.
A piñata.
Oh, boy, oh, boy! A piñata! 
What's a piñata? 
A piñata is full of surprises, presents.
It is the very spirit of Christmas.
Christmas?
Jingle bells Jingle
bells Jingle all... 
No, no, Donald! For
goodness sake!
Not "Jingle Bells"!
In Mexico, they
sing Las Posadas. 
This custom takes place 
on each of the nine
days before Christmas. 
Each evening, the children
gather at the village church 
and form a procession, 
symbolizing the journey
of Mary and Joseph 
from Nazareth to Bethlehem. 
The little ones carry images of
the saints from house to house, 
singing a plea for
shelter, or Posada.
A reply comes from within. 
"No Posada, no shelter." 
Looking sad and downhearted,
they try again. 
But the reply is still the same. 
"No shelter, no Posada."
They repeat the song time after
time, and always they are refused. 
Until, at last, they reach a friendly
house and the door is opened. 
"Come in, come in,
holy pilgrims." 
"This humble home is yours." 
And now, Mary and Joseph
have found shelter at last. 
Then the rejoicing begins. 
The feasting, the celebrating, and
finally, the biggest surprise of all, 
breaking the piñata.
And now, for your piñata, Donald.
Here you are. Go to it.
One side, boys, one side.
I'm going to smack it!
Hold it, ho... hold it, Donald.
First you must be blindfolded.
We have to put this over your eyes.
That's part of the tradition.
Now, now, stand here.
Come here now, hit it hard.
Alright, let's see you smack it.
Wait just a minute.
Uhoh.
Aha!
You see, Donald?
Didn't I told you it
was full of surprises?
Ahh'. La bandera Mexicana. 
Did you know that the history
of Mexico is in her flag?
Oh, yes!
You see, many hundreds of years
ago, the god of the Aztecs
commanded them to
build a big city 
where they would find an
eagle destroying a serpent. 
But when they find this eagle,
he was sitting on a cactus. 
On top of a rock, way out
in the middle of a lake. 
Caramba! To build a city here
would be almost impossiblé.
But they built and built
and built some more. 
Until today, believe it or not,
the lake is full of Mexico City. 
Sweet music 
Gay serenatas 
Tropic skies of velvet blue 
Magic gardens 
Perfume the breezes 
Where true love
Brought me to you 
Mexico With all your romance 
Your song of love Will
live forever after 
Mexico 
Sweethearts are singing 
Lovebirds are winging 
Through a sky filled
