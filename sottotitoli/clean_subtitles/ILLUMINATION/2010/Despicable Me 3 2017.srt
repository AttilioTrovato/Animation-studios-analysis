Illuminat...


Illuminat...

Illuminat...




Illumination!


The year was 1985,
and the number one
show on TV was...
Evil Bratt!
The show starred
young Balthazar Bratt
as a child prodigy 
and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination. 

There he is! Get him! 

I've been a bad boy! 
Bratt was the biggest
child actor of the 1980s,
striking a chord
with audiences
all over the world. 


There he is! Get him! 
But it all came
to an end in Season 3, when... 
I've been a bad boy! 
The young star
experienced an unexpected
growth spurt. 
Boy? Ugh! 
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him
and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral, 
starting to actually believe
he was the character
he played on TV. 
What are you looking at? 
Leading us all
to wonder, 
where is he now? 


You know what, Clive?
Playing a villain
on TV was fun,
but being one in real life
is even better.
Heist music!
Here it comes.


What? Clive,
what are you doing?
How is that
heist music?
Sorry. My bad.

Ew! 

Mommy!
Stop or I'll...


Sir, the ship has
been boarded by
some kind of monster!
Wait! That's not
a monster.
That's a man
wearing shoulder pads!
There's only
one supervillain
whose fashion sense
is quite that dated.
Balthazar Bratt.
Blast it!
The Dumont Diamond
is on that ship.
I want every agent
in the area on
the scene immediately! 

We're already here.
Agents Grucy
are closing fast.
Yes! Wait.
What did you call us?
"Grucy." You know,
Gru and Lucy mushed
together. Try it.
Oh! I like it,
but not a lot.
I don't like it.
Stop!
On the ground!



Go, go, go!
Eh?

Too late again, Gru!

Wha?
He's getting away!
That's what he thinks.

Go! Go! Go...
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!
I don't think we
can make it, Gru!
We can make it!
We can make it!
No, we can't!
Ahh!
Get ready!
Get ready for...

Hey.
How you doing?



Are you okay?


You guys are so cute.
Go get him, GruGru!
Hello, Gru.
How's your
transition coming?
You know,
from world's
worst villain
to world's
worst agent?
Oh, that's hilarious.
You should be on TV.
Oh, that's right.
You were! But then
you got canceled!

Haha!
What about that?
Ugh!
What? Oh, girls!
Oh!

Dance fight!


Ow!


Alpha Team,
the diamond is secure.
Come and pick up the package.
Copy that.
Alpha Team in approach. 
Gru!
Did you actually
think I was unconscious?
Huh!
It's called acting,
hoser.
And clearly,
I've still got it!



I've been a bad boy!

Freeze! Don't move!
Son of a Betamax!
Go, go! Get him!
He's getting away!

This isn't over, Gru.
You hear me?
This is not over.
Yeah? Well,
I still have the diamond.


Happy birthday to you 
Happy birthday to... 
Happy birthday, dear Dan 
Happy birthday to you 







I can't believe
Bratt got away again.
How is this
possible? How?

And it's not just
that he got away,
it is he's so
smug about it.
"Ooh, I've been
a bad boy!"
Gah!
Edna, hey!
Looking hot today.
Got cats on you.
And it was so humiliating,
dangling there
in the bubblegum Speedo.
And I didn't have
time to go to
the gym this week,
and I had a big breakfast.
And was feeling
a little bloated.
You know what?
He's not even
worth talking about.
I don't even want to
waste another breath
about the guy.
And another thing!
Next time I see Bratt,
I will moonwalk all
over his stupid face!

Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.
It is with great sadness
that I inform you that,
as of today,
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

Oh, no!
Your new leader
is coming directly
from head office.
Effective immediately.
She is the very gifted,
very ambitious,
Miss Valerie da Vinci.
As I look out
over all your faces,
I am flooded with
so many memories.
Oh, boy!
This is a snooze fest!
Excuse me,
this is my last...
Blah, blah, blah!
We understand.
You're old,
you're fat,
you're done.
Let me breathe in.



Ooh, broke a little sweat,
there. 
First order of business,

which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?
Oh, that would be me.
Although, I don't
know if I'd say
"loser," per se.
Kind of is...



Oh, it's the girls!
Not a good time.
Hey!
Ahh!
Yes, sir!
Uh...
Ma'am?
You're making
me nervous.
How could you let
Balthazar Bratt,
the AVL's most
wanted villain,
just get away?
That is the opposite
of what we do here!
Okay, okay.
Yes, maybe
he got away. Again.
But he didn't
get the diamond.
And I am this close
to bringing him in.
This close.
Huh. Interesting.
You're fired!
What?
That's totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent!
You know what?
If you fire him,
you're gonna have to
fire me, sistersister.
And do you
really wanna do that?
Do ya?
No, no, no!


Well, I guess
she did.
Honey, you didn't
have to do that.
I know how much
you love your job.
Well, I love
other things more.
You know, we're gonna
have to tell the girls.
Can you do it?
The whole "mom" thing
is still kind of new to me.
Oh, sure.
Huh?
Psst!


Hello?


Aloha! 
Oh!
This is unexpected.
Well, you never
got to go on
a honeymoon, so...
We made you dinner!
It's a luau!
We got pineapples
and coconuts
and ukuleles!
Oh! Yay!
Yay!


The soup of the day.
Madame and Monsieur. 
The gummy bears
were my idea.
Mmm! Looks too good
to even eat.
Am I right? 
But I made it
for you.
Oh.

Mmmmmmmmm!
Good soup!
I love the combination
of gummy bears
and meat.

I'm gonna hold it
in my mouth.
'Cause it's so good,
I don't wanna
swallow it.
So, how was work?
Ooh, did you take
that guy down?
Did anything explode?
Well, actually,
today, Lucy and I were
invited to not work
at the AVL anymore.

No!
You got fired?
Oh, no!
No, no, no.

Yes.

But don't worry.
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs. Real soon.
Even better ones.

What's better than
being supercool
secret agents?
Ooh, I know!
You could gamble online!
That's what
Katie's dad does.
Okay. We will
definitely look
into that.
That's a good
suggestion.
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

Hmm?


Guys! Shh! I don't think
you heard me right.
No, no, no.
This does not mean that
we are going back
to being villains.



Okay, all right.
I get it.
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately.
Especially with Dr. Nefario
accidentally freezing
himself in carbonite.


But our life of crime
is over!

Mel! Mel, you're
with me on this, right?









Guys, listen to me!
Read my lips!


What? What?
Oh... What did I say?
It's not "comquit"?
Ah, okay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Don't take that tone with me!
We're not going
back to villainy.

Yes! And I don't want
to hear another
word about it.

Look, if you guys
don't stop right now,
there will be consequences.

Hey! Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

What? You quit?
You're serious?
Come on!


Dave! Jerry!

Great news, guys.
You have been promoted.
You're in charge now.
Huh? Not bad.



Jeesh!

Ah,
Monsieur Pompeux!
To what do we owe
the presence
of the world's
foremost gem expert?
The chief of police
sent me.
He was concerned
that during the recent
heist attempt,
the Dumont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.


Ooh, lala!
You have been duped!

What? We have?
Yes.
By me!


But, what is...

Oh, no! Help!



Ooh! 
I've been a bad boy!
Or should I say...



Oh!


Hey, Gru.
What you doing
down here?
In the dark. Alone.
Oh, nothing.
Just thinking.
You okay?
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's just... 
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like
a failure.
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.
If only I could
have nailed Bratt.
So many times,
I almost had him.
But now I'll never
get the chance,
'cause I have been
kicked to the curb.
Gru, you've got
to let this go.
It's time to
look forward.
Things will get
better. I promise.


Excuse me.
Pardon me, young people?
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?


I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.




Idiots.

No! Kyle!
Stop! Kyle, let go!
No! No!
You've got to be kidding me!
Lucy, did you...
He helps you if
you have nightmares.
And he's really
good to snuggle with.
Oh, no, no, no.
Agnes! Agnes!
So 
take good care of him.
Thank you!

Agnes, what are
you doing?
You sold your unicorn?
Well, I just wanted
to help, since you
don't have a job.
I got two whole
dollars for it.


Uh, excuse me?
Sorry, buddy,
the sale's over.
Yes, but this will
only take a...
Hey, eyebrows,
get off the lawn.
Yeah, but...

Hey, could you...
Oh, uh, of course.
Now, as I was
saying, I...
Uh... Oh.
Goodbye!


Listen, Agnes,
you don't need to worry.
We're going to be fine.
For real?
For real.
Now, come on,
let's pack
this stuff up.
Ow! Ow!
Seriously?
Buddy, you're not
getting the hint.
Excuse me, Mr. Gru,
but I really must
have a word with you.
How do you know my name?
Allow me to
introduce myself.
My name is Fritz.

Ow! 

Good puppy.
And I am inquiring
on behalf of your
twin brother, Dru.
He needs your help.
What? Twin brother?
Twin brother?

Oh, ja. 
He would like to
fly you to Freedonia
to meet him.
Your father has recently
passed away and...
Okay, cuckoo.
I'm sorry, but
my dad died when
I was a baby,
and I don't have
any brother. You got
the wrong guy.
Really? Well, then,
how do you explain this?



Bellissimo! 

Oh, hello, Gru.
Hi, Mom.
It's important to
keep active in
one's golden years.
Oh!

There you are,
you cutie, you.
Oh! 
Uh, these are my
diving instructors.
Vincenzo und Paolo.

Ciao, boys.

So, what do you want?
Mom, do I have
a twin brother?
Ah! How did you find out?
Who told you?
Wait, what? It's true?
You never told me
I had a brother!
And you told me that Dad
died of disappointment
when I was born.
Ja, ja . 
That was the agreement.
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

Shortly after you and
your brother were born,
your father and I divorced.
We each took one son
to raise on our own
and promised never to
see each other again.
Obviously, 
I got second pick.
I have a brother!
Hey, girls!
How are things
in Row B, huh?
I put together some fun
activities for the trip!
Who is up for
some gin rummy?
Yeah, um...
We're good.
Oh, okay.
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.
I hope I win.
I wonder what Dru
will be like. Ooh!
Maybe we'll
have the twin thing
when you can read
each other's minds, no?
How cool would that be?
Um, super cool!


Ooh!




Freedonia!
Freedonia! Freedonia!

Hi, piggy, piggy!
Whoa!
Look at that house!
It's like a castle!
I can't wait to
meet my brother!
Ugh. What's with
all the pigs?
This is
the family business.
The largest pig farm
in the whole
of Freedonia.


Okay, nice pig.

No! That's my
private part!


This pig has issues!
Please, come in.





Oh, this is amazing!
Ah, it's like
the Sistine Chapel!
But with pigs.

My brother!
My brother!
Gru!
Dru!

Oh!
Brother! I am
hugging you!

I'm so happy!
After all of these years,
finally I'm meeting you!
Yup. All right.
Good.
Oh, look at that.
You must be
the beautiful wife.
Beautiful?
Oh! 
Stop it.
Sweet talker.
How is my brother
finding a wife like you
when he is so bald?


I'm joking!


These must be
my nieces!
You're Agnes!
You are small
with big eyes.
And it makes me wanna
put you into my pocket.
You can't do that!
I'm too big.
Edith! I can tell
that you are
a little mischievous.
We're gonna have
to make a little
trouble later.
I already have!

Ow! Ow! Please!
Why are you
doing that? Ow!
Fist bump for
mischievous
behavior!
And Margo.
Oh, you are so mature!
I'm guessing...
Mmm... 15?
She's 12. She looks 12
and will always be 12.
So, Dru, this place
is amazing!
I mean, you just walk through
the doors and you're like...

Oh, it's nice,
I guess, sure.
I'm not really into things.
This is so cool!
Look at that!
Oh, my gosh!
He's even got a helicopter!
This is the best!
Yes, the best!
All right,
let's go home now.
Home? Why?
I don't know.
This guy with
the mansion and the cars
and all of the hair,
with the silky smooth,
luxurious hair.
I feel worse than
I did before I came.
But he's your
brother, Gru.
Give this a chance.
Oh, I was thinking,
while Gru and I
catch up on
some brother stuff,
you girls should
go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you!
Yay!
Awesome!
I love surprises!
Oh, this is perfect!
Motherdaughter
bonding time.
Let's do it!
Wootwoot!
Bye! You boys
have fun!
Whoopi!
Now you can be as
evil as Balthazar Bratt 
with the Evil Bratt
action figure. 
Featuring musicactivated
breakdance mode. 
Also featuring
bubblegumlaunching
shoulder pads! 
And the allnew
Mega Diamond Laser! 
No more math! 
I've been a bad boy! 

The Mega Diamond
Laser does not actually
incinerate books. 
How could
Hollywood cancel a show
that produced toys
like this, Clive?
Evil Bratt was
a masterpiece!
Does no one value
true art anymore?
It's a disgrace
and a travesty, sir.
Well, now that
I've got the diamond,
it's payback time.
Oh, it's too bad Gru
won't be around
to try and stop me.
Oh, wait! No, it's not.
I hate that dweeb!
And you, Hollywood!
This time, I'm canceling you
and all the losers
who rejected me!

Oh, piggy, piggy!
So, how are
things going for
you careerwise?
Great!
So, so great!
Crushing it.
Well, I've got
something that I think
you will find
very interesting.
Hold onto your
face, brother.




Yeehaw!
Yah, yah!



Ow!




Come on!
Come on!


What is all this?
The pig farm
was just a cover for
the real family business.


Now, feast
your eyes on
Dad's lair!
Tada!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
So, our dad was a villain?
No, no, no,
not just a villain.
One of the greatest
of all time!
He was known as
the Bald Terror!
That's him? Our dad?
He was so proud of you.
And what a great
villain you were.
He was?
But me, eh,
not so much.
To Dad, I was
just a failure.
He never thought
I had what it took
to be a villain.
But now, you can
help me prove
him wrong!
Brother,
teach me
the art of villainy!
No.
No, no, no.
I can't do that.
What? 
But it's our
family tradition!
You can't say
no to that!
Look, I'm sorry.
I left that life behind me.
End of story.
Oh.
Okay. I understand.
Hmm! I wonder
what this does.

Holy moley!
Dad's villain wheels!
Pretty slick, huh?
Hey, you wanna take
her out for a spin?
Just for some fun?
Mmm!

Oh, oh, oh! Look out!



What a beautiful day!
Zero to 400
in three seconds.
Able to withstand
a nuclear blast.
Armed to the teeth.

Okay, that's pretty nice.
And it's a hybrid.
Look out!




Help me!
I am not enjoying this.


Whoa! What is
going on here?
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese
Festival.
Go!

Look, look!
Look at all the candies!
Whoa!
Eep, eep, eep!
Lucy, can we
get these?
Please.
Okay, but only
one each. I mean it.
Aw!
Oh, man!
No, I don't. 
Get as many as you
want. I don't care.
Yay! Awesome!
Uh...
What?
Well, it's okay to
tell them no sometimes,
too, you know?
Moms need to be tough.
Right, right.
Tough. Good one.
I can totally do that.
You know, still
figuring out this
mom thing.
Gettin' my sea legs,
matey!

It's a unicorn!
Can we go in there?
Please, please, please!

Um... Sure! Yeah!
You know,
but first let's...
Um... 
Oh, look!
It's a traditional
Freedonian dance.
How amazing does that look?

Say, say, say cheese! 
Cheese! I love this.
The little girls go
and get the cheese
from the little boys.
That's adorable!
Aw, look at that
poor little guy.
With his little boots.
Nobody picked him.
Oh, Margo, why don't
you go up there?
No way!
Okay.
Wait a minute.
No!
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.
Right now!
What?
I'm being tougher,
you know?
Like you said.
No! I meant be
tougher on them.
Not me!
Oh, come on, just do it.
What's the worst
that could happen?
Mmm...
Fine.

Wow!
Hey, there.
I'm Margo.
Hello, Margo!
I am Niko.
Would you like
some of my cheese?
Mmm...

Say, say, say cheese! 
Yes! Thank you, Margo.
Thank you! 
Bam! I am
a great mother!

Did you see that, girls?
I laid down the...
Oh, no! Where are they?
Oh... Agnes? Edith?
Hello.

Look!
A unicorn horn!
My little brain is
going to explode!

Agnes, that's fake.

It's real,
all right.

That horn came from
the Crooked Forest.
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

Huh!

Laugh, laugh,
all of you.

They all think
I'm crazy.
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.
With my own eye.
Wait, wait, wait.
You saw
a forreal live unicorn?
What did it look like?

Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?
Was it fluffy?
It was so fluffy,
I thought
I was gonna die.
Mmm! Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?
Oh! They say if a maiden
pure of heart
goes into
the Crooked Forest,
the unicorn will
come and be hers.
Forever.
Hmm...


Agnes!

Goal!
Excuse me.

Girls, don't worry.
I'm here.

Are you okay?
Yeah, we're fine.
Are you?
Unicorns are really real!
And I'm gonna
find one!

Sorry. Went a little
mama bear on ya.
You know,
I heard a scream and...

Yeah, okay,
have a good one.
Wait for me here.
Stop that!
Ah! You kicked me.

Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?
Did you just
steal candies?
Yes!
That's a lot of
effort for
two lollipops.



Oh, no! The police!
What do we do?
What do we do?
Come on!
This is gonna be fun!

The police are gonna
get us! 
I'm freaking out!
Pigs!
Cops!




Whoa! They're back!
All right!


Oh, man,
that was crazy!
We were so close
to getting busted.
Tell me about it.
I thought you
were going to
pee your pants.
I did!
You did!




Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

Hey! What are
you doing?
Intruders! Intruders!
There they are! Stop!

Hey, you, don't move!
Halt!

Call for backup!




Ooh, uh...





Get 'em! Go! Go!




Hey, you!
Freeze! Don't move!
Hands in the air!

Face it, Gru.
Villainy is
in your blood.
You can't tell me
you don't miss the rush.
A little?
Uh...
Eh, maybe a little.

And now you've got
the chance to get
back on top.
Get your mojo back.
Become Gru again.
How awesome
would that be?
Hmm.
Oh, please, come on.
Just one heist.
There's got to be
something out there,
somewhere
that you still
wanna steal.

Huh.
There is something.

How about we steal
the largest diamond
in the world?
Yes! I love it!

Oh, thank you, brother!
Thank you from
the bottoms of my heart.

Oh, you know what?
We should do something
to celebrate!
Oh!
I've got
the perfect idea.

Fritz, my good fellow,
could you get me
another napkin, please?
Ah, yes.
Of course, Miss Edith.



Hey, where are
Gru and Dru?
Here we are!
Oh, how's it going?

It's me! Gru.
And me, Dru.
I hug everybody
whether they like
it or not.
Why are they
pretending to be
each other?

Ah! What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.
I'm so grumpy
all the time. Hmm.
I laugh a lot.
And I'm kind of an idiot!



Oh, I'm busting a gut!
Look at them!
They had no idea!
Total burn.
Oh, look, it's me, Gru!
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!
Oh, it's so nice to see
you two are getting along.
Oh, we're getting...
Along perfectly.
Wait. Did we...
Just finish...
Each...
Other's...
Sentences?
Sentences?

Oh, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.
And you're gonna
stop now though,
right?
Sorry, it's
a twin thing.
Uhhuh...
So, uh, what did
you guys do today?

Nothing.
Okay.
What does it...
All done!

Pardon me!
Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!
Hey! Hey!
Put the brakes on.
What's the rush?
I need to get to bed
so I can wake up
and find a unicorn!
Good night!
What was that about?
Agnes thinks she's gonna
find a real unicorn in
the woods tomorrow.
She's totally
freaking out.
I feel like someone's
gotta tell her the truth.
Not it!
Oh, don't worry.
Parenting 101. I got this.
Um...
And please bless that
when I find the unicorn
he'll want to
come home with me,
and sleep in my room.
And that I can ride him
to school every day.
And he'll use
his magical powers
to help me do math.
Amen.

Oh, hi, Gru.
Hey. So, big day tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm finally
gonna get to see
a unicorn. For reals.
If I do,
can I bring it home?
Please?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Tell you what,
every unicorn you find,
you can bring it home.
I'd better build
a big pen, right?
But, you know,
there's a chance that
you might not find one.
Huh?

It might not be good
unicornfinding weather.
Um... They're tricky
to find them.
And I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe unicorns
don't really
explore that
part of the woods.


But the man said
a maiden could find one
if she was pure in heart.
And I'm pure
in heart, right?
The purest.

Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.
Good night, sweetie.
Good night, Gru.

Unicorns, I love them 
Unicorns, I love them 
Huh! 

I'm okay.

Hey! Give
that back!

Oh, no! Run!


We've been waiting
a long time. Can we...
No!

No, please!

Gru?
Uhoh!

Ha!




Huh? 


Because
I'm training for the big day 
Nobody's gonna stop me 
'Cause I am super sassy 
Super sassy, super sassy 
What's today's
plan, boss?
What's the plan?

Silly robot.
I'll show you
the plan!
Time to watch
a very special episode
of Evil Bratt 
to see exactly
what I'm gonna do
to stupid Tinseltown.
This week on Evil Bratt...

It's a giant
Evil Bratt robot! 
Open fire! 
I have him
in my sights! 
Nice try, coppers!
Chew on this! 

He's shooting
his super sticky, 
selfinflating gum! 
Run! 
Gum one, gum all! 


"Gum one, gum all."
Seriously, how did
this show never
win an Emmy?
And now,
it's your turn to shine,
my diamond! 
Hey, Clive.
I guess you could
say our plan was 
out of this world! 

Now, that's
entertainment!
Come on!
Let's make it a reality!
Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest 
in search of
the mythical unicorn. 
For some reason. 
And here she is!
The fearless
unicorn hunter seeking... 
Edith, stop it! 
You're gonna scare
away the unicorn.
If, somehow,
we actually
find a unicorn,
I'm gonna film it
and get rich.

Look over there!
Whoa!
This is it!
This is where we're
gonna see it.
Unicorns, here we come.
What's that for?
Bait! Duh.
Come on!

Now, all we have
to do is wait.
Okay, this is Bratt's lair.
It may not look like much,
but this place is
armed with some of
the most hightech
weaponry known to man.
It's considered
impenetrable.
But a piece of cake
for us, right, brother?
Yes. This is not
like stealing lollipops.
Whoa!
His security system can
detect an air assault
from any direction.

Ouch! No! Ouch! 
Please, stop! Ouch! 

So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.
Next. Ah...
Then there are
these deadly spikes.
Geronimo! 
Covered with
enough poison
to blow your mind.
Literally.
Ouch! 

Ah, good to know.
So here's the plan.
You're the getaway driver.
So you'll
wait in the boat...
Wait, hold on!
Wait in the boat?
But I wanna be
in on the actions!
Dru, the getaway driver
is the most crucial part
of any plan.
Do you know how hard it is
doing nothing,
touching nothing
when all of that adrenaline
is coursing through your veins
and you must wait?
Can I count on you?
Yeah.
Ah, I guess so.
So, I'll climb up to
the cube and enter here.
Then once I'm inside,
find the diamond.
I've underestimated
Bratt before. It's not
going to be easy.
I think we can handle it.
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable!
Whoa! Ay, chihuahua! 
I call the black one.
It's go time!

Hello.
Oh, hi!
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.
I present you
with pig to confirm
my engagement
to your daughter.


Hey, what now?
What's going on?
Uh, remember little boots?
Hello, my
schmoopsie poo.
Whoa, hey!
He seems to
think you're engaged.

What? We're
not engaged.
Look, Niko, you seem
like a very nice boy
with a very nice pig.
Uh... But you're
not engaged.
Okay? It's not
happening.
I understand.
Who was I kidding?
A dumpling like me
with a goddess like you.
But I promise, I will
never forget you, Margo.
Never.
Oh, I'm pretty sure I won't
forget you either.
Bye. Bye, Niko.
Wow! That was crazy.
Whoa!
That was totally
humiliating.
Taking a bite of that
cheese was the stupidest
thing I've ever done.
Why did I listen
to you?
Right. But it's over
now, so...

Oh! Here we go.
Niko... 
You refuse my
son's engagement pig?
What?
May you and your
daughter die a slow death
and be buried
with onions.


All right, lady,
that's it!
Nobody...
Nobody curses
my daughter!
Ya got that?
Because if you
mess with Margo,
you mess with me!
And I promise,
you do not wanna
mess with me.
Do you understand me?

Yes. Yes.
Good.
Now get!

Look, Margo,
I think we just
need to... Oh.

Yes!

I have to tell Gru!


Can we go back now?
Already? Just
a couple more hours.
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

I don't understand.
I did exactly
what the man said.
You mean that
oneeyed scarfaced man
that everybody laughed at?
Yeah, it makes
no sense.
Look, Agnes,
maybe we're not...



Ooh, my whole life
has been building
to this moment.


Um... It's a...
Unicorn!


I can't believe it!
I'm gonna name
you Lucky!

Oh, Lucky, stop it!
Yeah, I'll let someone
else burst her bubble.
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling
a heist!
And that diamond will
make us the richest,
most powerful
villains in the world!
Right, brother?
Oh, right. Yep, yeah.
Bravo! Bravissimo! 
You're amazing!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.
And you were always
such a gentleman.
You did it!
You did it!
You got our jobs back!
What?
Oh, yeah, right. Sure.
Oh, look.
We're here!
I'm going in.
Take the wheel.

I still don't see why
I can't go with you.
Hey, hey!
We discussed this.
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.
Fine.
Haha!

Hey, brother!
What? I told you,
you are supposed to
stay with the boat!
Oh, I didn't think you
meant that literally.
What other way
could I have meant it?
All right.
Let's move.
Just follow my lead.
Got it. 
Whoa!
Help me!
Ow, ow, ow!
Oh, no! The poison spikes!
I'm gonna be impaled!


I'm okay.
I miss the minions.
Come on!


Coming.


Coming.

Come on.


It's a scanning
device.

Quick!
Camouflage mode.

Freeze!
And close your eyes!
And cover your mouth!


Okay, take my hand.



Haha! Follow me.




Haha!

Look out!


Oh, you were right. I should
have stayed in the boat.
My stomach feels all queasy.
I shouldn't have
eaten that pot pie.

Hey, hey, relax.
You're gonna be just fine.
I got your back.
Come on. This way.




Huh?
Hmm?









Looks like
it's right above us.
Okay, what do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?
No, come with me.




Dru, get off the bed!
Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy...
I can help.
No, no, no.
What? I can do it.
Don't! Don't! Don't!
Why, yes.
Yes, Molly Ringwald,
I will take you to the prom.

What? Who? Where? What?
Who's there? Who is there?



99 of red balloons 
Whoops! Almost forgot!

Over here.
Stay close.

What?
Dolls.
Looks like Bratt
was the only one
stupid enough
to buy this junk.
Oh, I used to have
one of these!


Ow!
Hey! Shh! Come on.
All right.
We're getting close.
From now on,
every move must be made
with total
precision and purpose.

Gum!
Focus!
We're after the diamond,
not the bubblegum.
Got it!
Mmm. Yum.
This way!
And now,
to put this where
it belongs.

What...
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us!

Spit it out!
Spit it out! I told you
not to touch anything!


Intruders!
Intruders! Intruders!

Freeze, dipsticks!
Gru? There's two
of you now?
Then this will be
twice as much fun.

Gru.



Give me back
my diamond!
Total lockdown!

Oh!
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!


They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

Run!




Oh, no!
What does that mean?

Are we gonna die?
Are we gonna die?
We're gonna die! 
Dru!

What?
Hey, guys. Hold on!
Lucy!


Thank you for saving us.
Whoo!
Look! We got the diamond
and we're going to...
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back.

Wait!
What? Oh,
that's amazing!
And the best part is,
you'll never...

...ever go behind
my back...

...ever again,
right, honey bear?
Yeah! Yeah, right.

Lesson learned.
I'll get the girls
and start packing.
And tell them
the good news!
Ah!
We're getting
our jobs back. Yeah!
Yes! Yes!
Go tell the girls.
Dru...
No! No way! We can't
give the diamond back!
I have to.
No, you don't!
Yes, I do.
Give it!
No!
Give it! 
Ow!
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
You kicked me!
You... You lied to me!
Hey, I would have
told you the truth.
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.
That's it.
I'm out of here.
You have no right
to take that.
We stole it together.
Together?

You got to be
kidding me.
You did nothing but screw up
the whole time.
I got this in spite of you.
Oh, yeah? At least
I didn't get fired
from my job
like a total loser.
At least I had a job.
What have you accomplished
that was so great?
I'll tell you what. Nothing!
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

We are no
longer brothers.
That's fine with me.








Gru! I found
a unicorn!

My life is complete!

Honey, that's...
That's not actually
a unicorn.
Huh?
But, but, he has one horn.

I'm...
I'm sorry, sweetie...
but he's just a goat.

Life is just
like that sometimes.
We're hoping for a unicorn,
and we get a goat.

Well, you know what?
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!
Look at that face!
I just want to
squeeze it.
Mmm!
Whoohoo!
Whoo!
I'll take this.
You've been
a bad boy, Gru.
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?
Come on, girls.
Let's go!

Let's get physical, physical 


Change of plans, girls.

Instead of going home...
Eyebrows! Ow! 
We're going to Hollywood!


Now, that's what
I call acting.
Let's go,
Clive! We've got
a giant robot waiting!


Huh?

Lucy?

But...
Bratt! He took the girls!
What? No!
Dru! Dru!
Go away!
I don't wanna talk to you.
Bratt has the girls!

Listen, brother.
About
what I said...
No, I'm the one...
But I shouldn't have...
I'm... I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry, Gru.
Aw!
Ooh, look out!
What is that?






Mel?
Gru?







Hello, Hollywood!

I'm back and bigger than ever. 

I'm scared!
Thank you.
Thank you so... Oh!

No! No!
No, you can't
leave me here!
I'm famous!
Clive,
arm the canons.
Chew on this! 





Hey, mullet head!
Let us out!
Oh, don't worry,
girls. I've prepared
a front row seat for you.



Agnes!
Once again,
I win and Gru loses! 
Enjoy the show, girls. 

What in the heck?
Oh!
I hope the girls
are okay.
Bratt! Bratt at
nine o'clock...
No! Three o'clock!
He's on the left!
No!
I've seen this episode!
He's going to
bubblegum the whole city
and send it up into space!
Hurry!

This is it! This is it!
Lights! Camera!
Laser!

Yeah!

Look!
I've got the girls.
You two,
go take care of Bratt.
Wait! What are
you doing?

Look, you guys,
it's Lucy!
Lucy, over here!
Help! Help us!
Mama's comin', girls.
Lucy! Lucy!
We're up here!
Look at that laser go. 
I love it when
a plan comes together.

It's Gru!


Get ready, Bratt.
You're about to be
blasted back to the '80s!

Whoohoo!

We got him!


Oh, no!
Don't worry.
There's more
where that came from.
It'll take more
than that to stop me.
Bratt Pack,
go get that barf bag.


Oh, incoming!

You little...
Get away!
Get out of there!
Quick, jump!

Bonus!
Did you see that,
Clive? All gone.

Buhbye,
Wonder Twins.







Help!

Hang on!


Hang on, girls!
I've got you!
I can't! I'm slipping!


No!

Got ya!
Thank you, Lucy!
Let's go!
We're not safe yet.
Minions! 







Look at what we have here.
Sorry, Gru. This is
going to be a total burn!

Oh, no! No, no, no!
I've been a bad boy!


Nobody messes
with my brother!




What? What's happening? No!


Dru!
Hold on! I'm coming.


You've ruined
everything!
And now,
it's time to die.
Any last words, Gru?
You know what?
I got two words for you.
Dance fight.
Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong.
I am going to enjoy this.






Enough!

My turn!



Uhoh.



Game over! 
Is this what
you're looking for?
No!




No!
Curse you, Gru!

Curse you!


Dru? Dru?




Hey! We did it!
Yes, we did, brother.
Gru!
Uncle Dru!
Gru!
Girls!






Gru!
Hey, Mel. Welcome back.


Mmm.
Love you, Mom.
I'm a mom. 
I'm a mom!







Boys, time for bed!
We're back at work
in the morning.

I'm coming, sweetie.
Good night, Lucy.
See you tomorrow,
brother.
Hey, I'm back on the job.
So no villainy tonight,
huh? Got it?
I make no promises.
Love you!
Uhhuh. Right.

I love you, too.
Aw!
"Aw!" All right, every...
Go! Go! Go to bed!


Hey! Guys! Come on!

What...
What is happening?
It's coming
from outside!

Hey! I thought we
said no more villainy!
Sorry, brother!
Somebody's gotta keep
the family tradition alive,
right?


Let's get him.
Ugh.
Honey,
he's my brother.
We'll give him
a fiveminute
head start.
