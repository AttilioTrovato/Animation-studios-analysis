Out there
There's a world outside of Yonkers 
Way out there
beyond this hick town, Barnaby 
There's a slick town, Barnaby 
Out there
Full of shine and full of sparkle 
Close your eyes
and see it glisten, Barnaby 
Listen, Barnaby 
Put on your Sunday clothes
There's lots of world out there 
Get out the brilliantine
and dime cigars 
We're gonna find adventure
in the evening air 
Girls in white in a perfumed night 
Where the lights are
bright as the stars 
Put on your Sunday clothes
We're gonna ride through town 
In one of those new
horsedrawn open cars 
We'll see the shows at Delmonico's 
And we'll close the town in a whirl 
And we won't come home
until we've kissed a girl 
... ride through town 
In one of those new

We'll see the shows

And we won't come home

Oh!
Huh.
Buy N Large is your superstore 
We got all you need
and so much more 
Too much garbage in your face? 
There's plenty of space out in space! 
BNL star liners leaving each day. 
We'll clean up the mess while you're away! 
The jewel of the BNL fleet, the Axiom. 
Spend your fiveyear cruise in style, 
waited on 24 hours a day
by our fully automated crew, 
while your captain and autopilot 
chart a course for nonstop
entertainment, fine dining, 
and with our allaccess hoverchairs,
even Grandma can join the fun. 
There's no need to walk. 
The Axiom.
Putting the star in executive star liner. 
Because at BNL,
space is the final funtier! 
No Monday in your Sunday 
No Monday in your
Sunday clothes 
Put on your Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out 
Strut down the street
and have your picture took 
Dressed like a dream
Your spirits seem to turn about 
That Sunday shine is a certain sign 
Ohho!
That you feel as fine as you look 
And we'll recall 
Wow!
When time runs out 
Ahh.
Whoa.
That it only 
took a moment 
to be loved 
a whole life 
long 
And that is all 
that love's about 
Uhoh.
Oh...

Who are you?
Who are you?
Hold me close and hold me fast 
The magic spell you cast 
This is la vie en rose 
When you kiss me heaven sighs 
And though I close my eyes 
I see la vie en rose 
Whoa!
When you press me to your heart 
I'm in a world apart 
A world where roses bloom 
And when you speak
Angels sing from above 
Everyday words seem
to turn into love songs 
Hmm.
Uhoh.

Strut down the street

That Sunday shine is a certain sign 
That you feel as fine as you look

Your beads and buckles and bows

I've been in my cabin all morning,
so let's hover over to the driving range
and hit a few virtual balls into space.
No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.
Well, then what do you want to do?
I don't know. Something.
Whoa!
Look, I'm tired of having
the same argument over and over.
Bot, over here.
Whoa!
I'm in a tunnel. I can't hear you.
There you are.
Buy N Large. 
Everything you need to be happy. 
Your day is very important to us. 
Hey, drinkbot.
Here, take the cup. Hey, take the cup!
Whoa!
Uhoh.
Please remain stationary. 
A servicebot will be here
to assist you momentarily. 
Stewards! Hello!
Please remain stationary.
Help. 
A servicebot will be here
to assist you momentarily. 
What's that? What's going on?
WALLE.
Uh...
John.
EVE?
Uh, no. John.
EVE!
Bye, WALLE.
"A" is for Axiom, your home sweet home. 
"B" is for Buy N Large, your very best friend. 
Mmm! 
Time for lunch in a cup. 
Feel beautiful. 
It's the new you. Stunning.
You look great.
I know, honey. Men.
Men.
Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue. 
It's the new red. 
Ooh!
Love blue.
Date?
Don't get me started on the date.
Every holodate I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.
If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.
There are no good men out there.
I know. I know because I've...
What the...
Whoa!
Huh?
Yoohoo. WALLE.
Uh...

Huh? Oh!
Oh! Oh. Um, sure. You go ahead.

I didn't know we had a pool!
Captain, you are needed on the bridge.
All hands on deck!
Morning.
Just a trim?
... find adventure in the evening air 
Uhhuh.
I see. I know, honey. I know.
I'm good, I am good.
You look gorgeous.
Oh!

Okay, Auto. 
Sir, the annual reconnaissance...
Auto, why didn't you wake me
for morning announcements?
Honestly, it's the one thing
I get to do on this ship.
Well, good morning, everybody, 
and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. 
As always, the weather is a balmy
72 degrees and sunny and... 
Oh, I see the ship's log is showing
that today is our 700th anniversary 
of our fiveyear cruise. 
Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
proud to know that 700 years later 
we'd be doing the exact same thing
they were doing. 
Fore!
So, be sure next mealtime to ask for your "free
" septuacentennial
cupcake in a cup."
Wow, look at that!
Also today we have a...
Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?
Captain, Probe One has returned positive.
Positive?
EVE.
But no probe's
ever come back positive before.
Buy N Large 
Greetings and congratulations, Captain. 
If you are seeing this, 
that means your
Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, 
or EVE probe, has returned from Earth 
with a confirmed specimen
of ongoing photosynthesis. 
That's right. It means it's time
to go back home. 
Home? We're going back?
Now that Earth has been restored
to a lifesustaining status, 
by golly, we can begin Operation Recolonize. 
Simply follow this manual's instructions 
to place the plant
in your ship's holodetector 
and the Axiom will immediately
navigate your return to Earth. 
It's that easy.
Huh! 
Now, due to the effects of microgravity, 
you and your passengers may have suffered some 
slight bone loss. 
But I'm sure a few laps
around the ship's jogging track 
will get you back in shape in no time. 
We have a jogging track?
If you have any further questions, 
just consult your operation manual. 
See you back home real soon. 
"Operate Manuel."
Uh...
Manuel, relay instructions.
Manuel?
Wow. Will you look at that?
Let's see.
Huh?
EVE.
WALLE!
EVE.
Well, let's open her up.
"Step one.
Voice command, 'Confirm acquisition.'"
"Step one.
Voice command, 'Confirm acquisition.'"
Confirm acquisition.
Ooh! 
Voice authorization required. 
Uh...
Uh... 
Accepted. 
Ooh.
Where's the thingy?
Plant.
Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?
Maybe we missed a step.
Show me how you change...
Plant.
Okay.
WALLE.
WALLE!
EVE?
Plant!
Why don't you scan her to be sure?
Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.
So then, we're not going to Earth?
Negative.
I guess things go back to normal, huh?
Correct, Captain.
Well, false alarm!
False alarm. 
The probe must be defective.
GO4, send her to the repair ward,
and have them run diagnostics on her.
Make sure she's not...
Ah!
WALLE.
Have, uh, WALLE cleaned.
Yoohoo!
EVE.
Analyze.
Analysis.
Foreign contaminant. 
Substance is a threephase system 
composed of various combinations
of naturally derived solids. 
Subject is most commonly referred to
as soil, dirt, or earth. 
"Earth"?
Hmm.
Define "earth."
Earth, the surface of the world 
as distinct from the sky or sea. 
Wow.
Define "sea."
Sea, an expanse of salt water 
that covers most of the Earth's surface
and surrounds its landmasses. 
Foreign contaminant.
Whoa!

Whoa!
Just a trim?
You look gorgeous.

Hey! What the...
Look! Look at that.
Huh? What?
Hey. I know that guy. It's, uh, WALLE.
Hey, WALLE! It's your buddy John.
Hi, WALLE!
Hi.
Hi.
Define "hoedown."
Hoedown, a social gathering 
at which lively dancing would take place. 
Auto, Earth is amazing!
These are called "farms."
Humans would put seeds
in the ground, pour water on them,
and they grow food, like pizza.
Good night, Captain.
Psst! Computer.
Define "dancing."
Dancing, a series of
movements involving two partners 
where speed and rhythm
match harmoniously with music. 
Uhhuh. Uh...
EVE.
Home.
Uhoh.
The lido deck is now
closing. The lido deck is now closing. 
Stop that.
Make me.
I didn't know we had a pool.
No splashing. No diving.
Oh, go on.
No splashing. No...
EVE.
... it only takes a moment 
Shh!
Directive.
Prepare for landing.
"We're here, everybody."
"Yay, Captain! Captain, we're home!
It's so beautiful!"
"No. It's nothing.
I was pleased to do this.
"It's all about you people.
It's not about me."
How?
How did you find it?
We can go back home!
For the first time!
What's it like now?
Oh!
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
I want to see for myself.
Wait. That doesn't look like Earth.
Where's the blue sky?
Where's the grass?
... Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out 
I know that song.
Strut down the street
and have your picture took 
They're, um,
dancing.
Yes, dancing.
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look 
Beneath your parasol... 
You made it somehow, huh, little guy?
You didn't give up, did you?
Okay, then. Come on.
Wait a minute.
... when time runs out 
That it only... 
Huh?
EVE? 
EVE! 
Uhoh! 
WALLE.
EVE.
EVE.
EVE.
Pathetic.
EVE.
EVE!
Oh!
Huh?
Foreign contaminant.
There you go, little guy.
You came a long way for a drink of water.
Just needed someone to look after you, that's...
We have to go back.
Auto, come down here.
Aye, aye, sir. 
WALLE.
WALLE.
Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holodetector. 
Not necessary, Captain.
You may give it to me.
You know what? I should do it myself.
Captain.
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
Auto, get out of my way.
We cannot go home.
What are you talking about? Why not?
That is classified, Captain.
Give me the plant.
What do you mean, "classified"?
You don't keep a secret from the captain.
Give me the plant.
Tell me what's classified.
The plant.
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.
Aye, aye, sir.
Buy N Large is your superstore
We got all you need 
Just cut it off, will you? 
Hey, there, autopilots.
Got some bad news. 
Um... 
Operation Cleanup has, 
well, failed. 
Wouldn't you know,
rising toxicity levels have made life 
unsustainable on Earth. 
"Unsustainable"? What?
Darn it all, we're going to have
to cancel Operation Recolonize. 
So, 
just stay the course. 
Um... 
Rather than try and fix this problem, 
it'll just be easier
for everyone to remain in space. 
"Easier"?
Huh?
Sir, time to go. 
Okay. I'm giving
Override Directive A 113. 
Go to full autopilot. 
Take control of everything,
and do not return to Earth. 
Repeat, do not return to Earth. 
Let's get the heck out of here. 
Now, the plant.
No. Wait a minute.
Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom? 
Message received in the year 2110. 
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.
It's living proof he was wrong.
Irrelevant, Captain.
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.
Home, Auto.
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.
That's all I've ever done.
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!
On the Axiom you will survive. 
I don't want to survive. I want to live!
Must follow my directive.
I'm the captain of the Axiom. 
We are going home today.
GO4?
Hey! That's not...
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holodetector.
No!
Huh?
EVE?
WALLE!
EVE!
Oh!
WALLE, the plant!
WALLE!
Over here. Throw it.
Ahhh!
EVE!
Give me the plant.
WALLE!
All communications are terminated.
You are confined to quarters.
No! Mutiny!

The plant!
We'll see who's powerless now.
Testing, testing.
Is this thing on? 
This is the captain.
I am locked in my room. 
EVE, WALLE,
bring the plant to the lido deck. 
I'll have activated the holodetector.
Now, hurry. 
Auto's probably going to cut me off...
Halt. 
Ah!
Halt.
Oh, my.
Clear.
Oh!
Halt, halt.
Look what I got, Auto.
Not possible. 
That's right. The plant.
You want it? Come and get it, blinky. 
No.
Captain? Captain?
Let go.
Let go.
Too heavy for you? Huh?
Get off.
You're not getting away
from me, oneeye.
Get off.
Is that all you got?
Halt.
That's it. A little closer.
Cease and desist.
Not good.
Got you.
Whoa!
Remain calm. Remain calm.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking. 
We're having a slight malfunction
with the autopilot. 
Please remain calm. 
Ah!
Enough.
Hey. What? John?
Whoa!
No! No, no, no!
I gotcha!
John, get ready to have some kids!
Look out!
Ah!
Oh!
No.
WALLE!

Uhoh.
Oh, no!

Auto, you are relieved of duty.
No.

WALLE?

And that is all 
That love's about 
Whee!
You're kidding!
Go, go, go. Go, go.
And we'll recall
When time runs out 
This is called farming!
You kids are going to grow all kinds of plants.
Vegetable plants. Pizza plants!
It's good to be home!
Took a moment 
to be loved 
a whole life 
long 
Did you think that your feet
had been bound 
By what gravity brings
to the ground? 
Did you feel you were tricked
by the future you picked? 
Well, come on down 
All these rules don't apply
When you're high in the sky 
So come on down 
Come on down 
We're coming down to the ground 
There's no better place to go 
We got snow up on the mountains 
We got rivers down below 
We're coming down to the ground 
We hear the birds sing in the trees 
And the land will be looked after 
We'll send the seeds
out in the breeze 
Did you think
you'd escaped from routine 
By changing the script
and the scene? 
Despite all you made of it 
You're always afraid
of the change 
You've got a lot on your chest 
Well, you can come as my guest 
So come on down 
Come on down 
We're coming down to the ground 
There's no better place to go 
We got snow up on the mountains 
We got rivers down below 
We're coming down to the ground 
We hear the birds sing in the trees 
And the land will be looked after 
We'll send the seeds
out in the breeze 
Like the fish in the ocean 
We felt at home in the sea 
We learned to live off the good land 
We learned to climb up a tree 
Then we got up on two legs 
But we wanted to fly 
And when we messed up
our homeland 
We set sail for the sky 
We're coming down to the ground 
There's no better place to go 
We got snow up on the mountains 
We got rivers down below 
We're coming down to the ground 
We hear the birds sing in the trees 
And the land will be looked after 
We'll send the seeds
out in the breeze 
We're coming down 
Coming down to Earth 
Like babies at birth 
Coming down to Earth 
We define new priorities 
These are extraordinary qualities 
We're coming down to the ground 
There's no better place to go 
We got snow up on the mountains 
We got rivers down below 
We're coming down to the ground 
We hear the birds sing in the trees 
And the land will be looked after 
We send the seeds
out in the breeze 
We're coming down to the ground 
There's no better place to go 
We got snow up on the mountains 
We got rivers down below 
We're coming down to the ground 
We hear the birds sing in the trees 
And the land will be looked after 
We send the seeds
out in the breeze 
We define new priorities 
These are
extraordinary qualities 
To find on Earth
