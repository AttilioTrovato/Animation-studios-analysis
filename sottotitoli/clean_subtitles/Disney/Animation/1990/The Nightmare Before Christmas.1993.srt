'Twas a long time ago,
longer now than it seems,
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.
For the story that you
are about to be told...
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun.
Boys and girls 
of every age 
Wouldn't you like to see 
something strange 
Come with us 
and you will see 
This, our town 
of Halloween 
This is Halloween 
This is Halloween 
Pumpkins scream 
in the dead of night 
This is Halloween 
Everybody make a scene 
Trick or treat till the 
neighbor's gonna die of fright 
It's our town 
Everybody scream 
In this town 
of Halloween 
I am the one hiding 
under your bed 
Teeth ground sharp 
and eyes glowing red 
I am the one hiding 
under your stairs 
Fingers like snakes 
and spiders in my hair 
This is Halloween 
This is Halloween 
Halloween, Halloween 
Halloween, Halloween 
In this town 
we call home 
Everyone hail 
to the pumpkin song 
In this town 
Don't we love it now 
Everybody's waiting 
for the next surprise 
'Round that corner, man 
Hiding in the trash can 
Something's waiting now to 
pounce and how you'll scream 
This is Halloween 
Red and black 
Slimy green 
Aren't you scared 
Well, that's just fine 
Say it once, say it twice 
Take a chance 
and roll the dice 
Ride with the moon 
in the dead of night 
Everybody scream 
Everybody scream 
In our town 
of Halloween 
I am the clown 
with the tearaway face 
Here in a flash 
and gone without a trace 
I am the "who" when you call 
"Who's there?" 
I am the wind blowing 
through your hair 
I am the shadow 
on the moon at night 
Filling your dreams 
to the brim with fright 
This is Halloween 
This is Halloween 
Halloween, Halloween 
Halloween, Halloween 
Tender Lumplings 
everywhere 
Life's no fun 
without a good scare 
That's our job 
But we're not mean 
In our town 
of Halloween 
In this town 
Don't we love it now 
Everyone's waiting 
for the next surprise 
Skeleton Jack 
might catch you in the back 
And scream like a banshee 
Make you jump out of your skin 
This is Halloween 
Everybody scream 
Won't ya please make way 
for a very special guy 
Our man Jack is king 
of the pumpkin patch 
Everyone hail 
to the Pumpkin King now 
This is Halloween 
This is Halloween 
Halloween, Halloween 
Halloween, Halloween 
In this town 
we call home 
Everyone hail 
to the pumpkin song 
La la la la la la 
Halloween, Halloween 
La la la la la la 
Halloween, Halloween 
La la la la la la 
Halloween, Halloween 
La la la la la la 
Whee 
Whee!
It's over!
We did it!
Wasn't it terrifying?
What a night!
Great Halloween,
everybody.
I believe it was
our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.
No. Thanks
to you, Jack.
Without your brilliant leadership__
Not at all, Mayor.
You're such a scream, Jack!
You're a witch's
fondest dream.
You made walls fall, Jack.
"Walls fall"? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.
The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.
Let go.
You're not ready for much excitement.
Yes, I am.
You're coming with me.
No, I'm not!
Come back here,
you foolish__
Ow! Oh. Oh!
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hold it!
We haven't given out the prizes yet.
Our first award
goes to the vampires...
for most blood drained
in a single evening.
Our second
and honorable mention...
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon Leeches.
Nice work, Bone Daddy.
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year.
And the year before that,
and the year before that.
There are few who deny 
At what I do 
I am the best 
For my talents 
are renowned far and wide 
When it comes to surprises 
in the moonlit night 
I excel without ever 
even trying 
With the slightest 
little effort 
Of my ghostlike charms 
I have seen grown men 
give out a shriek 
With a wave of my hand 
And a wellplaced moan 
I have swept the very bravest 
off their feet 
Yet year after year 
it's the same routine 
And I grow so weary 
of the sound of screams 
And I, Jack 
the Pumpkin King 
Have grown so tired 
of the same old thing 
Oh, somewhere deep 
Inside of these bones 
An emptiness 
Began to grow 
There's something 
out there 
Far from my home 
A longing that 
I've never known 
I'm the master of fright 
And a demon of light 
And I'll scare you 
right out of your pants 
To a guy in Kentucky 
I'm Mr. Unlucky 
And I'm known throughout 
England and France 
And since I am dead 
I can take off my head 
To recite Shakespearean 
quotations 
No animal nor man 
can scream like I can 
With the fury 
of my recitations 
But who here 
Would ever understand 
That the Pumpkin King 
with the skeleton grin 
Would tire of his crown 
If they only understood 
He'd give it all up 
if he only could 
Oh, there's an empty 
Place in my bones 
That calls out for 
Something unknown 
The fame and praise 
Come year after year 
Does nothing for 
These empty tears 
Jack.
I know how you feel.
Sally.
You've come back.
I had to.
For this.
Yes.
Shall we, then?
That's twice this month you've slipped
deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.
Three times.
You're mine, you know.
I made you
with my own hands.
You can make
other creations.
I'm restless.
I can't help it.
It's a phase, my dear.
It'll pass.
We need to be patient,
that's all.
But I don't want
to be patient.
No, Zero.
Not now.
I'm not in the mood.
All right.
Here you go, boy.
Mornin', gents.
Jack?
You home?
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.
Jack, please, I'm only
an elected official here.
I can't make decisions
by myself.
Jack!
Answer me!
He's not home.
Where is he?
He hasn't been home all night.
Where are we?
It's someplace new.
What is this?
Whoa!
Whoa!
What's this? What's this? 
There's color everywhere 
What's this 
There's white things in the air 
What's this? I can't believe my eyes 
I must be dreaming 
Wake up, Jack! This isn't fair 
What's this 
Lalalalalalala 
What's this, What's this 
There's something very wrong 
What's this, there's people 
singing songs, what's this 
The streets are lined with 
little creatures laughing 
Everybody seems so happy 
Have I possibly gone daffy 
What is this 
What's this 
There's children throwing snowballs 
instead of throwing heads 
They're busy building toys 
And absolutely no one's dead 
There's frost in every window 
Oh, I can't believe my eyes 
And in my bones 
I feel the warmth 
That's coming 
from inside 
Oh, look, what's this 
They're hanging mistletoe They kiss 
Why, that looks so unique 
Inspired 
They're gathering around 
to hear a story 
Roasting chestnuts on a fire 
What's this 
What's this in here 
They've got a little tree How queer 
And who would ever think 
And why 
They're covering it 
with tiny little things 
They've got electric 
lights on strings 
And there's a smile on everyone, 
so now correct me if I'm wrong 
This looks like fun 
This looks like fun 
Oh, could it be I got my wish 
What's this 
Oh my, what now 
The children are asleep 
But look 
There's nothing underneath 
No ghouls, no witches here to scream 
and scare them or ensnare them 
Only little cozy things 
Secure inside 
their dreamland 
What's this 
The monsters are all missing 
and the nightmares can't be found 
And in their place there seems 
to be good feeling all around 
Instead of screams, I swear 
I can hear music in the air 
The smell of cakes and pies 
are absolutely everywhere 
The sights, the sounds 
They're everywhere and all around 
I've never felt 
so good before 
This empty place 
inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough 
I want it Oh, I want it 
Oh, I want it for my own 
I've got to know, I've got to know 
what is this place that I have found 
What is this 
Christmas Town?
Hmm.
Hohohoho!
Hohohoho!
Hmm.
This has never happened before.
It's suspicious.
It's peculiar.
It's scary.
Stand aside. Coming through.
We've got to find Jack!
There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?
I looked in every mausoleum.
We opened the sarcophagi!
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.
I peeked behind
the Cyclops' eye.
I did,
but he wasn't there.
It's time to sound
the alarms!
Frog's breath will
overpower any odor.
Oh!
Bitter!
Worm's wart. WhWhere's
that worm's wart?
Sally!
Is that soup
ready yet?
Ah.
Coming!
Lunch!
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart!
Mmm!
And frog's breath.
WhWhat's wrong?
II thought you
like frog's breath.
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.
I'm not hungry.
Oops.
You want me to starve.
An old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mmm! See?
Scrumptious!
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?
This morning.
Hear that? Shh.
What?
Zero!
Jack's back!
Yea!
Jack's back!
Where have you been?
Call a town meeting
and I'll tell everyone all about it!
When?
Immediately!
Town meeting!
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Town meeting!
Town meeting
tonight!
Listen, everyone.
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.
There were objects 
so peculiar 
They were not 
to be believed 
All around things 
to tantalize my brain 
It's a world unlike 
anything I've ever seen 
And as hard as I tried 
I can't seem to describe 
Like a most 
improbable dream 
But you must believe 
when I tell you this 
It's as real as my skull 
and it does exist 
Here, let me show you.
Ooh!
This is a thing 
called a present 
The whole thing starts with a box 
A box 
Is it steel 
Are there locks 
Is it filled with a pox 
A pox How delightful, a pox 
If you please.
Just a box with 
bright colored paper 
And the whole thing's 
topped with a bow 
A bow 
But why 
How ugly! What's in it 
What's in it 
That's the point of the thing 
Not to know 
It's a bat 
Will it bend 
It's a rat 
Will it break 
Perhaps it's the head 
that I found in the lake 
Listen now 
You don't understand 
That's not the point 
of Christmasland 
Now pay attention 
We pick up 
an oversized sock 
And hang it like this 
on the wall 
Oh, yes, does it 
still have a foot 
Let me see, let me look 
Is it rotted and covered with gook 
Um, let me explain.
There's no foot inside 
but there's candy 
Or sometimes it's filled 
with small toys 
Small toys, do they bite 
or explode in the sack 
Do they snap 
Perhaps they just spring out 
and scare girls and boys 
What a splendid idea 
This Christmas sounds fun 
I fully endorse it 
Let's try it at once 
Everyone, please 
Now not so fast 
There's something here 
that you don't quite grasp 
I don't know.
Do you get it?
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.
And the best I must confess 
I have saved for the last 
For the ruler 
of this Christmasland 
Is a fearsome king 
with a deep, mighty voice 
Least, that's what 
I've come to understand 
And I've also heard it told 
that he's something to behold 
Like a lobster 
Huge and red 
When he sets out to slay 
with his rain gear on 
Carting bulging sacks 
with his big, great arms 
That is, 
so I've heard it said 
And on a dark, cold night 
Under full moonlight 
He flies into a fog like 
a vulture in the sky 
And they call him 
Sandy Claws 
Well, at least 
they're excited 
But they don't 
understand 
That special kind 
of feeling 
In Christmasland 
Oh, well.
Hmm.
Hmm.
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.
You've poisoned me for the last time,
you wretched girl.
Oh, my head!
The door is open!
Hello?
Jack Skellington!
Up here, my boy.
Doctor, I need to borrow
some equipment.
Is that so?
Whatever for?
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.
How perfectly
marvelous.
Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
I know.
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.
Hmm.
Experiments?
Zero, I'm home.
Interesting reaction.
But what does it mean?
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.
Sally?
Sally?
Oh! Gone again!
Hmm.
Oh!
Something's up with Jack 
Something's up with Jack 
Don't know if we're ever 
going to get him back 
He's all alone up there 
Locked away inside 
Never says a word 
Hope he hasn't died 
Something's up with Jack 
Something's up with Jack 
Christmastime 
is buzzing in my skull 
Will it let me be 
I cannot tell 
There's so many things 
I cannot grasp 
When I think I've got it 
then at last 
Through my bony fingers 
it does slip 
Like a snowflake 
in a fiery grip 
Something here I'm not quite getting, 
though I try I keep forgetting 
Like a memory 
long since past 
Here in an instant 
Gone in a flash 
What does it mean 
What does it mean 
In these little 
bricabrac 
A secret's waiting 
to be cracked 
These dolls and toys 
confuse me so 
Confound it all 
I love it though 
Simple objects 
Nothing more 
But something's hidden 
through a door 
Though I do not 
have the key 
Something's here 
I cannot see 
What does it mean 
What does it mean 
What does it mean 
Hmm. Hmm.
I've read these Christmas 
books so many times 
I know the stories 
and I know the rhymes 
I know the Christmas carols 
all by heart 
My skull's so full 
It's tearing me apart 
As often as I've read them 
something's wrong 
So hard to put 
my bony finger on 
Or perhaps it's really not as deep 
as I've been led to think 
Am I trying 
much too hard 
Of course, I've been 
too close to see 
The answer's right in front of me 
Right in front of me 
It's simple really 
Very clear 
Like music drifting 
in the air 
Invisible 
but everywhere 
Just because 
I cannot see it 
Doesn't mean 
I can't believe it 
You know I think this Christmas thing 
is not as tricky as it seems 
And why should they have all the fun 
It should belong to anyone 
Not anyone, in fact 
but me 
Why, I can make 
a Christmas tree 
And there's no reason 
I can find 
I couldn't handle 
Christmastime 
I bet I could 
improve it too 
And that's exactly 
what I'll do 
Heeheeheeheehee!
Eureka!
This year...
Christmas will be ours!
Patience, everyone.
Jack has a special job
for each of us.
Dr. Finkelstein!
Your Christmas
assignment is ready.
Dr. Finkelstein, to
the front of the line.
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?
Perhaps it can be improved?
No problem.
I knew it!
Doctor!
Thank you for coming.
We need
some of these.
Hmm.
Their construction
should be exceedingly simple, I think.
How horrible
our Christmas will be.
No!
How jolly!
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.
What are you doing here?
Jack sent for us.
Specifically.
By name.
Lock.
Shock.
Barrel.
Jack!
Jack!
It's Boogie's boys.
Ah, Halloween's finest
trickortreaters.
The job I have for you
is top secret.
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.
And we thought you
didn't like us, Jack.
Absolutely no one is to know about it.
Not a soul!
Now...
...tree...
...Christmas Town...
Ow! Hmm.
And one more thing.
Leave that noaccount
Oogie Boogie out of this!
Whatever you say, Jack.
Of course, Jack.
Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws 
I want to do it 
Let's draw straws 
Jack said we should work together 
Three of a kind 
Birds of a feather 
Now and forever La la la la la la 
La lala la lala 
La lala lala 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
Lock him up real tight 
Throw away the key and then 
turn off all the lights 
First we're going to set some bait 
inside a nasty trap and wait 
When he comes asniffing we will 
snap the trap and close the gate 
Wait, I've got a better plan 
to catch this big red lobster man 
Let's pop him in a boiling pot and 
when he's done we'll butter him up 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
Throw him in a box 
Bury him for 90 years 
Then see if he talks 
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man 
Can take the whole thing 
over then 
He'll be so pleased 
I do declare 
That he will cook him rare 
Whee 
I say that we take a cannon 
aim it at his door and then 
Knock three times and when he answers 
Sandy Claws will be no more 
You're so stupid! Think now 
if we blow him up to smithereens 
We may lose some pieces and then 
Jack will beat us black and green 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
Tie him in a bag 
Throw him in the ocean 
Then see if he is sad 
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie 
is the meanest guy around 
If I were on his boogie list 
I'd get out of town 
He'll be so pleased 
by our success 
That he'll reward us too 
I'll bet 
Perhaps he'll make 
his special brew 
Of snake and spider stew 
Mmm!
We're his little henchmen and 
we take our job with pride 
We do our best to please him 
and stay on his good side 
I wish my cohorts 
weren't so dumb 
I'm not the dumb one 
You're no fun 
Shut up, I've got something 
Listen now 
Make me 
This one is real good 
You'll see 
We'll send a present 
to his door 
Upon there'll be 
a note to read 
Now in the box we'll wait and hide 
until his curiosity 
Entices him to look inside And then 
we'll have him! One, two, three 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
Beat him with a stick 
Lock him up for 90 years 
See what makes him tick 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
Chop him into bits 
Mr. Oogie Boogie 
is sure to get his kicks 
Kidnap the Sandy Claws 
See what we will see 
Lock him in a cage 
and then throw away 
The key 
Sandy Claws, huh?
It goes something
like this.
How about it?
Think you can manage?
Aone and atwo
and athree and a__
Next!
Fantastic!
Now, why don't you all practice
on that? And we'll be in great shape.
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.
That's splendid!
No! It was about your Christmas.
There was smoke and fire__
That's not my Christmas!
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy...
and... this:
My Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.
Jack,
please listen to me. It's going to be a disaster.
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red. The trim is white.
It's a mistake, Jack.
Now, don't be modest.
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?
Next!
I have every confidence in you.
But it seems wrong
to me, very wrong.
This device is called a nutcracker.
Jack, Jack!
We caught him! We got him!
Perfect!
Open it up, quickly.
That's not Sandy Claws.
It isn't?
Who is it?
Bunny!
Not Sandy Claws. Take him back!
We followed your instructions.
We went through the door.
Which door?
There's more than one!
Sandy Claws is behind
the door shaped like this.
I told you!
You knock it off!
Ow! Ow!
I'm very sorry for
the inconvenience, sir.
Take him home first!
And apologize again.
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.
Treat him nicely.
Got it.
We'll get it right...
next time!
You will be a decided
improvement...
over that
treacherous Sally.
Master! The plans!
Excellent, Igor.
This time 
This time 
Making Christmas 
Making Christmas 
Making Christmas 
Making Christmas 
Is so fine 
It's ours this time 
And won't the children 
be surprised 
It's ours this time 
Making Christmas

Snakes and mice 
get wrapped up so nice 
With spider legs 
and pretty bows 
It's ours this time 
Altogether 
That and this 
With all our tricks 
we're making Christmastime 
Here comes Jack!
I don't believe 
What's happening to me 
My hopes 
My dreams 
My fantasies 
Haheeheeheeheehee!
Won't they be 
impressed 
I am a genius 
See how I transform 
this old rat 
Into a most 
delightful hat 
Hmm.
My compliments from me to you 
on this your most intriguing hat 
Consider, though this substitute, 
a bat in place of this old rat 
No, no, no 
Now that's all wrong 
This thing will never make a present, 
it's been dead for much too long 
Try something fresher 
Something pleasant 
Try again 
Don't give up 
Altogether 
That and this 
With all our tricks 
we're making Christmastime 
This time This time 
It's ours 
Making Christmas 
Making Christmas 
La lala 
It's almost here 
And we can't wait 
So ring the bells 
and celebrate 
'Cause when the full moon 
starts to climb, we'll all sing out 
It's Christmastime 
Heeheeheeheehee!
Kathleen,
Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty, nice, nice, nice__
There are hardly any
naughty children this year.
Now who could that be?
Trick or treat!
Huh?
Ya!
You don't look like yourself, Jack.
Not at all.
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!
But you're the Pumpkin King.
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now.
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but__
Ow!
Sorry!
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?
I've got the beard,
the coat, the boots, the belt__
Jack! Jack!
This time we bagged him.
This time we really did.
He sure is big, Jack.
And heavy!
Let me out!
Oh, Sandy Claws.
In person! What
a pleasure to meet you.
WhWhy,
you have hands!
You don't have claws at all.
What?
Where am I?
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.
You don't need to have
another worry about Christmas this year.
Wha__ WhWha__
Consider this a vacation, Sandy, a reward.
It's your turn
to take it easy.
BBut there must be some mistake.
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas.
Of course!
That's what I'm missing. Thanks.
BBBut__
You just can't__ Hold on!
Where are we going now?
Hohoho!
No.
This is worse than I thought, much worse.
Hohoho!
Hohoho!
I know.
Me on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?
Where are we taking him?
Where?
To Oogie Boogie,
of course.
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.
And Jack said to make him
comfortable, didn't he?
Yes, he did!
Haven't you heard of peace
on earth and good will toward men?
No!
Oh! This'll stop Jack.
What a joy
to think of...
all we'll have
in common.
We'll have
conversations...
worth having.
Don't do this!
Naughty children
never get any presents.
I think he might be too big!
Oooh!
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney,
he can fit...
down... here.
Well, well, well!
What have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!
So you're the one
everybody's talkin' about.
You're jokin' 
You're jokin' 
I can't believe 
my eyes 
You're jokin' me 
You gotta be 
This can't be 
the right guy 
He's ancient 
He's ugly 
I don't know 
which is worse 
I might just split a seam now 
if I don't die laughin' first 
Mr. Oogie Boogie says 
there's trouble close at hand 
You better 
pay attention now 
'Cause I'm 
the Boogie Man 
And if you 
aren't shakin' 
There's somethin' 
very wrong 
'Cause this may be the last time 
you hear the Boogie song 
Whoaoh 
Wahah 
Whoaho 
Ow 
Whoaoh 
Wow 
I'm the Oogie Boogie Man 
Release me now or you must 
face the dire consequences 
The children are expecting me 
so please, come to your senses 
Ah, you're jokin' 
You're jokin' 
I can't believe 
my ears 
Would someone 
shut this fella up 
I'm drownin' 
in my tears 
He's funny 
I'm laughin' 
You really are 
too much 
And now 
with your permission 
I'm goin' to do my stuff 
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna do
the best I can.
Whoa 
The sound of rolling dice 
to me is music in the air 
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man 
although I don't play fair 
It's much more fun 
I must confess 
With lives on the line 
Not mine, of course 
But yours, old boy 
Now that'd be 
just fine 
Release me fast or you will 
have to answer for this heinous act 
Oh, brother, you're somethin' 
You put me in a spin 
You aren't comprehending 
the position that you're in 
It's hopeless You're finished 
You haven't got a prayer 
'Cause I'm 
Mr. Oogie Boogie 
And you ain't goin' 
nowhere 
Hurray! It's Jack!
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky,
outshining every star;
your silhouette,
a dark blot on the moon.
You, who are our pride.
You, who are our glory.
You, who have frightened
millions into an early grave.
Ow!
You, who have, uh,
devastated the, the souls
of the... living?
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.
The reindeer can't see an inch
in front of their noses.
Phew!
This fog's
as thick as, as__
Jellied brains.
Or thicker!
There go all of my hopes,
Oh!
My precious plans,
my glorious dreams.
There goes Christmas.
No, Zero. Down, boy.
My, what a brilliant
nose you have.
The better
to light my way!
To the head of the team, Zero.
We're off!
Wait, Jack! No!
Hohoho!
Hahahahaho!
Goodbye, Jack.
My dearest Jack.
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.
I sense there's something 
in the wind 
That feels like 
tragedy's at hand 
And though I'd like 
to stand by him 
Can't shake this feeling 
that I have 
The worst is 
just around the bend 
And does he notice 
My feelings for him 
And will he see 
How much 
he means to me 
I think 
it's not to be 
What will become 
of my dear friend 
Where will his actions 
lead us then 
Although I'd like 
to join the crowd 
In their 
enthusiastic cloud 
Try as I may 
it doesn't last 
And will we ever 
End up together 
No, I think not 
It's never to become 
For I am not 
the one 
Hohoho!
Hohohoho!
Heeheeheeheehee!
Santa!
Santa?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
Uh, uh, uh, uh__
That's all right.
I have a special present
for you anyway.
There you go, sonny.
Hohohoho!
Heeheeheeheehee!
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?
Merry Christmas!
Hello. Police.
Attacked by Christmas toys?
That's strange. That's the second
toy complaint we've had.
Hohohahahahaha!
Hohohahahahahaha!
Huh?
Oh, wait!
Whoa! Help! Help!
You're welcome,
one and all!
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.
Police. I know, I know,
a skeleton. Keep calm.
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.
Reports are pouring in from all over
the globe that an impostor...
is shamelessly impersonating Santa Claus,
mocking and mangling this joyous holiday.
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.
Jack. Someone has to help Jack.
...wherever you are,
Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
Come back and save Christmas.
Look, Zero,
searchlights.
They're celebrating!
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.
Whoa! Careful down there!
You almost hit us!
It's okay, Zero!
Head higher!
Are you a gamblin' man,
Sandy? Let's play!
Hmm?
My, my!
What have we here?
Hmm.
I'll get you out of here.
Ah! Lovely.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me?
Who's next
on my list?
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?
They're trying to hit us. Zero!
Merry Christmas
to all...
and to all
a good night!
I knew this Christmas
thing was a bad idea.
I felt it in my gut.
Terrible news, folks!
The worst tragedy
of our times!
Jack has been blown
to smithereens!
Terrible, terrible news!
Attention.
Attention, citizens.
Terrible news.
There's still no sign
of Santa Claus.
Although the impostor
has been shot down,
it looks like Christmas will have to
be canceled this year.
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,
but there's
still no sign of Santa.
What have I done 
What have I done 
How could I 
Be so blind 
All is lost 
Where was I 
Spoiled all 
Spoiled all 
Everything's 
Gone all wrong 
What have I done 
What have I done 
Find a deep cave 
to hide in 
In a million years 
They'll find me 
Only dust 
And a plaque 
that reads 
Here lies 
poor old Jack 
But I never intended 
all this madness 
Never 
And nobody 
really understood 
Well, how could they 
That all 
I ever wanted 
Was to bring them 
something great 
Why does nothing ever 
turn out like it should 
Well, what the heck 
I went and did my best 
And, by God 
I really tasted 
Something swell 
Something swell 
And for a moment 
why, I even touched the sky 
And at least I left 
some stories they can tell I did 
And for the first time since 
I don't remember when 
I felt just like 
my old bony self again 
And I, Jack 
The Pumpkin King 
That's right 
I am the Pumpkin King Hahaha! 
And I just can't wait 
until next Halloween 
'Cause I've got 
some new ideas 
That will really 
make them scream 
And, by God, I'm really going 
to give it all my might 
Uhoh. I hope
there's still time...
to set things right.
Sandy Claws.
Hmm.
You wait till Jack
hears about this!
By the time he's through with you,
you'll be lucky if you__
The King of Halloween...
has been blown
to smithereens!
Skeleton Jack...
is now a pile of dust!
C'mon, Zero! Christmas isn't over yet.
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?
Help! Help! Help!
Shhh!
Seven!
It's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.
One... two... three... four...
five, six, seven.
This can't be happening.
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.
Oh! I'm feeling weak...
with hunger!
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.
What?
Snake eyes?
Eleven!
Looks like I won
the jackpot!
Byebye, doll face...
and sandman!
What the__
Hello, Oogie.
JJJJack!
But they said you were dead.
You must be...
double dead!
Oh!
Well, come on,
bone man!
Oohhoohoohoo! Ha!
Fire!
Ooooh!
Jack, look out!
So long, Jack!
How dare you treat my friends...
so shamefully!
No, no, no, no, Jack!
Now look what
you've done!
My bugs!
My bugs!
My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
Forgive me,
Mr. Claws.
I'm afraid I've made a terrible mess of your holiday.
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?
The next time you get the urge to take over
someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.
She's the only one who makes any sense
around this insane asylum!
Skeletons, boogie men__
I hope there's still time.
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!
I'm Santa Claus!
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.
How did you get down here, Sally?
Oh, II was trying to__
Well, I wanted to, to__
To help me.
I couldn't let you just__
Sally.
I can't believe I never
realized that you__
Jack! Jack!
Here he is!
Alive! Just like we said!
Grab ahold, my boy!
Whoa!
Good news, folks.
Santa Claus, the one and only,
has finally been spotted.
Old Saint Nick appears to be traveling
at supersonic speed.
He's setting things right,
bringing joy and cheer
wherever he goes.
Yes, Kriss Kringle has pulled it out
of the bag and delivered Christmas...
to excited children all over the world.
La la la la 
la lalala 
La la la la 
la lalala 
Jack's back!
Jack?
Jack's okay!
He's all right!
Jack's okay 
and he's back 
Oh, yea 
He's all right 
Let's shout 
Make a fuss 
Scream it out 
Wheee 
Jack is back now 
Everyone sing 
In the town 
of Halloween 
It's great to be home!
Hohohoho!
Happy Halloween!
Merry Christmas!
What's this?
What's this 
I haven't got 
a clue 
What's this 
Why, it's completely new 
Must be a Christmas thing 
What's this 
It's really 
very strange 
This is Halloween 
Halloween, Halloween 
Halloween 
What's this, what's this 
Careful,
my precious jewel.
My dearest friend 
if you don't mind 
I'd like to join you 
by your side 
Where we can gaze 
Into the stars 
And sit together 
Now and forever 
For it is plain 
As anyone can see 
We're simply 
meant to be
