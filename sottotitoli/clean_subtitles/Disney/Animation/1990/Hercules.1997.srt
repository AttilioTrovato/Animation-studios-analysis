Long ago,
in the faraway land of ancient Greece,
there was a golden age of powerful
gods and extraordinary heroes.
And the greatest and strongest of all
these heroes was the mighty Hercules.
But what is the measure of a true hero?
Ah, that is what our stoy is...
Will you listen to him?
He's makin' the story sound like
some Greek tragedy.
Lighten up, dude.
We'll take it from here, darling.
You go, girl.
We are the Muses, goddesses of
the arts and proclaimers of heroes.
Heroes like Hercules.
Honey, you mean "Hunkules."
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...
Our story actually begins long before
Hercules, many aeons ago.
 Ah 
 Back when the world was new 
 Whoa!
 The planet Earth was down on its luck 
 And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok 
 It was a nasty place 
 There was a mess
wherever you stepped 
 Where chaos reigned and the
earthquakes and volcanoes never slept 
 Whoo! Say it, girlfriend! 
 And then along came Zeus 
 He hurled his thunderbolt
 He zapped 
 Locked those suckers in a vault
 They're trapped 
 And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks 
 And that's the gospel truth 
 The guy was too "Type A" to just relax 
 And that's the world's first dish 
 Yeah, baby. 
 Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth 
 Though, honey it may seem impossible 
 That's the gospel truth 
 On Mount Olympus life was neat
And smooth as sweet vermouth 
 Although, honey
it may seem impossible 
 That's the gospel truth 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, yeah  
Hercules!
Behave yourself.
Oh, look at this.
Look how cute he is.
Hah! Oh, he's strong like his dad, hmm?
Whoa! Excuse me! Hot stuff coming through!
Excuse me. One side, Ares.
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.
Yeah, you know,
I had Orpheus do the arrangement.
Isn't that too nutty?
Fabulous party. You know,
I haven't seen this much love in a room
since Narcissus discovered himself.
Dear, keep those away from the baby.
Oh, he won't hurt himself.
Let the kid have a little fun.
On behalf of my son,
I want to thank you all
for your wonderful gifts!
What about our gift, dear?
Well, let's see here.
We'll take... Hmm, yes.
A little cirrus
and a touch of nimbostratus
and a dash of cumulus.
His name is Pegasus,
and he's all yours, son.
Mind his head.
He's so tiny.
My boy.
My little Hercules.
How sentimental.
You know,
I haven't been this choked up
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat! Huh?
So is this an audience or a mosaic?
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.
So, Hades, you finally made it.
How are things in the underworld?
Well, they're just fine.
You know, a little dark, a little gloomy.
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.
What are you gonna do? Ah!
There's the little sunspot.
Little snootchie.
And here is a sucker
for the little sucker, eh?
Here you go. Ya just...
Sheesh!
Uh, powerful little tyke.
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!
Hey.
Love to, babe, but unlike you gods
lounging about up here,
I regrettably have a fulltime gig
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.
So, can't. Love to, but can't.
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.
Hah! Work yourself to death!
Oh, I kill myself!
If only. If only.
If there's one god you don't want to
get steamed up, it's Hades.
'Cause he had an evil plan.
 He ran the underworld 
 But thought the dead
were dull and uncouth 
 He was as mean as he was ruthless 
 And that's the gospel truth 
 He had a plan to shake things up 
 And that's the gospel truth  
Pain!
Coming, your most lugubriousness. Ow!
Panic!
Oh, I'm sory. I can handle it!
Pain! Oh!
And Panic!
Reporting for duty!
Reporting for duty!
Fine, fine, fine.
Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.
Oh. They're here.
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?
We are worms! Worthless worms!
We are worms! Worthless worms!
Memo to me, memo to me.
Maim you after my meeting.
Darling, hold that mortal's thread of life
good and tight.
Incoming!
Ladies! I am so sorry that I'm...
Late!
Late!
We knew you would be.
We know everything.
Past.
Present.
And Future.
Indoor plumbing, it's gonna be big.
Great, great. Anyway, see, ladies,
I was at this party, and I lost track of...
We know!
Yeah. I know you know.
So here's the deal. Zeus,
Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, you,
get off of my cloud," now he has...
A bouncing baby brat.
We know!
I know you know. I know.
I got it. I got the concept.
So let me just ask.
Is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?
What do you think?
Oh, no you don't.
We're not supposed to reveal the future.
Wait. I'm sorry. Time out. Can I...
Can I ask you a question, by the way?
Are you...
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.
I mean, you look like
a Fate worse than death.
Oh, gross!
Yech! It's blinkin'!
Ladies, please.
My fate is in your lovely hands.
Yeah!
Oh, all right.
In 18 years precisely,
the planets will align ever so nicely.
Ay, verse. Oy.
The time to act will be at hand.
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.
Mmhmm. Good, good.
Then the onceproud Zeus
will finally fall,
and you, Hades, will rule all!
Yes! Hades rules!
A word of caution to this tale.
Excuse me?
Should Hercules fight, you will fail.
What?
Okay, fine, fine. I'm cool. I'm fine.
Pain? Panic? Got a little riddle for ya.
How do you kill a god?
I do not know!
You can't. They're immortal?
Bingo! They're immortal.
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot mortal.
Huh?
Wha... What is it?
The baby!
The baby!
Hercules!
Oh!
No!
Now we did it!
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!
Just hang onto the kid, Panic.
Hurry!
Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?
No, no, no, he has to drink the whole potion.
Every last drop.
Who's there?
Alcmene, over here.
Oh, you poor thing.
Don't cry.
Is anybody there?
Now?
Now.
Well, he must have been abandoned.
Amphitryon, for so many years
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.
Perhaps they've answered our prayers.
Perhaps they have.
"Hercules"?
Help, help, help!
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.
You mean, if he finds out.
Of course he's gonna f...
If. If is good.
It was tragic.
Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.
 Young Herc was mortal now
 Mmm 
 But since he did not drink the last drop 
 He still retained his godlike strength 
 So thank his lucky stars 
 Tell it, girl. 
 But Zeus and Hera wept
 Ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Because their son
could never come home 
 They'd have to watch their precious
baby grow up from afar 
 Though Hades' horrid plan 
 Was hatched before
Herc cut his first tooth 
 Ahh
 The boy grew stronger every day 
 And that's the gospel truth 
 The gospel truth  
Hercules, slow down!
Look out!
Oops! SSsorry, guys!
Hey, watch where you're goin'.
Sunday driver!
Thanks, son.
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.
No problem, Pop.
Uh, don'tdon'tdon't unload just yet.
First, I have to finagle with Phideas.
Okay.
Oops. Sorry, Penelope.
Now, Hercules, this time, please just...
I know. I know.
Stay by the cart.
That's my boy.
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!
Careful!
Why, thank you.
No problem.
Why, Hercules!
IIIt's you!
Let me help you with that.
No, no, no, no, no. I got it!
I'm fine. You just run along.
Are you sure?
Oh, yes.
Absolutely.
Yo! Give it here!
Hey, you need an extra guy?
Uh, sorry, Herc.
Uh, we already got five,
and we want to keep it an even number.
Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an even...
See ya, Herc.
What a geek!
Destructo Boy.
Maybe we should call him "Jerkules."
Yeah!
Heads up!
II got it!
No! Stop!
Uhoh.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Hey! Whoa!
Son!
Hang on, Pop! Be right back!
Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't! No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Watch out!
Nice catch, Jerkules.
Son...
This is the last straw, Amphitryon!
That boy is a menace!
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.
HeHe just can't control his strength.
I'm warning you.
You keep thatthatthat...
freak away from here!
Freak! Yeah, go away!
Ah, son, you shouldn't let those things
they said back there get to you.
But, Pop, they're right. II am a freak.
II try to fit in. I really do.
I just can't.
Sometimes I feel like
I really don't belong here,
like I'm supposed to be someplace else.
Hercules, son...
I know it doesn't make any sense.
 I have often dreamed of a far off place 
 Where a great, warm welcome
will be waiting for me 
 Where the crowds will cheer
when they see my face 
 And a voice keeps sayin'
this is where I'm meant to be 
 I will find my way 
 I can go the distance 
 I'll be there someday 
 If I can be strong 
 I know every mile 
 Will be worth my while 
 I would go most anywhere to feel like I 
 Belong  
Hercules,
there's something your mother and I
have been meaning to tell ya.
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?
Why was I left here?
This was around your neck
when we found you.
It's the symbol of the gods.
This is it! Don't you see?
Maybe they have the answers!
I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...
Ma, Pop,
you're the greatest parents
anyone could have, but...
II gotta know.
 I am on my way 
 I can go the distance 
 I don't care how far 
 Somehow, I'll be strong 
 I know every mile 
 Will be worth my while 
 I would go most anywhere 
 To find where I belong  
Oh, mighty Zeus,
please, hear me and answer my prayer.
I need to know.
Who am I?
WhWhere do I belong?
Huh?
My boy.
My little Hercules.
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, kiddo!
What's your hurry?
After all these years, is this the kind of
hello you give your father?
FFFather?
Didn't know you had a famous father,
did you?
Surprise!
Look how you've grown.
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes and my strong chin.
Hah!
II don't understand.
If you're my father,
that would make me a...
A god.
A god.
A god!
Hey, you wanted answers,
and by thunder, you're old enough
now to know the truth.
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?
Of course we did.
Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.
Someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal,
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.
And you can't do a thing?
I can't, Hercules, but you can.
RReally? WWhat?
I'll do anything.
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth,
your godhood will be restored!
A true hero. Great!
Uh, exactly how do you
become a true hero?
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.
Seek out Philoctetes. Right. I'll...
Whoa!
Whoa! Hold your horses!
Which reminds me.
Haha! You probably don't remember Pegasus,
but you two go way back, son.
Oh, Pegasus!
He's a magnificent horse
with the brain of a bird.
I'll find Philoctetes
and become a true hero.
That's the spirit!
I won't let you down, Father!
Yeehah!
Good luck, son.
 I will beat the odds 
 I can go the distance 
 I will face the world 
 Fearless, proud and strong 
 I will please the gods 
 I can go the distance 
 Till I find my hero's welcome
right where I 
 Belong  
Whoa!
You sure this is the right place?
What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?
Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!
Ugh!
Girls! Stop! Stop!
Come back, come back, come back.
Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, nymphs!
They can't keep their hands off me.
Hey!
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?
Uh, no. Can you help us?
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.
Call me Phil.
Phil!
Ow!
Boy, am I glad to meet you!
I'm Hercules.
And this is Pegasus.
Animals! Disgusting!
I need your help.
I want to become a hero, a true hero.
Sorry, kid. Can't help ya.
Wait!
Whoo!
Uh, sorry.
Why not?
Two words, I am retired.
Look, I gotta do this.
Haven't you ever had a dream,
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you something.
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.
The Argo?
Yeah.
Who do you think
taught Jason how to sail?
Cleopatra?
I trained all those wouldbe heroes.
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus."
And every single one of those bums
let me down flatter than a discus.
None of 'em could go the distance.
And then there was Achilles.
Now, there was a guy who had it all,
the build, the foot speed.
He could jab, he could take a hit,
he could keep on comin'.
But that furshlugginer heel of his!
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom!
He's history.
Yeah, I had a dream once.
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.
So great, the gods would hang a picture
of him in the stars all across the sky,
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy."
That's right.
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.
But I'm different than
those other guys, Phil!
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show you.
Geez! You don't give up, do ya?
Watch this.
Holy Hera.
You know, maybe if I...
No! Snap out of it!
I'm too old
to get mixed up in this stuff again.
But if I don't become a true hero, I'll
never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.
Hold it!
Zeus is your father, right?
Zeus. The big guy. He's your daddy.
Mr Lightning Bolts!
Read me a book, would ya, Dada?
Zeus! "Once upon a time..."
It's the truth!
Please!
 So you wanna be a hero, kid 
 Well, whoopdedo 
 I have been around the block before 
 With blockheads just like you 
 Each and every one a disappointment 
 Pain for which there ain't no ointment 
 So much for excuses
Though a kid of "Zeus" is 
 Askin' me to jump into the fray 
 My answer is two words 
Okay.
You mean you'll do it?
You win.
You won't be sorry, Phil.
Oh, gods.
So when do we start?
Can we start now?
Oy, vay.
 I'd given up hope
that someone would come along 
 A fella who'd ring the bell for once
Not the gong 
 The kind who wins trophies 
 Won't settle for low fees 
 At least semipro fees 
 But, no, I get the greenhorn 
 I've been out to pasture, pal
My ambition gone 
 Content to spend lazy days
and to graze my lawn 
 But you need an advisor 
 A satyr, but wiser 
 A good merchandiser and... whoa 
 There goes my ulcer 
 I'm down to one last hope
and I hope it's you 
 Though, kid, you're not exactly
a dream come true 
 I trained enough turkeys
Who never came through 
 You're my one last hope
So you'll have to do 
Rule number six.
When rescuing a damsel,
always handle with care.
No!
Rule number 95, kid. Concentrate!
Rule number 96.
Aim!
 Demigods have faced the odds
And ended up a mockery 
 Don't believe the stories
That you read on all the crockery 
 To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art 
 Like paintin' a masterpiece 
 It's a work of heart 
 It takes more than sinew 
 Comes down to what's in you 
 You have to continue to grow 
Now, that's more like it!
 I'm down to one last shot
And my last high note 
 Before that blasted underworld
gets my goat 
 My dreams are on you, kid 
 Go make 'em come true 
 Climb that uphill slope 
 Keep pushin' that envelope 
 You're my one last hope 
 And, kid, it's up to you  
Yeah!
Ha, ha, ha!
Did you see that?
Next stop, Olympus.
All right, just take it easy, champ.
I am ready. I want to get off this island.
I want to see battles and monsters.
Rescue some damsels.
You know, heroic stuff.
Well...
Aw, come on, Phil!
Well, okay. Okay, you want a road test?
Saddle up, kid.
We're goin' to Thebes!
Yahoo!
So what's in Thebes?
A lot of problems.
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.
Sounds like your basic DID,
Damsel in Distress.
Not so fast, sweetheart.
I swear, Nessus. Put me down or I'll...
Whoo! I like 'em fiey!
Now, remember, kid.
First, analyse the situation.
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking. Eh?
He's losin' points for this!
You don't know what you're...
Halt!
Step aside, two legs.
Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.
I'll have to ask you to
release that young...
Keep movin', junior.
Lady.
But you... AreAren't you
a damsel in distress?
I'm a damsel, I'm in distress.
I can handle this. Have a nice day.
Uh... Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be
too close to the situation to realise...
Ohhh! What are you doin'? Get your sword!
Sword. Right, right.
Rule number 15,
a hero is only as good as his weapon!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.
Come on, kid! Concentrate!
Use your head!
All right! Not bad, kid!
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.
Oh, gee, miss.
I'm, I'm really sorry. That was dumb.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Nice work! Excelente!
Is Wonderboy here for real?
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real. Whoa!
And by the way, sweet cheeks,
I'm real, too.
Ugh!
Yeehah! Yahoo!
Whoa!
How was that, Phil?
Rein it in, rookie.
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons,
but this is the big leagues!
At least I beat him, didn't I?
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big googoo eyes!
Doh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.
You gotta stay focused, and... You...
Are you, uh, all right. Miss, uh...
Megara. My friends call me Meg.
At least, they would if I had any friends.
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?
Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...
Uh, uh...
Are you always this articulate?
Hercules. My... My name is Hercules.
Herc... Huh.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.
So, uh, uh... Howhowhow'd you
get mixed up with the, uh...
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.
They think that "No" means "Yes," and
"Get lost" means "Take me, I'm yours."
Don't worry.
Shorty here can explain it to ya later.
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
It's been a real slice.
Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?
Uh, I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.
Pegasus? Oh, no. Don't be silly.
He'd be more than happy to... Ow!
I'll be all right. I'm a big, tough girl.
I tie my own sandals and everything.
Byebye, Wonderboy.
Bye.
She's something. Isn't she, Phil?
Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.
She's really something.
A real pain in the patella!
Earth to Herc!
Come in, Herc! Come in, Herc!
We got a job to do, remember?
Thebes is still waitin'.
Yeah. Yeah. I know.
Aw, how cute.
A couple of rodents
looking for a theme park.
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
I'm a bunny!
AAnd I'm his gopher!
Tadah!
I thought I smelled a rat.
Meg?
Speak of the devil.
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut, Meg.
What exactly happened here?
I thought you were gonna
persuade the river guardian
to join my team for the uprising,
and here I am,
kind of river guardianless.
I gave it my best shot,
but he made me an offer I had to refuse.
Fine. So, instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence,
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?
Give that your best shot.
It wasn't my fault.
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.
Hercules?
Why does that name ring a bell?
I don't know.
Um, maybe we owe him money?
What was that name again?
Hercules.
He comes on with
this big, innocent farm boy routine,
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.
Wait a minute.
Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to...
Oh, my gods!
Oh, my gods!
Run for it!
So you took care of him, huh?
Dead as a door nail.
Weren't those your exact words?
This might be a different Hercules.
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason,
and the girls were all named Brittany?
I'm about to rearrange the cosmos,
and the one schlemiel who can louse
it up is waltzing around in the woods!
Wait. Wait, big guy.
We can still cut in on his waltzing.
That's right!
AndAnd at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.
Didn't we?
Hmm. Fortunately for the three of you,
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.
And this time, no foulups. Wow!
Is that all one town?
One town, a million troubles.
The one and only Thebes.
The Big Olive itself.
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.
Stick with me, kid.
This city is a dangerous place.
Look where you're goin', numbskull!
Hey, I'm walkin' here!
You see what I mean?
I'm tellin' you, wackos.
Pitta bread. Pitta bread.
Get your pitta bread here.
Hey, Mack.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You wanna buy a sundial?
He's not interested, all right?
Come on, kid.
The end is coming! Can't you feel it?
Yes, yes. Thank you for the info. Yes.
We'll ponder that for a while.
Just stare at the sidewalk. Come on.
Don't make eye contact.
People here are nuts.
That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.
Trust me, kid.
You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.
Everything except old Snowball here.
Now, were the fires
before or after the earthquake?
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.
But before the flood.
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.
Tell me about it.
It seems like every time I turn around,
there's some new monster
wreaking havoc and I...
All we need now is a plague of locusts.
That's it! I'm movin' to Sparta!
Excuse me.
It, uh... seems to me that
what you folks need is a hero.
Yeah, and who are you?
I'm Hercules, and, uh...
I happen to be a hero.
Is that so?
A hero!
Have you ever saved a town before?
Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...
Have you ever
reversed a natural disaster?
Well, uh, no.
Oh, listen to this.
He's just another chariot chaser.
This we need.
That's a laugh.
Don't you pea brains get it?
Hmm?
This kid is the genuine article.
Hey, isn't that the goatman
who trained Achilles?
Watch it, pal.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!
Ya missed a spot!
You... I got your heel right here!
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You...
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil! Take it easy. Phil.
What are you, crazy? Sheesh.
Young man, we need
a professional hero, not an amateur.
Well, wait. Stop!
How am I supposed to prove myself
a hero if nobody will give me a chance?
You'll get your chance.
You just need some kind of
catastrophe or disaster.
Please.
Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!
Meg?
Speakin' of disasters.
Wonderboy! Hercules!
Thank goodness!
WhaWhaWhat's wrong?
Oh! Outside of town, two little boys.
ThThey were playing in the gorge.
ThThere was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.
They're trapped!
Kids? Trapped?
Phil, this is great!
You're really choked up about this,
aren't ya?
Come on!
No, I... You don't under...
I, I have this terrible fear of heights!
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!
I'm way behind ya, kid.
I got a fur wedgie.
Are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstery.
Help! I can't breathe!
Hurry!
Get us out!
We're suffocating!
Somebody call IXII!
Easy, fellas. You'll be all right.
We can't last much longer!
Get us out before we get crushed!
How you boys doin'?
We're okay now.
Jeepers, mister. You're really strong.
Well, try to be a little more careful
next time, okay, kids?
We sure will.
A stirring performance, boys.
I was really moved.
"Jeepers, mister"?
I was going for innocence.
And, hey, two thumbs
way, way up for our leading lady.
What a dish. What a doll.
Get outta there, you big lug,
while you still can.
Phil, II did great.
They even applauded, sort of.
Huh! I hate to burst your bubble, kid,
but that ain't applause.
PhPhPhPhil?
What do you call that thing?
Two words.
Amscray!
Let's get ready to rumble!
That's it. Dance around! Dance around!
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.
Keep going. Come on. Come on.
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left! Your other left!
Whoa! All right! All right!
You're bad! Okay!
See, Phil? That... That wasn't so hard.
Kid, kid, kid.
How many horns do ya see?
Six?
Eh, close enough.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Guys, guys, relax.
It's only halftime.
That doesn't sound good.
Definitely not good!
Will you forget the headslicing thing?
I don't think we covered
this one in basic training!
My favourite part of the game,
sudden death.
Oh. There goes another one.
Just like Achilles.
Game.
Set.
Match.
Phil, you gotta admit.
That was pretty heroic.
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
You won by a landslide!
Hades mad.
Well, what do ya know?
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.
He was so hot, steam looked cool.
 Oh, yeah 
 Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll 
 Person of the week
in every Greek opinion poll 
 What a pro
 Herc could stop a show 
 Point him at a monster
and you're talkin' SRO 
 He was a no one
 A zero, zero 
 Now he's a honcho
 He's a hero 
 Here was a kid with his act down pat 
 Zero to hero in no time flat 
 Zero to hero
 Just like that 
 When he smiled the girls went wild 
 With oohs and aahs 
 And they slapped his face
on every vase 
 On every "vahse" 
 From appearance fees and royalties 
 Our Herc had cash to burn 
 Now nouveau riche and famous 
 He could tell you what's a Grecian urn 
 Say amen, there he goes again 
 Sweet and undefeated
 And an awesome ten for ten 
 Folks lined up just to watch him flex 
 And this perfect package
packed a pair of pretty pecs 
 Hercie, he comes
he sees, he conquers 
 Honey, the crowds were goin' bonkers 
 He showed the moxie
brains and spunk 
 Yeah 
 From zero to hero
 A major hunk 
 Zero to hero
 And who'd have thunk? 
 Who put the glad in gladiator? 
 Hercules 
 Who's darin' deeds are great theatre? 
 Hercules 
 Isn't he bold?
 No one braver 
 Is he sweet?
 Our favourite flavour 
 Hercules 
 My man. 
 Hercules
 Hercules 
 Hercules 
 Hercules
 Look at my Hercules 
 Hercules, Hercules
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll 
 Undefeated
 Riding high 
 And the nicest guy. 
 Not conceited 
 He was a nothing
 A zero, zero 
 Now he's a honcho
 He's our hero 
 He hit the heights at breakneck speed 
 From zero to hero 
 Herc is a hero 
 Now he's a hero 
 Yes, indeed  
Pull!
Nice shootin', Rex.
I can't believe this guy.
I throw everything I've got at him
and it doesn't even...
What are those?
Oh, I don't know.
II thought they looked kinda dashing.
I've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo,
or the entire scheme I've been setting
up for 18 years goes up in smoke,
and you are wearing his merchandise!
Thirsty?
Looks like your game's over.
Wonderboy is hitting
every curve you throw at him.
Oh, yeah.
I wonder if maybe
I haven't been throwing
the right curves at him, Meg, my sweet.
Don't even go there.
See, he's gotta have a weakness
because everybody's got a weakness.
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?
We simply need to
find out Wonderboy's.
I've done my part. Get your little imps...
They couldn't handle him as a baby.
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.
Well, you know, that's good because that's what
got you into this jam in the first place, isn't it?
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.
And how does this creep thank you?
By running off with some babe.
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?
Which is exactly why I got a feelin'
you're gonna leap at my new offer.
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath,
and I give you the thing that
you crave most in the entire cosmos,
your freedom.
Ha!
You should have been there, Father.
I mangled the Minotaur,
grappled with the Gorgon.
Just like Phil told me.
I analysed the situation,
controlled my strength and kicked.
The crowds went wild!
Thank you. Thank you.
Hah! You're doin' great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.
I'm glad to hear you say that, Father.
I've been waiting for this day
a long time.
Hmm. What day is that, son?
The day I rejoin the gods.
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.
You're just not there yet.
You haven't proven yourself a true hero.
But, Father, I've beaten every single
monster I've come up against.
II'mI'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.
I'mII'm an action figure!
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same as being a true hero.
What more can I do?
It's something
you have to discover for yourself.
But how can I...
Look inside your heart.
Father, wait!
On your left is Hercules' villa.
Our next stop is
the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop
where you can pick up
the great hero's 30minute
workout scroll Buns of Bronze.
At 1:00,
you got a meeting with King Augeas.
He's got a problem with his stables.
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.
Phil?
I told you, don't move!
DGR, the Daughters of
the Greek Revolution.
Phil.
At 3:00,
you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.
Phil, what's the point?
That's it!
Keep your toga on, pal.
Yuck! What do you mean,
"What's the point?"
You wanna go to Olympus, don't ya?
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.
I gave this everything I had.
Listen to me, kid. I seen 'em all.
And I am tellin' you,
and this is the honesttoZeus truth,
you got somethin' I never seen before.
Really?
I can feel it right down
to these stubby bowlegs of mine.
There is nothin' you can't do, kid.
It's him!
Hey, watch it! Watch it! Watch...
I touched his elbow! Hey, girls!
I got his sweatband!
Phil, help!
Okay. Escape plan, beta.
Gotcha.
Hey. Where is he?
There he goes! On the veranda!
Whoa! Let's see.
What could be behind
curtain number one?
Meg!
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.
Gee, iiit's great to see you.
III missed you.
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.
Nah. I'm no hero.
Sure ya are. Everybody in Greece
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pitta.
I know, it's... it's crazy.
You know, I can't go anywhere
without being mobbed.
I mean...
You sound like you could use a break.
Think your nanny goat
would go berserk
if you played hooky this afternoon?
Oh, gee, II don't know.
Uh, Phil's got the rest of the day
pretty much booked.
Ah, Phil, schmill. Just follow me.
Out the window, round the dumbbells,
you lift up the back wall and we're gone.
Wow. What a day.
First, that restaurant by the bay,
and then that play, that Oedipus thing.
Man! I thought I had problems.
Stop foolin' around!
Yeah. Get the goods, sister.
I didn't know that
playing hooky could be so much fun.
Yeah. Neither did I.
Thanks, Meg.
Oh. Don't thank me just yet.
Oh!
Oop. Careful.
Sorry. Weak ankles.
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better
sit down for a while.
So, uh, do you have any problems
with things like this?
Uh...
Weak ankles, I mean.
Oh, uh, no, not really.
No weaknesses whatsoever?
No trick knee?
Uh...
Ruptured disks?
No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle..
Wonderboy, you are perfect.
Thanks.
Whoops!
It looks better that way.
No, it really does.
You know, when I was a kid,
I, I would have given anything
to be exactly like everybody else.
You wanted to be petty and dishonest?
Everybody's not like that.
Yes, they are.
You're not like that.
How do you know what I'm like?
All I know is you're the most amazing
person with weak ankles I've ever met.
Oh!
Meg, when I'm with you,
II don't feel so alone.
Sometimes it's better to be alone.
What do you mean?
Nobody can hurt you.
Meg?
I would never, ever hurt you.
And I don't wanna hurt you, so let's both
do ourselves a favour and stop this
before we...
All right! Break it up! Break it up!
Party's over!
I been lookin' all over this town!
Calm down, mutton man.
It was all my fault.
You're already on my list, sister,
so don't make it worse!
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!
Now get on the horse.
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.
Ah, he'll get over it.
Move! Move, move,
move, move, move! Move!
Hey, watch it, watch it! Watch it!
Keep your googoo eyes on the...
That's it. Next time, I drive.
Oh, what's the matter with me?
You'd think a girl would learn.
 If there's a prize for rotten judgement 
 I guess I've already won that 
 No man is worth the aggravation 
 That's ancient history
Been there, done that 
 Who d'ya think you're kidding
He's the Earth and heaven to you 
 Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through you 
 Oh, no
 Girl, you can't conceal it 
 We know how you feel
and who you're thinkin' of 
 Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no 
 You swoon, you sigh
Why deny it? 
 It's too cliché, I won't say I'm in love 
 Shoodoo, shoodoo
Oooooo 
 I thought my heart
had learned its lesson 
 It feels so good when you start out 
 My head is screaming
"Get a grip, girl" 
 Unless you're dyin'
To cry your heart out 
 You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feelin' 
 Baby, we're not buyin'
Hon, we saw you hit the ceilin' 
 Face it like a grownup
When you gonna own up that you 
 Got
 Got it bad? 
 No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no 
 Give up, but give in
 Check the grin, you're in love 
 This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love 
 You're doing flips
Read our lips 
 You're in love 
 Shoodoo, shoodoo
 You're way off base. I won't say I'm it 
 She won't say in love 
 Get off my case, I won't say it 
 Girl, don't be proud
It's okay, you're in love 
 Oh, at least out loud 
 I won't say I'm in 
 Love
 Shoodoo, shoodoo, shoodoo 
 Shoodoo
Shalalalalalala 
 Ha  
Hey, what's the buzz, Meg?
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?
Get yourself another girl.
I'm through.
I'm sorry. Do you mind
runnin' that by me again?
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.
Then read my lips! Forget it.
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet, deluded little minion.
Aren't we forgetting one teensyweensy,
but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?
I own you!
Oh, oh, I got another horn here.
You work for me.
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.
If I say, "Sing," you say,
"Hey, name that tune."
If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head
on a platter," you say...
Medium or welldone.
I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.
I'll work on that.
I'm sorry. You hear that sound?
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.
I can't believe you're
getting so worked up about some guy.
This one is different.
He's honest, and he's sweet...
Please!
He would never do anything to hurt me.
He's a guy!
Besides, O oneness,
you can't beat him.
He has no weaknesses. He's gonna...
I think he does, Meg.
I truly think he does.
Hey, Phil! What happened to you?
Kid, we gotta talk.
Oh, Phil I just had
the greatest day of my life!
I, I, I can't stop thinking about Meg.
She's something else.
Kid, I'm tryin' to talk to ya!
Will you come down here and listen?
How can I come down there
when I'm feeling so up?
Gotcha!
Ah, very nice!
What I'm tryin' to say is...
That if it wasn't for you,
I never would have met her.
Oh, I owe you big time,
little guy. I do.
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?
Phil, I got two words for ya, duck!
Listen to me! She's...
A dream come true?
Not exactly.
More beautiful than Aphrodite?
Aside from that!
The most wonderful...
She's a... She's a fraud!
She's been playin' ya for a sap!
Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
I'm not kiddin' around.
She...
I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to...
Kid, you're missin' the point.
The point is, I love her.
She don't love you.
You're crazy.
She's nothin' but a twotimin'...
Stop it!
Nogood, lyin', schemin'...
Shut up!
Phil. I...
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.
Phil, wait. Where you going?
I'm hoppin' the first barge out of here.
I'm goin' home.
Fine! G...
Go! I don't... I don't need you.
I thought you were gonna be
the alltime champ,
not the alltime chump.
Geez Louise! What got his goat, huh?
Name is Hades, Lord of the Dead.
Hi. How ya doin'?
Uh, not now, okay?
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds
and I'm a fast talker, all right?
See, I've got the major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.
And Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it, huh?
You've got the wrong guy.
Hear me out, ya little...
Just hear me out, okay?
So I would be eternally grateful
if you would just take a day off
from this hero business of yours.
Jeez, I mean, monsters, natural disasters.
You wait a day, okay?
You're out of your mind.
Not so fast, because, ya see,
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.
Meg!
Don't listen, Herc...
Let her go!
Here's the tradeoff.
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?
Say the next 24 hours.
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.
What do ya say? Come on.
People are gonna get hurt, aren't they?
Nah! I mean, it's a possibility.
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war.
But what can I tell ya? Anyway,
what do you owe these people, huh?
Isn't Meg, little smoochy face you,
isn't she more important than they are?
Stop it!
Isn't she?
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.
Fine, okay. I'll give you that one.
Meg is safe, otherwise
you get your strength right back.
Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.
Baboom. Okay? We're done.
What d'ya say we shake on it?
Hey, I really don't have, like,
time to bat this around.
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...
All right!
Yes, we're there! Bam!
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kinda natural.
Maybe you should sit down!
Now you know how it feels
to be just like everybody else.
Isn't it just peachy?
Oh! You'll love this. One more thing.
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
You're off the hook.
And by the way, Herc,
is she not a fabulous little actress?
Stop it.
What do you mean?
I mean your little chickiepoo here
was working for me all the time.
Duh.
You're... You're lying!
Help!
Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.
Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.
No! It's... It's not like that.
I didn't mean to... II couldn't... I...
I'm so sorry.
Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero!
Well, gotta blaze.
There's a whole cosmos up there
waiting for me with, hey, my name on it.
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!
Brothers! Titans!
Look at you in your squalid prison!
Who put you down there?
Zeus!
And now that I set you free, what is
the first thing you are going to do?
Destroy him!
Good answer.
Crush Zeus!
Freeze him!
Melt Zeus!
Blow him away!
Zeus!
Uh, guys?
Huh?
Olympus would be that way.
Zeus!
Freeze him!
Hold it, bright eye.
Huh?
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.
Huh? Huh?
Destroy Zeus!
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta...
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped,
and they're practically at our gates!
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!
Go! Go!
Gone, babe.
Huh?
Charge!
On to battle!
You windbag!
Boom, baddaboom!
Boom, boom!
Ha!
Hercules!
Where are you?
What can we do?
Where is Hercules?
Yeah, Hercules'll save us.
Hercules!
Come out! Face me!
Oh, what are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.
Hercules!
There are worse things.
Run!
Wait! Stop!
Hey, look! It's Hercules.
Thank the gods!
We're saved!
So...
You mighty Hercules.
Oh!
Oh!
Easy, horsefeathers.
Stop twitching.
Listen. Hercules is in trouble.
We've gotta find Phil.
He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.
Get back, blast you!
Ooh! Chihuahua!
Zeus!
Come on! Hurry up!
We're shovin' off here!
Phil!
Phil, Hercules needs your help!
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?
He won't listen to me.
Good! He's finally learned something.
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me.
It's about him.
If you don't help him now, Phil, he'll die.
I need more thunderbolts!
Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord.
Everyone's been captured.
I've been captured!
Hey, hey! Watch the glasses.
Zeusy, I'm home!
Hades. You're behind this!
You are correct, sir!
Flea.
Hercules!
Phil.
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.
Come on, you can take this bum.
This guy's a pushover. Look at him.
You were right all along, Phil.
Dreams are for rookies.
No, no, no, no, kid.
Givin' up is for rookies.
I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.
I'm willing to go the distance.
How 'bout you?
Me bite off head!
Whoa, baby!
Hercules! Look out!
Meg! No!
What's happening?
HHades' deal is broken.
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.
Meg.
Why... why... why did ya...
You didn't have to...
Oh, people always do crazy things
when they're in love.
Oh, Meg.
Meg, I... I...
Are you always this articulate?
You... You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.
I'll watch over her, kid.
You're gonna be all right.
I promise.
Let's go, Pegasus!
Hup, two, three, four.
Come on, everybody!
I can't hear you!
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of this...
I'm the one giving orders now, bolt boy.
And I think I'm gonna like it here.
Don't get too comfortable, Hades!
Hercules!
This ought to even the odds!
Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.
Get them!
Whoa! Hey!
No! Get him! Not me! Him!
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse.
Thank you, my boy.
Nice horsey! My intentions were pure!
I really was attracted to you.
Throw!
Ah! Now watch your old man work!
Guys, get your titanic rears in gear
and kick some Olympian butt!
Whoa! Is my hair out?
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy.
But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize,
a friend of yours who's dying to see me.
Meg.
Ha! Meg.
Meg.
Meg, no.
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.
There's some things
you just can't change.
Yes, I can.
We were so close!
So close.
We tripped at the finish line. Why?
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.
Where's Meg?
Look who's here.
Wonderboy, you are too much.
Let her go.
Get a grip.
Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld after all. Huh?
Meg!
No, no, no. Mustn't touch.
You see, Meg's
running with a new crowd these days.
And not a very lively one, at that.
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.
Oh, hmph, well. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.
Going once.
Hmm? Is there a downside to this?
Going twice!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You get her out. She goes, you stay.
Oh, you what slipped my mind?
You'll be dead
before you can get to her.
That's not a problem, is it?
Oh!
What's the matter
with these scissors?
The thread won't cut.
This is... This is impossible!
You... You... You can't be alive.
You'd have to be a, a...
A god?
A god?
Hercules, stop!
You can't do this to me. You can't...
Fine. Okay. Listen.
Okay. Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc. Can we talk?
YYour dad? He's a fun guy, right?
So maybe you could
put in a word with him,
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know?
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
You know, a little schmooze, uh...
Get away from me! Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.
You mean, if he gets outta there.
Taxi!
If. If is good.
Taxi!
I don't feel so good.
II feel a little...
Wonderboy, what...
Why did you...
People always do crazy things
when they're in love.
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Three cheers for the mighty Hercules!
Oh, yeah! Flowers for everybody! Oh!
Hercules, we're so proud of you.
Mother.
Fine work, my boy! You've done it!
You're a true hero.
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength,
but by the strength of his heart.
Now, at last, my son,
you can come home.
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of.
But...
A life without Meg,
even an immortal life,
would be empty.
I...
I wish to stay on Earth with her.
I finally know where I belong.
Hit it, ladies!
 Oh, gonna shout it from the mountaintops
 A star is born 
 It's the time for pulling out the stops
 A star is born 
 Honey, hit us with a hallelu
 That kid came shining through 
 Girl, sing the song 
 Come blow your horn
 A star is born 
 He's a hero who can please the crowd
 A star is born 
 Come on, everybody shout out loud
A star is born 
 Just remember in the darkest hour
within your heart's the power 
 For makin' you a hero, too 
 So don't lose hope when you're forlorn 
 That's Phil's boy! 
 Just keep your eyes upon the skies 
 Every night, a star is
Right in sight, a star is 
 Burning bright, a star is born
 A star is born 
What d'ya say? It's happy ending time!
Everybody's got a little taste
of somethin' but me.
I got nothin'. I'm here with nothin'.
Anybody listenin'?
It's like I'm...
What am I, an echo or something?
Hello? Hello? Am I talking to, what?
Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.
Nobody listens.
