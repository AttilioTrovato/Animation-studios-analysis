Put it out! Put it out!Put it out!
You are a disgrace!
You may look like a bride,
but you will neverbring your family honor!
Look at me
I will never pass
For a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meantto play this part
Now I see
That if I were trulyto be myself
I would breakmy family's heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight
Back at me
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When willmy reflection show
Who I am inside
When willmy reflection show
Who I am
Inside
My, my.
What beautiful blossomswe have this year.
But, look,this one's late.
But I'll bet thatwhen it blooms,
it will bethe most beautiful of all.
What is it?
Mulan.
Stay inside.
Citizens, I bringa proclamation...
from the Imperial City.
The Huns have invaded China.
By order of the Emperor,
one man from every familymust serve in the Imperial Army.
The Hsiao family.
The Yi family.
I will serve the Emperorin my father's place.
The Fa family. No!
I am ready to servethe Emperor.
Father, you can't go. Mulan!
Please, sir, my father has alreadyfought bravely... Silence!
You would do well to teach your daughterto hold her tongue in a man's presence.
Mulan, you dishonor me.
Report tomorrowto the Wu Zhong camp.
Yes, sir.
The Chu family!
The Wen family!
The Chang family!
You shouldn't have to go! Mulan
There are plenty of young mento fight for China.
It is an honor to protectmy country and my family.
So, you'll die for honor.
I will diedoing what's right.
But if you... I know my place!It is time you learned yours.
Mulan is gone!
What?
It can't be.
Mulan!
No.
You must go after her.She could be killed.
If I reveal her,
she will be.
Ancestors, hear our prayer.
Watch over Mulan.
Mushu, awaken.
I live!
So tell me what mortal needsmy protection, Great Ancestor.
You just say the word and I'm there. Mushu
And let me say somethin'. Anybody's who'sfoolish enough to threaten our family,
vengeance will be mine!
Mushu!
These arethe family guardians.
They Protect the family.
And you, O Demoted One?
I... ring the gong.
That's right.Now, wake up the ancestors.
One family reunion comin' right up.
Okay, people, people, look alive.Let's go. Come on. Get up.
Let's move it. Rise and shine. Y'all waypast the beauty sleep thing, trust me.
I knew it. I knew it. That Mulanwas a troublemaker from the start!
Don't look at me. She gets itfrom your side of the family.
She's just tryingto help her father.
But if she's discovered,Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.
Dishonor will come to the family.Traditional values will disintegrate.
Not to mention,they'll lose the farm.
My children never caused such trouble.They all became acupuncturists.
Well, we can't all be acupuncturists. No!
Your greatgranddaughterhad to be a crossdresser!
Let a guardian bring her back. Yes, awaken the most cunning.
No. The swiftest.
No. Send the wisest. Silence!
We must sendthe most powerful of all.
Okay, okay,I get the drift. I'll go.
Oh, y'all don't think I can do it.Watch this here.
Aha! Jump back.I'm pretty hot, huh?
Don't make me have to singenobody to prove no point.
You had your chanceto protect the Fa family.
Your misguidance ledFa Deng to disaster.
Yeah, thanks a lot. And your point is?
The point is we will be sendinga real dragon to retrieve Mulan.
What WhatI'm a real dragon!
You are not worthy of this spot.Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.
So you'll get back to meon the job thing?
Just one chance,is that too much to ask?
I mean, it's not likeit'd kill ya.
Yo, Rocky, wake up!Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!
Come on, boy!Go get her! Go on!
Come on.
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!
Uhoh.

Stony? Oh, man,they're gonna kill me.
Great Stone Dragon,

Uh, uh, uh, uhYes, I just woke up.
I'm I'm the GreatStone Dragon. Good morning.
I will go forthand fetch Mulan.
Did Did I mention thatI was the Great Stone Dragon?
Go! The fateof the Fa family...
rests in your claws.
Don't even worry about it.I will not lose face.
My elbow!
I know I twisted somethin'.
That's just great.Now what?
I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man decidesto take her little drag show on the road.
Go get her? What's the matterwith you? After this Great Stone,
Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring herhome with a medal to get back in the temple.
Wait a minute. That's it!
I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll bebegging me to come back to work.
That's the master plan.Ah, you done it now, man.
Hey, what makes youthink you're comin'?
You're lucky?
Do I look like a sucker to you?
What you mean, a loser? How'bout I pop one of your antennasoff, throw it across the yard?
Then who's the loser, me or you?
Imperial scouts.
ShanYu.
Nice work, gentlemen.You found the Hun Army.
The Emperorwill stop you.
Stop me?He invited me.
By building his wall,he challenged my strength.
Well, I'm hereto play his game.
Go! Tell your Emperorto send his strongest armies.
I'm ready.
How many men does it taketo deliver a message?
One.
Okay, okay,how about this?
Excuse me.
Where do I sign in?
Ha, I see you have a sword.I have one too.
They're very manlyand... tough.
I'm working on it!
Oh, who am I fooling?
It's going to take a miracleto get me into the army.
Did I hear someone askfor a miracle?
Let me hear you say "aaah"!
That's close enough. A ghost.
Get ready, Mulan.Your serpentine salvation is at hand!
For I have been sentby your ancestors...
to guide you throughyour masquerade.
Come on. If you're gonna stay,you're gonna work.
So heed my word! 'Cause ifthe army finds out you're a girl,
the penalty is death!

You're, um
Intimidating?Awe inspiring?
Tiny. Of course. I'm travelsize for your convenience.
If I was my real size,your cow here would die of fright.

Captain?
This is an enormousresponsibility, General.
Perhaps a soldierwith more experience.
Number one in his class, extensiveknowledge of training techniques,
and impressivemilitary lineage.

Looks like our new friendslept in this morning.
Hello, Ping.Are ya hungry?
Yeah, 'cause I owe youa knuckle sandwich.
Soldiers!
You will assemble swiftlyand silently every morning.
Anyone who acts otherwise...
will answer to me.
Eeew. Tough guy.
Yao.
Thank you for volunteering.Retrieve the arrow.
I'll get that arrow,pretty boy,
and I'll do itwith my shirt on.
One moment. You seemto be missing something.
This represents discipline,
and thisrepresents strength.
You need bothto reach the arrow.
We've got a long way to go.
Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns
Hooah! Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons
You're the saddest bunchI ever met
But you can betbefore we're through
Mister, I'll make a man
Out of you
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win
You're a spineless, palepathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'llmake a man
Out of you
I'm never gonnacatch my breath
Say goodbyeto those who knew me
Boy, was I a foolin school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wishthat I knew how to swim
Be a man We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark sideof the moon
Time is racing toward us
Till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order
And you might survive
You're unsuited forthe rage of war
So pack up, go homeYou're through
How could Imake a man
Out of you
Be a man We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side
Of the moon
Be a man We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a manWith all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side
Of the moon
What do you see?
Black pine,from the high mountains.
White horse hair.Imperial stallions.
Sulphur, from cannons.
This doll came from a villagein the Tung Shao Pass...
where the Imperial Armyis waiting for us.
We can avoid them easily.
No.
The quickest way to the Emperoris through that pass.
And besides, the little girlwill be missing her doll.
We should return it to her.
No, this is not a goodidea. What if somebody sees you?
Just because I look like a mandoesn't mean I have to smell like one.
So a couple of guys don't rinseout their socks. Picky, picky, picky.
Well, myself, I kind oflike that corn chip smell.
Okay, all right. That's enough. Getout before you get all pruny and stuff.
Mushu, if you're so worried,go stand watch.
Yeah, yeah."Stand watch, Mushu,
while I blow our secretwith my stupid girlie habits."
Pfft! Hygiene!
Me first! Me first!
We're doomed! There are a couple ofthings I know they're bound to notice!
Hey, Ping!
Oh, hi, guys.I didn't know you were here.
I was just washing. So now I'm clean,and I'm gonna go. Byebye.
Come back here.I know we were jerks to you before,
so let's start over.
Hi. I'm Ling.
And I'm ChienPo. Hello, ChienPo.
And I am Yao!
King of the rock!
And there's nothin'you girls can do about it.
Oh, yeah?Well, I think Ping and I can take you.
I really don't wanna take him anywhere. Ping, we have to fight!
No, we don't. Uh, we, uh, could justclose our eyes and swim around.
Come on. Don't besuch a gir
Ouch! Something bit me!
What a nasty flavor.
Snake!
Oooh, snake! Snake!
Snake! Snake!
Some king of the rock.
Boy, that was close.
No. That was vile.
You owe me big.
I never want to seea naked man again.
Hey, don't look at me.I ain't bitin' no more butts.
You think your troopsare ready to fight?
Ha! They would not last a minuteagainst the Huns!
They completed their training. Those boys...
are no more fit to be soldiersthan you are to be captain.
Once the Generalreads my report,
your troopswill never see battle.
Oh, no, you don't! I've workedtoo hard to get Mulan into this war.
This guy's messin'with my plan.
We're not finished!
Be careful, Captain.The General may be your father,
but I amthe Emperor's counsel.
And, oh, by the way,I got that job on my own.
You're dismissed.
Hey. I'll hold himand you punch.
Or not.
For what it's worth,I think you're a great captain.
I saw that. What?
You like him, don't you?
No! Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.Go to your tent!
I think it's time we tookthis war into our own hands.
Let me see what you got. "From General Li.Dear Son, we're waiting for Huns at the Pass.
It would mean a lotif you'd come and back us up."
That's great, except you forgot,"And since we're out of potpourri,
perhaps you wouldn't mindbringing up some. "
Hello! This is the army! Make it soundmore urgent! Know what I'm talkin' about?
That's better.Much better. Let's go.
Khanny, baby.Hey, we need a ride.
Insubordinate ruffians!
You men owe me a new pair of slippers!
And I do not squeal like a girl.
Urgent newsfrom the General.
What's the matter? You've never seena black and white before?
Who are you?
Excuse me? I thinkthe question is, who are you?
We're in a war, man!There's no time for stupid questions!
I should have your hat for that.Snatch it right off your head.
But I'm feeling gracious today,so carry on before I report you.
Captain, urgent news from the General!We're needed at the front.
Pack your bags, CriKee.We're movin' out.
For a long time we've been marchingoff to battle
In our thundering herdwe feel a lot like cattle
Like a pounding beatour aching feet
Aren't easy to ignore
Hey!Think of instead
A girlworth fighting for
Huh? That's what I said.
A girlworth fighting for
I want her palerthan the moon
With eyes that shinelike stars
My girl will marvel at my strength
Adore my battle scars
I couldn't care less what she'll wearor what she looks like
It all depends onwhat she cooks like
Beef, pork, chickenMmm
Bet the local girls thought youwere quite the charmer
And I'll bet the ladieslove a man in armor
You can guess whatwe have missed the most
Since we went off to war
What do we want A girl worth fighting for
My girl will thinkI have no faults
That I'm a major find
Uh, how 'bout a girlwho's got a brain
Who always speaks her mind Nah!
My manly waysand turn of phrase
Are sure to thrill her
He thinks he'ssuch a lady killer
I've a girl back homewho's unlike any other
Yeah, the only girlwho'd love him is his mother
But when we come home in victory
They'll line upat the door
What do we want A girl worth fighting for
Wish that I had A girl worth fighting for
A girl worth fighting
Search for survivors.
I don't understand.My father should've been here.
Captain!
The General.
I'm sorry.
The Huns are moving quickly.
We'll make better time to the ImperialCity through the Tung Shao Pass.
We're the only hopefor the Emperor now.
Move out!
What happened?
Um... You just gave awayour position! Now we're
Um... You just gave awayour position! Now we're
Get out of range!
Save the cannons!
Come on! Empty it! Empty it!
Oh, sure.Save the horse.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold the last cannon.
Prepare to fight.If we die, we die with honor.
Yao, aim the cannonat ShanYu.
Hey! Ping! Come back!
Ping!
Stop!
All right. You might want tolight that right about now.
Quickly. Quickly!
Come on!We gotta help!
You missed!How could you miss?
It was three feetin front of you!
Mulan!

Perfect.Now we'll pull them to safety.
Hey, Mulan!I found the lucky cricket!
We need help.
Ooh, nice. Very nice.You can sit by me.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!We are definitely gonna die.
No way we survive this.Death is coming!
I let them slip through my fingers.
Pull!
I knew we could do it.You the man!
Well, sort of.
Step back, guys.Give him some air.
Ping?
You are the craziest man I've ever met.
And for that,I owe you my life.
From now on,you have my trust.
Let's hear it for Ping!The bravest of us all!
You're king of the mountain! Yes, yes, yes!
Ping! What's wrong?
He's wounded!Get help!
Ping, hold on.
Hold on.
I can explain.
So it's true!
Shang!
I knew there wassomething wrong with you.
A woman!
Treacherous snake!
My name is Mulan.
I did itto save my father.
High treason! I didn't mean for it to go this far.
Ultimate dishonor!
It was the only way.Please believe me.
Captain?
Restrain him!
No! You know the law.
A life for a life.
My debt is repaid.
Move out! But you can't just
I said, "Move out."
I was this close.
This closeto impressin' the ancestors,
gettin' the top shelf,an entourage.
Man. All my fine work.Pfft.
Hi.
I should never have left home.
Hey, come on.You went to save your father's life.
Who knew you'd end up shamin' himand disgracing your ancestors...
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gottaYou gotta learn to let these things go.
Maybe I didn't gofor my father.
Maybe what I really wanted was to proveI could do things right...
so when I looked in the mirror,
I'd see someone worthwhile.
But I was wrong.
I see nothing.
Now, that's just 'causethis needs a little spit, that's all.
Let me shine this up for ya.
I can see you. Look at you.You look so pretty.
The truth is,we're both frauds.
Your ancestors never sent me.They don't even like me.
I mean, you risked your lifeto help people you love.
I risked your lifeto help myself.
At leastyou had good intentions.
What? What do you mean,"You're not lucky"?
You lied to me?
And what are you, a sheep?
I'll have to face my fathersooner or later.
Let's go home.
Yeah. This ain'tgonna be pretty.
But don't you worry, okay?Things will work out.
We started this thing together,and that's how we'll finish it.
I promise.
Uh, home is that way.
I have to do something. Did you see those Huns?
They popped out of the snow...Iike daisies!
Are we in this togetheror not?
Well, let's go kicksome Hunny buns!
Make way for the heroesof China.
Shang! Mulan?
The Huns are alive!They're in the city!
You don't belong here,Mulan. Go home.
Shang, I saw them in the mountains.You have to believe me.
Why should I?
Why else would I come back?
You said you'd trust Ping.Why is Mulan any different?
Keep your eyes open.I know they're here. Yah!
Now, where are you going?
To find someonewho will believe me.
My children,heaven smiles down...
upon the Middle Kingdom.
China will sleepsafely tonight...
thanks toour brave warriors.
Sir, the Emperor's in danger.
But the Huns are here.
Please, you have to help.
No one will listen. Huh? Oh,I'm sorry. Did you say something?
Mushu. Hey, you're a girl again, remember?
Your Majesty, I present to youthe sword of ShanYu.
I know what this meansto you, Captain Li.
Your father would have beenvery proud.

They'll never reachthe Emperor in time.

Must I pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am
Inside, there's a heart
That must be free
To fly
And I burn
With a need to know
The reason why
Why must we all conceal
What we thinkHow we feel
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide
I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside
