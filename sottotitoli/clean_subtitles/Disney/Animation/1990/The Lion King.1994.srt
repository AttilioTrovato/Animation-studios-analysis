From the day we arrive 
On the planet 
And, blinking, step into the sun 
There's more to see 
Than can ever be seen 
More to do 
Than can ever be done 
There's far too much 
To take in here 
More to find 
Than can ever be found 

But the sun rolling high 
Through the sapphire sky 
Keeps great and small 
On the endless round 
It's the circle of life 
And it moves us all 
Through despair and hope 
Through faith and love 
Till we find our place 
On the path unwinding 
In the circle 
The circle of life 

It's the circle of life 
And it moves us all 
Through despair and hope 
Through faith and love 
Till we find our place 
On the path unwinding 
In the circle 
The circle of life 
Life's not fair, is it?
You see, l... Well, I shall never be king.
And you shall never see
the light of another day.
Adieu.
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?
What do you want?
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.
Oh, look, Zazu.
You've made me lose my lunch.
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
I quiver with fear!
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.
Help!
Scar?
Mmhmm?
Drop him.
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high
to mingle with the commoners.
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.
That was today?
I feel simply awful!

Must've slipped my mind.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.
That hairball is my son
and your future king.
I shall practice my curtsy!
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Oh, no, Mufasa.
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

Is that a challenge?
Temper, temper.
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Pity. Why not?
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.
But when it comes to brute strength,
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.
There's one in every family, sire.
Two in mine, actually,
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.
What am I going to do with him?
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Zazu!
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,
you could take him out and beat him.


Hmm.
Simba.

Dad! Dad!
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!
Uhh!
Sorry.

Dad! Dad!
Your son is awake.
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Dad! Come on, Dad.
You promised.
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.
Yeah!
Look, Simba.
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.
Wow.
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here
and will rise with you as the new king.
And this'll all be mine?
Everything.
Everything the light touches.
What about that shadowy place?
That's beyond our borders.
You must never go there, Simba.
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.
There's more?
Simba...
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.
As king, you need to
understand that balance
and respect all the creatures,
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,
and the antelope eat the grass.
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.
Good morning, sire!
Good morning, Zazu.
Checking in with the morning report.
Fire away.
Well! The buzz from the bees
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.
Really?
What are you doing, son?
Pouncing.
Let an old pro show you how it's done.
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...
Zazu, would you turn around?
Yes, sire.
The cheetahs are hard up, but...
Stay low to the ground.
Cheetahs never prosper...
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.
What going on?
A pouncing lesson.
Very good. Pouncing.
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...
This is so humiliating.
Try not to make a sound.
What are you telling him, Mufasa?
Mufasa? Simba?

That's very good.
Zazu!
Yes!
News from the underground.
Now, this time...
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!
Zazu, take Simba home.
Aw, dad, can't I come?
No, son.
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.
Oh, young master,
one day, you will be king.
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers
from dawn until dusk.
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?
I despise guessing games.
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.
Oh, goody!
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,
and I'm gonna rule it all!
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.
Bad back, you know.
Hey, Uncle Scar.
When I'm king, what'll that make you?
A monkey's uncle.
You're so weird.
You have no idea.
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?
Everything.
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?
Well, no. He said I can't go there.
And he's absolutely right.
It's far too dangerous.
Only the bravest lions go there.
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.
Why not?
I'm only looking out for the
wellbeing of my favorite nephew.
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.
All the more reason
for me to be protective.
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!
An elephant what? Whoa!
Oh, dear, I've said too much.
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,
you being so clever and all.
Just do me one favor.
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.
No problem.
There's a good lad.
You run along now and have fun.
And remember,
it's our little secret.
Hey, Nala.
Hi, Simba.
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.
And it's time for yours.
Mom!
Mom, you're messing up my mane!
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?
So, where are we going?
It better not be anyplace dumb.
No, it's really cool.
So, where is this really cool place?
Oh.
Uh, around the water hole.
The water hole?
What's so great about the water hole?
I'll show you when we get there.
Oh.
Uh, mom, can I go with Simba?
Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi?
Well...
Please?
It's all right with me.
Yeah!
All right!
As long as Zazu goes with you.
No, not Zazu.
Step lively.
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.
So, where are we really going?
An elephant graveyard.
Wow!
Shh! Zazu.
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?
Oh, just look at you two.
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.
Your parents will be thrilled,
what with your being betrothed and all.
Bewhat?
Betrothed. Intended.
Affianced.
Meaning...
One day, you two are
going to be married.
Yuck!
Eww!
I can't marry her. She's my friend.
Yeah, it'd be so weird.
Sorry to bust your bubble,
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.
It's a tradition going back generations.
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.
Not so long as I'm around.
Well, in that case, you're fired.
Nice try, but only the king can do that.
Well, he's the future king.
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.
Not yet, I don't.
And with an attitude like that,
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.
Not the way I see it.
I'm gonna be a mighty king 
So enemies beware 
Well, I've never seen 
a king of beasts 
With quite so little hair 
I'm gonna be the main event 
Like no king was before 
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down 
I'm workin' on my roar 
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing 
Oh, I just can't wait to be king 
You've rather along way to go,
young master, if you think...
No one sayin', "Do this"
Now, when I said that... 
No one saying, "Be there"
What I meant was... 
No one sayin', "Stop that"
You don't realize... 
No one sayin', "See here"
Now, see here! 
Free to run around all day 
Well, that's definitely out.
Free to do it all my way 
I think it's time that you and I 
Arranged a hearttoheart 
Kings don't need advice 
From little hornbills for a start 
If this is where
the monarchy is headed 
Count me out 
Out of service, out of Africa 
I wouldn't hang about 
This child is getting
wildly out of wing 
Oh, I just can't wait to be king 
Everybody, look left 
Everybody, look right 
Everywhere you look, I'm 
Standing in the spotlight 
Not yet!
Let every creature
go for broke and sing 
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing 
It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling 
Oh, I just can't wait to be king 
Oh, I just can't wait to be king 
Oh, I just can't wait 
To be king 

I beg your pardon, madam, but
get off!
Simba?
Nala!

All right! It worked!
We lost him.
I am a genius.
Hey, genius, it was my idea.
Yeah, but I pulled it off.
With me!
Oh, yeah?
Pinned ya.
Hey, let me up!

Pinned ya again.
This is it. We made it.
Whoa!
It's really creepy.
Yeah.
Isn't it great?
We could get in big trouble.
I know!
I wonder if its brains are still in there.
There's only one way to know.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.
Oh, man!
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.
Look, banana beak is scared.
It's Mr. banana beak to you, fuzzy,
and right now we are all
in very real danger.
Danger? Ha!
I walk on the wild side.
I laugh in the face of danger.
Ha ha ha ha!

Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?
I don't know, Shenzi.
What do you think, Ed?

Just what I was thinking.
A trio of trespassers!
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.
A simple navigational error.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.
I, madam, am the king's majordomo.
And that would make you...
The future king.
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?
Huh! You can't do anything to me.
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.
Ixnay on the upidstay.
Who are you callin' upidstay?
My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!
It's time to go!
What's the hurry?
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.
Yeah, we could have
whatever's lion around!
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?
What, Ed? What is it?
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?
No, why?
'Cause there it goes!


Did we lose 'em?
I think so.
Where's Zazu?
The little majordomo bird
hippetyhopped
all the way to the birdieboiler.
Oh, no! Not the birdieboiler!
Aaaah!
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?
Like you?
Oops.
Boo!
Simba!

Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

That was it?
Do it again. Come on.


Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!
Silence!
We're gonna shut up right now!
Calm down. We're really sorry.
If you ever come near my son again...
Oh, this is... This is your son?
Oh, your son.
Did you know that?
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?
No, of course not.
No.
Ed?

Toodles.
Dad, I...
You deliberately disobeyed me.
Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
Let's go home.
I thought you were very brave.
Zazu.
Yes, sire?
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.
Come, Nala.
Simba, good luck.
Simba!
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
I know.
You could've been killed.
You deliberately disobeyed me,
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.
I was just trying to be brave, like you.
I'm only brave when I have to be.
Simba, being brave
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
But you're not scared of anything.
I was today.
You were?
Yes.
I thought I might lose you.
I guess even kings get scared, huh?
Mmhmm.
But you know what?
What?
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

'Cause nobody messes with your dad.
Come here, you.
Oh, no! No!
Aagh! Uhh!

Come here!

Gotcha!

Dad?
Hmm?
We're pals, right?
Right.
And we'll always be together, right?
Simba, let me tell you something
that my father told me.
Look at the stars.
The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.
Really?
Yes.
So whenever you feel alone,
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.
And so will I.
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.

It's not funny, Ed.

Hey, shut up!

Will you knock it off?
Well, he started it.
Look at you guys.
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.
Man, I hate dangling.
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin' the joint.
Man, I hate lions.
So pushy.
And hairy.
And stinky.
And, man, are they...
ugly!
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.
Oh.
Oh, Scar. It's just you.
We were afraid it was
somebody important.
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
Yeah.
I see.
Now that's power!
Tell me about it.
I just hear that name and I shudder.
Mufasa!
Ooh! Do it again.
Mufasa!
Ooooh!
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!
Ooh, it tingles me.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're
one of us. I mean, you're our pal.
Charmed.
Oh, I like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.
Yeah. Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya?
I don't think you really deserve this.
I practically giftwrapped
those cubs for you,
and you couldn't even dispose of them.
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly
like they was alone, Scar.
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?
Kill Mufasa?

Precisely.
I know that your powers
of retention 
Are as wet as a warthog's backside 
But thick as you are, pay attention 
My words are a matter of pride 
It's clear from your vacant expressions 
The lights are not all on upstairs 
But we're talking kings
and successions 
Even you can't be caught unawares 
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime 
Be prepared for sensational news 
A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer 
And where do we feature? 
Just listen to teacher 
I know it sounds sordid 
But you'll be rewarded 
When at last I am given my dues 
And injustice deliciously squared 
Be prepared 
Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared. For what?
For the death of the king.
Why, is he sick?
No, fool, we're going to kill him.
And Simba, too.
Great idea. Who needs a king?

No king, no king, lala lala la la 
Idiots! There will be a king!
Hey, but you said...
I will be king!
Stick with me,
and you'll never go hungry again.
Yeah! All right!
Long live the king!
Long live the king! Long live the king!
It's great that we'll soon be connected 
With a king who'll be alltime adored 
Of course, quid pro quo
you're expected 
To take certain duties on board 
The future is littered with prizes 
And though I'm the main addressee 
The point that I must emphasize is 
You won't get a sniff without me! 
So prepare for the coup of the century 
Be prepared for the murkiest scam 
Meticulous planning 
Tenacity spanning 
Decades of denial 
ls simply why I'll be king undisputed 
Respected, saluted 
And seen for the wonder I am 
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared 
Be prepared 
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared 
Be prepared 

You wait here. Your father has
a marvelous surprise for you.
Ooh, what is it?
If I told you, it wouldn't be
a surprise now, would it?
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.
Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy.
Come on, Uncle Scar.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is just for you and your daddy.
You know, a sort of fatherson thing.
Well, I'd better go get him.
I'll go with you.
No.
No. Just stay on this rock.
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess
like you did with the hyenas.
You know about that?
Simba, everybody knows about that.
Really?
Oh, yes.
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?
Oh, and just between us,
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours, hmm?
Oh. Okay.
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?
Simba, it's to die for.

Shut up.
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.
Stay put.
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.
There he is. Let's go.
"Little roar." Puh!
Rarr!
Rrrarr!
Rarr!



Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.
Odd.
Mufasa, quick.
Stampede in the gorge.
Simba's down there!
Simba?
Zazu, help me!
Your father is on the way! Hold on!
Hurry!
There! There on that tree!
Hold on, Simba!
Dad!
Oh, Scar, this is awful!
What'll we do? What'll we do?
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.
Dad!
Scar!
Brother.
Brother, help me!
Long live the king.
No!

Dad!

Dad?
Dad?
Dad, come on.
You got to get up.
Dad?
We got to go home.
Help! 
Somebody!
Anybody.
Help.

Simba. What have you done?
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
Of course. Of course you didn't.
No one ever means for
these things to happen.
But the king is dead.
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.
Oh, what will your mother think?
What am I going to do?
Run away, Simba.
Run. Run away and never return.
Kill him.

Whoa!
Yow!

Aah! Ohh! Yeow!
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.
So go get him.
There ain't no way I'm going in there.
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?
But we got to finish the job.
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.
Yeah! You hear that?
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!

Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.
So it is with a heavy heart
that I assume the throne.
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise
to greet the dawning of a new era
in which lion and hyena come together
in a great and glorious future.



Yaaaah!
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.
Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time.
Uhoh.
Hey, Timon, you better come look.
I think it's still alive.
Eeeuw.
All righty, what have we got here?


Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.
Can we keep him?
Pumbaa, are you nuts?
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.
But he's so little.
He's going to get bigger.
Maybe he'll be on our side.
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.
So we're keeping him?
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?
Uh...
My point exactly.
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.
You okay, kid?
I guess so.
You nearly died.
I saved you.

Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, where you going?
Nowhere.
Gee, he looks blue.
I'd say brownish gold.
No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.
Kid, what's eating you?
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.
The food chain!
Ahem.
So, where you from?
Who cares? I can't go back.
Ah, you're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.
What'd you do, kid?
Something terrible.
But I don't want to talk about it.
We don't want to hear about it.
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?
Not unless you can change the past.
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,
"You got to put your
behind in your past."
No, no, no.
I mean...
Amateur.
Lie down before you hurt yourself.
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?
Right.
Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you,
You turn your back on the world.
Well, that's not what I was taught.
Then maybe you need a new lesson.
Repeat after me. Ahem.
Hakuna matata. 
What'?
Hakuna matata. 
It means "no worries".
Hakuna matata. 
What a wonderful phrase.
Hakuna matata. 
Ain't no passing craze 
It means no worries 
For the rest of your days 
It's our problemfree philosophy 
Hakuna matata 
Hakuna matata? 
Yeah. It's our motto.
What's a motto?
Nothin'. What'samotto with you?
You know, kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example. Why...
When he was
a young warthog 
When I was a young warthog 
Very nice.
Thanks.
He found his aroma
lacked a certain appeal 
He could clear the savanna
after every meal 
I'm a sensitive soul 
Though I seem thickskinned 

And it hurt that my friends
never stood downwind 
And, oh, the shame
He was ashamed 
Thought of changing my name
Oh, what's in a name? 
And I got downhearted 
How did you feel?
Every time that l... 
Hey, not in front of the kids.
Oh, sorry.
Hakuna matata 
What a wonderful phrase 
Hakuna matata 
Ain't no passing craze 
It means no worries 
For the rest of your days 
Yeah, sing it, kid.
It's our problemfree 
Philosophy 
Hakuna matata 
Welcome to our humble home.
You live here?
We live wherever we want.
Yep. Home is where your rump rests.
It's beautiful.
I'm starved.
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.
Ah. We're fresh out of zebra.
Any antelope?
Nuhuh.
Hippo?
Nope.
Listen, kid, if you live with us,
you have to eat like us.
Hey, this looks like a good spot
to rustle up some grub.
Eugh, what's that?
A grub. What's it look like?
Eugh! Gross.
Mmm. Tastes like chicken.
Slimy yet satisfying.
These are rare delicacies. Mmm.
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.
You'll learn to love them.
I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life,
no rules, no responsibilities.
Ooh, the little creamfilled kind.
And best of all, no worries.
Well, kid?
Oh, well. Hakuna matata. 
Slimy, yet satisfying.
That's it.
Hakuna matata 
Hakuna matata 
Hakuna matata

It means no worries 
For the rest of your days 
It's our problemfree

Brrrrrr!
Hakuna matata 
Hakuna matata 
Yeah 
Tata!
Ha ha ha!
Nobody knows 
The trouble I've seen 
Nobody knows 
My sorrow 
Oh, Zazu, do lighten up.
Sing something with a little bounce in it.
It's a small world after all 
No, no! Anything but that!
I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts 
Deedle dee dee 
There they are astanding in a row 
Big ones, small ones,
some as big as your head 
I would never have had
to do this with Mufasa.
What? What did you say?
Nothing.
You know the law.
Never, ever mention that name
in my presence. I am the king!
Yes, sire, you are the king.
I... I only mentioned it
to illustrate the differences
in your royal managerial approaches.
Hey, boss.
Oh, what is it this time?
We got a bone to pick with you.
I'll handle this.
Scar, there's no food, no water.
Yeah. It's dinner time
and we ain't got no stinking entrées.
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
Oh...
Eat Zazu.
Oh, you wouldn't want me.
I'd be so tough and gamey and...
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.
I thought things
were bad under Mufasa.
What did you say?
I said Muf...
I said qué pasa? 
Good. Now get out.
But we're still hungry.
Out!


Whoa! Nice one, Simba.
Thanks.
Man, I'm stuffed.
Me, too.
I ate like a pig.
Pumbaa, you are a pig.
Oh. Right.

Timon?
Yeah?
Ever wonder what those
sparkling dots are up there?
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.
Oh? What are they?
They're fireflies.
Fireflies that got stuck
up in that big blueishblack thing.
Oh, gee.
I always thought they were balls of gas
burning billions of miles away.
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.
Simba, what do you think?
Well, I don't know.
Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give.
Come on. We told you ours. Please?
Well...
Somebody once told me
that the great kings of the past
are up there watching over us.
Really?
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys
are watching us?
Pffff!
Who told you something like that?
Yeah, yeah.
What mook made that up?
Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?
Aw, you're killing me.
Yeah.

Was it something I said?


Hmm.

Hmm.
Simba?
He's... He's alive? He's alive!

It is time.
Awimoweh, awimoweh 
Awimoweh, awimoweh 
In the jungle, the mighty jungle 
The lion sleeps tonight 
In the jungle, the mighty jungle 
The lion sleeps to... 
I can't hear you, buddy. Back me up.
Awiiiiii 
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 
APumbaabumbaaweh 
Pumbaa? Pumbaa?

Hmm?

Timon?

Aaggghh!

Pumbaa?
Pumbaa! Pumbaa!
Pumbaa, Pumbaa!
Hey, what's going on?
She's going to eat me!
Huh?
Whoa! Jeez, why do I always
have to save your...
Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you.
Everything's going to be okay.
Get her! Bite her head!
Go for the jugular! The jugular!
See, I told you he'd come in handy.

Nala?
Is it really you?
Who are you?
It's me. Simba.
Simba?
Whoa! How did you...
Wow!
Where did you come from?
This is gr... It's great to see you!
Hey, what's goin' on here?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
Hey! What's goin' on here?
Timon, this is Nala.
She's my best friend.
Friend?
Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.
Huh?
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
The pleasure is all mine.
How do you... Whoa, whoa!
Time out! Let me get this straight.
You know her, she knows you.
But she wants to eat him,
and everybody's okay with this?
Did I miss something?
Relax, Timon.
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.
And your mother, what will she think?
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
They do?
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.
He did? What else did he tell you?
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.
King? Lady, have you got
your lions crossed!
King?
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
Stop it.
It's not gravel, it's grovel.
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?
No.
Simba!
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,
but that was a long time ago.
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?
Look, I'm still the same guy.
But with power.
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?
Hey, whatever she has to say,
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?
Mm...
Maybe you'd better go.
It starts. You think you know a guy.

Timon and Pumbaa,
you learn to love 'em.
What?
What is it?
It's like you're back from the dead.
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.
What it means to me.
Hey, it's okay.
I've really missed you.
I've missed you, too.
I tell you, Pumbaa.
This stinks.
Oh, sorry.
Not you! Them!
Him, her, alone.
What's wrong with that?
I can see what's happening 
What?
And they don't have a clue 
Who?
They'll fall in love
and here's the bottom line 
Our trio's down to two 
Oh.

The sweet caress of twilight 
There's magic everywhere 
And with all this
romantic atmosphere 
Disaster's in the air 
Can you feel the love tonight? 
The peace the evening brings 
The world for once 
In perfect harmony 
With all its living things 
So many things to tell her 
But how to make her see 
The truth about my past? 
Impossible, she'd turn away from me 
He's holding back, he's hiding 
But what, I can't decide 
Why won't he be
the king I know he is? 
The king I see inside? 
Can you feel the love tonight? 
The peace the evening brings 
The world for once 
In perfect harmony 
With all its living things 
Can you feel the love tonight? 
You needn't look too far 
Stealing through 
The night's uncertainties 
Love is where they are 
And if he falls in love tonight 

It can be assumed 
His carefree days 
With us are history 
In short, our pal 
ls doomed 
Isn't this a great place?
It is beautiful.
But I don't understand something.
You've been alive all this time.
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.
And I did, and it's great.
We've really needed you at home.
No one needs me.
Yes, we do. You're the king.
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.
What?
Everything's destroyed.
There's no food, no water.
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.
I can't go back.
Why?
You wouldn't understand.
What?
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
Hakuna matata. 
What?
Hakuna matata. 
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...
Simba...
...and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?
Because it's your responsibility.
Well, what about you? You left.
I left to find help, and I found you.
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.
Sorry.
What's happened to you?
You're not the Simba I remember.
You're right. I'm not.
Now are you satisfied?
No. Just disappointed.
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.
Good. At least one of us does.
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know
what I've been through.
I would if you'd just tell me.
Forget it!
Fine!
She's wrong. I can't go back.
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.
You can't change the past.
You said you'd always be there for me!
But you're not.
And it's because of me.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.

Asante sana, squash banana
We we nugu, imi mi apana 
Come on, will you cut it out?
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!

Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?
Who are you?
The question is, who are you?
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.
Well, I know who you are.
Shh. Come here. It's a secret.
Asante sana, squash banana 
Grrr! Enough!
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you are a baboon, and I'm not.
I think you're a little confused.
Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.
You don't even know who you are.
Oh, and I suppose you know.
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.
Bye.
Hey, wait!
You knew my father?
Correction, I know your father.
I hate to tell you this,
but he died a long time ago.
Nope. Wrong again!
Ha ha ha!
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.
You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way. Come on!
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!
Hey, whoa, wait, wait.
Come on. Come on!
Would you slow down?

Stop!
Look down there.
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.
No.
Look harder.
You see?
He lives in you.
Simba.
Father?
Simba, you have forgotten me.
No. How could I?
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.
Look inside yourself, Simba.
You are more than
what you have become.
You must take your place
in the circle of life.
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.
Remember who you are.
You are my son and the one true king.
Remember who you are.
No! Please, don't leave me!
Remember.
Father!
Remember!
Don't leave me.
Remember.
What was that? Ha ha!
The weather. 
Very peculiar, don't you think?
Yeah.
Looks like the winds are changing.
Ahh, change is good.
Yeah, but it's not easy.
I know what I have to do, but going
back means I'll have to face my past.
I've been running from it
for so long.
Ow! Jeez! What was that for?
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.
Yeah, but it still hurts.
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.
But the way I see it
you can either run from it
or learn from it.
Ah! You see?
So what are you going to do?
First, I'm gonna take your stick.
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!
Hey! Where are you going?
I'm going back!
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

Whoo! Ha ha ha!
Whoooo! Whoooo!

Grubs! Grubs!
Hey. Hey, wake up.
It's okay! Whoa, whoa!
It's okay! It's me!
Don't ever do that again.
Carnivores! Oy!
Have you guys seen Simba?
I thought he was with you.
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?
Ho ho! You won't find him here!
Ha ha! The king has returned.
I can't believe it. He's gone back!
Gone back? What do you mean?
Hey, what's goin' on here?
Who's the monkey?
Simba went back to challenge Scar.
Who?
Scar.
Who's got a scar?
No, it's his uncle.
The monkey's his uncle?
No!
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.
Oh.
Simba, wait up!
It's awful, isn't it?
I didn't want to believe you.
What made you come back?
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,
and I've got the bump to prove it.
Besides, this is my kingdom.
If I don't fight for it, who will?
I will.
It's gonna be dangerous.
Danger? Ha!
I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha!
I see nothing funny about this.
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?
At your service, my liege.
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle
for this?
Yes, Timon. This is my home.
Oh. Talk about your fixerupper!
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?
Live bait.
Good idea. Hey!
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

Luau!
If you're hungry for a hunk
of fat and juicy meat 
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here
because he is a treat 
Come on down and dine
on this tasty swine 
All you have to do is get in line 
Are you achin' 
Yep, yep, yep.
For some bacon? 
Yep, yep, yep.
He's a big pig 
Yep, yep.
You could be a big pig, too! Oi! 
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.
I'll look for Scar.

Sarabi!

Yes, Scar?
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.
It's over. There is nothing left.
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.
We're not going anywhere.
You have sentenced us to death.
Then so be it.
You can't do that.
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.
If you were half the king Mufasa was...
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

Mufasa? No, you're dead.

Mufasa?
No. It's me.
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?
It doesn't matter. I'm home.
Simba?
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised
to see you
alive.
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.
Oh, Simba, you must understand.
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.
Oh, well, I would, naturally.
However, there is one little problem.
You see them?
They think I'm king.
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.
The choice is yours, Scar.
Either step down or fight.
Oh, must this all end in violence?
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.
Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
That's not gonna work, Scar.
I've put it behind me.
But what about your faithful subjects?
Have they put it behind them?
Simba, what is he talking about?
Ah, so you haven't told them
your little secret.
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.
I am.
It's not true.
Tell me it's not true.
It's true.
You see? He admits it!
Murderer!
No! It was an accident.
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!
Do you deny it?
No.
Then you're guilty.
No, I'm not a murderer!
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,
and now everyone knows why!
Simba!
Now, this looks familiar.
Hmm.
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think. Hmm.
Oh, yes. I remember.
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.
And here's my little secret.
I killed Mufasa.
No! Murderer!
No, Simba, please.
Tell them the truth.
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...
All right.
All right.
I did it.
So they can hear you.
I killed Mufasa!
Heeyah!
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff. Whoo!


Aagghh!
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me in! Let me in!

Please, don't eat me.
Drop 'em!
Hey, who's the pig?
Are you talkin' to me?
Uhoh. He called him a pig.
To me?
Shouldn't have done that.
To me?
Now they're in for it.
They call me Mr. Pig!
Aaaaggghhh!
Take that, you stupid...
Take that and that!
Run, you yellowbelly!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!


Murderer.
Simba. Simba, please.
Please, have mercy. I beg you.
You don't deserve to live.
But Simba, I am family.
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.
It was their fault. It was their idea.
Why should I believe you?
Everything you ever told me was a lie.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.
No, Scar.
I'm not like you.
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?
Tell me. I mean, anything.
Run.
Run away, Scar,
and never return.
Er... Yes.
Of course.
As you wish,
Your Majesty!

Ah, my friends!
Friends? I thought he said
we were the enemy.
Yeah. That's what I heard.
Ed?
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand!
No, I didn't mean... No! No!
It is time.
Remember.

Circle of

There's a calm surrender 
To the rush of day 
When the heat of a rolling wind 
Can be turned away 
An enchanted moment 
And it sees me through 
It's enough for this restless warrior 
Just to be with you 
And can you feel 
The love tonight? 
It is where we are 
It's enough 
For this wideeyed wanderer 
That we got this far 
And can you feel 
The love tonight? 
How it's laid to rest? 
It's enough 
To make kings and vagabonds 
Believe the very best 
There's a time for everyone 
If they only learn 
That the twisting kaleidoscope 
Moves us all in turn 
There's a rhyme and reason 
To the wild outdoors 
When the heart
of this starcrossed voyager 
Beats in time with yours 
And can you feel
