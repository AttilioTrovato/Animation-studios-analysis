Come on, Sven.
Elsa. Psst!
Elsa!
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up!
Anna, go back to sleep.
I just can't.
The sky is awake,
so I'm awake.
So, we have to play.
Go play by yourself.
Do you want to build
a snowman?
Come on, come on,
come on!
Do the magic!
Do the magic!
Oh...
Ready?
Uhhuh.
This is amazing!
Watch this!
Hi, I'm Olaf,
and I like warm hugs.
I love you, Olaf!
Olaf...
Tickle bumps!
Oh!
Hang on!
Catch me!
Gotcha!
Again!
Wait!
Whoohoo!
Slow down!
Whoo!
Anna!
Anna!
Mama! Papa!
No, no...
You're okay, Anna.
I got you.
Elsa,
what have you done?
This is getting
out of hand.
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!
Oh. She's ice cold.
I know where we have to go.
Ice?
Faster, Sven.
Sven!
Please! Help!
It's my daughter.
It's the king.
Trolls?
Shush!
I'm trying to listen.
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.
Your Majesty.
Born with the powers,
or cursed?
Born.
And they're getting stronger.
Here, here.
You are lucky
it wasn't her heart.
The heart is not
so easily changed.
But the head can
be persuaded.
Do what you must.
I recommend
we remove all magic.
Even memories of magic,
to be safe.
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.
She will be okay.
But she won't remember
I have powers?
It's for the best.
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.
There is beauty in it...
But also great danger.
You must learn
to control it.
Fear will be your enemy.
No!
We'll protect her.
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.
Until then...
We'll lock the gates.
We'll reduce the staff.
We will limit her contact
with people,
and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.
Including Anna.
Ah.

Welcome to Arendelle!
Watch your step, please.
The gates will be
opening soon.
Why do I have
to wear this?
Because the queen
has come of age.
It's Coronation Day!
That's not my fault.
What do
you want, Sven?
"Give me a snack."
What's the magic word?
"Please."
Uh! Uhuhuh. Share.
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!
And for a whole day!
Faster, Percy!
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.
Open those gates
so I may unlock
your secrets
and exploit your riches.
Did I say that out loud?
Oh! Me sore eyes
can't wait
to see the queen
and the princess.
I bet they are
absolutely lovely.
I bet they are beautiful.
Princess Anna?
Princess Anna?
Huh? Yeah?
Oh. Sorry to
wake you, ma'am.
No, no, no, you didn't.
I've been up for hours.
Who is it?
Still me, ma'am.
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.
Of course.
Ready for what?
Your sister's coronation,

My sister's corneration.

Hey!
I'm so sorry.
Are you hurt?
Hey.
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I just wasn't
looking where I was going.
But I'm great, actually.
Oh... Thank goodness.
Oh! Uh...
Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.
Princess Anna of Arendelle.
"Princess"? My Lady.
Oh!
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Um...
Whew.
Hi. Again.
Oh, boy!
This is awkward.
Not "You're awkward,"
but just because we're...
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?
I'd like to
formally apologize
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.
And for every moment after.
No! No, no. It's fine.
I'm not that princess.
I mean, if you
had hit my sister Elsa,
it would be... Yeesh!
Because, you know...
Hello.
But, lucky you,
it's just me.
"Just" you?
The bells. The coronation.
I better go.
I have to go.
I better go. Uh...
Bye!
Oh, no. Oh!
Your Majesty,
the gloves.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Princess Anna of Arendelle.
Oh. Here? Are you sure?
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to...
Oh. Okay.
Hi.
"Hi" me? Oh...
Um... Hi.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look beautifuller.
I mean, not "fuller."
You don't look fuller.
But more beautiful.
Thank you.
So...
This is what a party
looks like.
It's warmer than I thought.
What is that amazing smell?
Chocolate.
Your Majesty.
The Duke of Weaseltown.
"Weselton"!
Duke of Weselton,
Your Majesty.
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting
that I offer you
your first dance as queen.
Onetwo, and jump.
Uh...
Thank you.
Only, I don't dance.
Oh...
But my sister does.
What?
Oh! Lucky you.
Oh, I don't think...
If you swoon,
let me know. I'll catch you.
Sorry.
Like an agile peacock.
Ow! Ow.
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.
Why did they shut them
in the first place?
Do you know
the reason? Hmm?
No.
No.
All right. Hang on!
They don't call me
the "Little Dipper"
for nothing!
Ohho!
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.
Your Majesty.
Let me know
when you're ready
for another round, Milady.
Well,
he was sprightly.
Especially
for a man in heels.
Are you okay?
I've never been better.
This is so nice.
I wish it could be
like this all the time.
Me, too.
But it can't.
Why not?
It just can't.
Excuse me for a minute.
I'd be honored.
Glad I caught you.
Hans.
Oop.
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!
Oh!
Oops!
Sorry.
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.
Ah.
What's this?
Uh, I was born with it.
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.
I like it.
Yeah, the whole thing.
You got it.
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have
how many brothers?
Twelve older brothers.
Three of them
pretended I was invisible,
literally, for two years.
That's horrible.
It's what brothers do.
And sisters.
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.
But then, one day,
she just shut me out,
and I never knew why.
I would never
shut you out.
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?
I love crazy.

Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?
Can I say something
even crazier?
Yes!
Coming through.
Excuse me. Oh...
Pardon. Sorry.
Oh!
Can we just get
around you there?
Thank you.
Oh! There she is.
Elsa!
I mean, Queen.
Me again. Um...
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.
Your Majesty.
We would like...
Uh, your blessing...
Of our marriage.
Marriage?
Yes!
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.
Of course, we'll have soup,
roast and ice cream.
And then...
Wait. Would we live here?
Here?
Absolutely!
Anna!
Oh!
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.
What? No, no, no.
Of course we have the room.
Wait, slow down.
No one's brothers
are staying here.
No one is getting married.
Wait, what?
May I talk to you, please?
Alone.
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.
You can if it's true love.
Anna, what do you know
about true love?
More than you.
All you know is how
to shut people out.
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.
Now, excuse me.
Your Majesty,
if I may ease your...
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.
The party is over.
Close the gates.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What?
Elsa, no, no! Wait.
Give me my glove!
Elsa, please, please.
I can't live
like this anymore!
Then leave.
What did I ever do to you?
Enough, Anna.
No, why?
Why do you shut me out?
Why do you shut the world out?
What are you so afraid of?
I said, enough!
Sorcery.
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.
Elsa.
There she is!
Yes! It is her!
Queen Elsa.
Our beautiful queen!
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?
No.
There she is! Stop her!
Please, just stay away
from me. Stay away.
Monster. Monster!
Elsa!
Elsa!
Wait, please!
Elsa, stop!
Anna!
No.
The fjord.
Snow!
Snow?
Yes, snow.
Are you all right?
No.
Did you know?
No.
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!
The queen has
cursed this land!
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.
Wait, no!
You! Is there sorcery
in you, too?
Are you a monster, too?
No, no.
I'm completely ordinary.
That's right, she is.
In the best way.
And my sister
is not a monster.
She nearly killed me!
You slipped on ice.
Her ice.
It was an accident.
She was scared.
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.
So, I'm the one
that needs
to go after her.
What?
Bring me
my horse, please.
Anna, no.
It's too dangerous.
Elsa is
not dangerous.
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.
I'm coming with you.
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.
On my honor.
I leave Prince Hans
in charge.
Are you sure
you can trust her?
I don't want you
getting hurt.
She's my sister.
She would never hurt me.

Elsa, it's me, Anna,
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
Of course, none of it
would have happened
if she had just told
me her secret.
She's a stinker.
Whoa!
Oh, no. No, no, no!
Come back!
No, no, no!
Okay.
Snow. It had to be snow.
She couldn't have
had tropical magic
that covered the fjords

Fire!
Cold, cold, cold,
cold, cold.
Ooh. "And sauna"!
Yoohoo.
Hmm?
Big summer blowout.
Half off
swimming suits, clogs,
and a sun balm
of my own invention, yah?
Oh. Great. For now, um,
how about boots?
Winter boots and dresses?
That would be
in our winter department.
Oh. Um...
I was just wondering.
Has another young woman...
The queen perhaps,
I don't know,
passed through here?
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm
is you, dear.
You and this fellow.
Yoohoo.
Big summer blowout.
Carrots.
Huh?
Behind you.
Oh! Right. Excuse me.
Oh. A real
howler in July, yes?
Wherever could it be
coming from?
The North Mountain.
North Mountain.
That will be 40.
Forty? No, 10.
Oh, dear, that's no good.
See, this is from
our winter stock,
where supply and demand
have a big problem.
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?
I sell ice for a living.
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.
I mean,
that is really...
That's
unfortunate.
Still 40.
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.
Yoohoo. Hi, family.
Yoohoo!
Ten is all I got.
Help me out.
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.
Okay, just tell me
one thing.
What was happening
on the North Mountain?
Did it seem magical?
Yes!
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.
What did you call me?
Okay, okay.
I'm out.
Whoa!
Byebye.
No, Sven,
I didn't get your carrots.
But I did find us
a place to sleep.
And it's free.
I'm sorry about
this violence.
I will add
a quart of lutefisk,
so we have good feelings.

What do you want?
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.
I don't take people places.
Let me rephrase that.
Hey.
Take me up
the North Mountain.
Please.
Look, I know how
to stop this winter.
We leave at dawn.
And you forgot
the carrots for Sven.
Oops, sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't...
We leave now.
Right now.
Whew!
Hang on!
We like to go fast.
I like fast.
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa...
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.
Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?
Ugh!
No, I was raised
in a castle.
Hmm.
So, uh, tell me,
what made the queen go
all icecrazy?
Oh. Well...
It was all my fault.
I got engaged,
but then she freaked out,
because I'd only just
met him, you know, that day.
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you
just met that day?
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,
and then she tried
to walk away,
and I grabbed her glove...
Hang on!
You mean to tell me
you got engaged
to someone you just
met that day?
Yes. Pay attention.
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time
so, I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?
Yes, they did.
But Hans is not a stranger.
Oh, yeah?
What's his last name?
"Of the
Southern Isles."
What's his favorite food?
Sandwiches.
Best friend's name?
Probably John.
Eye color?
Dreamy.
Foot size?
Foot size doesn't matter.
Have you had a meal
with him yet?
What if you hate
the way he eats?
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?
Picks his nose?
And eats it.
Excuse me, sir.
He is a prince.
All men do it.
Ew.
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.
It doesn't sound
like true love.
Are you some
sort of love expert?
No. But, uh, I have
friends who are.
You have friends
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.
Stop talking.
No, no, no. No, no.
I'd like to meet these...
No, I mean it.
Sven, go.
Go!
What are they?
Wolves.
Wolves?
What do we do?
I got this.
You just... Don't fall off,
and don't get eaten.
But I want to help!
No.
Why not?
Because I don't
trust your judgment.
Excuse me?
Who marries a man
she just met?
It's true love!
Whoa!
Whoa. Whoa!
Christopher!
It's "Kristoff"!
Ow!
Duck!
You almost set me on fire!
But I didn't.
Get ready to jump, Sven!
You don't tell him what to do.
Hey!
I do!
Jump, Sven!
Phew!
But I just paid it off.
Uhoh. No. No.
No!
Ah! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!
Grab on!
Pull, Sven. Pull!
Whoa.
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.
And I understand
if you don't want
to help me anymore.
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,
this whole thing has
ruined me for helping
anyone ever again.
It's this way?
"She'll die on her own."
I can live with that.
Here we go.
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead."
I think, actually,
it's up.
Sometimes,
I really don't like you.
Hold up! We're coming.
You are?
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.
Arendelle.
It's completely frozen.
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.
Will she?
Yeah. Now, come on.
This way
to the North Mountain?
More like this way.
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.
Yeah.
It really is beautiful,
isn't it?
But it's so white.
You know,
how about a little color?
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.
How about yellow?
No, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?
No go.
Am I right?
Hi.
You're creepy.
Whoa!
I don't want it.
Back at you.
Please don't drop me.
No.
Come on,
it's just a head.
All right.
We got off to a bad start.
Ew, ew, ew, the body!
Wait, what am I looking
at right now?
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?
All right, wait one second.
Oh. Uh...
Oh!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now, I'm perfect.
Well, almost.
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!
Head rush!
I was just...
Are you okay?
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!
I've always wanted a nose.
So cute.
It's like a little
baby unicorn.
But... Hey! Whoa!
Oh.
I love it even more.
All right,
let's start this thing over.
Hi, everyone.
I'm Olaf.
And I like warm hugs.
Olaf?
That's right. Olaf.
And you are?
Oh. Um...
I'm Anna.
And who's the funkylooking
donkey over there?
That's Sven.
Uhhuh.
And who's the reindeer?
Sven.
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things
easier for me.
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.
I like you, too.
Olaf.
Did Elsa build you?
Yeah. Why?
Do you know
where she is?
Fascinating.
Yeah. Why?
Do you think you could
show us the way?
Yeah. Why?
How does this work? Ow!
Stop it, Sven.
I'm trying to focus, here.
Yeah. Why?
I'll tell you why.
We need Elsa
to bring back summer.
Summer?
Mmmhmm.
Oh. I don't know why,
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.
And sun,
and all things hot.
Really?
I'm guessing you
don't have much
experience with heat.
Nope.
But sometimes
I like to close my eyes,
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.
♪ Bees will buzz
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz
♪ And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer
♪ A drink in my hand
♪ My snow up
against the burning sand
♪ Probably getting
gorgeously tanned
♪ In summer
♪ I'll finally see
a summer breeze
♪ Blow away a winter storm
♪ And find out
what happens to solid water
♪ When it gets warm
♪ And I can't wait to see
♪ What my buddies
all think of me
♪ Just imagine
how much cooler I'll be
♪ In summer!
♪ The hot and the cold
are both so intense
♪ Put them together
It just makes sense
♪ Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle
♪ But put me in summer
and I'll be a...
♪ Happy snowman!
♪ When life gets rough
♪ I like to hold
on to my dream
♪ Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam
♪ Oh, the sky
♪ Will be blue
♪ And you guys
will be there, too
♪ When I finally do
♪ What frozen things do
In summer!
I'm gonna tell him.
Don't you dare.
♪ In summer! ♪
So, come on!
Elsa's this way.
Let's go bring back summer!
I'm coming!
Somebody's gotta
tell him.
No, no. You've got
the bark facing down.
The bark needs
to be faceup.
Bark down is drier.
Bark up!
Bark down!
Papa!
Cloak? Does anyone
need a cloak?
Arendelle is indebted
to you, Your Highness.
The castle is open.
There is soup and hot glogg
in the great hall.
Here, pass these out.
Prince Hans!
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?
Princess Anna
has given her orders.
And that's another thing!
Has it dawned on you
that your princess
may be conspiring
with a wicked sorceress
to destroy us all?
Do not question
the princess.
She left me in charge
and I will not hesitate
to protect Arendelle
from treason.
Treason?
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, boy. Easy.
Easy.
It's Princess Anna's
horse.
So, where is
the princess?
Where could she be?
Where is she?
Princess Anna is in trouble.
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.
I'll go.
I volunteer.
I volunteer
two men, My Lord.
Be prepared for anything.
And should you encounter
the queen,
you are to put an end
to this winter.
Do you understand?
Hmm.
So, how exactly
are you planning
to stop this weather?
Oh. I am gonna
talk to my sister.
That's your plan?
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?
Yep.
So, you're not at all
afraid of her?
Why would I be?
Yeah.
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.
Oh. Look at that.
I've been impaled.
What now?
Mmm...
It's too steep.
I've only got one rope
and you don't know
how to climb mountains.
Says who?
Hmm?
What are you doing?
I'm going to see my sister.
You're gonna
kill yourself.
I wouldn't put
my foot there.
You're distracting me.
Or there.
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?
All right.
I'm just blocking you out
because I gotta
concentrate, here.
You know,
most people who disappear
into the mountains
want to be alone.
Nobody wants to be alone.
Except maybe you.
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?
You mean,
the love experts?
Yes, the love experts.
Ah...
Please tell me
I'm almost there.
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?
Hang on.
Hey, Sven?
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly
where you wanted to go.
Haha! Thank goodness.
Catch!
Thanks. That was like
a crazy trust exercise.
Whoa.
Now, that's ice.
I might cry.
Go ahead.
I won't judge.
All right, take it easy,
boy. Come here.
I got you.
Okay. You stay
right here, buddy.
Flawless.
Knock.
Just knock.
Why isn't
she knocking?
Do you think
she knows how to knock?
Huh.
It opened.
That's a first.
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.
What?
The last time
I introduced her to a guy,
she froze everything.
But, but...
Oh, come on!
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!
Bye, Sven.
You, too, Olaf.
Me?
Just give us a minute.
Okay.
One, two,
three...
Four...
Whoa.
Elsa?
It's me, Anna.
Anna.
Whoa. Elsa,
you look different.
It's a good different.
And this place...
It's amazing.
Thank you.
I never knew
what I was capable of.
I'm so sorry
about what happened.
If I'd have known...
No, no, no. It's okay.
You don't have
to apologize, but you
should probably go.
Please.
But I just got here.
You belong down
in Arendelle.
So do you.
No, Anna,
I belong here.
Alone.
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.
Actually, about that...
Sixty!
Wait. What is that?
Hi! I'm Olaf
and I like warm hugs!
Olaf?
Yeah. You built me.
Remember that?
And you're alive?
Um...
I think so.
He's just like the one
we built as kids.
Yeah.
Elsa, we were so close.
We can be like
that again.
Catch me!
Slow down!
Anna!
No.
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.
Elsa, wait.
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.
Please don't
shut me out again.

Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
Who's this?
Wait, it doesn't matter.
Just...
You have to go.
No, I know we can
figure this out together.
How?
What power do you have
to stop this winter?
To stop me?
Anna, I think we should go.
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.
Yes, you are.
Stop! Put us down!
Go away.
Heads up!
Watch out for my butt!
It is not nice
to throw people!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
feistypants. Okay, relax.
Just calm down! Calm down!
Okay! All right!
I'm okay.
Just let the snowman be.
I'm calm.
Great.
Oh! Come on!
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.
I'll distract him.
You guys go.
No, no! Not you guys!
This just got
a whole lot harder.
Look out!
Run! Run!
What are you doing?
I got him!
Whoa! Stop!
It's a 100foot drop.
It's 200.
Ow!
What's that for?
I'm digging a snow anchor.
Okay. What if we fall?
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.
It'll be like landing
on a pillow.
Hopefully.
Okay, Anna. On three.
Okay.
One...
You tell me when.
I'm ready to go.
Two...
I was born ready! Yes!
Calm down.
Tree!
What the... Whoa!
That happened.
Man,
am I out of shape.
There we go. Hey, Anna!
Sven! Where did
you guys go?
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.
Hey! We were just
talking about you.
All good things,
all good things.
No!
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?
Olaf!
Hang in there, guys!
Go. Go faster!
Wait, what?
Hey!
Ow!
Kristoff!
Don't come back!
We won't.
Hey, you were right.
Just like a pillow.
Olaf!
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!
Those are my legs.
Ooh!
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.
Oh. That feels better.
Hey, Sven! He found us.
Who's my cute
little reindeer?
Don't talk to him like that.
You're tickling me.
Here.
Whoa!
Are you okay?
Thank you.
How's your head?
Ah! Ooh!
It's fine. Uh...
Uh, I'm good.
I've got a thick skull.
I don't have a skull.
Or bones.
So, uh...
So, now what?
Now what?
Now what?
Oh...
What am I gonna do?
She threw me out.
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.
And then there's
your ice business.
Hey, hey. Don't worry
about my ice business.
Worry about your hair!
What? I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.
No, yours is
turning white.
White? It's...
What?
It's because she struck you,
isn't it?
Does it look bad?
No.
You hesitated.
No, I didn't.
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.
Okay! Where are we going?
To see my friends.
The love experts?
Love experts?
Uhhuh.
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.
How do you know?
Because I've seen them
do it before.
I like to consider myself
a love expert.
Get it together.
Control it.
Don't feel. Don't feel.
Don't feel.
Don't feel!
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.
Are you cold?
A little.
Uh...
Wait. Come here.
Huh?
Ooh.
So, uh, about my friends.
Well...
I say "friends"...
They're more like family.
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.
They did?
Yeah.
I don't want to scare you.
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.
Very loud.
They are also stubborn
at times,
and a little overbearing.
And heavy.
Really, really, heavy.
But you'll get it.
They mean well.
Kristoff,
they sound wonderful.
Okay, then.
Meet my family.
Hey, guys.
They're rocks.
You are
a sight for sore eyes.
He's crazy.
Rocko's looking sharp,
as usual.
Clay, whoa...
I don't even recognize you.
You lost so much weight.
I'll distract
him while you run.
Hi, Sven's family!
It's nice to meet you.
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!
Why aren't
you running?
Uh...
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.
Go.
No, no, no. Anna, wait.
Kristoff!
Whoa!
Hey!
Kristoff's home!
Kristoff's here!
Kristoff's home!
Wait, "Kristoff"?
Uhhuh.
Ah, let me look at you.
Take off your clothes,
I wash them.
No! No, I'm going
to keep my clothes on.
Look, it's great
to see you all,
but where's Granpabbie?
He's napping.
But look, I grew a mushroom.
I...
I earned my fire crystal.
I passed a kidney stone.
Kristoff, pick me up.
You're getting big.
Good for you.
Trolls. They're trolls!
He's brought a girl!
A girl!
Whoa!
Is that
a real girl?
She's like
a little cupcake.
What's going on?
I've learned
to just roll with it.
Let me see.
Bright eyes, working nose,
strong teeth!
Yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, um, no.
No.
You've got the wrong idea.
No. That's not why
I brought her here.
Right. We're not... I'm not...

Anna?
She's as cold as ice.
There is strange magic here.
Granpabbie.
Come, come.
Bring her here to me.
Anna, your life is
in danger.
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.
If not removed,
to solid ice will
you freeze, forever.
What? No.
But you can
remove it, right?
I cannot.
I'm sorry, Kristoff.
If it was her head,
that would be easy.
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.
An act of true love?
A true love's kiss,
perhaps?
Something's wrong.
Are you all right?
Anna, we've got to get
you back to Hans.
Hans.
Pull us out, Sven.
Olaf, come on!
I'm coming!
Let's go kiss Hans!
Who is this Hans?
We are here to find
Princess Anna.
Be on guard,
but no harm is
to come to the queen.
Do you understand?
Yes, Your Grace.
The queen.
Go, go!
Come on!
There!
Up there!
Come on!
We got her.
No. Please.
Go around.
Toss it.
Stay away!
Look out!
Fire! Fire!
Get her!
Ah!
Come on!
Grab his arm.
Aim...
This way, this way!
Whoa!
Queen Elsa!
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.
Oh, no. What have...
What have I done?
Why did you
bring me here?
I couldn't just
let them kill you.
But I'm a danger
to Arendelle. Get Anna.
Anna has not returned.
If you would just
stop the winter.
Bring back summer, please.
Don't you see?
I can't.
You have to tell them
to let me go.
I will do what I can.
Just hang in there.
Come on, buddy, faster!
Oh, boy!
Whoa! I'll meet you guys
at the castle!
Stay out
of sight, Olaf.
I will!
Hello!
It's alive!
It's Princess Anna!
Are you
gonna be okay?
Don't worry about me.
Anna!
You had us worried sick.
My Lady.
Get her warm. And find
Prince Hans, immediately.
We will. Thank you.
Make sure she's safe.
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.
You cannot risk going
out there again.
If anything happens to her...
If anything happens
to the princess,
you are all
Arendelle has left.
He's in here.
Prince Hans.
Anna.
You're so cold.
Hans, you have
to kiss me.
What?
Now! Now!
Slow down.
We'll give you two
some privacy.
What happened out there?
Elsa struck me
with her powers.
You said she would
never hurt you.
I was wrong.
Anna.
She froze my heart,
and only an act
of true love can save me.
A true love's kiss.
Oh, Anna.
If only there was
someone out there
who loved you.
What?
You said you did.
As thirteenth in line
in my own kingdom,
I didn't stand a chance.
I knew I would have
to marry into
the throne somewhere.
What... What are
you talking about?
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.
But you...
Hans!
You were so desperate
for love,
you were willing
to marry me just like that.
I figured
after we married,
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.
Hans!
No. Stop.
But then,
she doomed herself,
and you were dumb enough
to go after her.
Please.
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,
and bring back summer.
You're no match for Elsa.
No, you're no
match for Elsa.
I, on the other hand,
am the hero who is
going to save Arendelle
from destruction.
You won't get
away with this.
Oh...
I already have.
Please, somebody, help.
Please. Please.
It's getting colder
by the minute.
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.
Prince Hans.
Princess Anna is...
Dead.
What?
What happened to her?
She was killed.
By Queen Elsa.
No!
Her own sister.
At least we got to say
our marriage vows
before she died in my arms.
There can be no doubt now.
Queen Elsa is a monster,
and we are all
in grave danger.
Prince Hans,
Arendelle looks to you.
With a heavy heart,
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.
And sentence her to death.
Hurry up!
She's dangerous.
Move quickly.
Careful.
It won't open!
It's frozen shut.
Put your back
into it!
Come on! Push!
What is it, buddy?
Hey, watch it.
What's wrong with you?
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.
Stop it!
Put me down!
No, Sven!
We're not going back.
She's with her true love.
What the...
Anna!
Come on!
Come on, boy.
Help.
Anna!
Oh, no.
Olaf?
Olaf. Get away
from there.
Wow!
So, this is heat.
I love it.
Ooh! But don't touch it.
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.
But we ran
all the way here.
Please, Olaf, you can't
stay here. You'll melt.
I am not leaving
here until
we find some other act
of true love to save you.
Do you happen to have
any ideas?
I don't even know
what love is.
That's okay, I do.
Love is
putting someone else's
needs before yours.
Like, you know, how Kristoff
brought you back here
to Hans and left you forever.
Kristoff loves me?
Wow, you really
don't know anything
about love, do you?
Olaf, you're melting.
Some people are
worth melting for.
Just maybe not right
this second.
Don't worry,
I've got it.
We're gonna get through...
Oh, wait.
Hang on,
I'm getting something.
It's Kristoff
and Sven!
They're coming back this way.
They... They are?
Wow! He's really
moving fast.
I guess I was wrong.
I guess Kristoff doesn't
love you enough
to leave you behind.
Help me up, Olaf. Please.
No, no, no!
You need to stay
by the fire and keep warm.
I need to get to Kristoff.
Why?
Oh, I know why!
There's your act
of true love right there!
Riding across the fjords
like a valiant,
pungent reindeer king!
Come on!
Look out!
Oh!
Uh... Back this way.
We're trapped.
Oh...
Whoa!
Slide, Anna!
We made it!
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!
Come on, buddy, faster.
Kristoff!
Keep going!
Kristoff!
Come on!
No.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Sven... Sven!
Good boy.
Kristoff.
Kristoff...
Anna...
Anna!
Elsa! You can't
run from this!
Just take care of my sister.
Your sister?
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.
She said that
you froze her heart.
No.
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white.
Your sister is dead.
Because of you.
No.
Kristoff.
Anna!
Elsa?
No!
Anna!
Oh. Anna!
No, no!
Please, no.
Anna?
Anna?
Oh, Elsa.
You sacrificed yourself
for me?
I love you.
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart."
"Love will thaw."
Love. Of course.
Elsa?
Love!
I knew you could do it.
Hands down, this is
the best day of my life.
And, quite possibly,
the last.
Oh, Olaf!
Hang on, little guy.
Oh, oh, oh!
My own personal flurry!
Uhuhuhuh.
Anna?
But she froze your heart.
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.
Wonderful!
Setting course, sir.
I will return this scoundrel
to his country.
We shall see
what his 12 big brothers
think of his behavior.
Arendelle thanks you, milord.
This is unacceptable.
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.
Ah! My neck hurts.
Is there a doctor that
I could see?
And I demand
to see the queen!
Oh. I have a message
from the queen.
"Arendelle will
henceforth and forever
"no longer do business
of any sort with Weaseltown."
"Weselton."

Let's go.

Whoops! Sorry.
Okay, okay.
Here we are. Oh!

Arendelle Ice Master
and Deliverer.

Glide and pivot.
And glide and pivot.
Go.
Oh!
