Whoa! It's raining cats
and dogs out there!
I hope they make it
back all right.
Heads up! Andy's coming!
Andy, time for dinner.
Yes! I'm starving!
Don't forget
to wash your hands!
Okay, Mom!
Do you see him?
No.
Well, he's done for.
He'll be lost! Forever!
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.
The rest of you,
stay put.
Bo!
Situation?
Lost toy.
Side yard.
Billy. Goat. Gruff.
Raise the blinds.
They have names?
You never told me that.
You never asked.
Where is he?
There!
How do we reach him?
Operation PullToy!
Slink!
You got it, Woody!
Barbies!
Go!
Flashlight.
Hang on, R.C.!
I ain't got any more slink!
Oh, it's beautiful.
I'm so glad to see
this old lamp
go to a good home.
We've had it since
Molly was a baby.
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?
Yeah,
I don't want it anymore.
Thank you.
Where's Woody?
Yeah, hi. I think
I left my keys here.
Woody.
Quick!
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.
Woody, it's okay.
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!
What's best for Andy
is that...
Woody.
I'm not Andy's toy.
What?
It's time for
the next kid.
Oh, and thank you again
for everything.
I really appreciate it.
Oh, my pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.
You know, kids lose
their toys every day.
Sometimes they get
left in the yard...
or put in the wrong box.
And that box
gets taken away.
Mom, where's Woody?
Andy! Come inside!
I can't find Woody!
Well, good night.
Goodbye.
Drive safe.
Oh, there you are.
Mom, I found him!
I found him!
Oh, good.
Come on and get inside.
You've got a friend in me 
Reach for the sky! 
You've got a friend in me 
Ride 'em, cowboy! Yeehaw!
When the road looks 
rough ahead
There's a snake in my boot. 
And you're miles and miles 
From your nice warm bed
You just remember 
what your old pal said
Boy, you've got 
a friend in me
To infinity and beyond!
Yeah, you've got 
a friend in me
My cowboy!
Now, some other folks 
might be a little bit
smarter than I am
Big and stronger, too 
Woody, let's go!
Maybe 
But none of them will ever 
love you the way I do
You're my favorite deputy! 
It's me and you, boy 
And as the years go by 
Our friendship 
will never die
Reach for the sky!
You're gonna see 
it's our destiny
They've escaped and they're
headed right for us!
You've got a friend in me 
Full speed ahead! Yay! 
You've got a friend in me 
You've got a friend in me ? 
It's getting hot in here!
Where's my ear?
You're on my foot!
Oh, hey,
quit shoving.
Sorry!
Could you move over
a bit, please?
That was my horn.
To infinity and beyond! 
I know that was you,
Potato Head.
Everyone, listen.
I thought I told you...
when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that...
expect to be put
in the closet.
How much longer?
Keep it to
a dull roar, Rex.
Deep breaths, Jessie.
Deep breaths.
Settle down, Slink.
Sit. Good boy!
Sheriff,
do I need to be worried?
No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there.
Good. Just keep them calm
until we get word.
Yes, ma'am.
How are you, uh,
feeling about today?
Uh, good, good.
Yeah, good.
I'm good.
Uh... Good.
We're on! Bonnie's done
with breakfast!
Any minute now.
You hear that?
Any minute now.
Wind 'em if you got 'em.
Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked...
Uh, thanks, Woody.
I got it.
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right,
you're right.
The town is open!
Hi, Mayor!
Banker!
Hi, IceCream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!
Mailman!
And the sheriff!
Okay. Bye, toys!
Yeehaw! Sheriff Jessie!
Giddyup, Bullseye!
They went that way!
Chase them!
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...
Wow.
They're doing "hat shop."
When's the last time
we ever got to play that?
Remember when
she played "house"?
I liked "house."
Those were the days.
It was basic.
You made a house,
you lived in it, done.
Hmm. That's
the third time
you haven't been
picked this week.
I don't know.
I don't keep count.
Oh, you don't have to.
I'll do it for you.
Okay, okay, okay, I get it.
It's been a while.
Oh, looky there.
You got your
first dust bunny.
Aw, how adorable.
What you gonna name it?
Uh, what about Dusty?
Francis!
Harry!
Karen!
Fuzzball!
LeBron?
No, Fluffy.
How about Thumper?
Tumbleweed!
"Tumbleweed." Oh,
that's good. That's good.
He's a cowboy,
so that makes a lot of sense.
So many choices.
I just can't decide!
Bonnie?
What are you doing?
We gotta go.
You don't wanna be late
for kindergarten
orientation, do you?
But I don't wanna go.
We talked about this.
We're gonna meet
your teachers,
see your classroom...
Can I bring a toy?
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.
Freeze! Nobody move!
Bonnie always
forgets something.
She'll be back any second.
That goes for you, too, Hamm.
But it's money!
You all right, Woody?
I'm sure she'll pick you
next time.
Oh, come on, I'm fine.
No problem.
Hey, Woody. Here.
Oh, thanks, Jessie.
We're here for you,
buddy.
I don't want to play
the baker.
Pricklepants.
The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.
Excuse me, Dolly?
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?
Go back to the closet.
I'm worried
about Bonnie.
A toy should go with her
to orientation.
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.
It can be too much
for a kid.
Having a buddy with them
to get through it
can really help things.
Uhhuh. I'm sorry, Woody,
but Bonnie's not Andy.
No, no, no, of course,
I get that.
But if you would just...
Places, everyone!
Bonnie?
What are you doing
back there?
Come on, we have to go.
That's my big girl.
Come on.
We gotta hurry, okay?
Don't forget your backpack.
You're gonna
have so much fun.
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?
Woody?
Here we are.
Bonnie, honey,
it'll be okay.
Hi! Are you Bonnie?
My name is Miss Wendy.
I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher.
We have a special place where
you can put your backpack.
You want to see?
Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you.
Okay, class,
let's all find
a seat at a table...
so we can
start craft time.
On the first day of school,
you'll need a place
to put your pencils.
So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders.
Now, everyone take a cup...
and we'll use
the art supplies
to decorate them.
Hi.
Bonnie.
That is so clever.
"Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.
I'm Miss Wendy.
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!
His name is Forky!
Wow!
That is so cool!
I finished kindergarten!
Uh...
No.
That was just orientation.
But for being
such a brave girl,
we have a surprise
for you.
What is it?
Since school doesn't start
for another week,
we are going on a road trip!
Can I bring Forky?
'Course you can!
Yay!
And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie.
We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?
I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork.
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!
Ow.
He did go
to kindergarten!
I knew it.
No, no, no, guys, listen...
You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?
No, of course not!
You could have been
confiscated.
What does that mean?
Taken away.
No!
Or worse.
You could've been lost!
No, no, no, guys, listen.
Bonnie had a great day
in class...
and we're going
on a road trip.
Road trip?
Vacation!
Yeehaw!
But then something
really weird happened.
Bonnie made
a friend in class.
What a kid.
Oh, she's already
making friends.
No, no. She literally made
a new friend.
Hey, it's okay.
Come on out.
That's it.
Come on, there you go.
Come on, let's get
you out of there.
You got this.
Good. Good.
Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky.
Golly bob howdy!
Look at that!
Look how long
his arms are!
Trash?
No.
No, toys.
They're all toys.
Trash?
No, no, no.
That's the trash.
These are your friends.
Hi!
Trash!
No, no, it's okay.
Trash!
Woody,
I have a question.
Um, well, actually,
not just one,
I have all of them.
I have all the questions.
Uh, why does he want
to go to the trash?
Because he was made
from trash.
Trash!
Look, I know
this is a little strange,
but you gotta trust me
on this.
Trash?
Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now.
Important?
He's a spork.
Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork...
this toy is crucial to Bonnie
getting adjusted
to kindergarten. Oh.
Woody, aren't you being
a little dramatic
about all this?
I know this is new
to everybody...
but you should see how much
this little guy
means to Bonnie.
When she started
playing with him...
she had the biggest smile
on her face.
I wish you could have seen it.
Bonnie was really upset...
and I swear,
once she made Forky...
it was
a complete transformation.
Uh, Woody?
Just a second, Jessie.
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.
Something happened to him.
Oh, Chutes and Ladders!
Ah, trash.
No, no, no!
No! No!
You're a toy now, Forky!
Come on!
Stop! Stop it!
Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
Trash!
Trash! Trash!
Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him
till he's used
to the room.
Hmm.
Forky?
Where are you, Forky?
There you are!
I thought I'd lost you, silly.
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.
She loves you
and you need to...
Ooh.
Forky?
Bonnie!
Let's go!
Rise and shine!
Who wants to go
on a road trip?
Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup...
and Forky, and...
Forky? Where are you?
He's gotta be
here somewhere.
Forky?
Forky!
Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!
Let's go, Forky!
Whoa. He's quite
a handful, Woody.
You need help with him
on the road trip?
No. No, no. I got it,
I got it.
We'll just be stuck
in an RV.
He can't get far.
I got this.
I got it.
I can't let you 
I can't let you 
I can't let you 
throw yourself away
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
I can't let you 
throw yourself away
Don't you want to see 
the sun come up each morning?
No, no!
Don't you want to see 
the sun go down each day?
Don't you want to see that 
little girl that loves you so?
Her heart would break 
Oh, yeah!
If you should go 
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
I can't let you 
throw yourself away
No, no, no!
No! No! No!
So it seems to me like 
you're never gonna
behave yourself
Since I'm not gonna 
do this every day
Come tomorrow, you're gonna 
have to save yourself
Got nothing more to say 
You're not listening anyway 
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
Trash, here I come!
I can't let you 
throw yourself away
Come on.
I can't let you 
I can't let you 
I can't let you 
throw yourself away
I don't wanna be a toy!
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
I can't let you 

I can't let you 
I can't let you 
throw yourself away ?
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Buzz.
You doing okay?
I don't know, Buzz.
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...
but I don't remember it
being this hard.
Want me to take
the next watch?
I'll keep an eye
on Forky.
No, no.
I need to do this.
That little voice
inside me
would never
leave me alone
if I gave up.
Huh.
Who do you think it is?
Who?
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?
Uh...
Me.
You know,
my conscience?
That part of you
that tells you things?
What you're
really thinking?
Fascinating.
So, your inner voice
advises you.
What?
It's a secret 
mission in uncharted space.
Let's go. 
Where's Forky?
Oh, no!
Forky!
Forky!
I am not a toy!
I'm a spork.
Be quiet!
I was made
for soup, salad...
maybe chili,
and then the trash.
I'm litter!
Freedom!
Hamm, how far
to our next stop?
5.32 miles, give or take.
I can make that.
I'll meet you
at the RV park.
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!
Forky!
Forky, where are you?
Forky!
Forky, where are you?
Carry me?
No.
Why do I have
to be a toy?
Because you have
Bonnie's name
written on the bottom
of your sticks.
Why do I have
Bonnie's name
written on the bottom
of my sticks?
Because she...
Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?
Ugh. Yes.
And who does she sleep
with every night?
The big white
fluffy thing?
No, not her pillow.
You.
All right, Forky.
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.
You're Bonnie's toy.
You are going to help
create happy memories...
that will last
for the rest of her life.
Huh? What?
Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie.
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.
Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy.
Maybe you don't like
being one,
but you are one
nonetheless.
Which means
you are going
to be there for Andy
when he...
Who's Andy?
I mean, Bonnie.
You have to be there
for Bonnie.
That is your job.
Well, what's your job?
Well, right now,
it's to make sure
you do yours.
Carry me?
No!
Who's Andy?
Andy was my other kid.
You had another kid?
Yeah, yeah.
For a long time.
And it was pretty great.
I was a favorite toy,
actually.
Running the room
was my job.
Keeping all the toys
in place...
So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?
Wow,
that is messed up.
Right!
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?
Thank you!
Seriously, that is the...
Well, then you
watch 'em grow up
and become a full person.
And then they leave.
They go off and do things
you'll never see.
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.
But then somehow
you find yourself,
after all those years...
sitting in a closet
just feeling...
Useless?
Yeah.
Your purpose fulfilled?
Exactly.
Woody, I know
what your problem is.
You do?
You're just like me.
Trash!
What is it with
you and trash?
It's warm.
Ew.
It's cozy.
I guess.
And safe!
Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,
"Everything's gonna
be okay."
Forky, that's it.
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.
She does?
Yes!
Wait a sec.
You mean
she thinks I'm warm?
Yep.
And cozy?
Uhhuh.
And sometimes
kinda squishy?
Well, that, too. Yes.
I get it now.
I'm Bonnie's trash.
Yes! Wait, what?
I am Bonnie's trash!
No, no, no, not exactly.
She must be feeling
awful without me.
Woody, we got
to get going,
she needs me!
Yeah... Whoa, whoa.
Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!
Forky, slow down! Forky!
Bonnie, I'm coming!
Forky!
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.
Hurry!
Whoo!
Huh? Woody?
Bo?
Woody?
Aren't we going to Bonnie?
I know, I know.
But my friend
might be in there.
Friend?
Oh, a friend, uh...
Well, a friend is...
Well, a friend is
like you and me.
Trash?
Trash, like... Yes.
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.
But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there.
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.
Bo?
Bo?
Bo?
Bo?
Bo?
Bo?
Bo?
Bo.
Bo, Bo, Bo...
Bo?
Bo?
Can we go back
to Bonnie now?
I don't see your friend.
Yeah, okay.
She's not in here.
Come on, let's go.
Is that Bo?
Uh...
Hey, howdy.
Hey there.
Uh, sorry to
bother you, but...
Why,
you're not a bother at all.
We were just out for
my early morning stroll.
And look...
we met you!
My name is Gabby Gabby.
And this is my
very good friend Benson.
Oh, uh, Woody.
Pleasure to meet you.
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?
This is Forky.
I'm trash.
Our kid made him.
Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids.
Are you two lost?
Lost?
No, no.
But we are looking
for a lost toy.
She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?
Name's Bo Peep?
Bo Peep?
Oh, yes, I know Bo.
You do?
Hop on in.
We'll take you to her.
Oh, you don't have
to do that.
Well, okay.
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.
Wow, what service.
Uh...
Thank you for your help.
I haven't seen Bo
in years.
May I ask,
when were you made?
Me? Uh...
I'm not sure.
Late '50s?
Me, too!
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.
Wouldn't that be something?
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.
Well, I try
to stay active.
And look at that,
you have
a voice box like me.
Benson, show him.
Oh, that's really
not necessary.
I'm Gabby Gabby 
and I love you. 
Wow, you need
to fix that.
My record works just fine.
It's the voice box
that's broken.
Does yours still work?
Hey!
There's a snake in my boot! 
Listen to that!
Let's see it.
I bet it's the same type.
No, thanks,
mine's sewn inside.
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...
Oh.
The store is about to open.
Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us.
Oh, no. We can't stay.
Yes, you can.
We gotta go.
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.
Right inside there.
Returned that lamp
the next day.
You're kidding me!
Mom, can we go
to the park now?
Harmony!
Stop him, please.
What's going on?
Come on! Let's go!
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!
Forky? We got
to get out of...
Woody!
I'd like 
to join your posse, boys.
But first, I'm gonna sing 
a little song.
Grandma, look what I found.
Can I take it to the park?
Sure.
Mom, she has enough toys
from the store.
Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys
the toys anyway.
Thanks, Grandma!
Yeehaw! 
Mom, can we go
to the carnival?
We're going
to the park.
Maybe later, sweetie.
Any sign of Woody?
I don't see him!
Shh!
Maybe we should
have gone with the fork.
The spoon is safer.
Mmm.
Forky?
Where's Forky?
Mom! Dad!
What's wrong, honey?
Are you okay?
I can't find Forky!
He's missing!
Oh, Bonnie,
it'll be all right.
I'm sure
he's here somewhere.
You know,
if you don't find him,
you can make a new one.
No! There's only
one Forky!
Uh...
Let's go look outside.
Maybe he fell on
the ground somewhere.
Oh, poor Bonnie.
We're gonna
find him, okay?
We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me.
Woody was right.
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.
Why isn't Woody back yet?
Do you think
he's lost?
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?
What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
I, uh...
Buzz.
What would Woody do?
Eh, jump out
of a moving vehicle.
What would Woody do?
It's a secret mission 
in uncharted space. Let's go! 
I think I have to go.
Where?
Where you goin'? Why?
Should we all go?
Are we going?
And then what?
No time to explain! 
Attack!
No time to explain!
Oh, no!
Buzz!
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?
Woody and Forky
were last seen
on the highway.
But where is the highway?
The slingshot 
maneuver is all we've got!
Full speed ahead! 
Thanks, inner voice!
Hiya!
The highway.
On my way, Woody!
Rad.
Hey! Step right up!
Put your money down!
Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!
Hey! Hey!
Harmony, honey.
Sunscreen.
Okay.
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.
Okay. Antique store,
antique store...
Oh, that way!
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?
Whoa, whoa.
We got a busload of campers!
Here they come!
Huh?
Playtime, baby!
Oh, baby!
It's a good day
to play, huh?
Am I right?
Huh?
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?
"Do you like riding horses?"
Wanna play
on the swings?
Wait for me!
Bo?
Come on.
Bo!
Oh, I can't
believe it's you!
Bo Peep!
I never thought
I'd see you again!
So, which kid is yours?
Which one is yours?
None.
No one.
Wait, you're a lost toy?
You're a lost toy?
That's awful.
That's great.
Huh?
I mean, awfully great...
that you are lost out here.
Skunk, skunk, skunk!
Watch out!
Huh?
I told you
not to drive so fast.
You almost ran him over.
Oh, hey, guys!
Whoa! Hold on there!
Okay! I missed you, too.
If it isn't Bobby? Gus?
Uh...
Lefty?
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.
Girls.
Girls! Of course!
All right, all right.
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?
Repairs? No, I'm fine.
Hey! Nice find, girls.
Where did you get
all this stuff?
Here and there.
You know, some kids
play rougher than others...
so I try
to be prepared.
How long have you been
out on your own?
Seven fantastic years!
Seven?
You would not believe
the things I've seen.
Uh, no.
Gigs.
Yo!
Come on out.
There's someone
I want you to meet.
Be right down.
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...
Whoa! Who's this?
You remember the rag doll
I told you about?
The cowboy?
Yep!
No way!
Don't stare.
I'm totally staring.
Woody, this is
Giggle McDimples.
Oh, hi, Giggle.
Whoa, you didn't tell me
he was a cop.
Howdy, Sheriff.
Officer Giggle McDimples.
I run Pet Patrol
for MiniOpolis.
Yeah, search and rescue.
Ants, caterpillars,
miniature poodles, spiders.
Hut! Hut! Hut!
Carl! Where you headed?
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...
at the playground
on Main Street.
Rumor has it
they got two pinatas.
That could be
20 to 30 kids.
Nice!
Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!
You guys in?
You bet! Woody,
you are gonna
love this!
Uh, no,
I can't, sir.
Bo, I need to get
back to my kid.
What?
You got a kid?
Yeah.
Way to beat
the odds, soldier.
Meet you at the
playground, Peep.
Combat Carl's got
a pinata party to crash.
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!
So, you're, uh,
with a kid?
It's not Andy, is it?
No, no, no.
He went off to college.
But he gave us to Bonnie.
You have a little girl?
No way!
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.
Her other toy is trapped
in this antique store,
and I have to...
Second Chance Antiques?
We know that store.
That's great.
That is great!
If you know the store,
you could really
help me find him...
No way.
We wasted years there,
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.
Oh, Bo, that's awful.
But I don't have a choice.
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.
No, no...
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.
Aw, no. Sorry, girls.
Molly's not here.
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.
That was a long time ago.
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.
She was the cutest thing...
but so afraid
of the dark.
It was just a phase.
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.
Hearing Molly cry
each night...
it broke every
toy's heart.
And then,
Bo came into the room.
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.
Mom would let her
keep Bo on all night.
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?
And Molly would
fall asleep
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.
Okay! Okay. I get it.
Bo, my kid really
needs this toy.
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.
All right, all right.
Thank you! Oh!
Oh, thank you!
All right.
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.
Ow!
Hey, hey!
Benson, are we finished?
Ow!
Oh, that feels great!
Look at that!
Good as new.
Yeah. Thank you,
uh, Benson.
Uh, so, um, when's Woody
coming back?
Like I said, soon.
He won't forget
about you.
How do you know?
You have your child's name
written on your feet.
Sticks.
That makes you
a very important toy.
That's exactly
what Woody says.
Hmm. Interesting.
Hi, Grandma!
We're back!
She's back.
Who is she?
Harmony.
Wait a second...
she took Woody.
Did she lose him?
No. My Harmony is perfect.
Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time.
Whoohoo!
What is tea time?
Oh, I'll show you.
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.
I've been practicing.
How do I look?
Uh... A little higher.
Stick out
your pinky.
Nice!
Mmm! Delicious!
Harmony, sweetie,
I'm leaving.
Come give me a hug.
Bye, Mom.
I love you.
When my voice box is fixed...
I'll finally get my chance.
Now, about our friend Woody.
I wanna know
everything about him.
Oh, yeah, Woody.
I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not
his first kid?
He had this other kid, Andy.
And you know what?
Psst. Hey, Lightyear.
Hey, up here,
Astroboy.
If you think you can
just show up
and take our
top prize spot...
you're wrong!
Dead wrong!
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...
Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know.
No, I need...
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?
Join the club, pal.
Yeah, join the club!
Come on, help me
get outta here.
I'll help you.
With my foot!
Get him.
Get him.
Bunny, what are you doing?
Hmm?
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.
Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know.
What's not
to understand, hmm?
You gonna make me say it?
What?
With these tiny legs,
I cannot reach
without your help.
Uhhuh. Okay?
This is what
I've been talking about,
Bunny.
You need to work
on paying attention
and your listening skills.
Ha!
How you like that,
cheater? Huh?
Yeah!
Oh, to infinity
and my foot! Boom!
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!
How do I get out of here?
This planet is toxic. 
Closing helmet 
to conserve oxygen.
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!
Ow!
Let go of me!
Get off of me!
Ooh! So, that's what
gravity feel like.
Yeah, that's it.
Hey, where you going?
You better get
over here, spaceman!
Yeah, put us
back up there!
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!
I'm trying!
Come on!
Antique store,
here we come!
Bo, why do you ride
around in a skunk?
Whoa! Skunk!
A skunk!
Oh, I get it. Smart.
Corndogs,
corndogs, corndogs!
Why are you
so bad at driving?
You got six eyes.
Thanks for the landing.
Uh...
Come on, follow me.
I'm fine.
His face!
That's hilarious.
I'm fine. Don't worry.
Happens all the time.
Tape!
Not a bad hiding spot.
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.
We'll fix it later.
This will be more fun.
Let's get you
to that store!
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy,
what's the deal?
There's no deal.
Uhhuh.
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.
Giggle...
Trust me. I've been there.
You know about
me and HeMan.
I'm not proud.
Shh! Here he comes!
Oh, man...
What?
No, not you.
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.
Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance.
Easiest way in is
the roof.
The roof!
Let's go antiquing.
Hold on!
Huh?
Whoa!
How did you end up here?
I thought you were given
to a new family.
Oh, you know
how it goes.
Their little girl grew up
and didn't need me anymore,
so...
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.
Eh, who needs
a kid's room...
when you can have
all of this?
Whatcha looking at,
Sheriff?
What? Oh, uh...
That wasn't...
No, uh, nothing.
I was looking at the store.
Right there.
I was looking
at the antique store.
Giggle, count us down.
Five.
Countdown for what?
Four.
You want to get
to the store,
don't you?
Three. Two. One!
The highway exit
has to be somewhere.
Where is it?
Meteor shower! Look out! 
Woody?
Good work, inner voice.
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?
Bonnie?
Oh, she's great.
Jessie is loving it.
Jessie's still with you?
Oh, yeah, the whole gang's
still together.
Well, I mean,
most of us.
What about Rex?
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...
the Potato Heads...
Buzz?
Yeah, Buzz, too.
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...
Bo Peep?
Buzz!
My old moving buddy!
Buzz?
It's so good to see you!
Woody, it's Bo Peep!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz... 
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! 
Three years!
Three years!
That's how long
we've been
hanging up there
waiting for a kid!
Look, I'm sorry
about that.
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!
Who are these guys?
Lightyear promised us a kid.
You did what?
I did not.
Hey! Wait a minute!
Eat my plush!
All right now,
come on, stop it!
Cut it out now!
Come on, guys,
break it up.
Guys, I have a kid!
You got a kid?
Like a kidkid?
Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.
I'll take you to Bonnie.
We're gettin' a kid?
Yes!
We're gettin' a kid?
We're gonna get a kid 
Kid
We're getting a kid 
All right, let's go.
We gonna get something, oh 
We gonna uh, uh, uh
Where's Forky?
Long story.
Kid, we get a kid 
Kid, kid, kid
We gonna kid ? 
We gonna kid, kid?
He's not anywhere.
Forky's gone.
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry.
Okay. Let's look outside
one more time.
But then we have to
keep driving, okay?
They're about to leave!
Leaving?
They can't do that!
The panic is attacking me!
Hey! Watch it, buddy!
What do we do?
We have to stop them!
How?
We could frame
Dad for a crime
so he goes to jail.
Or go back in time
and warn Woody
about the future.
That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle.
Jessie!
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
We looked everywhere.
But we need
to get going now, okay?
Can we please leave
a note for Forky...
so he knows
where we're going?
He has to go to kindergarten.
Huh?
Are you kidding me?
I can't...
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.
Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words.
How about we go
to the carnival?
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?
What did you do?
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.
Brilliant!
That was genius!
Nice work, Jessie!
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are
on their way back right now.
Whoa!
Forky is in there?
Yeah.
Now, hold on.
I have a question.
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.
No, say Ducky. Ducky.
Bunny. Bunny.
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.
You have to
follow my lead.
We stay together,
we stay quiet.
Are we clear?
Absolutely.
Lead the way.
Are you kidding me?
Move over.
You move over.
Quit pushing me.
Stop.
Shh!
Oh, my maker!
That sheep has
three heads!
No, no, no!
What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul.
Gonna have nightmares.
That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept.
All right,
this isn't so bad.
We just can't be seen
by the dummies.
Not just the dummies.
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.
Where Dragon roams.
We can handle a cat.
No.
Not this one.
Is that how we look
on the inside?
There's so much...
fluff.
So, how do you propose
we get up there?
We could go straight across.
How?
That's quite a jump.
We know the perfect toy
to help.
Oh, Bonnie, check it out.
Look at all this cool stuff.
Bonnie?
We gotta get
Forky now!
Woody, don't...
Stick to the plan.
Follow me.
Roger that.
Woody just sits
in the closet?
With no playtime?
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.
That's awful.
Such pretty hair...
What are you doing?
You need to stick
to the plan.
But it's Bonnie.
She's right...
Can we go
to the carnival, too?
...there.
Come on. Stay quiet.
You better hope
the dummies didn't...
Whoa!
My sheep!
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.
Just tell me how to help.
You really wanna help?
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.
What about the others?
Giggle knows what to do.
Here you go.
That's our objective.
We have to get that key.
It's the only way
inside the cabinet.
You can't be serious.
How are we supposed
to do that?
Okay.
You know what,
leave that to us.
We know exactly
what to do.
Mmmhmm.
Aw.
Where did you
two come from?
The keys!
Give 'em up now!
Where are they?
Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!
Well, we're not doing that.
Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible.
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.
Ooh, what about "Winner,
winner, chicken dinner"?
Yes.
The keys!
Give 'em up now!
Where are they?
Uh... you're kidding.
Really?
Okay, okay.
You just...
All right. Well...
Oh, what about the old
"Plush Rush"?
There you go!
Argh. Where is this going?
Shh! Don't interrupt.
Okay, right?
Uhhuh?
Not gonna happen.
NO.
Okay, do you want
the key or not?
What is
wrong with you?
What is wrong with...?
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.
It's one thing
to say no.
It's another to offer
a reason...
How do we get that key?
You're kidding!
Really?
Woody's back?
Woody's back?
And you're sure
it's Bo Peep
who's with him?
Thank you, Benson.
Make sure the others
are ready.
Woody's back!
I'm coming, Bonnie!
Bonnie.
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.
Prepare?
Have you ever played
hideandseek?
No. But it sounds complicated.
Oh, it's easy.
I'll teach you, okay?
Okay.
The first thing
you do is...
one of us finds
a place to hide...
Scary.
then tries to find them.
What are we doing?
Shh!
Just stand there
and be quiet!
I'll do the talking.
Hi, Tinny!
Aw, nice to
see you, too.
Yeah, he's with me.
My friend?
No, no, no.
He's my accessory.
Hey, guys.
Bo!
Long time no see.
Couldn't take it
out there, huh?
Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half
at the front
of the store.
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.
Bo came back!
Magic 8Ball was right!
Excuse me. Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I thought the store
had no return policy!
Bo, help me out.
I need a battery.
We got to get 
this wagon train amovin'!
Agreed.
Help, help, help.
Cheater.
Have you seen Duke?
He's in the back.
Look who jumped
40 school buses
and landed back
into my life.
Hi, Duke!
Who's the cowboy?
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.
Oh, yeah!
Yes!
Huh?
He's posing.
Duke?
Duke, we need to...
Hold on. One more.
Oh, yeah!
What brings
you back, Peep?
We need your help.
Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep.
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.
What were you doing
getting tangled up
with Gabby Gabby?
You know better.
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...
to wander into the aisle.
That doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't, does it?
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.
That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?
Wow, this toy sounds like
a complete idiot.
He does!
Wait, are you that toy?
So, here's the plan.
We need to
jump over the aisle
to Gabby's cabinet.
And you are the toy to do it.
No.
Duke.
Nope.
Duke? Duke?
Nuhuh. No way!
Duke. Duke!
Pass. Negative.
Duke.
Rejected.
Oh, please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important.
My kid...
You have a kid?
Uh...
Hey, Duke, show us
some more poses,
what do you say?
I had a kid.
Oh, no.
Rejean.
Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas.
It was the happiest Boxing Day 
of my life.
That's Duke Caboom, 
riding the amazing 
Caboom stunt cycle!
Caboom! 
I was ready to finally 
do what I was made to do.
Caboom! 
But when Rejean realized 
I couldn't jump
as far as the toy 
in the commercial...
It's a commercial!
It's not real!
Rejean threw me away!
It's not fair!
Why, Rejean? Why?
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.
That was a long time ago.
Right now,
we need the only toy
who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet.
Crash?
Crash?
Any Duke Caboom toy
can land...
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.
I am?
Yes!
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.
Be the Duke
you are right now...
the one who jumps
and crashes!
Be who I am right now.
Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?
Caboom?
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?
Caboom!
Who's the most
spectacular daredevil
Canada has ever seen?
Duke Caboom!
Can you do the jump?
Yes, I Canada!
Uhhuh.
We've got our ride.
Yes!
Yeehaw! 
Yo, Bo!
Gigs! You made it!
Good work!
How'd you get it?
How do we get that key?
It was hard.
Very difficult.
Barely made it out alive.
Yeah.
So, you're welcome.
Okay. Let's do this.
Let me wrap that up for you.
Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home.
Good. That sale
buys us some time.
Wait for it.
All right, let's go!
So, how long
were you in here?
I don't know.
Couple years.
I didn't wanna sit
on a shelf waiting
for my life to happen.
So, I left.
Wow.
You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could.
Aw, Sheriff.
You're selling
yourself short.
I think you'd make
a great lost toy.
You really don't think
you'll ever be in
a kid's room again, huh?
Nope.
And now with the carnival
traveling through,
it's our chance
to hop a ride...
and leave town.
You're leaving?
Sure am.
You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?
Without a kid?
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.
You'd be surprised.
So, how'd you
end up in this store
in the first place?
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...
and I thought maybe
you were inside...
and so I, uh...
Wow.
Yeah.
Will you look at that?
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.
That's gonna be
quite a jump
for you and Duke.
For me?
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.
I am?
Let's caboom.
It'll be fine,
Duke's the best.
Yeah, at crashing.
And now!
Go!
Whoa!
Huh? Rejean.
It's a commercial. 
It's not real!
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!
No, no, no!
What's new, pussycat?
Forky?
Girls?
Forky, where are you?
You're never
gonna find me.
Forky?
Woody!
How'd you find me?
Bo, I found him!
Hi.
Wait, it's an actual fork?
Bo! Bo! Bo!
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!
What?
Where'd they go?
Okay, we can go now!
No. I need to find my girls.
Hello, Woody.
Hi, Bo.
Where are my sheep?
Yeah!
Look! Woody found me!
Take the bunny!
I'm too cute to die!
Hiya!
Oh, no, no!
Woody!
I just wanna talk.
Yeah, with my voice box!
Pull!
Whoa!
You're my favorite deputy. 
Somebody's poisoned 
the water hole.
I'd like to join your posse. 
Reach for the sky! 
Girls!
Drop it.
No! No! Forky!
We've gotta go!
Wait!
Forky!
Woody!
Bonnie's backpack?
Ahh!
Giggle!
Don't let Woody leave!
Grab on!
Duke, get us out of here!
Oui! 
Here, kitty, kitty!
Wait! We don't have Forky!
Woody!
Forky!
Is everyone okay?
Shh. It's okay.
Shh. It's okay.
Bunny? Bunny?
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
Oh, Bunny!
It's gonna be okay.
Forky's still in there.
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.
You want us
to go back in there?
We barely
got out alive.
Woody, it's better
if we wait.
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.
But I saw Bonnie's...
By my count, there were
only four dummies.
But the backpack...
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.
Woody, look at us!
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?
No. No, no, no.
We are wasting time.
We can do this.
Come on, Pullstring.
It's not worth it.
Yeah, yes,
listen to her!
Nobody wants this!
I do!
Why?
Because!
Why?
Just because!
Why?
Because it's all
I have left to do!
I don't have anything else.
So, the rest of us
don't count?
That's not what I meant.
Bonnie needs Forky.
No. You need Bonnie!
Open your eyes, Woody.
There's plenty of kids
out there.
It can't be just about
the one you're still
clinging to.
It's called loyalty.
Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand.
I'm not the one who's lost.
Let's get out of here.
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.
Come on.
Mmmhmm.
We'll find our own kid.
You're crazy.
Bo!
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.
Woody, you did
all you could.
Time to go home.
No.
Woody.
I don't leave
toys behind, Buzz.
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...
Not now. Not ever.
And he left me behind.
What now, inner voice?
Mission 
accomplished. Return to base.
Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?
We're going home, 
space ranger.
Fall back, this planet... 
Retreat! There's too... 
Go! Time to fly! Exit the... 
Back... Run...
Get out! 
Returning to Star Command.
Okay. Okay.
Thanks a lot, inner voice.
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.
Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?
Sure.
Ahhh!
Hello, Woody.
I knew you'd be back.
You don't know me.
But I do.
You were left
in the closet,
feeling useless...
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.
I'm not leaving
without Forky.
Can we agree
on just one thing?
What?
That being there for a child
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.
Okay.
I was defective
right out of the box.
I can only imagine
what it must have
been like for you.
All that time you
spent with Andy...
riding a bike with him
for the first time...
comforting him
when he skinned his knee...
proudly watching him
grow up.
And then you got
a second chance
with Bonnie...
giving her comfort
when she's scared
at school...
helping her when
she needs it most.
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.
Please.
Be honest with me.
Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?
It was.
All I want is
a chance for just
one of those moments.
I'd give anything
to be loved
the way you have.
Just leave me Forky.
Bonnie needs him.
Of course.
The flat tire is fixed!
Come on, Woody, hurry up.
Where is he?
Buzz!
Buzz!
Where's Woody?
And Forky?
We have a situation.
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.
How do we do that?
Okay, let's
make sure we have everything.
Finally.
It's okay.
Any minute now...
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...
and we'll head back
in there.
Okay.
Looks like we have everything.
You good, Bonnie?
Yup.
Great. Let's get out of here.
Okay, genius,
what do we do now?
Hmm.
Scanning perimeter. 
Laser at full power! 
Buzz, what are you doing?
I'm thinking.
Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?
Yeah, I got it.
Attack! 
Meteor shower! Look out!
It's a secret mission in 
uncharted space! Let's go!
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! 
Bonnie, how do you
turn this off?
Full speed ahead! 
Open the pod bay doors! 
I don't know.
It's just you and me now, 
cadet.
A distress signal is coming 
from that rocket.
Just toss it in the drawer.
To infinity and beyond! 
Uhoh. Uh, your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!
Oh, no, my backpack!
I left my backpack
in the antique store!
You did?
All right,
let's swing by
and get it.
Ugh! I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy.
I mean, who does
he think he is?
Exactly!
He was way out of line.
You did the right thing
leaving him behind.
Hey, Lamb Chops?
Hmm.
Coast is clear.
Oh.
Head to the middle.
When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,
we'll hide right there.
Uh, no way!
Stuff that.
Awesome.
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.
Ready?
No!
And another thing,
Woody asked you for help.
On your mark...
And he
treats you like that?
...get set...
He only cares about himself.
No!
You're wrong.
Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid.
By putting
everyone in danger.
Ugh. That kind of crazy
loyalty just...
You gotta love him for it.
Whoa, say what now?
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?
Fill me in here.
Get in! We're going back.
We just got here.
You heard Bo!
We're going back!
Move your plush!
Let's ride!
You're my favorite... 
Yay!
You are my best friend. 
Let's play all day! 
Oh, Benson!
Did you hear that?
Isn't that lovely?
Time for tea. 
Oh, thank you, Woody.
Thank you!
All my dreams
are coming true
because of you.
Thank you! Thank you!
Uh, you're welcome.
It's time, Benson.
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to
miss our talks.
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.
Thank you,
my little utensil.
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!
He is terrifying.
Hello.
Hi.
Bonnie?
Can I help you
with anything?
Yeah. We called
about the backpack.
Oh, yes.
I couldn't find it.
Feel free to look around.
Quick! Before she finds it!
Look! There's Harmony.
You make me so happy! 
Let's be best friends. 
Oh, this is it!
We're going home, Forky!
Huh?
Forky! Oh!
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!
I'm Gabby Gabby, 
and I love you.
I'm gonna cry.
Oh, what have you
got there?
I found this old doll.
You can take it
home if you want.
Nah.
What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy.
There's my backpack!
Mom, it's over here.
Forky!
Mom, I found him!
Oh, there he is!
Now, please leave him
in there,
so he doesn't get lost again.
But what about Gabby?
Forky, listen to me
very carefully.
This is important.
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merrygoround.
You understand?
Absolutely.
What is a merrygoround?
The spinny ride
with lights and horses.
Oh. You mean a carousel.
Yes!
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.
Got it.
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!
You can have
your voice box back.
I don't need it anymore.
Oh, yes, you do.
Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,
but we have to hurry.
Come on.
No. Harmony
was my chance.
My time's over.
Now, please go away.
You hear that?
A friend
once told me...
"There are plenty of kids
out there."
And one of them
is named Bonnie.
She's waiting for you,
right now.
She just doesn't
know it yet.
What if you're wrong?
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...
you'll never find out,
will you?
He's right.
I learned that
from the best.
Come on, Gabby.
Let's get you to Bonnie.
The carousel?
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.
Woody said
to meet him there.
You gotta be kidding!
How do we do that?
Oh! We could, uh...
We are not
sending Dad to jail.
You're no fun.
Left turn in 0.5 miles. 
Wait a second.
I have an idea.
Skunk!
Skunk!
Too many people.
Gonna need
an alternate route.
Will we make it
to the carousel
in time?
Yes, we Canada!
What? What is it?
Recalculating.
Take a right.
What? A right?
Right turn ahead.
Huh. Does
the GPS sound funny to you?
Honey,
it's fine. Just drive.
Hmm,
I thought it sounded funny.
Another right!
Right.
Take another right.
Huh?
Another right? Really?
Turn right!
Now!
Turn right!
We're headin' back.
There's the carousel!
Do you think
Woody will get there
in time?
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.
No dice. Rejected.
Duke, Duke, you got this.
This is the fastest way
to the carousel.
You made the last jump.
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.
No. He'd never do that.
No, no, no.
He's the toy
that went on
to crash 40 feet
into that target!
Yeah, he is.
I'm Duke Caboom!
Oh, man. I can do this!
Yes, you Canada!
I can do it
with my eyes closed.
Yes, you... What?
Three, two, one. Go!
What? No, wait!
What is he doing?
Oh, no.
This is for you, Rejean.
Caboom.
Yes!
He did it!
All right, our turn!
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.
Yeehaw!
Another right!
Another right?
That's the wrong way.
Are you sure?
Stupid rental.
I'm turning us around.
No!
Huh?
Recalculating.
Turn right.
Must be broken.
No! No!
What is happening?
Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!
I can't! I can't!
Press the brake. Press it!
I'm trying.
Got a visual
on the RV,
heading southbound.
Gabby?
Gabby?
I think she's lost.
Are you sure?
Change of plans.
Pull over. 
I can't! This is a rental!
I don't know
what's happening!
I'm so nervous.
What if she doesn't like me?
Gabby.
I don't know
if I can do this.
Gabby, it's just
like you said.
This is the most
noble thing
a toy can do.
Okay.
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.
Not too far.
That's it.
Perfect.
Winner, winner...
Chicken dinner.
Are you lost, too?
I'm Gabby Gabby. 
Will you be my friend?
I'll help you.
Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?
Oh, honey,
what's wrong?
I can't find
my mom and dad.
It's okay.
I'll help you
find them.
I'm sure they're not far.
She was right next to us.
She was right here!
And I looked
away for one second.
Mommy!
I couldn't find you...
and then I found this doll.
You did?
Her name is Gabby Gabby.
Whoa.
We actually did that.
Oh, yeah. Yes!
That was amazing.
We make a great team, guys.
Pull over now! 
Almost there.
Stop!
Stop!
Are we home?
Huh?
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?
Dad's totally going to jail.
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.
For me?
Have a good night.
What the...?
You've gotta be
kidding me.
Hey.
Um... So long, cowboy.
Happy trails.
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.
I'm glad
I got to see you again.
I... I don't...
Goodbye, Bo.
Buzz, I... I...
She'll be okay.
Bonnie will be okay.
You sure?
Hey. Listen to
your inner voice.
Bo?
Is it really her?
I'll be danged,
it's Bo!
Jessie.
Bo!
Oh!
So long, Forky.
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?
Go, go, go!
Oh, boy.
Oh, my goodness.
The awning.
What is going on?
Does this mean
Woody's a lost toy?
He's not lost.
Not anymore.
To infinity...
And beyond.
Yay!
There goes
another one.
We're never
getting outta here.
Psst. Frog legs.
Up here,
Rainbow Connection.
You Mr. Toads wanna take
a wild ride with a kid?
We can make
that happen.
You can?
Really?
Oh, yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.
Aw.
All right.
Nice job, gang!
Every prize
with a kid.
What's next?
Leave that to us.
We know exactly
what to do.
Mmmhmm.
Plush Rush!
How you like that, huh?
You got plushrushed, son!
Dance!
Dance! Get those knees up!
Let's see those
feet move! Whoo!
Or we can get
more toys to kids.
Yeah, let's do that.
Do you really have
laser eyes?
Yeah.
Whoa.
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.
Jessie's back!
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!
Well, it was...
How was
"Present and Explain"?
Uh, you mean
"Show and Tell"
there, big guy.
You see
any kids eat paste?
Guys, listen!
Bonnie had a great day
in first grade.
She even made
a new friend in class.
Oh, she's already
making friends.
No, no,
she made a new friend.
Come on out, it's okay.
Hi. I'm, uh...
I'm Forky.
Trash?
No, no. Toy.
I am a...
We are all toys.
Unique,
beautiful toys.
I will explain everything.
How am I alive?
I don't know.
I was a lonesome cowboy 
Lonesome as I could be 
You came along 
and changed my life
And fixed 
what was broken in me
I was a lonesome cowboy 
I didn't have a friend 
Now I got friends 
coming out of my ears
I'll never be lonesome again 
You can't be happy 
when you're all by yourself
Go on, tell me I'm wrong 
You're wrong 
When someone takes you 
down from the shelf
And plays with you some 
It's wonderful
Wonderful 
I was a lonesome cowboy 
But not anymore 
I just found out 
What love is about
I've never 
felt this way before
I was a lonesome cowboy 
But not anymore ? 
Caboom!
Yes!
