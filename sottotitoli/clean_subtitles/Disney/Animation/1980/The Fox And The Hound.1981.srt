You poor little fella.
It’s all right.
Big Mama’s here.
You know, you’re gonna
need some caring for.
Now... Now, let’s see, darlin’.
You need...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.
Now I’m thinkin’, though.
Now... Now don’t...
Don’t you move, honey.
Big Mama’s gonna be right back.
Good work, Boomer.
We’ll get him this time.
I think he’s in there.
Am I glad I found you boys.
There’s no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.
Come on.
Let’s go, Boomer. Come on.
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.
Oh, poor little guy.
Don’t you worry now. We’re going
to find someone to look after you.
Hey, I think I got an idea.
OK, Boomer,
now you know what to do.
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.
Who is it?
Well, I was sure
I heard someone knocking.
Oh, dear! My laundry!
Oh, here! Stop it!
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?
Oh, stop!
Well, I wonder what
got into those birds.
Well, bless my soul!
Why, it’s...
It’s a baby fox.
Hello, little fella.
I wonder where its mother is.
Come on, now.
I’m not going to harm you.
Now, now. Oh, isn’t that...?
Oh, my, my. You’re a feisty
little rascal, aren’t you?
There, there, now. Calm down.
No, I just can’t leave you
out here all alone.
Oh, isn’t he darling?
Now, not so fast.
Now, now, not so fast.
Oh, my. You’re such a little toddler.
Say, that’s what
I’m going to call you.
Tod.
You know, Tod,
I’m not going to be
so lonesome anymore.
I got a surprise for you,
Chief, old boy.
Now, now, now, take it easy.
Well, how’s this for a huntin’ dog?
He’s just a little runt now,
but he’ll grow.
You may as well
get used to him, Chief.
He’s for you
to look after from now on.
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.
Abigail, you’re going
to have to be patient with Tod.
He’s one of the family now.
Oh, of course. Now I know.
I declare,
I never will get my chores done.
Oh, mercy!
Tod! Tod, stop it!
Abigail! Abigail!
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!
Easy, easy, Abigail.
Steady, old girl. Steady.
There, there.
Tod, you come here.
I said come here!
Just look what you’ve done.
Now, don’t try to butter me up.
Oh, Tod, I just can’t
stay angry with you.
You little imp.
Now run along and play.
Go on.
And try to stay out of mischief.
Hey, it’s Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.
Is this it, Boomer?
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.
He won’t get away this time.
Hold it, Boomer.
I think I hear somethin’.
That’s him, all right, Dinky.
That’s him, all right.
Get ready, Boomer.
Hey, I can hear him movin’. Listen.
That’s funny. I don’t hear nothin’.
Quiet.
That’s him, Dinky.
That’s him, all right.
Button your beak, will ya?
I’ll check it out.
Would you look at that?
OK, Boomer, he’s right... there.
Yikes! Watch it!
Why, you...
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!
Hiya, fellas.
What ya doin’? Wanna play?
Stay outta this, kid.
This don’t concern you.
Let him have it!
Don’t let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!
Which way did he go?
This way.
There he is!
What happened to ya? Golly!
Oh, shucks!
I think I bent my beak.
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.
What are you talkin’, my fault?
Yeah, yeah.
A worm? For breakfast?
Hey, there, Copper,
what ya sniffin’ at?
Somethin’... I never smelled...
... before, Chief.
Let me see.
Shucks, that’s easy.
The master’s just cookin’ grits
and fatback. You oughta know that.
That’s not what I smell.
I don’t know, Chief.
It’s something else.
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin’ to do
about asniffin’ and asmellin’.
Hey, where you goin’?
I want to find out
what that smell is.
OK, Copper, but the master
ain’t gonna like you wanderin’ off.
I won’t get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.
Can’t tell these young
whippersnappers anything.
What ya smellin’?
I’m on the trail of somethin’.
Trail of what?
I don’t know yet.
Why, it’s... it’s you!
What do you do that for?
We’re supposed to do that
when we find what we’ve been trackin’.
I’m a fox.
My name’s Tod.
What’s your name, kid?
Mine’s Copper. I’m a hound dog.
Gee, I bet you’d be good
playin’ hideandseek.
Wanna try it, Copper?
Can I use my nose?
Sure. OK.
Now go ahead
and close your eyes and count.
One, two, three...
No, Copper! You can’t peek!
Now start again.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...
My, my. Look at that.
A fox and a hound, playin’ together.
”When you’re the best of friends”
”Having so much fun together”
”You’re not even aware”
”you’re such a funny pair”
”You’re the best of friends”
”Life’s a happy game”
”You could clown around forever”
”Neither one of you sees”
”your natural boundaries”
”Life’s one happy game”
Copper!
Gee, I’ve gotta go.
”If only the world”
”wouldn’t get in the way”
”If only people”
”would just let you play”
”They say you’re both being fools”
”You’re breaking all the rules”
”They can’t understand”
”The magic of your wonderland”
”When you’re the best of friends”
Copper!
”Sharing all that you discover”
”When these moments have passed”
”Will that friendship last?”
”Who can say?”
”There’s a way”
”Oh, I hope”
”I hope it never ends”
Come on, Copper!
”‘Cause you’re the best of friends”
Copper, you’re my very best friend.
And you’re mine too, Tod.
And we’ll always
be friends forever, won’t we?
Yeah, forever.
Hey, let’s go swimmin’!
Give me a head start
and I can beat ya!
Dagnabit! That Copper pup’s gone
and strayed off again.
Come on, Chief.
If that little rascal’s
gonna make me a good huntin’ dog,
he’s gotta learn to mind.
Copper! Get over here!
Copper!
I gotta go home.
Do ya have to?
We’re havin’ too much fun.
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.
I’ll see ya tomorrow!
And don’t forget!
I won’t!
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?
Why didn’t you...?
Golly! You’re all tied up.
Yeah, and it’s no fun either.
The master says I gotta stay home.
Well, we can play around here then.
Oh, no.
Not with old Chief over there.
Is that him making that awful noise?
He keeps me awake at night.
Oh, don’t go in there!
He can get awful mean!
He’s cranky.
Geewhillikers, is he ever big.
His ears isn’t as big as yours, Copper.
That’s not the part
you gotta worry about.
Wow! Look at those teeth.
That’s the part
you gotta worry about!
I’m gainin’ on him.
He won’t get away now.
He’s wakin’ up!
Get out, Tod!
No. He’s havin’ a dream.
He’s chasin’ somethin’.
When I get him cornered...
It’s... It’s... It’s a big old badger.
Copper, he’s chasin’ a badger.
No, no, it ain’t a badger.
It’s a... It’s a f...
It’s a fox. A fox?
Run, Tod! Run!
Tod!
Amos Slade,
you triggerhappy lunatic!
Give me that gun!
My radiator!
Why, you blasted female.
I’ll... I’ll...
Hold it right there!
Watch it! That thing’s loaded!
Now it ain’t loaded!
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin’ fox
was after my chickens!
Rubbish and poppycock!
I don’t believe it.
He wouldn’t hurt a thing.
You callin’ me a liar,
you muddleheaded female?
I saw it happen!
Amos Slade, that temper of yours
is going to get you
into a lot of trouble.
Temper?
Temper, woman?
You ain’t seen my temper!
If I ever catch that fox
on my property again, I’ll blast him!
And next time, I won’t miss!
Poor little tyke.
It’s a shame I have
to keep him cooped up.
Tod, stop looking at me like that.
It’s not my fault, you know.
You caused a lot
of trouble yesterday.
Oh, now what are they up to?
Why, it looks like Amos
is going on a hunting trip.
A long one, from the looks of it.
Well, good riddance!
Doggone meddlin’ female,
shootin’ up my radiator!
Dad blame it. Get goin’!
There. Well, that’s more like it.
Keep runnin’, old girl.
Well, Copper, me and old Chief
are gonna teach you all about huntin’.
Yes, sir. It’s about time too.
Attaboy.
Yeah, you’re gonna like
trackin’ down those varmints for me.
Get in the back, halfpint.
You gotta earn your right
to sit up front.
Well, boys, we’re gettin’
outta here till next spring.
Tod, honey,
what are you doin’ over here?
Gee, I just wanted
to say goodbye to Copper,
but I’m too late.
Well, what did you plan to do
if you ran into old Chief?
Chief. I can outfox
that dumb old dog anytime.
Tod, now hold it just one minute.
Didn’t you learn anything yesterday?
Now you listen good, Tod,
because it’s either education
or elimination.
Now if you’re so foxy
and old Chief’s so dumb,
then why does that hound
get the fox on the run?
’Cause he’s got the hunter,
and the hunter’s got the gun.
Elimination. Lack of education.
”If you pal around”
”with that Copper hound”
”You’ll wind up hangin’ on the wall”
”Keep your nose to the wind”
”You’ll keep your skin”
”‘Cause you won’t be home”
”when the hunter comes to call”
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper
would never track me down.
Why, old Copper,
he’s my best friend.
Your best friend.
Now, Copper’s gonna
do what he’s been told.
Supposed to chase the little old fox
into the old foxhole,
then along comes the hunter
with a buckshot load.
Elimination.
Lack of education.
You better believe it, Tod.
Yes, sirree!
You mean Copper
is gonna be my enemy?
Hey!
Kid, you better step over here
and take a good look.
Why... Why, that’s awful.
Those poor things.
I’m sorry, Tod.
Honey, Copper’s gonna come back
a trained huntin’ dog.
A real killer.
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.
He won’t ever change.
I hope you’re right, Tod.
And we’ll keep on
being friends forever.
Won’t we, Big Mama?
Darlin’, forever is a long, long time,
and time has a way
of changin’ things.
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.
I’m freezin’ my b...
Hey!
It’s that fuzzy worm! Let’s get him!
Charge!
Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!
I got him! I got him!
Do I look like a worm?
That’s who we’re after.
Come on!
Look at that little creep,
warm and cosy by the fire.
Let me take a look.
Now how do you like that guy?
Snug as a bug,
while we’re out here
freezin’ our beaks off.
Yackin’ and shiverin’
ain’t gettin’ us anywhere.
We’ll get that nogood worm
when we come back.
Oh, shucks.
So long, Big Mama.
Yeah, we’re goin’ south for the winter.
Goodbye, boys.
See ya next spring.
Well, look who’s here.
Oh, my goodness.
I’m sorry, Tod, honey.
I hope...
Hiya, Big Mama.
We’re back. We flew all the way.
Yeah, we did. We did.
Welcome home, boys!
It’s been kind of lonesome
around here without you little rascals.
Hi, fellas!
Hey, who’s that? Who’s that?
This can’t be
that scrawny little squirt
we found by the fence post,
can it? Come on.
I can’t believe my eyes.
Oh, it’s me, all right.
Hey, looky there.
He’s got himself a real fancy collar.
Hey, hey, hey.
Just look at this bushy tail.
Beautiful.
Come on. Cut it out.
You guys are always teasin’ me.
Hey, it’s him, it’s him. Squeeks.
We’ll see ya later, kid.
We gotta take care
of some unfinished business.
I can’t understand.
It was so healthy.
There. That oughta perk it up.
Now, where’d he go?
Where’d he go?
He’s goin’ up the drainpipe!
I’ll head him off.
OK, Boomer, we got him trapped!
Let him have it!
Did you get him?
No, I didn’t.
Neither did l.
Come on! Look!
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!
Holy!
Smoke!
Hey, hey, how’s he do that, Dinky?
How’s he do that?
”I ain’t got no job”
”I’m a huntin’ man”
”And I’d rather have a dog”
”than a dollar”
”So let’s go banjo”
”ringalingadingho”
”Give a little hoot and a holler”
Come on, Chief.
Just ‘cause you’re not sittin’ up front,
that ain’t no reason to be a sorehead.
Shucks, if it weren’t for you,
Copper’d never have turned
into a good huntin’ dog.
Yes, sirree.
Now I got me
the best two dogs there is.
Right, Copper?
Isn’t he somethin’, Chief?
Look, Big Mama! Copper’s back!
Boy, has he grown big.
And look at that big pile of skins
he helped track down.
I know, Big Mama.
He’s a huntin’ dog now.
You’re right. And you’re a fox.
That won’t make any difference.
Copper’s gonna be glad to see me.
Well, honey,
just don’t get your hopes too high.
Look, don’t worry. I’ll be careful.
I’ll go tonight when Chief
and the hunter are asleep.
Boy, it’s great to be back home,
isn’t it, Chief?
Come on, Chief.
You aren’t still sore, are ya?
Hey, hey, come on. Let’s scuffle.
We ain’t scuffled in a long time.
Come on, Chief!
Let’s have some fun!
Oh, lay off, Copper,
you overgrown pup, you.
Oh, let go!
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!
Oh, OK, OK.
That was your trouble on the hunt.
Come on, oldtimer.
You treat me like a pup,
you know that?
Why, I think I done real good
trackin’ down them varmints for ya.
Smellin’ and trackin’ ain’t enough.
You gotta think nasty.
OK, OK, I know.
I know.
Copper.
Hey, Copper.
It’s me, Tod.
I thought that was you, Tod.
I heard ya comin’.
Boy, you’ve really grown.
You have too, Copper.
I saw you comin’ back
with Chief and the hunter.
It’s great to see ya, Tod.
But, you know, you...
You shouldn’t be over here.
You’re gonna get us both
into a lot of trouble.
Hey, look, l...
I just wanted to see ya.
We’re...
We’re still friends, aren’t we?
Tod, those days are over.
I’m a huntin’ dog now.
You’d better get outta here
before old Chief wakes up.
Chief. He doesn’t worry me.
Tod, I’m serious. You’re...
You’re fair game
as far as he’s concerned.
It’s that fox again!
Oh, no! No!
They’re after Tod!
After him, boys! Go get him!
Copper!
Copper! Copper!
Tod, I...
I don’t wanna see you get killed.
Track him down, boy!
I’ll let you go this one time.
Don’t lose him!
There they are!
Old Chief’s got him on the run!
Jump, Chief! Jump!
Chief!
Chief?
Oh, no!
No!
Tod, if it’s
the last thing I do, I’ll...
I’ll get you for this!
Tod!
Tod? Tod!
Oh, Tod!
Thank heaven you’re safe.
Oh, poor Chief.
And it’s all my fault.
I shouldn’t have let Tod go.
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!
There’s trouble!
Tod! Well, what is it?
What on earth?
Widow, get out here!
Why, Amos! What are you...?
Where is he? Where is he?
I know he’s in there.
Now just a minute.
You can’t come bargin’
onto my property, Amos Slade!
That fox of yours
almost killed Chief,
and I’m gonna get him!
You can’t keep him locked up forever!
”We met, it seems”
”Such a short time ago”
”You looked at me”
”Needing me so”
”Yet from your sadness”
”Our happiness grew”
”And I found out I needed you too”
”I remember how we used to play”
”I recall those rainy days”
”The fire’s glow”
”That kept us warm”
”And now I find”
”We’re both alone”
”Goodbye may seem forever”
”Farewell is like the end”
”But in my heart’s the memory”
”And there... you’ll always be”
”Goodbye may seem forever”
”Farewell is like the end”
”But in my heart’s the memory”
”And there you’ll always be”
Hold it, sonny! Back off!
Consarn it! Where...?
Where do you think you’re goin’?
Oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...
You barge in on somebody’s house
like you own it.
Tarryhootin’ around them woods,
wakin’ up folks
in the middle of the night.
I honestly didn’t know
anybody lived here, and I...
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!
Go on! Beat it!
I’ve been watching you, sir.
You can stay with me if you want to.
That’s very nice of you.
Come with me.
She dropped that fox off
at the game preserve.
We’ll get him. We’ll get him.
Well, now, if you
gotta have a busted leg,
this is the way to do it.
Good food, soft pillow,
warm stove.
Sure beats sleepin’ in that barrel.
Well, now, here comes visitors
to see the invalid.
How do you like that?
They didn’t even ask how I’m feelin’.
Chief, get back in there
before I break your other leg.
Copper, Copper, lookit here.
Now, when that fox
comes traipsin’ along,
suspectin’ nothin’...
Tod?
Tod?
Oh, boy. These old wings
ain’t what they used to be.
Big Mama,
you better lose a few pounds.
There he is, there he is.
Tod!
Tod!
Oh, hi, Big Mama.
Oh, it’s you, Vixey.
Hey, what brings you way out here?
I’m lookin’ for a fox named Tod.
He’s new here in the forest.
Oh, new?
Well, what does he look like?
Oh, he’s young. About your age.
And handsome.
Handsome? Oh, say.
Gee, he sure sounds nice.
I’m not doing anything.
I’ll help you find him.
Come on.
He’s gotta be around here somewhere.
Wha...?
What happened? Where am I?
So, it’s you again?
You barged in on me last night,
and now you...
I didn’t mean to.
Just look at the mess you made.
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!
I’m sorry. It was an accident.
Excuses, excuses.
Mr Digger, sir?
It was so too an accident.
You keep out of this,
you walkin’ pincushion.
You shouldn’t be so grumpy to
someone who’s new in the neighbourhood.
A stranger?
Why don’t you go back
where you came from?
Wha...?
Well, go on.
Get goin’. Git!
Gosh, he seems so... I don’t know,
so downhearted, Big Mama.
Well, you can’t blame him, honey.
He was dropped out here and left
all alone without a friend in the world.
Well, maybe there’s
something I could do.
You know, cheer him up.
Honey, you just said
the magic words.
Now...
What? But Big Mama, I don’t...
Darlin’, don’t move.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Mornin’, Tod.
Hello, Big Mama.
Last night was pretty miserable
for you, wasn’t it, honey?
Just terrible.
Cheer up and look around.
The forest is beautiful this morning.
After last night,
nothin’ looks beautiful.
Wow!
Who...? Who is that?
Oh, just another fox.
A lady fox.
Golly!
Is she beautiful!
I wonder what her name is.
Well, why don’t you go ask her?
Yeah. Yeah, guess...
Guess I will.
I’ll... I’ll go up to her and I’ll say,
”You’re the most gorgeous...
The most beautiful...
Never seen anyone, anywhere...”
I’ll say...
Hi.
Hello.
Big Mama told me, you know...
I just happened to be...
May I call you by your first name?
Oh, sure. Why not?
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?
Vixey.
Vixey.
My name is... is... Tod.
Tod?
That’s a... That’s a nice name, Tod.
It looks like that farm boy
is makin’ it big with her.
Now just keep it down.
Well, Tod, you know something?
This stream is just full of trout.
Do you think you could catch one?
One what?
One what? Fish, silly!
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.
My dear young lady...
...you happen to be looking
at an expert... fisher fox.
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don’t overdo it.
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.
Please let him catch a fish.
Here comes a whopper!
Now, watch closely.
Tod, do you need help?
No. No, I do it this way
all... all the... all the time!
I got him.
Oh, that farm boy,
he don’t know nothin’ about fishin’.
He ain’t gonna hook her that way.
Oh, gosh!
Tod, you’re the
funniest thing I ever saw!
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!
You’re like everyone else around here.
I’m sorry. I can’t help it.
You are so funny.
So I can’t fish!
You’re a silly,
emptyheaded... female!
Now just a minute.
I mean, you’ve got a nerve.
Why don’t you grow up?
Tod, that’s no way
to talk to Vixey.
Oh, raspberries! I’ve had it.
Honey, don’t stay mad.
You gotta be natural. That’s the trick.
Can’t you see?
”When you have a natural attraction”
”You deserve a mutual reaction”
”You’re gonna get a whole lot”
”Of satisfaction”
”Here’s all you gotta do”
”When you feel that”
”Natural affection”
”Leads you in the positive direction”
”You gotta stop showin’ off”
”Start showin’ up”
”With little old natural you”
”Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady”
”And now that is a natural fact”
”‘Cause when you be yourself”
”With the lady, yeah”
”You gonna get appreciated”
”Right back”
But Big Mama...
It’s just getting interesting.
Tod, I...
I just know you’re
gonna love the forest.
Listen, come on.
Let me show you around.
Sure.
Come on.
Look. One, two,
three, four, five, six.
Seven.
I think six would be just right.
Six?
Six what?
”No hunting.”
Well, now, we ain’t gonna
do none of that, are we, Copper?
We’re just gonna
get us a nogood fox.
All right, boy, get trackin’.
Smell him out.
What ya got there, Copper?
Good work, boy.
He’ll be comin’ right through here,
headin’ for water.
But he won’t be drinkin’ any.
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.
You know, I’ve never been happier.
Oh, Tod, me too.
That does it.
Amos, you crafty old coot.
The devil himself
couldn’t have done no better.
Tod?
Tod, wait a minute.
What is it, Vixey?
I don’t wanna go in there.
It’s too quiet.
Vixey.
What?
Tod, be careful.
Dad blast it! He’s gettin’ away!
Quick, Vixey!
Go on, head for the burrow.
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.
Tod!
Oh, no, Tod.
Copper! Copper!
We got ‘em now for sure.
This is their only way out.
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.
Tod!
We’re trapped!
Tod, I’m scared.
Quick, Vixey!
This is our only chance!
Whoa! No! I don’t believe it!
Copper, we’ve trapped him now!
Copper!
Tod!
Tod?
Come on, Copper.
Get outta the way.
Well...
...come on, boy.
Let’s go home.
This is it.
We got him for sure now.
Oh, my gosh!
What happened?
Hey, there’s somethin’
very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.
Nah, it couldn’t be.
Could it?
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.
Good luck, honey.
Ouch! You’re killin’ me! Ouch!
Amos Slade, will you hold still?
You’re behaving like a child.
Well, for gosh sakes,
you’re hurtin’ my foot, woman!
Nonsense! Your foot is mendin’ fine.
You’ll soon be yourself.
Oh, land sakes.
I don’t know if I like that.
Be careful! Ouch!
He’s sure makin’ a big fuss
over a little old hurt leg.
”Copper?”
”You’re my very best friend.”
”And you’re mine too, Tod.”
”And we’ll always”
”be friends forever, won’t we?”
”Yeah, forever.”
