 I'll tell you a tale
of the bottomless blue 
 And it's, hey
to the starboard, heaveho 
 Look out, lad
a mermaid be waiting for you 
 In mysterious fathoms below 
Isn't this great? The salty sea air,
the wind blowing in your face.
A perfect day to be at sea.
Oh, yes, delightful.
A fine strong wind
and a following sea.
King Triton must be
in a friendly type mood.
King Triton?
Ruler of the Merpeople, lad.
Thought every good sailor
knew about him.
Merpeople.
Eric, pay no attention
to this nautical nonsense.
But it ain't nonsense. It's the truth.
I'm tellin' ya! Down in the depths
of the ocean they live! Oh!
Aah!
 In mysterious fathoms below 
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!
And presenting the distinguished
court composer,
Horatio Felonious Ignacious
Crustaceous Sebastian!
Whoa!
I'm really looking forward
to this performance, Sebastian.
Your Majesty!
This will be the finest concert
I have ever conducted.
Your daughters,
they will be spectacular!
Yes.
Especially my little Ariel.
Yes, yes.
She has the most beautiful voice. Hmm?
If only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.
 Ah, we are the daughters of Triton 
 Great father who loves us
and named us well 
 Aquata 
 Andrina 
 Arista, Attina 
 Adella, Alana 
 And then there is the
youngest in her musical debut 
 Our seventh little sister
We're presenting her to you 
 To sing a song Sebastian wrote 
 Her voice is like a bell 
 She's our sister Ari... 
Ariel!
Ariel, wait for me.
Flounder, hurry up.
You know I can't swim that fast.
There it is.
Isn't it fantastic?
Yeah, sure. It's great.
Now let's get outta here.
Oh! You're not getting
cold fins now, are you?
Who, me? No way.
It's just... It, uh...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.
And I think I may be
coming down with something.
Yeah, I got this cough.
All right. I'm going inside.
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.
OK.
Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and...
What? Sharks? Ariel!
Ariel, I can't... I mean...
Ariel, help!
Oh, Flounder.
Ariel.
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
I'm not a guppy.
This is great.
I mean, I really love this.
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner...
Ariel!
Oh, are you OK?
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.
Shh!
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
Have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.
What was that?
Did you hear something?
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.
Ariel?
Flounder, will you relax?
Nothing is going to happen.
Shark!
Shark! We're gonna die!
Oh, no!
You big bully!
Flounder, you really are a guppy.
I am not.
 Hmmhmm, fourteen hundred
and ninetytwo 
 Dahdedum
Deedodo 
 Rumdimdim
Deedodeedo 
Scuttle!
Whoa!
Mermaid off the port bow!
Ariel, how you doin', kid?
Whoa, what a swim.
Scuttle, look what we found.
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy...
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.
Oh! Oh! Look at this.
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.
What? What is it?
It's a dinglehopper.
Humans use these little babies...
to straighten their hair out.
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and violee...
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair
that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
What about that one?
Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!
A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
Oh!
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical
times when humans used to sit around
and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.
Allow me.
Music!
It's stuck!
Oh, the concert!
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!
The concert was today?
You could make
a little planter out of it.
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!
Any time, sweetie!
Any time.
Yes, hurry home, Princess.
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's
celebration, now, would we?
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,
when I lived in the palace.
And now look at me.
Wasted away to practically nothing.
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.
Flotsam! Jetsam!
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.
I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.
As a result of your careless behavior...
Careless and reckless behavior!
...the entire celebration was, uh...
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!
But it wasn't her fault...
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...
And... And we... Whoa!
And then we were safe.
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."
Seagull?
What? Oh!
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?
Didn't you?
Nothing happened.
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!
They're not barbarians.
They are dangerous.
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fisheater's hook?
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!
If you would just listen...
Not another word!
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!
Is that clear?
Hmph! Teenagers.
They think they know everything.
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.
Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.
You're right, Sebastian.
Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
How do I get myself
into these situations?
I should be writing symphonies,
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.
Hmm? What is that girl up to?
Huh?
Ariel, are you OK?
If only I could
make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world
that makes such wonderful things
could be bad.
 Look at this stuff, isn't it neat 
 Wouldn't ya think
my collection's complete 
 Wouldn't ya think I'm the girl 
 The girl who has everything 
 Look at this trove, treasures untold 
 How many wonders
can one cavern hold? 
 Lookin' around here you'd think 
 Sure, she's got everything 
 I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty 
 I've got whozits and whatzits galore 
 You want thingamabobs? I got 20 
 But who cares
No big deal 
 I want more 
 I wanna be where the people are 
 I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin' 
 Walkin' around on those... 
What do ya call 'em?
Oh, feet.
 Flippin' your fins
you don't get too far 
 Legs are required
for jumpin', dancin' 
 Strollin' along down a... 
What's that word again?
 Street 
 Up where they walk
Up where they run 
 Up where they stay all day in the sun 
 Wanderin' free
Wish I could be 
 Part of that world 
 What would I give if I could live 
 Out of these waters? 
 What would I pay to spend a day 
 Warm on the sand? 
 Betcha on land they understand 
 Bet they don't reprimand
their daughters 
 Bright young women sick of swimmin' 
 Ready to stand 
 And ready to know
what the people know 
 Ask 'em my questions
and get some answers 
 What's a fire and why does it... 
 What's the word? 
 Burn? 
 When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love 
 Love to explore that shore up above? 
 Out of the sea 
 Wish I could be 
 Part of that 
 World 
Sebastian!
Ariel, what are you...
How could you... What is all this?
It's, uh... It's just my collection.
Oh, I see.
Your collection, hmm.
If your father knew about this place...
You're not gonna tell him, are you?
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.
Come with me, I'll take you home
and get you something warm to drink.
What do you suppose...
Ariel?
Ariel?
Ariel, what are you...
Jumpin' jellyfish!
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!
Max! Here, boy!
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?
Come on, Max.
Good boy. Good boy.
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!
I've never seen a human
this close before.
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.
Not that one.
The one playing the snarfblatt.
Silence, silence.
It is now my honor and privilege
to present our esteemed Prince Eric
with a very special, very expensive,
very large birthday present.
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.
I know.
Happy birthday, Eric.
Uh, gee, Grim... Ha!
It's, uh... It's really somethin'.
Yes, I commissioned it myself.
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.
Come on, Grim. Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't
fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.
The entire kingdom wants to see you
happily settled with the right girl.
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
Perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.
Without a doubt, it'll just...
bam... hit me, like lightning.
Hurricane acomin'!
Stand fast! Secure the riggin'!
Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden
on the move here! Yo!
Ariel!
Look out!
Grim! Hang on!
Max!
Jump, Max!
Come on, boy! Jump! You can do it, Max!
Eric!
Is he... dead?
It's hard to say.
Oh, I... I can't make out a heartbeat.
No, look! He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.
 What would I give
to live where you are? 
 What would I pay
to stay here beside you? 
 What would I do
to see you smiling at me? 
 Where would we walk
Where would we run 
 If we could stay all day in the sun? 
 Just you and me and I could be 
 Part of your world 
Eric? Eric!
You really delight in
these sadistic strains
on my blood pressure, don't you?
A girl... rescued me.
She... She was singing.
She had the most beautiful voice.
Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed
a bit too much seawater.
Off we go. Come along, Max.
We just gonna forget
this whole thing ever happened.
The sea king will never know.
You won't tell him. I won't tell him.
I will stay in one piece.
 I don't know when
I don't know how 
 But I know something's
starting right now 
 Watch and you'll see 
 Some day I'll be 
 Part of your 
 World 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't stand it. It's too easy.
The child is in love with a human.
And not just any human. A prince!
Her daddy will love that.
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl
would make a charming addition
to my little garden.
Ariel dear, time to come out.
You've been in there all morning.
What is with her lately?
Oh. Morning, Daddy.
Well!
Oh, she's got it bad.
What? What has she got?
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.
Ariel? In love?
OK. So far, so good.
I don't think the king knows.
But it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.
He loves me.
Mmm. He loves me not.
He loves me! I knew it!
Ariel, stop talking crazy!
I gotta see him again... tonight.
Scuttle knows where he lives.
Ariel, please!
Will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.
And then we'll go...
Down here is your home!
Ariel, listen to me.
The human world... It's a mess.
Life under the sea is better
than anything they got up there.
 The seaweed is always greener
in somebody else's lake 
 You dream about going up there
 But that is a big mistake 
 Just look at the world around you 
 Right here on the ocean floor 
 Such wonderful things around you 
 What more is you lookin' for? 
 Under the sea
Under the sea 
 Darling, it's better
down where it's wetter 
 Take it from me 
 Up on the shore they work all day 
 Out in the sun they slave away 
 While we devoting full time
to floating under the sea 
 Down here all the fish is happy 
 As off through the waves
they roll, yeah 
 The fish on the land ain't happy 
 They sad 'cause they in the bowl 
 But fish in the bowl is lucky 
 They in for a worser fate 
 One day when the boss get hungry 
 Guess who's gonna be on the plate 
Oh, no!
 Under the sea
Under the sea 
 Nobody beat us, fry us
and eat us in fricassee 
 We what the land folks loves to cook 
 Under the sea we off the hook 
 We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles 
 Under the sea 
 Under the sea 
 Under the sea 
 Under the sea 
 Since life is sweet here
we got it beat here 
 Naturally 
 Naturally 
 Even the sturgeon and the ray 
 They get the urge and start to play 
 We got the spirit,
you got to hear it, under the sea 
 The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp 
 The plaice play the bass
and they soundin' sharp 
 The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub 
 The fluke is the duke of soul 
 The ray, he can play
The ling's on the strings 
 The trout's rocking out
The blackfish, she sings 
 The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at 
 And, oh that blowfish blow 
 Yeah, under the sea 
 Under the sea 
 Under the sea 
 Under the sea 
 When the sardine begin the beguine 
 It's music to me 
 Music it is to me 
 What do they got? A lot of sand 
 We got a hot crustacean band 
 Each little clam here
know how to jam here under the sea 
 Each little slug here
cutting a rug here under the sea 
 Each little snail here
know how to wail here 
 That's why it's hotter
under the water 
 Yeah, we in luck here
down in the muck here 
 Under the sea 
Ariel?
Oh, somebody's got to
nail that girl's fins to the floor.
Sebastian!
Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.
I've got an urgent message
from the sea king.
The sea king?
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.
Oh, he knows!
Hey, let's see now.
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?
Come in, Sebastian.
I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.
Yes?
Yes, Your Majesty?
Sebastian.
I'm concerned about Ariel.
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?
Oh! Uh, peculiar?
You know, mooning about.
Daydreaming, singing to herself.
You haven't noticed, hmm?
Oh, well, I...
Sebastian?
Hmm?
I know you've been
keeping something from me.
Keeping something?
About Ariel?
Ariel?
In love, hmm?
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
They are trouble!
Humans? What about humans?
Humans?
Who said anything about humans?
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?
You'll see. It's a surprise.
Oh, Flounder.
Flounder, you're the best!
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
Why, Eric, run away with you?
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.
But, Dad, I...
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.
He would have died.
One less human to worry about.
You don't even know him.
Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fisheaters
incapable of any feeling...
Daddy, I love him!
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?
He's a human. You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.
And if this is the only way, so be it!
Daddy! No!
No! Please!
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!
Daddy, no!
Ariel, I...
Just go away.
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.
She has a very serious problem.
If only there were
something we could do.
But there is something.
Who... Who are you?
Don't be scared.
We represent someone who can help you.
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.
Just imagine...
You and your prince...
Together forever.
I don't understand.
Ursula has great powers.
The sea witch?
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!
Suit yourself.
It was only a suggestion.
Wait.
Yes?
Poor Ariel.
I didn't mean to tell.
It was an accident.
Ariel? Where are you going?
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?
I'm going to see Ursula.
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But... But, I... Come on!
This way.
Come in. Come in, my child.
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.
One might question
your upbringing.
Now, then, you're here
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?
Well, angelfish,
the solution to your problem is simple.
The only way to get what you want
is to become a human yourself.
Can you do that?
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk,
like yourself,
poor souls with no one else to turn to.
 I admit that in the past
I've been a nasty 
 They weren't kidding when
they called me, well, a witch 
 But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways 
 Repented, seen the light
and made a switch 
True? Yes.
 And I fortunately know a little magic 
 It's a talent that
I always have possessed 
 And here lately, please don't
laugh, I use it on behalf 
 Of the miserable,
lonely and depressed 
Pathetic.
 Poor unfortunate souls 
 In pain, in need 
 This one longing to be thinner 
 That one wants to get the girl 
 And do I help them? Yes, indeed 
 Those poor, unfortunate souls
So sad, so true 
 They come flocking to my cauldron 
 Crying spells, Ursula, please 
 And I help them
Yes, I do 
 Now it's happened once or twice 
 Someone couldn't pay the price 
 And I'm afraid I had to
rake 'em across the coals 
 Yes, I've had the odd complaint 
 But on the whole I've been a saint 
 To those poor unfortunate souls 
Now, here's the deal.
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.
Got that? Three days.
Now, listen, this is important.
Before the sun sets on the third day,
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.
That is, he's got to kiss you.
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,
you'll remain human permanently.
But if he doesn't, you'll turn
back into a mermaid...
and... you belong to me!
No, Ariel!
Have we got a deal?
If I become human,
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?
Oh! And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
But I don't have any...
I'm not asking much.
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
My voice?
You've got it, sweetcakes.
No more talking, singing. Zip!
But without my voice, how can I...
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.
And don't underestimate the
importance of body language!
Ha!
 The men up there
don't like a lot of blabber 
 They think a girl
who gossips is a bore 
 Yes, on land it's much preferred
for ladies not to say a word 
 And, after all, dear
What is idle prattle for? 
Come on!
 They're not all that
impressed with conversation 
 True gentlemen avoid it when they can 
 But they dote and swoon and fawn 
 On a lady who's withdrawn 
 It's she who holds her tongue
who gets her man 
 Come on, you poor unfortunate soul 
 Go ahead, make your choice 
 I'm a very busy woman
and I haven't got all day 
 It won't cost much, just your voice 
 Ya poor, unfortunate soul 
 It's sad, but true 
 If you want to cross a bridge,
my sweet you've got to pay the toll 
 Take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll 
 Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys 
 The boss is on a roll 
 This poor, unfortunate 
 Soul 
 Beluga, sevruga 
 Come, winds of the Caspian Sea 
 Larynxis, glossitis
Et max laryngitis 
 La voce to me 
Now, sing!
Keep singing!
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.
Look at ya. Look at ya.
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.
New seashells?
No new seashells.
I gotta admit I can't
put my foot on it right now.
If I stand here long enough...
She's got legs, you idiot!
She traded her voice to the sea
witch and got legs. Geez, man!
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
She's gotta make the prince fall in love
with her, and he's gotta kiss her.
And she's only got three days!
Just look at her!
On legs! On human legs!
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now
and tell him just like I should
have done the minute...
And don't you shake your head
at me, young lady.
Maybe there's still time.
If we could get that witch
to give you back your voice,
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be...
Just be...
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.
All right, all right.
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.
If you wanna be a human, the first thing
to do is dress like one. Let me see.
Max? What?
Huh? What? Max!
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.
Max!
Max!
Quiet, Max.
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.
Oh, I see.
Are you OK, miss?
I'm sorry if this knucklehead
scared you.
He's harmless really, uh...
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?
We have met. I knew it.
You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.
What's your name?
What's wrong? What is it?
You can't speak? Oh!
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.
What is it? You're hurt?
No, no. You need help?
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.
Gee, you must have
really been through something.
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.
Washed up from a shipwreck.
Oh, the poor thing.
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.
I'll just... I'll just
get this washed for you.
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.
No!
Gertrude says...
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?
Really.
Madam, please...
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.
If Eric's looking for a girl,
I know a couple of highly
available ones right here.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people
in the middle of the ocean
and then flitter off into oblivion...
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?
Uh, you look wonderful.
Come, come, come. You must be
famished. Let me help you, my dear.
There we go. That's better.
Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha.
It's not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.
Oh, my.
Sorry, Grim.
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.
Ah, very amusing.
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?
Oh, you're gonna love it!
Chef's been fixing
his speciality: Stuffed crab.
 Nouvelle cuisine 
 Les ChampsElysées 
 Maurice Chevalier 
 Les poissons, les poissons 
 How I love les poissons 
 Love to chop and to serve little fish 
 First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones 
 Ah, mais oui ça c'est toujours delish 
 Les poissons, les poissons 
 With the cleaver I hack them in two 
 I pull out what's inside
and I serve it up fried 
 'Cause I love little fishes
Don't you? 
 Here's something for
tempting the palate 
 Prepared in the classic technique 
 First you pound the fish flat
with the mallet 
 Then you slash through the skin,
give the belly a slice 
 Then you rub some salt in 
 'Cause that makes it taste nice 
Oh.
Zut alors! I have missed one.
 Sacrebleu! What is this? 
 How on earth could I miss 
 Such a sweet, little succulent crab? 
 Quel dommage! What a loss 
 Here we go, in the sauce 
 Now some flour I think just a dab 
 Now I'll stuff you with bread 
 It don't hurt 'cause you're dead
and you're certainly lucky you are 
 'Cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot 
 Toodleoo, mon poisson, au revoir 
Eh?
Eh?
What is this? Ow!
Yeow! Oh, ow, ow, oh!
I think I'd better go see
what Louis is up to.
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!
Louis!
Ow.
What are you doing?
Well, I was just, uh...
I'm sorry, madame.
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.
Something in the way of a tour.
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.
Do something. Have a life.
Shh!
Get your mind off...
Easy, Grim, easy.
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.
Well, what do ya say?
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.
Come here, boy.
This has got to be, without a doubt,
the single most humiliating
day of my life.
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.
Hmm.
You are hopeless, child. You know that?
Completely hopeless.
Any sign of them?
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.
Yes, sire.
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?
Has he kissed her yet?
Not yet.
Oh!
Oh, Judy!
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?
No, not yet.
Well, they'd better get crackin'!
Move over.
Move your big feathers.
I can't see a thing.
Nothing is happening.
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.
Stand back!
Wa, wa, wa, wawa!
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.
Wa, wa, wawa!
Wa, wa, wa, wawa!
Geez, man. I'm surrounded by amateurs.
Wa, wa, wa, wa!
You want something done
you've got to do it yourself.
First we got to create the mood.
Percussion.
Strings. Winds.
Words.
 There you see her 
 Sitting there across the way 
 She don't got a lot to say 
 But there's something about her 
 And you don't know why
but you're dyin' to try 
 You wanna kiss the girl 
Did you hear something?
 Yes, you want her 
 Look at her
You know you do 
 Possible she want you too 
 There is one way to ask her 
 It don't take a word 
 Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl 
Sing with me now.
 Shalalalalala
My, oh, my 
 Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl 
 Shalalalalala
Ain't that sad? 
 Ain't it a shame? 
 Too bad he gonna miss the girl 
You know, I feel really bad
not knowing your name.
Maybe I could guess. Is it Mildred?
OK, no.
How about Diana? Rachel?
Ariel. Her name is Ariel.
Ariel?
Ariel? Oh.
That's kind of pretty. OK. Ariel.
 Now's your moment 
 Floating in a blue lagoon 
 Boy, you better do it soon 
 No time will be better 
 Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya 
 She don't say a word 
 And she won't say a word
until ya kiss the girl 
 Shalalalalala
Don't be scared 
 You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl 
 Shalalalalala
Don't stop now 
 Don't try to hide it
how you wanna kiss the girl 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Shalalalalala
Float along 
 And listen to the song
Wa, wa, wa, wawa! 
 Song say kiss the girl 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Shalalalalala
Music play 
 Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl 
 Kiss the girl 
 Why don't you 
 Kiss the girl? 
 Go on and kiss the girl 
Go on and...
 Kiss the girl 
Whoa!
Hang on, I've got ya.
Nice work, boys.
That was a close one. Too close.
That was a close one. Too close.
The little tramp!
Ah, she's better than I thought.
Well, at this rate, he'll be
kissing her by sunset for sure.
Well, it's time Ursula took
matters into her own tentacles.
Triton's daughter will be mine!
And then I'll make him writhe.
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook!
Eric? If I may say,
far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood,
one warm and caring
and right before your eyes.
Ariel!
Ariel, wake up! Wake up.
I just heard the news. Congratulations.
Kiddo, we did it!
What is this idiot babbling about?
Right, as if you two didn't know, huh?
The whole town's buzzin' about the
prince gettin' hitched this afternoon!
You know, he's getting married.
You silly sidewalker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.
I'll catch ya later. I wouldn't miss it!
Well, now, Eric.
It appears that I was mistaken.
This mystery maiden of yours
does, in fact, exist.
AAnd she is lovely.
Congratulations, my dear.
We wish to be married
as soon as possible.
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but,
uh, these things do take time, you know.
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric,
uh, as you wish.
 What a lovely
little bride I'll make 
 My dear, I'll look divine 
 Things are working out 
 According to my ultimate design 
 Soon I'll have that little mermaid 
 And the ocean will be mine 
The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna... I gotta...
Ariel!
Ariel!
Ariel, I was flying...
Of course, I was flying. And...
I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror,
and she was singin'
with a stolen set of pipes.
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!
Are you sure about this?
Have I ever been wrong?
I mean, when it's important?
What are we gonna do?
Before the sun
sets on the third day.
Day...
Ariel, grab onto that.
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.
I'll try!
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.
What about me? What about me?
You!
Find a way to stall that wedding!
Stall the wedding. WWhat am I?
What? That's it!
Let's go!
We got an emergency here.
Dearly beloved...
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.
We're almost there.
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa...
to be your lawfully wedded wife
for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
It being... And do you...
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Then by the power...
Get away, you slimy...
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, why, you little...
Huh?
Ariel?
Eric.
You... You can talk?
You're the one.
Eric, get away from her.
It was you all the time.
Eric, I wanted to tell you.
Eric, no!
You're too late!
You're too late!
So long, lover boy.
Ariel!
Poor little princess.
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...
Ursula, stop!
Hmph!
Why, King Triton!
How are you?
Let her go!
Not a chance! She's mine now!
We made a deal.
Daddy, I'm sorry! II...
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!
You see?
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,
even for you.
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing
to make an exchange
for someone even better.
Eric, what are you doing?
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!
Now, do we have a deal?
Ha! It's done then!
No! Oh, no!
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
At last... it's mine.
No.
You!
You monster!
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!
Why, you little fool.
Eric! Eric, look out!
After him!
Come on!
Ow!
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.
Babies! My poor little poopsies.
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.
No, I won't leave you.
You pitiful, insignificant fools!
Look out!
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!
The waves obey my every whim!
Eric!
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!
Eric!
Oh! Oh!
So much for true love!
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty,
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.
You always say that?
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.
And what's that, Your Majesty?
How much I'm going to miss her.
Ahha!
Yes!
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you, Daddy.
 Now we can walk
Now we can run 
 Now we can stay all day in the sun 
 Just you and me 
 And I can be 
 Part of your world
