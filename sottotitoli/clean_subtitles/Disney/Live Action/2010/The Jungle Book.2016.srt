Many strange tales
are told of this jungle.
But none so strange as the
tale of the cub we call Mowgli.
You must be the very
worst wolf I've ever seen.
Yeah, but if the branch
didn't break, I would've made it.
Crossing upwind, breaking from your numbers.
If you can't learn to run with the pack...
One of these days,
you'll be someone's dinner.
How'd we do?
Got Mowgli again!
He's never gonna make the council.
Let's go!
It was higher ground.
Wolves don't hide in trees.
I can't keep up with them, Bagheera.
I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.
It was a dead tree.
How was I supposed
to know it was dead?
It had a fig vine. Any
tree girdled by a creeper...
Is either dead or close to it.
These are things a wolf must know.
Yeah, but if the branch
didn't break, I would've made it.
I realize you weren't
born a wolf, but...
Couldn't you at least act like one?
When I found him,
many years ago...
He was just an infant,
abandoned in the woods.
Get the deer!
If he was going to survive,
I knew he needed a people.
A people to protect him.
It's why I entrusted
him to the wolves.
Akela, was a just and noble leader,
he allowed Mowgli to dwell among them.
All those years.
But, trouble was, wolves
grew so fast and Mowgli, well...
Let's just say he
liked to take his time.
Mowgli, take me up high!
Stop, not now.
It was Raksha who raised him.
She was the only mother he ever knew.
Come on, let's play.
I don't feel like playing, Gray.
Come on, you're my brother.
You have to play with me.
Let's go chase some mice!
How did it go?
Caught me again.
If it's meant
to be, it will be.
Let me hear the law.
This is the law of the jungle.
As old and as true as the sky.
The wolf that keeps it will prosper...
The wolf that breaks it will die.
Like the creeper that
girdles the tree trunk...
The law runneth over and back.
For the strength of
the pack is the wolf...
And the strength of
the wolf is the pack.
Soon, the rains ceased to
fall and the dry season arrived.
Heat crept through the jungle.
Turning it yellow,
then brown, then black.
But that year was the driest
season that anyone can remember.
Even the moab didn't flower.
My leaf.
This is mine, mine, mine.
There's some other...
There's a rock. That's mud.
That's just mud. There's a rock!
That's my rock. That's my rock. Nobody touches my
rock. There's another rock. Two rocks. Three rocks.
Peace rock!
Peace rock!
It's the truce, the water truce!
It's the water truce!
It had been many, many years
since the peace rock was revealed...
And the water truce was called.
Hunting in the riverbank was now forbidden...
Because, by law of the jungle,
drinking comes before eating.
So you could come to the
peace rock, on a day like this...
And find all people. Side by side.
Don't forget.
No hunting.
Playing only.
Playing only. I got it, amma.
And remember, not everyone here has
seen a man cub in the jungle before.
So behave yourself.
Ok, ok. Can I go now?
Take the pups with you.
Wait for me!
Come on Gray!
Take a look at this guy.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
He's walking on two legs.
Don't stare.
Everybody's here.
Is that a peacock?
Ooh, a stick!
No, that's my stick.
Sorry. My bad. It's involuntary.
I could pee on it.
Watch yourself please.
Dad, what is that?
Think that's a man cub.
What's a man cub doing here?
Woah, don't forget the truce.
I know the law, bucks.
What is that?
Weird.
That's weird.
Mowgli.
What was the rule about your tricks?
It's not the wolf way.
No more tricks.
Chin up little one. We'll
make you a fine wolf yet.
What about meAm I gonna be
a fine wolfLook at me howl.
In some packs, the runt gets eaten.
Mowgli, behind me.
Don't leave my side.
Everyone comes to peace rock,
so many smells to catch up on.
I can't help but notice
there's this strange odor today.
What is itThis scent that I'm on.
I almost... almost think
it was some kind of man cub.
Mowgli belongs to my pack, Shere Khan.
MowgliThey've given it a name.
When was it we came to
adopt man into the jungle?
He's just a cub.
Does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do?
Shift your hunting ground for a few
years and everyone forgets how the law works.
Well, let me remind you.
A man cub becomes man.
And man is forbidden!
What do you know about law?
Raksha.
Hunting for pleasure,
killing for power.
You've never known law.
The cub is mine. Mine to me. So go back
to where you came from, you burned beast!
The tiger knows who rules this part of the jungle.
I'm sure he doesn't mean to
come here and make threats.
Especially during a water truce.
Know I'm deeply respectful of
these laws that keep us safe.
So here's my promise.
Nothing lasts forever.
The rains will return and the river
will rise. And when this rock disappears...
That truce will end.
You want to protect him?
Fine. But ask yourselves:
How many lives is a man cub worth?
How many lives?
Who could answer that question?
The rain!
Rain!
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry.
These quills get stuck on everything!
When the rains returned...
there was a question
the council had to face.
They deliberated and they argued.
For many days.
What do you think
they're talking about?
No one had ever come
between the pack before.
But Shere Khan's threat
was not to be ignored.
Mowgli, you're not
supposed to go up there!
Please!
I am leaving.
I don't wanna see anyone get hurt.
Mowgli, go back to the den!
A man cub belongs with man.
We raised him as one of our own.
He'll have the boy either way.
Akela.
Maybe I can be of help.
The boy's right. Maybe it's
time he found another people.
No.
I am the one who brought him to you...
And now I'll return
him to where he belongs.
I won't let you.
He's my cub!
We knew this day would come.
We are the only
family he's ever known.
Raksha, it's the only
place he'll be safe.
It's okay, ammi. I won't go far.
I'll come back and visit.
Never forget this.
You're mine. Mine to me.
No matter where you go
or what they may call you...
You will always be my son.
I wish I could tell you that the
wolves could've fought Shere Khan.
But this is not that kind of a tale.
The turtles like me.
Maybe the crocodiles.
What about the rhinos?
They always let me hang around.
Of course, the
rhinos sleep standing up.
I don't think I'd
be very good at that.
It's either the
turtles or the crocodiles.
Which one do you think is better?
Neither.
What do you mean?
I'm bringing you to the man village.
What?
Bagheera, I don't know man.
You will.
You always said we're not
supposed to go near a man village.
That was different.
Why is it differentYou always
said stay away from the man village...
Because you might fall in a trap or
get eaten or get hurt by flying rocks.
I know what I said.
Elephants.
Bow your head.
Why?
Show them respect.
The elephants created this jungle.
Where they've made furrows
with their tusks, the rivers ran.
Where they blew with
their trunks, the leaves fell.
They made all that belongs. The
mountains. The trees. The birds in the tree.
But they didn't make you.
That is why you must go.
What if I live with the nilgai?
No.
Or the mongoose?
This is not a discussion.
But this is my home. I
don't even know what man's like.
You'll learn.
But I wanna stay in the
jungle. Why do I have to go there?
Because the jungle is no longer safe
for you. You're being hunted by a tiger.
Only man can protect you now.
This isn't fair. You're
not giving me a choice.
There's a lot of stuff you're not
telling me too. Don't think I didn't notice.
You say you're taking
me where I came from...
But you found me in the jungle.
Are you bringing me
back to the jungleNo.
Why are you bringing me to the man
village if you found me in the jungle?
And why does that
tiger hate me so much?
Does he know meSure
seems like he knows me.
Down.
WhatNow we have to
bow to the buffalo too?
Listen to me. This is not a game.
You're gonna run to that ravine.
What are you talking about?
Go to the North where the sky glows
at night. I'll find you on that path.
Bagheera, I'm not taking one more step 
Run, Mowgli!
Run!
Gray, what's wrongWhy
don't you come outside and play?
What is that?
Why did he have to leave?
Gray.
We could have protected him.
We shouldn't have let him go.
I miss him too. What's
important is he's safe now.
Get inside.
I suppose you know why I've come.
The man cub has left the jungle.
I thought I made myself clear,
I wanted him turned over to me.
We no longer harbor him.
He has left the pack.
And where, may I ask, has he gone?
He is with his own kind now.
So the man cub has left the jungle.
That's right.
You and I no longer have a quarrel.
And, most importantly, we have peace.
Well, I guess it's done then.
Unless I can draw him back out!
Akela!
Have I got your attention now?
I didn't want it to be
this way. I made it so simple.
All I asked for was one
thing and you denied me.
Well, that ends
now. Spread the word.
Until I have the man cub,
these hills are my hills.
You did not respond to reason.
So now you will know fear.
Bagheera.
Hey there!
Do you have a language?
You're kinda cute, I guess.
You wanna bite?
Come on. Come here.
Come on. It's all right.
Don't be afraid.
Come on.
Hey, those are mine!
Hey, come back!
Hey, those are mine!
Drop it!
Hello?
Who's out there?
Hi, little cub.
Oh no, don't be scared.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I was just passing through.
I don't want any trouble.
There's no trouble.
Are you alone out here?
That's not good.
We should never be alone.
I'm waiting for a friend.
He should be here soon.
I can stay with you,
until he gets here.
Would that be all right?
I'll keep you safe.
Just you and
me. Sweet thing.
Who are you?
Kaa.
Poor, sweet little cub.
What are you doing
so deep in the jungle?
This is my home.
Don't you know what you are?
I know what you are.
I know where you came from.
You do?
Yesss.
Would you like to see?
Yeah.
Mostly, men stay in their village.
Far from the dark of the jungle.
But sometimes, they travel.
And when they do...
Their caves breathe in the dark.
They call it...
The red flower.
Man's creation.
It brings warmth and light.
And destruction to
all that it touches.
Who is that?
The traveler, protecting his cub.
Shere Khan ended the
man's life that night.
But not before he was burned...
by the red flower's touch.
He ran so fast...
He didn't notice
the cub he left behind.
And that cub... was you.
The panther found you.
Oh, you poor sweet thing.
You want to stay in the jungle?
You can be with me if you
want. I'll keep you close.
Let go of your fear now.
Trussst in me.
Relax, kid. No need
to get worked up, ok?
Where am I?
Uh, This is a
cave. It's my cave.
You don't remember
what happened, do you?
No.
I saved your life.
Yeah, I I snatched you from the jaws of
death. The coils of death, if you will.
And lucky for you,
your new favorite hero...
Old Baloo here, just
happened to be passing by.
Uh, No big deal.
Just tell me this.
Can you...
Climb?
Yeah.
Then let's quit wasting
time and get on with it.
Get on with what?
Payback, kid. Payback.
What do you mean,
paybackPayback for what?
You owe me, kid. You
owe me. You owe me.
Slow down!
And you're gonna pay back.
But...
'Cause that's right. That's the
right You're gonna do the right thing.
That's the right thing to do here. Pay
me back. 'Cause you owe me. You got it?
Ok, here's our little task. You see
that golden stuff drippin' down there?
That's called honey.
All you need to do, little one, for payback
purposes, is to just shimmy on up there...
And get me that thing up there that's
making that funny noise and bring it down here.
You're kidding me, right?
No, not really.
I can get killed going up there.
Kid.
Kid, kid, kid...
Try to understand this. I'm a
bear. It means that I have to eat my...
Weight every day, for hibernation
purposes. I I know I'm asking for a lot...
But I don't climb and you do.
Look, I really need your help.
Winter's coming. You
don't want me to go to sleep...
And never wake up.
A lot of bees up here.
Yeah, some. But don't worry...
These ones don't sting.
Thataboy!
Ow! I'm getting stung!
Ok, I would've done this
myself but I'm afraid of heights.
Oh boy, here we go again.
Why don'tcha mind your own business?
You can do it!
He's just gonna run away.
Not this one.
As soon as the monkeys get
stung, they always run away.
He's not a monkey.
What is he?
A man cub.
A man cub?
Yeah, and could ya keep your voice downI'm
trying to concentrate. Everything going AOK up there?
Ow!
Oh boy. Looks like he got another one.
Buzz off.
It's a man cub.
A man cub?
Yeah, it's a man cub.
It's not a monkey?
No, it's not. It's a man cub.
You have never been a
more endangered species...
Than you are at this moment.
You're doing an amazing job!
I'm getting stung!
Oh boy, here we go again.
It's not a monkey, Fred. It's a man cub.
A man cub?
Yeah, it's a man cub.
Can you believe it?
Are you sure?
Would you please shut up?!
Hey up there, everything
is going fantastically I see.
You got it.
Believe in yourself!
There you go!
Come on, almost!
Yeah, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Uhoh.
Exfoliate me.
You said they didn't
sting. What do you call this?
How the heck did you do that?
Oh, those must have been females!
They looked like males from
down here, females do sting.
Just put some, uh, honey on those.
HoneyReally?
Yeah. You put it on, you lick
it off. You feel much better.
It's nature's ointment.
I put it everywhere.
Thanks. Ok, so we're even now.
Hold on a minute. What's your name
anywayWe were never properly introduced.
Mowgli.
Mowgli.
Mowgli is a terrific name.
I bet you got that one all yourself too.
Mowgli, look, I got a lotta gathering to do these
next couple of weeks on account of the hibernation.
I could really use your help.
You know, if you stuck around...
I can't. I have to go to the man village.
Uh, for what reason, man village?
I don't have a choice. There's a tiger hunting me.
ReallyWhy a tiger?
Because I'm a man cub, alright?
Just leave me alone.
Mowgli, my friend, my buddy, my pal...
Slow down a second, handsome.
Bagheera said I have to go...
To the man village.
Oh, Bagheera. I know him, sure.
You know what his problem isHe
always plays by the rules. And sometimes...
Rules were meant to be, well, not
necessarily broken, but certainly bent.
And definitely
reinterpreted. Don'tcha think?
Well, he told me to
go to the man village...
So that's where I'm gonna go.
Ok, fine. You wanna go to the
man village, have it your way.
In fact, I'll do ya one
better. I'll take you there myself.
Come on, let's go. It's getting late.
Bear necessities. ?
Forget about your worries and your strife. ?
I mean, the bear necessities. ?
What's that?
That's a song about the good life.
What's a song?
You never heard a song beforeEveryone's
got a song. Didn't the wolves ever sing?
I don't know.
Oh, we recited the law of the jungle.
This is the law of the jungle.
As old and as true as the sky.
The wolf that keeps them may prosper.
But the wolf that breaks it will die.
Kid, that's not a
song. That's propaganda.
What's propaganda?
Just a little farther.
That's the man village?
Yep. You can always tell by the red flower.
They do love their red flower.
The red flower doesn't seem so bad.
YeahLet it loose
and it destroys everything...
It touches. Don't ever
play with it, you got that?
Yeah, I got it.
Good.
Do you think that's where I'm from?
Could be.
I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar?
I don't remember it. All I remember...
Is living with the wolves.
Why do you wanna go there?
Bagheera said I need a people.
Oh, again with the listening to Bagheera.
Hey, he's my friend, ok?
Now I don't even know where he is.
Can't believe I'm
leaving the jungle for good.
May I just say one thingWhat I saw you
do today, I've never seen anything like it.
I've been trying to get that honey for years.
But I use my tricks.
What tricks?
You know. Everything that I
built. It's not the wolf way.
Who caresThe wolf way.
That's the Mowgli way.
That's the Baloo way, that's our
way. That's how we get things done.
I can't even imagine what kind of potential you'd
have if you had somebody like me helping you out.
I tell you what. Now you know where the man village
is, you can always go down there whenever you want.
But I would personally appreciate it,
as a personal favor to me personally...
If we just work together. Just us.
Tricks and all.
And I think it would be
interesting to see just how much honey...
We could accumulate before winter.
Whatever I could do to make
your trickiness happen, I will do.
And if if it turns out to not be fun for you, I will walk
you right down to that man village myself. Is that a deal?
Just 'til winter.
Just 'til winter.
Ammi, wake up.
Pups?
They're up there.
But the one you have to
watch out for is the cuckoo bird.
Do you know how the
cuckoo bird survives?
By preying on a mother's weakness.
The cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise it's young. Instead...
It sneaks it's eggs into
the nests of simpler birds.
So when they hatch,
the mother bird is fooled.
She feeds them, nurtures them...
And do you know what
happens to her own chicks?
They starve and die...
From neglect. All
because a mother loved a chick
That wasn't her own.
Come now. Time for sleep.
I think they like me.
Why are you doing this?
He's gone. Isn't
that what you wanted?
I want him dead.
Once he gets word of what
happened here, he'll come back.
And I'll be waiting.
That's the first mark.
Got it. That's the first mark!
That's the first mark!
Got it!
Yeah, I got it! Tell him
to go to the second mark!
Got it!
Go to the second mark!
Got it?
Got it.
Look for the ?
Bear necessities. The
simple bear necessities. ?
Forget about your worries and strife. ?
I mean the ?
Bear necessities. Oh,
mother nature's recipe. ?
That bring the bear necissities of life. ?
Wherever I wander. ?
Wherever I roam. ?
I couldn't be fonder ?
Of my big home. ?
The bees are buzzing in the trees ?
To make some honey just for me. ?
When you look under those rocks and plants ?
And take a glance at them fancy ants. ?
And then maybe try a few. ?
The bear necessities of
life, they'll come to you. ?
Wherever I wander. ?
Wherever I roam. ?
I couldn't be fonder ?
Of my big home. ?
The bees are buzzing in the trees ?

The bear necessities of

They will come to you! ?
Yeah, they'll come to you! ?
Come to you. ?
Baloo, Baloo,
Baloo. Look.
Stay low on my back.
Come on out and show yourself.
Bagheera!
Mowgli.
Oh, I was looking everywhere
for you. I thought you were gone.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I can't believe you found me.
I was so worried about you.
I was lost, and I didn't know what happened.
But then I met Baloo. And then he saved me...
From a giant snake. And
now we're working together!
ReallyThat's a new wrinkle.
I didn't know soft bears worked.
Come on Mowgli, let's be on our way.
Wait!
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be mad, ok?
Why would I be mad?
'Cause you're always mad when I do stuff.
You gotta promise not to be mad this time.
Show me, then I'll decide.
Come on, check it out!
These are vines I use on the cliff. I twirl
them together to make them longer and stronger.
See how strong they are?
You wanna see the really cool part?
It's inside. Come on, let's go!
Come on!
It's the honey stash for winter!
Have you lost your mind?!
You said you wouldn't get mad.
Did you listen to
anything Akela taught you?
There's no place in
the jungle for these...
Tricks. You want to do this,
you do this in the man village.
But I'm helping Baloo
get ready for hibernation.
Bears don't hibernate in the
jungle. What are you teaching him?
Not full hibernation, but I nap. A lot.
Listen to me, you con artist.
He may not know your game,
but I do. He's leaving now.
But I don't wanna leave!
You don't have a choice!
Why don't we all just settle down
for a minuteLook, it's gotten late...
Too late to travel. So why don't
we all just have a little honey?
I don't eat honey.
No problem. I'll eat the honey.
Let's all get a good night's sleep and
we can talk about this in the morning?
Fine.
But we're leaving first thing.
Mowgli.
Where is he?
In the pit.
In the what?
Is this your teaching?
Oh, come on. You know I'd never
teach him to mess around with elephants.
Hey guys.
What'd I tell yaHe's special.
I know he's special. I raised him.
Then don't make him leave,
Bagheera. You gotta let him be what he is.
You don't understand. The boy is in danger.
I know. He told me. He's being hunted...
By a tiger.
Not any tiger. Shere Khan.
Shere Khan's hunting him?
But if you send him back to the man village,
they'll ruin him. They'll make a man out of him.
We should send him back to the wolf pack.
Who's their alpha?
AkelaHe can protect him.
Akela is dead.
What?
Shere Khan killed him.
He will stop at nothing
until he has this boy, nothing.
The only way we can save him
is if he goes to that man village.
Please, Baloo?
You are the only he'll listen to.
Hey kid.
Hey.
That was pretty cool,
what you did back there.
Bagheera didn't think so.
Oh no, I talked to
him. He was very impressed.
He was?
We both were. Yeah.
I I've never seen anyone get
that close to an elephant before.
So, listen kid, I gotta
talk to you about something.
What do you wanna talk about?
Well, you know, I've been thinking.
Now that your friend has shown up, maybe
it's time for you two to just mosey along.
Ya know, now it's winter and...
And it's really time for you to go.
But I wanna stay here with you.
We're buddies, aren't we?
HuhNo. We were never friends. I
certainly never thought of you as my friend.
I mean, you helped me get honey and
I don't really need you anymore but...
Do I have to spell this out?
I don't want you around anymore.
Well, I did it.
And that's about the
hardest thing I've ever done.
I know.
Go away.
Get away from me.
Stop it!
Get away from me!
Mowgli!
Mowgli! Hold on!
Bagheera!
What was thatWhere
are they taking him?
This way.
We see you, we see you!
Come on, jump!
And watch the claws.
Help!
Help!
Uh...
I'll take it from here.
No. I'm I'm coming.
It It's doable if
I don't have to go too high.
Good. Let's get going.
Alright.
A bird, that can't be a good sign.
Baloo, look at me.
Look at nothing but me.
You're doing fine. Just keep your eyes up. High.
Alright. I'm coming, I'm coming.
What part of the jungle you from?
You, man cub. You come from the South or North?
What What part of the the the jungle?
The South, I guess?
Sodom jungle. The Seeonee. Beautiful,
I hear. I I never been there myself.
So, tell me, you ever had a taste of
the pawpaw fruit down there in the Seeonee?
Some people call it, uh,
what's the wordPapaya.
Stolen words. I say pawpaw...
'Cause of the sound it makes
when it tumbles to the jungle floor.
Try it!
Go ahead.
It's good.
You know who I am?
No.
I am the king of the Bandarlog.
Call me Louie.
I did it.
Well done, old chap.
He must be in there.
Follow me.
No, no. We're on level ground here.
I'm in charge and I've got a plan.
And you are a man club who
wants to live in the jungle?
How do you know that?
Kid, I got ears. My ears got
ears. You wanna live here...
You'll need a
people to protect you.
Only I can protect you,
and I will for a price.
I don't have anything to give you.
I think you do.
What?
Look around, man cub.
I got everything. I have plentiful food,
endless treasure, command vast legions.
But there's one thing I don't have
and that's the one thing you can give me.
The red flower.
I don't have that.
You're a man, aren't you?
That's what makes you a man. You can
summon your red flower and control it.
They told me not to go near the red flower.
You know why they tell you that?
Because once you have it, you rise...
To the top of the food chain. Nothing in
this jungle can stand up to the red flower.
Please, I just wanna go.
Now don't try to kid me, man cub. ?
I'll make a deal with you. ?
What I desire is man's red
fire to make my dream come true. ?
Now gimme the secret, man cub. Come on! ?
Clue me what to do. Give me the power
of man's red flower so I can be like you. ?
I wanna be like youoooo. ?
I wanna walk like you,
talk like you toooooo ?
You see, it's trueoooo. Someone like
meeeee can learn to be like someone like youoooo ?>/i>
Now you might think it's
ridiculous that me, a gigantopithecus ?
Would ever dream, I'd like to
team with the likes of you man cub. ?
But together, we'd have powers.
All the jungle's treasure, ours. ?
I got desire. You got the fire.
But the dream I dream takes two. ?
I wanna be like youoooo ?
I wanna use that flame
just the same as you can do. ?
Oh, how magnificus it would be! ?
A gigantopithecus like me could
learn to do like you humans dooooo ?
Just one thing we need
to reach our full potential.
Bring me that red flower.
And when we rule this jungle, I will protect
you and you will want for nothing ever again.
I can't!
You can't or you won't?
I can't!
You will!
Excuse me!
Anybody?
Excuse me. Am I in the right monkey temple?
Oh my gosh, is that King Louie?
This is so exciting.
The legends do you no justice,
sir. You are truly enormous!
In the best way, look at all of that flesh
just squatting there on an ancient throne.
How how how majestic.
Seize him!
Hey, hang on! Can you hang
onCan you just hang on?
I climbed a mountain to see you, and I'm
not a climber, just to be in your presence.
For me, this is a dream come true.
Throw him off the cliff!
Wait, wait, wait. I
have no problem with that.
I don't have any problem with that.
I came up here without an
invitation. Extremely presumptious of me.
Let me interrupt myself. I just
gotta say, you guys are so much...
Handsomer in person than anyone knows.
No one ever gets up close to you.
I guess that's why. Because of the
smell. I mean, the smell is is is rough.
But, it's not just, "Oh, look
at me!" It's, "I got the brains."
You guys got the the
know how. You got the noggin.
You came up with this stuff, with the
thumb. Come on, show me. How do you do that?
I can't do that. Look. I scratch,
I rub. You know, I can grab a fish.
But I was hoping, and you may not be
open to this at all, but I was hoping...
And once again, it's a dream, but I was
hoping that I might become a Bandarlog myself.
Gosh, I wanna be like you. I
am hitching my wagon to your star.
No one leaves!
I can show myself
out, thanks! Goodbye!
We'll try to hold them off.
Where you going man cub?
Stay away from me!
You don't have anyone
now. I'm your only hope.
I can make it real good for
you here. Where else you gonna go?
I'll go back to the pack.
I'll go back to Akela!
AkelaOh, you didn't hear?
Shere Khan killed him.
Must have been on account of you.
No, you're lying!
Don't run away...
From who you are, ya hear me?!
Think about it, man cub.
We can rule this jungle.
Listen to reason.
Gotcha!
Mowgli!
If anything happens to that
kid, I'll never forgive myself.
Bagheera!
Mowgli?
Stay there! We'll come around to you!
Is it true?!
What?
Is Akela dead?!
We were going to tell you.
You knew! You both knew! And
nobody did anything about it!
Kid, just hold on!
Someone's gotta do something!
Mowgli!
There's no trace of him!
Where could he have gone?
Come on!
It's man! He's come to the jungle!
Ammi, what's happenin'?
The red flower.
Everybody, get to the river!
Red flower, red flower, red flower!
Pups, come on! Stay close!
Is that Mowgli?
Shere Khan!
Shere Khan! I'm not afraid of you!
No one has to be afraid of you anymore!
No.
I think they're afraid
of something else now.
The man cub is now a man.
Gray.
Always a proud day
when they come of age.
You can fool them,
but you can't fool me.
I'm the one who saw your future.
I saw what you'd become.
Come now. Use the red flower.
Use it on me like your father did!
Show everyone what you really are!
I am Mowgli of the
Seeonee and this is my home!
That was the stupidest
thing you could have done.
And now, you have nothing. No
claws, no fur, no teeth. And no friends.
This is the law of the jungle.
As old and as true as the sky.
What is this?
The wolf that keeps it may prosper.
But the wolf that breaks it will die.
You fools.
Like the creeper that girdles the
tree trunk, the law runneth over and back.
Fine. Rise up, all of you! You want to
put yourselves between me and the man cub?
And the strength of the wolf is the pack!
I'm going to have you all in my teeth!
No!
Wolves, attack!
Stay here!
But I wanna fight with the wolves!
You can't fight him like
a wolf, you're not a wolf.
Fight him like a man.
Now, go!
We'll hold him off.
It's time we put an end to this.
No!
Dead tree.
It's just you and me now!
Break, break!
You've got nowhere to go, man cub!
Did you think I would let you grow old?
Either I'll devour you
or the red flower will.
It's just a matter of time.
How long did you really
think you'd survive against me?
Longer than your father did?
Longer than Akela?
I'm not afraid of you!
Do you hear me?
I'm done running from you.
You stood your ground, old
boy. You stood your gound.
Ammi, ammi!
My son.
Mowgli!
It's Mowgli!
Will you look at that.
And where they made furrows in the
ground with their tusks, the rivers ran.
In my years, I've seen a lot
in this jungle. But that night...
I saw something I'll never forget.
I saw a little boy, without a people, bring
all the jungle together for the very first time.
Just a few more turns.
Going high!
Stay low.
He never listens.
Gotcha!
Come on Mowgli!
You went through the tree!
You guys!
Too fast! Anybody ever
teach you how to jog?!
You went high when everyone
else stayed on the trail.
But that's what you do.
Maybe, but I'm not a wolf.
Next time, stay together!
Come on guys!
Where the strength of
the pack is the is the...
And the strength of the wolf is the pack.
Mowgli's back!
Hey Mowgli, wait for us!
Hurry up guys.
Hi Gray.
Look well, wolves.
This is the law of the jungle...
As old and as true as the sky.
The wolf that keeps it may prosper...
But the wolf that breaks it will die.
And like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunks
The law runneth over and back.
For the strength of the pack
It is nice up here.
Now he can climb.
Please don't tell me
you're about to head down.
Good.
I could get used to this.
