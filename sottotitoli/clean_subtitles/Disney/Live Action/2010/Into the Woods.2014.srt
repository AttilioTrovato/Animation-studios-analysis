Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom, 
there lay a small village
at the edge of the woods. 
I Wish 
And in this village... 
More than anything 
...lived a young maiden... 
More than life
More than jewels 
...a carefree young lad... 
I Wish 
More than life 
...and a childless baker... 
I Wish 
...With his Wife. 
More than anything
More than the moon 
I Wish 
The King is giving a Festival 
More than life 
I wish
I wish to go to the Festival 
More than riches 
And the Ball 
I wish my cow would give us some milk 
More than anything
I wish we had a child 
Please, pal 
I want a child 
I wish to go to the Festival 
I wish you'd give us
some milk or even cheese 
I Wish 
You wish to go to the Festival? 
The poor girl's parents had died. 
You, Cinderella, the Festival? 
You wish to go to the Festival? 
The Festival? The King's Festival? 
And now
she lived with her stepmother. 
The Festival?
Who had two daughters of her own. 
Look at your nails
Look at your dress 
People would laugh at you
Nevertheless 
She still wants to go to the Festival 
And dance before the Prince 
All three were beautiful of face, 
but vile and black of heart. 
The young lad had no father,
and his mother... 
I Wish 
...well, she was at her wits' end. 
I wish my son were not a fool 
I wish my house was not a mess 
I wish the cow was full of milk 
I wish the walls were full of gold 
I wish a lot of things 
What in heaven's name
are you doing with the cow
inside the house?
I thought if he were nice and warm,
he might produce some milk.
It's a she!
How many times do I
have to tell you that
only "she"s can give milk?
And then, there was a hungry little girl, 
who always wore a red cape. 
Hey!
I Wish 
It's not for me
It's for my granny in the woods 
A loaf of bread
Please 
To bring my poor old
hungry granny In the woods 
Just a loaf of bread
Please 
Cinderella.
If you can pick up these lentils,
and finish your chores in time,
then you may go to the Ball with us.
Come along, ladies.
Yes, Mother.
Good luck.
Come, little birds 
Down from the eaves and the leaves 
Over fields, out of castles and ponds 
No, squeeze, pal 
Quick, little birds
Flick through the ashes 
Pick and peck, but swiftly
Sift through the ashes 
Into the pot 
Bull'seye!
What are you doing?
Stop your pretending!
Now listen to me well, son.
MilkyWhite must be taken to market.
Mother, no!
He's the best cow in the world!
Was. She has been dry for weeks now.
We've no food or money
and no choice but to sell her.
But MilkyWhite's my best friend!
Look at her!
There are bugs on her dugs 
There are flies in her eyes 
There's a lump on her rump
Big enough to be a hump 
But, Mother...
We've no time to sit and dither 
While her withers wither with her 
And no one keeps a cow for a friend 
Sometimes I wonder
what's going on in that head of yours.
Into the woods, it's time to go 
I hate to leave, I have to, though 
Into the woods, it's time and so 
I must begin my journey 
Into the woods and through the trees 
To where I am expected, ma'am 
Into the woods,
to Grandmother's house 
Stop it.
I can't just...
Into the woods,
to Grandmother's house 
Are you certain of your way?
The way is clear
The light is good 
I have no fear
Nor no one should 
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood 
I sort of hate to ask it
But do you have a basket? 
Yes, we do.
I don't suppose
you're planning on buying any of these?
Now, don't stray and be late, all right?
You might save
some of those sweets for Granny.
Oh, my...
Just leave it.
She's a thief!
Into the woods and down the dell 
The path is straight, I know it well 
Into the woods, and who can tell 
What's waiting on the journey 
Into the woods to bring some bread 
To Granny who is sick in bed 
Never can tell what lies ahead 
For all that I know, she's already dead 
But into the woods
Into the woods 
Into the woods,
to Grandmother's house 
And home before dark 
Cinderella!
Get up here!
Fly, birds
Back to the sky 
We're waiting!
Back to the eaves and the leaves 
And the fields and the... 
Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella 
Are you really wearing that? 
Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella 
Can't you hide it with a hat? 
You look beautiful 
I know. 
She means me.
No, she didn't.
Mother said be good
Father said be nice 
That was always their advice 
So be nice, Cinderella
Good Cinderella 
Nice good, good nice
Tighter! 
What's the good of being good 
If everyone is blind 
Always leaving you behind
Never mind, Cinderella 
Kind Cinderella
Nice, good, nice, kind, good, nice 
Not that tight! Clod!
Who might that be?
We've sold our last loaf of bread!
It's the Witch from next door.
We have no bread.
I don't want your bread.
Then what is it you wish?
It's not what I wish. It's what you wish.
Nothing cooking in that
belly now, is there?
And there will never be.
Unless
you do exactly as I say.
In three days' time,
a Blue Moon will appear.
Only then can the curse be undone.
What curse?
The one I placed on this house.
What are you talking about?
In the past,
when you were no more than a babe,
your father brought
his young wife and you to this cottage.
They were a lovely couple.
But not lovely neighbors.
You see, your mother was with child,
and she developed an unusual appetite.
She admired my beautiful garden,
and she told your father
that what she wanted
more than anything in the world...
Was greens, greens
Nothing but greens 
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery 
Asparagus and watercress
And fiddleferns and lettuce 
He said, "All right"
But it wasn't, quite 
'Cause I caught him
in the autumn In my garden one night 
He was robbing me
Raping me 
Rooting through my rutabaga
Raiding my arugula 
And ripping up the rampion
My champion, my favorite 
I should've laid a spell
on him right there.
I could've turned him into stone.
Or a dog.
Or a chair.
But I let him
have the rampion I'd lots to spare 
In return, however
I said, "Fair is fair 
"You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear 
"And we'll call it square" 
I had a brother?
No.
But you had a sister.
Where is she?
She's mine now,
and you'll never find her.
A small price to pay
for what else your father stole from me.
It cost me my youth, my beauty.
My mother warned me
she would punish me with the curse of
ugliness if I ever lost any of them.
Lost what?
The beans 
Beans'?
The special beans 
I let him go
I didn't know he'd stolen my beans 
I was watching him crawl
Back over the wall 
When bang, crash
A lightning flash 
Well, that's another story
Never mind, anyway 
At last, the big day came
I made my claim 
"Oh, don't take away the baby"
They shrieked and squeaked 
But I did, and I hid her
Where she'll never be reached 
Your father cried
And your mother died 
When for extra measure
I admit, it was a pleasure 
I said, "Sorry, I'm still not mollified" 
And I laid a little spell on them 
You, too, son.
That your family tree would always be
a barren one.
How could you do that?
And when your mother died,
your father deserted you.
Your father was no father,
so why should you be?
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Now there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes 
And my garden thrives
You should see my nectarines 
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens 
Don't ever, never, ever
Mess around with my greens 
Especially the beans 
Yeah, but why
do we have to go to the next village?
Because everyone in this village knows
the cow hasn't given
a drop of milk in weeks.
But that's cheating.
We're starving, Jack!
Don't you understand that?
Now, you're not to
accept less than five pounds for her.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
How much are you to ask?
No more than five pounds.
Less than five!
Than five!
Into the woods, the time is now 
We have to live, I don't care how 
Into the woods to sell the cow 
You must begin the journey 
Straight through the woods,
and don't delay 
We have to face the marketplace 
Into the woods to journey's end 
Into the woods to sell a friend 
You wish to have the curse reversed?
I'll need a certain potion first.
Go to the wood and bring me back...
One, the cow as white as milk.
Two, the cape as red as blood.
Three, the hair as yellow as corn.
Four, the slipper as pure as gold.
Bring me these
before the chime of midnight
in three days' time.
'Tis then the Blue Moon reappears,
which comes but once
each hundred years.
Bring them and I guarantee
a child as perfect as child can be.
Go to the wood!
Ladies, our carriage awaits!
Now may I go to the Festival? 
The Festival? 
Darling, those nails
Darling, those clothes 
The lentils are one thing
But darling, with those 
You'd make us the fools of the Festival 
And mortify the Prince 
The Festival lasts three nights.
Surely, you can let me
be there for one of them.
The King is trying to
find his son a wife, not a scullery maid!
We must be gone!
Stop it!
Come on.
Go!
I Wish... 
Look what I found. Here, take this.
I'm not wearing that.
Why?
It was my father's.
You heard what she said.
This is all his fault.
I want nothing to do with him.
Beans?
Oh, these must be the Witch's beans.
We'll take them with us.
We?
Yes.
We? You're not coming.
It's not safe out there.
I can help you!
No, I can do this on my own.
The spell is on my house
Only I can lift the spell 
No, no, the spell is on our house 
We must lift the spell together 
The spell is on our house 
Now, remind me,
what am I to return with?
You don't remember?
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood 
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold 
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood 
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold 
I still wish to go to the Festival 
But how am I ever to
get to the Festival? 
I know, I'll visit Mother's grave 
The grave at the willow tree 
And tell her I just want to go
To the King's Festival 
Into the woods, it's time to go 
It may be all in vain, you know 
Into the woods, but even so
I have to take the journey 
Into the woods, the path is straight
You know it well 
But who can tell? 
Into the woods to lift the spell 
Into the woods to visit Mother 
Into the woods to sell the cow 
To get the money 
To go to the Festival 
Into the woods,
to Grandmother's house 
Into the woods,
to Grandmother's house 
The way is clear 
The light is good 
I have no fear
Nor no one should 
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood 
No need to be afraid there
There's something in the glade there 
Into the woods without delay 
But careful not to lose the way 
Into the woods, who knows what may 
Be lurking on the journey 
Into the woods to get the thing 
That makes it worth the journeying 
Into the woods to see the King 
To sell the cow
To make the potion 
To see, to sell
To get, to bring 
To make, to lift
To go to the Festival 
Into the woods 
To see, to sell, to get, to bring 
Into the woods
To make, to lift, to go to the Festival 
Into the woods
Into the woods 
Into the woods
Then out of the woods 
To see, to sell
To get, to bring 
To make, to lift
To go to the Festival 
Into the woods
Then out of the woods 
And home before dark 
Deep within the woods 
Cinderella had planted
a branch at the grave of her mother. 
And she visited
there so often, and wept so much 
that her tears watered it 
until it had become a magnificent tree. 
I Wish...
What is it that you wish, child? 
Do you know what you wish? 
Are you certain what you wish
ls what you want? 
If you know what you want 
Then make a wish 
Ask the tree 
And you shall have your wish 
Thank you, Mother.
On her path to Granny's, 
the little girl suddenly found herself 
in a very unusual part of the wood. 
Good day, young lady.
Good day, Mr. Wolf.
Whither away so hurriedly?
To my grandmother's.
And what might be in your basket?
Some bread. For Grandmother.
So she'll have something
good to make her strong.
And where might
your grandmother live?
A good quarter of a league
further in the woods.
Her house stands
inside a great oak tree.
Look at that flesh
Pink and plump 
Hello, little girl 
Tender and fresh
Not one lump 
Hello, little girl 
This one's especially lush 
Delicious 
Hello, little girl
What's your rush? 
You're missing all the flowers 
The sun won't set for hours 
Take your time 
Mother said, "Straight ahead"
Not to delay or be misled 
But slow, little girl
Hark and hush 
The birds are singing sweetly 
You'll miss the birds completely 
You're traveling so fleetly 
Grandmother first
Then Miss Plump 
What a delectable couple 
Utter perfection
One brittle, one supple 
One moment, my dear
Mother said, "Come what may 
"Follow the path and never stray" 
Just so, little girl
Any path 
So many worth exploring 
Just one would be so boring 
And look what you're ignoring 
Think of those crisp, aging bones 
Then something fresh on the palate 
Think of that scrumptious carnality 
Twice in one day 
There's no possible way 
To describe what you feel 
When you're talking to your meal 
For Granny.
Mother said not to stray 
Still, I suppose, a small delay 
Granny might like a fresh bouquet 
Goodbye, Mr. Wolf 
Goodbye, little girl 
And hello 
What are you waiting for? Get the cape!
You frightened me!
Get it, get it, get it, get it!
How am I supposed to get it?
You go up to the little thing,
and you take it!
I can't just take a cloak from a little girl.
Why don't you take it?
It's the rules.
Why do you think
I asked you to do it in the first place?
I'm not allowed to touch
any of the objects.
Get me what I need!
Get me what I need!
Hello there, little girl.
Hello, Mr. Baker.
Have you saved some
of those sweets for Granny?
I ate all the sweets
and half a loaf of bread.
So I see.
Now, tell me, where did you
get that beautiful cape?
My granny made it for me.
Is that so?
I would love a red cape like that.
You would look pretty foolish.
I would, wouldn't I?
May I take a look at it?
No!
No, I need it badly.
It's mine! Give it back!
Give it back!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure
that you really loved that cape.
Now off you go to Granny's,
and be careful that
no wolf comes your way.
I'd rather a wolf than you any day!
This is hopeless!
I'm never gonna find that red cape,
or a yellow slipper and a golden cow.
Oh, wait, is it a golden slipper
and a yellow cow?
The cow as white as milk 
The cape as red as blood 
The hair as yellow as corn 
The slipper as pure as...
What are you doing here?
You forgot your scarf.
You shouldn't be here.
It's not safe in these woods.
I want to help.
No!
The spell is on my house
Our house 
Only I can lift the spell 
We must lift the spell together
The spell is on my house 
The spell is on...
A cow as white as...
Milk.
Go.
Hello there, young lad.
Hello, sir.
What might you be doing
with a cow in the middle of the forest?
I was heading towards market,
but I seem to have lost my way.
"What are you planning
on doing there?"
What are you planning on doing there?
Sell my cow, sir.
No less than five pounds.
Five pounds?
Where are we supposed
to get five pounds?
She must be very generous
of milk to fetch five pounds.
Yes, ma'am.
And if you can't fetch that sum,
then what are you to do?
I hadn't thought of that.
This is all we have.
Beans?
Oh, no, we mustn't give up our beans!
Well, if you feel that we must.
Beans in exchange for my cow?
Oh, no, son.
These are no ordinary beans.
These beans, they carry magic.
Magic? What kind of magic?
Tell him.
It's...
it's a magic that defies description.
Yes.
How many beans?
Six.
Five.
Five.
They're worth a pound each, at least.
Could I buy my cow back someday?
Well... Possibly.
Yes.
So, yeah,
it seems like we've made a fair trade.
Okay.
Here you go. There's one, two,
three, four, five.
All right, well, good luck,
and pleasure doing business with you.
One day, I'll buy you back.
Promise.
Take the cow and go home.
I was just trying to help.
Magic beans?
We've no reason
to believe they're magic.
Are we to dispel this
curse through deceit?
No one would have given him
more for this creature.
We did him a favor.
At least they'll have some food now.
Five beans?
Do you want a child or not?
Of course I do.
We have one chance.
Don't you see that? And if we fail...
I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a father.
Why would you say that?
Because of my father.
You're not him!
I don't know.
If you can't do this for yourself,
can't you at least do it for me?
Okay. Fine. But will you
take the cow and go home?
I will find the rest of the things
on my own.
'
Rapunzel!
Rapunzel!
Let down your hair to me!
Rapunzel?
The old enchantress
had given the name Rapunzel 
to the child she had hidden away and
locked in a doorless tower. 
But little did She know 
that the girl's lilting voice
had caught the attention 
of a handsome prince. 
Rapunzel.
Don't you look lovely today, my dear.
Thank you, Mother.
I brought your favorite.
Blackberries.
Fresh from the garden.
As the little girl
approached her granny's oak tree, 
she was surprised to see
the door standing open. 
Oh, dear.
How uneasy I feel.
Perhaps it's all the sweets.
Granny?
Come in, my dearie.
My, Grandmother.
You're looking very strange.
What big ears you have.
The better to hear you with,
my dear.
And with a single bound 
the big, bad Wolf
had devoured the little girl. 
Well, it was a full day of eating for both. 
Help! Get us out!
I can't believe I just did that.
Wait!
Aren't you gonna help us
skin that beast?
No, no. No thanks.
What kind of hunter are you?
I'm a baker.
Wait a minute, I never thanked you!
You need to be more
careful, young lady.
I'm sorry.
I should have known better.
Mother said, "Straight ahead"
Not to delay or be misled 
I should have heeded her advice 
But he seemed so nice 
And he showed me things
Many beautiful things 
That I hadn't thought to explore 
They were off my path
So I never had dared 
I had been so careful 
I never had cared 
And he made me feel excited
Well, excited and scared 
When he said, "Come in"
With that sickening grin 
How could I know what was in store? 
Once his teeth were bared,
though I really got scared 
Well, excited and scared 
But he drew me close 
And he swallowed me down 
Down a dark, slimy path 
Where lie secrets
That I never want to know 
And when everything familiar 
Seemed to disappear forever 
At the end of the path
Was Granny once again 
So we lay in the dark
Till you came and set us free 
And you brought us to the light 
And we're back at the start 
And I know things now
Many valuable things 
That I hadn't known before 
Do not put your faith 
In a cape and a hood 
They will not protect you
The way that they should 
And take extra care with strangers 
Even flowers have their dangers 
And though scary is exciting 
Nice is different than good 
Mr. Baker, you saved our lives.
Here.
Are you certain?
Yes.
Maybe Granny will make me another
one out of the skins of that wolf.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Now I know: don't be scared 
Granny is right, just be prepared 
Isn't it nice to know a lot 
And a little bit 
Not 
How could you do this?
What sort of boy exchanges
a cow for beans?
But they're magic. The man said.
Get your head out of the clouds, Jack!
Mother, no!
Go on, get in there!
You and your worthless
adventures, Jack! Will you never learn?
To bed without supper for you!
Beans!
The first night of the Festival Ball 
brought Cinderella her wish. 
The Prince danced only with her, 
till he turned,
and she had slipped away.
That Way!
Quickly!
I must find that girl.
Are you all right, miss?
Yes.
I just need to catch my breath.
Oh, what a beautiful gown!
Were you at the King's Festival?
Yes.
Aren't you the lucky one.
Why ever are you in
the woods at this hour?
This way!
Please don't let them
know that I'm here.
Oh, my God.
Have you seen a beautiful young
woman in a ball gown pass through?
I don't think so, sir.
If I may, My Lord,
I think I see her over there!
Onward!
I've never lied to royalty before.
I've never anything to royalty before!
Thank you.
If a prince were looking for me,
I certainly wouldn't hide.
What brings you here,
and with a cow?
Well, my husband's
somewhere in the woods.
He's undoing a spell.
Yes.
But tell me, the Prince,
what was he like?
He's a very nice prince 
And? 
And...
It's a very nice ball 
And? 
And...
When I entered, they trumpeted 
And? The Prince? 
Oh, the Prince
Yes, the Prince 
Well, he's tall 
Is that all? 
Did you dance? Is he charming? 
They say that he's charming 
We did nothing but dance 
Yes? 
And?
And it made a nice change 
No, the Prince 
Oh, the Prince
Yes, the Prince 
He has charm for a prince, I guess 
You guess? 
I don't meet a wide range 
And it's all very strange 
But why would you run away?
It's not quite what I expected.
What? Princes and castles and gowns?
I have no experience with those things.
But you will return to
the Festival tomorrow eve?
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
You don't know?
What I wouldn't give
to be in your shoes.
Well, your slippers.
As pure as gold?
I must get home.
No, wait. I need your shoes!
MilkyWhite!
One midnight gone!
Already?
Get the cow!
Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker!
Good fortune! Good fortune, sir!
Look what I have! Five gold pieces!
How would you come by
five gold pieces?
There are giants in the sky 
There are big, tall,
terrible giants in the sky 
When you're way up high
And you look below 
At the world you've left
And the things you know 
Little more than a glance
ls enough to show you 
Just how small you are 
When you're way up high
And you're on your own 
In a world like none
That you've ever known 
Where the sky is lead
And the earth is stone 
You're free to do
Whatever pleases you 
Exploring things you'd never dare 
'Cause you don't care
When suddenly there's 
A big, tall, terrible giant at the door 
A giant?
A big, tall, terrible lady giant 
Sweeping the floor 
And she gives you food
And she gives you rest 
And she draws you close
To her giant breast 
And you know things now 
That you never knew before 
Not till the sky 
Only just when you've made
A friend and all 
And you know she's big
But you don't feel small 
Someone bigger than her
Comes along the hall 
To swallow you for lunch 
And your heart is lead
And your stomach stone 
And you're really scared
Being all alone 
And it's then that you miss
All the things you've known 
And the world you've left
And the little you own 
The fun is done
You steal what you can and run 
And you scramble down
And you look below 
And the world you know
Begins to grow 
The roof, the house
And your mother at the door 
The roof 
The house
And the world you never 
Thought to explore 
And you think of
All of the things you've seen 
And you wish that
You could live in between 
And you're back again 
Only different than before 
After the sky 
There are giants in the sky 
There are big, tall, terrible
Awesome, scary 
Wonderful giants 
In the sky 
There's your money, sir.
Five gold pieces.
Where's my MilkyWhite?
MilkyWhite is at home with my Wife.
Let's go find them.
No, wait.
I'm not sure I want to sell.
But you said I could buy her back.
Do you want more money?
No.
You keep that, I'll fetch some more.
I'll just go back up the beanstalk.
Wait!
Wait! Wait!
Wait!
Wait! Wait!
I said wait!
What are you doing here?
Well...
I see you got the cape!
Yes, I've got the cape.
Only two items left.
Three.
Two. We've the cape and the cow.
You've got the cape!
What have you done with the cow?
She ran away.
What?
I never even reached home.
I've been looking for her all night.
How could you?
Well, she might
just as easily have run away from you.
Yeah, but she didn't.
Yeah, but she might have done.
But she didn't.
But she might have done!
But she didn't!
Who cares?
Cow's gone! Get it back! Get it back!
We were just about to do that,
but here, in the meantime,
we've got this.
Get away from me with that, you fool!
I can't touch it, remember?
Right. No, I forgot.
By midnight tomorrow
bring me the items,
or that child you wish for will
never see the light of day!
I don't like that woman.
I'm sorry I lost the cow.
I shouldn't have yelled.
Will you go back to the village?
I will make things right.
And we can carry on with our lives.
No more witches or dimwitted boys
or hungry little girls.
Will you 90'?
Please.
Go.
Good brother!
I was wondering where you had gone.
I've been searching all night for her.
Her?
The beautiful one
I danced the evening with.
Where did she go?
Disappeared,
like the fine morning mist.
She was lovely?
The loveliest.
I'm not certain of that.
I must confess, I, too,
have found a lovely maiden.
She lives here, in the woods.
In the woods?
Yes!
On top of a tall tower
that has no doors or stairs.
Where?
Two leagues from here, due east,
just beyond the mossy knoll
near the rose thickets.
And how do you manage a visit?
I stand beneath her tower
and I say, "Rapunzel!
Rapunzel, let down your hair to me."
And she lowers the longest,
most beautiful head of hair,
yellow as corn,
which I climb.
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel?
Yeah.
What kind of name is that? You jest!
Never heard of such a thing.
I speak the truth!
She's as true as your maiden.
A maiden running from a prince?
None would run from us.
Yet one has.
Did I abuse her'?
Or show her disdain? 
Why does she run from me? 
If I should lose her
How shall I regain 
The heart she has won from me? 
Agony 
Beyond power of speech 
When the one thing you want 
ls the only thing out of your reach 
High in her tower 
She sits by the hour 
Maintaining her hair 
Blithe and becoming
And frequently humming 
A lighthearted air 
Agony 
Far more painful than yours 
When you know she would go with you 
If there only were doors 
Agony 
Oh, the torture they teach 
What's as intriguing 
Or half so fatiguing 
As what's out of reach? 
Am I not sensitive 
Clever, wellmannered, considerate 
Passionate, charming
As kind as I'm handsome 
And heir to a throne? 
You are everything
maidens could wish for 
Then why no?
Do I know? 
The girl must be mad 
You know nothing of madness 
Till you're climbing her hair
And you see her up there 
As you're nearing her
All the while hearing her 
Agony 
Misery
Woe 
Though it's different for each 
Always ten steps behind 
Always ten feet below 
And she's just out of reach 
Agony 
That can cut like a knife 
I must have her 
To wife 
Rapunzel, Rapunzel.
Let down your hair to me.
Is that you at this hour, my Prince?
Yes.
Excuse me for this.
As the Baker's wife
bolted from the tower, 
the second night of the Festival
was thrown into chaos... 
Stop!
...when Cinderella, once again,
ran from the Prince. 
What are you doing?
So sorry, I need your shoe.
I see her over there!
Who is she? Where did she go?
I have no idea, sir.
Don't play the fool, woman.
No, I was trying to hold her here for you.
I can capture my own damsel,
thank you.
Yes, of course.
There's no sign of her, my liege.
Well, what are you waiting for?
See if you can find her. Go!
The woods can be a dangerous place.
On!
I hope that skinny girl
isn't there tomorrow night.
I mean, who was that girl?
Please, if you would be so kind,
may I compare this ear
of corn to your hair?
You savage!
Mongrel!
He is revolting!
MilkyWhite!
I thought you were returning home!
It's you!
You've got the cow!
Yes, I've got the cow.
We've two of the four.
No, three.
Two.
Three! Compare this to your corn.
Where did you find it?
Just pulled it from a maiden in a tower.
Three!
Three.
And I almost had the fourth,
but she got away.
We've one entire day left.
Surely we can locate
the slipper by then.
We?
Do you mean
you're going to let me stay with you?
Perhaps it will take two of us
to have this child.
You've changed
You're daring 
You're different in the woods 
More sure
More sharing 
You're getting us through the woods 
If you could see 
You're not the man who started 
And much more openhearted 
Than I knew you to be 
It takes two 
I thought one was enough
It's not true 
It takes two of us
You came through 
When the journey was rough
It took you 
It took two of us
It takes care 
It takes patience and fear and despair
To change 
Though you swear
To change 
Who can tell if you do? 
It takes two 
You've changed 
You're thriving
There's something about the woods 
Not just surviving 
You're blossoming in the woods 
At home I'd fear 
We'd stay the same forever 
And then, out here 
You're passionate, charming
Considerate, clever 
It takes one 
To begin
But then once you've begun 
It takes two of you
It's no fun 
But what needs to be done
You can do 
When there's two of you 
If I dare 
It's because I'm becoming
Aware of us 
As a pair of us 
Each accepting a share 
Of what's there 
We've changed 
We're strangers
I'm meeting you in the woods 
Who minds what dangers? 
I know we'll get past the woods 
And once we're past 
Let's hope the changes last 
Beyond woods 
Beyond witches
and slippers and hoods 
Just the two of us
Beyond lies 
Safe at home with our beautiful prize 
Just the few of us
It takes trust 
It takes just a bit more
And we're done 
We want four, we had none 
We've got three
We need one 
It takes two 
Stop m Stop my egg!
Oh, brilliant! My MilkyWhite!
I've missed you so much!
Where did you get this?
From the giant's hen.
A golden egg!
I've never seen a golden egg before.
And you can have it,
along with the five gold pieces.
What five gold pieces?
Now I'm taking my cow.
No! I do not wish to sell.
But you took the five gold pieces.
I didn't take, you gave.
But you said I could have my cow!
Where are the five gold pieces?
I never said you could. I said you might.
You would take money before a child?
No, no, no, it's not like that.
It wasn't like that.
It's not like I've done a deal with him.
How could you do that?
It all just happened so fast.
MilkyWhite!
MilkyWhite is dead.
What?
Two midnights gone! 
As dawn broke 
the Baker and his wife
had but one day left 
to reverse the Witch's curse. 
As for Rapunzel's Prince, 
he returned yet again
to the forbidden tower. 
No! Bad idea!
Are you all right?
Yep, yeah. Feel fine. Fine.
What did I clearly say?
Children must listen 
No! Please!
What were you not to do?
Children must see 
No!
And learn 
Why could you not obey? 
Children should listen 
What have I been to you? 
What would you have me be? 
Handsome like a prince? 
But I am old
I am ugly 
I embarrass you
No! 
You are ashamed of me 
No!
You are ashamed 
You don't understand 
I'm no longer a child.
I wish to see the world.
Don't you know what's
out there in the world? 
Someone has to shield you
from the world 
Stay with me 
Princes wait there in the world, it's true 
Princes, yes, but wolves
and humans, too 
Stay at home 
I am home 
Who out there 
Could love you more than I? 
What out there 
That I cannot supply? 
Stay with me 
Stay with me 
The world is dark and wild 
Stay a child 
While you can be a child 
With me 
I gave you protection
and yet you disobeyed me.
No.
Your prince will never
lay eyes on you again.
He will never lay eyes
on anything again.
What did you do to him?
It doesn't matter,
because where you're going
no one will ever see you again!
No! No!
No!
Hey, there. Nice cape.
Stay away from my cape,
or I'll slash you into a thousand bits!
I don't want it.
Where did you get it?
My granny made it for me
from a wolf that attacked us.
And she gave me
this beautiful knife for protection.
Look what I have. A golden egg.
Where did you get that egg?
I stole a hen that lays golden eggs
from the kingdom of the giant.
I don't believe you.
It's true. And you should see
the giant's toy harp.
It plays the most beautiful tunes
without you even having to touch it.
Of course it does.
Why don't you go up
to the kingdom right now,
bring it back and show it to me?
I could.
You could not.
I could!
You could not, Mr. Liar!
I'm not a liar.
I'll get that harp, you'll see!
Jack took the little girl's dare, 
and before he knew it 
found himself fleeing from a giant. 
Bring back my harp!
I'll grind your bones!
Okay, we don't have much time left.
I don't know where to start.
You can start by buying a new cow
with the money you took from the boy.
Right, okay, and where do I buy a cow?
Just go to the next village.
I'm sure you'll find a cow there.
Okay, and what are you going to do?
I'm going to get the slipper.
The yellow slipper?
The golden slipper!
The golden slipper, that's right.
Where are you going to find it?
I've met a maiden,
these two previous nights,
with golden slippers.
Do you think you can get one?
I'm sure of it.
Wait.
Why are we always separating?
Because we have to,
if we're going to be together.
What?
The entire kingdom shook 
when the beanstalk
came crashing down, 
killing the giant. 
As for the indecisive Cinderella, 
she fled from the Prince. 
Again. 
After her!
He's a very smart prince 
He's a prince who prepares 
Knowing this time I'd run from him 
He spread pitch on the stairs 
And I'm caught unawares 
Well, it means that he cares 
This is more than just malice 
Better stop and take stock 
While you're standing here stuck 
On the steps of the palace 
All right, what do you want? 
Have to make a decision 
Why not stay and be caught? 
Should I give that a thought? 
What would be his response? 
But then what if he knew who I am 
When I know that I'm not
What he thinks that he wants? 
Or then, what if I am 
What a prince would envision? 
But then how can you know
Who you are till you know 
What you want, which I don't? 
So then, which do you pick? 
Where you're safe
out of sight and yourself 
But where everything's wrong? 
Or where everything's right 
But you know that you'll never belong? 
And whichever you pick
Do it quick 
'Cause you're starting to stick 
To the steps of the palace 
It's my first big decision 
The choice isn't easy to make 
To arrive at a ball
ls exciting and all 
Once you're there, though, it's scary 
And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave 
But you have to be wary 
There's a lot that's at stake 
But I've stalled long enough 
'Cause I'm still standing stuck 
In the stuff on these steps 
Better run along home 
And avoid the collision 
Though at home, they don't care 
I'll be better off there 
Where there's nothing to choose 
So there's nothing to lose 
So I'll pry up my shoes 
Wait, though, thinking it through 
Things don't have to collide 
I know what my decision is
Which is not to decide 
I'll just leave him a clue 
For example 
A shoe 
And then see what he'll do 
Now it's he and not you
Who'll be stuck with a shoe 
In a stew 
In the goo 
And I've learned something, too 
Something I never knew 
On the steps of the palace 
With me! Quick, men!
She mustn't get away!
The Ball is over. Send everyone home.
And the Princess?
She won't get far with one shoe.
Don't come any closer to me!
Please, just stop.
Just hear me out.
You have attacked me once before.
I didn't attack you...
I attacked your shoe. I need it.
Look. I have a magic bean
in exchange for it.
Magic bean?
Yes.
Nonsense!
No!
Wait, please! I haven't much time!
I need that shoe, to have a child.
That makes no sense!
Does it make sense
that you're running from a prince?
Stop! You there, stop!
I must go!
Here, take my shoes. You'll run faster.
Here.
Thank you!
Stop!
Thank you, thank you.
What is that you have in your hand?
Nothing. It's mine.
Lying will cost you your life.
I don't care if it
costs me my life, just get off!
You will pay for this!
No!
Sire, I have succeeded
in obtaining the other slipper.
Please, kind Prince,
let me have the slipper,
and all will come to a happy end.
Step back, peon!
Do as she says, Steward!
We only need one.
Thank you.
We must search immediately
for the maiden who fits this slipper.
Tonight?
This very night! On!
Forward!
And in her haste, 
the Baker's wife took no notice 
of a second beanstalk
climbing skyward. 
Let it be known that His Royal
Highness, the Crown Prince,
will be visiting every house
in this village tonight.
All young maidens
are hereby commanded
to remain in their home
until visited by the Royal Guard.
Open the gates.
His Royal Highness approaches.
The Prince wishes to meet all the
young maidens of this house.
All young maidens
prepare to meet the Prince.
As the Prince anxiously waited, 
the Stepmother took matters, 
and Florinda's foot,
into her own hands. 
Careful, my toe
Darling, I know 
What'll we do?
It'll have to go 
But when you're his bride
You can sit or ride 
You'll never need to walk 
Minus one toe, 
Florinda mounted the Prince's horse 
unaware of the blood
dripping from the slipper. 
Lucinda was next. 
Why won't it fit? 
Darling, be still 
Cut off a bit of the heel and it will 
And when you're his wife
You'll have such a life 
You'll never need to walk 
Minus a heel, 
Lucinda did her best
to swallow the pain. 
It's a perfect fit, Your Highness.
Have you no other daughters?
Only a little, stunted kitchen wench,
which her late father left behind.
But she cannot present herself.
She is too dirty.
I would recognize
these beautiful eyes anywhere.
You.
You are my true bride.
Get down. Get down.
As punishment for their cruelty, 
Cinderella's birds
swooped down upon the stepsisters 
and blinded them. 
As for Rapunzel, 
the Witch had
banished her to a swamp 
in the darkest depths of the forest. 
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel!
Rapunzel!
My darling?
My darling!
I'm here!
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel!
Is that you?
I'm blind, I can't see.
How could she do this to you?
Rapunzel?
What?
I can see you.
Your hair!
I like it.
Come on.
We don't have much time.
Come on!
I found you!
You got the cow!
And you've got the slipper!
We've got all four!
Yes, we've got all four!
I see a cow.
I see a slipper.
Yes.
And the cape as red as blood.
And the hair as yellow as corn.
We've got all four!
Wait a minute.
That cow doesn't look
as white as milk to me.
Of course she is.
Of course it is. Come on.
She has to be.
This cow has been covered with flour!
You didn't get a real white cow?
We had a cow as white as milk.
Honestly, we did!
Then where is she?
She's dead!
And we thought
that you would prefer a live cow.
Of course I would prefer a live cow!
So, show me the dead cow,
I'll bring her back to life.
Let's go!
Yeah, okay! It's this way, this way!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
There you are!
I've been worried sick about you!
There's a dead giant in our backyard!
There is?
You know there is!
You could have been crushed!
But, Mother, look!
The most beautiful harp!
You've stolen too much!
You could have been killed
climbing down that plant!
Come on, quick!
We buried her under some leaves!
Here, here, it's here!
What's happening?
She's going to bring
MilkyWhite back to life.
She can do that?
She's a witch, she can do anything.
Stand back.
MilkyWhite, you're back!
I can't believe it!
It's almost midnight!
Quiet!
Feed the objects to the cow.
What?
You heard me! Feed them to the cow!
Really?
Just try it.
Fill that With milk.
I'll do it. She'll only milk for me.
Good boy.
Squeeze, pal. You can do it.
It's not working!
What?
Wrong ingredients.
Forget about your child.
No,no,no!
We followed your instructions.
One, the cow is as white as milk.
Correct?
Yes.
Two, the cape was certainly
as red as blood.
Yes.
Three, there was the slipper.
And four, I compared
the hair to this ear of corn!
I pulled this from a maiden in a tower.
You what?
What were you doing there?
Nothing, I was passing by.
I touched that hair!
I told you I can't have touched
any of the ingredients!
How are we supposed...
The corn! The corn!
What?
You can use the silky hair off the corn!
Yes. Pull it from the ear.
Yes!
Feed it to the cow. Quickly!
It's working!
She's milking!
At last!
That was quick!
And it came to pass 
all that seemed wrong was now right. 
The Witch succeeded
in reversing her mother's curse. 
Cinderella finally stopped
running from her Prince. 
Jack was reunited
with his beloved cow, 
and his mother could now dress in the
best a golden egg could buy. 
And the Baker and his wife
were proud parents 
of a strapping baby boy. 
Thanks for the slipper!
Attention!
Let us cheer the newlyweds
as they embark...
And so,
with the kingdom filled with joy, 
those who deserved to 
were destined to live happily ever... 
Jack!
Rapunzel!
Attention! Attention!
Rapunzel!
Let there be no panic!
No panic!
Jack!
Jack!
The Royal Prince
wishes to address his loyal subjects.
Attention!
There is no need for worry.
It was just an earthquake
in a far quadrant of our kingdom.
Nothing to fear at all. 
I will personally
investigate the disturbance. 
Now everyone, back to your villages 
and on with your lives. 
But as they made
their way back into the woods, 
their familiar paths
were nowhere to be found. 
And their lives were about
to take an unexpected turn. 
Here, here, watch out.
I'm sure this is the way home.
Everything's so different.
Oh, look.
Hello, little one.
Hello, Mr. Baker.
Are you all right?
What are you doing here,
with a suitcase?
I'm moving in with my granny.
Our whole village collapsed,
and I couldn't find my mother anywhere,
and now I can't find
my granny's cottage.
What do you mean?
Well, I went down the dell,
but I didn't recognize anything.
There was no path!
Where is she? Where's Granny?
It's okay. It's okay.
Calm down, calm down.
We can help you find
Granny's without the path.
Will you just hold
him for a few moments?
Really?
Yes.
You'll come with us.
Why does he always
cry when I hold him?
Well, you needn't hold him
as though he was so fragile.
He doesn't want me.
He wants his mother.
I can't take care of him all the time.
I will take care of him when he's older.
Mind your head. Watch your heads.
Who might that be?
It's the Steward and the royal family.
Hello there.
What brings you into the woods?
The royal quarters
have been destroyed.
No!
The kingdom is under attack.
What is the royal family going to do?
How should I know?
I don't make policy, I just carry it out.
I think it best we just go back to
the village. We'll take the girl with us.
Come with us, you're going to be fine.
You are going to come with us, all right?
Oh, my God.
It's a giant!
It's a giant woman!
Where is the lad
who killed my husband?
There is no lad here!
We haven't seen him!
We will get him for you right away!
Don't move!
It was you who destroyed
our house, not an earthquake!
And who destroyed my house?
I want him!
Here, would you
like a blind girl instead?
How dare you? She wants the boy!
Jack!
Has anybody seen my Jack?
He ran off again.
Have you seen Jack? What?
She is looking for him, too.
Give him to me!
Jack is just a lad!
We had no food to eat,
so he sold his cow
in exchange for some magic beans.
The boy! I want the boy!
You leave my boy alone!
I'm waiting!
Be quiet, woman,
or you'll get us all killed!
You must be quiet!
Flouncing through our kingdom
in your great big clodhoppers...
Let us not anger the giant!
...destroying everything in your path!
Let's not anger the giant.
You're just a big bully!
I'm gonna get my boy
and hide him so you'll never find him!
You'll never, never, ever...
Get back, woman!
The boy is hiding in the steeple tower!
You can find him there!
Yes!
That's true!
Yes!
Yes, we saw him there!
And if he is not, I will return tonight
and find you.
All of you!
Are you okay?
Look.
What have you done to her?
What?
I didn't mean to hurt her.
I was just thinking of the greater good.
If we're going to get through this
we're going to do it
if we all stick together.
Some people are cut out
to battle giants.
Others are not.
I don't have the constitution.
And as long as I
can be of no help, I'm going to hide.
Let's go.
Everything will work out fine in the end.
Not always.
Come along.
I don't know
where they think they're going.
The giant's already destroyed
the entire village.
Only thing left of my garden
are these beans.
What are we going to do now?
We have no choice.
Find the boy
and give her what she wants.
But if We do, she'll kill Jack!
And if we don't,
she'll kill half the kingdom!
We mustn't let her get Jack!
We're not going to. It's okay.
You promise?
I promise.
Just rest.
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel!
You're safe!
Thank goodness!
Who are you?
Surely you remember.
Of course,
you don't recognize me.
Mother?
This is who I truly am, my dear.
Now you don't have to
be embarrassed by me.
But you must come with me.
There is a giant in the land.
My darling!
Are you all right?
Why did you run off?
I was afraid.
Come with me.
No, no, no!
She is not going with you.
You will come with me.
I will not come with you.
Well, then, you leave me no choice.
No!
No!
Oh, my God.
Wait.
You are the one who blinded me.
And locked me in a tower.
To protect you!
And banished me to an island
in the middle of a swamp!
I was just trying to be a good mother.
Rapunzel, no!
You will never be safe with him!
Take me away from here.
No!
Don't you understand?
I never want to see you again! Ever!
But, Rapunzel, the giant!
No matter what you say 
Children won't listen 
No matter what you know 
Children refuse 
To learn 
Guide them along the way 
Still they don't listen 
Children can only grow 
From something you love 
To something you lose 
Jack! 
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack, where are you?
Jack!
We're never going to find him.
I think we should fan out.
It will increase our chances.
I'm not leaving you on your own.
I'll be all right.
What if we get lost?
We count our steps from right here.
I'll go, too!
No. You know what?
You are going to stay
right here with the baby.
And we'll be right back.
You would leave our child with her?
He's asleep.
He will be safe with the girl.
I'm very capable
of taking care of the baby.
See?
What if the giant comes back?
What if, what if!
500 paces. Go.
One, two, three...
Wait, wait, wait.
Here.
Let me give you this.
I don't want you to get cold.
Okay.
One, two, three, four, five...
Jack!
Six, seven, eight,
nine, ten...
Jack!
Hello, Your Royal Highness.
Well, hello.
Hello, again.
We've met before, actually.
Yes, of course.
Yes.
You must be here to slay the giant.
The giant?
Yes.
Haven't you heard?
We have a giant in our midst.
Not an earthquake.
Of course.
The giant.
It's a lady giant.
Which is very unusual.
I should think so.
And why are you alone in the woods?
Well, I came here with my husband.
And we were...
Well, you see, it's a long story.
And he would let you roam
alone in the woods?
Well, no, actually. It was my choice.
How brave.
Brave?
Yes.
Anything can happen in the woods 
May I kiss you? 
Any moment we could be crushed 
Don't feel rushed 
This is ridiculous
What am I doing here? 
I'm in the wrong story 
Wait, wait, wait, we can't do this!
You have a princess!
Well, yes, I do.
And I have a baker.
Of course.
You're right. How foolish.
Foolishness can happen in the woods 
Once again, please 
Let your hesitations be hushed 
Any moment, big or small
ls a moment, after all 
Seize the moment, skies may fall
Any moment 
But this is not right!
Right and wrong don't
matter in the woods 
Only feelings 
Let us meet the moment unblushed 
Life is often so unpleasant 
You must know that, as a peasant 
Best to take the moment present 
As a present for the moment 
Excuse me, ma'am.
You haven't seen
a boy anywhere, have you?
He's about so high.
I'm sorry, may I be of some service?
The tree has fallen.
Mother's grave, destroyed.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't complain.
I'm sure others have
suffered worse after the earthquake.
No, no, this isn't an earthquake.
There's a giant terrorizing the kingdom.
Then I'm sure the Prince will see to it
that the giant is rid from our land.
The Prince?
No doubt he's off somewhere
seducing some young maiden.
What?
You look like the Princess, but dirty.
Oh, my! You are the...
I didn't recognize you, honestly.
No, no. Please, get up.
I'm not a princess here.
I had to disguise myself.
I'm not permitted to leave
the palace unescorted.
If you'd like, you could come with me.
I mean, you'll be safe in our company.
Thank you.
It's this way. My wife is somewhere.
We decided to walk 500 paces
in one direction...
I must leave you.
Now I must go off to slay a giant.
I shall not forget you.
How brave you are
to be alone in the woods.
And how alive you've made me feel.
What was that?
Was that me? Was that him? 
Did a prince really kiss me? 
And kiss me? And kiss me? 
And did I kiss him back? 
Was it wrong? Am I mad? 
Is that all? Does he miss me? 
Was he suddenly
Getting bored with me? 
Wake up, stop dreaming
Stop prancing about the woods 
It's not beseeming
What is it about the woods? 
Back to life, back to sense
Back to child, back to husband 
No one lives in the woods 
There are vows, there are ties 
There are needs, there are standards 
There are shouldn'ts and shoulds 
Why not both instead? 
There's the answer, if you're clever 
Have a child for warmth
And a baker for bread 
And a prince for whatever 
Never 
It's these woods 
Face the facts, find the boy
Join the group, stop the giant 
Just get out of these woods 
Was that him? Yes, it was
Was that me? No, it wasn't 
Just a trick of the woods 
Just a moment 
One peculiar, passing moment 
Must it all be either less or more? 
Either plain or grand? 
Is it always "Or"? Is it never "And"? 
That's what woods are for 
For those moments in the woods 
Oh, if life were made of moments 
Even now and then a bad one 
But if life were only moments 
Then you'd never know you had one 
First a witch, then a child
Then a prince, then a moment 
Who can live in the woods? 
And to get what you wish
Only just for a moment 
These are dangerous woods 
Let the moment go 
Don't forget it for a moment, though 
Just remembering you've had an "And" 
When you're back to "Or" 
Makes the "Or" mean more
Than it did before 
Now I understand 
And it's time to leave the woods 
Which way was it?
She should be back by now.
She wouldn't get lost.
I'm sure she'll return soon.
I'm going to go and look for her.
Will you?
Look who I found.
You're hurting me!
Let go of him!
I'll let go of him
when I give him to the giant.
Leave him alone!
Keep away from him!
Stop! Stop! I said stop!
Where did you find this?
I'm sorry, sir.
It's my wife's.
I'm sorry. I came upon her.
She was at the bottom of a cliff.
What are you saying?
How awful.
No.
No!
This is all my fault.
I shouldn't have let
her wander off alone.
I should have made her stay with me.
Remorse will get you nowhere.
My wife is dead!
Wake up!
When you're dead, you're dead.
It's time we get this
boy to the giant before we're all dead.
Keep away from him!
This is no time to be softhearted!
He's going to the giant
and I'm taking him!
Yes! Yes, he's the one to blame!
It's because of you there's a giant in our
midst, and my wife is dead!
But it isn't my fault
I was given those beans 
You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans 
And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk 
To get up to the giants
In the first place 
Wait a minute 
Magic beans
For a cow so old 
That you had to tell a lie to sell it
Which you told 
Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold? 
Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold 
See, it's your fault
No! 
Yes, it's your fault
No! 
Yes, it is
It's not! 
It's true
Wait a minute though 
I only stole the gold to get my cow back
From you 
So it's your fault
Yes! 
No, it isn't 
I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed 
She made us get a cow
To get the curse reversed 
It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed 
And the place got cursed
In the first place 
Oh, then it's his fault
So 
It was his fault
No! 
Yes, it is, it's his 
I guess
Wait a minute though 
I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear 
But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer 
ls how did the second giant
Get down here 
In the first place
Second place? 
Yes.
How?
Well, who had the other bean? 
The other bean?
The other bean? 
You pocketed the other bean
I didn't. Yes, I did 
So it's your fault 
No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife 
So it's her fault
No, it isn't 
Then whose is it?
Wait a minute 
She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe 
So the one who knows what happened
To the bean is you 
You mean that old bean
That your wife... Oh, dear 
But I never knew and so I threw...
Well, don't look here 
So it's your fault
But. ..
See, it's her fault
But... 
And it isn't mine at all 
But what? 
Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again 
We were needy 
You were greedy
Did you need that hen? 
But I got it for my mother 
So it's her fault then 
Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place? 
The harp, yes 
She went and dared me to
I dared you to? 
She said that I was scared
Me? 
So she dared me
No, I didn't 
So it's your fault 
Wait a minute
If you hadn't dared him to 
And you had left the harp alone 
If you hadn't thrown away the bean
In the first place 
If she hadn't raised
them in the first place 
If you hadn't raised
them in the first place 
You raised the beans in the first place
It's your fault 
You're responsible
You're the one to blame 
It's your fault 
It's the last midnight 
It's the last wish 
It's the last midnight 
Soon it will be boom
Squish 
Told a little lie 
Stole a little gold 
Broke a little vow 
Did you? 
Had to get your prince 
Had to get your cow 
Had to get your wish
Doesn't matter how 
Anyway, it doesn't matter now 
It's the last midnight 
It's the boom
Splat 
Nothing but a vast midnight 
Everybody smashed flat 
Nothing we can do 
Not exactly true 
We could always give her the boy 
No, of course 
What really matters is the blame
Someone you can blame 
Fine, if that's the thing you enjoy
Placing the blame 
If that's the aim
Give me the blame 
Just give me the boy 
No!
No!
No.
You're so nice 
You're not good
You're not bad 
You're just nice 
I'm not good
I'm not nice 
I'm just right 
I'm the Witch 
You're the world 
I'm the hitch
I'm what no one believes 
I'm the Witch 
You're all liars and thieves
Like his father 
Like his son will be, too 
Oh, why bother? 
You'll just do what you do 
It's the last midnight
So goodbye, all 
Coming at you fast
Midnight 
Soon you'll see the sky fall 
Here, you want a bean? 
Have another bean 
Beans were made for making you rich 
Plant them and they soar
Here, you want some more? 
Listen to the roar
Giants by the score 
Oh well, you can blame another witch 
It's the last midnight 
It's the last verse 
Now, before it's past midnight 
I'm leaving you my last curse 
I'm leaving you alone 
You can tend the garden, it's yours
Separate and alone 
Everybody down on all fours 
All right, Mother, when? 
Lost the beans again
Punish me the way you did then 
Give me claws and a hunch 
Just away from this bunch
And the gloom 
And the doom
And the boom 
Crunch! 
Maybe I shouldn't have
stolen from the giant.
Maybe I shouldn't have
strayed from the path.
Maybe I shouldn't have
attended the Ball.
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have.
Where are you going?
Away from here.
But you said we had
to find our way out of this together.
It doesn't matter if we're
together or we're apart.
We need your help.
You don't understand!
I depended on my wife for everything!
She was the one who helped.
You would leave your child?
He'll be happier
in the arms of a princess.
But wait!
What are you doing here?
Son...
I don't want to talk to you.
It's because of you all of this happened!
Go away!
I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing.
Why would you do that?
Why did you take the Witch's beans?
They were there and I wanted them.
I didn't think. I was being careless.
Selfish.
Yes.
You stole and you got caught,
and you did what you do.
You just ran away.
When your mother died, I was...
I hated myself. I ran away
from my guilt and my shame.
And your son.
Yes, my son, and I'm sorry for that.
Then what do you want?
Aren't you making the same mistake?
Aren't you running away?
Be better than me,
SOD.
Do better.
See, so this is you,
and you're going to come over here.
If there were just some way
we could surprise the giant.
She's too tall to surprise.
So, that's why
I'm going to be behind here.
Yeah, and then you can come here,
climb on top...
I knew you wouldn't give up.
He wouldn't leave his baby.
It looked like he was going to.
Give me my son.
What are we gonna do now?
We need to rid this kingdom
of the giant together.
She'll be back soon, so here's the plan.
We're going to feed Jack to the giant.
What?
No!
We're going to use you as bait!
Bait?
To lure the giant to the tar pit.
The birds can help!
Good friends, we need
your help now more than ever.
What of the prince?
That doesn't matter now.
What's important is that
we find a way to defeat the giant.
Yes!
Thank you, birds!
You can talk to birds?
The birds will do their part.
Okay, we don't have much time.
I'm excited!
First, we'll need a weapon.
I wish I had my sling!
We can make some.
Your father is being very brave.
We're going to be very brave too.
Are you all right, miss?
The giant went in that direction.
My darling!
Oh, my darling!
I did not recognize you.
What are you doing here?
And with a child?
You must get back to the castle at once.
There is a giant on the loose.
I'm well aware of that.
My love, what is it?
Maybe I'm not your only love.
I love you! Truly, I do.
If you love me, why did you stray?
I thought that if you were mine,
I would never wish for more.
If this is how you behave as a prince,
what kind of king will you be?
I was raised to be charming,
not sincere.
I think you should go.
Is that what you really wish?
My father's house was a nightmare.
Your house a dream.
Now I want something inbetween.
I shall always love
the maiden who ran away.
And I the faraway prince.
Careful. Not so fast.
Don't worry.
This is easier than the beanstalk.
They're up in the tree! Over there!
We made slings out of my cape!
I wanted to climb the tree too.
I'm glad you're here to help me.
What's wrong?
I think my granny
and my mother would be upset with me.
Why?
They said to always make them proud.
And here I am, about to kill somebody.
Not somebody.
A giant who's done a lot of harm.
But a giant is a person.
Aren't we to show forgiveness?
Mother cannot guide you 
Now you're on your own 
Only me beside you 
Still you're not alone 
No one is alone, truly 
No one is alone 
I Wish...
I know.
Wait until my mother
hears I've slain the giant.
Jack,
there's something you need to know.
It's about your mother.
What?
She didn't make it.
Was she killed by the giant?
No.
It wasn't like that.
She was fighting with the giant,
she was trying to protect you,
and she was pushed by the Steward.
And she fell.
The Steward will pay for this.
No, Jack!
After we slay the giant, I will slay him!
You'll do nothing of the kind.
What he did was wrong.
He should be punished.
It's not as easy as that.
Mother isn't here now 
Wrong things, right things 
Who knows what she'd say? 
Who can say what's true? 
Nothing's quite so clear now 
Do things, fight things 
Feel you've lost your way? 
You decide 
But you are not alone 
Believe me
No one is alone 
No one is alone 
Believe me 
Truly 
People make mistakes 
Fathers 
Mothers 
People make mistakes 
Holding to their own 
Thinking they're alone 
Honor their mistakes 
Fight for their mistakes 
Everybody makes 
One another's
Terrible mistakes 
Witches can be right 
Giants can be good 
You decide what's right 
You decide what's good 
Just remember 
Just remember 
Someone is on your side 
Our side 
Our side
Someone else is not 
While we're seeing our side 
Our side
Our side 
Maybe we forgot 
They are not alone 
No one is alone 
Someone is on your side 
No one is alo... 
Go, Jack.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Here she comes.
Where is the boy?
We have him!
Where?
He's hiding in that tree!
Here I am!
You ready?
Ready!
Good birds!
She does not look happy.
Look out, Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack?
Where are they?
Jack!
Jack!
Mr. Baker!
Jack!
Over here!
Jack!
Take him!
Be careful!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Careful, careful!
Where is he?
He's not with you?
Jack!
Mr. Baker!
Jack!
Help me!
Jack, I'm here!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Okay?
Yeah!
You okay? You all right?
Yeah.
All right? Yeah?
We did it.
We did it!
And now we can return home.
What home?
I have no one to take care of me.
And we have nowhere to go.
So we'll move in with you.
Well, it's...
Of course.
Of course you can come
and stay with me.
And you can come too!
Only if you want to.
I'll gladly help you with your house.
There are times
I actually enjoy cleaning.
Here.
What's this?
Come on, now.
I know.
I know, you miss your mother.
I miss her too.
Please.
Maybe I just wasn't
meant to have children.
Don't say that. 
Of course you were
meant to have children. 
But how can I go about being a father
when I had no father to show me?
Just calm the child 
Yes, calm the child 
Look, tell him the story
Of how it all happened 
Be father and mother
You'll know what to do 
Alone.
Sometimes people leave you 
Halfway through the wood 
Do not let it grieve you 
No one leaves for good 
You are not alone 
No one is alone 
Hold him to the light now 
Let him see the glow 
Things will be all right now 
Tell him what you know 
Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom,
there lay a small village
at the edge of the woods.
Careful the things you say 
And in this village...
Children will listen 
...there lived a young maiden...
Careful the things you do
...a carefree young lad...
Children will see 
...and a childless baker...
And learn 
...With his Wife.
Guide them along the way 
Children will glisten 
Children will look to you 
For which way to turn 
To learn what to be 
Careful before you say "Listen to me" 
Children will listen 
Careful the wish you make 
Wishes are children 
Careful the path they take 
Wishes come true 
Not free 
Careful the spell you cast 
Not just on children 
Sometimes the spell may last 
Past what you can see 
And turn against you 
Careful the tale you tell 
That is the spell 
Children will listen 
I Wish...
