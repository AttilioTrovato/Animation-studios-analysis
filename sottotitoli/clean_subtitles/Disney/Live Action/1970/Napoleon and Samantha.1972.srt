Ouch! Shh!
I bumped my knee.
Who cares about your dumb old knee?
Now, be quiet and stay down.
Okay?
What are you doing that for?
'Cause that's what they always do.
Who?
The Indians.
Now you stay here, and I'll
tell you when to come.
Okay?
Oh, boots. Stay down, okay? 
Shh.
Be quiet, boots.
Shh!
No, boots. Shh! Down!
Boots, hush up out there! 
Oh, boots. Get away.
You hear me, boots? 
Hush up out there! 
Here. This oughta shut ya up.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
How did he do that?
Sam.
Quick, take these. Hurry.
Well, if it isn't big
chief red top himself?
I don't see
much of you, Samantha,
since your ma took to bargain
huntin' at the supermarket.
Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.
Everybody's squeezin' out
the smallbusiness man.
And those empties
don't help either.
It does seem to me...
I get more of these
things back than I sell.
How's that grandpa
of yours doin'?
I haven't been to see him for a while.
Oh, he's okay.
Well, that's six bottles.
Be 12 cents.
You want the usual? Yes, sir.
Maybe you ought to ask
this young lady what she wants.
She wants the same as me.
Samantha?
That's right.
I want the same as him.
Okay.
Two suckers on the house
and the bottles in jelly beans.
But you better watch out,
Napoleon.
When a woman starts agreeing
with everything you say,
she's really got
her eye out for you.
I don't think it's right.
It's not stealing. I mean, we
gave him his bottles back.
But they were his bottles.
Well, anyway, I don't eat
the jelly beans myself.
They're for Charley.
Who's Charley?
Who's Charley?
You wanna meet him?
Yeah! Okay, I'll take ya,
but you gotta promise to help me on exams tomorrow.
I'm not supposed to.
Well, okay. Good. Come on.
Here, Charley! 
Over here, Charley! Come on!
Over here, Charley. Come on.
Charley's a horse.
Yeah. Over here, Charley.
Come on.
He knows ya? Of course he does.
Here, Charley!
What are you trying to do?
I'm gonna get on him.
He's teachin' me how to ride, so I
can be a cowboy like my grandpa was.
Your grandpa was a cowboy?
Yep. And he's part Indian too.
I don't believe you. He can't
be an Indian and a cowboy.
My grandpa can. Here, Charley!
Come on!
Yeah. Here's
your candy, Charley.
Come on. He can carry the two of us.
I can't ride.
Just hold on, okay? Come on. Hurry
up, before he finishes the candy.
Hurry, he's almost finished.
Hold on tight.
He's gonna go now.
Where to? Across the
field to the water.
The candies make him thirsty.
Come on. Giddyap. Come on.
Come on. Giddyap, Charley.
Giddyap. Come on.
See, isn't it fun? Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to have a
saddle and a bridle to hold?
Nah, that's only for people who don't
know how to ride. Giddyap. Yeeha!
Come on, Charley! Come on!
That's it.
He likes that. Yeah.
Come on.
Thanks for the ride, Charley.
Yeah, thanks a lot, Charley.
You're the best horse, Charley.
Goodbye. Goodbye!
Can you see her?
There's nobody there.
Good. She's probably still out.
She ever hit you for bein' late?
No.
I don't think housekeepers
are allowed to.
She just jabbers at me a lot.
Well, I'd better make
a run for it, napol...
oh, hi, gertrude.
So you finally decided 
to come home, hmm? 
Do you know what time it is?
No, ma'am. It's 6:00. 
Now I don't know what you've
been doing, young lady,
but let's get one thing
straight around here.
While your mother and father are
away, I'm responsible for you. 
I expect to see you home by 5:00.
Now, is that understood?
Yeah. Oh, go to your
room and get changed. 
You look like something
the cat dragged in.
See ya, Napoleon.
What have you got
all over your dress?
It's horse hair. Horse hair!
Grandpa, I'm home!
I'm home, grandpa! 
Hi, grandpa. Ahoy there, mate.
Say, you're late.
You been behavin' yourself?
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Gotta keep things
shipshape around here.
Permission to speak, sir?
Permission granted. 
Grandpa, all the other kids are
goin' to the movies. Can we go?
Well, now, that depends.
Depends on what?
On whether or not
you're gonna give...
Your grandpa's achin' back
a rub or not.
Sure.
Now, go on. Go on, now.
Get the liniment. Okay.
Did captain Morgan really die
in a Spanish prison, grandpa?
Not on your life, he didn't. There wasn't a
prison in the world could hold old Morgan.
There's nothin' as tough
as an old sea dog.
Do you think I could ever do all
the things you did, grandpa?
Well, if you eat your vittles
and keep your curiosity up...
And your wits about you,
you will.
 
What is it, grandpa?
Well, darned if I know.
 
Step right up.
Join the celebration.
It's a real, live lion!
Golly!
Hey, uh, what are
you celebratin'?
Oh, we are celebrating
an ending, my dear friends.
An ending? To what?
To a... a lifelong partnership. 
Yes, um, and
two glorious careers.
Oh, permit me.
Dimetri, the clown.
Brrrrrrrr.  Bada 
Uh, I'm, uh, Seth Wilson.
And I'm Napoleon.
And major, eh?
The king of beasts.
Won't you join us? 
Oh, please. I beg of you. 
Are you sure he won't object? Oh,
no, no, no, he won't object.
He's the most kind
and gentle king of beasts.
Would you do the honors, please?
The honors?
Oh, yes, yes.
Have you seen such a thing? 
So you're retirin'?
Dimetri is finally
going home... to Europe.
Is the lion goin' with ya?
Well, uh, that is the predicament.
That is the sadness.
Why? What's the matter? 
Old friends should
never be separated.
Oh, you mean you can't
take him with you.
What are you gonna do with him? 
Well, I'm searching
for a happy place...
Where his majesty will be
treated like his majesty.
Have you tried a zoo?
Oh, I have, I have.
And they have been
very kind and helpful, but...
They cannot find a place for
an old, milkdrinking lion,
an old veteran of joy.
Hey, my grandpa used to be
a lion trainer!
That was a long time ago,
Napoleon.
Did you work in the circus?
No! 
He trained lions 
for the emperor of Ethiopia! 
That was quite 
a long time ago, Napoleon. 
My dear friends,
my beloved friends,
the major is yours.
You mean that 
you're givin' him to us? 
Not I, but fate.
Oh, no, no, no, no. None of that.
We can't have a lion in our home.
Why not? 
Well, because he's a wild animal, that's why not.
Oh, no.
He doesn't look very wild to me.
And besides, you said
you were a lion trainer.
We can't have him in our home. He's too expensive.
We wouldn't be able to feed him. 
Why he must eat like a... like
a... like a... oh, no, no, no. 
Not major. He just drinks milk.
He has bad teeth.
Oh.
Please, grandpa.
No, no. We... we haven't got any place to keep a lion.
Yeah, we have. We have a cage.
Cage?
Oh, it's gonna take at least
a dozen quarts of milk...
To keep this boy goin' 
for just one day. 
Don't worry, grandpa. I'm gonna
save all my pocket money...
Just to buy milk.
Hold on now. He isn't too
well acquainted with us yet.
He might be a little
feisty in the mornings.
Oh, grandpa. Ah, ah, ah, now.
Ahahah.
He knows us. He's part
of our family now.
Here ya are. Okay.
Look at him, grandpa.
I'm a lookin'.
Did I say a dozen quarts
of milk?
What he's gonna need
is a whole cow.
Oh! 
Well, one thing at least.
He started the hens
back to layin'.
Eheh, ahahah, ahahahah.
Oh, grandpa. Gyah.
Here. Have some more milk.
Well, I declare.
Bye, grandpa.
Oh, you off to school?
Yeah. Now don't
dawdle on the way.
I don't want that teacher
complainin' about you again. Okay.
Bye, major. Have a nice day.
See you when I come home.
You'll watch him for me, won't you, grandpa?
Of course I will.
And you remember
what I told you.
I will. Don't gossip about him.
If the authorities hear about him,
they'd take him away. Darn busybodies.
Yeah.
Bye, grandpa. Oh, Napoleon.
Yeah? You drop this off at the
post on your way, will ya?
Where's it goin'? New York.
Oh, yeah. Goodbye. Nyah.
Yeah. That's right.
Couple of oldtimers,
you and me, hmm?
Let's go see Charley.
No, I gotta go home.
Well, why? I just gotta.
That's why.
You wanna come over to
my house and play? No.
Can I come to yours? No!
I'm sorry.
Now can you keep a secret?
You know I can.
Then come on. Am I
supposed to guess or what?
You're not supposed
to do anything.
You'll just see it
when you see it.
It's a real, live lion!
His name is major. 
Think I could come in
and pet him?
Come on in.
He won't hurt ya. Pet him.
See? He's nice.
Sure is a nice lion.
Sure is. Couldn't be any nicer.
He drinks milk.
Must drink an awful lot.
He does.
Ah, see? See? Look, look, look.
See what he's doin'? See?
He won't even... ahh.
Twentysix quarts
in three days?
Sure gonna make a dent in the pension check.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Here ya are, Napoleon.
Thanks, Mr. Gutteridge.
Thank you.
You know, Seth... hmm?
You're lookin'
a mite peaked lately.
You feelin' all right?
Right as rain, amos.
Well, it stands to reason with all
that milk you've been drinkin'.
I'm not drinkin' it.
What are you doin'? 
Bathin' in the stuff? 
Yeah. How'd you guess? What?
Any doctor'll tell ya.
Milk baths. When a man gets to be
my age, milk supples the flesh.
You ought to try it on
that ornery hide of yours.
Gonna help me, Napoleon? 
So long, amos. 
So long, Seth.
Goodbye, Mr. Gutteridge.
Thanks again.
Bye, Napoleon.
You nappin', grandpa?
Whwhwhat? Me? Nappin'?
No. No. I was just
squinchin' my eyes,
lookin' for smoke signals.
Smoke signals? Where?
Mmm, over on yonder hill there.
Wild Indians, they send out their
messages along about this time of day.
Didn't I ever tell you?
No! Golly!
Hold it. II do believe
there is one now.
No. No, it's just a cloud. 
No, grandpa, I think
that is a smoke signal.
Yeah.
Come on, maj. Giddyap.
Ah, you're slow as molasses.
Gosh! Now git. Come on.
That's okay.
It was a good ride,
even if you can't gallop.
Okay.
Now, maj... now, you...
Get... in there.
Now... now go on!
Get in there. Your milk's
waitin' and everything, maj. 
Come... maj! Get in there.
There! Finally.
Golly.
I'm gonna go see grandpa, okay?
Hi, grandpa.
Ah, mornin', officer.
Me and maj have had
our ride already.
You were sleepin' so sound, I didn't
wanna wake ya. You gettin' up? 
I thought maybe I'd spend
a day in bed.
I'm not feelin'
so well this mornin'.
Is your tummy bad again?
Somethin' like that.
Hey, want me to fix you
breakfast in bed, captain?
Why, I'd like that.
Okay. I'll fix ya somethin'
real special, okay?
Why, thank you.
My, my, this looks good.
What's this?
Oh, that's an onion sandwich.
Oh.
What's this?
Oh, that's chocolate, strawberry and
vanilla ice cream, all melted up.
Oh, my, my. That is tasty.
But I think I...
I'll just save that.
Set it over there, will ya?
I'll just take my coffee. Okay.
Oh, that's the instant kind,
since I don't know how to perk.
But I put in two extra spoons.
It's good. It's good.
But I think I'll
just save this too.
Okay. Set it there.
I better go
clean up the kitchen.
Napoleon?
Yeah, grandpa?
Come here a minute, will ya? Sit down.
I... I want to talk to you.
What are we gonna talk about?
Us, Napoleon.
We are going to talk about us.
We've been a...
a good crew, haven't we?
The two of us? Shipmates? We've had
some good times together, haven't we?
We sure have, captain.
The trouble is, your old grandpa is gettin' older.
We both are.
I'm gonna be 11 in August.
Trouble is,
this old body of mine...
it just... it's just
gettin' older.
Uh, wrinkled old hands...
And tired old muscles.
The ticker just keeps missin'
a tick now and then.
Then I take a deep breath, I
just keep coughin' all the time.
But everybody coughs, grandpa.
Mm, yeah.
What are you gonna do...
With an old machine that
just keeps breakin' down?
Ya fix it.
Mmhmm.
What about when
you can't fix it no more?
Well, you gotta trade it in
for a new one.
That's just what
I'm going to do.
I'm gonna trade this old machine
of mine in for a new one.
Mmhmm. 
What do you mean, grandpa?
Oh, it's nothin' to be
concerned about.
Nothin' to be scared
or frightened about.
It's just that, uh,
my old body is... is dyin'.
I'm not surprised.
It's a wonder it didn't do it years
before, the way I've treated it. 
I never knew anyone
who died before.
Nobody ever really dies,
Napoleon.
The thing that's real in you...
Just keeps goin'
on and on forever.
You know, in a way, 
we're like the seasons... 
life is. 
You're born in the spring.
Then you grow up
during the hot, warm summer.
And autumn's the time
when you reach maturity.
You're at your peak.
And then...
then there's the winter.
It gives us all a chance
to go quickly back to spring...
And start all over again.
But you still have to go away and
leave me, don't you, grandpa?
No, no, that... that 
doesn't follow at all. 
You see, I've always wanted
to take my rest...
Up... up... up there
on the hill...
Where we used to like to sit
and watch the sunset.
Of course, I've made my peace 
with my almighty, 
so I know he's not
gonna be too concerned...
About my not havin' an expensive
funeral and all that.
And besides, your Uncle, 
he'll see to all those things.
You never said I had an Uncle
or anything like that before.
Well, ya have. And he's 
your last livin' relative. 
He's the one I wrote
and told him all about you.
Is he gonna come
and stay with us?
Well, I haven't heard
from him yet, but he'll be here.
When I go away, he is the one
that's goin' to take care of you.
What's his name?
Charley Hammond.
I know a horse named Charley.
Do ya, now?
Gee, I hope your grandpa's
feelin' better.
Yeah, I'm gonna go in
and see him right now.
We'll feed major
a little later.
Wait here, will ya? All right.
Grandpa, I'm home!
Oh, I'm sorry, grandpa.
I didn't know you were asleep.
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
Remember, son, it's nothin' 
to be frightened about. 
Just means that 
old grandpa's set free... 
To get around again. 
What's the matter, Napoleon?
Somethin' wrong?
Did you ever know anyone
that died before?
No. Did... 
my grandpa just did. 
Oh, Napoleon.
It's...
it's nothing to be
scared or worried about.
Just means that...
My grandpa's free to do
what he wants to now.
See, that's just
his old body in there.
You know, my grandpa
said that...
Nobody ever really dies
because...
The thing that's real
inside of you...
Goes on and on
forever and ever.
I think that's very beautiful,
Napoleon, but...
Who's gonna look after you now?
My Uncle. Where's he?
In New York. When's he coming?
I don't know just yet.
He's supposed to write.
What's it say?
"Unclaimed mail."
Do you know what that is?
I think it means that...
Nobody was there
to get the letter.
Huh, Napoleon?
Was that your only Uncle?
Well, haven't you got
any more relatives? No.
Well, then, you have to
live at the orphanage.
That's where they put people
that don't have any relatives.
I won't go. They'll make ya.
No, they won't, 'cause I'm not gonna
tell anybody my grandpa's dead.
Well, you can't keep
that a secret.
Yes, I can, and you
better not tell anybody.
But they'll see the funeral.
There's not gonna be
any funeral.
I'm gonna bury my grandpa
up there on our hill,
where we used to sit
and watch the sunset.
That's what he always wanted.
He told me that.
Well, who's gonna do it?
I'll have to do it myself.
He's too big for you to bury.
Then I'll have to
hire somebody.
Do you know anybody I could use?
No.
You'll have to go see
the employment office.
But you better hurry. They
probably close at 5:00.
How ya doin', general?
I'm a captain.
Well, if you're a captain,
where's your hat?
I haven't got it yet.
I just became a captain.
Oh.
Next, please.
Hi. Occupation?
Well, I have a degree in political
science, but what I really want...
we have this job
in a lumber camp,
but if you qualify,
it's steady employment.
Well, ma'am, I don't want it
to be too steady.
I'm still going to school. Sorry.
That's all we have.
Well, don't you have just...
just a little odd job?
I have to buy a book:
Thompson's theory 
of modern organization. 
We only deal with people who are
interested in regular employment.
Closed for now.
Right, right.
Well, thank you very much, ma'am.
Appreciate it.
Hello again.
I was wondering if we could
talk a minute. Sure.
What do you want to talk about: Ecology,
the political scene, stock market? No.
Hello, Napoleon. Hi, gertrude. 
Napoleon, huh?
Yeah. What's your name?
Daniel Arlington Williams III,
but you can just call me
Danny, all right? Okay.
What are we gonna talk about?
Well,
I wondered if you
wanted to work for me.
Well, that all depends. You think
you can afford my services?
I don't know.
How much does that...
Thomas's organization... 
whatever it is... cost?
It's a book.
Costs about, oh, $4.50.
I have that much. Did you
come by that honestly? 
Yeah, it's mine.
Will you work for me?
Okay. What do you
want me to do?
It's a secret. You gotta
promise not to tell anybody.
I promise. I cross my heart.
I promise.
Well,
I want you to help me
bury my grandpa.
Now, I'd like you
to tell me again...
Exactly what your grandfather
said about your Uncle and...
What's that?
Oh, that's major, my lion.
It's time for his milk.
Your lion.
Then my grandpa said he didn't want
anything like a fancy funeral.
He just wanted to be buried
up there on our hill,
where we used to go
and watch the sunset.
I guess a man can have his own private
burying grounds if he wants to.
The thing is,
we can't keep it a secret.
Just until my Uncle gets here.
Else they'll take major
away from me for sure.
Yeah, I guess they would.
Well, we'll need
some wood and tools.
Danny? Yeah?
Be nice if we could be
ready by sunset.
Okay.
For everything has a season...
And a time for every purpose.
A time to be born
and a time to die.
And as the setting sun...
Comes to rest
on this beautiful day,
so rests our friend peacefully
in the arms of mother earth.
Now like the sun
that has set...
So it can rise again, 
so rests our friend, that
he can rise in a new life. 
We shouldn't feel sorrow... 
For the setting sun,
nor should we cry
for our lost friend.
I think that's all.
Napoleon, you have anything
you want to say?
Thanks, Danny.
Grandpa,
I love you.
You know something? Hmm?
I'm having second thoughts this
morning about the whole thing.
What's the matter?
I can't go.
I mean, I can't just take off
and leave you here alone.
I told you I'll be all right
until my Uncle gets here.
That's another thing. This whole
Uncle business sounds pretty iffy.
Now, what happens
if he doesn't get here?
You sure there's no place
you can reach him now?
Uhuh. He's...
he's on his way here.
Must be Sam for school.
Come on in, Sam.
Hi, Napoleon. Hi, Danny.
Hiya, Sam. How ya
feelin' this morning?
Fine, thanks. Good. Why don't
you sit down and join us?
Napoleon, according
to what you've told me,
your Uncle should be here
by the end of the week, right?
Okay, I'll stay here
until then.
Oh, but I'll be all right
on my own.
Why don't you come and stay at my house?
Can he do that?
Sure he could. There's just me and gertrude.
My folks are away.
Well, that's the answer.
I mean, now I can go back
to the cabin without worrying.
I'll bet it's neat up
there in the mountains.
Beautiful.
Hey, do you think maj and me can
come up and stay with you someday?
Of course you can.
You too, Sam. Come up.
We'll have a big picnic. You can bring maj.
Got lots of milk for maj.
What's this for?
Show us where ya live.
Well, I live right...
right... there.
That's 14 Miles straight across
the mountains from here.
That's two valleys, three ridges, some of
the roughest country you've ever seen.
That's definitely not the way.
Bet I could make it.
Forget it.
What you have to do is...
You take the highway right here 
up to pinewood junction. 
Now a guy named gypsy's
got a service station there.
He lends me his shack. I take
care of his sheep and goats.
Anyway, you just ask gypsy, and he'll take
you up the back road in his jeep, all right?
Okay.
Let's not wait for any social calls.
You know what I mean, Napoleon? If
anything goes wrong... anything...
you find gypsy,
and he'll get in touch with me.
Okay, but nothin's
gonna go wrong.
Will you be comin'
back here soon, Danny?
Yeah, I should be back
in a couple of weeks.
When your Uncle arrives, you'll
tell him everything, okay?
All right.
Goodbye, Danny.
Goodbye, Danny.
See you soon. Bye.
See ya! Bye.
Will you, Napoleon?
Will I what?
Come and stay with us.
No, I gotta stay here and take care of maj.
Like right now.
I swear,
that grandfather of yours.
He's comin' into
his second childhood.
First milk baths,
then stuffin' himself
with candy.
No wonder he's feelin' poorly.
You tell him I'm comin' down
to see him tonight.
Oh, oh, you can't do that.
Why can't I do that?
I been comin' to see your grandpa
regular since before you were born.
Well, he...
because he's gonna be out tonight, that's why.
Then I'll see him tomorrow.
Maybe Mr. Gutteridge
won't come tomorrow.
Of course he will.
He and my grandpa
were best friends.
What if Danny won't let ya
stay with him?
He will,
when I tell him that...
I don't have an Uncle and all.
I still think you oughta
find gypsy like Danny said.
Oh, sure. And take maj
on the bus with me.
No, sir.
I'm gonna hike right over those
mountains, just like Danny does.
Sure wish I could go with ya.
See if you can do it.
I can't. I'll be right back.
Well, if you're gonna take
doodledoo with you,
you can't put him
in the knapsack.
Of course not, ya nut.
He's for you.
Oh, Napoleon,
you shouldn't have.
I love him.
Would you like me to come and
feed your other chickens?
No, I'm gonna turn them loose.
Well,
I better get home.
Goodbye, Napoleon.
I really wouldn't mind
goin' with ya.
I mean, if you're
afraid or anything.
Afraid? Why would I be afraid?
I mean, I've got maj
with me, haven't I?
Afraid.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Napoleon.
What are you doin' here?
I'm comin' with ya.
No, you're not.
What about gertrude?
She'll be all right.
What do you mean,
she'll be all right?
I left her a note. Said I was gonna stay with
you and your grandpa for a couple of days.
Please, Napoleon.
I want to be with you.
You'll get scared.
No, I won't! Not with you
and maj to protect me.
Well... 
okay. But you gotta promise
never to cry.
I promise.
Okay. Come on.
Napoleon!
Napoleon! 
Napoleon, help! 
What? What's wrong? 
Napoleon, look!
Oh, no. Go get him, maj! 
Go get him! 
Go get him, maj!
Get him, maj.
Come on. Fly, doodledoo. 
Go on, get out of here!
Get out of here! Hey! 
Go on, get!
That a boy, maj.
You really showed him.
Here, doodledoo. Here, boy.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, boy. There. 
Good boy. He's okay.
Just a little scared. There.
What are ya shakin' for?
I thought it was gonna
get me, Napoleon. I...
don't worry. Nothin's gonna get
ya as long as maj is around.
Here.
I'll give him some of my sandwich.
He loves it.
Why won't he come?
'Cause he's a cat.
Cats don't like water.
Oh! That's a good boy, major!
Oh, major. Whoa.
Oh, major.
Golly.
If he doesn't like water,
what does he do when it rains?
Gets wet.
Napoleon.
I don't like to complain,
but... my foot hurts.
I'm tired. I know.
I was gonna stop for the night as soon as I
could find a good place to build a leanto.
Hey, wait just a second.
Hey!
Hey, you know somethin'? There's
a barn just over the hill.
We can spend the night there.
We gotta be careful
nobody sees us. Come on.
Come on, major. Come on.
There's nobody there.
Come on. Let's go.
It's nice.
I'm glad we found it.
Yeah, it's okay for tonight.
Here you go, doodle.
You'll love it here.
It's not here.
What's not there?
Pinewood junction.
I'm looking for
the back road...
That leads from gypsy's...
Up to Danny's place.
It's just not here.
Well, sure you got
the right map?
Of course I'm sure.
We can't see anything at night.
I'll look for it
in the morning.
'Night. 'Night, maj. 'Night.
Napoleon, are... are you scared?
No.
Don't you ever get scared?
What's there to be scared about?
Lots of things.
Like what? The dark.
Now, the dark
never hurt anybody.
Things in the dark.
Things like what?
Things that jump out
and scare ya.
That's all in your imagination.
Still scares me.
Now that's kinda dumb.
I mean, my grandpa said that...
People just make things up in
their mind to be scared about.
Now go to sleep.
How do you make it work? It's easy.
All you have to do is squeeze it.
Don't squeeze it too hard,
or she'll kick ya.
Hey, it works.
I'm glad we decided to leave him there.
He seems a lot happier.
Yeah, doodle always liked
to be with hens. Come on.
It's gettin' awful steep. 
I told ya: Just don't
look down, and hang on.
Napoleon, look at him.
Aw, maj. Now that's no place to lie down.
Now get up.
I feel like I'm gonna slip.
What am I gonna do?
Can't you kinda inch...
inch around him?
I can't.
Well, climb right over top of him
and put your foot right there. 
He's just a little scary,
but don't worry.
Give me your hand.
Come on. Now, jump.
Got ya.
Okay, there's a...
there's a little spot.
Now stay there.
Stay there. Stay.
What are we gonna do
with him, Napoleon?
We gonna have to
get him goin' again.
Oh, major.
Major! Go, major!
Go!
Major, go on! Major!
Napoleon! 
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Napoleon.
Oh.
Napoleon!
Don't get scared.
Just... just let me think.
I know.
Throw major's rope down to me.
Maybe it'll reach.
There. Okay.
Pull me up, maj! Pull me up!
Here, major. Here, major!
Come on, major. Good boy.
Come on, major. Pull.
That's it, maj.
That's it. Pull!
Pull! Come on, major. 
Pull! Pull me up!
Okay. Made it.
Thanks, major. Thanks a lot.
II didn't think anything
was gonna happen to her.
I thought she was spending the night
with a boy and his grandfather.
That's what she wrote
in the note.
You read it yourself. Yes, ma'am. Did
she spend most of her time here?
With Napoleon, yeah.
Yeah. Now you say...
The last time you saw the boy, he was
walkin' down the street with a strange man?
Kind of a hippie type, you say?
That's right.
Now he's the one you should
be checking on right now!
Excuse me, uh, chief.
Oh.
It's too bad you
don't like water.
It makes your feet
feel real nice.
Sam!
A bear! 
Sam! Sam!
Get out of here! 
Sam! Sam! 
It's a bear, maj!
Come on, major, it's a bear!
Come on.
Napoleon, he won't budge! 
Sam! 
Get up! Major!
Come on.
Major, get up! It's a bear!
Don't just stand there
drinkin' your milk!
Get up, major! Move!
It's a bear! 
Major! 
Go get him! Good! Good! Go get him!
Good! Go get him!
Come on.
Get him, major! Go away, bear!
Major, go get him!
Sock it to him! Come on!
Oh!
Good boy. Good boy, major.
Oh, major, you saved us.
He sure beat up that old bear.
Aw, he's so strong.
That's why they call him
king of beasts. Yeah!
Napoleon, wait.
Just try and imagine
somethin' nice in your mind.
It'll stop you thinkin'
about being tired.
All I can think about
is sittin' down.
I'll bet we'll be able to see Danny's
cabin from the top of this hill.
Chocolate cake with...
Strawberry ice cream...
And marshmallows with whipped
cream and... cherries.
Cake, apple pie.
Chocolate syrup.
There's nothing.
Hey, now you promised
you wouldn't do that.
I know, but... 
My feet hurt,
and I wish my mom and dad
were here, and...
Napoleon, do you think
we're gonna die?
Die? Of course not.
I know exactly
where we are... almost.
Okay. See those
mountains over there?
Well, those are these here.
We oughta be
right about... here.
But...
They have a lake right here.
I don't see a lake
around here? Do you?
Napoleon, we're lost.
Now what are we gonna do?
Well, maybe we are
a little lost right now.
But you know, 
we could just stay here for weeks
and weeks and live off the land.
Just like the Indians. 
Could we do that?
Sure.
You're so good at everything.
I mean it.
I really admire you.
I'm sorry I was crying.
That's okay. Girls can't
help it all the time.
Now you just stay here
and rest.
I'm gonna go on a hunting trip.
Hey, you can't
leave me here alone.
Well, maj is with ya.
Well, you'll be right
back, won't ya? Sure.
I'll bring back some food too.
Got him!
Oh! Got him. Ah.
Shoot.
Hmm? Just me.
Did you get anything?
Yeah. What'd you get?
Eeew. What is it?
Snails. I found them under
a rock next to the river.
You eat 'em? Sure.
People eat 'em all the time. 
They're really special. 
They look horrible.
Let me see you eat one.
No, I've already had mine.
I'm not hungry anymore.
I would have rather
have had fish.
Oh, well, I caught one,
but I decided to let it go.
But these are better
for you anyway.
Well... no, that's okay.
I... I guess I'm not
very hungry anymore either.
Did you see anything? No.
I'm gonna go on a
scouting trip right now.
I'm gonna find out
where we are.
Napoleon. Don't worry.
Maj is here with ya.
I'm just gonna go over
to the next Ridge.
I'll bet that's where Danny's
place is, okay? Okay.
Good.
Major! Now you sit down!
Do you hear me?
Major, where are you going? 
Come back here. Napoleon!
Major!
What's gotten into you anyway?
You wanna get us more lost?
Napoleon!
Napoleon!
Danny!
Danny! 
Danny!
It's me, Napoleon! 
Hey! Hey, Napoleon! Hey!
We're coming to visit you!
Danny!
Danny! Danny, we found you!
Danny, I'm so glad we found ya.
You crazy kids.
How'd you get here?
Over the mountains.
Over the mount...
do you know how lucky you are? I
could've been 100 Miles from here.
Well, we were attacked by a bear and
a Mountain lion, and we got lost.
Now wait a minute.
What happened?
What about your Uncle
and your parents?
Danny,
could we have something to eat?
And some milk for maj?
Sure. Okay.
But I wanna hear the
whole story, all right?
You should have told me
the truth about your Uncle.
You mean you have no idea
where he is now?
Well, why can't I come up
and live with you, Danny?
Because it's not that simple.
For one thing, Samantha's here.
Gertrude's probably got in touch with your family by now.
Can you imagine how they feel?
I only wanted to help Napoleon get here.
I was gonna go home after that.
Right, right. But in the
meantime, they're worried sick.
It's all right to do your own thing, but when
somebody gets hurt, that's something else. 
Well, I'm not gonna live
in town anymore.
And if you don't want me, 
me and maj'll just go live up with
the Indians like my grandpa did.
Napoleon, it's not a game.
Now, I'd like ya here.
It's just not possible.
I really don't wanna go back
to any dumb old orphanage.
Orphanage?
Yeah, he's scared of orphanages.
Orphanage is like...
it's a dirty word you read in storybooks.
They're not like that.
Look, there's a lot of kids like you, all right?
And that's too bad. 
But there's also 
good, kind people... 
Who gather you together and
make a family and a nice home.
A place where everybody has
friends, and you play games.
And you get an education.
School?
Look, don't knock it. Without
education, you're nothing.
You get an education, 
you can do anything you want. 
And the thing you should want to
do most right now is be useful.
You know what I mean by being useful?
I think so.
Danny, are you useful?
Well, um... no, I wouldn't say
I'm useful, not right now, but...
well, I do other things around
here besides tend goats, you know?
I, uh, I think,
study and... I'll get
my master's degree soon.
What's that? Never mind. 
The point is that if I can still
go to school, so can Napoleon.
And then later on, you can be with the Indians,
a sea captain, a cowboy, anything you want.
But what about maj?
Major can stay here with me, and you can
come up and visit him when you want.
All right? 
Well, I don't know, Danny.
Napoleon. 
Can I think about it?
Yeah. Sure. You think about it.
Danny, what about me?
You.
Right after supper,
I'll head into town, and
catch a nap on the way.
In the morning
I'll talk to gertrude,
and we'll get the whole thing
straightened out, all right?
Are we going with ya?
No, sir. No way. 
I think once across 
the mountains is enough. 
Besides, I got a babysitter for ya.
A babysitter! 
Yeah. His name's mark. 
Came out of nowhere a few
days ago, just like you. 
Well, where is he? 
I don't know. 
He's probably in the woods. He spends a lot
of time there. I think you'll like him. 
He's kinda quiet. 
There is...
Mark, you look like
you just saw a lion.
Don't worry about it. 
He's as tame as a pussycat. Belongs
to the two kids. He's really tame.
His name's major.
Come here, major!
I'll introduce you to him. 
Here, major! 
Hi, mark.
Yes, what? Good morning.
My name is Danny...
hey! 
Lady, if you're gertrude, 
I have to talk to you. 
Jjust a minute.
I'm alone in the house.
II have to put on a robe.
Uh, you stay right there. Okay. 
Hello, police?
Lady?
It's important. 
It's about Samantha. 
Gertrude, she's all right.
Can you hear me? She's okay. 
I came by to tell you that. 
Hello?
All right, mister,
take it easy.
What's goin' on? Come on.
Up against the door.
What? You're under arrest.
What'd I do?
"You have the right
to remain silent.
"If you give up the right to remain silent,
anything you say can and will be used... 
"Against you in a court of law.
Fellas, you got the wrong guy.
You have the right to speak to an attorney and to
have attorney present during all questioning."
Now wait a minute. Okay.
Come on. Let's go.
That's him!
He's the one, all right!
What did you do with them?
Where are those poor children?
I've been trying to tell you,
they're okay.
They're up in my cabin. If you
let me explain and listen to me.
The chief'll do all
the listening and the talking.
You just take it easy and don't
cause any trouble, okay?
Gertrude! Is he the one? 
He certainly is!
And if he's harmed
one hair on her head, I'll...
iva, will you drive me
to the police station?
Indeed I will.
Let me get the car.
Okay, give me five minutes.
That all you got? That's all.
The chief'll be here in a few minutes.
His wife said he was on his way.
All right, Pete,
get him printed.
Come on, this way.
See if there's a make on him.
Right hand first.
Are the kids all right?
Where'd they catch him? 
Come on, gertrude. You step
right up and tell them! 
Well, did you get it
out of him?
Where are they?
All right, quiet down, 
everybody. 
I wanna know where Samantha is!
Lady. Gertrude.
Gertrude, I keep telling
everybody, but nobody's listening. 
The kids are up at my cabin.
They're fine.
I don't know what all
this hassle's all about.
Look, fella,
two kids have disappeared.
An old man lies dead and buried
in his own backyard.
And you were there, right?
Right.
So you got a lot of questions
to answer, so take it easy.
All right. Come on, Pete.
Stay out of it.
Let the chief handle it. Come on, everybody.
Let's move it.
I'm not going anywhere until I know
Samantha's safe. And neither am I!
All right, you. Come on.
Sit down over here.
You know, you guys
are really beautiful.
All you have to do is send somebody up to the cabin.
This whole mess'd be over.
Look, fella, if everything is as cool
as you say it is, there's no hurry.
So let's just wait till
the chief gets here, okay?
All right, all right. We'll do
everything by the book. That's right.
Hey, fella. Sit down. Wait a minute.
Look at this.
This guy, this psycho, he's up there with the kids.
Will you listen to me?
He's dangerous. It says it right here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What are you trying to pull? I'm telling
you the truth. We gotta get up there!
Will you let go of me and listen? 
Fella, take it easy!
Just wait till the chief gets
back, and we'll be all right.
Hey!
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Out of my way! Hey, watch it!
There he goes. I got him.
Get back inside.
Put out an a.P.B.
Take your car
and cover the other side.
Hey, buddy!
He's got my cycle. 
Hey, slow down, buddy! 
What are you doing? Get out of here! 
Whoa!
You harebrained punk! Look out! 
Oh, get out of here! 
Car two, repeat.
I don't read you.
He's on a cycle. He's
headed north on number 27.
Should we, uh, set a roadblock?
Over.
Uh, check and advise.
All right, see what you can find out about him.
Is that Pete? Yes, sir.
Car two, whatever you do,
don't take your eyes off him.
We'll set up a roadblock
at Dawson's Ridge. Roger.
Put Adams and susskind on it too.
Right.
This could turn out
to be a big deal.
If we lose sight of him now, he could
take off anywhere up there in the brush.
Do you want me to call
the state patrol? Yeah. 
And, uh, chief Thomas
at carsonville.
Let's get everybody on it. Notify the airport.
Get a copter ready for me.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Okay.
H.C.G. 440, this is 22. Request copter.
Stand by. 
Slow down! Slow down! Hey!
Hey, fella! 
Hey, what do you think 
this is, a racetrack? 
Nut!
Get that dozer out of the way!
Hey, what's goin' on?
There he goes.
Look out!
Are you okay? 
I don't know. Why don't you 
guys learn to drive that thing? 
A jeep. Let's take it. 
Hey, where you going 
with my jeep? 
Don't worry about it.
Easy. Easy. Take it away.
Oh! Hey, you! Hey, you!
Come back here! 
Go ahead. Go ahead. Look out!
Go get him, boys.
Right through here.
Up there!
Okay, we've got you. Go ahead.
Chief, Mike. Yeah?
About the escaped psycho,
he's a Lulu.
Just give it to me straight!
Yes, sir.
He escaped ten days ago.
He used to live in carsonville, so he
could be in our area. Over and out.
How do you like that? The
guy was tellin' the truth.
He sure was. Hey, look!
He didn't want us to nail him
till he got us up here.
Take her down quick. Close
to the cabin. Right.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Hi, Danny. 
Hi, Dan.
What's all the noise about?
Sounds like a helicopter
or something.
Where did mark go? 
You kids all right? Sure. 
Hey, it was a helicopter,
wasn't it?
Yeah.
What's been going on here?
Just a game.
Then all the noise and mark ran out
like he was scared or something.
We were his prisoners,
and he was a wicked giant.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Nothing's wrong, is it, Danny?
Everything's gonna be all right.
Sam, look. It's the police.
What are they doing with mark? 
Are they taking him to jail?
No, they're just taking him
to a hospital.
A hospital? Yes.
You see, mark's been sick.
The hospital thinks it's better
if he came back with them.
Gosh! He sure
didn't look sick to me.
You know, he was the best
giant I ever played with.
Goodbye, mark! 
You mean, we get to ride back in a helicopter?
That's what I said.
But the lion'll have to stay up here
with you, for this trip anyway.
No. No more. Thank you.
You sure?
We got through
to Samantha's parents.
They'll be at the airport. Good.
They're home! Napoleon!
Next time you're in town,
stop by my office.
I'll serve the coffee. Okay.
Danny! Napoleon,
he's run away again!
What?
See. There he goes.
Let me see. 
Maybe I can handle it. 
Okay.
Napoleon!
Where ya goin'?
I thought we had a deal.
No. I just said
I'd think it over, Danny.
I decided...
I better go live
with the Indians...
On account of major and all.
There aren't
any Indians around here.
Not anymore. 
Yes, there are. I'll show ya.
Just over this Mountain.
Boy, it's a big world, huh? 
Nobody can make it alone.
We all need people to help us.
Mark needs people
to help him, and they will.
You'll need people to help you. 
Trust them, Napoleon.
Trust me.
Danny.
Well, about the Indians...
well... 
I meant over the next Mountain.
Come on. Hurry up, maj!
