Man's voice: One, two, three. 
 You can't sit around waiting
for the path to glory 
 you've got to get moving
to tell your story 
 the bigger they come,
the harder they fall 
 from the littlest acorns
come trees so tall 
 and where you're coming from
is where you're going 
 until you get there
you got no way of knowing 
 all the love in the world 
 won't find you
if you don't let it 
 let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride 
 and every mistake is a break
but only if you get it 
 let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride 
 And all the love
in the world 
 won't find you
if you don't let it 
 let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride 
 and every mistake is a break
but only if you get it 
 let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride 
 Every day
is a brandnew place 
 Feel the sun upon your face 
 try something new 
 you won't regret it 
 the hole in your shoe 
 buddy, just forget it 
whoo! Heyhey!
 Let it ride 
 oh, you got to let it... 
stage dive, stage dive, stage dive.
 let it ride, let it ride 
whoa!  Let it ride 
 let it ride 
 oh, you got to let it 
 let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride. 
whoa, oh!
Hey!
 Let it ride 
ohho.
Vroom!
 Let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride 
 let it ride 
 oh, you got to let it 
 let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride. 
Yeah!
The country bears
officially broke up
after the '91 hibernation tour.
It's actually hard to imagine
popular music without the bears.
I learned a lot from those guys
and that was why I was so sad
to see them break up.

I guess I miss the old days
at country bear hall.
We was kinda...
Different, you see?
And, uh, at country bear hall
you could be different
and still fit in.
Yup. Different. Mmhmm.
Hey, beary.
Doofus, it's time for dinner.
Sit down, Dex.
Okay, that's enough,
that's enough.
Napkin's not a toy, Dex.
I'm really not that hungry.
Mom?
Am I adopted?
Well... of course not, honey.
Eat your fish.
Yes, you are.
Um... why would you
think that, beary?
I don't know.
Sometimes I feel... Different.
Like Dex and me.
We don't look the same.
Our eyes are different colors
and he has freckles,
and I don't.
I think.
Are you serious?
That's why you think
you're different?
You know, um...
Last week it was "casual
Friday" at the office
and I guess I forgot
and I wore a tie.
And boy...
Did I feel different!
It was...
Yeah.
The point is
that it's not unusual
to feel different
and...
Those differences
always lead us
to our higher purpose.
Higher purpose?
Honey, even if you were adopted
we would love you
as much as we love Dexter.
Maybe more.
Just remember, son
the people who love
you no matter what...
That's your family.
Okay.
I'm going to go practice.
Did you know
the bears made
the only country song
ever go be recorded in Polish?!
Whoa! Really?!
And did you know
that nobody cares?
Way to go, doofus.
You're, like, totally wrecking
this family.
Um, what are you talking about?
You really want to know
what I'm talking about?
Okay, this is my baby picture.
This is yours.
Yeah?
See this?
This is my birth certificate.
Here's yours.
The rangers used this
to track you.
So... what's your point?
Forget it.
That?
That's the day
mom and dad got you.
What do you mean...
"Got me"?
I mean, picked you up, man.
You were left alone.
They brought you home,
they showed you
a bunch of Barney videos
and they pretended
you were their son.
You don't belong here.
At country bear hall
you could be different
and still fit in.
Yup. Different.
 Sometimes
it's just the goin' 
 you've got to go 
 and you don't even know
if it's the right thing to do 
 nobody else can be showin' 
 which way to go 
 and you're not even sure
of where you're goin' to 
 but it's a start 
 in your heart 
 Sometimes
it's just the goin'... 
Country bear hall!
Wow!
Whoa! Hey! Uh...
25 cents?!
Do you have change
for a hundred?
Hello, Reed.
I thought
you weren't coming back
until you could
tear the place down.
That's a whole
four days away, Henry.
The people
that owned the bank before you
wouldn't mind
if I got behind in my payments
a month or two.
They'd cut me some slack.
Uhhuh. How far behind
are you right now?
Uh... six...
Years.
Six years?
Must be tough.
You had a good run, Henry
but good things must come
to an end, luckily.
That also applies
to lame junkie things
like country bear hall.
Do you like the sound
of crunching wood?
I do.
Oh, like that's going to help.
Brother...
If you're going to stand there
you might as well
give me a hand.
What's that?
A sign.
Yeah, but... "Destroy"?
Right.
Well...
They're going to tear down
country bear hall.
Tear down country bear hall?
Yeah.
Tear down country bear hall?!
Uh...
Yeah.
Sir, officer hamm.
And officer cheets.
Hamm and cheets?
Yeah.
Wwe get that all the time.
Well, it's your name.
Mmhmm. Uhhuh.
I thought you
officers might enjoy
a little nibble of something.
Ah...
When I'm upset, I bake.
Please help yourself!
Okay, um... About your boy...
Um, his name is beary.
"Bar..."
No, it's "bear"
like in...
The German spelling
of the name.
Oh, man, are you kidding me?!
Don't worry, young buck.
We'll find your
brother for you.
Here now.
There we go.
Now you're an honorary deputy.
Gee, thanks.
I'm sure all the kids
on the playground
will be really impressed.
Yeah, well, don't
arrest anybody.
Yeah, this place would
fill up every weekend night. 
Really?
I tell you, a lot of great
music was on that stage.
There's flat and scruggs,
liver lips McGraw, gomer.
Jimi Hendrix opened here
for vanilla fudge.
But nobody, but nobody was
like the country bears.
Huh! Place would be packed...
people sitting everywhere
even up in the rafters.
You know, sometimes
I'd climb up there
just to hear the notes.
What notes?
The music.
The millions of notes
that floated up there...
Some of the best
darn notes ever.
Well, why don't you stop them
before they start
to tear the place down?
Why?
$20,000, that's why.
You don't got it,
I don't got it.
Goodbye, country bear hall.
I can't raise
that kind of cash.
Four days from now, this
place comes atumbling down.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I got it!
I heard that some people
have a higher purpose in life.
Well.
I belong here.
I belong here helping
you save this place.
Nah.
And we can do it with a
concert to raise the money.
We can get the band
back together!
Get the band back to...!
Uhhuh.
Get the... get the...!
Oh, that's the stupidest thing.
Never in a million years.
But this place... it's historic.
No.
The notes in the rafters.
No! I know they'll do it.
Oh, come on now.
They could play a show.
Now, stop it, okay?
Just forget it. Stop it.
But wait, you're not...
I said stop!
It's over.
Uh...
Dumb kid.
Stupid idea.
Get the band back together.
You could do that.
Oh, look, even if we
found them, uh...
A concert?
Yeah, you need equipment
and tickets and promotion
and... everything.
I don't know.
I could do that.
Oh, Al.
Look, let's face it.
In a week from now,
some teenager's
going to be teaching us
how to operate a deep fryer.
We could do that.
Does he have
any distinguishing marks
something that we can
recognize him by?
Yeah.
He's got thick brown hair...
All over his body.
Uh, you know, I think I may have
a recent photograph of him
ifif that would help you out.
Oh... he looks like a...
Fourth grader?
That's right. Yeah.
Cutie pie.
Okay, you know what?
I'm going to go to my room now
and, uh, I'm going to
stay there till I'm 18.
Okay, we're all done here.
Are you going to find him?
Ma'am, we're going
to do more than that.
How are we going
to do more than that?
Huh?
What are we going to do,
find him twice?
All right.
Let's get mobile.
 There's a town down the road 
 where I ain't been before 
 Nobody knows my name 
 or what I'm looking for 
 Maybe things will be
a little different 
 'cause it can't
stay the same... 
 I'm gonna ease
on down the road 
hmm?
 Where nobody knows my name 
 If they think about me
tonight 
 I know
they won't miss the pain 
 'cause I'll be taking it
down the road 
 where nobody knows my name 
 yeah. 
uh...
Hey.
Henry?
Uh, well, if we're going
to get the band back together
we're going to need
some transportation.
Hey, beary, meet roadie.
Hi.
Have you seen my chicken?
Uh, no.
Big Al: Get off my grass.
He was making a mess
on my grass.
I'm sorry, big Al.
Yeah.
Peace.
The original
country bear tour bus.
Whoa.
Wow.

Oh, yeah, pretty neat, huh?
Uhhuh. Wow.
Hey, uh...
Get the place ready
for the concert, big Al.
I'm counting on you.
Let's hit it, roadie.
Don't you worry
about nothing, Henry.
You just go get them boys.
Oh, and be careful of my...
Grass.
 So you want to be
a rock 'n' roll star 
 then listen now
to what I say 
 just get an electric guitar 
 and take some time
and learn how to play 
 and in a week or two,
if you make the charts 
 the girls
will tear you apart... 
So, is Fred still
in show business?

Yeah, you could say that.
Hey, Fred.
Morning.
How's it going, Fred?
Okay.
Excuse me.
Sorry, got to be part
of the video shoot.
I kind of am the video shoot.
Hmm?
Oh, krystal, hey, sorry.
I am so happy to see you.
Uh, really?
Could you help me get my stuff?
Yeah.
What you been up to?
Uh, not much.
Playing my harmonica.
Really? You play?
Oh, yeah. I was a country...
Bear.
The "Fred"?
Wait, wait,
you're Fred bedderhead?
Fred from the country bears?
Yeah.
And didn't you invent
the stage dive?
Oh, yeah, but I'm
too old for that now.
You're not too old.
You should play with us.
Huh? Come on, Fred.
Come on.
Show us what you got.
Well... all right, I suppose.
Yeah.
 Better call my sister 
 tell her how much I miss her 
 tell my brother
to come home, too 
 apple of my eye is humming 
 that drummer is drumming 
 singing, singing
a song for you 
 just when you think 
 there ain't no kitchen sink

Wow, look! There he is.

 I'm gonna bring it out, yeah 
 the kid in me

stage dive, stage dive,
stage dive.
Whoo!
Ooh!
Oh, Fred.
Hey, Fred, you all right?
Uh...
Uh, the dive works better...
Yeah, with an audience, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, if you're all right
I gotta go get ready
for the shoot.
Okay.
It was fun. Sure was.
Wish I could play some more.
I might be able to
help you out with that.
Huh? Henry?
Get the band back together?
You can do it.
You're Fred bedderhead
the amazing, worldfamous
Fred bedderhead.
The Fred bedderhead.
Uh, who is this guy?
Oh, that's beary,
and he's right.
How you going to get people
to come to the show, hen?
Why don't you call
rip Holland, hen?
Rip Holland?
The guy who stole
the band from me?
Call rip, yeah.
Rip Holland.
Uh, rip?
Henry?
Yeah.
Oh, hey, how you doing, buddy?
Long time, no talk, huh?
So, are you nearby?
Uh, the boys and I are putting
on this reunion show
at bear hall
this Saturday night.
Oh, I get it, I get it.
You just called to gloat.
Well, you listen to me...
Oh, no, no, no, rip, rip, rip.
I called...
'Cause I thought we could put
aside the old stuff, and, uh...
Well, I was hoping you could
promote the show.
I don't know, but let me
check my calendar.
Well, it's going to be a squeeze
but I think a little juggling
I can fit it in.
Well, that's great.
Well, okay, this Saturday night
at 8:00, then.
You got it, Henry.
I am so back, baby!
Excuse me, sir.
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you.
You're going to have
to leave the store.
Yeah, right, like I need you.
Do you know who I am?
I'm rip Holland... rip Holland.
That's ours.
Right.
You know, Fred, you were
the only one who ever wrote me.
You know where
any of the other boys are?

Zeb never gave up the honey.
Hangs out at a bar
in nuttville.
Oh, that's a nice scrapbook
there, beary.
Thanks.
I've been working
on it forever.
I really like
this picture.
You used to have a lot of hair.
Uh... yeah, well...
Oh, look at this one.
Winning that talent show
was our big break.
What's an "arm musician"?
That's Benny bogswaggle.
He was real talented.
But he was a bad loser.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He hit zeb with a chair.
What's that?
That there's a sign.
I'm aware of that.
"Reunion benefit concert."
Uh, watch the grass.
Where's Henry?
In the bears bus,
picking up the band.
You mean, he's...
He's not actually serious.
Oh, yeah.
Even got
rip Holland to promote it.
Rip Holland? Really?
You bet.
Uh, come here.
You see, Henry says
we do this here concert,
and we raise
that $20,000
we could tell that
little weasel banker to, uh...
Oops.
Tell the weasel what?
Uh...
Uh, over yonder...
a monkey.
Hey.
I'm chubby, but I'm quick.
Rip Holland...
 You told me, baby,
one more time 
 you don't wanna sit
all alone and cry 
 well, it's over 
 I can't let go 
 I'm like a fish out of water 
 a cat in a tree 
 you'll be the one
on top of me 
 well, it's over 
 I can't let go 
 he won't play me back
when I come around... 
this way.
 I got a big chain
around my neck 
 I'm rollin' down
like a train wreck...
uh, excuse me, miss.
Yeah?
Uh, would you happen
to know if there's
a zeb zoober here?
Zeb zoober? Yeah.
The zeb zoober
that sleeps on my floor?
The zeb zoober
that owes me $500?
The zeb zoober that won't stop
calling me chacha?
Set me up, chacha!
Sounds like him.
Zeb zoober.
I can't get rid of zeb zoober.
Hey, there, zeb.
Henry?
Fred?
Is that you?
Now, come on, zeb,
what do you say?
You give up the honey
and come with us, hmm?
Guys, even if I wanted
to leave town, I couldn't.
I owe chacha over there
a lot of money.
I'm hungry.
Want to split an order
of salmon fingers?
Oh, Fred.
How about twigs and berries?
Excuse me, ma'am.
What's that boy doing?
I don't know.
Okay, it's a deal.
You're zeb zoober.
Yeah, well, that may be true
but, II...
Who is this guy?
Well, that's beary.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen
can I have your attention
here for a minute?
Now, as most of you know
zeb zoober owes me
a whole heap of money.
But his little friend there
has proposed a wager.
My house band
versus zeb's fiddle
in a little musical duel.
Now, if he wins,
he owes me nothing
but if he loses, I get to keep
the country bear tour bus.
What? This should be good.
Son, that bus is our only
means of transportation.
Not to mention
that's where I raised my kids.
Plus, I don't think
you've all seen the house band.
 Hey, there, bear, I know
you'd like a little honey 
 but your credit's no good,
man, you're out of money 
 I heard you can play
the fiddle with the best 
 well, I'm here
aputtin' you to the test 
 I'm hereby challenging you
to a duel 
 'tween my guitar
and your fiddle 
 you fuzzy fool 
That's my guy.
 Well, hey, there, mister,
that was pretty good 
 for a local bartender
in the neighborhood 
 well, I'm a little rusty, now,
I admit 
 but I ain't afraid of you,
not one bit 
 I hereby accept
your challenge to a duel 
 your guitar and my fiddle,
you crazy fool 
 I'm only in it for the honey 
 it makes my head
feel kind of funny 
 gimme that golden nectar
straight from the bees 
 bartender, gimme some of that,
please 
Yay!
You better call a cab.
 Ouch, hey, there, Mr. Fuzzy 
 well, I guess
that settles that 
 leave your tour bus
parked out front 
 and the keys under the mat 
 whoa, now, hold on
just a minute 
 hold that jive 
 'cause I can feel
this fiddle 
 'bout to come alive 
Back off, sunshine!
Gettin' better.
Go, zeb!
Yeah, go, zeb!
Whoohoo!
All right, zeb.
That's my zeb!
Yeah!
 Broken lives 
 broken strings 
 broken threads 
 broken Springs 
 broken idols 
 broken heads 
 people sleeping 
 in broken beds 
 ain't no use jivin' 
 ain't no use jokin' 
 everything's broken... 
oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Country bear hall
has been crushed.
Oh, no!
Unit 2, this is dispatch.
We've got a disturbance up here
at the clubhouse.
We've got Oliver and wendall...
stuck their heads
in the fence again.
Can you get over here
right away, please? Over.
What is that?
That's a sign.
No, not that.
Is that Kentucky fescue?
Oh. Sure is.
Mmm. Beautiful.
Have you seen this boy?
Hmm.
Yup.
Only... in real life,
he's a lot bigger
and not all... tiny and flat
like that.
That's true.
Where is he?
Henry took him.
Henry took him?
In the bus with roadie.
Now, where can we find you?
Right here.
Or maybe over there
in a little while.
Sometimes I'm by that... tree.
Well, thank you very much.
You bet.
So, what do you think,
kidnapping?
Yep. Let's get mobile.
You know, would it kill you
just once
to say "let's get going,
partner"?
Mix it up a little bit?
They like you.
Uh, this is the harp
my daddy gave me.
Uh, uh, hey, zeb, zeb.
I was wondering.
What ever happened to Tennessee?
Saw him a few years ago.
He's still the same heartbroke
mixedup, psycho,
basket case crybaby.
So, what's he doing?
He's a marriage counselor.
Huh?
I'm tired!
I've been with the baby all day.
Look, I work all day.
I get a lot of stress
from my boss.
I come home,
I just want to relax.
Is that too much to ask?
I mean, what do you think?
What do I think?
I think you two are so dang
lucky to have each other.
Oh, I'm sure you might
fight over the dishes
but at the end of the day...
At least you're going
to be together.
Not like me.
Not like me and trixie!
Oh, I lost her!
Trixie!
Oh, sweetheart!
Oh, baby!
I'm okay.
Oh...
I feel better.
He's good.
Oh, trixie!
Oh, come in.
Huh?!
Don't tell me you're getting
the band back together.
Tennessee...
We're getting the
band back together.
I'm sorry, boys.
I just can't play the thing
not without trixie there. I...
Why'd she break up with you?
Was it that sweater
you're wearing?
Took off with some rich,
millionaire, real estate guy.
A panda!
What's with the pandas?
They get everything.
You're telling me.
You sure it wasn't
that sweater?
Zeb! Huh?
If I knew where she was
I'd be there in a second.
Ah, but even if I could play,
who'd come?
Nobody cares
about the country bears no more.
Nobody even knows who we are.
Hey, how's everybody doing?
Oh, my gosh.
You're the country bears.
Oh... you know who we are?
Sure. You guys inspired me
to go after my dream
to become a famous singer.
Did you make it?
Yeah, Fred, she made it.
She just works here
for the free uniform.
Sorry, no offense.
None taken.
I'm still working on it.
I even do one of your songs,
"kick it into gear."
 Kick it into gear 
 sometimes you just got to... 
That old thing?
Blow the dust off that one.
Well, I kind of got
my own arrangement.
 Sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear. 
Yeah.
Yeah!
Hey, come on. Sing it!
Come on!
 When your grip keeps slippin'
and your clutch is gone 
 And you're tired
of spinning your wheels 
 on your brain's front lawn 
 ooh, oohooh, ooh 
 well, keep your asphalt under,
sunny side up 
 a gas credit card
and a giant coffee cup 
 the rest of your life
is gonna find you here 
 get up on the highway
and kick it into gear 
 kick it into gear,
kick it into gear 
 that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here 
 kick it into gear 
 Kick it into gear 
 sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear 
Hey, I kind of like this song.
Yeah!
Yeah!
 Had some money
for a turbo drive 
 ooh, oohooh, ooh 
 well, it ain't
the destination 
 it's the ride, ride, ride 
 ooh, oohooh, ooh 
 put the heavy to the metal
and grab onto the road 
 I hear your motor runnin',
it's about to explode  yeah!
 Still be waitin'
this time next year 
 head on down the highway
and kick it into gear 
 kick it into gear,
kick it into gear 
 that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here 
 kick it into gear,
kick it into gear 
 sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear 
Oh!
Whoo!
 Oh, yeah 
 Kick it into gear,
kick it into gear 
 that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here 
 kick it into gear,
kick it into gear 
 So if you want to, yeah 
 kick it into gear,
kick it into gear 
 that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here 
 kick it into gear,
kick it into gear 
Whoooh!
 Sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear. 
Order up.
So, how do you boys
like your eggs?
Hot!
Like us.
Yeah. Yeah.
I guess people do remember us.
Yeah.
Yeah. Bears are even on TV.

Police believe this man...
Hmm? Huh? What?
...Is involved in the abduction
of this tenyearold boy.
That's you.
Police also believe
his accomplices are
this man, this man,
and this chicken
who are all traveling
in this bus.
We'll keep you updated
on bus watch!
Oh, no!
You guys are kidnappers? Huh?
Of course not, zeb.
Guys...
I think we have a problem.
Hmm? Huh? Hmm?
How many?
Two, please.
Right this way.
Ah! Here you go.
Suspicious activity at 2:00.
How could you possibly
know that?
Look.
Let's give 'em a...
Let's go.
 Gone in a breeze 
 I keep blowing down
the road... 
Pull over.
Pull over.
Pull over immediately or...
Uh... or...
Oror what?
Or we'll make you pull over.
Or we'll make you pull over.
Shake these fellas.
Shake 'em!
 Gone in a breeze 
 I keep blowing
down the road... 
Whoa!
 Well, now they're gone
in a breeze... 
whoa.
Whoa!
I'm scared.
All right, it's time
to lose these guys.
I need honey!
How about a little thing I call
"hiding in the car wash."
Uh, how's that work?
We hide in the car wash.
Oh.
Whoa.
I lost them.
What do you mean,

I can't see anything.
Can you see anything?
No, I can't.
Put your window down.
Do you think I should?

You, too, Mr. Chicken.
Whoohoohoo!
Whoohoohoohoo!
Whoohoo!
Hey, Dex, it's me... beary.
Beary? You are in
so much trouble.
It's kind of cool.
Are mom and dad, uh...
I mean,
Mr. And Mrs. Barrington there?
No! They're out looking
for you, doofus.
Oh, well, tell them I haven't
been kidnapped or anything
and I'm okay.
I figured out my higher purpose.
I'm getting
the country bears back together
for a concert on Saturday
at country bear hall.
No, you're not.
I don't care if you don't
believe me, but it's true.
I just wanted them to know
that I was okay.
Okay, you know, fine.
Just...
When are you coming home?
I'm not.
You're right, Dex.
I got to face facts.
We're different.
I don't belong there.
I never did.
Beary, what are you
talking about?
Dex, you can keep my game boy.
Beary?
Look, you're part of...
So long, country bears!
Whoa! What the...?
Look, he's shooting
a ray gun at us.
Come on. Let's run.
Fred, your harmonica
might disrupt
the aliens' brain waves.
Blow. Blow, Fred, blow!
Ah! That noise!
Bear power!
That was bad.
"Appearing tonight:
Trixie St. Claire"?
Oh, man!
Tennessee!
Tennessee, remember
when you said
you'd do anything
to find trixie?
To get her back?
Well, guess what?
Oh...
Thank you...
...for not listening.
Uh, well, I am.
Tennessee!
Uh...
Guys, listen up.
This next song was written
by an old friend of mine.
He wrote it a long time ago
when he was my...
...in a band
called the country bears.
Whoohoo!
Bears rock!
 Did I lose your love
a long time ago? 
 did I just wear it out? 
 baby, I don't know... 
Oh, trixie, I'm all
a mess on account
of how much I miss you.
I know...
Tennessee...
Ah...
 'Cause it seems like anymore 
 we're not on the same page 
 in the same book 
 or on the same stage 
 don't look at me
like I'm a stranger now 
 have I changed that much? 
 baby, tell me how 
 we said forever
and always for good... 
Oh, stop your blubbering, Fred.
I'm sorry.
 Can love stand the test 
 of time that surrounds us? 
 moments that astound us? 
 can love stand the test 
 of time that surrounds us 
 moments that astound us 
 joy and happiness 
 joy and happiness 
 joy and happiness. 
I think we just got Tennessee.
They're great.
They were always great.
Better than the eagles.
Yeah?
Uh, uh, yeah, uh...
Hello?
Ted? Ted, it's, uh, it's Henry.
Henry Taylor?
What do you want, Henry?
Yeah, well, uh,
well, Ted, look, uh
I'm sort of in a bind here,
and, uh, I was, uh, well...
Hey, hey, this is exciting!
Uh, we're getting the band back
together for a benefit show.
Great, huh?
What? Get the...
Get the band back together?
Yeahhuh.
I'm going in a tunnel.
I'm losing you.
Okay, Ted, good,
thank you very much.
Well?
Oh, he's in.
Whooeee! Razzledazzle!
Looks like old Ted's done
pretty good for hisself.
Yeah.
Why don't you just borrow
the $20,000 from him, man?
It don't look
like he'd miss it much.
Okay, guys
now, one thing at a time, okay?
Just one thing at a time.
Got to do everything here.
All right.
Hello? Hello, we're looking
for a Ted bedderhead.
Uh, two orders of French
fries and a shake.
Fred...
What?
Oh!
Uh, excuse me?
Excuse me?
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Ted bedderhead?
He's, uh, an old friend
of mine, um...
Is he here?
No, he's, uh, not here.
He's probably still at the
country club at the wedding.
Oh, yeah, country club.
Well, thank you.
You're the country bears, right?
Um... yeah. Yeah!
Well, I'm, uh...
Yeah, yeah, I know...
you're a big, big fan...
we get it all the time...
and that's real nice, young man,
but, uh, we got to run.
Thank you very much.
Come on, beary.
Come on, beary. Bye.
That guy looks a lot
like Elton John.
Nah, Elton John's taller.
Keep your eyes open
for some clues.
Uhhuh.
Uh, give me a minute, huh?
Yeah.
How's it look?
I'll find a mirror.
Ted may be a little
surprised to see us
so, uh, let me do the talking,
all right?
I thought you said
he knew we was coming.
Well, he does, but...
Let's not embarrass him
in front of his rich friends.
It wasn't me.
It was the chicken.
Come on, Fred.
Let's find your brother.
Uh... yeah, my brother, um...
Uhhuh.
I'm going to go get
something to eat first.
What? Yeah, eat first.
Right behind you, big guy.
 Shake it, shake it 
 shake your groove thing,
shake your groove thing 
 yeah, yeah 
uh, maybe he's not here.
 Shake your groove thing,
shake your groove thing 
 yeah, yeah... 
ah...
 Show 'em how we do it now,
show 'em how we do it now... 
how do?
Your hair is very purty.
Nice shade of blue. Mmhmm.
Like a whale's belly. Yeah.
You, too.
Byebye, now.
 We do more out on the floor 
 Groovin' loose
or heart to heart 
 We put in motion... 
no, no, no, no, no!
Hey, there, uh...
 Shake your groove thing,
shake your groove thing... 
...Ted.
What are you doing here, Henry?
Uh, well...
Wow! Ted bedderhead!
I'm such a big fan.
Oh, I think it's great
you're going to
play in the show
and save country bear hall.
Play in the show?
Henry?!
No, no, no.
Well, we just thought we'd
drop by and see if we all...
We all?
They're here?
Uh, uh...
Oh, yeah.
 Burn, baby, burn 
 disco inferno,
burn, baby, burn 
I just... but...
 burn that mother down... 
so the bear said, "you going to
kill that before you eat it?"
You guys!
You, out!
Come on, now.
Hello, Ted.
Hello, brother. Out!
Out!
Ookay. All right.
Sorry, ma'am, I... Oh, geez.
Get outta here. Come on.
What, what, what
what makes you think
I'd get back together
with you guys?
Uh...?
Hey, look...
That's where I started out.
I'm not going back.
When I said I was finished,
I meant it.
I'm finished.
But, Mr. Bedderhead
we... Kid...
We need everyone
to make this happen,
and we need you.
Now, listen, kid...
Uh, uh... who is this guy?
That's beary.
Uh, no, no, no.
That was a long time ago, kid.
Things change.
Frankly, your little
nostalgic field trip
you know, is kind of pathetic.
Well, maybe it was.
Sorry to have
bothered you, Ted.
People are waiting for me.
You found your way in.
You can find your way out.
Hmm!
That guy's
turned into a real...
I'm going to go get the bus.
My mistake, everyone.
Don't know what I was thinking.
It's not your fault,
Henry. It's mine.
This whole thing was my idea.
No, no, now, it's
nobody's fault.
But it might as well be mine!
Why don't you just...?
Tennessee...
Right. Come on, Fred.
This ain't right.
 Badadadada 
 badadadada 
 it's not unusual to be
loved by anyone  huh? Huh?
 It's not unusual
to have fun with anyone 
 but when I see you
hanging about with anyone 
 it's not unusual
to see me... cry 
oh, I want to die.
 Badadadada... 
You... you're a wedding singer?
Yeah.
This... this ain't your party?
Nope.
So, you're not rich?
Yeah.
And you still
won't play with us?
Nope.
I'm not goin'.
Aw, Ted, you don't
gotta lie to us.
You're family.
And you're going.
Officer hamm: When the kidnappers
call to make their demands
we just agree
with whatever they say.
I already told you guys
he hasn't been kidnapped.
He's with the country bears.
Listen to me, son
you can be sure that they're
going to be keeping him
in some creepy underground lair
high up in the building until
they get their ransom, okay?
Would you guys listen to me?
There's not going
to be any ransom.
He's with the country bears.
They're doing a concert
tonight...
At country bear hall.
They just said that
to distract you
sports fan. Besides...
The country bears back together?
Son, listen, leave
the police work
to the professionals, okay?
Sure. Just... tell me
when they get here.
Good kid.
He's a keeper. Yeah.
All these years, I haven't
been able to face you guys.
I pretty much lost everything.
So I been trying
to make a buck.
Singing at weddings
and stuff like that.
Well, at least you're not doing
children's birthday parties.
Well, uh, I am.
Really?
But we saw your house...
Your gardener.
That's not my gardener.
That's Elton John.
Told ya.
I rent a room
over the garage from him.
Well, now, brother, that's okay
'cause we's all together again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just 'cause I'm telling
the truth
doesn't mean I'm dumb.
Huh?
Roadie, stop the bus.
Okay, have you rehearsed?
What songs you gonna to do?
Who's doing sound?
Well, we ain't exactly
figured all that out yet, Ted.
Same old country bears.
Come on, Ted. You
do kind of owe us.
I mean, you were
the reason we broke up.
Well! There it is.
Knew that was coming up.
I'm the reason
we stayed together, zeb.
Did any of you...
any of you... ever thank me?
We all had our jobs to do, Ted.
Uhhuh.
Oh, right. Drinkin'...
Blubberin', and...
Starin' into space.
Hey! Huh?
What we were...
Was years ago.
Blubberin'? Uh, uh...
Well, you were blubberin'.
Hey? Okay, there.
Guys! Hey, hey, guys!
Guys!
You know, in people magazine,
April 1983
you all said that
the bears was your family.
And like a family...
Kid, that's just a bunch
of meaningless publicity.
You don't know nothing about
the real bears, understand?
Nothin'!
We are not a family.
You're right.
This isn't a family.
'Cause the people who love you
no matter what?
That's your family.
Who told you that, beary?
My dad.
My dad.
Wh... wh... hold on, beary.
Mom?
Beary.
Beary!
Beary, beary, beary! Oh!
There's my good boy!
Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?
Did they brainwash you?
How many fingers
am I holding up?
I'm fine, mom.
Oh, honey.
Norbert! Norbert!
Yeah, hon, what is it?
Hi, dad.
Oh! Beary!
Oh, beary, beary
my beary boy! Oh!
Hey, doofus.
Hey, Dex.
Look who's home.
Come here!
Aw, beary left his stuff.
Hmm...
"My hero," by beary barrington,
fourth grade.
"My hero is really heroes
"and my heroes
are the country bears.
"Whenever I'm sad.
"I play one of their songs
"and I forget why
I was even sad at all.
"And if you'd met my brother
you'd know why
I was always sad."
Hmm.
"I can't really say zeb
is my hero, or Fred, or Ted
or even Tennessee."
"But as the country bears,
what they can do together
makes them my heroes."
"I'd like to meet them someday.
That would be cool."
It says here
"a+, but is everything
about the country bears?"
Hey.
Beary's a sharp little guy.
This morning he told me
something else.
Mr. Chicken... is a girl.
It's a pretty straightforward
demolition, Mr. Thimple.
Take about
a half hour to bulldoze her
to the ground.
Oh, yes... do that.
Dex, honey,
would you get that?
Okay.
And tell beary to come
down for some pie.
Beary! Pie!
Uh... beary?
Hey. That Ted guy is here.
You want me to kick him out?
Ted? Ted bedderhead
is here?
Yeah.
You, uh, you left your stuff
on the bus.
You can keep it.
I don't want it.
Um, look, I, uh... mm...
I hope you know
how lucky you are.
It only took you three days
to understand something
that took me ten years
to figure out.
What's that?
Mr. Chicken is a girl.
What?
I got ya.
Really, I want to tell you
that I'm sorry.
I was mad...
not at you... and I'm sorry.
And that thing you wrote
in your journal about us
being great
when we're together?
It's true.
You're going to do the show?
Nah, we're not doing the show.
Not without you.
Whoohoo!
Y'all come with me.
We can all ride together
on the...
Bus? Bus?
The bus was stolen.
It was that thimple fella.
Come on, move along.
Move it. Come on.
What are you waiting for?
Thimple, I'm definitely
changing banks.
Oh, pooh.
I hate it
when we lose a customer.
We have to find them.
They have to do that show.
Beary, beary.
Your stuff was on
that bus, right?
Yeah.
All your stuff?
We can track them with this.
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
All right.
Okay, in you go, big boy.
Hey, hey, hey, no, no.
Stop!
I have a better idea.
Whoa.
Easy, captain.
Go on. Get in there!
Get in there!
Why are you doing this?
I can't have that show.
I can't have you ruin
what I've been working on
for 30 years.
30 years!
Which way?
Just, uh... go straight.
Okay, take a right.
Take a right here.
Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, oh, whoa!
Whoa, my kidneys.
What's the problem, bub?
You ruined my life.
Well, it's not our fault
you became a banker.
Not that.
What are you talking about?
This!
Huh?
What's he doing?
Uhuh.
What are you doing?
Whwhat's he doing?
Huh?

Oh, my word!
You're Benny bogswaggle!
The armpit farter.
Eww...
That's right.
A sweet, innocent kid
you jerks beat
all those years back.
You hit me with a chair.
And since that day
I've been plotting my revenge
waiting for the day
I'd destroy the place
that brought me misery.
Well, that day... is tonight!
No, no, no... No, no...
Left, left.
We're pulling a boat.
Left, left!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's going right.
It's going right.
Turn right. Turn right.
Go right. Go right!
Whoa, oh, oh, oh...!
Oh, no, no!
No!
Aah...!
We're right on top of it.
Aah!
A big turn!
The bus!
Whoa!
That was pretty nifty. Yeah.
Thanks.

thimple who's boss, huh?
Bearrr... powerrr...!
Rrr... sorry.

Whoohoohoo!
 We're an American band

 we're an American band 
 hey! We're an American band. 
 I hope the day will be
a lighter highway 
 for friends are found
on every road 
 can you ever think
of any better way 
 for the lost and weary
travelers to go? 
 making friends
for the world to see 
 let the people know
you got what you need 
 with a friend at hand,
you will see the light... 
Here we are.
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Open the door. Open the door.
Watch your step.
Come on, guys.
I can't wait to see
the ol' place.
Hey, where is everybody?
Huh?
What going on?
No cars outside, no lights.
No... No people.
Here's the money.
You give me the five back
then I give you the ten.
Wait a minute.
You give me the 20...
Okay. Hey!
What's going on here?
I'm impressed.
Wow, I'm telling you.
I am so impressed.
I cannot tell you
how impressed I am, but,
boys, it doesn't matter.
The place is dead.
Rip... Huh?
Look at him.
He never promoted the show.
Wh...? Rip!
Oh, Reed... What,
uh, it's not me.
Rip.
Uh, hey.
Wow. Hey, guys, long time.
Looking good!
Henry, are you working out?
Rip!
It's not personal, Henry.
It's just business.
Business? Business
that'll ruin our lives!
I can't believe...!
Yeah, maybe, but itit's him.
Big Al: Hey, ain't you guys
doing the show tonight?
Uh... Ain't gonna be one
big Al.
Nobody showed up.
What are you talking about,
Fred?
They's all out
in the back field.
They're what?
Didn't want anyone parkin'
on my grass out front.
Whoohoo!
No!
Whoohoo! Come on. Come on.
This is not over, bears!
I hate you bears. Aah!
There he is! There he is!
Ah, look, here's
the money I got.
Holy moly.
Well, folks,
here's the good news.
The count is in and we saved
country bear hall!
Here we go!
Bears, bears, bears...!
Good luck, you guys.
Hey, where you going?
To... sit in the audience.
Well, that's a weird place
for a country bear to sit
during a country bear concert.
Yeah, beary.
You're one of us now.
Welcome aboard, kid.
Ladies and gentlemen
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you...
after an absence of many years...
the one, the only
the country bears!
Ha, ha! Whoo!
 We take the long way around 
 we get lost and we get found 
 I wonder why we couldn't go 
 straight to the heart
of love 
 Climbing mountains,
crossing streams 
 crying tears
and dreaming dreams 
 I guess that's the only way
we know 
 straight to the heart
of love 
sing it!
 Straight to the heart
of love should be 
 the shortest distance
from lonely 
 not always the road
you're thinking of 
 straight to the heart
of love 
 So, take a chance,
shine your light 
isn't it wonderful?
 Everything will be all right 
 you're gonna find a way
to go 
 straight to the heart
of love 
I love you!
 Straight to the heart
of love should be 
 the shortest distance
from lonely 
 not always the road
you're thinking of 
 straight to the heart
of love 
 I've been thinking
about you and me 
 and how this love was meant
to be 
 I'm taking
the next clear shot I see 
 straight to the heart
of love 
 I'm taking
the next clear shot I see 
 straight to the heart
of love... 
 Straight to the heart
of love 
 straight 
 straight to the heart
of love 
 straight 
 straight 
 Straight 
Oh, yeah.
 Straight 
go, man, go.
 Straight 
Who's that little bear?
Oh, that's no little bear.
That's my brother!
Yay! Whoohoo!
 Straight to the heart
of love 
 straight 
 straight to the heart
of love 
 straight. 
The country bears!
How about that, folks?
Yo, beary!
Whoowhoowhoo!
You're the bear!
You're the bear!
Yay!
Yay!
 There's a town down the road 
 where I ain't been before 
 nobody knows my name 
 or what I'm looking for 
 maybe things will be
a little different 
 'cause it can't
stay the same 
 I'm gonna ease on
down the road 
 where nobody knows my name. 
Don was: 14 platinum
records, 26 top ten singles. 
The bears to me really typify
rock and roll.
Their lives embody freedom.
Nobody tells them what to do. 
Hello.
Everybody loves the bears.
The reason I do what I do today
is because of the bears.
I needed a... you know...
Somebody that I could relate to,
a certain band
and the bears... they just did it
for me, you know?
I admired their, uh, courage.
And their tenacity.
And their ability to go out
and fight
for what they believed in.
Real legends. It's incredible.
And I'm glad we didn't get them,
you know, during wintertime.
Hmm?
The country was cool and all,
but, you know
it was becoming the hiphop
generation, you know.
People wanted the beat.
The streets was pop. 
You know what I mean? 
Let 'em feel 
what the country feel like 
when it's bangin'. 
 Bow, unh. 
you know what I'm saying?
 huh. 
we could do that.
I found myself going back
andand sampling some
of the baselines
that the bears had 
andand then we used it 
in our first single
and got sued by 'em.
It was like nothing
I'd ever heard.
Wow! What is this?
I have respect for all peoples
and all bears.
Bears are human beings,
just like us.
You understand?
I'm an alien.
Willie Nelson: Me and zeb 
opened up a can of honey
on the roof of the white house.
We had a great time.
I'm a honey. They dip honey.
I'm a honey dip.
You know what I'm saying?
It's a honey thing, b.
A certain amount
of honey, they...
They start to lose focus.
It was bad.
Bon appetit.
They'll eat anything
that isn't locked up.
Hey, you want a sandwich?
Uh, no thanks.
I had trout for breakfast.
The bears made me feel proud
to be a fullfigured woman.
You want me to eat you,
don't you?
These guys were fat
long before it was spelled
with a "ph."
Come on. In you go.
I always hated bears.
I knew it.
You have one.
The guys at the
station have one.
Oh.
Even Mrs. Davis,
our receptionist, has one.
You don't have to
wear no fake mustache
to impress me.
Thank you.
You know, I'm kind of glad
this happened.
Well, good.
Now, you don't have to
wear no mustache, right?
No, I'm wearing the mustache.
