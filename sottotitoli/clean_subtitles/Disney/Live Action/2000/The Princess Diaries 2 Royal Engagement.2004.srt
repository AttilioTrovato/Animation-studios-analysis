Although your diplomas
are equally specific, remember: 
You are all going out
into the world as individuals.
I now proudly present
this year's Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs
graduating class.
Go, go, go.
Bye. We love you.
You have to write.
Thank your mom for all the cookies, OK?
I'm very proud of you.
Dear diary. 
Well, it's me. Brandnew
college graduateslashprincess. 
Oh, I can't believe it's been five years 
since Grandma told me
that I was a princess. 
Me? A... a princess? Shut up.
And right after that,
my mother surprised me 
by marrying my highschool teacher,
Patrick O'Connell. 
It must be going well,
because they are now expecting a baby. 
Lilly's remained the same,
as she continues to cause turmoil, 
but now as a graduate
student at Berkeley. 
Which she calls "Berserkeley." 
"How's Michael?" you may ask. 
Well, we're just friends now, as he
went off to tour the country with his band. 
Princess Mia.
Look out the window,
and welcome back to Genovia.
Oh, there it is. My beautiful Genovia. 
Of course, I'm completely excited to be
going back, but I'm also a bit nervous. 
Genovia One has landed. 
Grandma Clarisse will step down
by the end of this year as queen, 
and I'll be taking over, since I'm now 21. 
Mira, la princesa Mia. 
It's the princess from America! Hi.
Viva la princesa. 
I know I studied diplomacy
and political science at school, but... 
there is no course in "Queen,"
or "How To Run A Country 101." 
But Grandma's going to help me, and
I'll take over when she thinks I'm ready. 
Of course, I wonder...
will I ever be ready? 
In the meantime, I'm going to live
in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale, 
and eventually sit on a throne
and rule the people of Genovia. 
Is that scary or what? 
Well, maybe Fat Louie
can give me some help. 
Her Royal Highness Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi
has arrived.
Welcome home, Princess.
And her royal pussycat, Sir Fat Louie.
The one downer in my fairy tale
is I've never been in love. 
Countess Puck of Austria.
However, this evening
is my 21stbirthday party, 
and our tradition says I have to dance
with all the eligible bachelors in Genovia. 
So maybe I'll meet
my Prince Charming tonight. 
The queen is coming. 
Here she comes. Look alive.
Places.
She'll have a doubledoor entrance.
The eagle is flying.
Repeat, the eagle is flying.
She's in the foyer.
Beautiful.
But you're late, Your Majesty.
A queen is never late.
Everyone else is simply early.
Of course.
Her Majesty
Clarisse Renaldi, 
Queen of Genovia.

Greetings, good friends.
I am delighted
to welcome you here this evening.
 
Thank you.
I hope they have string cheese.
Ah, good.
Many of you will remember King Rupert's
and my granddaughter, Princess Mia.
King Rupert. May he rest in peace. 
Will you please
raise your glasses in celebration
of Princess Mia's 21st birthday.
Presenting Her Royal Highness
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi,
Princess of Genovia.


To Princess Mia.
To Princess Mia. 
It happens all the time.
Oh!
And happy birthday.
Thank you.

Oh, I don't speak Greek.

And you obviously don't speak English.

One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two...
Ow!
Sorry.

Have you met the princess yet?
Briefly. But she wasn't very friendly.
I got a hello and a goodbye.
Is this an American custom?
I saw that.
Oh, uh...

Oh, I've missed you.
Sebastian.
Majesty.
Sheila.
Majesty.
What have you been up to?
Oh, just partying, girl. You know.
Oh, your foot. I'm so sorry. Are...
Are you all right?
I'll survive, Your Highness.
The fault was entirely my own. I apologize.
Are you sure you don't want to
exchange licenses and proof of insurance?
No, no. These shoes
were a little big anyway.
The swelling should help them fit better.
Hey, get a load of this guy.
Shimmy shimmy.
Hey, hey, hey. Bitte. 
You are a beautiful dancer.
Oh, why, thank you so much.
Like a deer.
Or a chipmunk in the forest.
Looks like he's trying to land a plane.
Woodland animals
are a lovely thing to be compared to.
May I?
Your timing is impeccable. Thank you.
You're welcome, Your Highness.
Mia. I like to be called Mia.
And you are?
Nicholas. Just Nicholas.
Well, I'm very glad to see that my
clumsiness hasn't affected your dancing.
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot.
You can step on my foot anytime.
Aww.
It is Prince Jacques' turn.
Your Highness.
If this were my party,
we'd be kissing by now.
That's Prince Jacques.
He's about 12 years old.
He's a very precocious prince.
He wears aftershave
to make people think that he's older.
May I blow in your ear?
Can you reach it?
Princess, there's someone
from parliament you should meet.
Charlotte, how many
members of parliament are there?
Only two left, Your Highness.
Cake, ladies?
Oh, dear.
Oh, Your Highness, pardon me,
I am so sorry. It was only an accident.
It's fine, it's fine.
No harm, no foul, no bruise.
Thank you so much.
You should be more careful,
Your Royal Highness.
Somebody might try
to take that away from you.
Oh, I hope not.
But thank you so much for all your help.
Someone like me.
Welcome back to "Eggs with Elsie." 
I'm Elsie Kentworthy,
and today's topic is Princess Mia. 
Hi. How's it going?
So sorry, I thought I was alone.
No, Miss.
I'm Brigitte, if it pleases you.
At your service.
And I'm Brigitta, Miss.
Brigitte and Brigitta, I'm Mia.
And, please, you don't...
Don't curtsy like that.
Not like this? How do you like it, then?
Like this, maybe?
No, no, no, I didn't
mean, like, you know...
No, no, not that way.
I didn't mean it, um...
The queen bids you good morning,
Princess. She's in session with parliament.
OK.
I see you've met your lady's maids.
Yeah. Um...
How do you turn off the curtsies?
Oh.
Enough bowing. Back to your chores.
Her Majesty will meet you
in one hour at the throne room.
OK.
I'm sorry your suite isn't ready yet.
But you're welcome
to stay here in Her Majesty's suite...
No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's...
Hey, can I explore
the palace a little bit?
Of course.

Oh. Well, you've met Maurice.
Hey, Mo. 
The throne room, in an hour.
The parliament of Genovia is in session.
Prime Minister Motaz presiding.
Viscount Mabrey, you have the floor.
Monsieur Mabrey, s'il vous plaît. 
As we all know, the 21st birthday
of an heir to the Genovian bloodline
is indeed a matter
of great public significance.
It signifies that this young person
is eligible to assume the crown.
Indeed, we are well aware of
this, Viscount.
The queen has already
indicated that Princess Mia
intends to learn more at her side
before assuming the throne.
It was not Princess Mia
to whom I was referring.
Oh, wow.
King Chevalier
was the greatgreatgreatgrandfather of...
Hello?
Ah... Oh.

Proceed.

Nice.
Hello?
So. 
As of the 20th of October last year,
on the occasion of his 21st birthday,
another Genovian of the royal bloodline
became eligible to assume the throne.
What?
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.
I beg your pardon?
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.
Therefore, Your Majesty,
I am pleased to say
that my nephew
is ready to take his place
as Genovia's rightful king.
Shut up.
I beg your pardon?
I mean...
"Shut up" doesn't always mean shut up.
"Taisezvous" veut dire... 
In America, it's like
"Oh, my," "Gee whiz," "Wow."
"Fantastique," "Superbe," "Oy vey."
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. 
But isn't Princess Mia
first in line to ascend the throne?
Not yet.
Genovian law states
that a princess must marry
before she can take the throne.
We have never
enforced that law. 
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.
I mean, this is the 21st century,
for heaven's sake.
My granddaughter should
be given the same rights as any man.
Yeah!
Genovia shall have no queen
lest she be bound in matrimony.
Lord Palimore?
That is the law of Genovia
for the last 300 years.
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule
because she is unmarried.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
Not all of us are sure that the princess
is the most suitable choice
to govern our great nation.
Ooh! 
Now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.
I suggest this honored body
allow Princess Mia one year,
during which time she must marry,
or she forfeits the throne
of Genovia to young Lord Devereaux.
What? No.
I object. I object most strongly.
One year?
60 days.
Two months.
60 days?
30 days.
How could parliament expect me
to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...
It's like it's a big trick to get me
to have an arranged marriage, or...
No.
No, there's no...
That's it, there's no "or." There's... I...
An arranged marriage is my only choice.
What kind of person
agrees to an arranged marriage?
Uh...
You agreed to an arranged marriage.
Right.
Yes, I did.
And it turned out quite splendidly.
He was my best friend.
We grew very fond of each other.
I'm sure, Grandma, but...
I dream of love, not fondness.
But you don't have to do this, Mia.
You don't have to become queen.
This is so unfair.
Amelia. 

Courage is not the absence of fear, 
but rather the judgment
that something else is more important... 
than fear.
There are 550 years
of Renaldis on these walls.
And I will be up there
next to my father.
I'm sure I want my chance
to make a difference as a ruler.
Spoken like a true queen.
You, my boy, a trueborn Genovian.
You should be our king.
I agree.
But how can we make it happen?
Give me one of your arrows.
I'm going to show you a trick that
I learned from an old Italian philosopher.
Niccolò Machiavelli.
I can make this dart
hit the bull'seye every time.

Yes, but that is cheating.
You've got it.
Lord Devereaux will be arriving shortly,
Mrs. Kout, with his snake of an uncle.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Hm?
I know Lionel is the prime minister's
nephew and he's interning for the summer
because he wants to learn about security.
But he never leaves my side.
He sticks to me like Velcro, madam.
It won't last very long.
He returns to school in the autumn.
He wants an audience with you.
What, now?
Now.
Lionel?
Short.
I don't know if you've met
Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,
and Priscilla and Olivia, my lady's maids.
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.
Oh, that's not necessary, Lionel.
Everybody in this room
has highpriority clearance.
Of course, of course.
Your Majesty?
Hm?
I would gladly take a bullet for you.
Oh, how brave.
Most interns don't even
want to fetch me my tea.
The limousine is at the gates, madam.
The viscount
is not staying, just the nephew. 
Joseph, I want you to protect him
and keep your eye on him at all times.
Of course. Lionel.
Oh, hello.
So is this all right to welcome
the viscount and his nephew?
Very appropriate. And pretty.
Oh, I can't believe
parliament invited the guy
who's trying to steal the throne
to stay here with us at the palace.
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.
I did.
Wha...
I offered to have him
hung by his toes in our courtyard.
Excuse me.
Yeah, what about Joe's suggestion, huh?
No. If there's any mischief going on,
I'd prefer it be right under my nose.
It's not a very difficult job,
you know. 
You just have to open the door
before the passenger dies of old age.
Hello, I'm here to welcome you.
Your staff is incompetent and unreliable.
I just so don't want
to be nice to this guy, you know?
I mean, he is rude,
he's arrogant, selfcentered, he's...
Ah, well, have you met him?
No.
Neither have I.
Yeah, but he probably is, Grandma.
I mean...
Like, now, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
he wants to be the king of Genovia?
What is that about?
Oh, tush.
Whatever he is, we will be charm itself.
We will present ourselves
with grace and poise.
Announcing Viscount Mabrey
and Lord Devereaux. 
Your Majesty. 
Your Highness.
Mabrey.
Ma'am, may I introduce my nephew,
Lord Nicholas Devereaux.
Nicholas. We are delighted
to make your acquaintance.
Your Majesty, the pleasure is all mine.
And thank you so much
for inviting me to stay at the palace.
May I present my granddaughter Mia.
Your Highness.
Mia, would you care to welcome our guest?
Lord Nicholas.

She always does that.
Uh...
I will personally
get some ice for that foot,
and I'll be with you
as quickly as I possibly can.
An accident.
Of course.
She's training to be a flamenco dancer.
Would you care to explain
what was going on out there?
Sorry.
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas, actually.
Yep. At the ball. Didn't know
who he was, so, you know, we...
We danced, and I flirted.
I feel so stupid right now.
I see. Well, as your queen
I absolutely cannot condone it.
As a grandma, I say, "right on."
Now, if you'll come with me,
I have something to show you.
Oh, yeah.
I think you could leave that right there.
Uh... Yeah.
Thank you, culinary people.
I'll be back. 
The renovations for your suite
are finally finished.
Should have been ready for you
when you arrived,
but unfortunately we asked
Rupert's cousin to do the bathroom.
It's a good lesson. Nepotism
belongs in the arts, not in plumbing.
This is your very own suite.
Are you serious? This is...
Mmhm.

This is my room?
Yes.
Oh, Grandma.
This is very nice.
Good.
We just made the bed.
This is so cool.
Ah, Fat Louie. I think
he rather likes his new abode as well. 
There's more.
Is that mine?
Why don't you go and find out?
OK.
I have my own mall.
Ooh, very nice shoes.
I'm glad you like it.
Try pressing button number three. 
Oh.
They're charming. I love these.
What do you think? Grandma?
I'm here.
Oh, hello. Ooh, love that.
This is...
Now press combination 656.
Um... They're a little... gorgeous.
I had a selection
of the crown jewels brought out for you. 
They're yours to borrow, with great
discretion, at appropriate times.
Now for the best surprise of all.
Wow.
Gorgeous, Grandma. But kind of a letdown
after the jewels, I'm not gonna lie...


You're here.
I know I'm here.
You're in Genovia.
I know.
You're in my closet.
Yeah.
You're blonde.
I'm blonde.
I'm so glad to see you.
I think this is
as good a moment as any to bow out.
I think I'll let you two ladies
catch up with each other.
I can't believe you're here.
When did your flight get in? 
Just a little while ago.
Oh.
By the way... I'm getting married.
To who?
I don't know.
Baron Johann Klimt. 
No, not appropriate.
He's a compulsive gambler. 

Yes. Oh, yes,
I, I, I, I absolutely accept.
Prince William. He's not eligible,
because he's in line for his own crown.
Oh.
If he's not eligible,
why is he included in these pictures?
I just love to look at him.
Mm. Me too. Mmmm.
Your Majesty.
Next.
Antoine Suisson of Paris.
Uhhuh. 
Plays the harp. No title, but good family.
What about the title "husband"?
Yeah, he's cute.
Mm. His boyfriend
thinks he's handsome also.
Right on.
No matter. Put him on all the
invitation lists. He's a divine dancer.
Next. 
Too old. 
Too young.
Does this popcorn taste like pears?
Mm. Genovian specialty.
Arrested too many times.
Wait, no. 
We need someone titled,
someone who can help you run a country
without ego getting in the way.
Someone attractive, smart,
but not arrogant.
Someone with compassion.
Someone like him?
Yes. Someone very much like him.
Good choice, Mia.
I wonder I didn't think of him before.
Andrew Jacoby.
Duke of Kenilworth.
Aw.
Well, he looks... decent.
He was an Olympic swimmer,
rides motorcycles, loves photography, 
and he's a pilot in the Royal Air Force. 
Can I do that?
No.
You ever take those shades off?
No.
Here we are
at the breezy seashore village of Mertz. 
And our two lovers have perfect weather
for their first public outing.
Along with Andrew's parents,
Susan and Arnold.
Must be rather hard
to get to know each other this way.
Oh, they're waving at us.
My... Oh.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, Mia. A princess
should not run for a scarf.
I got it.
Shall we have some tea?
Your scarf, ma'am.
Why, thank you, sir.
I think you might be clumsier than me.
Oh, good shot.
Oh.
No, no, let them bond. Let them bond.
The glasses. Off.
I'm coming, Princess.
I'm coming, I'm coming, Princess.
Oh, ow.
Oh, there you go.
Ah.
Ah.
 They were smitten 
 While playing badminton 
 Where's my kitten 
 

 I want a little 
 Something more 
 Don't want the middle 
 Or the one before 
 I don't desire 
 A complicated past 
 I want a love that will last 
Every marriage in my family
for the past 200 years has been arranged... 
Andrew?
Yes?
Could you try to talk without moving your
lips? The... the readers have binoculars.
Here we find our favorite new royal couple,
nestled under Genovia's famous pear tree.
And I have something for you.
Oh, you don't have to get me anything.
No, my birthday was last week, and...
Mia. Here you go.
Cool. You know, film. That's nice.
It's... What is that? Is that...
It's a film canister.
What's in the film canister? What's in it?
Why don't you open it? You'll see.
Oh, OK.
Oh.
It was my greatgrandmother's
engagement ring.
She and my greatgrandfather
were married for 57 years.
So I...
I felt it could be lucky for us, maybe.
Do I have to put it on myself?
No, I could do that.
OK.
Yes.
Oh, my goodness. It was a ring.
A royal proposal has been made.
Fly the lovebirds.
You ready?
If you are.
Announcing the royal engagement 
of Princess Mia and Andrew Jacoby,
Duke of Kenilworth.
Here, just like the princess.
Uncle, I hate to say this,
but you were wrong. 
Princess Mia has managed
to find a husband within a week.
Mia cannot possibly be happy
with the idea of an arranged marriage.
Your task is to romance her.
Show her what
a real relationship could be like.
A relationship filled
with heat and passion.
And change her mind about Andrew.
Exactly.
And the 30day deadline expires,
and the throne is ours.
And you're sure my father wanted this?
It was his dearest wish.
His last words to me were:
"Help him, Arthur.
One day he could be king."
I don't recall him
ever mentioning that to me.
Well, you wouldn't.
You were only six years old when he died.
But you do remember
who he named you after, don't you?
Yes. Grandfather Nicholas.
No, no, no, no. Niccolò Machiavelli.
Power, my boy,
means never having to say you're sorry.
Here, kitty kitty kitty.
Come here, kitty kitty.
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, Your Highness.
Shh.
Andrew's plane just took off. 
He said he'd call
as soon as he arrives in London.
He won't be gone long.
Why are we whispering?
I'm hiding
from my lady's maids. 
But I'm fine, I'm fine.


Are you having second thoughts?
No.
Actually, on the contrary.
I was just admiring my ring.
It was Andrew's grandmother's.
You know, he really is so romantic.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I really
must go see to some wedding details.
I'm sorry, is there something
you wanted to say to me?
No, no.
You are the one
who stomped on me with your big feet.
Big feet?
Brigitte, I found her.
Uh, Brigitta.
I'm not here. 
It wasn't her. It was a ghost. Whoo...
Well, you know,
you danced with my big feet.
Fine. I danced with you. Call The Hague,
convene the warcrimes tribunal.
Mia, I would remind you
that we only danced for about a minute.
It was more than a minute.
Well, maybe a minute and a half.
Fine. It was a minute and a half,
but it was also a lie,
because you didn't tell me who you were
and that you were trying to steal my crown.
Please pardon me, I just had
a momentary lapse of good manners.
You see, usually, when I ask a woman
to dance, I always show her my family tree.
Oh. Well, aren't you just...
crafty.
Let's look in the ballroom. 
The ballroom? 
I don't think she's in the ballroom.
Well.
Do you want to know
what else you were doing,
while you were doing your little lie dance?
Lie dance? 
The ballroom? 
Yeah, that is exactly what you did.
What is a lie dance?
I'll go look
in the ballroom myself. 
All right. 
The lie dance is not the point.
The point is that...
What is the point?
I...
The point is that I'm onto you. Oh boy,
am I onto what you are trying to do.
And what am I trying to do?
I think we both know
exactly what that is.
Oh, oh.
Please forgive the intrusion,
Your Highness, Lord Devereaux.
No, you don't... Uh...
I'm told this Lord Devereaux boy
is a native Genovian. 
Recently graduated Cambridge,
gourmet cook,
plays polo and rugby,
and is known as quite a ladies' man.
She was in a closet?
With him. Yes.
Does she have the makings of a queen?
Well, she's young,
but I've always believed in her.
The wedding invitations
have been sent out.
She and Andrew make a fine pair, I think.
Yes, they do.
She's very set on it, you know.
Clarisse, my dear.
Forget the wedding for a moment.

In less than a month,
you will no longer be queen,
and I will no longer
be your head of security.
I think it's time we bring
our friendship out of the shadows.
Oh, Joseph, I...
Yes.
Yes, my dear. I would kneel
if it weren't for my knee replacement.
Joseph, there's a wedding to be planned.
Mia needs to win over the people
of Genovia, all in less than 30 days.
Perhaps it's time to consider
the duty you have to yourself.
Oh.
Clarisse...
My darling, please think about it. Please.
I will.
Dear diary. My queen
lessons continue. Surprise, surprise. 
To fulfill one Genovian tradition,
I must learn to shoot a flaming arrow 
through a ceremonial ring, which will
happen on the eve of my coronation. 
It's symbolic for lighting
my own eternal flame. 
 
 We all want a holiday 
 Let's take a little time for a getaway 
 It's all good, and better still 
 We can go crazy and you know we will 
 We'll have fun in the sun 
 Everybody wants some 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Fun in the sun 
 Everybody needs some 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Fun in the sun 
 I'm talking about a good time 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Fun in the sun 
 You know 
Sorry.
They're here. The sparrow is flying.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I am almost in time though.
OK, sorry, got it, I got it.
You know what? I'm OK. I'm fine.
So...
What are we learning today?
We are learning the art of the fan.
Fascinating.
Yes.
Get up. Get up. We only have about
ten minutes in which to communicate this.
Now, first of all,
one handles a fan very deliberately.
It's a tremendous
tool of communication. That's it.
You can say things like,
"I'm feeling flirtatious. Come hither."
 

You can say, "I never wish
to speak to you again. Go away."
You can say,
"I'm feeling terribly shy today."
 Pert as a schoolgirl well can be 
 Filled to the brim with girlish glee 
 Three little maids from school 
 Everything is a source of fun 
And you...
Are you sassing your grandma?
I would never sass you, Grandma.
This is also a way
of showing you're annoyed.
We will have somebody come
and visit your farm in the morning,
and perhaps we can repair
the well and save your field.
This is for your table.
Thank you.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You do this so well. They just adore you.
It's part of an ancient Genovian tradition.
One has to be fair and very honest.
Even if you can't help,
you have to show the people you care.
Citizen Jacqueline Grenough. 
We will review
your scholarship application,
and someone will be in touch
no later than the end of next week.
Oh, merci, Your Majesty. 
Here is a melon for your table.
Oh, merci, Jacqueline. C'est gentil. 
Citizen Tiny Duval. 
Your Majesty.
Bonjour, Tiny. 
May I present
my granddaughter, Princess Mia.
Princess Mia.
Monsieur.
Thank you for seeing me today.
Something for your table.
Thank you.
She's my favorite.
I hope you like omelets.
May I?
Of course.
Be careful.
Aw, it's a chicken.
Careful.
We have a chicken situation
in the throne room.
Mia.
Yeah?
A princess never chases a chicken.
Dear diary. 
Tomorrow my stress level goes to 11,
as I review the royal guard. 
The whole court
will be watching, plus the troops. 
And I'm wearing a floorlength dress. 
I also have to be ladylike
while riding sidesaddle. Hah! 
I can't ride sidesaddle.
No, no, no.
I couldn't ride sidesaddle either
when I was your age,
and frankly, dear,
it is acutely uncomfortable.
Herbie is my riding companion.
Here he is.
Herbie.
It's a wooden leg.
Yes.
That is impressively sneaky, Grandma.
Did you come up with this on your own?
Oh, no, it's a centuriesold idea. 
And you put the riding boot on it...
Exactly. 
Our ancestors knew
a thing or two, right? 
You just drape your skirt over it
and nobody suspects a thing. 
Hear ye, hear ye. 
Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi
reviews the Royal Guard of Genovia.
Now, the last time we spoke,
you mentioned that Princess Mia's horse,
Sandy, gets easily spooked by snakes.
So let's get it really spooked,
shall we?
This is a fake snake.
Oh, you're very observant.
A regular David Attenborough.
That's rubber, yes.
But it will spook the horse.
I'm Nick. Viscount Mabrey's nephew.
Ah, the chap who's trying
to stage the palace coup.
I'm Andrew Jacoby. Nice to meet you.
Lilly Moscovitz, official best friend
of future queen. I don't like you.
Pleasure.
Atten... hurgh!
I like all these men wearing helmets.
Open ranks... hurgh!

Sandy... Oh! Oh! Oh!
My goodness. Oh, my...
Easy. Sandy, easy.
Princess.
Princess. It's OK, Princess. I'm here.
No wonder she's so clumsy.
She's got a wooden leg.

Talk about getting off on the wrong foot.
The ceremony has officially ended. 

You shouldn't hide.
It only makes them gossip more.
What do you want?
Just think, Mia. One more leg
and you could've easily outrun your horse.
I don't need this right now.
Mia, I'm...
I'm sorry, I...
No, you're not.
You never think about anyone but yourself.
So just this once,
can you please let me be miserable,
and not make me feel
worse about myself?
Just go away. Go away, go away...
Mia...
Princess, excuse me.
The queen has arrived.
Yes.
Nicholas.
Am I going to be disappointed in you?
Unfortunate incident, that.
I'm just leaving.
You going to come and see me off?
I'd like to speak
with your uncle alone, Nicholas. Please.
Viscount. You may not be aware of what my
job entails as the royal head of security.
My job is to protect the crown,
to make sure no harm comes to the crown.
To step in when someone toys
with the crown's emotions, you see.
I think the entire country understands how
well you cater for the crown's emotions.
If you hurt my girl,
you will answer directly to me.
And whatever crimes
I commit against you, remember:
I have diplomatic immunity
in 46 countries.
Including Puerto Rico.
Sir, you will find that the word "fear"
is not in my vocabulary.
Perhaps.
But it's in your eyes.
You forgot something.
Au revoir, Pierre, et merci beaucoup.
Très bien, Majesté. 
Nicholas, I...
I want to ask you a question.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Why are you so against
Princess Mia being queen?
Well, my uncle feels that
Princess Mia doesn't know the people.
And you feel you do know the people?
Yes. I was born here,
I went to primary school here.
I am a true Genovian.
Mia didn't even know
she was Genovian until high school,
and to be frank,
she's spent little time here since then.
Well, I happen to feel
that she'll make a great ruler.
She's terribly bright, sensitive, caring.
I know that.
You do?
Yes. Yes, I do. But...
How can one rule the people
if they do not know the people?
Touché. That's a very good question.
 
Opera's new rising star, Anna Netrebko.
Looks good enough to eat.
How are your grandchildren,
Lily, Charlotte and Sam?
They're wonderful.
Thank you for remembering.
How are you? Good to see you.
How's your dachshund? Maury, right?
He is great.
You remember him from last summer?

Mia's doing well.
Some major mingling, I see.
A little higher, Olivia.
Mia. 
Did you happen to see who's here?
Who?
The king wannabe with Lady Elissa.
Oh.
Is she his... girlfriend?
Nicholas doesn't have girlfriends,
he has dates.
But attractive ones.
You talk to him much?
Uh...
We acknowledge each other.
Andrew?
Yes, dear. Coming.
Yuck.
Well, the camera's all ready to go, so...
All right.
Let's go this way.
No more straggling for me.
You did very well, Mia. Very charming.
Oh, thank you.
Wait, wait, wait. The light is perfect.
What?
Just one more, please.
Please, no more pictures.
Come on, please. One more.
It's very flattering, but...
Mia, one more picture...
Ah.
Hello. I'm Andrew Jacoby.
Oh, hello. Lady Elissa.
Pleasure.
Lady Elissa.
Your Highness.
Hello.
Elissa and I were just discussing
her latest achievement.
She's received a Rhodes Scholarship.
Nicholas, please.
Why not brag? You're an amazing woman.
Elissa, congratulations. You know, Andrew
has a PhD in anthropology from Oxford.
Oh, really? That's wonderful.
Fantastic.
Elissa was in the Peace Corps.
Really?
Andrew spent four months in Papua New
Guinea studying the bark of a yam tree.
Elissa singlehandedly...
Andrew...
Elissa is actually trying to say something.
Yes, Lady Elissa?
Andrew, would you like to get a drink?
I have a feeling they're going to start
a "My horse is bigger than your horse" run.
I would absolutely love to. Excuse us.
You know, her horse actually is very huge.
Oh, really?
Yes...
Fantastic party.
It is.
You two make such a lovely couple.
We do. Thanks.
It's a shame you're not attracted to him.
I know, it...
You... I... Come back here.
 
Ladies and gentlemen,
a special treat for our friends from Asia.
Jonny Blu.
 
Come back here. You... you can't just
say something like that and walk away.
I will have you know
that I am very attracted to Andrew.
Well, obviously.
I am. He's...
We are perfect for each other.
He understands me...
Understands you? Wow. What passion.
I didn't hear you mention love.
You are so jealous.
Why would I be jealous of Andrew?
He's got to spend
the rest of his life married to you.
I loathe you.

I loathe you.
I loathed you first.
Wait. What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?
You can't just go around kissing people.
Particularly not engaged people.
You enjoyed it.
You want to kiss again?
Well, I...
No! Stop trying to confuse me.
What's confusing about a kiss?
You're just trying to make me like you
so that I won't want to marry Andrew
and so that you can have the crown. Oh!
Well, maybe I am, and...
maybe I just like kissing you.
You... You stay away from me.
Mia...
You know what?
I have an idea. I have a brilliant idea.
Why don't you go underwater
and I'll count to a million?
Mia, careful... Mia.
Do I want to know?
I don't think so.
I'll be two seconds, Mia.
She's going to be a handful, isn't she?
You'll never be bored, Andrew.
Yes.
Olivia, enough goodbyes.
Yes, ma'am.
Eagle is leaving! Eagle is leaving!
In hushed tones, Lionel.
Hushed tones.
When are you going
to start acting responsibly? 
Hiding in a closet
with a man who is not your betrothed?
Coming out of a fountain dripping wet with
the same man, who is not your betrothed?
Do you think I plan
for this kind of stuff to happen?
I lost it. Sometimes you just lose it.
You can't afford to lose it. Other people
lose it. We're supposed to find it.
People look up to us, and we're
held to higher standards of behavior.
Can you try to grasp that concept?
The concept is grasped.
The execution is a little elusive.
Oh, I would say so.
Try to get some sleep. You'll want
to look fresh for the parade tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night, Grandmother.

Well, Maurice, it's just you and I.
Or are you upset with me too?
Royal Guard of Genovia, fall in. 
Big parade day.
Identify, Mustang personnel.
Why do you talk like that?
I'm Captain Kip Kelly of the Royal Guard.
What if we all talked like that?
Lilly Moscovitz, best friend
of Princess Mia, riding in the 'Stang. 
That was very nicely done, Miss Lilly.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Hi.
The prettiest girl is riding in the 'Stang.
Flag?
Thank you.
Flag? Welcome.
Welcome, Viscount Mabrey.
May I offer you a flag?
Thank you, I am not a waving aficionado.
But I will wave our national flag
when a true Genovian king
once again sits on the throne.
King Nicholas.
Flag?
How do you feel today, my dear?
Honestly, Joe, not that great.
Well, would you feel better
if you called me Joey?
No, Joe.
Good.
Come on, Joseph. We're already late.
Her Majesty is ready.
Can't keep the people
of Genovia waiting any longer.
Happy Independence Day, Genovia!
Here we are in Pyrus, capital of Genovia,
for the big annual parade.
Here they come.

There's Prime Minister Motaz,
strutting his stuff. 
 Genovia, Genovia
People are coming
from all over Genovia. 
Here's the Mertz Marching Band,
led by Lucy Carmichael.
And now, of course,
the Libbet's folk dancers.
Also known as the "Leapers of Libbet."
And now the queen, with Princess Mia.
Nana, I don't like your braids. 
Hey, thumbsucker. 
Stop the carriage.
What... what's going on? Mia?
She's stopped the parade.
How rude.
Uhoh.
What's the princess going to do now? 
She's walking towards
the children's shelter.
Hello, everybody.
Hello, Princess. 
Hello. What's your name?
Carolina.
And what are your names?
John.
Blake.
Did I see you messing with Carolina?
They were tugging on my braid.
Excuse me. These children are?
Most of them are orphans.
We care for as many as possible.
Kissing children. Hugging orphans.
What a vulgar, low,
despicable, political trick.
Carolina.
Would you like to be a princess today?
I can't, I'm too little. Too piccola. 
Oh, no. Because I declare
that anyone can be a princess today.
Well, why don't we get you a tiara,
and you can wave,
and march in the parade?
In fact, why don't you all take tiaras?
All? Give them all free tiaras?
I'll take care of it later.
Thank you.
Yo quiero una verde.
I want a silver one. 
You won't be able to wave
with your thumb in your mouth.
I can wave with this hand.
Very good.
I want the purple one.
I want a crown. 
Can we be in the parade?
Of course, of course. 
We could always use
more princes in the world.
OK, so...
To be a princess, you have
to believe that you are a princess.
You've got to walk
the way you think a princess would walk.
So think tall, you gotta smile,
and wave, and just have fun.
So are you ready?
Yes.
Ah, she's letting the children join her.
How charming.
Not for everyone.
Drumroll, please.
Give the princess a drumroll. 

Forward... 
march!

Just remember, you are a princess.
 I'll spread my wings 
 and I'll learn how to fly 
 I'll do what it takes 
 'til I touch the sky 
 And I'll make a wish 
 Take a chance, make a change 
 And break away 
There you go.
Everybody having fun?
Yeah. 
 But I won't forget 
 all the ones that I love 
 I'll take a risk 
 Take a chance, make a change 
 And break away 
This has been Elsie Kentworthy and former
Miss Genovia, Hildegaard Huffman,
at the best Independence Day
parade Genovia's seen in years.
Thanks to Princess Mia's special surprise.
May the rest of your day be sunnyside up.
And so, gentlemen,
the children from the shelter 
will be housed at the winter castle
in the mountains of Libbet.
The use of the castle as a resort
is sort of a perk
for parliament members and dignitaries.
Exactly.
Oh.
Well, I'm going to deperk it,
and convert it into a children's shelter
until money can be raised
for one of their own.
I feel guilty
having two homes while they have none.
We're going to have
to do something. Where are we gonna ski? 
Lord Crawley, how is your brother doing?
I don't speak to my brother.
Oh.
Well, I've hired him
to be the architect on the project.
Mr. Crawley.
Your Highness.
Gentlemen.
Jerry.
Dean.
Well, I look forward
to getting your notes on these plans.
But no one else's.
Oh, I'll give you
notes, because I'm part...
Oh, no, you won't.
I'm an architect.
I am part of this parliament.
Oh, you just go skiing...
So what if I go skiing?
...and you like to be an outdoorsman.
Oh, and you're a couch potato.
Outdoorsman.
You're a couch potato.
Outdoorsman.
Couch potato. Couch potato.
Outdoorsman. Outdoorsman.
Couch...

The queen approves of the plan,
and I intend to see it through.
Now, gentlemen, I don't think it'll take
too long to raise the money. Do you?
We're setting up
the ramp in the ballroom.
OK.
Hello.
Hello.
My hello's insignificant.
Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, come with me.
So.
Are you crashing my bridal shower?
Sadly, no.
I wanted to tell you that I was very
impressed by what you did at the parade.
Thank you.
I'm having a slumber party.
Congratulations on the children's center.
Thank you. Thank you.
That's wonderful.
She needs to get ready for the party.
She's busy.
Lenny, Squiggy, zip it.
Lilly? The princesses are arriving.
Well, I should go and read my book.
I should go and get changed. Yeah.
That's it.
Bye.
Hello, hello. Elsie Kentworthy here.
Weeks before her wedding, Princess Mia,
in a stroke of skilled diplomacy,
has invited royal princesses
from all over the world
to her bridal shower slumber party.
Hello, Princess Lorraine.
Oh, braces.
Yeah. I'm getting two diamonds put in.
Oh.
That must make it more comfortable.
Hi, Charlotte.
Princess Aimee of Mallorca.
Is this my party?
No, this is Princess Mia's party.
Oh.

So I want thank you all very much
for my fabulous bridal shower presents. 
And now, I have a present for you.
It's time for mattress surfing!


 Time to get the party started 
 Everybody's ready to 
 So let's bounce 
 And it's something new 
 Let's bounce 
 'Cause we all want to 
 Let's bounce 
 Gonna have some fun 
 Everybody, everyone 
 Let's bounce 
 Get the party on 
 Let's bounce 
 From dusk 'til dawn 
 Let's shout 
 Gonna all go there 
 Everybody, everywhere 
 You know we gotta make it bounce 
 I'm ready, baby 
 Let's bounce 

 Let's bounce 

Princess Aimee has to go potty.


 Everything that I got 
 So get me what I want 
 'Cause I'm a big shot 
I think I'll just have some milk
and cookies in my room, Olivia.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Perhaps some earplugs.
Quite a party, darling.
Yeah. We're just having
a little bit of fun.
Oh, Rupert and the boys
used to love doing that.
King Rupert. May he rest in peace.
I did it too, you know.
But a little differently.
Felix?
I thought you never slide.
I don't.
But I've done a lot of flying in my time.

Is she really going to do this?
May I?
Ha!
Tada.
 I've been working at the palace 
 Just to pass the time away 
 Can't you hear the bells aringing? 
 Rise up so early in the morn 
 Can't you hear the bells ashouting? 
 Maids, go do your chores 
And now, to end our little show,
if we all give her a shoutout,
Her Majesty may sing us a song.
Thank you, no.
Queens rarely do karaoke.
Grandma, come on. The song
you sang at my 18thbirthday party.
Remember that? They loved it.
Dear, we had music then.
Mia had a CD made,
so you can sing along.
Clarisse, Clarisse,
Clarisse, Clarisse, Clarisse...
Some girls are fair,
some are jolly and fit.
Some have a wellbred air,
or a wellhoned wit.
 Each one's a jewel, with a singular shine
 A work of art with its own rare design
 Dear little girl,
you are terribly blessed
 But it's your heart
of gold I love the best
 And that will be your crowning glory
 Your whole life through
 It'll always be your crowning glory
 The most glorious part
 Of you

What did you do?
Well, I might have
tweaked it a little bit on my computer.
But I don't know
how to do this sort of thing.
Asana, now.
Grandma, just follow Asana and sing.
 Some boys can walk 
 Some guys can groove 
 Strike an elegant pose 
 Wear the really hip clothes 
 Some seem to have no faults 
 But we never like those 
 No, we don't 
 They'll praise your eyes 
 Your melodious laugh 
 Call you more lovely
than others by half 
 The one who's right 
 My gorgeous prince 
 Will be honest and true 
 He'll believe in me too 
 And prize your heart
of gold the way I do 
 He'll know that 
 that will be your crowning glory 
 Your whole life through 
 Your love will see 
 that it's your crowning glory 
 The most glorious part 
 Of you 
 And you 
 And you 
 And you 
Me?
Go on.
 That will be your crowning glory
 Darling, when they tell your story
 They'll call your heart of gold
your crowning glory
 The most glorious part
 Of you
Gretchen, hot water. 
What are you saying?
Well, she's smart.
And she really cares about Genovia.
Maybe...
Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if she ran the country.
Are you mad?
She believes in Genovia
so much that she's convinced herself
to marry someone that
she knows she can never love.
I can't believe that I am hearing this.
You want her to rule?
After all the effort that we have put in,
to end up with nothing?
It wouldn't be nothing. Genovia would be
in good hands, and she would be happy.
Ah.
You've fallen in love with her.
No.
No, Uncle, all that I'm asking...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you listen.
What do you think will happen?
That she will leave Andrew and marry you?
I put in the effort to make you a king,
not to have you marry a queen.
I will not have it, sir.
Don't worry, Uncle. That will never happen.
Mia doesn't care for me that way.
Oh, but you care for her.
Uncle, I just want us to stop
trying to sabotage her. That's all.
All right. If that's what you really want.
I just want your happiness, my boy.
Go to her.
Congratulate her.
And tell her that we surrender.
Thank you, Uncle.
Elsie Kentworthy, please.

That's enough flaming ones for now.
Are you sure I didn't burn you?
Of course you did.
Look at his coat. 
No, no, it's very minor. 
You just sort of seared the sleeve. Look.
Sorry. 

Lilly?
Yes?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Uhhuh.
Look over there.
Should I shoo him? Should I shoo him? Just
tell me who I should shoo and I'll shoo.
I just want to talk to
Nicholas for a second.
OK.
Backing off, please. Andrew?
Yes?
Why don't you go introduce
Lilly to your parents?
You know, just tell them
I'll be up for brunch in a second.
Yeah, I'd love
to meet Susan and Arnold. 
We can have those tasty
finger sandwiches together.
Would you like some help?
He's not the one she's marrying, is he?
Would you please try to keep up, Brigitta?
He's trying to steal the crown.
Ready?
Mmhm.
Take your stance.
OK.
Elbow down. Just a bit.
Use your mouth as an anchor.
Excuse me?
Touch your mouth.
Good.
Relax this hand.
And breathe in.
Release.
Oh.
How did that feel?
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Turn around.
We should give them some privacy.
I have to go. I really
only came back to pack my things.
You're leaving?
I think it's time I bowed out gracefully.
Don't you?
Goodbye.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Mia.
Could I see you one more time before I go?
Nicholas, I'm watched like a hawk.
Princess, Princess.
See?
I'll find a way.
Yes?
Um, nothing.
I'm just supposed to watch you.

With only two and a half days left, Olivia,
I'm beginning to feel rather frantic.
Would you take
Maurice out for me, please?
I have to check the orchestra selections.
And they asked you to approve a place
setting for the reception, Your Majesty.
Very well.
Our selections
for dancing at the royal reception. 


Have you been thinking about us?
Yes, I have.
I see.
If you'll excuse me.
No, Joseph.
You had to know what I was going to say.
Mia needs me now more than ever before.
It's the monarchy. I mean,
as queen it's my responsibility.
You know how it is.
You were never just my queen, Clarisse.
You were the someone that I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with.
But, if you prefer that I see you
first and foremost as my queen...
I shall oblige.
No, Joseph...
Your Majesty.

Your bed is turned down, Your Highness.
If you don't need anything else, Princess,
we're going to supper.
Oh. Well, enjoy yourselves, ladies.
Ahahah. What did we talk about?
No more curtsy.
We're going to supper.
Thank you.
Hi, Miss Lilly.
May we announce you?
I can announce myself. Lilly Moscovitz!
Mia, look out your window.
Why? What's going on?
Just look out your window.
Prince Charming is throwing pebbles.
Nicholas.
Nicholas, what are you doing?

Rapunzel, Rapunzel, with hair so fine.
Come out your window,
climb down the vine.
The feat you ask, dear sir, isn't easy.
And I won't respond
to that line, it's far too cheesy.
So what does he want?
He wants me to climb down the vine.
Well, do you want to?
Yes.
So go.
It's a recipe for disaster.
Mia, do something impulsive for once
in your life. You're getting married.
Do you want a regular bachelorette party
with 12 screaming girls,
or do you want a stroll in the moonlight
with your almostPrince Charming?
I always like a man in shades.
Oh, Your Majesty.
No, no, ladies.
Come in, come in.
I was just about to leave.
This really is more romantic in books.
My foot is stuck.

Oh, what was that?
 Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques
 Dormezvous? Dormezvous?
Your Majesty, we never got to finish
our routine at the slumber party.
And there's more dancing, too.
 Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques
 Dormezvous? Dormezvous?

And there's a big finish.
Yes, the big finale.


I'm sorry. Did I hurt you again?
No, I... I'm used to it.
 Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines 
 Ding, dang, dong 
 Ding, dang, dong 
What a pity we missed it at the party.
I'll cover for you.
Go, Rapunzel, go. 
Tell me
your greatest desires. 
Tell me a secret. 
Isn't that the same?
Almost.
But anyone can see your desires.
No one knows what's in your heart.
Tell me something.
Um...
I love I Love Lucy reruns.
And sometimes I dream in black and white. 
I used to pretend I was sick
when I had a test in school.
We all did that.
OK.
Sometimes, I put chocolate milk
on my cereal.
I am deathly afraid of jellyfish.
I haven't danced with you
since your birthday.
That's a fact. It's not a secret.
The secret is, is that...
I still want to.

 Love me tender 
 Love me sweet 
 Never let me go 
 You have made 
 My life complete 
 And I love you so 
 Love me tender 
 Love me true 
 All my dreams fulfill 
 For, my darling 
 I love you 
 And I always will 
Good morning.
Good morning.
Hello.
We stayed out all night.
Yes, we did.
We stayed out all night.
Is that...
There's a man in that boat.
What?
Do you see that?
There's somebody over there.
He's probably some fisherman, I suppose.
With a video camera?
What?
You're really low.
No, Mia.
I have no idea who that man is.
You know, it's really a shame he didn't
get juicier stuff last night, you jerk.
Mia, I have nothing to do with this.
I swear.
Mia, please. Come on.
Will you listen to me?
That is not my boat.
Hey, Nicholas? Have a nice life.
But that is my horse. Mia...
Mia? Hello?
Good morning, my love.
I know it's a little early,
but I've been thinking.
Things have been so pressured lately.
I was wondering
whether we should spend...
Lilly?
Good morning, Your Majesty.
What... What are you doing here?
I just wanted...
Mia.
Doors.
What's going on?
Princess, I think you should see this.
And here's
the royal exclusive I promised. 
After generations
of boring royals who never misbehaved, 
Genovia finally has a worldclass scandal. 
Proving that we should have
brought in an American long ago. 
Will Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth, 
still marry such
a naughty, naughty princess? 
Or will Lord Nicholas Devereaux
be the new king? 
It's out of the frying pan
and into the fire for Princess Mia. 
Keep your eggs sunnyside up. 
I'd like to tell her
what she can do with her eggs...
Lilly.
Could we have a moment alone?
Yes.
So?
I got played.
Aha.
Do we still have a wedding?
Andrew, I am so, so sorry.
Excuse me.
Andrew, please wait.
I promise you nothing happened.
Yes, but Mia,
you still went, didn't you? You went.
I don't think you understand. I'm an
extremely eligible bachelor in England.
I really am. I've got plenty of friends,
lots of lovely women friends, and...
I still think this marriage is a good idea.
Mia.

The queen would not approve of spying.
Ah.
So?
Anything?
I really want to say yes, but no.
There's just, there's no...
spark.
Me too.
Really?
Really.
I mean, it was pleasurable.
Very.
Very pleasant, but,
but, but no fireworks.
None.
What are we gonna do? Look, we will...
We will figure something out.
Mia.
You chose me.
No privacy.
You chose me, and I accepted.
And a gentleman
never backs out on his word.
We are going to...
We're going to stand up in church and say
"I do," and tomorrow we'll be man and wife.
And you are going to make
an amazing queen of Genovia.
Thank you.
I'm getting married today.
She's getting
married today, Maurice. 
Your Highness, we're running very late.
Grandma says the queen is never late,
everyone else is simply early.
Your Highness, a strange woman came in
and said that she wanted
to hide in your closet.
So I let her.
Well, dear, that probably
wasn't the wisest decision in the...
Now, this is what I call a closet.
Mom.
Oh, my darling.
Careful. We're squashing Trevor.
Hi.
Hi, Trevor.
He's sleeping. Shh.
He is the most beautiful baby brother.
We were joking.
We knew it was your mother.
Your stepfather's here too.
Now, I'm your mother, it's your
wedding day, I have to say something.
Being married is about being yourself,
only with someone else.
Thanks, Mom.

How are you feeling? You look beautiful.
I'm... Well, I'm...
You look so calm.
I'm a little...
Paolo is back to turn
a caterpillar into a butterfly.
There she go, butterfly.
Paolo.
Coat off. I tell you, when I say
"butterfly," the coat comes off.
Principessa Mia.
Paolo. 
You remember my mother, Helen.
Piacere. 
The hairdresser.
And a new baby. Monella. 
All Italian men love baby except Paolo.
You got to get out now,
because we have to go to work.
Five years ago,
Paolo take you from that to that.
Today, he give you this.
A wedding look for the bride.
I look like a moose.
Yes, but a very cute moose.
Make all the boy moose go...

I have antlers.

Go.
I look like a poodle.
That's just the way I feel.
Here we go again.
Good. Sit up.
She kind of does look like a poodle.
I like it.
This time I'm so sure,
I use my own pictures.
So. Un, deux, trois. 
Gretchen?
I can't find my gloves. 
You go on. I think it would be better
if I didn't go to the wedding.
My boy.
Don't give up so easily.
Come to church. Sweep her off her feet.
In a week or two, she'll be yours.
The game is over, Uncle.
She's going to marry Andrew.
Ah, you're so right. Ah, well.
This is a disaster in the making.
Wouldn't miss a moment of it.
I'll try to catch the garter.
The royal carriage approaches. 
What did he say, Artie?
The princess is coming.
Showtime.
Suki Sanchez here from the USA.
A long way from home,
but happily following a story
that started in the streets
of San Francisco,
and is about to have a happy ending here
in the small, beautiful land of Genovia.
Prepare for the arrival of Princess Mia.
Psst. Sir.
I don't mean to talk out of school,
but there's something you must know.
Your uncle called Elsie
and set you up with that video.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I should have known.
He's up to something.
He was much too delighted
that you aren't going to that wedding.
I must get to that church.
Yes, yes, but how?
Everything on four wheels
is already rented for the wedding.
Doesn't matter, I'll run.
No, no. It's too far.
No, no. You'll take the bike.
The bike? Gretchen, what bike?
We don't have a bike.
Your grandfather's bike.
Buenas tardes, Tanya.
Buenas tardes, su Majestad. 
Aquí le presento a mi tío,
que nos visita de Rosario. 
Oh, how do you do, señor?
I do better if you and I get married.
I'm sorry. My uncle learned his English
watching the old Three Stooges movies.
Sorry.
Yes, well...
You're not going to believe this.
Lord Devereaux's riding
up the road on a bicycle.
Sir! 
Sir, may I borrow your horse?
Oh, he needs my horse.
My bike is yours. 
How am I supposed
to herd sheep with a bike?
Outspoken American activist
Lilly Moscovitz, the maid of honor,
glides forward as a vision in pink.
I'm a girl who loves black
and is wearing pink.
Aww. 
And Duke Andrew's
little nephew, Viscount Ludlow, 
affectionately known
as "James of the Cherub Cheeks,"
comes down the aisle
as the royal ring bearer.
Hey, Joe.
Hm?
I just wanted to say, before I do this...
I'm sorry you're retiring.
Who told you that?
The maids know everything.
Well, the heart does things
for reasons that reason cannot understand.
You're preaching to the choir.

Princess?
Yes?
And you should know that Nicholas
did not set you up at the lake.
Are you sure?
The maids know everything.
We're ready when she is.



Is this part of the plan?
No.
I...

I'm going to need a minute or two.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Now the bride is moving
swiftly back up the aisle and out the door. 
Let me.
Not the traditional route. 
Princess Mia! 
Princess Mia!
Mia!
Helen.
Honey, I'll be right back.
I gotta change Trevor's diaper.
Please, be seated. There'll just be
a momentary interlude. Thank you.
Do we rush after her?
No, we never rush. We hasten.
You'll take care of this?
Yes, yes. Yes, just one moment.
Out of my way. 
Oh, my dear. Mia.
Oh, Grandma, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I... I just need a minute.
No.
I can do this.
No.
I can't do this.
I know.
Darling, listen to me.
I made my choice.
Duty to my country over love.
It's what I've always done, it seems.
It was drummed into me my whole life.
Now I've lost
the only man I ever really loved.
Anyone
got a 20 on Joseph? 
I'm with the
eagle and sparrow. 
Mia, I want you to make
your choices as a woman.
Don't make the same mistakes I did.
Make your own mistakes.
There'll be plenty of them, believe me.
Now, you can go back into that church
and get married, or you can walk away.
Whatever choice you make,
let it come from your heart.
Excuse me.
She's back.
The princess
is reentering the church. 
She's walking down the aisle.
More like cantering down the aisle.

Andrew, wait.
Everyone deserves the chance
to find true love, right?
Yes.
Including us?
Thank you.
For, for, uh...
saving me from doing
the proper thing for once in my life.
Now all I have to do is tell Mummy.
I have to tell everyone else.
Good luck. 
Helen.
Welcome.
A few moments ago, I realized
the only reason I was getting married
was because of a law, and that
didn't seem like a good enough reason.
So...
I won't be getting married today.
Sit. Sit. There may be a dinner.
My grandmother has ruled without a man
at her side for quite some time, and...
I think she rocks at it.
So as the granddaughter
of Queen Clarisse and King Rupert...
King Rupert. May he rest in peace. 
I ask the members of parliament
to think about your daughters,
your nieces, and sisters,
and granddaughters,
Would you force them to do
what you're trying to make me do?
I believe I will be a great queen.
I understand Genovia to be a land
that combines the beauty of the past 
with all the best hope of the future. 
Not now.
Shh.
I feel in my heart and soul
that I can rule Genovia.
I... I love Genovia.
Do you think that I would
be up here in a wedding dress if I didn't?
I stand here,
ready to take my place as your queen.
Without a husband.
Viva Mia! 
Every time...
Every time this charming
young lady opens her mouth,
she demonstrates a contempt
for the customs of Genovia.
The law clearly states
an unmarried woman cannot be queen.
Fortunately,
there is another heir.
No, there is not.
I decline. I refuse to be king.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Princess Mia
who should have the crown.
She's bright, and she is caring.
But more importantly, she has a vision.
One that will take Genovia forward,
and if the parliament were astute,
they would name her queen.
Listen to her.
She'll lead us into the 21st century.
And besides, just think how lovely
she'll look on our postage stamp.
Lovely on a postage stamp?
You would look lovely on a postage stamp!
Don't you walk away from me, sir!
You have a duty, sir, to Genovia.
He's, uh... he is very distressed.
Your duty, sir, to the country! To me, sir!
To Genovia! For your father! Nicholas!
The door.
Shut the doors, quickly.
Nicholas. Nicholas!
Nicholas, I cannot have you
giving all, all this up just for a girl.
Now, look, we can still...
Enough, Uncle.
We're finished.
What is happening here?
Who's next in line for the throne?
The Von Trokens?
We accept.
Sit down.
Make a motion. 
Are you OK? Do you need a...
Make a motion. 
Ah.
Prime Minister?
Yes, Princess?
I move to abolish the marriage law,
as it applies to present
and future queens of Genovia.
Will anyone second my motion?
Keep eye contact with them.
Stare them down.
No, not, not... Soften. Soften.
Good.
I second the motion.
It's time we had a new tradition.
I like change.
I may grow a mustache.
I think you'd look marvelous
with a mustache.
You know, my father
always favored a Van Dyke...
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.
All those in favor of abolishing
the marriage rule, say, "Aye."
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
You're not in parliament. Sit down.
Someday.
Aye. 
The ayes have it.
Congratulations, Princess.
If I may say so myself,
you rule!
Lionel.
Your Majesty?
Hm?
The princess would like a word.
Oh. Erm...
Grandma?
Just because I didn't
get my fairytale ending,
doesn't mean you shouldn't.
Oh, uh...
Did you hear that?
Not if you didn't want me to.
Oh, Charlotte.
Well.
Joseph?
Your Majesty.
Dear Joseph.
Am I too late...
to ask you to accept my hand in marriage?

Well, I thought you'd never ask.
Shades?
You're in charge now.
Good luck with Lionel.
I'm going to a wedding.
Open up, I say! The door is shut. 
Let me in. 
Put me down. Put me down! 
I know it was short notice,
but you were all dressed.
My Lord Archbishop, I would like to take
this man as my husband, if you please.
Finally.
We have come together
for a different wedding...
What did I miss?
She's not getting married.
She's not getting married?
No.
With this ring, I thee...
finally...
wed.
Now the queen's getting married.
The queen's getting married?
Yeah, to Joe.
I pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
The ceremonial shooting of the
flaming arrow through the coronation ring. 
Good morning. It's been
almost a week since the almost wedding, 
and busy workers
are setting up for Genovia's grand day.
The coronation of a new queen. 
Somewhere in the palace, Princess Mia's
getting ready for the ceremony 
that will change her life forever.
So what do you say, Fat Louie?
Think I'll make a good queen?
Indeed you will.
If I may be so bold, I would like
an audience with Your Highness.
What is your dilemma, young man?
You are, in fact.
I'm in love with the queentobe.
And I'm inquiring if she loves me too.
Do you have a chicken for my table?
No. No, my kitchen is out of chickens.
Ah.
Mia.
Company, atten... hurgh! 
Forward march.
Left, right, left.
Left, right, left.
Left, right, left.
Left, left...
Left, right, left.
Left, left...
Left, right, left.
Left, left...
Company, halt.
I heard you're going back
to Berkeley to finish up graduate school.
You heard right.
May I call you in California?
I think I can hear you
without a phone, but, uh...
Sparrow is taking off.
The eagle is flying for the last time.
She looks beautiful.
They both do.
Will you solemnly promise and
swear to govern the people of Genovia, 
according to the statutes
in parliament agreed on,
and the respective laws
and custom of the same?
Will you, in your power,
cause law and justice and mercy
to be executed in all judgments?
I solemnly promise so to do. 
 Genovia 
 The land I call my own 
 From the green clear summers 
 Present arms. 
 From blossoming pear trees 
 Magnificent her mountains and seas 
 Genovia, Genovia 
 You're noble, proud and brave 
 Genovia, Genovia 
 Forever 
 Will your banner 
 Wave 
Presenting Her Majesty 
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi,
Queen of Genovia.

 This is my time to shine 
 This is my place to find 
 All that I have inside 
 I never knew 
 Can dreams come true 

 I decide how I live 
 I decide who I love 
 Choice is mine and no one 
 Gets to make my mind up 
 I decide 
 I decide where I go 
 Where I sleep, who I know 
 I'm the one who's running my life 
 I decide 


 Say it all, or not at all 
 Don't want to hear 
 what you're really feeling 
 Forsaking the meaning 
 Take away the words I say 
 Realistic thoughts that I'm dreaming 
 Are you believing? 
 Tell me what I wanna do now 
 How far do 
 You see the soul? 
 My truth is spoken whether 
 Or not you want to hear it 
 I'm sorry 
 Don't worry, though 
 Don't you ever say never 
 Or turn away 
 Say it all, or not at all 
 Don't want to hear 
 what you're really fearing 
 Forsaking the meaning 
 Take away the words I say 
 Realistic thoughts that I'm dreaming 
 Are you believing? 
 Tell me what I wanna do now 


 Staring out at the 
 rain with a heavy heart 
 It's the end of the world in my mind 
 Because you live and breathe 
 Because you make me believe in myself 
 When nobody else can help 
 Because you live, girl 
 My world 
 Has twice as many stars in the sky 
 Because you live, there's a reason why 
 I want to give what you're giving me 
 Always 
 Because you live, girl 
 My world 
 Has twice as many stars in the sky 
 Because you live 
And don't forget, the next time
you're planning a family vacation, 
consider visiting Genovia. 
A country of majestic mountains
and sunbaked beaches, 
filled with friendly, peppy people. 
Come see us. Genovia awaits you.
