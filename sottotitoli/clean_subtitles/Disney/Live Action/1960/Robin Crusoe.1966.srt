LET'S NOT LOSE OUR HEADS HERE.
I DON'T NEED COMIC BOOKS.
I DON'T NEED
THE GAS MASK, EITHER.

WHATEVER THAT IS.
NOW, LET'S DO IT
THE WAY ROBINSON CRUSOE
DID IT
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.
STILL MAKES SENSE.
YOU TAKE THINGS
OFF THE SHIP
IN THE ORDER
OF THEIR IMPORTANCE.
A STORM COULD COME ALONG
AND TAKE THE BOAT
RIGHT OFF THE REEF
AND SINK IT IN DEEP WATER.
TOOLS.
NEED PLENTY OF TOOLS.
CANDLES.
BLANKETS.
OH, CAN I USE BLANKETS.
GOSH, THESE LITTLE JAPANESE
HOUSES ARE SURE CUTE.
THEY'RE SIMPLE, TOO.
HEY, FLOYD, I'LL BET
WE COULD BUILD ONE OF THEM.
LET'S SEE.
"WE STRIPPED THE SUBMARINE
OF TOOLS AND MATERIALS,
"AND BORROWING SOMEWHAT
"FROM THE TINKER TOY SCHOOL
OF ARCHITECTURE,
"WE FINISHED
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
"IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE
A DOLLHOUSE WITH A HANGOVER,
BUT WE WERE PROUD OF IT."
"WE NOW HAVE A NEW ADDITION
TO THE HOUSEHOLD.

YOUR FOOTPRINTS
WHEN YOU WALK
THROUGH A SAND TRAP?
IT'S ONE OF THE CARDINAL RULES
OF PLAYIN' GOLF.
YOU REPLACE YOUR DIVOTS
