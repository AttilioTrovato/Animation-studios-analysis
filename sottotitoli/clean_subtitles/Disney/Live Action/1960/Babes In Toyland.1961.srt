Hello, everybody.
My name is Sylvester, Sylvester J. Goose.
My friends call me Syl, or sometimes Silly.
At this time, it is with unmitigated pleasure...
Sylvester, talk faster.
Talk faster?
You're lucky to find a goose who can talk at all.
As I was saying, it is my pleasure to present
your hostess for this occasion, weighing 189 pounds...
Sylvester!
I present the one and only Mother Goose.
Thank you, Sylvester.
Blabbermouth.
I'm here to invite you to a celebration in our village.
Tomorrow is the wedding of Tom and Mary.
2 of my closest friends.
I know.
So put on your best smile, set free your imagination,
and come with us to Mother Goose Village.
Sylvester?
All right, boys, open the curtains!
 Down in the square 
 in the Mother Goose Village Square 
 all the people gather 
 when there's some excitement in the air 
 see how they run 
 for they always have lots of fun 
 exchanging bits of gossip 
 and the news of everyone 
 come join the crowd 
 you'll be happy and mighty proud 
 to be welcome where so few outsiders 
 ever are allowed 
 you'll mingle with the people 
 you'll meet everybody there 
 down at the village square 
 here comes bopeep 
 who is never without her sheep 
 there's Jack and Jill 
 who have tumbled down the hill 
 come and meet the people and see what's in the air 
 down at the Village Square 
 Jack be nimble, Jack be quick 
 do your trick with a candlestick 
 Simple Simon met a pieman 
 going to the fair 
 show us, Simon, what the pieman 
 demonstrated there 
 lemonade 
 let's have a lemonade 
 fill your cup and join us 
 in the grand parade 
 be aware 
 tomorrow's big affair 
 is the wedding in the garden glade 
 good neighbors, soon we'll see 
 man and wife to be 
 dancing with each other so contentedly 
 to youth and love 
 may neither ever fade 
 to Tom and Mary 
 drink a lemonade 
Tom!
Mary!
 Lemonade 
 let's have a lemonade 
 here's to all the bright and lovely plans they've made 
 drink to life 
 their long and happy life 
 while they face the future unafraid 
 good neighbors, here we see 
 groom and bridetobe 
 beaming at each other oh, so trustingly 
 may all their dreams come true and never fade 
 to Tom and Mary 
 drink a lemonade 
fie on you, you frivolous fools.
Your tide is at the surge.
Today you sing a happy song.
Tomorrow... A dirge!
Fah!
You see, unbeknownst to Mary, she inherits scads of money
when she marries.
Thus it carries, that if I'm to get my hands on Mary's money,
the person Mary marries must be me.
Not Tom, me.
I must do away with Tom.
Gonzorgo!
Rodrigo!
Come, let us plot.
Ow!
Idiots!
Now, gentlemen, it is said you'll do anything for money.
You see, your infamous reputation is widespread.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Barnaby.
Now make note while I plan this little caper.
Mark this down.
Mark this down.
Item one... item one... Kidnap Tom.
Kidnap Tom.
No, no, kidnap him.
Item 2... Item 2...
Throw him in the sea.
Throw him in the sea.
No, no, just throw him in the sea.
Item 3... item 3... Mary's sheep. Hmm.
These sheep support her.
Somehow I must thwart her.
She's much too independent with them.
Therefore, she must be without them.
Steal the sheep.
Steal the sheep.
No, steal them.
Aaanything else, Mr. Barnaby?
That's all for now, gentlemen, and, uh,
when this deed is through, this tidy stipend is for you.
A pittance. Preposterous.
This experience should make us wiser.
We do not do business with a miser.
Come, Rodrigo.
We are wasting our time.
Behold, my mercenary friends.
Does this satisfy your greed?
Oh, indeed it does.
Indeed it does.
Gonzorgo, Rodrigo, let us scheme.
 I embezzle and I swindle 
 and I keep 2 sets of books 
 and the income tax collector 
 always gives me dirty looks 
 now the thought of Mary's money 
 has a very strong appeal 
 so underhandedly I've planned 
 another shady deal 
 and I won't be happy 
 till I get it 
 unwittingly some papers she will sign 
 she will never have a hint 
 that in the finer print 
 her inheritance is mine, all mine 
 we enjoy committing mayhem 
 for a monetary gain 
 and we specialize in crimes 
 which are completely inhumane 
 now we're on our way to steal some sheep 
 and drown the boy at sea 
 and then directly we'll collect 
 a very handsome fee 
 and we won't be happy till we get it 
 in some lagoon, a body soon will splash 
 we're eager to proceed 
 to do this evil deed 
 just as long as we are paid in cash 
 we're an awful gruesome threesome 
 and we're rotten to the core 
 of the jobs we pull, you'll see some 
 that will make you hate us more 
 whether larceny or murder 
 makes no difference what the crime 
 we'll forge a check or cut your neck 
 if we can make a dime 
 and we won't be happy till we get it 
 oh, what a shame 
 they'll hate our name in town 
 but what are we to do? 
 unhappily, it's true 
 we'll take anything that's not nailed down 
 and we won't be happy till we get it 
 Mary, Mary 
 quite contrary 
 how does your garden grow? 
 with silver bells 
 and cockle shells 
 and pretty little maids 
 in a row 
shh.
Did you bring the mallet?
Good. Now remember, you hit him on the head with the mallet,
and I'll put him in the sack. Is that clear?
Not now.
He isn't even here yet.
Now, we'll wait until they...
Get ready. Get ready!
Shh. Here they come.
I wonder if he'll try to kiss her.
 I've been dreaming 
 through the long, lonely past 
 dreaming 
 I would find you at last 
 locked in my arms 
 ever to stay 
 just a whisper away 
 now we're here, love 
 with that moment 
 in view 
 here, love 
 and it's all coming true 
 all that I've dreamed 
 day after day 
 just a whisper 
 away 
 all my love dreams 
 are at last coming true 
 love dreams 
 binding me close to you 
 locked in your arms 
 ever to stay 
 just a whisper away 
 time is near, love 
 when our lives will entwine 
 dear love 
 soon you'll vow to be mine 
 all that I've dreamed 
 day after day 
 just a whisper away 
he's just trying to bite her.
Come now, it isn't nice to eavesdrop.
 Time is near, love 
 when our lives will entwine 
 dear love 
 soon you'll vow to be mine 
 all that I've dreamed 
 day after day 
 just a whisper away 
 doubledealing, doublecrossing 
 this are things that we adore 
 there are many types of treachery 
 within our repertoire 
 now we're on our way to take young Tom 
 and throw him in the sea 
 and then directly we'll collect 
 a very handsome fee 
 and we won't be happy till we get... 
Look, Rodrigo, a gypsy camp.
Gypsies, eh?
I've heard it said that gypsies buy babies.
I wonder if they'd be interested
in purchasing this fine, strapping youth.
Rodrigo, I have an idea.
Why don't we sell Tom to the gypsies,
and that way, collect for him twice, understand?
Listen, Barnaby is paying us to get rid of Tom.
But if, instead of throwing Tom into the sea,
we sell him to the gypsies, we'll be paid for him again.
Once by Barnaby and once by the gypsies.
Can't you see that?
Right!
 Now, this young man could fetch a fancy price 
 why throw him in the sea? 
 we'll trick old Barnaby 
 and we'll find ourselves collecting twice 
to the gypsies!
 We won't be happy till we get it 
 no, we won't be happy till we get it 
 yes, we won't be happy till we get it 
 no, we won't be happy till we get it 
Mother Goose, will Tom admire me in this gown?
Land sakes, child, he'll just adore you.
I think it's beautiful!
What if it rains?
But it's a bright, sunny day!
Suppose Tom forgets the ring.
Oh, now Mary, don't be funny.
Well, it could happen, you know.
A friend of mine was get... Hush, Sylvester.
I hadn't finished.
Sorry.
Hand me a pin, Sylvester.
Thank you.
Now, let's see.
There's something borrowed, something blue.
Uhoh.
Good day, friends.
And here's something old and ugly, too.
Ah, what a charming bride.
The sweetest and the loveliest I have ever seen.
Why, that oily... Hush, Sylvester.
Thank you, Mr. Barnaby.
May I offer you my best wishes
for your future happiness and joy?
You miserable, miserly... Sylvester, no.
For lunch, I had roast goose!
Aah!
That's the way we lost mother.
Would you please excuse us?
We have so much to do.
Ah, yes, of course.
The preparations for the wedding, and... Oh, what's that?
Come on!
Some small excitement.
This is Mary's cottage, sir.
Oh, thank you, my dear fellow.
Rodrigo, take care of this lad.
No, no, don't hit him, tip him.
Oh, thank you.
My word, 2 shipwrecked sailors.
Sailors?
Whatever are they doing here?
I... I can't imagine.
Now remember, we are sup...
My friend and I would like to know,
are you Miss Mary quite contrary?
Yes, sir, I am she.
Well, uh...
We don't know how to tell you this, Miss Mary.
No, we don't know how to tell you this at all.
We were 20 leagues at sea.
It was calm as it could be, when out of the north,
there came a sudden squall.
He was standing at the wheel, he was, Miss Mary,
and across the deck, the mighty ocean roared.
Then the mizzen broke and fell, and we heard the fellow yell
as it bashed him down and swept him overboard.
 Slowly, slowly 
 he sank into the sea 
 though we tried to save him 
 he sank into the sea 
but who, sir?
Who sank?
Oh, it was Tom, ma'am.
Tom sank.
Tom sank?
Tom sank?
Who's Tom sank?
What preposterous rumor are you spreading, sailor?
Go on your way!
Unless... You have some evidence?
Some proof of what you say?
Oh, yes, sir.
What proof do you have?
We are bringing you his personal belongings,
and in his hat we found this soggy note.
Though the salty ocean spray somehow washed the words away,
I'll see if I can't decipher what he wrote.
"Darling Mary", he begins, or is that "dearest"?
Yes, that's the term he uses, we agree.
Now, the boy goes on to tell
how he hopes this finds you well.
It's too bad he slowly sank into the sea.
 Slowly, slowly 
 he sank into the sea 
 with no life preserver 
 he sank into the sea 
but this was to be our wedding day.
Why would Tom be at sea?
Does this letter offer some explanation?
I presume he's written more.
Oh, yes, sir.
"I am poor", the letter reads, "and can't support you,
"and it's best I sail away "and set you free.
"Noble lady that you are, "you'd be better off by far,
if you were to marry wealthy Barnaby."
We advise you to forget him now, Miss Mary.
Our condolences to you, we do extend.
But we'll blame you not, my dear,
if you care to shed a tear,
for the way he met his most untimely end.
 Slowly, slowly 
 he sank into the sea 
 to the very bottom 
 he sank into the sea 
how about that?
Oh, my poor, brave Tom.
Sacrificing his life for my welfare.
Ohh!
Oh, poor Mary.
Come, children, in the house.
There's something fishy about this!
Hush, Sylvester.
Well, I wouldn't trust either one of them.
The fat one or the idiot.
Well done, boys.
Now for item 3.
Item 3, steal the sheep.
On your way.
Gentle Mary, so griefstricken and remorseful.
Oh, to see you thus is more than I can bear.
Erase your sorrow now.
Be resourceful for yourself
and those poor children in your care.
Take advantage, my dear, of my infatuation!
May I point out you are deeply in my debt?
I could seize your home through legal confiscation!
Oh, I do hope you don't take that as a threat.
Feast your eyes upon my mansion, tall and stately,
and imagine it a castle, dear, in Spain.
Come, my love.
For I'd admire it greatly
that you be my queen and live in my domain!
No!
 In our castle in Spain 
 you'll be living rentfree 
 every capital gain 
 you'll share with me 
 from this village below 
 every cent we will drain 
 and our fortune will grow 
 in our castle in Spain 
 every mortgage and lease 
 I will revaluate 
 and for you I'll increase 
 their interest rate 
 you'll eat nothing but cake 
 you'll drink naught but champagne 
 you'll be in on the take 
 in our castle in Spain 
 surely you must agree 
 that it makes your head whirl 
 to be marrying me 
 you lucky girl 
 you have caught me today 
 in a generous vein 
 come now, what do you say 
 to our castle in... 
Spain?
No.
No?
No, thank you, Mr. Barnaby.
I don't want your castle.
I'd never marry just for wealth alone.
And even though Tom may be gone, his memory I'll keep.
I'm sure that we can carry on with the income from our sheep.
Your sheep?
Yes, of course.
Our sheep.
My sheep! My sheep!
Our sheep!
Bopeep, what's the matter, darling?
Our sheep, they're lost.
Oh, no. They can't be lost.
Have you looked in the fields?
Did you search the hills?
Yes, I've searched everywhere.
 My sheep are gone 
 for good 
 there goes 
 our livelihood 
 I'm sure my poor 
 sweet fleecy things 
 would come home 
 if they could 
 but they are lost 
 you see 
 as lost 
 as lost can be 
 and I must weep 
 because my sheep 
 cannot return 
 to me 
 no, oh, no, they're not gone for good 
 yes, oh, yes, they are gone for good 
Oh, no. Oh, yes.
 Oh, no 
Oh, yes!
 Never mind, Bopeep 
 we will find your sheep 
 wherever they may roam 
 dry your tears, Bopeep 
 have no fears, Bopeep 
 very soon, your sheep will be home 
 for a while, Bopeep, try to smile, Bopeep 
 and keep this fact in mind 
 when they're ready to 
 they'll come home to you 
 wagging their tails behind 
Bopeep!
Bopeep!
Bopeep!
What is it, Bobby?
I know where the sheep are.
You do?
Yes. I followed their tracks, and you know where they led to?
Where?
To The Forest Of No Return.
The Forest Of No Return?
The Forest Of No Return?
Oh!
Well, thank you anyway, Bobby.
I think it's a slick trick, a rotten plot!
Miss Mary.
Yes, Mr. Barnaby?
Remember my offer.
I'll be awaiting your decision... My dear.
Oh!
Now she'll have to reconsider... Yes, even this very night.
Well done, gentlemen.
Not now!
Tomorrow, when the swelling goes down.
Be in my attic when the bank opens.
Don't worry about anything.
Just try to get some sleep.
Everything's going to be all right.
Come on. Get into bed now.
What's the matter, darling?
I'm so sorry I lost the sheep, and I know it's my fault.
Don't worry about the sheep.
They'll find their way home.
You'll see. Come on... Get under the covers.
Good night, children.
Good night, Mary.
Shh.
Bills, bills, bills.
 The price of milk and eggs and bread 
 is rising every day 
 now with our bankbook in the red 
 these bills are hard to pay 
 if we stop buying chocolate cake 
 and lived on green string beans 
 exactly how much would it take 
 to live within our means? 
 put down beans and cross out cake 
 let me see, oh, dear me 
 what a job to undertake 
 milk plus bread, oh, my head 
 add, subtract, and multiply 
 till you're overcome 
 this is much too hard for us 
 we can't do the sum 
 the stove and rugs and furniture 
 will soon be repossessed 
 this makes me feel quite insecure 
 and mentally depressed 
 would we be better off somehow 
 by living in a tent? 
 how can I pay the mortgage now 
 and save the 6 percent? 
 picture us inside a tent 
 beastly poor, insecure 
 we must save the 6 percent 
 6 times X, how complex 
 numbers always stick our brain 
 why are we so dumb? 
 this is much too hard for us 
 we can't do the sum 
 I'm not a great financial whiz 
 of that there is no doubt 
 the outcome of our income is 
 our income's all gone out 
 if we walk on our hands with care 
 instead of on our feet 
 would what we save on shoe repair 
 suffice to make ends meet? 
 walking on our hands with care 
 off our feet, make ends meet 
 saving on our shoe repair 
 leaving holes in our soles 
 what should we be adding to 
 or subtracting from? 
 this is much too hard for me 
 I can't do the sum 
 looks like there's no hope for me 
 I can't get 
 out of debt 
 if I marry Barnaby 
 that's the end, why pretend? 
 am I doing right or wrong? 
 my heart feels so numb 
 no use trying anymore 
 I can't 
 do 
 the sum 
she just can't marry that nasty old Barnaby!
She mustn't! She can't!
Say, if we go and find the sheep and bring them home,
then she won't have to marry Barnaby.
But the sheep are in the forest of no return!
What's the matter? You scared?
No! No!
All right, then let's go!
Hear ye, hear ye.
A meeting of the town!
Hear ye, hear ye!
All assemble!
All assemble!
An important announcement!
Hear ye, hear ye!
A meeting of the town.
Hear ye, hear ye!
All assemble.
Friends.
You are gazing at a happy man.
If he's happy, I'm a chicken.
Shh!
I'm about to take a bride.
Tomorrow, this little lady will become Mrs. Barnaby!
Mary?!
I'm sure we'll both be happy.
Will we not, my sweet?
Oh!
Poor Mary.
Ooh, I'd like to belt him!
Shh, Sylvester!
To sing and dance and entertain you,
I have hired a band of gypsies.
I'm sure they'll brighten up this happy occasion.
And...
Ah, here they come!
 Gypsies, we are the gypsies 
 and we are here today and gone tomorrow 
 cheerful, we're always cheerful 
 our life is nothing but a happy song 
Rodrigo, you realize these are the same gypsies we sold Tom to?
Shouldn't you be smiling, my dear?
 A wandering vagrant am I 
 a product of sheriffs' 
 evictions 
 a gypsy by birth 
 I have roamed half the earth 
 telling fortunes 
 and making predictions 
 my skill 
 is a magical art 
 I'm not just 
 the usual Swami 
 I don't entertain 
 with fake Legerdemain 
 and my breath doesn't reek 
 of salami 
 Floretta, Floretta 
 the gypsy is here 
 in telling your fortune 
 she's made a career 
 your past and your future 
 she quickly can see 
 she knows all that has been 
 and what is to be 
 Floretta, Floretta of brilliant renown 
 it is your good fortune that she is in town 
 the past and the future 
 I quickly can see 
 one glance at your palm 
 and it's all known to me 
ah!
 Come forward, my lovely young maid 
 your name, as I make out 
 is Mary 
 I see in your palm 
 you are lonesome for Tom 
 crying over his obituary 
but your darling Tom is alive!
What?
What?!
Yes!
 And I can see much love 
 and laughter 
 this line of your life 
 shows that you'll be Tom's wife 
 and forever live happily 
 aaaaaafter 
 Floretta, Floretta of brilliant renown 
 it's Mary's good fortune 
 that she is in town 
 her past and her future 
 she quickly can see 
 she knows all that has been 
 and what is to be 
 now, this is the palm of a cad 
 a sly reprobate and a mean one 
 corrupt and malicious 
 conniving and vicious 
 a scoundrel 
 if ever I seen one 
 he seeks a young maid for his wife 
 while plotting her sweetheart's 
 abduuuuction 
 the crimes he's involved in 
 will one day be solved 
 and result in his 
 utter destruction 
 Floretta, Floretta 
 of brilliant renown 
 old Barnaby's sorry 
 that she came to town 
 observe now, dear friends 
 and please try to stay calm 
 goodbye to Floretta 
 and hello 
 to Tom 
Tom!
... Tom 
hide!
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Going somewhere, boys?
No.
No.
Where are you, sheep?
Here, sheep.
Where are you, sheep?
Here, sheep. Here, sheep.
Here, sheep! Come on, sheep.
Where are ya?
Here, sheep. Come on, sheep.
Come on, sheep.
Come on, sheep.
We're lookin' for ya.
Here, sheep. Where are you?
Here, sheep. Come on.
Here, sheep. Where are you?
Here, sheep. Where are you, sheep?
Look, Mary.
A note.
"Dear sister Mary, please do not marry.
"Let that old Barnaby burn.
"We've gone with Bopeep to look for the sheep
in The Forest Of No Return"!
Forest Of No Return?
Oh, those poor children in that dreadful forest!
We must go after them at once.
I hope we're still in time!
Now, gentlemen, you insidious idiots!
You stumbling fumblers!
I don't mind a doublecross and I don't mind a triplecross,
but see that you execute no quadruplecross,
for this, to me, is insincerity.
Now... this time I want no mistakes.
I want Tom disposed of!
As for Mary... Leave her fate to me.
Come, let us pussyfoot.
Here, sheep.
Please come home.
Here, sheep.
Here, sheep. Where are you?
Please, sheep, come here.
Please come home. Here, sheep.
Here, sheep.
Sheep... sheep... Here, sheep!
Hey!
Say!
 Can't you read, can't you see? 
 this is private property 
 aren't the signs plain and clear? 
 no one is allowed in here 
 but since you're here, you should know 
 we will never let you go 
 you can cry, you can shout 
 but you can't get out 
 this is The Forest Of No Return 
 this is The Forest Of No Return 
 those who stumble in 
 those who fumble in 
 never can get out 
 we have come seeking sheep 
 now, alas, you're in too deep 
 we don't mean any harm 
 you have caused us great alarm 
 then we'll be off, on our way 
 sorry, but you'll have to stay 
 we will cry, we will shout 
 still, you can't get out 
 this is The Forest Of No Return 
 this is The Forest Of No Return ¶
 you have stumbled in 
 you have fumbled in 
 now you can't get out 
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Tom, quick, this way!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Mary! Mary!
Thank goodness you're safe!
We were so worried about you.
And look who's here.
Tom!
Hello, Willie.
Tom, you're back!
Tom! Tom, you're back!
Tom, you didn't drown!
No, no, I'm fine, just fine.
But how are you? Are you all right?
Yes, we're all right.
But we didn't find the sheep.
We'll find the sheep later.
But right now we're going to take you home.
No, Mary, I think it's too dark to travel any more tonight.
I think we should settle down right here for the evening,
till morning, anyway, then we'll look for the sheep.
Oh, we can't leave anyway. We're captured.
You're what?
We're captured.
Yeah.
The trees captured us.
The trees captured you?
What trees?
All these trees.
Oh, they're all right. They're just a little tired.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
The trees captured you.
All right. Let's look for a nice spot to settle down
until morning. How 'bout here?
Come on, settle down.
 We saw trees that walk 
 try to get some sleep 
 they could even talk 
 not another peep 
 and they sang a song 
 while they danced along 
 children, quiet, please 
 let's forget the trees 
 we're not telling lies 
 I will take your word 
 they had evil eyes 
 darlings, that's absurd 
 and they raised a fuss 
 and they threatened us 
 children, we suggest 
 that you get some rest 
 go to sleep 
 slumber deep 
 drift away 
 on fleecy clouds 
 above 
 you 
 close your eyes 
 sail the skies 
 nestle gently 
 near the ones 
 who love you 
 go 
 to sleep 
 go 
 to sleep 
all right, boys.
Let's go. We'll sneak up...
Shh!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, everyone! Come on, wake up!
Wake up! Come on, wake up!
Wait a minute! What's going on?
See? We told you about these trees.
What's the meaning of this? Explain yourselves!
Well, he wants an explanation!
The explanation is... That you are out of bounds.
These are restricted grounds.
You're not supposed to be here!
Didn't you read the signs?
But... but what are you going to do with us?
What will be done with you the toy maker will decide.
The Toy Maker?
Naturally!
You are on Toyland Property!
Toyland?
Toyland!
Toyland!
Settle down! Quiet! Quiet!
 'Twill do no good to fight 
 we warned you not to fuss 
 we firmly and emphatically 
 demand you come with us 
 yes, we demand you come with us 
 you'll have to take us in 
 straight in 
 to Toyland, must we go? 
 quite so 
 are you inclined to change your mind? 
 unanimously, no! 
fall in. Line up.
Forward march!
 Toyland, Toyland 
 beautiful girl and boy land 
 while you dwell within it 
 you are ever happy there 
 childhood's toyland 
 wonderful world of joyland 
 wouldn't it be fine if we 
 could stay there for evermore? 
 Toyland, Toyland 
 we're on our way to Toyland 
 don't know when we'll get there 
 but we know there's fun in store 
 Toyland, Toyland 
 wonderful girl and boy land 
 once you leave its borders 
 you can never return again 
 this is as far as we go 
 here's where your troubles begin 
 go down to the Ridge and over the bridge 
 and all of you turn yourselves in 
not yet, boys.
The odds will be better when they're sleeping.
We will wait till nightfall.
Come... let us lurk.
Come on, come on! Hurry up!
Mr. Toy Maker, Mr. Toy Maker, open the door!
Open the door! Please!
Kids, kids.
They must be closed.
Yes, look.
"Closed for alterations."
What's over here?
Come on!
Gee, I wonder what's inside.
Hmm. Looks like Toyland has been deserted.
Mr. Toy Maker.
It came from over there.
Oh, Mr. Toy Maker, it's all ready, sir.
For goodness sake, Grumio, you know I'm busy!
But there's something I...
Listen, I'm working on a new invention.
This is fantastic.
What... what is it?
What is it?
I'll tell you what it is.
What is the first thing a boy does when he gets a new toy?
Well, I... I'll tell ya.
He takes it apart to see how it works.
But with my invention, he doesn't have to do that.
The toy is already broken.
I made that up myself, you know, in the other room there.
Mr. Toy Maker... Oh, was there something you wanted?
Yes, there's something I want to show you, sir.
Please, please come with me. Please.
This is my new invention.
This is your invention?
Yes, sir.
How do you like it, sir?
Oh, fine, fine. It's awful nice.
Very nice. You do very good work, Grumio.
Very good. Beautiful.
Oh, just a minute, sir.
Don't you want to see how it works?
How what works?
My invention!
This does something?
Oh, yes, sir. It certainly does!
It makes toys.
It does?
This is my new toy making machine.
You'll never ever need these hand tools again, sir.
This is the latest concept in automation!
Here, let me explain.
Let's say we wanna make a doll.
Let's.
Now, first we have to diagram the problem
for the machine on the occiligraph, you understand?
Just make a doll. That's all.
Make a doll. Yes, sir.
Now we select the ingredients.
Uh... blue eyes, blonde hair, smiling lips.
Oh, and suppose you want to make it a girl doll...
Um... sugar... and spice... Everything nice.
One doll, demonstration purposes at slow speed.
And now, automation takes over!
Is that so?
Look!
Oh, that's wonderful!
This is astonishing!
Simply astonishing!
A real doll!
Grumio, this is amazing!
Oh... thank you, sir.
Can this machine make a toy boat, too?
Toy boat coming up, sir.
Now I'll make a boat.
Uh... hull, decks, smoke stacks, lifeboats...
And we'll need, uh... There's a mast and a poop deck...
Stop mumbling.
Make the boat. Make the boat.
We'll run this one at, uh... medium speed,
and once more, automation reigns supreme!
This is overwhelming!
A doll! A boat!
Oh, my machine can make anything, sir!
Grumio... You are a genius.
Thank you, sir.
And now, to work.
And now, as we have a deadline to meet,
I will start the machine at full production.
Uh, just a moment, Grumio.
You'll start the machine?
Oh, no, you won't.
I'm the head toy maker here.
I'll start the machine in full production.
You're just my assistant.
Will you please step aside?
If I need any help, I'll call you.
Here. Hold these, please.
If I want you, I'll call you, Grumio,
or I'll call you assistant.
It depends entirely on the mood I'm in.
Now, let me see. We need some wagons,
we need marbles, we need dolls.
We could use some roller skates.
Children love roller skates, you know.
Some parcheesi sets... I think you're overloading it, sir.
I think about 4 million each to start with.
4 million?!
And I think we'll start at super speed!
Pick that up, assistant.
Hoo hoo hoo!
Oh, that's just remarkable!
Ho ho ho, hoo hoo! My!
Oh, my!
What's this thing here?
No, Mr. Toy Maker, please, get out of there, sir, please!
Really remarkable.
You're making it very difficult, sir.
Please don't touch anything else!
Oh! This is wonderful!
Hoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo... Stop that, Grumio!
It's real!
Oh! Hoo hoo hoo!
Oh, Grumio! This one's broken!
Get a little glue.
Hurry up! Oh...
There's something wrong, Grumio!
Grumio!
Do something fast!
There's something wrong here, Grumio.
Look!
I think something's wrong!
Stop that thing! Grumio!
Grumio, come here!
Grumio, look out!
Look out, Grumio!
Look ooooout!
You know something?
I think we should go to lunch.
This is catastrophic!
My goodness!
I'm ruined!
Absolutely ruined!
Grumio.
Grumio!
Grumio!
Grumio!
Oh, there you are. You are alone responsible for everything...
Just you and you alone!
Did you say that your invention
was to make toys or to make noise?
Go! Get outta here!
Go on! Go to your room
and invent something to destroy yourself!
This is horrible!
I'll never make that Christmas deadline now.
My, my, this is... This is terrible!
Just awful.
I, uh, I beg your pardon, sir.
Why, who are you?
Well, my name's Tom Piper, and... What are you doing here?
We came to see you.
Who are you?
She's my sister.
Well, you shouldn't be here!
Don't you know that it isn't right
for children to see these toys until Christmas day?
These... we... well, we... We had a lot of toys around here.
But you can see... Well...
This is the only toy in the whole factory that isn't broken.
We're really very sorry, Mr. Toy Maker.
Yeah, thank you.
But what are you doing here?
We're arrested!
The trees said for us to report to you.
Well, naturally, you have to report to me.
I'm not only the head toy maker, I'm also the Mayor of Toyland
and the chief of police.
We noticed you have quite a problem, sir.
Yes. Quite a problem. Yes.
Well, is there anything we can do to help?
Halfpast October.
The deadline near.
The children will have no Merry Christmas.
Mr. Toy Maker, we're strong, and we're willing to work.
I think we'd make a fine assembly line.
And we'd work day and night, wouldn't we, children?
Yes! Yes, sure!
Please, please let us help you.
You wanna work?
Nobody wants to work these days.
It's not automation, sir, but we've got our hands to use.
Well... Maybe I could try it. Ha.
What have I got to lose?
All right, folks. I'll put you to work.
I've been such a dope.
As long as there are people, we should never give up hope!
Yay! Yay!
First we have to clean up that assembly room.
Come on. We haven't got a moment to lose.
 Painting eyes on funny faces 
 putting on a smile or frown 
 come now, there's lots of orders coming in 
 bolting wheels on axle braces 
 so they never will break down 
 children 
 we need 600 more of these, you know 
 cutting, sewing, pressing dresses 
 every little doll gets one 
 putting curls in all their tresses 
 isn't it a lot of fun? 
 Christmas coming   things are humming 
 busy, busy   in a tizzy 
 hurry, hurry, hurry

 hurry, hurry, hurry till we're done 
 gluing legs on chairs and tables 
 never any less than four 
Say, you! Please pay attention to your job!
 Cows and goats for tiny stables 
 put a dozen in or more 
Willie! This is no time for foolishness!
 Packing, pounding, fitting, nailing 
 every little thing must run 
 some for flying   some for sailing 
 isn't it a lot of fun? 
 Christmas coming   things are humming 
 busy, busy   in a tizzy 
 hurry, hurry, hurry till we're done 
 we must not waste an instant 
 hurry, hurry, hurry till we're done 
 quack, quack, quack, quack, chick, chick, chick, chick

Oh, that's good!
 We should be happy when we work

children, this was a magnificent day's work.
Magnificent.
Let's all wash up, and we'll have supper.
Then early to bed, kids, so we'll be
nice and fresh in the morning.
My goodness! You're all so industrious!
You know something?
I think we're gonna make the deadline after all...
Thanks to you children.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Toy Maker!
Come on, kids. Wash up now.
Aw! I'm not tired!
Up, up, up.
Night is about to fall.
Come.
Let us pussyfoot.
Shh!
Come on, now. Into bed.
I like making toys.
You can make them, but you mustn't keep them.
Aw... Good night.
Good night, children.
Good night, Mary.
Go to sleep.
Shh...
 Smiling eyes, golden hair 
 made with such loving care 
 she's just a toy 
 what a thrill it will be 
 when she's found 'neath the tree 
 by some little girl 
 Christmas morning 
 and her true life will start 
 when she's taken to heart 
 with childhood joy 
 and you'll never believe 
 all the love she'll receive 
 though just... 
 a toy 
 I'd love to see 
 'neath my Christmas tree 
 one special doll 
 meant for me 
 smiling eyes, silken hair 
 you'll need such loving care 
 you're just 
 a toy 
 you were planned and designed 
 with one person in mind 
 to hold you and keep you 
 forever 
 and you'll live for the love 
 and the happiness of 
 this lonely boy 
 and each night he will say 
 in a whimsical way 
 you're just 
 a toy 
quickly, now's our chance.
I got it! I got it! I got it!
Mr. Toymaker! Where's Mr. Toymaker?!
He's in his room asleep.
I've got to show him something.
I've got to show him my new invention!
Mr. Toymaker, Mr. Toymaker, please, wake up, sir.
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!
Just a minute, sir. Please, wake up.
This is my new invention.
What?
My new invention.
This is another one of your inventions?
Yes. Shoot me.
Oh, please, sir. Wait a minute.
This is my... this is a scientific triumph.
It's a biochemical breakthrough.
Sir, please, my new formula for toymaking
is even better than automation!
It's better? Yes.
Good night.
Oh, please, sir, please, please.
Let me demonstrate this. This really works.
Get back, get back. Please, get back.
This is very, very dangerous.
Watch closely, sir.
Big chair...
Toy chair.
Poof. Just like that?
Just like that.
A big table...
Toy table.
This is provocative! Give me that thing.
Oh, careful, sir. This is a very dangerous compound.
2 molecular discharges will result in complete obliteration.
Observe.
Very interesting.
Oh, I see.
Poof, but not poof poof.
That's correct.
Let me poof that thing.
Oh, no, sir, no, no, you mustn't, sir.
One thing you must and should remember:
I am the head Toymaker.
You're just my assistant.
Mr. Toymaker, maybe you shouldn't.
That's a very dangerous... Have you seen our new invention?
Don't aim it at them, sir.
Oh, wait'll you see it make toys.
It makes wonderful... But it's very dangerous.
You'll have to stand back, please. Stand back there.
Stand back a little.
Big desk...
Toy desk.
Now I'm gonna show you... Oh, please, don't point that, sir.
Well, wait till you see what I'm gonna do now.
Big bed...
Toy bed.
Oh!
This is simply wonderful!
Now I can make thousands of toys at one time.
Grumio, you are a genius.
Tommy!
Mr. Toymaker... Listen to me, Tommy.
Isn't this a wonderful way to make toys?
Yes, sir, it is.
It's a wonderful invention, sir, but...
Where are you going to get the big things
to reduce to small things?
Where are we gonna get the big things
to reduce to small things?
Good question, sir.
I think so.
Well, I think we could always, uh...
I don't know.
You are a nutwit.
You and your stupid inventions.
Go! Go to your room!
Instantly!
Silly invention.
I knew it wouldn't be any good the moment I saw it.
Whoever called you a genius?
Poof on this poof gun!
I think I can use this poof gun.
You and your nutty ideas.
Waking me up in the middle of the night
when all I wanted was a little sleep.
My goodness.
This is only good if my foot's asleep.
What happened here?
I'll show you what happened.
Must be me.
That grumio's got me so confused.
It's terrible.
I need sleep so much.
My goodness. Grumio.
Who are you?!
Tom! Mary!
Who are you?!
Get out of here!
Come, little one.
Do you realize that gun has reduced a human being?
Tom! Mary!
Get out of here!
What's going on here?! Put me down!
Let me down, you monster, you ogre!
There, there, little fellow.
No harm will befall you.
Fact is, I'm going to need you.
I want to go to sleep!
What's going on here? Let me down!
Put me down, you monster, you ogre!
I just want to go to sleep!
Ah, yes.
There, little fella.
There's a safe place to keep you till I need you.
This gun will make our job much easier.
Now for our next victim... Tom.
Follow me, boys.
Please, please, don't let him do that to Tom.
Stop!
I beg your pardon?
After talking things over, we have decided
not to take part in your diabolical plan.
Consider us no longer in cahoots.
Furthermore, we are going to expose you to everybody.
Won't you reconsider?
Not a chance.
Gentlemen.
Now, there's no use in talking about it.
We want nothing more to do with...
Ohh, Mr. Barnaby! Please, Mr. Barnaby!
You wouldn't shoot us, would you?
Oh, Mr. Barnaby! Please, sir!
Peekaboo.
Please, please, go away, Mr. Barnaby!
Go away!
Please, leave us alone!
Good evening.
Mr. Barnaby.
What are you doing here?
I've come for you, my dear.
How dare you come into my room?
Tom! Tom!
No need to scream.
Your little Tom is quite closeby,
and I do mean your very little Tom.
Oh, no.
No.
I will now at last have your hand in marriage.
Never. Never!
Never!
May I remind you that just a little overdose of this...
Stop, stop!
I'll do anything you say.
Of course you will.
Come, my dear.
Now, if you folks are ready.
Are you ready, dear?
Are the witnesses ready?
And the best man?
Now, by the power vested in you as the Mayor of Toyland,
proceed with the marriage ceremony.
We are gathered here to witness this young lady
making her first step toward unhappiness.
She's gonna marry you.
What?
I was just trying to liven things up with a little humor.
Never mind the humor. Perform the ceremony.
We are gathered here to unite this man
with this poor, unfortunate girl n marriage.
Do you, Barnaby, take Mary to be your wedded wife,
to keep her in sickness, in adversity, in poverty, in tragedy,
in disaster... What are you doing?
Well, I was just trying to talk you out of it.
I'm warning you.
Do you, Barnaby, take Mary to be your wedded wife?
I do.
Are you sure you don't want to think this over?
I do not!
No, I can see that you don't.
Now, do you, uh, uh...
Do you, Mary, take this man to be your wedded husband?
I do.
That's funny, I take him to be your grandfather.
Would you stop this infernal stalling?
On with it! On with it!
Oh, for heaven's sake. Such a dreadful temper.
I'm glad I'm not marrying you.
Oh, I am marrying you, but I'm marrying you to her.
Now, where was I?
will you hurry up?
I want to get married.
All right, all right.
Now, uh, let me see now.
Yes, there it is.
Will you please tell me what the trouble is now?!
Oh, all right. Just a minute.
It won't be a minute.
Uh, we are gathered here...
Come on!
Drummers, forward!
Now, let me see... Where was I?
You were right here!
Oh, oh, heh, yes. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
What's that?
They're playing the wrong music.
Well, get on with it anyway.
On with it!
All right.
Forward march!
Eyes right!
Where are my glasses?
They are on your head!
Oh, so they are.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And let's have no more of these delays.
Now take her hand.
Now comes the good part.
If there is anyone... Any man,
or any woman, for that matter...
Who has good reason why this marriage
should not take place,
let him... or her if, you know... Whichever it is,
let them speak or... Stop!
Barnaby, you scoundrel, unhand that girl!
Look. Look who's run away to become a toy soldier.
Take cover, Mary.
Buglers!
Fire!
Fire!
All right!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Give 'em a broadside!
Fire!
Fire!
Ohh!
Sound the charge!
Fire!
Infantry, attack!
Give 'im a broadside!
Fire!
Oh, my toys!
My toys!
Now for the toy general.
Watch out, Tom!
Fire!
Oh!
Bombs away!
That's enough of this horseplay.
Tom, look out!
This is better.
Mr. Barnaby!
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Barnaby!
Come on, Barnaby. Fight like a man.
Look out, Tom!
Tom!
I've got it! Oh, I've got it!
Mr. Toymaker!
Here I am.
Grumio, I'm down here!
Well, sir, it appears that you need a shot
of my new invention, my restoring formula.
Grumio.
Yes, sir?
You are a genius.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, Grumio!
How about us?
Take care of my friends.
My friend and I would like to thank you.
Grumio, please, help Tom.
Anything you say, Mary. Where is he?
Here I am.
You can't seem to get it through your thick skull that I...
Am the head toymaker, and you are just my assistant.
Now you got it. Heh heh.
Step aside.
Allow me.
Darling, you were so brave.
I'm so proud of you.
What's going on?
What's all the noise?
Oh, you've been playing with the toys.
That's right, children.
We've been playing with the toys.
That's right.
We were just playing with the toys.
 Tom and Mary
