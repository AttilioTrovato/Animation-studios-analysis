Get ready for room service,mate, and girls.

Nobody is gonna stop us. Right.
George of the Junglemust be halfway to Frisco by now.
Ah, but the plotting poacherswere only half correct...

Yes, Mother, l'm safe. You're sure you didn'tcatch dengue fever?

Ooh!
So, what do youthink of my jungle?
This very high tree house.
Good place to call friends from.Sound carry.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
The neighbours.
Give it a rest! We're ten storeys up, George.
l don't think the animalscan make it up here.
Oh, sure.George know that.
George know that.
You must be tired. l'll, um...
make the couch up for youto sleep in the living room.
Oh, no. George sleep herein tree house.
Okay. Good night.
Sleep sweet, Ursula.
Sleep sweet, George.
Ooh.
Well, Ursula's fianceis in prison...
and there's a jungle mansleeping on her balcony.
She could use a best friend right now. Hi.
Hi. l got here as fast as l could.
Where is he? He's under the waterf__He's in the shower.
Not any more.
George. Oh. Bad waterfall.
First water get hot, then George slipon this strange, yellow rock. Oh!
Hi. George of Jungle. Charmed, l'm sure.
George.Um, take this big book.
Whoop! Cover the booty,get into decent clothes.
Sorry, Betsy. Bye. No problem.
Okay. l see why they made himking of the jungle.
Betsy, l amin trouble here, okay?
How am l gonna tell my parentsthat my fiance's in an African jail...
and that l brought homea jungle man?
You are totally stuckon George, huh?
No, l am not!
Can l have him then?Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.
Think, think, think, think,think, think, think, think.What am l gonna do about tomorrow?
Tomorrow is your engagement party,and unless they give day passes...
out of Bujumbura Jail,Lyle is not likely to attend.
So tell 'em the truth and don'tworry about it and take George.
He can back up your story. Right? Yeah. All right.
So l'll tell my dadfirst thing in the morning.
Make it second thing. First thing, lsuggest you buy jungle man some clothes.
Nice butt flap.
Being of a conservative mindregarding gender roles...
Ursula Stanhopewasted no time...
in taking George of the Jungleto a fine haberdasher.
And this is Neiman Marcus. Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.
Hello. Would you liketo sample our new fragrance?
Thank you.
Later, in the men's department, afterdiscovering his longlost brothers...
the jungle king was pleased to findhe looked pretty good in Armani.
Pretty darn good.
Watch out, man!
Why everyone run around crazy,like antelope in mating season?
They're just trying to make a living.lt's__ different kindof jungle here, George.
lt's survival of the fittest.Dog eat dog.
''Dog eat dog''__ Dog eat dog here? No, that's not what l meant.
George never bring Shep here.Uhuh. Never.
Every story gets to have a really bigcoincidence, and here's ours.
Who should see them walking downthe street but Ursula's meddling mother?
Uh, yes, uh, Lyle Van de Groot,please.
l'm sorry. He's not back from Africa. He's not?
No. l'm sorry.
Meanwhile, back on Ape Mountain...
George's friends were going positivelygaga from missing the jungle king.
No!
Oh, look at this.lt's ruined. Ruined!
Shep, come here at once.
Come on!
How many times do l have to tell you?My violin bow is not a chew toy!
Bad dog!
And you! Out of my sight,you feathered fool.
No! Not on the tree house!l'll smack you__
Ursula, it's Mother.Pick up the phone...
and tell me who that man wasl saw you strolling with today.
And where is Lyle?We must discuss the engagement party.
l know you're there, Ursula.Pick up the phone and tell mewhy you have been avoiding me.
Pick up the phone!
Well, l think thatwas an overreaction.
Just make sure you stay herewhile l'm at work...
and you can watch TVand eat and relax.
And l'll be back as soon as l can.Just stay here.
''Stay here''? George is kingof the jungle. No four walls builtby modern man can contain him.
Not true. George have every intentionof doing exactly what Ursula say.
Really? ls that so? For a while.
And at that very moment,Betsy and Ursula were on their way tobreak the news about Lyle to her father.
Good luck, kiddo. Surprise!
Ursula, welcome home,sweetheart...
and happy engagement day.
Chock Full O' Nuts
The heavenly coffee
The coffee that brings you together. When you're in love
Now George understand. George getcoffee, then Ursula want George.
Javajavajavajava,javajavajavajava,javajavajavajava.
So the low has moved offshore.High pressure's built a ridge in.
The weatheris absolutely gorgeous.
lf you're not outside, you oughta be! Who, me?
l mean you. Oh.
Okay!
And so, jazzed on java...
George of the Jungle made his wayinto the city by the bay.
Whoo!
Quickly taking to tourism,the jungle king enjoyed...
the first drivethroughdining of his life...
and strolled the city streets untilhe found something so scintillating...
he had to say: Ooh!
But nothing excitedthe jungle king more...
than the sight of the biggestrope bridge he had ever seen.
Ooh. Yeah.
Help! Ooh.
Somebody help!
To swing or not to swing? Help!
Swing.
As the king of the junglequickly calculated the angleand velocity of his next big swing...
Ursula felt like jumpingoff a bridge herself.
l feel so guilty.l don't know what l'm going to do.
First thing: l suggest you tell yourfather what you came here to tell him.
Hi, Daddy. Hi, honey. Take a look at this.
The most remarkable thingis happening on the Bay Bridge.
...where strong windshave carried him to the Bay Bridge.
Our own Valerie Devlinis live on the scene. Valerie?
Thank you, Terilyn.We do have a breaking story...
at the Bay Bridge... Help! where a parasailor dangles...
helplessly, 500 feet above the water. Please! Hurry up! Help!
There's no word on whothis lone daredevil is.
That's George. He appears to have some kindof rope in his hand.
He might be preparing to swing on it. l gotta go.
Excuse me, sir.l have to get on this boat.
Hey, fella. George of Jungle.Need a vine?
Hey, thanks a lot, man.GGet me out of this stuff, huh?
Thanks, man. Oh, don't mention it.
King of jungle only here to help!
George! Ursula! Ow!
Watch out for that__
George! Ursula! What are you doing? Are you okay?
You just saved that man's life! George just lucky, l guess.
Ooh. This coffee stuffreally work good.
...one of the most daring rescuesever recorded live on television.
This is Valerie Devlin reportingto you from under the Bay Bridge.Back to you, Terilyn.
You know, they say the city by the bayis the most romantic in the world...
and it looks as thoughthere might be a little romanceunfolding under the Bay Bridge.
We'll be back in a moment. Ohh.
Meanwhile, back in the jungle__
There's five stinkin' apes out there.Which one are we takin' to Vegas?
The one who's playing chess. Checkmate.
Yes! Sweet dreams, banana breath. Grab him!
Tookie. Go find George.
TookieTookie.
Thor.
Let's get him in the cagewhile he's still under. Come on.
As the pesky poachersgrunted and groaned...
pushing and pullingthe ponderous primate along...
the trusty TookieTookie birdwas already winging to the rescue...
making a birdlinefor San Francisco...
where George of the Jungle was tryingto give the heiress Ursula...
the courage to face her parents...
by helping her discoverthe juju within.
Make jungle call.Then you'll feel brave. No. l can't.
Come on. Big breath.Here. Support voice. NNo. No, no, no.
Ursula, please? Pl__ Please? No, no!
l can't do it. Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.Come on, Ursula.
Wow. Not bad for beginner.
Hi, Ursula. Emboldened with jungle juju... Hi.
Ursula Stanhope went insideto break the news to her parents,who took it extremely well.
Mother, Daddy,l love you both very much.
l have somethingvery important to tell you...
and l hope you'll understand.
l don't want to marry Lyle any more. We understand, dear.
Just kidding.
The young Miss Stanhopeproceeded to spill the beans... So, anyway, l went to the jungle__
very quickly...
until she got tothe important part at the end.
Then Lyle shot him. So Lyleis in jail and George is with me...
and l don't want to marryLyle any more.
l knew it. lt's that swinging manfrom the bridge.
l saw you smooching on TV.
Mother, we weren't smooching__ How could you do this to me?
Don't you realize the calibre of peoplewho are going to be here?
Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say__ l thought we would beintroducing them...
to Lyle Van de Groot, not somewild man you found in the jungle.
Beatrice, this is supposed to beher wedding, not yours.
So? Beatrice, l know you're upset...
and so am l, but we can't force herto marry someone against her will.
Why not? Mom. Dad.
l'm ready to go out thereand apologize to everybodyand tell them what really happened.
Absolutely not!
As far as l'm concerned, you__you caught one of those viruses.
Yes, one of those dreadfuljungle viruses...
that get nice girls all confused.
And if Lyle survives thatawful jail, you will simplyhave to kiss and make up.
As for this evening, we will holdour heads high and we will carry on.
Now, darling, where is that charmingyoung friend of yours?
Well, where is he? l don't know.He's around here someplace.
Well, find him. We haven't gotall day. Oh, Ursula, look! Oh, great!
How wonderful!And look at Richard's exquisitefigurines of you and darling Lyle.
George, watch out for that__
Mom. Dad. This is George.
Hello, Mr and Mrs Ursula.
How do you do?
lt is always such a pleasureto see you, Mr Mayor.
And, you know, it's so niceto get away from City Hall...
and be around some normal peoplefor a change.
Well, we are perfectly normal,l assure you__ in an exceptional way,of course.
Of course.AAnd what about this guy, Lyle?
You know, l'd really like to meetthe man you deem good enoughto marry your daughter.
Oh, well, unfortunately Lyleis busy at the moment...
uh, tending to some legal affairs.
Some pate, Mr Mayor? You know, l never touch that stuff. Oh.
l had a lovely time. Would you excuse us, please? Excuse me, Dr Goldblum.
lt's 7:30. Do you know whereyour jungle man is?
So this is what you were doingin the jungle. Clever girl.
Yeah. Um, he swung me on vinesand fed me coconut milk.
l knew it. He's not a real meat loaf, is he?
No. l mean,he's not brainy...
in that doctor, lawyer,banker way...
but he has something else.
He has a__ Sensual intelligence.
''Sensual intelligence.''
Wow. Oh, my God.
What is it with chicksand horses, huh?
George, how are you this evening?
Pretty sharp threads there,uh__ George, right?
Yeah. Where're you based? The jungle.
l hear ya.We cut our teeth in New York also.
Eh, you considering a positionwith Stanhope? That could be fruitful.
Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.Nobody here have big coconuts.
George.
l wa__ Oh.
Would you mindstepping outside with me__
Thank you so much__for just a moment?
Sure.
Hello, Beatrice. Hello, Ella.
Well, we haven't been friendsfor very long, George...
but l already think l knowsomething about you.
Oh? You are in love with my daughter.
Oh, Mrs Ursula not so dumb. George.
My concern, however, is that Ursulaseems to reciprocate your feelings...
and that does presenta problem to me.
You see,you and Ursula together...
would be unbefittingher social stature.
You see? Let me put it in a wayyou might understand.
Where you come from...
zebras marry zebrasand leopards marry leopards.
Stripes with stripes,spots with spots.
Well, Ursula is a stripeand you are a spot...
one which l intend to have removedas soon as possible.
So you no want Ursulato love George.
l would rather have my tongue nailed tothis table every morning at breakfast.
That hurt. Not as much as you willif you do anything...
to screw up my daughter's marriageto Lyle Van de Groot.
When Lyle returns, this weddingwill proceed as planned.
lf you do anything to upset that...
l will remove your reasonfor wearing a loin cloth.
Steak tartare, Mrs Stanhope?
Oh, no, no. Thank you.l've had quite enough protein for today.
Have a pleasant evening,Mr Jungle.
Tookie? Tookie!
Tookie.George so happy to see Tookie.
Ape kidnapped?Ape apenapped?
George save Ape!
Ursula.
Well, of course he went back to thejungle. Where else would go__ the Hague?
But why would he leavewithout saying goodbye?
Well, personally l think he actedrather sensibly. Showed good character.
He understands that he belongs there,you belong here.
lt's really all a questionof stripes and spots.
What? Oh, no.
You got to him.Mother, what did you say?
l simply said that if hereally cared for you...
he'd leave you alone and let youget on with your life and marry Lyle.
l am not marrying Lyle, Mother. Beatrice, perhaps we should just__
Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,don't be ridiculous.
There's a big differencebetween marriageable materialand a fling in the jungle.
''A fling in the jungle''?''A fling in the jungle.''
Who says l hada fling in the jungle?
You don't think you canfool your mother, do you?
You've been head over heels for that apeever since you brought him here.
Now, Ursula, that kind of loveis fleeting. You'll get over it.
Did you just say ''love''? No.
You did. Ursula. You're right.
Don't say it. l love him. l'm outta here.
Ursula, you can't love him.Arthur, say something.
Be careful out there, honey. What?
Goodbye, Daddy. l love you.
Wha__ l love you, Mom. Thank you.
Ursula__ Arthur, do something! What would you have me do?
There's obviously no stopping her. Oh, God.
Ursula! God, that woman's a pain in the ass.
Meanwhile,halfway across the world...
another ass was feeling pain...
as an ape named Apewas caged in a cage...
hoping to hearthe jungle king's awesome__
Hey, l'm pretty good at that__
and wonderingif he would ever come.
But the motionsick mammalneedn't have moaned...
for that defender of the innocent,protector of the weak...
and allaround good guyGeorge of the Jungle...
was closer than he knew.
Next time George get bigger box.
Oh! Bad luck.
Did you hear something? What?
l heard a noise. Shut up and push!
Oh, l think l chipped a tooth.
Oh, Thor, you're disgusting. God, that wasn't me.
Not me.
l'm hungry. Oh, shut up.
You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,and l'm gettin' mad enough to__
You know, you really shouldwork on your anger.
Have you tried Brankowski's''Cage the Rage'' technique?
Don't let him get to you, Thor.He's just an ape.
That's a fine way to talkto your meal ticket.
You keep that up, it's liableto affect my stage performance.
Give him a banana, Thor.lt won't be long now.
That's what you said yesterday.
This trail's taking usto the middle of nowhere.
The sign at the trail head said''Short cut to Ape River.''
Now, why would it say ''short cut''if it wasn't a__
Wait a minute.Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.
Very good, Max.Actually, the trail is a fake.
lt circles Ape Mountain six times beforeheading right back to the tree house.
Ohh! Oh, l knew we was lost. Don't listen to him, Thor.
He's just tryin' to trick us,lead us off the short cut...
so we take twice as longon the regular trail.
We're already taking twice as long!
Are you gonna let a monkeymake a monkey out of ya?
What? Duh!
Let's go. lf he tells us the short cutleads to the tree house...
then that's exactlywhere it doesn't lead.
Ape?
Poor apenapped brother. Careful.
Max, look.We're back at the tree house.
Well, l tried, but you fellasare just too smart for me.
Oh, no! ''Oh, no'' was right,for the exhausted apenappers had__
Hey! Why don't you say somethingconstructive for a change,like what we should do now.
Because l don't like you.Well, l hate you, you snotty son of a__
l'll pretend l didn't hear that.Having some fun now, hmm?
Thor, were you fightingwith the narrator? Well, he started it.
Did not. You did too!
Did not. You did too! Did not!
You did too! Thor, stop it! Ohh.
That's it. l'm not draggin'this thing another inch.
What are you doing? Get back thereand work. Where are you going? You wretched little weasel.
Aren't you the little weasel,you big brontosaurus?
Let's take care of him. Huh? Huh?
Whoa!Why didn't you come sooner?
Why Ape have little starsaround head?
George, remembereverything l taught you aboutQueensberry rules and fighting fair?
Uhhuh. Well, now's a good time to forget it.
Let's finish him off.
Oh, l can't breathe, Max. Let it out, Thor. Let it out.
Right, jungle boy.
Huh? Huh?
TookieTookie!
Take this! Stop it! Ape!
Get it off!Get it off of me, Max!
All right!
Shep, look out!

Only that l know in my heart...

Haven't seen the light yet. Lyle.
Lyle? Yes, Lyle.
For the venal Van de Groot had escapedfrom the Bujumbura jail...
and joined an obscure culton the shores of Lake Tanganyika...
which had empowered him witha peculiar piece of parchment.
What are you doing here? Surprised, my little cupcake?
You see, l'm nowan mailorder minister...
ordained the Church of CelestialPower and Light, lncorporated...
capable of performing legally bindingmarriage ceremonies anywhere.
Lyle, l'm not marrying you. Actually, you are.
Come on, let's go.Come along, my little African queen. George.
Now George really mad.George tear off your__
At ease, jungle boy. Everybody freeze now!
Operation completedas ordered, sir.
Thank you, Gunnar, Gunter,Hans, Jan and Phil.
No hard feelings, stone belly.
The best man won.That's all.

Okay, honey, you ready to go? l gota boat waitin' to take us to Bujumbura.
Come on. George! Ursula.
Come on. No! Don't go that way!
Go that way. No__ See you later.

George, what l came here to saywas that l love you.
Ursula love George? So much.
George love Ursula too.
And so George of the Jungle receivedthe first kiss of his life...
that came fromneither elephant nor ape.
And on the following new moon...
Ursula Stanhope finally gotthe simple wedding she had hoped for...
as the San Francisco heiressand the king of the jungle...
joined their hearts foreverin wedded bliss.
The rings! The rings.
The rings? Tookie.
Tookie.
Arthur, l wish you'd do somethingabout all these monkeys.

Madam, l knew Jane Goodall,and you are no Jane Goodall.
