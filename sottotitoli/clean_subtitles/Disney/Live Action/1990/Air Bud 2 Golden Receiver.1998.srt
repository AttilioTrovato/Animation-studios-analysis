 And a fumble recoveredby the Giants!
 And into the end zone.The Giants score!

I'll tell you, that couldgive you some kind of headache.You know, you get hit with a__

Oh, God! Get out here, Popov!

 I can't see anything!
I'll find you and then ll__ 
You__ 
I'm going to get you!
josh back to pass.The ball is in the air__it's intercepted!
Nowhere near a receiver.And here they comeback the other way.
The Giants with__ No, josh has him.Josh has him on the25.

Why don't you get yourself downand clean up this messthat you have created?
 Popov?
Coach Fanellitakes a heavy anchorto the half time locker room.
Down 24 to nothing.Disappointed, downtrodden.

Hey, Coach, are you gonna tell usanother one of your stories?
You better believe I am. 
This is the storyof a football team.
From the beginning, this football teamhad heart and ability.
But there was one big problem:they didn't believethat they could win.
And then this dog came along,and this dog could do amazing things.
And suddenly,the team started winning.
But the truth is, even without the dog,They were winners__
each and everyone of them.
So if you believethat a dog can play football,
then you better believethat we're gonna win this game.
Now, right now,let's get out there...
and give themsome of that razzledazzle.
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff,
ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!.
Ruff!. Ruff!. Ruff!.
 You guys are the best!Way to go, Marco!
It worked, Pudge! 
Timberwolves! Timberwolves!
Timberwolves! Giants on the attack again.
Here's Martin back to pass,he's lookin'__Ooh, he gets hit at the last minute.
They're gonna want that ball.Goosesteps in__he has it! it's an interception!
Goose! Go! Go! The 40, the35__
Go!Go!Go, Goose, go!

Well, that looks likea little bit of inspirationfor the Timberwolves, doesn't it?
It just proves my theory. What is that, Phil?
Score more pointsthan the other team,
and by golly,you're gonna win!
All right, Brian!
All right? Go. Go!


 Yes! Yeah!
Popov! Mother?
The animals!
What is monkey's business? 
"Fish Guts. "

 
Natalya__ Get off!.

To infinity__ and beyond!


 
 


 

Where is monkey? I don't know, but there is dog.
Dog!

 
Stop, stop!Stop, stop! Stop!

 
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm glad to see you too.
What are you doin' down at the docks?Don't you have a game to play?
Huh? Come on. 
Do you have a plan " B"?
We are Russian citizens!We demand you take usto the Russian imbecile!
It's "embassy," imbecile!


Martin dropping back, Voss__

Now, come on, now. Forget about that__ancient history.
Josh, get in here.Come here. All right.
We're gonna get 'emwith a little "double trouble."All right? Let's go.
But Coach, we've never done"double trouble" without Buddy.
We're gonna haveto do it without Buddy.Buddy's not here. Let's go.

He's down the field!The Giants a reall chasing him!
It's AirBud in the clear!
It's AirBud down on the30,down on the25__

AirBud has put the timberback in these Timberwolves.
I'm telling you, they areon a scoring rampage now!

First down!
 Another score!
That is just amazing.
It's New Year's Evein the end zone with AirBud!
He's got fleas. You can't tell mehe doesn't have fleas.
Yea, Buddy!
AirBud has certainlytightened up this gamefor the Timberwolves,
but they're gonna needanother touchdown in order to win.
And now, this could be it!
Buddy! Ooh, no!
1 84pound crushing tackle by Tyler. Buddy's hurt!
And AirBud is down.
Teammates rushing onto the field. Stay back. Give him room!

But what about Buddy?
