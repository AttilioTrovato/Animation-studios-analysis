Time of our lives, wonder of surprise 
The open blue skies 
Reflecting in our eyes 
In a perfect place, see the sunny days 
Coming into view 
'Cause every day feels
like summer with you 
Everything feels right starting anew 
Every day feels like summer with you 
Oh 
Once you were here
my worries disappeared 
It all became clear 
Nothing left to fear 
Beyond any price, pure as paradise 
Coming into view 
'Cause every day feels
like summer with you 
Everything feels right starting anew 
Every day feels like summer with you 
Oh 
Baa!
Meeeh!
Meeeh!
Baa!
You're mine 
Oh, baby 
Hey!
Meeeh!
Meeeh!
Baa?
Hey!
Get your rocks off,
get your rocks off, honey 
Shake it now now, get 'em off downtown 
Get your rocks off... 
Ooh. Hey. Oh!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Nah.
Yeah? Yeah?
No.
Hey!
You've got to search
for the hero inside yourself 
Search for the secrets you hide... 
Shall we?
You're mine 
Oh, baby 
Yeah 
Mine 
Yeah 
In a city this big
it's easy to not exist 
But that's a problem
you don't seem to get 
When you roll like this 
You left home a short time ago
but it seems so long 
We've only seen this in magazines
and it looked like fun 
Every doubletake, every false start,
every wrong move we make 
Start again, never at the end
It's a risk we take 
Scary things happen right here
all day and night 
But who cares when you look like us
you're gonna be all right 
We won't come this far
to get nothing back 
You can't stop us getting what we want 
We will find what we want in the city 
And we're really fitting in around here 
We're feeling pretty hot in the city 
From the way we walk
the walk is pretty clear 
We're making it in the big city 
And you know
it's always gonna throw it down 
Down, down
So step aside, people, we're coming 
'Cause we pretty much own this town 
This, this, this town
Yeah 
We're looking at you
but it's like you're with someone else 
In the heart of the city
we could easily lose ourselves 
In between making us sing,
we gotta see this through 
We can't stop to make it to the top,
got a job to do 
We won't come this far
to get nothing back 
You can't stop us getting what we want 
Ooh, yeah 
We're making it in the big city 
And we're really fitting in around here 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
No, no, no!
Hey!
No. No!
Hey.
Hey!
Ruff?
She could tell right away
that I was bad to the bone 
Bad to the bone 
Bad to the bone 
Got you.
Bbbbbad 
Bbbbbad 
Bbbbbad 
Bad to the bone 
I broke a thousand hearts 
Before I met you 
I'll break a thousand more, baby... 
That one?
I'm a wonderful thing, baby 
Such a, such a 
Wonderful 
I'm a wonderful thing, baby 
Such a, such a 
I'm a wonderful thing, baby 
Baa!
Baa.
Baa?
Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo!
Wish I were with you 
But I couldn't stay 
Every direction leads me away 
All I want 
Is to be home 
Stand in the mirror 
You look the same 
Just looking for shelter 
From the cold and the pain 
And all I want 
Is to be home 
Yeah.
Every day feels like summer with you 
Everything feels right starting anew 
Every day feels like summer with you 
Baa 
Baa 
Baa 
Baa 
Baa!
Baa!
Baa!
Baa!
Baa!
Yeah.
Hey!
Baa!
Yeah!
Baa!
Arf!
Baa!
Baa!
Baa!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Heeey!
Heeey!
Arf.
Baa!
'Cause every day 
Feels like summer with you 
Everything feels right starting anew 
Every day feels like summer with you 
Oh 
Once you were here 
My worries disappeared 
It all became clear 
Nothing left to fear 
You have got my back 
Keeping me on track 
Like you always do 
'Cause every day 
Feels like summer with you 
Everything feels right starting anew 
Every day feels like summer with you 
Oh 
Every day feels like summer with you 
Oh
