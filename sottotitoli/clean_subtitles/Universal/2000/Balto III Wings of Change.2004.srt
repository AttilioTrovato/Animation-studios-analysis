Everything,

Ahooo 
Hike!
Ahooo. 


Well, wake me up
when it arrives.

Huh?
Isn't it beautiful?
Come on, Jenna!

I'm soaring
above the clouds,
free.

Huh, didn't think so.
Good girl.

Oh my!

What in the name
of Yukon Jack is that?

Trouble,
that's what it is.

Hiyah! Hiyah!
Mush, mush!
Whoa, whoa.
Fire us?

Hey there,
Mr. Simpson.

I'm okay.
What's here?
Hey, boy.
A dog welcoming committee, huh?
Why don't you guard my plane
for a few minutes?
I'll be back soon.
I would if I could.
So where's Boris?



It's my first trip to Nome
and I like what I see so far.
But my friends
are calling me...

Put me down.
Not another game of  
Slosh!
Three!
No, no, no!

See you then, hot stuff.
Balto! Balto!
"Boris, come right away.
It's an emergency!" 
Now you go.
Psst!
No, of course not.
Just a little.
Come on, Boris.
I have an idea.
Nothing! What do you
think I see?
in, in absurd,
illogical way.
except I have no idea
where I'm going.

You got it.
Now   open your eyes.

I am the goose!

Ah! 

It'll be an honor to work for
you and the US mail, Mr. Connor.
Ohhhh!
Oh yeah.









Whoa! Yikes!
You can count on me!
The most famous dog
in Nome.
Huh, now I looking good!

Well, hi there, 
flyboy. 

Sit down, Boris.
Huh?
Let me tell ya something.

Come on down, boys.
On the loose


Bak, bak, bak, bak
On my own,

Come on up
and do a little
Flying with meeee.
Bye... Boris.
I can't beat it.
That could be problem.
Let's do the call!

If I'm in pain,
I cannot fly, yes?


How can I look Kodi
in the eyes if we lose?
The great Balto
who saved Nome.
Oh, Balto.
He needs to know
you care
You've done
all you can do

If you give it 
your best 
You just 
have to be you 
Ooohhhh... 
you'll always be
his hero.
He will always 
have a hero 
He will always 
have a hero... 
Have you...


You saved a lot of lives
in that diphtheria scare.
That was some storm.
It's okay.
soaring above the clouds,
free.
Maybe just a few. 
So, honey, what else
can I do to get you
back on your wings?
Little to the left.
Here?
Who knows
what could happen then.
Say, tomorrow?
Oh, mmm.
This is
gonna be great, Dad.
Oooh, oy, the pain!
I am a genius.
I am suddenly all better.
You don't know whole story.

Ouch! No! Oy! 

Get set! 
Ha! Hey! Hike!


C'mon.
C'mon!
Go, go, go!
Oy! Ow! 
We gotta
slow down.
Or not.
Keep in line, boys.
You got it, Balto.

C'mon, everybody.

Oh no!
Don't give up now. 
Ha, hi!
Thanks, Duke.
Here's the return batch
for you.

Oof!

Thanks.
Let's load you up
for the return trip.
This mail goes
right back to Nome.
Good luck to you.

I am coming! 
I'm going to spend the rest
of my days in White Mountain.
I am  

  going home!
Ice, gotta get it off
the wings before I can fly.
Whew.
Ahhhoh!
or   never mind.
Uh, go ahead, Dipsy.
Thanks, I don't mind
if I do.

Move, move, move!

Oy, I'm about
to lose my lunch.

And we're beating it.
Whoa, whoa there.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Do you hear the plane
anymore, Dad?
No.
Where the heck am I?
Come on, baby.
Oy!
Not the plane?

Balto!
They did it?
I don't believe it.
Easy, easy!


Yeah, if this doesn't
prove us dogs rule  
what does?
But I've seen them.
We can't do this
every time.
You're just wrong.

Yeah... yeah, we do.
And we're gonna keep them.
Come on, let's go.
Balto!

The bush plane!
Oy! Ow! Ohh!
I must get help.

I thought the difference is
only one has a heart.
Who's coming with me?
Dad, wait!
And it served him right,
the stinker.
What?
in that funny way
on his neck   you know?
Wish me luck, boys!

Come on,
let's get going.
They'll be looking
for that bush plane for weeks.
Listen, if anyone
can find him, Balto can.
Yeah, Mom.

I should have gone
with Balto.

Oh, he's probably griping about
what's taking us so long.
Onward.



if you have a thing
for polar bears.
Mmm   huh?


This is no time
to be playing games!

Whoa!
Help, Stellaaaa!
Help!
Quick, grab my leg.
What was I thinking?

Hang on, Balto.
Hurry!
Depends how you feel
about waterfalls.


No more!

Ha, the big talker.
I'm not sure
that's what I want to be.
Sharp and strong!

Back in a flash,
fellas.
I'm going over.

Boris!
Where are you?
Come on!
Move those buns,
fellas.
No...
Uncle Boris!

We're talking
to you!
Now he gets it.

I think
you're talking to me.
Ha!
Balto, talk to me, honey.

Come on, sugar, this isn't
a good time for a snooze.


Male voice:
Hey, lamebrain! 
Yeah, I'm looking at one.

Where are you?
But I could swear he  

Luc says
he's found him!
You owe me an apology!
it was enough!
Easy does it, Luc.

Come on, Stella,
we're going to take
Uncle Boris home.


I guess I won't be
walking back to Nome.

What? Oh!
Oh no!

Hang in there, boy.
Now what?
Kodi?

Right on time, Son.
Don't count him out.



Kodi!

Good dogs!
Good boy, Balto.

I knew he could do it.
I lost my appetite.
I forgot to say
you were a rotten, lying,
goodfornothing snow goose!
Now that's more like it.
I like it already.

Hey!
Hey, there he is!
Living out a dream.
La, da, da, da, dah 
Everything, 
everything flies 
The trout 
that breaks the stream 
Everything, 
everything flies 
Ohhhh! 
Everything flies 
Everything flies.
