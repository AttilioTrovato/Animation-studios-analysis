Long, long ago, 
in the Land Before Time, 
great beasts ruled the world. 
These mighty beasts 
were the dinosaurs. 
Yes, it was a place of wonder, 
but also filled with danger... 

...where survival was uncertain 
and families were sometimes 
torn apart. 

Which is how the young 
Longneck named Littlefoot 
came to live with his grandmother, 
grandfather, 
and his close friends 
in the beautiful Great Valley. 
The perils of the world had 
claimed his mother and 
separated him from his father. 
Then, a miraculous day came. 
Littlefoot and his father, 
Bron, were reunited. 
During the time they were apart, 
Bron had become 
the leader of a large migrating herd. 
This meant he couldn't stay 
with Littlefoot in the Great Valley. 
Bron wanted his son to join him, 
and Littlefoot wanted 
to be with his father, 
but he also didn't want 
to leave his home. 
So Littlefoot made the tough decision 
to stay with his grandfather, 
grandmother and friends. 
Now each year, 
when the Season of New Growth 
follows the Cold Time, 
and the warm sunshine 
falls softly on the Great Valley, 
Littlefoot looks forward 
to a visit from his father, 
leading the great herd 
on their yearly migration. 
It's a reunion he dreams 
about all year long. 
And it will be happening today. 

Today's the day!




You can't find me!


Come on, Littlefoot,
we're playing hide
from the Sharptooth!
Come and play!
Can't, Ruby!
My dad's coming today!
Mr. Threehorn,
is Cera around?
She's gone
to the swimming hole.
What's the hurry?
Today's the day
my dad comes back!
Hey, hey, hey 
Today's the day 
My dad's coming home 
from far away 
We'll race and we'll run 
and we'll laugh and play 
I feel so happy that I gotta say 
Hey, hey, hey 
Today is the day 
Yep, yep, yep 
The time is near 
Our brothers and sisters 
will soon be here 
I will teach them to swim 
and to be your friend 

You will teach them
to stay away from your rear end.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey 
Today is the day 
Hey, guys!
It spring! It spring 
And me feel like flying 
In spring no one be 
grumpy or grouch 

When me up in the air and skying 
Oh! Hey! Oh! Wait! Ohh!
Whoa!

Ouch.
You just barely missed
the hatchlings, Petrie!
Oh, Petrie real sorry.
They're not born yet,
they can't hear you.
No listen to her.
Ahh!

Hey, guys,
you know what day
today is?
I do!
Hey, hey, hey 
Today's the day 
When I'm gonna 
blow that rock away 
I'll hit it so hard 
it'll break in two 
You'll be amazed 
at what I can do 
Hey, hey, hey 
Okay. Get ready!


What did I tell you?
I moved the rock 
We are very, very glad 
Me fly so high 
I'm gonna see my dad 
It the flyingest 
Swimmingest 
Happiest 
Springiest 
Day 
Today's the day! 
Today is the day! 
Hey, hey 
Today's the day 
Today's the day! 




The eggs.

Ohh!


Hello, little guy.
Hey.

He got you, Petrie!
He sure do.


So cute.
I am Ducky,
your sister.

And this is Spike,
your adopteded brother.

And me Petrie,
your adopteded brother's...
Uh...
Me just Petrie.




Grandpa! Grandma!
Look, it's the hatchlings!

Ah. What a special today
this is.
Today! I forgot.
Today's the day my dad comes back!
Great!
Special day!
We are so happy for you,
yes, we are.
Can we go watch
for him?
I thought
you might want to.
Come, Littlefoot.
Now, Grandpa,
keep an eye on the ice.
It's still slippery.
We will, Grandma.
Come on.
We're lucky to live
in such bounty, Littlefoot.
Not many of our kind do.
There they are!
My dad's herd!
You're right, Littlefoot.
But where's my dad?
I don't see him.
That is strange.
Bron is always
at the head of the herd.
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Who's that?
We'd better
take a look.

Help!
Oh, I'm safe.
Am I really here?
Somebody pinch me,
please.
No! Not you!
No. Not you. 
I'll pinch myself.
Ow! Ouch.
Why did I do that?
And you are?
I, uh... Well, everybody
calls me Wild Arms,
though I never really figured out why.
Oh. 
That makes so much sense now!
What happened, Wild Arms?
Aw, I mean what didn't happen?
The earth shook
and spit liquid fire.
And the heat...
Like you've never seen before!
But, it's too upsetting
to talk about.
But if you must know,
it all started with a horrible boom!
The Fire Mountain exploded. 
It just blew its top. 
Fire everywhere you looked. 
There was no escape. 
And the Longnecks, oh, 
they were hit the hardest. 
Let me tell you, 
their leader was brave. 
He wouldn't leave 
any of us behind, 
even though he was in danger. 
I only escaped thanks 
to my superior grace and agility. 
The leader is my dad.
Who?
Bron.
Oh, yes, yes, that's him!
Bron!
What a brave Longneck he was.
Ooh.
Er... Is.
Uh, is!
'Cause he's still is...
He still is... I'm sure.
What happened to him?
I don't know. I lost sight of him
at the Fire Mountain.
He's in trouble?
Grandpa, we have to help him.
Littlefoot...
Will you take us back there?
You know the way.
So, you want me to take you
across the earthbreak,
through the Land of the
FeatherHead Sharptooth,
along the moving water
back to the same Fire Mountain
that I just escaped from?
How foolish do you think I look?
Let me put it another way.
The answer is no!
Please. That's my dad.
He needs our help.
He's right, Littlefoot.
We can't do it.
But...
You'll go, won't you?
I'm sorry, Littlefoot.
It's too dangerous now.
We must wait for the mountain
to stop spitting rocks.
Bron wouldn't want us to get hurt.
But my dad needs us now!
Your father is very strong and wise.
He's lived through
many earthshakes.
I'm sure he's on his way
here right now.
Where are you, Dad?
There you are.
We couldn't
find you anywhere.
We all worry about you.
We are sorry
about your father.
Yes, we are.
Yes, we sorry.
Thanks.
I think he's in trouble.
He needs me.
What can you do?
I'm going
to the Fire Mountain.
I'm going to help him.

Oh, that funny,
Petrie thought you say
you going to Fire Mountain.
I... I did say that.
I'm going.
No seem funny now.
What are you talking about?
You don't even know
how to get there.
Wild Arms said how.
Across the earthbreak,
through the Land of the
FeatherHead Sharpteeth
and along the moving
water to the Fire Mountain.
If you think
we're going to the
Fire Mountain...
I don't.
He's my father.
I'm going alone.








Guys?

Oh!
Littlefoot,
you scare us.
You scared me.
What are you doing
out here?
You cannot find
your dad all by yourself.
You cannot.
Littlefoot need us.

Uhuh. It's too dangerous.
I can't let you come.
You can't stop us.

Oh, looking down
make Petrie dizzy.



What do we do now?
Wild Arms said we have
to cross the earthbreak.
Did he say how?
No.
We don't have
to go across!
We can follow it
to the Long Valley.

That will bring us
to the Fire Mountain.
Well, even
if the Long Valley
does go there,
that will take longer.
We've gotta cross now!

Let me know
when you find a way.
I know!
If we can knock
this tree down,
we can use it to cross.
Hmm.




I know it will reach
if we could just...

Look out!




Yeah!

Cera did it!
Yes, she did!
Thanks, Ducky.
Well, if we're
gonna go, let's go!
Now what?
I guess we go there.
But that's the Land
of the FeatherHead
Sharpteeth.
It look scary.
It will be okay.
Everything looks
scary to you.
My nest not scary.
My... My tree
not scary.

That scary.
We'll never
make it through!
The Sharpteeth will
smell us coming.
I think we should go back
and try the Long Valley.
Petrie like any way
that's not that way.
But this way's the fastest.
If we go around,
we may be too late
to help my dad.
If we get eaten,
we won't help him either.
What do you think, Spike?
Spike?

Where's Spike?
Oh! Sharptooth
ate Spike!
I think Spike is
doing the eating.
Spike!
Spike?
He can't have gone far.
Where are you?
Spike?
Do you see him, Petrie?
No.
Spike!

Looks like he went this way.

Ew!
Ugh. Petrie smell something not good.
That's stinkweed.
Yep, yep, yep.


There you are.
Spike, we don't have
time for this.
My dad needs me.
No more food stops. Okay?
Why did you eat
stinkweed, of all things?
Ducky...


Spike, you are my friend 
My very special friend 

And we all like you very much 
We know that you are happy 
when you fill up your tummy 
But what you are eating now 
is not so yummy 

No, no, no!
It is hot and stinky 
Stinky and hot 
It may feel good 
inside your hungry spot 
But when you are eating things 
that taste all mucky 
You will be smelling 
very yuckyuckyucky 
So you should not 
eat what is hot 
And stinky 

Wait a minute.
Spike, you just gave me an idea!

Maybe there's a way to go
through the Sharptooth Land and be safe.
That's impossible!
But what if we cover
our smell with stinkweed?
They'll smell that instead of us!
You sure it work?
Would you go near Spike,
smelling like that?
Petrie would not go near
Petrie smelling like that!
Let's see if this will work 
I think this plan can work 
Yeah, because you're 
always right 

If we're not lucky 
and a Sharptooth meets us 
He think we stinkweed 
and won't want to eats us 
Because we 
Hot and stinky 
Stinky and hot 
We'll walk right past him 
and we won't get caught 
He will not see us 
with his big red eyeses 
'Cause we be wearing 
gooey green disguises 
No, he will not 
If we be hot 
And stinky 
Your turn.
You've got to 
got to be 
Hot and stinky 
Stinky and hot 
You can all be goofy, 
but I will not 
But that nasty Sharptooth 
will smell you if you let it 
I don't like stinkweed 
and I say forget it 
No, you cannot 
You've got to, 
got to, got to 
Got to, got to, got to, 
got to be 
Hot and stinky 
Hey, stop that!
Hot and stinky 
Ew!
Hot and stinky 
Stinky and hot 
Now we all stinky 
and hot 



Okay, everybody, stay together.
Here we go.
I hope you know
what you're doing.
Me, too.



Get back, everyone.




Seems like
the stinkweed's working.
Quiet, now.
Yes, Petrie be very quiet,
quieter than quiet,
so quiet nobody hear me.

Petrie.
What?
Oh, yes. Quiet.






How much further, Littlefoot?
I don't know!
It's hot.
And I'm stinky!
I don't like being hot and stinky!
No one likes that.
No, no, no.
Look! Water!

Yeah!
Water!


Um, guys, maybe we should go soon.
I'm not ready. My belly's
only half full,
which means it's half empty.


Spike.
No eating the stinkweed.
We need to keep stinking.

Spike, let go.
Ahhh!


Littlefoot go for swim.
I want to swim.
No, Cera!
Me, too.







Um, guys, the stinkweed...
Stinkweed!
It's washing off!









Run!

Come on! Come on!
Whoa!












Whoa!
This way!

Come on! Come on!

Whoa!

We're trapped!
We should have gone
my way!
Cera, I'm trying
to think.

Hey!
You all get behind those rocks.
Spike, Cera, grab
each end of that vine.
When I tell you,
pull it tight. Okay?
Mmmhmm.
Here it come!

Oh, no! This it!



Over here, big guy.
Right here.

Now!







The other one
is coming!
Let him come.





Byebye!
We are all in one piece.

Better than million little pieces.

It's the Fire Mountain,
like Wild Arms said.
We just have to reach
the moving water and we'll be fine.
Fine? What do you mean, fine?
We are nowhere near fine.

Huh?

Look, guys.
Spike found a way down.
Thanks, Spike!

Well, hello there, Ruby and Chomper.
What can we do for you?
Is Littlefoot here?
Did you look at Cera's?
We've looked for him everywhere,
and everywhere we've looked, he isn't.
I don't like the sound of this.


Petrie glad we leaving Land
of FeatherHead Sharpteeth.
Until we have to go back home.
Oh.
Petrie stomach feel funny again.




Come on, Spike.
We have to keep going.
Spike is tireded, Littlefoot.
Ducky, can you help move him?

Okay, Spike, let's keep going.




Ducky.

Nothing makes me tired
like almost getting
eaten by Sharpteeth.


Petrie so sorry.
We find your dad tomorrow.

Littlefoot isn't here,
and Cera should be home by now, too.
I haven't seen Petrie either.
Oh, dear. I assumed Spike
and Ducky were still out playing.
I suspect the young ones
have gone looking
for Littlefoot's father.
Cera, too?

What was she thinking?
We have to find them right away.
I saw Littlefoot listening closely
to what Wild Arms said.
I would guess he went
the way he described.
Thankfully, there's some light
from the night circle.
We'll leave now.
I'll ask Wild Arms to guide us.

We should go, too!
Yes, but let's
not let them know we're going, too.





Okay, guys.
Ah... 
I'm sure you can find
the Fire Mountain without me.
I mean I'd love to come,
but, uh, I got a thing
to do, and it's called
"live."
We need all the help
we can get, Wild Arms,
with these little ones
out here all by themselves.
Of all the wild stunts
these young ones have pulled,
this is the worst.
We'll find them,
Mr. Threehorn.
We've got to.


Through there is the Land
of the FeatherHead Sharpteeth.
Right, Mr. Wild Arms?
You mean the land of certain death?
Yes, that is it.
Okay?
Or we can just be sensible
and go back now.
I vote sensible.
Who's with me?
I mean, come on. How do we even know
if the little ones came this way?
Well, what do you think, Chomper?
Chomper?
I believe we have some followers.
Chomper?
Ruby?
I don't know
what you mean.
We're not here.
It's okay.
Come on out.
Hello, everybody, everybody, hello.
Hi.
Sharptooth!
Run! Save yourself!

No need
for panic, Mr. Wild Arms.
Chomper here is a friend.
Uh, have you taken
a good look at his teeth?
It's all right,
Mr. Wild Arms.
Chomper only eats bugs.
We don't need another Sharptooth
when we're walking into
a whole land of Sharpteeth.
Oh, finally someone who's sensible!
Up top!
Okay.
Four more eyes are four
more chances to find them.
Please?

Well,
guess we can't just send
you two back on your own.
Yay!

Hey, Mr. Wild Arms.



Would you mind, Mr. Threehorn?
I knew I'd end up carrying him
sooner or later.

Chomper, can you smell if Littlefoot
and the others went this way?
Uhhuh.

Littlefoot. Cera.
I smell them all.
Come on, through here.

You said we'd find
the moving water by now.
It should be around the bend.
That's what you said two bends ago!


Sharpteeth!
Do not worry, Petrie,
that is just Spike's belly.
Oh. 

We're all hungry!
And thirsty!
I have an idea.
I'm going to go up there
and look around.
You all wait here.
Hmm.
I see it!
The Fire Mountain.
And there, the moving water
leads right to it.
But how come
we can't find it?

Can I see, Littlefoot?
Um, uh...

Spike?
I don't know
if you should come up here.
Oh!
Petrie want to see, too.
Hey, wait for me.
Um...
I think this ledge is too small
to hold all of us.
I want to see for myself.
Cera...

We're nowhere near the moving water.
It should be around...
"Around the bend."
I don't think you know
where we're going.
We should have gone my way!



Oops.






Nice going, Littlefoot!
Me? I told you not to come up there!
None of this would have happened
if we went through the Long Valley,
like I said.
If we went on instead of stopping
last night I'd be with my dad!
You wouldn't be anywhere without me.
You? You're just slowing me down.
You all are.

I'd be better off alone.
You want to be alone, that's fine!
Fine!
I'm gonna find the Long Valley.
I know where that will lead.
You coming with me?

Good.
We're better off without him.

Who needs friends to slow you down 
Wasting our time 
with too much talking 
Who needs friends to grumble and frown 

When we should just keep walking 
I'm just fine 
On my own 

I will be better off alone 
Who needs friends who get you lost 
And don't wanna listen 
when you tell them 
That you know the best way to go 
And you're just trying to help them 
Might as well 
Talk to this stone 
Ow!
I'm sure I'm better off alone 
And who needs friends 
Who needs friends 
To boss me around 
To boss me around 
That's really hard to swallow 
Can't she see? 
Can't he see? 
It's so clear to me 
It's so clear to me 
I should lead... 
And she should follow? 
And he should follow? 
My mistake 
I should have known 
I would be better off alone 
I'm sure I'm better off alone 
We're so much better off alone 
I guess 
I'm better off alone 

Huh?
It's too soon to be dark.

Oh, no!
Sand cloud!
Cera? Guys?

Petrie feel bad.

Spike, too.
Me, three.
I miss Littlefoot.

Petrie hate wind!

Petrie!
Help!
Hurry, Spike.
Hurry.

Guys?

Sand cloud!

Don't tell me you're thinking
about going back out there.
That's a sand cloud,
case you didn't notice.
My friends are out there!
Well, then you'd best hope
they find some shelter like you.
You don't understand.
They're only out here because of me.
Well, getting yourself killed is not
a way I ever heard of showing you care.
Nothing you can do
but wait out the storm.

Mmm.
Nope, not dead.
You still got time
to grow up and learn to listen.





Ducky?
Spike?
Petrie?

Who's there?


Spike.
What are you doing sneaking up on me?
Where's Ducky?


Here I am.
Good.
What about Petrie?
The wind tooked him away.
Oh, great!
I guess we'll have to look for him.
What about Littlefoot?
He's probably far off by now.
I'll bet he missed the storm.
I do not know.
Well, I do.
Let's go find Petrie.
The storm covereded
everything with sand.
Which way?

Um, that way.
I do not think that's right.
No, no, no.
Well, I say it is.
Come on.
Petrie! Petrie!
Where is he?

Ducky?
Spike?
Anybody?

Anybody at all?


Littlefoot! Cera!
Help!

Nice diggers.
Nice diggers.



No!

No eat Petrie!
More.
More?
More.
More?
More. More. More.

Hello.

Me Petrie.
Petrie!
Petrie! Petrie!
Whatcha doin', hon?
I'm gonna go help my friends.
Aren't you nice.
You know, I had a cousin
who was nice like that.
She put her head in the mouth
of a Sharptooth just to help a friend.
Course, she's not
around anymore, 'cause...
Well, she put her head
in the mouth of a Sharptooth.

Oh! I'm Etta, by the way.
What's your name?
Littlefoot.
Sorry.
Nice to meet you, Fiddlefoot.
You don't mind me saying,
you look more like a Littlefoot.
That's what I'm gonna call you.
Nice to meet you, Etta.
Look, Etta!
Daylight!

What?
Earthshake!
Whoa!
Etta!



That was a close one.
The opening.
We gotta move this.

Looks like we're good and stuck.

Petrie!
Petrie!

Hmm.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Look! Footprints!
Now we're getting somewhere!
Hmm.
But that's Spike's footprint.
And yours.
Oh, you just led us in a circle.
Oh.
Well, maybe I meant to do that.


What's going on?
Hey! Get away!
Big dinner for leader!

Get leader!
Leader!
Leader! Leader!

I'm not afraid of your silly old leader.
Here come leader!

Petrie!
We found you!
Huh?


Petrie so glad to see you.
You?
You can't be their leader!

Petrie! Petrie! Petrie!

Me think me can.
You don't even know
how to be a leader.
Oh, it no hard.
Watch.
Leader!
Leader! Leader!
Huh?
I wish Littlefoot could see this.
No find yet?

He's probably
at the Fire Mountain by now.


We should find the Long Valley.
What do you think we should do?
I just told you.
I mean Petrie.
Who cares what Petrie thinks?
Petrie!
Petrie! Petrie!
They care.
Well?
Petrie think...
Well, Petrie think, um...
We're waiting!
Uh, being leader hard.

But Petrie miss Littlefoot.

Us, too.
Yep, yep, yep.
Well, how are you
supposed to find him?
We don't even know where we are!
So we are lost.

No, no, we're not.
I mean, not really.
Okay, we are lost.
And I miss him, too.
Let's go find him.
Petrie must go
and find friend.
No! No! No!
No be sad.
Um...
Petrie order no be sad.
Petrie always remember you.
And you.
And back there, all you.
Petrie! Petrie!
Petrie!

Oh!

Leader! Leader! Leader!
Yay!


Littlefoot, leave it be.
Honey, no one can break through that.
Cera could.
But she's not here.
It's hopeless.
Come on, Littlefoot, cheer up.
I had a sister once used to say,
"Just when things get darkest,"
"that's when you look for the light."
Unless, of course,
it's too dark to find it.
You don't understand.
My friends only came out here
to help me find my dad.
And now I can't save him.
Well, what...
What happened to your dad?
He got trapped by an earthshake
when the Fire Mountain blew up.
That's what Wild Arms said.
Wild Arms?
Oh, heck, I know a Wild Arms.
Moves like this?
Yes, that's him!
He travels with my dad's herd.
They all made it out okay,
except my dad.
Oh, my.
Is your father's name Bron?
Yeah, it is!
Oh, honey, I was there,
at Fire Mountain.
What happened?
Please tell me.
Okay.
But you may not like it.
The Fire Mountain 
was shaking and rumbling. 
Trouble was coming 
and everybody knew it. 
There was only one longneck who knew 
what to do and that was your dad. 
He ordered the herd to head down 
the mountain as fast as they could. 
But the Fire Mountain 
didn't wait for them to get down. 

Ow!
I barely made it out myself. 
Someone fell. 
I think it was Wild Arms. 
Your father went back 
and saved him. 
And that's when it happened. 
There was an explosion. 
Your father got separated 
from the others. 
Well, honey,
that's the last I saw of him.
That's my dad.
He wouldn't leave anyone behind.
Even though it meant
risking his life.
I guess that's what
you do for your herd.
And your friends.
I never should have left them.
Now, Littlefoot,
don't give up.
Get off your tail
and we're gonna get out of this cave.
How?
When you're stuck in a hole 
and you don't know where to go 
When it's too dark for you to tell 
Your tail from your toe 
You wonder which way is wrong 
And which road is right? 
The best thing 
for you to do is just 
Look for the light 
Look for the light 
One little spark 
A little bit of hope 
to lead you out of the dark 
Somewhere deep inside of you, 
it's shining so bright 
All you gotta do is look 
You gotta look for the light 
If there's a wall, 
sometimes you bump it 
A big old rock, you have to jump it 
Maybe you're tired 
Maybe you're scared 

But the only thing you have to be 
Is be prepared 
To look for the light 
And open your eyes 
You never know when 
you're gonna find a surprise 
Some things may tickle you 

Others may bite 
So, listen to my sister, 
mister 
Come on and look for the light 
Get up and look for the light 
Get up 
and look for the light 
Come on and look for the light 
Well, that's what my
sister used to say,
but you can't exactly go by her.
She ran into a tree once and been
a little funny in the head ever since.
Hey, Etta!
Maybe that's a way out!

It's just light shining off the water.
Oh, I'm sorry, Littlefoot.

That's okay.
Let's keep looking for the light.
That's the spirit!
It's water, Etta!
Heard ya the first time,
but we're looking for a way out.
Like I was saying about my sister...
Etta, if water's coming in the cave,
you know what that means?
It's wet?
No. It means it has to be
going out, too!
If it wasn't, the cave would be
filled with water.
Oh, I didn't think of that.
If water can find a way out,
maybe we can, too!
I like the way you think, Littlefoot!
She had a lot of sayings,
my sister. Like...
You know, "Don't use your tail
to sniff the trail."

Oh, that got me every time.

Littlefoot!
Littlefoot!
Littlefoot!
Littlefoot!

Hmm!
Oh! Look!
Littlefoot's footprints!
He must be close, yes, yes, yes!
Nice going, Spike!
That was hard to see with all these
Sharptooth footprints around.
Sharptooth?




This way!





Look, Etta.
It's the moving water!
My friends and I were looking for it.
Oh, my.
It's under the ground!
That's why we couldn't
find it before.
I bet if we follow this water,
it will lead right
to the Fire Mountain.
Now all we have to do
is find my friends.
Hmm. But how?
They could be anywhere.

That's funny.
It's like I can hear them.

Etta, can you get up there?
Hmm.
My wing got a little singed.
But I can try.

Hmm.
Now what?
Poke through!
Okay.


Yoohoo.


Sorry to startle you,
but I wonder if I can have
just a moment of your time.
Are you by any chance
friends with Littlefoot?
We are!
He says you should come with me.
What's a Bigbeak doing underground?
Well, that's an interesting story
and I'd love to tell all of you that.
But first,
maybe we should get you
away from that Sharptooth.

Honey, would you mind
giving that rock just a little shove?
You got it!
Go!


Whoa!




Littlefoot!
Hi, everyone!
Oh, Petrie miss you!
Spike and me, too!

I'm so happy we're all together.
I... I should have never left you.
Yeah, well,
maybe we all shouldn't have left.
I'm sorry, Littlefoot.
Me, too.
Etta, these are my friends.

I can sure see that!
Hey, look what me and Etta found.
It's the moving water!
It went under the ground.
That's why we couldn't
find it before.
I think this will take us
right to the Fire Mountain.
I mean...
If you still want to go with me.
I will go with you, Littlefoot.

Petrie, too.
Hey, hey, hey!
Count me in.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go!
Jump!
Whoohoo!

The water's great!



Look out below!
Ooh! Ah!




Look! Light!
We're coming out!
Petrie see only sky.

Oh, what does that mean?
Falling water!


Whoa!


Ooh! That was the best!

I want to do that again!

Anybody know where we are?
Yep.
I'm afraid I do.


Petrie like
the water more.
What now?
Etta, where did you say
you saw my dad?
Just over that ridge,
that's where your father fell.
Littlefoot, you might not like
what you see.

Littlefoot?

Dad!
Littlefoot?


What are you doing here?
We came to get you.
Thank you, all of you.
But my leg is stuck.
There's nothing you can do.

They came this way.


Sharptooth!

Sharptooth!
Nobody make a sound!
Everybody needs to be very, very...

Quiet, Wild Arms.

This way.



I wanna go home.

Oh, no... Why...

He's gone.

You hear that?
He's gone!

He's gone.
Isn't that great?
There has to be
something we can do!

Me so sorry.
Etta, please take them home.
I am not going!


Littlefoot, your dad's right.
You didn't give up on your herd.
I'm not giving up on you!
We want to help, too.
Uhhuh!

Cera, do you think you can
move that big rock?
That one? It's huge!
I know.
But you can do it.
Look out, I'm coming through!
Guys, Etta,
we're going to need a tree.
Get that one.
Okay.
Mmmhmm!
What can Petrie do?
Go up high.
Let us know when
the flowing fire starts coming for us.
Petrie will!
Huh?
Hang on!




Cera, you can do it!
Get ready!
You're going down!

Yeah!
Whoa!

Yeah!
Dad.
Littlefoot.

Okay, put the end in here!

Everyone get ready!
When I say, "Push down!"
Hurry!
Ready, set, push!



Dad, now!
Hey!
Petrie think you should hurry!
Go! Go! Go!



Cera!
Dad!

Thank goodness.

What are you doing way out here?
We came to save you.
Oh, we thank you but no need saving.
This time we do saving.
Wild Arms!
What are you doing back here?
Well, Etta, I volunteered
to lead the rescue.
That's what I'm doing here.

You volunteered?
Really?
Well, uh...
Yeah?

Grandpa!
I see you found your father.
He did.
We all did.

You've got quite a group of friends.
You remind me of someone I know.
Come, everyone.
Let's all go home.
Finally someone who's sensible!
Let's get out of here.

Littlefoot had found his father. 
And he found something else, too. 
Something he wasn't looking for. 
The realization that he and his friends 
would always be together 
till the end of their days 
in the Land Before Time. 

Ooh, you'll be very stinky.
