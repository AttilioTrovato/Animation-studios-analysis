Budapest.
The next stop's Budapest.
Budapest is the next stop.
Budapest.
Tickets, ladies.
Here you go.
Here's mine.
And mine.
Mine, too!
Here you go!
Thank you, young man.
Man, I hate wearing disguises.
These heels are killing me.
Okay, take it down a notch.
We don't want to alarm the humans.
Drac.
I'm about to und freak out!
You're a nice kitty.
I'm und kittycat.
No, not this clown again.
Good evening, travelers.
I am Professor Abraham Van Helsing.
Yes. One of the Van Helsings.
For centuries, my family
has protected humanity
from the evils of monsters.
So you can believe me when I tell you,
there are monsters hiding amongst you!
But fear not,
for I am a professional,
and I know how to flush out
these beasts and bring them into the light!
Fire bad!
Sorry, guys.
Finally! First I kill Dracula,
and then the rest of the monsters!
Why do you keep doing this?
Your dad, your grandfather,
your greatgreatgranny...
I defeated them all.
When will you Van Helsings ever
learn to let go of the hate?
Never! Because you, monster, are a...
What? A mouse?
You can't run from me, Prince of Darkness!
I will hunt you for all eternity!
I swear I will never rest
until I destroy you...
And...
Every...
Other...
Monster...
If it's the last thing...
I...
Ever...
Do!
Boy, that guy is annoying.
Maybe one day there will be a place
where monsters can go
to get away from it all,
take a vacation.
Who knows, maybe even get married.
Wouldn't that be something?
It's okay.
When is this thing starting?
You made them cry, Wayne.
All except this little one.
That's Sunny. She doesn't cry.
She bites.
This is a very special moment, Carl.
Any second, your beautiful bride
is going to walk right down the aisle.
No, Drac, she's not coming.
Don't worry.
Mavis is with her.
I'm sure everything is under control.
Mavey, is everything under control?
Yep, just a slight case
of prewedding jitters.
Yep, everything is fine here.
Please try to relax, Lucy.
I've taken care of everything.
The wedding is going to be perfect.
It's not that.
Just, how do I know
I'm doing the right thing?
I know just how you feel.
The day I married Johnny was
the best day of my life,
but I was so nervous.
Not as nervous as I was.
And you should have seen my dad.
He was a mess.
I wouldn't get out of my coffin that night.
But he knew it was meant to be.
It doesn't matter where you come from
or how different you are.
A Zing only happens once in your life,
and you have to cherish it.
You're right! Thank you!
Okay. All right. Okay.
Okay.
I do.
I do.
Do you hear that?
Yes. I thought we locked him in his room.
We did!
Hi, Mom. Hi, Papa.
Dennis!
Dennis!
Tinkles was crying, so we let him out.
Tinkles, sit!
Whose idea was it to let Dennis have a puppy?
Yours?
Right.
Poor Tinkles.
Dennis...
Look, honey, I know you love Tinkles,
but we're not allowed to bring our dogs...
I mean, our pets everywhere.
Okay?
Okay.
DJ Jazzy Johnny in the house. 
It's time to welcome the happy couple,
Mr. and Mrs. Prickles! 
The bride and groom invite everyone
to join them on the dance floor. 
Care to dance?
Is that her?
Watch out now.
She got stitches in all the right places.
Okay, there's no way that
is related to you, Frank.
No, she's my right arm's cousin.
I see it now.
Frank wanted me to meet you.
We're arm cousins, twice removed.
Of course.
I'd recognize that bicep anywhere.
He thought, since we're both single,
we might hit it off, maybe go on a date?
"Date"?
Well, it's just that...
The DJ booth is a sacred space!
I love this song!
Don't you?
Dracula?
Where'd he go?
Dracula?
What's the matter, Drac, you didn't like her?
No offense, but you can't be too picky.
You haven't had a date in 100 years.
Look, guys, I appreciate your concern,
but it's not up to me.
You only Zing once, and I did.
Times have changed, buddy.
You can even find someone
to Zing with on your phone now.
What? Really?
No, no, no.
I'm far too busy.
I have Mavis and Dennis and the hotel,
and bleh, blehbleh.
Did you guys hear that?
He actually said, "Bleh, blehbleh."
I don't say, "Bleh, blehbleh"!
I'm looking for a Zing.
Okay. Changing phone ring. 
No. no. I'm looking for a date.
No, no, no.
I want to meet someone.
Are you kidding me right now?
Don't you get it? I want to go on a date!
I'm lonely.
You want baloney. 
What? Look at that hair. Come on.
Too many eyes.
Too few eyes.
Not into tentacles.
"Match found"?
No, no, no!
First things first. 
I'm not into games. 
You'd better have a job,
and my cats have to like you. 
No.
No.
Dad?
Mavis!
What are you doing here?
I was just checking on the honeymoon
suite, and I heard something.
I'm sorry, my little bedbug.
I was just cleaning the attic.
It's so dirty, yes...
Who is that? 
Are you on the phone?
What, this? I was just trying to find a maid
to help me with the mess.
A maid? 
Who do you think... 
Thank you, I'll check your references
and get back to you. Goodbye!
Dad.
Stop trying to hide it from me.
Hide? Who? I mean, what? Me?
Yes.
And I know what it is.
Really?
You're stressed out from working too hard.
Okay, yes.
You got me.
It's a big hotel, you know?
Can't get to everything.
But what about you?
You're pretty busy yourself.
I know. It seems like now that
we're working together more,
we're seeing each other less.
Yeah. You're absolutely right.
I am working too much,
you're working too much.
We should really take a break,
starting right now.
Nightnight.
I'm still here! 
Hey, honey.
You ready for
date night?
That's okay, sweetheart.
You rest.
You know, Dad's right.
We need a break.
We need to all be together again,
like a family.
Like we used to.
Are you overworked and stressed out? 
Do you need some family time? 
Are you a monster? 
Then you need a vacation, 
a monster vacation. 
Sail away, sail away, sail away 
Welcome aboard Gremlin Air.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please direct your attention
to the front of the cabin.
For your safety,
please unbuckle your seat belts.
In the likely event we experience
a sudden drop in cabin pressure,
oxygen will be provided.
Can I stow that for you, sir?
All right. Thanks.
Beverages. Snacks. Beverages.
Beverages. Snacks.
Beverages.
Coffee?
That would be lovely.
Mavis, please, you're torturing me.
You know I hate surprises.
This is a fun surprise.
There are no fun surprises.
Just tell me where we're going.
Why are we on a plane?
We can fly, you know.
Back in my day, people took trains.
Now, that's classy.
Sure, Dad. Forty hours in a closetsized room
with you and Uncle Bernie
and his smelly cigars,
arguing who was more attractive,
Cleopatra or Nefertiti.
Nefertiti.
Okay, Dad, thank you.
Mavis, this is such an amazing surprise!
I can't wait to spend time
with the people I love most.
But I beg of you, tell me where we're going!
Nope. I've taken care of everything,
so you don't need to worry.
You've been so stressed out lately.
It's time for you to relax.
Now, isn't that better?
Yes.
So relaxed.
I'm gonna go check on youknowwho.
I'll be right back.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Did you see that?
Dennis went to the bathroom!
Okay.
Hey, where are you?
There you are, Tinkles.
Don't worry, we'd never leave you home alone.
Okay, folks, you're free to move about
the cabin, as we have started our descent.
So, any big plans
for the weekend there, Bill?
You know, the usual.
Got to take the kids to soccer.
Snacks. Beverages.
Snacks. Beverages. Snacks.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've arrived at our destination,
the Bermuda Triangle.
Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle,
where you'll embark on a monster cruise
of a lifetime.
A cruise?
Surprise!
No, you... No.
But it's just like a hotel on the water.
I just figured you need a vacation
from running everyone else's vacation.
You've barely been out of the hotel since...
Well, since Mom died.
But this is a chance to make new memories,
with all of us.
With Dennis.
Boat!
Boat!
Who made you such an amazing daughter?
You.
That's right!
What a father I am.
Come on, Denisovich, let's get cruising!
Okay. Smile.
Thank you.
"No pets allowed"?
Perfect.
Welcome aboard. How are you doing?
Dennis, come on.
Nice to see you.
Lovely shirt. Yes.
Hello. Welcome aboard.
This is Bob.
Say hi, Bob.
"Hi, Bob."
Oh, my gosh, Griffin.
I'm, like, so excited.
This is, like, the nicest hotel
I've ever been to.
Yeah!
Man, this is amazing!
There's so much to do!
Olympicsize swimming pool...
Allyoucaneat buffet... 
Fullservice spa... 
I'm gonna get me a seaweed rewrap!
It sounds like everything we can do
at our hotel!
Except on the water!
You nailed it, honey.
Your dad is going to love this!
Best summer vacation ever!
Wait till you see the itinerary.
That's nice.
Frank, "fire bad." Remember?
Yeah, right, but maybe you'll find
your own fireworks on the cruise, huh?
It's not the Love Boat, Frank.
I'm just here to have fun with my family.
Ahoy there!
Welcome aboard!
Who is that?
I am Captain Ericka.
And, yes, I'm human.
But don't hold that against me.
I could not be more excited
to have all of you on board
our firstever monster cruise!
Dad? Are you okay?
No! He's having a heart attack!
Drac? Not likely.
Yeah, the only heart attack that can
hurt him is with a wooden stake.
It must be a stroke!
Actually, I think it might be her.
Watch where you're pointing, mister,
I'm right here.
You always stand so close to me.
It's creepy.
For so long, monsters were hiding,
living in the shadows,
but not anymore!
You've stood up and waved your hand
or claw or tentacle
and said, "We're here, we're hairy,
and it is our right to be scary!"
Now it's time to celebrate!
You'll enjoy gourmet dining,
thrilling adventures,
and nonstop entertainment,
all on the way to our final destination,
the lost city that isn't lost anymore,
Atlantis!
Yeah!
The fish are acrobats!
They're fishcrobats!
Hello. How y'all doing?
So...
You must be the one and only Dracula.
I have waited so long to meet you.
You really don't age, do you?
I would kill for your skin.
You're speaking Transylvanian.
Always wanted to learn.
Such a romantic language.
You know, there's just something
about an accent
that makes a man sound so intelligent.
That's Transylvanian right there.
He's saying it's nice to meet you.
Well, then "alibooboo" to you as well.
Drac! Drac, snap out of it.
Wait. I've always wanted to do this.
Wake up! Wake up, Drac!
Snap out of it!
Hey, cut it out!
Hey, buddy, you okay?
No, not okay.
Not okay!
I... I...
I...
Zinged.
I went to the moped store, I said, "Sell it" 
Salesman's like,
"What up? What's your budget?" 
And I'm like, "Honestly, I don't know
nothin' about mopeds" 
He said, "I got the one for you, follow me" 
It's too real 
A chromedout mirror,
I don't need a windshield 
Check that out!
Here we go.
Yummy.
Papa.
"Kids Club."
What's a kids club?
Fish.
That's right, dear.
I'm still not sure I understand.
You take my kids, all day, on purpose?
Fish.
That's right.
What exactly don't you understand?
Why?
So they can have a great time,
and you can have a great time.
Fish.
Don't worry, you get them back
at the end of the day.
Fish.
Oh, well. That's better than nothing.
So...
What do we do now?
I think we do whatever we want.
"Whatever we want"?
Whatever we want.
Whatever we want.
Whatever we want!
Whatever we want.
Stop! Help me!
Whatever we want.
Whatever we want.
Whatever we want.
Hi. Hello.
How y'all doin'?
Good evening, Captain.
Well, hello. Oh, my goodness.
Would you mind lifting your tail? You know...
Certainly.
Okay. Thank you so much.
Hello.
Welcome aboard.
You were so right, GreatGrandfather.
Monsters are disgusting!
They're animals!
I'll be right there.
Dracula, is he on board?
Yes. I saw him. Facetoface.
I was so nice to him.
That pale face of his and his goofy smile,
showing off his fangs.
It's just like you taught me!
It's even worse than I feared!
It was that fateful night that I realized
a human could never defeat a monster.
But I wouldn't let our family legacy die. 
And so, I began to search for an answer. 
And I saw it in an ancient text,
an instrument of destruction 
so powerful it destroyed Atlantis, 
a whole city of monsters. 
And there, deep within the rubble,
it lay, waiting. 
Endlessly, I searched for the lost city.
Time passed, and my body began to fail me.
It was so sad, Ericka.
First my liver, then my spleen,
followed by a kidney or two.
Then my golden locks.
But I wouldn't let that stop me.
I replaced my failing organs with technology!
And look at me now.
Girl, it's an improvement, really.
Sure.
And now, after 120 years,
I have finally found Atlantis.
Forget about all this!
Let me get rid of Dracula right now.
I was so close to him, I could've just...
No, no, no!
We have to stick to the plan.
Lure the monsters to Atlantis,
retrieve the instrument of destruction,
trap them there, and then wipe them out.
It's simple, Ericka!
Now, promise me
you won't try and kill Dracula.
Fine!
I promise.
Promise what?
I promise I won't try and kill Dracula. Okay?
Don't worry, GreatGrandfather,
I won't try and kill him...
I will kill him.
Work it, Dracula.
You know it.
Lookin' good, Drac!
Feeling good, Frank.
Look at you, so fancy!
What? This? Please.
Dressed to impress, huh?
"lmpress"?
Who do I need to impress?
lsn't that Captain Ericka?
Oh, no!
What?
No, not her.
That's good!
Very amusing.
Sorry, Drac. You know, it's just
we've never seen you like this.
I know.
It doesn't make any sense.
You can't Zing twice, it's impossible!
But I did! So now what?
And what about Mavis?
She wants you to be happy, right?
I'm sure she'll go with the flow.
No, no, no!
Mavis needs me. She depends on me.
I need to be home with my family.
Murray here may be from Egypt,
but you're the one in
"da Nile."
You guys get that?
You hit me right in the...
Mavis!
Don't say a word, or I'll haunt your dreams.
Having fun?
I'm having even more fun
now that you're here.
You know, Dad, I feel really lucky
to have this time with you.
All of us together, it's really special.
Me, too, spider monkey.
Now, are you ready for me
to destroy you in monster ball?
Monster ball!
Come on, Papa Drac!
Bring it on!
For I am king of family fun!
All right! Who is ready to get pummeled?
I got to warn you,
I played secondteam coed intramural
volleyball at Santa Cruz.
Sure, pal. Whatever you say.
Everybody, just please watch the hair.
Watch the hair!
Let's go! Let's do this!
Oh, my gosh, this is gonna be so much fun.
Get ready.
Here comes the pain!
Spike!
Not the hair!
No, no, no!
All right!
Captain Ericka, you are needed on deck. 
Next stop... Buhbye, Dracula.
All right, baby!
Oh, baby, I got this.
Hey there, monsters.
Yeah! What'd I say!
We're arriving at our first destination. 
The underwater volcano! 
Everyone, grab your scuba gear
and get ready to explore 
the wonders of the sea. 
Especially you,
Count Dracula.
You see that, pal? She likes you.
No, no, no.
That sounds like a Zing in full effect.
No, no, no.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm just here to have family fun.
Family, family, fun, fun.
Let's see. What about here?
Right this way, everyone.
Welcome to one of the true wonders
of the underwater kingdom.
I give you Volcano del Fuego.
Or, as the local sea life call it...
What a cute family.
What? No, it's not.
Dracula bad!
Frank, we just ate.
I can't believe you're hungry already.
I'm sorry. You know what it is?
It's all... Just all that
seafood just swimming around,
and when I "see food..."
Oh, man! I'm gone.
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula!
Dracula, Dracula!
I get so close,
but it's almost like he's teasing me.
I just, I can't stand it anymore.
I have to get him!
Boy, that underwater volcano looked hot.
Hi, Bob.
Right. We promised you
we'd play pingpong now.
Dennis? Who is this?
It's our friend, Bob.
Say hi, Bob.
"Hi, Bob."
Okay! Time to go play pingpong.
Drac!
Drac!
Drac!
Drac!
Hey, boys, where's the fire?
Well, Griffin here, he...
He has something to tell you.
Me?
Yeah, I got this bite on my hand,
and since, you know,
you're a biting expert,
I thought you could take a look.
Yeah. Come on over here.
The light is better.
Okay...
Okay, what is going on?
You guys are acting weirder than normal,
and your normal is pretty weird.
You are not gonna believe
what we heard, but...
Ericka loves the Drac 
She can't get enough of that Drac 
Yeah 
Drac is back 
He's got the Zing 
The ZingaZing 
I told you I don't want to upset Mavis.
But what are you talking about?
Okay, well, see, Frank got
hungry, so no surprise there...
But we swam back to the ship,
and we found Ericka raving about you.
She can't live without you, buddy.
It's serious!
You can't deny the Zing, baby 
So, Drac, this is great. Are you gonna
make a move on the Captain, or what?
Yes.
Maybe? No.
It's been a while.
I don't even know where to start.
It's easy, Drac. Just make some small talk.
Remember to smile.
Look into her eyes.
Keep it casual.
Say something funny.
Ask her where her parts are from.
And say that her wrappings look nice.
"Do you like coffins?"
Compliment her.
"Your neck looks delicious."
Here she comes.
Okay, Drac, hit it.
Your delicious neck wrappings
are in a nice coffin.
Would you like to see my parts?
Yes, I'd love to go out with you.
What?
What?
Cantina. Midnight.
Don't be late.
That was a close one.
Wait! Stop it, Tinkles, stop!
Wait, Tinkles. Come back.
Tinkles, stop!
Wait!
No, no, no!
Tinkles, stop!
I've been found!
You'll never get me, monster!
Tinkles, stop.
Everybody, we are pulling up
to our next stop, the Deserted Island. 
It's time to get "lost" on the beach, 
and we hope you'll "find" yourself
some fun and relaxation. 
Beach time!
Johnny, you go set everything up.
And, Dad,
you go get in line for the snow cones.
You know, actually,
I was thinking you and Johnny
should spend some time together.
What do you call it again? Date night?
Date night?
What are you gonna do?
Well, I thought
me and the guys would take this opportunity
to spend some quality time with Dennis.
Okay. That's a great idea.
Come on, Johnny. Date night.
Date night!
Okay, here you go!
Good girl!
I got this one.
What was that?
It sounds like our children.
It is our children! Run!
Run!
Please! Help! Someone!
Get the parents!
Frank? Would you rub
some moonscreen on my back
before I get burned?
Wait one second, honey. You know,
the kids buried me in the sand.
Thanks, honey.
Shall we have another?
Sure.
Sounds good.
Straight up.
lsn't this place amazing?
The menu is in a bottle!
Genius! lsn't that awesome, honey?
What? Sorry.
I was just thinking about my dad.
Don't you think he's acting weird lately?
Not really. Besides having
a huge crush on the Captain.
What?
Yeah.
The Love Boat is
definitely making another run.
No way. He's...
He's my dad.
I know, right? It's weird.
When my parents kiss, I still close my eyes.
I guess I never thought about him
with anyone besides my mom.
You're cool with it, though, right?
Of course. I want him to be happy.
Totally.
Totally.
Have you a beverage
to quench me of my parchment?
Yes, of course, Mr. Chupacabra.
You look ravishing.
Thank you. I just...
So...
Does Captain Ericka have a last name?
Guacamole!
"Ericka Guacamole"?
That's so international.
No. Guacamole for us to share.
How beautiful is that full moon tonight?
Look. Right behind you.
The food here is to die for.
Holy moly, that was a lot of guacamole.
Are you feeling all right?
Totally fine. Why?
No reason.
There must have been garlic in the guacamole.
No.
lsn't that deadly for you?
No, no, no. It's just that I'm...
Garlic intolerant.
Was that you?
Yeah!
Dolphin surfing!
Hi, Mama. Hi, Papa.
Heyhey.
Hey there.
Papa.
Hideyho!
Hi.
Is my dad in there, too?
Don't worry, I'm over here.
No, Papa Drac's not here. He's on his date.
Date?
Please, forgive me,
I'm just very nervous.
You see,
I haven't had a date since my wife died.
How old was your daughter?
She was just an infant.
It was hard being a single dad,
but I did my best.
I never knew my mother, either.
Or my father.
I'm so sorry.
Who raised you?
My greatgrandfather.
I basically grew up on this ship.
That's why you're a captain.
Yeah. It's all I've ever known.
It was just expected.
You know, a family thing.
I understand, family is everything.
You have to honor the past.
But we make our own future.
Dad?
Mavis!
Johnny!
Captain Ericka and I were just
discussing the hospitality industry.
You know, just work stuff.
You're working now?
This is supposed to be a vacation.
A family vacation.
I should really go do captainy things.
Dad, you said you were
gonna spend time with Dennis.
Dennis. Dennis? Dennis.
Yeah, you're right. Where is that kid?
Denisovich? You're supposed to be with me.
Come on now, kid, it's family time.
Quit hiding. Dennis?
What was that about?
You mean your dad's date?
It wasn't a date. It was work stuff.
I'm telling you, Johnny,
there is something
about that woman I don't trust.
But you want your dad to be happy, right?
Yes.
Just not with her.
Heads up, honey.
This guac is loaded with garlic.
Garlic?
That was a cute toot, honey.
We've been up all night!
Let's stay up all day, too!
Let's get wild!
Ericka!
What?
Just where have you been, young lady?
Doing work.
Wearing that?
You were with him! I know it!
Who?
"Who?" You know who!
You've been sneaking around my back
trying to kill Dracula again, haven't you?
So what if I have? I am a grown woman!
I have the right to kill whoever I want.
It's not just about you.
You could have ruined the legacy.
What if he discovered who you were?
I know. I wasn't thinking.
There's just something about him
that just drives me crazy!
I just, I see him, and I want to...
Punch him?
I guess.
Just, I can't wait to get this over with.
Don't worry, it won't be long now.
Once you recover
the instrument of destruction,
no one can stop us.
Not even Dracula!
Excuse me.
Spies!
Now, quickly, before someone comes!
Everyone assemble on the forward deck. 
We are arriving at our final destination. 
From the depths of creation,
the mighty city has risen once again.
Home to the greatest monster civilization 
the world has ever known, 
far surpassing Athens and Rome
in art, culture and sophistication.
I give you
the legendary lost city of Atlantis.
It's a giant Kraken!
There's a place you've gotta be 
A thousand leagues beneath the sea 
And it's waiting over here for you and me 
Gonna take you for a ride 
But first you've gotta come inside 
Get ready, for the party's on tonight 
So relax and just unwind 
Leave your worries all behind 
And get ready, for the party's on tonight 
Welcome to Atlantis! 
So get ready 
Ready 
It's party time 
It's party time! 
I am so excited!
Come to Daddy!
Twentyeight black!
No, you don't.
Last time you gambled,
you lost an arm and a leg. Literally!
Replacement limbs...
I'll raise you 40.
...aren't just lying around
like they were in the old days.
So, no gambling.
Frank!
Yes, dear! Got it! No gambling!
Tinkles, stop.
Wait.
Stop it, Tinkles, stop.
Wait!
Have you guys seen Mavis? I have to find her.
Why? What's going on?
I'm going to tell her about Ericka.
I can't lie to my own daughter anymore.
She's the most important person
in the world to me.
I have to tell her the truth.
Right after I talk to Ericka.
Hey.
All right, I'm all...
Frank, are you sure
you know what you're doing?
I got this. I'm all in.
Johnny, have you seen my dad?
Maybe he's with Bob.
Why would he be with Bob?
Bob's a great guy.
There he is.
Who? Bob?
There he is! Hi, Bob!
There it is.
You saved my life.
Of course. Why wouldn't I?
I just can't believe you would do that
for a human.
Humans, monsters, what's the difference?
Yeah, right. Right.
Wait. What are you doing here?
Well, you know,
vampires can predict the future,
so I knew you would need my help.
Never heard that before.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a wellknown fact.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm here to get that.
Yeah, it's a family heirloom.
Yeah, it was lost at sea,
and my greatgrandfather is... Was!
Was totally obsessed with getting it back.
So, anywho, thanks for saving my life,
but I can take it from...
Got to be a little more careful.
How many times can you save my life, right?
I don't know. Every time?
Really? Well, then...
That was incredible.
Don't you want to get
your family heirloom thingy?
Right.
Got it.
Here, let me get that for you.
Dad!
Mavis!
What are you doing to my father?
Wait!
Mavis, stop! Put her down!
No! She's trying to hurt you.
Why can't you see that?
Because I...
Because I Zinged.
What?
I Zinged with Ericka.
No, that can't be true.
You only Zing once.
That's what I thought, too.
"Zing"? What's a Zing?
Well, it's a thing for monsters.
It's kind of like our "love at first sight."
What? No. No, no, no.
You don't even know me.
Well, not yet.
But we're just...
No, you don't understand.
I can't be with you.
I could never be with someone like you.
I could never be with
a monster.
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I...
It doesn't matter.
You heard what she said.
But a Zing never lies.
You got it!
Yes.
Now that we have
the instrument of destruction,
our family legacy will be fulfilled.
But first, we'll draw them in
with a dance party!
I love to dance.
Frank, could you zip me up?
We're gonna be late.
Where did you get those?
See, here's the funny thing.
I lost my hands gambling,
but... It's no big deal!
Look, I got these from the seafood buffet.
Look at this. Clicketyclick, click,
clack, clack, click, click.
I kind of like 'em. I like 'em.
I guess the party's this way.
Let's get this party started right!
All right!
What?
I thought they said the party was this way.
DJ in a clamshell?
I'm so jealous.
I can't believe my dad Zinged
with someone who's trying to kill him.
Yeah, the Zing makes you do crazy things.
Really, Johnny?
What's most important to understand
is that love is an infinite enigma
that is beyond our understanding.
You and I were two halves, a world apart.
But then we followed the strands of destiny
and were brought together.
And our halves made one whole.
But what if she and he...
You must release all the negativity
and look within.
Your bond is unbreakable.
You're right, honey.
Thanks.
You sounded pretty smart, Dad.
That? Yeah, it was just the philosophy
of Sifu Sing from my favorite
TV show when I was a kid,
Kung Fu Shaolin Monk Master. 
Anyways, let's get back to dancing!
Cool.
Dad? You have to talk to Ericka.
What?
I know.
I know what I said before,
but maybe I overreacted a teensy bit.
It's just the thought of losing you.
What? What are you talking about, losing me?
Well, obviously, after you get married,
you're gonna live on the ship
and travel around the world...
Slow down, Mavis.
There are two things I can promise you.
One, nothing can ever take me
from you and all my family.
Two, I will never live on a boat.
You're my cute little tarantula.
How could I ever leave you?
Now, seriously, go talk to her.
I can't. You heard what she said,
she could never be with someone like me.
No, Dad. You're just a half,
and you have to follow
your destiny to find an infinite whole.
You sound like Johnny.
Point is, you can't deny a Zing.
Monster, human, unicorn...
It doesn't matter.
So go to her! Now!
Okay. I'm on it.
Hey, man, you're not allowed up here.
The DJ booth is a sacred space.
No. Tinkles, quiet.
Who is this?
I know you recognize me, your greatest rival.
Right.
You own that Holiday Inn down by the airport.
No! It is I, Abraham Van Helsing.
Van Helsing?
After all these years?
You look awful.
Always with the quick insults.
Well, this will shut you up.
And all monsters.
That's just Ericka's family heirloom thingy.
Good one, Ericka.
Ericka?
You fool.
Not only is she the ship's captain,
but she also happens to be...
Wait. You tell him.
I'm his greatgranddaughter.
I'm Ericka Van Helsing.
I knew there was something wrong with her.
But...
See, what happened...
Now that we're all caught up,
let's get back to the dying.
Behold, the key to the demise
of all monsters.
Let's see.
Right... Okay.
Listen to the melody of your destruction.
What's this little doodad do?
Yeah!
Hey, look! It's the Kraken.
Everybody out! Now!
We're trapped! Everybody back!
Baby!
Papa!
This has to stop now!
Drac, no!
Dad!
Mavis!
Time for the immortal Dracula to die.
Dad!
No!
Ericka!
Bob! Help!
Tinkles?
Dennis.
Oh, no. Bob is Tinkles?
How did he get here?
But thank goodness he did, 'cause look!
You can't do this!
You're wrong about monsters!
Dracula... He saved my life.
What?
I'm so sorry, Drac.
I was trying to kill you this whole time,
but then I realized how wrong I was.
How wrong all of this is.
And then I...
I Zinged.
"Zing"? What's a Zing?
It's a monster thing.
You wouldn't understand.
It's like true love.
Love?
Well, I guess the legacy ends with me.
That's an awkward ending.
Nope!
It's time to start a new legacy.
A monsterhuman legacy.
No!
Drac! Van Helsing's beats are
controlling the giant octopus thingy.
If there's one thing I hate, it's an evil DJ.
We need positive energy!
Get ready for a DJ battle!
You just carry
all that stuff around with you?
Once a bar mitzvah DJ,
always a bar mitzvah DJ.
We're gonna use good music
to defeat his evil music.
What?
Trust me, I know the tunes,
but you've got the power.
All right. Okay.
Opening song needs to be off the shizak.
Got it. Play this!
I'm picking up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Good 
I'm picking up 
Good vibrations 
She's giving me 
Excitations 
Good, good, good 
Good vibrations 
She's giving me... 
What is that noise?
I'm picking up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
I like this one.
This feels good.
Good vibrations 
The fool.
His music is too powerful!
We're gonna need something
even more positive.
Now, Drac!
So don't worry 
Be happy 
Don't worry 
Really?
It has a nice message.
Don't worry 
Be happy 
I've had enough of this nonsense!
Johnny, we need the most braindominating,
toetappinating song
in the history of all the universe.
Come on. Where is it?
I don't know!
There's too many choices.
No, wait!
This is it.
What the...
Boy, that stinks.
It's working!
Hey, Johnny's corny music
is defeating the evil music.
I kind of like it.
No!
I'm a slave to the rhythm!
No!
Drac, what are you doing?
You got to be greater than the haters!
Why?
Why, after everything,
would you save my life?
Because basically we are all the same.
Claws or hands, two eyes or three eyes.
Green skin.
No skin.
Prickly.
Brainy.
I'm sorry.
You are amazing.
Look at me, Dennis. Look at me.
Come on, you can't deny it.
No! I'm too young to Zing!
Well, I feel kind of silly now.
For decades I have hunted your kind,
persecuted you.
The only thing I can do
to make it up to you is
give you
a 30% refund.
Preposterous!
All right.
Full refund.
Wayne, Wanda, what happened to you guys?
Yeah, we, like, hardly saw you on the cruise.
Yeah, I know.
We got tranquilized and spent
most of the trip locked in a closet.
We're gonna book it again for the holidays.
Hi. Checking in?
Yes. Thank you.
Great. I have a room all ready for you.
Hey, buddy, would you mind?
Sure thing, pal.
Okay, what's going on, sneaky pants?
Nothing.
It's just, I wanted to make sure
nobody would bother us.
Why?
Are you going to sucka my blood?
Bleh, blehbleh.
No.
I was going to ask you
if you would marry me.
Well? What do you say?
Will you marry me?
I... I...
Wha...
I mean, I woobee doobeedee?
What did she say?
I'm not sure.
Yes!
