Dowd. Now, what do I hate?
Boring places.
And?
Wells that aren't pumping oil.
So what's happening?
Probably our people being overly cautious.
I'm sure it's nothing.
It better be.
I bet the whole company on this site.
Well, the reserve is several hundred
feet deeper, but we have to pass through
what appears to be
a large pocket of water to reach it.
Water? Well, let's keep going.
Is that why you called me down here?
Discovering water two miles
below the surface
is important, scientifically.
Dowd, you're lead scientist here.
Do we care about that?
No.
If there's a water pocket,
there's a possibility of an ecosystem.
Life.
Okay. Actually, it's basically impossible.
The water pressure
at that depth is 10,000 psi.
That water is supersaturated
with nitrogen.
There would be no nutrients for life.
So we keep going, yes?
Yeah. Punch through.
Bioluminescence.
There is life.
No, that's...
That's the reflection from our light.
What was that?
Warning.
The bore into the pocket
destabilized the well.
The pressure's rising way too fast.
There's something down there.
We have to shut it down. Shut it down!
Something came up.
Something came up through the well!
What is this thing?
He's a real gogetter.
He comes highly recommended.
Mr. Burke!
Do you have this under control?
We got this one.
I have a search party
looking for the other two.
It is very important
that you keep your search discreet.
The Department of Fish and Wildlife
will shut us down
over a horned lizard,
let alone these things.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
We gotta get somebody to examine it.
We find out what it eats,
and needs to survive.
It'll help us find the missing ones
and eliminate them.
Also, if there's more where they came
from, we'll know what we're dealing with.
That is smart. But just you.
Okay. I'm on it.
We are standing on an ocean of oil.
If we keep this quiet,
we will all make out very well.
Okay.
I'm on it.
Don't let it out of your sight.
Yeah!
So Terravex made
some people rich around here.
Big deal. It doesn't matter.
We're making do.
You shouldn't cry just 'cause you didn't
get a land lease from an oil company.
Who's crying?
Wouldn't take money
from Terravex, anyways.
They ruined this town.
You're talking like you're old enough
to remember how it used to be.
It was never anything to shout about.
Dad was still here.
I'm gonna stop at
the Loaf 'N Go on the way home.
You want anything?
Something with four wheels
that'll get me out of this place.
You're so handsome.
Where are all the girls
knocking down your door?
I'm closing again tonight,
so I won't see you till tomorrow.
Just one frozen pizza.
You save the other one for Rick.
Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good. Sorry.
No.
Okay. Bye.
All right.
Tripp.
She said she's not
going to be home till late.
Yeah? Why would that matter?
You're still going to be here
when I get back?
Don't you worry! I'm not going anywhere.
You enjoy that a little too much.
Where'd this come from?
Pankeska Rock.
Big accident up there at the drill site.
It got late pretty quick.
Let's strip it tomorrow.
If I come back.
Don't think you're doing me
a favor being here.
I don't take charity.
Neither do I.
This is a 6.4 liter Hemi V8.
Probably the only piece worth anything.
Go ahead, it's yours.
If anyone can get it working, you can.
Hey, lock up for me.
Old Hulk ain't what he used to be.
I got 425 horsepower for you, buddy.
You're not gonna be
the prettiest thing in town,
but you're going to have
the heart of an elephant in you.
Outrun that volcano?
You bet we can, Mr. President.
What are you doing in my truck?
Yeah, I can take you
and your sister to Coachella.
Sisters?
Kill 'em!
Ejector seat engaged.
You're watching KYPN, North Dakota,
your number one source for news.
Local residents were awakened
by a catastrophic accident
at Pankeska Rock,
where Terravex Oil workers
fought a towering fire
whose black smoke
still filled the morning air.
Rigger Wade Coley was on the scene
when the accident happened.
Well, I heard an explosion
and the tower crashed, and...
Dad?
...guys were running and shouting,
and that's really all I'm allowed to say.
Why this shroud of secrecy
and silence by Terravex Oil?
I just do my job.
I really don't know.
I can't answer any more questions.
You're here?
I explained to him
that the number of objects
naturally occurring in
the periodic table of elements...
Tripp! Hey!
Hey.
We were matched up for biology tutoring?
And you haven't showed up
to any of the sessions?
Or maybe you didn't get the schedule?
It was posted in class,
and I emailed you a copy,
and slid one into your locker.
Yeah. I just haven't checked it yet.
Yeah. I mean, I get it.
I go, like, days sometimes
without checking my email
or going to my locker.
I'm Meredith, by the way.
Right. Yeah, I knew that.
Hey, Tripp!
Hey, Sam. How's the luckiest kid in town?
You know my Dad doesn't
let me drive the merch.
Plus, he's flipping out right now.
What happened?
You want to see something crazy?
See, I'm growing out my hair, like you.
Hope people don't think we're brothers.
We've had trouble before, but usually
it's a rock through the window,
smashed taillight, that kind of thing.
Check it out.
Told you you've never
seen anything like this.
They ripped out the gas tanks.
I mean, who would even do that?
Well, it has to be vandals.
Serious power tools.
Tripp, you know what?
I happen to have the schedule
for our tutoring right here,
and it says our next sessions
are Thursday and Friday.
This Friday.
I have work Friday.
I can come by your work!
See you later, Tripp!
Good to hang out with you, bro.
It's on the far side. Here. Come on.
Where is it?
It's in there.
We're gonna need more guys.
What is it? A bear?
No. Just open it up and look.
Grab that.
You're going to need, like,
12 more of those things.
It's in there.
I don't see anything.
What? No, I...
No, no, no. I trapped him in here!
He had...
He was huge. He had tentacles and giant
eyes.
You guys go on ahead. I'll handle this.
Rick, I know what you're thinking,
but you've got to believe me. He...
He sucked all the oil out of the can!
He sucked it out.
Are you done?
I knew it.
I knew it as soon as I heard
it was you on the call.
I knew something wasn't gonna go right.
You thought this would be funny, huh?
Pranking me and my guys?
Making me look like an idiot?
I saw it.
Yeah. Well, I hope it was fun.
You're gonna wind up just like your dad
if you don't straighten out.
Don't talk about my dad.
That's it for you. That's it.
I just feel so squeezed in here,
like trapped.
Like, I might die here
if I don't get one of those scholarships,
because we can't afford
an outofstate school.
But there's no way I can
imagine staying here, either.
I mean, did you see
that thing on the news?
About the burning well?
It's like, nobody cares
about how much damage they're doing
to the environment because
all the money in town
comes from Terravex Oil.
Hey, you know a lot about biology, right?
That's what I'm tutoring you in.
How often do they discover new species?
Seriously?
I was just watching a show on this.
Do you watch Nat Geo?
No.
Well, they said that they discover, like,
15,000 new species every year.
So, would it be possible for there to be,
like, a giant sea creature
here in North Dakota?
Technically, totally.
This whole state was under
an ocean at one point.
So theoretically,
the deep lakes
could have something like that.
I mean on land.
A giant sea creature on land.
Well, no.
Because its body evolved
in a water environment,
so it wouldn't be able to move
with the effects of gravity pulling on it.
Did you want to watch that show?
'Cause I have it on my DVR.
It's 4:00. I'll see you later.
Come on.
Come on.
No, no, no.
Come on.
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Shit.
I'm trying to help you!
Let go of me! I just saved your life!
See? You would have
been flat as a pancake,
you squishy piece of squish!
What are you?
You want the oil?
You promise not to eat me?
Hey! Don't even touch me!
You got to be kidding me.
You better slow down there.
You're getting all jacked up.
What? You don't like that truck?
Okay. Watch this.
See? It can't hurt you.
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah. We're working for Terravex.
We had something crash through
our fences last night.
No one got a good look at it,
but it was big, whatever it was.
You get any reports of anything like that
in the last day?
No, dude, we haven't heard any of that.
Nothing strange?
No calls about seeing
some kind of big animal?
There was the monster in the junkyard.
Or was it a "giant creature"?
Hey! Hey! Guys!
What did I say? Enough about that.
Well, I'd like to hear the story.
Well, there's not much to tell.
It was a false call. That's what it was.
Where from?
It's Weathers' junkyard, off 112.
Hey! We just talked about this.
Look, I don't see why
you're so worked up about a prank call.
I don't see why you are, either.
Quit being a baby.
There we go.
Let's get you to the sheriff's station.
See what Rick has to say now.
What the...
Hey! Get back here!
Hey! Stop!
Stay! Stay put!
Stay put!
Listen...
Nobody's listening to me!
Not so tough, are you now, landsquid?
You are so
smelly.
No. No, no, no.
Hey!
Get back here!
No, no, no.
If you scratch my truck, so help me!
Can I help you?
I understand you had
an incident last night,
but the local authorities
didn't believe you.
Explain why you care?
We're looking for something unusual.
Something dangerous.
What are you looking to do with it?
Make sure it doesn't hurt no one.
I thought I heard something.
I didn't see anything.
Must have been a coyote,
or something like that.
Did this coyote come back?
No.
Mind if we take a look?
Yes, actually.
Because it's private property
and you're not allowed to go in there,
but go ahead and look around,
if you want to.
I can make an exception this time.
You know, the coyote that I saw...
I heard, was...
I think it came from that side of the yard.
For sure, actually.
From that side of the yard?
Yeah.
Stop it! Stop it!
Will you stop?
Search the whole place.
The battery's dead.
I'm going to push it over
to the other garage.
You guys just keep looking around.
Hey!
Give me back my truck!
Hey!
Give me back my truck!
Tripp?
I made flash cards!
Meredith?
What are you...
Look, seriously, now is a really bad time.
Okay.
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?
I don't live too far away.
But it was kind of a scary walk
in the dark.
I don't have a car.
It doesn't run.
It's not...
Can you just go home?
Please.
It's kind of rude of you
not to give me a ride home.
I came all the way over here
on Friday night
to help you study,
and you're just sending me away?
How would you feel if I got
abducted on my way home?
Who's gonna abduct you?
It's not what I mean.
It just... It doesn't happen out here.
What was that?
I heard it, too.
Hey, kid!
You should probably put that in park.
Hey! Why don't you just get in the truck?
Really?
Yeah. Just get in.
Listen, there's something going on here.
Really?
Yeah, something crazy.
And I don't even know
how to begin to explain it.
You don't have to. I mean...
I feel it, too.
No.
There's...
Just go if you're going to go!
Go!
That kid knows something.
You know, I can drive manual
if you don't know how.
Okay. Well, at the end of the hill,
turn right.
Right! I said right!
I'm trying!
Stop the car!
I can't! Nothing's working.
Put your hands on the wheel!
I...
This isn't doing anything!
Yeah. I know!
Tree, tree, tree!
There's a paved road
that goes to my house.
Do you even have your license?
Did you just steal this?
Did we just steal this?
Okay, get out!
You hear me?
Get out!
You were the one
who pushed me into your truck!
Give me my truck back!
Who are you talking to?
That!
Was that a snake?
Tripp, what is that?
Take a look and see.
Take a look?
He won't hurt you.
What!
Oh, my gosh. What is that?
Tripp!
Fine, just keep the truck!
You said you live close, right? Let's go.
Are you just gonna...
I mean, seriously, Tripp, what...
It's moving the truck.
Okay.
My dad barely comes in here,
so you should be fine for the night.
Think he'd mind if
I borrowed some of this stuff?
I'll pay him back.
I doubt he'd even notice. But for what?
So I can pry Creature here
out of my truck.
Good luck with that.
Yeah. My curfew is in, like,
two minutes, so...
Thank you for the incredibly weird night!
Please don't let it near my horse.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey!
Sit still, would you?
Hey!
Now, it's not just this one pocket
that's blocking our oil.
It is a massive, interconnected ecosystem,
untouched for millions of years.
I mean, it's basically a certainty that
there are more of those things down there.
Prehistoric amphibians,
that can breathe water or air,
living in a network
of underground lakes and caves.
It's like the Loch Ness Monster
isn't a myth after all.
Can we access it?
Well, there's a crater lake
on the surface,
and, yeah, the vents that feed the lake
lead directly down there.
Could we get equipment there?
Well, it was a pretty rough drive
in my Jeep.
There's a good dirt road
after the strip mine,
but after that it's all offroad.
Good job.
What about our POWs?
Well, we're still working on it,
but if that third one
is alive out there somewhere,
we'll find it.
Stop! Stop. Give me some space.
Morning.
Morning.
So, instead of getting him out of there,
you built more stuff to keep him in.
This thing is kind of awesome.
Like, strong and smart. Really smart.
He can learn anything, fast.
And I gave him a name.
Isn't that right, Creech?
You named him Creech?
He's got these hairIike things
on its tentacles.
Cilia, right?
They can generate
a massive amount of torque,
especially once I scored the axles
to make more surface area to grip.
And that's at each tire.
So, imagine the angular velocity when it's
not all spread out from one differential.
You're not dumb.
What?
Nothing.
So...
I press the gas,
the throttle wire pulls these levers,
which open these blinders.
Right? Right?
It's like
the truck's a wheelchair for it.
No. It's like...
It is an engine for my truck.
Watch.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Did you see that?
Okay.
Hey!
See, it's not so hard.
Okay.
Come on.
You got it!
Showoff!
No way!
Lift this up, would you?
Stop.
But this thing is important, right?
Shouldn't we tell somebody?
You think he'll be better off
with somebody poking at him,
trying to figure out what he is?
First of all, how do you
know that it's a "he"?
And secondly,
as a Youth for Animal Rights activist,
I feel responsible
for the wellbeing of that animal.
He's fine. He's happy.
Hey!
Hey, stop!
I'm just saying, he came from somewhere.
He has a home.
Don't you think he wants to go back there?
Sure, but he's safe in here
in the meantime.
Besides, he's having fun.
He's like a kid with his first tricycle.
I'm going to see my dad at Pankeska.
Was he at Pankeska Rock
when that accident happened?
Yeah.
I'm coming with you.
Okay, Creech, let's get you fed.
I'll get you back.
Great.
Hey.
Hey.
I like your truck.
What is this?
You know what this looks like?
This looks like if a garbage
truck took a dump.
And not like a normal dump.
Like a really bad one.
That's what this looks like.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Ouch.
That sound weird to you?
How is a monster living
in the hood of your car
supposed to sound?
He's probably fine.
Okay. Why is he moving like this?
I don't know. He's hyper.
Why would he be hyper all of a sudden?
It's what he ate.
Gasoline is oil, but with...
Added chemicals!
What the...
Okay. I think now is
a good time to take charge.
Let go! I can see better than you.
Hey, what are you doing?
Get back in there!
Tripp! Tripp! Watch out!
Oh, no. What are you doing?
No, no, no!
Get back in there! I'm driving!
I said, let go!
Oh, gosh, I touched his eye!
No, no, no.
Watch me unload this lemon
on Old Man Overalls here.
No! No! No!
Okay. Right!
Sorry.
Okay, new rule,
no feeding Creature gasoline.
So, you don't like
the bacteria cultures, huh?
How about nematodes?
Don't like those, either.
Well...
You must eat something out there
under those oil beds.
Hi.
Dad?
Hey, Dad.
It's Tripp.
Tripp.
Well, it sure is. Look at you.
Don't want to get my grime all over you.
Right.
This yours?
Yeah.
The truck, not the girl.
I figured the girl's yours.
No. Not really. Hi. I'm Meredith.
Wade.
This is something.
This is solid.
This is solid work.
Yeah. Thanks.
Come on up.
Why don't you park it at my trailer?
I'm just gonna call my guys,
tell them I won't be at the bar.
Yeah.
It's small, but it's a roof and a bed.
It's only temporary for work, right?
I mean, you have
a permanent place somewhere?
Yeah, well, this does the job.
I'm not inside much, anyway.
They got us working 12hour shifts.
Were you working
when that accident happened?
Yeah.
There's all these rumors
I read online about it.
What happened?
This stays in here, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They drug something
out of the ground that night.
Pushed so far down,
it was like the earth got mad
and let something bad out.
But they say it was a pocket of gas,
so I guess it was a pocket of gas, huh?
Yeah.
What do I know?
Right?
I left something on the bus.
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
We'll have some wings.
Well, at least we know
where that thing came from.
Those guys the other night
must have been from Terravex.
They don't want
anyone to know about the creature.
Well, they wouldn't be able to drill
if there was some
new species living on top of the oil.
I'm gonna go check on him.
Probably not good to leave him alone long.
Dad?
These men want to have
a word with you, Tripp.
They want their truck back.
Their truck? I built that!
Look. Your mother called me last night.
She saw me on TV,
thought you'd maybe come
up here and try to find me.
You sold me out. To them.
I'm not selling you out to no one.
I just wanna do what's best.
For who?
We just want to talk to you, son.
Watch it!
I'm not going anywhere with you!
Yes, you are.
Just listen to him, Tripp.
You're not the police.
You don't have the right to take him.
This is private property.
Our private property.
Get off of me!
Get in the truck. Get in the truck.
I'll hurt you, kid.
I will.
It's the truck! That thing is in the truck!
Yeah, I'm just pulling in now.
Listen, I don't want you to worry, okay?
If he's here,
I'll have him home by dinner.
Move over! I'm driving!
Really?
I gotta go.
Tripp?
Yes!
Tripp!
What the heck is going on here?
Big truck, big truck, big truck!
Tripp.
No. I'm not stopping
and I'm not giving up the truck.
No. Go faster!
Okay. We got him.
Fan out. Cut him off.
Don't let him out of town.
We're not gonna fit.
I think we can do it.
It worked!
Move! Go!
What?
Did you train him to do this?
Yes.
I have no idea how he learned this.
Did that just happen?
Yeah, it did!
Wall!
Watch this.
We're driving on a roof.
Get out of our way, pigeons!
Did you see that?
Hang on!
No way.
I want to stay on the roof now!
Did you hear that? The train.
So what?
That thing is five miles long.
If we can put that in between us and
them, we'll get a 10 minute head start.
How about a plan B?
No time for a plan B.
Besides, I think we lost them.
Tripp, I don't think
we're going to make it.
We'll make it!
We're not going fast enough!
Slow down!
Brakes!
Tripp!
Yeah! Way to go, Creech!
Hey! What are you doing,
chasing that boy all over my county?
It's a private company security matter!
You're putting lives in danger.
You're interfering with law enforcement!
The company I'm working for
employs everyone in this town,
and that includes you!
When's the next election, Sheriff?
Go back to writing tickets
and shooing cows off the road.
You really saved me back there.
Thanks, you big, ugly, beautiful blob.
My dad only uses this
during hunting season, so...
You said there was oil?
Yeah.
But it's for the generator,
so we won't have electricity.
That's okay. He deserves it.
It's nicer out here.
Yeah, I don't mind.
Are you scared of fire?
I would be, too, if I drank oil.
Tripp, I'm sorry about your dad.
It would have been a lousy
place to stay, anyways.
I mean,
how weird would it have been if he'd
turned out to be a decent guy, right?
What would that have been like?
You wouldn't be who you are.
And there's no one like you at our school.
Or in our town.
So,
that's something
to thank your dad for, at least.
God!
Where are you going?
Hey, hey.
Hey. What are you doing?
Hey.
No.
I'm going to get you home.
I promise you that.
Thank you.
I love you, too.
Ready? Watch.
You could teach a mouse how to do that.
That's not the amazing part.
This is the amazing part.
I didn't teach that one
to do that for the oil.
I taught that one
how to do that for the oil.
They have hive intelligence,
like ants or bees.
When they're in close proximity,
one of them knows what the other
knows, almost immediately.
And they metabolize oil
like a combustion engine.
Dowd, what are you doing?
I'm a scientist.
I'm being a scientist.
No.
You are falling in love.
This is some sort of Stockholm syndrome.
That's backwards.
Whatever.
Okay.
Look, in two days,
our wastewater goes to Ohio.
The mucous twins go with.
Going to shoot it down deep
into an injection well.
No trace.
No. They're not like
mindless ground slugs.
They have intelligence, they show emotion.
It would be unethical to kill them.
Unethical?
Dowd, you and I have been
together a long time.
I have seen you stretch the truth,
falsify environmental protection reports,
and lie to the media.
We are in this together.
Cheer up.
And keep those things quiet!
Tripp. Tripp!
What are you doing?
He's gone.
Creech!
Why would he leave?
I don't know,
but we better find him before they do.
Yeah, well, he took off
with my cell phone,
so I can't even call anybody
to come pick us up.
It's okay. I have mine.
Wait, your cell phone's in the truck?
Yeah.
I have an app. We can track him.
There he is.
Where is he going?
I don't know.
It's here. Stop, stop here.
Wait. Terravex?
Are you sure this is far enough?
Would you mind dropping us off
at the end of the block?
He's not there.
Maybe he went inside.
What is that?
I don't know.
He came here for them.
That's why he left.
No, don't! Don't!
Hey, guys, check on warehouse three.
No! Stop! Stop!
Slow it down. Tranquilize it!
No!
Hey! Stop.
Shoot it!
Stop!
Stop! You're killing him!
Scrape it up.
Bring them with me.
Well, you certainly love your cats.
It's all cats.
Oh! Here we go.
Delete. Delete. Delete.
Delete.
Thank you.
You can't just delete pictures
and think this goes away.
Why? What are you going to do?
Go to the police and tell them
that there are monsters
coming up out of the oil fields?
How'd that work out for you last time?
Look.
Hurting people, is not my thing.
It's his.
Mr. Burke,
show these two the highway.
Let's go!
To your left.
Okay! I'll take them from here.
Thanks, Charlie.
Tenneson's orders. So, it all checks out.
Just keep walking normally.
Get your hands off us, slimebag.
Okay, it's not slime, it's sweat.
I sweat when I'm nervous.
Thanks for calling attention to it. Look.
I'm on your side.
What?
Spiritually.
Okay, I'm messing this up.
Sorry. I'm a scientist, a geologist.
But I want to help you.
Why?
Because I can't just stand here
and watch them die.
And why should we trust you?
Because these creatures are special.
I think that you've seen that, too.
Now,
I've done some bad things
for this company. But this...
No way. Okay?
I'm done doing their dirty work.
Okay, then help us get them out of here.
We need to get them home.
It's not that simple.
Okay. It's 50 miles of rough terrain
back to the vent.
Any truck big enough to carry them
would be too slow and we'd get caught.
I got a truck fast enough.
We just gotta find two more.
If you think we can do this, I'm in.
We can.
Okay, hands in.
I'm sorry. You're just so sweaty.
Mr. Weathers,
there's a lot of really weird stuff
going on right now and I need your help.
What do you need?
I need trucks.
Do you have any on your repo list?
It's not our fault rich boy
can't make his payments.
Yeah!
Show me something! Come on!
Yeah! Keep tagging him!
I don't see anything on this that will carry
that big sucker I saw in the warehouse.
What are you gonna need
to do to these trucks?
Well,
lift the engine, raise the suspension,
cut up the body, customize the axles,
and maximize the airflow.
All by morning. Twice.
Maybe we'd get one done, but two?
I don't have the tools or the parts
to get it done that quick.
Do you know someone with a repair shop?
Or...
A dealership.
You know, you're going to have to, like,
hang out with him and stuff after this.
Maybe once.
You'll be out by 7:00, right?
The first workers get here at 7:00.
Yeah.
What's the best truck you got on the lot?
Well, it's supposed to be
my 16th birthday present.
No harm getting an early peek, right?
Can you handle one of these?
Yeah.
Be careful, it'll run away from you.
Here you go. Drink up.
We're going on a little road trip.
Hey, man, you mind
helping me out with this?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Come on, man. Let's pick it up.
Got to get those things
to the wastewater tank
before they ship out.
What's got into these things?
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Yeah, get Burke on the phone.
And start a trace on the box truck.
The big one.
Dowd.
Hey, I got them,
but there's not much time.
Tenneson probably already
has Burke coming for us.
Hey. Nice job.
Thank you.
I never drove a stick before.
It was very exciting.
Cool. Want to give me a hand with this?
Yeah.
Well, I'll be...
Hey, there.
You're looking good.
For you.
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, I missed you.
I missed you, too.
They're a family.
He was looking for his parents.
I got the truck. It's stationary.
Load up! Let's go! We got them!
No turning back now.
All right, this one's yours.
Someone say I'm coming with you?
Come on, man, we need you.
Okay.
If I'm going to go to prison,
it might as well be in style.
Okay. The vents are marked on this.
I'll follow you.
Yeah.
You said these guys have
hive intelligence, right?
Yeah.
Well, then he'll know what to do.
You're just there to guide him.
Right.
Be gentle, but firm.
That opens.
Let him know you're the one steering.
Right. Gentle but firm.
I'm the one steering.
Okay.
Hey.
Go do this. Yeah.
Thanks, Mr. Weathers.
Hope you picked something up
from watching me.
A week ago, you were riding a bicycle.
Welcome to Geldon Dodge.
Can we get you a cup
of complimentary coffee?
They're on the move.
What?
What about the next slide?
They're on the move in what?
These guys were ready for a walk.
They're happy they're going home.
We just picked them up
on a police scanner.
Off Old Cutler Road.
It's close, about a mile south.
There they are. Ten o'clock.
Here we go.
I can't believe I let you
and your girlfriend talk me into this.
We're not... That's not...
Are we?
Hey, Sheriff,
we got a call from Ken Galloway.
Said a bunch of trucks rode over his land.
He said they looked like monster trucks.
Yeah, which way were they headed?
Okay, let's take out Big Green first.
I'll take left.
Roger that. Taking right.
He needs help.
Get behind him, Meredith. Give him a push.
What?
I really hope they had their seatbelts on.
We can't outrun them in the flats.
Just hang on.
We'll lose them in the rough.
Stay close here, guys.
It's going to get tight.
We'll get them on the ridge.
Do we know where we're going?
Don't worry, they know.
Downed tree, dead ahead!
Do we have a tree plan?
Okay, guys. And pull!
Okay, Dowd, you can open your eyes now.
Did we make it?
Everybody, stay close.
It's going to get tight up here.
They're right behind me!
Tripp, on your right!
All right, kid,
this is where your little joyride ends!
Help!
Tripp!
Thanks, buddy!
Tripp, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm...
What is that?
Tenneson.
It's poison! We gotta stop that tanker.
They're going to poison the nest.
Okay. We need to move faster.
Come on!
Light it up.
Get back! Stay back!
We got 'em now!
I see 'em! Go up the left side!
Rick?
Get to the sides! Get to the sides!
I cannot believe you're here.
I'm actually really happy to see you.
Hey, I told you I wasn't going anywhere.
The vents are right on the other side.
We have to get past this truck.
It's the only way.
Hang, on, Tripp,
you're not seeing what I'm seeing.
No, I got it right here.
I know what we're in for.
I seriously hope you're not
thinking about jumping off a mountain.
As the only scientist here,
I don't think they can do that.
We don't have a choice.
I hope you know what you're doing, Tripp.
Rick, give us something to jump.
Yeah. Okay.
Tripp, there's a 99% chance
that would be impossible.
Maybe 100%.
You be careful, son.
Rick, I'm sorry I said all those
terrible things about you.
Wait, what?
Let's go!
Come on, Creech!
Go, Tripp!
We made it!
You guys take out the pumps,
I'll handle the tanker.
Got it.
We're on it.
Hey, there's another one.
Pumps are at speed!
We need to stop those pumps.
Come on. One last push.
You're almost home.
Any trucks still running,
get up here to the vents.
Can we stop it?
It locked me out.
If this pressure gets to 15,000 psi,
the poison will reach
all the way down to the nest.
Come on, buddy, wake up! You can do it!
The valves!
Come on, come on!
Rightytighty.
We have to stop the poison!
It's not working! We're too late!
Go! Get out! Save yourself!
Tripp!
We did it.
I'm going to miss you, Creech.
You were a good truck.
Don't worry. I know where to find you.
Tripp!
Tripp!
You stay put. We got you.
Hi, Fish and Wildlife?
Yeah, my friends and I found
some horned lizards
on the Terravex property.
Are they endangered, by any chance?
Well, it's nothing like my old one,
but I think it'll do.
Yeah.
Now you can do
whatever you want this summer.
Take it as far as it'll go.
Thanks, Rick.
