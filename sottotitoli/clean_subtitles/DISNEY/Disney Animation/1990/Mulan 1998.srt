We're under attack!|Light the signal!
Light the fire now!| Light the signal!
Now all of China|knows you're here.
Perfect.
Your Majesty, the Huns have|crossed our Northern border.
Impossible.|No one can get through the Great Wall.
ShanYu is leading them.
We'll set up defenses|around your palace immediately.
No. Send your troops|to protect my people. Chi Fu.
Yes, Your Highness? Deliver conscription|notices throughout all the provinces.
Call up reserves and|as many new recruits as possible.
Forgive me, Your Majesty,|but I believe my troops can stop him.
I won't take|any chances, General.
A single grain of rice|can tip the scale.
One man may be the difference|between victory and defeat.
Quiet and demure.
Graceful. Polite.
Delicate.
Refined. Poised.
Punctual.
Punctual.
Aiyah!|Little Brother!
Little Brother. Lit
Ah! There you are.
Who's the smartest doggy in|the world? Come on, smart boy.
Can you help me with my chores today?
Honorable ancestors,
please help Mulan|impress the Matchmaker today.
Please.
Please help her.
Father, I brought your
Mulan.| I brought a spare.
Mulan. Remember, the doctor said|three cups of tea in the morning...
Mulan.| and three at night.
Mulan, you should already be in town.|We are counting on you
To uphold the family honor.
Don't worry, Father.|I won't let you down.
Wish me luck.| Hurry!
I'm going to...|pray some more.
Fa Li, is your daughter|here yet?
The Matchmaker|is not a patient woman.
Of all days to be late I should have|prayed to the ancestors for luck.
How lucky can they be?|They're dead.
Besides, I've got|all the luck we'll need.
This is your chance|to prove yourself.
Grandma, no!
Yep, this cricket's|a lucky one!
I'm here.
What? But Mama,|I had to
None of your excuses.|Now, let's get you cleaned up.
This is what you give me|to work with
Well, honey|I've seen worse
We're gonna turn this sow's ear
Into a silk purse| It's freezing.
It would have been warm|if you were here on time.
We'll have you|washed and dried
Primped and polished|till you glow with pride
Trust my recipe|for instant bride
You'll bring honor|to us all
Mulan, what's this?| Uh, notes,
in case|I forget something.
Hold this.|We'll need more luck than I thought.
Wait and see|when we're through
Boys will gladly|go to war for you
With good fortune| And a great hairdo
You'll bring honor to us all
A girl can bring|her family
Great honor in one way
By striking a good match| Huh?
And this could be the day
Men want girls|with good taste
Calm. Obedient.| Who work fastpaced
With good breeding| And a tiny waist
You'll bring honor to us all
We all must serve|our Emperor
Who guards us|from the Huns
The men by bearing arms
A girl by bearing sons
When we're through you can't fail
Like a lotus blossom|soft and pale
How could any fellow|say no sale
You'll bring honor|to us all
You'll bring honor|to us all
You'll bring honor|to us all
There.|You're ready.
Not yet.|An apple for serenity.
A pendant for balance.
Beads of jade
For beauty
You must proudly
Show it
Now add a cricket
Just for luck
And even you|can't blow it
Ancestors|Hear my plea
Help me not to make|a fool of me
And to not uproot|my family tree
Keep my father|standing tall
Scarier than|the undertaker
We are meeting|our Matchmaker
Destiny Guard our girls
And our future|as it fast unfurls
Please look kindly|on these cultured pearls
Each a perfect|porcelain doll
Please bring honor to us| Please bring honor to us
Please bring honor to us| Please bring honor to us
Please bring honor|to us all
"Fa Mulan."
Present.| Speaking without permission.
Oops.| Who spit in her bean curd?
Mmm. Too skinny.
Hmph! Not good|for bearing sons.
Recite the|final admonition.
Well?
Fulfill your duties|calmly and... respectfully.
Um, reflect before you snack
Act! This shall bring you|honor and glory.
Hmm. This way.
Now, pour the tea.
To please|your future inlaws,
you must demonstrate|a sense of dignity...
and refinement.
You must also be poised.
Um, pardon me.| And silent!
Could I just take that back?
One moment.
Why, you clumsy
I think it's going well, don't you?
Put it out! Put it out!|Put it out!
You are a disgrace!
You may look like a bride,
but you will never|bring your family honor!
Look at me
I will never pass
For a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meant|to play this part
Now I see
That if I were truly|to be myself
I would break|my family's heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight
Back at me
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When will|my reflection show
Who I am inside
When will|my reflection show
Who I am
Inside
My, my.
What beautiful blossoms|we have this year.
But, look,|this one's late.
But I'll bet that|when it blooms,
it will be|the most beautiful of all.
What is it?
Mulan.
Stay inside.
Citizens, I bring|a proclamation...
from the Imperial City.
The Huns have invaded China.
By order of the Emperor,
one man from every family|must serve in the Imperial Army.
The Hsiao family.
The Yi family.
I will serve the Emperor|in my father's place.
The Fa family.| No!
I am ready to serve|the Emperor.
Father, you can't go.| Mulan!
Please, sir, my father has already|fought bravely... Silence!
You would do well to teach your daughter|to hold her tongue in a man's presence.
Mulan, you dishonor me.
Report tomorrow|to the Wu Zhong camp.
Yes, sir.
The Chu family!
The Wen family!
The Chang family!
You shouldn't have to go!| Mulan
There are plenty of young men|to fight for China.
It is an honor to protect|my country and my family.
So, you'll die for honor.
I will die|doing what's right.
But if you... I know my place!|It is time you learned yours.
Mulan is gone!
What?
It can't be.
Mulan!
No.
You must go after her.|She could be killed.
If I reveal her,
she will be.
Ancestors, hear our prayer.
Watch over Mulan.
Mushu, awaken.
I live!
So tell me what mortal needs|my protection, Great Ancestor.
You just say the word and I'm there.| Mushu
And let me say somethin'. Anybody's who's|foolish enough to threaten our family,
vengeance will be mine!
Mushu!
These are|the family guardians.
They| Protect the family.
And you, O Demoted One?
I... ring the gong.
That's right.|Now, wake up the ancestors.
One family reunion comin' right up.
Okay, people, people, look alive.|Let's go. Come on. Get up.
Let's move it. Rise and shine. Y'all way|past the beauty sleep thing, trust me.
I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan|was a troublemaker from the start!
Don't look at me. She gets it|from your side of the family.
She's just trying|to help her father.
But if she's discovered,|Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.
Dishonor will come to the family.|Traditional values will disintegrate.
Not to mention,|they'll lose the farm.
My children never caused such trouble.|They all became acupuncturists.
Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.| No!
Your greatgranddaughter|had to be a crossdresser!
Let a guardian bring her back.| Yes, awaken the most cunning.
No. The swiftest.
No. Send the wisest.| Silence!
We must send|the most powerful of all.
Okay, okay,|I get the drift. I'll go.
Oh, y'all don't think I can do it.|Watch this here.
Aha! Jump back.|I'm pretty hot, huh?
Don't make me have to singe|nobody to prove no point.
You had your chance|to protect the Fa family.
Your misguidance led|Fa Deng to disaster.
Yeah, thanks a lot.| And your point is?
The point is we will be sending|a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.
What What|I'm a real dragon!
You are not worthy of this spot.|Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.
So you'll get back to me|on the job thing?
Just one chance,|is that too much to ask?
I mean, it's not like|it'd kill ya.
Yo, Rocky, wake up!|Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!
Come on, boy!|Go get her! Go on!
Come on.
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!
Uhoh.
Uh, Stony?
Stony? Oh, man,|they're gonna kill me.
Great Stone Dragon,
have you awakened?
Uh, uh, uh, uh|Yes, I just woke up.
I'm I'm the Great|Stone Dragon. Good morning.
I will go forth|and fetch Mulan.
Did Did I mention that|I was the Great Stone Dragon?
Go! The fate|of the Fa family...
rests in your claws.
Don't even worry about it.|I will not lose face.
My elbow!
I know I twisted somethin'.
That's just great.|Now what?
I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man decides|to take her little drag show on the road.
Go get her? What's the matter|with you? After this Great Stone,
Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her|home with a medal to get back in the temple.
Wait a minute. That's it!
I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll be|begging me to come back to work.
That's the master plan.|Ah, you done it now, man.
Hey, what makes you|think you're comin'?
You're lucky?
Do I look like a sucker to you?
What you mean, a loser? How|'bout I pop one of your antennas|off, throw it across the yard?
Then who's the loser, me or you?
Imperial scouts.
ShanYu.
Nice work, gentlemen.|You found the Hun Army.
The Emperor|will stop you.
Stop me?|He invited me.
By building his wall,|he challenged my strength.
Well, I'm here|to play his game.
Go! Tell your Emperor|to send his strongest armies.
I'm ready.
How many men does it take|to deliver a message?
One.
Okay, okay,|how about this?
Excuse me.
Where do I sign in?
Ha, I see you have a sword.|I have one too.
They're very manly|and... tough.
I'm working on it!
Oh, who am I fooling?
It's going to take a miracle|to get me into the army.
Did I hear someone ask|for a miracle?
Let me hear you say "aaah"!
That's close enough.| A ghost.
Get ready, Mulan.|Your serpentine salvation is at hand!
For I have been sent|by your ancestors...
to guide you through|your masquerade.
Come on. If you're gonna stay,|you're gonna work.
So heed my word! 'Cause if|the army finds out you're a girl,
the penalty is death!
Who are you?| Who am I? Who am I?
I am the guardian|of lost souls.
I am the powerful,|the pleasurable,
the indestructible Mushu.
Pretty hot, huh?
Uh, my ancestors sent|a little lizard to help me?
Hey, dragon, dragon,|not lizard.
I don't do that tongue thing.
You're, um
Intimidating?|Awe inspiring?
Tiny. Of course. I'm travel|size for your convenience.
If I was my real size,|your cow here would die of fright.
Down, Bessie. My powers are|beyond your mortal imagination.
For instance, my eyes can see|straight through your armor.
All right, that's it! Dishonor!|Dishonor on your whole family.
Make a note of this. Dishonor on you,|dishonor on your cow, dis
Stop. I'm sorry.|I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.|I've never done this before.
Then you're gonna have to trust me.|And don't you slap me no more.
We clear on that?|All right.
Okeydokey. Let's get this show|on the road! CriKee, get the bags.
Let's move it, heifer.
Okay, this is it.|Time to show 'em your man walk.
Shoulders back, chest high,|feet apart, head up and strut.
Two, three Break it down.|Hup, two, three. And work it!
Beautiful, isn't he?| They're disgusting.
No, they're men. Now, you gonna have to|act just like them, so pay attention.
Look. This tattoo|will protect me from harm.
I hope you can|get your money back.
I don't think|I can do this.
It's all attitude.|Be tough, like this guy here.
What are you lookin' at?
Punch him.|It's how men say hello.
Oh, Yao,|you've made a friend.
Good. Now slap him on the behind.|They like that.
I'm gonna hit you so hard,|it'll make your ancestors dizzy.
Yao, relax and chant with me.
Feel better?
Yeah. Ahh, you ain't|worth my time.
Chicken boy.| Chicken boy?
Say that to my face,|ya limp noodle!
Oh. Sorry, Ling.
Whoa! You're dead!
Oh, there he goes!
Hey, guys.
The Huns have struck here,|here and here.
I will take the main troops|up to the Tung Shao Pass...
and stop ShanYu|before he destroys this village.
Excellent strategy, sir.
I do love surprises.
You will stay and train|the new recruits.
When Chi Fu believes|you're ready,
you will join us, Captain.
Captain?
This is an enormous|responsibility, General.
Perhaps a soldier|with more experience.
Number one in his class, extensive|knowledge of training techniques,
and impressive|military lineage.
I believe Li Shang will do|an excellent job.
Oh, I will. I won't let you down.|This is I mean
Yes, sir.| Very good then.
We'll toast China's victory|at the Imperial City.
I'll expect a full report|in three weeks.
And I won't leave|anything out.
Captain Li Shang.
Leader of China's|finest troops.
No. The greatest troops of all time.
Most impressive.
Good luck, Captain. Hyah!
Good luck, Father.
Day one.
Soldiers!
He started it!
I don't need anyone|causing trouble in my camp.
Sorry. Uh
I mean, uh, sorry you had to see that.
But you know how it is when you get those|manly urges and you just gotta kill somethin',
fix things, cook outdoors
What's your name?
Your commanding officer|just asked you a question.
Uh, I've got a name.|Ha! And it's a boy's name too.
Ling. How 'bout Ling?| His name is Ling.
I didn't ask for his name.|I asked for yours!
Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.| Ah Chu.
Ah Chu?| Gesundheit. Ha, ha. I kill myself.
Mushu.| Mushu?
No.| Then what is it?
Ping was my best friend growin' up.| It's Ping.
Ping?| Of course, Ping did steal my
Yes, my name is Ping.
Let me see your|conscription notice.
Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?| I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.
Um, he doesn't talk about me much.
I can see why.|That boy's an absolute lunatic.
Okay, gentlemen,|thanks to your new friend, Ping,
you'll spend tonight picking up|every single grain of rice.
And tomorrow, the real work begins.
You know, we have to work|on your people skills.
All right! Rise and shine,|Sleeping Beauty.
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.
Get your clothes on. Get ready.|Got breakfast for ya.
Look, you get porridge,|and it's happy to see you.
Hey, get outta there!|You gonna make people sick.
Am I late? No time to talk. Now remember,|it's your first day of training,
so listen to your teacher and no|fightin', play nice with the other kids,
unless one of the other kids wanna fight,|then you have to kick the other kid's butt.
But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.| Don't talk with your mouth full.
Now let's see your war face.
Oh, I think my bunny slippers just ran|for cover. Come on! Scare me, girl.
Yeah, that's my tough lookin' warrior.
That's what I'm talkin' about.|Now, get out there and make me proud.
What do you mean, the troops just left?| They what?
Wait!|You forgot your sword.
My little baby,|off to destroy people.
Order. People, order.
I'd like a panfried noodle.| Oh, oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.
Moo goo gai pan.| That's not funny.
Looks like our new friend|slept in this morning.
Hello, Ping.|Are ya hungry?
Yeah, 'cause I owe you|a knuckle sandwich.
Soldiers!
You will assemble swiftly|and silently every morning.
Anyone who acts otherwise...
will answer to me.
Eeew. Tough guy.
Yao.
Thank you for volunteering.|Retrieve the arrow.
I'll get that arrow,|pretty boy,
and I'll do it|with my shirt on.
One moment. You seem|to be missing something.
This represents discipline,
and this|represents strength.
You need both|to reach the arrow.
We've got a long way to go.
Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns
Hooah!| Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons
You're the saddest bunch|I ever met
But you can bet|before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man
Out of you
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale|pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll|make a man
Out of you
I'm never gonna|catch my breath
Say goodbye|to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool|in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish|that I knew how to swim
Be a man| We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man| With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man| With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side|of the moon
Time is racing toward us
Till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order
And you might survive
You're unsuited for|the rage of war
So pack up, go home|You're through
How could I|make a man
Out of you
Be a man| We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man| With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man| With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side
Of the moon
Be a man| We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man| With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man|With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side
Of the moon
What do you see?
Black pine,|from the high mountains.
White horse hair.|Imperial stallions.
Sulphur, from cannons.
This doll came from a village|in the Tung Shao Pass...
where the Imperial Army|is waiting for us.
We can avoid them easily.
No.
The quickest way to the Emperor|is through that pass.
And besides, the little girl|will be missing her doll.
We should return it to her.
No, this is not a good|idea. What if somebody sees you?
Just because I look like a man|doesn't mean I have to smell like one.
So a couple of guys don't rinse|out their socks. Picky, picky, picky.
Well, myself, I kind of|like that corn chip smell.
Okay, all right. That's enough. Get|out before you get all pruny and stuff.
Mushu, if you're so worried,|go stand watch.
Yeah, yeah.|"Stand watch, Mushu,
while I blow our secret|with my stupid girlie habits."
Pfft! Hygiene!
Me first! Me first!
We're doomed! There are a couple of|things I know they're bound to notice!
Hey, Ping!
Oh, hi, guys.|I didn't know you were here.
I was just washing. So now I'm clean,|and I'm gonna go. Byebye.
Come back here.|I know we were jerks to you before,
so let's start over.
Hi. I'm Ling.
And I'm ChienPo.| Hello, ChienPo.
And I am Yao!
King of the rock!
And there's nothin'|you girls can do about it.
Oh, yeah?|Well, I think Ping and I can take you.
I really don't wanna take him anywhere.| Ping, we have to fight!
No, we don't. Uh, we, uh, could just|close our eyes and swim around.
Come on. Don't be|such a gir
Ouch! Something bit me!
What a nasty flavor.
Snake!
Oooh, snake! Snake!
Snake! Snake!
Some king of the rock.
Boy, that was close.
No. That was vile.
You owe me big.
I never want to see|a naked man again.
Hey, don't look at me.|I ain't bitin' no more butts.
You think your troops|are ready to fight?
Ha! They would not last a minute|against the Huns!
They completed their training.| Those boys...
are no more fit to be soldiers|than you are to be captain.
Once the General|reads my report,
your troops|will never see battle.
Oh, no, you don't! I've worked|too hard to get Mulan into this war.
This guy's messin'|with my plan.
We're not finished!
Be careful, Captain.|The General may be your father,
but I am|the Emperor's counsel.
And, oh, by the way,|I got that job on my own.
You're dismissed.
Hey. I'll hold him|and you punch.
Or not.
For what it's worth,|I think you're a great captain.
I saw that.| What?
You like him, don't you?
No!| Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.|Go to your tent!
I think it's time we took|this war into our own hands.
Let me see what you got. "From General Li.|Dear Son, we're waiting for Huns at the Pass.
It would mean a lot|if you'd come and back us up."
That's great, except you forgot,|"And since we're out of potpourri,
perhaps you wouldn't mind|bringing up some. "
Hello! This is the army! Make it sound|more urgent! Know what I'm talkin' about?
That's better.|Much better. Let's go.
Khanny, baby.|Hey, we need a ride.
Insubordinate ruffians!
You men owe me a new pair of slippers!
And I do not squeal like a girl.
Urgent news|from the General.
What's the matter? You've never seen|a black and white before?
Who are you?
Excuse me? I think|the question is, who are you?
We're in a war, man!|There's no time for stupid questions!
I should have your hat for that.|Snatch it right off your head.
But I'm feeling gracious today,|so carry on before I report you.
Captain, urgent news from the General!|We're needed at the front.
Pack your bags, CriKee.|We're movin' out.
For a long time we've been marching|off to battle
In our thundering herd|we feel a lot like cattle
Like a pounding beat|our aching feet
Aren't easy to ignore
Hey!|Think of instead
A girl|worth fighting for
Huh?| That's what I said.
A girl|worth fighting for
I want her paler|than the moon
With eyes that shine|like stars
My girl will marvel at my strength
Adore my battle scars
I couldn't care less what she'll wear|or what she looks like
It all depends on|what she cooks like
Beef, pork, chicken|Mmm
Bet the local girls thought you|were quite the charmer
And I'll bet the ladies|love a man in armor
You can guess what|we have missed the most
Since we went off to war
What do we want| A girl worth fighting for
My girl will think|I have no faults
That I'm a major find
Uh, how 'bout a girl|who's got a brain
Who always speaks her mind| Nah!
My manly ways|and turn of phrase
Are sure to thrill her
He thinks he's|such a lady killer
I've a girl back home|who's unlike any other
Yeah, the only girl|who'd love him is his mother
But when we come home in victory
They'll line up|at the door
What do we want| A girl worth fighting for
Wish that I had| A girl worth fighting for
A girl worth fighting
Search for survivors.
I don't understand.|My father should've been here.
Captain!
The General.
I'm sorry.
The Huns are moving quickly.
We'll make better time to the Imperial|City through the Tung Shao Pass.
We're the only hope|for the Emperor now.
Move out!
What happened?
Um... You just gave away|our position! Now we're
Um... You just gave away|our position! Now we're
Get out of range!
Save the cannons!
Come on! Empty it! Empty it!
Oh, sure.|Save the horse.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold the last cannon.
Prepare to fight.|If we die, we die with honor.
Yao, aim the cannon|at ShanYu.
Hey!| Ping! Come back!
Ping!
Stop!
All right. You might want to|light that right about now.
Quickly. Quickly!
Come on!|We gotta help!
You missed!|How could you miss?
It was three feet|in front of you!
Mulan!
Mulan!
Mulan?
No.
Mulan!
Man, you are|one lucky bug.
Shang!
Do you see them?| Yes.
Perfect.|Now we'll pull them to safety.
Hey, Mulan!|I found the lucky cricket!
We need help.
Ooh, nice. Very nice.|You can sit by me.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!|We are definitely gonna die.
No way we survive this.|Death is coming!
I let them slip through my fingers.
Pull!
I knew we could do it.|You the man!
Well, sort of.
Step back, guys.|Give him some air.
Ping?
You are the craziest man I've ever met.
And for that,|I owe you my life.
From now on,|you have my trust.
Let's hear it for Ping!|The bravest of us all!
You're king of the mountain!| Yes, yes, yes!
Ping! What's wrong?
He's wounded!|Get help!
Ping, hold on.
Hold on.
I can explain.
So it's true!
Shang!
I knew there was|something wrong with you.
A woman!
Treacherous snake!
My name is Mulan.
I did it|to save my father.
High treason!| I didn't mean for it to go this far.
Ultimate dishonor!
It was the only way.|Please believe me.
Captain?
Restrain him!
No!| You know the law.
A life for a life.
My debt is repaid.
Move out!| But you can't just
I said, "Move out."
I was this close.
This close|to impressin' the ancestors,
gettin' the top shelf,|an entourage.
Man. All my fine work.|Pfft.
Hi.
I should never have left home.
Hey, come on.|You went to save your father's life.
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him|and disgracing your ancestors...
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gotta|You gotta learn to let these things go.
Maybe I didn't go|for my father.
Maybe what I really wanted was to prove|I could do things right...
so when I looked in the mirror,
I'd see someone worthwhile.
But I was wrong.
I see nothing.
Now, that's just 'cause|this needs a little spit, that's all.
Let me shine this up for ya.
I can see you. Look at you.|You look so pretty.
The truth is,|we're both frauds.
Your ancestors never sent me.|They don't even like me.
I mean, you risked your life|to help people you love.
I risked your life|to help myself.
At least|you had good intentions.
What? What do you mean,|"You're not lucky"?
You lied to me?
And what are you, a sheep?
I'll have to face my father|sooner or later.
Let's go home.
Yeah. This ain't|gonna be pretty.
But don't you worry, okay?|Things will work out.
We started this thing together,|and that's how we'll finish it.
I promise.
Uh, home is that way.
I have to do something.| Did you see those Huns?
They popped out of the snow...|Iike daisies!
Are we in this together|or not?
Well, let's go kick|some Hunny buns!
Make way for the heroes|of China.
Shang!| Mulan?
The Huns are alive!|They're in the city!
You don't belong here,|Mulan. Go home.
Shang, I saw them in the mountains.|You have to believe me.
Why should I?
Why else would I come back?
You said you'd trust Ping.|Why is Mulan any different?
Keep your eyes open.|I know they're here. Yah!
Now, where are you going?
To find someone|who will believe me.
My children,|heaven smiles down...
upon the Middle Kingdom.
China will sleep|safely tonight...
thanks to|our brave warriors.
Sir, the Emperor's in danger.
But the Huns are here.
Please, you have to help.
No one will listen. Huh? Oh,|I'm sorry. Did you say something?
Mushu.| Hey, you're a girl again, remember?
Your Majesty, I present to you|the sword of ShanYu.
I know what this means|to you, Captain Li.
Your father would have been|very proud.
No!| Come on!
They'll never reach|the Emperor in time.
Hey, guys!
I've got an idea.
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river| Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon| Be a man
With all the strength|of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side|of the moon
Boo.
Guard the door.
Your walls and armies have fallen,|and now it's your turn.
Bow to me.
Okay. Any questions?
Does this dress|make me look fat?
Who's there?
Concubines.| Ugly concubines.
Oh, he's so cute!
Now, that's what I call|Mongolian barbecue.
Shang, go!
I tire of your arrogance,|old man. Bow to me!
No matter how the wind howls,|the mountain cannot bow to it.
Then you will kneel|in pieces!
ChienPo, get the Emperor!
Sorry, Your Majesty.
No!
Come on!
No.
You!
You took away my victory!| No!
I did.
The soldier|from the mountains.
So what's the plan?
Um| You don't have a plan?
Hey, I'm making this up|as l... go.
Mushu!| Way ahead of you, sister.
Come on, CriKee.
Citizens, I need firepower.| Who are you?
Your worst nightmare.
On the roof!| Look!
It looks like|you're out of ideas.
Not quite.
Ready, Mushu?
I am ready, baby!|Light me.
Get off the roof, get off the roof,|get off the roof.
You are a lucky bug.
That was a deliberate attempt|on my life!
Where is she?|Now she's done it.
What a mess!|Stand aside!
That creature's|not worth protecting.
She's a hero.| 'Tis a woman.
She'll never be worth anything.| Listen, you pompous
That is enough.
Your Majesty,|I can explain.
I've heard a great deal|about you, Fa Mulan.
You stole your father's armor,|ran away from home,
impersonated a soldier,
deceived|your commanding officer,
dishonored the Chinese Army,|destroyed my palace...
and...
you have saved us all.
My little baby is all grown up and|and savin' China.
You have a tissue?
Chi Fu?
Your Excellency? See to it that this|woman is made a member of my council.
Member? What?
But... there are|no council positions open,
Your Majesty.
Very well.|You can have his job.
What? I Oh.
With all due respect,|Your Excellency,
I think I've been away|from home long enough.
Then... take this,
so your family will know|what you have done for me.
And this,
so the world will know|what you have done for China.
Is she allowed|to do that?
Um... you
you fight good.
Ohh. Thank you.
Khan, let's go home.
The flower that blooms|in adversity...
is the most rare|and beautiful of all.
Sir? You don't meet a girl|like that every dynasty.
Mulan!
Father, I brought you|the sword of ShanYu.
And the crest|of the Emperor.
They're gifts|to honor the Fa family.
The greatest gift and honor|is having you for a daughter.
I've missed you so.
I've missed you too, Baba.
Great.
She brings home a sword. If you ask me,|she should've brought home a man.
Excuse me.|Does Fa Mulan live here?
Thank you.
Whoo! Sign me up|for the next war.
Honorable Fa Zhou, l|Mulan!
Uh... you forgot|your helmet.
WWell, actually,|it's your helmet, isn't it?
I mean| Would you like to stay for dinner?
Would you like|to stay forever?
Dinner would be great.
Come on.|Who did a good job?
Come on. Tell me.|Who did a good job?
Oh, all right!|You can be a guardian again.
Take it, CriKee!
You know, she gets it|from my side of the family.
Call out for egg rolls!
Guardians.
Oh.| Thanks, Mushu.
Mushu!

To fly
And I burn
With a need to know
The reason why
Why must we all conceal
What we think|How we feel
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide
I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside
