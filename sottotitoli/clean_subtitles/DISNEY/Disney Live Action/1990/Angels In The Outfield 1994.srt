Roger, Do you believe in heaven? 
I guess. 
That's where they 
say my mom went. 
Maybe, that's where my dad went. 
Probably. 
Maybe your mom 
and my dad are friends up there. 
That could be. 
Cause your my best friend down here. 
You're my best friend too, JP. 
Roger, how come Maggie's house 
is called a foster home? 
I don't know. 
Maybe the first people 
who let other people's kids... 
...live with them were named "Foster." 
Oh. 
So, If we stay there 
a long time... 
...do we gotta change 
our name to Foster? 
No way. 
Good. 
Besides, we're not gonna 
be there a long time. 
Really? 
Yeah, somethin' good's gonna happen. 
Yeah, somethin' good. 
Maybe today, even. It could happen. 


So, the Angels 
trying to break a 14game losing streak... 
...face the Toronto Blue Jays 
here this afternoon at Anaheim Stadium. 

Maggie, we're back! 
So, where you been? 
Just riding around. 
You said be back by 5:00. 
I can't tell time yet. 
Are we back by 5:00? 
Close. Come on, JP, 
get your bike in. 
Roger? You have a visitor. 
Yeah? 
He's waiting inside for you. 
Is it? 
Dad? 
Hey. 
Dad. 
Suprised to see me? 
Yeah. 
You look kinda scrawny. Don't 
they feed you enough in this place? 
Yeah. 
Where you been? I was waiting. 
Just ridin' around the stadium. 
Angels still your team? 
Yeah. 
They're in last place. 
Yeah. 
Runs in the blood. 
Family that likes losers. 

So, I came to say 
that I'm goin' up north. 
I know I said when I came 
it'd be to get you, but... 
Things ain't workin' out that way. 
I did what I could with ya. 
Maybe if your mom was alive, 
it'd be different. 
I, uh__ They had me sign 
this thing, this paper... 
...some kind of release thing. 
Uh, just gotta go to 
court to make it final. 
You understand 
what I'm sayin', don't ya? 
Yyeah. 
Okay, I'm glad we got that outta the way. 
Where's the pickup? 
Oh, I traded it in. 
The bike's better for travellin'. 
DDad, when we gonna be 
a family again? 
From where I'm sittin'. 
I'd say when the Angels win the pennant. 
You stay outta trouble, son. 


Number 27., shortstop Steve Acker. 

So with the Angels down by seven... 
...it's now one ball 
two strikes to Acker... 
the fourth batter to face 
Gates here in the eighth. 
Come on. Strike him out! 
Yeah! Strike him out! 

Burn it in there. 
Come on, Angels! 
Let's stay in this. 

Gates takes the sign... 
checks the runner at first 
and delivers. 
Acker lofts the ball 
high into left field. 
Gates, you stink! 
Norton and Williams 
both going for the catch. 
II got it. I got it. 
And this'll be Ben Williams's call. 

And Williams and Norton collide, 
and the catch is blown! 


Boy, they're bad! 
Ohh! 
And with another example 
of his infamous temper... 
manager George Knox calls time out. 
He will have a word 
with his pitcher, Frank Gates. 
I don't think it's 
gonna be a happy word. 
And it looks like Knox 
is going to take Gates out. 
Gates doesn't look 
too pleased about this. 
Gimme the ball. 
It ain't my fault. 
You need a new outfield. 
You're outta here! 
Gimme the ball! 
You want the ball? 
Here you go. Go get it! 
Gates has thrown his ball... 
And my glove? Go get it! 
and glove into the stands. 
Go on! Get outta here! 
You're finished, Gates! 
And Knox has attacked his own pitcher! 
Uhoh! 
Skip, Skip. 
Let him go, Skip. 
Get off me! You're crazy, Knox! 
You're washed up! You'll never pitch again! 
They're clearing 
the benches! 
Now both teams are on the field! 
Hey! It's not our fight! 
George Knox 
has created total chaos! 
Hit him one for me, Gates! 
I can't find him! 
You're crazy! 
You can't manage a team! 
This is outrageous! 
George Knox fighting off his own players. 
Surprise, surprise. 
And they're trying to keep 
Knox and Gates apart. 
Come on! I said, let me go! 
You stink, Knox! 
Knox! You're outta here! 
Come on, Ump. 
Leave him in! 
Yeah! Don't throw him out! 
Hey! What are you kids 
doin' up there? 
Uhoh! 
You better have tickets for that tree! 
Game's over for us, JP. 
We gotta go! 
That's right, clear off! 
Go on. Get outta here! 
You heard me! Don't let me catch 
you twerps around here again! 
You kickin' me out? That's good! 
Yes, I'm kicking you out! 
'Cause you been stinkin' up 
the calls all day! You're gone! 
You can't kick me out, 'cause I'm 
leavin'. You get that? I'm outta here! 
And Knox will watch 
the rest of the game in the locker room. 

Murphy's out of his mind 
to put up with this nonsense. 
You thinkyou can do any better? 
Blindfolded. 
Well, when you were managing, boy, 
you had a lot of trouble. I remember__ 

Zip it, pal. 
You have to ask yourself what is 
going on with this team and how long... 
will owner Hank Murphy put up with 
this kind of behaviour from his manager. 
I thought I'd seen it all, 
ladies and gentlemen, but with... 
George Knox calling the shots, 
you never know what will happen. 

Careful, JP. Let's go. 

Why do you idiots 
do that after we've lost? 
It's for good luck, man. 
After fifteen straight losses, 
I say we find somethin' else to rub. 
Like Triscuit's head. 
Hey, don't even think about... 
touchin' me anywhere. 
Fatty pants. 
You know, maybe we 
should do this before we lose. 

Aw, not again! They got 
the wrong kind of salami! 
Can't hit home runs 
if Knox doesn't let you play. 
Hey, I can hit it. You gotta__ 
You gotta choke up and bear down. 
Then you'll get your own home run. 
Hey, how's the arm? 
It's feelin' strong. 
You'll be pitchin' nohitters 
any day now. 
♪ We are the boys of summer 
and it's a big bummer ♪ 
♪ No matter who we play, 
we give the game away ♪ 
♪ 'Cause we can't win, 
That would be a sin ♪ 
♪ We even lose the games before ♪ 
Save it, Mapel! 
♪ they begin ♫ 

Oh, no! 
Bummer. 
One more loss! 
One more loss which 
could have been a win! 
You call yourselves professionals! 
I have never, ever seen 
a worse group of 25 players! 
You don't think as a team, 
you don't play as a team... 
you don't even lose as a team! 
You all got your heads 
so far up your butts... 
you can't even see 
the light of day! 
One more loss and I'll__ 
and I'll do this...Aah! 
to each and every one of you! 
Hohoho! 
I want you here, 
in uniform, at 9:00 tomorrow! 
We're going back to work 
on fundamentals! 
Fundamentals? In the middle of the season? 
I thought the game started at 1:00. 
It does started 1:00! 
And you a jackass! 
No, I'm a pitcher. 

You can be a pitcher and a jackass. 
Si.. Is very common. 
Ahh. 

Tough loss, George. 
I can't take it anymore. 
You have to start trade them. 
All of them, now! 
I can't trade 25 players. 
No, no, no! I can't win with 
these guys. And nobody can. 
There's a thing called talent. 
They don't have it. 
This isn't Cincinnati, George. 
No one expects you 
to win big with these boys. 
I came here to manage 
a winning baseball team. 
You just hang on, partner. 
You'll ride through the dark days. 
Mr. Knox, we're waiting on the field! 
We're waiting! 
What's that? 
David Montagne, administrative 
assistant for media relations. 
You're scheduled to do Ranch 
Wilder's postgame show here... 
And he's been waiting. 
Oh, the press are all scum. 
They're meant to be kept waiting. 
And Ranch Wilder's worse than scum. 
Whose fault is that? 
That is not my fault. 
What ever happened to Barney or 
Bailey, or whatever? 
You fired him, and they 
hired me on Monday. 
Then I can't officially 
fire you until Friday. 
Make a note. 
Oh, what a waste. 
Uh, where, where, where? 
Right here. 
All right, all right. 

Microphone? 
Thrown out of the game. 
I imagine the commissioner's 
fine will be hefty. 
Oh, god. 
We're on in 3, 2, 1. 
And we're back with 
Angels manager George Knox. 
This was a tough loss today. 
Any loss is hard. 
But this one really got to you. 
You leave Cincinnati after 
ten years of winning ball clubs. 
although the really big one always 
seemed to be just out of reach__ 
and you come out here 
to manage our Angels. 
Now, expectations were high that 
you could turn this team around... 
but that just doesn't 
seem to be happening. 
Season's only half over, Ranch. 
And your club's in last place. 
You oughta know how one incident 
can change the course of events. 
Well, you know, you play 
the game, you take your chances. 
Sometimes you're just in the 
wrong place at the wrong time. 
Yeah, you're an expert at that. 
I could say the same about you. 
Well, actions speak louder than words. 

Well, that'll wrap things up 
here 
Hey, I'm still on the air here. 
Oh, yeah? 
Aah! 
We're speaking with Angels manager 
George Knox. George? 
And, uh, we'll be right back. 
Oh, Roger, 
you haven't eaten a thing. 
I'm not hungry. 
Miguel, you have to miss 
the baseball game tomorrow. 
I'm sorry. Your social worker called, 
and you have an interview. 
She'll be here at 11:00. 
Good. I don't want to go to 
the game anyway. Angels never win. 

I wanna go to the game. 
They could win. It could happen. 
Yeah, and you could drop dead 
after dinner with food poisoning. 
Leave him alone! 
Boys! 
Hey, look what we've got 
for dessert. JellO. 
Yea! 
It's not really JellO. 
It's cat brains 
with food colouring. 
She kills 'em at night 
and feeds 'em to us to save money. 
Shut up, Miguel. 
Roger! 
You know we do not use 
those words in this house. 
Meow! 
And you know I would never use 
food colouring on my cat brains. 
Okay, did we wash 
our faces? Yeah? 
Brush our teeth? 
Been to the bathroom? 
Did you pick the lint from 
between your toes? Yeah? 
Did you say your prayers? 
Yeah. 
Oh, yeah? Night. 
Night, Maggie. 
Good night, Maggie. 
I didn't say my prayers. 
I didn't wash my face. 
What's lint again? 
Shut up, butthead! 
Why do we gotta sleep in these 
sleeping bags? I haven't 
peed the bed in a long time. 
You peed 
the bed last week. 
And she makes us sleep in these 
sleeping bags... 
'cause she too old to bend 
over and tuck in sheets. 
She isn't too old. 
She's got a lot to do. 
Did you guys pray? 
I pray every night you go to bed 
without buggin' us... 
with a thousand stupid questions. 
Maybe tomorrow you'll meet 
a nice family, Miguel. 
I'll pray for that. 
It could happen. 
God__ 
if there is a God__ 
if you're a man or a woman, 
if you're listenin'... 
I'd really, really like... 
a family. 
My dad says that'll only happen 
if the Angels win the pennant. 
The baseball team, I mean. 
So, maybe you could 
help 'em win a little. 
Amen. 
Uh, "awomen" too. 

Come in. 
You wanted to see me? 
You feelin' any better today, George? 
Why would I be feelin' better? 
Commissioner fined you $5,000 
for jumpin' Gates. 
And word has it Ranch is pressin' 
civil charges for you poppin' him. 
Come to think of it, I have 
felt better since I slugged Wilder. 
Your pistol's smokin', pal. 
I hadn't made the connection. 
Look, I know you and Wilder 
have been at each other's throats... 
since you were players. 
Yeah, we've been at each other's 
throats since he spiked my knee 
and ruined my career. 
Accidents happen, George. 
It wasn't an accident. 
When you slide into a catcher 
with your nails up, it's on purpose. 
I was comin' into my best years. 
Now, don't go makin' more 
cowpies to step in, George. 
You got enough manure 
on your boots now. 
Control yourself today. 


Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder 
that every Wednesday is kids day. 
Whoa! I see better seats! 
Youngsters age 12 and under... 
Much better seats! 
Come on, J. P., come on. 
Come on! 
All right! 
Thank you. 
Great seats. JP: Yeah. 
This is much better than the tree. 
I'll say. 
Hey, Skip. 
Trainer says I'm ready to pitch. 
When am I gettin' 
off the injured list? 
How's never sound? 
You're here 'cause 
you got a contract... 
that pays you to be here. 
You blew your arm out. 
Played on too many pain pills. 
Pain pills? 
You were the one 
stuffin' 'em down... 
my throat five 
years ago in Cincinnati. 
Hey, it was your decision 
to swallow 'em. I had a brain. 
When you were finished, 
I traded you. 
I never thought I'd get 
stuck with you again. 
Why, you rotten__ 

That's not contagious, is it? 

Outta my way. 
I got a ball club to manage. 

And the rockets' red glare 
The bombs bursting in air 
Gave proof through the night 
That our flag was still there 
Oh, say does that starspangled 
banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free 
And the home of the brave 

I guess no matter how many times 
you hear that song played... 
in a major league stadium 
on a warm afternoon... 
it's still emotionally evocative. 
Drop dead. 
I got sunscreen in my eye. 
Will I win, will I win, 
will I win, win, win? 
Aw! 
Yeah! 
Jose, can you see 
Wait a second. The first word 
is "Jose"? I thought it was__ 
It's Jose. We know. 
Wow! It's about a Spanish guy! 
Jose, can you see 
I don't believe him, eh. 
It's so easy. 
Whit Bass takes the mound 
with his trademark slide. 
His oddball antics are by now 
well known to the fans. 
That's right, Ranch. This season 
alone we've seen him lick dirt... 
eat bugs and floss his 
catcher's teeth in the dugout. 


None of that, may I add, 
seems to have helped his pitching. 
He's two and eleven. 
Leading off forthe BlueJays, 
number 22... 
third baseman Orrin Farley. 
And after hardly any 
warmup, Bass signals he's ready. 
Come on, Whit Bass! 
Just throw strikes! 
Hmm? 
Hmph. Hmph. 

Huh? 
Aah! 
First pitch of the game. 
And the Angels have an 
error and a man on base. 
So the fifth inning goes into the books 
with the score nothing to nothing. 
The Angels thus far have been able to 
keep the hardhitting Blue Jays silent. 
But as we head into the sixth, 
The Jays have the middle 
of the order coming up... 
with the everdangerous 
Asher Lazzato leading off. 
Number 31, left fielder 
Asher Lazzato. 

Bass sets... 
and sets and sets again. 
Please, just throw the ball. 
Here's the pitch. 
And Lazzato smashes 
one to deep center! 
I don't think Williams 
will get to this one! 
Oh! 
Oh, wow! 
Aah! 
And Ben Williams 
makes a miraculous catch! 
Holy cow! 
How did he do that? 
Yeah, holy cow! 
How did he do that? 
How did he do that?! 
That, sports fans, is a play 
you're going to see run... 
in baseball highlights 
for years to come. 
Get me something here! 
Come on, come on! 
We got it. 
What are we waiting for? 
Get me something! 
I'm hangin', I'm hangin'! 
This is dead airtime! 
Did you see that? 
Yeah, awesome. 
They were just sucked 
down right from the sky. 
Who? 
Those guys. 
Those guys in 
sparkling pajamas. 
What are you talking about, Roger? 
What guys in sparkling pajamas? 
You didn't see 'em? 
Those guys carrying Williams? 
I don't know. 
Hey, mister, did you see that? 
Lucky catch. 
No, did you see what 
happened with the clouds? 
Did you see the people with 
Williams when he caught the ball? 
Huh? 
There were shiny people out there. 
Flying, shiny people. 

Yeah, well, tell 
your parents about it. 
But the__ 
Number 58, 
the Irvinator... 
Irving Nator. 

You didn't see 'em? 
It was a real good play, Roger. 
I saw that. 
Yes! Yes! 
Amazing play. I love it when 
they come from above like that. 
From__ From above? 
The sky deal. It's a 
good entrance for 'em. 
You mean you saw 'em? 
The angels? 
Angels? 
'Course I saw 'em. 
They're with me. 
The little one's a rookie. 
He just got off his training wings. 
You mean thothose are real angels? 
Accept no substitutes. 
Who are you? 
Just call me Al. No one 
can see me or hear me but you. 
WWhy me? 
You asked for help, and we're here. 
We come and go. 
It's an "asneeded" situation. 
Who you talkin' to, Rog? 
What are you talkin' about? 
Tubby's back. 
I'm vapour. Keep your nose 
clean and your heart open. 
You got angels around, sonny. 
We'll be in touch. 
Oh! 
Al! What__ 


Who's Al? 
He's the__ 
What's your problem? 
Are you sick or something? 
Yeah, maybe. 
With two outs, this is 
the Angels' last chance... 
to put away the Jays 
before extra innings. 
Next up is Messmer who unfortunately 
has been hitless in his last 26 at bats. 
Number 14, 
catcher Triscuit Messmer. 
Here we go again. 
Oh, wow! 
Oh, my gosh! 
Oh, my gosh! Oh no! 
And that one, ladies and gents, 
is headin' downtown... 
and Messmer breaks a bat 
and the Angels' losing streak... 
as he crashes a home run 
in the ninth__ 
To win the game. 

Aah! Aah! 
Ha! 
Yeah! 
Yeah! Yeah! All right, guys! 
Oh, yeah! Yeah! 
We won? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
How did that happen? 
Yeah! Ha! Ha. 
But you didn't see 
the angel with him? 
We won. 
No, but__ but there were angels 
in the outfield and in the infield. 
Yeah, nine of'em. 

Ladies and gentlemen, 
ourfinal drawing this afternoon... 
will give three lucky winners a chance 
to be photographed on the field... 
with manager George Knox. 
That's a prize? Mmmmmmm. 
The first winning ticket 
is number 477380. 
I won. 
What? 
You do it. 
I don't wanna have my picture taken. 
I don't like strangers. 
Jeez! What's goin' on around here? 

Don't forget, 
the next series 
versus the Oakland A 's... 
opening Friday here... 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
Who's he? 
I can see you kids don't know 
your baseball. That's Mel Clark. 
Mel Clark? Whoa! 
He pitched three shutouts 
in a row for Cincinnati in 1986. 
Well, that's right. 
My dad used to talk about him. 
You used to be Mel Clark? 
Yeah, I used to be. 
Come on, son. Let's go. 
That's it. That's all, folks. 
Okay, we have three 
photo ops. It'll be quick. 
Give 'em publicity stills. 
It'll be quicker. 
They want a picture with you. 
They're all kids. 
II hate kids. 
Yeah, I guessed that. 

First kid! 
JP, wait! Well__ He__ 
Looks like a prison photo. 
Uh, would either of you mind smiling? 
The team did just win. 
It was a mistake. 
This team can't win. 
They won. Cause there 
were angels out there. 
Huh? 
Real ones. I saw 'em. 
Two angels came out of the sky 
and they picked up Ben Williams. 
And another angel hit Messmer's 
home run. That's why the bat broke. 
Great, a psycho kid. David, 
you'd think they'd screen these people. 
It's true! Ask Williams 
about it. Or Messmer. 
They'll tell you something's 
goin' on. You'll see. 

Honey, why aren't you asleep? 
I gotta ask you somethin'. 
Do you believe in angels? 
What do angels gotta do 
with you bein' out of your bed? 
No, I really wanna know. 
Do you think they're real? 

Well, there are a lot of amazing things 
in life that just can't be explained. 
Uh__ 
I believe in, uh... 
the possibility of miraculous 
things happening. 
That's what makes every day 
of our lives worth getting up for. 
So, um__ 
Yeah. 
I guess I do believe in angels. 
Yeah? 
Me too. 
Good night, Maggie. 
Night. 

Nice catch yesterday, Ben. 
How did it feel? Or did it all happen 
so fast you don't even remember? 
I felt weightless, like 
somebody had me by the arms, Skip. 
How'd I do that? 
It wasn't like 
a regular homer. you know? 
It felt like someone was swingin' 
with me. Very strange. 
I could feel some added power 
comin' from somewhere. 
It must've been those chilli dogs 
I ate before the game. 
You know, that third one 
tasted kinda funny. 
Chilli dogs. 

I'm looking for Roger Bowman. 
Does he live here? 
Yeah. 
I'm George Knox from 
the California Angels. 
Roger won a photograph 
at last Friday's game. 
Oh! 
Uh 
I'd really like to 
give it to him myself. 
Uh, you're Roger's mom? 
Nope. 
Aunt? Grandma? 
No, no. 
We're not related. 
This is a shortterm 
foster care facility. I run it. 
Roger is a ward of the state. 
Oh. 
Uh, sso Roger, he__ 
he's got a wild imagination? 
Always making up stories? 
No, actually. 
He's very grounded. 
Fact is, most kids who are 
taken away from their parents 
by the court system. 
Have a good handle on reality. 
I bet. 
Mel Clark strikes him out. 
Cincinnati wins. 
What do you want from him? 
Why are you really here? 
Uh, young fans. 
League needs more of em. 
Roger? 
I got your pictures. 
Thanks. 
Yeah. 
I didn't know you were bringing 'em. 
Hmm. 
Looks like a prison photo. 
Yeah. 
Uh, you__ you said you thought 
you saw something at the game. 
Yeah, angels. Real ones. 
Wh__ Why do you think 
there would be... 
real angels at the ball game? 
Maybe 'cause I prayed for 'em? 
Nothing you were doing was helping. 
I just figured it couldn't hurt. 

Does he talk? 
Of course he talks. 
He just doesn't like strangers. 
Uh, me either. 
I don't even like my friends. 
Uh, these angels you thinkyou seen, 
do you suppose they're coming back? 
If they feel like it, I guess. 
Oh, this is crazy. 
I must be losing it. 
What I meant to say is... 
Uh, do you wanna come 
to the game tomorrow? 
I have an open seat 
next to the dugout, and you can... 
get your Aunt Maggie or 
whoever she is to come along. 
I don't go to baseball games. 
Oh! 
But, uh, yeah, you can go, Roger. 
Can J.P. come too? 
Okay. 
After their 
victory over the Jays... 
the Angels open a threegame series 
against the visiting Athletics. 
Winning the last game may 
have given these Angels a boost. 
Sizing up the team, I'd say 
they look a little bouncier today, 
wouldn't you, Wally? 
Absolutely, Ranch. 
As we saw in last game__ 
Keep it minimal, Wally. 
They'll like you better. 

We're 20 minutes 
away from game time, 
and there are already 
more people in the seats... 
than there were for 
the last five games combined. 
Here. Here you go. 
Take that. Just take it, okay? 
Do you want anything else? 
Uh, yeah, peanuts, maybe, 
and nachos, if you could. 
Yeah. 
Aah! 
Sorry. 
My linen suit! 
What do I do? Mustard stains. 
That's hot water. 
Cold water. Uh, club soda. 
Club soda. 
I got soda! 
Ow! 

I'm all wet. 
Get up in front of me. 
Right now! We're gonna dry off. 
Leave your popcorn there. 
Hey, what happened to you? 
Those kids, they're evil. 
The big one might be lucky, 
so keep him happy. 
JP, let's go! 
We gonna win today, kid? 
Maybe. 
Maybe? 
I don't know. 
It's your team. 
Don't remind me. 
Sit down! 

Oh, please, don't drink me. 
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't! 
Aah! 
Got it! 
My, my! 
How'd you get__ How'd you get__ 
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
This is between you and me, 
little guy. No one can see me but you. 
Remember? 
Oh, hi. 
Sit down, already. 
I left in a hurry yesterday. 
I forgot a few of the rules. 
Numero uno: 
don't tell anyone about us. 
Now, I heard you already told 
the little kid and el capit¹n. 
But nobody else. 
We hate recognition. 
We're a very sensitive group. 
If people know we're around, 
I wouldn't be able to get an angel... 
within a mile of this team. 
Okay. Uh, are you guys 
gonna help out today? 
We'll see. 
We never make commitments. 
We go and come and come and go. 
We're a capricious crowd. 
Wh__ What's cap__ 
What's__ What's capricious? 
Just keep your chin up and your 
eyes open and enjoy the game. 
Aah! 

You popped Al! 
Who's Al? 
Al's the boss angel. 
He was just here, but he's gone now. 
Next time will you tell me sooner? 
I'd like to try and see one. 
Mr Knox, over here! 
Over here! Over here, Mr Knox! 
Mr Knox, Mr Knox, over here! 
Mr Knox, come on, 
come on! Mr Knox! 
I just saw an angel! 
You saw an angel? 
Yeah. In my Coke cup. 
In your Coke cup? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
I gotta get back to the dugout. 
What should I do 
if I see another one? 
Kid, I was thinking of you 
as a sort of good luck charm... 
not as someone 
who spiritually hallucinates. 
What's that? 
It means if you see anything 
weird, keep it to yourself. 
But wait! You should know. 
You're the manager, 
and the angels are here to help... 
and if I don't tell you, 
you're not gonna know__ 
Calm down. 
In baseball, we got signals. 
Make some kind of signal. 
Okay? I can't come over here 
every couple of seconds. 
Um, I'll go like that, okay? 
Oh, okay. You do that. 
That's fine. Okay. 
And we__ 
And we can't let David know. 
Yeah, right. Absolutely. 
We can't tell David. 
Can't tell anyone. 
Thank you. 
Here. 
Yeah. 
Thanks. 
Thanks. Oh, and excuse me, David, 
wh__ where are the nachos? 

I'm saving them for later. 

Sorry! 
Sorry! 

Number 17, 
first baseman Tom Brewer. 
Bass takes the sign. 
Here's the pitch. 
And it's lined to left... 
for another base hit. 
Oh, no! 
Shit! Damn! 
So it's more bad news... 
Shit! 
for manager Knox... 
as he does his dance 
in the dugout. 
Mapel waits for the pitch. 
Strike! 
Strike? 
Aw, come on, now! 
That's no strike! 
If that was a strike, ththththen you 
blind as a horse's ass! 

Jesus! Come on. 
Let me have some__ Gimme this. 
Mr Knox. 
I want your hats off. 
Yeah? 
It's nacho butt. 
Go buy the kids nachos. 
Anything but nachos. 
Buy them Angels jackets. 
It's 90 degrees outside. 
Get your butt up there, now! 

You know, uh, 
it's been four innings, 
and no real angels yet. 
And, you know, I was just thinking, 
maybe you shouldn't swear so much. 
I bet the angels don't like it. 
ShShoot! 
Get on, you stupid sons of__ 
I'm kiddin'! 
Man, he is a deadbeat, this one. 
Let's keep the profanity down! 
Huh? 
I mean it! No swearin'! 
That eliminates all speech 
for most of the team. 
So here in the ninth, 
the Athletics have opted 
to bring in reliever... 
Tom Ruddy to pitch 
to Angels heavy hitter 
Ray Mitchell. 
Ohho, wow! 
What happened? 
There's an angel 
right next to Hemmerling. 
Uh, David, II need a drink. 
You have drinks. 
I don't want these. 
I want something else. 
What else? 
Uh, coffee. 
You drink coffee? 
Yeah. Of course. All the time. 
Yeah, all the time. 
What do you think we are, 
little kids or something? 
Now, get me a cup or I'll scream. 
How do you take it? 
In cups. 
Mr Knox! Mr Knox! 
Come over here. We got one! 
Hey. 
What's goin' on? 
There's an angel with Hemmerling. 
What? 
There's an angel massaging 
Hemmerling's shoulders. 

This is ridiculous. I don't know 
what you see, 
but there's no one 
with Hemmerling. 
She's rubbin' 
his shoulders. 
Huh? 
AAAnd what should I do about it? 
Put him in. 
Pinchhit. 
II got Mitchell coming up. 
He's my best hitter. 
Hemmerling can't hit 
the broad side of a barn. 
I can't substitute my worst hitter 
for my best hitter. 
If you want a hit, 
you'll put in Hemmerling. 
It's crazy! Wacko. 
You forget about it. Ah! 
But he's got an angel. 
Wait a minute. What's the worst thing 
that could happen? 
Are we gonna fall 
out of last place? Heh. 
Sit down, Mitchell. 
You're up, Hemmerling. 
Huh? 
What are you talkin' about? 
Yeah, what are you talking about? 
You heard what I said. 
You're out and you're in. 
You gotta be stupid! 
Hey, get your stuff! 
Right. 

Damn! Damn! 
Aah! Aah! 
As Mitchell was getting ready 
to lead off, 
Knox has suddenly 
decided to pinchhit. 
And he's bringing in Danny Hemmerling, 
the utility infielder... 
who is known, sports fans, for his 
glove, but definitely not for his bat. 
Hemmerling for Mitchell? 
Go back to Cincinnati! 
Strike! 

Where they go? 
Damn! 
Strike! 
See the pitch? 
Oh, my gosh! 
Holy cow! Are you kidding me? 
What the__ 
For goodness sake 
Oh, wow! 
I got the hippyhippy shakes 
Yeah, I got the shakes 
I got the hippyhippy shakes 
Ah, I can't stand still 
Go, go! Come on! Come on! 
Unh! 
HeyHey, uh__ 
Yeah, I get my fill now 
Aah! 
Whoa! 
Unh! 

Yeah, it's in the back 
Ahha! 
Ooh, the hippyhippy shakes 

Unhh! 
Go, go, go! 
He may score. 
Throw it! Safe! 
He will score! 
Yeah! 
Hemmerling scores 
for the first time this season, 
and the Angels win the game. 
This will go down 
in the record books. 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
this is unbelievable! 
This is insanity! I've never 
seen anything like this. 
And, obviously, neither 
have these umps. 
I don't know. 
Yeah! 
Yeah! All right! Whoohoo! 
Something's going on 
with this kid. 

Ladies and gentlemen, can we now say 
the Angels are on a winning streak? 
Or were these last few games 
just a small blip on the screen 
of a terminally ill patient? 
Only time will tell. 
What is going on? 
Where are my stats? I'm on the air! 
My ass is hanging on the air... 
No, it's not! 
and there are no stats. 
There were how many errors? 
There were a lot of errors, Ranch. 
Not as many as in this booth. 
Let me tell you, this is not baseball. 
This is not baseball. 
Ow! 
Hey, David! 
Whatever your duties were before, 
forget 'em. 
From now on, these boys 
will be at all our games. 
All right! 
That's your job. 
Mr Knox, I want to remind you, you are 
gonna fire me on Friday, aren't you? 
You've bonded with the boys. 
Bonded? 
Hey, you're gonna stick around, David. 
Yeah, stick around, David. 
Hey, you got job security. 
Job security? 

Who knew? 
So, you're right. 
Hemmerling came through. 
Yeah, 'cause of the angel. 
Aw, whatever. 
No, we got angels helping the team. 
Ah, well, that may be, 
but we're winning. 
Yeah. 
All the games, man! 
Can you believe it? 
When we're on the road, 
you should watch the games on TV. 
We'll figure out a way 
for us to talk on the phone. 
You mean, the phone in the dugout 
you're always yelling into... 
andand banging against 
the wall and spitting at? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that phone. 
Cool! 
What a game. First time Hemmerling 
got a hit, let alone a home run. 
It's 'cause of the angels. 
They helped him. 
Get in. 
Come on. 
We don't have all day. 
J.P. doesn't ride in cars. 
What's the problem? He gets carsick? 
Sort of. 
He used to live 
in a car with his mom. 
He slept in the front seat 
all curled up like a cat or something. 
When he gets in a car, 
his stomachache comes back. 


I'll call you tomorrow. 
All right. 
Thank you for the ride home. 
He speaks? 

Hi. You guys have a good time? 
Hi. 
A blast! 
We won! 
Great. 
Where's Miguel? 
I got him all sorts of stuff. 
Miguel got placed in a foster home 
this afternoon. 
He got placed? 
Miguel's gone? 
Mmmhmm. 
Where? With who? 
A real nice family 
from Northridge. 
I'm gonna miss him. 
I really liked Miguel! 
I only have a licence 
for shortterm care. 
You know? MMiguel's been here 
for, what, six months? 
I think seven. 
Seven months. Right. 
That's what happens, you know? 
I mean, you understand that, Roger. 
Oh, don't feel bad, Maggie. 
I bet we see him again. 
Maybe in court or something. 
Oh, Roger. 
God forbid. 
Roger? 
What? 
Are you asleep? 
If I was asleep, 
how'd I be talkin' to you? 
You could be "sleeptalking." 
Look, I'll give you a dime tomorrow 
ifyou don't say another word. 
Okay. 
Roger? 

You can forget that dime. 
Do you think your parents 
are gonna ever come get you? 
I don't know. Mom's not alive, 
but my dad's gonna come get me. 
I'm sure of it. 
You think my mom's 
gonna ever come get me? 
Maybe, you know. 
It could happen. 
Yeah, it could happen. 
Roger? 
What? 
I'm happy you see the angels. 
Me too. 
Good night. 
It's a beautiful day 
here in Anaheim... 
as the resurgent Angels 
prepare to meet their longtime 
nemesis, the Detroit Tigers... 
who have won the first five games 
of their Western road trip. 
They've been the hottest team in the 
league for the last few weeks, Ranch. 
Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder: 
the most popular__ 
...coming up next week 
with Cap Night... 
this year featuring a totally white cap 
with red pinstripes and the Angel logo. 
It's free for the first 50, 000 fans 
entering Anaheim Stadium. 
I see an angel. 
Already? 
I gotta go bathroom. I can't go alone. 
Bad guys might get me. 
We just came back 
from the bathroom. 
Gotta go now. Sorry. 
Gimme your Coke. 
Gimme the Cracker Jacks. 
Stand up. 
Go. 
What's__ What's up? 
We got an angel. 
But the game hasn't started. 
She was with Mel Clark. 
Aah! Impossible. 
She was there. That means Mel 
should start the game today. 
Mel's arm is gone. 
I don't care. He should start the game. 
Uhuh. No way! And besides, 
he's not even on the active roster. 
If the angel pitches with him, 
he'll be awesome. 
You really do see something, 
don't you? 
Yeah, I do. 
Good. All right. 
You're off injured reserve 
and you're starting today. 
You talkin' to me? 
Yeah. 
So get your stuff together. 
Starting pitcher announced 
for this game was Dan Prince... 
but just moments ago, 
the Angels made a dramatic change... 
and activated the 
longinjured Mel Clark. 
League rules specify that up 
until the first pitch is thrown, 
the roster can be altered... 
although I can't ever remember 
this happening so near game time. 
Me neither, Ranch. 
Easy, Wally. Less is more. 
These warmups 
should be interesting. 
Over the plate, Mel! 
Clark looks a little rusty. 
Unh! 
Too much time 
in the whirlpool, Wally. 
I'm checking to see if Dan Prince 
pulled a muscle during his warmup. 
There must be some logical explanation 
as to why George Knox... 
would make such a bizarre change. 
I have personally checked 
the stats, sports fans... 
and Mel Clark hasn't started a game... 
In this decade. 
He looks mighty 
nervous out there. 
Not as nervous 
as George Knox. 
Clark takes the sign. 
Talk about heat! 
Messmer felt that one. 
Ow! 
Oh, my gosh! Holy cow! 
Wow! 
Are you kidding me? 
What an amazing pitch! 
You damn__ darn right. 

Well, commit that 
to memory, Wally... 
'cause he doesn't have 
any more of those in him. 
An angel helped out on that one. 
Good. 
Unh! 
Got it! 
Strike! 
Unh! 
Got it! 
Strike! 

Mel! 
Way to go! 
All right, Mel! 
Unh! 
Unh! Unh! Unh! 
Unh! Unh! Unh! 
Got it! 
It's now the top of the ninth. There 
are two outs. We've got a full count. 
This could be the Tigers' last 
chance to get back... 
in this ball game. 
One more! One more! 
Unh! 
Got it! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
I told you! 
I told you! 
That's the game! The Angels win 
onenothing in a miracle shutout... 
pitched by the veteran Mel Clark. 

All right, Mel! Good game! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
It's unbelievable. 
How in the world did 
old noodlearm pull that off? 
And who gets the credit? 
George Knox. George Knox. 
And we're down in the Angels' clubhouse 
for a talk with manager George Knox. 
What inspired you to start Mel? 
A feeling. 
An instinct. A kind of faith. 
A faith in what? Has Mel shown 
this kind of power in practice? 
Mel Clark has always shown himself 
to be an extraordinary athlete. 
The rest is about believing 
in something or someone. 
And when did you suddenly start 
believing in Clark? 
He's been sitting on 
the bench all season. 
I look for signs. 
It's good to win. 
And sometimes they come 
from unexpected places. 
Look, that's enough out of me for today. 
Talk to the star of the game. 
Excuse me. 
Something's goin' on. 
Mel! You talk to us about the game. 
Yeah! 
Well, it__ it feels great 
to be a winner again. 
We won! 
Yeah. Three in a row. 
Oh, I feel good! 
Yeah. Me too. 
Me three. 
Ah, I owe you guys. 
Okay. Anything you want. 
You name it, you got it. 

All right, let's play ball! 
Yeah! 
I got third! 
Spread out, guys. 


Slow and easy. 
Keep your elbows up. 
Here it comes. 
Great hit, JP! 
Get it, Roger! Get it! Get it! 
Yeah! All right! 
All right, J.P. 
All right! Who's next? 
Me! Me! Me! 
Me! Me! Me! 
Let's give the kid 
over on the car a shot. 
Aww! 
What's your name? 
Marvin Vincent Archer. 
You play any ball before, Marvin? 
No, I never played any ball. 
Well, this is a perfect time to learn. 
Come on. 
Watch the ball... 
Stay sharp, Zack. 
and when I say "now," you swing. 
Just do exactly what I say. 
Get ready to swing. 
Now! Oh, oh! 
Yeah, Marvin! 
Go, Marvin! Run to first base. 
Nice one. Go! 
Nice hit, nice hit. 
You stay on base 
and do just what I say. 
Okay. 
We got runners on first and second. 
And look who's comin' to bat__ 
Babe Ruth. 


Whoa! 
Go, Marvin! Run home! 
Run home? 
Run home! 
Run home. Run home. 
Run home. Run home. 
Hey, Marvin, 
where ya going? 
Run home. Run home. 
Hey. WWhere's he goin'? 
Eh, what happened? 
You told him to run home. 
I__ 
He did. 

Unh! 



Aaaaaah! Unhh! 
Oh, wow! 


You call that a call? 
You call that a call? 
In all my years of baseball, 
I have never seen such a__ 
such an astute evaluation... 
of a potentially 
difficult decision. 
Masterful call. 
Oh, have a nice day. 
Aah! 
Fair ball! 
Yeow! 
Aaaaaaah! 
Oh, wow! 
Safe! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
Whooooo! 
Yeah! 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
Here you go, black man. 
Thanks! 
Thanks, Mel! 
Hey! 

Oh! It's 
Oh, wow! 
Aah! 
Unbelievable! 
Yes! Yes! 
Wow! 
Get out of the way! 
Yes! 
He's got a 
man wide open! 
Yeah! 

He's got a 
man wide open! 
You're outta there! 
Yeah! Hey? 
No? 
Got it! 
Got it! 
My, my! 


Got it! 

Oh, my god! 
I got it! 
The Angels have closed out the 
season with an incredible hot streak. 
Who would have believed they could go 
from last place at the AllStar break... 
to just one win away 
from clinching the division title? 
Now it all comes down 
to the last two games of the season... 
and, ironically, they are with the 
defending champion Chicago White Sox... 
who are one game back 
and closing fast... 
in a determined effort 
to deny the Angels the championship. 
The first ofthose crucial games 
takes place right here... 
this afternoon. 
What's it say? 
Thanks. Bye. 
Van's gonna 
pick us up at 12:00. 
Rog__ Stupid thing. Roger. 

Huh? 
That was your social worker. 
What does she want? 
Your hearing's 
been changed to this afternoon. 
But I got a game this afternoon. 
I know. 
I've just tried everything to get 'em 
to reschedule. It's just not possible. 
Maggie, I'm not going. 
You don't have a choice, 
sweetheart. 
Well, what about George? 
What about the Ang 
I'll call Mr Knox. 
I know he thinks you guys 
are his lucky charms... 
but this is just something 
you have to do. 
JP can go to the game, 
and we'll just try real hard... 
to get you there before it's over. 
It's all I can do. 
Aw, man! 
And what about the game? 
Attention, 
youngsters age 6 to 16... 
be sure to join the 
Junior Angel Fan Club. 
For just five dollars, 
you'll receive game tickets... 
baseball cards, a free autograph__ 
The Southern California 
sun is shining, the field is ready... 
the hot dogs are warm, and there's 
not an empty seat in the house. 
I know. I know. 
Don't even say it. A large Coke, 
two dogs, three Cracker Jacks. 
And I was thinking of getting him a car. 
And maybe a corporate jet. 
And maybe a__ 
SStill no Roger. 
He'll be here any second. 
Of all the days to haul 
the kid off to court. 
Why didn't Maggie say 
he was sick or somethin'? 
That'd be lying. 
Maggie would never lie. 
Well, Maggie's not 
in a pennant race. 
Number 19, 
third baseman Bruce Shea. 
Hey, you don't see anything, do you? 
Maybe. 
Huh? 
Sorry. 
Well, it's not your fault. 
You never seen angels before. 
Why should you now? 
Hey, it could happen. 

You understand that once 
this hearing has established... 
Roger's permanent 
placement status... 
his welfare will forever forward 
be determined by this court. 
I understand. 
And you've consulted a lawyer? 
Look, lady, I get what I'm doin'. 
The kid's not mine any more. 
I'm not proud of it. 
It's not something I could 
change my mind about either. 
We're ready to see you now, Roger. 
Dad? 
Dad, I didn't know 
you were gonna be here! 
You know the Angels are 
only one game from the pennant? 
Can you believe it? 
It's just like you said! 
Sorry, boy. 
Dad? 
Hey, Dad, wh__ 
Did you hear what I said? 
Where ya goin'? 
Daddy? 
Don't cry. 
Come back. 


But, we lost! 
Don't cry. IIt's only a game. 
Come on. You're getting snot all over 
the place. It's nobody's fault. 
I tried to see angels. 
I really tried. 
I guess without angels helping, 
this team doesn't have what it takes. 
Maybe I just don't 
have what it takes. 
If we could still win 
without the angels. It could happen. 
Maybe. Eh, gimme a minute, kid, 
and I'll be out to take you home. 
But, don't cry. 
No, we're not. 
Hey, put out that cigarette. 
Hey. 
I'm Ranch Wilder the 
voice of the Angels. 
I know who you are. 
I heard you on the radio. 
You sure do 
have a big chin. 
Everybody's a critic. 
Well, what's your name? 
JP. 
Well, J.P., that was 
a tough loss today, huh? 
Knox took it pretty hard. 
He was gettin' kinda crazy out there. 
'Cause Roger couldn't come. 
I get it. So Roger's sort of lucky. 
Is that it? 
He sees the angels, the ones 
who help out. He prayed for 'em. 
Real angels? 
Yeah, but I don't see 'em. 
And Knox__ he sees 'em? 
No! 
Roger has to tell him 
when they're around. 
Really? 
You know, 
by releasing you legally... 
it does make it possible for somebody 
to take you permanently. 
He did that 'cause he wants 
the best for you. 
Yeah. Givin' someone away is 
a great way to show 'em you care. 
Hey, Roger! 
Took a little longer than you expected. 
We waited three hours for his hearing. 
That's quick for family court. 
What'd they decide? 
Oh, it's just a formality. 

He belongs to the state 
of California now. 
Scoot over. 
Roger, I'm sorry about today. 
Why? 'Cause you lost 
your stupid baseball game? 
No. Because you're hurt. 
You don't 
know anything about it. 
You know, Roger, when I was growin' up, 
I never saw very much of my dad. 
He couldn't 
take care of himself... 
so takin' care of me and my brothers 
was outta the question. 
I'm not sure the pain 
that caused ever goes away. 
But I am sure you can't 
go through life... 
thinkin' everyone you meet 
will one day let you down. 
Because if you do, 
a very bad thing will happen. 
You'll end up like me. 
I'm goin' inside. 
I thought you said you 
had to be somewhere. 
I do. Right here. 
Yuck! 
You both wash your hands? 
Yep. 
Okay, then, let's dig in. 
Next time I'll try lasagna. 
You guys like lasagna? 
No. What is it? 
Look. It's God's thumbnail. 
That's just the moon, JP. 
No God up there. 

I can't believe you said that. 
The kid who sees angels. 
I don't believe 
in angels any more. 
Roger, what are 
you talking about? 
That's okay, JP. 
Roger's had a tough day. 

"The source says there's 
a boy known as Roger__ 
Even watches games on TV 
when the team is out of town... 
and reports to manager Knox 
over the phone." 
What's a source? 
The person who told. 
Oh. 
"And when Mel Clark made his 
amazing comeback in August... 
it was Roger's__ 
it was Roger's idea to start him." 
That's me. 
Who do you think told? 
I don't know. Maybe David found out. 
I don't see how. 
Are we in trouble? 
Knox is in trouble, that's for sure. 
This is bad, right? 
I'm gonna have to tell Maggie. 

Right this 
way, Mr Knox. 
You stood me up last night. 
What in the Sam Hill is 
all this about real angels? 
It's nothing. 
Start talkin'. 
Okay. I__ I got these two kids. 
And II think of them as mascots. 
And the angels__ Uh, well__ 
It's just something that's 
going on between me and them. 
You're tellin' me there's 
real angels in the ball park? 
Sometimes. 
But they're not in on all the plays. 

You've lost it, partner. 
Look, if I lied to you... 
then the angels wouldn't like it, 
and they might not come back. 
They're very temperamental. 
Mental is the key word here. 
I'm sorry, George, but I'm relieving you 
ofyour management responsibilities. 
You can't do that. 
We're only one game away. 
I tell you what. I'll give you 24 hours 
to get your head on straight. 
Then I'll call a press conference. 
And you can publicly 
renounce this hogwash. 
George, you repeat any of 
the baloney I've heard here... 
we're talkin' the end of 
your career in baseball. 
Have I made myself clear? 
Yes. 
What's goin' on, Knox? 
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
We're gonna make this short and sweet. 
My manager, George Knox here, 
has something he'd like to say to ya. 
George. 
I have a statement I'd like to read. 
There have been reports... 
that I've been using angels 
to help the team win. 
Go on. Go in. 

I was gonna read a statement... 
but instead, 
I'm gonna shoot from the hip. 
You know, there are 
a lot of times in sports... 
when there's no logical explanation 
why things happen. 
Sometimes a 
player gets hot and... 
goes beyond their physical ability. 
Is it just adrenaline? 
I don't know. 
But I do believe 
there are times in life... 
where something stronger, higher... 
or maybe spiritual is with us. 
I can't explain it, but something has 
happened to my players this year... 
something that's changed 
the way they play... 
and the way I manage. 
You can call it faith. 
You can call it angels. 
You can call it whateveryou want. 
That's all I have to say. 
George, does this mean 
you really think... 
that a kid sees angels 
at your games? 

Excuse me. 
I'd, uh__ I'd like to say something 
on behalf of George Knox. 
Uh, what's your name? 
What's your business here? 
My name is Maggie Nelson. 
I take care of foster kids. 
One of these boys is, uh, 
the child who can see angels. 
He could stand up right now 
and tell you exactly what's happened... 
and I know you'd just laugh at him. 
But, when a professional football player 
drops to one knee to thank God... 
after making a touchdown, 
nobody laughs at that. 
Or when a pitcher crosses himself 
before going to the mound? 
Nobody laughs at that either. 
Seems like you're saying 
it's okay to believe in God... 
but it's not okay 
to believe in angels. 
Uh, I thought they were 
on the same team. 
Is it your belief, ma'am, 
that, uh, angels play baseball? 
Since the AllStar break, yes. 

We all need somebody 
to watch out for us. 
Every kid I have 
ever taken care of... 
has been looking for 
someone to love__ an angel. 
You gotta have faith. 
You gotta believe. 
You gotta look inside yourself. 
The footprints 
of an angel are love. 
And where there is love, 
miraculous things can happen. 
I've seen it. 
I'd also like 
to say something. 
I don't know if there 
are angels out there... 
other than the 25 of us 
in uniform... 
but I know there is 
one thing I won't do. 
I won't play for anyone 
but George Knox. I believe in him. 
That goes for me too. 

Thank you. All of you. 
Print what you want. George Knox 
is the manager of the ball club. 

And if there are any angels out there... 
sure hope they're on our side. 

Oh, yeah! 
Yeah! Yes! 
Good evening, everyone, 
and welcome to downtown Anaheim... 
where there are no seats 
left in sports heaven... 
as a sellout crowd fills the ball park 
for the final game of the season. 
Tonight, George Knox will send 
his Angels, real or imagined... 
out against 
a tough White Sox team... 
to determine who will be 
the Western Division champion. 
When I came here this season, 
I didn't believe in you guys. 
I didn't believe in anything. 
But when you stood up this morning... 
you gave me back 
my reason to believe. 
I'm more proud of bein' a part of 
this team than any team I've been on. 
You're all winners, 
and I believe in you! 
So let's go out there 
and show them what winners can do! 
Let's take that championship! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
All right! You're so fantastic! 
Okay, you heard him. Let's go! 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
your California Angels. 

Starting pitcher 
for this crucial game... 
is the veteran Mel Clark. 
Yeah! 
All right! 
He's been their hottest pitcher since 
he returned to the lineup in July. 
So, Clark's have a rocky 
start here in the first. 
He's got runner's a second and third 
with two outs, 
And Darren at bat. 
Darren tries the ball to left. 
It's fair! 
One run will score, and 
here comes Cooper. 
Norton get's to it. 
It's gonna be close. 
Here come the ball... 
Copper slides, he's safe! 
No! 
The fans don't like the call. 
But the Sox go up 2 to nothing, 
And we're still in the top in the verse. 
You got 'em, Mel! 

Clark pitches to Young. 
He loops one over second base 
and here comes Garcia! 
Oh, wow! 
Whoa! Garcia makes a... 
spectacular save 
to end the inning! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
With the Angels 
behind 2 to nothing... 
Clark's really struggling with 
one out in the top of the fifth... 
And a man on first and second 
Beasley comes to bat. 
Anybody got any uhNo? 
No question he's tiring, Wally. 
And Knox knows it. Ball one. 
That expected this there 
getting Teller up now... 
In the ballpen. 
Whoa! Mitchell makes a great 
play makes the force at third. 
All right, all right, all right 
all right, all right. 
All right. 
Here in the sixth... 
Garcia's on first with the 
single as the Angels trying... 
To battle away back 
into the ball game. 
That brings up Ray Mitchell. 
Ray's been hot as wild far 
this second half of this... 
miraculous season. 
But as many you've known... 
In the past, Mitchell is choked. 
When it came from 
real pressure situation. 
You got the one, Ray? 
You hear me? 
You can do it! 
Mitchell connects... 
It's hit deep... 
Go, go, go, go, go! 
And It's gone! 
Got it! 
Oh, my god!! I got it! 
Ray Mitchell has just hit... 
a monster home run with the man on 
to tie the game here in the sixth. 
Oh, my gosh! Holy cow. 
Are you kidding me? 

Clark has it's back to 
the wall here in the seventh... 
As the Sox was threading again 
with two man on base. 
Okay. Holding on, holding on. 
Holding on. Huh! 
Hang it in there. 
Clark definitely could use an angel now, 
as he's tiring... 
late in the game. 
Intercepted! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
There seems to be some sort 
of magic in the way his team 
is supporting him, Ranch. 
Hey, kid. How you doin'? 
Fine. Al! 
Hey, kiddo, sharp outfit. 
I wish I had one. 
Thanks. Gee, I am 
glad to see you. 
You know, I was afraid you guys 
wouldn't show up today since... 
you know, a lot of people 
know about the angels now. 
No one's coming. Championships have 
to be won on their own. It's a rule. 
Oh. Well, then, 
what are you doing here? 
I came here to check on Mel. 
He's comin' up soon. 
He's gonna be one of us. 
YYou mean he's__ 
Ah, he smoked for years. 
It's always a mistake. 
He's got six months left. 
He doesn't know anything's wrong yet. 
No. 
Don't you worry. 
He's well taken care of. 
You concentrate on your own life now. 
We expect great things from you, kid. 
We'll all be watching. 
Remember that. Even though you can't 
see us, we're always watching. 

With the man on and 
one out in the eighth. 
Clark is showing definite 
science of photic. 
As he pitches to Marge. 
Ball three. 
Take your time, Clark. 
We're ready to go, guys! 
Here's the pitch. 
And Marge grounds to Martinez 
they get Darren in second. 
Garcia throws, Double play! 
Yes! 
Yeah! 
And once again sulled defense... 
barrels Clark out of the jam! 
It's still tied up here 
in the bottom of the eighth. 
but the Angels have Garcia at bat 
and Martinez on third... 
with the go ahead run. 
Martinez goes on the pitch! 
Garcia bunts! 
There's a screen's play. 
Here's the throw. 
Oh, wow! 
Martinez scores! 
And the Angels take the lead! 
Yeah! 
Unh! 
Messmer pops out to 
Gaboyan to end the inning. 
So as were in the ninth 
the Angels are only three outs 
away from the pennant... 
if they can just hold on 
to this 3 to 2 lead. 
Hey, Mel. 
Let's finish this. 
We got 'em. 
All right. All right, 
three outs, boys. 
Let's do it! 
So the championship 
on the line... 
manager George Knox elects 
to send a tired Mel Clark... 
out to face the heart of 
the White Sox's lineup. 
He's all alone. 
Let's go. 
Come on, Angels. 
Don't worry. He'll get an angel. 
Mel always gets an angel. 
Clark takes the sign 
for his first pitch to Gasper. 
Let's see if he has 
anything left. 
Gasper gets a piece of it. 
And it balls in 
for the single. 
The tying run is 
now on first. 
They're getting Sanford 
up in the bullpen. 

Bee, bunt! 
Clark feels it cleanly 
and gets the runner at first. 
But Gasper advances at second 
on the sarifice. 
One down. 
The White Sox now have 
the tying run and scoring... 
position with Darren at bat. 
It's in the hole. 
Garcia dives. 
He gets it! 
Yes! 
The grow is offbalance. 
Safe! 
Not in time! 
Are you sure? 
But the go 
ahead run is now on first. 
With only one away. 
Clark looks very tired. 
Gaboyan swings and smashes it 
deep left center! 
This is trouble! Williams 
got a good jump on the ball! 
Somebody better take charge! 
Oh, wow! 
And Ben Williams saves the game 
for now with a spectacular catch. 
Had a great throw, 
to hold the runner at third. 
Aah! 
Oh! 
And he hits Birch 
in the back on the first pitch. 
That loads the bases. 
and Kesey, the lead guard 
beyond leader is up next. 
Number 32, 
Kit "Hit or Die" Kesey. 


I can't believe 
he's leaving Clark in the game. 
Any hit scores a run. 
There's an angel there now, right? 
No. 
And the runners take their leads. 
And Kesey got a good piece 
of that one, but it's foul. 
We've got one strike. 
Sanford is ready 
in the bullpen. 
Ball one! 
His arm has to be tired. 
He's thrown 156 pitches. 
Ball two! 
There's one comin', right, Roger? 
I don't know, JP. 
I__ I don't think so. 
And Clark just misses nicking Kesey, 
and the count goes to 3 and 1. 
He's way behind 
the batter now. 

Any angels? 
No. 
And Kesey jumps on it! 
This could be the game! 
No! 
It's deep! It's down the line! 
If it stays fair, it's outta here! 
Foul! Foul! Foul! 
It's gonna be close. 
But it's foul. 
Yeah, my god! 
So it comes down to a full count. 
Two outs, the top of the ninth. 
The Angels lead by one run, 
and for Mel Clark... 
this is 
the pressure cooker! 
I gotta take him out. 
No. Please, 
just let him try. 
He's all used up. 
He can't do it by himself. 
Yes, he can. 
All he has to do 
is believe. 

And Knox 
will pull Mel Clark. 
All I can say is, 
it's about time. 
I got nothing left. 
Yeah, you do. 
You got one strike left. 

You got an angel with you right now. 
Just got here, and he's gonna help. 

Kid sees an angel? 
Yeah, he must. That's the signal. 

Could happen. 
Okay. 

Go get him 
for the championship. 
All right! 
All right! Come on, Mel! 
I'm so happy! 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
I don't believe it... 
Knox will let Clark stay in 
to pitch to Kesey. 
This is not smart baseball. 
This is ridiculous. 
Let's go, my brother. 
Come on. 

Yes! 
Oh, my gosh! 
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no! 
Aaaaah! 
He's got it, and it's over! 
He's got it! 
I can't believe it! 
The Angels win the pennant! 
We won! 
All right, JP! We won, we won! 
Yea! Yeah! 
Oh, my god! 
Aaaah! Hoohoo! 
I got it! 
There are angels! 
Not this time, Mel. 
You did it yourself. 
Haha! Aaaah! 
We won! We won! 

Whoo! 
Aaaah! 


Yeah! Yeah! 
All right! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
Yes! 
I can't believe it! 
Ranch. 

You're fired. 
You can't fire me! 
I got a contract! 
I'm Ranch Wilder! 
Easy, Ranch. Less is more. 
And the Angels have won it! 

Maggie! Maggie! We won! 
Maggie! 
We won! We won! 
I know. I heard. Oh, congratulations. 
The Angels won the pennant. 
It's great. 
Well done. 
Oh, Roger, 
your social worker called. 
She did? 
What'd they want? 
Was it about my father? 
No. But it is about 
finding you a permanent home. 

Oh, JP. Come back. 
JP! Come back. 

You know, nothin' is probably 
ever as good as your real parents. 
But there's some people 
who could care foryou... 
and love you and 
take care of you. 
Yeah. 
I guess so. 
Yeah. 
Roger, the person who 
called Social Service__ 
that was me. 
I wanna try to be a dad. 
I want you to come 
and live at my house. 
You want__ You want__ 
Ahh. 

Okay, honey? 
No way. II can't. I__ 
You know, II can't leave JP. 
II could never leave JP. 
He's comin' too. 
He is? 
I heard that. 


Yeah! 
Aww! 
Wait. What about Maggie? 
No. My work is here. 
Don't worry. There are plenty 
of little angels looking for a home. 
So__ So__ 
So we're gonna be a family. 
Yeah. 
I'm gonna have a daddy. 


I knew it could happen. 


We're always watching.
