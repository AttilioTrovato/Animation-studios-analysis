{6484}{6536}Cracking job, Gromit.
{6538}{6579}Hang on, old chum.
{6595}{6639} What's going on?| Who is it?
{6641}{6676}Reel him in, lad.
{6678}{6736}To me. To me.
{6759}{6822}Gotcha! Thieving monster.
{6983}{7041}Me prize pumpkin.
{7043}{7140}Me little baby. Me pride and joy.
{7142}{7207}You've saved it, AntiPesto.
{7208}{7249}It was nothing at all, Mrs...
{7281}{7348} Everything's under control.| Oh, no!
{7350}{7391}Don't worry, madam.
{7474}{7533}Thank you, Mr. Wallace.
{7535}{7584}All in a night's work, Mrs. Mulch.
{7635}{7684}Cute little feller, isn't he?
{7686}{7755}You'd never believe|they'd cause so much damage.
{7756}{7800}Oh, he may look innocent, sir.
{7802}{7855}But left to his own devices,
{7856}{7941}this is the ultimate|vegetabledestroying machine.
{8014}{8057}Reg, me teeth!
{8109}{8163}Job well done, lad.
{8200}{8298}Subject disarmed and neutralized.
{8328}{8379}Bless you, AntiPesto.
{8381}{8464}With you out there protecting our veg,
{8465}{8543}the most important event|of the year is safe.
{8545}{8653}Aye. And I hope they give them pests|what's coming to 'em, and all.
{8655}{8724}Amen to that, Mrs. Mulch.
{10736}{10819}It was a long, hard night|last night, Gromit.
{10821}{10917}I'll need a good, hearty|breakfast under me belt.
{10945}{10989}Pile it up, lad.
{10990}{11065}I'm in the mood for food!
{11131}{11189}Gromit, old pal.
{11190}{11288}It's happened again.|I'll need assistance.
{11743}{11778}Well, thanks, chuck.
{11780}{11852}I'm sure that hole's getting smaller.
{11914}{12027}Another successful night.|How are the inmates?
{12029}{12110}Must be getting|a bit full down there.
{12190}{12230}Talking of which.
{12232}{12297}Now, for a great big plate of...
{12344}{12404}...vegetables.
{12446}{12515}Still got me on the diet, eh, Gromit?
{12517}{12613}Watching me shape?|There's a good dog.
{12670}{12702}Gromit, lad?
{12704}{12784}How is that prize melon|of yours coming on?
{12786}{12854}Must be a while|since you measured it.
{13520}{13614}Lovely food. For rabbits, that is.
{13760}{13869}As for me, I need something|a bit more cheesy.
{14368}{14428}Caught redhanded, eh, lad?
{14490}{14538}I'm sorry, Gromit.
{14549}{14631}I know you're doing this|for my own good,
{14633}{14726}but the fact is|I'm just crackers about cheese.
{14751}{14817}Look, if I must change me ways,
{14819}{14870}at least let me do it my way.
{14905}{14962}With technology.
{14994}{15071}It's time we tried my latest invention,
{15092}{15188}the Mind Manipulationomatic.
{15231}{15311}It extracts unwanted|thoughts and desires.
{15313}{15420}I haven't tested it yet,|but it should be perfectly safe.
{15422}{15507}Just a bit of harmless|brain alteration, that's all.
{15724}{15831}AntiPesto Humane Pest Control.|How might we be of assistance?
{15832}{15918}Yes. Lady Tottington here|of Tottington Hall.
{15920}{15953}Your Ladyship.
{15955}{16007}This is an honor.
{16021}{16098}It's a disaster. I have|the most terrible rabbit problem.
{16099}{16194}The competition's only days away.|You simply have to do something.
{16196}{16285}Certainly, ma'am. I think we're|about to go up in the world, lad.
{16287}{16354}Just stay right where you are,|your Ladyship,
{16355}{16410}and we'll be with you in an...
{16446}{16507}In an hour? I can't wait an hour.
{16509}{16618}I have a major infestation.|Hello? Hello?
{16671}{16714}That's more like it.
{16779}{16814}Thank goodness you've...
{16816}{16922}What ho! For you, my love.
{16937}{17041}Victor. How lovely and... unexpected.
{17043}{17114}Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother|and toodled on over
{17115}{17151}to sort the blighters out.
{17152}{17215}Gosh, that's awfully sweet of you.
{17217}{17260}But you really needn't bother.
{17262}{17356}It's no bother, little booboo. It's|the least a chap can do for his filly.
{17358}{17446}Don't want pests spoiling|our beautiful manor house, do we?
{17448}{17490}"Our" manor house?
{17492}{17579}No one's mentioned marriage, Victor.
{17581}{17629}All in good time, my dear.
{17631}{17678}Vermin first, though, what what.
{17680}{17725}Come on, Phillip.
{17727}{17750}Victor!
{17752}{17836}We can deal with this humanely.
{17891}{17942}Very classy.
{17944}{18043}Just the sort of client|we should be dealing with, eh, lad?
{18357}{18414}Burrowing bounders!
{18429}{18476}They must be breeding like...
{18493}{18542}...well, rabbits.
{18573}{18636}Only one thing for it, lad.
{18772}{18825}Victor, hadn't we agreed?
{18827}{18881}No more thoughtless killing.
{18883}{18918}Quite right, my dear.
{18920}{18983}So I've thought this one through|very carefully.
{18984}{19048}It's off to bunny heaven|for you, big ears.
{19050}{19082}Victor! No!
{19143}{19182}What the?
{19508}{19578}Champion sucker, eh, Gromit?
{19599}{19666}The BunVac 6000.
{19753}{19817}This'll impress her Ladyship.
{19821}{19891}I don't understand.|It should have been a bull'seye.
{19893}{19955}Oh, Victor. I felt we'd|made a real breakthrough
{19957}{20048}with this hunting obsession of yours.|I really thought you'd changed.
{20049}{20161}I'm sorry, Campanula,|but I am what I am.
{20163}{20227}There's no nonsense|with Victor Quartermaine.
{20229}{20294}What you see is what you get.
{20316}{20353}What the?
{20465}{20549}Sounds like a really big brute,|this one.
{20551}{20582}Give it some more welly.
{20709}{20732}Gosh!
{20968}{21040}Maybe I should've|used a bigger nozzle.
{21077}{21159}AntiPesto, you're here.
{21214}{21271}Your Ladyship.
{21292}{21353}My darlings!
{21415}{21462}You're safe.
{21493}{21518}My word!
{21520}{21615}What a fabulous job you've done.|And not a single one harmed.
{21617}{21689}The old BV6000, ma'am.
{21691}{21795}Capable of 125 RPM.|That's Rabbits Per Minute.
{21797}{21861}How inspired!
{21863}{21899} Mr?| Oh, Wallace.
{21901}{21941}Mr. Wallace.
{21942}{21997}Is this all of them?
{21998}{22089}Just one left.|Hoist her up, Gromit.
{22325}{22417}Victor, stop fooling around in the dirt|and have a look at this.
{22419}{22474}The ingenious AntiPesto
{22476}{22541}have completely dealt|with my rabbit problem.
{22544}{22600} Isn't it marvelous?| Marvelous?
{22601}{22627}Marvelous?
{22629}{22728}This confounded contraption|virtually suffocated me!
{22742}{22843}Besides, the job's only half done.
{22845}{22903}How do you intend|to finish these vermin off?
{22905}{22954}Crush 'em? Liquidize 'em?
{22956}{23046} They're humane.| Humane?
{23048}{23170}Well, then perhaps they'd be humane|enough to give me back my dignity.
{23172}{23211}I want...
{23304}{23350}Toupee, please.
{23352}{23426}Oh, grand.|We take check or cash.
{23428}{23535}Toupee, you idiot!|My hair is in your machine.
{23537}{23618}Oh, no, it's only rabbits in there.
{23619}{23698}The hare, I think you'll find,|is a much larger mammal.
{23700}{23744}Out of my way, fool.
{23853}{23944}I'm sorry, my dear, but I refuse|to suffer any further humiliation
{23946}{24013}at the hands of these|blundering nitwits.
{24014}{24080}I therefore bid you good day.
{24216}{24310}Thank you for ridding me|of a real problem, Mr. Wallace.
{24312}{24414}Tell me, what exactly will you do|with all these rabbits?
{24439}{24482}Trade secret.
{24483}{24578}Yes. I'd be happy to let them roam free|if it wasn't for the competition.
{24580}{24627}But they do so love their veg.
{24629}{24718}It's in their little bunny natures,|and you can't change that, can you?
{24720}{24761}No.
{24861}{24909}Or can you?
{24997}{25078}Why didn't we think of it before, lad?
{25095}{25189}The solution to all|our storage problems.
{25191}{25281}Simply by connecting the BunVac
{25283}{25351}to the Mind Manipulationomatic,
{25359}{25419}we can brainwash the bunnies.
{25435}{25513}Rabbit rehabilitation.
{25555}{25678}Once cured of their antisocial|vegravaging behavior,
{25680}{25787}the rabbits can be safely released|without fear of reoffending.
{25811}{25924}Just a little added lunar power|to enhance the mind waves...
{26067}{26118}...and we can begin.
{26211}{26279}Veg, bad.
{26280}{26350}Veg, bad.
{26351}{26411}Veg, bad.
{26451}{26526}Say no to carrots,
{26527}{26612}cabbage and cauliflower.
{26673}{26735}Well, come on, lad,|what are you waiting for?
{26737}{26782}Turn on the BunVac.
{26783}{26821}Full suction.
{27168}{27243}It's working, Gromit.|It's working!
{27354}{27402}Their tiny bunny brains
{27404}{27515}are being saturated|in my vegfree mind waves.
{27581}{27645}Another 30 minutes|brainwashing should suffice.
{27647}{27734}Then we can move on|to the conditioning.
{28039}{28069}Gromit!
{28112}{28151}Switch it off!
{28152}{28188}Get it off!
{28228}{28275}Get it off me, lad!
{28592}{28661}Oh, thanks, lad.
{28825}{28856}Quick.
{28857}{28904}Give us a carrot.
{29130}{29181}It worked, Gromit!
{29183}{29239}A reformed rabbit.
{29240}{29328}We'll call him Hutch. Shall we?
{29329}{29380}Come on. Let's get the kettle on.
{29382}{29440}We'll see to him in the morning.
{29533}{29641}I feel we're on the cusp|of a real breakthrough, lad.
{29708}{29832}Mankind freed from|rabbit problems forever.
{29919}{29992}Lady Tottington will be impressed.
{31219}{31247}Good night.
{31293}{31332}Sleep tight.
{31333}{31403}And don't let the bed bugs bite.
{31743}{31804}Good night, Gromit.
{31805}{31873}Sweet dreams, old chum.
{32490}{32495}Protect and nourish the frail|and the weak, O Lord.
{32495}{32603}Protect and nourish the frail|and the weak, O Lord.
{32605}{32722}Let them grow big and strong|under Thy loving care.
{32724}{32831}In fact, let them grow bigger|and stronger than anyone else's,
{32833}{32910}so that the first prize might be mine.
{32912}{32965}Amen.
{33006}{33065}The harvest offering|to bind the deal.
{33087}{33206}We plow the fields|and scatter the good seed on...
{33767}{33835}He sends the snow in winter...
{34018}{34075}All good gifts around us
{34077}{34134}Are sent from...
{34165}{34220}Heavens above.
{34222}{34250}Hello?
{34335}{34412}Hello? Is anybody there?
{34503}{34552}Mrs. Mulch?
{34576}{34646}Please, come forward,|whoever you are.
{34647}{34712}There's no need to be afraid.
{34790}{34906}You're hungry.|Then please, take what you like.
{34908}{34985}It is for the needy, after all.
{35111}{35177}No! No! No! No!
{35225}{35270}Mercy!
{36804}{36844}Morning, Gromit.
{36930}{37036}A pestfree night per... chance?
{37184}{37245}Lummy day.
{37264}{37308} It's a disaster.| Me garden's ruined.
{37308}{37329} It's a disaster.| Me garden's ruined.
{37331}{37395} It's carnage out there.| Where were AntiPesto?
{37397}{37463}Simmer down.|Simmer down, now.
{37465}{37565}Right. One at a time, if ya please.
{37567}{37638}We pay good money|for our crop protection.
{37640}{37746}If ya can't deliver the goods,|maybe you should keep your traps shut.
{37763}{37839}I never saw such cauliflower carnage.
{37841}{37918}Worse than the|Great Slug Blight of '32,
{37920}{38011}when there were slugs|the size of pigs.
{38012}{38064}Growbag's right. The slugs are back!
{38066}{38095}The slugs are back!
{38097}{38147}That's enough! That's enough!
{38173}{38264}Look, this flippin'|vegetable competition
{38265}{38333} causes nothin' but trouble every year.| Here we go.
{38335}{38376} If ya ask me...| Get on with ya!
{38378}{38503}Know what? I'll tell ya.|If ya ask me, this was arson.
{38504}{38540} Arson?| Aye!
{38541}{38606}Someone arsin' around.
{38608}{38689}That's right.|One of you lot. A man.
{38691}{38750} This was no man.| What are you saying?
{38848}{38908}Does a man have teeth
{38910}{38979}the size of axe blades?
{39080}{39176}Or ears like terrible tombstones?
{39221}{39279}By tampering with nature,
{39281}{39394}forcing vegetables to swell|far beyond their natural size,
{39396}{39512}we have brought a terrible judgment|upon ourselves.
{39563}{39604}Hey! Give over!
{39692}{39724}You're mental.
{39725}{39756}And for our sins,
{39757}{39852}a hideous creature|has been sent to punish us all!
{39854}{39907}Repent! Repent!
{39908}{40000}Lest you too, taste the wrath of...
{40022}{40098}...the WereRabbit!
{40128}{40222}This is terrible!|What's going to happen to us?
{40224}{40276} Doomed!| Who's going to help us?
{40277}{40354} What's to become of the show?| We live for that competition.
{40356}{40420} Get off me.| We're simple folk. It's all we have.
{40421}{40481} Who will save us?| Get... Hey!
{40529}{40570}A WereRabbit?
{40572}{40602}Oh, come, come, now.
{40604}{40692}I do believe the vicar's been|to the communion wine again.
{40752}{40845}What we are dealing with here|is no supernatural rabbit.
{40847}{40930}It's a big fellow, perhaps.
{40932}{40990}But a mortal creature|of flesh and blood.
{40992}{41080}A matter easily dealt with|by a hunter.
{41089}{41189}Guns will not be necessary,|thank you, Victor.
{41190}{41265}Hasn't there been enough destruction?
{41307}{41381}I believe the killing|of fluffy creatures
{41383}{41434}is neverjustified.
{41436}{41534}I say we give AntiPesto|a second chance.
{41536}{41636}What? How on earth would|those tinyminded buffoons
{41637}{41706}ever catch such a big rabbit?
{41725}{41770}Mr. Wallace?
{41918}{41968}Well...
{42070}{42120}With a big trap.
{42122}{42197}By Jove. He's... He's got it!
{42199}{42233} Genius!| Genius!
{42234}{42277} Brilliant.| What a great idea!
{42279}{42338}Clever.
{42361}{42408}You see, Victor,
{42410}{42485}there's hope for the vegetables yet.
{42519}{42573}Not the ones I'm looking at.
{42611}{42660}That's me boys!
{42904}{42945}Love, Gromit.
{42947}{43021}That's the biggest trap of all.
{43023}{43074}The "tender trap," they call it.
{43076}{43143}And that's what we'll use|to catch this thing.
{43145}{43245}Yes, lad, a lovely lady rabbit.
{43324}{43420}How could any|hotblooded rabbitbeast resist?
{43654}{43705}Oh, come on, Gromit.
{43706}{43807}A bit more, you know, alluring.
{43977}{44019}Very cheeky.
{44224}{44274}That's more like it, lad.
{44276}{44340}How can we possibly fail now?
{44361}{44418}You're a total knockout.
{44627}{44663}Stick around, lad.
{44683}{44758}Should fix back on quite easily.
{49049}{49107}Nightynight, me lovelies.
{49131}{49188}Think big now.
{49545}{49608}No!
{50773}{50844}Don't worry. No. No.
{50846}{50908}Well, I'm very sorry, Mrs. Mulch.
{50910}{50981}We'll get there as soon as we can.|Mr. Dibber. Oh, yes.
{50983}{51055}Can I call you back? Mrs. Girdling.
{51057}{51126} A tunnel you say?| What do you intend to do about this?
{51128}{51173}I'll look into it.
{51181}{51233}So where did you get to, lad?
{51234}{51289}I thought I told you to stay put.
{51292}{51339}It's gone mad around here.
{51349}{51430}I thought we were|supposed to be a team.
{51442}{51490}How are we ever|gonna catch this thing
{51492}{51576}if you go gallivanting off|on your own all the time?
{51601}{51641}You're doing it again!
{51643}{51709}Where are you going now?
{51711}{51753}Gromit!
{51794}{51821}Grommy!
{51879}{51909}Really, lad.
{51910}{52013}You do realize I've made|a personal promise to Lady Tottington.
{52015}{52074}How is this sort of|behavior going to get us
{52075}{52172}any nearer to finding|a rabbitmon... ster?
{52322}{52368}Hutch.
{52411}{52459}Oh, Gromit.
{52461}{52533}We've created a monster.
{52534}{52599}Hutch is the beast.
{52630}{52689}The lunar panels.
{52721}{52857}They must've overstimulated|Hutch's primitive bunny nature.
{52859}{52916}And now, when the moon appears,
{52918}{53019}he undergoes|a hideous transformation.
{53402}{53444}Oh, Gromit.
{53486}{53576}This is absolutely...
{53613}{53661}...fantastic!
{53677}{53720}Don't you see, lad?
{53722}{53807}OK, so we've created|a vegravaging rabbitmonster.
{53809}{53897}But we've also captured it.
{53899}{53957}Just like I promised Lady Tottington.
{53959}{54022}I'll go and tell her the good news.
{54038}{54097}Make sure he doesn't escape.
{54099}{54133}Bye!
{56425}{56455}Mr. Wallace.
{56456}{56555}It's the beast, your Ladyship.|I bring great news.
{56557}{56646}Gosh, how exciting.|Please, do come in.
{56938}{57011}Well, this is simply spiffing news.
{57013}{57107}With the beast in captivity,|the competition can go ahead as planned.
{57108}{57175}You saved the day, Mr. Wallace.
{57176}{57227}It was nothing, your Ladyship.
{57228}{57279}So modest.
{57281}{57323}Oh, please, do help yourself.
{57362}{57402}Thanks.
{57437}{57541}I so appreciate you coming|all this way to let me know, Wallace.
{57543}{57616}Tell me, are you|a vegetablelover yourself?
{57618}{57698} They're... growing on me.| Then come with me.
{57700}{57800}There's something|very special I want to show you.
{57988}{58023}Hop in.
{58048}{58139} It's very snug.| It's my Jacob's ladder.
{58164}{58242}And it goes all the way to heaven.
{58471}{58558}Welcome to my inner sanctum, Wallace.
{58583}{58644}My secret garden.
{58660}{58728}It's a veritable
{58729}{58816}vegetable paradise.
{58818}{58874}I just knew you'd love it.
{58876}{58916}Unlike Victor.
{58918}{59005}He's never shown|any interest in my produce.
{59007}{59076} His loss, Lady Tottington.| Please, Wallace.
{59093}{59135}Call me Totty.
{59413}{59476}If anything were to happen|to my vegetables,
{59478}{59520}I don't know what I'd do.
{59521}{59574}I'm sure you understand, Mr. Wallace.
{59576}{59632}I can see that you're|a true nature lover.
{59634}{59685}Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
{59701}{59761}At first, I thought|I could change Victor.
{59762}{59812}Now I'm not so sure.
{59852}{59908}Do you think a man can change, Wallace?
{59910}{59949}Change?
{59950}{59982}Oh, yes.
{60110}{60206}Really, Phillip.|The things one does for love.
{60404}{60445}Pesto.
{60486}{60549} Mr. Wallace.| Oh, Totty.
{60569}{60604}Totty?
{60727}{60781}I'd like to show you one last thing.
{60782}{60880}Something no other man|has ever seen.
{60926}{60987}My carrot de Chantenay.
{61015}{61053}Just smell it, Wallace.
{61055}{61112} Feel its silken flesh.| Oh, yes.
{61113}{61208}Isn't it the most sumptuous,|succulent specimen you've ever seen?
{61210}{61260} Yes!| Doesn't it fill your heart
{61262}{61289} with desire?| Yes!
{61290}{61374}Just imagine|what it would taste like.
{61508}{61574}What on earth|were you thinkin' of, lad?
{61576}{61670}Ruined a perfectly good piece|of fashionable knitwear, that did.
{61672}{61766}To say nothing of a relationship|with an important client.
{61814}{61917}It's lucky for us her Ladyship|was so understanding.
{61934}{62013}Honestly, I don't know|what's got into you lately.
{62014}{62070}And slow down for pity's sake.
{62072}{62121}You'll buckle me trunnions.
{62291}{62343}Don't worry. I'll see to this.
{62360}{62442}You stay here where you belong.|In the doghouse.
{62550}{62589}Right.
{62671}{62714}It's heavier than it looks.
{62946}{63001}I know your little secret, Pesto.
{63002}{63074} I know exactly what's going on.| Your Lordship...
{63075}{63144}Yes. You think you can|pilfer my filly, don't you?
{63164}{63225}You think you can con|a woman out of her fortune?
{63227}{63289} Who, me?| Well, I got here first!
{63291}{63376}I've spent a long time reeling in|that fluffyheaded bunnylover.
{63378}{63466}And I'm not about to let some|puddleheaded peasant poach her from me.
{63468}{63533} Comprenez?| Righto.
{63535}{63582}I'll be off then. Tata.
{63622}{63682}You're not going anywhere, Pesto.
{63744}{63827}Not until I've taught you|a jolly good lesson.
{63916}{63959}Come on! Queensberry rules!
{63961}{64009}Put 'em up, ya little pipsqueak.
{64074}{64123}You're shaking.
{64125}{64214}Don't tell me you're a scaredycat|as well as a scoundrel.
{64330}{64389}And don't think acting|like a big girl's blouse
{64391}{64434}will get you out of it.
{64435}{64497}There's no mercy|with Victor Quartermaine.
