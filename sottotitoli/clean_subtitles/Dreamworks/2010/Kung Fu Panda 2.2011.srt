Long ago, in ancient China,
The Peacock rules over the Gongmen city.
They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city
For they have invented fireworks.
But their son, Lord Shen
Saw darker path in the fireworks.
What has brought color and joy
Can also bring darkness and destruction.
Shen trouble parent consult to a Soothsayer.
She foretold that if Shen continue
down to this dark path,
He will be defeated by the warrior
of black and white.
The Young Lord set out to change his fate.
But what he did next, only sealed.
Shen returned to his parents for a prize.
But in their faces, he saw only horror.
He was banned from the city forever.
But Shen swore revenge.
Some day, he will return and all
of China will bow at his feet.
Almost done, Lord Shen
But we ran out of metal.
Search the fartest villages,
find more metal.
China will be mine soon.
And then the Dragon warrior joined
the Furious Five.
And then we became the most
awesome Kung Fu team ever.
Enough talk.
Let's fight.
Listen! You can hear the Dragon warrior
is training right now.
33.... Stop.
It's too dangerous.
Stay focus.
How did he do it. This is freak?
38 dumpling.
Yeah! New record.
You monster.
Keep going, Hit 40
He never hit 40.
You guys, don't worry.
I'll go to 40.

No problem.
Wait a moment.
Yeah!
Yoooo...ho....!
He did it.
Well done Po.

Ah! What are you doing?
One of Master Oogway final teaching.
Oh! Oh!...Awesome.
How did you do that?
Inner peace.
Inner peace, that cool!
Inner peace of what?
It is the next phase of your training.
Every master must
find his path to inner peace.
Some choose to the meditate for
50 years in a cave just like this
Without a try to taste the food or water.
Or?
some find true a pain and suffering as I did.
At thoes day you was chosen
to be Dragon Warrior
...was the worst day of my life.
By far...
Nothing else came close.
It was the worst most painful,
mind destroyed horrible moment.
Okeay!
I have ever experienced.
But once I realized the problem was
not you, but within me
I found inner peace, I was able to
honest full of the universe.
So that's it,
I just need inner peace.
My inner is already super super peaceful
So I only need to do,
is just get this thing going.
Inner peace, You going down.
Now show me what you
were doing now with your feet,
I served you fancy food thing.
Po!
Bandit!
Approaching the musician in the village.
Dangerous. Tell thoes musician to start
play some action music.
Because it is on.
Don't worry Shifu, I will master
inner peace as soon as I get back.
No snack up this time.
Hus...Ha....Snack up.
Wait, are you serious?
Aah...!
Take all the metal you can find
Grap the metal.
Help! help! help!
That's everything.
Let’s get out of here.

Protecting the valley
The Dragon Warrior!
Po!
Yeah!

Good. My son.
You should have told you will come.
Hi dad!
I would have saved you some Tofu.
Ah!
Dad, can I talk to you?
Of course son.
In honor of my son: Free Tofu desserts
for everybody...
Yeah!
Oh! with purchased.
So good to see you,

Have you lost weight?
I could almost put my wings around you.
Oh! Well maybe a little.
Poor you, you must feel weak,
Let me get you some soup.
Oh! No. That's ok dad.
I’m not hungry.
Not hungry?
Po, you alright?
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm fine, I Just…
Today, I was fighting bandit.
Nothing too dangerous
I mean they was just… you know...
Yeah!
And then, a strangest thing happened,
I have a crazy vision.
I think I saw my mom.
And me as a baby.
Mom? a Baby?
Hmm...Dad?
What he talking about?
How can I say this?
Where did I come from?
Well you see, my son.
A baby come from a little egg.
Don’t ask me where the eggs come from.
Dad, it is not what I mean.
I know it's not.
I think it is time to told you something
that I should told you a long time ago.
Ok!
You might have been kind of....
....Adopted.
I knew it.
You knew? Who told you?
No one.
I mean…. come on dad.
But if you do,
Why didn't you ever say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
How did I get here dad?
Where did I come from?
Actually...
You came from this.
It was just another day at the restaurant,
Time to make the noodle
I went out to the back. Where the
vegetables has just been delivered
Chinese cabbage, radish, turnip ...
There were no vegetables
Just a very hungry baby panda.
There was no one.
Of course you could eat meet.
I've been waiting for someone to come
looking for you
But no one did.
I brought you inside
Fed you
Gave you a bath
And fed you again,
And again,
I were trying to put some pants on you.
And then I made a decision would
change my life forever.
To make my super delicious soup.
And to raise you as my own son.
Po, My little panda.
And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life
Have been that much sweeter.
My little Po, Is this the end of the story.
Look at me.
No, don't look at me.
That's it
That can't be it.
That have to be more dad.
Well, There were the time you ate
all my bamboo furniture.
It was important too.
One dumpling please,
Dragon Warrior size.
Oh Po, your story may not have such
a happy beginning, but look how it turn out
You got me, you got Kung Fu,
and you got noodles.
I know, I just have so many questions.
Like how I ever fit in this tiny basket.
Why didn't I like pants?
And who am I?
Good, watch your position.
Good
Shen?
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Now we got my parent out of their way,
Please leave my house.
Your house?
Yes,
didn’t you see the peacock in the front door?
They were so sad,
It seems your fortune are
not as good as you thought.
We shall see, Shen
You shall see goat, well well
What do you want Shen?
What is right!
Gongmen city.
Gongmen is under reasonability of
the master council. And we will protect it.
Even from you.
I'm so glad you feel that way.
Otherwise that case is open up.
What's in the box, Shen?
Want to see it?.
It's a gift.
It is your parting gift.
I mean it will part you.
Part of you here, part of you there,
and part of you way way there on the wall.
You insane fool.
Show off, That is a warning.
You are no match for us in Kung Fu.
I agree, but this is.
Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen city?
Master thunder Rhino as I know.
Son of the legendary Flying Rhino?
Yes.
And the slayer of ten thousands surface
in the valey of gold.
He's dead.
That, that is impossible.
Rhino horn defend is imperial to any technique.
There were no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon.
One the breed firer and spread metal.
Unless he is stopped, This could be
the end of Kung Fu.
But I just got Kung Fu,
And now you must save it.
Go destroy the weapon, and bring
Lord Shen to justice.
Ok here we go.
here we go.
Whooo! Whooo! Wait, Wait a second,
how can I do this
I mean how can Kung Fu stop
something that stop Kung Fu.
Remember Dragon Warrior,
Anything is possible when you have inner peace.
Inner Peace.
Inner Peace.
Inner Peace.
Peace on
Po!
I get your things back.
I brought your food for week, cookie, bun
vegetables, and even all your action finger.

Oh! I don’t know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.
Dad, you make a scratch on my doll tiger
I also pack your painting, the best
time together, just in case you get lonely.
That me and you making noodles,
and that me and you eating noodle.
And that me giving you a piggy back ride.
That's cute, and the second thought
I hang out this one.
Hey! Dad.
They are waiting for me.
Of course, you have a job to do.
Far from home.
A strange city, filled with strange
people and strange noodles.
Facing horrible danger from
would you might never return.
Don’t go Po.

It kind of my job to save Kung Fu.
And if I don’t.
What am I?

Now I feel nothing
That is really cool
Again.
Hus..!

Oh 20, 20 years.

Perfect.
With the weapon,

With the weapon, by my side,

We move out in 3 days, when the moon
is full and the tide is high.
You old goat,

Fortune?
The future,

Looking to your bowl,
And tell me what glorious await
If you continue on your current path...
You will find yourself...
At the bottom of the stair.
I see....

I see...pain.
And anger.
How dare you,
That is the finest suit in the kingdom.
Followed by deny,
This is not fortune telling.
You just say what is happening right,
No.
The most important time is now.
But if you really want to see the future ...
What do you see?
A peacock.
Be defeated by a warrior of black and white.
Nothing has changed.
That is impossible.
And you know it.
It is not impossible.
And he knows it.
Who?

A Panda?
A Kung Fu warrior,
he fought like a demon.
Big and fury, soft and squeachy.
Kind of cluching.

Your magic panda, clearly a fool.
Are you certain it is panda
who is the fool?
You just destroyed your ancestor your home,
Shen.
A trivial sarcify,
when all of China is my reward.
Then you will finaly be satisfied.
The destruction of the whole world,
finaly make you feel better.
This is not. Maybe I built
into the dungeon.
The cup you choose to fill have no bottom.
It is time to stop this madness.
Why on earth would I do that?
So your parent can rest in peace.
My parents hate me.
Do you understand?
They feel wrong to me,
But I will make it right.
They love you, they love you so much
that having to send you away.
but that exit in the past.
And I must extend to the future.
Set SoothSayer free,
She is not use to me.
Good bye Shen, I wish you happiness.
Happiness?
must be taken.
and I will take mine.
Hurry up...
If all of those weapon leave the building,
China will fall
We bring down the building.
Hey guys, how a bout this.?
Oh this will work,
Alright, let's go.
I can't feel my face.
Damn you peacock.
Hey!
Keep it cool.
You ...
Where are you going?
On your feet,

Move you dogs, faster faster.
Load the boat.
Greeting Panda.
Tell me what happened that night?
What night?
That night.
Oh, that night.
Yes!
Yes, I was there.

as a terrible thing
I believe it went something like this.
Happy New Year, kid.
Hope you like it,

Po, What is he doing here?
Return it, return it.

Where am I?
What is this place?
I'm supprised you remember so little.
But you was so little
When it happened.
Perhape you do remember.
You know what,

Nightmares or memories?
This was the windy village.
YOUNG SHEN,
was in line to rule Gongmen city.
But he wanted more.
I foretold that someone will standing his way,
a panda.
But I never could have foretold
what came next.
Kill them all!
Take our son,
and run away, Go
Stop fighting. Let it flows.
Your story may not have a such happy beginning
But that doesn't make you who you are
It is the rest of your story.
Who you choose to be.

that stuff of the pass,
because it just doesn't matter.
The only thing that matter,
is what you choose to be now.
