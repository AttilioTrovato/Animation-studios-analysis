Raccoon, Raccoon,
Come on out and play. 
I can't right now, I'm eating. 
What is it you're eating? 
Pickled plums and radish. 
How about some for me? 
Hey. Don't be so greedy. 
We raccoons
have always lived close by humans. 
Not to steal their food. Not at all. 
Where there are paddies and fields, 
there are frogs and grasshoppers,
mice and moles. 
There's fruit,
like persimmons and mulberries. 
There's much more food
than in the woods. 
Last spring, the old farmhouse
was suddenly abandoned. 
It looked like no one was coming back,
so we all moved in. 
We spent a really wonderful year there. 
Living in a detached house
with a garden was like a dream. 
But then... 
We raccoons usually don't make a fuss
over territory, but this was different. 
Wherever we went looking for food,
we ran into other raccoons. 
There were quarrels,
and fights over burrows. 
And finally... 
Pom Poko 31, autumn. 
On the newly logged border between
Taka and Suzu Woods, 
the raccoons of the Tama Hills
gathered for their final battle. 
The Red Army was commanded by Gonta,
a fearsome raccoon of Taka. 
The Blue Army was led by Seizaemon,
an elder of Suzu. 
Now, it's a littleknown fact, 
but when humans aren't around, raccoons
walk on two legs, just as you see here. 
The battle was hardfought,
but it did not last long. 
Fight! Fight! Taka!
Fight! Fight! Suzu!
Red wins! Blue wins!
Both of you lose!
Slaughter the losing raccoons!
Taka loses today,
Suzu loses tomorrow!
The raccoons have nowhere to go.
Where can the raccoons go to?
There's nowhere for them to go.
Whether Red wins or Blue wins,
both sides lose.
Kill the losing raccoons!
There are too many of them!
Fewer raccoons is better for all!
The rest of you,
control yourselves!
Stop having children!
Have more children
and you'll lose everything!
Your homes are disappearing,
and that's a fact!
Granny Oroku was right. 
The raccoons were stunned
by the desolation around them. 
Their woods were disappearing. 
A chilling panorama of denuded,
flattened hills 
A chilling panorama of denuded,
flattened hills 
stretched as far
as the eye could see. 
This is madness!
It's no time for us to be fighting!
In those days, Japan was entering
a golden age of economic growth. 
Demand for housing
around Tokyo exploded. 
Lots of farmland and forest disappeared
in waves of uncontrolled development. 
As Tokyo grew, it gnawed the land in
random patterns like a huge insect. 
Then in 1967, the city fathers
hit on a better idea: 
A plan for a new suburb of Tokyo
called Tama New Town. 
Over 300,000 people would populate
an area of 3,000 hectares. 
Forests would be cleared,
hills flattened, valleys filled, 
farms and fields obliterated,
old farmhouses demolished. 
The Tama Hills would be transformed
into an enormous construction site 
to create a model bedroom town
for Tokyo's workers. 
It was the largest urban development
project in history. 
You've got to hand it to these humans
they're really something.
We always thought
they were animals just like us,
but now we know we were wrong.
They must be even more powerful
than the gods.
Raccoon clans
from all over the Tama Hills 
gathered secretly late one night
at the old abandoned Manpuku Temple, 
deep in the forest. 
By unanimous agreement of all present, 
the meeting was chaired
by Tsurukame Osho, 
the temple's 105yearold
resident raccoon. 
...so in view of
the current difficulties,
we must abandon our nocturnal habits
and be prepared to act
at any time of the day or night.
Amid some confusion, 
the assembly agreed
on a policy to stop the development. 
That makes it unanimous!
The raccoons turned for home, 
leaving it to the clan elders to work
out a specific course of action. 
The elders settled
on a fiveyear program 
to revive the neglected art
of shapeshifting 
and study the ways of humans. 
They invited renowned practitioners
of shapeshifting 
from Sado and Shikoku islands, 
where the art was most advanced,
to teach the young raccoons. 
But in view of the difficulties 
and danger posed by the long journeys
required to fetch these teachers, 
there were none willing to go.
So, they all pretended to fall asleep. 
I suppose we'll just have to wait
for the youngsters
to acquire the skills on their own.
Agreed!
The McDonald's hamburgers
provided to facilitate the discussion 
were enthusiastically received. 
And with that,
the council of elders concluded. 
NO DUMPING
Keeping close track of the doings of
humans was of the utmost importance, 
so the raccoons decided
to set up a television 
in their headquarters,
the main hall of Manpuku Temple. 
Good evening.
Good evening! 
The arrival of the television
provoked great interest. 
The headquarters at Manpuku Temple
were soon crowded with visitors 
who were there just to spend the day
watching television. 
Shapeshifting requires the highest
degree of mental concentration.
It means changing one's
very cells in an instant.
Truly, this is nature's
greatest miracle.
Lesser forms of transformation can be
achieved by such animals as chameleons.
But only raccoons, foxes and some old
cats can practice real shapeshifting.
Gonta!
That you can assume
such an appearance, even for a moment,
proves you've taken the first steps on
the path, whether you realize it or not.
If one studies hard
and grasps the basics,
any raccoon can learn to shapeshift.
At least in theory.
Allow me to demonstrate!
Aren't you going to put a leaf
on your head?
That's for beginners!
That's for beginners!
It's been a long time!
And a one, and a two!
With Granny Oroku as their instructor, 
the raccoons made steady progress
in the art of shapeshifting. 
Young raccoons from every clan burned
with desire to hone their skills. 
Bravo, Shokichi!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
I've been interested in humans
and their ways ever since I was a child.
As a rule we weren't supposed
to approach them,
but for my late father, I think that
just sharpened his interest.
Careful observation of humans is
a basic requirement for shapeshifting,
so I'm sure he thought getting close
to them would prove useful.
It goes without saying that some of our
raccoons were not good students. 
In fact, many of them
simply couldn't manage at all. 
Shapeshifting requires rigorous
physical and mental discipline. 
Naturally this discouraged
many of the raccoons, 
who unlike foxes,
are inclined to be rather lazy. 
Hey!
Ponkichi!
All the arhats are here! Turn them!
Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!
Back then all I thought about
was shapeshifting.
I never dreamed
my childhood pal Ponkichi
wanted nothing more than to live
like a normal raccoon.
...so when the traveler
reached the mountain pass,
he saw the pine tree seemed
to have grown an extra branch.
Now, this was odd.
The traveler said to himself, "There
wasn't a branch on that side last time."
And lo and behold!
The branch switched sides.
Seeing this, the traveler said aloud,
"That's not right either.
There were branches on both sides."
And sure enough,
branches sprouted on both sides.
The next instant, boom!
Something fell!
What was it, do you suppose?
A raccoon!
Right! And why did he fall? Gonta?
He was a klutz. I'd never fall.
That's the spirit!
Sasuke, why do you think he fell?
He had to let go of the tree
to make two branches.
Very good! And what is the moral
of this story? Shokichi?
It doesn't pay to take
what humans say literally.
That's correct.
We raccoons are naturally goodnatured.
We get carried away!
We try too hard to please!
This is where we go wrong.
Do you see?
Yes, Tsurukame Osho!
So if I were to say: "Mr. Raccoon,
Mr. Raccoon, come out and play"?
We're in the middle of a lesson now!
See? You're already getting
carried away! This is what worries me!
As the raccoons worked to understand
humans and practice shapeshifting, 
winter turned to spring. The plum trees
blossomed, and love was in the air. 
But most of the raccoons heeded Granny
Oroku's admonition to remain chaste 
and avoid having children until
everyone's homes were safe again. 
They suppressed
their maternal instincts 
and firmly rejected the clumsy efforts
of the males to woo them. 
Meanwhile, the massive building program
was picking up steam. 
Woods were cleared,
the earth was scoured, 
and construction sites multiplied. 
The raccoons,
filled with anger and sadness, 
called these sites "bald hills." 
Mr. Postman, you dropped something 
Freed from the work of childrearing, 
some of the females started
to practice shapeshifting too. 
When males tried to pass themselves
off as women or children, 
the overall effect was not quite right. 
With the participation of the females,
this problem was solved. 
Naturally, some of the females wanted to
try their hand at turning into males. 
Ah, I'd like the males
to stay after class today.
One day, Tsurukame Osho
gave a special lecture for the males. 
Now then, what do you think
the carpet you are all sitting on is?
I may as well tell you.
It's my testicles!
It's exactly eight mats.
And I'll prove it!
The time finally came for the students
to test their skills in the real world. 
The exercise was conducted
like a driving lesson. 
Each student was accompanied
by an advanced partner, 
in case of unforeseen problems or
someone seeing through their disguise. 
Shapeshifting requires
large amounts of energy, 
especially when assuming human form. 
The dark circles
raccoons have around their eyes 
are the result of sheer fatigue. 
Even experienced shapeshifters 
have to secretly carry special herbs 
to replenish their strength
at a moment's notice. 
Otherwise, out pops the tail, 
and the next thing you know,
they're back to their original form. 
Recently raccoons have discovered 
that quickacting energy drinks widely
sold in stores are a good pickmeup. 
To graduate
from the shapeshifting course, 
students had to pass one final test: 
To go out and earn at least
1,000 yen through honest labor. 
Help!
Some raccoons got together and took
turns impersonating the same human. 
Others transformed themselves
into monks with begging bowls. 
Some females worked in clubs and raked
in money drinking with customers. 
Another raccoon parlayed a discarded
pachinko ball into big money. 
One tricky raccoon
burgled a temple donation box, 
but all he got was small change. 
So he transformed some leaves into
bills, but Oroku saw right through him. 
I told you modern shapeshifting
forbids turning leaves into money!
One day, an urgent report interrupted
Gonta's training at headquarters. 
He hurried home
to Taka Woods to face tragedy. 
More than half his childhood home had
already been ravaged by construction. 
Gonta went mad with grief. 
Gonta went mad with grief. 
He raced back to headquarters 
and forced Tsurukame Osho
to call a meeting of the clan elders, 
where he called for a strategy
of violent attacks on the humans. 
I'm completely against this.
Why?
The time is not ripe. We're still
in the first year of the FiveYear Plan.
We've all completed our training.
There's a lot we can do right now!
What do you think, Granny? Do you think
these youngsters are up to it?
True, they've mastered the basics,
but...
But?
They lack experience.
One slip and they'll be exposed.
Gonta, I have to ask you this.
I think your anger at what happened to
Taka Woods is clouding your judgment.
Isn't that so?
I swear there is
absolutely no truth to that.
I'm thinking of the welfare
of all the raccoons of Tama.
What do you mean, everyone's welfare?
Don't forget, Gonta's the one
who tried to take over Suzu Woods!
Shut up! Even if no one's for it, we
raccoons of Taka are going ahead anyway.
If Gonta's that determined,
I'm going to help him!
You too, Shokichi?
Thank you!
It's too late to stop us now!
Not so fast!
Don't try to stop us, Granny!
Just this once,
I'll teach you a special technique!
If you bungle this,
you won't return to your original form
for five days.
So, what is it?
A dead fox!
Pom Poko 32, summer. 
Ten young volunteers
led by Gonta of Taka Woods 
set out to apply
their new skills in shapeshifting 
with a series of desperate
surprise attacks on the humans. 
The raccoons were fighting back at last. 
Here they come!
They're coming!
Keep going! Keep going!
We did it!
Multiple Accidents At
Construction Site
Disaster struck the Tama New Town
development at approximately 2:30 p.m. 
A series of landslides and accidents
killed three workers, injured two, 
and destroyed
a residence under construction. 
Live
Police suspect reduced visibility
and unstable ground from heavy rains. 
The widespread, simultaneous nature of
the accidents is raising concern 
there may be fundamental problems
with the development plan. 
Some local residents
are calling for a review of the plan. 
Hold on, everyone!
I think we should take a moment
to remember the poor humans
who died in this operation.
Osho is right.
Let's observe a minute of silent prayer
for the unfortunate victims.
Agreed! A minute of silence!
All pray!
Look, it's Gonta!
The heroes have returned!
You really did it, Shokichi!
You youngsters have put hope back
in this old heart of mine.
That was only the beginning!
Today was just a practice run!
Raccoons, the war has started!
We must kill, crush,
and mangle every human we can,
until they are
driven from the Tama Hills!
Shokichi, you should say something too!
And let's plant trees! Lots and lots of
our favorite persimmon trees!
Little persimmon seeds,
send out your shoots!
We'll have
all the persimmons we can eat!
Out with the humans!
Slaughter the humans!
OK, OK, OK. But first we must celebrate
this auspicious victory!
You know, something worries me.
What?
Are we really going to
drive out all the humans?
Of course!
Can't we let a few of them stay,
the way it used to be?
No way!
The twolegs are our sworn enemies.
They're vermin. We've got to
get rid of them once and for all!
I see.
I mean, look, I hate humans too.
Well, some of them are not so bad.
I mean, I really do hate them. But...
But what?
But if we get rid of them all,
we'll never eat tempura again!
Or sardines!
Or corn!
Hamburgers! Donuts! Fried chicken!
Potato chips! Pizza!
I can taste it!
Well then, Gonta, shall we
let a few of the humans stay?
I guess it can't be helped.
Hooray for Gon!
Lift him up, fellows!
The moon, moon, moon shines bright 
Over Man, Man, Manpuku Temple 
All our friends are here tonight
Pon poko pon pon, pon pon! 
We'll show the world
What Tsurukame Osho can do! 
Come on, come on! All our friends are
here tonight! Come on, come on! 
... a government spokesman stressed 
that the project is an urgent necessity
for the people of Tokyo, 
and that today's accidents
will not affect 
the government's determination to carry
out the building of Tama New Town. 
What?!
It was a very unfortunate accident. 
Poor Gonta,
the driving force behind the attacks, 
suffered fractures and internal injuries
that would take a year to heal. 
The news report plunged
the raccoons into depression. 
But when television began to cover local
residents' fears of divine retribution, 
their spirits soared again. 
Maybe it was a mistake,
moving that Shinto shrine. 
How do you mean? 
Maybe all these incidents are revenge
from the gods of the shrine. 
It's true that a lot of Jizo statues
and shrines have been moved. 
Yes, that really worried me. 
I asked the developers to observe
the proper ceremonies 
before moving them, but... 
Professor Mizuki,
what do you think about all this? 
These spirit entities are usually
associated with a given location. 
If their abodes are moved,
they'll try to return home. 
If they do, and find everything has
changed, they naturally become upset. 
I have a feeling there's a lot more
trouble to come. 
Maybe I can save my woods after all.
Shokichi and the others
went into action. 
The owner of Shokichi's woods
came to inspect his property 
with one of the developers
before construction began. 
To his surprise, he saw a lot more
Jizo statues than he remembered. 
"I'd better give this more thought,"
he told the developer, 
and held off on signing
the contract to sell his land. 
During a ceremony at another shrine
that was slated to be moved, 
one of the raccoons suddenly appeared
on the roof disguised as a fox, 
the shrine's servant to the gods. 
The fox's eerie cry brought the
proceedings to an immediate halt. 
The fox's eerie cry brought the
proceedings to an immediate halt. 
The ceremony was canceled,
the shrine's relocation put on hold, 
and residents petitioned the authorities 
to change plans for a road
through the area. 
The raccoons were on a roll. 
Each group tried to outdo the others
in a campaign of guerrilla operations. 
Come this way!
Go away!
Take it with you!
Let's take all the trash
and leftovers with us.
The leftovers!
Leave them behind!
Is something wrong, miss?
What's the trouble?
I have no face!
A goblin!
Jjjust now, I... I saw
A murder?
Nno, it was...
Not a murder? Too bad!
Thththere was a woman!
Did she have a mouth like a shark?
No! No! She was... I mean...
Then, was she something like this?
It's her!
Was... she... something... like... this?
The raccoons took endless delight
in frightening the humans. 
After every big success,
they held a celebration. 
But Gonta, the one who started it all, 
showed no signs of recovering
from his injuries. 
His loving wife Otama
cared for him tenderly, 
but she could not soothe his frustration
at being out of the fight. 
Frankly, Gonta thought
his raccoon friends were wimps. 
Yesterday's News Train was priceless. 
That special about
"Tama New Goblin Town."
They interviewed the cop we scared.
The other guests laughed in his face.
He was so furious! I almost died!
Idiot! So what?
Are they going to stop the project
just because of stuff like that?
If you're going to shapeshift,
do it the way I did!
Cause accidents, and kill them!
Oh, no!
Gonta!
It was just as Gonta said. 
The project didn't stop. 
Rivers were encased in concrete,
roads were laid out everywhere, 
masses of building material flowed in, 
and the construction of thousands of
apartments finally got under way. 
The strange happenings on the
construction sites and in the hills 
The strange happenings on the
construction sites and in the hills 
received nationwide coverage. 
The raccoons became more and more
confident of ultimate victory. 
Rock, paper, scissors...
Pom Poko Year 32, autumn. 
It was time to choose messengers
to travel to Sado and Shikoku islands, 
to seek the help of famous masters
in the art of shapeshifting. 
Tamasaburo of Oni Woods
was chosen to go to Shikoku. 
Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh
was chosen to travel to Sado. 
So at the next full moon, 
the two young raccoons
said farewell to their comrades 
and set out for their destinations
in high spirits. 
What a smell!
The raccoons continued
haunting the construction sites. 
They were having so much fun
with their shapeshifting, 
they almost didn't care
whether it was effective or not. 
Out with the demons!
Daddy!
Will this really
drive out the humans?
Won't they see through us
one of these days?
Maybe we should really go after them,
like Gonta says.
What does it matter
if one or two get killed?
"To be, or not to be,
that is the question."
Kiyo!
What are you doing up there?
Something wrong with your neck?
I was posing for you.
I was hoping you'd say I was pretty.
Oh, sorry.
Now there really is something wrong
with my neck.
You looked pretty.
It's too late.
I mean it.
It's OK.
I just need more practice.
One day a raccoon
from Potamochi Mountain... 
Everyone likes that song, don't they?
I kind of like it myself.
Do you know the song,
Where Are You From? 
Yes, but I can't sing all the lyrics.
That song used to be...
There was a raccoon from Senba
Along came a hunter... 
A hunter shot my grandpa.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
That's OK.
But Grandpa wasn't boiled or fried.
Someone paid a lot for his pelt.
I really like your fur too.
Why, that makes me happy.
Coming from you, that is.
So, what were you going to say
about that song?
My father used to sing it.
He was a good ballbouncer too.
He must have been a character.
Whenever he got to the end of the song,
he always warned us.
About what?
"You kids better remember:
Even in a simple ballbouncing song,
you hear about the cruel nature
of humans."
"How they hunt us raccoons, kill us
and eat us. And don't you forget it!"
Say, shall we bounce balls?
Are you good at it?
Yes, I'm pretty good.
Then I better do my best too!
Where are you from? Higo.
Where's Higo? 
In Kumamoto. Where's Kumamoto?
In Semba. 
There was a raccoon from Semba. 
Along came... 
Shokichi, when are you going to do that
"Operation Twin Star" you talked about?
Oh, I don't really
want to do it anymore.
But it was such a good plan.
Why don't we do it tonight?
Just the two of us.
With you?
Are you afraid
to do it with me?
No, it's not that. It's just...
Then let's try.
I'm sure it will go over really well.
OK, let's do it! With you as my partner,
I bet things will go great.
I can't wait!
Well, well,
what adorable little children!
We just got back from a trip
to the stars, but our home is gone.
A trip to the stars?
From redeyed Scorpio
to the Eagle's wings...
From the coils of the Snake
to the brow of the Bear Cub!
We sprinkle the dew and frost
as we fly among the stars.
What is this?!
Our home is gone! We're cold!
Mister, do you know
where our home went?
Your home?
I don't know what you mean.
Nobody knows! Run along now!
We should call the police.
Someone get the police here!
Hey, what are you kids doing?
They're not kids,
they're gremlins!
Gremlins?!
Little gremlins,
please don't be angry!
Now, just hold on a minute.
I'll treat you right! You want a raise?
Come on, give me a break!
Nope, I've had it. I'm going back home.
I can't stay in these haunted hills.
Come on, Suzuki.
I heard Tokyo was a scary place,
but this is too much for me.
You'd best stop the construction.
Whether it's gods or devils,
somebody or something
is really upset about this project.
The raccoons cheered. 
That evening's celebrations
were especially grand. 
Naturally, the guests of honor
were the two heroes, Kiyo and Shokichi. 
Meanwhile, the workers' quarters
were dark and silent. 
But the next morning... 
It seemed there was
an endless supply of humans. 
No matter how many
the raccoons scared away, 
there were always others
to take their place. 
It's rumored among local residents
that this may be
the work of foxes and raccoons.
That would make things simple enough.
All we'd have to do is
exterminate all the offending animals.
The raccoons monitoring the broadcast
were shocked. 
But these incidents
are right out of old folk tales. 
It's not surprising people think
foxes and raccoons are behind it. 
But that's precisely what proves
this is all just malicious rumors. 
What do you mean, rumors?!
I saw it with my own eyes! 
Oh, all right. 
In that case, we'll issue an
extermination order for these pests. 
As soon as you find
any more raccoons playing more tricks, 
let us know immediately. 
That is, if you can prove it! 
Shokichi was not the only one
who wondered 
whether shapeshifting was enough
to drive out the humans. 
As you all know, the Edo period
was a golden age for raccoons.
Raccoon shapeshifting was a frequent
subject for painters and writers.
But unfortunately,
we raccoons were too conspicuous.
We aroused the resentment of humans.
In the modern era,
we've been hunted for our pelts,
and our fur has been used
for paintbrushes and toothbrushes.
That's how the humans
took revenge for our excesses.
Don't any of you ever forget:
The past few decades
have been peaceful for us raccoons
only because we've exercised restraint
and not used shapeshifting too often.
Our talents are a twoedged sword.
I want all of you to use this technique
with discretion.
Otherwise, we'll invite further
retribution from the humans.
Oroku's speech dashed cold water
on the spirits of the young raccoons. 
And now autumn was upon them, 
the time of year when raccoons
need enough food to store ample fat 
and grow the long, fluffy coats
needed for the coming winter. 
The young raccoons focused their
attention and shapeshifting skills 
on getting food for the winter. 
One day, an exhausted raccoon
arrived in the Tama Hills. 
Don't worry, we're raccoons too!
Thank you very much.
You seem completely worn out.
Where did you come from?
From Fujino Woods.
Is that on Shikoku island?
Sado island?
Why, no.
It's just over the mountains from here.
Just over the mountains?
So you're not from Shikoku after all.
Oh, my, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.
No, it's just that we've been waiting
for someone from there.
So, what brought you here?
Now I finally know
where all that dirt is coming from,
the dirt that's ruining our woods!
According to this raccoon named Hayashi, 
a huge amount of excavated dirt was
being illegally dumped in Fujino Woods. 
The streams were polluted,
there were frequent landslides, 
and the raccoons and other animals
of the woods were in dire straits. 
To find out where all this
discarded earth was coming from, 
Hayashi assumed human form and caught
a ride on one of the dump trucks. 
Unfortunately, shapeshifting
was not one of his strong points. 
The swaying of the truck and the stress
of the journey made him fall asleep, 
and he changed back into a raccoon. 
It's not just Fujino Woods.
Other woods are being ruined too.
And now there are garbage dumps
and golf courses all over the place.
Our Tama Hills are leveled,
and we suffer.
Then the dirt is dumped in Fujino Woods,
and you suffer.
When will this insanity end?
And I was so astonished
at what I found here!
I thought the trucks came from
some site in the middle of Tokyo.
But we're in the hills here!
They dig up one hill
and dump it on another!
I just can't understand
why the humans are doing this.
So if we stop the construction,
it will help the raccoons
in Fujino Woods too, right?
What stirring words!
I beg you all to use
your skills in shapeshifting
to save our woods too!
Well, you see, it's not really
that simple, even for us.
Where could Bunta and Tamasaburo be?
They were supposed to go
and fetch the masters to help us.
There was no word from Shikoku or Sado. 
And so winter came to the Tama Hills. 
With the raccoons down for the winter, 
the haunting of Tama New Town
was forgotten, 
and media attention evaporated. 
The papers were filled with stories
of celebrity scandals 
and sordid political goings on. 
Sleet covers the garden
of Manpuku Temple 
The sleet's like ice cream! 
All our friends are here!
Pom poko pon pon, pon pon! 
New Year's Day, Pom Poko 33. 
The Tama Hills greeted the new year
covered with a rare blanket of snow. 
Most of the construction workers had
already returned to their hometowns 
and were enjoying the holidays
surrounded by their families. 
Push! Push! Push!
Our golden balls swing and swing 
Though there's not a breath of wind 
The baby raccoon sees our balls
And swings his too... 
We saw it! It really happened!
A bunch of raccoons pushed
that earth mover over the cliff!
We're not lying!
Police suspect the workers, who stayed
behind over the new year holidays, 
were inspired by the numerous pranks
that finally stopped last fall. 
However, snow around
the crime scene has melted, 
and it may be difficult
to gather evidence. 
I hope you know what you're doing,
Shokichi.
Oh, I think we'll be all right.
What a stupid prank.
Not at all.
Shokichi was trying to encourage
the raccoons who can't shapeshift
Shokichi was trying to encourage
the raccoons who can't shapeshift
by giving them a way to help.
What do you think, Osho?
Hmm, I don't see any great harm done.
It was just as Osho predicted. 
The three workers were released
for lack of evidence. 
Naturally, no one believed the raccoons
were responsible. 
The case remained unsolved. 
And so spring came. 
The season of love
had arrived once again 
The raccoons had been chaste
for more than a year, 
and were unable
to control themselves any longer. 
The air was filled with sweet nothings,
and the raccoons 
pursued and wooed each other
until the very skies turned rosy. 
Hanako! Wait!
Hanako!
You're walking much better!
Hanako! Wait just a minute!
Can't you catch me?
Everyone has spring fever.
I guess we're all
like the flowers and the trees.
When winter ends
and the sun shines down on us,
we can't help sending out shoots.
Then at last we blossom and bear fruit.
But we have to keep
our promise to Granny.
Let's stay chaste
until we've finally won this war.
Shokichi, you're so wonderful.
I'm so happy!
Our love will last forever!
Shokichi!
That was a mistake. 
Their love grew passionate, 
and later that year, four charming young
raccoons were born to Kiyo and Shokichi. 
Kincho Daimyo Shrine
Now the previous autumn, 
Tamasaburo had managed to reach
the island of Shikoku 
after many trials and hardships. 
He presented his request for help to
the master of shapeshifting, Kincho VI, 
but then he collapsed
and was very ill for many weeks. 
Luckily, Kincho had a daughter, Koharu,
who stayed by Tamasaburo's bedside 
and miraculously
nursed him back to health. 
With the coming of spring,
their bond deepened, 
and Koharu bore Tamasaburo three cubs. 
The island's elders held a council
in the inner chambers of the shrine. 
They all agreed that success
in stopping Tama New Town 
would be an important blow against
similar construction all over Japan. 
But the elders were divided
as to who to send, 
how affairs in Shikoku would be handled, 
and how to avoid any succession disputes
that might arise 
in case something should happen
to one of the participants. 
Hundreds of questions were raised,
but no conclusions were reached. 
It's such beautiful weather. But Father
and the others just talk, talk, talk.
They've been debating
for six months now.
When will they ever reach a decision?
Oh, I hope they never reach a decision!
Tamasaburo, just the thought
that you might someday return
to faroff Tama Hills
makes my heart ache with sadness.
Koharu... I too dream that
this happiness we have may never end.
Why must it be just a dream?
I'll ask Father.
I'll ask him to let you stay here
and be his successor.
While Tamasaburo was struggling
to make a decision, 
Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh roamed the
fields and mountains of Sado island, 
searching for a master of shapeshifting
called Danzaburo. 
Searching for a master of shapeshifting
called Danzaburo. 
But he found no one who knew anything
about the master's whereabouts. 
During the summer and fall of that year, 
the raccoons of Tama Hills
were beset by a series of misfortunes. 
Their woods continued to shrink
before the onslaught of development. 
And just when the baby boom of spring
had brought many new mouths to feed, 
poor summer weather
brought a serious food shortage. 
There were not nearly enough chestnuts
and persimmons to eat that fall. 
Those with shapeshifting skills
tried to help 
by gathering food meant for humans, 
but it was still not nearly enough
to feed the growing cubs. 
Finally, even raccoons
who could not shapeshift 
were forced to come out of the woods
and scavenge around human dwellings, 
looking for anything
to feed their children. 
Inevitably, some of them
began to lose their lives 
on the roads and in traps. 
I can't take any more!
The time has come for each of us
to take at least one human life,
even if we lose our own.
Are you sure you're all right now,
Gonta?
Of course! See? I'm in the pink!
This is wonderful.
When should we celebrate your recovery?
This isn't the time for parties, Granny.
I think we should wait for the masters
of shapeshifting to get here
before we decide our strategy.
You too, Shokichi?
You're too young to be such a coward.
You're wrong.
We can't underestimate the humans.
If we attack them head on,
they'll destroy us.
We've waited long enough!
Be patient. Let's hear Shokichi out.
I propose we adopt three policies
until the masters arrive.
Establish a system of distributing
food to raccoons who can't shapeshift.
In other words, a rationing system.
Thorough training
in traffic safety.
Formation of rescue squads
for raccoons caught in traps.
That's my proposal.
Shokichi, you're practically
like one of the humans.
No! I'm a raccoon, born and bred.
Well then, leaving the particulars
to later. All in favor?
Hands up!
In favor!
What is this nonsense, Gonta?
It's not nonsense! It's a coup d'etat! 
Anyone who opposes me from now on will
be killed by my private guard! Got it?
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.
That's "Sir Gon."
Raccoons!
We all know the humans are dangerous.
If we attack without concern for
our own safety, victory will be ours.
They can be killed. As the saying goes,
"a trapped mouse will beat the cat."
What's that supposed to mean?
He doesn't look like a mouse.
He means, we can win,
if we're desperate.
Exactly.
If a mouse is cornered,
he'll find the strength to beat the cat.
We're not mice, Gonta.
What's the point in beating a cat?
Come to think of it, it's been a while
since I had a nice mouse.
Mouse tempura can't be beat.
No, deep fried is the tastiest!
Are you sure? I think the tempura batter
really makes it.
That crispy deep fried tail!
What the hell are you talking about!?
What's important is
I love mouse tempura! Yes, I do!
See Gonta?
All we can think about is food.
I think we'd better wait for the masters
to get here.
My apologies.
I suppose it was too much
to expect the young raccoons to stay
chaste and not have babies.
No! Instead of fewer raccoons,
we need fewer humans!
The places they've infested
used to be our homes!
The humans are the intruders!
Drive them out!
The humans are the intruders!
Drive them out!
Kill them!
Drive them out! Kill them!
But at that very moment... 
Hey, taxi!
I'll tell everyone you're here!
Tamasaburo!
I've brought the masters from Shikoku!
Tamasaburo! You did it!
Friends, on our way here
we saw your devastated woods.
You have our deepest sympathy.
We'd like to address all raccoons
tonight. There's no time to lose.
Pompoko 33, autumn. 
All the raccoons assembled to welcome
the three masters from Shikoku. 
There's a good moon out tonight.
Fellow raccoons,
I am Tazaburo Hage of Yashima.
I am 999 years old.
Why is Honshu ravaged by development,
while Shikoku is almost untouched?
The reason is, we raccoons
protect our woods vigilantly.
The humans of Shikoku know
that disaster will befall them
if they anger us.
In fact, all three of us are worshipped
at every shrine and temple in Shikoku.
The humans revere us.
But I have not introduced myself.
I am Inugami Gyobu, supreme leader
of the raccoons of Matsuyama.
I am Kincho VI, direct descendant of the
first raccoon master of Kincho Shrine.
To frighten the humans of Tokyo
and drive them out,
we have resolved to carry out
Operation Goblin.
This operation will require
unprecedented powers
of mental concentration,
concentration so great that
the three of us may lose our lives.
But if you successfully
carry out this plan,
you will regain the humans' fear
and their respect without fail.
And then, you can use the humans'
fear and respect of raccoons
to put an end to this infernal
construction once and for all!
We have a full array of potent tricks.
We have brought you a boat,
oh raccoons,
that will ferry all of you
back to a lost era of greatness!
We promise you: All who come aboard will
reach those blessed shores without fail!
What a beautiful moon.
We raccoons love moonlit nights.
Let us pray to the moon
for the success of our enterprise.
Right, everybody?
The raccoons immediately embarked
on a special regimen of training. 
Congratulations on your
nine hundred and ninetyninth birthday!
Thank you everyone! Thank you!
Master, please reenact
the story of Yoichi the Archer,
as you witnessed it
in your younger days!
So I shall!
The time is ripe!
Cockadoodledoo!
Pom Poko 33, December. 
The day for Operation Goblin
arrived at last. 
Slightly cloudy, no wind. Thirteen
degrees centigrade, humidity 65% . 
Perfect conditions for goblins. 
Transformation into monsters and goblins
has always been a raccoon strong point. 
But now, they needed to draw
not only on their own latent energy, 
but also the hidden energy
of the cosmos: 
Fire, earth, water and air. 
The intensity of the training
undertaken by the raccoons 
under the tutelage
of the three elders of Shikoku 
is almost beyond description. 
All the raccoons,
even those who could not shape shift, 
worked together
to focus their combined power. 
That night, the fighting spirit
of the raccoons merged 
into one consuming flame. 
Their enthusiasm was so boundless,
they transformed themselves into goblins 
long before they even reached
the dwellings of the humans. 
Long before they even reached
the dwellings of the humans. 
Hey, look at that!
What is it?
Let the trees burst into full flower!
Let the trees burst into full flower!
Wow... it's a big parade of goblins!
I used to see stuff like that too,
way back when.
You know, foxes with lanterns,
that kind of thing.
You can really see them.
You can see the lanterns.
With little lights in them.
You can see them marching along.
I wonder why I could see them?
Maybe foxes can really do that.
I wonder.
You can really see them.
It must be your brain
playing tricks on you.
A fox wedding. Foxes with lanterns.
It's already in your head.
So, it's like...
Your brain plays tricks on you.
You can see them walking.
It's all in your head.
Yeah, you're right.
There's no way it's real.
People's brains are scary.
You think things,
and then you see them.
There's no way
they could be real, though.
They really are real!
It's just your brain
playing tricks on you.
Welcome home.
Sachiko!
Matter is void!
Form is emptiness!
Here they come again!
Master Gyobu!
Master Gyobu!
Master Gyobu!
That was amazing!
That was scary, wasn't it?
Aw, is that the end?
That was really cool!
Yes.
Come on, time for bed.
Oh, OK...
Don't forget to brush your teeth!
I feel like I just woke up from a dream.
Me too.
What was all that about, I wonder?
After that, flying saucers
would seem pretty tame.
There are some things
you just can't explain.
Long ago, when the Matsuyama
clan was at war,
Gyobu went over to the enemy,
causing the downfall of his clan.
He regretted this so deeply
that he made a solemn vow to devote the
rest of his life fighting for justice.
We must ensure his sacrifice
was not in vain,
emulate his noble spirit, and vow
not to rest until the day of victory!
Gyahte gyahte hara gyahte
A raccoon of Potamochi Mountain
Got drunk and transformed himself!
Great success to Operation Goblin!
The raccoons
were so convinced of victory, 
no one was checking
the television for news. 
Police and the media
are searching for anyone 
who might have videotaped
tonight's mysterious parade. 
But so far no one has come forward, 
complicating efforts
to determine what really happened. 
I'm sure I was taping the whole thing,
but there's nothing on the tape. 
It doesn't make any sense. 
The goblin slipped in
right through this opening. 
It was terrifying!
Nobody could have staged that. 
There really is something strange
about New Town after all. 
I'd like to move out,
but it's not easy. 
There will be a special program
at 12:20 a.m. 
With indepth coverage
of this evening's strange events. 
The more people investigate this,
the more they will be convinced
it was no hallucination,
that it all really happened!
Then, when they realize
their science and logic are powerless
to unlock the riddle
of what happened...
They'll be dumbfounded
by the awesome mystery of the cosmos,
and realize how insignificant
human existence really is.
Listen, everyone: Our good fortune
awaits, but let's not wait for it!
Come then!
Drink! Sing! Dance!
Let's hear it for Master Hage!
But the next day,
events took a totally unexpected turn. 
It appears that the massive parade
staged yesterday 
in a residential complex
of Tama New Town 
may have been
a publicity stunt for Wonderland, 
a theme park
now under construction in the area. 
Police have summoned PR executives
of Wonderland for questioning, 
on suspicion of having staged
a parade without a permit. 
You gotta be kidding!
However, residents of the complex
and the surrounding area 
remain convinced
that what they saw yesterday 
could not have been a publicity stunt. 
You can say that again!
The president of the company responsible
for Wonderland has admitted 
that the parade
was a promotional event. 
What?
President of Wonderland
At Emergency Press Conference
I deeply apologize for any inconvenience
caused by our parade yesterday. 
Who the hell is he?
We just wanted the world
to know how wonderful, ah, 
Wonderland will be. 
So we decided the best way was to go out
and give the public a free taste of the, 
ah, wonders they will soon
be able to experience at Wonderland. 
As president of Wonderland, 
I take full responsibility for the
staging of this unauthorized event. 
What a liar!
That's ridiculous!
Fortunately, 
we received
an overwhelmingly positive response 
to our parade. 
Frankly, we were astonished
at the enthusiasm we encountered. 
If this humble servant of the theme park
going public has to go to jail, 
the positive reaction we received
will make it all worthwhile. 
What in the world?!
Is this for real?
What in the world?!
Is this for real?
There's got to be some mistake here!
If this humble servant of the theme park
going public has to go to jail... 
That asshole!
This new development plunged
the raccoons into a state of panic. 
Meanwhile, Wonderland
was desperately searching for the people 
who staged the parade. 
It's too late!
Beat the bushes if you have to!
Just find out who did it
and hire them all!
Throw money at them!
I'll pay whatever they want!
It was the work of raccoons.
What's that? Raccoons?
I don't care if it was penguins! I want
them all working exclusively for me!
Raccoons? Wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, just a little joke.
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
Your assistant let me in.
I am Ryutaro.
We spoke on the phone earlier.
This affair is a bit delicate.
If you want to work
with the people who did this,
I'm probably the only one
who can deliver them to you.
Fine! I'll pay you 100 million yen.
The raccoons were dumbfounded. 
This bizarre human
had completely stolen their thunder. 
At first, they railed against
the unfairness of it all. 
But soon, the sheer hopelessness
of their situation 
began to sap their will to fight. 
Meanwhile,
with no footage of Operation Goblin, 
media coverage petered out 
and the public rapidly
lost interest in the whole affair. 
You're a fox!
Truly, you have a discerning eye.
I am Ryutaro, the shapeshifting fox,
at your service.
I am honored to meet you, master Kincho.
I have heard much about you.
I'm nothing more than the sixth
in a long line.
And what business brings you here?
I was astonished
by your fabulous parade.
At last, someone who understands!
How could I not?
And you have my deepest sympathies
for everything you've had to bear.
I see... At least someone understands
what we're going through.
And I was hardly surprised
by what happened after the parade.
What's that you say?
Ryutaro the shapeshifting fox
could charm the birds from the trees. 
He convinced Kincho to come to Ginza. 
He showed the raccoon into a private
room in one of Tokyo's swankiest clubs. 
Step right this way.
Not to worry! All my girls are foxes.
Do you like them this way?
Would foxes suit you better?
Or they can be raccoons, if you prefer.
I'll get right to the point.
There's no future
for the raccoons of Tama.
They'll die out,
just like the foxes.
So that's what happened
to the foxes of Tama.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
The few of us who could shapeshift
have to live like this now.
Among the humans?!
That's the only way to survive
in the big city.
And that's why I invited you here,
to recommend
that you raccoons do the same.
Now hold on a minute!
I know this must come as a shock,
but allow me to complete the picture.
It's not enough
to start over in the human world.
If you must swallow poison,
drink the whole cup.
The best move would be for you all
to go to work for Wonderland,
and solve your problem in one go.
You can't be serious! Work for
the people who made monkeys of us?
Let's think about this calmly.
It's time for you raccoons
to start living as humans.
That's a foregone conclusion.
It takes big money
to live like a human!
And how do you
make the money you need?
You use the skills you have!
And who's going to pay
the highest salary?
I'm afraid that would be your enemy,
Wonderland.
They tell me
they'll pay generous benefits too.
Here's the salary,
and these are the benefits.
Naturally, I'll be the only one
who knows you're raccoons.
Bon appétit.
Now then,
let's take our time and think this over.
Master Kincho,
you must be used to eating better
than the scraps you get in Tama.
I'm sure it's hard for you.
That's not important.
What I want to know is,
so the raccoons
who can shapeshift live as humans.
What about the ones who can't?
They'll have to fend for themselves.
The strongest genes must prevail
if the species is going to survive.
We foxes had to abandon the others,
but we had no choice.
And so... they died out.
Yes, they did.
It was the choice we had to make.
Ah, this is a tragedy!
Well, you know, you raccoons
are omnivorous. Not like us foxes.
Those who can't shapeshift
might not do so badly after all.
Meanwhile, the raccoons met once again, 
to consider what might be done to
improve their depressing situation. 
Only the core group came. 
"We have a full array of potent tricks."
A load of hot air!
We were idiots to think
those old geezers could help us.
Reminds me of the saying,
"Don't sell the pelt
till you catch the raccoon."
No, I don't think even Buddha
could have seen how this would turn out.
You shouldn't blame the masters.
The humans say people like the president
of Wonderland are "sly as a raccoon."
Humans are so weird.
Speak for yourself, Shokichi.
I just mean we need to do a lot more
research on the humans.
Shut up! It's time to challenge them
to a fight to the death!
Control yourself, Gonta.
It seems to me
our only choice is to reveal
that Operation Goblin
was really staged by us raccoons.
Have you lost your mind, Osho?
We can't reveal ourselves to the humans.
It's an ironclad rule.
She's right. If the humans knew
we did it, they'd hunt us all down.
But it's so frustrating!
Someone else
got the credit for all our work.
I just can't accept it.
I want to tell the world!
I want to shout it out!
"We did that!"
Master Osho, what could we do
to convince them it was us?
All we have to do
is take public credit for it.
Call the TV stations.
Send out letters.
They'd just think
it was somebody's idea of a joke.
Then one of us should go on TV
and demonstrate for them.
Nonsense.
The humans would just think it was
staged, and we'd be humiliated again.
You see? Talk is useless!
The debate dragged on through the night,
and into the next morning. 
You see? Talk is useless!
But if we become terrorists,
that will just incite
the humans to wipe us out!
I keep telling you! We do it without
them knowing it was us!
In that case, we can't do anything
really effective.
Instead of going off halfcocked
in different directions,
I think we should join forces for
another, even bigger Operation Goblin.
Where's the guarantee
things won't turn out the same?
All we have to do
is get together like before.
Ha! You're just playing around
in the sandbox.
You're like a stinking girl!
Watch your tongue, Gonta.
That's no way to talk about women.
OK, but if he WAS a stinking girl,
that's what he'd be like!
Anyway, I'm going to start getting ready
for Operation Goblin part two.
Yeah? You and who else?
Do you think anyone'll follow you?
What was that?!
Moron!
Knock it off!
Listen everyone!
There's only one way out of this.
We have to use our shapeshifting skills
the way we did for Operation Goblin!
You know what kind of impact Operation
Goblin had on the humans.
But everyone thinks that idiot president
of Wonderland was responsible.
So what can we do?
How would you stand this egg on end?
This is how Columbus did it.
Very impressive!
You must have a really
brilliant solution.
It's time for us
to begin living as humans!
No way!
No, I'm absolutely serious.
This is not a joke.
But what about the ones
who can't shapeshift?
Where's Osho?
Appeal From 808 Raccons
With Osho gone, 
the raccoons could not agree
whether or not to follow Kincho's plan. 
Their unity began to unravel. 
Operation Goblin took precedence over
important matters like food gathering. 
Most of the raccoons turned to survival,
but Gonta began gathering followers. 
Meanwhile, age seemed to have addled
Master Hage's brain. 
He gathered the raccoons
who could not shapeshift, 
and initiated them
into a Buddhist dancing cult. 
This world is an abyss, a mud boat!
Invoke the name of Amida and dance!
Namu Amida Butsu,
this is the end for us
Paradise will be our boat
Master Hage
was always so hale and lucid.
What an awful place Tokyo is!
If Operation Goblin
had taken place in Shikoku,
the humans would have known
it was us raccoons.
Offerings to us at shrines and temples
would have increased ten times.
Master Kincho!
Master Kincho, my fervent desire
is to accompany you back to Matsushima
and devote myself to training.
Is that so, Tamasaburo?
Yes.
You're prepared to become my successor?
Yes, Master Kincho.
I've been waiting for those words!
But you're not
selfishly abandoning your fellows
to get back to Koharu, are you?
Of course, Master Kincho. Only...
Only what?
Even Master Kincho has lost the support
of the other raccoons.
What purpose would it serve
to stay here in any case?
I think there's something
we can do about that.
Wow, this is
quite an amazing restaurant!
The owner has spared no expense
to make your visit a pleasant one.
This place is really something!
Good grief, it's better than Disneyland!
And so Master Kincho
not only got his revenge on Wonderland, 
he obtained a massive war chest
for the raccoons. 
The president of Wonderland
rushed to the police 
to report the theft of 100 million yen
by a pack of raccoons. 
But no one would listen to him. 
Meanwhile, Gonta and his crew
of hardliners were taking steps 
to stop further clearing of the forest. 
Nature preservationists! 
Please stop interfering with our snake
extermination, and leave immediately! 
You will be subject to prosecution! 
If you do not immediately
heed this warning and leave, 
we will use force to remove you! 
But Gonta and his army
ignored the warning. 
They pinned the police,
hunters and workers to the road 
and kept them from advancing an inch. 
And so both sides
continued the faceoff as night fell. 
What?! If Gonta insists on doing this,
we ought to be standing with him!
Can't you hear? The riot police
are already here. It's too late.
I'm going to take a look!
Shokichi! They'll get you too!
I'm going with him!
Ready, men?
Right!
Even if we should fall
in the heat of battle,
our deaths are certain to redouble
our brothers' resolve to carry on,
till the day of victory dawns!
Our raccoon balls swing in the wind
Back and forth, back and forth
Amen
Special ops!
Move aside!
Gonta, wait!
Move out!
Gonta.
The raccoons used their family jewels as
weapons in a desperate kamikaze attack. 
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon.
Meanwhile,
in another part of the Tama Hills, 
a reporter was trying
to interview the raccoons. 
Mr. Raccoon, please come out.
Any form you want to take is fine.
The staff of World TeleReporter
is on your side!
It looks like
they're not so eager to come out.
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon,
why don't we talk?
We've got nothing to eat!
They answered!
It's true after all!
We'd like to hear
more about this from you.
Won't you please come out?
Oh! There they are!
It's the raccoons! It's them!
Are you raccoons really
responsible for the goblin parade?
That's right!
Please change into something
for our viewers.
Otherwise no one will believe us.
Some of us can't shapeshift.
So if the woods are all gone,
we'll have nowhere to live!
Raccoons, please listen!
If you don't come out, this broadcast
will look like a cheap putup job!
If you want people to believe you,
you'll have to show yourselves.
Osho!
Please go tell the humans everything!
He came out! He came out!
A ceramic raccoon
is walking toward me!
Mr. Raccoon,
a word for our viewers!
We... we...
Yes?
Go ahead!
Granny Oroku!
It was us! We made that parade!
These woods are our home!
Please don't destroy them!
We speak for every animal in the forest!
The person I saw yesterday
is gone today
The person I see today
will be gone tomorrow
Who knows
what will happen to us tomorrow?
Today everyone is sad
Master Tazaburo Hage, last surviving
witness of the battle of Yashima, 
was 999 years old. 
But now he had seen enough, and he
decided to bid the world farewell. 
With a song of triumph, the raccoons
stretched his vast testicles 
into a fabulous treasure ship,
with fittings of lacquer and gold. 
Singing and dancing,
they boarded the ship, 
in anticipation of leaving the world
of suffering for the shores of bliss. 
The ordinary raccoons imagined paradise 
and boarded
as if they were going on an outing. 
The treasure ship set off down the
Tama River, swaying in the moonlight. 
The current bore the ship downstream,
the sail stood proudly in the breeze. 
The boat was full,
the sail was flying high. 
Now the tide helped them forward as the
moon glinted off the water. 
The raccoons drummed their bellies
as the ship sailed away, 
drumming and drumming
on this night of dreams. 
They celebrated with bells,
samisen, flutes and drums. 
The ship was laden with gold,
silver and precious coral. 
With tears in their eyes, 
the raccoons watching from shore
prayed this would be no mud boat. 
As in a dream, the ship sailed on
past mistshrouded woods and fields. 
The raccoons strained to catch a glimpse
of Amida beckoning from paradise. 
The treasure ship
crossed over to the next world. 
Singing and dancing, the raccoons
crossed over to the next world. 
With bells and flutes,
they crossed over to the next world. 
With samisen and drums,
they crossed over to the next world. 
They crossed over to the next world,
and they never returned. 
You can't beat the humans after all!
You can't beat the humans after all!
Bunta, it's you!
Bunta! Bunta!
Tamasaburo!
Bunta!
You've finally returned!
Sasuke! Shokichi!
Did you find Master Danzaburo?
Did you reach Sado and see the master?
I learned at last
that he was shot by a hunter years ago,
after the war, when food was scarce.
How sad.
I was looking forward to meeting him.
You did well, Bunta.
But what's happened here, in only
three years? I feel like Urashima Taro.
We did everything we could to stop it.
But everything has changed
beyond belief!
The land has shape shifted,
not us raccoons.
We understand how you must feel.
Did the humans really do all this?
Yes, they did. They did it all.
No, it can't be! Only raccoons
can change things like this.
We're the only ones!
The humans were really raccoons
after all!
Old, stinking raccoons!
Give us back our woods! Give us back
our fields! Give us back our homes!
Shall we give it one more try?
Let's use the power we have left to put
everything back the way it was.
We'll see who's better at shape
shifting. The raccoons or the humans.
Sounds like fun! I can remember every
detail of the way things used to be.
All right, then.
One last guerilla attack!
But what's the point?
It's already too late.
Oh, it'll cheer us up.
That's all that matters.
It's this playful spirit
that keeps us raccoons, after all.
Master Kincho, will you help us?
Of course, though it may turn out
a bit like Shikoku.
Ponkichi!
Here I am! Shall I round up the others?
Will you lend us your energy
one more time?
You can rely on me!
Wait up for me!
Why, that's Mother!
And Yotchan! It's Yotchan!
Yotchan!
That's us!
That's us when we were children!
Look, raccoons!
Wow! They're cute!
Those are raccoons, right?
I'm surprised to see them here,
so close to the city.
Hey, raccoons! Don't go!
Aw, they're gone.
It would've been fun to feed them.
I wonder if they can really change
themselves like in the stories?
So in the end,
we were defeated after all. 
Tama New Town kept growing
without the slightest hindrance from us. 
As the years passed, the city settled in 
and became a pretty nice place
for people to live. 
The hill where Manpuku Temple stood
is a trendy residential district. 
And I think our shapeshifting 
did have a good influence on the humans. 
As it said in the papers, they're
concerned about preserving nature, 
and they're setting aside
little bits of the woods for parks, 
"to live in harmony with the raccoons." 
But the parks were too late for us. 
They're too small for raccoons, anyway. 
Some of us moved further from the city,
where there were still woods and fields. 
But of course
there were raccoons there already, 
and with construction and the cars
that took one of us from time to time, 
life was hard. 
So we took the final step. 
That's right, 
those of us who could shapeshift
took a leaf from the foxes' book, 
and started living like humans. 
Nowadays I have a desk job
and my wife, Kiyo, works at a bar. 
A few raccoons got into
the real estate business and made a pile 
selling forests to developers.
They're no different from the humans. 
Most of us are just worn out
from the stress of living in the city, 
and wish we could go back to the woods. 
I'm impressed by the humans. It takes
stamina to live the way they do. 
Some of us dropped out of the rat race 
and are scrounging out a living
on the streets. 
Oh, and what about Ponkichi
and the others who couldn't shapeshift? 
"Living for the moment"
is an expression made for raccoons. 
We never let property development
or accidents on the road get us down. 
We live as we please, relaxed
and joyous, in the present moment. 
We have children,
and we die, all too quickly. 
Ponkichi!
Ponkichi!
Shokichi!
You came!
How long has it been?
You often hear on the news
how foxes and raccoons are disappearing
because of urban development, right?
I wish you humans
would stop saying that.
Sure, some foxes and raccoons
can shapeshift.
But unfortunately,
most of us who can't just disappear.
What about the rest of the animals?
