Hello.
Hot, isn't it?
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag for just milk!
They put it in one.
Just say no. Pour me some too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please, I'll come there.
Thanks. The word processor open?
I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You could've gone to your aunt's too.
No. Oneechan wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy
going to a bar code system.
I like the book cards better.
Me too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right
or my professor will complain.
Amasawa Seiji
This guy...
You can read,
but don't stay up too late.
Yeah. Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before.
Here too.
Amasawa Seiji
He's taken all
these books out before me.
Amasawa Seiji. What's he like?
Is he goodlooking?
Shizuku! Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
Bye!
Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse!
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny.
Try by the phone...
Found it!
Just where you left it...
I'm late! Lock the door!
Silly!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
Is it ever hot!
Yahoo! How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi! Try your best!
Kosakasensei, are you there?
Tsukishima? What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts.
Don't forget, you've got high school
entrance exams.
Hurry it up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your card and the book card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare. They don't even have it
at the public library.
Donated
"Amasawa." Sensei!
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun,
I get more freckles!
SSorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Sensei!
Yeah, yeah.
OK, out of here, both of you.
Move up! Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
White clouds spreading up over a hill 
A road winds up to the town 
An old house with small windows 
An old dog waits for me to come home 
Country road leading far away 
The road to my old hometown 
West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain 
My good old hometown 
That's not bad.
Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
Concrete roads, everywhere 
Cut down all the trees
Filled in the valleys 
Western Tokyo 
Tama Mountain 
My hometown is concrete roads 
What is this?!
But what's this problem?
You don't need the lyrics yet.
No. Are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for entrance exams
would be easier having someone.
We could encourage each other.
Yuko! You're in love!
You got a love letter?!
Shh!
When? Who? Is he handsome?
He's in another class. He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me! Confess!
It's Su... Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm firststring,
and we're through to the regionals!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry. He's too dense.
But what about the love letter?
I'll think about it awhile.
I see.
At least your parents
aren't always after you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
Oh, no!
What?
I forgot my book! I'll go back.
I'll ride you.
No. You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card.
I'd forget about Concrete Road, though. 
You read it!
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!
Jerk!
"I'd forget about Concrete Road." 
Get lost!
I'm home.
Oneechan? You're back already?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone
who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little.
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
What's this, Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm getting to it!
Mom's busy! We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Aunt says come see her
when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just
because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me
to bring home soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku! Get up
and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away
and bring Dad's lunch to him.
Me?!
Why not? You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath
and the balcony and go to the coop?
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
MAIL!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
Hey, cat, are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey! Answer me!
I get off here. What about you?
See you.
Hey! A cat!
The library's that way!
And it felt just like
the start of a story.
There he is!
No Entrance
What a hill! How far up is he going?
Cat?
Cat?
Does he live around here?
Hey, cat! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was
a place like this way up here.
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me too.
I never guessed there was
a store like this up here either.
Beautiful doll!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello.
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
The Baron gets bored.
Is this doll the Baron?
Yep. Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name.
Sorry.
Thanks. I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out. Look.
It's beautiful. What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So, you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, are you?
Watch the face... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.
Only while the clock is striking 12
she is changed back from a sheep.
But he appears every hour
and waits for her.
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad.
This clock's fast, isn't it?
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library! Goodbye.
Can I come back sometime?
Sure, but go left
to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Tsukishima Shizuku!
Isn't this yours?
Forgetful, aren't you.
Thanks, but how?
Guess!
The cat. Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
Concrete roads, everywhere... 
It's not mine! Hey!
Oh, here you are.
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said
buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it? What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will? Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow! Amasawa's read this one too!
What's he like?
No! He's not you!
Shizuku! Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying
because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry! We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah? Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up. Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Let's go see Kosakasensei.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
Tsukishima!
What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice.
Everything I studied was on it!
So, you're not just a baseball goof.
Yuko's good at guessing too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
Hey, Sugimura!
What?
Come on!
Stop fixing me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
Excuse me.
A library book donor?
Gee, I don't know.
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
That's Dr. Amasawa.
I've read it. It's a good book!
Yes, very. What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Kimurasensei, do you remember
that Dr. Amasawa's given name?
Dr. Amasawa? It was Koichi, Amasawa Koichi.
Amasawa Koichi.
His youngest son's in your year,
Tsukishima. You don't know him?
He is?!
Umm... Thank you very much!
Goodbye!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's with you?!
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me! Of all the nerve!
Who is he? Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
I've been carrying her lunch all over.
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince
from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko,
you heard his name. Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast.
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...
Right, Shizuku?
Dunno...
But it's like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't.
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyric?
You finished?!
Let's see!
Oh, Shizukusama! Oh, great poet!
We will not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old hometowns,
so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
Country road, this old road 
If I go right to the end 
Got a feeling it'll take me 
To that town, country road 
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it at the teachers' thank you!
There too?!
Slow down!
I like this part.
"I left because I was alone
and I had nothing.
Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong..."
Ladies, the bell.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow.
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
Later.
Byebye.
Harada.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone.
Maybe someone bought him.
World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.
Nishi Shiro. Maybe
that jerk's name is Nishi too.
Shizuku! Shizuku!
Yukochan's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What? I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
Bye.
Where are you going?
Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What's with this face?
What am I going to do?!
The guy who wrote the letter
got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Huh? That's bad.
Why you, of all people?!
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him.
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow
looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
I see.
Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
I see. Say hello to her.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada...
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, "Why you, of all people,"
didn't she?
Yeah. A guy on the
baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!
Don't you understand?!
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?! No way! I don't need this!
You don't? How do you think Yuko
feels? She stayed home sick today!
But... I like you!
What?
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me! You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend.
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see.
I'm the one who's dense.
Miss, the parcel delivery left this with me.
Thank you again.
You don't have to do this.
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home.
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out too?
Do you live here? Are you hungry?
You're not very nice. Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet.
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.
There's always someone inside me
saying, "Things aren't that easy."
I'm not very nice.
Hey! Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard him being called Ball at one place.
I'm sure there's others.
So he does the rounds.
Yes! He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here. I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's halfdevil...
Um...
Would you?
Is your grandfather all right?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat doll?
You want to see it? Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places. This is great.
This is the time it looks best. In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was here being fixed.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years. He finished it
the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the light goes.
"angel's room." 
The artisan accidentally
scratched it with a cloth.
It's beautiful.
The Baron won't go. He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird. I feel
as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you.
You look sad today, somehow.
Had enough?
Yeah. Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that? By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed
in 300 years.
The sound comes
from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violinmaking class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow! You made this? It's like magic!
How can you talk like that
with a straight face?
Why? It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, OK? Please!
Listen...
Please, please, please!
You have to sing too.
Me? I'm tonedeaf!
Perfect!
Sing. You know this song.
Had a dream of living on my own 
With no fear of being all alone 
Pushed my sadness down inside of me 
And pretended
I was strong as I could be 
Country road, this old road 
If you go right to the end 
Got a feeling it'll take me 
To that town, country road 
It doesn't matter to me
how sad I might be 
I will never ever let
a tear show in my eye 
If my feet are moving faster
that's because I only want to 
Push away memories 
Country road, this old road 
Could go right to my hometown 
I won't go there, I can't go there 
Can't go down that country road 
Country road, when tomorrow comes 
I'll be like I always am 
Want to go back there
Can't go back there 
Fare thee well 
Country road 
That was fun!
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there
when he fixed the clock.
Seijikun has some pretty friends.
Seiji? Are you Amasawa Seiji?
Yeah. Didn't I tell you my name?
No! It says Nishi outside.
That's Grandpa's name. I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no! First I was buried alive,
and now the sky's fallen in!
What difference does it make
what my name is?
A lot! You've been calling me
by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Amasawa Seiji...
What?
...was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun. They're nice people.
Come back. They'll like that.
Just to listen. Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
There's lots as good as me.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah. You're good at that.
There's a school for it
in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great
to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know
if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far. See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine,
but I liked Concrete Roads too. 
You told me to forget that!
Did I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything. Good night.
Don't fall asleep
with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm at university finding that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled,
so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
Hour 1: Spare Period
Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better fast!
I hear you were out
with a boy last night.
Who told you that?!
A little bird who said
you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada, I'll tell my friend
the answer's no. Sorry.
I'm sorry too.
That's OK.
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be
on the midterm, so remember it!
That's all!
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa? What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima? Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima! You've got a visitor!
A male!
There she is.
Seijikun?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
Where are we going?
The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk
with all those people around.
Sorry. I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there
for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.
Also if I have the patience
to stick it out.
Otherwise I go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving
an escape route...
...but it's a good chance.
When do you go?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.
Soon then.
Great! Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
Um...
Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah.
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow.
What's Cremona like? I hope it's nice.
It's an old town,
with lots of violin makers.
It's great. You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go
to the same high school.
What a stupid thing to think.
I saw your name on the library cards
a long time ago.
We passed each other in the library.
I even sat beside you there.
I read all kinds of books so my name
would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
Run!
Here.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
Did I make you skip cram school?
It's OK.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizukuchan.
Hello.
Welcome back.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate,
he goes again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate
brought you together! Cool!
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books,
except one's going forward
while the other stays behind.
Yeah.
Kinuchan was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know,
but goodlooking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why? He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!
Now I'm not so sure.
I don't get it. I'd write every
day. We'd encourage each other.
You can't say "Go for it"
to someone more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love
without your future planned out?
You have talent.
All the juniors liked
your translation of Country Roads. 
You can express yourself too,
unlike me.
"There's lots as good as me."
That's what he said.
He's going to find out
if he has talent. Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time.
I don't care. Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
You going?
Yeah.
Good night.
Tell your mother hello.
You go for it too.
Sugimura will realize. Bye.
Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom! Muta's gone again!
Muta!
Muta...
'Whisper of the Heart': Listen
to the voice of the woods...
The Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seijikun says
the doll is a treasure of yours.
You didn't have to ask.
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person
to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to? I don't know
if I can write it or not.
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called mica slate.
Look at the seam.
Like that.
It's beautiful!
It's called beryl.
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald? The jewel?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins
or writing stories is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up
most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that,
but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone
deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry. Old people like to preach.
I'm scared. What if there
isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you. I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone... lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together
in search of the treasure
of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear. Space is deformed
on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large,
nearby things look small.
Fly! We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste! The planetoids converge!
Good! We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
When the air currents mingle in the
afternoon, you can touch the stars!
Huh?
That's rare.
Shizuku looking at nonfiction...
He's making a violin in his cell.
Seijikun!
I thought you'd gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
Glad I met you before. I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's OK. I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport,
but I'll wait for you.
Yeah. It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
I and Luisa, my betrothed,
were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived, 
and in the veins of its artisans
flowed the blood of sorcerers. 
It was a poor doll maker's
apprentice who fashioned us, 
but Luisa and I were happy 
because he had made us
so we could love others. 
But then... 
Shizuku! Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on? Tsukishima!
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Pay attention! This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
You were up until four again?!
It's OK. I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time.
Like just now...
I was thinking. I've got
to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
Shizuku? So, you are home.
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku! Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Sorry to trouble you.
This way.
Is anyone in the guidance office?
Please.
I'm home!
Welcome back.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one
at a cram school. I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out
too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will? Great!
Money's tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working,
but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.
Thanks.
You helped enough just
with sorting out data.
And Shizuku can concentrate
in her own room. She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me. Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred places!
She's at her desk all the time.
What's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you
with marks like this?!
I'm not going to high school!
Not going to high school? Use your head! What can you do
with a middle school education?
I can decide my own future!
Don't get too cocky!
Face the facts! The school makes
its report on you after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You don't study!
You just work parttime!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that.
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what? Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.
But Dad, listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here
and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?
I never said I wouldn't care about my marks!
You just said you
weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho, can Shizuku
and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Yes.
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku.
Is what you're doing now
more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something
you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm testing myself.
I have to.
Testing yourself? How?
How will we know if you don't say?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Dear!
Oh, sorry. Just one moment.
Whatever you're doing at the library,
I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that if anyone does...
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy
when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah. We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku.
I know what Dad said, but what
he really wants is for you to study.
I know. It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep. So, smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only one is real.
Which is the real one?!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa, you've finally come,
but I've grown so old.
Shizukusan.
Come in. I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
You promised you'd be
the first to read it.
It's a novel!
Whisper of the Heart
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it.
Shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding.
I see. I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire. It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's OK. I'm not cold at all.
Of course, but...
You're asleep here?
Shizukusan, I'm finished.
Thank you. It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished,
just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone
you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard. You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here. Come inside.
Now...
Now that I've written it I know.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more,
but Seijikun's getting
further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself
to write, and I was so scared.
You like Seiji, do you?
How is it?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin,
we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found the Baron in a coffee shop when you were a student in Germany...
Yes, yes.
He looked so melancholic.
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
The Baron had a lover,
and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back
from being repaired
at the doll maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes, quite the coincidence.
I had to come home,
so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine
said when the other doll
came back, she would take it 
and bring the two dolls together. 
So the owner gave in. 
So I ended up leaving Germany
with just the Baron. 
I promised her I'd come back,
and asked her to keep the other doll. 
The day the dolls met again 
would be the day we did. 
But then the war started,
and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back,
I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her
or the Baron's lover.
She must have been
very important to you.
Your story brought the Baron
out of my memory
and back to life.
Oh, yes.
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Where's Dad?
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?
Sorry I worried you. Today I return
to studying for my entrance exams.
So, your trials are over?
For now.
Did you eat? There's curry.
I'm fine!
"For now."
Shizuku, the bath's open.
Ah, a soldier at ease.
No way!
Wait there!
It's a miracle! You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier plane. Hop on.
Wait, you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time! Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head.
"Shizuku!"
And then you appeared!
What a team we are!
Me too. It's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get off?
It's OK.
I made up my mind
I was going to ride you up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be of use!
OK! Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku! Jump on!
We made it!
I'll hold the coat.
It's OK.
Here...
Wow! In the mist it looks
just like the sea!
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help.
I was just thinking of myself.
No, you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard
and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku.
I can't say how soon it'll be, but...
...would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker
and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah? Great!
Wait, it's cold.
Shizuku, I love you!
