Yeah?
Porco Rosso!
The Mamma Aiutos are on the move. 
The Mamma Aiutos?
I don't work cheap, you know.
They're after a mine's payroll
out of Venice. 
Is that all?
Uh, no... 
There's a school tour group aboard. 
That'll cost you.
We'll pay top dollar. 
And a bonus too.
Stop!
Stop or we sink you.
Wow, pirates!
Not just pirates. Air pirates!
Time for an overhaul.
Are you bad guys?
Yep.
And we're hostages?
Right.
Are you air pirates?
Smart girl.
A skull!
And very welldrawn.
Hurry, come over here!
Come on, hurry up!
There's 15 of them. Do we take them all?
We can't leave anyone out.
Too late!
They took the girls and the money.
Bring them back!
They went that way.
No, not that way!
I know what those cheapskates are up to.
They'll change course for the nearest
island as soon as they're out of sight.
They can't waste gas.
Uhoh.
Come on!
I don't have much time.
Gotcha!
What, it's just a tour group.
Hey, it's a pig. A pig!
Hey, piggy! He's so cute!
Be careful or the pirates will get you.
He's so cool!
Will you all shut up?
We're flying!
Let me see!
Hey, cut that out!
Be quiet, will you?
Do something!
You're the one who said to bring them all.
Just for a second.
I'm not supposed to let you.
It's beautiful. Hey, look!
A red plane!
Where? Where?
We saw it, didn't we?
Yeah.
That's as far as you go.
Here he comes!
It's Porco!
I can't see!
Oh, no!
It stopped.
We'll crash!
No, we've got another engine.
What are you doing? Shoot him down!
That red plane's tough.
Missed!
You're in my way.
Message from the pig.
"You're beat. Do what I say."
Shut up!
He's coming. Get down!
Where did he go?
He's hiding.
We crashed. We're going to sink!
No we won't. This is a seaplane.
Oh no!
We're sinking.
Hey, stop that!
We're not sinking!
Halt! You're hostages.
Don't worry. We're on the swim team.
That's not the point!
Me too!
Another message.
"You can keep half the money.
Give me the rest and the kids."
Or I'll kill you all.
That's it.
Half the money?
Shut up! Come on, you swine.
It's you and me!
Eat lead!
It jammed!
We surrender!
We surrender!
Byebye!
Farewell!
He left us money for repairs.
Don't be such a sap.
Be quiet, will you?
Don't pull on that, you'll break it.
Stay away from the propeller.
Got to pee? Do it over there.
PORCO ROSSO SINGS HIS VICTORY SONG
ONCE AGAIN
So the Mamma Aiutos can't come tonight.
And that filthy pig
of a bounty hunter is a hero.
But this young kid's an American, right?
The air pirates of the Adriatic,
asking a Yankee for help!
His grandmother was part Italian.
And he'll finish Porco for us.
But ten percent is outrageous.
Beautiful.
He's here.
With his snout in the air, as always.
Mr. Porco Rosso? I'm from The Neptune. 
We hear you put
the Mamma Aiutos out of action.
Do you think that will affect
this year's bounties?
Hey, put me down!
Listen to the music.
She's quite a woman.
Even American pilots know
Madame Gina of the Hotel Adriano.
That's why we all leave
our quarrels outside.
Is that your Curtiss out front?
The Rattlesnake.
Winner of fame and fortune.
You took the Schneider Cup
two years running.
She's unbeatable in a dogfight, too.
But I hear there's this Porco Rosso
who's pretty famous, too.
Better watch your back
with those pirates, kid.
They're poor, cheap, and dirty.
They could use a bath.
That's true.
Who you calling dirty, pig?
Quite a distinguished gathering!
You boys must be planning something.
As usual.
Always glad to see you,
but no war games here, okay?
We know, Gina. We never work
within 50 kilometers of here.
We're even nice to the pig.
That's my boys.
See you again.
Porco, tell us a war story.
Next time we're alone.
That American is so funny.
He took one look and said marry me.
I told him I'd lost
three pilot husbands already.
One in combat, one in the Atlantic.
The third died in Asia.
They found him?
I got a call today.
They found the wreckage in Bengal.
I waited three years.
I've got no tears left.
The good guys always get killed.
To comrades.
Thanks, Marco. You're always here for me.
You're the only one left
from the old days.
One thing I don't like about this place...
is that picture.
Don't touch it. It's the only one
of you when you were human.
I wish I could release you
from that spell.
That Yank knows how to fly.
Must be nice to make that much money.
This month's payment.
That pays off your loan.
How about helping the people out
with a Patriot Bond?
Do I look like a person?
All ready for you, Mr. Porco Rosso.
I'll take some ammo too.
Okay.
The streets are packed.
Yeah? Maybe the government
is going to change again.
They'll pass a law against you guys.
Laws don't apply to pigs.
That's for sure. Or moles like me.
Just regular ammo?
No highexplosive or armorpiercing?
We're not fighting a war out there, kid.
See you.
Thank you!
Hey, Boss. How is war
different from bounty hunting?
War profiteers are villains.
Bounty hunters are just stupid.
We're air pirates.
We don't borrow from banks.
What else can we do?
These repairs were expensive.
Pirate Federation planes!
Why do we have to fly
with that bunch of losers?
It's all the pig's fault.
Can't those Mamma Aiutos
even afford paint?
That is so shabby.
It looks like everyone's here.
Hey, is the American here yet?
He's up in the sun.
Right where he should be.
Sighted target: The Mediterranean Queen. 
We're taking a ship that big?
That's why we all got together.
Having engine trouble. Go first.
We'll cover you.
That's a dirty trick! We follow the plan.
Then we share repair costs!
You gutless wonder! We pay
our own repairs, just like always.
Even if we get bombed?
Engine trouble! Engine trouble!
We settled all this before!
You're so stingy!
I'm leaving!
Engine trouble!
All of you, shut up!
Attention! We are under attack
by air pirates. 
There is no need for alarm. 
We carry two advanced fighter aircraft. 
We will now introduce our pilots. 
The Black Stallion, Signor Valleta. 
And the Wolf of the Tiber,
Signor Visconti. 
They brought muscle!
That wasn't in the deal!
Aw, what a mess.
Get away from me, Curtis!
All right, let's go!
That's not good.
Guess I have to go to Milan.
Both pilots were shot down,
but parachuted to safety. 
The Pirate Federation looted
the vessel and left this message. 
You're next!
Come and get us, pig!
We repeat...
You're next. Come and get us, pig. 
About this incident... 
Way to go, turkeys.
I'm afraid I'm on vacation.
White sheets, beautiful women.
Just get me to Milan, little engine.
I don't like this weather.
I'll have to fly low.
Come on, you can do it!
That's right. Good girl!
Pig!
It's one on one!
Not now!
I'll tell everyone you ran.
Catch you later, Yank!
Damn, lost my cover.
Uhoh.
Gotcha!
No you didn't. My engine quit.
Yes! Now I'll be famous too. Yahoo!
I can't go back emptyhanded.
They won't believe me without proof.
There!
That stupid red color. No mistake.
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama.
Please hurry.
Madame Gina!
There's a phone call.
He's safe. He's alive.
What?
Use the phone at the front desk.
Marco? Are you all right?
I was just leaving to look for you.
Oh? Good!
I've lost weight.
Two nights on a deserted island. 
I'm taking the plane to Milan for repairs.
If the Yank comes in,
tell him I'll see him again. 
Hey! I'm not a messenger. 
I worry about you pilots,
but you treat me like furniture.
Marco, you'll end up roasted.
I won't go to your funeral.
A pig's gotta fly.
Idiot! 
THE RED WINGS HAVE BEEN BROKEN
DEAD OR ALIVE?
I figured you'd show up tonight.
I need your help.
Looks pretty bad.
Why not just get a new plane?
I like this one.
I know how you feel.
Look out. I'll back her in.
Who's the cutie?
My granddaughter, back from the States.
Keep coming, keep coming.
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!
It's got great lines.
They don't make them like that anymore.
I can't see it.
She's really your granddaughter?
Hands off.
Fio, lock up.
Okay.
I'm going up against Curtis.
I need another 15 knots.
Curtis? I hadn't heard
that name for a while.
Well?
Where did you get a Folgore?
Don't ask.
The plane Curtis beat in 1927
for the Schneider Cup had this engine.
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.
I can hardly wait.
Don't overtune her. It's not a race.
Tell me about it!
You're preaching to the converted.
You're cleaning me out.
These days money's not worth
the paper it's printed on.
Empty your pockets.
That's for the propeller, the paint...
That's for hotel and meals!
Stay here. I'll put you up cheap.
Where are your sons? Are they good?
They left to find work.
So who'll do the design?
Fio.
Fio? That little girl?
She's young, but she's got
something my sons don't.
I've known you a long time,
but I think I'll try somewhere else.
Wait!
It is because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?
Both, actually.
Well, I can understand that.
Tell me, what's the main thing
a good pilot needs?
Experience?
No. Inspiration.
I'm glad you didn't say experience.
Grandpa says you were very young
when you first soloed.
You were good from the start.
That was 1910. I was 17.
I'm 17 too!
I can't help being a girl,
but we've got your old blueprints.
If it's no good, you don't have to pay.
Okay, Grandpa?
She'll do fine.
I was overhauling engines when I was 12.
Sleep on it.
Shower's hot. Towels on the rack.
Breakfast at seven. Good night.
You're short, but we're friends.
I'll loan you the rest.
FLEXIBILITY
Good morning. Sleep okay?
Did you work all night?
Just a rough idea.
Same wing plan
with a different cross section.
That should give us five knots.
The original plans are amazing.
The old wings were monocoque.
I've never seen anything like it.
Whoever designed this wing
really understood wood.
I'm so impressed.
They only built one.
They said it was too dangerous to fly.
Found it in a warehouse.
Lucky you.
With this wing sweep,
I'm surprised you even get lift.
Takeoffs and landings are tricky.
No one can touch her in the air.
Sweep the wings half a degree more.
The rest is fine.
So you'll let me do it?
Thank you! You won't be sorry.
But on one condition.
Don't work all night.
You need sleep to do good work.
And to look good, too.
All right.
Actually, I was so nervous
last night I couldn't sleep.
To tell the truth, I was afraid
you wouldn't let me do it.
I'm so happy! I'll make some coffee.
I hope she's not going
to build it herself too.
Good morning.
The morning paper?
My niece Monica will do the drawings.
Hello.
My nephew's wife, the finishing.
My cousin's daughters, Sophia,
Laura, Constance and Valentina.
Fio's sister Giliola. Sandra's her cousin.
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty.
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna,
and her sister Miletta.
Porcelino!
Grandma!
The angels haven't come for you yet?
You've grown into a fine man!
You all work here, too?
To buy things for our greatgrandchildren.
Not a single man.
They're all family?
Yeah. There's no work here.
The men are all away working.
This depression...
Don't worry. The women
are tough and they work hard.
We're not making pancakes here.
Our Lord who art in Heaven...
We thank Thee for giving
our struggling company work and bread.
Forgive us for using women's hands
to build a fighter plane.
Amen.
Let's eat up and get to work!
Hear that? She's perfect.
How do you like them RPMs?
Watch out or you'll blow the shed away.
Curtis doesn't stand a chance.
SECOND BLUEPRINT
BIND THE TWO FUSELAGES
WE DO NOT OFFER CREDIT
Yeah, it's a good idea.
So can I do it?
Well, this is going to cost
a lot more money.
We're way over budget already.
Look at all these bills.
Ask our sponsor.
Porco...
Don't look at me like that.
Do whatever you like.
Great! I'll tell the workshop
and we'll get to work.
Porco, I love you!
WE DO NOT OFFER CREDIT
I can wait three months.
Maybe I'll become a pirate.
She's a good kid, huh?
Hands off.
That's the furthest thing from my mind.
So you made Squadron Leader.
Why did you come back?
I go where I want, Ferrarin.
The authorities don't like it.
Did you notice you're being tailed?
Yeah!
I eluded them.
There are warrants out on you
for treason, illegal entry, decadence...
pornography, and being a lazy pig.
It's not funny!
They want to seize your plane, too.
This is a lousy film.
Come back to the Air Force, Marco.
I could still get you in.
Better a pig than a Fascist.
Freelance daredevils are finished.
To fly now, you need a government
or an airline to pay you.
I only fly for myself.
Wherever you fly, you're still a pig.
Thanks, Ferrarin. Say hello to the guys.
This is a good film.
Watch your back.
They won't bother with a trial.
I know.
See you, buddy.
Want a ride?
Good timing.
I borrowed this to take the plane
to the lake for tests tomorrow.
No tests. I've got no time.
Don't be stupid!
I won't deliver an untested plane.
We can take it apart
and get it to the lake in a day.
I said there's no time.
Take a look behind us.
The Fascist Secret Police.
They followed you.
Me? Why?
Because they're following me.
And you're fixing my plane.
Porco, are you a spy?
Me, a spy?
I don't work hard enough to be a spy.
But you were a war hero.
Why follow an innocent man?
My thoughts exactly.
Whoops! Wrong way.
And you're telling me
you've done nothing wrong.
Time to get busy.
It's ready to fly.
There are two men out back
and three in front.
This is so exciting!
Settle down, Grandma.
I'll see you.
Take care.
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you. Give me five minutes.
What are you talking about?
Don't be stupid!
Shh! Don't shout.
Listen to me, Fio.
You're a respectable woman.
And you're not married.
Hold this.
Thanks. I just finished this.
Perfect!
Hold that, will you?
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.
I'm not running a tourist service.
I want to get my first job right.
I can make adjustments as we go.
I'm taking off from the canal.
I might not even get airborne.
All the more reason to take me.
You'll need a mechanic against Curtis.
I'm a man. We'll be all alone
on a deserted island.
Great. I love camping.
That's not the point.
Take her along. If you don't beat Curtis,
we don't get paid.
If you don't pay, we go broke.
You're her grandfather!
I'll give you a break on her salary
and throw in this voice tube.
They'll put a price on her head.
No. I'll be your hostage.
We'll tell the police you forced us
to help you. That'll be our excuse.
Please take me with you.
I'll make myself useful.
Take out the right machine gun.
I don't care how small your bottom is,
that's a tight fit.
Okay! My hips are bigger
than they look. Wait a minute.
We better leave before Grandma
decides to come too.
Hey, that's an idea!
Grandma, quick!
No souvenirs, please.
Contact!
Open up!
Let go!
Kidnapper! Pay us our money!
How's the rudder, Porco?
A handful, just like you.
I can barely control it.
Stop and I'll fix it.
No time. I've got to get her up.
This water's like glue! 
Barge ahead!
Here we go!
Come on, baby!
The flaps are in the water. Use your tabs.
Tabs?
They're new.
Quick! 
That's right. Now you're behaving.
Beautiful. The world is so beautiful.
Are they after us?
He's not stalking us.
But that's an Air Force plane.
It's Ferrarin.
You know him?
The Air Force is waiting for us.
He'll show us a way through.
He says to fly low to the Adriatic.
Thanks, buddy!
Thank you!
He saw you and signaled
"pearls before swine."
Beautiful.
A single rose blooming in a secret garden.
Naughty boy. This is a private garden.
You've got to read this.
It's from Hollywood.
"Regarding your starring
in the movie script you sent..."
I'm going to be a star, I'm sure of it.
The movie's called Flower of the Adriatic. 
Nice name.
Like it? Then it's settled.
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.
Being a hired gun
is just a rung on the ladder.
The next rung is Hollywood star.
And then?
President!
I'm serious. I'll make you
First Lady, Gina. I mean it.
Gina!
You're a dreamer. I like that in a man.
Really?
But I can't go.
I have a longstanding bet going here.
I bet myself a certain man
will visit me here,
and I'll tell him I love him.
But the fool only comes
to the club at night.
He never comes out in daylight.
That jerk is back!
You fool.
He kept going. I lost again.
You mean you're betting on that jerk?
Why not?
Life here is more complicated
than in your country.
Romance is easy, but...
Good luck in Hollywood, kid.
"Kid?"
I bumped my head when you did that roll.
Just saying hello to a friend.
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?
The woman in white on the terrace?
Grandpa told me.
All the pilots in the Adriatic
are in love with Gina.
He's got a big mouth.
What's she like?
Are you in love with her too?
I'm putting down.
Shut up or you'll bite your tongue.
Wait. Hey!
A girl in a fighter plane!
Where's Porco?
Talking politics with my dad.
It's not just the caretaker government.
It's the royalists, too.
They want to link up
with the Pirates' Federation.
There's no money
in chasing pirates any more.
There.
Thanks.
All this talk about a depression!
You ought to sell
your services somewhere, too.
A good pilot can make good money.
Got any smokes?
Curtis will go back to the States soon.
We're the ones who should go to America.
Farewell to days of fun
and freedom in the Adriatic.
Is that Byron?
No, it's me. See you.
Thanks.
Porco, it's terrible!
Their fuel costs three times
more than in Italy.
Give us a break.
We don't dilute our gas here.
Girls are so stupid.
Talk to her, will you?
Pay him, Fio.
Then stuff your biggerthanitlooks
backside in the jump seat.
We're off.
The fuel goes on your bill!
He wasn't gouging us. It's give and take.
It's pretty around here,
but everyone's broke.
There's the island.
It's beautiful!
What a great hideout.
Agh! My butt's gone to sleep.
Don't move!
Look at you silly idiots.
Boss! We got him!
Watch who you're stepping on!
Out of my way!
We've been waiting, pig.
We knew you were coming.
We've got scores to settle.
Look at this! He brought a girl!
She's pretty.
Shut up! So what?
Women make up half of the world.
That's not just any girl.
She's Piccolo's chief designer.
This cute little thing?
Are you sure?
My plane's a lot better than it was.
She's young but she's good.
Really, Porco?
I never lie about planes.
She's here to make sure I pay the bill.
You're in debt, too? Serves you right!
Bust that plane up so bad,
all he's got left is the loan!
You're going to take an axe
to the plane I built?
A plane as beautiful as that?
It's a long story, miss.
I'll bet!
Well, you know...
And you call yourselves pilots?
Where are my shoes?
I was raised on stories
about seaplane pilots.
My grandpa always said
there are no finer people anywhere.
Their hearts are washed clean
by the sea and sky.
So they're braver than sailors...
and prouder than regular pilots.
That's right. That's us seaplane pilots!
The most precious thing to them
isn't money or women, it's honor.
Yeah! That's right, miss!
You tell him!
Hurray for seaplane pilots!
Played them like a fiddle.
All right. We won't take our axes
and bust up the plane you built.
But honor won't let us
just walk away, either.
Mince the pig!
Yeah! Turn him into a baconburger!
Don't be so pigheaded!
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?
You need that American to save you?
Your mothers would weep.
And tell you to take a bath!
Porco's come back to go
oneonone against Curtis...
for the honor
of the seaplane pilots of the Adriatic!
A man without honor or scruples
is nothing. Fight fair!
I always said
we shouldn't have hired Curtis.
Stop trying to weasel out.
What do we do, Boss?
She has a point.
We could lose face here.
Should we talk to Curtis?
Get him to fight the pig again?
But the contract's expired.
This is embarrassing!
It's Curtiss!
Hey, it's Curtis!
I heard you! I don't run and I don't hide!
What idiot put a path up there?
Hold this for me.
So you want a return match?
But I already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun now.
So what do you want?
Beautiful!
Will you marry me if I win?
I'm serious.
All right. But if Porco wins,
you pay his bills.
Wait, Fio!
You keep out of it.
Stay out of it!
Shut up!
Speak now or hold your peace, Fio.
It's up to him.
It's a lot of money.
It's a bargain!
Yes or no?
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!
Good!
Listen, all of you!
I like this girl's spirit.
The Mamma Aiutos will sponsor this fight!
Count the Federation in!
See you later, Miss Fio!
Morons!
Don't forget to show up, pig!
Shut up and get out of here!
See ya!
Look what you've gone and gotten me into!
Don't be angry. I know it was stupid.
Fio?
I've got to thank you anyway.
You got me an opportunity.
Thanks. I guess fate meant
for us to be a team.
So we're partners?
My chances are only 5050.
I believe in you.
I hate that word, but it sounds
different coming from you.
What's the matter?
You're not feeling well?
I'm fine.
My heart started beating
so fast I couldn't breathe.
I was really scared.
My knees are all wobbly!
Hey!
I'm going swimming.
Porco, we screwed up!
How?
We didn't pad the bill.
We blew it!
You're right!
Porco?
What? Can't you sleep?
I could've sworn...
Or was I dreaming?
Go back to sleep.
We're off early tomorrow.
Porco?
Why did you turn into a pig?
It's a long story.
My father was in the same unit
as Lieutenant Marco Paggot.
I used to love the story
about how he jumped off a cliff
to rescue an enemy pilot.
Porco! Shall I kiss you?
Like the princess who turned
the frog back into a prince?
Don't be stupid.
Save it for someone special.
Maybe I'm not the one.
You're a good girl.
You make me think
humanity's not a complete waste.
Now be good and go to sleep.
Tell me a story, then I'll sleep.
A story?
Let's see.
It was the last summer of the war.
We were on our usual patrol
over the Adriatic,
heading for Istria.
Berlini was my wingman. 
An old friend,
who'd gotten married two days earlier. 
I was best man at his wedding. 
But we couldn't get leave,
so we'd come straight back to base. 
Planes were dropping like flies,
ours and theirs.
There were three of them on my tail.
I had my hands full.
Then I was the only one left on our side.
The enemy kept on coming.
They had bloodshot eyes.
I was numb, I couldn't see.
I thought I was a goner.
Suddenly everything went white
all around me.
White?
Like I was in pure light.
But a light so strange
I didn't notice I was in a cloud. 
I didn't even have the strength
to hold the stick. 
But the plane flew itself. 
A world above the clouds?
Yeah, and dead quiet.
The sky was so beautiful...
with this one long contrail
stretching out of sight.
Berlini, you're okay!
Berlini, wait! Where are you going?
Berlini, stop! What about Gina?
I'll go instead!
When I came to, I was all alone,
flying just above the waves.
Heaven wasn't ready for you.
I think God was telling me
to fly alone forever.
No, Porco! You're a good person!
The good ones are all dead.
And maybe what I saw was Hell.
End of story. Go to sleep.
That junkyard sold me rusty ammo.
I'm glad you came back alive.
I really like you, Porco.
Good night!
Place your bets here!
The pig or Curtis?
If you're real men, put your money
where your mouths are!
Come get ice cream!
You'd think it was a carnival!
They're all air pirates?
The scum of the Mediterranean.
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers...
spies, undercover cops,
and a few respectable citizens.
This is going to make me even more famous!
Ten minutes to start! 
The showdown between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtis is about to begin!
There's no rules. The first one
to run is a coward forever!
Shut up! We came here for a dogfight.
We're not here for a lecture!
Shut up! Open your mouth and we shoot you!
A tenton bomb would be better.
This fight decides the fate
of our beloved Miss Fio Piccolo...
who needs no introduction!
Know what I mean?
A big hand for Fio! Applaud!
Get on with it!
Quiet! There are formalities to observe!
Both sides will place their wagers!
Please sit down.
Thank you.
Put it down!
No complaints? All right, shake hands
and come out flying!
Forget it. I'll keep my hands clean.
That's not very friendly.
We'll go straight to the church!
Don't worry. My mother says
you can get used to anything.
May we have a picture?
We took a bath!
Smile, everyone!
Smile!
Ready...
Here, here!
Black wins if it's over in three minutes!
Maybe we could get them
to do this every month!
15 seconds to start. 
That is so cool!
Five seconds... Four... 
Three... Two... 
One... Zero! 
Curtis is up first!
It's all Curtis so far!
Gimme!
Come on, Porco! Get above him!
He's smart to stay low.
He's harder to hit.
Don't worry! I've got lots of ammo.
A barrel roll. The pig's on his tail!
A barrel roll?
That trick made him
the Ace of the Adriatic!
Damn!
Now!
He didn't shoot!
Did his gun jam?
He's not going to shoot
until the very end.
What?
The pig's not a killer.
The American still has plenty of ammo!
Now! Shoot!
He didn't fire. What did I tell you?
If he shoots now, he'll hit the American.
He's going to wait till he can put
two or three rounds into the engine.
The damn fool!
This is no time for sportsmanship.
Porco...
What's wrong with you? Shoot!
Or are your guns jammed? Too bad.
Here they come!
Come on, fight like a pig!
Not this way! No!
He's coming around!
Get down!
Go fight somewhere else!
Look at those vapor trails!
You only see this once in a lifetime!
This is so moving!
If she doesn't hurry she'll miss it.
She won't come out of her room.
Are we going or not? I want to see it too!
F to Gina. Warn pig. 
Stop fooling around. Air Force is coming. 
"F"? That's Ferrarin.
Time to go!
They're both really tough.
They're just getting warmed up.
Go, Porco!
You stupid pig!
You think you can have Fio?
Now the pig's got his tail!
The finale!
Huh?
It's jammed.
You're finished!
What?
Jammed!
What's the matter, out of ammo?
It's broken. Fio's big butt!
No ties in this game!
This isn't a western!
What are you going to hit with that?
You jerk!
What's that going to do? Hiho Silver!
You rotten pig!
Missed!
Chicken!
You ducked!
You don't love her.
Shut up, pig!
Something's wrong.
They're coming down!
They're back!
Wait! The prizes stay here!
All right, wait for me!
You eat too much!
Cowboy!
Put 'em up.
Go punch a cow!
Come on, Porco!
Get up, pig.
That's dirty!
Uppercut! Block!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! The Federation can take bets.
Somebody bring a bell!
Can't you go faster?
No. She'll overheat.
Pilots are all crazy!
Fio! Did you see that punch?
I'll finish you in the next round.
I'll make sure
I take you out.
Stay in there!
I'm gonna flatten you, pig.
Come on, pretty boy!
You're the pretty boy here!
Chasing every girl you see!
What about you?
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?
What was that?
You only get one!
Gina...
Miss Gina to you!
Gina's in love with you!
She sits in that garden...
and waits...
for you to come!
Porco!
The bell!
Start the count!
Look at him!
The Air Force isn't here yet.
Trying to psyche me out, huh?
I don't get you.
It's the truth!
You can't have Fio!
That's Gina!
There's trouble!
First one to stand wins!
Coming through!
Gina, stop!
Marco, can you hear me?
Are you going to break
another woman's heart?
Porco!
Porco!
Thank you, Porco!
It was nothing.
Okay, the party's over.
The Italian Air Force is coming.
Get out of here, everyone.
Come to the club. Drinks are on the house!
We're out of here!
It's over.
Boss! Hurry!
There are formalities to observe!
I hate the pig, but I like you.
Build some good planes.
Bye!
Thanks. Take a bath sometime!
Thanks, Mr. Curtis!
Next time it won't be a bet.
I'll court you for real.
Sure. But I've made up my mind.
You ride in Gina's plane.
No!
I ride in your plane!
We're partners, aren't we?
Gina, take this girl
back to the regular world.
You always do this. It's not fair.
Sorry. Off you go.
Take her up.
Here comes the cavalry.
Help me draw them away.
Hey, your face! Wait!
Show me your face!
Your plane's over there!
Just one look!
I never saw Porco again, 
even after the Air Force gave up... 
and I went back to Milan. 
But Gina and I became good friends. 
And we still are, throughout the war 
and all the turmoil. 
Now I run Piccolo Co., 
but I still spend my summers
at the Hotel Adriano. 
Gina is more beautiful every year,
and there are lots of old faces. 
Oh, yes. Mr. Curtis isn't President yet,
but he writes us... 
to tell us how he misses the good old days
of that Adriatic summer. 
And did Gina win her bet?
That's our secret. 
THE END
