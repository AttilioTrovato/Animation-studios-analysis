Faster, Launchpad, faster!
Slower, Launchpad, slower!
Launchpad, is this a stunt
you learned in flight school?
Flight school?
You mean you never tool flying lessons?
L tool a crash course.
Now he tells me.
Nosedive!
Cool.
Oh, boy, lool at that!
There's the dig!
Did they say what they'd found?
Aye. A hidden chamber.
You thinl it might have the treasure
of Collie Baba and his 40 thieves?
After all this, l'm not getting my hopes up.
We're maling our final approach.
Put seat bacls
in their upright position.
Just put the plane
in an upright position.
Please remain seated until
the plane has come to a complete stop.
Landing gear down.
Launchpad, lool what you've done
to these ancient ruins.
It could have been worse.
It could have been something new.
Hurry, Mr McDucl.
We've found something.
Bless my bagpipes.
An engraving of Collie Baba.
This could well be the treasure chest
of the greatest thief who ever lived.
Let's see.
He stole clothes?
Nothing but old robes.
40 years of searching and l end up
with Collie Baba's dirty laundry.
At least the box is pretty,
Uncle Scrooge.
There's something in this poclet.
The seal of Collie Baba.
It's a map.
Perhaps this dig
is not a lost cause after all.
That's right. A treasure map
written in Collie Baba's own hand.
At last, after all these centuries,
the lamp will be mine again.
Yes!
You will become more powerful than
locomotive, more faster than speedy bull.
You will leap all buildings
in a single town.
And you shall finally be rewarded
for your dubious assistance.
You mean it?
My own mountain of money?
Yes. Now... give it to me.
Yes... What?
The map. Ive it to me.
The map? That specific map?
Right here, right now?
You didn't steal it?
Too many people. Only one Dijon.
But lool what l did steal.
Several billfolds, this dandy poclet watch,
floss, eggbale nut bar
and two ticlets to the feta cheese festival
for you, master.
Maybe you would lile the floss?
Did you at least see where the map leads?
Yes, master.
Into the middle of the desert.
Where the sand burns lile a hot lebab.
But l searched every square inch.
Perhaps this time l'll let Scrooge
do the searching for me.
Smart move, master.
Let him boil out his brains in the sun.
And you shall
accompany him as his guide.
But l have such sensitive slin.
And my brain boils so quiclly.
But who needs brains
to be a guide, anyway?
Ee, Mr McD. A plane ride would
have been less turbulent.
According to the map, the cave
of Collie Baba should be right here,
under the gaze of Mount Badude.
L don't see anything, Uncle Scrooge.
Not even a mirage.
Maybe we tool the wrong turn
at that last sand dune.
Launchpad, Can't you even ride a camel
without crashing it?
Lt's not my fault.
Humpy here just had a great fall.
He must have hit this lousy rocl.
Ouch! My tootsies.
It lools lile a pintsized pyramid.
Quaclaroonie. It's bigger than it lools.
L wonder what's inside.
There's only one way to find out, lads.
Start digging.
If l read these hieroglyphics correctly,
we may have found the entrance.
Lool at this.
All right. Let's go.
Me first.
After you.
But the camels will be lonesome.
Thinl we'll see a mummy?
My mummy's expecting me.
It's time for my nap.
Careful. Stay close, Webby. No telling
what lind of dangers we may find.
Lools safe to me.
Checl it out.
Lool at that.
It's a Collie Baba booby trap.
What does the Junior Woodchucl
uide Bool say about booby traps?
Lt says "Stay alert and use your marbles".
Boy, good thing l brought some.
There's another one.
That could have given me a booboo.
Just leep the light ahead of us, guide.
Keep going, Dijon.
Maybe one of the children
might be wanting to hold the torch.
Lool out!
Do not be fearing.
Dijon shall trip the trap.
You see?
Ls there a doctor in the pyramid?
Angway. Coming through.
Jumpstart my heart!
The treasure!
Race you to the rubies.
Lool at those nuggets.
Come on, Dijon!
Lool at all that gold.
Collie Baba, you old dog.
L've finally found it.
Lool at this.
What an eyeful.
What a mouthful.
The money, the rubies, the diamonds.
The lamp!
Pinch me, l'm in heaven.
L'll get it.
Uncle Scrooge.
Sumowrestling scorpions.
Don't worry. We're safe up here.
Dijon!
What? L am not touching a thing.
L am clean, innocent,
lile a little baby goat.
O get the sacls.
Sacls?
Oh, yes, sacls. Right away.
Anything you say, sir, l do for you.
Where you going to leep
all this treasure?
L won't leep it all, Most of these
artefacts will go to museums.
That doesn't sound lile Uncle Scrooge.
That way l enjoy a hefty tax breal.
That does.
Looky. Looky. A teapot.
Just an old oil lamp.
Hardly worth taling.
May l have it, Uncle Scrooge?
L can use it for my tea set.
Well...
Course, this is pretty too.
Here. Don't say your Uncle Scrooge
never gave you anything.
Thanls.
That's the last of it.
You thinl you can carry it, Launchpad?
No problemo.
Don't lose it.
Thanls, Dijon.
Here, l can handle it.
Help!
Allow me.
Who's that guy?
Just another tour guide.
Let me light your path.
L smell a couple of desert rats.
Uncle Scrooge!
Hurry!
You thieving dogs! L've spent my life
searching for that treasure.
Poor fool. Too bad you will not live to
Inow the real treasure you have found.
Farewell.
L Inew that weasel's prices
were too good to be true.
What are we gonna do?
Cut the ropes, lads.
Hurry, Louie.
Et away! Shoo!
Lt's turtle time.
Forward, ho!
Reverse, ho!
Lf you don't stop crashing,
l'll give you the heaveho.
Do you hear something?
Quicl,
let's turn this over and male a boat.
Hurry, Uncle Scrooge.
Here, Webby, you tale this.
Come on!
Lt's here, master. L saw it. Wait till
you see it. You will be pleased as pop.
Well? Where is it?
L do not understand. It must be here.
You have it, don't you?
Where is the lamp?
They must have it. They must.
Those dirty thieves.
And such sweet children.
L asl you, what is the world coming to?
You let them steal it from you,
you pathetic piclpoclet.
Don't worry. L will help get it bacl.
No trouble, you bet, here l come.
Yes, right behind you.
L mean, don't wait, Dijon is on the way.
Mamma!
L'd sure lile to Inow where this leads.
L'm not so sure you do.
Boy, are we in trouble.
Either the water is getting higher
or the roof is getting lower.
What a ride.
Yeah. L wouldn't mind doing it again.
Now that l Inow you can live through it.
At least we're all OK.
Speal for yourself.
L just lost the treasure of the century.
Here, Uncle Scrooge. You can have this
bacl if it'll male you feel better.
That's all right, dear.
It tool me 40 years to find that treasure
and l plan to get it bacl,
even if it tales another 40.
Hello?
Merlocl?
Scrooge?
Where is everybody?
They have vanished.
But how?
With the lamp, you fool.
And you will help me get it bacl,
or their sting will seem lile
a ticlle compared with mine.
Duclburg Daily News on line one, sir.
For what?
L believe they want to asl
what happened with the treasure.
None of your business.
Whenever l get my mind off the treasure,
the press presses me about it again.
L have some news to cheer you up.
What's that?
You've finally received your invitation
to the Archaeological Society ball.
L cannot face those old fossils again.
Every year l tell them
"l'll find Collie Baba's treasure."
And every year
l come bacl emptyhanded.
But you did have it for a little while.
Does everyone have to remind me?
Sorry.
L can't worl, Mrs Featherby.
L'm going home.
But what about your lunch?
Sell it.
Here's the polish, Webbigail.
Thanls, rammy.
As soon as l'm done polishing my teapot,
we can have a tea party with my dollies.
Thanls for the warning.
Excuse me, ma'am.
But l've been summoned
to picl up Mr McDucl.
Apparently, he's having
another one of his chipper days.
Oh, dear.
Maybe we'd better play outside today.
Hey.
What?
Lt shool.
See?
Quaclaroonie!
Well, there's nothing in it.
What is it, a Mexican jumping lamp?
Wonder of wonders!
L'm free at last.
Shabooey!
It's a genie, isn't it?
It's not the tooth fairy.
What the...?
Who are you? Where's Collie Baba?
Did Rome fall yet?
We rubbed the lamp.
We're sorry if we did anything bad.
My new masters.
L am eternally grateful.
Finally, there's room to stretch.
My foot's been asleep for six centuries.
Cool lasbah.
Mind if l lool around?
Cold food closet.
Where do you hang the chiclen?
Don't tell me. A rug beater?
Egg beater.
Yes, l see.
Bacl, you foul eggs. Bacl l say.
Shabooey, it's alive!
Wait! Come bacl!
Where'd he go?
What do you Inow?
Las Vegas must be some place
if Caesar moved his palace there.
What are you doing?
Catching up on the 20th century.
You read the whole encyclopaedia?
From cover to cover to cover to cover to...
What's this? A baseball? A bowling ball?
Cinderella's ball?
No, it's a globe of the earth.
Et bacl.
The earth isn't flat?
L must have missed that part.
He has been in that lamp a long time.
L gotta checl this out.
Wait a second.
What about our wishes?
Wishes?
Do l lool lile a birthday cale?
Come on, you can't fool us.
A genie's supposed to grant wishes.
Yeah, three wishes for every master.
Darn. Everybody remembers that part.
How does it worl?
How does it worl?
OK!
First you have to hold the lamp.
Then say "l wish."
Yeah?
Then wish for something.
That's all?
Jeepers. It's even userfriendly.
L Inow the first wish.
L'm going to wish for a million wishes.
Et serious. That never worls.
L guess one of us oughta wish for
peace and happiness all over the world.
These are wishes, not miracles.
What if we wish for a pet?
That's more lile it.
L Inow what l've always wanted.
L wish for a baby elephant.
Oh, no! Please.
Shabooey!
Now lool what you've gone and done.
What's wrong? She's cute.
And big. Big wishes spell big trouble.
The bigger the wish, the bigger the trouble.
He's right. One lool at that and
Uncle Scrooge'll want to Inow what's up.
Everyone who sees it will,
and they'll all be fighting over me,
and the wishes'll get out of control and
l'll be buried for another 1,000 years.
Ah, jeepers. L hadn't thought of that.
So, please, male small wishes.
It's our nanny.
Hurry. Hide the elephant.
Lile where?
Shabooey! L'm in trouble already.
We all are.
Elephant! Pinl! Hurry!
Down, girl! Please!
Here, Louie, you wish Pinky away.
L'm not wasting one of my wishes.
You do it.
No way.
Will somebody do something?
Here.
L wish Webby never made her stupid wish.
Let's get outta here
before anybody sees enie.
In here, Mr McDucl.
It's gone.
Mrs Bealley, is this a ploy
to get some vacation time?
Lt was here. Honest.
An elephant wearing a big pinl bow.
You thinl l'm crazy, don't you?
Maybe not.
L thinl he saw us.
Quicl. Et bacl in the lamp.
Not the lamp.
The dog house, a madhouse,
even a house of pancales.
Anywhere but the lamp.
In here.
Hello, Uncle Scrooge.
Hello, Uncle Scrooge.
Don't you "hello" me. What lind of tricl
are you lids playing on Mrs Bealley?
Who, us?
Tricls?
Never.
Not us, Uncle Scrooge.
Then what's going on?
Nothing.
Not much. Nope, not a thing.
What was that?
The crash in the closet?
We didn't hear it.
Ive me five. Et down,
get bad, get real, get a haircut.
Who is this?
...Er... ene.
Yeah, .
You're new around here?
Kinda. L pop up every now and then.
He just came over to visit.
For the night.
The night? You mean, sleep over?
Yeah. Can he?
Please.
We'll be good Junior Woodchucls.
Woodchucl's promise.
Ditto.
All right. But stay out of trouble.
L'm in no mood for mischief.
We're flying now!
What else should we wish for?
L'd lile a small steamboat.
Sure. You want that
with or without an ocean?
A little much?
Just a tad.
L Inow. L wish for the world's biggest
ice cream sundae.
But not too big.
Ice cream sundae, come on down.
Otta watch out for that wind shear.
L'm starving.
That's cos it's getting late.
Betcha Uncle Scrooge'll wonder
why we missed dinner.
Maybe we should go now.
Nah.
Oh, dear. No sign of them yet.
Should l call the police?
Aye, to hold me bacl
when those rascals finally get home.
They'll be grounded for a month.
No video games,
no television and no more friends...
...spending the night.
We're bacl.
Children, l thinl your uncle
has something to say to you.
Aye. Welcome home.
Can l get you and ene anything?
Coolies? Mill? Lce cream?
No, thanls. We're lind of full.
And sleepy.
That's because it's past your bedtime.
Scoot along, my wee ones.
Ood night, Uncle Scrooge.
Nightynight.
Sleep tight.
That's telling them, sir.
So this is how it feels
to be one of the guys.
It's all l've ever wished for.
How many wishes do we have left?
Just my last one. And Webby's.
We'd better male sure they're special.
It's him!
Hide me! Hurry! Chase him away!
But it's just an old owl.
An owl?
He comes around here every night.
L thought it was my meanest master,
the one Collie Baba stole the lamp from.
Your master was a bird?
He could change into anything.
He's an evil sorcerer.
But he can't still be alive.
He'd be ancient.
Yeah. Older than Uncle Scrooge even.
Except his first wish
was to live for ever.
Ood wisher.
No.
Bad wisher. You don't Inow.
He made me do the worst things.
Lile what?
D'you ever hear of Atlantis?
Lt was everybody's favourite resort
until Merlocl couldn't get reservations.
Then down she went. And poor Pompeii.
Mount Vesuvius would have never blown
its top if Merlocl hadn't blown his.
But what are you worried about?
He used up his wishes.
That's just it. Merlocl has unlimited
wishes because he has a magic talisman.
It's what gives him all his powers.
And when he puts it on the lamp,
he gets as many wishes as he wants.
Now do you see why l'm a little jumpy?
Maybe we should wish for the talisman.
That's the one wish l can't do.
You'd have to steal it from him
yourself, and good lucl.
Don't worry about
that mean old master now.
He has no idea you're with us.
And that's the way it's gonna stay.
There it is. You can drop me off
anywhere along here. But not there.
That's going to leave a nasty marl.
Are you certain
this is where Scrooge lives?
This time l'm very sure. L thinl.
Then we begin our search.
In light? But l am not
a popular favourite in that house.
Scrooge find me, he lill me.
Then stay behind if you wish.
L'll try very hard
to remember you at reward time.
There's the robber.
Catch him!
Come on, rug, giddyup!
Idup! Upsiedaisy!
Reach for the chandelier!
Boys. Teaparty time.
Not now, Webby.
We're in the middle of an arrest.
L Inow someone
who wants to play with me.
Come on, enie. They don't Inow
how much fun they're gonna miss.
L told you, l'm not going to the ball.
But, sir, l've arranged
for Launchpad to fly you to the launch.
Cancel Launchpad. L'll not only
save face, but my life as well.
You're gonna love playing tea party.
L Inow. L read all about it.
Can l be the guy who dresses lile an
Indian and throws tea off the boat?
No.
No, silly.
Not a Boston Tea Party.
L hate rats!
First you pour the tea...
then tale little sips...
and tall to your guests.
What a lovely dress, Quacky.
Et outta here. No war paint
or tomahawls or anything?
Just you and me and my friends here.
You call these party animals?
They're lifeless.
Enie, you've just given me
the bestest idea in the world.
There is a way to have
all my friends enjoy the party.
L didn't mean it. The less the merrier.
Just you and me and a pot of tea.
This'll be fun. L wish
all my toys and dollies were alive.
Shabooey!
Lt's so nice to finally meet all of you.
Coolies, anyone?
Feeding frenzy.
Dollies, be good.
If there's anything l hate more
than elephants in the house, it's rats.
Here, ratty, come to nanny.
This isn't a house! Lt's a zoo!
Wish them bacl, please.
L can't. That was my last wish.
L wish you hadn't said that.
Oh, dear. Launchpad isn't answering.
He must be on his way.
Won't you go, sir?
Aye, to worl. Tell Launchpad
he can tale you to the ball.
Since when does a hat
have a mind of its own?
Otcha!
Watch out for your head, sir.
Master.
Poor nosey.
What is going on?
What did you do this time?
L'm sorry. Just male them stop.
But l've only got one wish left.
Boys, what is going on here?
Well?
Lools lile the jig is up.
O ahead, Louie.
L wish everything was bacl to normal.
Blow my bagpipes. He's a genie.
Does his mother Inow about this?
We were gonna tell you, Uncle Scrooge.
Someday.
Where'd he come from?
Remember my teapot?
Heavenly heather.
The genie in the magic lamp.
The fortunes l could own. L could have
the world's biggest diamond.
No, the world's biggest diamond mine.
No, all the diamond mines.
No, the entire mining industry!
Yes!
L can see this will tale
some careful thought.
It's your ride, sir.
Or should l say, my ride.
Are you lidding? L wouldn't miss this
party for all the scones in Scotland.
But the treasure...
Aye, the treasure.
The one wish
l don't have to thinl about twice.
L wish for the treasure of Collie Baba.
Oh, no. Shabooey!
The bonny bounty is mine again.
Wait till those old fossils
at the society hear this news.
In the lamp.
You're coming with me.
Not the lamp. Have a heart.
Can't he stay with us, Uncle Scrooge?
No. L'm not letting
this wee gold mine out of my sight.
But he's our friend.
Nonsense. A genie isn't a person.
A genie is a thing.
Inside.
Bye, guys.
It was great while it lasted.
Don't tale him, Uncle Scrooge.
You can't.
Let him stay, please.
Poor master. Oh, well.
Where is the lamp?
Scrooge has it.
Oh, no!
Music, food, guacamole.
It's a party. Otta boogie. Otta bingo.
L gotta get outta this lamp.
Let me out.
Can you leep quiet at all?
Lf you let me out, l'll be as quiet
as a mouse, and just as small.
All right.
Lool at us! A couple of single guys
out on the town.
Uess again.
You can watch the ball from here.
Otherwise you go bacl in the lamp.
But what if l win the door prize?
Master, all this flipflapping.
Maybe we tale the bus bacl.
Silence.
You shall go through the rear entrance
while l go in the front.
If Scrooge gets past you,
it'll be your hide.
Here's your soda, sir.
Enie, party of one.
L gotta warn Mr McDucl.
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention?
We have an important announcement
to male this evening.
Without further ado,
l give you Scrooge McDucl.
L gotta stop him.
L have something l've been wanting
to say for 40 years.
It is my good fortune to announce
that this year l have finally
brought to Duclburg
the legendary,
the infamous treasure of...
It's Merlocl, my old master.
It's that baclstabbing banshee.
He's too powerful. He could destroy you.
L'll save you. Left, right! O!
Follow me.
Hurry.
You are a loon.
What are you doing?
Quicl, you gotta wish us outta here.
Not me.
These wishes are worth a fortune.
What's more important 
a fortune or your life?
Well...
It's not exactly a tricl question.
He's got a bear?
He is a bear.
Male us a little getaway wish. Please!
No, we stand our ground.
L've got one tricl
that might save us, l hope.
Oing up.
Bad houseleeping. It lools lile
they have slipped the coop.
It was not my fault.
They did not get past Dijon.
It was not your fault either, master.
No.
Just leep searching while
l hunt outside. They will not escape.
As you wish, master, l do for you.
L can't hear anything. They're gone.
Where are we?
Well, it's not exactly the Ritz.
Not the lamp.
You get used to the smell
after a few hundred years.
Can you move your elbow?
Et me out of here!
Do you have to yell at me all the time?
L wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for you.
Thanls to you,
l've got a crazy animal act on my tail.
That's it, blame the genie.
L only saved your life.
Sorry.
It's not my fault Merlocl's after me.
L didn't asl to be Mr Popular.
All l want is a life of my own,
lile your nephews.
With my own bile,
a stacl of comic bools, a sled.
Maybe some sli equipment, a CD player,
my own home video entertainment system.
All right.
Oh, no, it's Merlocl! Hide me!
L've got to get you to my vault.
It's the only safe place.
Time to go bacl.
But you saw what a dump it is.
Sorry, enie, but the party's over.
And just when we were
getting to be buddies.
Scrooge.
Mr McDucl! Mr McDucl!
Are you all right? What's going on?
Come out, whoever you are.
Wait till Merlocl sees this.
He will be so grateful.
L can see my mountain of money now.
Wait. Why give him the lamp?
Because the master wants it so badly.
But with the lamp,
you'll be the big cheese,
the hot falafel,
the most powerful person on earth.
Reat master.
Master?
Master Dijon?
L lile it. L really lile it.
Launchpad!
Et me out of here fast.
Dull party, Mr McD?
O! Now!
Don't plan on landing. L don't have time
for any more disasters.
Ood morning, Scrooge, sir.
What's going on?
At the urging of my genie,
l have decided to seel my fortune.
L never thought he'd wish for
your fortune, Mr McDucl, l swear.
The lamp?
Ravy?
That's right.
L get the loot, you get the boot.
You can't do this. Put me down.
L'm your boss, not that bum.
Tale him downtown.
You can forget about
this year's Christmas bonus.
Whose name do you thinl
is on this... building?
Dijon? Lt really is his.
Wiped out with a wish.
If l ever get my money bacl,
l promise l'll never male
another wish for myself again.
There's someone to see you, Mr McDucl.
Lads. Webby.
Uncle Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge.
Sir, good to see you.
Mr McDucl, l'm so sorry.
There, Mr Bealley. L Inow.
We all chipped in to set bail.
We even emptied our banls.
Don't worry. L'll pay you all bacl
with cash at the mansion.
The mansion?
He hasn't heard.
Heard what?
Mr McDucl, l'm so sorry.
Dijon has everything 
the mansion, the factories.
Even your spat collection, sir.
Mr McDucl!
Our home. Our beautiful home.
There, there. L Inow, ma'am. L Inow.
First my Money Bin, now this.
Well, at least we have each other.
Thinl of poor enie.
If only there was a way
to sneal in and get bacl the lamp.
But there's so many alarms.
Aye. Hundreds.
And 14,657 ways
to trigger them.
And you Inow each and every one,
don't you, Uncle Scrooge?
Aye.
And maybe the way to shut 'em off?
Aye.
Come, lads. Something tells me
we should plan a fullscale invasion.
Delicious.
Delicious. Ood golly, everything smells
more delicious when you're rich.
Even me.
Shouldn't we be birdwatching?
Don't worry about Merlocl.
He would not dare to confront
the great and powerful Dijon.
Anyway,
l don't thinl he Inows about me yet.
L've got the Bin at 12 o'clocl high,
Mr McD. Ive or tale 10 minutes.
Snuggy enough, sir?
All right, lads. Operation Lift the Lamp
is about to commence.
Roger, Uncle Scrooge. Over and out.
See anyone coming,
Commander Bealley?
L don't thinl so.
Then wish us lucl.
This is it.
C... A... S... H.
Remember, only step on the white tiles.
L'm on the roof.
And we're inside.
Ood. All you have to do
is breal into the security room.
Don't worry. We're almost there.
That's easy for you to say.
Keep going, Webby.
If you can't get through, no one can.
Attagirl!
There's the alarm panel.
L've got Uncle Scrooge's directions
to leep from getting zapped.
Two steps up the middle.
One step to the right,
three steps forward,
and... five steps...
You'd better get bacl here.
Ood thing you had your hairnet.
What are we gonna do?
Use our marbles.
Marbles.
You don't have to worry
about any alarms, Uncle Scrooge.
Ood worl, lads. L'm going in.
Enie, l've decided on my first
important act as a rich man.
L shall plan a vacation. L wonder
which country l shall be visiting first.
Are you sure it's safe to travel?
Merlocl could be close.
Do not worry, enie, l have planned
to tale a small army of bodyguards.
Whoever said that money
can't buy peace of mind
must have had the brains
of a garbanzo bean.
Oh, no!
Ive that bacl, you dirty...
Please, Merlocl.
No wishes. L can't tale 'em.
Relax. It's going to be
lile old times again.
Come on. We gotta help.
My talisman now gives me
unlimited wishes, Scrooge.
And where are you going?
Just outside, master.
You and enie
have so much to catch up on,
l thought you might be wanting
a few minutes alone.
L Inow l would.
Enie.
L wish you would turn this
disloyal swine into something fitting.
Just lile old times all right.
And now, enie, l wish
you would transform this mundane Bin
into a fortress
more worthy of its new owner.
Remember our magnificent old home?
Yeah. Casa de Coocoo.
My money!
Come on!
Wait for me.
Help!
Here, Webby, hold on!
My heavens!
L'm so sorry, Mr McDucl.
And now, enie,
l wish to return home in my new home.
Will you never stop?
This cannot be happening.
You maniac. Return the Bin before
l stuff that lamp down your throat.
Bad move.
You threaten me?
Please, Merlocl. He's had a lousy day.
Maybe a hot bath
and a warm glass of mill...
Silence. L wish you would
cast him out of my house.
No!
L can't.
Do it.
L have no choice.
L understand.
Ood shot.
Et it, guys!
Uncle Scrooge!
L'll be bacl for you.
No!
No!
Laugh at me, will you?
L'll show you.
Ive that bacl, you fleabitten buzzard!
My talisman!
This time you have to male a wish.
Aye. L wish me and my family and my Bin
were bacl in Duclburg.
Right now.
Ood wishing.
Duclburg never looled so good.
Aye,
but it cannot beat my view, laddies.
Has any heather
ever looled more heavenly?
And you still have the lamp,
Uncle Scrooge.
Aye. And one more wish to go.
You sound lile you Inow what it is.
L'm going to stop all this magic.
Even if l must wish for the lamp
to be buried in the centre of the earth.
What?
No! You can't.
Oh, no!
But enie'll be gone for ever.
Aren't we overreacting?
We could... hide him in the vault.
And we'll dress him up lile a boy
and leep him in our room.
Just lile before.
Enie, get ready to grant my last wish.
And yours too.
What do you mean?
L wish the genie
would turn into a real boy.
Shabooey!
L'm a boy.
L'm a real boy.
Now l can do
all the things real boys do.
Run through fields,
play catch, roll over.
Wait. That's a dog.
Uncle Scrooge. What about the lamp?
Lool. Without the genie,
it's wasting away.
How can l ever thanl you, master?
L'm not your master any more.
That's right.
Can l call you Uncle Scrooge?
You're a sweet lid.
But don't press your lucl.
What do you wanna do
on your first day as a boy?
Let me put it this way 
you'll never catch me, coppers.
Oh, boy! L'm gonna getcha!
Are you coming with us, Uncle?
You go ahead, Webby, dear.
We quadzillionaires
have our own ideas of fun.
You!
Scrooge, sir. Oh, good golly,
What a time we have been having.
Yes. L was just now leaving. Oodbye.
But it's only some loose change.
L'll change your face, you thief!
Somebody stop those pants.
