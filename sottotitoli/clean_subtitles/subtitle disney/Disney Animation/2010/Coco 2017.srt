{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Sometimes,
I think I'm cursed. 
{\ blur3.7} Because of something that
happened before I was even born. 
{\ blur3.7} See, a long time ago,
there was this family. 
{\ blur3.7} The papa, he was a musician. 
{\ blur3.7} He and his family would sing and
dance and count their blessings. 
{\ blur3.7} But he also had a dream.
To play for the world. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} And one day, 
{\ blur3.7} he left with his guitar
and never returned. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} And the mama...
{\ blur3.7} She didn't have time to cry
over that walkaway musician. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} After banishing all music from
her life she found a way... 
{\ blur3.7} to provide for her daughter. 
{\ blur3.7} She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} She could have made candy, 
{\ blur3.7} or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear... 
{\ blur3.7} for wrestlers,
but no, she chose shoes. 
{\ blur3.7} Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes. 
{\ blur3.7} And later,
she taught her soninlaw. 
{\ blur3.7} Then her grandkids got roped in. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} As her family grew,
so did the business. 
{\ blur3.7} Music had torn her family apart. 
{\ blur3.7} But shoes held
them all together. 
{\ blur3.7} You see, that woman was 
{\ blur3.7} my greatgreatgrandmother, 
Mama Imelda. 
{\ blur3.7} She died way before I was born. 
{\ blur3.7} But my family
still tells her story 
{\ blur3.7} every year
on Dia de los Muertos...
{\ blur3.7} the Day of the Dead. 
{\ blur3.7} And her little girl, 
{\ blur3.7} she's my greatgrandmother, 
Mama Coco. 
{\ blur3.7} Hola, Mama Coco.
{\ blur3.7}How are you, Julio?
{\ blur3.7} Actually, my name is Miguel. 
{\ blur3.7}Mama Coco has trouble
remembering things. 
{\ blur3.7} But it's good
to talk to her anyway. 
{\ blur3.7} So, I tell her
pretty much everything. 
{\ blur3.7}I used to run like this.
{\ blur3.7}But now I run like this
which is way faster.
{\ blur3.7}And the winner
is Luchadora Coco!
{\ blur3.7}I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.
{\ blur3.7}Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.
{\ blur3.7}Miguel, eat your food.
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : My Abuelita,
she's Mama Coco's daughter. 
{\ blur3.7}Oh, you're a twig, mijo. 
Have some more.
{\ blur3.7}No, gracias. 
{\ blur3.7}I asked if you would
like more tamales!
{\ blur3.7} Si? 
{\ blur3.7}That's what I thought you said!
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Abuelita runs our house 
{\ blur3.7} just like Mama Imelda did. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}No music!

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}No music!
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Y aunque la vida ♪ 
{\ blur3.7}No music!

{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : I think we're
the only family in Mexico 
{\ blur3.7} who hates music. 
{\ blur3.7} And my family's fine
with that. But me... 
{\ blur3.7}Be back by lunch, mijo. 
Love you, Mama. 
{\ blur3.7} I am not like
the rest of my family! 
{\ blur3.7} Hola, Miguel!
Hola! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Muchas gracias. 
De nada, Miguel.
{\ blur3.7} 
Hey! Dante!
{\ blur3.7}Sit. Down.
Roll over. Shake.
{\ blur3.7}Fist bump!
{\ blur3.7}Good boy, Dante!
{\ blur3.7} I know I'm not
supposed to love music. 
{\ blur3.7} But it's not my fault!
It's his! 
{\ blur3.7} Ernesto de la Cruz. 
{\ blur3.7} The greatest musician
of all time. 
{\ blur3.7} TOUR GUIDE : Right here
in this very plaza,
{\ blur3.7}Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps...
{\ blur3.7}toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Mexican history.
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : He started out a total
nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. 
{\ blur3.7} But when he played music, he made
people fall in love with him. 
{\ blur3.7} 
He starred in movies. 
{\ blur3.7} He had the coolest guitar!
He could fly! 
{\ blur3.7} And he wrote the best songs. 
{\ blur3.7} But my alltime favorite,
it's... 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Remember me 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Remember me 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Though I have
to say goodbye 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Remember me
♪ Remember me 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you

Remember me 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Though I have

{\ blur3.7} ♪ Remember me

a sad guitar 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Know that I'm with you

{\ blur3.7} ♪ Until you're
in my arms again ♪ 
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : He lived the kind
of life you dream about. 
{\ blur3.7} Until 1942. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} When he was crushed
by a giant bell. 
{\ blur3.7} I want to be just like him. 
{\ blur3.7} Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz 
{\ blur3.7} and I get this feeling
like we're connected. 
{\ blur3.7} Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too. 
{\ blur3.7}If it wasn't for my family.
{\ blur3.7} Ayayay, muchacho. 
Huh?
{\ blur3.7}I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.
{\ blur3.7}Oh, yeah. Sorry.

{\ blur3.7}I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...
{\ blur3.7}If I were you,
{\ blur3.7}I'd march right up
to my family and say...
{\ blur3.7}"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it."
{\ blur3.7}I could never say that.
{\ blur3.7}You are a musician, no?
{\ blur3.7} I don't know.
{\ blur3.7}I mean, I only
really play for myself.
{\ blur3.7}Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician
{\ blur3.7}by hiding his skills?
{\ blur3.7}No! He walked out
onto that plaza
{\ blur3.7}and he played out loud.
{\ blur3.7} Mira, Mira, they're
setting up for tonight!
{\ blur3.7}The music competition
for Dia de Muertos. 
{\ blur3.7}You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!
{\ blur3.7}Uhuh.
My family would freak!
{\ blur3.7}Look, if you're too scared then,
well, have fun making shoes.
{\ blur3.7}Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?
{\ blur3.7}Seize your moment?
{\ blur3.7}Show me what you got, muchacho. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}I'll be your first audience.
{\ blur3.7} ABUELITA ELENA : Miguel!

{\ blur3.7} Abuelita! 
What are you doing here?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}You leave my grandson alone.

{\ blur3.7} Dona, please!
{\ blur3.7}I was just getting
a shine. 
{\ blur3.7}I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?
{\ blur3.7}He was just
showing me his guitar.
{\ blur3.7} 
Shame on you.
{\ blur3.7}My grandson is a sweet little
Angelito Querido Cielito. 
{\ blur3.7}He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.
{\ blur3.7}You keep away from him.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Ay, pobrecito. 
Oh, estas bien, mijo. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}You know better than to
be here in this place!
{\ blur3.7}You will come home. Now.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}How many times have we told you?
{\ blur3.7}That plaza is
crawling with mariachis.
{\ blur3.7}Yes, Tio Berto.

{\ blur3.7}No, no, no, no, no!
Ah! Go away, you. Go!
{\ blur3.7}It's just Dante.

{\ blur3.7}Never name a street dog.
{\ blur3.7}They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.
{\ blur3.7}I found your son
in Mariachi Plaza.
{\ blur3.7} Ay, Miguel!
{\ blur3.7}You know how Abuelita 
feels about the plaza.
{\ blur3.7}I was just shining shoes.
{\ blur3.7}A musician's shoes!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.
{\ blur3.7}If Abuelita says no more
plaza, then no more plaza.
{\ blur3.7}But what about tonight?
What's tonight?
{\ blur3.7}Well, they're having
this talent show.
{\ blur3.7} And I
thought I might...
{\ blur3.7}Sign up?
Well, maybe?
{\ blur3.7} You have to have
talent to be in a talent show.
{\ blur3.7}What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes? 
{\ blur3.7}It's Dia de los Muertos. 
{\ blur3.7}No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.
{\ blur3.7} 
Ofrenda room. Vamonos. 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7}Don't give me that look.
{\ blur3.7} Dia de los Muertos 
is the one night of the year
{\ blur3.7}our ancestors can come visit us.
{\ blur3.7}We've put their photos
on the ofrenda 
{\ blur3.7}so their spirits can cross over.
{\ blur3.7}That is very important.
{\ blur3.7}If we don't put them up,
they can't come.
{\ blur3.7}We made all this food,
{\ blur3.7}set out the things
they loved in life, mijo. 
{\ blur3.7}All this work
to bring the family together.
{\ blur3.7}I don't want you sneaking
off to who knows where.
{\ blur3.7} Where are you going?
{\ blur3.7} I thought
we were done.
{\ blur3.7} Ay, Dios mio. Being part
of this family means
{\ blur3.7}being here for this family.
{\ blur3.7}I don't want
to see you end up like...
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Like Mama Coco's papa? 
{\ blur3.7}Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.
{\ blur3.7}But you're the one who...

{\ blur3.7}I was just...

{\ blur3.7}But... I...

{\ blur3.7} Papa? Papa is home?
{\ blur3.7} Mama, calmese, calmese. 
{\ blur3.7} Papa is coming home?
{\ blur3.7}No, Mama. 
It's okay. I'm here.
{\ blur3.7}Who are you?
{\ blur3.7} Rest, Mama. 
{\ blur3.7}I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.
{\ blur3.7}Miguel? Miguel?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}What are we going
to do with that boy?
{\ blur3.7} You're right.
That's just what he needs.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} 
It's you. Get in here.
{\ blur3.7}Come on, Dante. Hurry up!
{\ blur3.7}You're gonna
get me in trouble, boy.
{\ blur3.7}Someone could hear me.
{\ blur3.7} I wish someone
wanted to hear me.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Other than you. Ew. Okay.
{\ blur3.7} 
Perfecto! 
{\ blur3.7} I have to sing.
I have to play! 
{\ blur3.7} The music, it's not
just in me, it is me. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} When life gets me down,
I play my guitar. 
{\ blur3.7} The rest of the world
may follow the rules, 
{\ blur3.7} but I must follow my heart. 
{\ blur3.7}Ugh!
{\ blur3.7} You know that feeling like
there's a song in the air and... 
{\ blur3.7} it's playing just for you? 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ A feeling so close... 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ You could
reach out and touch it 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ I never knew 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ I could want something
so much, but it's true ♪ 
{\ blur3.7} You must have faith, sister. 
{\ blur3.7} Oh, but, Padre,
he will never listen. 
{\ blur3.7} He will listen. To music. 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Only a song,
only a song 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Has the power
to change a heart ♪ 
{\ blur3.7} Never underestimate
the power of music. 
{\ blur3.7} NUN : But my father, he will
never give his permission. 
{\ blur3.7} DE LA CRUZ : I am done
asking permission. 
{\ blur3.7} When you see your moment, you
mustn't let it pass you by. 
{\ blur3.7} You must seize it! 
{\ blur3.7} INTERVIEWER : Senor de la Cruz, 
{\ blur3.7} what did it take for you
to seize your moment? 
{\ blur3.7} I had to have faith in my dream. 
{\ blur3.7} No one was going
to hand it to me. 
{\ blur3.7} It was up to me
to reach for that dream. 
{\ blur3.7} Grab it tight
and make it come true. 
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : And make it come true. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}I'm gonna play in Mariachi
Plaza if it kills me.
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} Dia de los Muertos has begun!
{\ blur3.7}No, no. We have to make
a clear path.
{\ blur3.7}The petals guide
our ancestors home.
{\ blur3.7}We don't want
their spirits to get lost.
{\ blur3.7}We want them to come
and enjoy all the food
{\ blur3.7}and drinks on the ofrenda. 
{\ blur3.7} PAPA : Mama! 

{\ blur3.7}Where should we put this table?
{\ blur3.7} ABUELITA ELENA : In the courtyard, mijos. 
{\ blur3.7} PAPA : You want it
down by the kitchen?
{\ blur3.7} Si. Next to the other one.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Get under! Get under!
Miguel?
{\ blur3.7}Nothing! Mama, Papa. I...
{\ blur3.7}Miguel, your abuelita had
the most wonderful idea.
{\ blur3.7}We've all decided. It's time
you joined us in the workshop!
{\ blur3.7}What?
No more shining shoes.
{\ blur3.7}You'll be making them
every day after school.
{\ blur3.7}Oh! Our Miguelitititito
{\ blur3.7}carrying on
the family tradition.
{\ blur3.7}And on Dia de los Muertos! 
{\ blur3.7}Your ancestors will be so proud.
{\ blur3.7}You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tia Victoria.
{\ blur3.7} PAPA : And wingtips
like your Papa Julio.
{\ blur3.7} But what if
I'm no good at making shoes?
{\ blur3.7}Ah, Miguel. You have your
family here to guide you.
{\ blur3.7}You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is...
{\ blur3.7}A shoemaker.
Through and through.
{\ blur3.7}That's my boy!
Berto!
{\ blur3.7}Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Dante! No, Dante. Stop!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}No, no, no, no, no! No.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}De la Cruz's guitar?
{\ blur3.7} Papa? Papa? 
{\ blur3.7} Mama Coco, is your papa 
Ernesto de la Cruz?
{\ blur3.7} Papa! Papa! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Papa! Papa! It's him!
{\ blur3.7}I know who my
greatgreatgrandfather was.
{\ blur3.7}Miguel, get down from there.
{\ blur3.7} Mama Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!
{\ blur3.7}What are you talking about?
{\ blur3.7}I'm gonna be a musician!
{\ blur3.7} ABUELITA ELENA : What is all this?
{\ blur3.7}You keep secrets
from your own family?
{\ blur3.7}It's all that time
he spends in the plaza.
{\ blur3.7}Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.
{\ blur3.7}It's not a fantasy.
{\ blur3.7}That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
{\ blur3.7}The greatest musician
of all time!
{\ blur3.7}We've never known anything
about this man!
{\ blur3.7}But whoever he was, he still
abandoned his family.
{\ blur3.7}This is no future for my son.
{\ blur3.7}But, Papa, you said
my family would guide me.
{\ blur3.7}Well, de la Cruz is my family.
{\ blur3.7}I'm supposed to play music.
{\ blur3.7}Never! That man's music
was a curse.
{\ blur3.7}I will not allow it.
{\ blur3.7}If you would just let...
Miguel...
{\ blur3.7}You will listen to your family.
{\ blur3.7}No more music.
{\ blur3.7}Just listen to me play!
End of argument.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}You want to end up
like that man? Forgotten?
{\ blur3.7}Left off your family's ofrenda? 
{\ blur3.7}I don't care if I'm on
some stupid ofrenda. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}No!
Mama! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}There. No guitar.
No music.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Oh, come. You'll feel better
after you eat with your family.
{\ blur3.7}I don't want
to be in this family!
{\ blur3.7}Miguel! Miguel!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz.
{\ blur3.7}Can I still sign up?
{\ blur3.7}You got an instrument?
{\ blur3.7} No. But if I
can borrow a guitar...
{\ blur3.7}Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.
{\ blur3.7} 
You find a guitar, kid,
{\ blur3.7}I'll put you on the list.
{\ blur3.7}Can I borrow your guitar?
Sorry, muchacho. 
{\ blur3.7}You guys have a spare guitar?
No.
{\ blur3.7}I need a guitar
just for a little bit.
{\ blur3.7}Get out of here, kid.

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Greatgreatgrandfather,
what am I supposed to do?
{\ blur3.7} 
No, no, no, no.
{\ blur3.7}Dante, stop! Callate! Shh!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7}I'm sorry.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} Senor de la Cruz,
please don't be mad.
{\ blur3.7} I'm Miguel.
{\ blur3.7}Your greatgreat grandson.
I need to borrow this.
{\ blur3.7} Our family thinks
music is a curse.
{\ blur3.7}None of them understand
but I know you would have.
{\ blur3.7}You would have told me
to follow my heart.
{\ blur3.7}To seize my moment!
{\ blur3.7}So, if it's all right with you,
{\ blur3.7}I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} MAN 1 : The guitar! It's gone!

{\ blur3.7} MAN 2 : Somebody stole
de la Cruz's guitar!
{\ blur3.7} WOMAN : The window's broken.
Look!
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7}All right, who's in there?
{\ blur3.7}I'm sorry.
It's not what it looks like.
{\ blur3.7}De la Cruz is my...
{\ blur3.7} 
There's nobody here.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} MAMA : Miguel!
Mama! 
{\ blur3.7}Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Dios mio! 
Little boy. Are you okay?
{\ blur3.7}Here. Let me help you.
{\ blur3.7}Thanks. I...
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Do you mind? Whoa!

{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Look how big she's getting.

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Dante!
{\ blur3.7}You can see me? Wait!

{\ blur3.7}What's going on? Dante!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Miguel?
{\ blur3.7}Miguel?
Miguel?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?
{\ blur3.7}Our Miguelitititito!

{\ blur3.7}Remind me how I know you.
{\ blur3.7}We're your family, mijo. 

{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Tia Rosita?
Si. 
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Papa Julio?
Hola. 
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Tia Victoria?
{\ blur3.7}He doesn't seem entirely dead.
{\ blur3.7} 
He's not quite alive either.
{\ blur3.7}We need Mama Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.
{\ blur3.7} Oye! It's Mama Imelda.
{\ blur3.7}She couldn't cross over.

{\ blur3.7}She's stuck!
On the other side!
{\ blur3.7} Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe?
{\ blur3.7}Oh. Hey, Miguel.

{\ blur3.7}I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.
{\ blur3.7}But if Mama Imelda
can't come to us...
{\ blur3.7}Then we are going to her.
Vamonos! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Whoa.
{\ blur3.7}Come on, Miguel.
It's okay.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Dante? Dante!
Dante, wait up!
{\ blur3.7}You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...
{\ blur3.7}This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.
{\ blur3.7}You thought we weren't?
Well, I don't know.
{\ blur3.7}I thought it might've been
one of those
{\ blur3.7}made up things
that adults tell kids.
{\ blur3.7}Like vitamins.
{\ blur3.7}Miguel,
vitamins are a real thing.
{\ blur3.7}Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.
{\ blur3.7} 
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...
{\ blur3.7} Ay! Santa Maria!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Are those...
Alebrijes! But those are...
{\ blur3.7} OSCAR : Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.
{\ blur3.7}They guide souls
on their journey.
{\ blur3.7}Watch your step. They
make caquitas everywhere.
{\ blur3.7} ANNOUNCER : Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead. 
{\ blur3.7} Please have all offerings
ready for reentry. 
{\ blur3.7}Welcome back.
Anything to declare?
{\ blur3.7}Some churros.
From my family.
{\ blur3.7} ARRIVALS AGENT : How wonderful. Next.
{\ blur3.7} ANNOUNCER : If you are
experiencing travel issues, 
{\ blur3.7} agents at
the Department of Family... 
{\ blur3.7} Reunions are
available to assist you. 
{\ blur3.7} DEPARTURES AGENT : Next family, please.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Oh! Your photos
are on your son's ofrenda. 
{\ blur3.7}Have a great visit.
{\ blur3.7} BOTH : Gracias. 
{\ blur3.7} ANNOUNCER : And remember
to return before sunrise. 
{\ blur3.7} Enjoy your visit. 
{\ blur3.7}Next.

{\ blur3.7}Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda. 
Enjoy your visit.
{\ blur3.7} Gracias. 
Next?
{\ blur3.7}Yes! It is I.
Frida Kahlo.
{\ blur3.7}Shall we skip the scanner?
{\ blur3.7}I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just
overwhelm your blinky thingy.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Well, shoot, looks like no one
put up your photo, Frida.
{\ blur3.7}Okay, when I said I was Frida,
just now, that was a lie.
{\ blur3.7}And I apologize for doing that.
{\ blur3.7}No photo on an ofrenda, 
no crossing the bridge.
{\ blur3.7}I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.
{\ blur3.7}Hey!

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Almost... there.
Just a little further.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Upsydaisy...
{\ blur3.7}Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!
{\ blur3.7}Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.
{\ blur3.7} ARRIVALS AGENT : Next?
Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn.
{\ blur3.7}Welcome back, amigos. 
Anything to declare?
{\ blur3.7}As a matter of fact, yes.

{\ blur3.7} Hola. 
{\ blur3.7} MALE ANNOUNCER :
Paging Marta GonzalesRamos. 
{\ blur3.7} Please report to Level Seven. 
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Whoa!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} I miss my nose.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Come on, help us out, amigo. 
{\ blur3.7}We got to get to
a dozen ofrendas tonight.
{\ blur3.7}We are not visiting your exwife's
family for Dia de Muertos! 
{\ blur3.7}I demand to speak
to the person in charge!
{\ blur3.7}I'm sorry, senora, it says
here no one put up your photo.
{\ blur3.7}My family always puts my
photo on the ofrenda. 
{\ blur3.7}That devil box tells
you nothing but lies!
{\ blur3.7} Mama Imelda? 
Oh, mi familia! 
{\ blur3.7}They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.
{\ blur3.7}Tell this woman
and her devil box
{\ blur3.7}that my photo is on the ofrenda. 
{\ blur3.7} Well, we never
made it to the ofrenda. 
{\ blur3.7}What?
We ran into... 
{\ blur3.7} Miguel?
Mama Imelda.
{\ blur3.7}What is going on?
{\ blur3.7}You the Rivera family?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Well, you're cursed.
{\ blur3.7} 
What?
{\ blur3.7} Dia de los Muertos is the
night to give to the dead.
{\ blur3.7}You stole from the dead!
{\ blur3.7}But I wasn't
stealing the guitar.
{\ blur3.7}Guitar?
{\ blur3.7}It was my
greatgreatgrandfather's.
{\ blur3.7}He would have
wanted me to have it.
{\ blur3.7}Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak
of that musician.
{\ blur3.7}He is dead to this family.
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : Uh,
you're all dead.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}I am sorry.
Whose alebrije is that?
{\ blur3.7}That's just Dante.
{\ blur3.7}He sure doesn't
look like an alebrije.
{\ blur3.7}He just looks
like a plain old dog.
{\ blur3.7}Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.
{\ blur3.7}Whatever he is, I am
terribly allergic.
{\ blur3.7}But Dante doesn't have any hair.
{\ blur3.7}And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.
{\ blur3.7}Oh! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}You took my photo
off the ofrenda? 
{\ blur3.7}It was an accident!
How do we send him back?
{\ blur3.7} Well,
since it's a family matter...
{\ blur3.7}the way to undo a family curse
{\ blur3.7}is to get your family's blessing.
That's it?
{\ blur3.7}Get your family's blessing
{\ blur3.7}and everything should
go back to normal.
{\ blur3.7}But you got to do it by sunrise.
{\ blur3.7} 
What happens at sunrise?
{\ blur3.7} Hijole! Your hand!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Whoa, Miguel, can't have
you fainting on us.
{\ blur3.7} But not to worry.
Your family's here.
{\ blur3.7}You can get
your blessing right now.
{\ blur3.7} Cempasuchil, cempasuchil. 
Aha! Perdon, senora. 
{\ blur3.7}Oh. 
{\ blur3.7}Now, you look at the living
and say his name.
{\ blur3.7}Miguel.
{\ blur3.7}Nailed it. Now say,
"I give you my blessing."
{\ blur3.7}I give you my blessing.
{\ blur3.7}I give you my blessing
to go home...
{\ blur3.7}to put my photo
back on the ofrenda, 
{\ blur3.7}and to never play music again.
{\ blur3.7}What? She can't do that!
{\ blur3.7}Well, technically, she can
add any condition she wants.
{\ blur3.7} Fine.
{\ blur3.7} CLERK : Then you hand
the petal to Miguel.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}No skeletons!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Mariachi Plaza, here I come.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Two seconds and you already
break your promise.
{\ blur3.7}This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.
{\ blur3.7} Papa Julio,
I ask for your blessing.
{\ blur3.7} 
Tia Rosita? Oscar?
{\ blur3.7} 
Felipe? Tia Victoria?
{\ blur3.7}Don't make this hard, mijo. 
You go home my way or no way.
{\ blur3.7}You really hate music that much?
{\ blur3.7}I will not let you go down
the same path he did.
{\ blur3.7}The same path he did.
He's family.
{\ blur3.7}Listen to your Mama Imelda.
{\ blur3.7}She's just looking out for you.
{\ blur3.7}Be reasonable.
{\ blur3.7} Con permiso, 
I need to visit the restroom.
{\ blur3.7}Be right back.
{\ blur3.7}Uh, should we tell him
there are no restrooms
{\ blur3.7}in the Land of the Dead?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Vamonos. 
{\ blur3.7} PATROLWOMAN : We got a family
looking for a living boy.
{\ blur3.7}If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.
{\ blur3.7}We got to find
my greatgreatgrandpa.
{\ blur3.7}Hold it, muchacho. 

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}I found that living boy!
{\ blur3.7}Oh, whoa, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.
{\ blur3.7}Excuse me.
{\ blur3.7}Oh.
{\ blur3.7}No, no. Dante!
{\ blur3.7}Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.
{\ blur3.7}Falsifying a unibrow.
{\ blur3.7}That's illegal?
Very illegal.
{\ blur3.7}You need to clean up
your act, amigo. 
{\ blur3.7} Amigo? Oh, that's so nice
to hear you say that
{\ blur3.7}because I have just had a...
{\ blur3.7}really hard Dia de Muertos 
and I could really use
{\ blur3.7}an amigo right now.

{\ blur3.7}And amigos, 
they help their amigos. 
{\ blur3.7}You get me across
that bridge tonight,
{\ blur3.7}and I'll make it
worth your while.
{\ blur3.7}Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.
{\ blur3.7}I can get you front row seats to
his Sunrise Spectacular show.
{\ blur3.7}I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.
{\ blur3.7}You just got to let me
cross that bridge!
{\ blur3.7}I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.
{\ blur3.7}But my shift's almost up and I
want to visit my living family.
{\ blur3.7}So I'm letting you off
with a warning.
{\ blur3.7}Can I at least
get my costume back?
{\ blur3.7}Uh... No.
{\ blur3.7} Some amigo. 
{\ blur3.7}Hey! Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?
{\ blur3.7}Who wants to... Ahh!
Ay! You're alive!
{\ blur3.7}Shh! Yeah, I'm alive.
{\ blur3.7}And if I want to get back
to the Land of the Living...
{\ blur3.7}I need de la Cruz's blessing.
{\ blur3.7}That's weirdly specific.
{\ blur3.7}He's my
greatgreatgrandfather.
{\ blur3.7} 
He's your Gr... What?
{\ blur3.7}Ugh.
{\ blur3.7}Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. 
{\ blur3.7}Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.
{\ blur3.7}Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!
{\ blur3.7}You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...
{\ blur3.7}No, no, nino! Nino, nino, I can help you.
You can help me.
{\ blur3.7}We can help each other.
{\ blur3.7}But most importantly,
you can help me.
{\ blur3.7}Miguel!
I'm Hector.
{\ blur3.7}That's nice.

{\ blur3.7} Esperame, chamaco! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Ay, he is going
to get himself killed.
{\ blur3.7}I need my spirit guide...
Pepita. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Who has that petal
Miguel touched?
{\ blur3.7} 
Here. Nice alebrije.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver. 
Look up, up, up.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Aqui arriba, eso... 
Eh, la rayita. 
{\ blur3.7}Okay. Hey! Tada!
{\ blur3.7}Dead as a doorknob.
{\ blur3.7}So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.
{\ blur3.7}When you're well remembered,
{\ blur3.7}people put up your photo
and you get to...
{\ blur3.7}cross the bridge
and visit the living
{\ blur3.7}on Dia de Muertos. 
Unless you're me.
{\ blur3.7}You don't get to cross over?
{\ blur3.7}No one's ever put up my picture.
{\ blur3.7}But you can change that!
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : This is you?
{\ blur3.7}Eh, muy guapo, eh?
{\ blur3.7}So, you get me
to my greatgreatgrandpa...
{\ blur3.7}then I put up your photo
when I get home?
{\ blur3.7}Such a smart boy! Yes!
Great idea, yes! One hiccup.
{\ blur3.7}De la Cruz is
a tough guy to get to
{\ blur3.7}and I need to
cross the bridge soon.
{\ blur3.7}Like, tonight.
{\ blur3.7}So, you got any other
family here, you know?
{\ blur3.7}Someone a bit more,
eh, accessible?
{\ blur3.7}Mmm... Nope.
{\ blur3.7}Don't yank my chain, chamaco. 
{\ blur3.7}You got to have
some other family.
{\ blur3.7}Only de la Cruz.
{\ blur3.7}If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Oh! Okay. Okay, kid.
Fine! Fine!
{\ blur3.7}I'll get you to your
greatgreatgrandpa.
{\ blur3.7}It's not gonna
be easy, you know?
{\ blur3.7}He's a busy man.
What are you doing?
{\ blur3.7}I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.
{\ blur3.7}No. Skeletons
don't walk like that.
{\ blur3.7}It's how you walk.
No, I don't! Stop it!
{\ blur3.7}Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular?
{\ blur3.7} Que padre! 

{\ blur3.7}Every year your greatgreatgrandpa
puts on that dumb show...
{\ blur3.7}to mark the end
of Dia de Muertos. 
{\ blur3.7}And you can get us in!
Um...
{\ blur3.7}Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!
{\ blur3.7}That... was a lie.
I apologize for that.
{\ blur3.7}Cool off, chamaco. 
Come on. I'll get you to him.
{\ blur3.7}How?
{\ blur3.7}Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.
{\ blur3.7} DE LA CRUZ : ♪ Remember me
Don't let it make you cry ♪ 
{\ blur3.7} You better have
my dress, Hector.
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : Hola, Ceci.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Hola. 
Ceci, I lost the dress.
{\ blur3.7} Ya lo sabia! 
{\ blur3.7}I got to dress
forty dancers by sunrise.
{\ blur3.7}Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!
{\ blur3.7}Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7}No, no, Dante! Ven aca! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}You! How did you
get in here?
{\ blur3.7}I just followed my...
Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!
{\ blur3.7}Guider of wandering spirits.
{\ blur3.7}And whose spirit
have you guided to me?
{\ blur3.7}I don't think
he's a spirit guide.
{\ blur3.7}Ah, ah, ah.
{\ blur3.7}The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.
{\ blur3.7}They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.
{\ blur3.7}You are the audience.
Darkness.
{\ blur3.7}And from the darkness,
a giant papaya.
{\ blur3.7}Dancers emerge from the papaya,
{\ blur3.7}and the dancers are all me.
{\ blur3.7}And they go to drink from
the milk of their mother,
{\ blur3.7}who is a cactus.
{\ blur3.7}But who is also me.
{\ blur3.7}And her milk is
not milk but tears.
{\ blur3.7}Is it too obvious?
{\ blur3.7}I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?
{\ blur3.7}It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Oh! And then it could go...
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}And what if
everything was on fire?
{\ blur3.7} 
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!
{\ blur3.7}Inspired! You have
the spirit of an artist.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}The dancers exit. The music
fades, the lights go out.
{\ blur3.7}And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Huh?
{\ blur3.7}He does a couple of songs, the
sun rises, everyone cheers...
{\ blur3.7}Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?
{\ blur3.7}Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!
{\ blur3.7}He's too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Chamaco, you can't run off
on me like that.
{\ blur3.7}Stop pestering the celebrities.
{\ blur3.7}You said my greatgreatgrandpa
would be here!
{\ blur3.7}He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.
{\ blur3.7}That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?
{\ blur3.7}If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?
{\ blur3.7}He's your greatgreatgrandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?
{\ blur3.7}Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?
{\ blur3.7} 
It's the hot ticket!
{\ blur3.7}But if you're not
on the guest list,
{\ blur3.7}you're never
getting in, Chorizo. 
{\ blur3.7}Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito! 

{\ blur3.7}Aha. Very funny, guys.
Very funny.
{\ blur3.7} Chorizo? 
{\ blur3.7}Oh, this guy's famous!
{\ blur3.7}Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.
{\ blur3.7}I don't want to talk about it.
{\ blur3.7}He choked on some chorizo! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}I didn't choke, okay?
{\ blur3.7}I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}This is why
I don't like musicians.
{\ blur3.7}Bunch of
selfimportant jerks.
{\ blur3.7}Hey! I'm a musician!
You are?
{\ blur3.7}If you really want
to get to Ernesto,
{\ blur3.7}there is that
music competition...
{\ blur3.7}at the Plaza de la Cruz.
{\ blur3.7}Winner gets
to play at his party.
{\ blur3.7}No, no. Chamaco, 
you're loco if you think...
{\ blur3.7}I need to get my
greatgreatgrandfather's blessing!
{\ blur3.7}You know where
I can get a guitar?
{\ blur3.7} I know a guy.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} ROSITA : A footprint!
It's a Rivera boot.
{\ blur3.7}Size seven!
And a half.
{\ blur3.7}Pronated.
Miguel.
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : Why the heck would
you want to be a musician?
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : My greatgreatgrandpa
was a musician!
{\ blur3.7}Who spent his life
performing like a monkey
{\ blur3.7}for complete strangers.
{\ blur3.7} No thank you.
No! Guacala! 
{\ blur3.7} 
What do you know?
{\ blur3.7}So, how far is
this guitar anyway?
{\ blur3.7}We're almost there.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Keep up, chamaco. Come on.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} ALL : Cousin Hector!
Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio! 
{\ blur3.7} ¿Que onda? 
{\ blur3.7}These people are
all your family?
{\ blur3.7}Uh...
{\ blur3.7}In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas. 
{\ blur3.7}No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?
{\ blur3.7}So, we all call each other
cousin, or tio, or whatever.
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7}Hector!
Tia Chelo!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Muchas gracias! 
{\ blur3.7}Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharron around?
{\ blur3.7} CHELO : Eh, in the bungalow.
{\ blur3.7}I don't know if he's in
the mood for visitors.
{\ blur3.7} Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Hector?
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} Buenas noches, Chicharron!
{\ blur3.7}I don't want to see
your stupid face, Hector.
{\ blur3.7}Come on.
It's Dia de Muertos. 
{\ blur3.7}I brought you a little offering.
{\ blur3.7}Get out of here.
I would, Cheech.
{\ blur3.7}But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...
{\ blur3.7}We really need
to borrow your guitar.
{\ blur3.7}My guitar?
Yes.
{\ blur3.7}My prized beloved guitar?
{\ blur3.7}I promise
we'll bring it right back.
{\ blur3.7}Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?
{\ blur3.7}Uh...
Or my minifridge?
{\ blur3.7}Ah, you see...
Or my good napkins?
{\ blur3.7}My lasso? My femur?
{\ blur3.7}Well, no, not like those times.
{\ blur3.7}Where is my femur?
You... 
{\ blur3.7}Whoa, whoa.
{\ blur3.7}You okay, amigo? 
I'm fading, Hector.
{\ blur3.7}I can feel it.
{\ blur3.7}I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.
{\ blur3.7}You play me something.
{\ blur3.7}No. You know
I don't play anymore, Cheech.
{\ blur3.7}The guitar is for the kid.
{\ blur3.7}You want it, you got to earn it.
{\ blur3.7} Ay, only for you, amigo. 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Any requests?
{\ blur3.7}

{\ blur3.7}He's been forgotten.

in the living world
{\ blur3.7}who remembers you...
{\ blur3.7}you disappear from this world.
{\ blur3.7}We call it the final death.
{\ blur3.7} Where did he go?
{\ blur3.7}No one knows.
{\ blur3.7}But I've met him. I could
remember him when I go back!
{\ blur3.7}No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco. 
{\ blur3.7}Our memories,
they have to be passed down
{\ blur3.7}by those who knew us in life...

they tell about us.
{\ blur3.7}But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.
{\ blur3.7}Hey, it happens
to everyone eventually.
{\ blur3.7}Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.
{\ blur3.7} MIGUEL : You told me
you hated musicians.
{\ blur3.7}You never said you were one.
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : How do you think I
knew your greatgreatgrandpa?
{\ blur3.7}We used to play music together.
{\ blur3.7}Taught him everything he knows.
{\ blur3.7} No manches! You played
with Ernesto de la Cruz...
{\ blur3.7}the greatest musician
of all time?
{\ blur3.7} Ah, you're funny.
{\ blur3.7}Greatest eyebrows
of all time maybe.
{\ blur3.7}But his music?
Eh, not so much.
{\ blur3.7}You don't know
what you're talking about.
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : Welcome
to the Plaza de la Cruz!
{\ blur3.7}Showtime, chamaco! 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Llevelo! 
Tshirts! Bobbleheads!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} Bienvenidos a todos! 
{\ blur3.7}Oh! 
{\ blur3.7}Who's ready for some musica? 

{\ blur3.7}It's a battle
of the bands, amigos. 
{\ blur3.7}The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself,
{\ blur3.7}Ernesto de la Cruz...
{\ blur3.7}at his fiesta tonight!
{\ blur3.7}That's our ticket, muchacho. 
{\ blur3.7}Oh! Oh, oh, oh!
{\ blur3.7}Let the competition begin!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?
{\ blur3.7}Definitely Remember Me. 
{\ blur3.7}No! Not that one. No.
{\ blur3.7}Come on.
It's his most popular song!
{\ blur3.7}Ah, it's too popular.
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Remember me

{\ blur3.7} ♪ Remember me... ♪ 
{\ blur3.7} ♪ Don't let it

{\ blur3.7}

{\ blur3.7}What about Poco Loco? 
Epa! Now that's a song!
{\ blur3.7}De la Cruzcito?
You're on standby.
{\ blur3.7}Los Chachalacos, you're up next.
{\ blur3.7} ALL : Los Chachalacos!
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7}You always this nervous
before a performance?
{\ blur3.7}I don't know. 
I've never performed before.
{\ blur3.7}What? You said
you were a musician!
{\ blur3.7} I am!
I mean, I will be.
{\ blur3.7} Ay! 
Once I win.
{\ blur3.7}That's your plan?
No. You have to win.
{\ blur3.7}Your life
literally depends on...
{\ blur3.7}you winning. And you've
never done this before!
{\ blur3.7}I'll go up there.
{\ blur3.7}No! I need to do this.
Why?
{\ blur3.7}If I can't go out
and play one song,
{\ blur3.7}how can I call
myself a musician?
{\ blur3.7}What does that matter?
{\ blur3.7}Because I don't just want to
get de la Cruz's blessing...
{\ blur3.7}I need to prove
that I'm worthy of it.
{\ blur3.7}Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment
{\ blur3.7}at such a bad time!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Okay! Okay.
You want to perform?
{\ blur3.7}Then you got to perform!
{\ blur3.7}First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Now give me your best grito. 
{\ blur3.7}My best grito? 
Come on, yell! Belt it out.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Ah, it feels good.
Okay, now you.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Oh, come on, kid.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}

{\ blur3.7}Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.
{\ blur3.7}They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.
{\ blur3.7}Wait, wait.
{\ blur3.7}You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

who could send you home.

I need a musician's blessing.

{\ blur3.7}Uh, I just met him tonight.

{\ blur3.7} Hector?
{\ blur3.7}Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.
{\ blur3.7}My friend,
you're being forgotten.
{\ blur3.7}And whose fault is that?
Hector, please...
{\ blur3.7}Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.
{\ blur3.7}What?
{\ blur3.7}If I'm being forgotten,
it's because you never
{\ blur3.7}told anyone that I wrote them!
{\ blur3.7}That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.
{\ blur3.7}You want to tell him
or should I?
{\ blur3.7}Hector, I never meant
to take credit.
{\ blur3.7}We made a great team,
but you died...
{\ blur3.7}and I only sang your songs
{\ blur3.7}because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.
{\ blur3.7}Oh, how generous!
{\ blur3.7}You really did play together.
{\ blur3.7}I don't want to fight about it.
{\ blur3.7}I just want you
to make it right.
{\ blur3.7}Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.
{\ blur3.7}I can see my girl.
{\ blur3.7}Ernesto,
remember the night I left?
{\ blur3.7}That was a long time ago.
{\ blur3.7}We drank together
and you told me
{\ blur3.7}you would move
Heaven and Earth...
{\ blur3.7}for your amigo. 
Well, I'm asking you to now.
{\ blur3.7}Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?
{\ blur3.7}What?
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.
{\ blur3.7}In the de la Cruz movie,
El Camino a Casa. 
{\ blur3.7}I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.
{\ blur3.7}No! It's in there. Look!
{\ blur3.7} DON : Never were
truer words spoken. 
{\ blur3.7} This calls for a toast.
To our friendship! 
{\ blur3.7} I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo.
{\ blur3.7}But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.
{\ blur3.7} DON : Salud!
Poison! 
{\ blur3.7}That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...
{\ blur3.7} We'd been performing
on the road for months. 
{\ blur3.7} I got homesick... 
{\ blur3.7} and I packed up my songs. 
{\ blur3.7}You want to give up now
{\ blur3.7}when we're this close
to reaching our dream?
{\ blur3.7}This was your dream.
You'll manage.
{\ blur3.7}I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.
{\ blur3.7}I'm going home, Ernesto.
{\ blur3.7}Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,
{\ blur3.7}then I'm sending you off
with a toast.
{\ blur3.7}To our friendship.
{\ blur3.7}I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud! 
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : You walked me
to the train station. 
{\ blur3.7} But I felt a pain in my stomach. 
{\ blur3.7} I thought it must have been
something I ate. 
{\ blur3.7}Perhaps it was
that chorizo, my friend.
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : Or something I drank. 
{\ blur3.7} I woke up dead. 
{\ blur3.7}You poisoned me.
{\ blur3.7}You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.
{\ blur3.7}All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : I never thought that
you might have... That you... 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7}How could you?
Hector!
{\ blur3.7}Security! Security!
{\ blur3.7}You took everything
away from me! You rat!
{\ blur3.7}Have him taken care of.
He's not well.
{\ blur3.7}I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!
{\ blur3.7} I apologize.
Where were we?

your blessing.
{\ blur3.7}Yes. Uh, Si.

{\ blur3.7} It is
very important to me.
{\ blur3.7}I would hate
to have you think...
{\ blur3.7}That you murdered Hector
for his songs?
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}You don't think that.
Do you?
{\ blur3.7} I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.
{\ blur3.7} Papa Ernesto, my blessing?
{\ blur3.7}Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.
{\ blur3.7}What? But I'm your family!
{\ blur3.7}And Hector was my best friend.
{\ blur3.7}Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.
{\ blur3.7}You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes
{\ blur3.7}to seize your moment.

{\ blur3.7}I know you understand.
{\ blur3.7}No! No!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Let go! No!
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}

{\ blur3.7}I want to go home.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7} 

{\ blur3.7} Hector?
Kid?
{\ blur3.7}Oh, Hector!
You were right.
{\ blur3.7}I should have gone
back to my family.
{\ blur3.7}They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,
{\ blur3.7}but I didn't listen.
{\ blur3.7}I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.
{\ blur3.7}I didn't care if I was
on their stupid ofrenda. 
{\ blur3.7}Hey, chamaco. 
It's okay. It's okay.
{\ blur3.7}I told them I didn't care.
{\ blur3.7} 
{\ blur3.7}Hector! Hector?
{\ blur3.7}She's forgetting me.
{\ blur3.7}Who?
My daughter.
{\ blur3.7}She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.
{\ blur3.7}I just wanted to see her again.
{\ blur3.7}I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.
{\ blur3.7}I wish I could apologize.
{\ blur3.7}I wish I could tell her that her
papa was trying to come home.
{\ blur3.7}That he loved her so much.
{\ blur3.7}My Coco...
{\ blur3.7}Coco?
{\ blur3.7}Where did you get this?
{\ blur3.7}That's my Mama Coco.
That's my Mama Imelda.
{\ blur3.7}Is that you?
{\ blur3.7}We're...
Family?
{\ blur3.7} HECTOR : I always hoped
I'd see her again.
{\ blur3.7}That she'd miss me.
{\ blur3.7}Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.
{\ blur3.7}You know the worst part?
{\ blur3.7}Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...
{\ blur3.7}I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.
{\ blur3.7}Give her the biggest hug.
{\ blur3.7}But she's the last person
who remembers me.
{\ blur3.7}The moment she's gone
from the living world...
{\ blur3.7}You disappear...
from this one.
{\ blur3.7}You'll never get to see her.
{\ blur3.7}Ever again.
{\ blur3.7}You know,

night at the same time.

{\ blur3.7}you will return home?

{\ blur3.7}I might know a way.

Send Miguel home.
{\ blur3.7}Got your petals?

{\ blur3.7}Now, we just
have to find de la Cruz.
{\ blur3.7}Yes?

{\ blur3.7}Don't I know you?
{\ blur3.7}That's for murdering
the love of my life!
{\ blur3.7}Who... Who the...
She's talking about me!
{\ blur3.7}I'm the love of your life?
{\ blur3.7}I don't know.
I'm still angry at you.
{\ blur3.7}Hector!
How did you... 
{\ blur3.7}And that's for trying
to murder my grandson.
{\ blur3.7}Grandson?
She's talking about me!
{\ blur3.7}You! Wait.
You're related to Hector?
{\ blur3.7}The photo!
{\ blur3.7}Uh...

I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

{\ blur3.7} You're just the guy
who murdered him
