nice landing,
Uncle Bene. 
Right on the 
50yard line. 
should've gone 
for a touchdown. 
Next time, I'll put it 
right between the goalposts. 
can't wait to see 
the museums and go to 
all the concerts. 
that's why we arranged 
this little vacation. 
We've been so busy establishing
our community on Witch Mountain
That you two haven't had 
an opportunity 
To see what life 
in the big city is all about. 
I'd rather go to the beach 
and learn how to surf. 
there'll be 
another time for that. 
Just remember what I told you, 
and have a lot of fun. 
It's locked. 
Tia? 
Tony, come back here. 
Now, never energize unless 
it's absolutely necessary. 
Tia? 
If earth kids can live here 
without energizing, you can too.


You the party 
I'm supposed to pick up? 
just the children. 
All right. 
Meter's running, hop in. 
I got it. 

I've been 
waiting here forever. 
You know, people wait for taxis,
not taxis wait for people. 
We're exactly 
on time. 
Yeah, well, kind of a 
strange time and place 
to be making a pick up. 
I mean, if you're here for the 
next game, it's in three months.
We have seats 
on the 50yard line.

Deliver the children
to this address. 
You'll be paid 
after you arrive. 
This is a big fare here. 
If these kids pay me, I hope 
they know I get a big tip. 
Now, everything's been arranged.
I'll see you Friday. 
Ok. Goodbye, Uncle Bene. 
Goodbye. 
Have fun, you two. 



Look at that dummy. 

Get off the road, 
you dummy. 

These civilians 
don't know how to drive.
They ought to be 
kept off the streets. 
The streets belong 
to us professional drivers. 
Taxis, buses, trucks. 
That's all that should 
be allowed on the streets. 
You see, I happen to know 
a great deal about driving. 
I have a perfect safety record. 

Come on, get out 
of the way, you bum.


thank you. 
Thank you, sickle. 
Well, this is 
a perfect test site. 
Little traffic... 
...And low 
real estate value. 
It's adequate, 
I suppose. 
Ok, let's get this over with. 
This thing on all right? 
It's ready.
What do you want him 
to do this time? 
I want you to 
climb that fire escape... 
...To the absolute top. 
Wait a minute. 
Uhuh. 
This is as high as I go. 
You want me to 
break somebody's leg? 
Just tell me how many pieces. 
But up there, I don't go. 
Why not? 
Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy. 
I will fall. 
That is true, Victor. 
He has acrophobia... 
...Among other things. 
Find a different test for him. 
Acrophobia is not 
a problem with my device. 
Start climbing. 
I will do anything else you say,
But I am not going 
up that building, understand? 
I... 
Sickle... 
...I command you 
to climb up that fire escape. 
You will go 
to the very top,
You will turn around, 
and you will look down.
And you will not 
be frightened of heights. 
Off you go.
It's working. 
It's working! 
It seems to be. 
Victor. Victor, 
you are risking his life. 
He's my nephew. 
My only living relative. 
He's the only one 
I can leave my... 
...Uh, my bankruptcy to. 
That's what experimentation
is all about, Letha. 
we cannot 
afford to lose him. 
I am the only one 
we cannot afford to lose. 
Can't you see that I've got 
complete control over his mind?
He has no fear, 
no memory, no will.
He can only 
carry out my commands. 

what... What's happening? 
We're out of gas. 
What are you, crazy? Look at 
the dial, it points to... Empty.
Empty? 


It was all that waiting
I had to do for youse. 
I'll run down the street to the
gas station and get some gas. 
Boy, oh, boy. 
You guys are costing me
a lot of dough. 
I sure hope you 
make the tip worth it. 
Something's going to happen 
to someone near here. 
We've got to help. 
No, I think you'd better stay 
here and wait for the driver. 
I'll go. 
I think it came from 
back that way. 
Be careful.
And remember what 
Uncle Bene said. 
That is enough. 
Bring him down! 
sickle, 
turn to your right. 
Balance yourself 
And walk along 
the ledge. 
Victor, no.
Stop. 
I'll bring him down myself. 
Give that to me. 

Look what 
you've done.

Sickle, stop. 
Sickle, I'm 
commanding you to stop. 
Sickle, this is Dr. Victor 
Gannon commanding you to stop! 
He's out of control. 
sickle! 
Go back! 
sickle! 
No! 
Letha... Look. 
I can't look. 
You must. 

it's miraculous.
There are 
no miracles, Letha. 
Only scientific explanations 
for everything. 
Well, then, just explain to me 
what we're seeing. 
It... Must be... 
...That... Boy. 
There's a... 
There's a force that... 
...Centers around that boy. 
A force capable 
of countermanding 
The basic physical law of... 
Gravity. 
Victor, I don't know 
what you're talking about. 
Molecular mobilization. 
I need that boy, Letha. 

I need him desperately. 
Now, just a minute. 
Brilliant, my boy. 
Brilliant. 
Congratulations, young man, 
for a fantastic... 
Well, whatever it was 
you just did, 
It was absolutely heroic. 
It was nothing, 
I just... 




get off 
the street! 
run! 
hide! 
here come 
the goon goons! 

let's get 'em! 

they run like chickens. 
more goons! 
we're trapped!
hide or they'll get ya.
Over here. 
it ain't no use 
hiding behind those trash cans. 
the earthquakes' 
got girls in their gang. 
Let's finish 'em. 
hey! 
now, where 
in the world did that come from?
It was a set up. 
Let's give it to 'em. 
Yeah. 

hey! 

That was an ambush! 

stop banging into me. 
I can't see. 

I can't get out. 
get me out. 
Get it off me. 
yeah! All right! 
Hey, you really saved us 
from getting wiped out. 
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's your name? 
Tia. 
I'm Rocky. 
I'm muscles. 
Crusher. 
And I'm dazzler. 
We're the earthquake gang. 
Does that scare you?
No. 
Aww. 
Let's change 
our name again. 
We gotta have 
a name that scares. 
Yeah. 
Hey. 
How'd you do what you done? 
Well, I really 
didn't do anything. 
Yeah. You a magician 
or something? 
No. 
You want to join our gang? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm looking for someone. 
Thanks anyway. 
Aw, sure. 
I guess you're like 
the rest of them. 
You've heard 
we're a nothing gang. 
Yeah, well we ain't 
always gonna be nothing. 
Someday we're gonna 
be the toughest. 
Take over the whole territory. 
Someday they're gonna run 
when they see us 
coming down the block. 
All right. 
It's just that 
I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to? 
He doesn't belong to any gang.

I never heard of a Guy 
that never belonged to a gang. 
I'm sure something's happened. 
I've got to find him. 
If anybody could find him, 
we could. 
I mean, we know 
this town inside out. 
Oh, would you? 
Hey, yeah, sure. 
Listen, you done us a big favor,
now we'll do it for you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
Hey, come on, let's go. 
That Tony sure 
made himself scarce.
We better walk you home. 
Where do you live? 
I... I was supposed to 
stay at a hotel. 
But I don't know 
which one. 
You could stay 
in our hideout. 
yeah! 
Thank you. 
We'll look 
for Tony tomorrow. 
If we aren't busy 
beating up goons. 
Yeah. 
Hey, it's yoyo. 
Get down. 
Come on, hide. 
Did he see us? 
I don't know. 
But he's coming this way. 
who is he? 
our worst enemy. 
He's worse than the goons. 
he's Mr. Yokomoto, 
the truant officer. 
He's trying to make us 
go back to school. 
let's go. 
yeah! 
That's our hideout.

when do 
the ghosts get here? 
don't say things
like that. 
This place could 
really scare ya. 

Come on. 
This is where we're gonna live 
when we run away from home. 
Yeah, you can't be tough
If you take orders from 
your mom or older sister. 
That's why 
we quit school. 
You can't be tough 
and educated, too. 
yeah. 
Tony! 
where? 
I had a contact with him. 
You... 
You calling on the spirits? 
Shh. 
She's weird. 
She's creepy. 
I... I ain't too sure 
I wanna meet this Tony. 
Shh! 
Tony, where are you? 
He's coming in again. 
I can only see a light. 
That's all. 
Now it's... Going black. 
Now it's... Completely gone. 

He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field
through his reflexes 
As he struggles 
to regain consciousness. 
His output is so great, 
That my machines aren't 
even capable of measuring it. 
But he's dangerous.
Once I have control 
of his brain, Letha, 
He will only 
be dangerous to others. 
I hope you realize that 
kidnapping's a criminal offense.
My experiments are more 
important than the law, Letha. 
With these receptors 
placed on certain people, 
Combined with 
this boy's powers, 
I could become one of the most 
influential men in the world. 
Oh, you are absolutely 
brilliant, professor. 
Now we can go ahead
with my plans, too.
Don't bother me with your plans.
They're empty, unimportant. 
A comment, perhaps, on you and 
the life you've been leading. 
Now, you look here,
Doctor, professor, 
physicist. Whatever you are.
I built this laboratory 
for you at great expense. 
I used every penny I had. 
Now, we've made a lot of plans 
and I won't let you upset them.
I want some money. Fast.
Letha, we are 
worlds apart. 
My mind is filled 
with large concepts. 
Mankind, the universe. 
You only worry about 
the horse that's 
running in the third race. 
Sure, I gamble... 
...But with my own money. 
You're the worst
kind of gambler.
You use 
other people's money
And want to keep all 
the winnings for yourself. 
Well, you can be sure 
of one thing, Victor. 
I'll be around to pick up 
the chips with you. 




We'll be back in the morning
with maps and breakfast. 
I'll bring an egg 
from my refrigerator. 
And I'll bring some
dayold bread. 
I'll bring some milk for you. 
Thank you. 
You're good friends. 
That's the trouble with us. 
We don't want to be good. 
We want to be bad. 
Yeah. 
Hey, uh, let's go, you guys. 
My mom's gonna yell at me. 
see you tomorrow, 
Tia. 
we'll find Tony 
tomorrow for sure. 
let's stay close 
together on the way out, guys. 

Good. 
This is 
professor Gannon...
...Commanding you 
to awaken. 

Tony! 
He's in some kind of a room. 
Like a hospital.
With machines 
and instruments and things.
Oh, that's easy. 
All we have to do 
is check all the hospitals. 
While we going around 
looking for a fight. 
Come on. 
you will now function 
exclusively under control. 
You will no longer 
think independently.
All thinking and reasoning 
will be done 
By the voice 
that commands you. 
Do you understand? 
Yes. 
What is your name? 
Tony. 
Where are you from? 
Witch mountain. 
Sounds like 
some hick town to me. 
How did you suspend 
Mr. Sickle in midair? 
By energizing matter. 
Do you mean to say that 
you can control molecular flow? 
Yes, sir. 
How did you learn to do this? 
I was born with the ability. 
I wish to see a demonstration 
of molecular flow. 
You are strapped
to the table. 
Unbuckle yourself 
and sit up. 
Power has come 
into our hands 
Which is centuries 
before its time. 
We must use it wisely. 
Well, what can 
you have him do?
Other than go around making
people's belts unbuckle. 
The possibilities are unlimited.
Oh, come on. It's just 
some gimmick, that's all. 
Tony... 
Mr. Sickle, 
whose life you saved, 
Doesn't seem 
to believe in you. 
Mr. Sickle 
needs convincing, Tony.


Hey, come on. 
Hey, get back! 
Get back! Get back! 
Don't. 

get back! 

I can see how that'd be a big 
hit at a scientific convention. 
But the bottom line is, 
how do we make money with it? 

I will demonstrate 
an industrial application. 
Come with me, Tony. 

Now, Tony, 
those wine casks...
Stack them... Neatly. 
Two glasses 
of burgundy, please.
To molecular 
mobilization. 
To molecular capitalization. 


hey, 
got any more clues? 
No. 
Nothing at all. 
It's so strange. 
We've been to every hospital 
and he's in none of them. 
It's like 
his mind's a blank.
He probably 
conked out somewhere. 
Don't listen to him. 
We'll find Tony for sure. 
Yeah, we'll turn 
the town upside down. 
Yeah. 
what're you doing? 
thinking. 
Thinking about us in 
a different place, such as... 
Las Vegas... 
...With Tony. 
Seven or eleven 
every time, right? 
A day at the races. 
All the long shots 
come in. 
you do have 
an imagination, after all. 
The possibilities 
with Tony are unlimited. 
For example, he stacked the wine
casks by just looking at them. 
If he can stack them, 
he can unstack them. 
The gold is on display 
at the museum. 
Protected by an impenetrable
security system. 
Just sitting there 
waiting for us... 
...To penetrate it.
Wait a minute. Us? 
You mean Gannon said it's ok 
to use the control on Tony? 
Professor Gannon is 
extremely busy being a genius. 
I own half the invention, 
Half of Tony, that means 
I own half of the profits. 
So far, the return on 
my investment has been 
half of zero. 
What about security. We'd 
need an army to pull it off. 
We'll have an army with us!
Tony. 

Tony? 
Tony? 
Tony, why can't I 
get through to you? 
Tony? 
I'll pick up the new 
transistors, make a few stops. 
Be back later on. 
don't worry.
Everything's 
under control. 
Tony. 
This is Letha wedge,
Commanding you 
to open your eyes. 
Now, stand up. 
We're going to the museum 
for education and profit. 

Tony and I will do 
a little... Sightseeing.

wait.
Gold! I see gold. 
Hey it's mine. 
Where is it? 
Hey, give it to me! 
No! 
A stagecoach. 
She must be tuned in 
on a western. 
Yeah. 
I see dummies. 
that's you. 
No. Old things. 
Clothing. 
Hey, he's at 
the salvation army.
Nah, they don't got stagecoaches
at the salvation army. 
They don't got gold,
neither. 
Wait a minute, 
wait a minute! 
We had one of them 
nothing school trips. 
To the museum. 
Yeah, they got 
a pile of gold.
And a stagecoach. 
They had to kick me out. 
We've got to go there. 
Come on, 
it's over here.



Now, Tony. 
We're going to create 
a little diversion. 
The stagecoach. 
I want you to roll it 
all around the museum. 

look out. 
watch it.
watch out for that thing, 
it's coming this way. 
Hey, where are 
the horses? 
I... Don't know.
Now cause total chaos. 
watch out.

Short circuit 
the control system. 



Oh, no. 
Letha! 
Letha! 



look out. 
get out of my way.


can't you put 
that thing out? 
Come on, take a shot. 
Move it. 
Now, Tony, 
Make a hole 
in the plastic shield. 
And it doesn't have to be neat. 
Tony, unstack the gold bars 
and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. 
move it buddy, move it. 
We gotta get out of here! 
Las Vegas, 
here we come. 
Oh! 
Look. 

Come on, 
follow me. 
Tony, make them 
go faster. 
watch out! 
Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha! 

hey! 

Look out, lady. 
Yeah, why don't you watch where 
you're going, you big dummy. 

look out, Eddie! 
Tony, what's happening? 
molecular flow reversing.
Are you doing this? 
No. 
Then who is? 
It would have to be
one of my people. 
There are more like you? 
Yes. 
Oh! Let's get out of here. 
Tony! 
Tony! 
Who's that? 
It's my sister.
My sister, Tia.
This is no time 
for a family reunion. 

Letha! 
Tony! 
you fool! 
How could you do this? 
not now. 


What's wrong? 
I don't know. 
I keep it running perfect. 
It's Tony's sister, she did it. 
She's as weird as he is. 
Tony, I command you to 
make this car run perfectly
And continuously without 
interference from your sister. 

I can't stop the car. 
Tony's energizing it. 
It's like your brother 
doesn't even know you. 
it's yoyo. Let's go! 
No. Don't run. 
You crazy? You don't want 
to go to that school. 
Please, trust me. 
Now, come on, hurry. 
hey, wait for me. 
come on, you guys. 
Get in there. 
Let's go! 
Come on, get in. 

I'm dreaming. 
You're surrendering 
to the board of education? 
Sir, you see that car 
going down the street? 
Yeah. 
My brother's in it. 
He ought to be going to school. 
You ought to catch up with him. 
Another truant? Oh, boy, 
we're gonna have a load. 
Hey, what happened? 
Good driving, yoyo. 
Yeah, that was neat. 
this bus 
can really move. 
Tony, look 
through the window.
The rear window.
That minibus 
is following us.
I command you to place 
obstacles in its path. 

City property. 
I've damaged city property.

they said 
these glasses were shatterproof.
Was that a bus or a bridge? 
They're still with us. 
Tony, you must stop her.
Man, that man was 
really buzzing. 
Am I still alive? 

They're gaining on us. 
She counteracts 
everything that Tony does. 
Tony, you've 
got to stop her.
We flew!

They must've flown.
Don't you 
dare try it. 
Sickle... Sickle, stop... 
Stop over that hill. 
Tony, cause the reflection 
of the sun on the rear window 
To magnify and 
shine so brightly 
That our pursuers'll
be blinded by it. 


come on, 
open the doors. 
I can't see. 
yeah. 
come on, let me out.
Everybody ok? 
yeah, sure. 
Oh, look what's happened
to city property. 
No... But I'm still 
gonna take you to school. 
Just soon as I... 
Come on. 

You jeopardized my life's work. 
My accountants' 
are desperate. 
You've proved yourself 
incompetent yet again. 
I don't even know if 
I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me? 
I trusted you enough 
To make my credit rating 
look like Swiss cheese. 
Don't tell me 
you don't trust me. 
We have to 
trust each other. 
Right. 
I trust everybody. 
Yes... 
Well, fortunately, 
I thought of something 
very spectacular 
Which will satisfy both of us 
in terms of prestige and money.
Well, you have the prestige, 
I'll take the money. 
But, before we celebrate 
your return to sanity, 
We'd better do something 
about Tony's sister. 
How did she know 
we were at the museum? 
I... 
I'm not certain.
Tony. 
How did your sister know 
that we were at the museum? 
Telepathy. 
She'll show up again
and ruin everything.
In that case, she will 
have to be, as you would say... 
...Scratched? 
Tia. 
Tia. 
Tia! 
what happened to you? 
I can't explain now. 
I've lost 
the power to energize. 
where are you? 
follow my voice path. 
Please! 
ok. Guide me. 

Tony, which way? 
this way. 

Which way, Tony? 
Which way? 
keep moving 
straight ahead. 
This is the house. 
Here, look. 
Come on. 

down here. 

Be quiet, Alfred, 
you silly thing. 
Tia! 
Tony! 


I've put her into a state 
of comatose neutralization.
hey, Tia. 
We got you some cold hotcakes. 
She ain't here. 
Hope she didn't go 
looking for Tony without us. 
Yeah, she needs us.
Tony? Crusher? 
Muscles? Rocky? 
Dazzler? 

Alfred. 
Alfred, 
what's the matter with me? 
Where am I? 
Alfred, find the earthquakes. 

Listen to me. 



what kind 
of place is that? 
that is an underground
plutonium processing plant. 
Translate that 
into financial terms. 
Plutonium is 
more valuable than gold. 
That's why 
I like scientists. 
They're always discovering 
new, expensive things. 
It is used in the explosive core
of nuclear missile warheads. 
I suppose you're 
going to have Tony 
Split an atom bomb 
or something. 
In effect... 
...Yes 
Well, I didn't count on
killing anybody. 
Especially not us. 
It will never go that far. 
They will pay 
anything to prevent it. 
This is the first step 
towards my becoming 
The most powerful man 
in the world. 
Ids, please. 
Take a powder. 

Tony. 
Those are the 
outer security scanners. 
Put them out of commission... 
...Permanently. 

The scanning systems
are malfunctioning. 
All right, let's run
a maintenance check.
Three million bucks, you'd think
these things would work right. 
Where to? 
Andy's place, know it? 
Yeah, sure. I know where 
everything is. Second and third?
fourth and market. 
That one. 
Hop in. 
I'm in a hurry. Could you... 

Don't worry. 

Have you there 
in a couple of minutes. 

Listen. 
Feel the power in this cab? 

it has lots of power. 
You know, everybody tells me, 
I ought to be a race driver. 
What do you think? 

Well, I think you're wrong. 
Don't worry about nothing, sir. 
I'm a very safe driver. 
Want me to tell you how safe? 

I'll tell you anyway. 
I've been driving a hack 
for 19 years and 11 months. 
And in all that time, I never 
even put one scratch on a cab. 
In fact, next month, 
They're gonna give me 
a gold safety award. 
What do you think of that? 

Boy, you don't like nothing. 
I sure hope 
you're a good tipper. 

I knew there was something about
you that didn't look right. 

hey! 
Hey! 
You owe me a fare! 

Officer, that goat's a guy. 
The goat? 
The guy became a goat 
when I'm driving. 
The guy? 
This magician 
beat me out of this fare. 
The magician? 
My perfect record. 
Record? Oh... Record. 
I ain't gonna get 
the gold safety award. 

hear that? That must be her. 

come on. 

help me. 
hey. Watch out. 

get him away. 

how'd you get in here? 
Hey, come on, 
get out of here. 
watch out! 
He's looking at me 
like he knows me. 
Hey, what do you want from me? 
Get away! 
He's got Tia's vest. 
Get him! 
Quick. 

we're going for coffee now. 

can I bring you a cup? 
May I see your ids, please?
Tony? 
Show him our id. 
What's happening? 
Why? 
Don't leave me up here. 
Open the door, 
Tony. 
You can't go in there 
without ids. 
Now seal it. 
How do I get down? 

Tia! 
Quick, let's get her out. 
Yeah. 
Phew, it smells. 

It's some kind 
of a gas. 
Come on. 

You ok now? 
Yes, thank you. 
This is some kind of... 
...Science place. 
How'd you get here? 
It was Tony. 
He was here.
I saw something! 
What was it? 
It's where Tony is. 
I'm sure of it! 
A big, round shape. 
A doughnut! 
He's eating a doughnut. 
No way! 
Is it like a ball? 
A great big ball? 
Yes. 
I know where he is. 
Let's go! 
Hurry, let's go. 

Oh, thank you. 
And thanks for everything. 
Come on, let's go. 
We are about 
to make scientific history. 
and some money,
too, I hope. 
You will shut down the complete 
cooling system of the furnace. 

It's a red light 
on the cooling system. 
It must be 
a circuit breaker. 
Restart the system. 
I can't get a restart. 
Hit the backup system. 
It's nogo on backup. 
Temperature increasing 
in the furnace. 
Get that coolant flowing. 

Furnace control. 
Control? 
You don't really think you're 
controlling anything, do you? 

who is this? 
this is 
Dr. Victor Gannon, 
And I have just shut down 
your cooling system. 
Ok, you've shut it down.
Get it back on again! 
Tell him how expensive 
it is to put it back on.
In exactly one hour, we shall be
serving grilled plutonium, 
Medium rare, to the 
atmosphere unless the 
following conditions are met. 
What conditions? 
Five million dollars 
in cash. 
A jet waiting at the airport. 
A safe escort, of course. 
And most important of all, 
You will announce 
that Dr. Victor Gannon 
Has achieved molecular control 
and mind control. 
And this is the first 
of a series of worldwide 
demonstrations of his power. 

How long does it take 
to count five million dollars? 





We'll have to pay them. 
Evacuate the immediate area. 
Put Los Angeles on alert. 

There's the 
big round ball. 
Is that it? 
No, it was bigger than that. 
Get outta here. 
Leave me alone. 
At least I tried. 
Hey, look. 
It's yoyo. 
Let's get out of here. 
Come on. 

Hey, yoyo. 
Don't you want to catch us? 
I don't trust him. 
He's probably using 
some psychology trick on us. 
Come on. 
hey, Mr. Yoyo, 
don't you want to catch us? 
It's not my job anymore.
They're coming down
to fire me... 
...For destroying 
city property. 
The only thing that works is the
radio. And it won't turn off. 
I was only trying 
to help you kids. 
Mr. Yokomoto, 
I'm sorry about 
everything that's happened. 
All I ever wanted in life 
Was all you kids that 
I put back in school, someday...
...Visit me and say, 
"thanks Mr. Yoyo, Yokomoto. 
If it wasn't for you 
forcing us to get an education,
We would've been bums." 
That's all I wanted. 
You see? 
I told you he was gonna... 
...Hit us with 
some of that heavy psychology. 
I mean, I feel guilty. 
bulletin 
from the plutonium plant. 
Unless the demands 
of the terrorists are met, 
The furnace will explode 
with the force of ten megatons. 
An official describes 
the atomic furnace controls 
as frozen in position, 
As if "the molecular flow..." 
that's Tony! 
The plant is being evacuated. 
That's where he is! 
We've got to go there. 
How? Take a bus? 
We'll go in this. 
Tia, the tires are flat. 
Come on. 


If it doesn't 
start cooling soon, 
The chain reaction 
will start. 
You hear that? 
In ten minutes,
This place is going to be 
a hole in the ground. 
Now, let's be reasonable. 
We have three and a half million
dollars in the control room. 
And the balance is on the way. 
It's a deal.
I do not compromise. 

Hey, what are you guys doing? 
nothing! Nothing! 
We're doing nothing. 
Hey, kids! 

How did these children 
get past security? 
Sir, the people destroying the 
furnace kidnapped my brother. 
If I could see him,
I might stop them. 
she can do it! 
She can do it. 

do what? 
Impossible, 
they're inside the room. 
They've sealed 
the door somehow. 
What part has to be fixed? 
The emergency cooling system. 
Where is it? 
Five levels down. 
But it's too late. We've already
begun to evacuate the plant. 
Tony's here, 
all right. 
Get me down. 
Thank you, thank you. 
Now, where are you going? 
In there. 
Oh, no. You can't go 
beyond this point without ids. 

Tony! 
Tia! 
I knew it. 
She'll spoil everything. 
I can just taste that money. 
We cannot let her 
take it away from us. 
Tony! 
Tony, from this moment 
you will no longer hear Tia. 
She cannot break through 
my power of control. 
Acknowledge. 
Tony, what's wrong? 
It's me, your sister. 
Try to remember me. 
Acknowledge. 
Tony? 
Yes, sir. 
Get those kids. 
She'll use some of those
molecules on us. 
I'll take care of her before 
she gets a Chance, you get them.
I can't get through. 
I don't know what 
they've done to his mind. 
We've got to find the emergency
cooling system ourselves. 
How do you spell cooling? 
Come on.
uhoh. 
whoa. 
look out. 

We've got to find 
the emergency switches. 
You two go that way, 
and you two go that way. 
Tony, we must 
eliminate Tia. 

You will cause that portable 
utility panel to run her down. 
Hey, Tia, come here. 

Come on. 
That ain't it, right? 
you found it! 
I knew it was it! 
But, it's spelt wrong. 
You guys get 
dazzler and muscles.
Ok. Come on. 

The rest of the money's
just arrived. 
All right. 
I'd better call Gannon. 
The cooling system's on. 
Switch it off. 
we lost it! 
What's going on down there? 
It's coming back. 
Gotcha! 
Tony, you must stop her. 
Tony, why are you 
doing these things?
Why are you using 
your powers against me? 
What's happened?
Tony...
...Pretend 
to remember Tia.
Lure her to the 
center of the room and... 
...Make that crane 
drop on her. 
Tia! 
I'm starting to remember. 
What was the 
matter with you?
I don't know, exactly... But... 
I need help. 
Don't go any closer. 
Why? What is it, Tony? 
Tony, stop it! 
Stop it, Tony, stop it!
Exert a force 
greater than hers. 
Why are you doing this, Tony? 
Stop. 
Crush her. 
Kill her! 
Crush her! 
Crush her! Crush her! 
Finish her!
Now! 

Tia. 
Where are we? 
What's happened? 

Ha! 

Tony. 
Tony, we can still do it. 
We can still make use 
of molecular control. 
Ok, doc, 
let's do it. 




Letha! 
Why don't we 
all go and have some... 
Some candy and, uh, 
sodas and ice cream? 

Next time...
...Next time I'll... 
Forget it. 
I've lost my faith in science. 

huh? 

sickle! 

Aunt Letha! 
Oh, aunt Letha. 
Help. 
aunt Letha? 
Aunt Letha? 
It's absolutely dreadful 
the way they bring up 
children these days. 
Come on. 

Tony, the bus won't run
without me in it. 
It's all my fault. 
It's such a mess. 
Well, I guess we'll 
just have to fix it. 
I'm sure Uncle Bene
won't mind. 
I'll do the engine. 
You do the body work. 
Ok. 
So long, Alfie. 
Goodbye, Alfred. 


What job will you do now, 
Mr. Yoyo, uh, Yokomoto? 
Oh, I've saved my money. 
I'll probably open 
a Japanese delicatessen. 

hey, kids, look. 
I don't understand this. 
Man! 
Wow, what a family. 
The molecules must have 
rearranged themselves... 
...Somehow. 
Uh, that's a possibility. 
You know what this means? 
They never saw the wreck. 
I'll tell them that the reports
were exaggerated. 
And, if you kids 
will go back to school,
I'm sure they 
won't fire me. 
You will go back to school, 
won't you? 
Well, if we was 
to go back to school, 
Could we get as smart 
as Tia and Tony? 
Maybe even smarter. 
Yeah, sure. 
Let's give it a shot. 
Great. 
I hope the school can take it. 
Goodbye, yoyo. 
Goodbye. 
see you later, yoyo. 
You promised. 
Tia, open the gate. 
No, everybody join hands. 
Whoa. 
Wow. 
cool! 
all right! 
Wow! Flying saucer! 
Will we ever 
see you again? 
Well, it's... 
It's kind of
hard to say.
Thanks for everything. 
And especially for 
letting me be in your gang.
Take care of Alfred 
for me, ok? 

There you are. 
Where's your luggage? 
Uh, we lost it. 
There were 
a few problems.
But you did have fun? 
Oh, terrible. 
I just knew we 
should have gone surfing. 

wow. 
Hey. Let's do it the way 
Tia and Tony taught us. 
yeah. 
Ready? 
one, two, three! 

Hey, yoyo! 
Yoyo! 
guess what! 
Tia and Tony just drove off
in a flying saucer. 
Flying saucer? 
Whoosh! 
Whoosh? 
How about whooshing 
yourself into the bus? 
But, it's true.
Lookit, I saw those two kids
do miraculous things. 
I believe anything and 
everything, except that. Get in.
I hope this school teaches 
about flying saucers. 
Yeah. 
Flying saucers.
