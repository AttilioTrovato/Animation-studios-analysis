{3918}{3986}Now, boy,|I've told you time and again.
{3988}{4064}Now, listen to me. There's no horsing|around when the train's coming.
{4066}{4124}Do you hear me?|Now, go on, get away.
{4224}{4277} Looks like she's on time.| Yes, she is.
{5051}{5102}Harrington!
{5276}{5352}Let me help you with that, little girl.|Thank you.|Watch your step.
{5354}{5429}Watch your step.|There you are, little girl.
{5626}{5706}So I have to go to the store.|You go get the luggage.|Be careful of the fresh eggs.
{5708}{5776} They're wrapped in paper.| Yes, dear.| Ben?
{5778}{5854} Yes, dear?| I want you to write a letter|to the president of this railroad.
{5856}{5925}There were men smoking|in the parlour car. Disgraceful!
{5927}{5995} I've taken his number.| Yes, dear.
{6069}{6137} Miss Pollyanna?| Yes? Aunt Polly?
{6139}{6208}No, I'm Nancy. I work for your aunt|and I came here to fetch you.
{6210}{6269}Oh. How do you do?
{6271}{6342} This is Mr Thomas, the gardener.| How do you do?
{6344}{6392}Hello, young lady.
{6394}{6456}Oh, no, no, no.|Thomas will take that for you.
{6458}{6524}Oh. Put it in the back seat.|Oh, good afternoon, Mrs Tarbell.
{6583}{6672} Is that Jenny Harrington's child?| Yes, it is.
{6674}{6758}Doesn't look a thing like any of the|Harringtons. What's your name, girl?
{6760}{6815} Speak up.| Pollyanna Whittier, ma'am.
{6817}{6873}Well, you're a very fortunate|little girl.
{6875}{6946}Most children who have lost their|parents would end up in an orphanage.
{6993}{7052} You know that, don't you?| Yes, ma'am.
{7054}{7191}Well, thank your lucky stars for such|a good woman as your aunt taking you in.
{7193}{7242} Yes, ma'am.| Yes.
{7244}{7319}Well, see that|you're properly appreciative|and don't cause any trouble.
{7321}{7370} Children really never realize__| Ed?
{7372}{7417} Uncle Karl!| Much too long.
{7419}{7485} It's good to see you.| Oh, same here.|How's everything at the house?
{7562}{7627}Wait till Polly Harrington|hears about this!
{7891}{7975}Right up here in the back seat, honey.|There you are.
{8111}{8190}Nancy, what are you staring at?
{8192}{8265}Oh, nothing!|Nothing at all, sir.
{8895}{8952} Think she'll want the car?| I don't know if|she wants the car or not.
{8954}{9009}You'll have to ask her yourself.
{9342}{9393}Your aunt's waiting for you, miss.
{9518}{9580}Hurry up.|I haven't got all day!
{10071}{10122}Oh, Mr Thomas.|Please put that here.
{10124}{10198}All right, Nancy.|All right.
{10200}{10271}You wait here, miss,|and don't touch anything.
{10273}{10332} Do you understand?| Yes, ma'am.
{11361}{11430}Well, we had, uh, Matthew.
{11432}{11515} Mark last week.| Isaiah has some very good passages.
{11517}{11581} Isaiah?| Yes, that's more what I had in mind.
{11583}{11650} Yes, Isaiah has some|very good passages.| What is it, Nancy?
{11652}{11714}Oh, excuse me, ma'am.|The little girl is here.
{11716}{11796}All right, show her in.
{11798}{11862}What you've been waiting for.
{11864}{11925}About the sermon, Reverend.
{11927}{11975}Yes.
{12030}{12127}Now, the transiency of life...
{12129}{12204}thatthat fleeting,|ephemeral vapour...
{12206}{12278}it appeareth and it vanisheth__|James, the New Testament.
{12280}{12350}The perishability of our mortal bodies.
{12352}{12409}You want me to__ to weave a theme|of this into my sermon?
{12411}{12486} Well, let me tell you what|my father said to Reverend Moffet.| Yes. What did he say?
{12488}{12578}He said that you only have the|congregation for one short hour a week.
{12580}{12657}And there are six long days of mischief|for them before you get them again.
{12659}{12735}Aha! I see your point.
{12737}{12841}Strike hard on Sunday the excessiveness|of God's wrath and hope they carry it|with them a few days into the week.
{12843}{12904} Exactly what I mean.| Oh, yes, yes.
{13029}{13095}Well, come in, young lady.
{13097}{13145}Let's meet each other properly.
{13301}{13387} I'm your Aunt Polly.| How do you do?
{13389}{13463}This is the pastor of our church,|Reverend Ford.
{13465}{13557}How do you do?|Well, there's a family resemblance.
{13559}{13618}She looks very much like her mother.
{13620}{13673}Mother always used to say|I look like you!
{13726}{13832}Would you be good enough to stand|erect and in a proper manner, please?
{13869}{13928}And where in the world|did you get that dress?
{13990}{14068}It came in the missionary barrels.
{14070}{14158} Missionary barrels?| Yes. Her father was a minister.
{14160}{14257}As a matter of fact, he was|a missionary in the British West Indies.
{14316}{14407}Pollyanna, this is going|to be your new home...
{14409}{14472}and I hope you'll be|very happy with me.
{14576}{14646}I'm very sorry|about the dress, Aunt Polly.
{14648}{14704}My father said|it was a size too big...
{14706}{14804}but that I should be glad it wasn't|a pair of boys' trousers.
{14806}{14864}Well, that's hardly anything|to be glad about.
{14866}{14927}Well, my father always used to say|that people__
{14929}{15019}Yes, well, never mind|what your father used to say.
{15021}{15114}Supper is at 6:00 sharp, and no one|is ever late for meals at this house.
{15116}{15191} Yes, ma'am.| Nancy will show you your room.
{15342}{15390}I'm very glad you sent for me,|Aunt Polly.
{15511}{15589}Your home is very lovely.
{15591}{15639}Well, thank you.
{15727}{15784}It must make you awfully glad.
{15786}{15848} Glad?| That you're so very rich!
{16049}{16119}Honestly!
{16121}{16179} Did I say something wrong?| Well, let's just say...
{16181}{16277}there are about sixtyeleven things|you could have said besides that.
{16279}{16352}I run a clean kitchen.|No shenanigans in here.
{16354}{16410}And you clean up after yourself,|you hear me?
{16412}{16463}Yes, ma'am.
{16465}{16543} You sure it was Doc Chilton?| Mrs Tarbell saw him first!
{16545}{16643}Coming back after all these years!|DDoes she know yet?
{16645}{16708} Old blabbermouth Tarbell|will see to that.| Yeah.
{16710}{16799}Now, mind what you're doing and don't|spill your milk. Now, come along.
{16801}{16868} You hurry up and change your clothes|and get back here. I need your help.| All right, all right.
{16870}{16932} And if you see Angelica,|tell her to come down here too.| Okay.
{16934}{17033} Leaving me all alone here.| I'm very pleased to have met you,|Mrs Lagerlof.
{17035}{17083} Mmm.| Now come along.
{17352}{17412}Hello.
{17473}{17575} What's his name, please?| His name happens to be Elizabeth.
{17577}{17665}Oh! You're a girl!
{17667}{17761} You're lovely.| Now, leave her alone and come along.
{17812}{17861}How__ How do I address you, please?
{17863}{17927}Well, just call me Nancy,|same as everybody else.
{17929}{18000}Oh. And this is Angelica.|She's the upstairs maid.
{18002}{18054} How do you do?| Psst! Psst!
{18056}{18121}At the back porch.|You know who.
{18123}{18199}Now?|Oh, for heaven's sake.
{18201}{18251}Oh, Angie, would you show her|to her room, please?
{18253}{18332} Well, I still have|two rooms left to do.| I'll help you with|the bedrooms in the morning.
{18334}{18383} All right, just this once.| Come on. Come on.
{18498}{18587}Will you get out of here? Come on.|Hurry up. I've got work to do.|Now, come on and get up here.
{18612}{18682}I turn my back for one moment,|and what do you do? You disappear.
{18684}{18725} And don't spill that milk.| Yes, ma'am.
{18727}{18789} I just got through|cleaning up this hall.| Yes, ma'am.
{19132}{19223} What are you doing now?| Who lives in all these?
{19225}{19284}There's no one lives in them.|They're just there.
{19286}{19373} What for?| That's what being wealthy is.
{19375}{19426}You sure are a questionasker,|aren't you?
{19428}{19476}Now, hurry up.
{19840}{19888}Come on, come on.|Don't dawdle.
{20150}{20213} Well, what's the matter?| Nothing.
{20263}{20342}Oh! Stuffy!
{20344}{20390}Not much of a room, is it?
{20392}{20482}But it's my own anyway.|I'm glad of that.
{20602}{20676}Ooh, and the bed's soft.
{20678}{20739}And it's got a lovely window.
{21149}{21210}Who's that man down there with Nancy?
{21266}{21341}None of your business.
{21343}{21399}Just make sure|you're dressed in time for dinner.
{21472}{21527}You'd think she'd do better|than this for her own niece.
{21888}{21949}Almighty God,|we thank thee for thy bounty.
{21951}{22023}Grant unto us the grace|ever to live in dread of thee.
{22025}{22098}And bless this food unto our nourishment|that it may strengthen us...
{22100}{22151}to do thy will in all things.
{22153}{22210}Amen.
{22620}{22696}Oh, I'm sorry.
{22698}{22762}Nancy, would you bring|another glass of milk, please?
{22764}{22812}Yes, ma'am.
{22957}{23005}MyMy clumsy old hand.
{23007}{23055}Well, now, there's no harm done.
{23121}{23220} Did you find your room satisfactory?| Oh, yes. It's very nice. Thank you.
{23222}{23317}You hadn't mentioned it,|so I just wondered.
{23319}{23421}I've never had a whole room|to myself before.
{23423}{23496}I must be higher up in the house|than anyone, aren't I?
{23540}{23598}Well, I'm not used to|children's noises around the house...
{23600}{23686}and that's the reason|I chose that one.
{23688}{23771}Oh, I'm__|I love it. I really do.
{23773}{23821}Really!
{24095}{24161}Aunt Polly?
{24163}{24214}Do you ever have steak and ice cream?
{24275}{24328}Are you complaining about the food?
{24330}{24389}Oh, no!|It's delicious!
{24391}{24449}I just wondered.
{24497}{24554}I love steak.
{24556}{24657}Father always used to say that if|we ever had the money you have...
{24659}{24779}we'd have steak and ice cream|three times every day!
{24781}{24881}Pollyanna, I think we ought to get|one thing straight right now.
{24883}{24987}I don't want you constantly quoting|what your father used to say.
{24989}{25037}Do you understand?
{25214}{25324}Nancy, I thought I made myself clear|about gentlemen callers.
{25326}{25393} Ma'am?| Now, don't pretend|you don't understand me.
{25395}{25445}I saw you and George Dodds|out in the summer house.
{25447}{25551} George has been every inch|a gentleman with me, and it's not__| We won't discuss it.
{25553}{25641}If you want to remain on my staff,|I don't want you to see him any more.
{25643}{25735} Do you understand?| Yes, ma'am.
{25854}{25929}This is no concern of yours.
{25931}{25985}You can finish your supper, Pollyanna.
{26120}{26181}In the fall, I'll introduce you|to Mr Bainbridge.
{26183}{26307}He's the principal of our school, and|he'll decide what grade you're to be in.
{26309}{26420}Pollyanna, I think we should talk about|you and your position in this community.
{26422}{26485}Do you know why|it's called Harrington Town?
{26487}{26552}My mother said it was named|after my grandfather.
{26554}{26603}That's right.
{26605}{26669}And everyone in this town looks to us|to set a good example...
{26671}{26782}in the way we conduct ourselves,|in our duties and manners...
{26784}{26837}in what we think|and even what we say.
{26839}{26918}So we must be good examples|for everyone in everything we do.
{26920}{26974} Is that clear?| Yes, Aunt Polly.
{26976}{27084}Just remember our family position and|conduct yourself properly and modestly.
{27086}{27174}Oh. You mean what I said before?
{27176}{27272}I understand that now.|I'll never say that again.
{27274}{27364} You understand what?| About the money.
{27366}{27471}I'm not supposed to be glad|we're so very rich, huh?
{27536}{27631}Well, uh, I think it's time for you|to get ready for bed, young lady.
{27795}{27869} May I kiss you good night? Please?| What?
{27907}{27968}Kiss you?
{28131}{28188}I love you, Aunt Polly.
{28269}{28322}Uh, just a moment, please.|Come back here.
{28435}{28483}Turn around once.
{28540}{28613}That dress is disgraceful.
{28615}{28727}Tomorrow we'll go into town|and get you some decent clothes.
{28729}{28788} Storebought?| But of course.
{28790}{28836}Where else would we get them?
{28838}{28937}Out of an actual store?|New clothes?
{28939}{29015}Well, you're a Harrington now,|and I want you to look like one.
{29017}{29088}Yoohoo!
{29090}{29144}Pollyanna?
{29146}{29205}Walk up the stairs|like a lady, please.
{29597}{29664}Storebought clothes!
{29666}{29719}What do you think of that, Elizabeth?
{29765}{29844}I wonder if she meant|new petticoats too.
{29846}{29915}And new garters|and stockings and underpants.
{30016}{30096}Don't tell anyone...
{30098}{30166}but it's wonderful|to be so rich, isn't it?
{33099}{33161}Nancy, something's come up.|I'm going with Mrs Tarbell.
{33163}{33259} Would you please take Pollyanna home?| Yes, madame.
{33261}{33330}Oh, I'll take that box, Pollyanna.
{33332}{33395}Now, get into the car, miss.
{33470}{33565}Oh, Pollyanna. Will you please get into|the car? We've simply got to get home!
{33567}{33613}Oh!
{33694}{33751}George, stop it!
{33831}{33943}Oh, Pollyanna, you don't know|my cousin Fred, do you?
{33993}{34069} Your cousin Fred?| This is Pollyanna Whittier.
{34071}{34167}Miss Harrington's niece.|The one who's come to live with her.
{34169}{34223}Oh. Oh, that one.
{34225}{34280}Hello, Pollyanna.|How are you, honey?
{34282}{34370} Fine, thank you.| Good.
{34372}{34461}Well, uh, how about this?|Running into you after all these__
{34463}{34560} What's it been, six years?|Say, how's your ma and pa?| Well, they're just fine.
{34562}{34632}You know, Pollyanna,|I don't take too much to relatives.
{34634}{34732}But this girl here, she was|always just like a sister to me.
{34734}{34869} I tell ya, I love this cousin.| Will you cut it out?
{34952}{35051}Uhhuh. Well, look, uh,|what are you girls doin'?
{35053}{35111}How'd you like to go down the street|and get a great big dish of ice cream?
{35113}{35159} Huh?| Oh!
{35161}{35225}Oh, no, that's a rotten idea. She|probably hates ice cream, doesn't she?
{35227}{35288} Oh, probably.| Who, me?
{35290}{35338} Oh, no. I love it!| Really?
{35340}{35389}You do?|Well, now, isn't that astounding?
{35391}{35447}How'd you ever develop|a taste for that awful stuff?
{35449}{35514}Oh, no, really!|I really do love it. I__
{35516}{35611}Well, I know a wonderful place.|Come on, girls.
{35613}{35688}Follow old cousin Fred|to the land of strawberry frappe.
{35690}{35750}Unless you'd rather go down|the street and have a beer.
{35752}{35819}You're funny.
{36135}{36205}Hey, you two,|get down off that truck right now.
{36207}{36297}How many times did I tell you|to keep away from the fire engine?
{36382}{36462}Hey, get on, there! Go on!|I'm not gonna tell you again.|Now, get off that ladder.
{36464}{36523}YouYou see?|Right up there under the eaves?
{36525}{36588}Just beyond the window is where__| How'd it happen?
{36590}{36677}Oh, the pipes busted, Mayor. Both them|boilers went up at the same time.
{36679}{36754} And before we knew it,|we was up to our necks in water.| Mr Geary!
{36756}{36854} Uh, comin'. Excuse me.| Well, the children are safe,|thank goodness.
{36856}{36914}I warned you about this|and told you we should do something.
{36916}{36971} Now, perhaps, you'll listen.| I've asked everyone...
{36973}{37028}to meet at my house,|and we'll discuss this calmly.
{37030}{37118}A fine orphanage this is!|Water pipes busting all over the place.
{37296}{37370}Oh, Dr Chilton? Doctor, could you|have a look at Mr Geary's arm?
{37372}{37420} Oh, just scalded it a bit.| Of course.
{37422}{37489} Is there a dispensary here?| Yes, Doctor. This way.
{37840}{37896}I wonder what's going on.
{37898}{37956}Listen, miss, before we go in...
{37958}{38007}it might be just as well|not to mention...
{38009}{38091}about the ice cream to your aunt.
{38093}{38193}My father told me|never to tell a lie.
{38195}{38243}Pollyanna...
{38275}{38335}I didn't mean to tell a lie.
{38337}{38405}But there's no reason to bring up|the subject if it isn't mentioned.
{38407}{38512} I mean, about cousin Fred and all.| I like your cousin Fred very much.
{38514}{38579}Oh, he's all right, I guess.
{38581}{38688}He's very handsome,|and he has a nice smile.
{38690}{38747}But there's something sort of...
{38749}{38827}I don't know, funny about him.
{38829}{38921}What do you mean, funny?
{38923}{38988}I know what it is.|It's his name.
{38990}{39064} He doesn't look at all like a Fred.| What?
{39066}{39132}He looks more like a George to me.
{39134}{39202}Pollyanna! Wait a minute.
{39424}{39494} Pollyanna, I told you|to come directly home.| Yes, I know, but__
{39496}{39554}And know that when I tell you|to do something, you must do it.
{39556}{39642}There are rules__ Nancy, where have|you two been? It's almost 1 :00.
{39644}{39695}Well, uh, you see, ma'am__
{39697}{39789}Have you been carrying on|with George Dodds again?
{39791}{39883} Oh, it was my fault, Aunt Polly.| What do you mean, your fault?
{39946}{40042}Well, II just dawdled so.
{40044}{40116}It was the excitement|of the new dress, I suppose.
{40118}{40200}Polly, before Karl Warren|get's here, we must talk.
{40202}{40261}Oh, I suppose you're right.|Nancy?
{40332}{40386}Nancy, get into your uniform|and help with the luncheon.
{40388}{40479} Yes, ma'am.| And this is no place|for you, young lady.
{40481}{40544} We have lots to do, so run along.| Yes, Aunt Polly.
{40548}{40627}I'm sorry to start your vacation off|like this, Ed, but this won't take long.
{40629}{40681}Don't worry about me, Uncle Karl.|I'll just wait out here.
{40683}{40778}Fine. Fine.
{40780}{40847}Oh, Frieda, Bessie, they're waiting|for you in the conservatory.
{40849}{40897}Right in there, ladies.
{40934}{41028}Why, Edmond.|This is a surprise.
{41030}{41123} Well, if it isn't young Dr Chilton.| Mrs Tarbell.
{41196}{41303} I'll see if everyone's|ready for you, Polly.| Thank you.
{41305}{41397}It's nice to see you again.|Are you just visiting?
{41399}{41484}Well, I thought it was time for|vacation, the first one in five years.
{41486}{41578}I'm just waiting here for Karl.|I won't be in the way here, I hope.
{41580}{41628}No, no, of course not.
{41677}{41804}Seems strange,|being back here again like this.
{41830}{41904}Polly, they're all ready for you.
{41906}{41962}I'll be right there.
{42013}{42081} Why don't you come in and join us?| No, I'd rather not butt in.
{42083}{42167}I'll wait here.
{42169}{42219} Well, they're waiting for me.| Go ahead.
{42221}{42269}I'll be fine here.
{42559}{42629} Hi, Nancy!| Hi. You better get out of here.
{42631}{42685}Oh, I'm all right.
{42898}{42948}It should be parliamentary procedure,|same as it's always been.
{42950}{43023} Well, for once, let's have facts.| We always observe regular procedure.
{43025}{43073}Oh, bunkum!|We're here because of an emergency.
{43075}{43151} Everybody will be talking|at the same time.| Exactly!
{43247}{43309} Hello.| Hello.
{43311}{43400} Is this the town meeting?| Oh, no. It's in there.
{43402}{43490}In the conservatory, for heaven's sake.|Oh.
{43492}{43544}Are you a member|of the ladies aid group?
{43546}{43603}Oh, no. I'm just a child.
{43605}{43680}I'm not even supposed to be here.
{43682}{43753} What's your name?| Pollyanna Whittier.
{43755}{43826}That's my aunt over there,|the pretty one.
{43828}{43899}This is her house,|and I live with her.
{43979}{44061}Wait just a moment, everybody.|We'll compromise.
{44063}{44142} We'll go to|the immediate problems first.| Good.
{44144}{44257}Amelia, wouldn't you like to hear|what Karl has to say?
{44259}{44350}All I'm saying is that it's time|we took some pride in that orphanage...
{44352}{44438}and put up a decent, presentable|building that we could all be proud of.
{44440}{44509}That's all I'm saying,|and I've been saying it...
{44511}{44576}for three and a half long years!
{44845}{44949}Polly, he is completely|out of line on the whole thing.
{44951}{45049}If we'd all be a little more quiet,|cooperative, orderly.
{45051}{45099}If we'd all stop shouting|and cooperate__
{45101}{45193}There is nothing wrong with that|building! All it needs is new plumbing.
{45195}{45282}Today the plumbing, tomorrow|the roof and the Lord knows what__
{45284}{45366}Excuse me, Reverend.|Who knows what's gonna happen next?
{45368}{45437}You were very happy when my father|donated the building for the town.
{45439}{45515}Oh, for Pete's sake,|Polly Harrington, listen to reason.
{45517}{45581}It's a dilapidated old relic!
{45583}{45639}The dining hall, the dispensary.
{45641}{45719}Even my nephew, Dr Chilton there,|he noticed that.
{45721}{45811}Ed, tell them what you said.
{45813}{45869}Well, I don't think|I should say anything.
{45871}{45950}No, no. Now, come on. Tell them|what you said. I want them to hear it.
{45952}{46066}Well, I got a look at the dispensary|when I fixed Mr Geary's arm.
{46068}{46146}And I mentioned it seemed a little|inadequate for 32 children there.
{46148}{46237}There you are.|Now you've heard it.
{46239}{46354}We all thank you for your interest,|Edmond, but it's an equipment problem.
{46356}{46431}We're talking about Harrington House,|which is a landmark in this town...
{46433}{46492}and I intend to see that|it stays that way.
{46494}{46548}We'll spend more trying|to repair that old building...
{46550}{46622}than it would cost to put up a new one.|It won't cost this town one cent!
{46624}{46691}My father donated|the building to the town...
{46693}{46751}and I will stand the cost of the pipes|or the plumbing...
{46753}{46836}or whatever it is that's necessary.
{46838}{46900}It's my duty,|and I will not shirk it.
{46961}{47027}And I suppose there's not one of you|out there that has the gumption...
{47029}{47123}to stand up and say what you think,|is there?
{47125}{47196}What about you, Reverend? You're a man|of influence in this community.
{47198}{47284} What do you think?| No! No, no, II, uh__
{47286}{47343}II never take sides|in these matters.
{47345}{47411}That's comfortable. Ben?
{47413}{47491}Speak up. Come on.
{47493}{47547}Oh, Karl!
{47549}{47620}Charlie, what do you say?
{47622}{47719}Well, say something!|Anybody!
{47721}{47769}We do have other business to discuss.
{47771}{47841} That is, if you've finished, Karl.| Oh, yes, I've finished!
{47944}{48021}There's your whole town council|and your whole civic conscience!
{48023}{48072}And you certainly don't need me|as mayor around here as long as...
{48074}{48132}you've got Polly Harrington|running everything.
{48205}{48267}Karl never changes, does he?
{48269}{48339}Uh, ladies and gentlemen,|we're having a little light lunch.
{48341}{48390}Suppose we stop for a while|and have a bite.
{48481}{48575}If you ask me, Reverend Ford should|have taken sides with Mayor Warren.
{48577}{48655}He had the chance, and what'd he do?|He says he never|takes sides in these matters.
{48657}{48738}Oh, stop stickin' your nose|into their business and|get these sherbet glasses out there.
{48740}{48828} We're out of spoons.| Well, wash some up. Don't stand there|bellyaching to me about it.
{48830}{48883}You're in a fine mood,|aren't you?
{48918}{49011}Pollyanna, I thought you|could use this for your room.
{49013}{49114}Oh, thank you, Nancy!|Oh, it's gorgeous!
{49116}{49195}Oh, well, thanks for not spilling|the beans about youknowwho.
{49197}{49252} About cousin Fred, you mean?| Mmhmm. Isn't he handsome?
{49254}{49313} I knew it all the time!| You did? How did you know?
{49315}{49379}Well, sure, it was easy! I saw you|holding hands under the table.
{49381}{49432}If you ladies got|nothing better to do...
{49434}{49482}than sit there|gossipin' and snickerin'__
{49484}{49555} Well, we're just talking, Tilly.| Well, talk on your own time.
{49557}{49646} This sherbet's turning to mush.| All right, all right.
{49712}{49788} Nancy?| Hmm?| You know that man?
{49790}{49871} What man?| The one at the train station.
{49873}{49926}The one that was just here.
{49928}{49987}Well, what was he to Aunt Polly?
{49989}{50091}Well, you might say|they used to be friends sort of.
{50093}{50173} You think he's gonna marry Aunt Polly?| Who's gonna marry her?
{50175}{50241} She means Dr Chilton.| Huh!
{50243}{50333}Fat chance! Who'd want to marry|old picklefaced Harrington?
{50335}{50414}Nancy, are you and George|gonna get married?
{50416}{50490} Oh, we hope to someday.| Oh, I am glad.
{50492}{50546}I think everyone should be married.
{50548}{50647}And maybe when|you do marry George...
{50649}{50768}Aunt Polly will see how happy you are|and she'll be very glad|to get married herself then.
{50770}{50829}Glad this, glad that!|Do you have to be glad about everything?
{50831}{50893} What's the matter with you anyway?| Oh, lay off her, Angie.
{50895}{50966} She's not hurting you.| Oh, the way she goes on.
{50968}{51032}Now, that's enough!|You heard what she said.
{51034}{51120}Stop pickin' on the girl.|Now, take that sherbet out|and serve it the way you should.
{51122}{51170}Go on!
{51239}{51313}Well, let's see what your aunt|has on the menu for tomorrow.
{51420}{51493}Roast chicken.|Chicken every Sunday.
{51495}{51553}Your aunt has no imagination.
{51555}{51639}Oh, I love roast chicken!|I'm glad tomorrow's Sunday.
{51641}{51705}Yeah. Wait till tomorrow.|You won't be so glad.
{51707}{51785}Did you ever hear of sour stomach?|Well, Sundays around here...
{51787}{51888}give folks sour stomach|for the whole rest of the week.
{51890}{51957} How come?| Wait till tomorrow.
{51959}{52011}You'll find out soon enough.
}Praise him all creatures

}Amen
{53758}{53867}Death comes unexpectedly!
{53869}{53947}And the god,Jehovah,|will execute his vengeance on ye...
{53949}{54048}who despise his dying love|and trample his benefits underfoot.
{54050}{54126}The unconverted soul,|the foolish children of man...
{54128}{54205}do miserably delude themselves|in the false confidence...
{54207}{54284}of their own strength and wisdom.
{54286}{54408}They trust to nothing but a shadow.|But bear testament.
{54410}{54487}Death comes unexpectedly!
{54489}{54585}Now, you say, "Ah, no.|II had not intended it to come now.
{54587}{54660}I had laid out matters otherwise.|I thought my scheme good.
{54662}{54733}I intended to take effectual care,|but death came unexpectedly...
{54735}{54813}like a thief, outwitting me,|too quick for me.
{54815}{54896}Oh, cursed foolishness, that I had|flattered and pleased myself...
{54898}{54952}with vain dreams of repentance.
{54954}{55053}But sudden destruction|caught me up."
{55055}{55136}And now he will deal with you.
{55138}{55238}Now, the great king|of heaven and earth...
{55240}{55335}will abolish and annihilate|this pride!
{55337}{55451}Will crush the hardened wretch of|the polluted, infinite abomination...
{55453}{55500}and rain on him...
{55502}{55596}a deluge of fire and brimstone!
{55631}{55700}And where's their strength then?
{55702}{55799}Where are the great leviathans|who defy God then?
{55801}{55897}Where's their courage, thesethese__|thesethese proud spirits?
{55975}{56029}Yes...
{56031}{56134}death comes unexpectedly.
{56136}{56200}And the dread judge|has the key of hell.
{56202}{56323}He shuts, and no man opens.
{56325}{56364}In hell...
{56366}{56451}you will be reserved in chains|of darkness forever and ever.
{56453}{56551}This place of atonement,|of damned souls and misery...
{56553}{56617}with nothing to relieve you,|no comfort...
{56619}{56679}no water for your parched tongues...
{56681}{56732}no place to rest or take a breath...
{56734}{56850}but the everlasting,|infinite convulsions of misery...
{56852}{56907}forever...
{56909}{56980}and ever and ever!
{56982}{57049}Now, Isaiah has warned us...
{57051}{57160}on the day of vengeance,|the earth shall be laid to waste.
{57162}{57255}And the cormorant and the bittern|shall possess the land.
{57257}{57327}The raven and screech owl|shall dwell in it.
{57329}{57433} Don't stare at the orphans, Pollyanna.| And who is man...
{57435}{57519}to think he can withstand|God's mighty wrath?
{57596}{57697}Great mountains cannot stand|before this wrath.
{57699}{57817}Yea, he can lay the earth|to pieces in one moment...
{57819}{57926}or shatter the whole universe|with one stroke of his fiery sword.
{57928}{58003}How dreadful is the state of those|who are in daily danger...
{58005}{58055}of this great wrath...
{58057}{58129}this abyss of death and despair.
{58131}{58234}Yet, this is the dismal case...
{58236}{58341}of every soul in this congregation|who has not been born again...
{58343}{58448}however moral or strict, sober|and religious you may otherwise be.
{58450}{58516}There is no security|for the wicked...
{58518}{58619}because there are no visible signs|of death at hand!
{58621}{58672}Unconverted men...
{58674}{58750}walk over the pit of hell|on a rotten covering.
{58752}{58836}And there are innumerable places|on this covering so weak...
{58838}{58883}they will not bear their weight.
{58885}{58972}And these places cannot be seen.|The arrows of death fly...
{58974}{59042}unseen as noonday.
{59044}{59171}God has many different|unsearchable ways of taking|the wicked from this world.
{59173}{59301}Who here, in this congregation,|listening to this discourse...
{59303}{59427}will soon be visited|by this covenant of darkness?
{59429}{59532}There you are, sitting there...
{59534}{59655}calm in your knowledge of health,|secure in your wellbeing.
{59701}{59802}Yet who could suffer the agonies|of the damned of tomorrow?
{59804}{59893}Yes, even today|or maybe the next hour...
{59895}{59978}the next minute.
{59980}{60066}And if we were to know|which of you it was...
{60068}{60148}what an awful sight it would be.
{60150}{60242}A soul doomed...
{60244}{60341}to the everlasting bottomless pit|of a divine wrath!
{60343}{60389}Yes...
{60391}{60472}death comes unexpectedly!
{60539}{60593}Amen.
{61398}{61446}Exactly!
{61480}{61554}I thought the reference to Jeremiah|at the finish was very effective.
{61556}{61606} Didn't you, Mrs Ford?| Yes.
{61608}{61663}I, uh, sometimes wonder|whether it's necessary...
{61665}{61729}to talk so furiously at them though.
{61731}{61794}Dear, Isaiah,|Jeremiah and Ezekiel...
{61796}{61847}were all recorded with flaming pens|and fire.
{61849}{61907}II can't deliver the message|with syrup.
{61909}{61967}Of course not.|Your voice is God's instrument.
{61969}{62025} It should be used accordingly.| Well, we try our best.
{62027}{62097}What'd I tell ya?
{62099}{62189}He sure sermonizes something fierce,|doesn't he?
{62191}{62267}Brimstone and damnation|on top of ham and eggs!
{62269}{62351} The one day a week we have off.| I hate Sundays.
{62353}{62433} Ooh, I just hate them.| Breakfast still a hot ball|in our stomachs...
{62435}{62503}and him chewing our ears off|from that pulpit!
{62505}{62565}We're gonna have roast chicken though.|I'm glad of that.
{62567}{62660}Are you gonna start that all over again?|Glad this, glad that!
{62662}{62743}What is all this "glad" business|you talk about?
{62779}{62838}Oh, just a game I play.
{62840}{62921}What kind of a game?
{62923}{62992}A game my father taught me.
{62994}{63090} It helps sometimes.| Helps what?
{63092}{63140}When things aren't going so well.
{63142}{63216} That reverend!| Away from the peas. Go away.
{63218}{63285}Folks just hate the coming of Sunday|because of him.
{63287}{63337}Do you know why I hate Sunday?
{63339}{63397}Because it means|the starting of another week.
{63399}{63471}That's true.|That's when you can play the glad game.
{63473}{63523}Here it comes.
{63525}{63591}Miss Goody TwoShoes is gonna find|something about Sunday to be glad about!
{63593}{63657} Oh, lay off her, Angie.| Oh, stop it!
{63659}{63752}If you knew how to play the game,|then you could find something|to be glad about too.
{63754}{63813}But you don't!
{63887}{64002}All right, Miss SmartiePants,|what's so good about Sunday?
{64004}{64065} Well, there's always something.| Huh!
{64126}{64198}You could be glad because__
{64200}{64263}Well, because what?
{64440}{64537}Because it will be six whole days|before Sunday comes around again, huh?
{64626}{64674}That kid.
{66082}{66143}Hi.
{66145}{66211}Why don't you come out of|the front door like normal people?
{66213}{66319}They won't let us. I can come out|anytime I want with my tree.
{66321}{66413}You can also fall and hurt yourself|badly. You shouldn't play in trees.
{66415}{66492}That's stupid.|Don't you believe in God?
{66494}{66560}Of course I do!|But what's that got to do with it?
{66562}{66682}He grew it there, didn't he,|so I could climb out anytime I want.
{66684}{66775}You're much too young|to go around discussing things|you don't know anything about.
{66848}{66939}He did too!|Why else would it be there?
{66941}{67006}Shows you're very juvenile.
{67008}{67114}You aren't so much, you girl!
{67116}{67190}Besides, I'm somethin' you can't be.
{67192}{67244}I'm an orphan.
{67246}{67316}Go away from me, please,|little boy.
{67318}{67389}"Go away from me, please, little boy."
{67391}{67442}What is it you want?
{67444}{67515}I wanna go fishin'.|You wanna come along?
{67582}{67636}Aren't you supposed to use a hook?
{67638}{67681}I don't have a hook.
{67683}{67731}Oh.
{69389}{69437}Hello.
{69439}{69526} Well, look who's here. How are you?| Fine, thank you.
{69528}{69604} Caught anything?| Not yet.
{69905}{69962}What was it you and|my Aunt Polly fought about?
{70091}{70186}Now, where did you hear about that?
{70188}{70293}Oh, just around. But they won't|discuss it when I'm there.
{70295}{70367}Um, would you mind|telling me what it was?
{70369}{70443}Well, Pollyanna,|it's a strange thing about arguments.
{70445}{70552}At the time, they seem very important.|But now__
{70554}{70615}You know, I can't even remember|what it was about.
{70617}{70665}Huh.
{70732}{70783}Aunt Polly's very pretty.
{70832}{70909}Yes, I think she is, don't you?
{70911}{70984}Yes. I just said so.
{71085}{71176}I love her, but I don't love|the way she fixes her hair.
{71178}{71300}Years ago, she used to wear it|long and soft down to her shoulders.
{71302}{71355}It was very soft.
{71357}{71448}It must've been beautiful.
{71450}{71504}Yes, it was very beautiful.
{71667}{71724}Did you used to be in love with her?
{71781}{71865}Come on, Pollyanna.|Let's go!
{71867}{71963}Reverend Ford and his wife|are with Aunt Polly now.
{71965}{72045}But they'll__|they'll be leaving soon.
{72047}{72175}I suppose Aunt Polly will be alone|by herself most of the afternoon.
{72177}{72231}Well, II'd better be going now.
{72233}{72281}Goodbye.
{72404}{72465} You wanna know something?| What?
{72467}{72527}Trees are the best things|in the world.
{72529}{72618}You can hide up in 'em and people|don't even know where you are.
{72620}{72705} And they're walking right beneath you.| I never thought much about it.
{72707}{72773}Well, they are.|You wanna see something?
{72775}{72841} What?| Come on. I'll show ya.
{73218}{73330} It says, "Keep out."| Shh! Ya gotta keep quiet.
{73801}{73853} Ya see that place?| What about it?
{73855}{73908}That's Old Man Pendergast's place.
{73910}{73984}He's the meanest man in town!
{73986}{74071} Well, what are we doing here?| Shh! Keep quiet.
{74279}{74330}Come on, Pollyanna.
{74491}{74564}This is his old, wet basement|with rats in it.
{74566}{74640}He hates kids.|If he catches ya...
{74642}{74752}he throws ya down in his basement|and keeps ya for his slave.
{74754}{74867} Then what are we doing here?| Because I wanna show ya something.
{75275}{75332}There it is.
{75334}{75383}Up there.
{75407}{75471}The best climbing tree in town!
{75533}{75582}Isn't it a beauty?
{75584}{75685}Why, of all the stupid little|juvenile tricks!

{77014}{77061} Lemme go.| Come on! Get up there!
{77063}{77117}Lemme go!
{77305}{77375}I want you children to understand|that I do not want you on my property.
{77377}{77460} Keep away from me. Lemme go.| Hey! Listen to me!| You big bully, lemme go!
{77462}{77524} I've told you 50 times|to keep out of that tree!| Lemme go!
{77526}{77577}And I don't want you in the tree.|You hear me?
{77579}{77638}You keep away from me.|I wasn't hurtin' anything.
{77640}{77709}It doesn't make any difference what|you were doing. I'm gonna call|the constable this time...
{77711}{77789} and see that you keep off my property.| Lemme go!| That's all there is to it, you hear me?
{77791}{77852}Stop it!|Stop it, you mean old man.
{77854}{77920} You let him go immediately!| Oh!
{77922}{77982}You came back, did you?|Who are you?
{77984}{78037}My Aunt Polly will send|for the police.
{78039}{78130}And they'll find us|in your old ratfilled basement|and you'll go to jail.
{78132}{78189}Oh. Oh, they know about me, do they?
{78191}{78303}Everything!|All about the children you've kidnapped|and turned into your slaves.
{78305}{78401} Serves 'em right for|trespassing on my property.| We weren't hurting anything.
{78403}{78491}We just wanna climb your old tree.
{78493}{78557}You fall out of that tree and get hurt|and I get sued by your parents.
{78559}{78673}I don't got any parents.|I'm an orphan.
{78675}{78760}Well, before I pitch you|into the basement with the others...
{78762}{78832} what name do you go by, boy?|Jimmy Bean.
{78834}{78923}Jimmy Bean. I like to keep a record|of your names, you see,Jimmy...
{78925}{78986}so that I can tell you from|the rats down there in the basement.
{78988}{79032} You lemme go!| Hey! Come back here, doggone you!
{79034}{79101}Oh, no you don't. No, you don't.|You come back here.
{79132}{79215}What am I going|to do with you, huh?
{79217}{79317}I don't know, sir.
{79319}{79405}Well, it was getting too crowded|with kids in that basement anyway.
{79407}{79470}All right.|I'll let you go this time...
{79472}{79539}but you've got to promise|never to come bothering me here again.
{79541}{79583} You promise?| Yes, sir.
{79585}{79652}Cross your heart and hope to die?
{79654}{79724}All right. Get out.|Get out!
{79775}{79838}Go on. What are you waiting for?
{79906}{79965} You know what I think?| No.
{79967}{80032}What do you think?
{80034}{80129}I don't think there's any|kids in your old basement.
{80131}{80213} I think you're just a big bluff!| Oh, you do, do you?
{80215}{80274}Well, put that down!|What are you doing touching things?
{80276}{80363}Don't touch anything. These are|my things and I don't want them touched.
{80365}{80470}It just looks like a lotta|old dusty junk to me.
{80472}{80541}Well, you wouldn't know anything|about that anyway.
{80543}{80593}You're nothing but a child.
{80595}{80664}Imagine criticizing|a beautiful antique of this kind.
{80797}{80904} Never heard of such a thing.| How'd you do that?| What? What?|What are you talking about?
{80906}{80997}That.|How do you make it?
{81047}{81117}Don't you know anything?|I didn't make it. The sun made it.
{81119}{81213} That's prismatic reflected light.| Where from?
{81215}{81291}Where from? Well, uh__
{81310}{81358}Oh, from here.
{81433}{81498} You see these hanging crystals?| Mmhmm.
{81500}{81587}The sun's rays hit it, and it acts|like a prism. You understand?
{81589}{81658} Sure I understand.| You do not.
{81660}{81731}You don't know what|a prism is. Now, admit it.
{81733}{81834}It makes a rainbow right on your wall.|Isn't it beautiful?
{81836}{81938}Yes, but when the sun sets,|it'll be gone. So stop carrying on so.
{81940}{82052}Sure, but it'll be back again|tomorrow when the sun comes again.
{82054}{82149} You have to admit that.| I don't have to admit anything!
{82201}{82280}Well, I better be|going back home now.
{82361}{82428}Well, goodbye, Mr Pendergast.|It was very nice meeting you.
{82430}{82475}And thank you|for showing me your house.
{82477}{82570}But I didn't show you my house.|You came barging in here!
{82572}{82608}Goodbye.
{82714}{82780}Kids. Kids today.
{82931}{82999}Well, you always were|unpredictable, Edmond.
{83001}{83104} Hello, Polly.| Coming here like this|without even calling.
{83106}{83146}Uh, won't you sit down?
{83148}{83212} Could I get you some sherry?| Uh, no, thank you.
{83214}{83267}I ran into your niece|down at Wompus Creek.
{83269}{83360}We were talking about you and I thought,|why not stop by and say hello.
{83362}{83442}Why, that's very nice. I don't know why|Pollyanna would be at Wompus Creek.
{83444}{83490}Oh, she was playing.
{83492}{83546}She told me|you'd be alone today.
{83548}{83612}There were so many people|around the other day,|we hardly had a chance to talk.
{83614}{83702}Yes, well, I'm sorry that meeting|got out of hand like that.
{83704}{83790}Well, tell me, who have you seen|since you've been back?| No one.
{83792}{83859} You knew that Carleen Donnelly|got married, didn't you?| No.
{83861}{83912} You remember her brother,|Beckett Donnelly?| No.
{83914}{83984}Of course you do.|You two used to argue all the time.
{83986}{84072}Well, I'm sorry, I don't.
{84074}{84162}Well, it really|wasn't that important.
{84164}{84229}I know what I'll do.|I'll give you a welcoming home party.
{84231}{84289}It might be nice to see|some of the old faces again.
{84291}{84345}I know that Gary and Nell|would love to see you.
{84347}{84430}Do you know that Nell|has eight children?|And I think it's the fifth one__
{84432}{84482} Polly?| What?
{84546}{84641}I'm not very good at parties.|Please don't.
{84643}{84744}Well, I just thought you might like|to see some of your friends.
{84746}{84807}I came back to see you.
{84858}{84915}Well, that's very flattering.
{84917}{84976}A busy person like you|remembering me.
{84978}{85053}I came back to see if you were married|and what had happened to you.
{85094}{85159}Oh, I'm just the same.
{85161}{85257} Nothing has changed. Everything is__| We made a mistake.
{85259}{85358}I came back to see|if you felt the same as I do.
{85360}{85425}Oh, but it's been five years.
{85427}{85504} You can't just pop out__| They were wasted years.
{85581}{85638}Tell me about your work, Edmond.
{85640}{85695}We've heard that you've opened|a clinic in Baltimore...
{85697}{85761}and we're very proud of you.
{85813}{85908} What was it you mentioned|yesterday about the orphanage?| I don't remember.
{85910}{86017}Oh, yes, you do.|It was something about the dispensary.
{86019}{86089}It's inadequate for that number|of children. That's all.
{86091}{86156}Well, I want to modernize it.|Will you help us?
{86158}{86209}Just tell us what we need|and I'll buy it.
{86211}{86287}It's a civic responsibility.|Why should you buy it?
{86289}{86389} Well, it isn't as if|I couldn't afford it.| What does that have to do with it?
{86391}{86468}Well, it's because I want to.|I feel I should.
{86470}{86544}After all, there is an obligation|to having wealth.
{86546}{86665}Haven't you learned yet|that people don't like false charity?
{86667}{86754}Well, I don't want to talk|about it any more. I don't know how|we got off on this subject.
{86756}{86822}Well, it isn't the way I wanted it.
{86866}{86948} Perhaps I should come again|another time.| Yes, perhaps you should.
{86950}{87033}And maybe you should call first?
{87035}{87084}Yes, I'll do that.
{87268}{87326}Pollyanna, look at your new dress.
{87328}{87381}It's filthy! And your shoes!
{87412}{87460}Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Polly.
{87462}{87522}I was playing, and I didn't realise.
{87620}{87696}What were you|and Dr Chilton talking about?
{87720}{87789}Oh! Nothing.
{87791}{87851}We were talking about your hair.
{87853}{87920} My hair?| Yes.
{87922}{88016}He said you used to wear it very|long and soft, down to your shoulders.
{88018}{88102}He said it was beautiful!
{88104}{88193}Yes, well, uh__|Clean yourself up for supper, dear.
{88195}{88244}Yes, Aunt Polly.
{88871}{88949}Here is the last|of the calf'sfoot jelly.
{88951}{89029} Oh, but Aunt Polly, please__| There'll be no nonsense|about it, Pollyanna.
{89031}{89095}This is a duty and a job|that must be done.
{89097}{89165}Nancy will show you where|the deliveries are supposed to be made.
{89167}{89231} What kind of deliveries?| Charity baskets, child.
{89233}{89299} Oh, the suffering in this world!| Dwell on it.
{89301}{89372}Appreciate how lucky you are.
{89374}{89471}Now, these two go first, Nancy,|and handle them with care.
{89473}{89532} Where's the one for Mrs Snow?| Oh.
{89534}{89622} We took great pains to wrap that|attractively, knowing how she is.| Yes, ma'am.
{89624}{89703}And there'll be no dawdling. And keep|your clothes clean for a change.
{89705}{89774}Come on. Off with you.
{89776}{89885} Come on, honey.|We've got three more to go!| Oh, just a minute, Nancy.
{89887}{89927}What's in the durn thing?
{89929}{90022}Um, I think that one's|calfs'foot jelly.
{90024}{90087}Oh, you don't have to look at it|as though it was charity...
{90089}{90160}just a gift from|one friend to another.
{90162}{90240} Friend?| Yes. I'm your friend.
{90242}{90308}Well, uh, I better be going now.|Goodbye.
{90418}{90489} People sure hate to get charity.| Isn't it the truth?
{90491}{90576} And I don't blame them.| Dogooders! Ha!
{90624}{90704} Goodbye, Miss Ferd.| Goodbye.
{90706}{90775} Now, how does that go again?| Uh__
}Early one morning|just as the sun was rising
}Early one morning|just as the sun was rising
}I heard a maiden singing|in the valley below
{91081}{91117}One up.
} Early one morning|Just as the sun was rising
}I heard a maiden singing
{91352}{91441}That takes care of|Mrs Gaupherson, Miss Neely...
{91443}{91501}Doppsils and the Ferds.
{91503}{91565} Who's left?|Just this one, Mrs Snow.
{91567}{91660} And I wish this one were over with.| What's wrong with her?
{91662}{91729}She's just plain crabby,|that's what's wrong with her.
{91731}{91787}You never met anyone|so cantankerous.
{91789}{91855}If it was Friday,|she'd wish it was Tuesday.
{91989}{92088} What'd we bring her today?| Uh, calfs'foot jelly.
{92090}{92168}You wait and see.|She's bound to wish she had chicken.
{92170}{92227}And if we brought her chicken,|she'd want lamb broth.
{92229}{92287}She's just cantankerous!
{92374}{92448}Millie?
{92450}{92500}Nancy, come on in.
{92502}{92539} How are you?| Hello, there.
{92541}{92602} Hello.| Uh, this is Pollyanna Whittier.
{92604}{92666}Oh, sure. I heard you were coming|to stay with your aunt.
{92668}{92730} And this is Mrs Snow's|daughter, Mildred.| How do you do?
{92732}{92794} How do you do?| Where were you last night?|We waited and waited.
{92796}{92872}At the hayride. I know. My mother said|I could go and at the last minute|changed her mind.
{92874}{92929} She had some kind of,|I don't know, an upset stomach.| Oh, what a shame.
{92931}{93053}Stop that noise in there! Haven't you|any respect for a dying woman?
{93055}{93192}Honestly! She was so crotchety|today. I'm just worn to a frazzle!
{93194}{93247}This morning II fixed her|a cup of coffee, as usual.
{93249}{93296}You know, I brought it in.|She didn't want coffee this morning.
{93298}{93370} This morning she wanted tea.| I don't know how you stand it.|I swear!
{93372}{93431}I don't know either.|I poured it down the sink.|I had to make her a new cup of tea.
{93433}{93492}Do you remember the day thatthatthat|I brought the currant jelly?
{93494}{93556}Yes!|I had currant jelly from here to there.
{93558}{93616}She threw it at you!
{93729}{93764}Hello.
{93766}{93804}Who are you?
{93806}{93901}And what are you doing|in my bedroom?
{93903}{93985} Uh, I am Pollyanna Whittier.| Who?
{93987}{94051} Miss Harrington's niece.| Oh!
{94053}{94130} The ladies' aid has sent me with this.| Hmm? What is it?
{94132}{94258} Calfs'foot jelly.| Calfs'foot jelly! Oh!
{94260}{94357}And I had my heart set|on lamb's broth today.
{94359}{94453} You mean chicken, don't you?| What's that?
{94455}{94565}Well, they tell me you always wanted|chicken when you were brought jelly.
{94567}{94661}You're a Miss Impertinence,|aren't ya?
{94663}{94767}Come here.|Come right over here.
{94833}{94895}You have a stubby little nose.
{94897}{94947}What do you think about that?
{94949}{95022}I know it.|I wish I were pretty like you.
{95024}{95096}Oh, don't you try to butter me up.
{95098}{95191} I'm not at all pretty.| Oh, but you are!
{95193}{95249}And you don't look sick at all.
{95251}{95343}Well, that shows you|what a stupid little girl you are.
{95345}{95414}Well, get outta my way.
{95416}{95485}Why, I'm right on death's doorstep...
{95487}{95592}just hanging on by sheer will power.
{95594}{95692}If you had to lay here day after day|and day after day, and you call|anybody, and your daughter__
{95694}{95767}Put that down, stop it.|And she wouldn't come.
{95769}{95851}She's gallivantin' somewhere. And the|doctor, all he gives you is pills.
{95853}{95926}Pills and bills.|Just pills and bills. That's all.
{95983}{96049} What are you staring at?| Your prisms.
{96051}{96130} My what?| Your prisms.
{96132}{96231} Did you know they paint|rainbows on your wall?| Oh.
{96233}{96304}See? On that wall over there.
{96546}{96595}How'd you do that?
{96597}{96694} Well,I said that I'm too old and too|smart for that old saw, Fred Pallegrew.| Well, I should say so!
{96696}{96790}You just turn that horse around|and head out from underneath|this covered bridge right now.
{96792}{96904} I'll bet that cooled his heels.| You should've seen his face.
{96906}{96954} More coffee?| Oh, please.
{97040}{97143} It's awful quiet in there.| I wonder what's going on.
{97224}{97304}Uh, more to your left.|To your left, you silly girl.
{97306}{97438}What's the matter with you? Now, there.|There. That's not bad at all.
{97440}{97524}Not bad?|It's gorgeous!
{97526}{97596} I think it was a fine idea.| Now, don't be taking credit.
{97598}{97676}I suggested stringing them up there.
{97678}{97789}Why, Mrs Snow, that's a fib.|It was my idea.
{97791}{97850}It was my idea to use the string!
{97852}{97920}You didn't know how to do it|till I suggested the string.
{97922}{98035}You're impertinent.|I don't like you at all.
{98037}{98116}I'm sorry.
{98118}{98168}When are you coming back again?
{98170}{98218}Tomorrow, I guess. I'll see you then.
{98220}{98302}Well, if I'm not in my grave.
{98304}{98393} Bye.| Bye.
{98395}{98450}All right, Nancy?
{98452}{98537} Goodbye, Millie.| Goodbye, Nancy.
{98539}{98606} Goodbye, Pollyanna!| Bye.
{98608}{98714}Don't stand there! Go on and fix|a cold pack for my headache!
{98716}{98787}Go on! Go on!
{98789}{98822}Yes, Mother.
{99250}{99296}Let's get some gumption around here.
{99298}{99368}Let's start acting|like a community.
{99405}{99469}Hey, Doc, you just sit there|chewing on that straw.
{99471}{99528}Put in your two bits' worth.|What do you think?
{99530}{99653}I came here to fish, Charlie. I don't|want to butt into your affairs here.
{99655}{99729}Ben Tarbell?|Where are you sneaking off to?
{99778}{99849}You folks are biting off|a pretty big chew with all this talk.
{99851}{99893}Come on, Ben. Get it said.
{99895}{99977}A lot of us have got vested interests|in the Harrington companies.
{99979}{100057}Our wives belong to|her ladies' aid group.
{100059}{100131}My woman would skin me alive if I was|to go opposite to Polly Harrington.
{100133}{100237}And that's the truth!|I'm sorry.
{100239}{100326}Anybody else want to quit,|do it now.
{100328}{100397}All right, then. Let's get our hands|out of our hip pockets...
{100399}{100447}and find a way to raise some money.
{100449}{100525} Are you with me?| Yeah.
}Early one morning|just as the sun was rising
}I heard a maiden singing|in the valley below
{100841}{100879}What's happening?
{100881}{100941}Now, that's the very first thing|in the morning. Charlie Gorman...
{100943}{100995}that means eight men|assigned to you for carpentry.
{100997}{101065} Dan Seymour'll supply|the onebytwelves. Right, Dan?| Right.
{101067}{101125}All right. Now, look, Mary,|you gotta get that cooking done.
{101127}{101219} Of course, you got|that other thing to run.| Yes, Karl,|I'll take care of the chicken.
{101221}{101294} Hi, Pollyanna!| Hi. I'll be back in a minute.
{101296}{101356} Hi, honey.| Hi. What's going on?
{101358}{101437}Lady, you are looking at the elected|head of the entertainment committee.
{101439}{101490}Old Uncle George!
{101492}{101546} Entertainment committee for what?| Well__
{101548}{101608}If we get the corn, you can take|that whole thing out of there.
{101610}{101697}Charlie, you can count on me|to haul in that lumber.
{101699}{101804} Don't have to use the big truck__| We're gonna have the best bazaar|you've ever seen.
{101806}{101861}We sure are!
{101863}{101931} A bazaar?| To raise money for a new orphanage.
{101933}{102000}It's the first time folks have|stood together against Polly Harrington.
{102002}{102067} Nancy, did you know|there's going to be a bazaar?| Yes!
{102069}{102130}With corn on the cob|and ice cream and everything!
{102132}{102219} Can kids come, George? Can they come?| Well, of course they__
{102221}{102353}George?|Now, where'd you get that name?|Oh, stop. She's known it all along.
{102355}{102414}And you mean|you didn't tell your aunt?
{102416}{102496} Well, what did you think|I was, a snitchbaby?| You're a good girl.
{102498}{102556} When's it gonna be?| Sunday night, a week.
{102558}{102625}Let me tell you about it.|What a night. An extravaganza.
{102627}{102687}And I'm in charge of all the acts,|all the entertainment.
{102689}{102785}Picture it, ladies.|Darkness, and out of the night...
{102787}{102893}50 bicycles appear,|moving down the square.
{102895}{102954}And hanging from their handlebars...
{102956}{103081}200__ 200 gorgeous Japanese lanterns.
{103598}{103671}Hey, Pollyanna, wait for me.
{103673}{103764} Where are you goin'?| There's a big bazaar and I'm helping.
{103766}{103831}Hey, wait a minute.
{103833}{103932} What's it for?| It's an extravaganza.
{103934}{103974}Picture it.
{103976}{104022}Darkness...
{104024}{104075}fifty bicycles...
{104077}{104198}200 gorgeous|Japanese lanterns swinging.
{104200}{104305}And I'll be on the lead bicycle,|just riding along, right out in front.
{104307}{104409} Oh, boy. Can I help?| All right. Come on.
{104411}{104482} Where you goin' now?| Mr Pendergast's.
{104484}{104573}You're going back?|You're nutty!
{105219}{105313} What are you doing back here?| Oh, just came to say hello.
{105315}{105426} Tell you something about your prisms.| Well, what about them?
{105428}{105513}Well, aren't you going to invite me in?|Invite you in?
{105515}{105580}No more privacy than a goldfish.
{105582}{105648}All right. Come in, come in.|But you can't stay long.
{105650}{105711}Can he come in too?
{105713}{105807} Can who come in?|Jimmy Bean!
{105809}{105893}Come on.|Don't be a scarebaby!
{105986}{106047}Oh, come on!
{106199}{106249}Don't touch anything.
{106251}{106352}Well, why didn't you just invite|the whole town while you were at it?
{106354}{106440}Oh, I just wanted to show Jimmy|the rainbow on your wall.
{106442}{106505}Do you mind?
{106507}{106563}All right.|Go ahead, go ahead.
{106565}{106622}Kids__|They'll drive you crazy.
{106624}{106689}One thing or another.|It's getting so a man...
{106691}{106755}can't call his home his own any more.
{106798}{106892}And where do you think it comes from?|Through this piece of glass.
{106894}{106989} Explain it to him, Mr Pendergast.| I've got work to do.
{106991}{107100} Don't you know anything about|refracted light, there, boy?| It's the sunlight coming through__
{107102}{107191}I'll do the explaining if you don't|mind, little Miss Knowitall.
{107193}{107271}Now, boy, you see here, the__
{107273}{107364} Don't they ever cut your hair|in that darn orphanage?| I like it the way it is.
{107366}{107443}Look at you. So much hair, you look|like you're wearing a coonskin cap.
{107445}{107515} Lemme go, will ya?| Anyway...
{107517}{107569}about the refracted light.
{107571}{107627}Oh yes.
{107629}{107680}Now pay attention, boy.
{107682}{107776}You see the shape of this crystal?|That is a prism.
{107778}{107850}The light is stripped by that angle.|That refracts the ray...
{107852}{107910}splits the colours,|diffuses them in an oblique angle...
{107912}{107964}and bends it out|into a dispersed colour band.
{107966}{108014}You understand?
{108074}{108115}What he means is...
{108117}{108194}the sun comes through here|and paints a rainbow.
{108196}{108284} You see?| Oh, I understand!
{108286}{108343}Can I try it once, please?
{108345}{108415}Go ahead, but don't break anything.
{108517}{108616}Do you know Mrs Snow?|Well, I've just come from her place.
{108618}{108689}And we strung a whole bunch of them|up across her window.
{108691}{108735}You should see what that does!
{108737}{108803} Let's try it.| All right.
{108805}{108874}Oh no, I've got work to do.
{108876}{108946}If we had some wire|or a piece of thread...
{108948}{109004}we could string 'em up|across the whole window.
{109006}{109067}Oh, we could, could we?|Do you kids think...
{109069}{109146}I've got nothing better to do|than to play silly games?
{109329}{109381}Well, don't stand there|looking at me like that.
{109383}{109483}There's string in that box over there.|Go and get it, go and get it.
{109485}{109514}Oh, dear, dear, dear.
{109739}{109864}Oh, my goodness! Look!
{109866}{109943} Look. See over here?| Look on the door!
{109945}{110036} It's on the door. Can't you see?| Look!
{110038}{110086}Oh, it's gorgeous!
{110088}{110191}It's the most beautiful|room in the entire world.
{110193}{110242}Not bad, is it?
{110244}{110292}It's not bad at all.
{110342}{110428}That dining room looks awfully gloomy.|Why don't we do the same thing in there?
{110430}{110486} Oh, boy! Let's go!| No.
{110488}{110542}What do you mean, "no"?|I thought you enjoyed it.
{110544}{110610}Well, it's what I came to see you|about, Mr Pendergast.
{110612}{110667}You see, they're having|a big bazaar in town...
{110669}{110744}and they're trying to raise enough money|to build a new orphanage.
{110746}{110799} I like the old one.| Be still.
{110801}{110852}Anyway, they need help.
{110854}{110990}And everyone's supposed to bring|somebody else. And I want to bring you.
{110992}{111088} What for?| They're having all kinds of stands|to sell things__
{111090}{111188}hooked rugs, quilts|and crocheted tablecloths.
{111190}{111260}And we can have a stand and sell these!
{111262}{111319}Rainbow makers!
{111321}{111378}I'll bet everyone would buy one.
{111380}{111470}I never go into town, and I don't|believe in community projects.
{111472}{111536} But they need you!| They need me?
{111676}{111787}Of course, they are sort of|attractive little things, aren't they?
{111789}{111878}I just wonder if folks|would buy a thing like this.
{111880}{111927}I wonder.
{111981}{112082}Now, I'm not trying to sell you|the brass, but it is durable.
{112084}{112152}Well, the silver's pretty, and I think|you're right about the brass.
{112154}{112216}Oh, I don't know.|I just can't make up my mind.
{112218}{112314}Of course, the effect of silver|is always in good taste.
{112316}{112401} Hi, Mrs Snow.| Well, where have you been,|you naughty girl?
{112403}{112494} Oh, I'm sorry. I've been helping|for the bazaar. Hello, Mr Murg.| How do you do?
{112496}{112608}What've you got there? Don't bring those|dirty rags in here! Get them off my bed!
{112610}{112739}Oh, they aren't dirty rags.|They're patchwork squares.|Mrs Gaupherson made them.
{112741}{112809}I thought perhaps you'd like to|stitch them together...
{112811}{112863}to make a patchwork quilt|for the bazaar.
{112865}{112950} What an impertinent child!| Listen. You just take them|right out of here!
{112952}{113034} I'm not gonna do anything of the sort!| But everyone's helping__
{113036}{113118}Mr Neely, the Julians,|and even old Mrs Thurm.
{113120}{113221}Oh. She wants me to work|in my condition.
{113223}{113290}Don't bother Mrs Snow, girl.
{113292}{113356}She's a very sick woman!
{113358}{113478}Well, I thought it might give you|something to do instead of|just lying around.
{113480}{113554}I mean, the bazaar's|for an awfully good cause.
{113556}{113645}Well, it's a waste of time.|Nobody'll come to it. You wait and see.
{113647}{113704} That's right.| Why not?
{113706}{113831}Because__ Because of your aunt,|that's why not.
{113833}{113878}Well, I don't understand.
{113880}{113949}Well, we do, don't we, Mr Murg?
{113951}{114008} Indeed we do.| Good. Well.
{114010}{114108}Now, about this white satin.|I think it's lovely.
{114110}{114188} ThisThis is my first choice.| And I think the best one.
{114190}{114265} Yeah.| It'll look lovely|against the brass handles.
{114267}{114329}Are you having a dress made?
{114386}{114463}Don't be impertinent!
{114465}{114535}I'm pickin' the lining for my coffin.
{114537}{114593}That's right.
{114595}{114670}But you're not gonna die!
{114672}{114726}Does she have to be here?
{114728}{114845}Go on into the kitchen|and talk to Mildred.
{114847}{114893}Now__
{114895}{114952}Now, this satin is lovely.
{114954}{115011}Well, it's all settled then.
{115084}{115153}Thirteen yards of the white satin...
{115155}{115216}at $ 1 .20 the yard.
{115265}{115352}And the brass coffin handles.
{115354}{115454}Well, all right, all right.|Write it up.
{115456}{115516}Stop frowning at me like that!
{115518}{115577}What's the matter with you?
{115579}{115655}Well, it's just that...
{115657}{115746}well, a person shouldn't think|about dying so much!
{115748}{115853} I don't want you to die.| Oh, bless you for that.
{115855}{115907}It seems everyone else can't wait.
{115983}{116047}I'm not supposed to talk|about my father at home...
{116049}{116097}but I guess it's all right here.
{116099}{116205}My father used to say,|a person should think about living.
{116207}{116290}Why don't you go outside and play?
{116292}{116409} Hush up.|I want to hear what she has to say.| Yes. Mrs Snow. Yes.
{116411}{116483}It just reminded me|about my father and the doll.
{116485}{116543}You see,|I always wanted a doll...
{116545}{116654}but we never had enough money|for things like that.|My father was a minister.
{116656}{116747}But surely he could afford|a little thing like a doll.
{116749}{116818}Well, he couldn't.|We had to have the money for food.
{116820}{116899} Oh, for heaven's sake!| Shh!
{116901}{116982}So anyway, my father wrote|to the missionary people...
{116984}{117076}and asked them to please send|a little secondhand doll.
{117078}{117168}Well, there was a funny mistake.|When the missionary barrels came...
{117170}{117268}instead of a doll,|they sent a pair of crutches.
{117270}{117330}Well, of course,|I was rather disappointed.
{117332}{117425} So my father made up the glad game.| The what game?
{117427}{117532}She's been pestering folks all over town|with this sunshine and happiness thing.
{117534}{117625}Hearts and flowers.|Enough to make you sick.
{117627}{117720} Hush up! I want to hear it.| Certainly.
{117772}{117826}Anyway, about the crutches...
{117828}{117887}my father said,|"Don't let's be gloomy.
{117889}{117953}Let's try to find something|to be glad about."
{117955}{118021}So we made a game of it__|the glad game!
{118023}{118105} "The glad game"!| Shh!
{118107}{118171}So anyway, we played the game...
{118173}{118265}and after a while I forgot|about the doll and being gloomy.
{118267}{118349}And you know what?|I found a reason for being glad.
{118351}{118443}Well, there's nothing happy|about a pair of crutches.
{118445}{118536}Well, we were glad|that we didn't have to use them!
{118538}{118610}Why must you bedevil|this poor dying woman...
{118612}{118663}with your childish,|silly little stories?
{118665}{118783}I just thought she could play the game!|You could be glad you don't need|this horrid old coffin!
{118785}{118910}You could help others|by making the patchwork quilt|for the orphans if you wanted.
{118912}{119001}You ought to forget about dying|and be glad you're living!
{119087}{119148}Oh, I don't care what you do.
{119252}{119340}I'm not gonna come|and see you any more.
{119367}{119462}I__ I didn't mean|to hurt her feelings.
{119513}{119606} She's serious about it, isn't she?| Oh, please, please, Mr Murg.
{119608}{119656}Leave me alone.
{119658}{119751} I'm sorry if I've__| Please.
{119753}{119821}Please leave me alone.
{121085}{121185}Ben told me yesterday they've been|organizing, about 50 of them.
{121187}{121253} And Ed Chilton's got a finger|in the pie too!| Edmond?
{121255}{121317}Gave them the idea is what he did.|And that's not all.
{121319}{121449} It couldn't have been Nancy.| I tell you, she was there.|Jesse told me.
{121451}{121546}I'd fire that girl so fast,|it would make her head swim.
{121548}{121682}And that child, your own niece,|helping them!
{121684}{121738}Pollyanna?
{121740}{121803}Just a moment.
{121805}{121883}Mrs Tarbell tells me you're involved|with that bazaar. Well, I won't have it.
{121885}{121957}But, Aunt Polly,|I'm part of the flag.
{121959}{122031}We won't discuss it. I don't want you|to see those people any more...
{122033}{122108}and that's an order!
{122110}{122159}Yes, ma'am.
{122236}{122360}The blessings you've heaped|on that child, and her working|with those people against you.
{122394}{122465}Get down my cake tins, Angie.|We're going to work.
{122467}{122560} Doin' what?| Thinks she's the queen of Sheba,|does she?
{122562}{122629}Well, she can't stop us|from helping with that bazaar!
{122631}{122704}We're gonna bake cakes,|dozens and dozens of'em!
{122706}{122788} Where are you gonna get|the ingredients?| Where do you think?
{122937}{123035} You're getting paid, aren't you?| Not to be kicked.|He kicked me in the stomach.
{123037}{123110}Now,Jimmy, you've got to stop|kicking Mr Hooper and sit still.
{123112}{123169} I don't want to get my hair cut!| Hey,Jed.
{123171}{123250}Get that hammer out back,|and we'll nail his shoes to the chair!
{123252}{123321} Hey.| Mr Pendergast.
{123323}{123381}You should be ashamed of yourself,|Ben Tarbell!
{123383}{123481}I paid for the tickets.|Will you let it go at that, Karl?|I just can't show up at your affair.
{123483}{123581} You ain't the only one, Ben.| What do you mean by that?
{123583}{123681}Well, I just came|from your newspaper office.|What's the matter with those fellows?
{123683}{123774}They said they couldn't handle|this ad for our bazaar. Will you|go over and straighten them out?
{123776}{123863}Ah, take it easy, Doc. Our space|is all sold, and I can't go around__
{123865}{123953}Tell him the truth.|Why lie to the man? You're a coward!
{123955}{124035}It isn't Baltimore up here, Doc.|This is a small town.
{124037}{124107}And you know as well as everybody else|our newspaper's owned|by the Harrington family.
{124109}{124169}Liverbellied bunch of miserable sheep!|That's what you all are.
{124171}{124245}Well, take it easy, Pendergast.|It's the way things are.
{124247}{124308}I say that you're all chickenlivered!|And I'm sick and tired of__
{124310}{124379}Just a minute!Just a minute!|The thing is this.
{124381}{124465}Most folks around here make a living|outta Polly Harrington,|some way or another.
{124467}{124555} We can't afford to antagonize her.| Can't afford to antagonize her?
{124557}{124644}Just don't be surprised if come Sunday|night nobody shows up at your bazaar.
{124646}{124749}I don't believe that.
{124751}{124854}Well, you're comin', aren't ya?|Claire? Charlie?
{124904}{124966}People are just plain scared to, Karl.
{124968}{125034}They're afraid of Polly Harrington|paying 'em back later.
{125036}{125111} She'll do it too. You know her.| Now, look.
{125113}{125161}We've all taken a cut or two|at the Harringtons...
{125163}{125246}but she wouldn't do a thing like that.
{125311}{125398} If you think I'm|intimidating a whole town__| Oh, Polly, you know what I mean.
{125400}{125472}No one will make a move|in this town without the Harrington|stamp of approval on it.
{125474}{125515}Oh!
{125578}{125670}Karl Warren sent you, didn't he? He knew|no one would cooperate without me.
{125672}{125773}Nobody sent me.|I just wanted it made clear|you don't mind if the others cooperate.
{125775}{125846}You needed my help.|Why don't you admit it?
{125848}{125916}Won't let your guard down|for a minute, will you?
{125918}{126005}Still suspicious.|Still don't trust anyone.
{126007}{126072}Nothing's changed, has it, Polly?
{126074}{126160}You're still as opinionated as ever,|if that's what you mean.
{126229}{126282}Oh, Angelica...
{126284}{126339}Dr Chilton is leaving.
{126418}{126523}Keep busy, Polly. Lots of meetings|and civic duties and obligations.
{126525}{126619}It's a poor substitute|for what's really wrong with you.
{126621}{126718}I knew I could count on you|for some lofty clinical observations.
{126720}{126804}Would you like to be paid|for your diagnosis?
{126806}{126932}This one's on the house.|There's no medical term for it.
{126934}{127040}You can give everything but love.|It's as simple as that.
{127298}{127337} Angelica?| Ma'am?
{127339}{127398}See that the flowers|in the conservatory get fresh water.
{127400}{127484} I found them dry again today.| Yes, ma'am.
{127728}{127776}Did ya hear how he told her off?
{127778}{127840}Like water off a duck's back to her.
{127842}{127908}That woman's got no feelings at all!
{128817}{128920} How'd it go, Ed?| Stubborn, muleheaded woman.Just like|her father. I should have known better.
{128922}{128979} What did she say?| A lot of foolish nonsense.
{128981}{129044}What she really wants|is for us to go begging to her...
{129046}{129138}get her sanction, permission|from the queen to gather in the streets.
{129140}{129198} Hi, Nancy.| Hi, dear.| What's the matter?
{129200}{129278} Oh, nothing.| It's a doggone shame,|after all the work folks put into it.
{129280}{129340} Is the bazaar off?| It looks that way.
{129342}{129417} Why?| You wouldn't understand.
{129419}{129468} Is it because of Aunt Polly?| Yes.
{129470}{129552}It takes a word from someone,|someone who isn't under her thumb.
{129554}{129613}Fat change you got, Ed. She's got|her finger in nearly everything__
{129615}{129671}the bank, the mills,|the paper, real estate.
{129673}{129750}Harrington Town. A fine thing,|one woman owning a town.
{129752}{129800}Well, like it or not,|that's what she does.
{129802}{129868} Nancy.| Yes?| She doesn't own the church.
{129870}{129923}That's right.
{129960}{130043}What did you say?
{130045}{130143}Um, I just said that|nobody could own a church.
{130209}{130308}Our social structure in this small town|seems to teeter on a delicate balance...
{130310}{130398}one which__ which I certainly cannot|in any way attempt to influence.
{130400}{130470}AA man of God cannot be|taking sides in these feuds.
{130472}{130520} But all we want|is a word from you, Reverend.| No.
{130522}{130599} If you'd just let the people know|tomorrow you're in favour of us.| No, no, no.
{130601}{130650}I won't use that pulpit|for public announcements.
{130652}{130759} Then you're siding with her|by not mentioning it.| I am not!
{130761}{130817}I'm staying completely out of it,|and that's all there is to it.
{130819}{130892}Reverend Ford, if you'd just|let us say that you're in favour.
{130894}{130962}There's nothing more to discuss.
{130964}{131049} This is all just impossible.| I'm afraid you're right.
{131210}{131262}Thank you, Reverend Ford.
{131454}{131511}You see, I__|Of course, you understand that__
{131513}{131640}Personally I think it's a good cause and|all that, andand I wish you luck with it.
{131642}{131748}Thanks a lot.|I guess Pollyanna was wrong.
{131750}{131834}Now, what has she got to do with this?
{131836}{131918}She said nobody|could own a church.
{132215}{132301} Hello, Mrs Ford.| Hello, dear. What are you doing here?
{132303}{132376}Aunt Polly sent me.|Uh, something for Reverend Ford.
{132378}{132459} Oh, he's just back up there.| Oh, yes, I saw him. Thank you.
{132461}{132538} It's a lovely day, isn't it?| Yes, it is.
{132691}{132787}And he sayeth unto them...
{132789}{132855}the wicked shall be punished.
{132917}{133025}The wicked shall be punished.
{133027}{133099}Their poison is like|the poison of serpents.
{133128}{133214}But they shall feel|the gall of asps within them.
{133332}{133392}How many times|have I stood on this pulpit...
{133442}{133541}and warned you,|cautioned you again and again__
{133543}{133638}A house divided against itself|cannot stand.
{133640}{133763}A kingdom divided against itself|can be brought to desolation.
{133765}{133848}If you are an enemy to one another...
{133850}{133921}then you are an enemy to God!
{133994}{134095}Am I reaching out to you?|Do you understand my words?
{134097}{134143}Well__
{134175}{134286}Week after week, I stand here|reaching out to you...
{134288}{134357}begging you to understand.
{134359}{134408}Yet, week after week...
{134410}{134477}the same wickedness persists...
{134479}{134534}the same dissension...
{134536}{134598}the same belligerence,|the same feuding...
{134600}{134666}until you are|ten thousand times...
{134668}{134743}more abominable in|the eyes of God...
{134745}{134861}than the most hateful,|venomous, violent, vicious__
{134939}{134987}You!
{135019}{135110} What are you doing here?| Oh, nothing.
{135112}{135171}Um, I mean, I was looking for you.
{135173}{135242}Uh, Aunt Polly sent you this.
{135244}{135305} Now, what is it?| Uh, I don't know.
{135339}{135413}I'm sorry I disturbed|your practise.
{135618}{135692} Would you like someone|to practise your sermon on?| No. No, thank you, child.
{135762}{135845}Uh, Mother and I used to be|an audience to my father...
{135847}{135900}when he was practising|his sermons.
{135982}{136065} HeHe was a minister too, you know.| Oh, yes, yes. So he was.
{136119}{136182}Uh, do you like being a minister?
{136290}{136340}Do I like being a m__
{136415}{136479}Now, why would you ask|a thing like that?
{136481}{136603}Oh, the way you looked just then|reminded me of my father.
{136630}{136718}Once I saw him sorta sad like that,|and I asked him.
{136841}{136890}And what did he say?
{136892}{136993}Oh. Oh, said he was glad he was.
{136995}{137057}But it made him sad sometimes.
{137059}{137153}Just couldn't seem to get through|to his congregation.
{137155}{137203}Sounds familiar.
{137205}{137285}I suppose every minister of|God faces the same problem.
{137287}{137360}Mm, I suppose.
{137362}{137471}Tell me, did your father|ever solve the problem?
{137473}{137587}Well, he read something one day|that he said helped him.
{137589}{137637}In the Bible?
{137639}{137710}No, just something|he read someplace.
{137712}{137770}He had it put on this chain.
{137772}{137856}He wore it always.|It's all I have of his.
{137905}{137993}"When you look for the bad__"
{137995}{138078}Ooh! It always makes me crosseyed.
{138080}{138138}May I?
{138269}{138400}"When you look for the bad in mankind|expecting to find it...
{138402}{138478}you surely will.
{138480}{138588} Abraham Lincoln."| He was the president.
{138590}{138643}Yes. Yes, I know.
{138731}{138798}But I never heard that before.
{138800}{138848}Neither had my father.
{138850}{138925}Anyway, he said|it started him thinking.
{138927}{139041}And from then on, he was gonna|look for the good in people.
{139043}{139132}That's when we both started|searching the Bible for the texts.
{139134}{139189}The texts?
{139191}{139333}Yes. You know. My father|called them "the glad passages."
{139335}{139395}You know, the happy ones like...
{139397}{139484}um, uh, "Shout for joy"...
{139486}{139551}or "Be glad in the Lord."
{139553}{139681}You know, like that. There are|800 happy texts. Did you know that?
{139683}{139752} No, I didn't know that.| Yes, well, there are.
{139754}{139802}And you know, my father said...
{139804}{139918}"If God took the trouble to tell us|800 times to be glad and rejoice...
{139920}{139970}he must've wanted us to do it."
{140007}{140099}Oh, I'd better be going now.|I'm sorry I disturbed your practising.
{140101}{140182}I'll see you later. Uh, goodbye.
{140475}{140523}Goodbye, Reverend Ford.
{140916}{140964}"Dear Reverend...
{140993}{141063}I've taken the liberty of|jotting down a few thoughts...
{141065}{141117}and some text from Matthew...
{141158}{141238}which I thought you might want|to use in your sermon tom__"
{141663}{141754}Oh, my God. What have I done?
{141756}{141804}What have I done?
{142313}{142366}Dear, are you all right?
{142591}{142663}Nobody owns a church.
{142665}{142713}No one.
{143783}{143881}Apocrypha. Ecclesiasticus 30...
{143912}{143978}paragraph 22.
{144047}{144120}"Gladness of the heart|is the life of man."
{144171}{144262}This is one of the rejoicing...
{144264}{144334}or happy texts.
{144336}{144388}Ayoung member of our parish|pointed out to me...
{144390}{144464}that there are 800 such|happy texts in our Bible.
{144516}{144566}Well, she was wrong.
{144602}{144655}There are, to be exact...
{144766}{144865}I know, because I stayed up most|of last night counting them.
{144961}{145030}I intend to read one|of them every week.
{145032}{145133}And that should take us, according to|my calculations, through 1 6 years...
{145160}{145211}if I'm around here that long.
{145294}{145403}But I can promise you this.|If I am here...
{145405}{145501}our visits with God on Sunday|are going to be happier...
{145503}{145557}and more rejoicing too.
{145607}{145655}Eh.
{145824}{145886}Now, what I have to say now...
{145888}{145943}is very difficult for me.
{145983}{146036}But it must be said.
{146062}{146115}I look out to you now...
{146161}{146220}and realize...
{146222}{146290}after four years|in this congregation...
{146340}{146463}I don't even know you. I look out|to you now not as my congregation...
{146465}{146516}but as people.
{146518}{146608}And I say to myself, how sad it is|to have missed those four years...
{146610}{146704}four years when|we could've been friends.
{146706}{146811}I should have been looking|for the good in you.
{146813}{146901}And I__ I failed you. I__
{146973}{147037}And I apologize for this.
{147113}{147222}God is forgiving, but it's not|God's forgiveness I beg, it is yours.
{147317}{147432}I'mI'm not gonna speak about this|any more now. It's a lovely day outside.
{147434}{147518}So let's go outside and enjoy|this Sunday for a change.
{147520}{147586}And while you're out|appreciating the sunlight, just...
{147588}{147686}give a little thought|to who's sending it down to you.
{147688}{147744}Eh.
{147874}{147983}Oh, stop, please.|One more thing, please! Please sit down.
{147985}{148094}Please.Just one more thing.|I'm sorry.
{148096}{148178}There's to be a charity bazaar|in the band park tonight.
{148180}{148236}It's for a good cause.
{148238}{148301}And, um, I want to go on record...
{148303}{148374}as being 1 00 percent for it.
{148376}{148433}So let's all go out there|and have ourselves some fun...
{148435}{148495}because, um...
{148497}{148579}well, if you're not there__
{148581}{148652}Let me put it this way.
{148654}{148725}If you're not there...
{148727}{148824}I'll lam into you something fierce|when I get you in here next week!
{148826}{148901}And you know I can do it too!
{149693}{149777} Where's Pollyanna?| I don't know. I haven't seen her.
{150163}{150224}Be careful when you put those in the|car. Don't you smudge that frosting.
{150226}{150279}Keep your fingers outta there.
{150394}{150460}Nancy? Angelica?
{150759}{150842}Where's Pollyanna, please?|She's gotta be there.
{150844}{150990}It's a big bazaar tonight. Pollyanna's|gotta be there, or she'll ruin the flag.
{150992}{151054}Well, Pollyanna is too young|to be out alone at night.
{151056}{151186} Couldn't you bring her?| No, I could not. Goodnight.
{151336}{151401}Gemmenie! Oh!
{152220}{152268}Pollyanna!
{152446}{152528}What are you doing up here?|You'll fall.
{152530}{152588}You'll fall and kill yourself,|you big silly.
{152590}{152684}You gotta come. You'll spoil|the flag if you don't show up.
{152686}{152791}I can't. Aunt Polly won't let me.
{152793}{152867}Come on. She'll never know.
{153113}{153178}Don't look down.
{153233}{153308} I don't think I want to try it.| Come on. Gimme your hand.
{153310}{153358}I'll help you across.
{153450}{153565}Come on. Easy. Easy. Real slow.
{153593}{153678}Grab that one. All right.|Don't look down.
{153680}{153765} Are you sure it's safe?| I'm sure it's safe.

{170139}{170216}I'd never thought.|The way they bought up those cakes!
{170218}{170289}It's a lot of money for that.
{170291}{170360} What is it, ma'am?| I thought I heard something.
{170561}{170609}Oh, Lord of mercy.
{170701}{170749}Oh!
{170885}{170949}Oh, Angelica,|call the doctor quickly.
{171015}{171066}Oh, my God.
{172230}{172321}If you don't mind, I'd like to speak|to all of you in the salon for a moment.
{172795}{172891}Nancy, when Miss Pollyanna|feels better...
{172893}{172995}I want you to move all of my clothes|and my personal belongings|into the next room.
{172997}{173077} Yes, ma'am.| I want her to stay where she is.
{173079}{173163}It's a larger room,|and it has a much nicer view.
{173209}{173322}And it looks as though she's|going to have to remain there|for quite some time.
{173379}{173470}You might as well know that|Pollyanna's legs are paralyzed.
{173576}{173664}She doesn't know it yet, and I don't|know exactly how I'm going to tell her.
{173704}{173790}I just don't know how|I'm going to tell her.
{174085}{174172}I came as soon as I heard.|Eh, how is the child?
{174916}{174969}Pollyanna!
{174971}{175081}Come on down and play! Pollyanna!
{175083}{175132}We'll go swimmin'. Want to?
{175134}{175205} Pollyanna!| Boy! Boy! Boy, boy.
{175207}{175273}Stop that, stop that.|Now, you go away from here.
{175275}{175382} But I wanna play with Pollyanna.| Pollyanna can't play,|because she's had an accident.
{175384}{175504}Now, you go on home like a good boy.|Go on. Hurry up. Go on.
{175531}{175579}Hurry up. Go on.
{176011}{176093} God works in ways mysterious to man.| Don't speak to me about God!
{176095}{176194}Say what you think.|I can see it in your eyes.
{176196}{176281} They blame me, don't they?| No. No, nobody's blaming you.
{176283}{176401}It's true, isn't it? I could have|been the least bit understanding.
{176403}{176463}That child lies up there|because of me.
{176518}{176618} Polly, the mercy of God is forgiving__| Oh, what kind of a merciful God...
{176620}{176701}could allow a thing like this|to happen to a child?
{176703}{176775}And if he were merciful,|why did he let her come to our town?
{176810}{176876}Let me tell you something,|Polly Harrington.
{176907}{176961}Sunday a miracle happened in this town.|Oh, this town!
{176963}{177070}Yes, this town.|Right out there in that street|the people are smiling at one another.
{177072}{177182}Go on. Take a look for yourself.|It's very contagious.
{177184}{177289}Just think, Polly.|If she had never come to this town__
{177419}{177505}We ought to get down on our knees|and thank God for sending her to us.
{177575}{177657}Excuse me, ma'am.|Dr Chilton wants to see you.
{178075}{178138}Now, you understand everything|I told you, don't you, dear?
{178140}{178222} And there's nothing to be afraid of.| What is it, Edmond?
{178224}{178345}I told Pollyanna about her injury.|She understands. Don't you, dear?
{178347}{178439}We're going to take you to Baltimore|for an operation so you can walk again.
{178441}{178494}You hear that, honey?
{178658}{178729}I know. Why don't we all cheer up?
{178776}{178902}Let's see if we can't find something|to be glad about your staying in bed.
{178904}{178977}Um, oh, I know.
{178979}{179044}This way we can all|have steak and ice cream.
{179046}{179128}Did you know that your aunt|ordered it for you?
{179130}{179212}Now you find something to be|glad about. We'll play the game.
{179276}{179341}Well__
{179418}{179488}I suppose I could be glad because__
{179490}{179546}Yes? Go ahead, darling.
{179618}{179699}No. It was a silly game.
{179737}{179789}I hate it.
{179791}{179855}I never want to play it again.
{179887}{179949}Leave me alone.
{180131}{180188}Please try to understand,|Pollyanna.
{180219}{180293}You're such a part|of our lives now.
{180295}{180396}Nancy and Angelica, Mrs Lagerlof.
{180439}{180519}And I love you as if|you were my own little girl.
{180565}{180640}Won't you give me that chance?|Please?
{181103}{181170} Put these in too, Mr Thomas.| All right.
{181172}{181261} And tell Dr Chilton|that the car's all ready.| Yes.
{181263}{181361}Yes, we're leaving immediately|on the 1 1 :30 train.
{181363}{181432}Well, check the arrival schedule.
{181434}{181537}Make sure we're met with an ambulance.|I want complete X rays|the minute we arrive.
{181567}{181620}Yes. Thank you.
{181773}{181871} Is the operation dangerous?| Yes, it's very delicate.
{181873}{181953}You're coming, aren't you?|I need your permission to operate.
{182090}{182152}Edmond.
{182154}{182250}There's something worrying you,|and I want to know what it is.
{182252}{182358}We can only do so much with surgery.|A great deal depends on her.
{182360}{182468}This depression she's got herself into.|That's what's worrying me.
{182499}{182616}Edmond. She's had a shock.|She's just learned about her legs.
{182618}{182679}I can't have her despondent|like this for the operation.
{182681}{182751} Well, you have to give her time.| Time? There is no time.
{182753}{182830}I have to move her, get her into|the hospital, and I don't like it.
{182832}{182908}What that child needs is|a good shot in the arm of hope.
{182945}{183040}Hope?|What she really needed was love.
{183042}{183113}And that's something|I never gave her.
{183227}{183286}We can still give her that love.
{183288}{183341}You and I together.
{183464}{183554}Ma'am! Ma'am! There's something|very peculiar happening outside.
{183556}{183639}Miss Harrington!|TheyTheyThey'll ruin our flower beds.
{183641}{183723} What are you talking about?| AAAcross the lawns and the flowers.
{183725}{183834}WWe gotta do something. I gotta|stop 'em. Gotta get 'em outta there.
{183836}{183893} Now, let me out.| That's what I've been|trying to tell you.
{183895}{183953}Been trying to tell me what?
{184620}{184674}Oh, not the begonias!
{184711}{184782}Them's Miss Harrington's|favourite flowers.
{184784}{184835}Now, please, folks.|Go around the other way.
{184837}{184918}Don't come through there.|You can go around that tree.
{184920}{185017}Now look!|Go around over by the driveway. I__
{185105}{185172}Oh, the heck with it.
{185295}{185361} What is it you want?| We don't want anything.
{185363}{185422}We just come to say|"How'd ya do" to the child...
{185424}{185484}and bring a bit of gladness|into her life.
{185486}{185549}Like she brought into ours,|God love her.
{185551}{185618}We just want her to know|she's got friends, lots of them.
{185620}{185725}Give her our love and we'll get off|your private property, Miss Harrington.
{185727}{185795}Well, no. Uh, wait.
{185797}{185888}Why don't you tell her yourself?|Open the doors, Nancy.
{185890}{185938}Nancy, open the door.
