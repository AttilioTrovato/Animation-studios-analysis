{86}{142}We're gettin' our ape|and going to Vegas.
{146}{223}By next weekend,|we'll be headlining at the Tropicana.
{227}{283} Nobody is gonna stop us.| Right.
{286}{353}George of the Jungle|must be halfway to Frisco by now.
{358}{443}Ah, but the plotting poachers|were only half correct...
{446}{554}for at that very moment, our handsome|hero was all the way to San Francisco.
{558}{635} Yes, Mother, l'm safe.| You're sure you didn't|catch dengue fever?
{638}{687}No, Mother, l did not|catch dengue fever.
{690}{745} Well, how's your temperature?| Normal.
{748}{825} Colour of your tongue?| Pink.
{828}{877} What about your hmmhmm?| Regular.
{880}{954}Now, Lyle.|How is my darling future soninlaw?
{958}{999}Lyle is__
{1072}{1142}He's happy to be home, Mom.|Could you hold on one second?
{1226}{1367}George, please don't call any animals|into the car, okay? Thanks.
{1370}{1431}Mom? You there?
{1434}{1511}Mom, hold on. l'm losing you again.|George. George. No.
{1514}{1575}Are you paying any attention?|This is important.
{1578}{1704}No. l know it's important. GeoGeo__|George. George. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
{1734}{1802}This faster than riding big,|great, peanutloving poochie Shep.
{1806}{1863}Love you, Mom. Gotta go.|Bye. Watch out for that__
{1904}{1976}Ooh!
{2142}{2193}So, what do you|think of my jungle?
{2196}{2258}This very high tree house.
{2262}{2315}Good place to call friends from.|Sound carry.
{2318}{2378}Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
{2466}{2513}The neighbours.
{2552}{2600} Give it a rest!| We're ten storeys up, George.
{2604}{2681}l don't think the animals|can make it up here.
{2684}{2744}Oh, sure.|George know that.
{2772}{2819}George know that.
{3056}{3106}You must be tired. l'll, um...
{3110}{3191}make the couch up for you|to sleep in the living room.
{3194}{3293}Oh, no. George sleep here|in tree house.
{3296}{3343}Okay. Good night.
{3412}{3474}Sleep sweet, Ursula.
{3478}{3531}Sleep sweet, George.
{3622}{3653}Ooh.
{3698}{3749}Well, Ursula's fiance|is in prison...
{3753}{3806}and there's a jungle man|sleeping on her balcony.
{3810}{3866} She could use a best friend right now.| Hi.
{3870}{3915} Hi.| l got here as fast as l could.
{3919}{3979} Where is he?| He's under the waterf__|He's in the shower.
{3982}{4027}Not any more.
{4030}{4075} George.| Oh. Bad waterfall.
{4078}{4181}First water get hot, then George slip|on this strange, yellow rock. Oh!
{4230}{4326} Hi. George of Jungle.| Charmed, l'm sure.
{4330}{4434}George.|Um, take this big book.
{4438}{4521}Whoop! Cover the booty,|get into decent clothes.
{4524}{4562} Sorry, Betsy.| Bye.| No problem.
{4566}{4650} Okay.| l see why they made him|king of the jungle.
{4654}{4703}Betsy, l am|in trouble here, okay?
{4706}{4785}How am l gonna tell my parents|that my fiance's in an African jail...
{4788}{4832}and that l brought home|a jungle man?
{4836}{4897}You are totally stuck|on George, huh?
{4900}{4967}No, l am not!
{4970}{5073}Can l have him then?|Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.
{5076}{5149}Think, think, think, think,|think, think, think, think.|What am l gonna do about tomorrow?
{5152}{5222}Tomorrow is your engagement party,|and unless they give day passes...
{5226}{5298}out of Bujumbura Jail,|Lyle is not likely to attend.
{5302}{5389}So tell 'em the truth and don't|worry about it and take George.
{5392}{5469} He can back up your story. Right?| Yeah. All right.
{5472}{5522}So l'll tell my dad|first thing in the morning.
{5526}{5621}Make it second thing. First thing, l|suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.
{5728}{5801}Nice butt flap.
{5926}{5997}Being of a conservative mind|regarding gender roles...
{6000}{6049}Ursula Stanhope|wasted no time...
{6052}{6137}in taking George of the Jungle|to a fine haberdasher.
{6202}{6329} And this is Neiman Marcus.| Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.
{6332}{6435}Hello. Would you like|to sample our new fragrance?
{6438}{6485}Thank you.
{6629}{6727}Later, in the men's department, after|discovering his longlost brothers...
{6730}{6840}the jungle king was pleased to find|he looked pretty good in Armani.
{6844}{6906}Pretty darn good.
{6966}{7010}Watch out, man!
{7014}{7096}Why everyone run around crazy,|like antelope in mating season?
{7100}{7177}They're just trying to make a living.|lt's__ different kind|of jungle here, George.
{7180}{7244}lt's survival of the fittest.|Dog eat dog.
{7248}{7326} ''Dog eat dog''__ Dog eat dog here?| No, that's not what l meant.
{7330}{7377}George never bring Shep here.|Uhuh. Never.
{7380}{7467}Every story gets to have a really big|coincidence, and here's ours.
{7470}{7550}Who should see them walking down|the street but Ursula's meddling mother?
{7554}{7602}Uh, yes, uh, Lyle Van de Groot,|please.
{7606}{7679} l'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.| He's not?
{7682}{7730}No. l'm sorry.
{7734}{7791}Meanwhile, back on Ape Mountain...
{7794}{7895}George's friends were going positively|gaga from missing the jungle king.
{7898}{7939}No!
{7943}{8019}Oh, look at this.|lt's ruined. Ruined!
{8022}{8062}Shep, come here at once.
{8066}{8134}Come on!
{8138}{8279}How many times do l have to tell you?|My violin bow is not a chew toy!
{8282}{8321}Bad dog!
{8324}{8403}And you! Out of my sight,|you feathered fool.
{8438}{8553}No! Not on the tree house!|l'll smack you__
{8626}{8675}Ursula, it's Mother.|Pick up the phone...
{8678}{8754}and tell me who that man was|l saw you strolling with today.
{8758}{8854}And where is Lyle?|We must discuss the engagement party.
{8858}{8978}l know you're there, Ursula.|Pick up the phone and tell me|why you have been avoiding me.
{8982}{9038}Pick up the phone!
{9102}{9179}Well, l think that|was an overreaction.
{9218}{9267}Just make sure you stay here|while l'm at work...
{9270}{9377}and you can watch TV|and eat and relax.
{9380}{9436}And l'll be back as soon as l can.|Just stay here.
{9440}{9563}''Stay here''? George is king|of the jungle. No four walls built|by modern man can contain him.
{9566}{9666}Not true. George have every intention|of doing exactly what Ursula say.
{9670}{9786} Really? ls that so?| For a while.
{9790}{9930}And at that very moment,|Betsy and Ursula were on their way to|break the news about Lyle to her father.
{9934}{9995} Good luck, kiddo.| Surprise!
{10102}{10186}Ursula, welcome home,|sweetheart...
{10190}{10239}and happy engagement day.
{10244}{10296}Chock Full O' Nuts
{10300}{10386}The heavenly coffee
{10390}{10486} The coffee that brings you together.| When you're in love
{10532}{10650}Now George understand. George get|coffee, then Ursula want George.
{10962}{11010}Javajavajavajava,|javajavajavajava,|javajavajavajava.
{11014}{11092}So the low has moved offshore.|High pressure's built a ridge in.
{11096}{11146}The weather|is absolutely gorgeous.
{11150}{11210} lf you're not outside, you oughta be!| Who, me?
{11214}{11269} l mean you.| Oh.
{11272}{11314}Okay!
{11318}{11376}And so, jazzed on java...
{11380}{11467}George of the Jungle made his way|into the city by the bay.
{11528}{11574}Whoo!
{11578}{11638}Quickly taking to tourism,|the jungle king enjoyed...
{11642}{11694}the first drivethrough|dining of his life...
{11698}{11777}and strolled the city streets until|he found something so scintillating...
{11780}{11829} he had to say:| Ooh!
{12082}{12135}But nothing excited|the jungle king more...
{12138}{12209}than the sight of the biggest|rope bridge he had ever seen.
{12212}{12299}Ooh. Yeah.
{12796}{12843} Help!| Ooh.
{12846}{12893}Somebody help!
{13202}{13298} To swing or not to swing?| Help!
{13376}{13424}Swing.
{13646}{13766}As the king of the jungle|quickly calculated the angle|and velocity of his next big swing...
{13770}{13838}Ursula felt like jumping|off a bridge herself.
{13841}{13941}l feel so guilty.|l don't know what l'm going to do.
{13945}{14045}First thing: l suggest you tell your|father what you came here to tell him.
{14048}{14101} Hi, Daddy.| Hi, honey. Take a look at this.
{14104}{14186}The most remarkable thing|is happening on the Bay Bridge.
{14190}{14258}...where strong winds|have carried him to the Bay Bridge.
{14262}{14310}Our own Valerie Devlin|is live on the scene. Valerie?
{14313}{14384}Thank you, Terilyn.|We do have a breaking story...
{14388}{14445} at the Bay Bridge...| Help!| where a parasailor dangles...
{14448}{14543} helplessly, 500 feet above the water.| Please! Hurry up! Help!
{14641}{14698}There's no word on who|this lone daredevil is.
{14702}{14790} That's George.| He appears to have some kind|of rope in his hand.
{14794}{14845} He might be preparing to swing on it.| l gotta go.
{15287}{15346}Excuse me, sir.|l have to get on this boat.
{15622}{15707}Hey, fella. George of Jungle.|Need a vine?
{15710}{15794}Hey, thanks a lot, man.|GGet me out of this stuff, huh?
{15950}{16011} Thanks, man.| Oh, don't mention it.
{16014}{16110}King of jungle only here to help!
{16256}{16330} George!| Ursula! Ow!
{16828}{16882}Watch out for that__
{17078}{17135} George!| Ursula!| What are you doing? Are you okay?
{17138}{17235} You just saved that man's life!| George just lucky, l guess.
{17276}{17349}Ooh. This coffee stuff|really work good.
{17378}{17470}...one of the most daring rescues|ever recorded live on television.
{17474}{17581}This is Valerie Devlin reporting|to you from under the Bay Bridge.|Back to you, Terilyn.
{17584}{17669}You know, they say the city by the bay|is the most romantic in the world...
{17672}{17746}and it looks as though|there might be a little romance|unfolding under the Bay Bridge.
{17750}{17817} We'll be back in a moment.| Ohh.
{17820}{17883}Meanwhile, back in the jungle__
{17886}{17977}There's five stinkin' apes out there.|Which one are we takin' to Vegas?
{17980}{18063} The one who's playing chess.| Checkmate.
{18198}{18240} Yes!| Sweet dreams, banana breath.| Grab him!
{18262}{18340}Tookie. Go find George.
{18372}{18419}TookieTookie.
{18604}{18643}Thor.
{18770}{18848}Let's get him in the cage|while he's still under. Come on.
{18914}{18980}As the pesky poachers|grunted and groaned...
{18984}{19048}pushing and pulling|the ponderous primate along...
{19052}{19147}the trusty TookieTookie bird|was already winging to the rescue...
{19150}{19211}making a birdline|for San Francisco...
{19214}{19295}where George of the Jungle was trying|to give the heiress Ursula...
{19298}{19347}the courage to face her parents...
{19350}{19444}by helping her discover|the juju within.
{19448}{19529} Make jungle call.|Then you'll feel brave.| No. l can't.
{19532}{19595} Come on. Big breath.|Here. Support voice.| NNo. No, no, no.
{19598}{19648} Ursula, please? Pl__ Please?| No, no!
{19652}{19756} l can't do it.| Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.|Come on, Ursula.
{20066}{20114} Wow.| Not bad for beginner.
{20120}{20179} Hi, Ursula.| Emboldened with jungle juju...| Hi.
{20182}{20296}Ursula Stanhope went inside|to break the news to her parents,|who took it extremely well.
{20300}{20395}Mother, Daddy,|l love you both very much.
{20398}{20448}l have something|very important to tell you...
{20452}{20507}and l hope you'll understand.
{20510}{20630} l don't want to marry Lyle any more.| We understand, dear.
{20704}{20748}Just kidding.
{20836}{20938} The young Miss Stanhope|proceeded to spill the beans...| So, anyway, l went to the jungle__
{20942}{20986}very quickly...
{21168}{21242}until she got to|the important part at the end.
{21246}{21384}Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle|is in jail and George is with me...
{21388}{21434}and l don't want to marry|Lyle any more.
{21438}{21521}l knew it. lt's that swinging man|from the bridge.
{21524}{21569}l saw you smooching on TV.
{21572}{21646} Mother, we weren't smooching__| How could you do this to me?
{21650}{21718}Don't you realize the calibre of people|who are going to be here?
{21722}{21804} Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say__| l thought we would be|introducing them...
{21808}{21905}to Lyle Van de Groot, not some|wild man you found in the jungle.
{21908}{21971}Beatrice, this is supposed to be|her wedding, not yours.
{21974}{22043} So?| Beatrice, l know you're upset...
{22046}{22123}and so am l, but we can't force her|to marry someone against her will.
{22126}{22197} Why not?| Mom. Dad.
{22200}{22300}l'm ready to go out there|and apologize to everybody|and tell them what really happened.
{22304}{22344}Absolutely not!
{22348}{22442}As far as l'm concerned, you__|you caught one of those viruses.
{22446}{22505}Yes, one of those dreadful|jungle viruses...
{22508}{22560}that get nice girls all confused.
{22564}{22672}And if Lyle survives that|awful jail, you will simply|have to kiss and make up.
{22676}{22776}As for this evening, we will hold|our heads high and we will carry on.
{22780}{22883}Now, darling, where is that charming|young friend of yours?
{22886}{22951} Well, where is he?| l don't know.|He's around here someplace.
{22954}{23029} Well, find him. We haven't got|all day. Oh, Ursula, look!| Oh, great!
{23032}{23160}How wonderful!|And look at Richard's exquisite|figurines of you and darling Lyle.
{23220}{23268}George, watch out for that__
{23476}{23541}Mom. Dad. This is George.
{23544}{23593}Hello, Mr and Mrs Ursula.
{23596}{23637}How do you do?
{24000}{24077}lt is always such a pleasure|to see you, Mr Mayor.
{24080}{24141}And, you know, it's so nice|to get away from City Hall...
{24144}{24194}and be around some normal people|for a change.
{24198}{24326}Well, we are perfectly normal,|l assure you__ in an exceptional way,|of course.
{24330}{24409}Of course.|AAnd what about this guy, Lyle?
{24412}{24493}You know, l'd really like to meet|the man you deem good enough|to marry your daughter.
{24496}{24576}Oh, well, unfortunately Lyle|is busy at the moment...
{24580}{24629}uh, tending to some legal affairs.
{24632}{24769} Some pate, Mr Mayor?| You know, l never touch that stuff.| Oh.
{24772}{24841} l had a lovely time.| Would you excuse us, please?| Excuse me, Dr Goldblum.
{24844}{24933}lt's 7:30. Do you know where|your jungle man is?
{25008}{25073}So this is what you were doing|in the jungle. Clever girl.
{25076}{25185}Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines|and fed me coconut milk.
{25188}{25261} l knew it.| He's not a real meat loaf, is he?
{25264}{25328}No. l mean,|he's not brainy...
{25332}{25404}in that doctor, lawyer,|banker way...
{25408}{25466}but he has something else.
{25470}{25559} He has a__| Sensual intelligence.
{25562}{25609}''Sensual intelligence.''
{25612}{25708} Wow.| Oh, my God.
{25712}{25758}What is it with chicks|and horses, huh?
{26240}{26313}George, how are you this evening?
{26364}{26432}Pretty sharp threads there,|uh__ George, right?
{26436}{26491} Yeah. Where're you based?| The jungle.
{26494}{26545}l hear ya.|We cut our teeth in New York also.
{26548}{26625}Eh, you considering a position|with Stanhope? That could be fruitful.
{26628}{26697}Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.|Nobody here have big coconuts.
{26864}{26894}George.
{26898}{26937}l wa__ Oh.
{26940}{27011}Would you mind|stepping outside with me__
{27014}{27068}Thank you so much__|for just a moment?
{27072}{27128}Sure.
{27188}{27255} Hello, Beatrice.| Hello, Ella.
{27258}{27308}Well, we haven't been friends|for very long, George...
{27312}{27371}but l already think l know|something about you.
{27374}{27501} Oh?| You are in love with my daughter.
{27505}{27614} Oh, Mrs Ursula not so dumb.| George.
{27617}{27741}My concern, however, is that Ursula|seems to reciprocate your feelings...
{27744}{27806}and that does present|a problem to me.
{27842}{27921}You see,|you and Ursula together...
{27924}{28008}would be unbefitting|her social stature.
{28012}{28107}You see? Let me put it in a way|you might understand.
{28111}{28169}Where you come from...
{28172}{28259}zebras marry zebras|and leopards marry leopards.
{28262}{28329}Stripes with stripes,|spots with spots.
{28333}{28440}Well, Ursula is a stripe|and you are a spot...
{28444}{28542}one which l intend to have removed|as soon as possible.
{28577}{28634}So you no want Ursula|to love George.
{28638}{28722}l would rather have my tongue nailed to|this table every morning at breakfast.
{28726}{28787} That hurt.| Not as much as you will|if you do anything...
{28790}{28856}to screw up my daughter's marriage|to Lyle Van de Groot.
{28860}{28956}When Lyle returns, this wedding|will proceed as planned.
{28960}{29046}lf you do anything to upset that...
{29050}{29139}l will remove your reason|for wearing a loin cloth.
{29170}{29214}Steak tartare, Mrs Stanhope?
{29217}{29323}Oh, no, no. Thank you.|l've had quite enough protein for today.
{29327}{29392}Have a pleasant evening,|Mr Jungle.
{29996}{30045}Tookie? Tookie!
{30048}{30161}Tookie.|George so happy to see Tookie.
{30274}{30363}Ape kidnapped?|Ape apenapped?
{30366}{30423}George save Ape!
{30466}{30522}Ursula.
{31854}{31952}Well, of course he went back to the|jungle. Where else would go__ the Hague?
{31956}{32005}But why would he leave|without saying goodbye?
{32008}{32102}Well, personally l think he acted|rather sensibly. Showed good character.
{32106}{32185}He understands that he belongs there,|you belong here.
{32188}{32270}lt's really all a question|of stripes and spots.
{32273}{32347}What? Oh, no.
{32350}{32412}You got to him.|Mother, what did you say?
{32416}{32486}l simply said that if he|really cared for you...
{32489}{32592}he'd leave you alone and let you|get on with your life and marry Lyle.
{32595}{32660} l am not marrying Lyle, Mother.| Beatrice, perhaps we should just__
{32664}{32735}Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,|don't be ridiculous.
{32738}{32827}There's a big difference|between marriageable material|and a fling in the jungle.
{32830}{32900}''A fling in the jungle''?|''A fling in the jungle.''
{32904}{32951}Who says l had|a fling in the jungle?
{32954}{33021}You don't think you can|fool your mother, do you?
{33024}{33107}You've been head over heels for that ape|ever since you brought him here.
{33110}{33233}Now, Ursula, that kind of love|is fleeting. You'll get over it.
{33396}{33482} Did you just say ''love''?| No.
{33486}{33531} You did.| Ursula.| You're right.
{33534}{33599} Don't say it.| l love him. l'm outta here.
{33602}{33695}Ursula, you can't love him.|Arthur, say something.
{33698}{33749} Be careful out there, honey.| What?
{33752}{33808} Goodbye, Daddy.| l love you.
{33812}{33871} Wha__| l love you, Mom. Thank you.
{33874}{33947} Ursula__ Arthur, do something!| What would you have me do?
{33950}{34029} There's obviously no stopping her.| Oh, God.
{34120}{34232} Ursula!| God, that woman's a pain in the ass.
{34286}{34345}Meanwhile,|halfway across the world...
{34348}{34400}another ass was feeling pain...
{34404}{34468}as an ape named Ape|was caged in a cage...
{34472}{34536}hoping to hear|the jungle king's awesome__
{34672}{34722}Hey, l'm pretty good at that__
{34726}{34773}and wondering|if he would ever come.
{34776}{34830}But the motionsick mammal|needn't have moaned...
{34834}{34902}for that defender of the innocent,|protector of the weak...
{34906}{34987}and allaround good guy|George of the Jungle...
{34990}{35050}was closer than he knew.
{35170}{35235}Next time George get bigger box.
{36706}{36758}Oh! Bad luck.
{36842}{36882} Did you hear something?| What?
{36886}{36945} l heard a noise.| Shut up and push!
{37024}{37078}Oh, l think l chipped a tooth.
{37176}{37259} Oh, Thor, you're disgusting.| God, that wasn't me.
{37262}{37329}Not me.
{37896}{37962} l'm hungry.| Oh, shut up.
{37966}{38027}You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,|and l'm gettin' mad enough to__
{38030}{38085}You know, you really should|work on your anger.
{38088}{38179}Have you tried Brankowski's|''Cage the Rage'' technique?
{38182}{38242}Don't let him get to you, Thor.|He's just an ape.
{38246}{38310}That's a fine way to talk|to your meal ticket.
{38312}{38377}You keep that up, it's liable|to affect my stage performance.
{38380}{38443}Give him a banana, Thor.|lt won't be long now.
{38446}{38496}That's what you said yesterday.
{38500}{38548}This trail's taking us|to the middle of nowhere.
{38552}{38634}The sign at the trail head said|''Short cut to Ape River.''
{38638}{38721}Now, why would it say ''short cut''|if it wasn't a__
{38724}{38837}Wait a minute.|Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.
{38840}{38919}Very good, Max.|Actually, the trail is a fake.
{38922}{39044}lt circles Ape Mountain six times before|heading right back to the tree house.
{39048}{39146} Ohh! Oh, l knew we was lost.| Don't listen to him, Thor.
{39150}{39229}He's just tryin' to trick us,|lead us off the short cut...
{39232}{39275}so we take twice as long|on the regular trail.
{39278}{39332}We're already taking twice as long!
{39336}{39406}Are you gonna let a monkey|make a monkey out of ya?
{39410}{39476} What?| Duh!
{39480}{39597}Let's go. lf he tells us the short cut|leads to the tree house...
{39600}{39672}then that's exactly|where it doesn't lead.
{39898}{39955}Ape?
{40494}{40562} Poor apenapped brother.| Careful.
{40592}{40669}Max, look.|We're back at the tree house.
{40702}{40785}Well, l tried, but you fellas|are just too smart for me.
{40788}{40887} Oh, no!| ''Oh, no'' was right,|for the exhausted apenappers had__
{40890}{40988}Hey! Why don't you say something|constructive for a change,|like what we should do now.
{40992}{41082}Because l don't like you.|Well, l hate you, you snotty son of a__
{41086}{41194}l'll pretend l didn't hear that.|Having some fun now, hmm?
{41198}{41263} Thor, were you fighting|with the narrator?| Well, he started it.
{41266}{41303} Did not.| You did too!
{41306}{41348} Did not.| You did too!| Did not!
{41352}{41391} You did too!| Thor, stop it!| Ohh.
{41394}{41457}That's it. l'm not draggin'|this thing another inch.
{41460}{41541} What are you doing? Get back there|and work. Where are you going?| You wretched little weasel.
{41544}{41613}Aren't you the little weasel,|you big brontosaurus?
{41738}{41806} Let's take care of him.| Huh? Huh?
{41810}{41902}Whoa!|Why didn't you come sooner?
{41906}{41967}Why Ape have little stars|around head?
{42044}{42135}George, remember|everything l taught you about|Queensberry rules and fighting fair?
{42138}{42198} Uhhuh.| Well, now's a good time to forget it.
{42202}{42253}Let's finish him off.
{42354}{42460} Oh, l can't breathe, Max.| Let it out, Thor. Let it out.
{42616}{42687}Right, jungle boy.

{56124}{56199}No! No!
{56236}{56378}George, what l came here to say|was that l love you.
{56409}{56518} Ursula love George?| So much.
{56524}{56602}George love Ursula too.
{56606}{56717}And so George of the Jungle received|the first kiss of his life...
{56720}{56781}that came from|neither elephant nor ape.
{56830}{56876}And on the following new moon...
{56880}{56973}Ursula Stanhope finally got|the simple wedding she had hoped for...
{56976}{57042}as the San Francisco heiress|and the king of the jungle...

{57903}{57968}Arthur, l wish you'd do something|about all these monkeys.
{57970}{58029}l feel like Jane Goodall.
{58032}{58158}Madam, l knew Jane Goodall,|and you are no Jane Goodall.
{58484}{58542}Listenin' to some inner call
{58546}{58644}Swimmin' blindly|to throw myself upon your shore
