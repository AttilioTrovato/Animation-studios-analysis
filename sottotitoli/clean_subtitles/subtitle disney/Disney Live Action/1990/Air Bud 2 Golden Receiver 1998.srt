{99604}{99739}It's jackie Framm.|Josh has runaway.
{99742}{99812}Is he there with you?
{99884}{99964}Josh isn't at Tom's house.
{99967}{100032}Uh, I'll try Coach Fanelli.
{100035}{100095}This is all my fault.
{100162}{100246} |Train number 14 from Portland|is delayed20minutes...
{100249}{100308}and will be arriving on track2.
{100311}{100465}That's train number 14|from Portland arriving|20minutes late on track2.
{100468}{100525} 
{100719}{100807}Know what I hate most|about train station food?
{100810}{100908}There's nothing even remotely|Italian about the Italian subs.
{100911}{101063} Oh, hi, Coach Fanelli.| Hey, what do you say, kid?|You mind if I grab some wood?
{101066}{101123}Sure.
{101156}{101217}How'd you find me here?
{101220}{101330}Eh, I ran away more than a few times|when I was your age.
{101333}{101423} Usually I got about this far.| Hmm.
{101426}{101517} I'm leaving.| Where you headin'?
{101520}{101577}San Francisco.
{101580}{101732}Boy, if my star quarterback's|willin' to pass up|the state championship game...
{101735}{101799}there must be somethin'|pretty serious.
{101802}{101871} Hmm.| Wanna talk about it?
{101874}{101966}No.
{101969}{102097}It wouldn't have anything to do|with a new man|in your mom's life, would it?
{102139}{102215}Would it?
{102218}{102284}He's not my dad,|all right?
{102287}{102355}No, I guess he isn't.
{102358}{102430}And you loved|your father very much.
{102533}{102635} So, where you headin'|after football season?
{102638}{102751} I'm running away, remember?| Yeah, well, I mean,|theoretically,
{102754}{102848}if you weren't running away,|what would you be doing?
{102851}{102988} I don't know.|Probably play basketball or something.| Hmm.
{102991}{103060}Well, I would have thought|the way you'd gotten into football,
{103062}{103125}basketball was out.
{103131}{103261}I never said it was out.|I love basketball,|it just that I love football too.
{103264}{103339}How's that possible?
{103345}{103401}You can__
{103528}{103591}You like this guy Patrick, Josh?
{103683}{103776}|Doesn't mean you gotta|stop lovin' your father, you know.
{103779}{103849}Your mom hasn't.
{103852}{103995}Trainnumber nine for|San Francisco will be arriving|in five minutes on track one.
{103998}{104093}That's me.
{104096}{104204}Well, I guess this is|arrivederci, huh, Josh?
{104210}{104268}Good luck, kid.
{104271}{104414}Oh, um, I kinda overheard|you and Mrs. Salter talking.
{104417}{104525}She said that they were gonna|get a new football coach.
{104528}{104598} I'm sorry.| Ah, don't sweat it.
{104601}{104670}I only coach|'cause I love the kids.
{104673}{104807}If winning's all they're interested in,|I'm not the right guy anyway.
{104856}{104938}Take care of your self, kid.
{105026}{105103}Hey, Coach.
{105148}{105205}Um,
{105281}{105377}if it's not|too much trouble, um,
{105424}{105484}can I get a ride home with you?
{105487}{105581}Sure, kid. C'mon.
{105659}{105796} |You don't mind if we stop|for a slice of pizza?
{106390}{106449}Oh, my God, Josh.
{106452}{106618} |Josh! Oh, I was so worried about you!
{106621}{106755} I'm sorry.| Promise me you'll never do that|again, Josh. Promise me.
{106758}{106869}I promise. I'm sorry.| 
{106872}{106940}I'm sorry.
{107022}{107144}Um, where's Patrick?|I gotta talk to him.

{117566}{117709} Oh, this looks like|it's gonna be along day, Phil.| Oh, we're dead. We're dead.
{117712}{117863}Let's look at the scoreboard|and see how much time elapsed,|Phil, before that touchdown.
{117866}{117922} Where is the scoreboard?| Huh?
{117925}{118039} | Stop!
{118042}{118143} Come on, piggies. Work with me!|

{118624}{118704}Natalya, you're back !Oooh!
{118752}{118800} 
{118803}{118876} 
{118877}{118965} Well, it looks like|Coach Fanelli is going to try|to put some points on the board.
{118968}{119114}They're going to go|For a field goal, Phil.|Looks like Vaughn kicking, and__
{119117}{119262} No, it hit Weeble's helmet|and it's way off to the left.| 
{119265}{119352}Well, I guess that wasn't|such a good decision after all,|was it, Phil?
{119355}{119495}I'll tell you, that could|give you some kind of headache.|You know, you get hit with a__
{119498}{119586}

{120338}{120424} josh back to pass.|The ball is in the air__|it's intercepted!
{120427}{120529}Nowhere near a receiver.|And here they come|back the other way.
{120532}{120668}The Giants with__ No, josh has him.|Josh has him on the25.

{121066}{121185}En garde!|Take that!
{121288}{121417} And that!| Natalya! Take this! I've got a net!
{121420}{121512}Not now, Popov! Can't you see I'm busy?|I'm fighting monkey!
{121569}{121648} |Musthurry! Musthurry!
{121746}{121824} |Natalya!
{121889}{121976} 
{121979}{122049} Come down from there!| Natalya!
{122052}{122115} Come get me!| Getdown!
{122118}{122195} 
{122198}{122301}Why don't you get yourself down|and clean up this mess|that you have created?
{122364}{122474} | Popov?
{122528}{122676} Coach Fanelli|takes a heavy anchor|to the half time locker room.
{122679}{122810}Down 24 to nothing.|Disappointed, downtrodden.
{122813}{122870} 
{123235}{123323}Hey, Coach, are you gonna tell us|another one of your stories?
{123326}{123443} You better believe I am.| 
{123446}{123502}This is the story|of a football team.
{123505}{123629}From the beginning, this football team|had heart and ability.
{123632}{123799}But there was one big problem:|they didn't believe|that they could win.
{123802}{123921}And then this dog came along,|and this dog could do amazing things.
{123924}{124036}And suddenly,|the team started winning.
{124039}{124191}But the truth is, even without the dog,|They were winners__
{124194}{124305}each and everyone of them.
{124308}{124441}So if you believe|that a dog can play football,
{124444}{124533}then you better believe|that we're gonna win this game.
{124714}{124806}Now, right now,|let's get out there...
{124809}{124896}and give them|some of that razzledazzle.
{124898}{125070} |Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff,
{125073}{125139} |ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!.
{125142}{125219} |Ruff!. Ruff!. Ruff!.
{125222}{125373} | You guys are the best!|Way to go, Marco!
{125424}{125505}It worked, Pudge!| 
{125552}{125651} |Timberwolves! Timberwolves!
{125654}{125778} Timberwolves!| |Giants on the attack again.
{125781}{125932}Here's Martin back to pass,|he's lookin'__|Ooh, he gets hit at the last minute.
{125935}{126046}They're gonna want that ball.|Goosesteps in__|he has it! it's an interception!
{126049}{126149} Goose! Go! Go!| The 40, the35__
{126152}{126215}Go!Go!|Go, Goose, go!
{126250}{126307} 
{126310}{126416}Well, that looks like|a little bit of inspiration|for the Timberwolves, doesn't it?
{126419}{126524} It just proves my theory.| What is that, Phil?
{126527}{126613}Score more points|than the other team,
{126616}{126689}and by golly,|you're gonna win!
{126731}{126803}All right, Brian!
{126904}{126960}All right? Go. Go!
{127207}{127281} 
{127816}{127890} 
{127988}{128081} | Yes! Yeah!
{128202}{128262} Popov!| Mother?
{128348}{128408}The animals!
{128457}{128562} |What is monkey's business?| 
{128612}{128684} |"Fish Guts. "
{128687}{128766} 
{128814}{128936} | 
{128998}{129106} Natalya__| Get off!.

{133191}{133261} Huh? Come on.| 
{133404}{133491} |Do you have a plan " B"?
{133494}{133648}We are Russian citizens!|We demand you take us|to the Russian imbecile!
{133651}{133755}It's "embassy," imbecile!
{133758}{133815} 
{133858}{133932} 
{133935}{134007} |Martin dropping back, Voss__
{134010}{134076}Oh, is he in the clear!
{134079}{134177}There isn't a Timberwolf|aroundfor20yards.
{134180}{134304}Touchdown! Looks bad now|for the ol' Timberwolves.
{134307}{134385} 
{134387}{134453}Oooh.
{134595}{134676}Now, come on, now. Forget about that__|ancient history.
{134679}{134780}Josh, get in here.|Come here. All right.
{134783}{134920}We're gonna get 'em|with a little "double trouble."|All right? Let's go.
{134923}{135008}But Coach, we've never done|"double trouble" without Buddy.
{135011}{135103}We're gonna have|to do it without Buddy.|Buddy's not here. Let's go.
{135106}{135193}Come on, offense.|Use Goose, all right? Let's go!

{135802}{135951}Good boy! Yeah! Yeah!|Let's go get 'em, boy.
{136009}{136122} | Phil, AirBud is back in the game!
{136125}{136197}Yeah, well,|this dispels that rumor.
{136200}{136263} What's that, Phil?| What's what?
{136266}{136345}Buddy, where were you?
{136566}{136666} Patrick?| Buddy! Buddy!

{139099}{139156}First down!
{139548}{139638} | Another score!
{139641}{139699} That is just amazing.
{139702}{139818} It's New Year's Eve|in the end zone with AirBud!
{139821}{139887}He's got fleas. You can't tell me|he doesn't have fleas.
{139890}{139955}Yea, Buddy!
{139958}{140073}AirBud has certainly|tightened up this game|for the Timberwolves,
{140076}{140151}but they're gonna need|another touchdown in order to win.
{140154}{140228}And now, this could be it!
{140231}{140294} Buddy!| Ooh, no!
{140300}{140427} 1 84pound crushing tackle by Tyler.| Buddy's hurt!
{140430}{140499}And AirBud is down.
