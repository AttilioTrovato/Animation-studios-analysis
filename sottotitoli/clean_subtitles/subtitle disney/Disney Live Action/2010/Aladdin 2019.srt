Hey, look! Over there!
Wow!
Their ship is so big.
Wish ours was that fancy.
I'd be so happy
if ours was that fancy.
'Cause then...
Why is that?
Because it looks better?
This boat has seen us
through many a storm.
It may not look like much,
but it has something
theirs never will.
What? Wood rot and rats?

Are the children
learning something, dear?
It is unclear.
All right, 
sit, children.
I think it's time
that I told you the story...
of Aladdin, the princess,
and the lamp.
What's so special
about a lamp?
Oh, this is a magic lamp.
Maybe if you sing.
It's better when you sing.
No, no. No singing.
It's been a long day.
Oh, imagine a land
It's a faraway place 
Where the caravan Camels roam 
Where you wander among
Ev'ry culture and tongue 
It's chaotic
But hey, it's home 
When the wind's
From the east 
And the sun's
From the west 
And the sand
In the glass is right 
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly 
To another Arabian night 



Hey! Psh!
As you wind
Through the streets 
And the fabled bazaars 
With the cardamomcluttered
Stalls 
You can smell e'vry spice
While you haggle the price 
Of the silks
And the satin shawls 
Oh, the music that plays
As you move through a maze 
In the haze
Of your pure delight 
You are caught in a dance
You are lost in the trance 
Of another Arabian night 
Arabian nights 
Like Arabian days 
More often than not
Are hotter than hot 
In a lot of good ways 
Arabian nights 
Like Arabian dreams 
This mystical land
Of magic and sand 
Is more than it seems 
There's a road
That may lead you 
To good or to greed 
Through the power
Your wishing commands 
Let the darkness unfold
Or find fortunes untold 
Well, your destiny
Lies in your hands 
Only one may enter here.
One whose worth
lies far within.
The diamond in the rough.
Arabian nights 
Like Arabian days 
They seem to excite
Take off and take flight 
To shock and amaze 
Seek thee out
the diamond in the rough.
Arabian nights 
'Neath Arabian moons 
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard 
Out there on the dunes 

What's your monkey's name?
Abu.

He's a lovely monkey.
Hmm. That's a lovely necklace.
So, where does Abu come from?
He, uh...
Oh!
I think this belongs to me.
Good day, ladies.
Okay.
Abu.



How'd we do, Abu?
Good monkey.

Stop right there, Aladdin.
Whatever it is you stole
today, I don't want it.
Whoa, whoa.
I didn't steal anything.
It's a family heirloom
that's worth a lot.
I'll give you a bag of dates
for it, nothing more.
Zulla, we both know it's worth
at least three bags.
