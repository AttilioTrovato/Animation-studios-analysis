Which pet's address
is the finest in Paris? 
Which pets possess
the longest pedigree? 
Which pets get
to sleep on velvet mats? 
Naturellement 
The Aristocats 
Which pets are blessed with
the fairest forms and faces? 
Which pets know best
all the gentle social graces? 
Which pets live
on cream and loving pats? 
Naturellement 
The Aristocats 
They show aristocatic bearing 
When they're seen upon an airing 
And aristocatic flair in what they do 
And what they say 
Aristocats are never found in alleyways 
Or hanging 'round the garbage cans 
Where common kitties play
Oh, no 
Which pets are known 
To never show their claws? 
Which pets are prone
to hardly any flaws? 
To which pets do the others
tip their hats?

Every truly cultured 
Music student knows 
You must learn your scales
and your arpeggios 
Bring the music ringing from your chest 
And not your nose 
While you sing your scales
and your arpeggios 
If you're faithful
to your daily practicing 
You will find your progress
is encouraging 
Do mi so mi
Do mi so mi 
Fa la so it goes 
When you do your scales
and your arpeggios 
Do mi so do... 
Do mi so do
Do so mi do 
Do mi so do
Do so mi do 
Though at first it seems
as though it doesn't show 
Like a tree, ability
will bloom and grow 
If you're smart
you'll learn by heart 
What every artist knows 
You must sing your scales 
And your arpeggios 
I like a cheecheecheerony
like they make at home 
Or a healthy fish with a big backbone 
I'm Abraham de Lacy 
Giuseppe Casey 
Thomas O'Malley 
O'Malley the alley cat 
I've got that wanderlust 
Gotta walk the scene 
Gotta kick up highway dust 
Feel the grass that's green 
Gotta strut them city streets 
Showin' off my Ã©clat, yeah 
Tellin' my friends of the social elite 
Or some cute cat I happen to meet 
That I'm 
Abraham de Lacy 
Giuseppe Casey 
Thomas O'Malley 
O'Malley the alley cat 
I'm king of the highway 
Prince of the boulevard 
Duke of the avantgarde 
The world is my backyard 
So if you're goin' my way 
That's the road you wanna seek 
Calcutta to Rome 
Or home sweet home in Paris 
Magnifique, you all 
I only got myself 
And this big old world 
But I sip that cup of life 
With my fingers curled 
I don't worry what road to take 
I don't have to think of that 
Whatever I take is the road I make 
It's the road of life
Make no mistake 
For me 
Yeah, Abraham de Lacy

O'Malley the alley cat 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Because a cat's the only cat 
Who knows where it's at 
Tell me, everybody's pickin'
up on that feline beat 
'Cause everything else is obsolete 
Strictly highbutton shoes 
A square with a horn
makes you wish you weren't born 
Every time he plays 
But with a square in the act 
You can set music back 
To the caveman days 
I've heard some corny birds
who tried to sing 
But, still, a cat's the only cat
who knows how to swing 
Who wants to dig a longhaired gig
or stuff like that 
When everybody wants to be a cat 
A square with a horn makes
you Wish you weren't born 
Every time he plays
Oh, a rinky tinky tinky 
With a square in the act
you can set music back 
To the caveman days 
Oh, a rinky tinky tinky 
Yes, everybody wants to be a cat 
Because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at 
When playin' jazz
you always has a welcome mat 
'Cause everybody digs a swingin' cat 
Shanghai, Hong Kong, egg foo yong 
Fortune cookie always wrong 
If you want to turn me on 
Play your horn
Don't spare the tone 
And blow a little soul into the tune 
Let's take it to another key 
Modulate and wait for me 
I'll take a few adlibs
and pretty soon 
The other cats will all commence 
Congregatin' on the fence 
Beneath the alley's only light 
Where every note is 
Out of sight 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Hallelujah 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
I'm tellin' you, everybody 
Everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Yeah, everybody 
Everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Hallelujah
Everybody 
Everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat... 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Because a cat's the only cat 
Who knows where it's at 
Oh, yeah 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Everybody 
Everybody wants to be a cat 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody wants to be 
A cat 
Oh, yeah
