I was Flint's first mate
that voyage...
three days east of Tortola
in the Caribie.
Flint knew an island.
That's where we buried
the treasure.
Gold and blood,
they were Flint's trademarks.
He'd leave both
behind him that day.
Shiver my timbers 
Shiver my soul 
Yo ho, heave ho 
There are men whose hearts 
are as black as coal 
Yo ho, heave ho 
And they sailed their ship 
'cross the ocean blue 
A bloodthirsty captain 
and a cutthroat crew 
It's as dark a tale 
as was ever told 
Of the lust for treasure 
and the love of gold 
Shiver my timbers 
Shiver my sides 
Yo ho, heave ho 
There are hungers as strong 
as the winds and tides 
Yo ho, heave ho 
And those buccaneers 
drown their sins in rum 
The devil himself would 
have to call them scum 
Every man aboard would have 
killed his mate 
For a bag of guineas 
or a piece of eight 
A piece of eight 
A piece of eight 
A five, six, seven, eight 
Hulla wacka, ulla wacka 
Something not right 
Many wicked icky things 
gonna happen tonight 
Hulla wacka, moolah wacka 
Sailor man beware 
When de money in de ground 
Dere's murder in de air 
Murder in the air 
One more time now.
Shiver my timbers 
Shiver my bones 
Yo ho, heave ho 
There are secrets that sleep 
with old Davy Jones 
Yo ho, heave ho 
When the mainsail's set 
and the anchor's weighed 
There's no turning back 
from any course that's laid 
And when greed and villainy 
sail the sea 
You can bet your boots 
there'll be treachery 
Shiver my timbers 
Shiver my sails 
Dead men tell no tales 
Oh, aye. Fifteen men
went ashore that day...
and only Flint, his own self,
returned.
Oh, aye, and then old Flinty...
up and died afore they could get
back to that cursed island...
and dig up the treasure.
No one knows to this day
who has old Flint's map.
Now, isn't that a story
worth the hearing?
It was the first dozen
times we heard it.
I'll drink to that.
But who has
the map now, huh?
Some blackhearted,
squidsuckin' buccaneer?
Or maybe it's
our very own Jim Hawkins.
Eh,Jimmy?
If I had it, my friends and I wouldn't
be here serving you rum, Mr Bones.
That's right. We'd be out
searching for that treasure...
sailing the seven seas
on a fiveyear mission...
boldly going where no man
has gone before.
Say, that's catchy.
Huh. Not me.
If I had that treasure map,
I'd be tradin' it for a decent meal.
Hey, Gonzo, you think
he's gonna eat this?
Aye! Beware the onelegged man!
He's the one to fear!
Don't worry, Captain.
We'll watch for him.
Yeah, I'll watch for him,
if he's deliverin' a pizza.
Even old Flinty
feared him.
If he comes pokin' 'round here,
you run for me whippetyquick!
If we see him, we'll tell you.
Yeah. One leg, three heads...
couple of dozen noses__
if anything weird happens__
And it'll be nay
jokin' matter, hose nose.
The onelegged man
brings death.
Time, gentlemen!
It's closing time!
Ya pays your bills,
and then ya shove off.
Go on. Out ya go!
Oh, you're drunk again,
are ya?
Boys, look at the state
of this place!
How comes it gets to be
such a pigsty, huh?
Pigsty? Hey!
No offence meant, gentlemen, sirs.
No offence meant.
Here's to you, boys!
Time!
I'm away to my room.
Thank you, Mr Bones.
Thank you, Bill.
There you go!
Don't forget to come back tomorrow
for our lunchtime special:
roast suckling__
Huh?
Potatoes, sir. Potatoes.
All right.
No__ No offence, madam.
No offence.
All right, boys.
When you're finished here,
you can go and clean up in the kitchen.
I left some table scraps
in there for your supper.
Oh, yes, and, boys...
last night you forgot
to put out the lantern!
If you forget that again,
there'll be no table scraps for a week!
You're standing on my ear.
Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, Rizzo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's it. Steady.
I hate my life.
I hate your life too.
If I had a life, I'd hate it.
I should just run off to sea
He was my age when he sailed
to China as a cabin boy
Run off to sea
and just leave everybody?
Who's everybody?
I'm an orphan. I've got no family.
Hey, you got us!
Yeah, we're family. Got it.
I mean, some family we are. Be serious,
Rizzo. We don't exactly look alike.
Okay, all right. So I'm a rat and you're
a human being and Gonzo's a, uh__
Whatever.
Yeah. We're still family.
Yeah.
But I wish my life were more like...
one of Captain Bones'
adventures...
sailing the high seas and
searching for buried treasure.
Yeah, discovering lost islands
and weird civilizations.
Navigating with my father's old compass
to wherever the wind may take us.
Off to Zanzibar
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.
To the southwest,
pirate galleons!
To the southeast, multiarmed
Zanzibanian shark women...
and their exploding wigs
of death!
To the northwest,
dirty dishes!
How does she do that?
Might as well start. I'll wash.
Oh, yeah. I'll dry.
I'll break.
I look around here 
and I want to cry 
Me too. Yeah.
I feel like the world 
is passing me by 
It is.
And I just can't 
help but wonder 
Am I doomed to wash and dry 
And is it a curse I'm under 
to do it till I die 
Oh, I hope not.
Yeah.
When I could be an explorer 
Sure ya could.
Sailing off to distant lands 
Not so fast.
Instead of spending 
every afternoon 
Just getting dishpan hands 
My future looks like nowhere 
that I want to be 
There's gotta be 
something better 
Something better 
There's gotta be something 
better than this for me 
Well, now you're talkin'.
If it's weird and wild 
let's go and find it 
The crazier, the better 
is what I say 
Yeah, that's true.
To tell the truth 
I really wouldn't mind it 
Mind what?
If we found someplace 
with ten square meals a day 
Let danger call my name 
If it does 
I'm gonna hide 
I'll put my courage 
to the test 
And I'll be 
by your side 
He'll be by your side 
There's gotta be 
something better than this 
Something more than this 
I know that there's so much out there 
To see 
To see 
And I know 
this life I'm living 
Can't be my destiny 
There's gotta be 
something better 
Something better 
There's gotta be something 
better than this for me 
And me!
Wait a minute. What about me?
There's something better 
than this for you and 
Me 
Enough of this singin'!
Rum! I need rum, lads!
I got the horrors!
Give me rum!
Rum till I float!
All right! All right!
Just one small one.
Don't be giving him
any more rum!
How does she blooming do that?
Shh! Shh!
Billy Bones!
It's me, Blind Pew.
I know you're here, Billy.
Ya snivelling coward!
It's some kind
of a blind fiend.
I believe they prefer
''visually challenged fiend.''
Ah, I heard that!
There's someone here!
Uh, no. Over here!
Hmm, over here.
Billy Bones! Ah,
I'd know that scurvy mug...
of yours anywhere.
Excuse me, sir,
but the bar is closed.
Aha. A pretty
little girl, is it?
Yes. Take me
to Billy Bones, my pet.
YYou've come
to the wrong place.
ThThere's no Billy Bones here,
and I'm not a girl.
Oh, I may be visually challenged,
but I can see you're lying.
Huh?
Good evening, Bill.
I know it's you.
Yes. You thought you could
get away with it, didn't you?
Just take it all
for yourself...
and leave your shipmates
with nothing.
We're not pleased with that,
Bill. Not at all.
We want you to have this!
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cat!
The Black Spot!
But I don't understand.
What is the Black Spot?
The Black Spot's
a pirate's death sentence!
Fabulous.
They'll be comin' to kill me tonight!
We'd better help.
Yeah, yeah, let's get some stuff.
It's my sea chest them lubbers want.
Underwear.
But I'll trick them! I'll shake out
another reef and daddle 'em again!
You wanna run that by us again
in English, Mr Bones?
It's mine! I'm goin'
for that treasure myself!
And no onelegged
son of a bilge rat will__
Captain Bones!
He died? And this is supposed
to be a kids' movie.
Jimmy.Jim.
Jimmy,Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.
You always been a decent sort
to old Billy Bones.
But I'm not Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.
He's Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.
Jim!
Yes, Captain.
Jim,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jim,
Jim,Jim,Jim.
Yes, Captain. What is it?
Take the map!
What map?
The map to old Flint's treasure!
Don't ya understand
what I been tellin' ya?
I was Flinty's first mate!
We all were! Blind Pew and me!
Me own shipmates,
they'll gully me for sure!
And anybody else to get
their mitts on that map!
AAnd gullying hurts, right?
Oh, aye! A lot!
So quick.
Go to my sea chest! Get the map!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, there. There.
Oh, I think I've__ Oh, no.
Hey, guys, look!
Rizzo!
Oh, here!
How about this?
Let's see.
Hey, Rizzo, look.
It is a treasure map.
We're gonna be rich.
We're gonna be dead.
Beware, lads!
Beware!
What? The onelegged man?
Aye! But also...
beware runnin' with scissors
or any other pointy objects.
It's all good fun till
somebody loses an__
Captain?
We're standing in a room
with a dead guy!
Jim!
Oh, Billy Bones!
Trick or treat!
Don't try to hide, Billy!
You know what we want!
Where are ya, Billy Bones?
Where are ya, Billy?
Mrs Bluveridge!
There's no use in hiding!
Can't a woman get her
beauty sleep any more?
Jim, what you doing?
Aha! Aha!
Oh! Voila!
Okay, okay. I found the gun.
Oh, now we gotta load it.
Okay.
Oops.
Okay, where does Mrs Bluveridge
keep the bullets?
Billy's dead, and he hasn't
got the blooming map!
Those little girls must have it.
Yeah!
Get them!
Yeah!
Gonzo! Gonzo!
What? What?
I found the bullets. See?
Here they are. They__
Oops.
Open up in there!
We wants the map...
and we'll skewer anybody
who gets in the way!
Quick,Jim! The back stairs!
Come on.
Run! Run!
Get out of my inn,
you tattooed miseries!
Can't a woman
get a night's sleep alone?
You come here, you!
This gun is useless!
You lost all the bullets!
Well, you're losin' the powder.
The map!
Tell us where it is or die!
Get them!
Run! Run, run, run!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry!
Outta the way! Outta the way!
Get outta the way!
Stop!
Oh, Woof.
Geronimo!
Guys!
Wow! What an exit!
Right through a brick wall!
I am in such pain.
Come on!
I think I smell
something burning, no?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
We can't go home, so__
Oh, no. Uhuh. No way. You're not
taking me on some crazy treasure hunt.
I am staying right here!
Oh, good idea, Rizzo.
Then you can see what halfburned,
vicious pirates look like.
What are we waitin' for?
Gimme that map. Come on. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
What about Mrs Bluveridge?
I'll be fine, boys!
Run for it!
How does she do that?
Who's gonna clean
all this up?
Two for a penny, sir?
I don't want a baked potato.
Lovely hot baked potatoes.
Oh, let's see.
What a night.
There it is!
Huh? Oh.
''Trelawny & Son
Master Ship Builders''
Whoa, whoa!
Reality check here, guys!
Do we actually believe some
bozo's gonna give us a ship...
just because we show him
Captain Bones' map?
It's worth a try, Rizzo.
I don't know.
May I help you?
Yes. Thank you. We wish to speak
with Squire Trelawney, the shipbuilder.
We need a ship.
Ah, I'm sorry.
The squire's in Long Neddry
for the grouse season.
He will return
on the feast of St Lulu.
Thank you.
That's that.
Of course, his rich...
halfwit son
young Squire Trelawney's here.
We'll see him, then.
Well, gentlemen...
this is definitely a genuine,
bona fide treasure map.
Really!
Yes. Mr Bimbo told me so.
Oh, Mr Bimbo lives in my finger.
He's very smart. He's been to the moon.
Thank you. Twice.
I smell a bozo.
Mmhmm.
Well done, Beakie.
Now we know that is definitely
too much gunpowder.
Beaker, stop fooling around.
We've got company.
Oh, hello, chappies. Everyone, this is
Dr Livesey and his assistant, Beaker.
They do research
and development for my papa.
Hello.
Actually, Squire, we were
hoping to meet your father.
We need a ship for an ocean voyage.
Ocean? Ocean.
Ocean?
You know, the ocean?
Oh! ThThe big,
blue, wet thing! Yes!
Say, I know
what's happening here.
You chaps are planning
to sail to this island, aren't you?
To dig up this treasure.
Yes, but we must be quiet about it.
There are pirates
looking for this map.
Isn't that exciting?
Pirates, eh?
Well, that settles it.
We'll use one
of my daddy's boats...
and I will personally finance
the voyage for the treasure myself.
You'll do that? Really?
What are rich, halfwit sons for?
Well, here's the dock.
Jim, where's our boat?
We're on a dock?
No wonder I'm seasick.
Ahoy!
Ah, morning, Squire.
Welcome. Welcome.
Ah, there she is:
the Hispaniola .
Wow!
Come on. Let's go!
Yeah, let's go.
''Take a cruise,'' you said.
Huh?
''See the world,'' you said.
Huh?
Now here we are stuck
on the front of this stupid ship.
Well, it could be worse.
We could be stuck in the audience.
Well, Mr Bimbo...
the ship is provisioned,
the crew is in place...
and the captain should be
on board within the hour.
You have been
a busy little man.
Oh, look, there goes Jim.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Ooh! Ooh, look!
It's the boat
steering thing.
This is called the helm.
Hey, how does it feel,
Captain Hawkins?
Feels like
we're really doing it.
It feels like we're finally
having an adventure!
Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Where's the kitchen?
Heigh ho and up she rises 
Something smells good.
Heigh ho and up she rises 
Cool.
Heigh ho and up she rises 
Early in the morning 
Put him in the longboat 
until he's sober 
Put him in the longboat 
till he's sober 
Put him in the longboat 
till he's sober 
Early in the morning 
What have we here?
Stowaways!
I'm afraid we shishkebab
and barbecue stowaways on this ship.
Wait. I know.
You must be the cabin boys.
Yeah.
Hungry, lads?
Well, in my galley, you're always
welcome to help yourselves!
Yes! Thank you!
Oh, yes!
Well, he's got a healthy appetite.
How about you, funny face?
Huh?
Here.
Hey. Thank you.
My name is Gonzo,
and the guy in your chicken is Rizzo.
And you must be Master Hawkins.
Yes, sir.
Oh, you needn't be callin'
a lowly ship's cook ''sir.''
Long John Silver,
at your humble service.
We're just cabin boys,
Mr Silver.
Long John to his friends.
And believe me, lad...
a friend you can trust
is worth his weight in gold.
There's many a darkhearted
scoundrel in these ports.
Well, what do you mean?
Pirates?
Shh!
Pirates! That's rich!
Pirates? What an imagination.
Give me a cracker.
Allow me to introduce
my pet lobster Polly.
Pieces of eight!
Pieces of eight!
Raised him
from a fingerling, I did.
As fine a crustacean
as a man could ask for.
BBut I thought sailors
had talking parrots as pets.
Talking parrots?
What an imagination.
First pirates, now talking parrots?
What's next? A singing, dancing mouse
with his own amusement park?
That's enough now, Polly.
Go on! Shoo!
Right, me hearties. I'm gonna give you
a cook's tour of this fine ship.
If you're gonna be the cook
on this ship, Mr Silver...
I am definitely gonna need
bigger pants.
What's the matter, lads?
Oh, that?
Lost that timberfighting brigands
off Madagascar under Admiral Hawke.
There's many a man lost a leg and worse
in the service of the king.
Why, look what a cannibal
took off me...
in exchange for me own life.
Oh, you're a fine pair, lads.
That you are.
Bright as buttons,
the lot of ye.
All hands on deck!
Come on, then, lads.
Chopchop! Look lively now.
The captain will be here soon.
Chopchop.
Who's that?
That is Mr Arrow, the first mate,
The captain approaches.
Move aside! Make way!
Make ready for the captain!
Lollygaggers will suffer
his wrath!
Wrath? IIs this captain
badtempered?
Is he badtempered?
The man is a raging volcano...
tormented by inner demons the likes
of which mere mortals cannot fathom.
He's got demons? Cool!
Maniac!
Heighho, everyone.
What__ That__
That's the raging volcano?
He's a frog.
Maybe he gets hopping mad.
Hopping mad.
Piping aboard
Captain Abraham Smollett.
Good day, Mr Arrow.
I knew it.
He's furious.
Ah, you there!
Me?
You were in charge of railing dust.
Thirty lashes, and then
I didn't say that, Mr Arrow.
I was anticipating your whim, sir.
Oh. You must be
the cabin boys.
Yes, sir!
Which one of you is Hawkins?
I am, sir.
I knew your father,Jim.
He was a good man.
Thank you, sir.
Well, this is shapin' up
to be a fine voyage, lads.
Oh, yes, indeed.
One leg,Jim.
Count 'em. One.
Remember what Billy Bones said.
Oh, Gonzo, he seems all right.
I mean, Long John's only a cook.
How dangerous could he be?
Well, I don't know, but I__
Wait a minute. Where's Rizzo?
Enjoy your cruise, sir.
Next!
All right, folks, have your cheques
made out to ''Rat Tours Limited.''
Remember, we put
the rat in ''pirate.''
Why, thank you,
Mr Plagueman. Next!
Rizzo, what are you doing?
What? Oh, this.
Well, I figure
if the treasure map's a dud...
the trip won't be a total loss,
financially speaking.
Well, the wind seems to be freshening.
The tide is with us.
Mr Arrow,
this voyage has begun.
This voyage has begun!
Raise the gangplank!
Right, lads!
Let go forward line!
Let go aft line.
Hard to starboard.
Any man caught dawdling
will be shot on sight.
I didn't say that.
I was just paraphrasing.
Mr Arrow, just set the sails.
Set the sails!
Hey, where's my camera?
I'll miss you! I said I'll miss you!
We'll send postcards!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
When the course is laid 
and the anchor's weighed 
A sailor's blood 
begins racing 
With our hearts unbound 
and our flag unfurled 
We're underway and off 
to see the world 
Underway and off 
to see the world 
Heave ho, we'll go 
Anywhere the wind 
is blowing 
Manly men are we 
Sailing for adventure 
on the deep blue sea 
Safely now, Mr Silver. Let's not
get sloppy just because we're singing.
Aye, aye, sir.
Danger walks on deck 
We laugh at the perils 
we're facing 
Every storm we ride 
is its own reward 
And people die 
by fallin'overboard 
People die 
by falling overboard 
Heigh ho, we'll go 
Anywhere the wind 
is blowing 
Hoist the sails and sing 
Sailing for adventure 
on the big, blue, wet thing 
I love to see 'em cry 
when they walk the plank 
I prefer to cut a throat 
I love to hang 'em high 
and watch their little feet 
Try to walk in the air 
while their faces turn blue 
Just kidding.
It's a good life on a boat 
There are distant lands 
with burning sands 
That call across the oceans 
There are bingo games 
every funfilled day 
And margaritas 
at the midnight buffet 
Margaritas 
at the midnight buffet 
Heigh ho, we'll go 
Anywhere the wind 
is blowing 
Should have took a train 
Sailing for adventure 
on the bounding main 
The salty breezes whisper 
Who knows what lies ahead 
I just know 
I was born to lead 
The life my father led 
The stars will be 
our compass 
Wherever we may roam 
And our mates 
will always be 
Just like a family 
And though we may 
put into port 
The sea is always home 
All right, Mr Bimbo. I didn't know
you had such a good singing voice.
We'll chase our dreams 
standing on our own 
Over the horizon 
to the great unknown 
Heigh ho, we'll go 
Anywhere the wind 
is blowing 
Bold and brave and free 
Sailing for adventure 
It's so nauseating!
Sailing for adventure 
So exhilarating!
Sailing for adventure 
We're all celebrating!
On the deep blue sea 
Ahoy!
Roll call!
Long John Silver?
Aye, aye, sir!
Short Stack Stevens?
Aye!
OneEyed Jack?
Aye!
BlackEyed Pea.
Yeah.
Walleyed Pike.
Aye.
Polly Lobster.
Mad Monty.
Aye.
Sweetums.
Aye.
Old Tom.
Aye, aye.
Real Old Tom.
Aye.
Dead Tom?
Aye, aye.
Cool.
Clueless Morgan?
Huh?
Headless Bill.
Headless Bill.
BigFatUglyBugFace
BabyEating O'Brien?
Aye.
Angel Marie.
Aye, aye.
Gentlemen, may I see you
in my cabin?
Immediately?
Mmhmm.
Who hired this crew? This is
undoubtedly the seediest bunch...
of cutthroats, villains
and scoundrels I have ever seen!
So who hired 'em?
Your finger hired the crew?
No, that's silly. The man who lives
in my finger hired the crew: Mr Bimbo.
What? Ah!
Yeah, he relied heavily on the advice
of our excellent cook, Long John Silver.
A cook? And a guy who lives
in a bear's finger?
Exactly!
I'm starting to worry
about this voyage.
Jim, I know Billy Bones
gave you the treasure map...
but I hope you'll give it
to me for safekeeping.
I'll be careful with it, sir.
Beggin' your pardon,
gentlemen...
but I've come with a bit
of a treat for you.
'Tis my very own best brandy...
laid down by the brothers
of Buckfast Abbey...
vintage 1 737...
to toast
to a prosperous voyage.
Oh, spiffy.
I'm sorry, Mr Silver, but I'm not...
going to allow drinking
on this voyage.
Oh, well, rules are rules.
Oh, but, sir...
'tis a tradition for the officers
to toast to the success of a voyage.
Ah, very true.
No, we must set an example
for this questionable crew.
There will be no consumption
of alcohol of any kind.
Oh, sir, but I can vouch
for this crew myself.
You could sail to heaven
and back with these men.
Well, I'm afraid
I must disagree with you.
Oh.
You wanna knock it off
with the booze?
It's peeling the paint
off of the shuffleboard court.
Yeah.
Sorry.
And that's that.
This conversation is finished.
I understand, sir.
I shall tend to my duty
and see to it...
that every drop of alcohol
is thrown overboard.
Come on,Jim.
Don't bother, Captain.
You can go
if you want to,Jim.
Come on.
Yeah.
Oh, well. I guess the human beings
wanna hang out together...
don't wanna spend time
with a rat and a, uh__
Uh, uh, whatever.
Yeah.
Say cheese!
Cheese!
Oh, that's great.
Cute couple.
Stop it!
I never felt
like this before.
Denise, what I'm trying to say__
Yes?
What I'm trying to say is__
Yes?
What I mean to say is, I__
Yes?
I'm sorry your present
didn't work out.
Oh,Jim, Smollett sails
by rules and laws.
That's what bein' a captain's
all about.
Me, I sails by the stars.
Stars?
North,Jim. Find me north out there
among them stars.
Well, that's easy.
Ah, yeah, but what
if you don't have a compass?
Long John, please don't drop it.
It was my father's.
It's all I have of his.
Please. Please.
I'm sorry, lad.
I were only foolin'.
How old were you when he died, then?
Seven.
I were eight
when my father died at sea.
First mate, he was.
My father was a first mate too.
Was he, now?
By the powers.
What a coincidence.
Now,Jim, that be Polaris,
the North Star.
Even in the China Sea,
that's north.
North. Polaris.
Uhhuh.
So we must be heading southwest.
Smart as paint you are, lad.
Smart as paint.
Now, that gets old Long John
to wonderin'.
Why would we be
sailin' southwest?
The scuttlebutt
among the crew is that, uh...
we're sailin'
for buried treasure...
and, uh, someone on board...
has a map.
'Course,
none of my concern,Jim.
I'm just a ship's cook.
Such matters are best suited
to Captain Smollett.
Come on, Long John.
You could captain this ship.
That I could, lad.
Maybe someday I will.
Moonlight swim?
Okay.
Oh, Smolly, my love for you...
is deeper than
the deep, blue sea.
Get on with you! Go on!
Hi,Jim!
Yo,Jimbo! Mornin', Long__
Hi, Long John. Good morning.
Well, at least one of us
is having a good time.
Ah, Rizzo, it's not so bad.
Angel Marie said that later on...
he'd throw a line out the back
and let me drag along the bottom.
I don't know about this crew.
I feel like they're always
That's just a figment
of your imagination.
This is a figment
of my imagination?
Now, tell us
where the map is...
or we'll tear ya
limb from limb!
Never. My friend
and I will never tell.
Hey, hey, there could be
extenuatin' circumstances.
I mean, you know__
Wh__ I b__ If__
Maybe they'll ask
real nice.
In your dreams!
Do it, Monty! Do it!
Yeah, do it to me!
Yes! More!
Oh, no, I can't look.
Look at this!
I'm taller!
This is so cool!
I may even have a future
with the NBA.
This won't work! He likes it!
Let's torture the rat!
Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Yeah!
Oh, no, no!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, please, no! I hate basketball!
I got a lovely recipe
for blackened rat.
I say!
This does not look safe!
What? What? What? What?
I b__ I burned my hand.
Kiss it or something!
Poodly, poodly, poodly,
poodly, poodly.
Mr Arrow, lock those three up
for the remainder of the voyage.
Yes, sir!
You can't hold us!
To the brig! Move along!
Will you stop crying!
Move along.
Oh, good. That's good. Yeah.
Master Hawkins, may I see you
in my cabin, please?
Yes, sir.
Ready, Mr Gonzo?
Ready!
Tie off the rope, Beaker!
We call this
the window shade cure.
All right.
Snip, snip, snip.
Oh, great! Wow!
That was so cool!
Hmm? Oh, sure.
Who's the lady pig, sir?
Never mind that,Jim. Listen.
I'm hoping you're willing
to give me the map now,
I'd rather not, sir.
I'd hoped it wouldn't
come to this,Jim, but...
as captain, I order you
to give me the map.
Mr Arrow?
Aye, aye, Captain.
Lock up this treasure map.
It will be safe
in here, sir.
It's been six weeks
since we left England.
Five days
since we had a breeze.
No!
I got the madness!
I got cabin fever!
I've got it too!
Cabin fever!
I got cabin fever 
It's burning in my brain 
I got cabin fever 
It's driving me insane 
We got cabin fever 
We're flipping our bandannas 
Been stuck at sea so long 
that we have simply gone bananas 
We, we, we got cabin fever 
We lost what sense we had 
We got cabin fever 
We're all going mad 
Grab your partner by the ears 
Lash him to the wheel 
Dosido, step on his toe 
Listen to him squeal 
Allemande left 
Allemande right 
It's time to sail or sink 
Swing your partner 
over the side 
Drop him in the drink 
We've got cabin fever.
No ifs, ands or buts.
We're disoriented.
And demented.
And a little nuts.
Volkswagen car 
We were sailing, sailing 
The wind was on our side 
And then it died.
I got cabin fever 
I think I lost my grip 
I'd like to get my hands 
on whoever wrote this script 
I was floating 
'neath the tropic moon 
And dreaming 
of a blue lagoon 
Now I'm as crazy as a loon 
Cabin fever 
has ravaged all aboard 
This one small vessel 
has become a floating psycho ward 
We were sailing, sailing 
heading who knows where 
And now though 
we're all here 
We're not all there 
Cabin fever!
The wind is back.
What are we doing?
What's goin' on here?
What was that?
I feel like such a fool.
Yeah, me too.
I hope nobody saw that. Embarrassing.
Get us outta here! Help!
We didn't hit him!
Come on. Let us out.
We was only joking.
Hey, Long John!
Hey, get us outta here!
Heyeyey, Polly.
What?
What was that song that just happened?
What are you talkin' about?
You know.
Cabin Fever 
That.
You see,John?
You gotta get us outta here now!
Clueless is startin' to go crackers!
Here you go.
Your bread and water for today.
But I ordered shrimp scampi.
It's more than you deserve,
ya villainous dogs!
Oh,Jim.
By rights,
I should be locked up too...
for lettin' thieves like them
aboard this ship.
Oh, it chills me...
to think that they almost
killed your little friends...
looking for some
daft treasure map.
None of this would've happened if I'd
have given Captain Smollet the__
What, lad?
I'm not really sure I should be talking
about this with you or with anyone.
You mean, you've really
got a treasure map?
Not any more. Mr Arrow took it and
locked it up in the captain's cabin.
You must promise
to keep it a secret.
Don't bother your head about that.
You've only told old Long John.
Now, you run along
and do your chores. Go on.
Go on.
Safely now. Safely.
Steady as she goes.
Oh. Mr Silver, good evening.
Wicked fog tonight, sir.
Reminds me of the night
we ran aground off the pampas.
Half the crew drowned
in leaky lifeboats.
Ah, it were
a terrible shame.
Leaky lifeboats?
Oh, a common occurrence, sir.
A littleused piece of equipment
falls into disrepair...
and becomes, shall we say__
Unsafe?
Oh, I'm not sayin'
our lifeboats are unsafe, sir.
I'm not sayin'
we got problems__
Still__
Hmm. Hmm.
The caulking appears tight.
No dampness under the gunwale.
This one seems seaworthy.
Well, sir, they do, of course, until
you get them out in the open ocean.
Cast me off, Mr Silver.
Oh, yes, sir.
Oh, sir, is there anything I can
hold for you for safekeeping?
Your hat? Your coat?
Your keys?
Hmm? My keys?
Of course. If they were to fall
overboard, it would be disastrous.
Oh, that it would, sir.
Cast me off, Mr Silver!
Aye, aye, sir!
Thank you, Mr Silver.
Just doin' my duty, sir.
Oh, yes,John.
Man overboard!
Yes.
I'm sorry, sir.
Wha__
Mr Arrow's gone overboard,
and...
all we found was his hat!
Oh, no.
And so, my friends, the sea has claimed
another loyal officer and friend.
This was a person who served__
I got it! I got it!
Okay, after you, Monty.
No, after you.
Will you just come on.
Mr Samuel Arrow,
a wonderful man who...
used to get us up from our beds
before dawn for a good flossing.
Okay, okay. Now, spread out
and find the map.
May the wind be ever at your back,
Samuel Arrow. Rest in peace, my friend.
Amen.
Amen.
Shh.
See? See?
Wait. Open it. Open it.
No, no, no, we gotta take it
to Long John. Come on.
This apple has a worm in it.
That's not a worm.
That's my tail.
What's wrong?
It just feels so weird.
You mean, that Mr Arrow's dead?
Yeah, that, and my pants
are filled with starfish.
You and your hobbies!
Rizzo!
Jim, we've missed you! Climb in!
Can't. I'm doing my chores.
Oh, come on. Share an apple.
Yeah, come on!
Anyway, here's the plan.
I say we should kill that captain now.
And then we'll get
that twit of a bear!
Oh, hi, Long John.
I'm an easy man.
A gentlemen of fortune, says most.
But it makes me sick at heart
to sail with the likes of you.
Now, get this straight.
If anyone mutinies
before I says so...
I'll throw you overboard
like I did that scurvy mate Mr Arrow!
I says, let the captain
steer us closer to the island.
I've got the lad's
treasure map now.
When the time is ripe,
we'll kill 'em all!
That's what I said!
That's what I said!
Land ho!
Come on, lads! Let's go!
Yea! Land ho!
Oh, my goodness.
Land ho!
Beachfront property!
Retirement estates!
Bikinis!
Bikinis!
Throw the mainsail!
Drop anchor!
Bring her up
hard of starboard, helmsman.
Bring those barrels
over here, lads!
Helmsman, give a hand
with the longboats.
Captain, may I speak with you?
I'm sort of busy right now,Jim.
But, Captain, we just heard.
Long John is planning a mutiny,
Yeah.
I see.
Mr Silver?
Aye, aye, Cap'n!
Mr Silver, I want you
to take the crew ashore at once.
We need water and provisions.
Take as long as you want.
Sir! 'Tis a task to my liking, sir.
That it is!
Quickly, boys. Gather the officers
and meet me in my quarters. Quickly.
This is a lucky break.
Captain lettin' us go ashore.
Us with the map and all.
It's like giving the treasure to us
on a silver platter.
Aye, that it is, Polly.
Never trust a silver platter.
Follow me, Beakie. Come along.
Jim, lad!
There's room in the boat for one more.
Come along for an adventure.
II can't. The captain wants me.
Oh, what a shame!
I'll miss you, lad.
That I will.
Um,Jim! I seem to have
left my crutch on board.
Hand it to me like
a good lad, will ya?
There's a good boy.
Have to be a bit closer than that.
Can't reach it from there.
Oh!
Oh! Ah!
Cast away, men!
Be quick now!
Go, go, go!
Don't splash!
The plan is simple.
Once the pirates are ashore,
we set sail and return in a year or so.
By then, all the fight
should be out of'em.
That's a brilliant plan.
Except for one thing.
What's that?
The pirates have Jim!
I'm tired!
You're what?
I'm gettin' tired!
He says go faster.
I'm gettin' tired!
Hey, man! I can't figure out
what side we're on.
Are we with the pirates
or the frog captain?
Oh, hey, man,
just play the gig.
Never get involved in politics.
Politics!
Politics!
Jim, lad!
Easy,Jim.
'Tis all in good fun.
Pleased I am to initiate you
into our enterprising, um, company.
Which entitles you
to all the benefits thereof.
But I don't want any benefits.
This is a onetime
Say no, and I will be forced
to, um, terminate our relationship.
You're nothing but murdering pirates.
Pirates!
Pirates. Oh,Jim.
If that's what
you're thinking...
you're dead wrong.
When I was just a lad 
Looking for my true vocation 
My father said 
Now, son, this choice 
Deserves deliberation 
Though you could be a doctor 
Or perhaps a financier 
My boy, why not consider 
a more challenging career 
Hey, ho, ho 
You'll cruise to foreign shores 
Sing it, lads!
And you'll keep your mind and body 
sound by working out of doors 
True friendship and adventure 
are what we can't live without 
And when you're 
a professional pirate 
Upstage, lads!
This is my only number.
Now take Sir Francis Drake 
The Spanish all despise him 
But to the British he's a hero 
and they idolize him 
It's how you look at buccaneers 
That makes them bad or good 
And I see us as members 
of a noble brotherhood 
Hup!
Hey, ho, ho 
Oh, I love it!
We're honourable men 
And before we lose our tempers 
we will always count to ten 
On occasion there may be 
someone you have to execute 
But when you're 
a professional pirate 
You don't have 
to wear a suit 
What?
I could have been a surgeon 
I could have been a lawyer 
but I just had too much heart 
I could have been in politics 
'Cause I've always been 
a big spender 
And me, I could have been 
a contender 
Some say that pirates steal 
And should be feared and hated 
I say we're victims 
of bad press 
It's all exaggerated 
We'd never stab you 
in the back 
We'd never lie or cheat 
We'rejust about the nicest guys 
You'd ever want to meet 
Well, look at us,Jim.
We're a festival
of conviviality.
Congeniality.
That's conviviality, stupid.
That's what I said.
We're ready, O capitán .
Good. You men guard the ship
while I'm gone. We'll be back
Aye, aye, Captain.
Cast off, Mr Beaker.
Thanks for coming along, men.
Are you kidding? Jim is family.
Yeah.
Tell the truth, lad.
Do you really think the captain
and the squire...
are planning to share the treasure
with the likes of us?
Can't hear ya.
No?
And we being
the rightful owners.
Flint's own crew, who shed
our blood getting it here!
Join us, lad.
Donate your compass to the
treasure hunt and get a full share!
Hey, ho, ho 
It's one for all for one 
And we'll share 
and share alike with you 
And love you like a son 
We're gentlemen of fortune 
and that's what we're proud to be 
And when you're 
a professional pirate 
You'll be honest 
brave and free 
The soul of decency 
You'll be loyal and fair 
and on the square 
And most importantly 
When you're 
a professional pirate 
You're always in the best 
Of company 
Down!
There! Captain Smollett
Don't get your hopes up, laddie.
I've taken the liberty of hiding
a few of my best men aboard.
If a second round follows...
it means they've
taken over the Hispaniola ...
and I'm the new cap'n.
Now, then.
Yea!
How infortuitous our firearms
weren't loaded, Beakie.
I'll say.
We might have shot somebody.
I'm the only friend
you got in the world now,Jim.
Let's dig up
the treasure together, eh?
Shipmates, remember?
We'll be needing your compass, though.
No.
I'll be taking it
either way,Jim.
Yea!
Come on then, lad.
Let's not waste time.
Well, it's too dark
to do anything now.
We'll camp here
and wait for first light.
Oh. Hey, Rizzo, relax!
Don't be so afraid.
Oh, I've gone
way beyond afraid.
Right now I'm somewhere between
bedwetting and a neardeath experience.
Good night, boys.
Well, good night.
'Night, Rizzo.
Yeah, sure.
Gonzo?
Is that you, Gonzo?
Boy, Gonzo, it sounds like you're
coming down with a little cold there.
III'm just gonna light a match,
if you don't mind, here.
Long John, look!
Flint hung 'em up there
after he gullied 'em...
to mark the trail
to the treasure.
Wicked sense of humour
ol' Flinty had.
IIt's a sign. This is a cursed place.
Yeah!
Well, there's
an informed opinion.
All right,Jim, lad,
where to from here?
''On a heading
of 1 7 9 degrees...
walk 31 2 paces
from where the dead men hang high.''
That way!
We're gonna go? We're gonna__
Come on!
Howdy vous, 
stinky froggy man and friends.
I am Spa'am,
High Priest of the Boars.
You mucho wickedness
go trespass on island.
Now you suffer the wrath
of our queen...

Terrific. Captured by crazed wild pigs
and sacrificed hideously
Are we lucky or what?
Silence, smelly sailor mans!

Hiya!
Oh, uh, old girlfriend.
Tie 'em back

This is it.
What if Clueless is right?
WhWhat if it is ccursed?
I'll show you what
I think of your curse.
You mewling, little,
lilylivered...
toffeehearted,
little wuss of a crustacean!
''Treasure buried here.''
Oi, we don't even
have to dig it up!
Come on, mates!
The treasure's ours!
There's no treasure, Silver!
You brought us here for nothin'!
Yeah!
And now we'll be tried for mutiny!
That's right!
Yeah!
I say we should kill him!
Run, lad!
Save yourself!
Why are you doing this for me?
Because I like you, boy.
I hope you didn't think
I was lying about that.
Get him!
Run!
Take greeny, flippy,
bulgyeyed one away.
What?
Others stay. Chopchop!
What? Oh. Ah. Oh. Uh.
Hey, wait! Where are you taking him?
Hmm verdideevoom 
Verdideedoo 
Verdiverdideevoom 
verdivoo 
Bork, bork 
Hmm. First takeee the mousie,
then skewer the mousie!
Well, how else do you think
we were gonna get him in this movie?
Oh!
Whoa!
Oh. I wish we were back at the
Admiral Benbow eating table scraps.
Well, this is terrible! This is the
worst thing that's ever happened to me!
Wait a second! I've been cut loose!
Hiya, guys.
Jim, they've got Captain Smollett.
I know. Come on.
Oh, okay.
Where will we go?
Tom, Tom, Tom!
Ohhh!
Dead Tom's dead!
Long John shot him!
But Dead Tom's
always been dead.
That's why he's
called Dead Tom.
Oh.
Can we get on with this?
Clueless!
Yeah, yeah?
Give it to him!
Yeah!
But, uh, it's not
even his birthday.
No, no, no, no! The paper!
Oh.
This is for you.
The Black Spot?
Yeah.
You dare to give me
the Black Spot?
Uh, hehe told me to.
Wh__ Shut up, will ya?
And it's drawn
on a page from the Bible.
You tore a page
from the Holy Scriptures...
to make a pirate's death sentence?
Uh, here.
Ohhh, the red hot
gates of hell...
are creeping open!
Satan is heating
his pokers for you...
you blasphemous heathens!
Fall down on your knees...
Oh!
and beg for deliverance
from damnation!
Please forgive us.
Please forgive me!
Very good.
You're forgiven.
Oh, thank you.
Now untie me!
Okay, okay. Untie him.
And let's go find the treasure!
Yeah!
Oh, oh, you are a good man.
You are a kind man.
A handsome man.
Precious.
Oh, he's__ You're precious aand__
Beautiful.
And he's beautiful. Oh.
Yeah, here's the boat.
Oh, no!
Well, that won't help us.
We're gonna have to swim to the ship.
Hello! Earth to Jimbo.
Swimming to a ship that's full of
killer pirates to save the captain
Look!
Yes. The gunwale and keel
Mr Arrow!
Mr Arrow!
Over here!
Mr Arrow, over here!
Oh. Oh, boys.
Come join me...
aboard this exceptionally
safe little boat.
Hmm.
By the way, that Silver fellow
may not be trustworthy.
Haha! Now he tells us!
Yeah.
And here's a photo opportunity
you will not want to miss.
The actual jungle location for the movie
Muppet Treasure Island .
Oh, my goodness!
Keep up, people.
Hey, when do we eat?
Oh, my feet are killing me.
Of all the backwater,
noclass piles of sand in the ocean...
you had to wash up on mine.
Benjamina, I just want you
to know that I'm sorry.
Sorry? No, no,
sorry doesn't cut it.
You left me standing
at the altar!
I was on a ship headed
for Zanzibar. I got cold feet.
You're a frog.
You're supposed to have cold feet.
My mother came
all the way from France.
I was wearing
her white lace dress.
The cake was filled
with lemon custard!
Mina, fate has brought us
together again.
Well, actually, buried treasure
and pirates brought us together__
Don't you start with me
about pirates!
After you jilted me, I took
up with this Bernie Flint.
The man was totally codependent.
You and Captain Flint?
Well, he was a pirate, I was a lady.
You know the story.
Smolly? He marooned me.
Me!
Oh. Oh. Oh.
ThThis is all my fault.
Oh, what have I done to you?
Mushymushy!
Kissykissy!
Bravo, Cap'n.
Touchin' reunion, Benjamina.
This seems to be your day
for renewing old...
acquaintances.
Oh, well, hello, Long John.
Oh, no! Him too?
Well, if you'd married me.
Well, what does that
have to do with it?
I'm a pig! I need commitment!
Commitment?
Now, I'm not gonna be really patient
about this, Benjamina.
Where is the treasure?
Um, I just may not
tell you. Hmm.
Oh, don't play games with me, lass.
I tell you,
I'm not a patient man.
Stop! Give up now...
weak and tiny pirate mans...
or die like stinking dogs.
Hmm, we see you have
boomboom sticks.
Byebye.
Oh, brother!
Now, Benjamina.
What?
Where is the treasure?
There is no treasure.
IIt was all a clever ruse. HHa!
So where did you get that
gold necklace you're wearing?
The one made
of Spanish doubloons.
Aye.
Um...
Shopping Channel?
No!
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Oh, fiddle!
Make yourself useful.
Try and save us. Do something!
Shh!
Oh, Master Hawkins,
you've come to rescue us.
I should've let him
live in my finger.
We're ready,
Master Hawkins.
Do you think this
will work, Dr Livesey?
My research indicates
that pirates are very superstitious.
Boogie, boogie, boogie!
I am the ghost
of Samuel Arrow.
Boogie!
Come on.
We've got to save the captain!
You were so good, Mr Arrow.
That was beautiful.
What do we do next?
What do we do now? Uh,Jim?
Weigh anchor?
Weigh anchor.
Set the sails.
Set the sails!
And you, Squire Trelawney.
Uh, nnnow, Master Hawkins, III__
You take the helm.
Ah! Step aside, Mr Bimbo.
I shall be taking the helm.
Hurry, Rizzo!
I'm going as fast as I can.
Oh! Smolly, my love!
Oh, oh!
Smolly!
You can't hurt my frog!
Don't tell him anything, Mina.
I beg you!
He'll only kill you too.
Don't listen to him!
Now...
for the last time...
where's the blasted treasure?
Yeah!
Hah!
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
The treasure's at my place.
North trail, splitlevel hut
with the pink lawn furniture.
Now free him at once,
you scoundrel!
You know, I'm beginning to see
a pattern in the men I date.
Yeah, well, uh, uh,
the past is behind us.
And the future below us.
Oh, it's okay, Mina.
We're together again.
Yes, despite it all...
we have each other.
Oh, don't cry for me, Benjamina.
Pardon?
Was I dumb 
or was I blind 
Or did my heart 
just lose its mind 
Why'd I go and throw 
Our perfect dream away 
Looking back 
I'll never know 
How I ever let you go 
But destiny could see 
we deserved 
To have another day 
Love led us here 
Right back 
to where we belong 
We followed a star 
and here we are 
Now heaven seems so near 
Love led us here 
Now I know that life 
Can take you by surprise 
And sweep you off your feet 
Did this happen to us 
Or are wejust dreaming 
Love led us here 
Right back 
to where we belong 
We followed a star 
and here we are 
Now heaven seems so near 
Love led us here 
So take my hand 
And have no fear 
We'll be all right 
Love led us 
Here 
Oh, Smolly.
You saved me.
Come on, men!
It's back to Blighty now, lads!
The treasure's all ours!
Hurry. Come on.
Get in the boat.
Long John! Long John!
Look! The ship!
Uh, yeah__
What are they doing?
There's no one on board.
It's coming
straight for us!
IIt's the ghost
of Captain Flinty.
He's coming to kill us.
Come back, you cowards!
Hawkins.
Look. It's the captain
and the pig.
Oh, no!
Head for those cliffs.
Head for the cliffs, Squire.
Aye, aye! Uh. Oh.
Oh, Beakie, Beakie.
Look, look!
I think we're going to need a net.
Come along.
Get back there,
you yellowbellied bilge rats!
I'm not losing
that treasure now! Get out!
We're lowering the net now.
All right, let's go. Okay.
That's it. Beautiful. Beautiful.
We're coming, Captain Smollett!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Steady! Steady!
Careful!
Au revoir, mon capitaine .
We got 'em!
Oh, ho, ho! Yes!
Ahh!
Oh, no!
Waldorf, you old fool!
We're heroes!
We saved the pig
and the frog!
Well, it was too late
to save the movie.
Welcome aboard,
Captain Smollett.
And welcome
to your lady pig friend.
Ah! Look out! Ah!
The captain must have his sword.
Whoa!
Wow! Ha!
Yah!
Captain!
Fight, you idiots!
Captain!

Ha! Ah!
Wah!
All right! No more Ms Nice Guy!
No one maroons me
and gets away with it!
Good to see you alive, Mr Arrow.
Huh! Thank you, Captain.
Geronimo!
Oh, what am I gonna do? Oh!
Come on!
Come on, you! Hey!
Oh, sorry.

Oh, watch out, Mr Arrow!
Well, thank you. But aren't you

Are you kiddin'?

And as for you!

Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size, huh?
Ah. Hahahaha!
Wow!
Yes! Yes! Smolly! Yes!

Haha, Silver!
Haha, hoho!
Not bad for an amphibian.
Smolly, Smolly, he's our man!
If he can't do it, no one can! Yea!
Hohoho! Haha!
Excuse me.
Ohhh!
Uh__ Uh__ Uh__
I'm a frog.
You know, slippery hands.
Uh, you know, I never really believed
that violence solved anything anyway.
Really? Allow me
to disagree, Cap'n.
Kill Captain Smollett,
and you'll have to kill me.
Kill Jim,
and you'll have to kill me.
Kill Gonzo,
and you'll have to kill me.
Kill Squire Trelawney
and Mr Bimbo...
and you'll have to
negotiate strenuously.
Going somewhere,
JohnJohn?
Well, Mr Hawkins,
it seems your little family...
has come together
against me.
We're doomed.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I, for one,
feel better about myself.
Yeah. AAnd I believe
that I have learned a valuable lesson.
Why, you!
Shut up!
Okay, stop biting me.
Okay, I said something wrong!
Silver!
I suppose you'll be blowing
the whistle on me now, won't you,Jim?
I suppose I will. You have to return
to Bristol to stand trial.
Oh, I'm sorry,Jim.
I got a terrible fear of hanging.
We're shipmates, aren't we,Jim?
Gentlemen of fortune, together.
Give us one more chance?
Oh, hell,Jim.
I could never harm you.
You're honest
and brave and true.
You didn't learn that from me.
I learnt it from my friends,
Now take your oars and row away.
I never want to see you again, ever.
Oh,Jim!
'Tis a shame, really.
We'd have made
Well done,Jim.
Your father would be proud.
Captain Smollett,
I have most distressing news.
One of the jolly boats is missing,
and I know for a fact
Ahhh!
This is not fun.
Flaubert, meet DaDa.
Ready to sail, sir.
Hmm.
Where to,
Captain Hawkins?
To wherever the wind
may take us.
Off to Zanzibar,
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.
Oh, brother.
Here they go again.
Love power 
Love power 
Love power 
A little love power 
Stronger than the hurricane 
And softer than 
the summer rain 
Love power 
What kind of power 
A little love power 
It can lift you up 
Lift you up when you get low 
And make your life 
bright as the rainbow 
Whoaoh 
There ain't no sun 
in the morning sky 
Whoa ohohohoh 
Breeze ain't blowing 
and the bird don't fly 
Whoa ohohohoh 
Then someone kind 
reaches out a hand 
And smiles 
a warm sweet smile 
And then your heart 
come to understand 
What make the world spin 
Where do magic begin 
Someone to believe in 
Feel so good 
when everybody feels 
Love power 
There's no higher power 
A little love power 
Nothing in the world 
Stronger than the hurricane 
And softer 
than the summer rain 
Oh, love power 
Everybody, feel it 
A little love power 
Ohohohoh 
Lift you up when you get low 
And make your life 
bright as the rainbow 
Whoaoh 
So many people 
they feel so bad 
Whoa ohohohoh 
Yeah, they make the money 
but they still so sad 
Whoa ohohohoh 
Nobody told them 
that it ain't that stuff 
That makes life worthwhile 
'Cause even if 
you've got enough 
You got less than nothing 
till you know for certain 
Enough to put your faith in 
It feels so good 
when everybody feels 
Love power 
People, can you feel it 
A little love power 
Lift you up when you get low 
And make your life 
bright as the rainbow 
Let me tell you now 
Whoaoh 
Feel the inspiration 
Hey 
Don't it feel like heaven 
It make the soul 
and the spirit strong 
When everybody come 
and every single one 
They hear the song now 
Oh, love power 
A little love power 
Stronger than the hurricane 
And softer 
than the summer rain 
Can you feel it, oh 
Love power 
What kind of power 
A little love power 
It can lift you up 
Lift you up when you get low 
And make your life 
bright as the rainbow 
One love 
Lift you up when you get low 
And make your life 
bright as the rainbow 
May I call you Johnny?
Stop me if you heard this one.
Why does the ocean roar?
Give up?
You would, too, if you had
crabs on your bottom...
and oysters in your bed.
Get it? Oysters? Bed?
Ooh, I love that one.
I'm tellin' ya, I got
a million more just like that.
Was I dumb 
Or was I blind 
Or did my heart 
just lose its mind 
Why'd I go and throw 
Our perfect dream away 
Oh, looking back 
I'll never know 
How I ever let you go 
But destiny could see 
we deserve 
To have another day 
Love led us here 
Right back 
to where we belong 
We followed a star 
and here we are 
Now heaven seems so near 
Love led us here 
Love led us here 
Ooh 
I confess 
It's sad but true 
Sad but true 
I lost myself when I lost you 
But I held your memory 
Through each lonely night 
Oh, let's forget 
What's gone before 
What's gone 
Now we both 
know so much more 
And we've been given 
another chance 
To make it work out right 
Make it work 
Love led us here 
Right back 
to where we belong 
We followed a star 
and here we are 
Now heaven seems so near 
Love led us here 
Now I know that life 
can take you by surprise 
And sweep you off your feet 
Did this happen to us 
Or are we just dreamin' 
Dreamin' 
We followed a star 
and here we are 
Now heaven seems so near 
Love led us here 
So take my hand 
And have no fear 
We'll be all right 
Love led us 
Here
