This global warming is killing me.
This is too hot,
the Ice Age was too cold.
What would it take to make you happy?
This I like.
Oh, no, you won't catch me.
No running, James. Camp rules.
Make me, sloth.
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.
Water ball.
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.
Hector, no, no, no,
you can't peepee there.
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...
Piñata!
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.
OK.
Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
Mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.
Let's bury him.
Yeah!
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?
Manny, don't squash their creativity.
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammalsjammals.
Wanna give a sloth a hand?
Look, I opened my camp.
"Campo del Sid". It means Camp of Sid.
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.
Not in front of the kidz.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?
Don't make me eat you.
They kid. That's why they're called kids.
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.
I can see that.
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.
Come on, Sid.
Sid, we were just kidding.
Hey, let's play
pinthetailonthemammoth.
Yeah!
Sid!
I can do stuff.
Won't give me their stupid respect.
I'll show 'em.
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.
And they lived happily ever after.
Good job.
Question.
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.
See, that's why I called it a burro.
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.
Boring.
It's not believable.
Do burros eat their young?
It's not a good ending.
Sometimes I throw up.
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Where's your big, happy family?
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids.
You OK, buddy?
Sure. Why not?
I thought...
Story time's over. The end.
Run for your lives!
Where's everybody going?
The world's coming to an end.
What are you talking about?
Fast Tony he says
the world's gonna flood.
Folks, I hold in my hand
a device so powerful,
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky.
Yeah, right.
Gather round, gather round.
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?
So you can't breathe underwater?
My assistant here will demonstrate.
Hey, I can smell the ocean.
What are you doing?
I can't sell that now.
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.
Through its design
and sturdy construction,
you'll have plenty of air
for eons to come.
Of course, results may vary.
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.
It's my weather forecast. The fiveday
outlook calls for intense flooding
followed by the end of the world.
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.
You see this ground,
it's covered in ice.
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.
A thousand years from now,
it will still be ice.
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?
What are you talking about?
About you being the last of your kind.
Your breath smells like ants.
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?
Don't pay any attention to him.
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.
What about the dinosaurs?
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.
Please tell me that's not our idiot.
OK, I'm gonna jump
on the count of three.
One,
two...
Sid, don't move a muscle.
We're coming up.
Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump!
Sorry.
Two and three onethousandths,
two and four onethousandths...
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.
But I've been wrong before.
Geronimo!
Hey, watch it.
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.
Diego, retract the claws, please.
Right. Sorry.
If I didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.
Guys.
Fast Tony was right.
Everything is melting.
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.
That's genius, Sid.
Call me Squid.
This whole thing's a piece ofjunk.
I can't believe I live here.
What?
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.
It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
I'll show you something that floats.
All right, it's your funeral.
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.
Giants balls of furry lava the size of
mammoths raining from the sky.
Go suck air through a reed.
Listen to him.
He's right about the flood.
I am? I mean, yes, I am.
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.
The entire valley's gonna flood.
Flood's real, all right.
And it's coming fast.
Look around. You're in a bowl.
BowI's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.
What are we gonna do?
Unless you make it
to the end of the valley.
There's a boat. It can save you.
I don't see anything.
But
y'all better hurry.
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.
Survive that
and you'll be racing the water,
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.
Boom!
There is some good news, though.
The more of you die,
the better I eat.
I didn't say it was good news for you.
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.
Dam.
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.
Manny, you really think there's a boat?
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.
If there's any hope, it's that way.
Manny, let's go.
Overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane.
Traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see.
And it looks like
there might be a fatality.
I call the dark meat.
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.
Come on, Grandpa, come on.
We have to go.
Well, I'm not leaving. I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole.
Do we have to bring this crap?
I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
This was a gift from my mother.
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.
Manny,
I just heard you're going extinct.
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.
I'm not going extinct.
Kids, look. The last mammoth.
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.
See?
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?
Stu. Come on, Stu.
Let's blow this icecube stand.
Stu.
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.
Shut up, Sid.
OK.
Stop singing, Sid.
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.
What if you're right?
What if I am the last mammoth?
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.
Mammoths?
I knew I couldn't be the last one.
I felt it in my gut.
Extinct? Come on.
He's up by a couple of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.
Sorry. My stomach hates me.
Well, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?
Nasty.
Manny.
I need to be alone for a while.
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.
One truly is the loneliest number.
These work great.
Cool.
Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
I'll get 'em.
Which end is up?
I'd hide that face too.
Hey, ugly.
I gotta sit on that.
Gotcha.
OK, I'm going in.
Sid.
What?
Nice miss.
Cover your side.
I felt some breeze in that one.
Smile.
Out of my way.
Hello.
Over here.
Surrender?
Never.
Cool.
Smoke them.
If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Big mistake, you miscreants.
Miscreants?
Diego, they're possums.
Retreat.
I guess it's just you and me now.
I knew it.
I knew I wasn't the only one.
Everyone falls out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.
Wait. What?
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.
And you were in the tree because...?
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.
Brothers? You mean there's more?
Sure.
There's lots of us.
Where?
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.
Help! Help!
Help!
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.
What are you looking at me for?
I don't know. Because you're a mammoth.
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.
And my other friend, the platypus.
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.
This guy giving you trouble, sis?
Sis?
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.
Hey, she should come with us.
Are you insane? No way.
OK.
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.
I'd rather be road kill.
That can be arranged.
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?
Why did you invite them?
Cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.
He has a point.
Sorry, when did I join
this dating service?
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.
If you treat us nicely.
See that?
That's the total opposite of nice.
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.
You want a piece of us? Let's go.
Banzai!
I got 'em.
Back! Back!
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now travelling together.
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.
I'll be the daddy,
Ellie will be the mommy.
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.
Now, let's move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet.
I thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly.
I'm not fat. It's this fur,
it makes me look big.
It's poofy.
OK.
He's fat.
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.
How would you like
to lose a ton or two?
Would I ever.
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.
I also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.
We'll never make it at this pace.
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.
OK. Safe? Please.
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.
What you got?
Perimeter all clear.
Roger that. Oneniner, over.
Roger, over, victor...
Guys.
All clear.
Hawk!
What are you doing?
Playing dead.
Manny, why don't you do that?
Because I'm a mammoth.
But you'd do it for treats, right?
Is he gone?
You're safe. Get up.
Man.
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.
That's how cousin Wilton went.
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.
I'm not the last one.
You brave, brave soul.
That's right. Don't give up hope.
Ellie.
Look at our footprints.
They're the same shape.
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?
Well, then,
look at our shadows.
We match.
You're right. They're the same.
You must be part possum.
You wish.
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.
We gotta catch up with the others.
Hey. Knock it off.
Cry me a river, blubbertooth tiger.
Have some fun.
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,
but it's strong enough to hold
a tenton mammoth and a nineton possum.
Mammal overboard!
Ellie, get up.
If you play dead, you'll be dead.
Look at me.
Diego.
Diego.
Come on, Diego. Come on.
This may sting a little.
What in the animal kingdom was that?
I don't know.
From now on,
land safe, water not safe.
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.
It was nothing. I...
It's not a compliment.
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.
Yeah, we're spineless.
Lilylivered.
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.
Maybe you should run away more.
Good point. Thanks for the advice.
Happy to help.
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more".
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrowminded.
You like her.
I do not.
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
And so is yours.
What secret?
You know, the one where you can't swim.
That's ridiculous.
Fine. But we're living
in a melting world.
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.
Almost there.
OK. Ready, Eddie?
Set.
Let's roll.
Wait for me.
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.
So you think she's the girl for me?
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.
She completes you.
Yeah.
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?
No.
Come on.
You expect to impress
with that attitude?
I don't want to impress.
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.
You can't be two things.
Au contraire, Manfered. 
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.
He's never gonna let up on you.
It'll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it.
So what do you want me to do?
Pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond.
I don't know.
If you're too lame to do it,
we can get Ellie.
No, no, no. No, I can do it.
I can do it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.
Have you done this before?
Only a million times.
Farther, farther, farther.
Perfect. Fire!
Yeah! I can fly!
Crash!
Crash! Crash!
Crash, are you OK?
What happened?
Manny shot him out of a tree.
What's wrong with you?
He said he could do it.
And you listened to him?
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.
Can I help in any way here?
You've done enough.
Are you happy now?
Crash, Crash, don't leave me.
Who's gonna watch my back?
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?
Who's gonna roll
in that dung patch with me?
Dung patch?
Wait. My legs. I can stand.
He can stand.
I can run.
He can run. It's a miracle.
Hallelujah!
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.
Not the face.
Ellie, Ellie, me too.
She's not half bad.
Crazy and confused, but sweet.
So?
So what's holding you back?
My family.
You can have that again, you know.
No, Sid, I can't.
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.
I think I'm starting
to get through to him.
Wait, wait. I got you.
Slowpoke.
Need help?
No, no. Just catching my breath.
You're stuck.
I am not.
All right, then, let's go.
I can't.
I'm stuck.
Don't you think that picking them up
like this would be easier?
Ellie?
I know this place.
You know, deep down,
I knew I was different.
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.
OK, a lot bigger.
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,
you know.
What?
Attractive.
Really?
Sure.
What about me is attractive?
I don't know.
Well, there's your
butt.
What about it?
It's
big.
You're just saying that.
No, no, no, I mean it.
It's huge.
Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.
That is really sweet.
What a crazy day.
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.
Sure did.
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.
I wouldn't know.
Sabres don't feel fear.
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.
Rocks have no fear.
And they sink.
What are you getting at, Sid?
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.
No. You?
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.
I wonder why?
Jealousy, mostly.
But the point is that fear is natural.
Fear is for prey.
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.
Justjump in and trust your instincts.
You know, most animals
can swim as babies.
And for a tiger, it's like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey.
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.
I look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.
And I'm breathing.
And I'm stalking
and I'm stalking and I'm...
I'm falling.
Correction. You're sinking.
Kind of like a rock.
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?
Or do we just throw our weight around?
Whoops. Sorry.
I don't know my own strength yet.
Ellie, do you realise that now
we have a chance to save our species?
Really? How are we gonna do that?
Well, you know...
Did you just...?
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?
I wasn't saying...
Not right now. In time.
I was just saying that
it's our responsibility.
What?
All right, that came out wrong. I...
You're very pretty, but we just met...
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.
So, how did it go?
Not bad.
OK, let's go.
We travelled with you all day,
now you're coming with us at night.
But we can't see at night.
Then enjoy the flood.
I can't even look at him.
Pervert.
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.
Watch out, there's a stump.
Not anymore.
I thought we could walk together.
Crash,
ask the mammoth why he thinks that.
She said she thinks you're ajerk
and to go away.
She didn't say...
Look, maybe if we spend more time...
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.
She said go jump in a lake.
And possums rule.
I can hear her, you know.
What do you want? A medal?
Stop moving.
Thank you.
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.
Now!
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.
Funny. Now what's your real plan?
Just do it.
Bye, Eddie.
Bye, Crash.
Bye, Ellie.
Go now.
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you.
What do you mean "if" it offended me?
That it offended her!
I mean that, that it offended you.
You just overreacted, that's all.
What?
Take it back.
There are other lives at stake here.
He's got a point.
He's got nothing.
It was a misunderstanding.
It was insensitive.
Apologise.
Why me? She overreacted.
Just apologise.
No.
Do it.
OK, I'm sorry.
What?
He's right. I overreacted.
You mean...
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!
I guess we finally
did something right together.
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.
Remember the good old days?
Which good old days?
You know. Yesterday, last week.
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.
Yep. Those were the good days.
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.
We should get some sleep.
Yeah.
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.
Wait a minute.
Can I help you?
Now, that's what I call respect.
Nice.
Somebody here likes Sid.
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.
Fire King.
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognised my true potential.
Let there be fire.
If only the guys could see me now.
This is either really good
or really bad.
No, no, no.
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King?
A thousand years' bad juju
for killing Fire King.
Superheated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,
melting ice built up
over thousands of years.
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.
We have one sacrifice the Fire King.
Well, that's not very advanced.
Worth a shot.
No! No!
Bad juju!
Water? Water!
Crash, I told you not to drink
before bed.
I didn't do this.
At least, not all of it.
What's happening?
We overslept. We need to move.
What if we're the last creatures
left alive?
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.
How? Everyone's either
a dude or our sister.
Hi. Hey, Manny.
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.
You were sleepwalking.
No, no, no. I was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths.
That was gonna be my second guess.
And they worshiped me.
I mean, sure, they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.
You were dreaming. Come on, the water's
rising faster than we're moving.
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
I was worshiped. Guys.
Fine.
Can we slow down a little?
I'm dying here.
It was just a figure of speech.
They just sit there, watching us.
I wish I knew what they were thinking.
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.
Sid!
What? It's catchy.
We made it.
Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?
I just did something
involuntary and messy.
OK, come on.
Manny. Get back.
It's a minefield out there.
There's only one way to go.
Straight through.
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.
We'll head back and go around.
There's no time.
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.
If we go through this,
we get blown to bits.
We go forward.
We go back.
Forward.
Back.
Can I say something?
No.
You are so stubborn and hardheaded.
Well, I guess that proves it.
I am a mammoth.
Come on.
Fine.
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.
Manny.
Kids, look, the last mammoth.
I just heard you're going extinct.
You can't be two things.
She thinks you're ajerk.
Where's your big, happy family?
What's wrong with you?
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!
That way.
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.
Have you seen a mammoth?
No, sorry.
Have you seen a mammoth?
No.
Possum? About 11 foot tall?
Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
I sure have. Big as life.
Where?
I'm looking at him.
Not me.
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.
I don't see her anywhere.
Maybe she's already on board.
Hurry, this way. Come on.
There it is.
Ellie! Help!
Come on, come on, run!
Push.
You guys gotta go.
We're not leaving you.
I'm not asking.
Ellie, no.
Ellie, don't worry.
We're going for help.
Stay here.
Help us.
Help! Somebody help.
Manny.
Manny.
Manny.
It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.
Ellie.
Manny.
Help!
I'll save you.
Great. Who's gonna save him?
You really need to brush.
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.
I am not your prey. I am not your prey.
I am not your prey.
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it.
Come on.
Claw, kick, claw, kick.
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.
Eddie.
You did it, buddy.
You kicked water's butt.
Nothing to it. Most animals
can swim as babies, you know.
Yeah, but not tigers.
I left that part out.
There he is.
Ellie, hold on to me.
Manny, Manny, behind you.
There they are.
They made it.
We thought we'd never see you again.
We're gonna live.
We're gonna die.
Well, I'm not leaving.
Grandpa, let go of the boat.
The flood's over.
This is my boat now.
Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.
Well, I am anyway.
I'm thinking about starting
a swim school.
Sid's Squids.
All hail Fire King.
Hi.
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.
You mean it?
Sid. Sid.
That doesn't mean "want to touch".
Don't ask.
We're not the last ones anymore.
You're not coming?
You wanna go with them?
I am a mammoth.
I should probably be with a mammoth.
Don't you think?
Yeah, unless...
Unless?
Unless I...
I just wanna say...
I need to tell you...
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.
You too.
Manny, you've come a long way since we
met and I'll take full credit for that,
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.
Go after her.
It's OK.
We'll always be here for you.
I'll keep in touch.
Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.
Our Manny's growing up.
Ellie! Ellie!
Manny.
Ellie, I don't want us
to be together because we have to.
I want us to be together
because we want to.
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.
What do you say?
Manny, I thought you were going...
You're possum enough for me.
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.
I still have my pride, you know.
Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.
I'll carry him.
But your herd's leaving.
We are now.
Shotgun!
Manny, who do you like better?
Me or Diego?
Diego. It's not even close.
Told you.
Manny, you can't choose
between your kids.
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.
If I had a dog and my dog had a kid...
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that would be Sid.
Can I have a dog, Manny?
No.
Ellie, can I have a dog?
Of course you can, sweetie.
Ellie,
we have to be consistent with him.
I saved you, little buddy.
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?
