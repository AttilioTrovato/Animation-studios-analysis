1
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,354
The ancient seas,

2
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:23,393
home to so many
wondrous creatures.

3
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:27,897
Creatures both small,

4
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:34,304
and very, very large.

5
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:44,856
Millions and millions
of years ago,

6
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,727
these creatures swam
in the warm oceans

7
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,553
that covered most of our planet.

8
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:57,803
The oceans were strange,

9
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,295
mysterious,

10
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,745
and very dangerous.

11
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:10,749
And the world above
was dangerous, too.

12
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:13,776
Creatures were at risk, not only from
the predators who would eat them,

13
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:21,360
but also from the ever-changing
weather patterns

14
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:24,487
and natural disasters
that plagued their world.

15
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:58,630
But even during this time of heavy
rains and harsh natural disasters,

16
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:03,225
there was a place that dinosaurs
could live in peace and harmony,

17
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,462
the Great Valley.

18
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:17,540
But the Great Valley was also
having some very bad weather.

19
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:30,829
When is all this
skywater gonna stop, Grandpa?

20
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,898
I don't know, Littlefoot.

21
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:37,303
Grandma and I have never
seen so much of it before.

22
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:40,463
Me neither, especially all
over the ground like this.

23
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,002
Gee, what if it never stops?

24
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,509
Oh, it will, little one.
It always does.

25
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,413
Though I'm beginning
to have my doubts.

26
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,317
Oh, look.

27
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:06,389
Wow! The sky colors!

28
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,668
Yes!

29
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,970
May I go play
with my friends now?

30
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:12,995
Please?

31
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,899
Of course, Littlefoot.

32
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,779
Yay!
Just don't go too far,

33
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:24,650
until we know what all this
skywater has done to the valley.

34
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,918
I won't.
See you later.

35
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,778
Ya-hoo!

36
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:52,411
Hey, Cera! Want to race me
over to Ducky's and Spike's?

37
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,912
I can't, Littlefoot.

38
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,682
I've gotta help my
father move this tree.

39
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:59,084
It fell right on top
of our sleeping place.

40
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,144
Cera. Sorry, Littlefoot.

41
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,460
I could help.

42
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:10,596
Well, thanks for the
offer, Littlefoot,

43
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,098
but my daughter and I
are fully capable

44
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:15,858
of doing the job ourselves.

45
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:22,107
Okay, Cera.
Then I'll see you later?

46
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:23,799
Uh-huh.

47
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,969
Okay, well, bye.

48
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:41,460
I'll just have to race myself
over to Ducky and Spike's.

49
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:43,819
Ready, set, go!

50
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,576
Hey, Ducky, Spike,
where are you guys going?

51
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,134
Hi, Littlefoot.

52
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,054
Mama says we have to move
because the skywater

53
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,880
has made our nesting
place too squishy.

54
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:14,493
See?

55
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:16,686
Me and Spike really like it.

56
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,980
Well, maybe when you're done moving,
we can all do something together.

57
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:37,783
Oh, yes, like play
in all this squishy mud.

58
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:40,042
Squishy, squishy, squishy.

59
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,822
Then I'll see you later?

60
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:45,524
Uh-huh.

61
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:48,159
Squishy, squishy, squishy.

62
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,218
Squishy.

63
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:55,190
Squishy, squishy.

64
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,538
Squishy, squishy.

65
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:04,075
Ducky, Spike, stop squishing
in that mud and come along.

66
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:07,069
We have a nest to build.
Uh, um, coming, Mama.

67
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:12,141
Squishy, squishy, squishy.

68
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:19,591
Hello? Petrie?
You up there?

69
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:21,292
Me up here, Littlefoot.

70
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,595
But me no can play today.

71
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:26,522
Me got sniffles
from having wet feet.

72
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:35,140
Oh, me got to learn
how to fall softer.

73
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,809
Gee, do you think you'll
be feeling better soon?

74
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,036
Oh, yes. Me feel
much better by tomorrow.

75
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:44,006
Oh.

76
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,879

Oh, I'm bored.

115
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:03,405
Here, Littlefoot.

116
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,456
Have a treestar.

117
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,360
All that skywater has made
it deliciously moist.

118
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,164
Thanks, Grandpa, but I don't want a
treestar. I want to have some fun.

119
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:23,835
But, Littlefoot, you have a whole
valley out there to entertain you.

120
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:28,106
Yeah, but what's the good of that if I
don't have anybody to share it with.

121
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,265
There's no one
who wants to have fun.

122
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,880
I wish my mom had
given me a brother.

123
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,006
Then I'd always have
someone to have fun with.

124
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,319
Now, little one,

125
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:44,923
your mother would have loved to have
given you a brother, Littlefoot.

126
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:47,993
Yes, but because
you were her only child,

127
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:51,062
you were very, very
special to her.

128
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,231
What's so special
about being all alone?

129
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,034
Ah, but that's just it,
Littlefoot.

130
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:58,469
None of us are ever
really alone.

131
00:11:58,493 --> 00:12:01,439
But I feel alone.

132
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,408
Yes, Littlefoot, I understand.

133
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:08,579
But look around you. Our Great
Valley is so full of life.

134
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,582
It really is a special place.

135
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,009
Filled with so many
special creatures.

136
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,846
We've got fliers,

137
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,215
and swimmers.

138
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:26,355
And landwalkers of all kinds.

139
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:33,604
Oh, we even have these
annoying buzzing creatures.

140
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,165
Wondrous, isn't it?

141
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,211
And just think, Littlefoot.

142
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:44,315
There might be other kinds of creatures
out there just waiting to be discovered.

143
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,416
Really?

144
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,119
That's right.
So, you see, Littlefoot,

145
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,621
in a world so full of life,

146
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,459
you're only as alone
as you choose to be.

147
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,485
Do you understand, little one?

148
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,998
Well, no.

149
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:03,568
Don't worry.
You will someday.

150
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:06,295
Yeah, but what do I do
for fun until then?

151
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:13,869
It's not fair.

152
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:20,575
There's nobody
to have any fun with.

153
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, hey!
Hello, Littlefoot.

154
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,068
What would you like to do today?

155
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,504
I don't know, Littlefoot.
What do you want to do?

156
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,606
Hey, no fair.
I asked you first.

157
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,333
Okay.
Let's go have some fun.

158
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,305
Yeah!

159
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,951
Gee, the skywater has really
changed the land around here.

160
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,668
Think it's
safe to go on, Littlefoot?

161
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,537
Sure it is.

162
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:16,165
Maybe we'll find some new kind
of creature, like Grandpa said.

163
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,412
Okay, but we have to be careful.

164
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:23,338
Aw, don't be
such a scaredy-egg.

165
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,540
Whoa!

166
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,410
Look at that!

167
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:36,094
There's so much water.

168
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:39,164
I think we've gone
too far from home now, Littlefoot.

169
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:40,922
Yeah, you may be right.

170
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,401
Over here, Grandpa.
It's this way.

171
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:01,252
Oh, my!

172
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,688
We were all afraid
this might happen.

173
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:06,381
What do you mean, "all"?
I wasn't afraid.

174
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,084
Look.

175
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:15,000
The skywater has
caused flooding in our valley.

176
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:17,202
Yes, and all the
new water must have come

177
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,170
from over those mountains.

178
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:21,739
From the Mysterious Beyond.

179
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:24,309
Oh, dear!

180
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:28,437
Oh. Well, then, who knows what terrible
creatures it may have carried with it.

181
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:36,587
Which means I don't want
Cera anywhere near it.

182
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:40,158
Little one, you
must stay closer to home

183
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:43,185
until we know more about what the
skywater has done to our valley.

184
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,287
Okay, Grandma.

185
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:51,460
Come, everyone. I sense more
skywater is about to fall.

186
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,264
Gee, I don't sense anything.

187
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,733
Aah! Wait for me!

188
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:36,071
Huh? What was that?

189
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,710
Probably nothing.

190
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,794
There it is again. I've never
heard anything like it before.

191
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:51,353
I better check it out.

192
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:10,748
Off a bit early
this morning, Littlefoot.

193
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:15,886
Well, I can't sleep,
and I, uh...

194
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,688
Really, really
want to go out and play.

195
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,425
All right.
Uh, just be careful.

196
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:21,450
I will.

197
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:35,173
Sounds like it's coming
from out there somewhere.

198
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:38,567
Maybe it's something new, just waiting
to be discovered, like Grandpa said.

199
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,312
Huh?

200
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:55,116
It's a swimmer.

201
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,191
Wow! I've never seen one
like him before.

202
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:12,477
Hello? Hello? Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

203
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,736
Hello out there.

204
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:42,507
Hey!
Huh?

205
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:45,400
Ooh. Aah.

206
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:46,935
Wow!

207
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:55,920
No, don't go! Please.

208
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,422
Hey!

209
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,448
Okay, very funny.

210
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:03,718
That really looks like fun.

211
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:09,634
I wish I could do that.

212
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,602
Who are you?

213
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:14,405
I'm Littlefoot.
"Yittlefoot"?

214
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:17,975
No, Li-Li-Littlefoot.

215
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,711
"Yi-Yi-Yittlefo-o-o-t"?

216
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,913
Well, that's pretty close.

217
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,639
What's your name?
Mo.

218
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,343
Nice to meet you, Mo.

219
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:33,458
Mo no got
landfoot like Littlefoot.

220
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:36,285
Mo got wa-a-a-terfoot!

221
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:38,820
See?

222
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,833
Yeah, I see.

223
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:45,336
Do you like
to have fu-u-u-u-n?

224
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,671
I sure do!

225
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:48,706
Hee-hee!
Hey!

226
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,332
I'll get you.

227
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,779
Littlefoot.
Littlefoot!

228
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:58,916
Littlefoot. Come out, come
out, wherever you be.

229
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,643
Maybe Littlefoot is hiding
from us because he is mad.

230
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,516
Why would he be mad?
We didn't do anything.

231
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,497
Well, we not play with him.

232
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,699
It wasn't our fault
we couldn't play.

233
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:16,425
Now, where is he?

234
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,539
Hey, maybe Littlefoot swim off.

235
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:25,443
There plenty of water.

236
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:29,013
Petrie, Littlefoot is not a swimmer.

237
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:31,482
And you are not
a swimmer either.

238
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:33,484
No, no, no.

239
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:36,987
If me see any
more water, me gonna...

240
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,947
Gonna... Ah-choo!

241
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,517
Be more wet.

242
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,468
What's so funny?

243
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:52,494
That is Littlefoot's laugh.

244
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,072
It sure is.

245
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:59,401
And it sounds like he's having a
bunch of fun without us. Come on!

246
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,905
Okay. Me walk, too.

247
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:12,056
Wow! Look at that.

248
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,648
Hmm?

249
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,696
It is just like
the grown-ups said.

250
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,489
It is big, new water.

251
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:27,405
Come on.
Let's go find Littlefoot.

252
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:30,708
But, Cera, my mama said
not to go near the new water.

253
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:35,613
She said, "Do not go there.
It could be dangerous."

254
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:37,882
Yeah, my dad said that, too.

255
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:40,985
But, like that's
stopped us before?

256
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,755
Besides, Littlefoot's laughing.
So how bad can it be?

257
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,716
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

258
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:53,864
Just because they go,
no mean me have to.

259
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:55,457
Me think for myself.

260
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,660
Petrie?
Coming.

261
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:07,478
Littlefoot?
Is that you?

262
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:11,181
Oh, hi, guys. Guess what. Mo and
I just became mud brothers.

263
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,984
Mo?
Who Mo?

264
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,510
Yeah. Mo who?

265
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:18,823
He's my best friend.

266
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:21,692
Best? What do you mean, "best"?

267
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,995
Yeah. I thought we
were your best friends.

268
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,390
Well, I just mean that he's my
newest best friend because he

269
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:32,069
lives in the new water.

270
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:34,138
Do you guys want to meet him?
A new friend?

271
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:36,941
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes, yes.

272
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:40,502
But, Ducky, remember what the
grown-ups said about the new water?

273
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:44,982
Oh, yes, that is right.

274
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:48,853
Since Mo is from the new water, we
have to be very careful because

275
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:50,545
he might be dangerous.

276
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:56,827
Right, Spike?

277
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,520
Spike?

278
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:02,500
Spike does not seem worried.

279
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,426
Then, come on. Wait till you meet him.
He's so much fun.

280
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,739
Newest best friend.

281
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,700
So much fun, hmph! I probably
won't even like him.

282
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:17,506
So, where is he?
I... I don't know.

283
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:20,909
Mo!

284
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:25,580
Sounds to me like you
just made him up.

285
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,026
No, I didn't.

286
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,685
Sure, you didn't.

287
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:35,733
Well, I didn't!

288
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:38,936
I wouldn't talk to
an imaginary friend.

It's fun.

Oh, looky.

331
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,864
Come on, everybody.
It's Mo.

332
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,780
Mo, these are all my friends.

333
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:39,750
This is Ducky. Hi, Mo.
I am a swimmer, too.

334
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:43,153
A swimmer and landwalker?

335
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:44,378
You special!

336
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:48,058
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I am.

337
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:50,151
I guess.

338
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:53,197
And this is Spike.

339
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:56,901
Spike is very special, too.

340
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,360
Especially good at eating.

341
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:09,146
This is Petrie.

342
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,538
Me a flier. See?

343
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:15,977
Ta-da!

344
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:19,247
And this is Cera.

345
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:23,084
You're not from
around here, are you?

346
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:26,964
Then just where are you from?

347
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:29,190
Mo from Big Water.

348
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:32,002
Big Water?

349
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:37,107
But how you get here when
Big Water way over there?

350
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:40,201
Ooh. Skyplace make
lots and lots of skywater.

351
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,851
Make big waves in Big Water.
Mo scared.

352
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:50,520
So Mo swim into small water
path, then p-u-u-u-h-wish!

353
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,748
Mo do like th-i-i-i-i-s!

354
00:27:57,318 --> 00:27:59,287
Then, f-a-a-a-a-a-ll!

355
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:07,237
All the skywater must have washed him
over from the Mysterious Beyond.

356
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:08,963
Oh. Poor, poor Mo.

357
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:13,377
Did you get washeded over
all by yourself?

358
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,412
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm,
mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

359
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:19,007
And you're sure that
no one else came with you?

360
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,242
Mo all alone.

361
00:28:36,324 --> 00:28:39,937
But now, Mo have new friends!

362
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:41,295
Have fun.

363
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:09,357
Mo sound funny.

364
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:16,397
Run for it!

365
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:40,197
That was a very
big sharptooth swimmer.

366
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:42,891
And it not imaginary!

367
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:46,636
I knew
the grown-ups were right.

368
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,306
We should have never
gone near the new water.

369
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,008
Come on.
We're going home.

370
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:53,410
But, Cera, we can't
just leave Mo.

371
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,003
He's my mud brother.

372
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,920
Some brother! He thinks
this whole thing was funny.

373
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:05,155
No! Mo's just happy
to see us.

374
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,957
He tried to warn us.

375
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:09,994
We don't know that for sure. We
don't know anything about him

376
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:13,197
other than he's so much fun.

377
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:16,333
But we can't just leave him in
the new water with that monster.

378
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:19,503
We've gotta help him.
But how, Littlefoot?

379
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:24,274
We are very little, and that swimming
sharptooth is very, very big.

380
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:26,243
Mmm-hmm.
Well, we could...

381
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:28,012
We could figure something out.

382
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,914
Yeah? Like what?

383
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:34,151
Like, we could...
Help him get home.

384
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:35,953
Yeah. We could help Mo get
back to the Big Water.

385
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,421
What?

386
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:39,223
Why not?
We've been there before.

387
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:42,492
But, Littlefoot, Mo cannot
walk with us to the Big Water.

388
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:44,995
He is a swimmer and has no feet.

389
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:49,399
Besides, we only know how to get there when
we turn right at the smoking mountains.

390
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:52,469
And we are nowhere near them.

391
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:55,296
Well, if you won't help me,
I'm sure the grown-ups will.

392
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,475
You can't be serious.

393
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,945
We're not going to
the Mysterious Beyond

394
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:03,180
to help some strange creature.

395
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:04,305
That's absurd!

396
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:07,684
Now, now, Mr. Threehorn.

397
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,187
There's no need to be so gruff.

398
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:13,657
Littlefoot was just asking. And there's
no harm in that.

399
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:16,293
Well, that's true.

400
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:17,285
I'm sorry, Littlefoot, but...

401
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,521
Littlefoot? Kids?

402
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:28,438
I don't care what anybody says.

403
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:30,474
Mo's my mud brother
and I'm going to help him.

404
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:33,643
But, Littlefoot!

405
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:38,148
Ooh, I think my tummy is making
its hungry sound.

406
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:41,409
No, I do not
think that is my tummy.

407
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:46,080
Earthshake!

408
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:53,321
Aah! This way!

409
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,261
Over here!

410
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,539
Look out!

411
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:37,407
I guess we won't be going
back this way anymore.

412
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:39,200
But how will we get home?

413
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:43,313
Me fly across
and get grown-ups.

414
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,638
They find way.

415
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:53,790
Hot!

416
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:55,483
Never mind.

417
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:02,123
Do not worry, Spike.
We will find a way home.

418
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:19,783
Oh, dear!

419
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:23,153
This isn't like him at all.

420
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:27,424
This way. Their tracks lead right
in the direction of the new water.

421
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:30,560
Which you know can mean
only one thing.

422
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:34,764
Littlefoot has led our children
into trouble once again.

423
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:39,303
Now, now, Mr. Threehorn. We don't
know anything yet for sure.

424
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:42,106
If our kids did go back
to the new water,

425
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,643
I'm sure they're trying to find
a way home this very minute.

426
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:50,580
Until then, we must find a
way around this land break.

427
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:52,606
We'll keep looking
until we find them.

428
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:03,260
Mo! Mo, are you
out there?

429
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:06,563
Me here, Littlefoot.

430
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,832
Oh, I was hoping you'd be okay.

431
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:10,700
That earthshake was really bad.

432
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:13,570
No, earthshake good.

433
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,639
It trap bad swimmer.

434
00:34:15,663 --> 00:34:17,598
He no leave ever never.

435
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:28,418
Wait a minute. If he's trapped in
that cave, then he can't get us.

436
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,788
And if he can't get us, it'd be
safe for us to help you get home.

437
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:34,791
Home? Yeah, back
to the Big Water.

438
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:36,560
You do want to go there,
don't you?

439
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:38,762
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

440
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,454
Then stay right there.

441
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,324
Ho-o-o-me.

442
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,172
And, since we can't
get home the old way,

443
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:51,432
maybe we can find a new way
home by going that way.

444
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,882
And, while we're at it, we could
take Mo to the Big Water.

445
00:34:58,906 --> 00:35:01,651
What do you say?
Well, I say yes.

446
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:04,488
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

447
00:35:04,512 --> 00:35:07,424
And what about you, Spike?
Uh-huh.

448
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:10,927
Count me in, too.
What you say, Cera?

449
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,463
Well...
Great.

450
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:16,733
Petrie, you fly 'round and see if there's
any water paths that lead to the Big Water.

451
00:35:16,757 --> 00:35:17,858
Okay.

452
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:24,341
You'll see, Cera. Mo will
make this trip so much fun.

453
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:25,566
Yeah, right.

454
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:39,847
Me find water paths to Big
Water and be big hero.

455
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:53,327
Whew. That's some big wind.

456
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,947
Got to pull up.

457
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:05,406
Pull up!

458
00:36:10,678 --> 00:36:15,359
Oh! Me sure glad that over.

459
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,918
Now me can get back
to being hero.

460
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:29,673
Oh, too bad Cera, Littlefoot,
Ducky and Spike not fly.

461
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:33,277
Wait, imaginary friend can fly.

462
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:34,902
There.

463
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,375
Now, he got wings.

464
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:52,629
♪ Imaginary

465
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:55,889
Me like to sing. How about
you, imaginary friend?

466
00:36:56,724 --> 00:36:57,891
Good.

467
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,074
♪ Imaginary

468
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,535
Louder, friend.
Me can't hear you.

469
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:13,049
Whoa! There Big Water.

470
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:14,642
Now me go back and tell others.

471
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:28,865
Great job, Petrie. You found
the way all by yourself.

472
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:32,636
Not by myself, Littlefoot.
Imaginary friend help.

473
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,027
Oh, brother.

474
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:03,433
Mo this and Mo that. Hmph!

475
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:04,901
Hey!

476
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:07,371
Fun!

477
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:11,675
Littlefoot, would you please
tell your mud brother

478
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,544
that this is no time
to be having fun?

479
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:18,038
Getting him and us home
is very serious. Hmph!

480
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:26,089
Um, Mo, maybe you should stop
playing around for now, okay?

481
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:28,916
I think you're kinda
getting on Cera's nerves.

482
00:38:31,151 --> 00:38:32,753
Nerves?

483
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,472
Huh?

484
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:54,775
Surprise!

485
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:06,420
Now Mo bubble-face, too.

486
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,427
Hmph!

487
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:16,564
What?
What?

488
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:38,094
And just how do you expect
Mo to swim over this, Petrie?

489
00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:40,063
Sorry, but big boulder

490
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:43,533
look like little,
tiny boulder from up there.

491
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:46,827
Do not worry. Maybe Mo can
swim under the boulder.

492
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:49,129
I will go see.

493
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:16,857
It is Mo. He is stuckted,
and I cannot pull him out.

494
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:23,673
No, guys.
You are not swimmers.

495
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:25,533
You cannot go down there.

496
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,571
Surprise! Huh?

497
00:40:39,747 --> 00:40:41,090
Did anybody see him?

498
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:45,228
Sorry, me too
busy swallowing water.

499
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:47,997
Hello, friends!

500
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:50,166
Mo, you're not stuck!
You're all right!

501
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,036
Ooh, Mo not really stuck.

502
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,228
Mo just having...

503
00:40:57,898 --> 00:40:58,766
Fun.

504
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:07,951
Face it, Littlefoot.

505
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:12,221
Mo doesn't really want help.
He just wants to have fun.

506
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:16,059
Wait a minute, Cera.
That's it!

507
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:19,629
What's it? Mo thinks
jumping is fun, right?

508
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:22,932
Right.
Right!

509
00:41:22,956 --> 00:41:25,602
So, he can jump right
over the big rock.

510
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:29,663
But, if Mo not make it, he
get all squished.

511
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:35,945
But, Petrie, maybe he would
not get squishted too badly.

512
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,982
Hmm, maybe.

513
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:42,085
It sound fun!

514
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:43,243
Mo try it.

515
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:48,548
I'll wait for him on
top, just in case he needs help.

516
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:01,194
Uh-oh. Here comes
the squish part.

517
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:09,169
I got him!
Wheee-hee-hee-hee.

518
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:11,238

Maybe we could stop and go for a swim.
Uh-huh.

645
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:23,543
Whee!

646
00:53:25,378 --> 00:53:27,246
The water feels
so nice and cool.

647
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,357
Ew. But it tastes yucky.

648
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:48,076
Huh? That must be because we're
getting close to Big Water.

649
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,337
Come on. Let's celebrate
by cooling off.

650
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:52,772
Yay!

651
00:53:56,643 --> 00:53:57,877
Huh?

652
00:54:08,355 --> 00:54:10,790
Hey, let's show Mo
how much fun we are.

653
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:17,397
Uh-oh.

654
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,901
Get him. Yeah!

655
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,379
Come on.

656
00:54:35,582 --> 00:54:37,860
Get in!

657
00:54:37,884 --> 00:54:39,519
Ow! I just stepped
on something.

658
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:44,424
What is that weird
looking thing?

659
00:54:52,465 --> 00:54:54,377
Cera, what is that on your nose?

660
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:56,503
I don't know! Just get it off!
Get it off!

661
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:04,711
It's stuck.

662
00:55:10,883 --> 00:55:13,520
Let go! Let go! Let go!
Let go! Let go! Let go!

663
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:24,640
Wow. Good going, Mo.

664
00:55:24,664 --> 00:55:27,576
Yeah. Me wanna learn
to squeak like that.

665
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,811
It'd sure come in handy.

666
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:30,403
What did you say to it, Mo?

667
00:55:33,906 --> 00:55:36,543
Right. Which means?
Let go.

668
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:40,146
Oh, well, yeah, I knew that.

669
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:55,895
Mo swim ahead. Go see which water
path take us to Big Water.

670
00:55:57,497 --> 00:55:58,765
Be back soon.

671
00:56:39,506 --> 00:56:42,651
Oh, great.
More skywater.

672
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:45,211
Well, nothing could possibly
make my day any worse.

673
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:49,516
Except for that!

674
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:11,504
Hurry! We've gotta get as far
away from the water as we can.

675
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:59,194
It's sure quiet out there.
Maybe he go home.

676
00:57:59,218 --> 00:58:01,296
I'll go check.

677
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,100
No, Littlefoot. For all we know
that thing could be waiting for us.

678
00:58:05,124 --> 00:58:07,894
No, we just have to stay here and not...

679
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:33,620
Let's get outta here!
It's too late!

680
00:59:12,158 --> 00:59:14,794
Good-bye, friends.

681
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:34,681
Mo! No!

682
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,250
Mo.

683
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:10,983
Hmm? Littlefoot?

684
01:00:18,457 --> 01:00:20,259
Littlefoot, are you okay?

685
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:27,199
Everything's been my fault.

686
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,446
All I wanted was someone
to have fun with.

687
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,950
I never should have gone
near the new water.

688
01:00:34,974 --> 01:00:38,821
I never should have made
you guys be friends with Mo.

689
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,724
You not make me
be friends with Mo.

690
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:43,315
And you did not make me.

691
01:00:49,956 --> 01:00:51,099
Thanks.

692
01:00:51,123 --> 01:00:53,325
Sometimes bad stuff
just happens.

693
01:00:56,495 --> 01:00:59,908
But there was something
good that happened.

694
01:00:59,932 --> 01:01:03,378
Really? Uh-huh. We all
got a new brother.

695
01:01:03,402 --> 01:01:06,815
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Even me.

696
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:10,452
But, Cera, I thought
you didn't like Mo.

697
01:01:10,476 --> 01:01:13,288
Well, I did like him, kind of.

698
01:01:13,312 --> 01:01:14,380
Hmm?

699
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:19,962
Okay, I didn't like him.

700
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:22,454
But it was just because you
thought he was so... So...

701
01:01:23,923 --> 01:01:26,168
So what, Cera?

702
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:31,306
So fun.
I mean, I'm fun, too.

703
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:35,043
I know that, Cera.
You're lots of fun.

704
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:37,813
I am?

705
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:43,518
Ah. Then what was I all jealous for?
Beats me.

706
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:47,189
And, Cera, you 'specially should not
have been jealous of Mo's singing.

707
01:01:47,213 --> 01:01:50,959
It was not good.
Oh, no, no, no.

708
01:01:50,983 --> 01:01:54,286
Yeah. Me sing
much better than him.

709
01:02:09,401 --> 01:02:12,881
Hey, I'd know
that squeak anywhere!

710
01:02:12,905 --> 01:02:15,474
Come on, guys!
Mo!

711
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:38,831
Something's caught in there.

712
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:41,968
It's Mo, and he's all right!

713
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:47,916
Mo!

714
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,085
Hi, friends.

715
01:02:50,109 --> 01:02:53,980
How you get away? Oh, make
bad swimmer chase me.

716
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:08,136
And Mo do like that. Then hide
in land plant like see you do.

717
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,105
He means that hollow tree.

718
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:13,108
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hollow tree.

719
01:03:13,132 --> 01:03:18,513
Bad swimmer no see Mo.
Get mad.

720
01:03:18,537 --> 01:03:22,875
Then bad swimmer
stop and smell air, like this.

721
01:03:24,977 --> 01:03:28,614
Bad swimmer forget all about Mo...
And swim that away.

722
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:35,187
I wonder...
It smells like...

723
01:03:37,156 --> 01:03:39,234
Big Water!

724
01:03:39,258 --> 01:03:41,503
The sharptooth swimmer
must have gone home.

725
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:43,996
Yes!

726
01:03:51,303 --> 01:03:52,504
There it is.

727
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,014
It's Big Water!

728
01:04:03,149 --> 01:04:06,218
Hurry, everybody!
It's big Big Water!

729
01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:21,944
Well, you're home now, Mo.

730
01:04:21,968 --> 01:04:25,113
So, I guess it's time
to say good-bye.

731
01:04:25,137 --> 01:04:28,050
No! Mo no say good-bye.

732
01:04:28,074 --> 01:04:31,153
Friends stay with Mo.

733
01:04:31,177 --> 01:04:33,421
But we cannot stay here
with you, Mo.

734
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:37,083
Big Water tastes yucky,
to us, I mean.

735
01:04:38,985 --> 01:04:42,564
And even Spike cannot eat
the green food here.

736
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:45,700
Ducky's right, Mo. This isn't a
place where our kind can live.

737
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:48,136
Then Mo go with friends.

738
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,407
You know you can't do that, Mo.
You belong here.

739
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:55,334
Besides, you and me
will always be brothers.

740
01:04:59,571 --> 01:05:01,516
No.

741
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,043
Mud brothers.

742
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,652
Littlefoot, that Mo's water kin.

743
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:42,557
Mo home now,
but how friends get home?

744
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:45,793
We're gonna have to find a way
to the smoking mountains.

745
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,619
Yeah, we know the way
home from there.

746
01:05:50,756 --> 01:05:53,568
Wait, wait.
Mo ask water kin.

747
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:57,363
Old ones smart. They will know
way home for landwalkers.

748
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,484
What he doing now?

749
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:11,643
You know Mo.
It's always something.

750
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,601
Me get it.
Mo sending water signals.

751
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:30,129
Look. Now
we get water signal back.

752
01:06:33,165 --> 01:06:35,434
Old ones right. Other water
kin tell Mo the way.

753
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:38,537
Friends can go home now.

754
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:48,080
Home!

755
01:06:50,249 --> 01:06:52,351
Wow. I think they like me.

756
01:06:53,852 --> 01:06:57,765
Littlefoot! Littlefoot!
Before you go home,

757
01:06:57,789 --> 01:06:59,801
you want see where Mo lives?

758
01:06:59,825 --> 01:07:01,427
Do I ever!

759
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,555
Whoa!

760
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:55,281
Littlefoot!
Hello! Littlefoot!

761
01:08:28,247 --> 01:08:29,548
There they are.

762
01:08:32,418 --> 01:08:33,852
Littlefoot, are you all right?

763
01:08:35,354 --> 01:08:37,265
Don't worry.
I'm fine.

764
01:08:37,289 --> 01:08:41,236
It was amazing, guys. I've never
seen anything so beautiful.

765
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,395
Your world beautiful too,
Littlefoot.

766
01:08:44,363 --> 01:08:47,442
And fun!

767
01:08:47,466 --> 01:08:49,568
I know. Thanks, Mo.

768
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:54,606
Good-bye, Mo.

769
01:08:55,774 --> 01:08:57,443
Good-bye, friends.

770
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,889
Good-bye.

771
01:09:01,913 --> 01:09:03,315
Good-bye, Mo.
See ya later, Mo.

772
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:14,402
And so following the way
given to them by Mo's water kin,

773
01:09:14,426 --> 01:09:16,904
Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky,

774
01:09:16,928 --> 01:09:20,266
Petrie and Spike began
the long journey home.

775
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:13,819
We know way from here!
We sure do.

776
01:10:21,993 --> 01:10:23,462
Hurry, Spike.

777
01:10:25,497 --> 01:10:27,866
Yeah, 'cause last one home
is a rotten egg.

778
01:10:32,904 --> 01:10:35,907
And when at last Littlefoot
and his friends did reach home,

779
01:10:38,544 --> 01:10:41,389
each was greeted
with great relief.

780
01:10:41,413 --> 01:10:43,549
Grandma! Grandpa!
Oh, Littlefoot!

781
01:10:46,352 --> 01:10:47,919
Ah.
Daddy.

782
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:51,699
Joy...

783
01:10:51,723 --> 01:10:54,360
Mama!
And love by their families.

784
01:10:55,561 --> 01:10:57,972
This adventure was at an end.

785
01:10:57,996 --> 01:11:01,576
Still, Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky,

786
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,679
Petrie and Spike
knew in their hearts
