My ship got scrapped

The only other survivors

21

Outside of that, we got nothing.

Tell me, Mr. Johns,

23
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,295
what brings you to this
lonely corner of space?

There's some residual as well.
Could be a juvenile.

More likely burn-off
from the engines.

It's the sweep.
According to what I'm getting,

00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,684
they're gone.

No, sir. No one's been in or out

It sometimes makes him
a touch... quick.

It is a plantation operation.

114
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,203
A boat like this loads up at port,
signs on as many men as it can hold,

115
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:41,713

- You too, preacher.

All right.
Now you have my attention.

00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,453
A necessary precaution.

141
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,456
You attempt anything uncivilized...

142
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,958
killing me, for instance...

143
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,963
I detonate the explosive charge
Junner's just implanted...

144
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,966
and sleep very well tonight.

145

Walk with me.

146
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,470
You're not putting me
on a pedestal.

No. Of course not.

Mmm. Fresh as a daisy.

Suit up and report.

153
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,586
Must be something big, them taking
you off ice after what you pulled.

Sister, I certainly aim
to find out.

155

Hmm. Okay.

156
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,058
You go through all the trouble
to catch these guys,

157
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,068
and this is what
you do with them.

158
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,127
[Woman]
You're missing the point.

159
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,403
[Riddick] What point? You got a million
U.D. 's standing around collectin'dust.

160
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,344
You underestimate their value,
Riddick. They are priceless.

161
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,677
Each, at one time,

162
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,708
the most wanted man
or woman in the known universe.

163
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,687
The number oflives ended
at the hands of those...

164
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:48,386
living and breathing
in this room is incalculable.

165
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,394
Ain't what I'd call living.

166
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:56,025
Just the same, I assure you
they are all very much alive.

167
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,401
Each one sustained
in a form of cryo so profound...

168
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,633
that seconds seem weeks...

169
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,643
and to blink an eye is a day's work.

170
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,148
The brain, however,
continues to function unimpeded.

171
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,946
The mind continues
to think and feel,

172
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,818
swarming with whatever dark thoughts
it's trapped alone with,

173
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,653
as it will be for hundreds of years.

174
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:24,662
So much more fitting a fate than
dropping them off at the nearest slam.

175
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,757
Here, they are appreciated
for what they truly are,

176
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,736
transformed into objects
on par with their lives'work.

177
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,902
And why? Because I gave them the
audience they so desperately desired,

178
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,741
the recognition they bought
with the blood of others.

179
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:46,251
I understood their actions,
stripped free of moral convention.

180
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,754
Don't you see? They're
something greater now, Riddick.

181
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:54,259
Something more than
they ever were before. Art.

182
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,921
Lady, your taste sucks.

183
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,431
I expected as much.

184
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,229
Junner.

185
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,650
You see, Riddick,

186
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,187
there is a fundamental difference
between you and I.

187
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,588
Yeah. You're a psychopath.

188
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,151
You don't appreciate art.

189
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,756
But I believe the reason for this
is something very different...

190
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,096
than you or anyone else
might think.

191
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,796
You're an artist.

192
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,102
I've been called
a lot of things in my day.

193
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,108
That ain't one of'em.

194
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,873
You make art, Riddick,
not analyze it.

195
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,111
You shape it with your own hands,
carve it from flesh and bone.

196
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,951
But a man like you does not understand
such a thing by being lectured.

197
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,820
You must experience it.

198
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,129
Oh, shit.

199
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,104
I said I'd find you, didn't I?

200
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,505
What do you want?
To watch you work.

201
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:21,308
I've spent the latter half of my life
observing fantastic things...

202
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,316
the work of terrible men,
men such as yourself...

203
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,512
but it's always after the fact...

204
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,523
when the moment of bloody creation
is cold and passed.

205
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,786
That changes now.

207
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,605
I need to see it, Riddick.

208
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:52,610
I need to see it with my own eyes
as it happens.

209
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,613
I get outta there alive,
you'll see it again...

210
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,615
this close.

211
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:03,616
No, Riddick.
I want your masterpiece.

212
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,050
An artist is nothing
without his instrument.

213
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,500

I'm gonna bury this in your eye.

I was on a pilgrimage.
Just a pilgrimage.

Give me the knife.

245

Fall back. Everyone fall back.

353
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:21,390
[Woman] Here, they are appreciated
for what they truly are,

354
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:26,123
transformed into objects on par
with their lives'work.

355
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,132
Because I gave them the audience
they so desperately desired,

356
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,834
the recognition they bought
with the blood of others.
