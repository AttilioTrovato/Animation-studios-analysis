1
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,387
Who's there?

2
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,729
<i>I said, "Who's there?"</i>

3
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,660
Oi, sir!

4
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,663
<i>Sir?</i>

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,459
<i>Ah, dear, dear, dear.</i>

6
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,401
Sir?

7
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,245
- I have it. Take me to her.
- Yes, master.

8
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,866
She's been waiting.
As have I.

9
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,362
Hmm.

10
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,212
Oh, Van Helsing,
that last target was a civilian.

11
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,339
You know,
one of those innocents...

12
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,873
you Knights of the Holy Order are
sworn to protect from the dark forces.

13
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,250
Oh, I don't know, Carl.
I thought I detected...

14
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,347
a hint of demonic influence
in its beady little eyes.

15
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,619
<i>Beady?
Van Helsing.</i>

16
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,786
Carl.

17
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,853
CardinalJinette.

18
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,799
You are needed.

19
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,297
<i>Next tableau.</i>

20
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,639
And there,
the second victim.

21
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,736
Next tableau.

22
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:45,443
Victim three, what they
could find of her. And again.

23
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,453
<i>The latest victim.</i>

24
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,921
Those women died
at the hands of a monster.

25
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,585
But from eyewitness accounts,
one who was once a man.

26
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,597
Keep in mind that this man's soul
can still be saved.

27
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,429
Not every soul deserves to be.

28
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,301
Van Helsing,
since time immemorial,

29
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,704
<i>the Knights of the Holy Order
have served and sacrificed...</i>

30
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,541
<i>as humanity's protectors
from an evil so ancient...</i>

31
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,581
all have forgotten it
but we few.

32
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,878
That monster showed no mercy
to those women.

33
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,010
To remain true to our calling,

34
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,989
we must believe all souls
are worthy of salvation.

35
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,722
Stop him? Save him?
First someone's gotta find him.

36
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,131
And London's a city of almost four million
people. Shouldn't be a problem, Carl.

37
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,500
The murders were committed
in the same small section of the city.

38
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,233
And all with a surgeon's scalpel.

39
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:46,711
Now that suggests the murderer resides in the
area and is involved in the study of medicine.

40
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,977
Of course. A scientist. We
see this all the time. We do?

41
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,247
When their studies exhaust them, they're
tempted to take the easy way out...

42
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,948
to find whatever it is
they're looking for.

43
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,957
The unholy way, you mean.

44
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,926
Using the dark arts to change
from man to monster.

45
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,724
No doubt calling forth
demonic familiars to serve him.

46
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,027
And would you have it
any other way?

47
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, this I like.

48
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,472
Put her down!

49
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,810
Happy to oblige.

50
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,515
<i>Oopsie.
It's him, I tell ya.!</i>

51
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,185
<i>He's the killer.! Get him, lads.!</i>

52
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:13,289
Tell the hangman
Mr. Hyde says hello.

53
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,061
Don't let him get away!

54
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:24,300
Bloody hell! He's gone.
Like a blooming ghost.

55
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,899
Perfect. A monster that stops
to wipe his feet.

56
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,212
Clever, whoever you are,

57
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,307
but not clever enough.

58
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,412
<i>Mum, Dr. Jekyll has arrived.</i>

59
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,082
He may enter.

60
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,323
<i>You're late this evening, Doctor.</i>

61
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,833
We grew concerned. Your Majesty,
you should know by now...

62
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,894
that nothing and no one
shall ever keep me from you.

63
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,769
We are comforted by that.

64
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,503
We do look forward
to your visits.

65
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,506
Whatever medicinal miracle it is...

66
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,414
you conjure up
from your concoctions,

67
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,750
<i>we feel better and better
after each of your visits.</i>

68
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,790
As do I, Your Majesty.

69
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,985
<i>Truly, we do not know...</i>

70
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,757
<i>what we would do without you.</i>

71
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,166
<i>Oh, my.!</i>

72
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:37,339
Everything is so... twirly.

73
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,935
I'll take care of her now.

74
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,003
Yes, master.

75
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,878
After you.

76
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,735
<i>Careful, Your Majesty.</i>

77
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,000
I wouldn't want you to fall.

78
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,668
To have you so close to me,

79
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,770
I cannot help but recall
the first time I gazed upon you...

80
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,941
so many years ago.

81
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,952
<i>You were the very flower
of womanhood.</i>

82
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,954
<i>Newly on the throne.</i>

83
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,013
<i>I was a mere youth.</i>

84
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,855
<i>An impoverished student
of the medical arts.</i>

85
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,294
<i>And though I was just
one of thousands in the crowd that day,</i>

86
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,528
<i>I knew you saw me too
and shared my love.</i>

87
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,399
Don't fret, my dear.

88
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,940
You'll soon remember
everything as I do.

89
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,842
But I do remember... something.

90
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,778
I'm... I'm the queen.

91
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,782
And you, my brilliant doctor,

92
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,910
you've been treating me for that horrid
illness that makes me feel as if...

93
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,080
as if I were
a doddering old relic.

94
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,523
How better to prove
the depth of my love for you.

95
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,791
Now welcome, dear heart, to
what will soon be our new home...

96
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,025
away from prying eyes,

97
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,660
after our marriage,
of course.

98
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,934
Marriage? But am I not still ill?

99
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,568
You shall have your medicine
every night...

100
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,808
to keep you young and mine forever.

101
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,920
<i>Could you stop squirming?</i>

102
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,189
If you bought me the proper-sized corset,
I wouldn't have to squirm.

103
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,526
There. A vision of loveliness.

104
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:43,034
I told the cardinal when he got
your cable I am not a field man.

105
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,538
There's not much danger of you being
mistaken for any kind of man, Carl.

106
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,233
Oh! You put on too much powder.

107
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,708
And this lip rouge
with this scarf?

108
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,713
No real lady would be caught dead with...
Perhaps not the best choice of words.

109
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,649
<i>Carl, for a friar, you know
an awful lot about lip rouge.</i>

110
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,655
Anything worth doing is worth
doing well, even being demon bait.

111
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,953
Well, it's not as if
I could put an innocent life at risk.

112
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,959
<i>What about my innocent life?</i>

113
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,224
If you truly believe this is
beyond the scope of your calling...

114
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:15,063
Don't worry.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

115
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,232
That's what worries me.

116
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,506
<i>Come on, ducky. What do ya
say? Let us buy you a pint.</i>

117
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,513
Oh, I don't know.

118
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,175
Would you happen to be
a gentleman of medicine?

119
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,741
If that's your fancy, girlie,

120
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,652
I can play doctor
with the best of'em.

121
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,488
Physician, heal thyself.
Men, they're all the same.

122
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,962
Should we try another street corner?

123
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,100
Van Helsing,
where are you hiding now?

124
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:57,039
- It's about time you showed up.
- Sorry to keep you waiting, milady.

125
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,600
I am not a lady!

126
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,806
That's all right.
I'm not a gentleman.

127
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,991
You've only got one way
out of this.

128
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,222
I know.

129
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,666
<i>You're no priest, man.
You don't miss much.</i>

130
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,110
Ah, the fetching lady friend.

131
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,147
Stay there.

132
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,470
Don't shoot! I have no money!

133
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,411
I beg your pardon.

134
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:00,492
Can you guess what happens next?

135
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,415
This is where you get off.

136
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,401
Van Helsing,
how did you get here?

137
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,134
I, uh... I put on the brakes.
How did you get here?

138
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,006
Well, according to the map,
after 9:00, the Marelybone line...

139
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,740
Let's go see
what's left of our friend, huh?

140
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,613
I don't understand. How can I keep
losing the trail of something so big?

141
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,624
And what's this?
It's my new invention.

142
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,183
<i>La santa pistola de agua.</i>

143
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,788
The holy water pistol?
Mm-hmm.

144
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,857
I thought it might come in
handy sometime. It might.

145
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:20,633
It's as if the holy water
made contact with something...

146
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,697
Unholy.

147
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,308
Wherever he's going,
he's following this sewer line.

148
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,294
We've reached the end of the line.

149
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:53,067
Decaying flesh and sulfur.

150
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,801
This is his lair.

151
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,572
Exactly how do you propose we cross
that flaming moat of certain death?

152
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,580
The same way
Hyde must have.

153
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,344
Those stepping stones.

154
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,284
I'll go first, shall I?

155
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,982
I could have been a Franciscan,
but, no!

156
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,923
I had to travel. See the world.

157
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,865
Well done.

158
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,800
Carl, look out!

159
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,270
<i>Elizabethan. Sixteenth century.
I know those uniforms.</i>

160
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,240
<i>- They're beefeaters.
Of the dead!</i>

161
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,107
Carl, in our line of work,
there's dead...

162
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,442
and there's dead.

163
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,084
All right, that's settled.
They're really dead.

164
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,788
Van Helsing!

165
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,567
Get up the stairs.
What?

166
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,076
<i>Carl, the pistola.!</i>

167
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,482
Of course.

168
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,367
That'll work.
That'll work.

169
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,962
Van Helsing, listen.
I'm truly sorry...

170
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,702
for calling you an arrogant,
reckless popinjay.

171
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,370
You never called me
an arrogant, reckless popinjay.

172
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,538
Well, not to your face.

173
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,354
<i>Dr. Jekyll, are you there?</i>

174
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,597
Who are you?

175
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,161
Gabriel Van Helsing, miss.
And I'm...

176
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,469
<i>You should not be here,
Mr. Van Helsing.</i>

177
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,532
Hmph.
Well, don't mind me.

178
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,544
I'm not certain
you should be here, miss.

179
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,978
Very humorous, sir.

180
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,881
But you please me.

181
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:23,285
So you may address me as mum.

182
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:27,121
All right, mum.
Who's Dr. Jekyll?

183
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,286
<i>My physician. I've been very ill.</i>

184
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,956
Ill? With what?
You look fine to me.

185
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,864
I'm... not sure.

186
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,426
Well, that's something we can talk about
later. Right now, you have to leave this place.

187
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,962
<i>- Are you giving me an order?
- Pretty much.</i>

188
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:48,069
Sir, since it is obvious
you do not recognize me,

189
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,614
I am Alexandrina Victoria Wettin,

190
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:54,277
by the grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,

191
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,981
queen, defender of the faith.

192
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,523
Queen Victoria?

193
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,995
Seriously?

194
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,226
<i>Carl, meet Queen Victoria.</i>

195
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,796
Van Helsing, Queen Victoria
is a worthy matron of a certain age.

196
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,400
And this is an unholy lair where all
manner of enchantment is possible.

197
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,071
Whatever are you two
speaking about?

198
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,706
We know we're looking
for someone trained in medicine.

199
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,842
So why not consider the doctor
who's been treating the queen?

200
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:31,946
- The royal physician?
- His name is Dr. Jekyll. And we are to be married.

201
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,356
<i>When?
Tonight.</i>

202
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,122
And once we are wed,
he can give me my medicine every night.

203
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,163
So I shan't ever be ill again.

204
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,324
It fits, Carl!

205
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,368
A man of medicine
in love with the queen...

206
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,233
driven to restore her youth
looking for the easy way.

207
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:51,140
If Dr. Jekyll has concocted a potion that uses the life
he stole from his victims to give youth to Victoria...

208
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,440
Then if they marry,
these murders will never stop.

209
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,277
I have no idea
what you're prattling on about.

210
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,546
What murders? Why would I
need someone to give me youth?

211
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,056
- I'm only 20 years old!
- Your Majesty, you're 70.

212
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,650
<i>And you were married
for... for decades.</i>

213
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,594
<i>You also have nine offspring,
all grown,</i>

214
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,496
and more grandchildren
than any man can count.

215
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:19,469
I think you and your friend
should see a doctor of your own, or...

216
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,772
<i>Dr. Jekyll.!</i>

217
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,470
Stand back, Victoria.
I'll save you.

218
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,114
Come, Victoria.
Where?

219
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,586
Where we can be safe together.

220
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,862
I admit,
I don't have much experience,

221
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,202
But this is not going well, is it?

222
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,443
That way!

223
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,617
A dumbwaiter shaft?

224
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,848
How are we supposed to use it without
someone up there to pull the rope?

225
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,321
Fly?
Good idea.

226
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,288
Carl, grab hold!
Of what?

227
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,638
That worked.
Oh, maybe for you.

228
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,939
<i>Please, Doctor.! You must explain.!</i>

229
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,951
Oh, my goodness!

230
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:45,956
<i>This is Buckingham Palace
and that's the Golden Jubilee balloon.</i>

231
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,323
Your Majesty! Victoria, stop!
You're in danger!

232
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:54,024
Wait, Doctor!
They said the strangest things...

233
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,397
about you and me.

234
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,369
Lies! All lies!

235
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,367
Into the basket with her.

236
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,077
Cut the rope!

237
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,797
Don't wait for me!

238
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,836
<i>We are carrying extra weight!</i>

239
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:46,009
<i>Whoever that meddler is, I
won't let him take you from me.!</i>

240
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:50,111
- I won't!
- Doctor, what are you doing?

241
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,017
You're safe now.

242
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,997
Why are you doing this?
For your... love.

243
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,744
No! He'll never take you!
Not from me!

244
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:18,078
- Victoria.
- Forgive me, my love.

245
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,141
- I have no other way
to keep you with me.

246
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,263
Stay behind me.

247
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:37,165
- Who are you?
- What you fear most.

248
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,010
You had your chance.

249
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,178
I'm not here to kill you.
I'm here to save you.

250
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,927
- Too late.
- Good.

251
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,680
<i>No.!</i>

252
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,877
Victoria!

253
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,608
Ah, damn you!

254
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,346
Van Helsing, I can't!

255
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,283
Just lie back, close your eyes
and think of England.

256
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,995
Well, that wasn't so bad.
I agree. It was awful.

257
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,787
Your Majesty,
as I understand such things,

258
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:52,387
the light of day will lift
the enchantment and restore you.

259
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,160
So I will bid you farewell.

260
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,168
But wait.
There's so much more...

261
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,502
I mean, I...
I must reward you.

262
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,600
That's really not necessary.
A vow of poverty and all that.

263
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,271
Not all rewards
must be material.

264
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:13,943
For your reward, you may kiss
your queen... on the royal cheek.

265
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,818
I would be honored, mum.

266
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,861
Huh? Hmm.

267
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,703
Psst!

268
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,539
<i>Psst.!</i>

269
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,313
We are not amused!

270
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,979
<i>Guards.!
Oh, dear. Let's go, Carl!</i>

271
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,182
Guards! Guards!

272
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,860
You'll need to report to the
cardinal in person. What do I say?

273
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,368
This isn't over.

274
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,666
Hyah!

275
00:30:35,999 --> 00:31:07,999
