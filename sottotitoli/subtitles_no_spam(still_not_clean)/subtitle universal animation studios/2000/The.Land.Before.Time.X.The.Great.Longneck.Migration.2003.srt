that sleep story.

Did, too!

532
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,042
Not!
Too!

533
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:04,144
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

534
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:06,179
Wanna do
something about it?
BRON: Shorty?

535
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:07,915
Shorty,
what's going on?

536
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:18,025
Ow! He stepped on
my tail, on purpose.

537
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:19,927
Who did?

538
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,028
Him.

539
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:23,564
Him? You mean the one
you tripped?

540
00:40:23,597 --> 00:40:27,501
Yeah, he... I mean, no,
I didn't trip him.

541
00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:29,970
Shorty, come on, it's me.
Now give me the truth.

542
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:35,543
Oh, okay. I tripped him.

543
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:36,977
So what do you
say now?

544
00:40:37,778 --> 00:40:38,912
Sorry.

545
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:40,080
It's okay.

546
00:40:44,117 --> 00:40:46,086
Shorty is a good
kid at heart.

547
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,556
He just likes to
get things started.

548
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:50,958
You okay?
No permanent damage?

549
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,060
(CHUCKLES) No, I'm fine.

550
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,695
Good.

551

What's yours?

552
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,934
Littlefoot.

553
00:41:00,968 --> 00:41:05,806
No kidding? That's funny.
They called me Littlefoot
when I was young.

554
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,208
Really?
That is kind of...

in that fast water.
No, no, no.

00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,238

I got my own way to go.

You just seem to keep
passing across it.

577
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:42,636
Yeah, well, that's real
interesting. Bye!

578
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,876
You sure you couldn't
use some help now?

579
00:42:51,211 --> 00:42:53,747
No, thanks, we'll be
fine on our own.

If you get a good
running start,

586
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,706
you can jump over
that water easy.

587
00:43:19,707 --> 00:43:21,408
Fine, then you go first.

588
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,911
Okay, then. I will.

589
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:44,932

you be back in

I never doubted it
for a minute.

598
00:44:18,298 --> 00:44:21,969
I had an idea of my own
about how to get you
across the water,

599
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:23,737
if you're of a mind
to listen to it.

Phew! Not as young
as I used to be.

605
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:56,069
Well, here we are
on the other side.

606
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:58,105
But is this the way
you wanted to go?

607
00:44:58,138 --> 00:45:01,474
Not sure, but somehow,
it feels right.

608
00:45:03,877 --> 00:45:06,013
Yeah, I guess
it is at that.

609
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:09,216
You mean, you no know
which way you go?

610
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:12,986
Not exactly.
See, I've been having
these sleep stories.

611
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:16,489
(GASPING)

612
00:45:16,523 --> 00:45:20,327
You know, I think we might
be going the same way
as you after all.

613
00:45:37,577 --> 00:45:38,946
Littlefoot.

614
00:45:42,582 --> 00:45:44,918
Littlefoot,
we have to talk.

615
00:45:46,386 --> 00:45:50,190
Where were you
all this time?
Where were you?

616
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:52,192
Oh, Littlefoot.

617
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:57,030
Your mother and I knew
we were going to have
a hatchling.

618
00:45:59,232 --> 00:46:02,302
You see, we wanted to
raise you in a safe place.

619
00:46:02,335 --> 00:46:04,938
So before you were
even an egg,

620
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:07,875
I went off to find
a new home for all of us.

621
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:24,591
When I got back,
the earthshakes had
changed everything.

622
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,231
It took me so long to find
where the nest had been,
and nothing was left

623
00:46:31,264 --> 00:46:35,335
but a crack in the earth
as deep as a mountain is high.

624
00:46:35,368 --> 00:46:40,173
As I searched for your mother
and the young one I knew
had been born,

625
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:43,010
the great circle rose
and fell many times,

626
00:46:43,043 --> 00:46:45,045
but I couldn't find you
anywhere.

627
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:49,616
I finally met someone
who told me about...

628
00:46:49,649 --> 00:46:52,085
About your mom
and a Sharptooth.

629
00:46:55,288 --> 00:46:57,958
But he had no word about you,
so I kept searching.

630
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:03,596
And then one day,
I met a group of
young Longnecks

631
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,667
wandering in the wilderness
with no grownups
to protect them.

632
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,970
At first I hoped
one of them was you,

633
00:47:11,304 --> 00:47:13,974
but I soon realized
that wasn't the case.

634
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:20,513
But they came to depend on me,
so I stayed with them,
took care of them.

635
00:47:23,516 --> 00:47:26,053
And then some others
joined up with us.

636
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,391
And then some more,
and some more.

637
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,963
In time, we were a herd.

638
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:48,208
You mean,
you're the leader
of a whole herd?

639
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,243
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

640
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:54,281
Wow.

641
00:47:54,314 --> 00:47:58,585
And look at you!
You've grown up to be
a fine young Longneck.

642
00:47:58,618 --> 00:48:02,055
Just like I'd hoped
you'd be. Your mom
would be proud.

643
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,992
She'd be proud
of you, too.

* My dad

666

* And since you came my way
I'm, oh, so glad

667
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:28,668
* And I'm proud to be your son
'cause you're my favorite one

668

* And only dad

00:52:41,368 --> 00:52:45,605
Anyway, that's what my
sleep story was like.
Pretty mysterious.

00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:47,874
What do you think
it means?

698
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:50,777
Don't really know.

699
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:54,814
But it put me in mind
of a story my granddaddy
used to tell me.

700
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:57,584
It seems that a long,
long time ago,

701
00:52:57,617 --> 00:52:59,686
the night circle got jealous
of the great circle.

702
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:04,557
What do you mean, jealous?
Jealous why?

703
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:07,994
Oh, on account of how
the great circle is
so much brighter

704
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:10,430
and folks stay
awake for it,

705
00:53:10,463 --> 00:53:13,933
but sleep while the night
circle is up there.
Things like that.

706
00:53:15,535 --> 00:53:17,837
(WHIMPERING)

707
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,574
You better keep moving,
kids. Not safe to stand
in one place too long.

708
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:24,511
(SCREAMING)

709
00:53:24,544 --> 00:53:28,781
Anyway, so the night circle
grabbed the great circle
and threw it from the sky

710
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:31,384
so it'd smash into
the world below.

711
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:34,287
(GASPS) Oh, my!

712
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:38,358
But there just so happened
to be a herd of Longnecks
standing down there,

713
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:40,393
and they stretched
their necks up

714
00:53:40,427 --> 00:53:42,895
and caught the great circle
on their heads

715
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:48,801
and then shoved it right
back up into the sky.
Now, how about that?

716
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:52,472
So that's why,
to this very day,
we have such long necks,

717
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:55,475
so we can put
the great circle
back up in the sky.

718
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:59,379
Longnecks saved
the world, huh?

719
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:01,748
Well, that's the story.

720
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,783
Whether or not
you believe it,
it's up to you.

721
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:06,018

722
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:08,521

723
00:54:08,555 --> 00:54:09,789
Oh!

724
00:54:09,822 --> 00:54:11,358

725
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:13,393

those hills, I think you'll
find your friend.

735

But we cannot
go without you.
No, no, no.

736
00:54:55,435 --> 00:54:57,437
Me no think so neither.

737
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:01,408
Now, children,
there's no sense
in all of us missing...

738
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:05,445
Well, I don't know what.
But I got a feeling it's
going to be spectacular.

Well, what do you know?

744
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:29,101
For once in my life,
I can't think of
a word to say.

745
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:38,578
What do you think
is going to happen?

746
00:55:38,611 --> 00:55:41,414
I don't know, Littlefoot.
Something wonderful.

Hey, how come
we haven't seen
any Sharpteeth?

763
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:29,896
Sharpteeth are cowards.
Look how many of us
there are.

764
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:33,032
A Sharptooth would never
attack a group this size.

765
00:56:33,065 --> 00:56:35,802
Remember, they only hunt
in twos and threes.
