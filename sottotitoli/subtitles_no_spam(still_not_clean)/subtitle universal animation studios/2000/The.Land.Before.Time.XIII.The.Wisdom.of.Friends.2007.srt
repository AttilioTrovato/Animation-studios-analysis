1
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:12,777
<i>Our world has existed
for billions of years</i>

2
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,259
<i>and has been home to many
different types of creatures.</i>

3
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:40,161
<i>All have faced
unexpected challenges</i>

4
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,233
<i>and have had to develop their own
kinds of wisdom to keep them safe.</i>

5
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:17,388
<i>The dinosaurs of the Great Valley
had to learn some lessons, too.</i>

6
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:13,553
Hey, Grandma!

7
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,722
Look at me!

8
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:24,508
Littlefoot, come down from there!
That's quite a drop!

9
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,778
But, Grandma, there's still
some tree stars on it!

10
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:31,282
There are plenty of tree stars
on this tree, dear.

11
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:33,740
But I can get these
all by myself.

12
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:41,776
Grandma!

13
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:45,375
Littlefoot! I'm coming!

14
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:50,881
Littlefoot, I've got you.

15
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:01,196
Grandma!

16
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:12,590
Grandma, are you okay?

17
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:14,946
Yes, dear, I think so.

18
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:22,917
I would have been okay
except for the earthshake.

19
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,051
It's all right.

20
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:12,082
Grandma!

21
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:13,903
I'm here, Littlefoot.

22
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,222
Everything's fine.

23
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:20,976
We were back there
at the old tree

24
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,479
and you were falling.

25
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,177
But I didn't fall.

26
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,912
You were just having
a sleep story.

27
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:33,187
I didn't mean to cause
all that trouble, Grandma.

28
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:35,128
I'm so sorry.

29
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:37,441
I know, dear.

30
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:41,526
But no one knows what life is going
to bring us before it happens.

31
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:46,966
That's why we learn the Wisdoms.

32
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:49,208
The Wisdoms?

33
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,604
I remember them!

34
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,747
What were they again?

35
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,100
Those are the ways of doing
things which help us stay safe

36
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:05,251
when the unexpected happens.

37
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:09,673
Like this one,
"Stay in a group."

38
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:14,678
I stayed near you, so I was able
to help when you got into trouble.

39
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:18,248
Your grandpa and I have tried
to teach you the Wisdoms,

40
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:21,435
although we may not have
always called them that.

41
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:29,107
Well, I want to remember all of them.
Tell me the Wisdoms, Grandma.

42
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:43,207
Me make it this time!
You see!

43
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:46,598
Okay, but no fair flying.
That's against the rules.

44
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,043
Nice try, Petrie.

45
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,434
Me think flying should be fair!

46
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,653
Yeah, I guess you do!

47
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:17,441
You do not see me saying
swimming should be fair.

48
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,309
No, no, no.

49
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,461
Maybe you should just
try to be a better jumper.

50
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:24,702
Like me.

51
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:31,737
Whoa!

52
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:36,744
Cera! Hang on!
I'm coming!

53
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,849
Hey! Let go!

54
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,967
Whoa!

55
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,904
What's wrong with you guys?
Help her!

56
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:49,658
Calm down!
Who needs help?

57
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,981
Wait. It's just a game?

58
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:00,083
Sure.
What'd you think?

59
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:03,338
We playing "Jump and Get
Swept Away." It fun.

60
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:08,109
I think pretending to be in
trouble is against the Wisdoms.

61
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,527
What are Wisdoms?

62
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:15,215
They help you be safe. Like "Stay
in a group" or "Work together."

63
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,605
Oh, you mean the Say-So's.

64
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:22,706
The what?

65
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,074
The Say-So's!

66
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:27,397
Mom tell me to do those things
'cause she say so!

67
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:37,054
<i>Me wanna go play
on a drippily day</i>

68
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:40,524
<i>And me mother say me can't go</i>

69
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,927
<i>When me ask her why
she look me in the eye</i>

70
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:47,898
<i>and say, "Because me say so"</i>

71
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:50,667
<i>Oh, oh, me can't say no</i>

72
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:54,671
<i>When your mama says stay,
you cannot go</i>

73
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:57,741
<i>Me have to do
what she want me to</i>

74
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:58,809
<i>Why?</i>

75
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,445
<i>Because she say so</i>

76
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:04,481
<i>Say so, say, say so</i>

77
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:07,851
Well, whatever you call them,
you better do them!

78
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,453
<i>Wisdoms are important</i>

79
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:11,221
<i>But not much fun</i>

80
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,123
<i>And I'm gonna learn them</i>

81
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:14,558
<i>Every one?</i>

82
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:17,861
<i>And if you're smart,
you'll learn them, too</i>

83
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:18,929
<i>Why?</i>

84
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:21,798
<i>'Cause Littlefoot say so</i>

85
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:25,135
<i>Say so, say, say so</i>

86
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,505
<i>Say so, say, say so</i>

87
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,441
<i>Say so, say, say so</i>

88
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:32,543
<i>Why?</i>

89
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,933
<i>Because he say so</i>

90
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:45,568
Hey, Littlefoot,
what's the matter?

91
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,002
Can't take a joke?

92
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,442
And what is it with everybody and
these Wisdoms all of a sudden?

93
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,464
Even my folks have them.

94
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:57,924
Tria says, "Don't climb up
if you can't get back down."

95
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:03,373
Here one of Mom's,
"Keep eyes and ears open."

96
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,343
My mom says,
"Be home before dark."

97
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,444
Yeah.

98
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:11,928
So we've all got them, but do we have
to make such a big deal about them?

99
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:18,622
<i>My folks are always telling me</i>

100
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:21,291
<i>all the things I ought to do</i>

101
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:25,429
<i>Like, "Don't climb up
if you can't get down"</i>

102
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,932
<i>They call that a "Gotta Do"</i>

103
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:31,702
<i>Egad! It makes me mad</i>

104
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:35,105
<i>Why do I have to
listen to my dad?</i>

105
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:38,875
<i>Because he knows
what's good for you</i>

106
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,545
<i>All I hear is, "Gotta Do"</i>

107
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,313
<i>Gotta plan ahead</i>

108
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:45,415
<i>Gotta work together</i>

109
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:48,785
<i>Do not sit on a prickly thorn</i>

110
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:51,955
<i>Listen to your folks
'cause they know better</i>

111
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:55,915
<i>If something's in your way
bump it with your horn</i>

112
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:59,811
<i>Bump it with your horn</i>

113
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,668
<i>Hey-ho, we know it's true</i>

114
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:08,005
<i>The Wisdoms say
what's right to do</i>

115
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,908
<i>But do I have to hear them
from you, too?</i>

116
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,710
<i>Say so</i>

117
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,412
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta</i>

118
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:18,148
<i>Hey-ho, we know it's true</i>

119
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:21,485
<i>The Wisdoms say
what's right to do</i>

120
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:23,053
<i>They're good for me</i>

121
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:24,121
<i>And you</i>

122
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:25,188
<i>And you</i>

123
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:28,959
<i>Gotta, gotta do
what the Say-So's say to do</i>

124
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,027
<i>Bump it</i>

125
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:31,279
<i>Gotta do</i>

126
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:32,929
<i>Gotta do</i>

127
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,398
<i>We gotta do</i>

128
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:35,719
<i>Bump it</i>

129
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,124
Whoa!

130
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,880
Cera! What's the matter?

131
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:53,271
There's something in there,
something strange.

132
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:04,950
Well, hello!

133
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:09,499
What did you say?

134
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:10,901
I wasn't talking to you.

135
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,825
Then, who were you talking to?

136
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,338
Him?

137
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,454
Nope.

138
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:19,424
Them.

139
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:24,395
Oh!

140
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,607
Hello, them!

141
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,901
You're beautiful!

142
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,212
I'm Doofah!

143
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,014
I'm Loofah!

144
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:40,063
Loofah? Doofah?

145
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:41,748
And that's Foobie!

146
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,025
Got any berries around here?
We're starving!

147
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:58,203
Yellow Bellies
sure like berries!

148
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,531
How long has it been
since you ate?

149
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:05,838
Must have been...
Let's see.

150
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,391
Right before you guys showed up!

151
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:09,993
But not berries!

152
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:11,862
Berries are the best!

153
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,964
The place where we're headed
for has berries, too.

154
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:16,616
And it's a valley,
just like this one.

155
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:19,369
I wish I could remember
what it's called.

156
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:21,671
It's got a real catchy name.

157
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:23,162
Is it Doofah?

158
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:26,865
Oh! No!
Oh, that's my name!

159
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:30,847
Don't worry.

160
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:33,884
The Wise One
will figure it out eventually.

161
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:35,637
There's a wise one?

162
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,602
That's a relief.

163
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,990
Berry Valley! That's what it's called!
Right, Doofah?

164
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:56,992
Hang on. I got you.
I got you.

165
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,885
Thanks, Loofah.

166
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,707
We call that one
the Yellow Belly Bounce.

167
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:15,992
Got anything to drink
around here?

168
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:17,108
Sure.

169
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,613
Come on!

170
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:24,446
Berry Valley! They got lots
and lots of berries there!

171
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:33,464
Us used to have
lots of berries here, too.

172
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:45,177
So, where's
the rest of your herd?

173
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:47,639
Did you get lost from them?

174
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,393
No, see, we're still on our
way to meet up with the herd.

175
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:53,284
Then we'll all go to...
What was it again?

176
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,398
Berry Valley!

177
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:57,334
Ever since our herd
first heard of Berry Valley,

178
00:14:57,358 --> 00:15:00,759
we've wanted very badly to be
Berry Valley Yellow Bellies.

179
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,908
Yeah, there's nothing Yellow
Bellies love better than berries

180
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:09,062
and a valley filled with berries means
lots of berries to fill us Yellow Bellies!

181
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:16,304
Me no understand them so good.

182
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:19,936
So, where are you
meeting your herd?

183
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,438
No idea!
Can't remember!

184
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:26,214
Then, how do you know
which way to go?

185
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:29,518
Simple.
We'll go this way.

186
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,561
We'll go this way.

187
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:48,537
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.

188
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,504
You're beautiful!

189
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:56,344
Goodbye.

190
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:02,279
I hope they've got
plenty of time to get there.

191
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:40,054
No! Keep your eyes and ears open!
It's a long drop!

192
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:57,432
Go!

193
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:11,950
That does it!
We've got to help them.

194
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,233
This is ridiculous!

195
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:35,692
I'm sure if the Yellow Bellies
knew some of the Wisdoms,

196
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,528
they could stay safe
until they find their herd.

197
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:40,747
Oh, come on!

198
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,514
So, I'm gonna teach them.

199
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:54,177
Who cares if those three go wandering
around in the Mysterious Beyond?

200
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,613
I do.
Yup, yup, yup.

201
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:57,747
Me, too.

202
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:01,969
After the sleep story I just had,
I can't let them go like this!

203
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:06,171
You and your sleep stories.
You've got to learn to relax.

204
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:10,877
Me think you got to stop eating tree
stars right before sleepy time.

205
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,421
Look at that.
Amazing, isn't it?

206
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:28,868
There it is,
the Mysterious Beyond.

207
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:35,096
It looks so mysterious!

208
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:45,512
Whoa. That looks
even more mysterious.

209
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,187
Hi, guys.

210
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,799
Hard ground.

211
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,017
You came to see us off?

212
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,133
Yeah.

213
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:14,905
That is so beautiful!

214
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:20,849
Look, we don't think
you're ready to go.

215
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:22,432
What?

216
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:23,533
Huh?

217
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:27,437
But we have to. We have to
lead our herd to Berry Valley.

218
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:29,520
They'd be lost without us.

219
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:33,676
You not gonna say something?

220
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,099
Maybe later.

221
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:40,103
Okay, but first I've got
to teach you some Wisdoms.

222
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,484
Wisdoms?

223
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:44,773
Yeah. 'Cause you never know
what's going to happen.

224
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:04,255
Hey!

225
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,394
This is kind of fun!

226
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:37,629
That wasn't so bad.

227
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,006
Where he go?

228
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,626
Loofah!

229
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,912
You okay?

230
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,282
Fine!

231
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,340
And guess what?

232
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:13,476
I just remembered where we're
supposed to meet our herd.

233
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,129
At a big pile of rocks
that look just like us!

234
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,777
Now, if we could only find it.

235
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:30,373
Nope.
Not around here.

236
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:38,992
They look like brothers.

237
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:43,592
Only that big far one
made of rock.

238
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,131
Wow!

239
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:56,102
We look like that?

240
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:04,082
Good job, Foobie.
You spotted it.

241
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,017
That's one of the Wisdoms
I'm going to teach you.

242
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:13,222
Wisdoms?
Teach?

243
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:15,905
Yeah.

244
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:18,541
They're things that'll
keep you safe out there.

245
00:22:18,565 --> 00:22:21,711
I'm gonna tell them to you and
then you just repeat after me.

246
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:22,861
Okay?

247
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:25,730
Sure.

248
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:28,672
Here goes.

249
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:31,954
"Keep your eyes
and ears open."

250
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:34,057
You got it.
We're ready.

251
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:36,693
No, no, no, that's
the first Wisdom.

252
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:37,706
What is?

253
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:40,342
Did I miss it?

254
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,682
And I was listening so hard.

255
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:47,103
Me no think it gonna work.

256
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:48,890
And we've got to go.

257
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:51,341
It's a long hike back home.

258
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:54,198
All uphill, and
we've only got till dark.

259
00:22:57,404 --> 00:22:59,201
Come on!

260
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:09,340
I think maybe she is right.

261
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:13,115
They can see the meeting
place from here.

262
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:18,120
And Wise One take care of
them once they get there.

263
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:24,527
Well.
Yeah, I guess.

264
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,297
Well, bye.

265
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:29,345
Good luck.

266
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:32,566
And at least stay in a group.

267
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:34,972
You got it!

268
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:54,620
You're beautiful!

269
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:06,416
Well, that was a fun way
to spend the morning.

270
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,501
At least I gave them one
Wisdom, "Stay in a group."

271
00:24:10,977 --> 00:24:13,309
Maybe they'll even remember it.

272
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:16,914
I do not think so.
No, no, no.

273
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:31,562
Fine! We'll help them, but just
till they find their herd.

274
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:38,335
Oh, Wise One
better be really wise.

275
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,836
I'm sure we can get them there and
still make it home before dark.

276
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:46,978
You promise?

277
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:48,773
Okay.

278
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,188
Well, back so soon?

279
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:34,554
Loofah!

280
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:38,687
You scared...

281
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:41,277
Where'd you come from?

282
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:44,600
Remember what I told you,
about staying in a group?

283
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:47,297
"Stay in a group."

284
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:49,766
Sounds like fun!

285
00:25:50,644 --> 00:25:54,205
So we're gonna stay with you
to find your herd.

286
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:59,242
Once you're in your group,
we can get home before dark.

287
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:04,749
Okay.

288
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,284
Do you want to lead
or should we?

289
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:11,889
I think we will.

290
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:43,325
Me no laugh. It her.

291
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:55,302
I do not believe
you tolded on me!

292
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:19,742
So these, what do you call them,
Wisdoms you were talking about?

293
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:22,178
Explain them to me again.
Would you, please?

294
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:26,468
They're just thoughts to help you
get through life and stay safe.

295
00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:31,101
Oh, you mean like, "Go with
the flow of the big water"

296
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:35,977
or "Up with your tush
and you'll look like a bush"?

297
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:37,775
Huh?

298
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:41,252
I don't even understand
that one.

299
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:43,566
Just relax.

300
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,135
There's nothing out here
to be so worried about.

301
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,172
We're completely alone!

302
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:52,824
Alone!

303
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,632
Alone!

304
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:08,912
Can't we just go home?

305
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,816
They're doing fine now.

306
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:15,586
Come on!
They don't need us anymore.

307
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,835
All they have to do is walk to
that big funny looking rock.

308
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:21,827
Surely they can do that.

309
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:26,462
I'm

310
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:29,129
thirsty!

311
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:31,998
Okay, maybe I spoke too soon.

312
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:33,667
Me, too.

313
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:37,887
But we passed a watering
hole just a while back.

314
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:40,256
Why didn't you drink something?

315
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,893
Well, I wasn't thirsty then.

316
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,350
Me, neither.

317
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,577
Sure thirsty now, though.

318
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:54,953
There's a Wisdom about this!

319
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:56,995
"Plan ahead!"

320
00:28:57,964 --> 00:29:00,876
Come to think of it,
I am thirsty, too.

321
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,424
No tell Cera.

322
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:04,695
She yell at you.

323
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:09,601
Okay, we'll try to find
another watering hole.

324
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:12,688
Let's look down there.

325
00:29:12,712 --> 00:29:15,340
All the way down there?

326
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:18,347
We're too thirsty to move.

327
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:24,122
Okay, fine. We'll be right back.
Just stay in a group.

328
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:52,513
This is so weird.

329
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,498
I'm seeing one of those things.

330
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:57,066
What things?

331
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,835
You know when it's really hot and
you look out and you see something,

332
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:02,919
and it looks so real
but it's not really there?

333
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,158
Oh, yeah!
I see it, too!

334
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,028
Hey, Foobie!
Look!

335
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,367
It seems so real.

336
00:30:25,652 --> 00:30:27,381
Wow, I can even hear it!

337
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:38,527
I could even smell its breath.
That was nasty.

338
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:46,334
I think they're real!

339
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:48,469
Me, too!

340
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:59,010
Run!

341
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:16,965
That not sound good.

342
00:31:57,577 --> 00:32:01,946
Now my head hurts
and I'm still thirsty.

343
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:10,749
They're trapped!

344
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:32,606
We got to help them!

345
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:53,927
Now!

346
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:10,960
Got one!

347
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,508
Yup, yup, yup!

348
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:18,153
Let's go!

349
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:34,783
They sure run fast
when they want to.

350
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:36,900
Yeah. We better catch them.

351
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,053
Whoa! Slow down!
It's okay!

352
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:10,468
So? Did you find
any water?

353
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,791
That's it!
Cera, wait!

354
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:18,249
We've got to get
out of here. Now!

355
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:19,816
Okay-dokey.

356
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:26,018
Here we go again.

357
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:41,163
Cera, do you really think once they find
their herd, they can make it on their own?

358
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:45,275
Sure! Are you kidding?
You see how fast they can run?

359
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:50,883
Yeah. As long as
they know when to run.

360
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,360
We made it!

361
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:23,609
Do our rear ends
really look like that?

362
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,742
Wow.

363
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:40,126
Water!

364
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:04,066
Hey! Hi, guys!

365
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,853
She talks to bushes?

366
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,351
What are they doing?

367
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,721
Hiding. "Up with your tush
and you look like a bush."

368
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,007
Remember?

369
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:32,949
Oh, is that why you keep smacking
your heads on the ground?

370
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:36,483
Sometimes the dirt's
just too hard.

371
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:38,883
Hey!

372
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,483
It's us!
Stand up!

373
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:56,137
Well, we found herd. Time to go.
Home before dark. That deal.

374
00:36:57,043 --> 00:37:00,444
Yeah, but maybe not now.

375
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:04,626
We came to show the Yellow
Bellies how to obey the Wisdoms

376
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,495
and now we are breaking one?

377
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,613
That does not make a lot of sense.
No, no, no.

378
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:11,466
I'm sorry.

379
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,403
I just think it's safer to
stay here with the big group

380
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:17,260
and wait for the bright
circle to rise again.

381
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,056
Oh, our folks
is gonna worry for sure.

382
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:36,239
Have you seen the children?

383
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,750
No, and I always tell Cera
to be home before dark.

384
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:48,558
They know the Wisdoms. I wouldn't worry,
but perhaps we should speak to the others.

385
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,097
I cannot do it!
No, no, no!

386
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:33,705
Sure you can!
It's easy!

387
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:36,771
Petrie! You try, too.
No!

388
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,868
See? Like this!

389
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,000
<i>Come on, come on and dance</i>

390
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:53,935
<i>Come on and move your feet</i>

391
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:57,906
<i>Come on swing your tail around
to the Yellow Belly beat</i>

392
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,975
<i>Come on, come on and dance</i>

393
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:01,777
<i>Come on and shake a leg</i>

394
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:03,712
<i>Now's the time to take a chance</i>

395
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:05,080
<i>Don't be a scary egg</i>

396
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:06,148
Petrie.

397
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:07,549
<i>Me no can dance</i>

398
00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:09,351
<i>Come on and try</i>

399
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,453
<i>Me no good on the ground</i>

400
00:39:11,477 --> 00:39:13,121
<i>Me do better in the sky</i>

401
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,189
Ducky.

402
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:15,857
<i>We two not dance</i>

403
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:17,826
<i>We not like you</i>

404
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,361
<i>You look so silly</i>

405
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,910
<i>Thanks.
Silly is what we do</i>

406
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:56,198
Hey, don't you wanna come dance?

407
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:58,467
In your sleep stories, pal.

408
00:39:58,491 --> 00:40:00,469
Come on, it's fun!

409
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:02,757
Thanks anyway.
You go ahead.

410
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:07,357
What?

411
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:12,769
That's quite a horn
you got there!

412
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:16,435
Thanks. And I'm gonna
grow two more!

413
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:19,600
Wow! Hey, guys!
Look at this!

414
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,057
Littlefoot, thanks. Thank you for
helping us find our friends.

415
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:35,886
Sure.

416
00:40:35,995 --> 00:40:39,089
Course, we would have
found them anyway.

417
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:42,925
You think so?
Without any Wisdoms?

418
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:47,149
Maybe we have some
and we just didn't know it.

419
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:51,109
How about this? "Things work
out if you just let them."

420
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:54,611
Nope. Sorry.

421
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,359
Well, I got one.

422
00:40:57,383 --> 00:41:00,147
"Stop worrying about tomorrow
and come on and dance!"

423
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,403
<i>Come on, come on and dance</i>

424
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,338
<i>Come on and move your feet</i>

425
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:13,975
<i>Come on swing your tail around
to the Yellow Belly beat</i>

426
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:16,344
<i>Look at me dance</i>

427
00:41:16,368 --> 00:41:17,913
<i>Me dance okay</i>

428
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:19,481
<i>I can bump with the best</i>

429
00:41:19,505 --> 00:41:22,417
<i>Oh, think me dance the other way</i>

430
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,152
<i>Don't be sad and glooby</i>

431
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:25,253
<i>Glooby?</i>

432
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:27,789
<i>Don't be mad and calm</i>

433
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:30,281
<i>No calm</i>

434
00:41:30,382 --> 00:41:32,127
<i>Take it here from Foobie</i>

435
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:33,228
<i>Foobie!</i>

436
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:35,630
<i>He knows that life is fun</i>

437
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:38,099
<i>Oh, yes, it's fun</i>

438
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:40,101
<i>Don't think about the future</i>

439
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,137
<i>Don't worry about a thing</i>

440
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:44,072
<i>Tomorrow will be beautiful</i>

441
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:46,374
<i>So come along and sing, oh!</i>

442
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:48,376
<i>Come on, come on and dance</i>

443
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,178
<i>Come on and fluff your fuzz</i>

444
00:41:50,202 --> 00:41:51,279
<i>Spin, spin</i>

445
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:52,714
<i>And a grin</i>

446
00:41:52,738 --> 00:41:54,316
<i>Be happy just because</i>

447
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,218
<i>Come on and tap your toes</i>

448
00:41:56,242 --> 00:41:58,286
<i>Come on and click your beak</i>

449
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,155
<i>Touch your belly on the ground</i>

450
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,775
<i>And give a great big squeak</i>

451
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:05,906
Squeak!

452
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,430
Hey, Littlefoot!

453
00:42:08,454 --> 00:42:09,931
Squeak!

454
00:42:09,955 --> 00:42:11,718
Petrie!

455
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:15,088
Cera!

456
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,311
<i>Come on, come on and dance</i>

457
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,380
<i>Come on and shout, "Hooray!"</i>

458
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:27,415
<i>Come on and be a Yellow Belly</i>

459
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:29,417
<i>Come on, come on, come on</i>

460
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:31,386
<i>Come on, come on, come on</i>

461
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,121
<i>Come on, come on, come on</i>

462
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:34,856
<i>Come on, come on, come on</i>

463
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,075
<i>Come on and dance</i>

464
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,241
<i>Come on, come on and dance</i>

465
00:43:32,438 --> 00:43:33,530
Cera.

466
00:43:34,106 --> 00:43:35,198
Cera.

467
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,135
What?

468
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:41,923
I'm going to take the Yellow
Bellies to Berry Valley.

469
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:44,074
Oh, come on!

470
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:48,619
Well, you met their group.
Did you see any Wise One?

471
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,016
Not really.

472
00:43:56,562 --> 00:43:57,961
Me, neither.

473
00:43:58,364 --> 00:44:01,527
We already had to save them
from Sharpteeth once.

474
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:04,664
I just don't think
they stand a chance.

475
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:08,002
I'm going with them.

476
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:10,533
You?

477
00:44:14,313 --> 00:44:17,424
Hey, you know, Littlefoot,
the Yellow Bellies

478
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:20,128
got along just fine
before they met us.

479
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:23,315
Maybe they were just lucky,
and luck can run out.

480
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,186
But Wisdoms can keep you safe.

481
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,725
There's one more Wisdom
you should know.

482
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:36,229
Don't ever wake me up again!

483
00:45:11,904 --> 00:45:14,304
Now I'm worried.

484
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:50,335
You really think we can lead this
herd of goofballs to Berry Valley?

485
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,303
You mean you're with me?

486
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:57,292
You'd be lost without us.

487
00:45:57,316 --> 00:46:01,596
Yeah. Besides, me no wanna be the
one who explains to grown-ups

488
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,898
why you no come back with us.

489
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:07,414
It would not be pretty.
No, no, no.

490
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,461
Hey, listen up!

491
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:22,162
Quiet!

492
00:46:30,149 --> 00:46:31,480
All right!

493
00:46:32,117 --> 00:46:34,915
Go on. Give them
one of your Wisdoms.

494
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:42,259
How are they gonna hear me with
their heads buried in the sand?

495
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:09,985
Go on. Give them
one of your Wisdoms.

496
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,287
The first thing is
we've got to stay in a group.

497
00:47:16,195 --> 00:47:19,631
Stay in a group.
Sounds like fun.

498
00:47:26,438 --> 00:47:28,929
Okay, everyone, here we go.

499
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:36,566
They go wrong way.

500
00:48:37,009 --> 00:48:38,374
Me get him!

501
00:48:38,677 --> 00:48:41,202
Back with others.
Back with others.

502
00:48:49,988 --> 00:48:55,119
No, no, no. Excuse me. Excuse me, please!
We must stay in a group.

503
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:35,496
Oh, dear.

504
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:40,300
I don't like the look of this.

505
00:49:59,992 --> 00:50:03,223
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

506
00:50:04,196 --> 00:50:05,561
Sort of.

507
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:09,544
See, I've never heard of
Berry Valley before,

508
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:12,447
so it's got to be someplace
I've never been.

509
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:13,631
Right?

510
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:16,268
Yeah!

511
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:20,421
So, I'm going in directions
I've never gone before.

512
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:23,778
I'm bound to hit it sooner or later.
Make sense?

513
00:50:25,217 --> 00:50:27,628
Maybe to some folks.

514
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:29,347
Makes sense to me.

515
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:34,035
Is that good or bad?

516
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:35,822
Do you have to ask?

517
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:45,661
Hey, could you find us
some water? I'm thirsty.

518
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:49,002
We're bound to hit water soon.

519
00:50:50,876 --> 00:50:52,434
Great! 'Cause I...

520
00:50:53,645 --> 00:50:54,839
Loofah!

521
00:51:05,057 --> 00:51:07,582
Hey, everybody!
Loofah found some...

522
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:17,178
...water.

523
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,480
Loofah! You found it!

524
00:51:19,504 --> 00:51:21,870
I didn't find it. You did!

525
00:51:23,575 --> 00:51:25,270
Wow! Really?

526
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:43,971
So, how did I do it?

527
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:45,339
Do what?

528
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:46,874
Find the water.

529
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:51,446
Same way you'll find Berry Valley.
Same way we do just about everything.

530
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,495
We just feel it.

531
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:56,017
But it doesn't make sense.

532
00:51:56,041 --> 00:52:00,688
If you just feel it,
then you never think about it.

533
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:04,739
So, how can you be sure
you're following the Wisdoms?

534
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:09,053
Now you're thinking
like a Longneck again.

535
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,880
Okay, forget I said that.

536
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:30,839
Excuse me!

537
00:52:36,214 --> 00:52:40,394
I do not like so many rushing feet!
No, no, no!

538
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:42,648
Loofah!
Where are they going?

539
00:52:43,088 --> 00:52:45,181
Berry Valley!
You found it!

540
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:47,285
Really?

541
00:52:57,602 --> 00:53:01,436
This can't be Berry Valley.
It's too small.

542
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,379
It's not Berry Valley.

543
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,639
Who cares?
We're hungry.

544
00:53:31,236 --> 00:53:33,932
Oh, come on!
Me want a turn.

545
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:40,001
Leave it to me.
Move it!

546
00:53:44,216 --> 00:53:46,309
Wow.
That usually works.

547
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:51,779
Watch out. Be careful.
We are very small.

548
00:54:04,936 --> 00:54:09,771
Me say it before, me say it again.
Yellow Bellies sure like berries.

549
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,347
Well, me not hungry anyway.

550
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:35,176
You want me wake them up?

551
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,579
They are sure not keeping
their eyes and ears open now.

552
00:54:38,603 --> 00:54:39,968
No, no, no.

553
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:44,074
What's wrong?

554
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,689
I thought I could teach
them our Wisdoms,

555
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:52,171
but instead I'm starting to
think like a Yellow Belly.

556
00:54:55,654 --> 00:54:57,281
I'm all mixed up.

557
00:55:00,058 --> 00:55:02,754
Maybe they don't
really need us at all.

558
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:21,322
<i>Sometimes you think
you know what's right</i>

559
00:55:21,346 --> 00:55:24,925
<i>Then somebody comes along</i>

560
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:28,963
<i>and they show you
what you thought was right</i>

561
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:33,401
<i>might be a little bit wrong</i>

562
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:36,370
<i>Things can look so different</i>

563
00:55:36,394 --> 00:55:40,374
<i>from someone else's side</i>

564
00:55:40,398 --> 00:55:43,944
<i>You're half as smart
as you thought you were</i>

565
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:48,215
<i>And the world seems
twice as wide</i>

566
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,919
<i>How do you know
who to listen to?</i>

567
00:55:51,943 --> 00:55:55,356
<i>How do you know what to think?</i>

568
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,660
<i>When you see it
through someone else's eyes</i>

569
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:02,997
<i>things can change in a blink</i>

570
00:56:03,021 --> 00:56:06,967
<i>Do you hold on to
the rules you've learned?</i>

571
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:10,927
<i>Or do you let them go?</i>

572
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:15,576
<i>When everything's a muddle</i>

573
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,091
<i>how do you know?</i>

574
00:56:24,409 --> 00:56:28,389
<i>Whenever me feel all fuzzied up</i>

575
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:31,859
<i>me go and find me mummy</i>

576
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:35,830
<i>She always ask me what me feel</i>

577
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:39,967
<i>way down deep in me tummy</i>

578
00:56:39,991 --> 00:56:42,937
<i>She say if me listen hard</i>

579
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:46,841
<i>me can hear a voice inside</i>

580
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:50,778
<i>But what if it's a grumpy voice?</i>

581
00:56:50,802 --> 00:56:54,215
<i>It still can be your guide</i>

582
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,686
<i>That is how you know
who to listen to</i>

583
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,022
<i>each and every day</i>

584
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:06,060
<i>You can use your head
and your tummy, too</i>

585
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:09,930
<i>to help you find your way</i>

586
00:57:09,954 --> 00:57:13,267
<i>Keep your eyes
and ears open wide</i>

587
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:17,819
<i>and they'll show you where to go</i>

588
00:57:19,164 --> 00:57:21,308
<i>If you trust your eyes</i>

589
00:57:21,332 --> 00:57:23,411
<i>Trust your tummy</i>

590
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:26,280
<i>Trust yourself</i>

591
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:27,848
<i>That's how you know</i>

592
00:57:27,872 --> 00:57:29,316
<i>That's how you know
who to listen to</i>

593
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,051
<i>That's how you know</i>

594
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:33,854
<i>That's how you know
who to listen to</i>

595
00:57:33,878 --> 00:57:37,625
<i>That's how you know</i>

596
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:42,916
<i>That's how you know</i>

597
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:07,633
Hey! What are you doing?
Stop, you guys!

598
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,107
Stay in a group!

599
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,680
Littlefoot, what do we do now?

600
00:58:17,388 --> 00:58:21,449
We better get to higher ground!
Round them up, Foobie!

601
00:58:51,356 --> 00:58:53,067
Oh, this was a bad idea.

602
00:58:53,091 --> 00:58:55,803
What if a lot of sky water
starts coming down?

603
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:58,272
We could slide
right off the trail.

604
00:58:58,296 --> 00:59:01,356
Should we stay in a group
and all go back down?

605
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:04,378
I don't know what the Wisdom is.

606
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:06,947
Stop worrying about the Wisdom!

607
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:08,962
Just do what they do.

608
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:12,453
Feel it!

609
00:59:12,477 --> 00:59:14,069
Do you think so?

610
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:21,629
Well, we're almost to the top.

611
00:59:21,653 --> 00:59:25,900
Maybe there's a flat place up there where
we can wait until the sky water stops.

612
00:59:25,924 --> 00:59:27,414
Then, let's go.

613
00:59:52,717 --> 00:59:53,877
Ducky!

614
01:00:01,426 --> 01:00:03,394
Keep eyes and ears open!

615
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:06,527
If you say so, Petrie.

616
01:00:16,441 --> 01:00:17,669
Oh, no.

617
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:27,544
This way, or that way?

618
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:31,818
This way!

619
01:00:57,682 --> 01:00:59,081
Over there.

620
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:23,730
That not funny!

621
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:03,705
Hey, look.

622
01:02:05,149 --> 01:02:08,516
You can come out now.
The sky water's stopped.

623
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:13,287
Watch out!

624
01:02:29,474 --> 01:02:33,672
I do not ever want to do that again.
Nope, nope, nope.

625
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:42,614
Hey, where's Doofah?

626
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:48,458
I don't know.

627
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:50,655
Anybody see Doofah?

628
01:03:02,874 --> 01:03:04,671
I hear her. Come on!

629
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,385
This way!

630
01:03:39,977 --> 01:03:41,239
Oh, no!

631
01:03:42,346 --> 01:03:43,574
Doofah!

632
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:46,143
Hi! Out for a walk?

633
01:03:46,717 --> 01:03:49,277
We were supposed to
stay in a group!

634
01:03:50,621 --> 01:03:52,213
Sounds like fun!

635
01:03:52,623 --> 01:03:54,420
She always says that.

636
01:03:59,363 --> 01:04:00,557
Doofah!

637
01:04:01,265 --> 01:04:03,177
You've got to jump!

638
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:04,545
I got to what?

639
01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:06,537
You've got to jump!

640
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:13,402
Jump! Jump now!

641
01:04:43,407 --> 01:04:44,897
Way to feel it.

642
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,517
I get it now.
"Stay in a group!"

643
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:59,250
Like they're doing!

644
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:23,274
I'm coming, Doofah!

645
01:05:32,823 --> 01:05:36,122
Like my dad always says,
"Bump them with your horn!"

646
01:05:36,894 --> 01:05:39,506
"And keep eyes
and ears open!"

647
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,997
Yup, yup, yup!

648
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:23,131
Remember, everybody!
"Stay in a group!"

649
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:29,045
Littlefoot, you've got the Wisdoms!
What do we do now?

650
01:06:34,218 --> 01:06:37,119
Well, ground's too hard
to act like a bush.

651
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,051
What do you feel like doing,
Foobie?

652
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:55,564
Great idea, Foobie.
Everybody, sing!

653
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:07,394
I got it!

654
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:11,047
"Stop worrying about tomorrow,
come on and dance!"

655
01:07:24,935 --> 01:07:26,459
Looks like fun!

656
01:07:57,268 --> 01:08:00,203
What do you know?
They're still in a group!

657
01:08:11,982 --> 01:08:14,473
Littlefoot,
which way do we go now?

658
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,688
This is just
a suggestion, but...

659
01:08:24,095 --> 01:08:25,153
Huh?

660
01:08:53,657 --> 01:08:55,215
Berry Valley!

661
01:08:57,661 --> 01:09:00,960
It smells beautiful.

662
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,730
Great job, Foobie.
You found it!

663
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:10,383
That's why they call him
the Wise One.

664
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:11,465
Huh?

665
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:14,070
Come on, let's go.

666
01:09:14,578 --> 01:09:16,808
He's the Wise One?

667
01:09:17,381 --> 01:09:18,746
I guess so!

668
01:09:28,459 --> 01:09:30,324
You found your valley.

669
01:09:31,695 --> 01:09:34,186
Actually, you found it, too.

670
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:37,865
He's right.
You brought us here.

671
01:09:39,937 --> 01:09:43,429
You know, that's true.
We did it!

672
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:47,238
Does that mean
we can go home now?

673
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:50,773
Yes, I think we can.

674
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:53,927
Bye!
Bye!

675
01:09:53,951 --> 01:09:55,562
Bye!
Bye!

676
01:09:55,586 --> 01:09:56,763
Bye!

677
01:09:56,787 --> 01:09:58,465
See you later. Bye-bye.
Bye!

678
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:00,167
Bye!
Bye!

679
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,902
You're beautiful!

680
01:10:01,926 --> 01:10:04,037
Bye!
See you later. Bye-bye.

681
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:05,705
See you later!
Bye, guys!

682
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:07,492
See you!
Good luck!

683
01:10:08,632 --> 01:10:13,626
Do you think they will make it okay?
They still do not have any Wisdoms.

684
01:10:14,305 --> 01:10:17,172
Actually, Ducky,
they always did.

685
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:20,605
And now, they've got ours, too.

686
01:10:21,712 --> 01:10:25,671
You know, I think
it takes a little bit of both.

687
01:10:26,951 --> 01:10:31,320
I can't believe it! A Longneck
just learned something!

688
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:36,517
Yeah. I just wish I knew how to
get back to the Great Valley.

689
01:10:37,394 --> 01:10:39,954
We'll find it.
We always do.

690
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:48,236
I don't remember
coming this way.

691
01:10:48,872 --> 01:10:52,308
I feel it's a shortcut.
It should get us home faster.

692
01:10:53,978 --> 01:10:57,573
Oh, good. It means our folks
start yelling even sooner.

693
01:11:00,818 --> 01:11:02,149
What that?

694
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:09,281
What's that?

695
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:18,691
There you are!

696
01:11:20,437 --> 01:11:22,882
We were so worried!

697
01:11:22,906 --> 01:11:24,317
Mama!
Hi, Mom!

698
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:25,986
Daddy!
Cera.

699
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,053
Grandma!

700
01:11:27,077 --> 01:11:28,635
Littlefoot!

701
01:11:31,282 --> 01:11:33,477
Where have you children been?

702
01:11:34,518 --> 01:11:36,213
It's a long story.

703
01:11:37,187 --> 01:11:38,711
But we're okay.

704
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:42,702
And we followed all the Wisdoms!
We stayed in a group!

705
01:11:42,726 --> 01:11:45,005
I bumped somebody with my horn!

706
01:11:45,029 --> 01:11:47,589
And me kept
eyes and ears open, too!

707
01:11:48,866 --> 01:11:51,960
But you forgot
the most important Wisdom.

708
01:11:53,203 --> 01:11:55,603
Stay in the Great Valley.

709
01:11:57,474 --> 01:12:01,240
We have trouble with that one.
Yup, yup, yup.

710
01:12:04,915 --> 01:12:07,327
<i>In their journey
to Berry Valley,</i>

711
01:12:07,351 --> 01:12:12,846
<i>the young dinosaurs had discovered that
wisdom came in many different forms.</i>

712
01:12:13,824 --> 01:12:18,571
<i>And they knew that more lessons
lay before them as they grew</i>

713
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:20,563
<i>in the land before time.</i>
