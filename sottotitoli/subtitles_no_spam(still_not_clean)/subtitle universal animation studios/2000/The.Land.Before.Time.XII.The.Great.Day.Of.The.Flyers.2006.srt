1
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:43,552
<i>Our world has been
in existence for billions of years,</i>

2
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:48,307
<i>and in all that time,
it has gone through many changes,</i>

3
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,434
<i>both big and small.</i>

4
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,445
<i>Continents grow and move.</i>

5
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,994
<i>Temperatures rise to steamy hot</i>

6
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:14,500
<i>and fall,</i>

7
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:19,004
<i>turning the Earth
into a world of snow and ice.</i>

8
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:26,220
<i>Species of animals come, flourish</i>

9
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,682
<i>and go.</i>

10
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:40,359
<i>Yes, the Earth is very
different than it was</i>

11
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,237
<i>in the days of the dinosaurs.</i>

12
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,888
<i>But one thing that has remained the same
since the time of the dinosaurs</i>

13
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,810
<i>is the fact
that everything is always changing.</i>

14
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:29,074
Do you see anything yet, Ducky?

15
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,871
I do not see anything at all.
Nope, nope, nope.

16
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:41,253
I mean, yup, yup, yup. I do.
I do see something at all.

17
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,839
Watch it!

18
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,424
Spike!

19
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:54,308
You know I do not like it
when I get bumped off of things.

20
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,067
And now I do not see
what I think I saw before.

21
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:09,281
Hey! I wonder where Cera is.
She should have been here by now.

22
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,918
Hey, Tria, what are you doing?

23
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,258
Isn't it beautiful?

24
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:31,720
You planning to stare
at it till it hatches?

25
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,682
Hey, I can if I want to.

26
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:37,810
I know. I know.

27
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:41,313
Oh, Toppsie.

28
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,984
Who do you think it's gonna look like,
you or me?

29
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:46,694
You, I hope.

30
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:49,530
Well, yeah, me, too.

31
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:57,121
Is it okay if I go meet Littlefoot
and the others?

32
00:03:57,162 --> 00:04:00,124
We wanna watch Petrie practice
for the Day of the Flyers.

33
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:07,131
I said, I'm gonna go find my friends.

34
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,509
Do you think it's cold?

35
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:13,387
Do you think it needs more grass on top?

36
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,472
No, it's fine.

37
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,644
I think it's cold. Come on.

38
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:27,443
- Tria, I really don't…
- Toppsie, did you lay this egg?

39
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:33,073
- No, but I was…
- Then hush up and help me.

40
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,204
So bye!

41
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,878
I'm heading out to the Mysterious Beyond
to see if I can get eaten by a sharptooth.

42
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:49,173
- Okay, don't be late.
- Have fun.

43
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:55,304
I think it's too warm.

44
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,187
Did I miss anything?

45
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:06,190
Not yet, and we've been
looking ever since…

46
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,944
Hey, there they are.

47
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,071
Oh, yeah, I see them.

48
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,784
I see them, too. I even see Petrie.

49
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,286
Yeah, and he's doing great.

50
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,250
Me doing great.

51
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,963
Me keeping up,
staying in line just like me supposed to.

52
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,477
Hey, me see friends.

53
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,691
Yoo-hoo, Littlefoot, I…

54
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:53,112
- Watch it, Petrie.
- Me sorry.

55
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:56,657
Me really sorry.

56
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,285
Petrie, no!

57
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:02,162
Petrie!

58
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,794
Are they doing that on purpose?

59
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:13,882
I don't think so.

60
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,659
Don't eat me, Mr. Clubtail!

61
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:48,834
Can't a fellow have a simple snack

62
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,671
without a bunch of little beakheads
falling out of the sky on him?

63
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:09,021
Hey, everybody.

64
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,608
That's some landing, huh?

65
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,697
Now he's really in trouble.

66
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:22,242
- Oh, Mom's here.
- Now you're really gonna get it.

67
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,203
- You're gonna get it now, Petrie.
- I'm telling her.

68
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,288
I'm gonna tell her all about it.

69
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,379
Oh, Petrie, not again.

70
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,427
We better go.

71
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,972
- Why did you do that?
- You don't know how to fly.

72
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,890
You just bump into everybody.

73
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:55,234
- Grandpa?
- Yes, Littlefoot?

74
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,902
We were watching Petrie today

75
00:07:56,986 --> 00:08:00,197
flying with his brothers and sisters
to get ready for the Day of the Flyers.

76
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:04,743
Yes, I heard all about it from Mr.
Clubtail.

77
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,038
Why is the Day of the Flyers
so important anyway?

78
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,582
Why does Petrie's family
get so upset about it?

79
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:14,753
Well, Littlefoot, every
herd has its traditions,

80
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,215
ways to mark the path
from being a young one

81
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:20,092
to becoming a grownup.

82
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,636
And so it is with the flyers.

83
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:29,310
For them, the Day of the Flyers
is a chance for young ones

84
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,228
to show their elders

85
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,106
that they have learned
how to fly with the herd,

86
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:37,610
that they're ready
to take their places up in the sky.

87
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:39,403
Well, it's not fair.

88
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,447
Petrie's a great flyer.

89
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,949
He just has problems
being bunched up in a group,

90
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,327
especially with his brothers and sisters.

91
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,704
I think they make him nervous.

92
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:52,583
I'm sure Petrie will do just fine.

93
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:58,297
- Petrie, you'll never get it right.
- Yeah, you don't pay attention.

94
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,966
You flap your wings at the wrong time.

95
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,511
You go up when we go down.
You go down when we go up.

96
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,639
You're hopeless!

97
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:09,767
Hush, now. That's enough. Go on. Scoot.

98
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,810
I want to talk to Petrie alone.

99
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:13,062
- Okay, Mom.
- Goodnight, Mom.

100
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,397
- Night.
- See you in the morning.

101
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:18,525
Petrie, what is the problem?

102
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:23,072
You can be a good flyer when you try.
I've seen you.

103
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,617
Why can't you fly
with your brothers and sisters?

104
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,786
Me no know.

105
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,247
The Day of the Flyers will be here
before you know it,

106
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,750
and they're all counting
on you to be ready.

107
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,002
Will you be?

108
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,505
Petrie?

109
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,093
Me try me best, okay?

110
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,185
I know you will. You always do.

111
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:56,021
- Goodnight, Petrie.
- Night, Mom.

112
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:00,776
They think me never do nothing right.

113
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:04,446
Sometimes me wish
me had a whole nother family.

114
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,451
Hey! What was that for?

115
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,496
You were about to roll onto the egg.

116
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,003
I was not.

117
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,631
How do you know? You were asleep.

118
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,717
Scoot over.

119
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:10,220
More.

120
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:13,307
Oh, honey, come on.

121
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:16,393
Keep going, Toppsie,
you're a restless sleeper.

122
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:18,729
I don't want to take a chance.

123
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,482
Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, Tria.

124
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,526
So how's this?

125
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:28,113
A little more. Better safe than sorry.

126
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,664
Yeah, goodnight, Cera.

127
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:43,045
Just a little bit more.

128
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:52,137
Perfect.

129
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,938
Yeah, they say
me no know how to fly.

130
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:04,775
Well, I do not care
what everybody else says, Petrie.

131
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,652
I think you are a good flyer.

132
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,195
Yup, yup, yup.

133
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:10,614
What?

134
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:14,868
Thanks, me think.

135
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,622
What she means is we all know you can fly.

136
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:22,126
You're really good, when
you're by yourself.

137
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:27,089
That just it. Me good alone.

138
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:29,717
Not so good with family.

139
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:32,261
Join the club.

140
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:34,763
Huh?

141
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:42,187
So, Petrie, when you're up there
with your brothers and sisters,

142
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,315
just remember how good you really are.

143
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:47,109
Just tell yourself you can do anything.

144
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:49,486
Me can do anything.

145
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,572
Me can do anything.

146
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:53,782
Me can do anything!

147
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,284
That's right.

148
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,871
Except fly through sky puffies.
Me really hate that.

149
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,959
- Well, maybe you will not have to.
- Maybe not!

150
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,379
Me also not too good at wind flying.

151
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,590
Well, it's a windy day today.

152
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:12,217
Great time to practice. We'll watch.

153
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,473
Okay.

154
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:29,234
Hey, me doing okay!

155
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:34,698
Petrie, we're coming!

156
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,753
That didn't sound like Petrie.

157
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:52,091
Petrie, you okay?

158
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,933
What's in there?

159
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,559
Is it a sharptooth?

160
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,191
Littlefoot, who screamed? Is everyone okay?

161
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:29,128
Sorry. Did I scare you?

162
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,547
I have that affect on folks sometimes.

163
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,719
Okay, I…

164
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:40,097
I guess you're all wondering
why I asked you here, huh?

165
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:42,641
You're all wondering…

166
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:47,271
All right, who's making all the racket?

167
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,442
Yeah, that would be me. Hi.

168
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,944
I'm really sorry if you were disturbed.

169
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,655
Not that anyone's saying you're disturbed,
least of all me.

170
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,533
I mean, you know,
in the sense of being not all there.

171
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:01,619
You're obviously all there.

172
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,996
I mean, just look at you. You're…

173
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:09,168
I don't know who or what you are,

174
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,629
but we don't like noise around here.

175
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,340
Some of us are trying to hatch eggs.

176
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:18,969
Oh! I mean,
oh, I'm sorry, lady. I didn't realize.

177
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:21,972
Not me.

178
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,227
Out of my way.

179
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:32,691
I wouldn't go that way if I were you. I…

180
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,985
Well, you're not me.

181
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,202
Daddy, are you okay?

182
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:05,557
Okay, okay.

183
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:13,023
Just what we need.

184
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,109
Another weirdo.

185
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:20,739
I just wish Grandma
had been here to see it.

186
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:28,831
Why did you do that?

187
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,916
Saved him the trouble of pushing me in.

188
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,420
- Hey, watch it.
- Oh, yuck.

189
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:40,634
So what do you call this place anyway?

190
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:43,721
The Great Valley. Where'd you come from?

191
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:46,765
I'm not sure.

192
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,269
Well, how did you get here?

193
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:53,522
Not sure about that, either.

194
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,775
I just sort of woke up,
and, you know, here I was.

195
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:01,405
Well, here's an easy one. What's your name?

196
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:04,199
They call me Guido.

197
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:06,118
Who does?

198
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,579
I'm not sure.

199
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:12,166
Well, don't you have a family or a herd?

200
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,171
No, sorry.

201
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:21,425
Actually, you may not believe this,

202
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:25,387
but I'm the only one
like me I've ever seen.

203
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,808
Oh, I believe it. Yup, yup, yup.

204
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:33,812
That would be so strange,
being the only one like you.

205
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:37,107
Just think of it, the only one.

206
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:42,154
Just me, the only flyer.

207
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:54,333
<i>One of a kind</i>

208
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,502
<i>Me think me like to be</i>

209
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,253
<i>One of a kind</i>

210
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:02,174
<i>It very nice to be the only me</i>

211
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,385
<i>Up in the sky</i>

212
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,595
<i>Flap when me wanna flap</i>

213
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,722
<i>Fly when me wanna fly</i>

214
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:12,226
<i>It would be fine as can be</i>

215
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,355
<i>If the other flyers didn't laugh at me</i>

216
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:20,567
<i>And so me think me wouldn't mind</i>

217
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:24,863
<i>If me were the only one of a kind</i>

218
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:31,412
<i>One, one, one, one</i>

219
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:34,123
<i>One of a kind</i>

220
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,000
<i>I used to love to be</i>

221
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,127
<i>One of a kind</i>

222
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,047
<i>But it's too late to be the special one</i>

223
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:44,216
<i>'Cause now that there's two</i>

224
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,592
<i>Dad doesn't notice</i>

225
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:48,304
<i>One thing that I say or do</i>

226
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:50,306
<i>Doesn't he know?</i>

227
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:52,641
<i>Can't he see?</i>

228
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:56,312
<i>The best threehorn in the valley is me</i>

229
00:18:56,395 --> 00:19:00,399
<i>You know, I really wouldn't mind</i>

230
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:04,570
<i>If I could go back to being one of a kind</i>

231
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,406
But Cera,

232
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,533
<i>No one else is special</i>

233
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,160
<i>Just like you</i>

234
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:14,413
<i>Oh, no, no one can take your place</i>

235
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:17,583
<i>And, Petrie, no one makes me laugh</i>

236
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,209
<i>The way you do</i>

237
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:21,587
<i>With your squeakily voice</i>

238
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,464
- Squeak!
- Squeak!

239
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:27,092
<i>And your smiley face</i>

240
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,931
<i>One, one, one, one</i>

241
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:35,434
Hey, guys, you just don't know
how good you've got it.

242
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,145
<i>One of a kind</i>

243
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:39,647
<i>It can be lonely</i>

244
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,899
<i>When you're one of a kind</i>

245
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:45,945
<i>You think if only you had brothers around</i>

246
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,030
<i>Who feel like you do</i>

247
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,907
<i>With prickly sticker things</i>

248
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:52,284
<i>All over them, too</i>

249
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,286
<i>Sharing a nest</i>

250
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,372
<i>Giving advice</i>

251
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:58,165
<i>Being a family</i>

252
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,417
<i>Oh, that would be nice</i>

253
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,129
<i>To leave that single life behind</i>

254
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,757
<i>And be more than just one of a</i>

255
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,634
<i>Maybe two of a</i>

256
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:10,552
<i>How about four of a</i>

257
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:12,638
<i>It could be six of a</i>

258
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:13,764
<i>One of a</i>

259
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:14,848
<i>One of a</i>

260
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:15,975
<i>One of a</i>

261
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:17,559
<i>One of a kind</i>

262
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:21,730
<i>One, one, one, one</i>

263
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:23,816
<i>One, one</i>

264
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,818
<i>One of a kind</i>

265
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:31,615
You know, Guido,
maybe you're not the only one like you.

266
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,742
Really? What do you mean?

267
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:37,162
I mean, who knows what you look like
under all those…

268
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:39,665
Those… What do you call them?

269
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,795
- Beats me.
- Doesn't matter.

270
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:48,924
I was just thinking.
Your neck looks kind of long like mine.

271
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:53,053
And your face is sort
of sharp like Petrie's.

272
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:54,388
And you know what?

273
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:58,225
Those stickly things could all be
kind of like a whole lot of little horns,

274
00:20:58,309 --> 00:20:59,852
sort of like Cera's.

275
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,274
Maybe.

276
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,696
Well, I say we try to find Guido a family,

277
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:14,283
or at least a herd,
right here in the Great Valley.

278
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:16,201
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

279
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:21,874
Well, there's a reason
we have such long necks.

280
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:26,712
It's because we like to eat
the tenderest, newest tree stars

281
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,088
way up here.

282
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:30,841
Go on. Take a bite and pull.

283
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:41,560
Come on, Guido. You can do it.

284
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,418
What you think, you a longneck?

285
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:11,757
I don't think so.

286
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:19,556
Well, let's just see now.

287
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:22,685
I got a tail. You got a tail?

288
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:27,648
Oh, yes, sir, one tail right here.

289
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:32,027
Well, at the end of my tail I got a bopper.

290
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,904
You got a bopper?

291
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:39,910
Maybe. What is a bopper?

292
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:43,038
That's a bopper.

293
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:46,542
Thanks anyway, Mr. Clubtail.

294
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:51,630
Don't even think about it.

295
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,685
And then you just paddle with your feet.

296
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:07,563
It is simple.

297
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:12,568
I gotta tell you, I have a real problem
with swimming where I drink.

298
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,988
It just doesn't seem right.

299
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:19,325
Give it a try. You will be fine.
Yup, yup, yup.

300
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:25,122
Wait, wait. And you're sure
there's nothing in there that bites?

301
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:26,832
I am pretty sure.

302
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,336
Bad answer.

303
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,551
I've just decided I'm not a swimmer.

304
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:40,763
Hey, there's Petrie.

305
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:46,644
Okay, everybody, let's dive.

306
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:52,733
Go down when they go down.

307
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,986
And now we fly!

308
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,115
Go up when they go up.

309
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,750
- He's doing okay.
- So far.

310
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,964
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

311
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:19,551
This not so bad.
Just like playing follow-the-leader.

312
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,428
Me do what he do.

313
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:29,311
Sky puffies ahead! We're going through!

314
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,148
Sky puffies? Oh, me no do that.

315
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,236
We no wanna do this.

316
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,239
Me say we go around. It not too late.

317
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:43,075
Come on, fellows! Go around! Go around!

318
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,119
Roll!

319
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:52,751
- No!
- Oh, no!

320
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:58,173
Strange weather we're having today.

321
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:06,140
Oh, Petrie, there you are.

322
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:09,685
Hi.

323
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:12,479
Everybody's looking for you.

324
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:16,108
Me not know why. Me mess up everything.

325
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:18,736
Me worst flyer in valley.

326
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:22,823
Hey, come on,
don't say things like that about yourself.

327
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:26,118
Me not say it. Brothers and sisters did.

328
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:29,330
They're mad, huh?

329
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:33,250
Really mad and with really bumpy heads.

330
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:34,793
Yeah.

331
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:38,714
Well, I thought that roll you did up there
was really good.

332
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:42,968
You know, I mean, it was excellent,
beautifully spectacular.

333
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:45,012
Good if me alone maybe.

334
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,099
But whole point of Day of the Flyers
is to fit in with others.

335
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,604
Me just not fit in.

336
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:56,815
You think you don't fit in.

337
00:25:56,857 --> 00:26:01,153
Look at me. I can't swim.
I can't bop folks with my tail.

338
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,405
Petrie, I can't even chew.

339
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:05,824
I don't fit in anywhere.

340
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:11,121
Hey! Maybe you fit in with us flyers.

341
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,540
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Are you kidding?

342
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:16,669
I can't chew, and you
want me to try flying?

343
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,379
You no have to fly.

344
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:21,173
Me just thought, well…

345
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:23,175
Oh, I get it.

346
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:28,055
You figure if I'm living with your family,
maybe the two of us can not fit in together.

347
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:29,974
Well, yeah.

348
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:33,519
Okay, I'll give it a try.

349
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,812
Hey, guys.

350
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:37,147
Here you guys are.

351
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:38,315
Is anything wrong?

352
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:40,317
Tria's egg is about to hatch.

353
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,902
Wow, let's go.

354
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,949
Let's go see the hatchling.

355
00:26:47,032 --> 00:26:48,951
- Come on.
- Is it time yet?

356
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:50,703
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:12,391
Toppsie, here it comes.

358
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,865
Aw!

359
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:41,712
Seems to be fine.

360
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:46,258
She's perfect.

361
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:57,102
Go on, Cera. Meet your new sister.

362
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,956
Who fell over? Who fell over?
Who fell over?

363
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:18,874
You're okay.

364
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,293
That's right.

365
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:24,171
What a brave girl.

366
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,548
Don't mind me.

367
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:39,061
Cute hatchling.

368
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:42,398
- What?
- Me say nothing.

369
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:45,192
That's what I thought.

370
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:57,162
I want some. I want some.
I'm hungry, Mom.

371
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:58,831
I want one.
Come on, me next. Me! Me!

372
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:00,165
I want some. I want some.

373
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,001
Well, is it true?

374
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:05,254
Does the Threehorn family
have a new addition?

375
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:06,630
Yup.

376
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,924
And so do we.

377
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:17,600
Petrie, I'm usually the one
who makes that announcement.

378
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,852
Not this time!

379
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,813
Everybody, meet Guido!

380
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:24,898
Okay.

381
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:33,699
Wow! This is higher than it looks.

382
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:37,536
- Who is it?
- What is it?

383
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:49,381
Looks like a flower.

384
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,551
Looks like a whole bunch of flowers.

385
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:58,599
Good one. Oh, yeah, funny.

386
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,063
Doesn't smell like a flower, though.

387
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:07,775
What do you call these things?

388
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:09,777
I used to call them part of me!

389
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,489
Kids, he's our guest. Leave him alone.

390
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,911
We've been wanting
to talk to you anyway, Petrie.

391
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:21,038
Yeah, about what happened today.

392
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,582
Yeah, you messed up again, Petrie.

393
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:24,750
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

394
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:28,963
- Yeah, like you always do.
- Yeah, what's your problem, Petrie?

395
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:30,422
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

396
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:31,548
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

397
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,675
Yeah!

398
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:34,885
Fellows, come on, give him a break.

399
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:38,764
I mean, of course he gets confused
when he flies with you.

400
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:41,058
Your rear ends look just like your faces,

401
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,727
so how can he tell which way to go?

402
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:54,655
Okay, children, sleep time.

403
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,949
You're all right, Guido.

404
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:03,664
Go to sleep, Petrie. Goodnight, Guido.

405
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,042
We're glad you could come visit.

406
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,212
- Night, Mom.
- Yeah, thanks, night.

407
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:15,884
- Night, Guido.
- Night, Petrie.

408
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:18,929
Hey, Petrie.

409
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:25,394
I know absolutely nothing about flying,
and I generally goof up everything I try,

410
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:28,689
but I'm gonna help you get ready
for the Day of the Flyers.

411
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,524
What do you think about that?

412
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:33,944
Okay, great.

413
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:35,904
Night, Guido.

414
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:48,667
Who's my pretty girl?
Tricia's my pretty girl.

415
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,169
Yes, she is.

416
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,760
Oh, Cera?

417
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:02,681
Yes, Tria?

418
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:06,685
Could you watch Tricia for me?
Just for a bit. I won't be long.

419
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,521
- Okay, sure.
- Thanks, sweetie.

420
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:12,191
You stay right here with Cera.

421
00:32:12,274 --> 00:32:15,277
Mommy's gonna be right back.

422
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:20,157
Don't try the cute thing on me.
It won't work.

423
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,701
Better watch where you're going.

424
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:39,551
Okay, you stood up. Big deal.

425
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:45,015
Good job, you little goofy-woofus.

426
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:52,898
Oh, no you don't. Come back here.

427
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:57,903
Didn't you hear your mom?
You're supposed to stay with me.

428
00:32:57,945 --> 00:33:00,739
Tricia, no. Bad girl.

429
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,828
You're gonna get me in trouble.

430
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:23,429
- What happened?
- She was running away,

431
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:27,683
so I picked her up on my nose horn,
and she poked me in the eye and I fell.

432
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,393
She was running?

433
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:34,732
What a smart girl. What a big girl.

434
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:36,609
What's going on?

435
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:39,737
Tricia was running.

436
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:45,743
No, and I missed it.

437
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:49,413
Oh, I can't believe she's running already.

438
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:57,296
Toppsie, she is so advanced.
Wait until I tell Mrs. Twoped.

439
00:33:57,379 --> 00:34:01,133
Well, let's face it.
She's the best hatchling that ever was.

440
00:34:03,052 --> 00:34:07,514
- Yup, she's just like her dad.
- Oh, look at her.

441
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:11,226
Hey, don't worry about me. I'm fine.

442
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,650
Thanks for watching Tricia!

443
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,332
I hope he is happy with Petrie's family,

444
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,211
but I do not understand
why you would wanna be a flyer

445
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:39,546
when you could be a swimmer instead.

446
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,468
I don't know, Ducky.

447
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,179
I think Petrie
really wanted somebody on his side

448
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:49,848
the next time his brothers and sisters
yell at him.

449
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:56,105
I do not blame him.
They are really loud yellers.

450
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:05,114
Spike!

451
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:24,049
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

452
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:32,224
- Where's Ducky?
- I am down here.

453
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:34,393
What are you doing under a bush?

454
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,937
Oh, just resting.

455
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:40,190
Are you okay, Cera? You look upset.

456
00:35:40,524 --> 00:35:43,027
What have I got to be upset about?

457
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,447
Except that my Dad and Tria love Tricia
and ignore me.

458
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,576
My horn could fall right off my nose,
and they wouldn't even notice.

459
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,161
Cera!

460
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:56,749
If we're going to keep talking about this,
would you please move?

461
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,250
Oh, sorry.

462
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:03,047
Hey, listen, at least your dad's with you.

463
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:05,215
And Tria seems really nice.

464
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:07,134
Yeah, I guess she is.

465
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,433
And you do not have little itchy scratches
all over you.

466
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,810
Hey, I said I was sorry.

467
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:24,193
I like my family and all. It's just that,
well, why do things always have to change?

468
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:39,625
<i>Just when your life is perfect</i>

469
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,004
<i>Everything's looking bright</i>

470
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:48,968
<i>You're with your friends till daylight ends</i>

471
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:52,763
<i>And safe in your nest at night</i>

472
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:56,976
<i>Then you get this funny feeling</i>

473
00:36:57,476 --> 00:37:01,188
<i>That something is just not right</i>

474
00:37:01,272 --> 00:37:07,653
<i>And all at once, things change</i>

475
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:16,870
<i>All at once, things change</i>

476
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,834
<i>I used to be important</i>

477
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:26,130
<i>Until that egg was there</i>

478
00:37:27,423 --> 00:37:30,634
<i>Although I know Dad loves me</i>

479
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:34,805
<i>Seems like he forgot to care</i>

480
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:39,310
<i>I thought we were a family</i>

481
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:43,063
<i>But it's really so unfair</i>

482
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:50,029
<i>When all at once, things change</i>

483
00:37:52,698 --> 00:37:54,575
<i>Families grow</i>

484
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:56,869
<i>Grownups you know</i>

485
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:59,997
<i>Turn into someone new</i>

486
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:05,085
<i>You try to keep things like they are</i>

487
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:10,799
<i>But you wind up changing, too</i>

488
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,228
<i>Maybe a baby threehorn</i>

489
00:38:24,063 --> 00:38:26,941
<i>Will not be so bad at all</i>

490
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:29,902
<i>You can teach her to talk</i>

491
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:32,071
<i>To roll a rock</i>

492
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:36,241
<i>And catch her if she starts to fall</i>

493
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:40,079
<i>Maybe things will be better</i>

494
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:44,833
<i>Than you ever thought they could</i>

495
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:51,632
<i>And maybe when things change</i>

496
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:53,884
<i>Maybe when things change</i>

497
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:59,765
<i>Oh, maybe when things change</i>

498
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:07,690
<i>They will change into something good</i>

499
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:25,582
Okay, now, remember, Petrie,
you can do anything they can do, all right?

500
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,752
It's just a matter of doing it
at the same time.

501
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:30,838
Yeah, at the same time.

502
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:33,340
So just keep telling yourself,

503
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:39,346
"I fly along with all the rest.
I'm going to pass my flying test."

504
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,265
Go ahead, say it.

505
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:47,605
Me fly along with all the rest.
Me gonna pass the flying test.

506
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,356
Like that?

507
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:52,318
Yeah, close enough.

508
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:29,790
Tricia, Mommy's home.

509
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:44,847
That's right. Go, Petrie. Go.

510
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:18,922
And now, we land.

511
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:27,306
You can do it, Petrie.
Just watch me.

512
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:32,144
That's it. Flaps down. Nose up.

513
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:36,523
Yes!

514
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:39,068
All right! Go, Petrie!

515
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:41,195
- Yeah!
- All right, Petrie!

516
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:44,990
Oh, children, I am so very proud.

517
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:47,660
That was your best flight ever.

518
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,250
I never thought I'd say this,
but great job, Petrie.

519
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:59,338
- Yeah! Way to go!
- Way to go, Petrie!

520
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,382
Me had lots of help.

521
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:04,176
- Yeah!
- Petrie! Petrie!

522
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:08,597
All right, now,
I know you've all got to be very tired,

523
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:10,975
and the Day of the Flyers starts tomorrow

524
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:14,353
when the great circle
first peeks over the ridge.

525
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:17,064
Time to head home and get some sleep.

526
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:18,691
Yes, Mommy.

527
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,710
Guido, come on.

528
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:39,670
Hey, keep up with the family.

529
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:40,796
- Yeah, come on, Guido.
- Come on, Guido.

530
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,840
Come on, Guido. Hurry up.

531
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:15,998
Guido.

532
00:44:16,415 --> 00:44:18,250
Guido, what you doing?

533
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:29,219
Guido?

534
00:44:33,182 --> 00:44:35,768
Guido, how'd you get out there?

535
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:56,872
Guido.

536
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:08,217
Guido!

537
00:45:12,388 --> 00:45:14,306
Hey, Guido, stop!

538
00:45:20,729 --> 00:45:22,189
Guido, come on.

539
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,650
Me gotta get some sleep.

540
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:27,152
Me mean it.

541
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:29,530
Me got a big day tomorrow.

542
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,866
What's going on?

543
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:35,577
Where you come from?

544
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:38,289
- Right over…
- Don't do that ever again.

545
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:39,373
Sorry.

546
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:41,166
But what's happening?

547
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,835
Guido, he's…

548
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:50,175
Hey, where he go? Where he go?

549
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:52,845
There he is.

550
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:55,514
Hey, how did he do that?

551
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,685
Come on.

552
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,332
Spike, look…

553
00:46:30,382 --> 00:46:31,967
Guido come through here?

554
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:34,053
Yup, yup, yup.

555
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:36,972
We have to follow him.

556
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:39,767
He's walking around, but he's still asleep.

557
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,645
I want to come, too.

558
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:45,397
Spike, get up, get up.

559
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,196
You didn't have to wake Spike.

560
00:46:52,363 --> 00:46:55,115
Oh, he gets up about now every night
to eat anyway.

561
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:56,408
Come on.

562
00:47:02,164 --> 00:47:04,333
I know all about sleepwalking.

563
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,043
My aunty sleep-swims,

564
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:09,964
and my momma says, "Do not ever,
never wake her up when she is doing it."

565
00:47:10,047 --> 00:47:11,256
Why not?

566
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,593
That, I do not know,
but my momma is always right.

567
00:47:15,928 --> 00:47:18,889
Then I guess we better not let him wake up.

568
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:22,101
I will go get Cera.

569
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:26,272
If we have an adventure and she
is not here, she will be so mad.

570
00:47:26,313 --> 00:47:30,067
And I do not like it when Cera gets mad.
No, no, no.

571
00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:46,458
So let me get this straight.

572
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:48,711
You woke me up in the middle of the night

573
00:47:48,794 --> 00:47:53,465
so I could walk all over the valley,
watching Guido walk all over the valley.

574
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:56,427
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

575
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:11,400
Oh, no!

576
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:13,986
Guido heading to fast water.

577
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,238
Yeah? So he'll get wet.

578
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:19,325
You do not get it. He
will not just get wet.

579
00:48:19,408 --> 00:48:21,285
He will go straight down.

580
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:22,995
Glub, glub, glub.

581
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:25,706
So what are we supposed to do about it?

582
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:28,334
I got an idea, but we have to hurry.

583
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:36,008
Here he come.

584
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,344
We know. We can see him.

585
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:42,348
Guido.

586
00:48:42,598 --> 00:48:46,936
- Guido! Guido, no, stop!
- Guido, turn this way.

587
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:53,943
Walk faster.

588
00:49:03,452 --> 00:49:05,162
Hurry! Hurry!

589
00:49:06,038 --> 00:49:09,041
This is so much more fun than sleeping.

590
00:49:15,965 --> 00:49:17,549
This is no good.

591
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:20,135
He's walking toward the fire rocks.

592
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:24,556
I am not going swimming in there.

593
00:49:26,016 --> 00:49:27,977
You won't have to. Come on.

594
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:46,578
My dad always told me
not to let anyone walk all over me.

595
00:50:12,938 --> 00:50:14,023
Let me ask you,

596
00:50:14,106 --> 00:50:16,191
if we wake him up, what happens?

597
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:18,068
Something terrible.

598
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,778
Worse than this?

599
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:27,244
Me have bad feeling about this.

600
00:50:40,924 --> 00:50:42,676
We've gotta hurry.

601
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:11,246
Me never think me say this,

602
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,959
but me give anything to be threehorn
about now.

603
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,505
At least it is downhill.

604
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:27,763
Come on, everybody,

605
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:30,015
push!

606
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:36,230
Hey, it is getting easier.

607
00:51:36,772 --> 00:51:39,984
That because it moving by itself!

608
00:52:02,548 --> 00:52:04,591
We… We made it.

609
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:06,385
Yeah. Hurray.

610
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:32,077
What do we do now?

611
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,247
Well, me fly on over and keep eye on Guido.

612
00:52:35,372 --> 00:52:37,875
You guys climb over, but don't fall.

613
00:52:40,377 --> 00:52:42,254
Thanks for the advice.

614
00:52:49,345 --> 00:52:52,264
Try not to put all your weight
on one branch.

615
00:53:06,195 --> 00:53:08,656
Oh, no, it is falling.

616
00:53:08,906 --> 00:53:10,115
Perfect.

617
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:11,867
We've gotta hurry.

618
00:53:15,537 --> 00:53:17,247
Run, run, run!

619
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:18,791
Go, go, go!

620
00:53:22,544 --> 00:53:24,254
- Come on!
- Run!

621
00:53:27,925 --> 00:53:29,468
Littlefoot, jump!

622
00:53:49,863 --> 00:53:52,658
Okay, you guys lie around enough already.

623
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,618
Guido's still walking.

624
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:00,374
One more word, and you won't be walking,
not for a long time.

625
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:04,378
Me only kidding. Take your time.

626
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:07,298
Besides, me think he pretty safe now.

627
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:11,302
Guido! No! No, turn around!

628
00:54:20,644 --> 00:54:21,937
Guido, no!

629
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:48,172
Me no believe it.

630
00:54:48,213 --> 00:54:50,215
Guido a flyer!

631
00:54:50,674 --> 00:54:52,551
A sleep-flyer.

632
00:55:03,437 --> 00:55:06,231
Hey, you know what I just realized?

633
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,524
What?

634
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:10,945
We didn't have to do
that whole tree thing after all.

635
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:14,365
Sorry.

636
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:16,659
Oh, no! He heading over the top!

637
00:55:20,996 --> 00:55:23,916
But the other side's the Mysterious Beyond.

638
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,335
Me know.

639
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:29,254
This just keeps getting better and better.

640
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:31,256
Me gotta go after him.

641
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:35,177
Petrie, today
is the Day of the Flyers, remember?

642
00:55:35,427 --> 00:55:39,431
If you go to the Mysterious Beyond,
you may not get back in time.

643
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:43,686
It no matter. He friend.

644
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:45,437
Me gotta go get him.

645
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:47,564
We'll be right behind you.

646
00:55:47,606 --> 00:55:48,774
We will?

647
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:52,736
Okay, okay, we will.

648
00:56:32,985 --> 00:56:34,194
Petrie?

649
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:35,487
Guys?

650
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:40,993
Hey, where is everybody?

651
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:43,203
Okay, fellows.

652
00:56:44,038 --> 00:56:45,331
I get it.

653
00:56:45,414 --> 00:56:47,541
It's a prank, right?

654
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,627
Just trying to scare me.

655
00:56:50,961 --> 00:56:52,963
Yeah, well, good job.

656
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:56,008
You succeeded.

657
00:56:57,676 --> 00:56:59,762
Oh, great, an earthshake,

658
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:04,391
the one thing missing
to make this my scariest moment ever.

659
00:57:12,149 --> 00:57:13,692
I take that back.

660
00:57:57,069 --> 00:57:59,530
Incoming, Guido!

661
00:58:06,412 --> 00:58:08,664
You sure heavy for a little guy.

662
00:58:08,747 --> 00:58:11,750
Sorry, must be all this sharptooth spit.

663
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:27,766
Me no know how long me can keep this up.

664
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:31,604
Yeah, well, keep it up
a little longer anyway, okay?

665
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:54,126
- Oh, no!
- What is that thing?

666
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:57,046
I don't know, but it's not friendly.

667
00:59:00,758 --> 00:59:02,426
Petrie!

668
00:59:10,059 --> 00:59:13,437
Guido, me so tired.

669
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:15,814
Why you not fly yourself?

670
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,442
Are you crazy? I can't fly.

671
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:24,490
We gotta help them,

672
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,241
but we need a plan.

673
00:59:42,508 --> 00:59:44,969
Hey, I think we lost him.

674
00:59:56,021 --> 00:59:58,732
Oh, yeah, this was a good plan.

675
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:11,245
Stay with me, Guido. We going in.

676
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:13,539
Oh, yeah, like I have a choice.

677
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:22,381
Hang on!

678
01:00:34,143 --> 01:00:35,811
Come on, this way.

679
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:45,237
Petrie, hurry.

680
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,370
Guido, stick out your arms and legs, quick!

681
01:00:55,748 --> 01:00:59,501
Well, I don't get it, but okay.

682
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:16,101
Me so tired.

683
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:18,312
But you can't rest yet.

684
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:20,856
Those rocks won't stop him for long.

685
01:01:29,531 --> 01:01:30,783
Oh, I…

686
01:01:33,452 --> 01:01:37,081
Oh, sorry,
I thought you were somebody else.

687
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:08,028
All right, children, time to get up.

688
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:10,155
The big day is here.

689
01:02:18,998 --> 01:02:22,167
- Hey, where's Petrie?
- Where is he?

690
01:02:25,296 --> 01:02:28,173
Oh, me never make it.

691
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:32,511
Sure you will. The Day of the Flyers doesn't
start until the great circle appears,

692
01:02:32,553 --> 01:02:35,347
- remember?
- But we got so far to go.

693
01:02:36,098 --> 01:02:38,976
- We'll get you there.
- You just try to rest up.

694
01:02:39,018 --> 01:02:41,103
Oh, this is all my fault.

695
01:02:41,437 --> 01:02:45,649
If you hadn't come to rescue me,
you'd be home and rested and ready to go.

696
01:02:45,774 --> 01:02:48,986
And I still don't understand
how I even got there.

697
01:02:49,862 --> 01:02:51,780
You can fly!

698
01:02:53,157 --> 01:02:54,241
What?

699
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:55,743
In my sleep?

700
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:58,537
Okay, how weird do you guys think I am?

701
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:00,956
Don't get me started.

702
01:03:04,126 --> 01:03:07,463
This isn't fair.
He's gonna mess up our whole formation.

703
01:03:07,546 --> 01:03:10,049
He should have just quit a long time ago.

704
01:03:10,174 --> 01:03:12,217
Mom, what are we gonna do?

705
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:16,055
You're just going to
have to fly without him.

706
01:03:22,603 --> 01:03:24,897
Maybe me better off missing it.

707
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:28,067
Maybe me not ready, after all.

708
01:03:28,484 --> 01:03:31,487
Are you kidding?
Did you see yourself last night?

709
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,113
You're a great flyer.

710
01:03:33,238 --> 01:03:34,573
Yup, yup, yup.

711
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:36,742
You fly like nobody else.

712
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:39,703
But that the problem.

713
01:03:39,745 --> 01:03:44,750
The whole point of Day of Flyers is to show
you can fly like everybody else.

714
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:49,797
But maybe that's not
the problem. Maybe it's the solution.

715
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:53,300
Look, if there's one
thing I've had to learn,

716
01:03:53,384 --> 01:03:56,720
it's that you can't worry
about being like everybody else.

717
01:03:57,096 --> 01:03:59,515
You just have to be yourself.

718
01:03:59,932 --> 01:04:02,601
Just be Petrie, and you'll be fine.

719
01:04:03,269 --> 01:04:04,770
You think so?

720
01:04:06,814 --> 01:04:07,940
Look.

721
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:12,861
When judges get to
starting place, it starts.

722
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:14,822
If you're gonna go, go now.

723
01:04:14,905 --> 01:04:17,616
We'll get back in time to cheer for you.

724
01:04:21,787 --> 01:04:23,455
Good luck, Petrie.

725
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:04,872
It's going to start any second now.

726
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,750
So remember, since Petrie's not here…

727
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,918
Who say me not here?

728
01:05:12,338 --> 01:05:14,506
Petrie, where have you been?

729
01:05:14,632 --> 01:05:16,175
You better be ready.

730
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:18,469
Remember, do everything we do.

731
01:05:18,802 --> 01:05:20,512
Be like us.

732
01:05:21,013 --> 01:05:22,681
Me got better idea.

733
01:05:23,057 --> 01:05:24,558
Me be like me.

734
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:29,897
You'll do fine.

735
01:05:38,197 --> 01:05:39,323
Look.

736
01:05:41,742 --> 01:05:43,202
Here it comes.

737
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:48,332
All right, get ready, children.

738
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:06,433
Hey, look, it has started.

739
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:10,396
I wonder which one is Petrie.

740
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:47,850
Do you see Petrie yet?

741
01:06:48,267 --> 01:06:49,518
Not yet.

742
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:18,172
Me fly along with all the rest.

743
01:07:18,422 --> 01:07:21,508
Me gonna pass the flying test.

744
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:27,306
Me fly real good. Me fly okay.

745
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:30,267
Me gonna do it Petrie's way.

746
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:32,811
Me fly real good. Me fly okay.

747
01:07:33,145 --> 01:07:35,481
Me gonna do it Petrie's way.

748
01:07:40,986 --> 01:07:42,571
Petrie, stop that.

749
01:07:43,364 --> 01:07:46,992
Petrie, what are you up to?

750
01:07:50,454 --> 01:07:52,289
I see him. I see him.

751
01:07:56,669 --> 01:07:57,962
Up there.

752
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:03,634
What is he doing?

753
01:08:04,051 --> 01:08:06,136
I gotta get a closer look.

754
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:20,943
Good one.

755
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:24,613
Attaboy, Petrie, you're being yourself!

756
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:30,369
- This is great!
- Look at me!

757
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:31,537

758

Can I really fly?

Oh, well, one way to find out.

812
01:12:52,589 --> 01:12:53,841
Look at me!

813
01:12:53,924 --> 01:12:55,509
I'm flying!

814
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:05,311
Oh no! That not good.

815
01:13:06,687 --> 01:13:09,106
Petrie, no! You gotta finish!

816
01:13:09,648 --> 01:13:12,151
Me can't. Sorry!

817
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:19,533
Got you!

818
01:13:31,462 --> 01:13:33,380
It's all right. Hang on.

819
01:13:36,675 --> 01:13:39,136
I'm gonna make it. I don't know how, but…

820
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:42,139
Me got you both.

821
01:13:43,515 --> 01:13:45,267
Me think.

822
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,316
Help!

823
01:13:54,193 --> 01:13:56,528
Hang on, Petrie!

824
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,030
We're coming!

825
01:14:05,287 --> 01:14:07,247
Nice move, guys!

826
01:14:12,127 --> 01:14:13,337
Tricia!

827
01:14:19,343 --> 01:14:20,344
No!

828
01:14:35,734 --> 01:14:36,902
Tricia!

829
01:14:39,113 --> 01:14:42,574
She's safe.
Our little one is safe.

830
01:14:46,328 --> 01:14:49,290
Yes, thanks to our other little one.

831
01:15:14,106 --> 01:15:16,609
Me not wanna do that again today.

832
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:19,320
Great job, Petrie.

833
01:15:19,945 --> 01:15:22,781
And… Guido, is it?

834
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:24,700
Thank you.

835
01:15:25,075 --> 01:15:29,663
You truly are one of a kind.

836
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,334
Well, and thank you very much, big guy.

837
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:35,669
I mean, I don't mean
that you're, you know, like, "fat" big.

838
01:15:35,753 --> 01:15:36,962
I mean that you're big. You're tall.

839
01:15:37,046 --> 01:15:38,839
I mean, well, of course,
anybody is taller than me.

840
01:15:38,922 --> 01:15:40,674
You, in particular, I mean, hey.

841
01:15:40,758 --> 01:15:42,968
Hey, got a nosebleed?
'Cause look how big you are.

842
01:15:43,052 --> 01:15:46,096
I mean, I really think I better go away.

843
01:15:46,138 --> 01:15:48,807
Bye-bye, big guy… Sir.

844
01:15:51,685 --> 01:15:54,813
But you guys didn't finish
the Day of the Flyers.

845
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:58,525
Doesn't that mean
you'll have to do it all over again?

846
01:16:04,114 --> 01:16:07,493
That okay. We kind of liked it.

847
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:12,122
- Here comes Mom.
- Oh, no.

848
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:19,004
Hi, Mom.

849
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:20,965
Me sorry.

850
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:23,425
I'm so proud of you.

851
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:25,177
All of you.

852
01:16:25,344 --> 01:16:27,680
You know what's really important.

853
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:30,557
Besides, thanks to you,

854
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:33,936
the Day of the Flyers
will never look the same again.

855
01:16:37,564 --> 01:16:39,233
Way to go, Petrie!

856
01:16:54,373 --> 01:16:55,541
Cera.

857
01:17:00,462 --> 01:17:02,047
Did you hear her?

858
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:06,218
<i>Many changes
had occurred on this day of changes.</i>

859
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:08,178
<i>And many more would follow.</i>

860
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,848
<i>The dinosaur families understood this.</i>

861
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:14,268
<i>They knew that change was a part of life</i>
