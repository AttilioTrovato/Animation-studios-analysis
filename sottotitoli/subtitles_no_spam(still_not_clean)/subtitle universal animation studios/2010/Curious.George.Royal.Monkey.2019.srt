Uh... Good morning, George.

00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,869
Careful, lots of important
work here that can't...

9
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,238
get messed up.
Sorry, George,

10
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,140
but Pancake Wednesday
is tomorrow.

11
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,010
I... I don't have time
to make them right now.

12
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,420

Don't play with your food,
George.

37
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,415
Be a good little monkey
while I'm gone.

38
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,387
Bye-bye.

George?

44
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:29,584
Aah!

45
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:34,723
Uh-oh.

46
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,328
George, you can't just do whatever
you want, whenever you want.

47
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,599
Oh. Oh, okay.

48
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:50,340
Now, I have an
appointment with my shower. Again.

49
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,918
<i>...and next
time, we'll explore</i>

50
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,590
<i>secrets of
the mighty Triceratops.</i>

51
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:10,426
<i>Hey! Do you want to
have fun?</i>

52
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:13,630
- Huh?
- <i>Do whatever you want, whenever you want?</i>

53
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:14,965
Ah!

54
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:20,637
<i>Then come on over to Castleland
and live like royalty!</i>

55
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,241
- Ooh.
- <i>You can plunge down the Spiral Staircase...</i>

56
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,412
- Ah.
- <i>...spin on the Swinging Chandelier...</i>

57
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:32,617
- Ooh.
- <i>...or jump on Ye Old Water Wheel.</i>

58
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:36,287
Aha!

59
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,557
<i>You can even ride
noble horses.</i>

60
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:43,228
<i>Enjoy making messes? Go ahead.</i>

61
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,432
<i>Partake in
a raucous medieval feast.</i>

62
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:52,139
Listen, George,
I'm sorry I got angry.

63
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:58,311
It's just... I was asked to take
over this important meeting.

64
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:00,415
I'm a little unprepared.

65
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:02,150
Mmm.

66
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:09,390
Hey, after the meeting, I think we
deserve something fun. What do you say?

67
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,796
<i>Everyone has a coronation,</i>

68
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:17,634
<i>and every guest
is treated like royalty.</i>

69
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:30,713
Oh, okay.
Really? Oh, wow. Thanks.

70
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,515
All right,
I'll see you at the museum.

71
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,385
We're in luck, George.
My friend, Sophie, works at Castleland,

72
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,522
and we're going to be
her guests.

73
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,857
- Huh?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,826
She's gonna pick us up
right after my meeting.

75
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,728
So you're coming with me
to the museum.

76
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:53,473
But you need to be
on your best behavior.

77
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,679
Oh. Mm-hmm.

78
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,363
Ooh, horses.

79
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:21,536
Your Monkeyness, isn't it
wonderful to be out of the castle?

80
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:29,777
Well, I think it's fun
to be out with everybody.

81
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,080
Philippe has a point,
Isabel.

82
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:35,550
Nothing good comes from
mixing with the common folk.

83
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,786
Now, Ana, can you please...

84
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:41,790
Fill you in on our host?
Of course. Just...

85
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,659
over here.
Here he is, Your Majesty.

86
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:48,398
We'll see the Simiana Exhibit,
and then he'll give us a brief tour.

87
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,536
Hmm. Do you really think
a man wearing a hat like that

88
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,438
can be trusted
to take care of our...

89
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,406
Precious artifacts?

90
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,576
Well, he looks a little bit...

91
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:02,446
unusual,
but as you know,

92
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,615
the royal family's popularity
among the people

93
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,618
is at an all-time low.

94
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,889
- Hmm.
- However,

95
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:15,393
this exhibit, combined with Princess
Isabel's upcoming coronation,

96
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,597
is sure to
bring you back on top.

97
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,734
I hope so.

98
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,738
For Isabel's sake.

99
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:39,655
Papa! Look.

100
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,622
Hmph.

101
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:45,927
Isabel, you know music
is simply not dignified.

102
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,631
And certainly not appropriate
for royalty.

103
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,467
Yes, Papa.

104
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:04,780
Quick, George.
I can't be late.

105
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:12,589
Hey, George.
Love the crown.

106
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:14,659
Ah. Ah.

107
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:20,197
Lots of royalty
coming through today.

108
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,801
Don't tell me the King
of Simiana's already here.

109
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:27,773
Judge for yourself.
Isn't he kingly?

110
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:29,709
Oh, brother.

111
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:34,982
Ooh.

112
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,718
Oh, ah.

113
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,521
Come on.
This way, George.

114
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:51,030
George, stay right here
and don't move a muscle.

115
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:54,000
As soon as I'm done,
we're off to Castleland. Okay?

116
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,679
Oh.

117
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,818
Huh.

118
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:13,456
Hmm.

119
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:19,594
Ah...

120
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:21,496
Uh, um...

121
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:22,932
Your Highest Highness.

122
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:25,734
Wait, no, no.
That's wrong.

123
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:27,836
- Uh... Mmm.
- Um, Your Majesty's Royal...

124
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:30,474
No, no, no, no.
That's off, that's off...

125
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:35,714
Wow, it's a miniature version
of home.

126
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,918
And they have a copy
of our Book of Customs.

127
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:44,057
And our host?

128
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,026
Only three minutes late.

129
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:51,595
Tardiness is not
one of our honored customs.

130
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:55,035
I'm here! I'm here.
So sorry I'm late.

131
00:10:56,904 --> 00:11:00,739
Welcome to
our Royal Treasures exhibit.

132
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:04,743
Your privilege.
It's a great Majesty...

133
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:08,817
No, no, no, I mean, I mean,
it's a great Highness... Ah... I, ooh...

134
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:12,952
May I introduce
his Royal Majesty,

135
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:16,689
King Gustavo Hernando
Fernando Heraldo V.

136
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:22,497
And the Princess Isabel Hortensia
Florencia III, of the kingdom of Simiana.

137
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:27,903
Uh... Ted.
I'm Ted... the first.

138
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,341
Oh, is that...

139
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:36,344
The most precious artifact
in all of Simiana,

140
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:38,849
which the king has graciously
loaned to your museum?

141
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,616
Yes.

142
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,053
A monkey. Incredible.

143
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,588
The monkey
is our national symbol.

144
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,990
- It is?
- Yes.

145
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:51,361
Centuries ago,
one saved a young king's life.

146
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:53,796
We treat them
like royalty.

147
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,868
Oh, that's amazing.

148
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:04,975
I happen to be very fond of monkeys too.
Well, one in particular.

149
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:09,615
How fascinating.
As you can see, our Philippe...

150
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:13,920
Ana, where's Philippe?

151
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:29,603
Yuck.

152
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,778
Argh.

153
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:55,099
Huh?

154
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:12,884
Oh.

155
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:19,056
Ah. Oh? Ah.

156
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:29,068
Oh. Ooh.

157
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,780
Aw. Hmm.

158
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,054
Uh-oh!

159
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:57,833
Whoa.

160
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:01,770
Hey!

161
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:07,277
Ooh, ooh.

162
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:16,150
And don't worry
about a thing.

163
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:19,990
If there's one thing I know
how to take care of, it's a...

164
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:22,324
Monkey?

165
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,793
Oh! Whoa! Uh, oh!

166
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,205
What just happened?

167
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,841
Nothing.

168
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,785
I mean, nothing
that will ever happen again.

169
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,786
Hmph.

170
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:52,224
Uh, I can see you're upset.

171
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,927
So... let me just, um...

172
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,896
show you
all the museum's devices

173
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,966
which will keep
your precious artifact safe.

174
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,269
But first,
I just need one minute.

175
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:09,108
Ugh.
This is a disaster.

176
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,346
I've changed my mind.
The exhibition is off.

177
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,114
Oh, I understand,
Your Majesty,

178
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:18,952
but perhaps we could just
give them a second chance.

179
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:22,925
Giving second chances is not an
honored custom. We're leaving.

180
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,966
- George?
- Ooh?

181
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:34,137
You were supposed to
stay in the office.

182
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:42,846
Hi. Sophie, Ted here.
I need a huge favor.

183
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,114
- Doris?
- Hmm?

184
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:48,217
Can you watch George until the
car from Castleland gets here?

185
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:50,252
My friend Sophie
is picking him up.

186
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:53,189
Check. I'm on it.

187
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:56,092
George, I have to stay here
and straighten things out.

188
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:58,629
So you stay with Doris
until Sophie gets here.

189
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:01,800
I'll come to Castleland as soon as I
can, all right?

190
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,338
I printed out
this Castleland brochure.

191
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,075
You can study all the rides
on your trip.

192
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,944
Ooh.

193
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,814
Now, be a good little monkey.

194
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:16,216
Bye.

195
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,418
And I need...

196
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,888
Your car.
It's on the way.

197
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:25,257
You're leaving?

198
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,260
Wait.
Can we talk about this?

199
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:30,031
Good day, Mr...

200
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:33,068
Man with the Yellow Hat.

201
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:35,370
Come. We're going home.

202
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:37,337
But where's Philippe?

203
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:41,177
Apparently, he had the
good sense to wait outside.

204
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:58,026
Sophie, I'm really sorry,

205
00:16:58,028 --> 00:17:00,696
but George and I
are gonna have to reschedule.

206
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:02,498
Huh?

207
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,835
Huh.

208
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:22,488
Hmm.

209
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:24,890
Hmm?

210
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,495
Hmph!

211
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:34,499
Ugh, what was I thinking?

212
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:37,036
This is what happens
when you take chances.

213
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:39,906
There you are,
Your Monkeyness.

214
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:48,983
Oh.

215
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,458
Uh-oh.

216
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,995
Ooh.

217
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,331
Isabel, let me help you out.
Ana, we need to find...

218
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,934
Right away, Your Majesty.

219
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:10,506
There you are.

220
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,074
Hi.

221
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,342
I hope you weren't hurt.

222
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,514
Oh. Uh-uh.

223
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:21,351
Oh, my goodness,
where's your vest? Oh.

224
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:29,057
Oh...

225
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,494
There.
Now you look like yourself.

226
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:32,530
Uh-huh.

227
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,069
Ready to go back to the Castle,
Your Monkeyness?

228
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:01,427
Comin'. Hold on.

229
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:02,597
Hold on.

230
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:08,234
Doris, what happened?
Please tell me it didn't involve George.

231
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:10,236
What part don't you
want to know first?

232
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:13,272
The part where George
climbed on top of the canopy?

233
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:16,243
Or the part where it fell
right on the royal family?

234
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:18,445
What? Oh...

235
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:22,351
George.

236
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:25,453
Are you okay?

237
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,087
Huh?

238
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:30,293
The king
and the princess left.

239
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,426
Huh?

240
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,428
Oh, yes, they did.

241
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,567
So the exhibit's off,
and you're coming home with me.

242
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:39,233
Ugh.

243
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:42,170
We'll have to go to the castle
another day.

244
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,139
Hmph.

245
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,176
So you're going to give me
the silent treatment?

246
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:51,383
Well, fine.
But you still need to come with me.

247
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,355
Ah!

248
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:34,697
Ah. Ooh.

249
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:39,533
Ah!

250
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:43,706
What's the matter, Your Monkeyness?
It's time to go.

251
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:14,504
You know what the problem is?
I've been too nice.

252
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,675
Well, things are going to be
different from now on.

253
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,181
Back from the castle already?

254
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,687
Welcome, Your Highness.

255
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,992
Okay.

256
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,268
Chop, chop. We've got
a lot to work on, buddy.

257
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,476
From now on,
you're playing by the rules.

258
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:06,595
Well...

259
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:15,470
Okay, then.
I'll be out here.

260
00:22:15,472 --> 00:22:17,474
Looking for
a new museum exhibit.

261
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:30,455
Ah...

262
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,628
Does Your Monkeyness
require anything else?

263
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,634
Ah...
Nah...

264
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:44,804
Very well.

265
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:11,566
Ooh.

266
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,668
Uh-huh!

267
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:46,403
Ah!

268
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:52,744
Mmm, mmm!

269
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:56,581
Ooh! Aha.

270
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:02,621
Oh. Ah.

271
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,822
Hmph.

272
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:06,623
I'll take care of this,
Your Majesty.

273
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:12,732
Your Monkeyness, I'll take you to your room.

274
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:21,472
Ooh.

275
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:30,618
I encourage you to rest, Your Monkeyness.
It's been a long trip.

276
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,758
Oh.

277
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:52,709

Ah... Your Monkeyness,
shall we proceed to the banquet hall?

324
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:13,728
Lunch is about to be served.

325
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:16,664
Ah! Aha!

326
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:46,731
This, my friend,
is a copy of the Simianan Book of Customs.

327
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:55,805
Yep, today, you're going to
learn proper eating etiquette.

328
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,409
It says here,
"When sitting down,

329
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,780
take your napkin
and place it on your..."

330
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,653
Yeah. Okay.
That... that was good.

331
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:09,821
"Don't scoop your food.

332
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,155
The knife can be used

333
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,593
to help guide food
onto your fork.

334
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,732
And avoid placing your elbows
on the table at all times."

335
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,008
Huh.

336
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:36,751
This is harder
than I thought.

337
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,454
"And finally,
when you're done,

338
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:42,024
don't forget to use
your napkin."

339
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:48,764
Wow. Look who joined
the Clean Plate Club.

340
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:57,873
And the Clean Table Club.

341
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,810
We should have done this
a long time ago.

342
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:14,859
Ah! Ah.

343
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:20,933
Ah.

344
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:27,706
Lunch is served.

345
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:31,810
Wow.

346
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:35,949
Ooh.

347
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:59,107
Aw.

348
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:03,712
Well...

349
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:07,816
You wouldn't understand.

350
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:09,886
Huh? Ah.

351
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:14,389
Ah.

352
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:17,259
So, Mr. Mayor,
how are the preparations going?

353
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:20,128
Everything is in order
for tomorrow,

354
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,299
when we celebrate Princess
Isabel's junior coronation.

355
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:28,136
The coronation of the heir apparent.

356
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,872
Ooh!

357
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:35,579
Your Monkeyness,
you seem surprised.

358
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:37,880
But you know
that tomorrow is the day

359
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:41,285
Princess Isabel becomes an
official member of the Royal Court

360
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:44,221
and begins
her many royal duties.

361
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:46,590
Oh, please
don't remind me.

362
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:49,427
I want to enjoy
my last day of freedom.

363
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,963
Now, Isabel...

364
00:30:52,965 --> 00:30:58,169
There's just
one last piece of business.

365
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:02,007
I'm afraid the people still
insist on having their

366
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:04,312
horse race as part
of the big day.

367
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,952
But I've seen to it
that the people's derby

368
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,223
will be over
well before the coronation.

369
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:18,924
Did you say there's
a horse derby tomorrow?

370
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,895
Why didn't I know about this?
Can we go?

371
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:26,068
Oh, well, that's not
on our itinerary.

372
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,471
Isabel, these events
are unseemly,

373
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,809
and we will certainly
not attend.

374
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:35,412
Aw.

375
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,212
The mayor's point

376
00:31:38,214 --> 00:31:41,383
is that it won't interfere
with your coronation.

377
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:43,421
That's good news, my dear.

378
00:31:45,356 --> 00:31:47,091
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

379
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:16,421
What are you doing?

380
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,277
The Royal Monkey
is clearly not himself today.

381
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,146
Allow me, Your Majesty.

382
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:44,186
Your Monkeyness, I can see you might
enjoy a rest after your long journey.

383
00:32:54,331 --> 00:32:57,901
I trust Your Monkeyness will feel
more like himself after a bath.

384
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,036
Yeah.

385
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,205
Yah!

386
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:09,046
I see.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

387
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:12,314
Bye-bye.

388
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:25,530
How's Philippe?

389
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:29,233
He's, uh, bathing. So
I think it's best if we just...

390
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:32,539
Ana, Philippe never behaved
like this before that trip.

391
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:38,142
I blame that...
that yellow hatted man.

392
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:41,580
Well, yes, the Royal Monkey will
be back to his well-behaved self

393
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:43,348
in no time, Your Majesty.

394
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,585
He has such a critical role
in Isabel's coronation.

395
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:50,525
He's crowning her, for goodness sake.
Nothing can go wrong.

396
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:53,495
Oh...

397
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:56,496
Absolutely.

398
00:33:56,498 --> 00:34:00,066
To make sure of it,
I scheduled an extra rehearsal today.

399
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:03,036
But we've rehearsed
a hundred times.

400
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,142
I know, my dear,
but this is quite important.

401
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:11,178
Perhaps
we should leave Philippe

402
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:16,116
so that the bath can have
the full soothing effect.

403
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:18,520
I'm sure he'll join us
as soon as he's done.

404
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:21,091
Hmm. No doubt you're right.

405
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,302
Huh?

406
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,136
Your next lesson today:

407
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,342
taking a bath
without making your usual mess.

408
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,547
Now, I know
that's a big step, but...

409
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,288
What? What's the matter?

410
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:53,126
Oh.
Look at that.

411
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:59,163
Okay, well, uh, we've got lots
of towels to choose from...

412
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:01,435
Hmm. Huh? Yeesh.

413
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:04,272
- Hmm.
- Huh?

414
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:11,580
Uh... yes, sir.

415
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:15,350
What just happened?

416
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:25,562
Okay, young monkey,
that bathroom had better be...

417
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,368
Spotless?

418
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:37,441
Wow.

419
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:42,580
Ahem.

420
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:48,352
Oh. Sorry.

421
00:35:56,728 --> 00:36:02,233
Wow. Perhaps I pushed George
too hard.

422
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:16,514
Is Your Monkeyness ready
for the coronation rehearsal?

423
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:17,651
Uh-huh.

424
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:26,561
Okay, we're picking this up from
the princess already seated.

425
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:33,633
Excellent.
Now, cue the drummers.

426
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:36,570
And now, the royal trumpeters.

427
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:45,581
And now, the Royal Monkey,
bearing his royal scepter.

428
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,124
The Royal Monkey enters!

429
00:36:56,994 --> 00:36:59,494
Oh, come on,
where's the Royal Monkey?

430
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,536
Aha!

431
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:41,542
Ooh!

432
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:45,577
Huh?

433
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,613
Did everyone suddenly forget

434
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,415
the king's no-music policy?

435
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,818
Huh?

436
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,488
Your Monkeyness. Please.
We need to continue.

437
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,666
Places, please, places.

438
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:09,336
And here we go.
Drummers...

439
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:12,073
Now, carrying the crown,

440
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:15,844
the Royal Monkey performs
the traditional royal march.

441
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:22,550
Okay...
The Royal Monkey proceeds...

442
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:26,422
...with great formality...

443
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,924
and presents the crown
to the princess.

444
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:51,384
Ooh.

445
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:16,978
Okay.

446
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:24,452
I think you have rehearsed
quite enough for one day.

447
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:29,926
What has gotten into
you two?

448
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:32,626
Ooh.

449
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:33,862
Don't worry, Ana.

450
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:35,529
We're just tired
of rehearsing.

451
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:37,165
We've done it
perfectly before,

452
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,602
and we'll get it right
tomorrow too.

453
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:43,473
Well... see that you do.

454
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:50,481
Oh...

455
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:53,551
What am I going to do,
Philippe?

456
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:57,622
Huh?

457
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:01,427
Oh, this is too awful.

458
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:15,876
Hmm.

459
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:19,947
Mm-hmm. Mm-mm-hmm.

460
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:22,984
Mm-hmm.

461
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:29,824
This barge should be first
and this one last.

462
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,663
Uh, no, wait...
Uh, this should be first and...

463
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:39,501
Ugh, this is complicated.

464
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:44,506
Uh, yes, enter, enter away.

465
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:48,676
Ah, good. You've brought...

466
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:50,780
The Royal Monkey,
as you requested.

467
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,920
Thank you, Ana.
That will be all.

468
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:06,430
Your Monkeyness, I wanted
to speak with you myself.

469
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,541
Ooh.

470
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,510
Oh. You like the boats?

471
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:28,652
Ah. I made them myself.
See, I added the flags.

472
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,024
And here,
the itty-bitty bunting.

473
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:33,026
Ooh.

474
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,696
Aah.

475
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:43,737
Uh-uh, not so fast.
The Royal Barge is on your tail.

476
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:47,006
And it's a tie!

477
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:51,713
Ooh.

478
00:42:00,022 --> 00:42:03,557
Yes, uh, well,

479
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,729
I was just finalizing the plans
for Isabel's coronation tomorrow.

480
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:08,628
Ha-ha.

481
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,566
Uh, which is why
I sent for you.

482
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:15,638
You see, you were just not
acting like our Royal Monkey.

483
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:18,775
Oh.

484
00:42:20,077 --> 00:42:23,846
No. You must straighten up.

485
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:25,914
I'm counting on you
to make sure

486
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:29,918
absolutely nothing goes wrong
tomorrow that would embarrass Isabel.

487
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,859
Her future, in fact,
the future of the whole kingdom...

488
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,729
depends on it.

489
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:41,800
Oh.

490
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:58,551
Hmm.

491
00:43:01,688 --> 00:43:02,689
Hmph.

492
00:43:06,727 --> 00:43:09,898
Hmm?

493
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:28,751
Hmm.

494
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:33,123
Hmm.

495
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:46,170
Hmm.

496
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:07,160
Huh?

497
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,125
Oh, wow.

498
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:42,064
Your Monkeyness?
I've never seen you at the stables before.

499
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,672
Huh? Hey!

500
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:54,976
I'm glad we're done
with those boring rehearsals.

501
00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:58,213
I know my coronation's
important, but after tomorrow,

502
00:44:58,215 --> 00:45:00,150
I'll never be allowed
to have any fun.

503
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:10,293
Well, you know,
it's not like it is in fairy tales.

504
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:13,831
Just boring meetings all the
time once I'm a real princess.

505
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:20,804
Papa says there will be
no time to ride El Fuego.

506
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:29,815
Your Monkeyness,
you're acting so strange.

507
00:45:31,817 --> 00:45:33,119
Why did you come to see me?

508
00:45:34,788 --> 00:45:35,789
Huh?

509
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:58,747
I didn't know you and
Fernando were friends.

510
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:05,954
You seem so different
since our trip.

511
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:08,823
I like the new Philippe.

512
00:46:08,825 --> 00:46:10,827
Whoa.

513
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:25,809
Huh?

514
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:30,115
Oh, dear. Hyah.

515
00:46:35,153 --> 00:46:36,187
Where are you going?

516
00:46:43,062 --> 00:46:44,930
Philippe,
we shouldn't be here.

517
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:47,800
Ah.

518
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:53,240
Hmm.

519
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:59,813
You know, I've never ridden El
Fuego outside the castle gate.

520
00:47:09,924 --> 00:47:11,658

Oh, thank you.

559
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:17,227
Did you know El Fuego
is a champion racehorse?

560
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:18,495
Ooh.

561
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:24,034
This is the last
announcement that the people's derby

562
00:49:24,036 --> 00:49:27,271
will start tomorrow
at 11:00 a.m. sharp.

563
00:49:27,273 --> 00:49:31,075
Everyone, young and old,
is welcome to enter.

564
00:49:31,077 --> 00:49:36,582
Just gather your noble steeds at the
starting line after the bugle call.

565
00:49:36,584 --> 00:49:39,384
It's going to be a grand event.

566
00:49:39,386 --> 00:49:43,622
The derby. I'd give anything
to ride in it just once.

567
00:49:43,624 --> 00:49:45,993
And I bet
El Fuego would too.

568
00:49:50,064 --> 00:49:51,264
You think we should?

569
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:01,376
I... but I...

570
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,513
Huh?

571
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:09,283
You're right.
This is my last chance.

572
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:12,219
El Fuego and I
are running in the derby.

573
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,125
But we'd better
get back to the castle.

574
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:20,228
Papa will be wondering
where we are. Hyah!

575
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,163
Ride like the wind,
Your Monkeyness!

Okay, buddy.

580
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:38,147
After all that hard work,
you deserve a little fun.

581
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:40,217
So, go ahead, have fun!

582
00:50:42,555 --> 00:50:43,622
Eh.

583
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:48,193
Huh?

584
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:54,100
Oh, come on.
This is your favorite park.

585
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:06,581
Hey, how about climbing?
Oh, you love climbing trees.

586
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:14,487
Oh, here I go. Look at me.
I am climbing.

587
00:51:20,228 --> 00:51:24,500
Oh, my goodness, this is so much fun!
Hey, come on up!

588
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:31,205
Hey, so, uh...

589
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:33,576
how do you get down
from one of these things?

590
00:51:35,646 --> 00:51:37,713
This really isn't necessary.

591
00:51:37,715 --> 00:51:39,581
- Yes, sir.
- You see, it's George,

592
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:42,651
he's like a different monkey,
and it's all my fault.

593
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:44,622
Yeah.
Whatever you say, sir.

594
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:47,726
I just want
my old monkey back.

595
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,265
Argh.

596
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,612
I hope that means
you forgive me.

597
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,614
Mmm?

598
00:52:10,784 --> 00:52:14,286
Hmm. I could use a snack.
How about you?

599
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:35,711
Hmm.

600
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:44,653
Mm-hmm.

601
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:48,525
Mmm.

602
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:58,599
Is this really necessary?

603
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:01,603
But, Your Majesty,
studies show

604
00:53:01,605 --> 00:53:03,706
that the more people
watch the coronation,

605
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:06,341
the better for
the national image.

606
00:53:06,343 --> 00:53:09,045
No, no, I mean makeup.

607
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:13,284
Oh, it...
brings out your eyes, Your Majesty.

608
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:16,321
Very well.

609
00:53:19,357 --> 00:53:22,760
In three, two...

610
00:53:22,762 --> 00:53:25,498
Uh, my fellow citizens
of Simiana.

611
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:31,335
It is my pleasure
to invite you

612
00:53:31,337 --> 00:53:33,506
to my daughter's coronation
tomorrow.

613
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:42,382
Race you.

614
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:52,293
Isabel will assume
her official...

615
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:57,800
Papa?

616
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:01,302
...with dedication and...

617
00:54:01,637 --> 00:54:03,904
Argh.

618
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,583
Uh-oh.

619
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:22,825
...to witness our country's
most solemn ceremony.

620
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,461
Ooh-oh!

621
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:34,938
Aaah!

622
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,876
Well, I think that about
wraps up the interview.

623
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,918
Isabel, what happened?

624
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,386
I'm sorry, Papa.

625
00:54:49,388 --> 00:54:52,592
And, Philippe,
you were supposed to look after her.

626
00:54:55,728 --> 00:54:58,596
Papa, I know I probably
broke every rule...

627
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:01,667
Riding outside the castle?
And riding a goat?

628
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:02,868
What if
someone had seen you?

629
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,838
We were just out
trying to have some fun.

630
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,907
Hmm.

631
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:12,679
Isabel, you don't know how
quickly the people can turn on you

632
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:15,517
if you go against custom
and look silly.

633
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:18,518
What do you mean?

634
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,421
Uh, let's not
talk about this anymore.

635
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:24,792
Ana, see to it that the
princess and Royal Monkey

636
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:26,963
get to the coronation
on time tomorrow.

637
00:55:33,937 --> 00:55:36,673
- Aah.
- I should have never gone riding with you!

638
00:55:37,808 --> 00:55:38,909
Huh?

639
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:43,780
Your Monkeyness, I'll see you
at the coronation tomorrow.

640
00:55:53,691 --> 00:55:55,393

Okay, we're in for a treat.
I made pancakes.

649
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:30,594
Hey, you wanna play
hide-n-seek?

650
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:31,630
Mmm.

651
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,835
How about checkers?

652
00:57:35,736 --> 00:57:36,837
Uh-uh.

653
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:39,740
Okay...

654
00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:44,977
How about a movie?

655
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:48,848
<i>And now for light news
from around the world.</i>

656
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:52,785
<i>There was a minor mishap in a
little known country, Simiana.</i>

657
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:54,787
Simiana?

658
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:57,991
<i>With the upcoming coronation
of their new princess,</i>

659
00:57:57,993 --> 00:58:02,095
<i>they held a press conference and
things did not go quite as planned.</i>

660
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:04,798
<i>I hope you will
join us tomorrow</i>

661
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,737
<i>to witness our country's
most solemn ceremony.</i>

662
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:13,207
Oh.

663
00:58:13,209 --> 00:58:15,143
<i>It looks
like that little monkey</i>

664
00:58:15,145 --> 00:58:17,945
<i>caused quite a mess.
In other news...</i>

665
00:58:17,947 --> 00:58:21,584
Hey. That monkey
looks just like you, George.

666
00:58:23,654 --> 00:58:26,991
And he kind of acts like
you used to.

667
00:58:29,994 --> 00:58:31,029
Wait a minute.

668
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:38,402
Okay, this may sound crazy,
but are you, by any chance,

669
00:58:38,404 --> 00:58:40,739
the Royal Monkey of Simiana?

670
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:43,742
Uh-huh.

671
00:58:44,911 --> 00:58:47,711
Uh... Wait.

672
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:50,014
Did you come to the museum
with the king and the princess?

673
00:58:50,016 --> 00:58:52,250
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, boy.

674
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:54,821
Uh, you... Uh...

675
00:58:58,892 --> 00:59:04,698
So, George is in Simiana
and I didn't break my monkey!

676
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:10,136
I mean, uh, no offense, Your Magician...
Majestration...

677
00:59:10,138 --> 00:59:11,973
Uh, Mr. Monkey, sir.

678
00:59:15,277 --> 00:59:16,811
We need to get you
back home.

679
00:59:17,946 --> 00:59:19,714
And I've got to get George.

680
01:00:03,028 --> 01:00:06,065
Huh?

681
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,843
I'm going to miss you,
El Fuego.

682
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:18,811
Huh?

683
01:00:19,947 --> 01:00:21,849
Your Monkeyness.

684
01:00:27,955 --> 01:00:29,222
Ah.

685
01:00:30,858 --> 01:00:32,894
Yeah.

686
01:00:35,363 --> 01:00:36,965
The derby will start soon.

687
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:47,810
You know I can't.
I have to leave all this behind.

688
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:55,252
I know,
it would be so much fun.

689
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:02,924
But apparently fun is a luxury for
ordinary people, not a princess.

690
01:01:14,906 --> 01:01:17,809
If fun is for ordinary people...

691
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:23,916
then let's be ordinary.

692
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,330
Hey! Can you give us a hand?

693
01:02:07,096 --> 01:02:09,130
I can't believe we're doing
this, Your Monkeyness.

694
01:02:09,132 --> 01:02:10,865
We're really doing this.

695
01:02:17,641 --> 01:02:23,378
<i>Riders, approach the
starting line. The derby's about to begin!</i>

696
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,126
Hyah!

697
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:46,138
Your Highness?
It's almost time to go.

698
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:49,008
Princess?

699
01:02:52,011 --> 01:02:55,380
Ah, she must be there already.
Probably couldn't wait for her big day.

700
01:02:55,382 --> 01:02:58,316
That must be it.

701
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:01,121
That better be it.
Please let that be it.

702
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:16,871
Oh, here you are,
little boy.

703
01:03:17,272 --> 01:03:18,940
Huh? Ah.

704
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,476
Huh?

705
01:03:39,162 --> 01:03:45,033
Riders, on your mark,
get set... go!

706
01:03:47,238 --> 01:03:50,105
Yeah! Come on! Whoo!

707
01:03:50,107 --> 01:03:52,109
Go, go, go!

708
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:10,530
Ooh.

709
01:04:17,404 --> 01:04:21,141
Huh?
Uh-oh.

710
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,614
Oh! It's the Royal Monkey.

711
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:31,083
The Royal Monkey.

712
01:04:31,085 --> 01:04:32,220
The Royal Monkey's
in the race.

713
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,258
Aah!

714
01:04:57,815 --> 01:05:01,351
Huh?
The princess is in the race?

715
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,123
Princess Isabel is in the race!

716
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:11,062
- It's the princess!
- Princess Isabel!

717
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:12,997
Huh?

718
01:05:16,268 --> 01:05:19,169
Turn it on, El Fuego.
Hyah!

719
01:05:23,108 --> 01:05:26,477

Congratulations,

You won the derby, Princess.

733
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:22,437
I can't believe that your
father granted you permission

734
01:06:22,439 --> 01:06:26,542
to join us, with your
coronation happening so soon.

735
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:30,146
My coronation!
I almost forgot!

736
01:06:30,148 --> 01:06:32,617
I'm so sorry.
We have to go.

737
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:39,090
Eh... but your prize,
Princess!

738
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:57,677
What a beautiful country
you have.

739
01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:03,351
Hmm.

740
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,468
Your Monkeyness.

741
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:27,410
Oh.

742
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:34,384
Entry
by royal invitation only.

743
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:38,455
This is not good.

744
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:48,700
Hey, you climbed a tree.

745
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:56,574
Oh. And now it's my turn.

746
01:07:58,476 --> 01:08:01,346
Argh!

747
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:11,589
Oh, boy! Ah, an intruder!

748
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:14,226
Over there!

749
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:18,296
Hey, stop!

750
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:20,767
Halt in
the name of the king!

751
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,305
Come in.

752
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:29,343
Ooh.

753
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:34,683
I think I'm ready
for my coronation now.

754
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:36,618
Uh-huh.

755
01:08:39,455 --> 01:08:41,657
George? George?

756
01:08:45,661 --> 01:08:48,330
Over here!

757
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,641
Eh...

758
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,913
I think
I've got this backwards.

759
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,460
Your Highness?
Your Monkeyness?

760
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,295
George!

761
01:09:49,363 --> 01:09:50,832
Aw.

762
01:09:53,935 --> 01:09:59,505
I'm so confused.
Are there two Philippes?

763
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:02,943
- Uh-huh.
- George, I am sorry it took me so long to get here.

764
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:05,379
I thought you were him
and he was you,

765
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:07,681
but I'm so glad
that you're not.

766
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:11,719
Er, no offense, Philippe.

767
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:15,824
Oh, George,
I missed you so much.

768
01:10:15,826 --> 01:10:18,160
Don't ever stop being
my fun little monkey.

769
01:10:18,162 --> 01:10:19,563
Aw.

770
01:10:29,006 --> 01:10:31,440
- Philippe?
- Uh-huh.

771
01:10:31,442 --> 01:10:33,877
Yeah, back at the museum,
you left Philippe with me,

772
01:10:33,879 --> 01:10:35,647
and you took George home
by mistake.

773
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:41,185
George, you really spiced
things up around here.

774
01:10:41,187 --> 01:10:44,389
- Ah.
- He has a way of doing that.

775
01:10:45,524 --> 01:10:47,694
And I loved it.

776
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,894
Aw.

777
01:10:49,896 --> 01:10:53,600
Philippe, I'm glad you're
home safe and sound.

778
01:10:55,802 --> 01:10:56,769
Mmm.

779
01:10:58,438 --> 01:10:59,573
Mmm.

780
01:11:02,643 --> 01:11:03,744
Ah.

781
01:11:04,745 --> 01:11:06,879
Mmm.

782
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:08,647
The intruder's this way!

783
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:10,717
Oh, yeah.
I'm the intruder.

784
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,585
- Over here!
- Come on. We'd better hide you.

785
01:11:12,587 --> 01:11:13,722
Clear down this hall!

786
01:11:17,659 --> 01:11:19,527
Check around that corner!

787
01:11:21,663 --> 01:11:24,767
- What now?
- Shh. Let's just hope they won't come in.

788
01:11:31,942 --> 01:11:34,976
Uh, George,
best not to touch anything.

789
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:35,879
Uh-huh.

790
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:38,682
Ooh.

791
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,684
A secret passage?

792
01:11:44,621 --> 01:11:46,756
Over here!
Check the king's quarters!

793
01:11:58,704 --> 01:12:00,604
I got nothing.

794
01:12:00,606 --> 01:12:01,707
Copy that.

795
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:06,110
I think they're gone.

796
01:12:11,918 --> 01:12:12,852
Oh!

797
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:23,631
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

798
01:12:28,035 --> 01:12:30,769
- What's going on?
- Intruder in the castle, ma'am.

799
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:33,474
If you see a man wearing a yellow
hat, let us know.

800
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:35,978
Argh.

801
01:12:39,881 --> 01:12:44,753
What is this place?
Papa has a secret room?

802
01:12:45,755 --> 01:12:47,655
Did you know about this?

803
01:12:47,657 --> 01:12:49,692
Uh-uh.

804
01:12:53,896 --> 01:12:55,732
All these
old pictures of Papa.

805
01:12:56,834 --> 01:13:00,004
I never saw any of them.
He was so happy.

806
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,640
I don't think
I've ever seen him smile.

807
01:13:05,642 --> 01:13:06,877
Uh-uh.

808
01:13:08,612 --> 01:13:12,115
Look, Papa played the horn.

809
01:13:12,117 --> 01:13:14,753
Not for a long time
from the looks of it.

810
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:20,893
I wonder why.

811
01:13:22,695 --> 01:13:24,063
Ooh.

812
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:33,740
Hey, look.

813
01:13:38,779 --> 01:13:41,679
Papa's coronation.

814
01:13:41,681 --> 01:13:44,850
Look, Philippe,
it's your father.

815
01:13:44,852 --> 01:13:46,852
Aw.

816
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:48,754
<i>And now,
Prince Gustavo</i>

817
01:13:48,756 --> 01:13:50,723
<i>will perform
his original composition</i>

818
01:13:50,725 --> 01:13:52,827
<i>for the people of Simiana.</i>

819
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,067
He's good.

820
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:01,770
Uh-huh.

821
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,077
Huh? Uh. Argh!

822
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:11,913
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

823
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,714
<i>What a shocking development.</i>

824
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,151
<i>The prince has taken a tumble.</i>

825
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:19,421
<i>Such an embarrassment.</i>

826
01:14:19,423 --> 01:14:20,757
Poor Papa.

827
01:14:23,828 --> 01:14:25,761
Oh.

828
01:14:25,763 --> 01:14:28,831
That's why he's so scared
of anything ever going wrong.

829
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:31,000
He's afraid
people will laugh at us.

830
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,605
My coronation.

831
01:14:37,209 --> 01:14:40,710
I can't be late.
I don't want Papa to be embarrassed again.

832
01:14:40,712 --> 01:14:42,148
How are we going to
get out of here?

833
01:14:50,457 --> 01:14:51,858
What are you thinking?

834
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:56,930
Oh, boy.

835
01:15:02,035 --> 01:15:03,036
Huh?

836
01:15:05,306 --> 01:15:06,807
Is that...

837
01:15:08,877 --> 01:15:11,811
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...
Princess!

838
01:15:11,813 --> 01:15:13,146
Here we go.

839
01:15:13,148 --> 01:15:15,183
- Aaah!
- Whoo!

840
01:15:19,188 --> 01:15:21,190
- Look out!
- Whoo-hoo!

841
01:15:27,129 --> 01:15:30,198
Oh, oh, my goodness!
Princess, are you okay?

842
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,798
Never better.

843
01:15:33,203 --> 01:15:37,105
Philippe? Philippe?

844
01:15:37,107 --> 01:15:38,806
Hmm.

845
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:44,847
Uh, hi, I'm Ted.
From the museum.

846
01:15:44,849 --> 01:15:48,083
You're hard to forget.

847
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,853
Ana, I'll explain everything later.

848
01:15:50,855 --> 01:15:53,891
Right now, we have to
get to the barge. Come on!

849
01:16:13,547 --> 01:16:14,814
We're too late!

850
01:16:19,786 --> 01:16:21,787
Ted, grab that rowboat.

851
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:25,257
Yes!
Philippe, other monkey, man the oars!

852
01:16:25,259 --> 01:16:26,994
Better yet, monkey them!

853
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:37,872
Uh, anyone have some
horn-removal oil?

854
01:16:56,293 --> 01:16:59,361
Greetings, citizens of Simiana.

855
01:16:59,363 --> 01:17:02,197
Let the Royal Coronation begin.

856
01:17:25,324 --> 01:17:26,393
Huh?

857
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,267
Where's Isabel?

858
01:17:40,374 --> 01:17:43,377
A little closer,
a little closer.

859
01:17:50,251 --> 01:17:51,852
Oh, boy.

860
01:17:53,488 --> 01:17:55,090
Isabel?

861
01:17:56,024 --> 01:17:57,225
Philippe?

862
01:17:58,894 --> 01:18:01,363
This is a disaster.

863
01:18:23,354 --> 01:18:26,990
This can't be happening.
Not on Isabel's big day!

864
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,260
Papa?

865
01:18:30,095 --> 01:18:31,262
Isabel.

866
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:35,064
I'm sorry, Papa.

867
01:18:35,066 --> 01:18:36,500
Oh, there she is!

868
01:18:36,502 --> 01:18:38,404
Congratulations!

869
01:18:41,005 --> 01:18:42,408
I don't understand.

870
01:18:43,275 --> 01:18:44,877
Princess!

871
01:18:45,945 --> 01:18:48,047
You ran off without this,
Princess.

872
01:18:49,081 --> 01:18:51,917
Whoa, whoa. Aah!

873
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,889
Congratulations!

874
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,893
The derby?
You raced.

875
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:02,028
And won!

876
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:17,279
Two Philippes?

877
01:19:19,348 --> 01:19:21,348
And you?

878
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:25,051
Hi. Yes, it's me,
Your Majesty.

879
01:19:25,053 --> 01:19:28,525
And this is Philippe.
But this is George.

880
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,062
Uncanny.

881
01:19:35,064 --> 01:19:37,131
Is that my horn?

882
01:19:37,133 --> 01:19:39,270
Papa, I know
about your coronation.

883
01:19:40,404 --> 01:19:42,404
You saw?

884
01:19:42,406 --> 01:19:46,544
You played music so well.
And you loved it.

885
01:19:47,478 --> 01:19:49,481
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

886
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:54,952
People laughed at me.
I didn't want that for you.

887
01:19:56,188 --> 01:19:58,555
You should give the people
another chance.

888
01:19:58,557 --> 01:20:00,959
Let them get to know you, Papa.

889
01:20:02,562 --> 01:20:05,531
And you shouldn't let fear stop
you from doing what you love.

890
01:20:06,632 --> 01:20:08,234
George taught me that.

891
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:18,111
Then you are
a very special monkey.

892
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:27,087
And you are
a very wise princess.

893
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:36,128
- Aw.
- Mmm.

894
01:21:31,324 --> 01:21:32,592
