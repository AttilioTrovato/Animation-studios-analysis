and spit liquid fire.

162
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:54,255
And the heat...
Like you've never seen before!

163
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:57,550
But, it's too upsetting
to talk about.

164
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:01,930
But if you must know,
it all started with a horrible boom!

165
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,350
<i>The Fire Mountain exploded.</i>

166
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:09,145
<i>It just blew its top.</i>
<i>Fire everywhere you looked.</i>

167
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,815
<i>There was no escape.</i>

168
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:17,695
<i>And the Longnecks, oh,</i>
<i>they were hit the hardest.</i>

169
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:23,076
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>their leader was brave.</i>

170
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,037
<i>He wouldn't leave</i>
<i>any of us behind,</i>

171
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,456
<i>even though he was in danger.</i>

172
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:33,670
<i>I only escaped thanks</i>
<i>to my superior grace and agility.</i>

173
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,716
The leader is my dad.

174
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,218
Who?

175
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:41,594
Bron.

176
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:44,597
Oh, yes, yes, that's him!

177
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:46,099
Bron!

178
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,351
What a brave Longneck he was.

179
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,394
Ooh.

180
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:52,814
Er... Is.
Uh, is!

181
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:55,817
'Cause he's still is...
He still is... I'm sure.

182
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:57,735
What happened to him?

183
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:01,239
I don't know. I lost sight of him
at the Fire Mountain.

184
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:02,990
He's in trouble?

185
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:05,701
Grandpa, we have to help him.

186
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:07,537
Littlefoot...

187
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,373
Will you take us back there?

188
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,749
You know the way.

189
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,170
So, you want me to take you

190
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:17,421
across the earthbreak,

191
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:20,007
through the Land of the
Feather-Head Sharptooth,

192
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,676
along the moving water

193
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,221
back to the same Fire Mountain
that I just escaped from?

194
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:29,058
How foolish do you think I look?

195
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,190
Let me put it another way.

196
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:38,567
The answer is no!

197
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:43,405
Please. That's my dad.
He needs our help.

198
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:47,034
He's right, Littlefoot.
We can't do it.

199
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:48,994
But...

200
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,996
You'll go, won't you?

201
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:03,133
I'm sorry, Littlefoot.
It's too dangerous now.

202
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:07,429
We must wait for the mountain
to stop spitting rocks.

203
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,974
Bron wouldn't want us to get hurt.

204
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:12,559
But my dad needs us now!

205
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:16,772
Your father is very strong and wise.

206
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:19,066
He's lived through
many earthshakes.

207
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:22,778
I'm sure he's on his way
here right now.

208
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,801
Where are you, Dad?

209

find you anywhere.

212
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,186
We are sorry
about your father.

213
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:57,688
Yes, we are.

Thanks.

216
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,820
I think he's in trouble.
He needs me.

217
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:06,571
What can you do?

218
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,865
I'm going
to the Fire Mountain.

219
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,284
I'm going to help him.

you going to Fire Mountain.

I'm going.

We don't have
to go across!

We can follow it
