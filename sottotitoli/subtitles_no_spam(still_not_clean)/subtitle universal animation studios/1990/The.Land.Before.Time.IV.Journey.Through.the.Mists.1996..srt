before the first human
ever walked the earth,

5
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:17,220
the world was filled
with strange and
wonderful creatures.

6
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:24,327
The greatest
of these creatures
were called dinosaurs.

they travel and live

You mean instead of
living in one place

That's right.

56
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:35,485

00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,502
Huh?
Littlefoot?

368
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,071
Shh!
What are you
doing here?

369
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,973
I've got to find
the night flower.

370
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:05,974
What?

371
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,309
Shh.

372
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,116
Will you tell me
where to find it?

373
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,751
I can't,
Littlefoot.

374
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,587
It's too dangerous.

375
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,356
The Land of Mists
is filled with
horrible monsters.

376
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,657
You can't go
by yourself.

377
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,726
I'm not.

378
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,128
I'm going to ask Cera,
Ducky, Petrie and
Spike to go with me.

379
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,897
But what about me?

380
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:31,833
Well... I...

381
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:33,768
I didn't think
you'd want to come
because you...

382
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:36,405
You don't like
my friends.

383
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:37,806
And besides,

384
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,007
you just said
you didn't want to go.

385
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:41,075
I'll go. But...

386
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:42,611
But we can't take
the others.

387
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:44,779
Huh?
See?

388
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:46,981
If we take them,
it'll only slow us down.

389
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:50,018
I don't know.

390
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:52,454
Hurry, Littlefoot.
I know the way.

391
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:53,655
The others don't.

392
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:56,391
We have to go now
or the grown-ups
will try and stop us.

393
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:15,009
I could not find
Littlefoot anywhere.

394
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:19,080
Oh... I no find him,
either.

395
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,149
Oh, he's probably
just hiding from us

396
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:23,485

Dark water.

429
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,724
It means
it's real deep.

we'll just have to
go exploring.

only the golden petals
of the night flower
could cure him.

471

Littlefoot was so worried
about his Grandpa.

That's why I know
he's gone to
the Land of Mists,

Oh, no, no,
no, no.

off playing with that

Not with his

Besides,
Ali is missing, too.

the way to the

you won't go there.

Littlefoot.

549
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,019
So tell me,
Littlefoot,

550
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:27,155
what are you doing
here all alone?

551
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:30,324
I'm not alone.
I'm with my
friend, Ali.

552
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,993
I mean, if she's
all right, that is.

It's just

00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:43,771

558
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,646
Ali's on the

help me dig out?

564
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:04,658

1082
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,061
Look out!

1083
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:38,530
Ducky!

1084
01:02:38,564 --> 01:02:40,099
ALL: Ducky!

01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:50,276

01:02:59,919 --> 01:03:03,055

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1091
01:03:08,294 --> 01:03:09,828
Oh...

1092
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:19,405
We gotta
do something!

1093
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,140
Come on!

1094
01:03:22,274 --> 01:03:25,244
You're next, my
little diet delights.

Oh, no! Oh, no!
(ICHY SCREAMING)

1098
01:03:40,226 --> 01:03:43,595
ICHY: Don't swallow, Dil!
It's me, Ichy.

1099
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:46,098
Ichy?
Open up,
you idiot!

1100
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:51,237
(GASPS) You almost ate me.

1101
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,072
But it was
an accident, Ichy.

1102
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:54,673
I didn't see you.

1103
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:57,977
Of course you didn't
see me. You can't
see your own nose

1104
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:00,679
at the end
of your face.
You're useless!

1105
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,682
Useless? Without me,
you'd starve!

1106
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:06,218
I would not.
You would too.

1107
01:04:06,252 --> 01:04:07,987
Would not.
Would too.

1108
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:08,754
Would not, would not,
would not!

1109
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,089

would too!

1110
01:04:10,122 --> 01:04:11,490
That's it, Dil.

1111
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:13,292
I've had it
with you, Ichy!

1112
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:14,526
From now on...

1113
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,162
I'm going it alone!
I'm going it alone!

1114
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:19,565
No!

1116
01:04:25,304 --> 01:04:26,472

Huh?

1118
01:04:32,344 --> 01:04:33,145

Ducky!

1122

Are you all right?

1123
01:04:50,362 --> 01:04:53,265
I think so.

1124
01:04:53,299 --> 01:04:56,535
But I thought
I heard Spike talk.

1125
01:04:56,568 --> 01:04:59,371
He did, Ducky.
Spike talked!

I'm so happy!

You talk-ded!
Yup, yup, yup!
You did!

1129
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,488
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us, Tickles?

1130
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:18,157
(SQUEAKING)

1131
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:23,129
Do you think we'll ever
see him again, Ali?

1132
01:05:23,162 --> 01:05:26,432
I hope so.
The land is changing.

1133
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:29,168
Maybe we'll all live
together someday.

1134

Good-bye!

1135

Good-bye! Bye, Tickles! Bye...

1136
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,035
We're home.

1137
01:06:04,803 --> 01:06:08,074
Yeah. I hope
my Grandpa's still...

1138
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:13,379
Come on, Littlefoot.
We should hurry.

1139
01:06:16,648 --> 01:06:18,517
LITTLEFOOT: Grandma?

1140
01:06:19,818 --> 01:06:21,720
Littlefoot!

1141
01:06:21,753 --> 01:06:23,722
We brought the night
flowers, Grandma.

1142
01:06:25,224 --> 01:06:26,792
Oh, Littlefoot.

1143
01:06:27,626 --> 01:06:31,029
Is... Is Grandpa... Okay?

1144
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:36,135
He's so weak.

1145
01:06:36,168 --> 01:06:39,571
Don't worry, Grandma.
The night flowers will
make him well again.

1146
01:06:39,605 --> 01:06:40,839
The Old One said so.

1147
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,774
I hope she was right.

1148
01:06:44,776 --> 01:06:47,179
And I hope
it's not too late.

1149
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:48,814
Come on! Let's hurry.

(GROWLING WEAKLY)

1151
01:06:56,188 --> 01:06:58,590
He ate as much
as he could.

1152
01:06:58,624 --> 01:07:01,059
Now, all we
can do is wait.

1153
01:07:05,464 --> 01:07:07,099
Littlefoot?

1154
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:08,434
Grandpa?

1155
01:07:13,805 --> 01:07:16,775
Well, hello there,
Littlefoot.

1156
01:07:16,808 --> 01:07:19,211
Hello yourself,
Grandpa.

1157
01:07:19,245 --> 01:07:21,247
GRANDMA: How are
you feeling, dear?

1158
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,685
Oh, much better.
I think Littlefoot's golden
flowers are working.

1159
01:07:26,718 --> 01:07:30,222
Does that mean Grandma
and I won't be leaving
the Great Valley after all?

1160
01:07:30,256 --> 01:07:31,723
That's right.

1161
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,259
Littlefoot?

1162
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:36,262
He's all right! My Grandpa's
gonna be all right!

PETRIE: Good, Littlefoot!

1165
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:43,335
(GASPS) Me think
me should be going now.

1166
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:45,437
(GASPS) You are right, Petrie.

1167
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:49,141
Our mamas and daddies
are probably very worried.

1168
01:07:49,675 --> 01:07:51,810
ALL: Bye! Bye...

1169
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,457
OLD ONE: Listen up, everyone.
We will be leaving
in just a few moments.

1170
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:13,532
Good-bye, Littlefoot.
I know we will
meet again someday.

1171
01:08:13,565 --> 01:08:15,667
I know we will, too.

1172
01:08:15,701 --> 01:08:17,536
Thanks for being
my friend, Cera.

1173
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:20,539
Oh... Hee.

1174
01:08:20,572 --> 01:08:24,243
Good-bye, Petrie.
I'm gonna miss you
a whole lot, too.

1175
01:08:25,677 --> 01:08:27,879
Aw, gee.

1176
01:08:29,548 --> 01:08:32,351
I'll miss you
and Spike, too, Ducky.

1177
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:36,322
And we will miss you very,
very much, we will.

1178
01:08:36,355 --> 01:08:37,956
But Spike talks now.

1179
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,727
So he can tell you
for himself.
Go on, little brother.

1180
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,863
ALL: Yeah, Spike!
Say something! Go on, talk.
Come on, Spike...

1182
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:53,205
Yep, yep, yep!
Spike can talk...

1183
01:08:53,239 --> 01:08:54,740
When he wants to.

1184
01:08:54,773 --> 01:08:56,508

Well, good-bye.

ALL: Good-bye!

1188
01:09:56,702 --> 01:09:59,871
ALI: (ECHOING) Maybe we'll
all live together someday...

NARRATOR:
And so it came to pass
that the migrating dinosaurs

1190
01:10:12,818 --> 01:10:16,855
left the Great Valley
for lands unknown.

1191
01:10:16,888 --> 01:10:19,825
And yes, Littlefoot,
and his friends,

1192
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:25,331
Cera, Ducky, Petrie,
and Spike, would indeed
meet Ali again one day.

1193
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:28,834
But that's another story.
