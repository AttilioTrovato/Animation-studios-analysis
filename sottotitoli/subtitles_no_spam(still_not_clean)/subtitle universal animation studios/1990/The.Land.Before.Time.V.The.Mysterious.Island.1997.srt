MALE NARRATOR:
Millions of years ago,

2
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,488
the Earth
was a very different place.

3
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:35,923
The great land masses
were ever-moving and shifting.

4
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,795
And they were covered
with exotic plants
like nothing we've ever seen.

5
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,932
This mysterious alien world

6
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:57,967
was populated
by the mightiest animals
ever to walk the Earth.

7
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,405
The dinosaurs.

8
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:14,377
These awesome giants
lived together

9
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,711
in an unforgiving,
often violent circle of life.

10
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:18,244
(LOUD BELLOWING)

11
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:21,615

the Earth had to offer.

And sometimes,
becoming a meal themselves.

(ROARING)

17
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,593
But in one wonderful place,

18
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:50,895
dinosaurs of many kinds
had learned to live together
in harmony.

19
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,532
The Great Valley.

20
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:57,566
Where there was
plenty of food for all.

21
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,000
And peace reigned supreme.

22
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,504
Well, looks like
there's only one
tree star on the tree.

23
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:08,038
Yep, yep, yep.

24
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,673
(SLURPING)

25
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:12,874
The big question
is, who gets it?

26
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:13,941
What do you mean?

27
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:17,042
It's my turn
to get the first
tree star of the day.

28
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,043
It may be the first one
of the day,

29
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:21,145
but it's the last one
on the tree.

30
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:22,879
That changes the rules.

31
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:25,847
Uh-uh.

32
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,548
I think it should go to,

33
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,982
say, the oldest.

34
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,417
But that's you.

35
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,952
I know.

36
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,052
I think it should
go to the littlerest.

37

That is me.

38
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,021

The tree star is mine.

Morning, Mr. Clubtail.
Glad you liked it.

67
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:23,008
I don't care!
That tree star
was ours.

68
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,943
You mean it was mine.

69
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,477
This never would have
happened if you...

Now, what's all the fuss about?

It's no fair.

74
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:41,084
Everybody knows
it was my turn to
get the first tree star.

75
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:43,552
And today, there was only one.

76
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,986
Thanks to these guys,
Mr. Clubtail got it.

77
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:49,122
Well, now, Littlefoot.

78

If there was only one
and not enough to go around,

79
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,791

old Mr. Clubtail got it.

often get to enjoy treats
from the top of the tree.

I imagine this was
a very special morning
for him.

I guess so.

84

our families again.

903
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:51,004
ELSIE: What's that,
young long neck?

904
01:04:51,037 --> 01:04:54,970
Got some long-lost relations
on the other side
of the pond, as we say?

905
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:56,936
Yeah.

906
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:01,069
Well, now, I might
just be able to do
something about that.

907
01:05:01,102 --> 01:05:02,334
(ALL GASPING)
Really?

908
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:08,599
Step lightly now, kiddies.
Mustn't tarry.

909
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:12,531
The herds I saw last night
might have moved on by now.

910
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:14,964
And if you're going
to be sea sick,

911
01:05:14,997 --> 01:05:17,463
let Aunt Elsie know,
so she can duck.

912
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:22,562
You sure you don't want to stay?

913
01:05:22,594 --> 01:05:24,261
You'd be safe with us.

914
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:26,560
I think.

915
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:30,493
Thanks, Chomper.

916
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:33,092
But we live
in a whole different world.

917
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,325
And we miss it.

918
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:38,923
But we'll always
be your friends.

919
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:41,157
Yeah, Chomper. Always.

920
01:05:41,189 --> 01:05:43,089
Yeah! Forever and ever.

921
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:44,022
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

922
01:05:44,055 --> 01:05:46,188
Yep, yep, yep.

923
01:05:46,221 --> 01:05:50,353
Bye now, Chomper.
We hope to see
you soon. Bye.

924
01:05:50,386 --> 01:05:53,553
DUCKY: Bye, Chomper.
We'll miss you a lot.
See you soon.

925
01:05:58,052 --> 01:06:00,384
Bye, Chomper.
Thanks for everything.

926
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:02,283
Bye-bye!
See you.
So long!

927
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:15,946
So, there I was,
just cruising along,
minding my business,

928
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,610
when I spotted
this very distinguished
old longneck on the beach.

929
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:22,045
Quite surprised I was.

930
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:23,510
That's my Grandpa!

931
01:06:23,544 --> 01:06:25,044
ELSIE: Is he now?

932
01:06:25,076 --> 01:06:28,475
So, that's where
you get your good looks.

933
01:06:28,508 --> 01:06:31,108
(GIGGLING)

934
01:06:31,142 --> 01:06:34,007
Oh, I was right
taken with him, I was.

935
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:38,639
If only he had flippers,
we would make quite a pair,
swimming about in the sea.

936
01:06:38,672 --> 01:06:41,538
Oh, I hate the sea.

937
01:06:41,572 --> 01:06:44,604
Do you, dearie?
Now that's a shame.

938
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:47,237
Because it's quite
the loveliest place to live.

939
01:06:58,267 --> 01:07:01,133
So what if we've
found enough food
to last us for years?

940
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,665
Who cares?

941
01:07:03,698 --> 01:07:07,132
If we don't have our kids,
what's the point?

942
01:07:07,164 --> 01:07:10,031
For once,
I have to agree with you.

943
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:12,229
We've got to have faith.

944
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:16,129
I know the children
will find us, somehow.

945
01:07:16,162 --> 01:07:19,128
What do you expect
them to do?
Rise up out of the ocean?

946
01:07:22,392 --> 01:07:26,058
That's... (CHUCKLES)
That's exactly
what they're going to do!

947
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,258
Grandpa!
Dad!

948
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:31,324

Cera?

951
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:39,555
Cera? Cera!

952
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:44,153
Oh, I've missed you so much!

953
01:07:44,187 --> 01:07:46,952
(ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)

954
01:07:46,985 --> 01:07:49,352
Well, we're here.
Thank goodness.

Mmm.

GRANDMA: Oh,
thank you so much!

960
01:08:35,905 --> 01:08:37,304
Goodbye.
Take care.

961
01:08:37,338 --> 01:08:39,537
Thank you so much! Thank you.
Bye now!

962
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:45,068
Goodbye and thank you so much!

963
01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:48,367
Toodle-oo!
I'll stop by soon
for a chat, shall I?

964
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:49,467
Ta-ta!

965
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:56,100
Sorry for all
the trouble
we caused, Grandpa.

966
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,898
We just wanted to find
enough food so we could
all stay together.

967
01:09:02,197 --> 01:09:04,597
And I think you succeeded.

968
01:09:04,629 --> 01:09:06,897
(GASPING)
Did you hear that?

969
01:09:06,929 --> 01:09:08,929
We succeededed.

970
01:09:08,962 --> 01:09:11,228
If we hadn't been
looking for you children,

971
01:09:11,261 --> 01:09:14,060
we never would've found
this beautiful place.

972
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:18,526
There's enough food
here for everybody.

973
01:09:18,558 --> 01:09:22,157
At least until
the Great Valley
is green again.

974
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:24,290
We not have to split up?

975
01:09:24,324 --> 01:09:26,057
We sure don't.

(CHILDREN CHEERING)

977
01:09:29,489 --> 01:09:33,354
Just as long
as we don't have to take
any more rides on Elsie.
