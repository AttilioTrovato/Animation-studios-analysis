1
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,206
A long time ago,

2
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:33,345
at least 3500 million years ago,

3
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:38,474
the earliest form of life made
its first appearance on Earth.

4
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,639
These single-celled creatures
developed and grew,

5
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:04,166
and changed a
million times over.

6
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:24,820
Until, at last, there was a
creature able to leave the sea,

7
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,293
and to crawl out
into an unknown world.

8
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:56,462
From this small,
fish-like creature

9
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,621
came hundreds of other animals.

10
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:10,300
The mightiest of
which was called...

11
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,379
The dinosaur!

12
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:30,061
For most of the
Earth's dinosaurs,

13
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,655
life was filled with danger.

14
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:43,433
But for the fortunate leaf-eating
dinosaurs of the Great Valley,

15
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,802
life was peaceful,

16
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,741
and food plentiful.

17
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,960
The Great Valley was
the perfect place for children

18
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:06,756
like Littlefoot, the long
neck, Cera, the three-horn,

19
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,459
Ducky, the swimmer,

20
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,606
Petrie, the flyer,

21
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,432
and Spike, the spike-tail,

22
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:20,045
to grow and learn

23
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:21,980
and play.
I got it!

24
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,506
Now me got it!

25
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,509
Ow! Oof!

26
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,055
Go, Spike!

27
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,714
Oh!

28
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,485
Did you get it, Spike?
Did you, huh?

29
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:44,135
Yep, yep, yep!
You got it!

30
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,439
I found another one!
I found another one!

31
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:07,650
Hi, Hyp. Can we have
our rock back, please?

32
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:12,631
Your rock? Who said
it was your rock?

33
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:15,057
Yeah, who said it was your rock, huh?
Who said? Who said?

34
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:18,394
Oh, uh, yeah!

35
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,840
Well, gee, no one.

36
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,074
We were just playing with it.

37
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,776
So give it back, Hyp!

38
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,045
But I didn't
hear you say please!

39
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,748
That's because I didn't!

40
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,753
Hey! Maybe we
can all play, together!

41
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:37,556
Good idea, Littlefoot,
we all play!

42
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,991
Yep, yep, yep!
The more the betterer!

43
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:44,596
What do ya think, guys?
Wanna play with these...

44
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,831
Babies?

45
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,089
Babies?

46
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,759
Who's he calling babies?

47
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,670
Us?

48
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:54,072
Me no baby!

49
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:57,042
Me big!

50
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,401
Yeah, big baby.

51
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,016
Me no like them.

52
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,176
Me neither, I'll show 'em!

53
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,611
Cera!

54
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,613
I'm busy!

55
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,128
Try and get us!

56
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:18,588
Yeah, try!

57
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,637
Whoa, what's that?

58
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:28,840
It's a...
Earthshake!

59
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,177
Rocks fly?

60
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:35,113
Flying rocks!

61
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,720
Daddy!

62
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,031
Mama!

63
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:54,690
Grandma! Grandpa!

64
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,941
Fly, children! Fly!

65
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,737
Run!

66
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:11,741
Littlefoot!

67
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,980
Look out!

68
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:26,532
Littlefoot...

69
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:28,299
I'm in here, Grandma.

70
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,825
Are you all right, little one?

71
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,306
Would you like to come out now?

72
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,277
Gee. That wasn't a regular
kind of earthshake, was it?

73
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:41,647
No, Littlefoot, it wasn't.

74
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,148
Then what kind was it?

75
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,184
We don't know, Littlefoot.

76
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,211
Perhaps it had to do with those
great rocks falling from the sky.

77
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,257
Oh, yeah! I saw 'em!

78
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:55,627
And I saw that big one land
somewhere in the Mysterious Beyond!

79
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:58,063
I sure wish we could go find it!

80
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:01,633
Yes, that would be an
adventure now, wouldn't it?

81
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:04,936
Well I think we've had enough
adventure for one day.

82
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,963
Come. It's time to settle
down for the night.

83
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,012
It's beautiful,
isn't it, Grandpa?

84
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,805
Oh, yes, Littlefoot,

85
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:20,318
beautiful and mysterious,

86
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:23,689
as is so much in our world.

87
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:27,216
Well, at least
the danger has passed.

88
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,084
Huh?

89
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:09,668
What? Look,
everyone! Where did the water go?

90
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:10,969
It stopped flowing!

91
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,638
How can that be?

92
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:15,006
What will we do without water?

93
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,733
Grandpa? Why did the
Thundering Falls stop?

94
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:23,014
I don't know,
Littlefoot, I don't know.

95
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:25,884
Littlefoot, go and play.

96
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:27,710
Grandpa and I must talk
with the other grown-ups.

97
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,779
Sure, Grandma!

98
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:35,293
See ya later, Grandpa!

99
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,252
This has never happened before!

100
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:40,956
Hey, guys!

101
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:49,708
Guess what happened
to the Thundering Falls?

102
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:52,410
Shhh! We are trying
to find Cera.

103
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:54,003
She has hided from us.

104
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,047
But...

105
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,284
Uh! Me no find
Cera anywhere!

106
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,886
Guess what, Petrie?

107
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,812
What? You no
find Cera either?

108
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:08,193
Cera is a very good
hider, she is!

109
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,262
Boo!

110
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:16,768
I scared you,
I scared you! I did!

111
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:20,839
You no scare me, Cera.
Me un-scareable!

112
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:23,441
Petrie? You're
hurting my nose.

113
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:26,044
Oh, sorry.

114
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:27,302
Me no know my own strength.

115
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,706
Now who's going to hide?

116
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,318
Littlefoot?

117
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,321
Okay, but first I wanna
tell you something!

118
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,913
Well, hurry it up,
we wanna play!

119
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,859
I saw...

120
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,151
Uh... Hey!

121
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:47,365
Spike is taking your
turn for you, Littlefoot.

122
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:03,172
My brother is not
a very good hider, oh no.

123
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,218
Now just what were you
going to say, Littlefoot?

124
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:10,321
It's the Thundering Falls!
It's not giving us any water!

125
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,480
You gotta come see!

126
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,493
Why don't you hatchlings
go run and see?

127
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:17,853
Yeah! Run and see!
Run and see!

128
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:23,292
Oh...

129
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,961
Uhh, yeah!

130
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,375
Try and make us!

131
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,510
No, Cera, no!

132
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,069
Oh, don't worry,
I won't hurt 'em...

133
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:36,906
Much!

134
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:38,140
Nyah!

135
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,185
Nyah!

136
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:41,911
Put those away.

137
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,882
How come all you ever
wanna do is fight, Hyp?

138
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,060
Yeah, fight!

139
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:55,233
Ow! Fighting hurt.

140
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,402
Yeah, it does
give ya ow-ees, Hyp.

141
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,037
Why do we do it?

142
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:00,138
Why?

143
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:02,040
Why?

144
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:04,976
Because we're bigger!
And bigger is smarter!

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,211
Bigger is meaner!

146
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,003
And bigger is better.

147
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:16,587
When you're big You can push

148
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,981
All the little ones around

149
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,960
They're looking up

150
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,395
While you are looking down

151
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,932
You can snap a tree in two

152
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:30,301
Like it was just a twig

153
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,828
Things are better
When you're big

154
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,273

All the rules that
grown-ups make

157

They don't apply to you

158
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:47,085

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,915
Things are better when you're
big Sha, la, la, la, la, la...

185
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,517
Ooh...
When you're big

186
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,254
Sha, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, ooh...

187
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,590
When you're big Sha, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

188
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:03,152
When you're big

189
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,604
But Hyp, when you're all grown up,
you won't be very big at all.

190
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:17,275
Yeah! Your kind
never gets very big.

191
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:21,479
When we grow up,
we'll be much bigger!

192
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:26,451
Uh-huh, uh-huh, much,
much, much, much bigger!

193
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:30,721
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna see
to it that you never grow up!

194
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,059
Uh, yeah!
Never grow up, never!

195
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,185
Uh, how are ya
gonna do that, Hyp?

196
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,732
Sheesh, you're dumb!
Lemme lay it out for you.

197
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,669
First we chase 'em,
second, we catch 'em!

198
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,438
Third, we hurt 'em! See?

199
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:49,999
Uh, no, Hyp, I don't see.

200
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:51,642
Anybody.

201
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,078
Me neither.

202
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,646
What?

203
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,539
C'mon! Pound 'em later!

204
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:15,090
As you all can see, our
Valley is quickly drying up.

205
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,470
Yes, we see it
and feel it as well!

206
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:21,639
There is less and less
water to drink!

207
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:24,075
And green food to eat!

208
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:28,713
I know. That is why our
herds must work together,

209
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:32,450
to save the little water
we have left.

210
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:37,155
From now on, we must drink
only what we need to survive,

211
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,590
and no more.

212
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:43,018
Hopefully, soon the Thundering
Falls will bring us water again.

213
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,486
If not,

214
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,067
we may have to
leave the Great Valley.

215
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:51,102
Leave the Great Valley?

216
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:53,571
Never! It's our home!

217
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:56,174
Then, until the water returns,

218
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,545
we must not use the water
we have left unwisely.

219
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:03,681
Three-horns never
use water unwisely,

220
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,650
but your herds do!

221
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:10,288
Our herds? What makes you think
our herds would do such a thing?

222
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:13,182
You drink greedily with
no concern for others!

223
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,318
Can you believe
he's saying that?

224
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:22,191
Well I've seen
three-horns waste!

225
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,369
What?

226
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:27,305
You take long baths even if
you're the least bit dirty!

227
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,574
And, I've seen kind waste too!

228
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:32,743
Splashing water
needlessly. For shame!

229
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,712
Impossible! I never did
such a thing!

230
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:53,231
Hey! Let's play bullies.

231
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,865
I'll be Hyp!

232
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,268
I'm gonna get you!

233
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,370
Not if I get you first!

234
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,216
Me wanna play bullies too!

235
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,519
Hey, hatchling!
You no eat my green food!

236
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:22,827
Humph! Me go play
bullies someplace else!

237
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:23,852
Oh!

238
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,760
Petrie, you are flyer,
not a swimmer!

239
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:36,198
Me no bully either.

240
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,467
But I am!

241
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:44,215
Aww!
Not again!

242
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,808
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

243
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:49,587
It them!

244
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,623
Thought you hatchlings could
play in our swimming hole, huh?

245
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:56,394
They're beginning
to get on my nerves.

246
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,763
Can we teach 'em a lesson, Hyp, huh?
Can we, huh?

247
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,798
Be my guest, Nod!

248
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:03,858
Run!

249
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:05,670
Ugh!

250
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:15,337
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

251
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:20,185
This is not funny!

252
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:21,952
Now, someone splashed me,

253
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,678
and wasted precious water!

254
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:28,683
Huh? Littlefoot!
Are you all right?

255
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:30,585
Uh-huh,

256
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,621
but I think I'm in trouble.

257
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,626
Your Littlefoot is
guilty of wasting water!

258
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,941
What happened, Littlefoot?

259
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:46,711
It was an accident,
Grandpa, honest.

260
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,403
I'm sure it was, Littlefoot.

261
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:55,753
Our children don't understand
the water problem.

262
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:59,390
The Great Valley has always given
them everything they need.

263
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:01,392
What are those grown-ups
talking about?

264
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,361
What water problem?

265
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:05,463
Isn't the Thundering
Falls coming back?

266
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,964
I don't know.

267
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:09,567
Well it should!
Why wouldn't it?

268
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,826
Maybe it is tired
and needs to rest.

269
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,376
We need to teach our
children how to use

270
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,511
the remaining water wisely.

271
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,680
Speak for yourself, long neck!

272
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,316
My Cera would never waste!

273
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,309
Your Littlefoot
is a bad influence!

274
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,278
That's not true!

275
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,658
What is in-flu-ence?

276
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,960
Me no know.

277
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:39,321
Come, Cera. You're not to play
with the little long neck anymore.

278
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,458
But, Daddy!

279
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:48,506
My friend, I think
you're acting rashly.

280
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,708
Littlefoot is not to blame.

281
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,311
I said come, Cera!

282
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:54,336
No!

283
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,047
Cera!

284
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm your father and I
know what's best for you!

285
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:17,968
Petrie?
It's time to go home!

286
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,695
Oh... Bye, bye.
Coming, mamma!

287
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,265
Come, Ducky!
Spike, you too.

288
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,512
Do not worry, Littlefoot.

289
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:30,014
You are not
an in-flu-ence,

290
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:31,306
whatever that is.

291
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,428
I don't understand, Grandpa.

292
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,819
Why does Cera's dad
think I'm bad?

293
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:49,934
Oh, he's just
confused, Littlefoot.

294
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,528
Sometimes fear makes
grown-ups do strange things.

295
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:59,610
I don't understand, Daddy!

296
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,380
You need friends
who know how to behave!

297
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,582
Especially in times like this.

298
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:07,742
Littlefoot is my friend!
He'll always be my friend!

299
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:10,555
Cera, I'm your father.

300
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,890
I want what's best for you.

301
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:15,550
No you don't! You just don't
want me to have any fun!

302
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,522
Cera, please.
I'm just trying to...

303
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:23,868
Oh, as a parent I...

304
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,093
Ugh!

305
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:37,539
Time to wake up, my little one.

306
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,521
But Grandma, it's early,

307
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:45,656
and I'm still sleepy.

308
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,625
You must get up, Littlefoot,

309
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,551
if you want to drink
the morning dew with us.

310
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,530
The morning dew?

311
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:55,356
Yes, it collects on the
leaves in the early morning.

312
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:01,906
If we hurry,
we can drink the dew

313
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,600
before the Bright Circle gets too
high in the sky and dries it all up.

314
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,504
Oh, all right.

315
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,725
Here, Littlefoot, drink this.

316
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:23,485
I think you'll
find it delicious.

317
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,170
Oops. It... It broke.

318
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,606
It's not your fault, Littlefoot.

319
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,108
The treestars are very dry now,

320
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:39,810
and crumble easily.

321
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,573
But when will everything be
green and wet again, Grandma?

322
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,510
I don't know, I hope soon.

323
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,084
Well, what's going to
happen if it's not soon?

324
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:01,031
Water will get harder
and harder to find.

325
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:04,669
Soon, everything will be
as dry as that treestar.

326
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,628
And it will be easier
for fires to start.

327
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,639
Fire?

328
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:10,675
Yes, Littlefoot,

329
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:13,968
which is why you must remember the
escape paths we've shown you.

330
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,606
Don't worry, Grandma,
I'll remember!

331
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,604
I think we're in luck!

332
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:29,219
There's still quite a few
green treestars left here.

333
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:31,179
Come on, then, let's eat.

334
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,682
Yeah, let's eat!

335
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:43,992
These don't look too good,
but I sure am hungry.

336
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:01,009
They taste terrible!

337
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:12,296
Here, Littlefoot, try these.

338
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,922
They're still very green.

339
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:23,307
Thanks, Grandpa!
Go on, Littlefoot, eat up.

340
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,309
But... What about you?

341
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,144
Don't you want some?

342
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:30,672
Thank you, Littlefoot, but
Grandpa and I will be fine.

343
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,951
Yes, you're still growing.

344
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:37,345
You need the very best
green food we can find.

345
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,014
Well... Okay.

346
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:53,403
That was good!
But I sure am thirsty.

347
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,863
When is it our turn for water?

348
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:03,271
Our turn for water is when the bright
circle touches the smoking mountain.

349
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:08,018
But if you are thirsty...

350
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,287
I think you can
have a drink now.

351
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:13,223
After all, we never agreed
that the children

352
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:15,349
should have the same water
restrictions as the elders.

353
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,853
Oh, boy! Water!

354
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,172
It's not your time
to drink, long necks!

355
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:31,108
What do you mean,
"Not our time"?

356
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:35,680
We agreed that all herds must take
turns drinking at the watering hole.

357
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:39,750
Yes, we all agreed, but I didn't
think that it included the children!

358
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:42,052
It really isn't fair to them.

359
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:44,855
There is no fair when
it comes to survival!

360
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,435
When life is tough

361
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,470
You've gotta be tougher

362
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,663
If you want to stay alive

363
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,375
When the trail gets rough

364
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,411
You've gotta get rougher

365
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:10,748
To help your family survive

366
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:13,842
You can't run around in circles

367
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:16,778
Wondering what to do

368
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:21,425
Someone's gotta be
The voice of reason

369
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:24,829
Is it you, or you, or you?

370
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:29,299
When things around us
are going bad

371
00:27:29,323 --> 00:27:31,760
We all better be strong

372
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:36,140
We could lose everything we have

373
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:39,209
If this goes on too long

374
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:42,913
Don't stand around here talking

375
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:46,350
I say "That's not enough!"

376
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,944
No tears, no sighs
Don't close your eyes

377
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:54,849
We've gotta stand tough

378
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:01,198
I used to hear my father say

379
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:05,069
"Stand and fight Don't run away"

380
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:07,938
He made me what I am today

381
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:09,764
I'm here

382
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:13,067
And I'm tough

383
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:19,016
When times are hard
You better be harder

384
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,486
You don't know what's in store

385
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,323
You think you're smart?
You've gotta be smarter

386
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:28,349
Than you ever were before

387
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:33,297
You say I'm mean
You say "Why bother?"

388
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:36,967
Well, I have a daughter
And I'm her father

389
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:40,829
I'm gonna make sure
We all have water enough

390
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:44,899
That's why I'm tough

391
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,236
I'm standing tough

392
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:52,040
We've got to stand tough

393
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,853
You don't like it?

394
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:56,911
Tough.

395
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:11,893
Littlefoot!

396
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,270
Huh?

397
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:14,095
Over here!

398
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,907
Hurry!

399
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:19,476
You judge us wrongly,
three-horn!

400
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,879
I'm only doing
what needs to be done!

401
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:24,381
But this is going too far.

402
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:27,617
Oh, what are we going to do about
the grown-ups, Littlefoot?

403
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,043
They're acting like babies!

404
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:32,022
I know.

405
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:34,491
And it's all the Thundering
Falls' fault too!

406
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:37,018
If we had more water, this
wouldn't be happening!

407
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:39,029
That's it, Cera!

408
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:41,265
What's it?
Water!

409
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:44,534
If we find some, the grown-ups
will stop being mad!

410
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,537
Maybe, except for my dad.

411
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:49,163
He's always mad.

412
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:53,201
Yeah, he is kinda grumpy.

413
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,415
But I'm sure it's just because
he's so worried about the water!

414
00:29:58,439 --> 00:30:00,885
Yeah. Anyway,

415
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:03,577
let's go get Petrie, Ducky and
Spike and find some water!

416
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:10,194
How about a compromise?
No! We must be firm!

417
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:12,053
Can't we agree on anything?

418
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:21,305
Are we all here?

419
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:23,864
Yep, yep, yep, we are all here!

420
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,979
Oh, no, we are not.

421
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:30,514
Where is Spike?

422
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,141
Well, don't ask me,
he's not my brother!

423
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:38,388
Oh, Spike! Where are
you, little brother!

424
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:44,494
What that?

425
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:46,696
It sound like monster!

426
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,500
Do not worry, Petrie,
that is not a monster,

427
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:51,525
that is Spike!

428
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,071
Spike?

429
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:57,465
That is his sleeping sound.
Come on, I will show you.

430
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,981
See!

431
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:06,116
You're right, Ducky!

432
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:12,189
Get up, silly!

433
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:15,183
This is not nap time,
this is get up time!

434
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,955
You wake up now, okay, Spike?

435
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:28,272
Oh, Spike up!

436
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:30,664
Ugh! Spike down.

437
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:33,443
Spike, no!

438
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:35,503
Ow!

439
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:41,151
Are you okay, Petrie?

440
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:42,452
Uh-huh.

441
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:45,146
Spike sure heavy sleeper.

442
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:55,099
We gotta wake him up because it's gonna
take all of us to find more water.

443
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:57,691
Water? Yes,
me help find water!

444
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:04,065
Spike, stop!
Me no find water yet!

445
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,214
Don't worry, Spike.
We'll find it. I just know we will.

446
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:14,118
We'd better! Because if our
parents stay mad any longer,

447
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,619
I'm just going to scream!

448
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,755
Oh, I will scream too!

449
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,025
Petrie good screamer!

450
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:25,029
Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!

451
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:27,031
What about you, Spike?

452
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,684
How we find water, Littlefoot?

453
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:49,177
We smell for it, silly.

454
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,622
Oh, yes!

455
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:55,225
Smell for it!
With our noses!

456
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,518
I know how to do that.

457
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,371
No smell so hard, okay, Spike?

458
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:26,690
This is serious, Ducky!

459
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:31,419
Oh yes, Cera, I know!
I know!

460
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,602
It's not your turn!

461
00:34:18,532 --> 00:34:19,733
Now, go on!

462
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,740
Hmph!

463
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:34,158
My sniffer is very,
very sniffed out.

464
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:37,294
Well I'm so thirsty
I could drink a lake.

465
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:39,387
Me too.
If we could find one.

466
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,558
Funny, me smell water
but me no see water.

467
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,376
Did you hear a splash?

468
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,411
Uh-huh!

469
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:58,482
Water!
All right, water!

470
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:00,241
Woo-hoo! Yippee!

471
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:13,254
Mmm.

472
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,358
Mmm!
That was so good!

473
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:24,408
Oh yes! This is the
yummiest water ever! It is!

474
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:27,301
And we drink all we want
and no one yell at us!

475
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:31,439
Ah!

476
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:45,229
There they are. And would ya
look at what they found for us.

477
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:47,421
Yeah. What is it?

478
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,334
Hi ya, hatchlings.
Huh?

479
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,402
Say bye, bye water.

480
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:55,439
Why?
Is it going somewhere?

481
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:57,407
No, but you are!

482
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:58,942
This is our water now!

483
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,810
So give it back!

484
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:03,780
Give back? But it
already in my tummy!

485
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:06,483
But do you not want to share?

486
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:09,586
We don't share with anybody.
Do we?

487
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,021
Uh, no. Na-uh!
Nobody!

488
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,291
So I'm warning you, small fries!

489
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,025
If you tell anybody else
about this water,

490
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,963
you'll be very, very, sorry!

491
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:23,467
We're telling! And you
better not try and stop us!

492
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:25,426
Ahhh!

493
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:26,927
Hurry!

494
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,368
Get 'em!
We can't let 'em tell!

495
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:39,283
What am I running for?
I'm not of afraid of those...

496
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:40,641
Hey!
What's the big idea?

497
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,920
No time to fight bullies, Cera!

498
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:45,546
We go tell grown-ups
about water!

499
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:48,558
Where'd they go, Hyp?
Huh?

500
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,059
Where'd they go?

501
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,996
If I knew, I
wouldn't be looking for 'em!

502
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,664
Yeah!

503
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:55,989
Yeah!
Dummy!

504
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:00,737
Uh-oh!

505
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,706
Ahhh!

506
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:08,569
Keep running!

507
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,583
Are they still after us?

508
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,043
Me no know! Me too
scared to look!

509
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:24,518
Spike! You are going
the wrong way!

510
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,520
Whoa!

511
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:36,330
Hooray! Now you are
going the right way!

512
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:41,678
Why are we going this
way anyway, Littlefoot?

513
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:44,013
We're tired and this
way is hard!

514
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:47,817
Because! This is the shortest
way back to the grownups!

515
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:49,810
And it'll be harder for
the bullies to follow us!

516
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:01,054
Ahhh!

517
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:21,551
It is the Mysterious Beyond.

518
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:24,478
And it have water.
Whole bunches!

519
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:42,171
The flying rocks musta caused slides
in the Mysterious Beyond, too.

520
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:46,142
Yeah, and those dumb slides
blocked up our water!

521
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,945
C'mon! The grown-ups
will know what to do!

522
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,512
Whoa!

523
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:01,582
Bad weather for flying.

524
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:09,490
Look out!

525
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,771
Back this way!
I know another path!

526
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,998
Ahhh!

527
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:53,667
Ahhh!

528
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:57,681
That's enough!

529
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:00,083
You've had your share for today!

530
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:04,187
The Three-horn is getting
far too bossy. I agree.

531
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:07,223
Grandpa! Grandma!
Daddy!

532
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:09,225
Fire! There's fire
in the Valley!

533
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:11,060
Are you sure, Littlefoot?

534
00:40:11,084 --> 00:40:13,721
Yes, Grandpa! It's
near Two Boulder Pass!

535
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:18,802
Yes, we can see the
fire signs from here!

536
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:21,571
Two Boulder Pass?
That's close to here!

537
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:23,072
We must run!

538
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:26,142
Calm yourselves! We will
lead you to safety!

539
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:29,637
No, I will! They'll be
better off following me!

540
00:40:37,244 --> 00:40:40,690
This way!
Hmph!

541
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:44,561
But you're heading downwind where
the fire will surely spread!

542
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:47,731
We must go upwind of the fire!

543
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:51,935
Do as you will, long neck! But Cera
and I go this way! Come, Cera!

544
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,202
But Daddy!

545
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:55,238
The others can do
what they want!

546
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:57,931
But you are my daughter
and you will do as I say!

547
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:07,083
I'm... I'm...

548
00:41:07,107 --> 00:41:08,709
I'm going with my father.

549
00:41:14,615 --> 00:41:19,262
I do not feel good about this.
Oh no, I do not.

550
00:41:19,286 --> 00:41:22,932
Grandma! Grandpa!
Can't you stop them?

551
00:41:22,956 --> 00:41:25,802
I have to go after them.
Yes.

552
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:29,806
Littlefoot, you come with me.
We'll lead the others to safety.

553
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,609
But what about everybody
else in the Valley, Grandma?

554
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,143
What will happen to them?

555
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,970
They'll use the escape routes
closest to them. Now come!

556
00:41:37,905 --> 00:41:39,716
Everyone follow me!

557
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,217
Children first!

558
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:00,060
Ahhh!

559
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:16,710
Ahhh!

560
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:21,715
Ahhh!

561
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:25,686
Cera!

562
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,345
Grandma!
What's wrong?

563
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:44,738
The smoke is too thick!
You'll have to lead!

564
00:42:46,974 --> 00:42:47,841
But, I...

565
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,647
Follow me, everyone!

566
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:04,624
I can't see!

567
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:14,443
Littlefoot, the grown-ups cannot see good.
They cannot.

568
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,346
But they can hear.
Follow my voice!

569
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,949
And stay close to the
one in front of you.

570
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:22,642
Keep your heads down.
It's not much further!

571
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,936
Are you sure
this is right, Daddy?

572
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,361
Of course, I'm sure!

573
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:46,275
Ahhh! Daddy!

574
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:47,434
This way, Cera!

575
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,846
Ahhh!

576
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:50,804
No!

577
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:00,347
Ahhh!

578
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:02,325
We're trapped!

579
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,160
Three-horns!

580
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,685
Over here!

581
00:44:12,793 --> 00:44:13,994
Hurry, Cera!

582
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:42,990
Are you all right, Cera?
Yes, Daddy.

583
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:44,892
Come.

584
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,966
Grandpa!

585
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,002
Oh, they made it!

586
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:21,070
I was so worried!

587
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:22,996
I'm fine, dear, really.

588
00:45:27,134 --> 00:45:29,178
How is everyone else?

589
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:30,904
Our group got here safely.

590
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:33,983
Thanks to Littlefoot.

591
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:36,276
Oh, yes! Thanks to Littlefoot!

592
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:40,914
We are all very lucky.

593
00:45:41,214 --> 00:45:42,859
Lucky?

594
00:45:42,883 --> 00:45:45,886
How can you say we are lucky
when our Valley burns?

595
00:45:47,587 --> 00:45:50,390
We are without water and
now we are without a home.

596
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,270
All is lost.

597
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:57,140
All is not lost, my friend.

598
00:45:57,164 --> 00:46:02,946
You still have Cera. And you are
still here, able to care for her.

599
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,972
Oh, you are right.

600
00:46:05,873 --> 00:46:07,140
Thank you, long neck.

601
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,520
But the three-horn
speaks the truth!

602
00:46:11,544 --> 00:46:13,289
We're doomed!

603
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,591
We'll never be able to go
back to the Great Valley!

604
00:46:15,615 --> 00:46:19,853
Never go back to the Great Valley?
Oh, no!

605
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,032
The water!

606
00:46:23,056 --> 00:46:25,068
We forgot to tell
them about the water!

607
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:27,937
Grandma! Grandpa!
We found water!

608
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:29,172
Water?

609
00:46:29,196 --> 00:46:32,141
Where, Littlefoot?
It's stuck!

610
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,043
Behind the Thundering Falls!

611
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:35,444
The flying rocks did it.

612
00:46:35,468 --> 00:46:37,180
They did!

613
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:38,915
Which means...

614
00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:41,951
The water is trapped in
the Mysterious Beyond.

615
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:43,519
The Mysterious Beyond?

616
00:46:43,543 --> 00:46:45,088
We can't go there!

617
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:48,124
It's dangerous!
Of course, it's dangerous!

618
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:52,028
But no place is safe now! We
must go and free the water!

619
00:46:52,052 --> 00:46:54,563
But such a huge
gathering place of water

620
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:57,566
will attract other creatures
besides ourselves.

621
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:01,137
In the Mysterious Beyond
there will be sharpteeth.

622
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:04,040
Sharpteeth!

623
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:07,410
I do not like sharpteeth.
Oh, no.

624
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:09,979
Their teeth are too sharp.

625
00:47:10,003 --> 00:47:12,415
Still, we must do something.

626
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:15,251
We must come up with a
plan to free the water.

627
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,053
I have a plan!

628
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:19,588
I hope it's better than
your fire escape plan!

629
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:24,160
Please! This is
no time to argue.

630
00:47:24,184 --> 00:47:26,129
At least I had a plan!

631
00:47:28,956 --> 00:47:31,267
Stop! You're acting
like children!

632
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:34,037
Huh! We
no act like that!

633
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:36,272
I have a plan, too.

634
00:47:36,296 --> 00:47:39,008
1 Mine's better!
2 Listen to mine!

635
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:41,177
I'd sure like to get
to that water first!

636
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,546
Before the rest of those
dummies go slobbering in it.

637
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,515
But you heard
the grown-ups, Hyp.

638
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:48,151
What about sharpteeth?

639
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:49,685
What about 'em?

640
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:52,055
Well...
You tell him, Mutt!

641
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,025
Huh, well...
Well, uh... they're bad.

642
00:47:56,049 --> 00:47:59,963
Uh, yeah!
And scary too!

643
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:03,032
Come on, you're just
afraid of 'em as we are!

644
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:05,668
Me? I'm not afraid of anything!

645
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:08,237
Bet you are!
Bet I'm not!

646
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,074
You were afraid of those
big flying rocks!

647
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:14,210
I was not! I just ran
cuz you guys did.

648
00:48:14,234 --> 00:48:17,104
I didn't
want you to feel stupid!

649
00:48:18,571 --> 00:48:20,449
Well, then.
Prove it!

650
00:48:20,473 --> 00:48:24,187
All right, I will. I'm
getting me some tasty water!

651
00:48:24,211 --> 00:48:26,146
And you babies can stay here!

652
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,592
Well, I'm not a baby!

653
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,594
Yeah.
Me neither.

654
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,762
Uh, Hyp!
Wait!

655
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,065
Ah, yeah!
For us!

656
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:38,401
1 We must act now!

657
00:48:38,425 --> 00:48:40,693
2 We must not act rashly.

658
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:44,073
They are so dumb!

659
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:46,609
Didn't they hear what the
grown-ups said about sharpteeth?

660
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,444
I guess not.

661
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,780
Well, if they get eaten
it'll just serve them right!

662
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,118
Cera!
That is not nice!

663
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:58,487
I don't care.
They deserve it!

664
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:02,058
Uh, I don't know you guys.
Maybe we should do something.

665
00:49:02,082 --> 00:49:03,183
Like what?

666
00:49:03,516 --> 00:49:05,094
Like...

667
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:07,263
Tell their parents
where they went?

668
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:10,133
All of our parents
are too busy arguing!

669
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,635
Your plan is too dangerous!

670
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,303
1 Yours is no better!

671
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,072
2 Then listen to mine!

672
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:18,141
Yours? Don't be silly!

673
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:20,776
Then... Maybe we
should go stop them.

674
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,212
Us?
Stop them?

675
00:49:23,236 --> 00:49:26,115
They hate us!
They will not listen!

676
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,750
I know, they're bigger.

677
00:49:27,774 --> 00:49:29,609
But, definitely not smarter.

678
00:49:31,111 --> 00:49:34,757
Still, we have to try!
But why?

679
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:37,760
They have feelings
just like we do

680
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:40,429
They have problems too

681
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:43,590
We think because
they're big they don't

682
00:49:44,424 --> 00:49:46,302
But they do

683
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:49,305
They're louder
and they're stronger

684
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:52,308
And they make a bigger fuss

685
00:49:52,332 --> 00:49:56,069
But way down deep inside I think

686
00:49:56,736 --> 00:49:59,339
They're kids like us

687
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:07,556
They have parents just like ours

688
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,693
Who tell them what to do

689
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,496
They have feet
and tails and horns

690
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,365
And scale and noses too

691
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,368
And when the earth is shaking

692
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:22,571
They run and hide because

693
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:25,798
Even if they think they're tough

694
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:30,069
They're still kids like us

695
00:50:31,138 --> 00:50:33,549
It's just too
dangerous, Littlefoot.

696
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,551
Yes, it is.

697
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,586
And they're too mean.

698
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,579
Very, very mean.

699
00:50:40,547 --> 00:50:43,426
Maybe when you're bigger

700
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,329
You think you should pretend

701
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:49,598
You're not afraid
of scary things

702
00:50:49,622 --> 00:50:52,501
That you don't need a friend

703
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:55,404
But they're just kids in trouble

704
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:58,641
They need someone to trust

705
00:50:58,665 --> 00:51:02,211
If we can bring them home

706
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:04,880
Show them they're not alone

707
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:07,774
That they're just kids

708
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:11,744
Kids like us

709
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:17,617
I just have to try
and stop them.

710
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:20,787
You guys do what you want.

711
00:51:25,492 --> 00:51:27,870
Last one after Littlefoot
is a scaredy-egg!

712
00:51:27,894 --> 00:51:29,638
Me no scaredy-egg.

713
00:51:29,662 --> 00:51:33,576
Wait for us! We are not
scaredy-eggs either!

714
00:51:53,953 --> 00:51:56,432
Are ya sure this is the right
way to the water, Hyp?

715
00:51:56,456 --> 00:51:58,367
Sure, I'm sure!

716
00:51:58,391 --> 00:52:01,404
I'm, uh, just taking
us this special way

717
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:03,939
so we don't run
into any stupid sharpteeth.

718
00:52:11,804 --> 00:52:13,306
Wait for me!

719
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:17,986
C'mon, guys!
Wait!

720
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,613
Ah-Ah-Ahhh!

721
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,884
Stop whining, Mutt!
This is easy!

722
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,321
Uh...

723
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:36,539
Well whaddya know!

724
00:52:36,563 --> 00:52:39,875
A little watering hole.
Just for me!

725
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:42,611
Ow!
You guys can have some.

726
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:43,870
If I leave any!

727
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:47,774
Woo-hoo!
Water!

728
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,448
Huh?

729
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:56,992
I'm sinking!

730
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:58,761
I'm sinking!

731
00:52:58,785 --> 00:53:01,397
Don't just stand there!
Pull me out!

732
00:53:01,421 --> 00:53:04,600
Oh, yeah! Uh, right!
Whadda we do?

733
00:53:04,624 --> 00:53:06,769
I dunno. Whaddya
think we should do?

734
00:53:06,793 --> 00:53:08,804
Somebody do something!

735
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:09,872
Help!

736
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,964
Help!
That's Hyp!

737
00:53:13,766 --> 00:53:16,445
Get me out!
Get me out!

738
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:18,381
You pull him out!
But what if I get stuck?

739
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:19,548
Then I'll pull you out!

740
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,350
But what if you get stuck?

741
00:53:21,374 --> 00:53:22,951
He's stuck in a tar pit!

742
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:25,621
Stop moving, Hyp!
It'll only make you sink faster!

743
00:53:26,946 --> 00:53:28,324
We'll have to pull him out!

744
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:29,549
Everybody line up!

745
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,733
Okay! When me say 'Pull.' Pull!

746
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:43,863
Hey! You're squishing me! Sorry.

747
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:45,965
Ya-ha!

748
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:48,301
Petrie!

749
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:50,002
Pull!

750
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:59,722
Are ya, are ya okay, Hyp?
Are ya?

751
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:03,359
Of course I'm okay!
I was never not okay!

752
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:05,861
He a big, fat, fibber!

753
00:54:05,885 --> 00:54:08,721
Yeah! We helped you
and you know it!

754
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:14,737
I don't need anybody's help!
Not now, not ever!

755
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:18,707
DUCKY But everyone needs
help some time. They do!

756
00:54:18,731 --> 00:54:19,808
Ha!

757
00:54:19,832 --> 00:54:21,067
Ahhh!

758
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:25,905
Help!

759
00:54:30,877 --> 00:54:32,545
There they are!

760
00:54:33,946 --> 00:54:35,391
Littlefoot?

761
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:38,494
This is no time to go exploring!

762
00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:42,498
Didn't you realize you wandered
into the Mysterious Beyond?

763
00:54:42,522 --> 00:54:44,767
We weren't exploring, Grandpa.

764
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:48,136
We were trying to stop the bullies,
um, I mean Hyp and his friends,

765
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,562
or they mighta gotten hurt!

766
00:54:52,432 --> 00:54:54,543
Hyp! Here we are
chasing after you

767
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:57,780
when we should be finding
a way to free the water!

768
00:54:57,804 --> 00:55:00,106
I thought I told you to
stay where it was safe!

769
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:06,722
Don't look at me that way!

770
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:08,681
I'm your father and I
know what's best for you!

771
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:16,599
Yelling is no way to teach
your child what is right.

772
00:55:16,623 --> 00:55:18,401
Or to show that you care.

773
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:19,968
How would you know?

774
00:55:19,992 --> 00:55:21,528
I know because...

775
00:55:22,562 --> 00:55:25,474
Because I have a daughter.

776
00:55:25,498 --> 00:55:29,445
And I yell at her, too much.

777
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:31,780
Especially when I'm
worried for her safety.

778
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:34,583
You don't have to worry
about me, Daddy.

779
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:37,085
If you always react with anger,

780
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:39,822
that's all your son will know.

781
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:42,882
And, that's all he'll be
able to express to others.

782
00:55:47,954 --> 00:55:49,498
What?

783
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:52,635
I know now that we can't
live together that way.

784
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:54,937
With such anger between us.

785
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:58,106
Our kids found water because
they worked together.

786
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,099
Now we must work together too.

787
00:56:01,033 --> 00:56:03,612
At last, we all agree.

788
00:56:05,805 --> 00:56:08,551
Oh! What's the matter with you?

789
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:12,788
Nothin', except
I think we're in trouble.

790
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:14,614
Yeah, so what else is new?

791
00:56:15,682 --> 00:56:16,992
That!

792
00:56:21,621 --> 00:56:23,122
And that!

793
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:47,547
Children!
Stay behind me!

794
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:54,120
And me!
Come at us in two!

795
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,666
Littlefoot! You and your
friends run to safety!

796
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:24,851
Through here, kids!
Follow me!

797
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,639
Grandpa!

798
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,164
Don't look back!
C'mon!

799
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,805
We can't let them pass!

800
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,288
They've gone after the children!

801
00:58:11,598 --> 00:58:13,700
Stay close! We're
going to get help!

802
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:37,089
Stop where you are, sharpteeth!

803
00:58:39,692 --> 00:58:41,093
They're leaving!

804
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:43,095
Yes, but why?

805
00:58:49,101 --> 00:58:51,170
Something bad
is happening up there!

806
00:58:52,271 --> 00:58:54,116
Ahhh!

807
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,742
Stop you babies!

808
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,287
Me first!

809
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:00,680
Hyp!

810
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:03,850
Look!

811
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,733
Oh, no!
Daddy!

812
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,891
Grandpa!

813
00:59:29,742 --> 00:59:32,821
You kids get to the top of
that dam where it's safer!

814
00:59:32,845 --> 00:59:34,857
But what about
the grown-ups?

815
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:36,716
Just get outta here!
I'll handle this!

816
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:39,051
C'mon!

817
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:56,411
Look at your
dad risking his neck.

818
00:59:56,435 --> 00:59:58,113
Yeah, what a dope.

819
00:59:58,137 --> 00:59:59,138
He is not!

820
01:00:00,439 --> 01:00:02,217
Dad!

821
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:04,687
Nyah! Nyah!
Can't get me!

822
01:00:04,711 --> 01:00:05,878
Son!

823
01:00:07,046 --> 01:00:08,347
Waa!

824
01:00:17,356 --> 01:00:18,867
The grown-ups
are all right!

825
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:22,661
I'm outta here!

826
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:36,251
That serves sharp tooth right!

827
01:00:36,275 --> 01:00:39,846
He bigger bully than you!
Hey, watch it!

828
01:00:41,948 --> 01:00:44,326
Come on. Let's get
him with more rocks.

829
01:00:47,954 --> 01:00:49,765
Are you nuts?

830
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:51,867
By the time you budge
that those sharpteeth

831
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:53,692
will be picking their
teeth with our bones!

832
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,895
We've gotta try!

833
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:01,834
Move over, hatchlings!

834
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:06,939
This isn't gonna work.

835
01:01:07,473 --> 01:01:08,951
Hyp!

836
01:01:08,975 --> 01:01:12,755
Oh, forget him,
Littlefoot. He's a creep.

837
01:01:12,779 --> 01:01:14,923
Who're you calling names?

838
01:01:14,947 --> 01:01:17,249
Now, get in there and help!
You creeps.

839
01:01:18,851 --> 01:01:20,853
Okay everybody.
Let's get 'em!

840
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,470
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

841
01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:29,862
We did it!

842
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:34,934
Leave our children alone!

843
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,482
We've got to stop the fighting!

844
01:01:40,506 --> 01:01:43,242
Then let's squish those
sharpteeth, once and for all!

845
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:45,878
Ugh!

846
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:50,983
Huh?

847
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,387
Look, water!
We unlocked the water!

848
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:06,265
Run!

849
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:49,517
Looks like you and your friends
saved the day, Littlefoot.

850
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,410
I think we all did, Grandpa.

851
01:03:02,021 --> 01:03:04,523
Spike likes you now.
He does.

852
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:18,881
And so, with
the return of the water,

853
01:03:18,905 --> 01:03:23,075
the Great Valley dinosaurs
were able to go home again.

854
01:03:35,154 --> 01:03:40,235
But the home they returned
to wasn't the same.

855
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:43,095
Fire had destroyed
much of their green food.

856
01:03:52,438 --> 01:03:56,151
But instead of giving
in to despair,

857
01:03:56,175 --> 01:04:02,014
the dinosaurs divided into groups to find
the spots where green food still grew.

858
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,002
Hey, everybody!

859
01:04:14,026 --> 01:04:15,670
We found more!

860
01:04:15,694 --> 01:04:17,672
Did you hear that?
More green food!

861
01:04:17,696 --> 01:04:19,274
How wonderful!

862
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:21,043
Where?

863
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:24,079
I mean... Where, son?

864
01:04:24,103 --> 01:04:27,149
In a little canyon
not far from here, Pop!

865
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:29,275
If we share there should
be enough for everyone!

866
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,719
You feeling okay, Hyp?

867
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,022
You're talking about sharing!

868
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:36,491
Ah, yeah!
Sharing!

869
01:04:36,515 --> 01:04:38,326
I know that!

870
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:42,164
Not sharing is for scaredy-eggs!
Right?

871
01:04:42,188 --> 01:04:43,398
Right!

872
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:49,537
Sharing is good!
Yep, yep, yep!

873
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,467
C'mon!
Everybody follow us!

874
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:05,687
And so, as it turned out,

875
01:05:05,711 --> 01:05:09,591
the dinosaurs traveled from
green spot to green spot,

876
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:11,383
eating their fill.

877
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:16,055
Each helping the others
to find what they needed.

878
01:05:18,457 --> 01:05:21,369
Each learning
the special kind of joy

879
01:05:21,393 --> 01:05:23,595
which comes from
giving to others.

880
01:05:50,689 --> 01:05:53,301
And, in the years to come.

881
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:58,240
This story of sharing
was told over and over again.

882
01:05:58,264 --> 01:06:01,309
Until it became known as...

883
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:05,003
The Time of the Great Giving.
