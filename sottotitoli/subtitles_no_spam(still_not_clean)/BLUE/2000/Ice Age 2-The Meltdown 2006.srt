1
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,986
This global warming is killing me.

2
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,842
This is too hot,
the Ice Age was too cold.

3
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,847
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,393
This I like.

5
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:50,734
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

6
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,684
No running, James. Camp rules.

7
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,848
Make me, sloth.

8
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:07,073
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.

9
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,703
Water ball.

10
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:13,107
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.

11
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,462
Hector, no, no, no,
you can't pee-pee there.

12
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:18,331
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

13
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:19,981
Piñata!

14
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:23,074
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

15
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,045
OK.

16
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:27,620
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

17
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:29,643
- Mine.
- Mine.

18
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,421
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

19
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:39,792
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

20
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,367
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

21
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:50,134
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

22
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:53,930
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

23
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,124
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

24
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:02,053
Look, I opened my camp.
"Campo del Sid". It means Camp of Sid.

25
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,887
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

26
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:10,418
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

27
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:12,755
Don't make me eat you.

28
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:15,878
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

29
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:19,572
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

30
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,344
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

31
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:26,710
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.

32
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:30,509
I can see that.

33
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:34,828
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.

34
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:40,230
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

35
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:45,196
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

36
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:48,154
Hey, let's play
pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.

37
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:49,669
Yeah!

38
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:51,631
Sid!

39
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,609
I can do stuff.

40
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,535
Won't give me their stupid respect.

41
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,549
I'll show 'em.

42
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:08,980
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

43
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,057
And they lived happily ever after.

44
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,883
- Good job.
- Question.

45
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,231
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

46
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:24,013
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

47
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,356
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

48
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:30,905
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

49
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,738
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

50
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:39,307
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

51
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:43,307
See, that's why I called it a burro.

52
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:48,146
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

53
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,672
- Boring.
- It's not believable.

54
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:53,195
- Do burros eat their young?
- It's not a good ending.

55
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:55,519
Sometimes I throw up.

56
00:06:56,223 --> 00:07:00,321
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

57
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:04,180
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

58
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,876
Where's your big, happy family?

59
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:15,486
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids.

60
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,833
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

61
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:22,357
- I thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

62
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:25,579
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

63
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,619
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

64
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:31,844
Fast Tony - he says
the world's gonna flood.

65
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,551
Folks, I hold in my hand
a device so powerful,

66
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,890
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky.

67
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:37,979
Yeah, right.

68
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:40,286
Gather round, gather round.

69
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,756
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

70
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,278
So you can't breathe underwater?

71
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,603
My assistant here will demonstrate.

72
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,044
Hey, I can smell the ocean.

73
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:53,213
What are you doing?
I can't sell that now.

74
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:56,108
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.

75
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,181
Through its design
and sturdy construction,

76
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:02,181
you'll have plenty of air
for eons to come.

77
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,877
Of course, results may vary.

78
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:08,807
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

79
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,634
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.

80
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,938
It's my weather forecast. The five-day
outlook calls for intense flooding

81
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,554
followed by the end of the world.

82
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,259
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

83
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,872
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

84
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:32,357
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.

85
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,962
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

86
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:37,288
You see this ground,
it's covered in ice.

87
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:39,683
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.

88
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:42,399
A thousand years from now,
it will still be ice.

89
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:46,569
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

90
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:49,850
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

91
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,820
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

92
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:56,676
Your breath smells like ants.

93
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:03,763
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

94
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,823
Don't pay any attention to him.

95
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:09,751
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

96
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:11,772
What about the dinosaurs?

97
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:14,055
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.

98
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:17,252
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

99
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,263
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

100
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:25,317
OK, I'm gonna jump
on the count of three.

101
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,505
One,

102
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,376
two...

103
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:33,685
Sid, don't move a muscle.
We're coming up.

104
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,518
Jump! Jump! Jump!

105
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,626
Jump! Jump! Jump!

106
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,169
Sorry.

107
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:42,760
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

108
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:45,448
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

109
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:48,317
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

110
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:51,612
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

111
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:54,746
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

112
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:57,714
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

113
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:02,008
- But I've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

114
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,359
Hey, watch it.

115
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,627
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.

116
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,039
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

117
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,374
If I didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.

118
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,972
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.

119
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,653
Guys.

120
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,783
Fast Tony was right.

121
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,369
Everything is melting.

122
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:18,060
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

123
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:21,003
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

124
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:24,996
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

125
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:31,424
This whole thing's a piece ofjunk.
I can't believe I live here.

126
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,457
What?

127
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:44,473
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

128
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:49,669
- It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- I'll show you something that floats.

129
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:52,806
All right, it's your funeral.

130
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,619
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

131
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,436
Giants balls of furry lava the size of
mammoths raining from the sky.

132
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:11,215
Go suck air through a reed.

133
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,526
Listen to him.
He's right about the flood.

134
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:16,634
I am? I mean, yes, I am.

135
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:21,014
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

136
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:25,019
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.

137
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:27,000
The entire valley's gonna flood.

138
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:32,885
Flood's real, all right.
And it's coming fast.

139
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,962
Look around. You're in a bowl.

140
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,002
BowI's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

141
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,017
What are we gonna do?

142
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,539
Unless you make it
to the end of the valley.

143
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,258
There's a boat. It can save you.

144
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,164
- I don't see anything.
- But

145
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,506
y'all better hurry.

146
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,821
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

147
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:01,848
Survive that
and you'll be racing the water,

148
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,028
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

149
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,122
Boom!

150
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:11,620
There is some good news, though.

151
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,686
The more of you die,

152
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:15,683
the better I eat.

153
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:20,227
I didn't say it was good news for you.

154
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:26,856
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.

155
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,587
Dam.

156
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:56,109
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

157
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,663
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

158
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:02,179
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

159
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,173
If there's any hope, it's that way.

160
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,081
Manny, let's go.

161
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:49,853
Overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane.

162
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,311
Traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see.

163
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,747
And it looks like
there might be a fatality.

164
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,777
I call the dark meat.

165
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:03,597
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

166
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,907
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

167
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:13,655
Well, I'm not leaving. I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole.

168
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,914
Do we have to bring this crap?

169
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:28,006
- I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

170
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,176
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

171
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:32,903
Manny,
I just heard you're going extinct.

172
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:36,698
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

173
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:42,000
- I'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

174
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,970
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

175
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:48,328
See?

176
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:51,787
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

177
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,046
Stu. Come on, Stu.

178
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:33,755
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

179
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,792
Stu.

180
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:47,052
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

181
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,621
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

182
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,734
Stop singing, Sid.

183
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,166
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.

184
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,342
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

185
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,667
What if you're right?

186
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,671
What if I am the last mammoth?

187
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,859
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

188
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,175
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

189
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:43,649
- Mammoths?
- I knew I couldn't be the last one.

190
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:46,130
I felt it in my gut.

191
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,265
Extinct? Come on.

192
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:05,637
He's up by a couple of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.

193
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:09,472
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

194
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,760
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

195
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:25,917
Well, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?

196
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,555
Nasty.

197
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,239
Manny.

198
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:37,449
I need to be alone for a while.

199
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:40,206
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

200
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,684
One truly is the loneliest number.

201
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:55,274
These work great.

202
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,849
Cool.

203
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,560
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- I'll get 'em.

204
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:06,706
- Which end is up?
- I'd hide that face too.

205
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:10,456
- Hey, ugly.
- I gotta sit on that.

206
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:16,538
Gotcha.

207
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,848
OK, I'm going in.

208
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,906
- Sid.
- What?

209
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,735
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

210
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,526
- I felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

211
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,583
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

212
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,041
Over here.

213
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,292
- Surrender?
- Never.

214
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:47,020
Cool.

215
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:49,104
Smoke them.

216
00:21:55,852 --> 00:22:00,515
If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.

217
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:04,162
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

218
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,661
Miscreants?

219
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:08,955
Diego, they're possums.

220
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,163
Retreat.

221
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:41,587
I guess it's just you and me now.

222
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:55,780
I knew it.
I knew I wasn't the only one.

223
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:59,768
Everyone falls out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.

224
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:01,466
Wait. What?

225
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:04,069
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

226
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:08,005
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

227
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:12,126
And you were in the tree because...?

228
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:15,516
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

229
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:18,069
Brothers? You mean there's more?

230
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:20,088
Sure.

231
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:22,845
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

232
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,833
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.

233
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:30,001
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

234
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:32,202
Help! Help!

235
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,209
Help!

236
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,316
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.

237
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,979
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

238
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,099
- What are you looking at me for?
- I don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

239
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:56,554
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.

240
00:23:56,821 --> 00:24:00,494
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

241
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,615
And my other friend, the platypus.

242
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:06,149
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

243
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:09,400
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

244
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:14,286
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

245
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:19,232
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

246
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:23,459
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

247
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,690
Hey, she should come with us.

248
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:28,227
Are you insane? No way.

249
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:29,840
OK.

250
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:33,732
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

251
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:37,154
- I'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

252
00:24:37,385 --> 00:24:41,590
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

253
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:44,621
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

254
00:24:44,825 --> 00:24:47,887
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

255
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:52,159
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

256
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,074
Why did you invite them?

257
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:58,168
Cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

258
00:24:58,386 --> 00:24:59,591
He has a point.

259
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:02,383
Sorry, when did I join
this dating service?

260
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:06,488
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.

261
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:08,849
If you treat us nicely.

262
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:11,391
See that?
That's the total opposite of nice.

263
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:14,039
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

264
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:17,136
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

265
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:18,993
Banzai!

266
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:21,359
- I got 'em.
- Back! Back!

267
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:27,009
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

268
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:36,144
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now travelling together.

269
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:39,788
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

270
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:42,634
I'll be the daddy,
Ellie will be the mommy.

271
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:46,425
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

272
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,222
Now, let's move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet.

273
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:53,149
I thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly.

274
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:57,218
I'm not fat. It's this fur,
it makes me look big.

275
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,150
- It's poofy.
- OK.

276
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,333
He's fat.

277
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:39,021
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

278
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:41,878
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

279
00:26:43,794 --> 00:26:46,888
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

280
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:49,871
How would you like
to lose a ton or two?

281
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:51,523
Would I ever.

282
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:56,033
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

283
00:26:56,315 --> 00:27:00,946
I also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

284
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:31,148
We'll never make it at this pace.

285
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:35,371
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

286
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:38,275
OK. Safe? Please.

287
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:40,351
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

288
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:42,545
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

289
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:47,272
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

290
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,280
- Guys.
- All clear.

291
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,240
Hawk!

292
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,457
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

293
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,675
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because I'm a mammoth.

294
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:14,100
But you'd do it for treats, right?

295
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,100
Is he gone?

296
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:21,308
You're safe. Get up.

297
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,425
Man.

298
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:27,658
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

299
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,374
That's how cousin Wilton went.

300
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:35,584
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.

301
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:39,707
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

302
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:44,060
- I'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

303
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:47,080
That's right. Don't give up hope.

304
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,517
Ellie.

305
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:53,287
Look at our footprints.

306
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:55,543
They're the same shape.

307
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:58,616
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?

308
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,678
Well, then,

309
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:02,947
look at our shadows.

310
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:05,227
We match.

311
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:07,889
You're right. They're the same.

312
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:10,067
You must be part possum.

313
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:15,036
You wish.

314
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:30,629
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

315
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:33,603
We gotta catch up with the others.

316
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:43,823
Hey. Knock it off.

317
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,847
Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

318
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,996
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

319
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,191
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

320
00:29:55,368 --> 00:30:00,762
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

321
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,248
Mammal overboard!

322
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:41,495
Ellie, get up.
If you play dead, you'll be dead.

323
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:43,605
Look at me.

324
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,806
Diego.

325
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:00,836
Diego.

326
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:12,081
Come on, Diego. Come on.

327
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:16,178
This may sting a little.

328
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,241
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- I don't know.

329
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,012
From now on,
land - safe, water - not safe.

330
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,654
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

331
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:36,541
- It was nothing. I...
- It's not a compliment.

332
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:38,614
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

333
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:41,494
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

334
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:44,839
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

335
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:47,818
Maybe you should run away more.

336
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:50,124
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

337
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,132
Happy to help.

338
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:57,235
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more".

339
00:32:57,502 --> 00:33:00,335
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

340
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,602
You like her.

341
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:06,956
- I do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

342
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:09,675
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

343
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,390
You know, the one where you can't swim.

344
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,841
That's ridiculous.

345
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:16,114
Fine. But we're living
in a melting world.

346
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:20,434
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

347
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:19,484
Almost there.

348
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:22,607
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

349
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:24,619
Let's roll.

350
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:28,971
Wait for me.

351
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,826
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

352
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,750
So you think she's the girl for me?

353
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,859
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

354
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:51,479
She completes you.

355
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,088
Yeah.

356
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:59,133
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

357
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,527
- No.
- Come on.

358
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:04,152
You expect to impress
with that attitude?

359
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:05,601
I don't want to impress.

360
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:08,389
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

361
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:11,959
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

362
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:16,213
<i>- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.</i>

363
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:18,925
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

364
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:21,294
He's never gonna let up on you.

365
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:24,723
It'll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it.

366
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:28,650
So what do you want me to do?

367
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,966
Pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond.

368
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:32,665
I don't know.

369
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,393
If you're too lame to do it,
we can get Ellie.

370
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,079
No, no, no. No, I can do it.
I can do it.

371
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:40,072
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

372
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:43,633
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

373
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,218
Farther, farther, farther.

374
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:49,091
Perfect. Fire!

375
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,455
Yeah! I can fly!

376
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,638
Crash!

377
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,848
Crash! Crash!

378
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:13,401
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

379
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:16,310
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

380
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:19,579
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

381
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:22,892
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

382
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:25,101
Can I help in any way here?

383
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:27,991
You've done enough.

384
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:32,659
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

385
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:35,097
Who's gonna watch my back?

386
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:38,569
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

387
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:42,701
Who's gonna roll
in that dung patch with me?

388
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,757
Dung patch?

389
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,279
- Wait. My legs. I can stand.
- He can stand.

390
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:52,959
- I can run.
- He can run. It's a miracle.

391
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,030
Hallelujah!

392
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,708
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

393
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:08,987
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

394
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:11,184
Not the face.

395
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:23,698
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

396
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,865
She's not half bad.

397
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:30,377
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

398
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,433
So?

399
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,291
So what's holding you back?

400
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:40,474
My family.

401
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,328
You can have that again, you know.

402
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:48,507
No, Sid, I can't.

403
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:53,099
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,

404
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:57,956
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.

405
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:07,623
I think I'm starting
to get through to him.

406
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:11,679
- Wait, wait. I got you.
- Slowpoke.

407
00:38:15,486 --> 00:38:19,234
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

408
00:38:19,486 --> 00:38:21,971
- You're stuck.
- I am not.

409
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,619
All right, then, let's go.

410
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:27,856
I can't.

411
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,060
I'm stuck.

412
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:34,457
Don't you think that picking them up
like this would be easier?

413
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:52,061
Ellie?

414
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:15,918
I know this place.

415
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,492
You know, deep down,
I knew I was different.

416
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:24,933
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

417
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:27,469
OK, a lot bigger.

418
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:32,973
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

419
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:38,659
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

420
00:41:38,982 --> 00:41:41,118
- you know.
- What?

421
00:41:45,622 --> 00:41:47,191
Attractive.

422
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:50,176
- Really?
- Sure.

423
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,368
What about me is attractive?

424
00:41:55,543 --> 00:41:57,374
I don't know.

425
00:41:57,543 --> 00:41:59,602
Well, there's your

426
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:03,013
butt.

427
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:06,035
What about it?

428
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:08,174
It's

429
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:10,403
big.

430
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:12,534
You're just saying that.

431
00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:15,898
No, no, no, I mean it.

432
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:20,006
It's huge.
Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.

433
00:42:20,264 --> 00:42:22,978
That is really sweet.

434
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:25,244
What a crazy day.

435
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:30,329
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.

436
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:15,014
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

437
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,345
Sure did.

438
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,932
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

439
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,380
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

440
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,552
I wouldn't know.
Sabres don't feel fear.

441
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:32,944
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.

442
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:35,499
Rocks have no fear.

443
00:44:35,691 --> 00:44:38,905
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

444
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:43,610
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.

445
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:45,537
No. You?

446
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,023
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

447
00:44:48,212 --> 00:44:53,421
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.

448
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,260
- I wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

449
00:44:56,452 --> 00:44:59,166
But the point is that fear is natural.

450
00:45:00,293 --> 00:45:02,701
Fear is for prey.

451
00:45:02,893 --> 00:45:06,292
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

452
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:10,129
Justjump in and trust your instincts.

453
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:12,858
You know, most animals
can swim as babies.

454
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:18,568
And for a tiger, it's like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

455
00:45:19,494 --> 00:45:23,592
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

456
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,611
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

457
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:29,495
I look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.

458
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:31,831
And I'm breathing.

459
00:45:32,015 --> 00:45:35,153
And I'm stalking
and I'm stalking and I'm...

460
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:40,676
- I'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

461
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,224
Kind of like a rock.

462
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:50,497
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

463
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:53,530
Or do we just throw our weight around?

464
00:45:53,737 --> 00:45:55,339
Whoops. Sorry.

465
00:45:55,497 --> 00:45:57,861
I don't know my own strength yet.

466
00:45:58,057 --> 00:46:02,078
Ellie, do you realise that now
we have a chance to save our species?

467
00:46:02,337 --> 00:46:06,620
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

468
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:08,620
Did you just...?

469
00:46:08,778 --> 00:46:12,298
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

470
00:46:12,538 --> 00:46:15,937
I wasn't saying...
Not right now. In time.

471
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:18,589
I was just saying that
it's our responsibility.

472
00:46:18,697 --> 00:46:19,957
What?

473
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,659
All right, that came out wrong. I...

474
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:24,766
You're very pretty, but we just met...

475
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,034
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?

476
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:31,932
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

477
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:37,465
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

478
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:50,814
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

479
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:58,450
OK, let's go.
We travelled with you all day,

480
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,027
now you're coming with us at night.

481
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:03,205
But we can't see at night.

482
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:05,409
Then enjoy the flood.

483
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:08,067
I can't even look at him.

484
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:10,093
Pervert.

485
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:19,331
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

486
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,610
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

487
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:49,797
I thought we could walk together.

488
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:52,394
Crash,
ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

489
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:55,604
She said she thinks you're ajerk
and to go away.

490
00:47:55,826 --> 00:47:57,657
She didn't say...

491
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,383
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

492
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:05,259
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.

493
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:10,018
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

494
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:13,064
- I can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

495
00:48:24,428 --> 00:48:26,455
Stop moving.

496
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:31,422
Thank you.

497
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,817
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

498
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,537
Now!

499
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:53,118
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

500
00:48:58,431 --> 00:49:01,678
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

501
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:03,785
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

502
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:06,087
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

503
00:49:10,432 --> 00:49:13,831
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you.

504
00:49:14,072 --> 00:49:16,403
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

505
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:19,964
That it offended her!

506
00:49:20,153 --> 00:49:22,757
I mean that, that it offended you.

507
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:29,045
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

508
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,870
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

509
00:49:32,074 --> 00:49:34,176
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

510
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:36,990
- It was a misunderstanding.
- It was insensitive.

511
00:49:37,194 --> 00:49:39,754
- Apologise.
- Why me? She overreacted.

512
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:42,013
- Just apologise.
- No.

513
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:44,874
- Do it.
- OK, I'm sorry.

514
00:49:45,074 --> 00:49:46,414
What?

515
00:49:46,555 --> 00:49:48,843
- He's right. I overreacted.
- You mean...

516
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:53,240
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.

517
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:56,486
I got it. I got it.

518
00:49:56,675 --> 00:49:58,505
I got it.

519
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:06,336
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

520
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:21,964
I guess we finally
did something right together.

521
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:26,828
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

522
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:49,068
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

523
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,493
You know. Yesterday, last week.

524
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,732
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

525
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,371
Yep. Those were the good days.

526
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,658
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

527
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:07,177
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

528
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,948
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

529
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:25,978
Wait a minute.

530
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,455
Can I help you?

531
00:52:38,768 --> 00:52:41,525
Now, that's what I call respect.

532
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:45,031
Nice.

533
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:53,758
Somebody here likes Sid.

534
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:58,081
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.

535
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,498
Fire King.

536
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:16,724
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognised my true potential.

537
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:19,033
Let there be fire.

538
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:28,580
If only the guys could see me now.

539
00:54:30,256 --> 00:54:33,274
This is either really good
or really bad.

540
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:36,404
No, no, no.

541
00:54:36,537 --> 00:54:38,888
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King?

542
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:42,110
A thousand years' bad juju
for killing Fire King.

543
00:54:42,337 --> 00:54:45,126
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

544
00:54:45,337 --> 00:54:47,473
melting ice built up
over thousands of years.

545
00:54:47,658 --> 00:54:51,406
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

546
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:54,065
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

547
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:56,971
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

548
00:54:57,899 --> 00:54:59,729
No! No!

549
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,396
Bad juju!

550
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:40,161
Water? Water!

551
00:55:45,662 --> 00:55:48,282
Crash, I told you not to drink
before bed.

552
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:51,019
I didn't do this.
At least, not all of it.

553
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:54,360
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

554
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,685
What if we're the last creatures
left alive?

555
00:55:56,779 --> 00:55:58,881
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

556
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:02,125
How? Everyone's either
a dude or our sister.

557
00:56:03,183 --> 00:56:05,787
Hi. Hey, Manny.

558
00:56:05,984 --> 00:56:08,697
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

559
00:56:08,904 --> 00:56:11,160
You were sleepwalking.

560
00:56:11,343 --> 00:56:14,635
No, no, no. I was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths.

561
00:56:14,864 --> 00:56:17,882
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

562
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:21,973
I mean, sure, they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

563
00:56:22,224 --> 00:56:25,896
You were dreaming. Come on, the water's
rising faster than we're moving.

564
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:30,885
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
I was worshiped. Guys.

565
00:56:31,185 --> 00:56:33,016
Fine.

566
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:43,221
Can we slow down a little?
I'm dying here.

567
00:56:47,306 --> 00:56:49,562
It was just a figure of speech.

568
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:57,987
They just sit there, watching us.

569
00:56:58,227 --> 00:57:00,832
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

570
00:58:30,354 --> 00:58:32,991
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

571
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:41,072
- Sid!
- What? It's catchy.

572
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:56,482
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

573
00:59:20,622 --> 00:59:24,566
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

574
00:59:31,006 --> 00:59:34,558
I just did something
involuntary and messy.

575
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,531
OK, come on.

576
00:59:38,606 --> 00:59:41,058
Manny. Get back.
It's a minefield out there.

577
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:43,945
There's only one way to go.
Straight through.

578
00:59:44,136 --> 00:59:47,764
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

579
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:51,013
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

580
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:53,669
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

581
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,099
If we go through this,
we get blown to bits.

582
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,025
- We go forward.
- We go back.

583
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:00,469
- Forward.
- Back.

584
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:02,706
- Can I say something?
- No.

585
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:07,354
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, I guess that proves it.

586
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:09,440
I am a mammoth.

587
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:13,977
- Come on.
- Fine.

588
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:17,270
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

589
01:00:17,477 --> 01:00:20,768
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

590
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,910
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

591
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:35,710
Manny.

592
01:00:57,662 --> 01:01:00,222
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

593
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:02,544
I just heard you're going extinct.

594
01:01:02,715 --> 01:01:06,039
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're ajerk.

595
01:01:06,256 --> 01:01:08,784
Where's your big, happy family?

596
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:11,325
What's wrong with you?

597
01:01:11,508 --> 01:01:13,719
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

598
01:01:20,738 --> 01:01:22,111
That way.

599
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:05,521
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

600
01:02:09,715 --> 01:02:11,545
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

601
01:02:11,705 --> 01:02:13,655
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

602
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,679
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

603
01:02:18,389 --> 01:02:21,483
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- I sure have. Big as life.

604
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:23,598
- Where?
- I'm looking at him.

605
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:25,820
Not me.

606
01:02:25,988 --> 01:02:27,971
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

607
01:03:27,257 --> 01:03:31,736
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

608
01:03:44,378 --> 01:03:46,208
Hurry, this way. Come on.

609
01:03:48,498 --> 01:03:51,865
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

610
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,752
Come on, come on, run!

611
01:04:04,868 --> 01:04:06,699
Push.

612
01:04:09,389 --> 01:04:12,527
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

613
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:15,005
- I'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

614
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:20,034
Ellie, don't worry.
We're going for help.

615
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,908
Stay here.

616
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:39,504
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

617
01:04:39,752 --> 01:04:41,659
Manny.

618
01:04:41,952 --> 01:04:43,935
Manny.

619
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,501
- Manny.
- It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

620
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:50,121
Ellie.

621
01:05:50,276 --> 01:05:52,107
Manny.

622
01:05:55,157 --> 01:05:58,328
- Help!
- I'll save you.

623
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:04,820
Great. Who's gonna save him?

624
01:06:07,438 --> 01:06:09,388
You really need to brush.

625
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:17,842
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

626
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:21,534
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

627
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:25,315
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

628
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:27,738
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

629
01:06:27,919 --> 01:06:29,869
I am not your prey. I am not your prey.

630
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,251
I am not your prey.

631
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:56,769
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

632
01:06:56,962 --> 01:07:00,209
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it.
Come on.

633
01:07:00,442 --> 01:07:04,114
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

634
01:07:04,362 --> 01:07:07,228
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.

635
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:14,834
Eddie.

636
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,672
You did it, buddy.
You kicked water's butt.

637
01:07:31,925 --> 01:07:35,063
Nothing to it. Most animals
can swim as babies, you know.

638
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:38,270
Yeah, but not tigers.
I left that part out.

639
01:07:53,046 --> 01:07:55,760
There he is.

640
01:07:55,966 --> 01:07:58,177
Ellie, hold on to me.

641
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,932
Manny, Manny, behind you.

642
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:12,353
There they are.

643
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,390
They made it.

644
01:09:25,564 --> 01:09:28,353
We thought we'd never see you again.

645
01:09:37,445 --> 01:09:39,428
We're gonna live.

646
01:09:43,005 --> 01:09:45,685
We're gonna die.

647
01:11:34,934 --> 01:11:36,560
Well, I'm not leaving.

648
01:11:36,633 --> 01:11:39,408
Grandpa, let go of the boat.
The flood's over.

649
01:11:39,614 --> 01:11:44,169
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

650
01:11:44,454 --> 01:11:48,202
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

651
01:11:48,455 --> 01:11:50,557
Well, I am anyway.

652
01:11:53,096 --> 01:11:55,776
I'm thinking about starting
a swim school.

653
01:11:55,976 --> 01:11:58,231
Sid's Squids.

654
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:05,965
All hail Fire King.

655
01:12:11,097 --> 01:12:12,742
Hi.

656
01:12:16,697 --> 01:12:21,906
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

657
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:29,122
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

658
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:34,509
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

659
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:40,964
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

660
01:12:42,299 --> 01:12:47,660
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

661
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:51,303
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

662
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:54,219
That doesn't mean "want to touch".

663
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,690
Don't ask.

664
01:13:59,664 --> 01:14:02,498
We're not the last ones anymore.

665
01:14:07,345 --> 01:14:09,176
You're not coming?

666
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,404
You wanna go with them?

667
01:14:11,585 --> 01:14:13,568
I am a mammoth.

668
01:14:13,746 --> 01:14:16,154
I should probably be with a mammoth.

669
01:14:16,346 --> 01:14:18,634
Don't you think?

670
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:20,657
Yeah, unless...

671
01:14:22,466 --> 01:14:24,296
Unless?

672
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:28,002
Unless I...

673
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:33,071
I just wanna say...

674
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:36,203
I need to tell you...

675
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:41,623
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.

676
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:46,859
You too.

677
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:25,265
Manny, you've come a long way since we
met and I'll take full credit for that,

678
01:15:25,592 --> 01:15:30,179
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

679
01:15:34,272 --> 01:15:36,986
- Go after her.
- It's OK.

680
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,052
We'll always be here for you.

681
01:15:40,832 --> 01:15:44,352
- I'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

682
01:15:44,593 --> 01:15:47,045
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

683
01:15:53,113 --> 01:15:55,902
Our Manny's growing up.

684
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:59,274
Ellie! Ellie!

685
01:16:03,514 --> 01:16:05,344
Manny.

686
01:16:06,874 --> 01:16:10,589
Ellie, I don't want us
to be together because we have to.

687
01:16:10,835 --> 01:16:13,243
I want us to be together
because we want to.

688
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,418
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

689
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:21,514
- What do you say?
- Manny, I thought you were going...

690
01:16:25,556 --> 01:16:27,768
You're possum enough for me.

691
01:16:41,517 --> 01:16:46,912
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

692
01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:49,693
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.

693
01:16:49,878 --> 01:16:54,203
- I still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

694
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:56,766
I'll carry him.

695
01:16:58,358 --> 01:17:01,038
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

696
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:02,578
Shotgun!

697
01:17:04,799 --> 01:17:07,283
Manny, who do you like better?
Me or Diego?

698
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,498
- Diego. It's not even close.
- Told you.

699
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,399
Manny, you can't choose
between your kids.

700
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,389
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

701
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,008
If I had a dog and my dog had a kid...

702
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:21,522
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that would be Sid.

703
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,084
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No.

704
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,960
- Ellie, can I have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

705
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:30,375
Ellie,
we have to be consistent with him.

706
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:46,227
I saved you, little buddy.

707
01:19:58,212 --> 01:20:01,927
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?
