
4
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,562
Hmm.

10
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,964
- Yeah!
- On the 1 5th of May...

11
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,966
in theJungle of Nool...

12
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,969
in the heat ofthe day,
in the cool ofa pool...

13
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,556
he was splashing,
enjoying thejungle's greatjoys...

15
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,645
when Horton the elephant
heard a small noise.

17
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,482
Hmm?

18
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,403
Hmm.

19
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,532
- Horton!
- Horton!

20
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,161
Good morning, class.
Are you ready?

21
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,413
- Yeah!
- Jump on board!

22
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,373
Look out below!

23
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,292
Tommy's on board.

24
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,294
Katie, you there?

25
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,506
- Ahh.
- Okay.

26
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,093
Shh. There it is.

27
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:25,765
This is one ofthejungle's
most amazing creatures― the leaf bug.

28
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,225
In order to protect itself
from predators...

29
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,770
it disguises itselfas a leaf.

30
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,025
Hmm.

31
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,486
This one's got quite a grip.

32
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,322
Come on, little buddy.
Don't be shy.

34
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,451
I guess I was mistaken, kids.

35
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,705
There are obviously
no leaf bugs in this area.

36
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,959
Even a prof― Aah! They're on me!

37
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,794
Get 'em off!

38
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,546
I think I swallowed one!

39
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,132
Help me!

40
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,301
- Pull it out!
- Uh, okay.

42
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,265
Whoo-whoo! Whee!

43
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,477
- Then humpfing a "Humpf!"
was a sour kangaroo...
- Humpf!

44
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,188
the type who's convinced
she knows better than you.

45
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,816
She made every law
and enforced every rule...

46
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,778
as self-proclaimed head of the Jungle of Nool.

47
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,906
- Humpf!
- Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?

48
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,908
How many times have I told you...

49
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,120
that thejungle is no place
to act like a wild animal?

52
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:42,091
- Ooh.
- My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.

53
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,094
And the children are learning
so much from him.

54
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,431
Learning to be a bunch
of harebrained half-wits.

55
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,767
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch-schooled.

56
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,687
So while Kangaroo stood there sneering a sneer―

57
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,481
Horton, that was the best time I've ever had
in my life. What are you gonna show us next?

58
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,777
once again
the speck floated right by Horton's ear.

59
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,779
Help!

60
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,699
And he heard it again,just a very faint yelp...

61
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,452
as ifsome tiny person
were calling for help.

63
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,498
And you know what he thought?

64
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,878
Why, he thought that there must be
someone on top ofthat small speck ofdust.

65
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,922
Or even a family—
it just might be so―

66
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,884
a family with children
just starting to grow.

68
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,680
I wanna live!

69
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,309
Uh, I gotta go.
Katie, you're in charge.

70
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,228
- Ahh.
- Huh?

72
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,775
Wait! Come back!

73
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,943
- Watch it!
- Eh— Uh—

74
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,862
Ohh!

80
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,801
One more! One more!

81
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,429
One more! One more!
One more! One more!

83
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,060
Ooh! Ooh!

84
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,020
- I hear someone comin'.
- Gimme those.

85
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,107
Wait!

86
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,275
Sound the alarm!

87
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,195
Huh?

88
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,406
Excuse me. Pardon my stampede.

89
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,743
Sorry, Wickershams. I promise
I'm gonna clean all this up later.

90
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,829
Bring the ammo!

92
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,215
I love the smell of bananas
in the morning!

93
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,052
Banana in the hole!

94
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,055
Come on, guys.
We're all mammals.

95
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,724
Whoa!

96
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,561
I feel the diplomatic
process is beginning to break down.

97
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,938
Whoa!

98
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,233
There you are! I got ya!

99
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,947
- Hi, kids.
- Whoa!
- Aah!

104
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,881
There. Now you're safe.

105
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,676
I know I heard you say something.

106
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,970
I just know it.

107
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,556
Where are you?

109
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,605
Humpf!

110
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,940
- Horton!
- Oh. Sorry.

111
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,276
Uh—
I just—

112
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,361
There was this speck, and, uh...

113
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,405
it called out for help.

114
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,866
- And I was—
- The speck called out for help?

115
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,868
Well, not the speck.

116
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,870
I mean, that's... ridiculous.

117
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,165
Is that what you thought I meant? No.

118
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,501
The speck can't call out for help.
Come on. Get real.

120
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,841
No, there's a tiny person on that speck
that needs my help.

121
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,718
Absurd.

122
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,720
There aren't people that small.

123
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,389
Well, maybe they aren't small.

124
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,391
Maybe... we're big.

125
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,393
- Horton—
- No, really. Think about it.

126
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:25,064
What ifthere were someone
way out there...

127
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,399
looking down on our world right now?

128
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,401
And to them, we're the specks.

129
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,197
And then maybe someone else will come along
and say, "There can't be people that small."

130
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,533
And the first guy would say,
"Are you calling me a liar?"

131
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,036
And the second guy would say,
"Ifthe shoe fits, wear it!"

132
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,538
Now the fists are flying.
The first guy picks up a brick―

133
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,959
You might want to zip up the pouch
for this next part— "Fat boy, you want some?"

134
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,961
- Horton!
- What?

135
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,296
There is nothing on that speck.

136
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,424
- But I heard.
- Did you?

137
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,344
Really?
Oh, my.

138
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,014
Then how come / don't hear anything?

139
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,350
Well—

140
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,521
If you can't see,
hear or feel something...

141
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,523
it doesn't exist.

142
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:13,487
And believing in tiny, imaginary people
is just not something we do...

143
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,157
or tolerate here
in the Jungle of Nool.

144
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:21,996
Really? 'Cause I bet if I tried, I could find
somebody who'd believe what I was saying.

145
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,998
You will do nothing ofthe sort.

146
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,667
You will not breathe a word ofthis lie
to anyone else...

147
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,669
especially the children.

148
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,756
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.

149
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,926
Our community has standards, Horton.

150
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:40,389
Ifyou want to remain a part of it,
l recommend you follow them.

151
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,809
Mmm. Have a nice day.

153
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,149
All right then.
I'll, uh, take that under advisement.

154
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,526
Certainly appreciate your input.

156
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,822
I don't understand.

157
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,701
I know I heard you.
It was as plain as the nose on my face.

158
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,620
That's it.

159
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,622
Maybe you can't hear me.

160
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,625
Ofcourse.
Your ears must be tiny.

161
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,794
I need to speak up.

163
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,507
Hello!

164
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,510
Now, some people out there― I think  l know who―

165
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,138
may find they agree
with that sour kangaroo.

166
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,559
There can't really be people
as small as a mite.

167
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:30,022
Well, there can and there are,
because Horton was right.

169
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:43,160
Hello!

170
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,415
That single "hello"
traveled all the way down...

171
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,417
through the speck,
through the clouds...

172
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,253
till it found a small town.

173
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,507
A town known as Who-ville,
for there lived the Whos...

174
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,927
feeling happy and safe,
knowing only good news...

175
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,514
unaware that theirworld
was a speck on a clover...

176
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,225
unaware that the sweet life they knew
might be over.

177
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,018
- Over.
- Under.

178
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,020
Oi! Oi! Oi!

180
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,858
The Mayor of Who-ville, a man named McDodd...

181
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,861
was devoted and fair
and a little bit odd.

186
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,382
The mayor and his wife,
they had children to spare―

187
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,761
96 daughters,
some here and some there.

188
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,765
Ninety-six girls to love.
Ninety-six girls to teach.

189
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,645
But the mayor had only a few seconds for each.

190
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,982
Daddy, I got better than best
on my "Who-story" test.

191
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,984
Ah, Who-story.
I remember it well.

192
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,028
- That's one of my girls.
- Hildy's been using my hairbrush!

193
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,114
Holly's been using my hairbrush!

194
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,158
Look! Over there!

195
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,201
There. All better.

196
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,328
Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad?

197
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,330
Everyone else in my class has one.

198
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,082
Oh, really? Everyone?

199
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,379
Oh. I will think about it.

200
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,381
Daddy, look! Daddy, look!

202
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,927
Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,596
Toof!

204
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,389
It's a "T-H," sweetheart.
It's "tooth."

205
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,309
In Who-ville tradition, unlike yours or mine...

206
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,187
the mayor's oldest is next
in the mayoral line.

207
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,814
And who was the oldest,
to lead and stand tall?

208
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,775
It wasJoJo, his son,
the smallest Who ofall.

209
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,153
So,JoJo, what's, uh—
What's shakin'?

210
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,615
What's happenin'?
What's the word?

211
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,659
Now, to you or to me, it's abundantly clear...

212
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,913
that JoJo did not want
his father's career.

213
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,916
But the mayor pressed forward,
completely deluded...

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,918
Boom-badda, boom-badda,
bidda-bidda-boom!

215
00:13:56,002 --> 00:14:00,380
whileJoJojust sat there
in silence and brooded.

217
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,135
Oh,JoJo.

218
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,013
- Why does he get more time?
- That's not fair.

219
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,390
Son. Hey.

220
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,559
And why didn't he speak?

221
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,730
Well, I think that the lad was afraid,
if he did, he might let down his dad.

222
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,732
You know what's awesome?

223
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,109
This is awesome.

224
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:25,948
Just look at the men and women
hanging on these walls.

225
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,618
You, my boy, are part
ofa family legacy...

226
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,995
that spans centuries.

227
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,997
You know what?

228
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:38,001
Your grandfather was mayor
of Who-ville. Mm-hmm.

229
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,213
And your great-grandmother.

230
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,965
That's right.

231
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,467
All the way down to your―

232
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,844
great-

233
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,222
great-great-great-

234
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,474
not-so-great-
great-great-

235
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,395
great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-

237
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,695
Someday, I hope to join them...

238
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,697
be one ofthe greats.

239
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:10,993
I tell you, JoJo,
there is nothing like being mayor.

240
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,289
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets.

241
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,960
And in the Edible Parade, I'm the one
sitting on top ofthe giant meatball.

242
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,882
Someday, that can be you too,JoJo.

243
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:31,638
Someday, you'll be the one
wearing the mayoral crest.

244
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:36,768
You just—
You just need to—

245
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,854
You know what I mean?

246
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,149
Okay. Good chat.

247
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,528
I'm glad that we had this talk...

248
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,907
that l'm continuing now by myself.

249
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,076
Good.

251
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,706
Huh.

252
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,043
Ooh. There. That oughta be comfy.

254
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,299
Nothing wrong with this, Morton.

255
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,509
Nothin' wrong with this.

256
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,931
Just you and me and the speck shootin' the breeze.

257
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,225
- We're a club. We're a group.
- Hmm?

258
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,227
We can take a vote on the issues.

259
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,856
We can be a secret society that controls
the balance of power in the world.

260
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,026
- Horton—
- And no one else can join
unless they wear funny hats.

263
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,742
- Listen, Horton—
- The chair recognizes Brother Morton.

264
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,913
I am really happy
you found this speck and all...

265
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,334
but you might wanna think
about keeping it to yourself.

266
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,419
Hmm? What? Why?

267
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,924
You're talking to a clover.
That doesn't look good.

268
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,595
You know what doesn't look good?

269
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,890
You talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.

270
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,810
The speck never said
anything bad about you.

271
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,021
But, hey, good luck
with your illusion ofsuperiority.

272
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:07,401
You know, the speck can think anything
it wants about me. It's a speck.

273
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,403
Whoa!

274
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,697
I see what's going on here.

275
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,534
Morton, no matter how tight
the speck and I get...

276
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,412
the speck could never replace you.

277
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,748
I'm only sad that I would have
to explain that at this point.

278
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:26,420
Well, that's awesome, Horton.
That really helps.

279
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,214
Just try to keep this to yourself.

280
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,216
I'll see you later.

281
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,260
Try.

282
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,345
Hmm.

283
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,391
Hey, Horton. What you got there?

284
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,476
What? Nothing.

285
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,478
We're not doing anything.

286
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,189
We're totally alone.

287
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,192
- Who's "we"?
- We? What? We? Did I say that?

288
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,571
No, I would never say that, because that
would imply that I was with someone...

289
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,240
and not alone.

291
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,165
Okay, seriously, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.

292
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,002
Ifanybody finds out about this,
it could be very, very bad.

293
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,297
I'm not sure why.

294
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,299
We won't tell anyone.

295
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,844
And ifwe do, we'll tell them
not to tell anyone.

296
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,763
Perfect.

297
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,765
Okay, I'm taking a bath, right?

298
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,184
'Cause my skin
gets kind ofdry and ashy―

299
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,478
While Horton came clean
about the speck that he'd found...

300
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,646
and how he saved it
when it nearly drowned...

301
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,648
the mayor set off
on his morning commute...

302
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,194
and noticed things weren't
quite the same on his route.

303
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,738
But please don't blame Horton,
for he didn't know...

304
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,115
that a small bump above―

305
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,118
And I dove into the water like this!

306
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,330
was a big bump below.

307
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,832
Hey,Joe. Don't work too hard.

308
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,835
Ah, these luxury condos,
they don't build themselves.

310
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,301
Hey, look at that!
I guess they do build themselves.

311
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,888
Okay, that happened.

312
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,435
Now, the mayor knew it was hisjob to convey...

313
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,729
the unusual things
that he'd noticed that day.

314
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,066
But there was one problem.
Though his will was strong—

315
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,693
- You're late.
- Thankyou, Miss Yelp.

316
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,905
nothing in Who-ville had ever gone wrong.

317
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,492
We have all that we need.
We need all that we've got.

318
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,246
We like it in Who-ville.
We like it a lot!

319
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,542
We're all very busy
with the Who-centennial coming up...

320
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,545
so let's bring this meeting to order.

321
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:36,466
Mr. Mayor, I presume
you have some good news for us.

322
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,677
Well, it's news.

323
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,556
I don't know ifwe need to go labeling it
good or bad or anything like that.

324
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,685
The thing is,
I have noticed some odd goings-on...

325
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,687
in Who-ville lately.

326
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,689
Good odd goings-on?

327
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,025
Well, you know, tremors,
clouds swirling in the sky.

328
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,028
It seems to me,just to be safe,
we might want to consider...

329
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,531
postponing the Who-centennial.

330
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,118
- Consider what?
- Postponing the Who-centennial.

331
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,205
What? Speak up, man!

332
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,584
Postponing the Who-centennial. All right?

337
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,187
Hmm.

338
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:36,192
We are about to celebrate 100 years
of Who-ville happiness and harmony...

339
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,904
and you want
to postpone the celebration?

340
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,906
Well, what ifWho-ville's not safe?

341
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,116
Nothing ever goes wrong
in Who-ville.

342
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,495
Never has and never will.
You blathering boob.

343
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,998
Boob?

345
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,879
The Who-centennial
will proceed as planned.

346
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,507
The mayor was merely being an idiot.

347
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,011
It will be all smiles from now on.

348
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,933
Ow. Ow.

349
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,937
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.

350
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:16,107
What you mean it don't look like me?
That look just like me.

351
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,319
Ten years ago.
Wait a minute. Hold on for a second.

352
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,201
Treats me like an idiot.
I am not an idiot.

353
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,289
Do I look like an idiot?

354
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:35,502
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I am not an idiot.

355
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:40,131
Has the nerve to call me a boob? I would never
call somebody a boob. He's a boob.

356
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,635
Look at you. Yuck.

357
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,637
Look at your face.

358
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,391
And l bet you don't look so good
with a stapler in your head!

360
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,945
Whoa! Whoa!

361
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,364
Ow. Ow. Ow.

362
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,701
- Yaah! Thankyou, Miss Yelp.
- You're welcome.

363
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,786
Oh!

364
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,955
- Hello?
- Who said that?

365
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,582
I'll punch you!
Whoa!

367
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,005
Hmm?

369
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,760
Hello?

370
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,762
Hello.

371
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,181
Hello.

373
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,442
- Who's there?
- Um, this is the mayor.

374
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,778
The mayor? The mayor?

375
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,032
I'm talking to the mayor!

376
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:51,494
I knew it, I knew it,  l knew it!
I knew there was life on this speck.

377
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,872
Speck? What speck?

378
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:59,127
Well, um, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, but...

379
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,047
you're living on a speck.

380
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:06,718
Well, I hate to disagree with you,
O Voice from the Drainpipe...

381
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,054
but I live in Who-ville.

382
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,097
Well, then Who-ville's a speck.

383
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,099
Right. Okay.

384
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,560
Seriously, who is this?

385
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,562
Is this Burt from Accounting?

386
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,608
Uh, no. This is Horton.
I'm an elephant.

387
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:27,155
Okay, Horton— fake name—
where are you?

388
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,741
Well, from where you're standing...

389
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,411
I guess I'm in the sky.

390
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:37,082
Compared to you, I'm enormous, which is saying
something, because I've slimmed down a bit.

391
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,084
I swim.

392
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:43,755
Your whole world
fits on a flower in my world.

393
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,800
Oh, man, this is even
pushing it foryou, Burt.

394
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,011
Don't believe me? Watch what happens
when I put you in the shade.

395
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,347
This is absolutely impossibl—

396
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,681
Dark.

397
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:58,186
Light. Dark. Light.

398
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,606
Dark. Light. Dark. Light. Dark. Light.
Dark. Light. Dark. Light. Dark.

399
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,317
- Light.
- Whoo.

400
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:10,281
Don't you see? We're in the middle of
some kind ofamazing cosmic convergence.

401
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,867
Two vastly different worlds...

402
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,370
- miraculously crossing paths.
- Who— Who—

403
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,123
Mine colossal!
Yours minuscule.

404
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,042
Yet somehow
we've managed to make contact.

405
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,379
Ifyou think about it,
it's pretty amazing.

406
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,217
Is everything okay down there?

407
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,220
Uh, I-I don't know.

408
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,807
You tell me.
You're the one holding the speck.

409
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,976
I'm the one holding the speck.

410
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,020
I'm the one holding the speck.

411
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,981
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

412
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,568
Um, hold, please.

413
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,778
Oh! Ohh!

414
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:52,115
What did all ofthis mean? The mayor hadn't a clue.

415
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,076
So he ran to the office of Dr. Larue...

416
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,662
the brainiest brain
on the staffat Who U.

417
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,664
Dr. Larue?

418
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,500
Oh, this is crazy.

419
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,711
Oh. Mr. Mayor.

420
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,963
Uh, how may I be ofassistance?

421
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,966
I don't know.
Hey, I wasjust wondering...

422
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,761
ifourworld were, say, a tiny speck, mmm,
floating through space...

423
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,763
how would we know?

424
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,891
Why would you ask
something like that?

425
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,934
Oh, no reason.
No reason at all.

426
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,313
I don't even remember.
Yes, I do. You know what?

427
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,148
Some guy was talking to me.

428
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,401
Not an elephant in the sky,
a guy on the ground.

429
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,403
There would be several ramifications.

430
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,989
Good ramifications?

431
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,325
A tiny speck.

432
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,160
Uh-huh, yeah. Tiny speck.

433
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,746
- Floating around.
- Whoa.

434
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,999
Well, we'd have
"unexplicable" tremors...

435
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,543
dramatic changes in the weather.

436
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:50,048
And ifwe didn't eventually achieve
some sort ofstability...

437
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,342
our world would be...

438
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,344
destroyed.

439
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,597
Destroyed? Destroyed.
Oh, destroyed.

440
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,433
The drama!

441
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,144
Aaaah!

442
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:07,440
- Horton.
- Uh, no, uh, this is, uh, Benny.

443
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,568
Horton is busy right now.

444
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,654
I'm joking.

445
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,656
That's me.

446
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,658
Oh, we're doomed.

447
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,328
Listen, Horton,
turns out l need your help a little bit.

448
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,331
Apparently, ifthat speck
keeps moving around...

449
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,583
our whole world could be obliterated.

450
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:30,672
So I need you to find us Whos
a safer, more stable home.

451
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,674
And fast.

452
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,469
No problem, Mr. Mayor.
Let's see.

453
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,890
Mmm. Wow!
That's a nice view.

454
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,603
Hello? Is everything okay?

455
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,647
Ooh!

459
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,489
What's going on up there?

463
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,708
Oh, no!

464
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,919
Aaah!

465
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:15,008
This entire jungle
is a house of death!

466
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,760
Oh, wait.
There's a good spot.

467
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,139
And it's then Horton saw,
at the top of Mount Nool...

468
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,434
a small cave that looked peaceful
and quiet and cool...

469
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,478
where a sunflower grew
proud and tall from the ground.

470
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,566
There he knew every Who
would be safe, would be sound.

471
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,695
I've found it, Mayor.
The perfect place.

472
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,697
Right up there.

473
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,866
On the top of Mount Nool.

474
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,868
- Mr. Mayor?
- I wish you could—

475
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,496
Oh, how shiny.

476
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,916
The Who-centennial committee
is waiting foryou...

477
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,919
to look over the giant meatball
for the Edible Parade.

478
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,256
Oh, and then you're due at the dentist
foryour Who-root canal.

479
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,968
You know, sticking "Who" in front
ofeverything doesn't make it hurt less.

480
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,095
Just wastes time!

481
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,473
I don't... wanna go.

482
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,808
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go.

483
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,811
Apparently there's a problem
with the giant meatball.

484
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,814
You just take care
ofthat meatball, sir...

485
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,275
and leave the freaking out to me.

486
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,445
So then Horton began his long, perilous trek...

487
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,449
determined to save
the small world on the speck.

488
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,951
Horton was faithful
and stalwart and kind.

489
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,120
I got ya. Don't worry.

490
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,164
He was a brave hero―

491
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,750
- I'll protect you.
- at least in his mind.

492
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,127
We must become invisible,
travel silently...

493
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,464
for there are forces
that would seek to destroy us.

494
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,056
Huh? So you think
you can sneak up on me, huh?

496
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,436
It is clear that you are no match
for my technique! Hey!

498
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,817
l see you have mastered
the Way ofthe Snapping Branch.

499
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,903
Watch me tumble!

500
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,571
Morton Mouse, go!

501
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,783
You are fast, Horton,
but the kangaroo has monkeys!

502
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,786
I will make monkeys ofthese monkeys!
lt is their destiny― Huh?

503
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,330
My clover!

504
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,416
Ooh!

505
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,001
Horton is the greatest hero
ofthem all! Ha!

506
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,671
- Horton! Go!
- Morton! Go!

508
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,843
- But Mount Nool is that way!
- Ha-ha-ha!

509
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,012
To the top of Mount Nool!
As fast as lightning! Away I go!

511
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,767
Oh. Sorry, little fella.

512
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,521
You'll be fine.
Just think healing thoughts.

513
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,943
- Horton! Horton! Look!
- Look, look, look!

515
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,574
- We've all got our own clovers
with worlds on them.
- Yeah.

516
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,868
Oh.

517
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,829
In my world, everyone's a pony...

518
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,541
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies.

519
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,878
That's beautiful, Katie.

520
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,756
Ahh.

521
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,676
In a really weird way.

522
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,636
My world is called Jessica-land.

523
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,639
Everyone worships Queen Jessica
becauseJessica is so beautiful.

524
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,225
Jessica, that was awesome.

526
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,104
Hmm.

527
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,982
- Rudy!
- Mom, be careful!

528
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,985
- My best friend, Thidwick, lives on that.
- Rudy, no one lives on this.

529
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,987
It's not possible.

530
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,989
That Horton is a menace.

531
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,826
- M-Mom, you're so weird. Don't do this to me.
- Honey, go to your room.

532
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,704
Horton!

533
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,956
Whee!

534
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,626
- It's good!
- What do you thinkyou're doing?

535
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,878
Huh? You guys with worlds
are in trouble.

536
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,880
Have you forgotten
what we discussed?

537
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,174
Oh, no. l'm an elephant.

538
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,718
And elephants never forget.
It's a curse really.

539
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,013
I was on my head, and you said "Humpf!"
I looked up, you said "What are you doing?"

540
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,433
I said the thing about the speck. Then you
pulled my ears, poked me on the forehead—

541
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,727
- Horton!
- Well, you did.

542
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,272
Give me that clover, Horton. Now.

543
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,652
No.

544
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,904
No?

545
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,490
Yeah.

546
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,993
Are you sure you wanna
fight this fight, Horton?

547
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:15,665
Because I promise you
it will get very ugly very fast.

548
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,792
And you need to askyourself...

549
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,712
"Do I really want
to put myselfthrough all this...

550
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,798
for a clover?"

551
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:28,636
Take it from me, Horton—you don't.
So hand it over.

552
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,393
No! I can't give it to you.

553
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,395
There are people on this speck.

554
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,397
Granted, they're very small people...

555
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,233
but a person's a person,
no matter how small.

556
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,777
- Huh.
- How—

558
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,156
You just crossed the line, Horton...

559
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,909
and I'm gonna make you pay.

561
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,206
Uh— Uh— Ohh!

562
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,250
That Horton is a menace.

563
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,671
He has those kids using their imaginations.
It's sick!

564
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:07,842
All right, I gotta get this speck up to the top
of Mount Nool A.S.A.P.—

565
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,844
whatever that means.

566
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,346
Probably,
"Act swiftly, awesome pachyderm."

567
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,890
I mean, how hard can that be?

568
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:25,192
It'sjust a straight plummet to certain death.

569
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:30,531
This looks kind of... precarious.

570
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,200
Well, no need to worry.

571
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,202
Obviously, when they
build a bridge like this...

572
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,706
they take into account
that elephants will be crossing here.

573
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,751
All right. Feels good.

574
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,753
I'll just get...

575
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,547
the... feel of it!

577
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,928
Yike!

580
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,441
Oh, that's― that's true.

584
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,784
All right!

585
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,953
Hello. And how are we today,
Mr. Mayor?

586
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,707
Say "ahh."

587
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,418
Ahh.

588
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,588
Aaah!

589
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,468
Hmm.

590
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,553
Rinse, please.

591
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:41,435
Huh. I think a few
of these boards could stand to be replaced.

592
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,982
Ooh!

594
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,781
I just need to think light.

595
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:58,953
I'm light as a feather.

596
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,336
Heavy feather.

597
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,338
Okay.

598
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,591
This will just pinch a little.

599
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,679
l'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?

600
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,724
Air!

601
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,726
There's nothin' lighter.

602
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,895
So it stands to reason—

603
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,482
that the more air I have—

604
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,776
the lighter—

605
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,862
I'll be.

608
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,220
La-aah!

614
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,739
- Aah!
- Next, please.

615
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,033
All right,
that was absolutely terrifying.

616
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,368
If I just pull myself up—

617
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:26,373
Try not to panic.

620
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,723
Hmm.

621
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,562
Whew! That could have been a disaster.

622
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,401
Wow. I feel really good right now.

623
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,321
Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.

624
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,501
Whoa.

627
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,597
All right.

628
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,101
Hey! JoJo, I need your help.
Can you help me?

629
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,521
Okay. Great. Okay, first  l need you
to go to the girls' room.

630
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,566
Aah! Take down Hannah's
china doll collection and then—

631
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,652
Stop looking at my arm. Put away
Holly's lightbulb collection and then—

632
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:41,448
You know what?Just take care
ofanything that might break or shatter.

633
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,243
Okay. Take a good, long look.

634
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,370
Got it? Thanks,JoJo.

637
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,795
Oww! Oh!
Whew!

638
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,549
Here. And I'll take that.

639
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,218
And— Oh! Aaah!

641
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,976
Hi. You're home late.

642
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,939
Oh. Sorry, hon. I wasjust having
some dental work done on my arm.

643
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,233
So, what was the— Ned!

644
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:19,695
What are you doing?

645
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,906
W-What do you mean?

646
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,950
Well, I'm no detective, Ned,
but you are hanging from the chandelier.

647
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,036
I just thought it might
look better somewhere...

648
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,080
it can't fall on us
and crush us in our sleep.

649
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,500
What is going on?

650
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,756
Hey, hon—

652
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:45,804
did you ever get the feeling
that you were being watched?

653
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,184
Um, yeah. Sure. I suppose.

654
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,395
And then you get the feeling
that maybe that thing watching you...

655
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,441
is, uh, a giant elephant.

656
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,443
Um—

657
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:04,573
And you know howyou get that weird feeling
that your world is actually a tiny speck...

658
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,575
and that the elephant...

659
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,744
that l talked about earlier...

660
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,246
is carrying it around on a flower...

661
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,833
and you realize that ifyou tell anybody,
they'd thinkyou were crazy.

662
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:19,797
But you still feel a responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

663
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,674
You know that feeling?

664
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:26,303
Um, you know,
I'm gonna have to say no.

665
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,722
Do you know that feeling?

666
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,685
Ah!
No.

667
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,312
Yawn.

668
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,983
Wow, I am beat.
Time to hit the hay, I guess.

669
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,903
Sweetheart, I know
you're under a lot ofstress.

670
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:47,491
And ifyou're seeing
elephants and flowers, then fine.

671
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,536
Just don't tell anyone else
that story. Okay?

672
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,874
And remember,
it's not the end ofthe world.

673
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,711
The end ofthe world?

674
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:02,423
Horton to Mayor. Horton to Mayor.
Come in, Mayor. Over.

675
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,302
Horton? Ohh.

676
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,388
I get terrible reception here.

677
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,266
How about this?
If I get up real close, can you read me?

679
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,480
Yep. Roger that.

680
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,983
Are we at that safe place yet?

681
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,278
Almost. I'm pretty sure
the worst part's over.

682
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,280
This is your elephant speaking.

683
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,950
Just sit back, enjoy the ride,
and we'll have you to Mount Nool in no time.

684
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,953
- No, you can't have ice cream for breakfast.
- Please!

685
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,956
Who's that?
Is there someone else there?

686
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,542
Well, that's my wife and kids.

687
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,378
- You have a family.
- I do indeed.

688
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,882
A beautiful wife, 96 daughters...

689
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,592
and one son.

690
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,427
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Busy guy.

691
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,305
And we all share one bathroom.
You know how that is.

692
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,224
Yeah. Don't I know it?

693
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,226
Bathroom?

694
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,395
- Ned?
- What?

695
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,814
Sweetheart, you know
you're on the roof, right?

696
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,817
- Please, Mom.
- What's that? No, you need to go to bed.

697
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,196
Daddy's having a breakdown.
Ned, what are you up to now?

698
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,241
I wasjust about to put the kids to bed
when I got offthe roof.

699
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,286
And, uh, that's—
that's what happened. Right.

702
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,678
- Daddy?
- Yes?

703
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,681
- Can I have a glass ofwater?
- Ofcourse.

704
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,766
- Me two!
- Me three!

705
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,851
- Me six!
- Me seven!

706
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,937
- Me 39!
- Me 28!

707
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,730
Okay.

708
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,446
- Hey,JoJo. Whoa.
- Huh?

709
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:53,450
Lotta liquid. Lotta liquid.
Just the person I wanted to see.

710
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:58,038
Yeah, I realize that we have not been
seeing eye to eye lately.

711
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:02,126
And most of it is my fault.
That's true.

712
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,128
You know what I've been
trying to do?

713
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,923
I have been trying to impose
my vision ofyour future on you.

714
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,509
Let me make this perfectly clear.

715
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:15,430
JoJo, you can be
whatever kind of mayoryou want to be.

716
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,851
Hands-on, strong and silent, outspoken—
it's up to you.

717
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:22,646
Well, good.
I feel so much better.

718
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,483
I am expecting big things from you,
young man. Big things!

719
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,485
All right. Good night.

720
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,571
Good stuff. Good talk.

721
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,505
Then JoJo snuck out, feeling lonely and sad...

722
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,592
and tragically misunderstood
by his dad.

723
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,818
And where was he going
at such a late hour?

724
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,949
Up to Who-ville's
abandoned star-studying tower...

725
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,996
a place where the boy
felt contented and free...

726
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,499
a place he could be
what he wanted to be.

727
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,296
And what was inside there,
 l'd say if I could.

728
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,133
But up above,
the kangaroo was up to no good.

729
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,601
Can l come out now, Mom?

730
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,603
No, Rudy. Stay in your room.

731
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,647
- But, Mom—
- Stay inside.

732
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,660
Mr. Vladikoff?

733
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:15,175
Eating. Go.

734
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,679
Yes, I-I realize you're busy,
but I need your help.

735
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,681
It's Horton.

736
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,308
He's become obsessed
with a clover...

737
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,603
and he actually thinks
there are little people on it.

739
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,400
I want that clover destroyed.

740
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,528
Sure. What a big deal this is...
foryou, bro.

741
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:38,657
I'd do it myself, but, being a lady...

742
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,994
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

743
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,579
But I hearyou have
no problem with that.

744
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:49,209
No. No problem.

745
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,211
Easy peasy.

746
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,381
But I will only do this
for a price...

747
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,135
in exchange
for a brand-new pair of―

748
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,970
No.

749
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,972
This...

750
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,141
- little kangaroo.
- Mom!

751
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,436
Quiet, Rudy.
Mommy's thinking it over.

752
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,979
Huh.

753
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,565
Well, thanks,
but on second thought...

754
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:16,445
I think I'm going to have the Wickersham
brothers take care ofthis for me.

755
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:19,489
Yeah, ofcourse, Wickersham.
I mean, they-they're classy operation.

756
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,701
They do― Wait! No!
You can't go with Wickersham!

757
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,997
No, no. No, no. The Wickershams
would be perfect for thisjob.

758
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,417
But they're monkeys!
Is not scary.

759
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,421
Oh, thanks anyway.
Maybe next time.

760
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:39,384
Wait. Here's what I will do
to precious clover.

761
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,387
I will take it, I will crush it...

762
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,849
and I will devour it.

766
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:57,152
Bigger than it look. One second.

767
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,238
Holy moly.

768
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,700
Hang on.

769
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,620
Then I regurgitate it.

770
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,540
Then I'm gonna devour it
second time.

771
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,626
So, two times devoured.

772
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,128
Sounds nice.

773
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,547
But l think I'll talk
to the Wickershams.

774
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,257
Wait.

775
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,968
Here is best part.

776
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:26,807
I do all— gratis.

777
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:30,977
That's free, bro.
What do you think?

778
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,105
Huh?

779
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,148
Deal.

780
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,150
Yes! Score!

781
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,362
Thanking you.
You won't regret.

783
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,952
Oop!

784
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,663
Whoa! Whoo!

791
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,313
Mayor!

792
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,358
Mayor!

793
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,403
Open up, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!

794
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,782
It's snowing!
In the summer!

797
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,540
Yes. Yes, it is.

798
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,542
It's a dramatic change
in the weather...

799
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,627
as if we were a speck
floating through space.

800
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:41,965
I don't know how you knew,
but s-somehow you did.

801
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:47,429
And Who-ville is headed for disaster.

802
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,182
- Oh. Horton.
- What?

803
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,809
Uh, nothing. I'm on it.

804
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,729
It's up to us to save
the people ofWho-ville.

805
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,483
- Whoa!

806
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,235
You're small, but there are
a lot ofyou. Ooh!

807
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,321
That's―

808
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,825
Okay. Anybody else?

809
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,244
Good.

810
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,830
No, no. No enjoyment. This is not fun.

811
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:17,459
It is a sign ofdoom.

812
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,419
Ah, sweetie, that's—

813
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,255
No! No, no, no, no.
Danger! Danger!

814
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,049
- Whee!
- Whoa!

815
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,885
Stop having fun immediately!

816
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,428
This is dangerous.

817
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:32,015
Okay.

818
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,059
Snowbank!

820
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:42,984
- Horton!
- Huh? What?

822
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,035
Hey there.

823
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,912
We're in big trouble down here.

824
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,831
It's happening. It's snowing
in the middle ofsummer.

825
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,125
- It's the end ofthe world!
- Whee!

826
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,422
Hold on, Mayor.
I think I know what your problem is.

828
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,431
Aw!

830
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,228
There. That better?

832
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,524
That seems to have worked.

833
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,193
Do I smell peanuts?

834
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,862
Yeah. They're my favorite snack.

835
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,615
But they tend to linger.

836
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,451
Bleh!

837
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:36,162
Oh!
Finwick, no.

838
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,207
Uh-oh. Hang on, Mr. Mayor.

839
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,378
I may have to put up a fight.
A frightened elephant can be very dangerous!

840
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,007
All right! You've called down
the thunder, buddy!

841
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:51,344
You hungry for trouble?
I'm an all-you-can-eat salad bar. Take a bite!

842
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,765
I hate running.

843
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,767
Morton?

844
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,978
Don't do that.

845
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,314
Horton!

846
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,025
Horton— D'oh!
There you are.

847
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,902
We got trouble. Wait.
Stay, wait. Did you hear that?

848
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,946
No, I'm here.
Okay, listen. No. Go.

849
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,907
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

850
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,619
She's telling everyone that you
should be kicked out of Nool.

851
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,580
She said that?
I thought we were friends.

852
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,541
- Word is she's gone to Vlad.
- Vlad?

853
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,294
Vlad. I know two Vlads.

854
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:28,173
Is it the bad Vlad
or the bunny Vlad that makes the cookies?

855
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:31,968
Yeah, Horton, she's sending you
a bunny with cookies.

856
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,638
I think we can assume
it's the bad Vlad.

857
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,348
Yeah, that's a good call.

858
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:41,019
So unless you're cool
with giant, razor-sharp claws...

859
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,647
ripping the flesh offyour body...

860
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,440
I'd get rid ofthe clover.

861
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,360
I can't. I promised the mayor.

862
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,529
I meant what  l said,
and I said what I meant.

863
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,823
And an elephant's faithful 1 00%.

864
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,868
Please, for me,just this once...

865
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,621
be faithful 99% ofthe time.

866
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,790
I've never gotten 99% on anything.

867
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,792
And l think I'm awesome.
So come on.

868
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:08,254
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant.

869
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,715
I'm not gonna say it.

870
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,801
You can do that all day.
It's not happening.

871
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,513
- An elephant's faithful 1 00%.
- That's right.

872
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:20,475
That's my code, my motto.
But thanks for the warning.

873
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,852
"Motto." Okay.

874
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,896
But watch the skies.

875
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,109
Keep watching the skies!

876
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,199
Mayor! You need to get
everyone underground now!

877
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,618
- Two, three, four.
- I don't want to sound the alarm.

878
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,995
But there's a good possibility...

879
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,998
- we may be attacked by a giant, carnivorous bird.
- What?

880
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,460
There's a small chance it could be a bunny
with cookies, but I wouldn't count on it.

881
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,256
Oh, they are formidable. Whoop.

882
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,425
Mayor? Are you there?

883
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,427
Yeah. No, that's a great idea.

884
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,388
It'sjust—
In order to get everyone mobilized...

885
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,015
I'd need the okay
ofthe city council.

886
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,768
And they never listen to me.

887
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,646
I've been called a boob—
several times.

888
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:07,647
I can't do it.

889
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,567
You have to talk to them, Mayor.
Okay, listen.

891
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,405
Bad Vlad! Bad Vlad!

892
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,366
Ooh! Bad Vlad!

895
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,417
That is definitely not a bunny.

896
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,593
Lost him.

897
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:39,429
Meant to lose him, and I lost him.
Heh. Yeah.

900
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,561
This tree for real?
Come on.

901
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,606
Hang on, Who-ville!
This is gonna get rough!

902
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,109
Oh!

905
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,869
Now you're going to get it!

906
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,789
Get ready for the best!

908
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,543
Leave me alone!

909
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,254
Hort― Ow!

910
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,217
Horton!

913
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,769
Whew!

914
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,313
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.

915
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,857
- Hello.

919
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,495
Ooph!

922
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:54,212
"Chessmate."

923
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,798
Now it's time for me
to take clover...

924
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,842
and crush all
the little people on it.

925
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,095
Sorry, this is where we get off.

927
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:09,018
Right in the beak!

928
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,396
Cool line.

929
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,481
Usually I can't think
ofthose things till later.

930
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,942
- Mayor?
- Ah, Horton.

931
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,404
- Are you okay?
- Um—

933
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:25,368
Well, more or less.

934
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,788
- What happened? The bird?
- Yeah, it attacked me.

935
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,040
Mayor, your people are in danger.

936
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,335
Huh? You know what?
I'm gonna do it.

937
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,463
I am going to go out there
and tell them what is going on.

938
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,924
Perfect. Now, quick, get going.

940
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,516
Hey, Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!

941
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,810
My basement is in the attic!

942
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,187
- The science museum is history!
- The Lost and Found is missing!

943
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,440
What's going on, Mr. Mayor?

944
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,984
I'm declaring a state ofemergency!

945
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,904
 Don't worry! Don't worry!

946
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,656
The mayor is just being a moron.

947
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,910
No, wait! Who-ville is in terrible danger.

948
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:11,623
Everyone needs to get down
to the underground storage area immediately!

949
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:16,419
Fine! Fine.
Let's do this democratically.

950
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:21,883
Who wants thejoy and glory
and festivity ofthe Who-centennial...

951
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,927
to proceed as planned?

953
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:30,433
- And who, like the mayor—
- Uh—

954
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,478
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-centennial...

955
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:36,856
in an underground storage area?

956
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,609
Yeah!

957
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,488
Wait! You've got to listen to me!

958
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,449
Our whole world could explode!

960
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,956
Much more quickly!

961
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,958
And ourworld wouldn't
make that noise.

962
00:54:55,042 --> 00:55:00,213
The people have spoken, Mr. Mayor.

963
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:04,300
You're finished.
No one believes you.

964
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,637
No one supports you.

965
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,515
Horton believes me.

966
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,059
Horton?

967
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,061
Who's Horton?

968
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:20,566
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky!

969
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,069
- Huh?
- Don't bother looking. He's invisible.

970
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,864
And he's the one
risking his life to get Who-ville—

971
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:31,786
which, by the way,
is a speck on a clover― to safety!

975
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,760
l can prove it.
Horton's voice comes out ofthis horn.

976
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,806
He's lost his mind.

977
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,599
Horton!

978
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:57,687
I have all the Whos
gathered in Town Square.

979
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,064
Let them knowyou're there!

980
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:02,692
Gee.

981
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,111
This is kind ofa high-pressure
situation then.

982
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,363
l don't hear anything.

983
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,241
Wow. I am really drawing a blank here.

984
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,243
I know!

986
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,582
Horton.

987
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,834
Horton, we're waiting.

988
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,795
Time to show everyone
that you exist...

989
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,800
and, by extension,
what a non-boob I am.

992
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,351
Wait! Everyone, look at the wind.

993
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,771
What do you think that that means?

994
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,316
It means—

995
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,943
It means, obviously―

996
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:50,198
Let the kite-flying race begin!

998
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:10,301
What a burn on you, Horton!

1005
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,109
Ooh! Brain freeze!

1008
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,743
Give me back...

1009
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,579
- my speck!
- Huh?

1010
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,248
Not this time, guy.

1012
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,839
I am so sorry that I let you down.

1013
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:34,135
But this― This is bigger than me.

1014
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,013
Get the family together
and get somewhere safe!

1015
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,683
I will! I believe you.

1017
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,108
I've got you now, elephant.

1018
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:52,320
No! No! No!

1020
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,124
Oh, no.

1021
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,128
Oh!

1023
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,800
Yeah!

1026
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,071
Mayor?

1027
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,783
Anybody there? Hello?

1028
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,953
Anyone?

1029
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:45,081
But clover by clover by clover, he found...

1030
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:48,876
that the one that he sought for
was just not around.

1031
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,962
Mayor?

1032
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,674
Hello?

1033
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,760
And by noon,
poor Horton, more dead than alive...

1034
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:02,556
had picked, searched and piled up
nine thousand and five.

1035
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,101
Hello?

1036
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,312
Sorry to botheryou, nobody.

1037
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:15,027
Knock, knock.

1038
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:18,614
This is where you'd say,
"Whos there?"

1039
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:22,827
If there were any Whos there.

1040
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,622
Get it? "Whos there?"

1042
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,671
All day he looked, looked on and on...

1043
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,341
until his hope was almost gone.

1044
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,343
No, no.

1045
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:41,429
No! Please, no!

1046
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,556
Oh! This isn't fair!

1047
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,687
But wait!

1048
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:53,733
Could this one be the one?
Was all his searching finally done?

1049
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,652
Ah, yes.
For this was the hour.

1050
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:00,489
Horton had found them
on the three-millionth flower.

1051
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:04,910
Mayor! Mayor! I found you!

1052
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,539
Mayor?

1053
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,541
Are you there?

1054
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,710
Mayor?

1056
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:17,590
Mayor.

1057
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,474
Mayor, are you there?

1058
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,187
Mayor.

1059
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:42,239
Mayor?

1060
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,827
Mayor!

1062
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:58,047
Uh, no. This is Floyd.

1063
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,634
Can I take a message?

1064
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:07,348
Mayor! You're okay!

1066
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,894
Horton! Horton!
Stop! Stop it!

1068
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,276
Sorry. It must've been rough down there.

1069
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:23,072
l can't believe I found you.
You really had me worried.

1070
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,659
Say! The mayor was right!

1071
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,661
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1072
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,663
Oh! Okay, I'm all right.

1073
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,832
- Toof!
- And so are you.

1074
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:39,797
Citizens ofWho-ville!

1075
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:46,387
I'd like you to meet
our friend Horton.

1077
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:54,562
He's going to help us.

1078
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:56,564
l've got this.

1079
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,150
- This is the chairman.
- Idiot!

1080
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,694
You're finished in this town.
Is that understood?

1081
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,071
Finished! You boob!

1082
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:08,159
No, I'm justjoking.

1083
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,702
Oh.

1085
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,955
Good one.

1086
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,624
Horton, this is my wife, Sally.

1087
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,627
You exist!
This means my husband isn't crazy.

1088
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,963
Hooray!

1089
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,215
And a few of my daughters:

1090
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,427
- Haley, Holly, Hooly, Hilda and Hedy.
- Hi!

1091
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:30,139
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.

1092
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,392
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us!

1093
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:37,521
And Burt from Accounting.
And Mrs. McGillicuddy and Mr. Farfoogan.

1094
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,356
- From the Clugan Farfoogans.
- Oi! Oi! Oi!

1095
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,192
And the old man in the bathtub.

1096
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:44,612
Let's not overwhelm the poor fella.
He's never gonna remember all these names.

1097
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,948
Well, I'll try my best...

1098
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:50,910
Sally, Chairman...

1099
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,454
Haley, Hooly, Holly, Hilda, Hedy.
Miss Yelp.

1100
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,331
Dr. Larue, Burt from Accounting,
Mrs. McGillicuddy...

1101
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,208
Mr. Farfoogan
ofthe Clugan Farfoogans.

1102
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,336
And wasn't there an old guy
in a shower?

1103
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,671
- Mmm, bathtub.
- Ooh! Yeah.

1104
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,382
We're all here, Horton.

1105
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:09,303
And we all believe in you.

1106
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,305
Wow. That's awesome.

1107
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,350
And it's a responsibility
l do not take lightly.

1108
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:18,479
l promise you a future
that is safe, sound and stable.

1109
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:23,817
We will create a world where every Who
is endowed with three inalienable rights...

1110
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,819
to be determined at a later date.

1111
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:29,782
And, uh, we will, uh,
put a speck on Mount Nool...

1112
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,117
before the end ofthis, uh, decade.

1113
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,040
Oh!

1114
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,751
This-This elephant is crazy!

1115
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,295
Oh, my goodness.
I gotta tell everybody.

1116
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,257
I need to get to the kangaroo. Whoo!

1117
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,467
Wait till they find out about― Oh!

1118
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:52,263
Oh! You should have been seeing me.
l really let elephant have it.

1119
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,265
I chase him. I torment him.

1120
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,725
I break him into million
little elephant pieces.

1121
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,270
It was thing of beauty. Really.

1122
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,730
My best work. Classic Vlad.

1123
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,567
- And the clover?
- Clover is finished.

1124
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,986
No way in million years
Horton find it.

1125
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,614
Read my beak.
Clover is gone forever.

1128
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,914
I just saw Horton,
and he is still talkin' to that clover!

1130
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:25,254
ldiot!

1131
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,965
Whoa. Come on.
I'm your bro.

1132
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,634
It's me you are talking to.
We have history.

1133
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:33,804
Come on. Let's not forget—
I did this for free.

1134
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:38,183
What is happening
to theJungle of Nool?

1135
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,687
There once was a time
when people were people...

1136
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,732
- and specks were specks.
- Mm-hmm.

1137
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:48,485
Well, I say,
ifyou can't see it, hear it or feel it...

1138
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,529
it doesn't exist!

1139
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,366
Our way of life is under attack.

1140
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:57,244
And who's leading that attack? Horton!

1141
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,787
Whoa!

1142
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,623
Whoa! Whoa!

1143
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,167
Wait a minute.
This is Horton we're talking about.

1144
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,086
You all know him.
He wouldn't hurt a fly―

1145
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,715
except for that fly city he sat on,
but he didn't do that on purpose.

1146
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,634
Shut up, mouse.

1147
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,553
Yeah. That's weird.

1148
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,014
My brownies are burning.
I gotta go.

1149
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,392
Are we going to let
troublemakers like Horton...

1150
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,437
poison the minds ofour children?

1151
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,564
Not the children!

1152
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:30,444
When Horton tells the children
about worlds beyond thejungle...

1153
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,072
he makes them question authority―

1154
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:37,284
which leads to defiance,
which leads to anarchy!

1155
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:40,037
Yeah! Horton must pay!

1156
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,624
- It's that speck!
- We have to do something!

1157
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,377
- For the children!
- For the children!

1158
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:51,131
Are we going to let him
get away with this?

1159
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,676
No!

1160
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,844
Let's get him!

1164
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,407
Hmm?

1165
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:19,368
Morton?

1166
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,413
l told you— 100%!

1167
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,081
Horton!

1168
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,959
Morton, pick up your feet. Geez!

1169
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,044
It's not me!

1170
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:33,340
Oh. I see. It's an angry mob.

1171
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,593
Sorry, Morton. I thought it was you
that was making all the―

1172
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,430
But it's― Oh, darn.

1173
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,181
Everybody! Come on!

1174
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,434
Run, Horton!

1175
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,978
- There he is!
- Get the speck!

1176
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,813
Let's rope him!

1177
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,524
Let's cage him!

1178
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,443
No!

1180
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,992
Stop!

1181
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:04,121
Hey, fellas. Good to see ya— all at once.

1182
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,956
You look really great as a horde.

1183
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,958
Horton, Horton, Horton.

1184
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:11,879
Look at the mess
you've created foryourself.

1185
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:15,507
All this hullabaloo
over a silly little flower.

1186
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,760
It's a speck.

1187
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,888
Right. I mean, it's silly, really...

1188
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:24,516
all this talk of roping you
and caging you, and, well...

1189
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,352
we don't need to go
into the details.

1190
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:31,982
The point is, this angry mob,
all-all the trouble you're in—

1191
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,651
it can all go away.

1192
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,946
Really?

1193
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,282
Of course.

1194
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,452
All you have to do
is admit to everyone...

1195
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:47,247
that there are no little people
living on that speck...

1196
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:51,877
that you were wrong and I was right.

1197
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:56,882
You do that, and things can go
right back to the way they were.

1198
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,552
But ifyou don't...

1199
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:04,139
you're going to have
to pay the price.

1202
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:13,607
Heh. So l just have
to say it isn't true.

1203
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,110
Hmm.

1204
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:22,199
Go ahead— rope me, cage me.

1205
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,201
Do whateveryou want.

1206
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,203
But there are people
on this speck...

1207
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:30,833
and they have a mayor who has 96 daughters
and one son named JoJo...

1208
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,877
who all share a bathroom,
whatever that is.

1210
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,799
And even though
you can't hear or see them at all...

1211
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:42,803
a person's a person,
no matter how small.

1212
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:46,139
Huh? Hmm?

1213
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:52,521
That was beautiful, Horton.

1214
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,815
Rope him! Cage him!

1215
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:58,902
Burn that speck
in a pot of boiling Beezlenut oil!

1216
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,654
Hmm.

1218
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:04,867
They don't believe we're here.

1219
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,411
We've got to make some noise!

1220
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,746
We are here! We are here!
We are here!

1221
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,915
We are here. We are here. We are here.

1222
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,251
- We are here! We are here!
- Come on!

1223
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,128
We are here! We are here!

1224
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,463
- Everybody!
- We are here! We are here!

1225
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,799
We are here! We are here!
We are here!

1229
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:32,936
This will teach you not to make up stories
about people on specks!

1230
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:35,480
Listen. There they are!

1231
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,653
- Rope him!
- Cage him!

1232
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,864
It's not working.

1233
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,741
I can hearyou, but their ears
aren't strong enough.

1234
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:48,160
We need to be louder!

1235
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,622
Get every Who to make noise!
Everyone!

1236
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:54,750
We are here!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1237
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,461
JoJo, where are you going?

1238
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:00,797
We need every voice! JoJo!

1239
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,011
You need to make some noise
down there...

1240
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,263
or we'll all be destroyed!

1241
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:11,850
The mayor grabbed a tom-tom
and started to smack it.

1243
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:17,105
And all over Who-ville,
they whooped up a racket.

1245
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:22,277
They rattled tin kettles.
They beat on brass pans.

1246
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,488
On garbage pail tops
and old cranberry cans.

1247
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:27,783
They blew on bazookas
and blasted great toots.

1248
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,369
On clarinets, oom-pahs
and boom-pahs and flutes.

1251
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,790
There!

1252
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,750
We are here!
We are here!

1253
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,794
Can they hear us now?

1254
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,963
Listen, please!

1255
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,048
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

1256
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,050
- I don't hear nothin'!

1257
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,220
I don't think so.
But keep trying!

1258
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,473
I'll never give in!

1260
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:59,815
Are you sure that every Who
down in Who-ville is trying?

01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,128
No!

1313
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,966
We are here! We are here!

1315
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:17,888
Yopp!

1316
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:21,600

1318

1319
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:31,401
I hear it! I hear it!

1320
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,028
They are there!

1321
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,738
And that "yopp"...

1322
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,365
that one small extra "yopp"
put it over...

1323
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,410
and all the Who noises
burst out ofthe clover.

1324
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,245
- I hear it!
- Me too!
- So do I!

1325
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,372
We are here!
We are here!

1326
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,334
Rudy, give me that.
Come. Ru—

1327
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:53,340
Rudy, get back in the pouch. Now.

1328
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,135
No, Mom.

1329
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,764
Wha— Wickershams, get that clover!

1330
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:07,229
Well, a-anybody, take it from him.

1331
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,814
- Hmm?
- Oh!

1332
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,743
You did it, Mayor. You did it.

1333
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,828
We did it!

1335
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:30,710
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1336
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,924
Well done, Son.

1337
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,134
All right, Mayor!

1338
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:41,346
Dad! You're one ofthe greats.

1340
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,144
Whoa! Easy, everyone. Easy!

1341
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:52,148
Oh, hi, Vlad.

1343
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:57,237
Well, I shouldn't, but—

1346
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:28,643
Oh, man, that is nice touch.

1347
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:31,146
I am a mess with this, right?
Emotional!

1348
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,815
Here come the waterslide!

1349
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:37,193
There's so many people to thank―

1350
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,195
the good people of Nool...

1351
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,574
- who put me in a cage and poked me with sticks.
- That was me!

1352
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,995
My buddy Morton, for being the only one
who stood by me. Well, not right by me.

1353
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:50,623
He hid in the bushes,
sending me good thoughts. He's small.

1354
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:53,251
Dude, you are a warrior poet.

1355
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:56,629
And most ofall,
I'd like to thank the mayor ofWho-ville...

1356
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,840
who believed in me
from the beginning.

1357
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,635
Oh, Horton.
We're going to miss you.

1358
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,346
Gee.

1359
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,681
What are we gonna do
without you, Horton?

1360
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:10,894
Aw, don't worry.
I'll always be around.
