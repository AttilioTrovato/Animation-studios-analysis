1
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,450
Hello?

2
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,830
Hello.

3
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,550
<i>Who's there?

4
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,180
This is the Mayor.

5
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,010
The Mayor? The Mayor!

6
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,930
I'm talking to the Mayor!

7
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,230
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
I knew there was life on this speck.

8
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,560
"This speck"? What speck?

9
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,400
Well, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, but...

10
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,950
<i>You're living on a speck.

11
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,660
Well, I hate to disagree with you,
O voice from the drainpipe,

12
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,750
but I live in Whoville.

13
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,330
Well, then, Whoville's a speck.

14
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,460
<i>Right.

15
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,380
Okay, seriously, who is this?

16
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,300
Is this Burt from accounting?

17
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,340
No. This is Horton. I'm an elephant.

18
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,760
Okay, "Horton."

19
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,140
Fake name. Where are you?

20
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,600
<i>Well, from where you're standing,
<i>I guess I'm in the sky.

21
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,730
Compared to you, I'm enormous.

22
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,400
Which is saying something,
because I've slimmed down quite a bit.

23
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,730
I swim.

24
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,490
Your whole world fits on a flower
in my world.

25
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,530
Oh, man, this is even pushing it
for you, Burt.

26
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,740
Don't believe me? Watch what happens
when I put you in the shade.

27
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,080
This is absolutely impossible...

28
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,330
<i>Dark.

29
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,420
Light.

30
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,090
<i>Dark.

31
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:01,090
Light. Dark, light, dark, light,
dark, light, dark.

32
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,470
<i>Light!

33
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,390
Don't you see?

34
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,220
<i>We're in the middle of some kind of
<i>amazing cosmic convergence.

35
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,100
<i>Two vastly different worlds,
<i>miraculously crossing paths!

36
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,900
Mine, colossal! Yours, miniscule.

37
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,780
Yet somehow we've managed
to make contact.

38
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,990
<i>If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.
