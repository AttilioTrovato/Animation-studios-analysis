It's happening!

9

Wait up, guys!

10
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:34,355
The baby's coming!
The baby's coming!

11
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,940
- Watch it!
- I'm having a baby!

12
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:39,444
- Code Blue! Code Blue!
- Or pink if it's a girl!

13
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:42,697
Having a baby! Having a baby!
I'm coming, Ellie!

14
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:44,407
We got it!

15
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,048
Ellie! Ellie!

16
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:03,218
Ellie, where are you? Where am I?

17
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:04,469
Manny?

18
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,806
I told you it was just a kick.

19
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:13,728
Oh, right! Right! Whew! Wow.

20
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:19,359
You really gave daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly!

21
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:22,737
Daddy fall down cliff
and go boom, boom, boom.

22
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:25,657
Silly daddy. Yeah.

23
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:33,414
Sorry, folks! False alarm!
It was just a kick!

24
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:38,419
- You know who I'd like to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.

25
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:41,798
All right, show's over, break it up!
Break it up!

26
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:45,260
I see someone else
who has a bun in the oven!

27
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:47,137
I'm not pregnant!

28
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:51,850
That's too bad.
You'd make a wonderful mother!

29
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:57,939
Manny, I know you're excited. I am, too.
But you're getting a little carried away.

30
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:02,819
Okay, okay!
Boy, you're starting to sound like Diego.

31
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,072
Wait a second. Where is Diego?

32
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:01,044
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

33
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,964
My hooves are burning, baby!
They are burning!

34
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,842
Look at this. I got to tip-toe!
I got to tip-toe!

35
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,344
Eat my dust, dingo!

36
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:15,600
Now? Can I look now?

37
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:18,519
Easy. Don't freak out the baby.

38
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:22,398
The baby's fine. It's the freaked-out daddy
I'm worried about.

39
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,359
No peeking!

40
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,196
Voilà! Playground for Junior!

41
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:30,990
Wow.

42
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:41,084
It's amazing!

43
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:53,680
Manny.

44
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:56,557
I made it myself. Our family.

45
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,816
Hey, why aren't I up there?

46
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,486
- You can be on ours.
- You'd fit right in!

47
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,571
Thanks!

48
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:15,493
Of course, it's still a work in progress.
A few rough edges here and there.

49
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,622
I don't believe it.
You're trying to baby-proof nature.

50
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:23,501
Baby-proof nature? Get out of here.
That's ridiculous.

51
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:29,590
Manny, this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in.

52
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:30,883
You can't change that.

53
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:34,262
Of course I can.
I'm the biggest thing on Earth!

54
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:38,850
Okay, Big Daddy. I can't wait to see
how you handle the teen years.

55
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:45,106
Come on, Sid!
I don't want you touching anything.

56
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,109
This place is for kids. Are you a kid?

57
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,486
Don't answer that.

58
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,459
Diego! There you are.

59
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:06,002
You missed the big surprise!

60
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,005
Right. Right. I'll check it out later.

61
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,673
Okay. See you.

62
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,135
You know, I think there's
something bothering Diego.

63
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,137
No, I'm sure everything's fine.

64
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,347
You should talk to him.

65
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,141
Guys don't talk to guys
about guy problems.

66
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:23,102
We just punch each other
on the shoulders.

67
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,146
That's stupid.

68
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,317
To a girl. To a guy,
that's like six months of therapy.

69
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,987
Okay, okay, I'm going.

70
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:38,326
Hey.

71
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:43,664
Why'd you do that?

72
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,583
I don't know.

73
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,920
So, listen,

74
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:53,257
Ellie thinks there's
something bothering you. I told her...

75
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:56,052
Actually, I've been thinking that soon

76
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,846
it might be time for me to head out.

77
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:03,518
Okay. So I'll just tell her that you're fine.
It was nothing.

78
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:07,105
Look, who are we kidding, Manny?
I'm losing my edge.

79
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:10,066
I'm not really built
for chaperoning play dates.

80
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,526
What are you talking about?

81
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,779
Having a family, that's huge,
and I'm happy for you,

82
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:17,782
but that's your adventure, not mine.

83
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:21,369
- So you don't want to be around my kid?
- No, no, no. That's...

84
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:23,454
- You're taking this the wrong way.
- No, go.

85
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,291
Go find some adventure,
Mr. Adventure Guy.

86
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:31,921
Don't let my boring domestic life
hit you in the butt on the way out.

87
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,883
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one
with the hormonal imbalance?

88
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:38,511
Manny, wait! No one has to leave.

89
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:43,307
- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.

90
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:46,561
- Why? What happened?
- Diego's leaving.

91
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,356
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

92
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:54,318
This should be the best time of our lives.
We're having a baby!

93
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:56,779
No, Sid. They're having a baby.

94
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,741
Yeah, but we're a herd, a family.

95
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,580
Look, things have changed.
Manny has other priorities now.

96
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:11,210
Face it, Sid. We had a great run,
but now it's time to move on.

97
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,922
So it's just the two of us.

98
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:17,758
No, Sid, it's not the two of us.

99
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:21,262
Crash and Eddie are coming with us?

100
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:23,764
Just Crash?

101
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:26,726
Just Eddie?

102
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,146
Bye, Sid.

103
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,244
Okay, calm down. Calm down.

104
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,874
I'm good at making friends.
I'll make my own herd. That's what I'll do.

105
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,626
Patty cake, patty cake,
baker's man...

106
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,002
Hey!

107
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,598
Well, at least you still got your looks.

108
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,027
Oh, great.

109
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:28,996
Anybody here? Anyone?

110
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,518
Hello?

111
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,487
Poor guys. I know what it's like
to feel abandoned.

112
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:10,830
Don't worry. You're not alone anymore.

113
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:45,072
There you go.

114
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,956
Okay, okay. I'm okay, I'm okay.

115
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,089
Stay here. Stay here. And you,
you take care of your brother, now.

116
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:03,758
Momma's gonna be right back.

117
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:05,676
Momma's coming, baby!

118
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,763
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

119
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:09,930
Ow!

120
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:14,101
Gotcha!

121
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,732
What did I just tell you kids?

122
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,135
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

123
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,262
Bad egg. Rotten egg!

124
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:33,889
A heart attack you almost gave me!

125
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:37,476
I'm sorry, darling.
It's just that I love you so much.

126
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:40,688
Now, I want you to meet
your Uncle Manny and your Aunt Ellie.

127
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:43,190
- Hi!
- Hello.

128
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:47,361
I'd like to present Egbert, Shelly and Yoko.

129
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:51,198
Sid, whatever you're doing, it's a bad idea.

130
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,617
Shh! My kids will hear you!

131
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:56,829
They're not your kids, Sid.
Take them back.

132
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:59,373
- You're not meant to be a parent.
- Why not?

133
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,001
First sign, stealing someone else's eggs.

134
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:05,254
Second sign, one of them
almost became an omelet.

135
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:09,175
Sid, someone's probably
worried sick looking for them.

136
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,719
No. They were underground, in ice.

137
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:15,556
If it wasn't for me, they'd be Eggsicles.

138
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:19,685
Sid, I know what you're going through.

139
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,062
You're gonna have a family, too, someday.

140
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:25,775
You're gonna meet a nice girl
with low standards,

141
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:29,028
no real options or sense of smell...

142
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:30,488
What Manny means to say is...

143
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:33,073
No, I get it. I'll take them back.

144
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:38,162
You have your family,
and I'm better off alone, by myself.

145
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,874
A fortress of solitude.

146
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,919
In the ice

147
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:47,213
forever!

148
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,132
A lone, lonely loner!

149
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,844
- That's a lot of aloneness.
- Precisely!

150
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:58,766
- Sid, wait!
- No! No, it's okay. He'll bounce back.

151
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,936
It's one of the advantages of being Sid.

152
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:15,908
Why should I take you back? I love kids!

153
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:19,245
I'm responsible, loving, nurturing.

154
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:22,248
What do you think?

155
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,543
Mmm. I knew you would agree.

156
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:32,091
Don't cry! Don't cry.

157
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,801
I'll find a dry place.

158
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:38,889
Okay.

159
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:42,268
Here, let me just dry you off.

160
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:50,234
I don't know.
Being a parent's a lot of work.

161
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,153
Maybe I'm not ready.

162
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,044
Momma!

163
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,713
Momma! Momma! Momma!

164
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,843
I'm a mommy.

165
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,056
Where's Mommy?

166
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,434
Here I am.

167
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:53,107
There you go. Nice squeaky faces.

- Play nice!
- Mommy, he's not sharing!

What is the matter with you?

197
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:15,809
I'm a single mother with three kids.

00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:48,675
You know, experts say you should
let the kids eat whatever they want!

207
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,303
Do you think my ankles look fat?

208
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:53,180
Ankles? What ankles?

00:22:57,685 --> 00:23:00,062
Ronald! Where did you come from?

Oh, no.

211
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:07,569
- Okay, come on. Spit him out.
- Mmm-mmm.

212
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,571
If you don't spit out Little Johnny,

213
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:11,990
we're leaving the playground this instant!

214
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,283
One,

215
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,077
two...

216
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,955

There we are. A picture of health.

Oh! Madison!

220
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:30,217
- Come on, barf him up.
- Sid?

221
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:33,011
Hey. Hey, Manny.

222
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,013
Little Johnny!

223
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:41,061
Wait! No, no...

224
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,607
I'm really sorry.

225
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:55,575
- This place is totaled.
- And we didn't wreck it.

226
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,786
We're losing our touch, bro.

227
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:01,581
Well, the important thing is
that no one got hurt.

228
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,667
Except for that guy.

229
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,085
And those three.

230
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:07,379
And her.

231
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:13,302
I told you to take them back,
and you kept them!

232
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:14,511
Now look what they've done!

233
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:17,055
Okay, granted,
we do have some discipline issues.

234
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,349
Eating kids is not a discipline issue!

235
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:22,102
- But he spit them out.
- Well, that's super.

236
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:25,105
Let's give him a gold star! Kid of the week!

237
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:27,107
They don't belong here, Sid.

238
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:31,069
Whatever they are,
wherever you found them, take them back.

239
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:32,863
Manny! I'm not getting rid of my kids!

I thought those guys were extinct!

244
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:20,660
Well, then that is one angry fossil. Sid!

00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,331

- Real shame.

264
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,184
He will be missed.

265
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:52,270
Oh, no, no, no. Not so fast.

00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:08,203
Oh, great. After we save Sid,
I'm gonna kill him.

272
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,374

- Age before beauty.

Okay.

281
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:00,005
We need a code word!

282
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:03,300
Yeah. Something that says,
"The baby's coming."

283
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,846
Hmm. How about, "Aaah!
The baby's coming!" How's that?

284
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:12,601

short and punchy, like...

285
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:13,935
"Peaches!"

286
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,354
- Peaches?
- I love peaches.

287
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,525
They're sweet and round and fuzzy,
just like you.

288
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:22,360
You think I'm round?

289
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:26,865

- Sightseeing!

297
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,113
- I'm looking for Sid, same as you.
- Well! Aren't you noble?

298
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:52,117
This is not the time, guys!
We need all the help we can get!

302
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:21,813
We're not getting on that thing!

303
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:24,566

Pregnant lady wants to live!
Yabba-dabba-doo!

305
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:45,962
Don't ever yabba-dabba do that again!

306
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:56,306
- I feel so puny.
- How do you think I feel?

307
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:09,486

308
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:21,456

309
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,563

310
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:13,091
Dude, you're awesome!
You're like the brother I never had!

311
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,592
Me, too!

312
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,023
Can we keep him?

313
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,236
- Buck!
- What?

314
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,197
The name's Buck. Short for Buckminster.

315
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:38,950
Long for "Buh."

316
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:43,621
A little dull.

317
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:47,041
What are you doing here?

318
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,752
- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.
- Well!

319
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:54,549
He's dead. Welcome to my world.
Now go home.

320
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,801
- Off you pop.
- Not without Sid.

321
00:33:56,927 --> 00:34:00,305
Ellie, wait.
Maybe the deranged hermit has a point.

322
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:03,057
Manny, we came this far,
we're gonna find him.

323
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,726
I got tracks.

324
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:08,438
Let's go.

325
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:10,648
Whoa!

326
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:13,318
If you go in there, you'll find your friend.

327
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,154
In the afterlife.

328
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:19,949
How do you know,
O Great and Wisely Weasely One?

329
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,250
Mmm. Yeah. Mmm.

330
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:34,172
Mommy dinosaur carrying her three babies
and some floppy green thing.

331
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,508
Yeah, we're friends
with the floppy green thing.

332
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:39,427
You got all that from the tracks?

333
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,013
No. Not really.
I saw them come through here earlier.

334
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,598
She's headed for Lava Falls.

335
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,602
That's where they care for the newborns.

336
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,940
To get there, you've got to go
through the Jungle of Misery,

337
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:54,525
across the Chasm of Death

338
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:59,113
to the Plates of Woe.

339
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:01,783
Whoa.

340
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:06,037
Okay! Good luck with the slow
descent into madness.

341
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:07,288
We're gonna go now.

342
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:10,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

343
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:13,878
What, you think this is
some sort of tropical getaway?

344
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:17,131
You can't protect your mate, mate.

345
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:20,760
What are you gonna do
with those flimsy tusks

346
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,262
when you run into the beast?

347
00:35:24,848 --> 00:35:26,391
I call him

348
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,434
Rudy.

349
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,271
Oh, good. Good. I was worried
it was something intimidating,

350
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:35,108
like "Sheldon" or "Tim."

351
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:39,028
Wait. You mean there's something
bigger than Mommy dinosaur?

352
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,571
- Aye.
- Eye?

353
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,075
Aye, aye! He's the one that gave me this!

354
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,493
Whoa!

355
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:49,706
- He gave you that patch?
- For free? That's so cool.

356
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,791
Yeah. Maybe he'll give us one, too.

357
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,381
Welcome to my world.

358
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:04,846
Abandon all hope, he who enters there!

359
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,931
All right! We get it!

360
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,059
Doom and despair, yada, yada, yada.

361
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,344
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

362
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:43,528
- Hold on.
- Why? What's wrong? Peaches?

363
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:47,907
What? No! It's just I got a funny feeling.

364
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,577
You're hungry! Low blood sugar.
There's some fruit!

365
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:55,248
- No! Manny!
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

366
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,543
This isn't exactly your playground.

367
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,712
Like I'm really gonna be afraid
of a pretty flower.

368
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,008
Bet you didn't see that coming.

369
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:10,763
- Manny!
- For the record, I blame you for this.

370
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:15,476
Stop eating our friends, plant!

371
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,609
That's it! I'm tearing it up from the roots!

372
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,446
- Do that, and it will clamp shut forever.
- What?

373
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:30,116
All right, preggers,
don't get your trunk in a knot.

374
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:31,909
I'll have them out of there
before they're digested.

375
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:33,286
Digested?

376
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,788
They'll be nothing but bones
in three minutes.

377
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,331
Well, maybe five for the fat one.

378
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,083
I'm not fat!

379
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:41,961
I feel tingly.

380
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,130
Don't say that
when you're pressed up against me.

381
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,215
Not that kind of tingly.

382
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,301
I can feel it, too.

383
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:52,096
Help! Someone help us!

384
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:53,431
Hurry!

385
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:55,308
It's time to get.

386
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,143
Buck Wild.

387
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,112
Who's fat now?

388
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,095
No!

389
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,929
Tourists.

390
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,056
Barfed on by a plant.

391
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:18,724
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

392
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:20,559
Say something.

393
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:24,563
Thanks for saving us.

394
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:27,900
Buck, will you help us find
the floppy green thing?

395
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,653
- That's not necessary!
- Yes, it is.

396
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:34,907
All right, I'll help you.

397
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,492
But I got rules.

398
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:39,870
Rule number one, always listen to Buck.

399
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:44,375
Rule number two,
stay in the middle of the trail.

400
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:46,585
Rule number three,

401
00:40:50,757 --> 00:40:53,884
he who has gas
travels at the back of the pack.

402
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,265
Come on, then. Chop, chop!

403
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:01,892
We should all have our heads examined.

404
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:05,563
That's rule number four!
Now let's go find your friend!

405
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:30,963
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.
We're gonna be fine.

406
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,883
Please stop swaying. A little nauseous.

407
00:41:39,056 --> 00:41:42,099
See? She's putting us down...

408
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:48,564
No! I'm too young to be eaten!

409
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:55,071
Nice mucus.
And I don't say that to everyone.

410
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:12,338
Listen, families get complicated!
Maybe we can work something out.

411
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:14,548
I can take them Sunday to Tuesday!

412
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:17,134
Wednesday to Friday? Weekends?

413
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,770
It's okay! Momma's okay.

414
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,025
If you eat me, it will send a bad message.

415
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:40,866
Score one for the sloth!

416
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,374
And the score's all tied up.

417
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,381
Do you think the beast will find Sid?

418
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:58,050
Or more importantly, us?

419
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,136
Rudy? Are you joking?

420
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:05,182
He's relentless.
He knows all, sees all, eats all.

421
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,227
So that's a yes.

422
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:15,693
Hey! Get off my lawn! Go on! Shoo!

423
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:22,825
I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.

424
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:25,035
You know, before he came out.

425
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,331
So you're just living down here
by your wits,

426
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,917
all on your own, no responsibilities.

427
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:35,671
Not a one. It's incredible.
No dependents, no limits.

428
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:38,757
It's the greatest life
a single guy could have.

429
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,677
Hear that? This is my kind of place.

430
00:43:41,761 --> 00:43:42,928
Hello?

431
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,763
Yeah... No, look, I can't talk right now.

432
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,057
Yeah. No, I'm trying to recover
a dead sloth.

433
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:48,225
Yeah.

434
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:51,937
No, they're following me!

435
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:54,273
I know! They think I'm crazy.

436
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:57,109
No... Okay, we're going
into the Chasm of Death.

437
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,028
I'm... I'm going to lose you.

438
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:00,321
Yeah, I love you, too.

439
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,907
All right, good-bye. Good-bye! Good-bye.

440
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:04,617
Okay! Follow me.

441
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:07,244
That's you in three weeks.

442
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:28,265
So, why do they call it
the Chasm of Death?

443
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,978
Well, we tried "Big Smelly Crack,"
but that just made everybody giggle.

444
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:35,272
Well, now what?

445
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,652
Madame.

446
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,321
Whoa! She is not doing that!

447
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:45,449
Rule number one.

448
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,285
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

449
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:52,248
Come on, mammoth!
You're supposed to have a good memory.

450
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:54,333
Always listen to Buck.

451
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:02,841
Now, eyes forward, back straight, and...

452
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:05,511
Oh, yes, breathe in the toxic fumes
and you'll probably die.

453
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:06,720
Toxic fumes?

454
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:10,349
- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!

455
00:45:11,685 --> 00:45:13,727
Geronimo!

456
00:45:23,697 --> 00:45:26,907
- Ellie, you okay?
- You have to try this!

457
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:30,661
All right, now pile on, everyone!
Couldn't be easier!

458
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:37,001
Don't panic!

459
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:39,670
Just some technical difficulties.

460
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,423
Keep holding it in, boys!

461
00:45:45,885 --> 00:45:47,595
I can't take it anymore!

462
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,346
He breathed it!

463
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:51,098
And now I'm breathing it!

464
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:56,562
Hey! We're not dead!

465
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:58,188
You sound ridiculous!

466
00:45:58,273 --> 00:46:00,482
Me? You should hear you!

467
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:07,406
All right, all right. And a one, and a two...

468
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:10,075
♪ <i>Christmas, Christmas time is here</i> ♪

469
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,161
Stop! Are you crazy?

470
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:16,540
It's not poison. Huh?

471
00:46:22,422 --> 00:46:24,465
That is so disturbing!

472
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:29,094
Stop laughing! All of you!

473
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:31,472
"Stop laughing, all of you!"

474
00:46:34,434 --> 00:46:36,644
"What's rule number one?"

475
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:42,441
They're just laughing.
What's so bad about that?

476
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,485
They died laughing!

477
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,406
Stop laughing!

478
00:46:49,783 --> 00:46:51,659
You know what's funny, though?

479
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:54,119
We're trying to save Sid,

480
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,372
and now we're all gonna die!

481
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:01,293
- And I don't even like Sid!
- Who does? He's an idiot!

482
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:08,300
Thanks for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years!

483
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:12,596
Thank you for deserting the herd!
That was totally super!

484
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:20,396
- Cootchie-cootchie-coo!
- Stop that!

485
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:22,898
Don't you see?

486
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:24,650
We're all gonna die!

487
00:47:28,988 --> 00:47:31,615
We gotta do everything, huh?

488
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:41,458
Sometimes I wet my bed!

489
00:47:41,543 --> 00:47:44,503
That's all right!
Sometimes I wet your bed!

490
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,518
Uh... I'm not sure
how much of that you could hear.

491
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:02,646
- I heard all of it.
- Right. Yeah.

492
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:06,150
- You wet my bed?
- That was gas talk, dude.

493
00:48:06,818 --> 00:48:09,486
Well, better get moving.

494
00:48:09,571 --> 00:48:11,488
Aren't we forgetting something?

495
00:48:11,573 --> 00:48:13,866
Here, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!

496
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:16,994
I'm so lonely.

497
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,222
Okay. Here you go, guys.

498
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:47,566
What? You're not gonna
eat your vegetables?

499
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:51,528
How are you gonna become
big, strong dinosaurs?

500
00:48:55,909 --> 00:49:00,704
No. I've raised them vegetarian.
It's a healthier lifestyle.

501
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:04,374
I mean, look at me.
I have the pelt of a much younger sloth.

502
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:09,087
Excuse me!
I'm trying to have a conversation here.

503
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:17,971
No, no, no. That's not for us, kids.

504
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,891
It's way too feathery and fleshy and...

505
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:22,726
And alive!

506
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:35,405
No! No, no, we do not eat
live animals, period!

507
00:49:36,825 --> 00:49:38,116
Now, go! Fly!

508
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:39,827
Be free,

509
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:44,248
Little flightless bird.

510
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:48,126
My bad.

511
00:49:48,962 --> 00:49:51,088
Hey, where are you going?

512
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:53,382
This is how you resolve conflict?

513
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:54,842
No wonder you're single!

514
00:49:59,848 --> 00:50:02,140
Come on. Am I talking to myself here?

515
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:04,810
I say, "They're vegetarian."
You say, "Grrr."

516
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:07,396
I say, "Can we talk about talk this?"
You say, "Grrr."

517
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,647
I don't call that communication.

518
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:12,609
See? That's your answer to everything.

519
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:28,375
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on Earth!

520
00:50:32,714 --> 00:50:34,214
Aren't you?

521
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:37,551
Whoa!

522
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:38,802
Hey!

523
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:50,063
They'll never
survive. It's dangerous by day.

524
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:51,940
But it's even worse at night.

525
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:54,276
Plus, their guide is a lunatic.

526
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,695
What? You mean, Buck? He's wacko!

527
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:57,863
I am not!

528
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:59,031
Totally bonkers.

529
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:00,282
And his feet smell.

530
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:01,700
Shut up! You shut up.

531
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,493
Oh, you little...

532
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:04,828
Gotcha!

533
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:06,997
He's strangling his own foot.

534
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,416
- Shouldn't we get moving?
- What?

535
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:12,377
And give Rudy a midnight snack?
Not likely!

536
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,421
The skull's right.
Take a load off, mammals.

537
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:15,923
We'll camp here.

538
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:17,507
Now, who's hungry?

539
00:51:17,592 --> 00:51:18,634
I am!

540
00:51:18,718 --> 00:51:20,886
You don't need the calories!

541
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,354
There I was, my back
against the wall, no way out,

542
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,733
perched on the razor's edge of oblivion,

543
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:39,404
staring into the eye
of the Great White Beast.

544
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,219
- Were you killed?
- Sadly, yes.

545
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:45,470
But I lived!

546
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:46,805
Whew!

547
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:48,557
- Oh...
- Shh.

548
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:52,978
Never had I felt so alive
than when I was so close to death.

549
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,314
Just before Rudy could suck me
down his gullet,

550
00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:58,442
I grabbed hold of that gross, pink,
fleshy thing

551
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,360
that dangles at the back of the throat.

552
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:04,990
I hung onto that sucker, and I swung
back and forth,

553
00:53:05,116 --> 00:53:09,995
and back and forth, and back and forth,
and back and forth, and back

554
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:13,081
and forth, and back and forth,

555
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:16,835
until finally, I let go
and I shot right out of his mouth!

556
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:22,257
I may have lost an eye that day,
but I got this!

557
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:25,469
- Rudy's tooth!
- Dang!

558
00:53:26,095 --> 00:53:28,388
It's like the old saying, "An eye for a tooth,"

559
00:53:28,473 --> 00:53:31,683
"a nose for a chin, a butt for a..."

560
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:35,645
Well, it's an old saying,
but it's not a very good one.

561
00:53:35,772 --> 00:53:38,899
- You are Super Weasel!
- Ultra-Weasel!

562
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,317
Diesel Weasel!

563
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:45,322
Hmm.

564
00:53:45,448 --> 00:53:46,948
What? He is.

565
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,160
Now let me tell you about the time
I used a sharpened clam shell

566
00:53:50,286 --> 00:53:52,704
to turn a T-Rex into a T-Rachel.

567
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,164
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

568
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:55,290
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

569
00:53:55,374 --> 00:53:57,709
That's enough fairy tales for one night.

570
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:00,378
Come on, Ellie, you should rest now.

571
00:54:00,505 --> 00:54:02,506
Life of the party.

572
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:05,342
All right, you guys get some shut-eye.
I'll keep watch.

573
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:09,846
Don't worry, Buck. We got this.
Night time is possum time.

574
00:54:09,972 --> 00:54:12,307
Yeah! We own the night, baby.

575
00:54:26,823 --> 00:54:28,532
Good night, Rudy.

576
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:43,046
Wait, wait. What about me?

577
00:54:58,104 --> 00:55:01,273
Sleep well, kids!
We have a busy day tomorrow.

578
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:03,733
Foraging, hunting,

579
00:55:05,778 --> 00:55:07,737
missing my friends,

580
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,782
who probably aren't missing me.

581
00:55:24,964 --> 00:55:27,048
You're a real softie, you know that?

582
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,115
Manny?

583
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,623
Crash? Eddie?

584
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:04,961
Manny?

585
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:26,274
What's going on? Are you okay?

586
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:30,278
I'm sorry. I just wanted to keep you safe,

587
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:33,740
and now you're in the most dangerous
place in the world.

588
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,159
Hey. This isn't your fault.

589
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:39,663
It's bigger than both of us.
We have to get Sid.

590
00:56:40,206 --> 00:56:43,333
Yeah, but if I had been
a better friend to him,

591
00:56:43,709 --> 00:56:46,211
- We wouldn't be here.
- Better friend?

592
00:56:46,462 --> 00:56:48,630
Are you plucking my whiskers?

593
00:56:48,714 --> 00:56:53,009
You risked your life, your mate
and your baby to save your buddy.

594
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,722
Not the best husband or father,
but a darn good friend!

595
00:57:05,314 --> 00:57:06,481
Hey! Ooh!

596
00:58:16,844 --> 00:58:18,428
Everybody, stop!

597
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:21,890
I smell something.

598
00:58:26,228 --> 00:58:29,856
Hmm. It smells like a buzzard's butt fell off

599
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:33,360
and then got sprayed on
by a bunch of skunks.

600
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:34,611
That's Sid.

601
00:58:34,695 --> 00:58:38,031
Mammals, we have ourselves
a crime scene.

602
00:58:38,574 --> 00:58:41,785
A tuft of fur. Half-eaten carcass!

603
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:43,620
Hunk of...

604
00:58:43,746 --> 00:58:46,039
No! Broccoli.

605
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:48,708
Here's what I think happened.

606
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,293
Dinosaur attacks Sid,

607
00:58:50,419 --> 00:58:54,255
Sid fights back with piece of broccoli,
leaving dinosaur

608
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:56,716
a vegetable.

609
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:59,969
Are you nuts? Sid's not violent.
Or coordinated.

610
00:59:00,304 --> 00:59:02,389
Yeah. And where's the dinosaur?

611
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:03,723
All right. All right, good point.

612
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:06,142
Theory two.

613
00:59:06,268 --> 00:59:07,477
Sid's eating broccoli,

614
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:08,895
dinosaur eats Sid,

615
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:11,773
dinosaur steps on broccoli,
leaving broccoli

616
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:13,817
a vegetable.

617
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:16,152
Buck, when exactly
did you lose your mind?

618
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,071
Three months ago.

619
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,824
I woke up one morning
married to a pineapple.

620
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,158
An ugly pineapple.

621
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,495
But I loved her.

622
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:28,832
Buck, I think you missed
a little clue over here.

623
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:33,920
Well, your friend might be alive,
but not for long.

624
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:37,173
Rudy's closing in.

625
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:39,259
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

626
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:42,846
You got it. The Plates of Woe.

627
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:45,014
Or whatever's left of them.

628
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:57,921
Single file, everyone!
Head for Lava Falls.

629
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,688
- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

630
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:18,441
- What's it saying?
- I don't know.

631
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:20,068
I don't speak Wind.

632
01:01:29,078 --> 01:01:32,455
- Ellie!
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

633
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,123
I'm just taking my...

634
01:01:37,044 --> 01:01:38,211
Ellie!

635
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:42,966
- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!

636
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,150
Ellie!

637
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,404
Ellie! Where are you?

638
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:07,115
It's okay! I'm up here!

639
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:10,243
Hang on, Ellie! We'll be right there!

640
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,809
Wait! Sloth down!

641
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:39,647
Wait. Wait. Time out!

642
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:44,444
Hold up. Sheesh!
You guys are getting fast!

643
01:02:48,824 --> 01:02:52,702
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbors.

644
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:01,461
Hi, neighbor.

645
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:06,549
- Rudy.
- Rudy?

646
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,887
- Never heard that kind of dino before.
- That's Sid!

647
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:14,891
- We'll have to move fast.
- Manny! Pineapples!

648
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:17,560
- Pineapples?
- She gets cravings.

649
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:20,897
Pomegranates?
Grapefruits! Nectarines?

650
01:03:21,023 --> 01:03:22,815
She's ordering a fruit cocktail.

651
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,567
Come on, think!

652
01:03:25,527 --> 01:03:26,903
Peaches!

653
01:03:27,738 --> 01:03:29,072
Peaches?

654
01:03:29,698 --> 01:03:32,659
Peaches!
The baby! What, now?

655
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:34,577
This? Not good.

656
01:03:34,662 --> 01:03:36,079
The baby's coming!
Did you guys hear that?

657
01:03:36,163 --> 01:03:37,747
'Cause sometimes
I imagine it in my head, but...

658
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,499
Can you try to hold it in?

659
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,709
Can somebody slap him for me?

660
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,087
Done and done.

661
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:46,089
Just sit tight. We're coming!

662
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:48,758
There's only one thing to do.
Possums, you're with me.

663
01:03:48,842 --> 01:03:51,177
Manny, you take care of Ellie
until we get back.

664
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,929
What? No, you can't leave now!

665
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:55,348
She's off the trail!
What about rule number two?

666
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:58,059
Rule number five says
you can ignore rule number two

667
01:03:58,143 --> 01:04:01,396
if there's a female involved,
or possibly a cute dog.

668
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,439
You know I just make up these rules
as I go along.

669
01:04:03,524 --> 01:04:07,443
- Yeah, but, but she's... You have to...
- Manny, it's all right.

670
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,779
I got your back.

671
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,158
Now you're talking! Come on, lads.

672
01:04:16,745 --> 01:04:20,748
- Take care of our sister, mister.
- No pressure.

673
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:23,126
What does that mean, "I got your back"?

674
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:24,669
I mean, I'd rather they covered the front.

675
01:04:24,753 --> 01:04:26,337
That's where all the good stuff is, isn't it?

676
01:04:26,422 --> 01:04:28,131
We gotta move.

677
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:35,012
Whew. Okay. All right. It's okay.

678
01:04:35,931 --> 01:04:38,099
Daddy's... daddy's coming.

679
01:04:38,684 --> 01:04:41,769
I gotta say, sweetheart,
you really got timing.

680
01:05:02,124 --> 01:05:06,502
Go away! Go away!
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

681
01:05:19,141 --> 01:05:21,768
Don't worry. It's just lava.

682
01:05:22,895 --> 01:05:25,563
Deadly boiling lava!

683
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:44,415
- Boys, are you ready for adventure?
- Yes, sir!

684
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,417
- For danger?
- Yes, sir!

685
01:05:46,502 --> 01:05:47,919
For death?

686
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:49,879
Can you repeat the question?

687
01:05:49,963 --> 01:05:51,255
Jump!

688
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:04,101
That's right! Come on!

689
01:06:06,814 --> 01:06:08,606
Have you ever flown one of these before?

690
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,817
No! First time, actually.

691
01:06:18,992 --> 01:06:21,118
- There she is!
- Ellie!

692
01:06:21,203 --> 01:06:22,453
Manny!

693
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,459
I need to get to her!

694
01:06:28,544 --> 01:06:30,461
Listen. I'll protect Ellie.

695
01:06:30,546 --> 01:06:32,129
- You stop those guys.
- But...

696
01:06:32,214 --> 01:06:36,509
Manny, if they reach her, it'll be too late.
You have to trust me.

697
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:42,139
All right. Let's do it.

698
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:21,220
My paws are burning, baby!
They're burning!

699
01:07:21,305 --> 01:07:23,347
I got to tip-toe.
Tippy-toe. Tippy-toe.

700
01:07:23,432 --> 01:07:26,642
Excuse me, twinkle toes!
Giving birth here.

701
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,061
Right. Sorry. You okay?

702
01:07:30,272 --> 01:07:33,524
Am I okay?
Do you know anything about childbirth?

703
01:07:33,609 --> 01:07:35,943
No, not really, but Manny's coming.

704
01:07:43,535 --> 01:07:46,787
Diego, I'm scared. Can I hold your paw?

705
01:07:46,872 --> 01:07:48,873
Yeah, of course.

706
01:07:48,957 --> 01:07:50,833
Just go with the pain.

707
01:07:52,044 --> 01:07:53,711
- It's just a contraction.
- No!

708
01:08:07,142 --> 01:08:09,060
Look! He's right there!

709
01:08:09,144 --> 01:08:11,187
- Roger!
- No! Sid!

710
01:08:11,271 --> 01:08:12,813
I know! Roger!

711
01:08:12,898 --> 01:08:15,775
How about we get Sid first
and then go back for Roger?

712
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,526
Never mind!

713
01:08:29,748 --> 01:08:31,082
Buck?

714
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:50,518
No, no, Buck!
Buck, wait! Sid's that way!

715
01:08:50,602 --> 01:08:52,436
Tell that to them!

716
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:56,983
Bring it on, you chicken-headed freaks!

717
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,712
Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.

718
01:09:19,131 --> 01:09:20,840
It's going great.

719
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:22,967
Excuse me.

720
01:09:26,054 --> 01:09:27,722
Just keep breathing!

721
01:09:28,098 --> 01:09:29,223
Diego!

722
01:09:29,307 --> 01:09:32,143
Just breathe! That's the important thing.

723
01:09:40,193 --> 01:09:41,861
Grab that ammo!

724
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:47,742
Bogey, three o'clock! Fire!

725
01:09:56,418 --> 01:09:59,503
This is awesome!

726
01:10:02,841 --> 01:10:04,341
Light it up!

727
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:07,678
- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista, birdy!

728
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:15,019
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

729
01:10:20,108 --> 01:10:21,942
Let's get our sloth!

730
01:10:22,027 --> 01:10:25,196
We're hit! We're hit! Mayday! Mayday!

731
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,908
We're losing altitude! Hold these!

732
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:33,621
Tastes like fish.

733
01:10:33,705 --> 01:10:35,873
Okay. That's just weird.

734
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:40,461
- I love you, bro!
- I know!

735
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:43,172
Snap out of it! Come on!

736
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:45,257
Pull!

737
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:57,686
This is the end of Sid the Sloth!

738
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:07,488
- Help!
- No, Sid! It's me!

739
01:11:07,572 --> 01:11:09,365
- And me!
- And me!

740
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:10,741
I don't want
to panic anybody,

741
01:11:10,826 --> 01:11:12,535
but who's flying this thing?

742
01:11:12,619 --> 01:11:13,661
Oops!

743
01:11:17,624 --> 01:11:18,666
Huh?

744
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,676
No, no, wait! Wait! My kids!

745
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:34,557
I never even got to say good-bye.

746
01:11:38,478 --> 01:11:39,562
You can do it! Push! Push!

747
01:11:40,772 --> 01:11:42,356
I can't do it!

748
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,316
Just one more big push!

749
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,236
You have no idea what I'm going through!

750
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:50,906
Okay, forget I said that.
Let's do this together.

751
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:03,627
I liked you guys better
when you were extinct.

752
01:12:08,967 --> 01:12:10,259
Getting dizzy.

753
01:12:12,012 --> 01:12:15,931
Manny! Come on, buddy.
I think we're getting close.

754
01:12:51,134 --> 01:12:52,801
She's perfect.

755
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:56,597
I think we should call her Ellie.

756
01:12:58,475 --> 01:12:59,850
Little Ellie.

757
01:12:59,935 --> 01:13:02,228
I got a better name. Peaches.

758
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:04,521
Peaches?

759
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:09,610
Why not? She's sweet and round
and covered with fuzz.

760
01:13:10,278 --> 01:13:11,612
Peaches.

761
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,781
I love it.

762
01:13:17,285 --> 01:13:18,744
I saw that, tough guy.

763
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:22,081
No, no. That last dino
caught my eye with a claw, and...

764
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:24,583
All right, so I'm not made of stone.

765
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:26,293
Incoming!

766
01:13:28,129 --> 01:13:29,505
It's Sid!

767
01:13:34,427 --> 01:13:36,845
- It's a boy!
- That's its tail.

768
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:38,347
It's a girl!

769
01:13:39,307 --> 01:13:43,852
Hi, sweetheart. Hello, hello!
It's Uncle Sid. Yes, it is.

770
01:13:43,937 --> 01:13:48,190
You're so beautiful. She is!
She looks just like her mother.

771
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:50,401
Thank goodness.

772
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:54,405
No offense, Manny! No offense.
You're beautiful on the inside!

773
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:56,240
It's good to have you back, Sid.

774
01:13:56,324 --> 01:13:59,994
Never thought I would say this,
but I missed you, buddy.

775
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:06,709
Now I wish my kids were here.

776
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:09,253
You could have been friends.

777
01:14:10,422 --> 01:14:11,588
Ellie!

778
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:17,803
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

779
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:19,138
I didn't.

780
01:14:24,686 --> 01:14:27,604
I forgot what it was like
to be part of a family.

781
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:30,274
What about you?
Ever thought about having kids?

782
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:33,944
Hmm.

783
01:14:34,029 --> 01:14:36,947
All right, mammals, let's get you home.

This is it, mammals.
Right where you started.

798
01:16:07,622 --> 01:16:10,833
This was fun!
We could make it a regular thing.

799
01:16:12,043 --> 01:16:13,544
I don't know about that.

800
01:16:13,628 --> 01:16:18,006
Right! Right. Yes, because of
all the mortal peril, of course.

801
01:16:19,217 --> 01:16:21,301
Well, the Buck stops here.

802
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,388
We couldn't have done it without you.

803
01:16:24,472 --> 01:16:27,516
Well, obviously. But good times, just the...

804
01:16:29,102 --> 01:16:31,186
We're not alone, are we?

805
01:16:35,483 --> 01:16:36,859
Hello, Rudy.

806
01:16:45,952 --> 01:16:47,202
Run!

807
01:16:54,252 --> 01:16:56,753
Over here, you colossal fossil!

808
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:59,214
Looking for something?

809
01:17:00,842 --> 01:17:02,593
Why don't you come and get it!

810
01:17:02,677 --> 01:17:04,428
To the cave! Go!

811
01:17:07,807 --> 01:17:10,642
- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go.

812
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:19,485
Wuss.

813
01:17:31,998 --> 01:17:33,832
Pop goes the weasel!

814
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:47,763
Shoo! Shoo! Come on! Move!

815
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:53,435
- Diego! Catch!
- Got it!

816
01:18:03,446 --> 01:18:06,031
Through the hole, over the valley.
One more loop...

817
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:08,617
Come on, lads! Heave!

818
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:25,634
Better luck next time, snowflake.

819
01:18:25,718 --> 01:18:27,886
This isn't going to hold him long! Let's go!

820
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,638
Hold up, guys!

821
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:54,162
Way to go, Momzilla!

822
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:28,989
Come here, kids.
Well, let me tell you something.

823
01:19:29,073 --> 01:19:31,033
You're where you belong now.

824
01:19:31,117 --> 01:19:35,245
And I'm sure you're going to grow up
to be giant, horrifying dinosaurs

825
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:37,706
just like your mother.

826
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,877
And Momma,

827
01:19:43,004 --> 01:19:45,339
take good care of our kids.

828
01:20:13,493 --> 01:20:16,620
- You were a good parent, Sid.
- Thanks.

829
01:20:17,538 --> 01:20:19,456
- Can I baby-sit for you?
- Not a chance.

830
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:22,876
- Come on. I work cheap!
- All right, I'll think about it.

831
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,170
Yes!

832
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:26,755
Never happen.

833
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:33,804
He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?

834
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,848
That's easy. Come with us.

835
01:20:38,226 --> 01:20:40,268
You mean up there?

836
01:20:42,397 --> 01:20:44,314
I never thought of going back.

837
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:47,651
I've been down here so long,
it feels like up to me.

838
01:20:47,735 --> 01:20:49,861
I'm not sure I can fit in up there anymore.

839
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:53,949
So? Look at us.
We look like a normal herd to you?

840
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,285
Ow!

841
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:24,938
So long, big guy.

842
01:21:36,701 --> 01:21:39,202
That's our cue! Come on, Peaches.

843
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:42,164
He's alive!

844
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,041
Buck?

845
01:21:46,294 --> 01:21:48,128
I... I got to...

846
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,505
Yeah.

847
01:21:50,715 --> 01:21:54,176
Besides, this world should
really stay down here.

848
01:21:56,053 --> 01:21:58,096
Take care of them, Tiger.

849
01:21:58,306 --> 01:22:00,348
"Always listen to Buck."

850
01:22:01,225 --> 01:22:03,059
We're almost out!

851
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:11,193
Rudy!

852
01:22:30,671 --> 01:22:31,755
Whew!

853
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:34,800
Is everybody okay?

854
01:22:35,301 --> 01:22:36,885
Where's Buck?

855
01:22:39,472 --> 01:22:42,599
Don't worry. He's where he wants to be.

856
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:46,728
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Are you kidding?

857
01:22:46,813 --> 01:22:50,357
Nothing could kill that weasel.
It's Rudy I'm worried about.

858
01:23:02,036 --> 01:23:05,330
I know this "baby makes three" thing
isn't for you,

859
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:08,625
but whatever you decide to do...

860
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:10,502
I'm not leaving, buddy.

861
01:23:10,586 --> 01:23:13,129
Life of adventure? It's right here.

862
01:23:13,506 --> 01:23:17,050
But I got a whole speech here.
I've been working on it.

863
01:23:17,134 --> 01:23:20,595
How can I show you
that I'm strong and sensitive?

864
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,222
Noble yet caring?

865
01:23:22,306 --> 01:23:23,348
Ow!

866
01:23:24,475 --> 01:23:25,684
Thanks.

867
01:23:40,741 --> 01:23:42,742
They grow so fast, huh?

868
01:23:42,827 --> 01:23:44,494
Yeah. I mean, look at my kids.

869
01:23:44,579 --> 01:23:47,330
Seems like they were born one day
and then gone the next.

870
01:23:47,415 --> 01:23:48,957
They were, Sid.

871
01:23:49,041 --> 01:23:51,418
