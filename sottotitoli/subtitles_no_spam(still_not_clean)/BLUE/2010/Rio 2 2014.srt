1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
                                    
                                   

2
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,801
What is love if it's not with you?

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,222
I know when you're alone
You feel it too

4
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,726
In your arms is where I long to be

5
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,270
'Cause being with you gives me sanity

6
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,272
Welcome to Rio!

7
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,109
Listen to me, darling

8
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,738
I wake up every morning
thinking about the way you feel

9
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,159
I wonder if you know it

10
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,287
And what good is the party
If you're not around?

11
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,455
But listen to me now

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,625
What good is love?

13
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,171
If it's not your love

14
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,840
What good is love?

15
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,300
Am I your baby love?

16
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,969
If it's not your love

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,346
Is it a crazy love?

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,849
This is a crazy party
I'm so glad I'm here with everybody

19
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,851
Baby, move your body
Shake it to the ground

20
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,229
Break it, break it, break it down, Blu

21
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,814
Me?

22
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,817
What's a song if you can't hear it too?

23
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,030
Can't imagine dancing without you

24
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,908
A shooting star
Ain't really nothing to see

25
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,372
If you're not right here
Standing next to me

26
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,209
Listen to me, darling

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,044
I wake up every morning

28
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,588
Thinking about the way you feel

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,092
I wonder if you know it

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,387
What good is the party
if you're not around?

31
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,013
Listen to me now

32
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,224
What good is love?

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,854
If it's not your love

34
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,901
For a bird from Minnesota,
you've got some moves.

35
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,903
That wasn't a move.
That was an accident.

36
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,405
But I accept the compliment.

37
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,949
It's great Rafael could watch the kids.

38
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,077
Yeah, it looks like
you're stuck with me all night.

39
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,912
You're my one and only, Blu.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,624
That's a good thing,
since I'm the only other one.

41
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,252
Hey, you lovebirds! Happy New Year!

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,461
Rafi? Where are the...

43
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,214
The kids are with Luiz. No worries!

44
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,383
Worries. Right here.

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,888
Luiz? Where are the kids?

46
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,931
What? I don't have any kids.

47
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,099
Our kids!

48
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,435
Oh, right. I left them with Tiny.

49
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,603
Tiny?

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,522
What? She's an excellent babysitter.

51
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,608
I'm a terrible babysitter!

52
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,610
This is gonna be awesome!

53
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,778
All right,
I've done all the calculations...

54
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,531
and each explosion

55
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,242
Unless I didn't carry the one.

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,410
Here's my vision.

57
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,205
Red, blue, green, yellow, yellow!
Purple.

58
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,209
Here's my vision.
Boom! Crash! Bang! Kapow!

59
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,794
I don't think your parents
would like this very much.

60
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,047
Here we go.

61
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,745
Where are you going, little bird?

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,384
- Hey, what is this?
- Oh, Dad.

63
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,552
Guys, you know the rules.

64
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,763
No pyrotechnics
without adult supervision.

65
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,097
We asked Tiny.

66
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,641
That's even worse.
Sorry, Tiny.

67
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,976
You don't have to pay me, Senhor Blu.

68
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,603
Kids, next time, ask me.

69
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,313
But you always say "no."

70
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,481
No, I don't.

71
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,233
Dad, you're in denial.

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,068
Honey, do I always say "no"?

73
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,655
- Yes. I mean, no.
- Great.

74
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,573
Now Mom's saying it, too.

75
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,787
Listen, we are the last
blue Spix's Macaws left on the planet.

76
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,623
We have to stay safe.
Birds of blue feathers...

77
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,918
Have to stick together.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,169
I smell chicken.

79
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,008
No, no, no!

80
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,927
No, no, no!

81
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,639
By my calculations,
that's his twenty-seventh "no" today.

82
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,687
Help!

83
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:39,361
- Five, four, three, two, one!
- Everybody, fly!

84
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,988
Happy New Year!

85
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,959
Oh, man.
How come Dad gets to have all the fun?

86
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,878
Look! It worked!

87
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,799
Well, this year is off to a great start.

88
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,447
Amazon Expedition, day seven.

89
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,240
Two thousand miles from Rio...

90
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,088
we've reached the center
of the rainforest.

91
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,246
We are surrounded
by plants and animals...

92
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,665
struggling for survival...

93
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,626
as we glide effortlessly down the river.

94
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,004
Effortless for you.

95
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,173
How pretty.

96
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,842
Spit it out, spit it out!

97
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,722
We are near the nesting grounds
of the Amazonian Wood Quail.

98
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,807
Odontophorus gujanensis.

99
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,185
Six months ago,
we rescued this little bird...

100
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,770
from smugglers.

101
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,772
It was sick, malnourished...

102
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,191
with a broken leg, but now...

103
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,776
my trusty assistant...

104
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,239
I mean, loving wife and colleague,
will release her...

105
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,241
back to her natural habitat.

106
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,409
It's okay.

107
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,952
You can go now.

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,829
Just like this.

109
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,206
Let me talk to her.

110
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,212
Go on.

111
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,633
FREAKS!

112
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,888
Do you think she's gonna be all right?

113
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,765
Give it some time.

114
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,609
Welcome home.

115
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,033
Wait a minute.
What is she saying, Tulio?

116
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,786
It's just hard for her to say goodbye.

117
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,579
No.

118
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,373
I think she's trying to warn us.

119
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,792
No, no, no, Linda.

120
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,044
It might be some sort of mating dance.

121
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,971
Tulio! Look!

122
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,265
Paddle! Now!

123
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,101
Okay, okay, okay. Paddle.

124
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,311
Watch out!

125
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,356
Paddle, paddle! Backward, backward!

126
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,900
To the right! No, left!
Forward, forward! No, no!

127
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,819
Make up your mind, Tulio!

128
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,948
Cheese and sprinkles!

129
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,418
Oh, no!

130
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,880
Paddle, paddle! Faster!

131
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,341
Tulio!

132
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,645
Linda! Linda!

133
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,189
Tulio!

134
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,614
Thank heavens you're okay.

135
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,955
Tulio, is that a...

136
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,397
Linda! This is incredible!

137
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,261
Good morning, Jewel!

138
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,564
Hey! Everyone, look what I found.

139
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,816
Blu?

140
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,901
Kids?

141
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,069
Where did everybody...?

142
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,406
Okay, who's ready for some breakfast?

143
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,907
Unbelievable.

144
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,494
Did you know...

145
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,080
that these whole wheat pancakes have
twice the vitamins and minerals...

146
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,248
of regular pancakes?

147
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,668
And with the blueberries,
it's four times as tasty.

148
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,672
Hey, where are the blueberries?

149
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,132
Oh, Dad!

150
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,758
Looking for this?

151
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,176
Bring it.

152
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,123
It's down to the final minutes.
He's got magic in his feet!

153
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,222
He shoots!

154
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,849
- He scores! Goal!
- Goal!

155
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,393
Yeah, I got it. I'm good.

156
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,478
Heads up, Dad!

157
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,316
No.

158
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,199
Awesome.

159
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,204
Hi, Mom.

160
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,332
Busted.

161
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,750
Time to go.

162
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,210
Hey, honey. Hey. You hungry?

163
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,421
Blu, we talked about this.

164
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,589
Did we? I don't...

165
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,382
Yeah, so, what do you got there?

166
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,550
Breakfast.

167
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,510
That's funny.
But seriously, what is that?

168
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,220
It's a Brazil nut.

169
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,589
I never thought I would find one
this close to the city.

170
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,891
I wanna show the kids how to open one.

171
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,059
You mean like this?

172
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,603
Dad already showed us.

173
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,356
Wait. Wait, go back.

174
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,565
Mom! Dad!

175
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,733
You're on TV!

176
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,860
Doctor Tulio Monteiro,
the Bird Man of Brazil...

177
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,237
announced an important discovery today.

178
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,866
We believe we have encountered
a wild blue Spix's Macaw...

179
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,618
deep in the Amazon jungle.

180
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,997
The blue Spix's Macaw
was thought to be practically extinct...

181
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,124
with the last remaining family
living under protection...

182
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,251
at the Blu Bird Sanctuary
in Rio de Janeiro.

183
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,753
We're famous!

184
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,465
If these birds can be found,
their home will be saved.

185
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,634
There may be a whole flock out there.

186
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,429
And if there is,
we will find them and protect them.

187
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,680
Hi, Blu!

188
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,307
Hi, Linda!

189
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,476
We're not the only ones.

190
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,104
There are more of us out there.

191
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,605
Yeah, that's great. I'm sure they're...

192
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,941
All this time, I thought...

193
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,111
I thought we were alone.

194
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,279
Hey, it hasn't been all bad.

195
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,408
Of course not.

196
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,785
But just imagine
if there was a whole flock of us.

197
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,788
How amazing would that be?

198
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,251
- We gotta do something.
- We do?

199
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,796
Yeah, we have to fly to the Amazon
and help Linda and Tulio find them!

200
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,465
Whoa, we can't just pack up and go.

201
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,341
Why not?

202
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,636
It's about time this family
got a little air under our wings.

203
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,974
Look at us. iPods, TV. Pancakes?

204
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,686
We're not people, we're birds.

205
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,313
We have to get out into the wild
and be birds, Blu.

206
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,149
Let the kids connect to their roots.

207
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,859
Show them what I had.

208
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,027
They need this. We need this.

209
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,988
Come on, Blu, what do you say?

210
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,990
I don't know.

211
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,158
Maybe.

212
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,367
He didn't say "no."

213
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,369
Which means he practically said "yes."

214
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,497
- Hey, wait a sec-...
- It's gonna be so much fun!

215
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,039
Yeah!

216
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,333
We're going to the Amazon!

217
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,128
Wait. What's the Amazon?

218
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,506
The Amazon is one of Earth's
most endangered ecosystems...

219
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,633
due to illegal logging and farming.

220
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,802
Let's hope Doctor Monteiro
and his team...

221
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,556
can find these rare birds
so their home can be saved.

222
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,850
There may be a whole flock out there.

223
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,520
And if there is,
we will find them and protect them.

224
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,856
Tree huggers.

225
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,691
Get my boat ready.

226
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,028
I need to deal with this personally.

227
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:07,804
Next!

228
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,371
That would be me.
Okay, everybody can go home now.

229
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,042
You're looking at the next
King of Carnival!

230
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,380
Hey, big bird! Break a leg!

231
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,135
Walk it off, buddy!

232
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,180
You can't see it coming

233
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:32,894
You won't find it anywhere else

234
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,569
That was amazing!

235
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,907
Eva, darling, you hit every note.
Huh, guys?

236
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,410
Yeah, along with a bunch of notes
I never heard of.

237
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,578
Rafi!

238
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,914
Don't worry. I'll talk to them.

239
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,250
We'll find the perfect spot for you.

240
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,751
Antarctica, maybe.

241
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,086
You better.

242
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,672
Bye, boys.

243
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,716
See you back at home, my tasty mango!

244
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,762
None of these acts are inspiring.
I'm just not inspired.

245
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,974
Carnival is right around the corner,
and our reputations are on the line.

246
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:11,891
Copy that.

247
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,727
We need something that can make us wiggle.
Something that make us jiggle.

248
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,229
We need something that pops.

249
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,649
You know what "pop" is backwards?
Pop.

250
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,984
Next.

251
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,778
Blu?

252
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,862
Sorry, bro!

253
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:28,324
It's okay, Luiz. Good to see you, too.

254
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,702
Listen, Blu,
we are looking for a singer...

255
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,328
a dancer, the whole package.

256
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,664
Yeah, and you're more of
a mumbler-shuffler.

257
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,124
You catch my drift?

258
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,627
No, I'm not here to audition.
I've got news.

259
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,714
I am going to the Amazon.

260
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,299
Yay.

261
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,219
The Amazon? Wow, that's wild.

262
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,014
Yeah, Jewel thinks it'll be good for us.

263
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,181
How wild?

264
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,558
Real wild.

265
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,519
They got mosquitoes
that suck your blood like Slurpees.

266
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,063
Snakes that can swallow you whole.

267
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,693
Flesh-eating piranhas that eat flesh.

268
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,413
Great, that sounds really nice.
I'm not going.

269
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,572
Guys, guys, guys.

270
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,699
Blu, you have nothing to worry about.

271
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,993
All those stories
are highly exaggerated.

272
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,786
- You think so?
- Of course!

273
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,456
If this is important to Jewel,
just do it.

274
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,834
Happy wife, happy life. Remember that.

275
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,961
Okay, yeah, you're right.

276
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,756
A little family vacation
might actually be fun.

277
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,382
Plus, it's not like it's forever.

278
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,634
That's the spirit.

279
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,552
Yeah. Okay.

280
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,012
Thanks, guys.

281
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,181
See you in a couple of weeks!

282
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,766
Safe travels, Blu!

283
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,351
Bring me back a souvenir!

284
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:41,230
Dawg, he ain't coming back. He is dead.

285
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,067
Amazon!

286
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,152
Let's go! Come on, Dad! Come on!

287
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,615
Okay. Bug spray, check.
Water purifier, check. Band-Aids.

288
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,825
- I feel like I'm forgetting something.
- Cool!

289
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,745
The all-in-one adventurer's knife!

290
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,664
I'll be in charge of this.

291
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,873
That's not for you.

292
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,041
Hey, Dad, look at this.

293
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,919
Did you know the Amazon has snakes
that can swallow you whole?

294
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,255
Actually, Bia,
all those stories are highly exaggerated.

295
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,715
No, really. Look.

296
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,595
That's sick!

297
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,056
All right, are we ready to go?

298
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,432
- A fanny pack?
- Yeah.

299
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,768
Linda gave it to me.
I need it for the GPS.

300
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,103
Where's the GPS?

301
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,063
- Hey!
- Carla, we're leaving.

302
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,191
I'm not going. It's gonna be lame.

303
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,110
Okay, here it is.

304
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,446
The voice recognition makes it
totally foolproof. Here, watch this.

305
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,490
Find Linda and Tulio.

306
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,243
Searching for "Dinner in Tokyo."

307
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,037
Okay. Actually,
that does sound like a nice suggestion.

308
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,123
- You trust this woman?
- Yes, I do.

309
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,749
Hey, wait up, family!

310
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,876
I'm coming, too!

311
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,878
Don't worry, buddy. We got your back.

312
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,046
Eva let you come?

313
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,757
Sure. I promised her a spot
in the Carnival show.

314
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,801
- You did what?
- You guys are late.

315
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,762
- Clock-late.
- But musician-early.

316
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,639
Wait, you guys are coming?

317
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,890
We wouldn't miss it for the world.

318
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,685
We gonna scout the wildest,
coolest talent in the jungle!

319
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,438
It's our inspiration
for this year's Carnival show.

320
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,774
"Amazon Untamed."

321
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,025
Cool!

322
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,654
I mean, yeah. Okay. I guess I'll go.

323
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,448
Amazon jungle or bust, baby!

324
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,783
Who is ready for a tropical adventure?

325
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,951
I know I am!

326
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,661
- All right!
- Let's go, birds!

327
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,039
Wait, we didn't do a head count.
Hey, guys, wait up!

328
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,125
Recalculating.

329
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,880
Hey, birds! Come back!

330
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,300
They left without me. Again!

331
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,886
That's messed up.

332
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,421
Heavy traffic ahead.

333
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,340
Great. Thanks a lot, GPS lady.

334
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,534
Faster, faster, faster!

335
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,204
Slower! Slower! Slower!

336
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,997
Help!

337
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:13,234
From Rio to Manaus
We are here in paradise

338
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,903
Here we are, kids.
The gateway to the Amazon.

339
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,617
"To be...

340
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,413
"or not to be...

341
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,915
"that is the question.

342
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,084
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

343
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,755
"to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

344
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,926
"or to take arms
against a sea of troubles...

345
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,972
"and, by opposing, end them."

346
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,392
That's beautiful, Nigel.

347
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,935
What does it mean?

348
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,604
Death, Gabi.

349
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,939
It's about death.

350
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,569
Nigel, I love it
when you get all dark and brooding.

351
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,281
Hey, bird. It's show time!

352
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,533
My audience awaits.

353
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,748
From the streets of Rio,
to the Amazon jungle...

354
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,750
the bird of mystery!

355
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,628
Miracle cures! Poison frogs!

356
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,463
- Fire ants!
- Don't be shy!

357
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,632
Learn your destiny!

358
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,475
Hey!
Get away from those! Back to work.

359
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,481
Mommy, Mommy, I want one!
I want a fortune!

360
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,441
Welcome, madame.

361
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,654
This amazing cockatoo
will reveal your future.

362
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,990
All right, bird. Pick a fortune.

363
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,575
Come on, bird.

364
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,494
You're doing great, Nigel.

365
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,288
Pick it already.

366
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:51,916
Come on, gang. Almost there.

367
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,835
No more flying today.
We've got a boat to catch.

368
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,131
According to my little friend here,
this boat will get us there by morning.

369
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,299
Yeah!

370
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,975
He'll live, but he'll never fly again.

371
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,855
- Come on, bird.
- I want my fortune!

372
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,524
You're doing great, Nigel.

373
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,317
What's taking so long?

374
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,697
What's the matter with you?

375
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,952
That blue bird caused my misery.

376
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,002
Nice birdie?

377
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,368
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

378
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,344
Wow. Nigel is muy macho.

379
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,558
Thank you.

380
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,563
I'm free!

381
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,733
Poison frog!

382
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,082
The croaking cockatoo
doth bellow for revenge.

383
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,751
That's Shakespeare, by the way.

384
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,503
Without your performance, it's nothing.

385
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,755
Fair point.

386
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,365
This air! It's so fresh and full.

387
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,744
Goodbye, stinky city air!

388
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,954
Yeah, bye.

389
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,794
Hey. Thank you for doing this.

390
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,587
I really appreciate it.

391
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,381
I would do anything for you.
You know that, right?

392
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,634
Of course I do.

393
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,736
We aren't here to snack.
We are here to avenge.

394
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,572
Once these pesky passengers
fall asleep...

395
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,326
we'll show our blue friends some love.
Some...

396
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,079
poisonous love.

397
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,331
That's my specialty.

398
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,834
We attack at the midnight hour...

399
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,169
because it's more evil.

400
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,171
Stay alert.

401
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,763
Midnight! Time to attack.

402
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,016
Nigel! Nigel?

403
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,438
Look at us. Misfits.

404
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,443
A toxic frog, and a flightless freak.

405
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,990
So different, and yet, the same.

406
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,159
My darling, while you sleep
All is well

407
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:17,496
We are friends, and that's swell But the
truth is that I have a secret to tell

408
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,458
I love you

409
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,671
People say it's wrong
It's absurd

410
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,674
That a frog and a bird are in love
But I know in my heart

411
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:33,220
This was so meant to be

412
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,974
If only we could hug and could kiss
It'd be heavenly bliss

413
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,383
But your lungs would explode
And you'd lookjust like this

414
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,188
And you'd gag
With your face turning blue

415
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,689
Eww

416
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,901
But, darling, I'll protect you
I will, don't worry, just chill

417
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,862
'Cause there isn't a bird
That I wouldn't kill

418
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,992
For you Can't you see

419
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,079
We were destined to be?

420
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:03,751
- For we have love
- Love

421
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,213
- Poisonous love
- Love

422
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,050
And although, yes

423
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:16,555
I know that you can't hold me

424
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,682
Feel me close now.

425
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,771
Your loving wings enfold me

426
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,024
Fate told me

427
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,776
Love

428
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,278
- Poisonous love
- Love

429
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,782
Standing here

430
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,410
You're so near And yet

431
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,996
So far

432
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,748
Like a star.

433
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,917
Here we are

434
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,794
Where?

435
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,505
What to do?

436
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,258
To do

437
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,468
Oh, pooh.

438
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,306
You're my Romeo I'm Juliet

439
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,642
We're so perfect, and yet

440
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,978
If we touch, not by much

441
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,146
Still on all you can bet

442
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,149
It's goodbye

443
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,987
And I'll cry

444
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,867
As you die

445
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,999
From our poisonous love

446
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,514
What a nightmare.

447
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,474
Charlie!

448
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,185
You were supposed to wake me!

449
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,521
It's time.

450
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,407
I love being on Team Nigel!

451
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:08,477
I can't think of anything more romantic than
poisoning passengers on a moonlight cruise.

452
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,645
Stop.

453
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,065
That one is mine.

454
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,442
Twinkle, twinkle little Blu.

455
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,112
How I wondered, where were you?

456
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,156
Up above the world so high...

457
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,283
are you ready...

458
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,577
to die?

459
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,413
You need a breath mint.

460
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,332
Even in sleep, you mock me.

461
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,434
Wait for me!

462
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,103
Don't leave me!

463
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,647
Tiago! Stop fooling around.

464
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,274
I didn't do anything.

465
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,192
Tiago Gunderson, listen to your mother.

466
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,319
Man.

467
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,156
We're almost there, right?

468
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,866
- Hey, guys. Wait up.
- Come on, Blu.

469
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,534
Remember, birds of a...

470
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,828
Nevermind.

471
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,875
They're getting away!

472
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,336
Wake up, you insect-eating idiot.
Follow them.

473
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,175
Better. Now go ten times faster.

474
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,012
River hogs!

475
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,761
You!

476
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,223
I always suspected
you were dumber than a monkey.

477
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,933
And now, I know.

478
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,269
Boss! What are you doing in the jungle?

479
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,230
Perhaps the better question is...

480
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,981
what are they doing?

481
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,484
Nature freaks.

482
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,489
Two million square miles of jungle...

483
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,909
and they're playing in my backyard?

484
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,954
I don't think so.

485
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,958
As you know, my friends,
this logging operation is a little...

486
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,918
illegal.

487
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,755
If those two nuts find those birds,
we're out of business.

488
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,923
And that's why you...

489
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,135
must put an end to their
little bird-watching expedition.

490
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,681
Find them and get rid of them.

491
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,850
The rest of you, go cut some trees.

492
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,981
Who cares about a bunch of birds?

493
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:03,026
The macaws should
be nesting near the Brazil nut trees.

494
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,279
So, I think
that we should continue with go...

495
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,157
Tulio! Are you listening to me?

496
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,535
You have reached your destination.

497
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,871
You see? It works like a charm.
Here we are.

498
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,624
Where?

499
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,626
These things have a margin of error.

500
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,129
I told you not to trust that woman.

501
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,800
That's a Heliconious larva.
It's about to enter the pupa stage.

502
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,635
You said "poop!"

503
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,721
Hey, kids. Stay close.

504
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,139
I'll get them.

505
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,642
Okay, you guys stay put.
I'll look around.

506
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,313
No worries. We'll be here.
We're not going anywhere.

507
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,481
My feathers is popping up
on the back of my neck.

508
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,983
I don't like this.

509
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,818
Let's back it up.

510
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,990
Bia? Tiago?

511
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,911
Come on, lady.

512
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,749
- Don't let me down.
- Calculating route to "Funky Town."

513
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,916
Oh, great.

514
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,675
Okay, guys!

515
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,220
Guys?

516
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,017
Good one, guys. Very funny.

517
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,061
Good, good. Very witty.

518
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,897
Jewel, where are you?

519
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,941
Kids? Jewel?

520
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,695
It's a Macaw!

521
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,030
Linda!

522
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,365
Let me go!

523
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,369
Let me go, you heathens!

524
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,870
Blu?

525
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,710
I swear that sounded like Blu.

526
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,379
That's impossible, Linda.

527
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,215
He's back home in Rio, safe and sound.

528
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,092
I am an American citizen, you savage!

529
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,760
I demand to see my ambassador!

530
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,720
I know my rights! I know my rights!

531
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,225
Back. Back, you barbarian!

532
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,893
Yeah, that's right.

533
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,104
It's a spoon and a fork.

534
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,731
Be afraid! Be very afraid.

535
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,652
Whoa! Whoa, buddy. Put the spork down.

536
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,945
- Let me go!
- Bring it!

537
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,072
Come on! You lucky I ain't big.

538
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,520
I can't believe we found them!

539
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,231
Technically, they found us.

540
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,859
Okay, we're gonna need some nametags.

541
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,486
Hello. Okay.

542
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,989
No, those are breath mints.
Not that you need one.

543
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,199
But they're good. You eat them.

544
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,869
No, no, no! Not the whole box.

545
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,746
Get that out of your mouth!

546
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,043
What is this doing here?
What's going on?

547
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,129
We found them flying too close
to the humans.

548
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,047
- What? And who are you?
- Uh...

549
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,966
"Uh" is not an appropriate answer.

550
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,302
I asked you a question.
Where did you come from?

551
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,470
Hey! Back off!

552
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,597
Hey, excuse me, young lady.

553
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,059
I can't believe it.

554
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,604
How is this...?

555
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,564
When the loggers came...

556
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:32,027
there was fire, and so much smoke.

557
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,322
I had you under my wing,
and then you were...

558
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,281
Gone.

559
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,241
I've looked everywhere for you.

560
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,452
I'm here.

561
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,037
Daddy!

562
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,539
"Daddy"?

563
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,085
I missed you.

564
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,589
It's okay. It's okay, now.

565
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,133
Daddy has you.

566
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,346
Look at you.

567
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,016
It's my little girl, all grown up.

568
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,560
You're so beautiful.

569
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,897
Just like your mother.

570
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,068
I'm so sorry I lost you.

571
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,197
I can't imagine you alone,
all this time.

572
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,992
No, it's okay, Dad. I wasn't alone.

573
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,286
Blu found me.

574
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,959
Sure is nice to meet you, sir.

575
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,254
Tuck that wing away, Stu.

576
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,006
- Now, come here.
- Right, sure. Okay.

577
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,925
- Closer.
- Really?

578
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,218
Closer.

579
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,472
You brought my Jewel back to me.
I thank you.

580
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,809
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- Okay.

581
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,563
- Now, come here, you.
- Okay. There we are.

582
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,814
My pleasure.

583
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,649
Nico. You crying?

584
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,277
It's a heavy moment,
and I'm very vulnerable right now.

585
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,279
Come here. Let me get you a hug.

586
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,952
Mom, are you okay?

587
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,203
"Mom"?

588
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,331
I'm a grandpa? I'm a grandpa.

589
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,000
Look at me, I'm a grandpa!

590
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,253
Daddy, this is Carla, Bia and Tiago.

591
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,629
Nice to meet you, sir.

592
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,798
There is no "sir" around here,
young lady.

593
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,134
- You will call me "Pop-Pop!"
- Pop-Pop.

594
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,636
I like that. It's got a nice ring to it.

595
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,015
I am a Pop-Pop!
Yeah, I'm the Pop-Pop-Pop.

596
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:28,268
Kids, go easy on old Pop-Pop.

597
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,936
You can call me "sir."

598
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,315
My daughter has returned!

599
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,572
For years, we have been on the run...

600
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,782
as the humans push us
deeper into the jungle.

601
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,119
But as you can see,
we have found sanctuary.

602
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,039
A place we can finally put down roots.

603
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:53,293
Everyone! Come on!
Everyone, out of your nests!

604
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,464
My daughter is home!

605
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,926
Come on, birds. My Jewel is back!

606
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,430
Jewel?

607
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,600
Make way. Make way! Jewel!

608
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,101
Aunt Mimi? Aunt Mimi!

609
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,481
I missed you so much!

610
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,567
My little wildflower has returned!

611
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,863
I knew you were coming back.
I saw it in the droppings.

612
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,616
And look at the little ones!

613
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,579
Aren't you the fluffiest,
most delicious little macaws?

614
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,832
- You're big for your age.
- Mimi...

615
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
this is Sue.

616
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,087
- Actually, I'm Blu.
- Aren't we all?

617
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,838
No, really, that's my name.

618
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,757
That's why they call us "Blue Macaws."

619
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,092
Just go with it.

620
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,351
So, that's what a Blue Macaw
is supposed to look like?

621
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,858
Look at her shining

622
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,444
Her feathers, they glow

623
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,364
Now the jungle is smiling

624
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,282
'Cause our baby's home

625
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,244
Can you feel what I feel?

626
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,413
The day has come at last

627
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,207
Our precious Jewel has returned

628
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,878
I'll be the first to sing
Welcome back

629
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,715
Roberto. I...

630
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,384
Welcome back

631
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:30,140
I said welcome, welcome, welcome

632
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,897
back

633
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,108
Wow, you look great!

634
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,068
So do you.

635
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,989
Hi, hey. Hi, there.
I am Jewel's significant other.

636
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,243
So, you're the lucky bird
who swept Ju-Ju off her feet.

637
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,078
- "Ju-Ju"?
- Yeah.

638
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,789
When we were kids, we always had
the cutest nicknames for each other.

639
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,250
We did. I called him "Beto."

640
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,294
That's adorable.
I love doing the nicknames.

641
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,296
You never mentioned any "Roberto."

642
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,672
There's nothing to mention.

643
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,923
Hey.

644
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,258
There's my wingman!

645
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,385
We can rest easy
with Roberto on the lookout.

646
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,430
Eduardo taught me everything I know.
He's the bird.

647
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,223
No. You're the bird.

648
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,059
- No, you're the bird.
- You're the bird!

649
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,061
We get it. You're both "the bird."

650
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,730
Now, can we stop yakking
and start partying?

651
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,942
Wow! I remember this song.

652
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,779
How could you forget?
It's in our blood, baby.

653
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,448
It's who we are.

654
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,283
You don't mind
if I borrow her for a minute, do you?

655
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,993
- Actually...
- Come on, Ju-Ju!

656
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,287
Let's go!

657
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,792
Let's come together
Singing love and harmonia

658
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,254
We are so different

659
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,841
But the same inside our hearts

660
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:49,928
Blue-tiful colors

661
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,514
As far as the eye can see

662
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,684
Open your wings

663
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:01,022
Fly when you hear the call

664
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:06,277
Let's celebrate
Calling all beautiful creatures

665
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:10,949
Come spread your wings
Dance and sing songs about freedom

666
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,659
Like la-la-la, ooh-ooh

667
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,661
- One for the jungle família
- Come on, Blu!

668
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,622
Like ba-ba-ba, boom-boom

669
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,127
- Calling all beautiful creatures
- Hey, Jewel? Jewel!

670
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:26,172
Come this way, celebrate

671
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,509
Laugh and dance all the way

672
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,015
Yo, this is untapped territory.
I'm loving this sound.

673
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,990
Pop-Pop! I am a Pop-Pop!

674
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,161
I am your Pop-Pop!
Yeah, I am the Pop-Pop

675
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,371
Hey, the Pop-Pop!

676
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:04,544
Let's celebrate
Calling all beautiful creatures

677
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,215
Come spread your wings
Dance and sing songs about freedom

678
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,009
Like la-la-la, ooh-ooh

679
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,012
One for the jungle família

680
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,638
Like ba-ba-ba, boom-boom

681
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,559
Calling all beautiful creatures

682
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,700
You're the only one who knows
what it feels like to be all alone.

683
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,577
Misunderstood.

684
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,163
You're the evil to my lethal.

685
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,582
I can see why they call you "Gabi."

686
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,752
Where are you, you filthy fowl?

687
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,838
Halt!

688
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,888
I've been going about this all wrong.

689
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,599
I need to search from higher ground.

690
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,522
You stayed airborne
for almost a full second that time.

691
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,445
What are you looking at?
Get me up there.

692
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,948
Higher.

693
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,617
Higher! Even higher.

694
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,036
Little bit higher.

695
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,956
Lower. Lower, now.

696
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,876
Yes. Perfect.

697
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,090
It's an infestation.

698
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,929
Keep celebrating.
I'll be pooping on your party promptly.

699
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,394
Hi, Nico! Hi, Pedro!

700
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,313
We came to the right place.

701
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,649
This is popping.
It's popping in the Amazon.

702
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,526
We could bring these macaws
back to Rio...

703
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,529
and have the best Carnival show ever.

704
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,490
I am inspired!

705
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,828
Sorry to break it to you, city boys...

706
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,663
but you'll have to find
some other talent.

707
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,665
Nobody leaves the tribe.

708
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,169
And no human things in the jungle.
Understood?

709
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,298
What? What's his problem?

710
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,008
I feel naked.

711
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,469
We could have been legends.

712
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,055
We already are super-mega-dope, but...

713
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,307
You know what I'm saying?

714
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,892
We had it all.
The undiscovered talent...

715
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,978
the big idea, the inspiration.

716
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,689
But if we can't bring
these guys to Rio...

717
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,857
we got nothing.

718
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:31,983
Nothing?

719
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,903
Hold your mangoes. We still have Eva.

720
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,740
What?

721
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,039
Wow! You still got the moves, Ju-Ju.

722
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,707
- I'm so exhausted.
- Yeah.

723
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,169
We should get some rest.
Find a local inn, or B and B nearby.

724
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,545
What is this crazy talk?

725
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,714
No, you guys are staying in my nest.

726
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,215
I'm on patrol tonight.

727
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,176
Mi casa es su casa.

728
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,719
That's really nice, Beto.

729
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,220
Thank you, but we're fine.

730
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,891
Besides, our whole family
couldn't possibly fit in your bachelor pad.

731
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,559
Whoa.

732
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,479
Real estate must be pretty cheap
around here.

733
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,939
Wow. This is incredible.

734
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,277
This old nest? It's just something
I put together last minute.

735
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,738
With my own two wings, of course.

736
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,448
And my strength.

737
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,075
And my brawn.

738
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,496
Dad, it's huge! It has six bedrooms!

739
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,415
- I get the big one!
- No! I'm the oldest.

740
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,085
Only by 3 minutes, 2.5 seconds.

741
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,360
I had hoped to one day be blessed...

742
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,631
with a flock of little Robertos
to call my own.

743
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,674
- I bet you did.
- No way!

744
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,510
A bird bath!

745
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,470
Tiago, caref-...

746
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,433
Jacuzzi.

747
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:51,854
Blu, let me tell you something.

748
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:56,609
If anything, and I mean anything,
ever happens to you...

749
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,694
I will take care of your family.

750
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,114
All right, buddy. Sleep well.

751
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,950
- Good night, Ju-Ju.
- Good night.

752
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,757
Okay. All clear.

753
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,676
Moon beams and starlight

754
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,389
Magical twilight

755
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:30,226
The warmest rain

756
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,814
Hear it whispering your names?

757
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,276
Rainbows at midnight

758
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,320
Sparkling night skies

759
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:45,408
Don't go away

760
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,495
Stay another day

761
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,249
Can you sing it again, please?

762
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,502
Time for bed, now.

763
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,969
What an amazing day.

764
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,555
All this time...

765
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:12,435
I never let myself hope
that they were alive.

766
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,104
But they are.

767
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,233
We found our family, Blu.

768
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,654
This changes everything.

769
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,198
Yeah.

770
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,701
Wait. What? What's changing?

771
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,330
Jewel?

772
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,284
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Go on.

773
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,480
Honey, stop. That tickles.

774
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,154
That was fun!

775
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,533
Tiago!

776
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,077
Come on, Tiago. Let's go.

777
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,380
Morning.

778
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,924
Or should I say "afternoon"?

779
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,344
Morning, sir.

780
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,888
Our days here in the jungle,
they start early.

781
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,348
Morning, Daddy.

782
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,143
That's my girl. See?
Already up and at 'em.

783
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,352
Morning, sweetie.

784
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,730
Why did you let me sleep in?

785
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,274
What are you talking about?
You sleep in every day.

786
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,859
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, Dad.

787
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,028
Aunt Mimi says
clay is good for your digestion.

788
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,036
- Try some.
- No, sweetie. I just brushed my...

789
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,449
It's good, right?
I'm gonna go get some more.

790
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,200
Smart girl.

791
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,540
So, I thought I'd take Louie, here,
for a little tour of the area.

792
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,875
Show him around.

793
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,460
- That's a great idea.
- What?

794
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,005
You go have fun with Daddy,
and I'll explore around here with the kids.

795
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,633
- Yeah, okay. Sure.
- You'll love it.

796
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,093
Yeah, great. I just gotta...

797
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,059
Okay, ready.

798
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,813
Okay.

799
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,274
Lou, come closer.

800
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,656
- Not so close.
- Okay.

801
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,324
Listen...

802
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,661
I can barely look at it.
You gotta lose that human pocket, okay?

803
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,371
This is a fanny pack.

804
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,998
"Fanny pack." Adorable.

805
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,375
It's human.

806
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:26,045
And now that you're joining the tribe,
you won't be needing it anymore.

807
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,547
I'll meet you by the clay banks.

808
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,174
"Joining the tribe"?

809
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,782
He doesn't actually think
we're moving to the jungle, does he?

810
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,180
No. He's just excited we're all here.

811
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,015
Let's not ruin the moment, okay?

812
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:42,103
Besides, it won't kill you
to leave behind the fanny pack.

813
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,023
All right, you win.
I will leave the fanny pack behind.

814
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,235
Happy wife, happy li...

815
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,403
Bye, honey.

816
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,821
Have fun.

817
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,408
Yeah. Sure. Bye.

818
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,171
You guys. Wakey-wakey!

819
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,966
- Wake up!
- Eva! You got it!

820
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,677
What happened to "Amazon Untamed"?

821
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,762
Here's the plan. Auditions today...

822
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,014
and we preview the show tomorrow.

823
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,600
"We"? What you talking about, "we"?
You speak French?

824
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,979
Come on, chop-chop. Let's get started!

825
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,232
Kid's been working.

826
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,403
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go

827
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,238
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go!

828
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,952
'Cause shawty got low, low, low, low, low

829
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,706
Any time you're ready.

830
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,666
Every time I come a fella gotta get it

831
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,460
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then they gotta blow

832
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,628
And then I gotta show that any little thing
A fella think that he be doing

833
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,338
'Cause it doesn't matter, I'm done

834
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,990
Next!

835
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,308
We are the amazing Capoeira Turtles.

836
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,223
- Bravo! Encore! Encore!
- Encore!

837
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,946
Sorry, guys. Did I miss anything?

838
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,698
Mosquito.

839
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,551
Hi, my name is Claira the capybara...

840
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,387
and I will be singing my favorite song.

841
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,391
Memory

842
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,354
All alone in the moonlight

843
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,737
Touch me

844
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,699
It's so easy to leave me

845
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,910
If they keep eating each other,
we got no show.

846
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,120
This ain't an
all-you-can-eat competition!

847
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:16,090
Hey. You are fast.
You are really, really fast.

848
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,178
I think I pulled a wing or something.
You are really fast for an old bird.

849
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:23,180
For such a wise bird,
is what I meant to say. Wise bird.

850
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,932
Which sometimes comes with age...

851
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,809
but also can happen when you're young,
like in your case.

852
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,228
You could be wise and young,
which is kind of a rare combination...

853
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,596
but thrilling when it happens.

854
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,106
- Be quiet.
- Thank you, sir.

855
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,875
It's time to shake that city off of you.

856
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,569
You need to learn
the basics of jungle survival.

857
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,237
I thought we were going sightseeing.

858
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,156
It's training day.

859
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,451
Come on! The mud is your friend.

860
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,496
This is your camouflage!
Feel it. Taste it!

861
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,416
If you don't feel crusty,
you're not doing it right!

862
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,961
You don't wanna be seen by humans!

863
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,839
Come on!
Are you a macaw or a turkey?

864
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,306
Faster. Faster.

865
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,434
Come on!
You don't wanna be eaten!

866
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,981
You're alone in the jungle.
You get caught in a trap.

867
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,774
What do you do?

868
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,151
If I had my fanny pack...

869
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,819
No! You use your beak.

870
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,667
- My beak.
- It's your most important tool.

871
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,823
Okay, okay. No, I use my beak.

872
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,492
- Almost.
- Time's up!

873
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,286
You're jaguar meat.

874
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,204
Roberto got it on the first try.

875
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,123
Of course he did.

876
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,627
Up, up! And hover!

877
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,462
- Now, backwards!
- What, backwards?

878
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,505
No, only hummingbirds can fly backwards.

879
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,215
Backwards.

880
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,343
Over! Under! Over!

881
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,637
Under! Over!

882
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,472
- Good job.
- Thanks.

883
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,848
Not you.

884
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,975
Hi.

885
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,145
Brazil nut trees.

886
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:58,025
These trees are the key
to our way of life.

887
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,070
The trees feed us.

888
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,489
They sustain us.

889
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,912
- Wake up!
- I'm up.

890
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,997
Nutty Brazil...
Brazil nut trees, something.

891
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,332
Yeah, got it.

892
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,627
This is important.
We have to protect these trees.

893
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,671
Our future depends on it.

894
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:19,838
Yo, Eddie.

895
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,340
Who is your sidekick?

896
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,217
You got a nurse now?

897
00:54:23,987 --> 00:54:24,987
Hi, I'm...

898
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,680
Aren't you boys getting
a little bit too close to our side?

899
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,056
We have a deal, Felipe.

900
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,724
Hey, relax.

901
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:33,060
You know we got nothing
but mad love for you.

902
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,979
Come on, boys, let's fly.

903
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:39,066
Paint the sky. Before they start to cry.

904
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,727
- They seem nice.
- They have their side of the grove...

905
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,987
and we have ours.

906
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,239
Food is scarce these days.

907
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,168
Never seen them
this close to the village before.

908
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,086
What?

909
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,922
- Don't let them see you!
- Right, right. Sorry.

910
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,383
Maybe we should go find Linda.

911
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,678
- What's a Linda?
- Linda is the person that raised me.

912
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,555
What? You're a pet?

913
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,225
No, it wasn't anything like that.
I was a companion.

914
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,186
You liked it?
That explains everything.

915
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,522
- Linda is family.
- Family?

916
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,733
Humans aren't family.

917
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,568
No, you don't understand.
They're coming here to help.

918
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,527
Listen to me.

919
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,405
We do not bring humans into the tribe.

920
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,615
That is the only reason
we're still alive.

921
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,910
You cannot be confused about this.
Understood?

922
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,787
Yeah. Got it.

923
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,957
Sightseeing is over.

924
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,423
Do you see the nest?

925
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,720
Tulio, are you okay?

926
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,431
I'm fine! I'm okay!

927
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,686
Not okay.

928
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,443
Tulio, they're cutting down the forest!

929
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,278
Linda, where are you going?

930
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,531
To talk to them.
You talk to birds, I talk to humans.

931
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,283
No! Wait, don't!

932
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,953
Hey! Hey, mister!

933
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,872
Hello!

934
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,208
You take it easy with that chainsaw.

935
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:24,797
There are rare birds living around here.
You can't cut down these trees!

936
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,758
Sweetheart! There you are.

937
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,384
I was looking for you.

938
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,471
Hi, there. Beautiful out here, isn't it?

939
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,598
You two lost?

940
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,935
Lost? No!

941
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:39,978
Lost?

942
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,480
No.

943
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,316
We're here on our honeymoon.

944
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,985
We're actually just heading back
to join the tour.

945
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,488
It's karaoke night.

946
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,325
Come along, honey.
Moon River isn't going to sing itself.

947
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,079
Linda, logs aren't the only things
these guys cut.

948
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,499
Run, Linda. I'll hold them off.

949
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,669
- Go, go, go! Run!
- Okay, okay, okay!

950
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,592
Excuse me, excuse me!

951
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:16,974
Come on, I'll race you.

952
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,727
- This is great!
- All right, Tiago!

953
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,895
Oh, yeah!

954
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,689
Tiago!

955
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:25,941
Hey!

956
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,239
That is so good.

957
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,866
Hey, you're back.

958
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,702
How did it go?

959
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,540
We had a great time.
It was educational.

960
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,668
Dad! Uncle Beto showed me
some cool flying tricks.

961
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,836
"Uncle"?

962
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,130
Look, I can fly backwards.

963
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,215
Yeah, you're a natural, T-Bird.

964
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:56,054
It's never too soon
to learn the ways of the jungle, Tiago.

965
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,141
Although, some may never learn.

966
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,270
I'm gonna go clean up.

967
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,192
Roberto, we saw humans near the grove.

968
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,611
I need you to stay alert.

969
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,071
"Ways of the jungle."

970
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,741
I would like to learn a way
out of this jungle.

971
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,791
There he is. Now is our chance.

972
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,168
I'm so excited!

973
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,003
Prepare the tongue-a-pult.

974
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,385
Charlie, make me fly again.

975
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,930
Go get them, tiger!

976
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,187
Bow before the conquering cockatoo.

977
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,439
What is your problem, dude?

978
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,900
Bird, that was sick!

979
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,236
Now, that's the energy
you bring into an audition.

980
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,612
Audition?

981
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,822
Yeah, that's actually why I'm here.

982
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,449
I've got a great little...

983
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,470
Go on.

984
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,662
We're looking for a new star.

985
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,247
Star?

986
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,541
You look familiar.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

987
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,087
No, I don't think so. No. I'm...

988
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,925
Bob. Yes. Bob, the bird.

989
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,387
Okay, Bob, whatever.
Show us what you got.

990
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:25,018
Well, at first I was afraid

991
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,937
I was petrified

992
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,524
I kept thinking that I could never live

993
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,610
I could barely fly

994
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,530
And I spent, oh, so many nights

995
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,241
thinking how he did me wrong

996
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,493
And I grew strong

997
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,664
And I learned how to get along

998
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,834
Go on, now, go Walk out the door

999
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,628
Just turn around now

1000
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,047
It is I who have the floor

1001
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,843
Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

1002
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,095
- Did you think I'd crumble?
- Oh, no!

1003
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,139
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

1004
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,307
Oh, no, not Nige

1005
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,643
I will survive

1006
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,854
As long as I know how to hate

1007
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,981
I know I'll stay alive

1008
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,109
I've got all my life to live

1009
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,902
And I've got all my love to give

1010
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,988
- And I will survive
- You will survive

1011
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,282
- I will survive
- We will survive

1012
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,743
I'm a survivor
I've got the eye of a tiger

1013
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,430
Been training again
And eating my fiber

1014
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,872
You been staying alive
Well, I've been staying alive-er

1015
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,416
Watch where you sit
when I spit my saliva, like boom

1016
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,959
You've never seen a cockatoo

1017
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,045
Rocking and shocking and dropping
And popping and locking, too?

1018
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,839
Watch what I can do
Without no Auto-Tune

1019
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,007
Say what?

1020
01:00:39,988 --> 01:00:40,988
Oh, no, he didn't.

1021
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,804
If you try to keep me down

1022
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,265
I'll just come back stronger

1023
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,975
You try to cut me short

1024
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,353
I'll just come back longer

1025
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,523
If you beat me at ping pong
I'll just play ping pong-er

1026
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,442
Give me my throne, I am ready to thrive

1027
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:56,651
One thing I know

1028
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,987
I will survive

1029
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:05,160
I will survive

1030
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,332
Yes, thank you. I've been Bob the bird.

1031
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,002
He is so hot.

1032
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,796
Boom. That's it. You in.

1033
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,131
You're no Eva, but you're awesome.

1034
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,425
We'll see you at the performance
tomorrow night.

1035
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,137
Everyone from the village is coming.
It's gonna be off the charts.

1036
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,014
Everyone?

1037
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,307
Everyone?

1038
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,017
It's the perfect plan.

1039
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,771
Be happy we're only
plucking you, porcupine.

1040
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,940
Go away.

1041
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,110
Instead of chasing that bird
all over the jungle...

1042
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:42,280
we let him come to us,
at the Carnival show.

1043
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:46,159
I'll mesmerize them from the stage,
while in the audience...

1044
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,120
you, my little Gabi...

1045
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:53,125
you'll be my petite
weapon of mass destruction.

1046
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,377
It will be a performance...

1047
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,213
to die for.

1048
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,555
It only works when I do it.

1049
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,849
Okay. Love you.

1050
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,152
So minty.

1051
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:26,658
Yes!

1052
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,501
Hey, sweetie, there you are.
What's taking you so long?

1053
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,420
Enough with that GPS, really.

1054
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,829
The whole tribe's gathering
to watch the sunset. Come on.

1055
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,758
No, no. Hang on.
I just found Linda and Tulio's coordinates.

1056
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,343
They are just
on the other side of the grove.

1057
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,845
Look, they're really close.

1058
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,490
Yeah.

1059
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,265
Now, I know your dad
doesn't totally trust humans...

1060
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,601
but I'm sure if he met them,
he would change his mind.

1061
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,227
They can help keep this place safe.

1062
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,437
Yeah, Blu...

1063
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,355
my dad knows what he's doing.

1064
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,777
And can't you just forget Linda and Tulio
for one minute and enjoy a sunset?

1065
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,696
But I thought that was our plan.

1066
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,573
Route guidance complete.

1067
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:12,704
You know, maybe some places
shouldn't be found.

1068
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,041
Maybe they should just be left alone.

1069
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,546
She ate a bug. A bug!

1070
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,798
Blu, Blu, Blu! Calm down.

1071
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,550
Calm down? We had a plan.

1072
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,886
Help Linda and Tulio find the flock
and get home.

1073
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,414
But when I mentioned it to her,
she completely shut me down.

1074
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:33,892
And her father? A total nut job.

1075
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,727
He's got this weird thing about humans.

1076
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,896
He's got this weird thing about humans!

1077
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,106
He loves them. He's a pet!

1078
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,733
A pet?

1079
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,109
He called me a pet.

1080
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,570
I can't believe he used
the "P" word to my face.

1081
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,322
It's like he thinks
I'm the enemy or something.

1082
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,742
He's not one of us, Roberto.
Keep an eye on him.

1083
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,161
And that Roberto? He is always watching.

1084
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,873
He is always hovering around Jewel.
He is always singing something.

1085
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,250
I can't compete with that.

1086
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,417
You gotta bird up, bird!

1087
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,711
You gotta emancipate yourself
from domestication.

1088
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,797
Try to see this place through her eyes.

1089
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,800
Taste the flavors she's tasting.

1090
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,260
So I should eat a bug?

1091
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,469
That's just nasty, thinking about it.

1092
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,555
Glitter. Where is my glitter?

1093
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:12,722
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1094
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,600
I don't want apologies. I want glitter.

1095
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:19,312
Glitter is absolutely essential
for a magical performance.

1096
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,273
- Do you know nothing?
- Guys!

1097
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,650
Rehearsals, big day tomorrow.

1098
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,987
Ring a bell? Come on.
You're coming, right, Dad?

1099
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,446
Oh, yeah, of course.

1100
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,491
That girl put the "business"
in "show business."

1101
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,659
Blu, remember...

1102
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:36,162
I know, I know. Happy wife, happy life.

1103
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,461
What a glorious morning!

1104
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,302
I forgot I could have
mornings like this.

1105
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,809
Yeah.

1106
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:02,981
Your favorite.

1107
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,150
You remembered.

1108
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,777
Isn't that nice?

1109
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:14,159
It's so crazy good.

1110
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,536
Thank you so much, Blu.

1111
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,376
That's it!

1112
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,508
I'll be the one to surprise her.

1113
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,720
Breakfast in bed, coming up.

1114
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,050
Brazil nuts.

1115
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,219
Where are you?

1116
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,516
I know you're around here somewhere.

1117
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,729
Hey! Hey.

1118
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,398
No! Come back here. Wait!

1119
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:27,857
No!

1120
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,025
That's not a toy.

1121
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,069
Erratic driving. Pull over.

1122
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,205
No, no. Don't do it.

1123
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,102
I got you!

1124
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,229
Thank you.

1125
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:09,941
Finally!

1126
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,609
Brazil nuts.

1127
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,783
This is my most important tool.

1128
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,387
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

1129
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:46,102
I guess old Eddie's rules
don't apply to everyone.

1130
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,774
You're on our side.

1131
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,400
Really? Okay, my bad.

1132
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,943
I didn't know that. Sorry.

1133
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,821
Sorry! Sorry.

1134
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,992
You come over here, take our food...

1135
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,161
and now you insult me?

1136
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,499
No, no, no.
This is all just a big misunderstanding.

1137
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,127
You know,
I wish I could accept your apology.

1138
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:14,005
You seem like a nice bird.

1139
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,590
But this means war!

1140
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,344
What? Does it have to?
Can it mean something else?

1141
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,096
Today, in the Pit of Doom.

1142
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,516
Sorry, the "Pit of Doom"? Really?

1143
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,351
Really?

1144
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,854
High noon. I'll make some room.

1145
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,607
Sweep you up like a broom.

1146
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,199
You did what?

1147
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,367
It was an accident.

1148
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,369
- An accident?
- Hey, what's going on?

1149
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,330
Thanks to Drew, here, we could lose
our entire side of the grove.

1150
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,791
I was just trying to get a nut. One nut!

1151
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,877
You don't even like nuts!
What's gotten into you, Blu?

1152
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,712
I was getting it for you.

1153
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,673
You were?

1154
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,217
Roberto, I want your best birds on this.

1155
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,052
We are not giving up without a fight.

1156
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,220
Got it.

1157
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,389
You. Stay out of it.

1158
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,723
You've done enough.

1159
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,392
- Wait!
- Blu, he's right.

1160
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,394
Maybe you should just let
Dad and Roberto handle it.

1161
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,062
You don't think I can do this?

1162
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,565
No, I just don't know...

1163
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:18,027
if it's your exact area of expertise.

1164
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,739
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Pit of Doom, now!

1165
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,093
Radio!

1166
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,891
I hope you don't mind.

1167
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,435
I made myself at home.

1168
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,520
Lollipop?

1169
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:05,408
It's a shame, really. You came all
this way to protect the jungle.

1170
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,536
Let's see if it will return the favor.

1171
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,455
Tree huggers.

1172
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,967
Roberto.

1173
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,886
Felipe.

1174
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,390
No mercy!

1175
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,600
I have to stop this.

1176
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,768
What? Blu!

1177
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,436
Stop! Stop!

1178
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,896
Eduardo, this is crazy.

1179
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,944
We are an intelligent species with
advanced problem-solving capabilities.

1180
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,652
You brought this on us. Now, watch.

1181
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,333
Heads.

1182
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,334
Tails.

1183
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,295
I hate this job.

1184
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,345
It's a game. It's a game!

1185
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,348
It's not a game! It's war.

1186
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,686
It's a beautiful day in the Pit of Doom!

1187
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,813
It's winner take all!

1188
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,356
It's the best of seven.

1189
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:22,652
The winner will take control
of the entire Brazil nut grove!

1190
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,570
It's just like soccer. I can do this.

1191
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,099
All right, any special strategies?

1192
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,991
What are we running at,
4-4-2 or a 5-4-1?

1193
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,034
What are we doing here, coach?
What position do I play?

1194
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,578
Actually, I do have
a perfect spot for you.

1195
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:36,207
Water. Water here. Get your water.

1196
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,375
Okay, thanks.

1197
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:41,921
Roberto is unstoppable!
He's incredible! He's everywhere!

1198
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,423
Go, Roberto!

1199
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,716
I could have done that.

1200
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,092
Roberto springs free!

1201
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,421
There he goes, there he goes,
there he goes! He shoots!

1202
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:50,930
Goal!

1203
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,098
Goal!

1204
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,100
Goal! Goal!

1205
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,893
Goal!

1206
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,564
Oh, my!

1207
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,942
Felipe has the ball. The Red Macaws...

1208
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,235
are making a comeback.

1209
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,112
Felipe pass to Tito. Tito with Mario.

1210
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,406
Mario with Cesar. Cesar to Antonio.

1211
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,241
Felipe scores!

1212
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,036
Yes! In your face!

1213
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:16,247
Felipe, Roberto. Roberto, Felipe.
Roberto, Felipe. Felipe, Roberto!

1214
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,045
Goal!

1215
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,131
That has got to hurt.

1216
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,591
Go, go!

1217
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:31,429
Felipe-lipe-lipe!

1218
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:33,765
Hey!

1219
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:34,932
Foul!

1220
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,059
Come on, ref!

1221
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,603
Okay, you're in.

1222
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,395
Really?

1223
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:40,938
Not you. You.

1224
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,107
Watch and learn...

1225
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,442
water boy.

1226
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,570
All right, just get in there.

1227
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,780
Yes!

1228
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,115
Okay. Here we go, coach.

1229
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,283
Yeah, Dad!

1230
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:55,828
A new player is coming off the bench.
Is he a secret weapon?

1231
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:58,748
I think it's the water boy.

1232
01:12:58,916 --> 01:12:59,916
Hey, I'm open!

1233
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,459
I'm open, toss it to me!

1234
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,253
Hey, pass to me, I'm open.
I'm wide open!

1235
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,464
Pass the ball to me!

1236
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,259
Thanks for the pass, Blu!

1237
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:11,427
Mind if I borrow this?

1238
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,471
Roberto moves in. He shakes one...

1239
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:14,639
then another!

1240
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,681
Roberto!

1241
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,141
Goal!

1242
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:20,144
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

1243
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,987
We are tied in the Pit of Doom.

1244
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,823
Whoever scores next...

1245
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,199
wins it all!

1246
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,992
I got it, I got it!

1247
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,287
Come on, Blu.

1248
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,879
Wow! The water boy is suddenly
playing like a pro!

1249
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,513
Pass the ball to Roberto!

1250
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,684
Pass the ball! Pass the ball!

1251
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,353
- Blu, wait!
- No, this bird's got it covered.

1252
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,413
Goal!

1253
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,548
It looks like the secret weapon
just backfired!

1254
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,217
Let's go to Eduardo for his reaction.

1255
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,014
I'm gonna kill you, fanny pack!

1256
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,192
Check it out, old Eddie.

1257
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,070
Looks like you guys are
going to have to start a nut-free diet.

1258
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:57,408
We're gonna be talking about that
for a long time.

1259
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:05,124
I should never have expected more
from a human's pet.

1260
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,308
Hey.

1261
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,604
What happened back there?

1262
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,981
I was trying to be one of the tribe.

1263
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:32,318
But I guess I'm never gonna be
"the bird" like your dad wants me to be.

1264
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,655
- What?
- I think it's time to go home.

1265
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:37,573
We should talk about this.

1266
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,283
Talk about what?

1267
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,785
Blu, look around.

1268
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:45,456
The kids are thriving.
They love being in the wild.

1269
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,125
Maybe this place is home.

1270
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:50,586
Home? How could this be home?

1271
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:52,874
I have done everything I can
to fit in and help out...

1272
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,507
but no matter what I do, it's wrong.

1273
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,133
That's not home, Jewel.

1274
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:59,136
Maybe for you, but not for me.

1275
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:02,139
You know what?
You need to figure out what you want.

1276
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:07,311
And maybe, stop thinking about just
yourself and start thinking about us.

1277
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:46,684
Hey, you heard the boss.

1278
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,311
Move out! Let's go!

1279
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,735
Beautiful.

1280
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,878
Linda! Tulio!

1281
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,221
Goodbye, Linda.

1282
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,395
Goodbye, fanny pack.

1283
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,731
Turn around when possible.

1284
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:37,735
Sorry, GPS lady. It's not you. It's me.

1285
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:41,906
Goodbye, pancakes. Goodbye, coffee.

1286
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,326
Goodbye, coffee.

1287
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,581
Linda?

1288
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:52,750
Linda!

1289
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:59,006
Eduardo was right!

1290
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,735
- Traitor!
- Wait, you don't understand.

1291
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,094
What don't I understand?
Siding with humans?

1292
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,661
What do you even know about humans?

1293
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,766
I know everything.
They lure you in, they trap you.

1294
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,601
They destroy your mind!

1295
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,686
Polly want a cracker?
Polly want a cracker?

1296
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,688
No! Enough crackers!

1297
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,357
I hate crackers!

1298
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:21,278
Come on, Roberto!

1299
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,613
It's them. It's them!

1300
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:23,781
It's them!

1301
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:25,783
Roberto, get out of...

1302
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,789
Not again! Not again!
No more crackers!

1303
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:33,624
Snap out of it!

1304
01:18:34,603 --> 01:18:35,603
Look...

1305
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,228
we've got one chance to stop this, okay?

1306
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,295
I have to find my friends.

1307
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,214
You fly back and warn the others.
You got it?

1308
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,465
Yeah. I got it.

1309
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:42,967
- Okay. Go!
- Okay!

1310
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,472
Humans, humans!

1311
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,811
- Your left! Your right!
- My left?

1312
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,312
Left or right?

1313
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,067
- Your right leg, my left leg.
- Okay.

1314
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:02,319
Good! Good! Good!

1315
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,321
- Now, go up.
- Go up.

1316
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:06,991
Reach!

1317
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,367
Almost there!

1318
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:11,996
Linda...

1319
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,998
I'm so sorry.

1320
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,958
As bad as this is...

1321
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:20,671
there is no place I would rather be
in the whole world than with you.

1322
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,340
Even if it is tied to a tree.

1323
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:30,848
Linda!

1324
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,350
Blu!

1325
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:34,643
Blu!

1326
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:36,145
- Linda?
- Down here!

1327
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,356
What? Blu!

1328
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:42,193
What are you doing here?
This is dangerous!

1329
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,862
That's incredible!
It's a 2,000-mile flight!

1330
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,391
- Let's follow him!
- It's amazing!

1331
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,658
I told you I heard him.

1332
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,760
I'll take those.

1333
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,669
Game over!
It's over!

1334
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:43,921
Humans! The lights!

1335
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,340
It's over!

1336
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,509
He's been blabbering like this
since we found him.

1337
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,719
The loggers are coming!
And Blu is with them!

1338
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:51,887
- Traitor!
- No!

1339
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,430
No, Blu is trying to help us.

1340
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:54,848
What? By himself?

1341
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,600
Let's evacuate! We're leaving.

1342
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:57,935
Let's go. Everyone move out.

1343
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,270
- Go, go, go!
- Dad?

1344
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,230
No, not this time.
I'm not going with you.

1345
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:04,191
You have to go with me!
I will not put my family in danger again.

1346
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,027
Blu is my family,
and I'm not leaving him behind.

1347
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,946
You don't have to.

1348
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,783
Are you okay?

1349
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:18,205
Look, Eduardo, I might not be
the birdliest bird in the flock...

1350
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,291
but, for once,
that's actually a good thing.

1351
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:21,792
You know the jungle...

1352
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,460
I know humans.

1353
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,713
And I know that, together,
we can stop them.

1354
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,465
We can't let them take our home.

1355
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,719
Sure, it's hot and loud
and filled with creepy bugs...

1356
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,429
but it's ours.

1357
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,806
Let's fight for it. Who's with me?

1358
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,266
I'm with you!

1359
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,644
Anybody else?

1360
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,821
Stop! Stop!

1361
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:53,824
Stop!

1362
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,164
Stop!

1363
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:09,089
Yeah. Respect the rainforest!

1364
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,900
I knew it! I knew it!

1365
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:34,156
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

1366
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:37,201
It's just a bunch of pigeons.

1367
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,827
Get back to work!

1368
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,249
Lead the way, Blu.

1369
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,293
That's my name! Yes! You called me Blu.

1370
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,128
Yes, I am Blu!

1371
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,214
What? Right.

1372
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,840
Birds of blue feathers...

1373
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:54,093
Have to stick together!

1374
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:08,899
Everybody ready? And under!

1375
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:12,486
Over!

1376
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:16,573
Backwards!

1377
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:25,666
I will survive I will survive

1378
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,463
- Got him!
- Wow, precise.

1379
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,800
I ain't afraid of no birds.

1380
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,055
Attack!

1381
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:41,807
It's on in the Amazon.

1382
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,726
All right, hit it!

1383
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:47,604
High-five!

1384
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,070
Why? Why?

1385
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:56,613
Get a grip!

1386
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,536
Incoming!

1387
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,916
Halt!

1388
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,377
There he is.

1389
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,464
Charlie, prepare the nose-zooka.

1390
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:15,340
Tiago!

1391
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:16,925
Now we're talking.

1392
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:18,093
Ready...

1393
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,219
aim...

1394
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,387
fire!

1395
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,101
Foiled again.

1396
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:30,147
- Good job, Tiago.
- We're a great team, Dad!

1397
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,774
- Hey, old Eddie.
- Felipe.

1398
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:34,902
You think I would miss this party?
Game on!

1399
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,824
Hey! Come back!

1400
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:42,993
You're useless, all of you!

1401
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,620
Look out!

1402
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:51,335
Pick on someone your own size.

1403
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,177
No! No!

1404
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:04,807
I got you, I got you.
It's okay, you're safe now.

1405
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,524
That's a Linda.

1406
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,281
Yeah!

1407
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,578
We still got it, Blu!

1408
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,550
I have to do everything myself.

1409
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,139
Hey! Get away from that!

1410
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:49,226
No! No one steals my scene.

1411
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:56,900
Lollipop?

1412
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,241
What?

1413
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:07,619
What are you doing? Let go!

1414
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:08,787
Save yourself!

1415
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:11,915
Come on, let go!

1416
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,084
- Never!
- Are you crazy?

1417
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,044
You'll bring both of us down! Let go!

1418
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,589
Fly!

1419
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,799
Déjà vu, Blu.

1420
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:21,967
Nigel!

1421
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:24,469
Blu!

1422
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,472
Nigel!

1423
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:50,621
You.

1424
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:55,834
You will pay a painful price
for your pestilence!

1425
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:57,794
Hey, stop that! Get off of me!

1426
01:26:57,962 --> 01:27:00,464
A flurry of furious feathers
in your face!

1427
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,174
You don't have to do this!

1428
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,426
No, I just want to.

1429
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:05,636
Hey, stop! Stop!

1430
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:08,639
Oh, my goodness. Charlie!
This is it. This is it!

1431
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,599
Steady. Steady.

1432
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,017
Slap fight!

1433
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,146
Shoot! Shoot!

1434
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:25,822
Nigel!

1435
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,878
Is this the end?

1436
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:41,505
I was too young...

1437
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,383
too beautiful to live.

1438
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:50,013
- Bob?
- Hold up! That ain't Bob!

1439
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:52,057
I told you I knew him from somewhere.

1440
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,267
My final curtain call.

1441
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:57,688
And it's standing room only.

1442
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,357
Goodbye.

1443
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:16,456
No!

1444
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:18,458
No! What have I done?

1445
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,544
If I cannot liveth with thee...

1446
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:23,380
then I shall not liveth at all.

1447
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:48,989
That frog is not poisonous.

1448
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,407
What?

1449
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:51,825
We're not dead?

1450
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,162
It's a very common mistake.
But she's a harmless pseudo-dendrobates.

1451
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:56,788
You can tell by the pink spots.

1452
01:28:56,956 --> 01:29:01,084
But my parents always told me I was
poisonous and shouldn't touch anyone.

1453
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,587
You just had really mean parents.

1454
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:05,255
Oh, wow.

1455
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:06,757
So, now...

1456
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:09,009
we can be together!

1457
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,851
- Nigel! Nigel-Wigel-Wigglepuss!
- No!

1458
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,937
- Somebody, help me!
- I'm going to never let you go.

1459
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,773
- I'm sorry, I'll be nicer. No!
- Never gonna let you go!

1460
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,191
No, Charlie!

1461
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,777
Charlie!

1462
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,988
This is unnatural!

1463
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,629
Hey, guys! Hi!

1464
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,465
There's nothing in my hair, right? Okay.

1465
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:51,343
Directly from the heart of the
Amazon rainforest...

1466
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,220
we have some breaking news.

1467
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:55,347
Thanks to Dr. Monteiro and his team...

1468
01:29:55,515 --> 01:30:00,018
the entire area will be designated
as a National Wildlife Refuge.

1469
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:03,188
And together,
we'll make sure this place stays safe.

1470
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,356
Right, Blu?

1471
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,901
But that's not the only good news.

1472
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,195
We found this cockatoo
deep in the Amazon...

1473
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,906
and he seems to have bonded
with a tree frog.

1474
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:16,993
We are bringing them back to Rio
for continuing observation.

1475
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,540
Oh, Nigel! Wow!
A honeymoon in Rio!

1476
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,545
Put your paws, talons
and tails together...

1477
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:29,589
for the most amazing talent
ever gathered in one jungle.

1478
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:33,385
It's "Amazon Untamed!"

1479
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:35,387
Come on! Get up!

1480
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:36,555
Yeah!

1481
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,850
What's up? Don't bite it
What's up? Don't bite it

1482
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:43,728
Where my birds at?

1483
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:47,190
We're together no matter
Where we might go

1484
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,027
Flap your wings!

1485
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:53,113
If we're not all together
We can't go far

1486
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,406
Amazon!

1487
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:58,702
It's an emerald we treasure

1488
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,871
Coming from the jungle to you

1489
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:02,289
Bam!

1490
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:06,376
Beating like its heart beats

1491
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:09,379
Playing rhythms we've grown to

1492
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:13,717
It's the emerald we treasure

1493
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,429
- Coming from the place where we live
- The place where we live

1494
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:20,056
- The home of freedom and happiness
- Happiness

1495
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:22,584
Time flies forever
The jungle's like a breeze, it's a wonder

1496
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,061
Now get out your tutu
In case someone wants you to dance

1497
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,899
- Hello, Amazon!
- Hey, Luiz!

1498
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:32,777
- Hey birds, I made it!
- Welcome to the jungle, dawg!

1499
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:41,244
All my turtles! Hardcore turtles!

1500
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,337
Sing it, baby!

1501
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:54,591
Rafi!

1502
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:00,889
Are you sure you can make
the Amazon our home...

1503
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,266
with the heat and the creepy bugs?

1504
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:05,393
Are you kidding? I am Mr. Jungle.

1505
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:08,188
Totally wild, and very birdly.

1506
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:12,150
Maybe we can do summers in Rio.

1507
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:13,944
You're my one and only, Jewel.

1508
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:18,073
We're together
No matter where we might go

1509
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:24,746
Forever together We can go far

1510
01:32:26,582 --> 01:32:29,626
That's the end?

1510
01:32:30,305 --> 01:32:36,501
