1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,952
Survival of the fittest.

2
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,235
It's the law of the jungle.

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,278
There's always someone trying
to take what's yours.

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,469
How do I know?

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,275
It almost happened to me.

6
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Hi-yah!

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,559
Tim Templeton...

8
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,948
quit monkeying around.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,758
Hot dogs are getting cold.

10
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,114
Hot dogs?

11
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,236
At least, this is how I remember it.

12
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,560
All right, buddy, let's eat.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,477
You see, I was seven years old...

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,598
and back then,
you relied on your imagination.

15
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,557
When I wasn't exploring the Congo...

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,950
I was a deep sea diver.

17
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,150
Tim!

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Our hero!

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,634
Don't worry, Mom and Dad.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
I got this!

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,629
Grab on!

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,230
Some days, I rescued my parents.

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
That way!

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,232
Other days, they rescued me.

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,111
- I'm losing control.
- Tim, look out!

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,039
Tree!

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,030
You're breaking up!

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Slow down, Tim!

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,679
- Turn, Tim.
- Turn!

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,799
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,075
Show Mommy your teeth.

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,918
It was just the three of us.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,354
The Templetons.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,670
And three is the perfect number.

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Interesting fact...

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,798
did you know that the triangle
is the strongest shape found in nature?

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,351
I was the luckiest kid ever.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,670
My parents even had cool jobs.

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,519
They worked for the biggest pet company
in the world...

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Puppy Co.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,631
- Yes, Mr. F rancis?
- Puppy Co needs you.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,835
It's go ti me.

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,311
They worked in a department
called "Marketing..."

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,671
where they got to launch new products.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,593
Even though my parents
worked really hard...

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,120
they still made just enough time for me.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,039
Three stories, five hugs,
and my special song, right?

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
You got it!

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,792
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,230
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,789
All your life

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,556
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,150
Hey, Tim. How would you like
to have a baby brother?

54
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,470
No, thanks. I'm enough.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,551
Life was good. Life was perfect.

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,358
But as I drifted off to sleep...

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,478
something my parents said
got me thinking.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,710
Where do babies come from?

59
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,309
The day I got a little brother
started like any other day...

60
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,878
but little did I know...

61
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,952
my life would never be the same.

62
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,958
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a.m.

63
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,520
Wake up, little halflings!

64
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,470
Morning, Wizzie!

65
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,315
What great adventure
lies in wait for you today?

66
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Oh, yeah!

67
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,631
My parents always said
that I had an overactive imagination.

68
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,839
But I clearly remember...

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,390
the baby was delivered in a taxi.

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What the...

71
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Hey!

72
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,878
Tim, look who's here.

73
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,037
Meet your new baby brother.

74
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,349
Baby what?

75
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,751
Brother.

76
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,717
I had a million questions.

77
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,711
Who is this guy? Why is he here?

78
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
What's with that outfit?

79
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,355
Why's he so fat? Why's he staring at me?

80
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,351
Does he know karate? What's going on?

81
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,070
That way?

82
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

83
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,016
Right from the start,
he was yelling at people...

84
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,678
ordering everyone around.

85
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,393
Oh, you want this?

86
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,236
One thing was clear. He was the boss.

87
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,111
He set up his office, right
smack dab in the middle of the house.

88
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
He conducted meetings.

89
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,431
- You called?
- Do you need Señor Squeaky?

90
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,913
Lots and lots of meetings.

91
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,752
Even in the middle of the night.

92
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,033
I'm up! I'm up!

93
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,736
- We're coming!
- We'll be right there!

94
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,957
If things weren't done
to his immediate satisfaction...

95
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,556
he had a fit.

96
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,593
- Where's the bottle?
- He has to have his bottle!

97
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,553
He had everyone wrapped around
his chubby little finger.

98
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,111
Everyone except for me.

99
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,908
- Diaper!
- Bottle!

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,956
Dad! I can't sleep.

101
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,633
I know, bud. Me neither.

102
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,916
The baby needs a lot of attention
right now.

103
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Okay, good talk!

104
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,355
- But...
- It's okay.

105
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,635
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

106
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What about me?

107
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,596
The year: 2057.

108
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,038
Ensign T-Rex and I are investigating
a hostile alien invasion.

109
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,151
It's so much worse than we thought.

110
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,719
Mom, he's naked!

111
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm naked!

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,149
Say "naked."

113
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
No!

114
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,514
Who's Mommy's little cutie?
Are you Mommy's little cutie?

115
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,035
No, he's Daddy's little tough guy,
right?

116
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,760
You know one of us has to go
with Mr. Francis to the pet convention.

117
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,068
In Vegas.

118
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,440
- You know what? You should go.
- No, no. You should go.

119
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Well, you need a break.

120
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,336
- I'll stay with the baby, and you...
- Maybe the baby should decide.

121
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,670
Who do you want to stay with you?
Daddy or Mommy?

122
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,989
Or Daddy?

123
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,593
He wants his mommy.

124
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,557
Okay, we need to talk!

125
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,755
In private.

126
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,279
- Sure.
- About what, bud?

127
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,431
About the b-a-b-e-e.

128
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,359
"Y ', ' Tim.

129
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,238
Why? Because he came out of nowhere!

130
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
We don't even know him.

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,754
How can we trust him?

132
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,672
Come on, he's just a baby.

133
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,714
Seriously? I'm the only one that thinks
there's something weird about this guy?

134
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,911
- Oopsie! I got it.
- Five-second rule.

135
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,348
Tim?

136
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,753
Look at him! He wears a suit!

137
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,593
I know. Isn't it cute?
He's like a little man.

138
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,591
He carries a briefcase.

139
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,557
Does no else think that's...

140
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,950
I don't know, a little freaky?

141
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,599
Well, you carried Lam-Lam around
until you were like...

142
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,273
This is not about Lam-Lam.

143
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,559
All babies are different, Tim.

144
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,073
And each one is special.

145
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,958
He's taking over the whole house!

146
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,439
Are you taking over the house?

147
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,397
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

148
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,119
Trust me, one day you're gonna
get to know this little guy...

149
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,794
and you are gonna love him
with all of your heart.

150
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Just like we do.

151
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,753
All of your heart?

152
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,471
Never.

153
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,190
Hello!

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,989
It's time for my three stories,
five hugs, and special song!

155
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,191
How about one story...

156
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,477
three hugs, and my special song?

157
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,230
Just my special song?

158
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,833
Mom?

159
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,514
Dad?

160
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,828
Hey.

161
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,752
What happened to bedtime?

162
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,040
We'll have it on Monday, Mr. Francis.

163
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,997
Don't cry! Don't cry.

164
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Hello?

165
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,272
Hello? No, ma'am, not yet.

166
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,550
No, I'm not making excuses.

167
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,513
Yes, ma'am,
I know I've been here a long time.

168
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,029
Believe me, it feels like my whole life.

169
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,033
I'm making great progress
with the parents already.

170
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,557
The usual procedure,
sleep deprivation, hunger strikes.

171
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,392
They're very disoriented.

172
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,949
I've got them
eating out of the palm of my hand.

173
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,390
They do everything for me.

174
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,709
It's hilarious.

175
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,472
But I think the kid might be on to me.

176
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,396
No, I can handle him.

177
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,755
I know how important this mission is
to the company.

178
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,154
Mission?

179
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,153
Well, trust me, ma'am.
You got the right baby for this job.

180
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,753
Hands up, devil baby!

181
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Fart! Poop! Doodie!

182
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,993
I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.

183
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
You can talk!

184
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,591
Uh, goo-goo ga-ga.

185
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,990
No, you can really talk. I heard you!

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,070
Fine. I can talk.

187
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,560
Now, let's see if you can listen.

188
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,680
Get me a double espresso...

189
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,896
and see if there's someplace around here
with decent sushi.

190
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,992
I'd kill for a spicy tuna roll
right about now.

191
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,758
Get yourself a little something.

192
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,433
Who are you?

193
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,195
Let's just say I'm the boss.

194
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,591
The boss?
You're a baby! You wear a diaper.

195
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,352
You know who else wears diapers?

196
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,954
Astronauts and NASCAR drivers,
that's who.

197
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,520
It's called efficiency, Templeton.

198
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,428
The average toddler spends, what?
45 hours a year on the potty?

199
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,950
I'm the boss.
I don't have that kind of spare time.

200
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,678
Well, you're not the boss of me.

201
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,956
- I am the boss of you.
- No, you're not.

202
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
- Am, too.
- Are not.

203
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,554
- Am, too!
- Are not!

204
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,269
- Am, too.
- Are not!

205
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
- Am, too.
- Are not!

206
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,108
Am, too. Am, too.

207
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
I was here first.

208
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,550
Just wait until Mom and Dad find out
about this.

209
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,029
Oh, yeah?
You think they'd pick you over me?

210
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,719
With your track record?

211
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,472
You don't know anything about me.

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,389
So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
Let's see.

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,190
Templeton, Timothy. Middle name...

214
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,990
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,990
Leslie!

216
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,878
- Mostly C's...
- How do you know all that?

217
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,156
Can't ride a bike without training wheels?

218
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,313
Even bears can ride a bike
without training wheels, Leslie.

219
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,235
DOB says you're seven.

220
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,674
Seven and a half.

221
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,551
Power nap! You were saying?

222
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,153
I'm seven and a half.

223
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,833
Exactly! You're old.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,912
It's time to make way
for the next generation.

225
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,354
It's the way of the world.

226
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,750
You would never ask your parents
for an old toy.

227
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Lam-Lam?

228
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,216
Everyone wants the hot, new thing.

229
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,719
Destroy. Destroy.

230
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,348
- Lam-Lam!
- I've got fresh batteries.

231
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Boom!

232
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,272
Mom and Dad don't even know you.

233
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,714
They love me!

234
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,353
Oh, yeah? Do the math, kid.

235
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,909
There's only so much love to go around.

236
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,957
It's like these beads.

237
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,509
You used to have all your parents' love.

238
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,950
All their time. All their attention.

239
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,190
You had all the beads.

240
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,918
But then I came along.

241
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,957
Babies take up a lot of time.

242
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,556
They need a lot of attention.
They get all the love.

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,399
We could share.

244
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,790
You obviously didn't go to business school.

245
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,917
Look, Templeton,
the numbers just don't add up.

246
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,389
There's not enough love
for the two of us.

247
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,710
Not enough beads to go around.

248
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,475
And then, all of a sudden,
there's no place for Tim.

249
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,153
Tim doesn't fit anymore.

250
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,709
Oh, no! What about Tim?

251
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,309
So keep quiet. Stay out of my way.

252
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,311
Or there's gonna be cutbacks.

253
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,629
You can't be fired from your own family.

254
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,433
Can you?

255
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,512
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a.m.

256
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,795
Wake up, little half...

257
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,393
What's the use?

258
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,714
Arise for a nutritious breakfast!

259
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,279
It's 7:00 a.m.

260
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,438
What's wrong, Timothy?

261
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,636
Has that little dwarf made you blue?

262
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,950
Mm-hmm.

263
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,759
Then I shall cast upon him
a great curse!

264
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,275
He shall not pass!

265
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,793
It's no use, Wizzie.

266
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,791
He's got Mom and Dad completely fooled.

267
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,952
If they knew what I knew,
they'd never let him stay.

268
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,797
Perhaps your parents
need to be enlightened.

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,116
With a great curse!

270
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,554
They shall not pass!

271
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,551
Yeah. I need to enlighten them...

272
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,834
with proof!

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,558
That's what I need, proof!

274
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,911
Expose his dark magic!

275
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,839
Testing, testing.

276
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,314
Testing, testing.

277
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,136
Maybe they can return him to the store...

278
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,354
and get their money back!

279
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,112
We could buy a bouncy house!

280
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,670
Godspeed, Tim! It's 8:45 a.m.

281
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Ninja.

282
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Ninja.

283
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Ninja.

284
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,838
Ninja.

285
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,154
Babies everywhere! They're spreading.

286
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,914
Mom! Dad! What's going on?

287
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,078
It's an invasion!

288
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,557
It's a play date!

289
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,239
That's a keeper.

290
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,039
It's a meeting,
and you won't be attending.

291
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,038
We'll see about that.

292
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,672
Thank you all for coming here
on such short notice.

293
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,068
Now, before we begin...

294
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,870
Yes, sir!

295
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,274
- Sure is!
- Affirmative!

296
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,112
Jimbo, run some interference.

297
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,715
Hey!

298
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,440
- We babies are having a crisis!
- Oh, no!

299
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,669
- That's awful!
- Horrible!

300
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
What is it?

301
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,759
It's simpler if I just show you.
Teddy, if you please.

302
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,598
Let's put on a show.

303
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,869
Here we go!

304
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,268
Jimbo, hit the lights.

305
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,271
You see, babies aren't getting
as much love as we used to.

306
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,198
Why? Have we been bad?

307
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
No, Staci.

308
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,118
But I'll tell you who is.

309
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,716
Behold our mortal enemy.
Puppies!

310
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,076
No! That's exactly the problem.

311
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,714
Puppies? What's the deal with puppies?

312
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,949
Throughout history...

313
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,358
people have loved babies
more than anything in the world.

314
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,158
We've always been a must-have item...

315
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,595
number one on every wish list.

316
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,672
Puppies were merely accessories.

317
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,358
But all that changed
when the puppies began coming out...

318
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,511
with new designer models.

319
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,280
Each one more adorable than the last.

320
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,237
Remember the Labradoodle?

321
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,594
The Peekapoo?

322
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,638
The Chiweenie?
Try to say "Chiweenie" without smiling.

323
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,360
Not possible. Don't waste your time.

324
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,072
We all laughed at the Shar Pei.

325
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,950
And now it's number one in China.

326
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,440
- Oh, no.
- That's terrible!

327
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,318
- Horrible!
- Yes.

328
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,799
And it gets even worse.

329
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,669
Francis Francis, the CEO of Puppy Co,
made this announcement.

330
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,239
Teddy, roll the clip.

331
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,391
And we are on schedule...

332
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,030
to release the most adorable puppy ever.

333
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,988
We're gonna launch it
at the pet convention in Las Vegas!

334
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,434
Watch out, world!

335
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,194
It's gonna crush the competition!

336
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,268
- Yay!
- No, Jimbo.

337
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,635
No "yay"! We are the competition!

338
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,119
This is war.

339
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,714
Puppies are winning,
and babies are losing.

340
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,710
Thank you, Teddy.

341
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,950
And if this new puppy
is as cute as we fear...

342
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,634
it could put the baby business
out of business, baby.

343
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
That's awful!

344
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Bad news, baby!

345
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,393
What are we going to do?

346
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,869
My job is to find out exactly what
that new puppy is...

347
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,712
so that Baby Corp can stop it.

348
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,233
And you're going to help me.

349
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,150
- Genius!
- Home run!

350
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
You still got it, boss!

351
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,190
Yay!

352
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,110
Yay.

353
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,157
Now, your parents all work for Puppy Co.

354
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,470
So have you learned anything from them?

355
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,914
- Yes, sir!
- Sure did!

356
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,195
Fantastic. Triplets, go!

357
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,156
- A.
- B.

358
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
- C.
- D.

359
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,590
No, what have you learned
about the new puppy?

360
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,915
Yay, puppy!

361
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,798
No, Jimbo! Puppies are evil.

362
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,234
Staci, read back the notes.

363
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,960
I can't read. What's it say?

364
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,952
This is my team?

365
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,839
A muscle-head, a bunch of yes men,
and a doodler?

366
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,796
- Exactly!
- Affirmative!

367
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,631
Good call.

368
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,840
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice one, BB!

369
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,989
Gotcha!

370
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,199
Put that cookie down.
Cookies are for closers.

371
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,920
- Let's have another show!
- No, Teddy!

372
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,758
- How about a hug?
- No more shows!

373
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,511
Boss?

374
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,148
- There's plenty of love to go around.
- Go to sleep!

375
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,355
Nighty-night.

376
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,350
- Boss!
- Boss!

377
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
- What?
- Parents!

378
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,320
It's like they're having their own
little meeting.

379
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,397
- Isn't that adorable?
- Who wants dessert?

380
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,634
God, this is so humiliating.

381
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,358
God, this is so humiliating.

382
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,039
Wait until Mom and Dad hear this.

383
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,955
Hey, Templeton, what you got there?

384
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,034
Nothing.

385
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,519
Hand over the tape.

386
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Never!

387
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,990
Mom! Dad! Over here!

388
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,355
- Hi, Timmy!
- Hi! Anyway...

389
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,075
Flower power!

390
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,639
You can't get away from Johnny Law,
simpleton.

391
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,034
Fasten your seat belt. Let's go!

392
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,829
Run, run, run.

393
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,549
What? Hey!

394
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Uh-oh.

395
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,788
Run, run, run.

396
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,473
Catch, catch, catch.

397
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Yes!

398
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Oh, yeah!

399
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,158
Let go, you little...

400
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,436
Oh, look!
The kids are finally getting along.

401
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,914
That's nice.

402
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Sayonara!

403
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
You wanna play?

404
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Let's play.

405
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,598
No!

406
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,115
Save Boss! Save Boss!

407
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
- Get him!
- I got him!

408
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
- I got him!
- I got him!

409
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,072
You're toast, baby man!

410
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,231
Upsies, I need upsies!

411
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,319
Who wants...

412
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,595
Cheese sticks!

413
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,830
Mom, Dad! I've got proof!

414
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,351
Someone can't go down the stairs?

415
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,910
Nothing can stop me!

416
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,033
Mom! Dad! Where are you guys?

417
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Hello?

418
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,753
Where did everyone go?

419
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,675
Mom, Dad! The baby can talk!

420
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,512
Oh, can he now?

421
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,954
Wait, how did you...

422
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,314
Hand over the tape, Timmy.

423
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,959
Or Lam-Lam gets it, see?

424
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
No!

425
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,235
What's that, Lam-Lam?
You want a nose ring?

426
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,278
It's really not my scene,
but who am I to judge?

427
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,476
And an eyebrow ring?
Seems like a little too much, Lam-Lam.

428
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,877
How's that gonna look in a job interview?

429
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,870
Stop it!

430
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,951
The tape, Timmy!
Or I'm gonna rip, rip, rip.

431
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,235
No! Let go!

432
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,440
- You let go!
- You let go!

433
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,040
- Give me the tape!
- Give me Lam-Lam!

434
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,952
Whoops! Too far.

435
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,078
Templeton!
Templeton, let's be reasonable.

436
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,120
We can be reasonable, right?
What are you doing?

437
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,236
You've been asking for this
since you got here!

438
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,112
We can talk about this over a juice box!

439
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,833
Time for juice boxes is over.

440
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,309
No, Templeton. You wouldn't.

441
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,596
Say bye-bye, baby! You're fired!

442
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,510
What are you doing?

443
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Nothing.

444
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
My proof!

445
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,678
Tim! Explain yourself!

446
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,955
Yes, explain yourself.

447
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,758
It wasn't me! It was the baby's fault.

448
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,029
The baby's fault?

449
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,952
It's true! He can talk.

450
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,756
They all can talk.
They were having a meeting.

451
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,176
There's something about puppies.

452
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,350
It's one big baby con-spy-racy!

453
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,192
Timothy Leslie Templeton!

454
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,839
We are very disappointed in you.

455
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,355
- No, we're mad at you!
- Exactly, we're mad at you.

456
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,118
- Mad?
- You need a time-out!

457
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,998
- You're grounded!
- Yes, grounded!

458
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
- For two...
- Three!

459
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,355
- Three days?
- Weeks!

460
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,748
Weeks! Three weeks!

461
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,751
For three... evers!

462
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,670
Grounded?

463
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,559
You're gonna stay in this house
with your baby brother...

464
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,029
until you learn to get along.

465
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Great.

466
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,478
It was my first time behind bars.

467
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,312
The big house.

468
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,799
The lock-up.

469
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,032
Grounded for life.

470
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,235
The minutes turned into hours,
the hours into days.

471
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,231
Every man has his breaking point.

472
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,279
This was mine.

473
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,877
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

474
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,069
- Take these broken wings and learn to fly
- Hey, that's my song.

475
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,995
All your life

476
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,038
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

477
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,591
It's okay, little halfling.

478
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,354
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

479
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,913
Blackbird singing in the dead of night!

480
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,591
Pray, take these broken wings
and learn to fly!

481
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,352
Fly, you fools!

482
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,635
Thanks, Wizzie.

483
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,038
But it's not the same.

484
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,839
If only I could reach my magical shank.

485
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,468
I could break us out of this big house.

486
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Templeton!

487
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,118
Templeton, we have to talk.

488
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Go away.

489
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,070
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

490
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,796
Stop it!

491
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,558
That's my song, not yours.

492
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,517
My parents wrote it just for me.

493
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,955
Really?
Your parents are Lennon and McCartney?

494
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,350
No, Ted and Janice.

495
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,839
You don't even know their names!

496
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,640
You're just trying to steal them from me.

497
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,954
You stole everything!

498
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,792
You're the one who should be in jail!

499
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,872
Look, it's time
we put our differences aside.

500
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Have you been...

501
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
No!

502
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,953
Where's HR when you need them?

503
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,950
Take it.

504
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,838
I don't want your filthy money.

505
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,150
Look, I told you to stay out of my way.

506
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,151
I can't! You're in my house.

507
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,469
I don't wanna be here...

508
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,278
any more than you want me to be here.

509
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,311
Then why are you torturing me?

510
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,948
The truth is I'm no ordinary baby.

511
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Well, no kidding.

512
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,316
I'm on a mission from above.

513
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,675
Are you the Baby Jesus?

514
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,435
Yes. I'm the Baby Jesus.

515
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
No!

516
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,994
You see, I'm more middle management
for the company.

517
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,116
The company? What company?

518
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Here.

519
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,196
Take this. It'll explain everything.

520
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,952
What do you want me to do with that?

521
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,511
- I want you to suck it.
- You suck it!

522
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,516
No, it's for you to suck.

523
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm not sucking that!

524
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,456
- Suck it.
- I don't know where it's been!

525
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,358
It's not where it's been.
It's where it will take you.

526
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Don't you wanna know...

527
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,597
where babies really come from?

528
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,599
Binky. Papish. Nuk-Nuk.

529
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,955
Boo-Boo. Bo-Bo. Bah-Bah.

530
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,429
Chupie. Hushie-Baby. Tootsie.

531
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,636
It goes by many names.

532
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,758
But through its power,
you will know the truth.

533
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Come on, faster!

534
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Mommy!

535
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,948
Where are we?

536
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,475
Welcome to Baby Corp!

537
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,874
No way.

538
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,308
- Thank you.
- What?

539
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,470
Relax. They can't see us or hear us.

540
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,551
- We're, like, virtual and stuff?
- Yep.

541
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,312
- You mean they won't feel this?
- Nope.

542
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,629
- Or this?
- Nada.

543
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Karate!

544
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,514
Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton.
I can still see you.

545
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,597
So this is where babies come from?

546
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,876
Where'd you think, the cabbage patch?

547
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Magic fairies?

548
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,196
No, my parents told me that...

549
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,554
What?

550
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,756
No. That's disgusting.

551
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,150
Yeah, it didn't sound right to me, either.

552
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,389
I can't believe
my parents didn't tell me about this.

553
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,836
If people knew where babies really
came from, they'd never have one.

554
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,718
Same thing with hot dogs, by the way.

555
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,279
Going upsies!

556
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,352
So how come I don't remember this place?

557
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,350
You did.

558
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,760
But after normal babies
get their pacifiers taken away...

559
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,871
you forget all about Baby Corp.

560
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,359
How come you're not normal?

561
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,750
A few of us, the best of the best...

562
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,512
are selected for the...

563
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,952
For the ultimate honor.

564
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,558
Upper management.

565
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,190
This, Templeton,
is where all the action is.

566
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,715
Nap time in Sector G.

567
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,277
So this whole place is run by babies?

568
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Yep.

569
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,710
My Dad says, "Those who can, do."

570
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,313
"And those who can't, supervise."

571
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,788
Your father is a hippy.

572
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,913
What happens when you grow up?

573
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,916
We don't.

574
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,396
We drink a super-secret baby formula
that keeps us babies forever.

575
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,708
Back to work! Formula break is over!

576
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,319
We're in a crisis here!

577
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,000
Don't you know we're in a crisis here?

578
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Who is that?

579
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,800
That is my boss. Big Boss Baby.

580
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,916
What is she screaming about?

581
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,479
Well, see this pie chart?

582
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,956
Wow, it looks like a giant pie.

583
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,588
It represents all the love there is
in the world.

584
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,988
- I love pie.
- Who doesn't?

585
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,990
- Apple.
- Fine.

586
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
- No, cherry!
- Perfect!

587
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
- Not pumpkin.
- Okay.

588
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,076
That's a vegetable.

589
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,835
Point is, the puppies' slice
is getting bigger and bigger.

590
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,598
They're stealing all our love!

591
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,753
Just like you did to me.

592
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Exactly.

593
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,112
And if this keeps up...

594
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,794
there might not be enough pie left
for babies.

595
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
No pie?

596
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,758
No pie.

597
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,273
So, my mission is to find out
what this new puppy is.

598
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,431
So you're, like, on a spy mission? Cool!

599
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,279
Yes! Cool!
And if... When I succeed...

600
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,829
I'll become a Baby Corp legend.

601
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,639
Like Super Big Boss Baby,
Mega Boss Baby...

602
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,631
Seriously Big Boss Baby...

603
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
and him.

604
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,119
Now that's a big, fat baby.

605
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,711
No, that's Big Fat Boss Baby.

606
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,634
This is Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby.

607
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,156
He was the youngest Chief Executive Infant
in the history of the company.

608
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,992
Was? What happened to him?

609
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,798
Retired, years ago.

610
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,991
But I still try and live up to his legend.

611
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,832
In every situation, I ask myself...

612
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,991
"W-W-S-C-B-F-B-B-D?

613
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,320
"What Would Super Colossal
Big Fat Boss Baby Do?"

614
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,878
So that's all you get?
Your picture on the wall?

615
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,314
Come here!

616
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,075
I'll get a promotion.

617
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,196
The corner office...

618
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,191
with my own private potty.

619
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,748
Wow.

620
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,354
So when you're done,
you're coming back here?

621
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,078
A-S-A-P, T-i-m.

622
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,834
I'm not a family man.
I belong behind a desk.

623
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,831
- That's awesome!
- I know, right?

624
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,509
- Pew pew.
- What?

625
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,195
So help me,
I will nail his diaper to the wall!

626
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,510
Have we heard anything
from that little Boss Baby...

627
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,193
that we sent down to the T empletons?

628
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,918
- I don't know.
- You're fired!

629
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,876
Oh, no.

630
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,189
You're all fired!

631
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,191
The pet convention is in two days.

632
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,873
If he doesn't come up with answers...

633
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,598
he is fired, retired!

634
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,512
- Gone!
- Tour's over.

635
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,875
What was Big Bossy Baby Lady
screaming about?

636
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,270
She's demanding actual results.

637
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,352
The pet convention is in two days,
and I've got nothing!

638
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,394
That's her! Don't answer it!

639
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Stress nap!

640
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,435
If I don't find out
what that new puppy is and fast...

641
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,240
not only will I not get that promotion...

642
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,628
I could get fired!

643
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Hey, relax.

644
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,755
I'm sure there's other cool jobs
for babies, right?

645
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,076
Meanwhile, two days goes by like that.

646
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,309
You better start packing.

647
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
What?

648
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,919
You don't get it, Templeton.

649
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,594
If I'm fired,
they'll take away my formula.

650
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,671
I will turn into a normal baby...

651
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,592
and live here forever with you.

652
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,034
- No!
- Yes!

653
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,918
And I promise you this...

654
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,514
Every morning you wake up...

655
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,238
I'll be there.

656
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,519
Every night, at dinner...

657
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,558
I'll be there.

658
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,392
Every birthday party...

659
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,551
I'll be there.

660
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,199
Every Christmas!

661
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,509
I'll be there

662
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,240
Year after year after year.

663
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,231
We will grow old together.

664
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,679
You and I...

665
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,351
will be brothers.

666
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Always.

667
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,190
- No. No, this is terrible!
- I know.

668
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,032
- This can't be happening.
- But it is!

669
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,456
- You can't stay here!
- I can't!

670
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,072
- Don't panic!
- But it feels right!

671
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,071
I know, but we have to fix this.

672
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,791
We have to make sure
you don't get fired.

673
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
We?

674
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,311
We.

675
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,754
I will help you...

676
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,148
but just to get rid of you.

677
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,548
Deal?

678
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,270
Deal.

679
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,078
Here's to never seeing you again.

680
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,719
Back at ya, baby.

681
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,592
Now let's get to work.

682
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,318
Come on, come on, come on.

683
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,637
Slice!

684
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,239
No, no.

685
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,310
There's nothing here about a new puppy.

686
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,833
Aren't you gonna do any work?

687
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,319
I'm very busy delegating.

688
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
He drains it!

689
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,871
So once we find the file
on the new puppy...

690
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
what do we do then?

691
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,758
Send in the baby ninjas?

692
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Even better.

693
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,832
I'm going to write the perfect memo.

694
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,194
- Boom!
- Boom!

695
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,630
Wait. What's a memo?

696
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,031
A memo is something you write
to give people information.

697
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,674
That's your plan?
You're gonna write a book report?

698
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,512
That's so boring.

699
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,908
No, Templeton.

700
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,680
Memos are for important things.

701
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,274
A memo can bring people together.

702
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,954
A memo can be a call to arms...

703
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,634
a manifesto, a poem.

704
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,559
A memo can change the world.

705
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,318
Wow! When you explain it like that...

706
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,118
it still sounds boring.

707
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,119
You'll learn, kid.

708
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
You'll learn.

709
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,636
Wait a second. This is it!

710
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,119
What? What is it?

711
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,714
Check this out.
Take Your Kid to Work Day.

712
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,395
People take children
to a place of business? Why?

713
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,959
Because it's awesome!

714
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,116
It's disgusting.

715
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,396
Don't you see?
We can get inside Puppy Co...

716
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,118
and find out what the new puppy is!

717
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
What's the point?

718
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,835
You're grounded.

719
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,076
Your parents aren't
going to take us anywhere.

720
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,591
You're right.
They think we hate each other.

721
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,392
Hate is a strong word.

722
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,039
It's the right word, but still.

723
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,076
We have to convince them
that we're actual brothers.

724
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,110
Right.

725
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,838
That we...

726
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Loathe?

727
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
No.

728
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,356
Like!

729
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,834
No. That we...

730
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,758
La, la, la...

731
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,194
Le, le, le...

732
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,195
No.

733
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,715
No way. No. You don't mean...

734
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,878
Love each other.

735
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,190
I just threw up a noodle
and swallowed it.

736
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,736
- Here comes the choo-choo train!
- No.

737
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,936
- Choo, choo, chugga, chugga.
- No choo-choo!

738
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,872
Hold the train! No!
It looks like it's already been eaten!

739
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,473
Who's there? I got a racket!

740
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,914
What's going on in here?

741
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,718
I'm just feeding the baby.

742
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,828
They're watching.

743
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,154
Choo-choo.

744
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,111
Okay.

745
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,589
Choo-choo on that.

746
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,799
I don't wear nautical.
It's not even Friday!

747
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,598
Come on, you're putting this thing on!

748
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,876
You gonna make me?
You can't make me, punk.

749
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,160
- What have you done to me?
- Stop!

750
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,633
- Get back here!
- No!

751
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
No way.

752
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Come on!

753
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,952
Tim, what are you doing in here?

754
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
Oh, no.

755
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,320
Hey, what's all the racket?

756
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,553
Isn't he adorable?

757
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,717
I've got one for you, too! Ahoy, matey!

758
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,710
What?

759
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,630
Bummer.

760
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,835
Smile!

761
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,592
Smile for the camera.

762
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,478
It makes me feel weak.

763
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,676
- Who's ticklish?
- It doesn't work on me.

764
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,000
- Here?
- I'm dead down there.

765
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,872
Come on, everyone has a tickle spot.

766
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,230
"'I don't think I'll fit, ' said Gretel."

767
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,956
Come here, look at this.

768
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,151
"'I could get in myself.'

769
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,912
"And then, Hansel and Gretel...

770
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,554
"pushed the wicked old woman
into the oven.

771
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,269
"And the godless witch
was miserably burnt to death."

772
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,068
Let me get this straight.

773
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,357
The story is about cannibalism
and burning people alive.

774
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,270
Yeah.

775
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,476
No wonder kids are so messed up!

776
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,830
Getting along is exhausting.

777
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Back at ya, Tim.

778
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,071
You should have seen your face
in that picture.

779
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,275
You were all...

780
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,672
I'm not used to being tickled.

781
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,434
Once at a corporate retreat.
But those things always get weird.

782
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,876
What? You've never been tickled?
What about your parents?

783
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,833
I'm sorry. I forgot.

784
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,868
You didn't have parents, did you?

785
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,435
Tim, I may look like a baby...

786
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,956
but I was born all grown up.

787
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,828
I can't even imagine not being a kid.

788
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,195
You missed out on your whole childhood?

789
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,875
You never had someone to love you?

790
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,155
You can't miss what you never had.

791
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,598
Wake up, little halflings!

792
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,512
Hey, Tim. Wake up, buddy.

793
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,432
- What?
- Rise and shine!

794
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,953
Is something wrong? Am I fired?

795
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,953
No, you're late for work.

796
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,950
What?

797
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,190
It's Take Your Kid to Work Day!
And you're the kid.

798
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,112
You're officially un-grounded.

799
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,633
- Really?
- Really.

800
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,474
Can the baby come, too?

801
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,789
I don't see why not.

802
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,269
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

803
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,796
Yeah!

804
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,552
I wish I was that excited for work.

805
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,119
Look, it's my spatula.

806
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,154
Yeah, baby.

807
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,509
All right, gentlemen.
Welcome to Puppy Co.

808
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,557
Wow! This is awesome!

809
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
And Tim, look!

810
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,118
They have a puppy pool and everything!

811
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,508
Isn't that sanitary?

812
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,069
Hey, bud, you wanna get a picture
with Puppy Co Pete?

813
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,349
No, thanks.
It's probably too scary for the baby.

814
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Nice call.

815
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,036
Your dad and I
have some work to do.

816
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,555
You wanna come up to the office
and hang out with us?

817
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,551
We'll stick your brother
in the Puppy Zone...

818
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,551
while we have a little Tim time.

819
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Tim time?

820
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,476
Dad and I know we haven't been able
to do as much with you as we used to.

821
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,232
So, what do you say?

822
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
No, thanks.

823
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,952
I'd rather spend time with the baby.

824
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,679
- So cute.
- That's so sweet.

825
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,880
Way to keep your eyes on the prize,
Templeton.

826
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,634
We find out what the new puppy is,
and I go home.

827
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,237
You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?

828
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,913
Okay, bye!

829
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,840
That's where we'll find
the secret file on the new puppy.

830
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,399
We'll never get through that door.

831
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,959
No, not that door.

832
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,595
The doggy door.

833
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,956
But how do we get past the guard?

834
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,315
No, no, no.
No way.

835
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
No!

836
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,108
Itchy, plushy, puppy pants!

837
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,789
What a cute, little pup...

838
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,960
Ow!

839
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,630
Yay!

840
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
Kids.

841
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,959
Get down.

842
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,637
All the way down.

843
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,318
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life.

844
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,480
Arf!

845
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Hey!

846
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,555
Fetch!

847
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,152
What am I doing?

848
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,640
Oh, no!

849
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,520
Yes!

850
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,520
What a good boy.

851
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,399
No. No biting.

852
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,668
Timothy Templeton, office ninja.

853
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,837
- Over here.
- What is it?

854
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,159
It's gotta be in here.

855
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,159
It's begging us to go in.

856
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Wow.

857
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,597
That's a lot of paperwork.

858
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,037
I thought puppies shredded everything.

859
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,072
This is getting creepy.

860
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,838
I've come for your soul.

861
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Cut it out!

862
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,234
Wait!

863
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,589
That's it!

864
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,760
The file!

865
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,518
See! I was right.

866
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,353
No. I've seen this before somewhere.

867
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,556
We've gotta find something
to replace it with.

868
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,597
You're right. Like another file.

869
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,233
Yes! A file with the same weight.

870
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,630
So it can be placed
in the exact same position.

871
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,920
- With the exact same weight.
- You already said that.

872
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,753
I know I said it. Hey, you hit me twice.

873
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,638
Make it a third time. Wait!

874
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,358
I think I've seen one here.

875
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,029
Smead manila, pressboard edges.

876
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,430
About 50 ounces. No, 49.

877
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
Try this one.

878
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
Wait!

879
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,275
Now it's perfect.

880
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
Yes!

881
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,478
I feel like we should run.

882
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,359
I know, but it's just so mesmerizing.

883
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,439
I kind of wanna see how it ends.

884
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,600
Yeah, me too.

885
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,632
Well, that didn't end well.

886
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,549
What?

887
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,840
What the...?

888
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,191
Thanks for dropping in, kids.

889
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,793
Francis Francis?

890
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,269
I see you've met my big brother, Eugene.

891
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,993
A man of few words.

892
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,989
None, in fact.

893
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,628
Can you put your head back on, please?

894
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,353
What is all this?

895
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,794
Surprise!

896
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,679
A Baby Corp binky?
Where did you get that?

897
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,237
You don't recognize me?

898
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,233
Perhaps from my youth!

899
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,151
Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?

900
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,353
He is him? And him is you?

901
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,353
Except older and wrinklier.

902
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,148
That's not right.

903
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,311
No. You were my hero!

904
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,238
How did you end up here?

905
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,077
You know what I do to little kids
who ask lots of questions about me?

906
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,514
Eugene!

907
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,231
I read them my story.

908
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,711
And, I baked cookies!

909
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,433
Eugene, my chair.

910
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,276
Now, it all started at Baby Corp...

911
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,874
a long, long time ago.

912
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,349
I was a hotshot executive...

913
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,238
headed straight to the top.

914
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,709
Everyone loved me.

915
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,189
They gave me a promotion,
the corner office...

916
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,713
my very own...

917
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,949
Personal potty?

918
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,916
I had it all.

919
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,080
But then one day...

920
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,396
I made a terrible discovery.

921
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,790
I was getting old.

922
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,712
The formula wasn't working anymore.

923
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,077
It turns out I was lactose intolerant.

924
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,429
- No!
- Yes!

925
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,558
I got called in
to see the board of directors.

926
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,119
Who are the boring directors?

927
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,714
The biggest baby bosses of them all.

928
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,598
I thought they loved me.

929
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,399
But they replaced me with someone new.

930
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,599
Someone younger.

931
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,079
That's horrible.

932
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,959
All of a sudden, she got all the love...

933
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,792
all the attention.

934
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,793
You know how that feels, don't you, Tim?

935
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,791
It hurts, doesn't it?

936
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,995
Yeah. It does.

937
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,199
And then what happened?

938
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,880
Well...

939
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,633
They fired me!

940
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,873
And took away my special formula.

941
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,952
Then they sent me down to live with a...

942
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,318
- family!
- Oh, Francis, no!

943
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,152
Baby Corp betrayed me!

944
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,676
And I'm finally going to get revenge...

945
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,910
with the Forever Puppy.

946
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,229
- Huh?
- That's it?

947
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
No, no.

948
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,670
Imagine a puppy that never grows up.

949
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,555
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

950
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,150
Once I launch my Forever Puppies
to every corner of the world...

951
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,839
they'll be so adorable...

952
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,319
How cute!

953
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,196
...no one will ever want a baby
ever, ever again.

954
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,148
The end of Baby Corp!

955
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,389
Please.

956
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,358
A puppy that never grows up?
That's impossible!

957
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Isn't it?

958
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,876
It was, until you brought me
the key ingredient.

959
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,717
My secret formula.

960
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,672
It's mine! It's mine!

961
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,677
It's all mine.

962
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,517
No!

963
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,389
You brought me the very thing I needed
to destroy Baby Corp.

964
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,913
- No!
- Yes!

965
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,078
You walked right into my trap!

966
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,216
- You'll never get away with this!
- Yeah, not if we...

967
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,719
What? Tell?

968
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,075
Who are you gonna tell, Tim?
Your parents?

969
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Where are the boys?

970
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,078
I told them to stay in the Puppy Zone.

971
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,390
I'm taking them both with me
to Las Vegas.

972
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,551
So stay out of my way.

973
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,269
I'd hate for them to get terminated.

974
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,279
They'd never leave us alone.

975
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,475
Oh, really?

976
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,874
Wait until they meet
Puppy Co's certified...

977
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,231
in-house childcare expert.

978
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,313
Oh, no.

979
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,550
- Don't be nervous, buddy.
- It's only overnight.

980
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,080
We'll be back before you know it.

981
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,310
Besides, you boys are in great hands.

982
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,114
That's right!

983
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,795
Eugenia is practically
perfect in every way.

984
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,756
No.

985
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,753
Please don't go with him.
Francis Francis is trying to...

986
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,069
Believe me...

987
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,919
Eugenia won't take her eyes
off your children.

988
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,150
Not for one second.

989
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,992
That's very reassuring.

990
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,431
Now you see them.

991
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,190
And now, you don't.

992
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,475
Too-da-loo!

993
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,108
To the airport!

994
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,870
It's over. I'm through.

995
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,155
What do we do, Templeton?

996
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
What do we do?

997
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,755
We have to get to the airport
and stop Francis Francis...

998
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,353
before the plane takes off!

999
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,318
Yes! But how do we get past
Scary Poppins down there?

1000
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,357
Okay. There must be something we can do.

1001
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,673
Hey, it's not that bad.

1002
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,360
Are you okay?

1003
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,749
What's the matter with you?

1004
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,999
Don't look at me!

1005
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Oh, no!

1006
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,151
Without that formula,
I turn into a normal baby.

1007
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,959
You know, goo-goo, ga-ga.
The whole bit!

1008
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
Oh, no!

1009
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Gross!

1010
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,314
I'm a ticking baby time bomb!

1011
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,917
I'm going to turn into a puking,
pooping, helpless baby!

1012
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,073
Wait a second. That gives me an idea.

1013
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,355
What? What is it?

1014
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,556
I've been through
a lot of babysitters...

1015
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,915
and they all fear one thing.

1016
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,997
Now, ladies,
the secret to deep fried butter...

1017
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,720
is a healthy dab of margarine.

1018
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,832
Hey, Mr. Lady Man!

1019
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,557
The baby. I think he's sick!

1020
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,718
You gotta do something!

1021
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,958
Oh, the horror!

1022
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,996
- Templeton!
- Delicious!

1023
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,719
Gross! It got in your mouth!

1024
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,397
It got in my mouth, too!

1025
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,119
I think I'm gonna be sick!

1026
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,880
Swirly!

1027
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,796
There's only an hour
before the plane takes off.

1028
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,389
Let's take the bike.

1029
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,754
The bike?

1030
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,714
I don't know.

1031
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,036
Let's move!

1032
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,416
- Okay, but wait right here!
- What?

1033
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,839
Where are you going? Templeton!

1034
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,399
Always wear a helmet.

1035
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,398
Too-da-loo, toilet head!

1036
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,588
You'll never catch us!

1037
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,680
Staci!

1038
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,914
Staci, come in!

1039
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,073
Oh, Staci!

1040
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,958
- Is that you, boss?
- Code red!

1041
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,429
I'm being chased by a killer babysitter!
Gather the team!

1042
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
On it, boss.

1043
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,876
- Hello!
- Hello!

1044
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,268
- Hello!
- Code red.

1045
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,440
Got it!

1046
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,834
We got a code red. Repeat...

1047
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,194
We got a code red!

1048
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,512
What are you doing, Templeton? Go, go!

1049
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,795
But that's jaywalking!

1050
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,080
Here, I'll pay your ticket.

1051
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,160
Go!

1052
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,229
I think we lost him!

1053
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,472
Oh, no, we didn't!

1054
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,959
Flower power!

1055
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,913
Pow, pow, pow!

1056
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,360
That's my boy!

1057
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,388
Poppy!

1058
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,708
Run, run, run.

1059
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,276
Uh-oh.

1060
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,913
Run, run, run.

1061
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,152
Tim, you've gotta go faster!

1062
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,639
I can't do it!

1063
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,068
You can.

1064
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,310
You've got it in you, Templeton.
Now, eyes ahead.

1065
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,708
I said eyes ahead, son!

1066
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,030
Buttocks up! Now pedal like you mean it!

1067
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,237
Either you run the day,
or the day runs you.

1068
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,920
Good!

1069
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,629
Uh-oh!

1070
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,109
My training wheels!
I can't ride without training wheels!

1071
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,397
Whether you think you can
or you think you can't, you're right!

1072
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,709
What are you talking about?

1073
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,440
The path to success
is not a straight line, Templeton...

1074
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,079
but rather a wild ride...

1075
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,280
like a ship at sea.

1076
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,719
And you're a sea captain...

1077
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,598
taming a turbulent ocean!

1078
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,270
I'm a sea captain, taming the ocean!

1079
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,070
Good!

1080
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,912
Tree! I'm gonna hit it!

1081
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,036
Aim for failure,
and you'll always succeed.

1082
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,599
- What?
- Aim away from failure!

1083
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,792
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1084
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,871
Once success is a habit...

1085
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,359
then it's all downhill.

1086
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Look!

1087
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,719
There they are!
Mom, Dad!

1088
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,160
- Train!
- Choo-choo!

1089
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,080
Stop!

1090
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,353
What are you doing?

1091
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,960
- We're gonna make it.
- But I don't have a quote for this!

1092
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,709
You did it!

1093
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,836
No! We did it.

1094
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,475
And all without your training wheels.

1095
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,395
Coming through!

1096
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,709
Baby on board!

1097
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,995
Hang on to your diaper!

1098
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,799
Duck and cover!

1099
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,589
Hold it, buddy!

1100
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,352
I'm gonna need a strip search on two.

1101
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,991
There they are! Mom, Dad!

1102
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,229
Hey, not so fast!

1103
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
Oh, no.

1104
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,549
Templeton!

1105
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,153
- Hey!
- Sorry!

1106
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,555
Hey, where'd you go?

1107
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,670
Oh, no!

1108
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,955
Not again!

1109
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,269
Not now!

1110
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,835
What the...?

1111
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,316
No, no, no!

1112
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,635
Come on!

1113
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,631
I think I ate $1.75.

1114
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,031
Excuse me, coming through! Mom, Dad!

1115
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,915
Hurry now! Move!

1116
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,256
We don't wanna miss our flight!

1117
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,872
- No!
- I warned you!

1118
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Wait!

1119
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,468
- No!
- No.

1120
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,437
Mom, Dad! Stop!

1121
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,400
No!

1122
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,151
No, no, no.

1123
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,958
They're gone.

1124
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,669
I failed.

1125
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,072
I would've gotten to my parents
if I didn't have to go back for you!

1126
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,595
What? We would have been here
in plenty of time...

1127
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,680
if you knew how to ride a bike
like a normal kid!

1128
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,956
We're never going to stop the launch
on time.

1129
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,236
Who cares? My parents are in danger.

1130
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,000
I care! Baby Corp is going to go
out of business.

1131
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,040
That's all you ever talk about.

1132
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,634
You don't even know what it's like
to be part of a family.

1133
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,680
And you don't know what it's like
to have a job!

1134
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,311
You don't know anything about hugs,
or bedtime stories, or special songs!

1135
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,948
Oh, please! Stop acting like a baby.

1136
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,120
You're a baby!

1137
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,869
You take that back.

1138
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,110
My life was perfect until you showed up!

1139
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,431
Believe me, kid, the feeling is mutual.
I wish I'd never met you!

1140
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,113
I wish you'd never been born!

1141
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,553
Where are you going?

1142
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,040
Fine!

1143
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,830
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1144
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,833
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

1145
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,235
All your life

1146
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,994
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

1147
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,676
Would Timothy Templeton please pick up
the white courtesy phone?

1148
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,516
Timothy Leslie Templeton,
please pick up the white courtesy phone.

1149
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,079
Leslie.

1150
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,670
Hello?

1151
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,990
It's me. Don't hang up, Tim!

1152
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,549
Tim, I wasn't born. I was hired.

1153
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,994
What do you mean?

1154
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,668
Baby Corp is the only home I've ever known.

1155
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,669
So you're right.
I don't know what it's like...

1156
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,199
to be part of a family.

1157
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,953
But I do care.

1158
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,189
You do?

1159
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,509
Yeah.

1160
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,633
And the only way to save both
is to stop Francis Francis.

1161
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,630
Yeah.

1162
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,631
I can't do this without you, Tim.

1163
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,119
I need you.

1164
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,033
- I guess we do make a pretty good team.
- No.

1165
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,477
Literally, I can't reach the door knobs.

1166
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,868
Oh, right.

1167
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,953
Don't worry, Tim.

1168
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,792
We're gonna save your parents.

1169
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,232
And your company.

1170
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,757
But how do we get to Vegas now?

1171
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,070
We're gonna need a miracle.

1172
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,594
Follow that Elvis!

1173
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,800
Why?

1174
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,998
Where there's Elvis, there's Vegas!

1175
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,229
There's another one!

1176
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,389
And another one!

1177
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,228
Elvises everywhere!

1178
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,671
Tim, there's our flight!

1179
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,308
And there goes our ticket!

1180
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,759
Hey! Don't be cruel!

1181
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,069
Sorry!

1182
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,079
- Well, thank you!
- Oh, baby!

1183
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,474
Well, thank you very much.

1184
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,640
Hello.

1185
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,918
Hi.

1186
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,838
Ticket please.

1187
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,279
One moment.

1188
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,589
It's been stolen!

1189
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,075
Impersonating an Elvis impersonator?

1190
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:27,791
Get him!

1191
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,875
Humina, humina, humina.

1192
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,280
Stop!

1193
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,269
The ghost of Elvis!

1194
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,835
We gotta find seats!

1195
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,115
Come on, this way!

1196
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,634
What is this place?

1197
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,997
This, Templeton, is first class.

1198
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,315
Why is it empty?

1199
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,799
No one can afford it.

1200
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,077
That's what makes it so wonderful.

1201
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,631
Hello! This is Captain Ross.

1202
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
and those in coach...

1203
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,912
please fasten your seat belts.
We're about to take off.

1204
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,519
What's the matter, Templeton?

1205
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,313
My parents always hold my hand
during takeoff.

1206
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,594
Boy, the stocks are crazy today.

1207
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,077
Ladies and gentlemen,
Captain Ross again.

1208
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,336
As you can see,
I've switched off the seat belt sign.

1209
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,271
What are you two boys doi ng up here?

1210
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,512
We're Captain Ross's kids.

1211
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,033
He told us to sit here.

1212
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,393
Well, can I get you special guys anything?

1213
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,560
Anything?

1214
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,073
Anything.

1215
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,951
Aye! All right, Francis Francis.

1216
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,759
This will teach you
to kidnap the parents of One-Eyed Tim.

1217
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,110
Oh, please. If only it were that easy.

1218
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,554
What's your plan?

1219
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,280
You're not gonna write a memo, are you?

1220
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,560
No.

1221
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,161
Come on. You said you never really
had a childhood, right?

1222
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,389
Why don't you give it a try?

1223
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,879
- No, I can't.
- It's fun!

1224
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,758
Here, let's get you into character.

1225
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,399
I don't know. I feel silly!

1226
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,312
Go on! Say something mean to him.

1227
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,760
All right, all right, all right.

1228
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,236
So, you went to a community college, is it?

1229
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,230
I don't know.

1230
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,230
Keep going!

1231
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,995
And you have the guts
to ask me for a bonus, now?

1232
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,550
See!

1233
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,119
Now you're getting into it.

1234
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,280
Huh?

1235
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,231
Well, blow me down.

1236
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,550
Your exit interview is over!

1237
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,155
That was pretty good.

1238
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,600
Who was that guy anyway?

1239
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,318
- The captain!
- What?

1240
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,320
En garde!

1241
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Heave!

1242
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,640
Ho!

1243
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,675
Thar she blows!

1244
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,599
Watch your stern!

1245
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,000
- Aye!
- Dodge, parry, and thrust!

1246
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,513
Sounds like a heck of a law firm!

1247
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,636
Nice try!
Heads up!

1248
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,792
You're fired!

1249
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,428
And here's your severance package. Ha!

1250
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,108
Wait. You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

1251
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,280
You're not?

1252
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,791
You're supposed to end with "Argh!"

1253
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,313
Got it! Argh!

1254
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,560
That's great!

1255
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,477
Thanks! I just went with the flow.

1256
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
and those in coach...

1257
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,313
on the left side of the plane...

1258
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,950
you can see we're approaching
fabulous Las Vegas.

1259
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,869
Land ho!

1260
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,479
Ahoy, matey.

1261
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,520
Bye, Dad! Thanks for the lift!

1262
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,153
- Okay. What?
- Let's move.

1263
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,496
- Going to the Heartbreak Hotel?
- I'm going to the Heartbreak Hotel.

1264
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,520
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

1265
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,600
Me, too!

1266
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,598
We've gotta get to the convention center.

1267
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,034
Should we get a taxi?

1268
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,431
Darn! I spent all my per diem.
That's more our speed.

1269
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,880
Right.

1270
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,871
Excuse me, ladies.

1271
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,839
Can we get a ride home?

1272
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,515
Jimmy's been sick,
and he needs his expensive medicine.

1273
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,273
Where do you live, sweetie?

1274
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,954
The convention center.

1275
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,433
Bye, sweetie!

1276
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,033
Have a fun lady party!

1277
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,633
Chicks dig babies.

1278
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,273
The people of Long Island do not know
how to make an iced tea.

1279
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,031
Oh, no! How are we gonna find my parents
in here?

1280
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,950
Tim!

1281
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,120
Over there.

1282
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,879
Okay, now where's Puppy Co?

1283
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,031
Puppy Co, Puppy Co, Puppy Co...

1284
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,952
Aha! Here it is. Found it!

1285
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,628
But how did you...?

1286
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,071
Hey! Where'd you go?

1287
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Not again!

1288
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,237
Come on! I need you!

1289
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,314
I'm back! I'm back.

1290
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,914
What's going on?

1291
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,080
That's right.

1292
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,119
We're gonna launch a brand new puppy
in every continent.

1293
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,952
In every country!

1294
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,796
We're going to take over the world,
one heart at a time.

1295
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,750
- Tim, there they are!
- Mom, Dad!

1296
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,070
Imagine a puppy that never grows up...

1297
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,157
never gets old.

1298
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,992
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

1299
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,434
I give you the only thing
you'll ever love...

1300
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,034
the Forever Puppy!

1301
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,120
Mommy?

1302
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,119
Avert your eyes, Templeton!

1303
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,359
Hey! What are you doing here?

1304
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,436
Mom, Dad!

1305
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,959
What are they doing here?

1306
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,792
What are Tim and the baby doing here?

1307
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,269
What are any of us doing here, really?

1308
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,198
What is going on here?

1309
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,720
He's got my parents!

1310
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,631
We're really here to get them.

1311
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,550
Get them!

1312
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,995
Get the Forever Puppy!

1313
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,548
We've got to get backstage.

1314
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,629
In there!

1315
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Run!

1316
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,673
Go, go, go!

1317
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,514
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!

1318
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
Yes!

1319
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,830
Fart. Poop. Doodie.

1320
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,069
Look at all that formula.

1321
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,991
Now that's how you launch a product.

1322
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,200
Oh, no!

1323
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,512
He's putting them under the rocket!

1324
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,875
Elvis has left the building!

1325
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,559
Mom, Dad...

1326
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,760
I'm coming!

1327
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,916
Atta boy! Go, Tim! Go, go!

1328
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,189
Launch initiated.

1329
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,439
I'm launching my Forever Puppies,
and there's nothing you can do about it!

1330
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,760
No!

1331
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,480
Baby Corp stole all the love from me...

1332
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,790
and now I'm going to
take it back from them.

1333
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,760
You should understand
what I'm talking about.

1334
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,992
You got replaced just like me!

1335
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,718
No! I'm nothing like you!

1336
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,880
Bratty kid!

1337
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,594
Let our parents go!
His parents. The parents.

1338
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,760
Yeah!

1339
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,280
You could have had your parents' love
all to yourself again!

1340
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,230
But no!

1341
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,400
You blew it!

1342
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,796
You let that baby boss you around.

1343
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,995
He doesn't work for me.

1344
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,559
We're partners!

1345
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,273
I'm not ticklish.

1346
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,154
Hey! Where's the baby?

1347
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,753
Everyone has a tickle spot!

1348
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,670
My ears!

1349
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,159
Stop it!

1350
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,988
Little brats!

1351
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,990
Nothing is going to get in the way
of my vengeance.

1352
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,952
Not you, not anybody!

1353
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,639
Baby Corp is through.

1354
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,279
I win! Ha!

1355
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,440
Wrong!

1356
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,197
You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

1357
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,271
- That's right!
- What?

1358
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,112
You're supposed to end with...

1359
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,429
Argh!

1360
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,315
En garde!

1361
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,630
You're fired!

1362
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,791
And here's your severance package!

1363
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,632
Take that, you scurvy scallywag!

1364
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,516
Argh!

1365
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,477
One minute and counting.

1366
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,314
- Help!
- Anybody!

1367
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,073
Tim! What are you doing?

1368
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,840
No!

1369
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,713
Mom, Dad, I'm coming!

1370
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,995
Is that you?

1371
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,231
Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I got this!

1372
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,960
- Are you okay?
- Is the baby all right?

1373
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,040
Yes, the baby's fine.

1374
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,309
Who was that?

1375
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,993
That was me!

1376
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,229
The baby's fine.

1377
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,154
It won't budge!

1378
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,469
What's happening?

1379
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,720
Wait a second!

1380
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,149
Hey.

1381
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,673
I know a way to move my parents.

1382
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,080
- How?
- We can use the puppies!

1383
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,600
Upsies.

1384
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,149
I need upsies.

1385
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,753
But what if you "go baby" again?

1386
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,990
It'll be fine.
Fine, fine.

1387
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,160
Fine!

1388
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,553
It'll be fine.

1389
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,153
Hang on to your diaper!

1390
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,029
We're moving!

1391
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,428
Why are we moving?

1392
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,033
All right, Mom and Dad, hang on!

1393
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,191
T-minus 30 seconds.

1394
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,793
Oh, no! Wait!

1395
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,435
Hold on!

1396
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,874
Go, Tim! Get your parents...

1397
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,509
out of here.

1398
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,914
You've gotta jump!

1399
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,072
Come on, it's a piece of cake!

1400
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,190
No! No patty cake! Get down!

1401
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,711
Don't cry. I'm sorry.
Please don't cry!

1402
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,629
20 seconds.

1403
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,557
15 seconds.

1404
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,914
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1405
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,154
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

1406
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,117
All your life

1407
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,275
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

1408
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,949
- Three...
- Gotcha!

1409
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,031
...two, one.

1410
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,235
Blast off!

1411
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,280
Y eah!

1412
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,071
Hey, are you still in there?

1413
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,760
Aha!

1414
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,239
What happened? Did we win?

1415
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,230
- We won!
- We won?

1416
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,119
- We won, we won, we won!
- We won! Yes!

1417
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,795
Victory nap!

1418
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,549
You ruined everything!

1419
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,031
It's not fair! It's not fair!

1420
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,235
That's not right.

1421
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,712
Now you're really going to pay!

1422
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,838
Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone
your own size!

1423
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,840
What?

1424
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,437
Eugene! You put me down!

1425
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,431
You hear me? I am the boss of you!

1426
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,800
This time, we'll raise him right.

1427
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,069
I'm sure that's gonna turn out fine.

1428
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,828
Tim, what's happening?

1429
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,592
Mom, Dad, hold on!

1430
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,995
Yes!

1431
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,834
- Tim?
- Tim!

1432
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,513
Tim! Are you okay?

1433
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,749
I'm fine. We're fine.

1434
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,920
You saved us.

1435
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,354
You're our hero.

1436
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,919
And a great big brother.

1437
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,156
We love you both so much.

1438
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,435
Both of us?

1439
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,238
With all our heart.

1440
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,118
Let's go home.

1441
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,359
How do I look?

1442
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,999
You look great.

1443
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,391
Well, team, good job.

1444
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,996
Staci, this letter should get you
into the school of your choice.

1445
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,357
- Kindergarten?
- That's right.

1446
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,873
And if there's anything else...

1447
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,040
How about a raise?

1448
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,394
Staci, you don't get paid.

1449
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,936
- One million ziggity-five!
- Eight!

1450
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,960
- A tricycle!
- Skates!

1451
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,796
- Candy corn?
- Lollipop!

1452
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Deal.

1453
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,518
Best boss ever.

1454
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,319
And you guys don't always have to
toe the company line, you know?

1455
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,760
It's okay to think for yourself.

1456
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,750
- No, sir!
- No way!

1457
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,035
That's a terrible idea!

1458
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,553
That's the attitude.

1459
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,976
- You're so right!
- You've got it, sir!

1460
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,200
- You're the man!
- Absolutely!

1461
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,908
Here you go, big guy.

1462
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,234
You've earned it.

1463
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,593
You wanna hug me, don't you?

1464
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,355
I'll miss you too, buddy. Okay.

1465
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,590
- There, there.
- It'll be okay, big guy.

1466
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,080
So...

1467
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,440
you did it.

1468
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,750
No. We did it.

1469
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,671
By the way,
congratulations on your promotion.

1470
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,668
The corner office, the private potty.
All that stuff.

1471
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,359
But, hey! How about you?

1472
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,590
You have your parents all to yourself.

1473
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,438
So what am I gonna tell Mom and Dad
after you leave?

1474
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,640
Don't worry.

1475
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,234
Baby Corp has a procedure
for situations like this.

1476
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,273
It'll be like I was never born.

1477
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,754
I almost forgot!

1478
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,117
No way! Lam-Lam!

1479
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,799
- You fixed her.
- Yep.

1480
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,315
She's as good as new.
She's a tough one.

1481
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,314
Well, I guess we both got what we wanted.

1482
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,959
It's a win-win.

1483
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,115
Probably should...

1484
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,280
Yeah.

1485
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,400
So, stay in school.

1486
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,636
I don't really have a choice.

1487
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,800
Yeah, right.

1488
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,991
- Goodbye, Tim.
- Bye.

1489
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,118
Yeah, right.

1490
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,831
He left as suddenly as he arrived.

1491
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,070
Bye.

1492
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,477
Finally, my life was perfect again.

1493
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,476
Forget about the baby.

1494
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,160
Oopsies!

1495
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,508
Pardon me, big fella.

1496
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,794
Surprise!

1497
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,952
Hooray!

1498
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,474
Forget about the baby?

1499
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,438
No, thanks. I'm good.

1500
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,114
Okie-dokie.

1501
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,909
Argh.

1502
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,559
Dear Boss Baby...

1503
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,551
I don't usually write very much...

1504
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,757
but now I know
that memos are very important things.

1505
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,195
Even though I never went
to business school...

1506
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,555
I did learn to share in kindergarten.

1507
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,439
And if there isn't enough love
for the two of us...

1508
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,955
then I wanna give you all of mine.

1509
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,392
I would like to offer you a job.

1510
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,675
It will be hard work...

1511
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,876
and there will be no pay.

1512
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,717
But the good news is that
you can never be fired.

1513
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,958
And I promise you this.

1514
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,119
Every morning when you wake up,
I will be there.

1515
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,589
Every night at dinner, I will be there.

1516
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,268
Every birthday party,
every Christmas morning...

1517
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,634
I will be there.

1518
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,754
Year after year after year.

1519
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,676
We will grow old together.

1520
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,235
And you and I will always...

1521
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,080
...be brothers.

1522
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,680
Always.

1523
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,637
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a m.

1524
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,992
What's the poi nt, Wizzie?

1525
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,435
Because it's 7:00 a.m.

1526
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,319
I have one job to do,
and you make it so difficult.

1527
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,512
It's okay, little halfling.

1528
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,511
Sometimes, I get confused too.

1529
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,240
Especially during daylight savings time.

1530
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,197
Spring forward, fall back.

1531
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,555
We don't even have calendars
in the wizard's realm!

1532
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,269
There is no spring,
only darkness and winter!

1533
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,715
I'm not confused at all, Wizzie.

1534
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,989
I just miss him.

1535
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,632
Tim, look who's here!

1536
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,958
It's your new baby...

1537
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,189
Brother!

1538
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,479
You're here! You're really here!

1539
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,789
Gentle, gentle.

1540
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,951
You came back!

1541
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,871
Say hello to Theodore Lindsey Templeton.

1542
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,360
Lindsey?

1543
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,111
Who's ticklish? Who's ticklish?

1544
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,474
Here you go.

1545
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,755
So, that's my story.

1546
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,668
Our story.

1547
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:52,189
Luckily for me and my little brother,
it had a happy ending.

1548
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,236
Is that a true story, Daddy?

1549
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,635
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.

1550
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,552
- But you know what I found out?
- What?

1551
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,950
There's plenty of love for everyone.

1552
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,120
Even me?

1553
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,713
Especially you.

1554
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,279
Just ask your Uncle Ted.

1555
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,749
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have
a baby sister.

1556
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,194
I wanted a horse.

1557
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,920
Here you go, kid.
Go get yourself a horse.

1558
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,873
You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.

1559
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,672
Back at ya, Lindsey.

1560
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,031
Hi there, baby sister.

1561
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,630
Argh!

1562
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,994
All right, guys.

1563
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,195
Time for bed.

1564
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,470
Come on, Mom.
Just a little longer.

1565
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,914
Okay.

1566
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,636
Wake up, little halflings!
It's time to leave.

1567
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,190
Go and live your peasant lives.

1568
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,719
Be gone with you!
