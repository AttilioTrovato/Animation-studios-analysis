1
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,670
With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,310
A hope that things will be better today
than they were yesterday.

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
But not for me.
My name is Eep.

4
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,437
And this is my family, the Croods.

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,591
If you weren't clued in already by the
animal skins

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
and sloping foreheads,
we're cavemen.

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,991
Most days we spend in our cave,
in the dark.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,676
Night after night, day after day.

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,879
Yep, home sweet home.

10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,830
When we did go out, we struggled to
find food in a harsh and hostile world.

11
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,789
And I struggled to survive my family.

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,951
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,674
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,798
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,195
The Erfs, mosquito bite.

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,035
Throgs, common cold.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,953
And the Croods, that's us.

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,795
The Croods made it, because of my dad.

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,555
He was strong,
and he followed the rules.

20
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,517
The ones painted on the cave walls.

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,194
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,678
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,831
Welcome to my world.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,393
But this is a story about how
all that changed in an instant.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,711
Because what we didn't know
was that our world...

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,394
was about to come to an end.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,839
And there were no rules on our
cave walls to prepare us for that.

28
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,955
You are supposed to wait
for my signal. Eep?

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,193
Boo.

30
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,595
Ow! No!

31
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,957
We've been in that cave forever.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,429
Three days is not forever.

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,033
It is with this family.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,591
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,479
No, Sandy, come back here.

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,514
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,274
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
and you can give the signal.

38
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,118
No, I mean, you're already out now.

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,952
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,315
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,109
But if you don't give the signal,
how do I know you're my dad?

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,958
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,958
It's so you know I wasn't eaten
by an animal.

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,039
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?

45
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,557
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,072
Mom, we're ready to leave.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,433
Mom?

48
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,875
Still alive.

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,439
It's still early.

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,319
And you're still fat.

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,630
Breakfast formation!

52
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,236
I want to see some real caveman action
out there. We do this fast.

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,073
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.

54
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,630
And never not be afraid!

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,436
Yay, breakfast.

56
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,549
Who's up?

57
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,595
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.

58
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,637
Heads!

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,557
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.

60
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,830
Okay. Thunk...

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,399
Go.

62
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,235
Come on, Thunk.

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,550
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.

64
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,032
Release the baby!

65
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,238
Get them, Sandy! Go!

66
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,873
Get them, Mom!

67
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,275
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,028
Thanks.

69
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,514
Eep!

70
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,398
Heads up!

71
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,078
Hey Dad, can we eat now?

72
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,271
Just wait till we get home.

73
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,635
Eep, put on the brakes.

74
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,069
Eep!

75
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,678
- Who is hungry?
- All right! Good one, Dad.

76
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,274
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

77
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,435
- Sorry, Dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight.

78
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,951
That's all right. I ate last week.

79
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,151
Two knuckle warning!

80
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,828
Come on, Croods. Go, go.

81
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,112
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.
We know this.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,468
The moon is full. Bath night.

83
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,029
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.

84
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,430
I don't want to lose
my protective layer.

85
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,192
Mom, you've got ants.

86
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,639
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

87
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,354
Is she still out there?

88
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,670
You know she hates the cave, Grug.

89
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,239
Please come back tomorrow.

90
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,870
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.

91
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,191
It is a little dark, Grug.

92
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,713
It's not that dark.

93
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,229
Eep!

94
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,108
Eep?

95
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,191
Come on, I have to close the cave.

96
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,229
Eep!

97
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,352
Okay, okay.

98
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,078
Come on.

99
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,149
Eep! Come down!

100
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,840
- That was too close.
- I was watching. I was fine.

101
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,230
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.

102
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,038
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.

103
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,838
- Then why did you go up there?
- I don't know.

104
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,632
Why don't you know?

105
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,358
Stop looking for things.

106
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,479
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.

107
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,036
What is the point of all this?

108
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,715
What was that?

109
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,792
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?

110
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,076
No one said survival was fun.

111
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,434
Nothing is fun.

112
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,438
- Would you come down here?
- Grug.

113
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,589
- Eep.
- Grug.

114
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,669
- Yes.
- Off!

115
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,352
- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...
- Off.

116
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,675
I just don't see why
she needs her own ledge, that's all.

117
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,717
- That's what this is about.
- She's working through some things...

118
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,949
and she needs her own space.

119
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,952
What things?
How long is this going to take?

120
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,799
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!

121
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,473
See? She's listening.

122
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,194
If she wants to survive,
she has to follow our rules.

123
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,631
How about a story?
Eep loves those.

124
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,990
That's a good ide...
How about a story, huh?

125
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,832
Yeah, tell us a story.

126
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,990
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

127
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,038
Eep, your old favorite.

128
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,316
I haven't played with that thing in years.

129
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,159
Tonight we'll hear the story
of Krispy Bear.

130
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,351
A long time ago,
this little bear was alive.

131
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,353
She was alive
because she listened to her father...

132
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,751
and lived her life in routine
and darkness and terror.

133
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,717
So she was happy.

134
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,512
But Krispy had one terrible problem.

135
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,673
She was filled with... curiosity.

136
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,558
- Grug.
- Yes. yes.

137
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,871
And one day, while she was in a tree...

138
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,794
the curious little bear
wanted to climb to the top.

139
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,190
And no sooner than
she climbed to the top...

140
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,194
she saw something new and died!

141
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,191
- Just like that?
- Yes!

142
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,558
Her last moments of terror
still frozen on her face.

143
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,199
Same ending as every day.

144
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,868
I get it, Dad. I will never do
anything new or different.

145
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,314
Good man, Thunk.

146
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,553
All right, everyone
sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.

147
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,149
Air.

148
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,799
You talk.

149
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,837
I'm a person, like you.

150
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,515
Sort of like you.

151
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,589
Okay, okay.

152
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,829
Hey, hey, hey!

153
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,353
Would you mind not...

154
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,195
That tickles.

155
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,952
Hey, hey, hey!

156
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,909
Quiet!

157
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm not supposed to be out here.

158
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,989
Eep is gone.

159
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,195
What? Grug!

160
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,475
Stay in the cave.

161
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,836
Wow. You are really strong.

162
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,473
Hey! No! It's mine.

163
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,358
- Please! Wait.
- No!

164
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,238
- It's dying! I can fix it!
- No! I caught it!

165
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,753
Please! Please.

166
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,194
I hate the dark.

167
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,957
Come on, come on, come on.

168
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,555
It does what you tell it?

169
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,029
Yeah. Sort of.

170
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,189
The sun?

171
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,109
No, no, no. Fire.

172
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,635
Hi, fire.

173
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,476
It's not alive.

174
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,517
But you said it was dying.

175
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,589
Sorry.

176
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,998
It comes from where you come from?

177
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,236
No. No, I make it.

178
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,039
- Make some for me.
- Okay.

179
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,075
Make!

180
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,229
It doesn't come out of me.

181
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,197
Make! Make it!

182
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,194
You do this a lot.

183
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,871
Are you dead?

184
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,110
Can I have your fire if you're dead?

185
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,514
Clear!

186
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,518
Hey, those are cold!

187
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,194
You think? Listening shells, activate.

188
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,189
I concur.

189
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,591
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

190
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,031
I don't even know you.

191
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,669
I'm Guy.

192
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,829
Guy?

193
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,594
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.

194
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,918
Also, keeps my pants up.

195
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,993
What are "pants up"?

196
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,479
Who are you?

197
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,109
Eep.

198
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,350
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.

199
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,509
What?

200
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,830
I'm calling it "The End."

201
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,348
How do you know?

202
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,953
I have seen it. It's coming this way.

203
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,590
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.

204
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,909
Fire. Lava.

205
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,308
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...

206
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,669
Believe me, everything we are
standing on will be gone.

207
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,956
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.

208
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,792
It's our only chance.

209
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,714
Come with me.

210
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,269
I can't.

211
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,755
Okay.

212
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,949
Here.

213
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,992
If you survive, call me.

214
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,713
Thank you.

215
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,839
Hello?

216
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,628
Hey!

217
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,789
Dad!

218
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,518
Are you hurt? What took you?

219
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,035
Nothing. I left on my own.

220
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,476
You what?

221
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,756
Dad, let me explain.

222
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,712
You never let me talk.

223
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,711
You're grounded.

224
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,429
Hey!

225
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,475
Eep!

226
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,789
Mom.

227
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,389
Grug! What happened?

228
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,836
You know what, I am so mad right now
that I can't talk to her.

229
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,155
Eep?

230
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,312
You will never believe it.
I found something new.

231
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,389
New!

232
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,669
New is a big problem!

233
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,829
Wait, wait!

234
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,718
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.

235
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,791
- It wasn't bad.
- "New" is always bad.

236
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,359
No. He was nice.

237
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,476
What? Excuse me? He?

238
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,633
I thought he was a warthog,
but then he turned into a boy.

239
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,789
Strange.

240
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,837
Usually it's the reverse.

241
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,349
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...

242
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,994
There was a boy.

243
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,037
Watch. I'm going to call him.

244
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,075
What is wrong with you?

245
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,229
It was dangerous.

246
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,271
It was beautiful!

247
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,550
You want to see dangerous? Here!

248
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,109
My sniffer!

249
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,355
Okay, that's it!

250
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,839
We're going back to the cave...

251
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,514
and you're going to stay in there
until you're older than...

252
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,069
her!

253
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,229
What!

254
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,713
You can't keep me inside forever!

255
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,792
He said this would happen.

256
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,398
Get to the cave!

257
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,269
Go!

258
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,359
Look out!

259
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,669
Stop!

260
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,473
Is everyone okay?

261
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,874
Yes.

262
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,551
Grug, the cave...

263
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,358
it's gone.

264
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,828
No.

265
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,950
You really need to see this.

266
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,469
We should go there!

267
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,712
No. No one is going anywhere.

268
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,670
What else did that boy say?

269
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,509
Grug?

270
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,673
Just go! Just go!

271
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,875
Go!

272
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,358
One, two, three, four, five...

273
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,034
Six.

274
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,791
Where are we?

275
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,110
I don't know. I'm not sure.

276
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,038
Down.

277
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,470
In a lower place.

278
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,916
But one thing is for sure,
we can't go back the way we came.

279
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,590
Sandy? What is it?

280
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,390
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!

281
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,034
We can't be out in the open like this.

282
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,917
We need a cave.

283
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,833
Now, step where I step.

284
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,158
Okay. Stay quiet.

285
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,788
Hopefully, nothing big
knows we're here yet.

286
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,755
Wait.

287
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,274
Okay.

288
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,475
Wait.

289
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,593
Okay.

290
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,829
Wait!

291
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,069
Wait.

292
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,949
Okay.

293
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,189
Wait.

294
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,349
Wait.

295
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,595
So, Dad...

296
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,509
just to be clear, are we looking for
the exact same cave?

297
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,148
If it was me...
I'm just throwing this out there...

298
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,709
if it was me choosing the cave...

299
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,034
I would go with a smaller cave.

300
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,549
Wait.

301
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,429
Dad?

302
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,438
I'll take care of this.

303
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,679
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!

304
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,593
Now you got them right...

305
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,875
Man, they're really...

306
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,393
I'm loving this.

307
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,349
Dad, I got it.

308
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,033
Just stop running into their fists.

309
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,160
Grug, when you're done,
we should get going.

310
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,518
That's right. You can't get past this!

311
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,638
Climb! Climb! Climb!

312
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,675
Cave!

313
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,954
Go! Go!

314
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,715
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.

315
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,998
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!

316
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,878
Okay.

317
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,113
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

318
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,998
And seven...

319
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,470
if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.

320
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,030
It's scared of the dark.

321
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,639
Wait, we're scared of the dark.

322
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,879
Kill circle!

323
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,069
Eep!

324
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,949
Eep!

325
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,478
- Cavies!
- "Cavies"?

326
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,154
Cavemen! Stand back!
They're practically animals.

327
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,914
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah.

328
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,594
The huge primitive teeth?

329
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,029
Yeah.

330
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,758
The excessive body hair.

331
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,354
That one has got a tail.

332
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,469
Yeah.

333
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,233
All right. Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.

334
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,273
No! It won't help.
They're my family.

335
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,429
What?

336
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,359
The sun is in his hands!

337
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,909
No, no. It's "fire."

338
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,394
Where did it come from?

339
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,913
He made it.

340
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,109
Make some for me!

341
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,554
It doesn't come out of him.

342
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,199
Make. Make it!

343
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,114
You're a lot like your daughter.

344
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,793
Great, now he's broken.

345
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,678
It's a baby sun.

346
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,794
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.

347
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,793
Now, we'll all sit here
and wait for the sun to come back.

348
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,349
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave...

349
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,199
and pretend today never happened.

350
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,634
Isn't this fun, Eep?

351
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,074
Eep, don't touch him.

352
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,559
Goodness knows where he's been.

353
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,631
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.

354
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,629
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.

355
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,799
What a cute little guy.

356
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,757
Hey. Stay back.

357
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,751
No, no, no, wait!

358
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,954
It likes me.

359
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,473
Hey! It's biting me!

360
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,035
Thunk! Try hiding from it
in the tall, dry grass!

361
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,676
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.

362
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,829
They're biting me!

363
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,839
More fire babies.

364
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,109
Hi.

365
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,316
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.

366
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,272
Yeah. But I won't let him.

367
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,993
Hold on, son. Come back!

368
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,993
No, stop! Let me go!

369
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,356
Get out! Out! Out!

370
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,397
Eat up, babies!

371
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,071
No, stop touching me!

372
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,189
Die!

373
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,232
I win!

374
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,480
They're not so scary
once you get to know them.

375
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,191
Who are you people?

376
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,759
I'm sorry.

377
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,150
We're the Croods!

378
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,668
And you are?

379
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,429
Guy.

380
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,873
Hi, Guy.

381
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,475
Wow!

382
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,672
It looks like magic.

383
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,070
And smells like food.

384
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,872
No, don't eat it, it's new.

385
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,279
Still alive!

386
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,351
Come on, keep eating.

387
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,632
Hey, where is Guy?

388
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,269
No!

389
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,429
Going somewhere?

390
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,114
The mountain? High ground?
End of the world, remember?

391
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,272
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.

392
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,795
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

393
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,434
The end of the end is still coming.

394
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,716
Eep. Drop it.

395
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,432
We can't let him go!

396
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,797
What if we don't find a
cave before sunset?

397
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,678
What if it takes a few days?

398
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,755
What if the birds come back?

399
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,312
We need his fire, dummy!

400
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,471
Fine. You're staying with us
until we find a cave.

401
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,677
What? No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!

402
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,712
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

403
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,995
I've got a dream...

404
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,236
a mission, a reason to live!

405
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,515
Not anymore.

406
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,352
I've got an idea.

407
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,476
Let's go to that mountain.

408
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,629
It's too far.

409
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,633
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

410
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,229
There are caves on that mountain.

411
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,628
Have you been there?

412
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,875
It's a mountain.

413
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,349
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.

414
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,511
And water. And sticks.

415
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,234
Mom? Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!

416
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,834
Yes. Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.

417
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,149
Crazy sticks. Let's go.

418
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,149
Quiet!

419
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,119
That thing is weird.

420
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,077
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.

421
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,593
That's just Belt.

422
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,919
I've made a decision.

423
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,548
We're going to that mountain.

424
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,230
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.

425
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,072
Just feels right.

426
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,357
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.

427
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,556
I don't think my feet can do that.

428
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,359
I'll never live long enough to get there.

429
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,713
Let's do it.

430
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,596
Come on, just think.

431
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,753
Our whole family packed together
on a long, slow, trip across country?

432
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,831
Days and nights with just each other.

433
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,718
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.

434
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,277
We'll become closer as a family.

435
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,429
Get her off!

436
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,670
If you're not ready to challenge her,
then don't look her in the eye.

437
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,877
Could you keep your big giant arms
on your side of the trail?

438
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,670
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.

439
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,072
Stop shoving,
or I will pull out your tongue!

440
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,390
Do you want me to
turn this family around? Do you?

441
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,233
Because I will
turn this family around so fast!

442
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,038
Dad, I gotta go!

443
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,270
- Come on, you can hold it.
- I don't think so.

444
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,629
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

445
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,915
- I'm touching...
- Gran.

446
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,548
Dad, I still gotta go!

447
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,553
Fine. Just go behind one of those
lumpy things and make it fast.

448
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,871
- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it.

449
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,508
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?

450
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,589
No.

451
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,193
- How about now?
- No.

452
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,594
- Now?
- No.

453
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,669
Now?

454
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,990
I can do this all day long.

455
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,436
No, no, no and still no.

456
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,750
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

457
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,269
Grug, we're all pretty tired!

458
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,793
We'll eat when we get there.

459
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,393
It's taking too long!

460
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,278
I'm grabbing a snack.

461
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,872
Don't do that. He will cut you.

462
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,951
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.

463
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,189
What's a pet?

464
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,112
An animal you don't eat.

465
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,271
We call those "children."

466
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,115
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.

467
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,791
- It's food!
- No, please!

468
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,712
Not that. That!

469
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,799
Food fixes everything.

470
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,473
Show me your hunting face.

471
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,473
Not you. You're still grounded.

472
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,959
Come on, Thunk.

473
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,758
My feet hurt.

474
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,832
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.

475
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,472
Angry girl wants to be doing
what they're doing.

476
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,474
I wasn't ready.

477
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,512
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!

478
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,518
Why are you doing this?

479
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,994
What are they doing?

480
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,354
Hunting.

481
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,511
Get it off! You stay away from me.

482
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,829
No, seriously, what are they doing?

483
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,992
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.

484
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,031
Now you're just rubbing it in.

485
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,477
There, who's hungry for scorpion?

486
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,108
What happened to the egg and the bird?

487
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,869
We lost him.

488
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,679
But when the bird stepped on me
and pushed me into the ground...

489
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,910
the scorpion grabbed a hold of me...

490
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,389
and one thing led to another
and here we are eating him.

491
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,595
So, win-win.

492
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,399
Not enough. Not enough!
I need more.

493
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,358
I need more.

494
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,399
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?

495
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,549
You're too skinny.

496
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,756
If she was going to eat anyone
it would be...

497
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,555
Mom!

498
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,232
She's locked her jaw!

499
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,197
Get a stick! Get a stick!

500
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,234
Stay away!

501
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,198
You sick old monster!

502
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,157
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

503
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,312
Hold her still. Use a rock.

504
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,355
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?

505
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,754
Why are you rolling away?

506
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,911
I just want something to eat.

507
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,231
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!

508
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,429
Please.

509
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,833
I'll let you help me hunt.

510
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,069
Really?

511
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,348
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.

512
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,033
Tell my story.

513
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,193
Okay.

514
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,349
What do you call this?

515
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,714
A trap.

516
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,035
What does it do?

517
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,189
Well...

518
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,116
How long have you been alone?

519
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,554
So, what do we do?

520
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,438
How's your acting?

521
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,314
You're good at this.

522
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,119
No. Sorry.

523
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,429
Okay.

524
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,312
- Yeah, that's yours.
- Excuse me.

525
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,999
Your other hand...

526
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,549
- That's my arm.
- Okay, I'm moving it.

527
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,713
Going under.

528
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,636
It didn't step in your trapything.

529
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,234
Yeah, I noticed!

530
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,635
Where's Eep?

531
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,798
She's awesome.

532
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,189
Eep!

533
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,955
Dad, no!

534
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,596
It's an avalanche of flavor.

535
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,511
Looks like we won't be
having any leftovers.

536
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,591
What are "left overs"?

537
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,910
When you have so much food to eat,
you have some left over.

538
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,590
We never have that much food.

539
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,196
Grug, how about a story?

540
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,715
That's a good idea. How about a story?

541
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,151
Yeah, tell us a story!

542
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,355
Once upon a time,
there was a little tiger...

543
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,080
who lived in a cave with her family.

544
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,434
There were a lot of rules...

545
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,555
but the big, simple one
was to never leave the cave at night.

546
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,510
And the door was so heavy,
you'd think it would be easy to remember.

547
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,954
So easy to remember!

548
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,348
I know.

549
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,435
But, while everyone was asleep...

550
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,953
she went out anyway.

551
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,593
- No!
- Yes!

552
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,513
And no sooner than she did,
their cave was destroyed...

553
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,274
and everyone had to go
on this long, sucky walk...

554
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,192
with some weirdo they met...

555
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,793
and die!

556
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,034
The end.

557
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,716
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.

558
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,472
My stories never end like that.

559
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,477
Yes! Two stories in one night!

560
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,235
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.

561
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,198
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful tiger.

562
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,272
She lived in a cave
with the rest of her family.

563
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,194
Her father and mother told her,
"You may go anywhere you want...

564
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,909
"but never go near the cliff,
for you could fall."

565
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,640
And die. Good story.

566
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,271
But when no one was looking...

567
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,789
she'd go near the cliff...

568
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,871
for the closer she came to the edge...

569
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,476
the more she could hear,
the more she could see...

570
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,551
the more she could feel.

571
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,954
Finally...

572
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,317
she stood at the very edge.

573
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,232
She saw a light.

574
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,472
She leaned out to touch it...

575
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,189
and she slipped.

576
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,873
And she fell.

577
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,957
And she flew.

578
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,679
Where did she fly?

579
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,269
Tomorrow.

580
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,555
Tomorrow?

581
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,598
A place with more suns in the sky
than you can count.

582
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,153
It would be so bright.

583
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,073
A place not like today, or yesterday.

584
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,038
A place where things are better.

585
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,677
Tomorrow isn't a place.

586
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,039
You can't see it!

587
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,077
Yes, it is.

588
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,159
I've seen it.

589
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,877
That's where I'm going.

590
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,233
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

591
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,829
And when we wake up...

592
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,235
we're going to find the place
that has everything we want.

593
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,435
Tomorrow?

594
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,839
A cave.

595
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,717
That was too close. It almost caught us.

596
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,672
I was watching. We were fine.

597
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,995
We gotta move faster.

598
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,197
Do you people have any other speed
aside from "wander"?

599
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,396
I'll take a shamble at this point.

600
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,397
Hey, do you have a minute?

601
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,397
How did the tiger fly?

602
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,989
I only share when I'm outside the log.

603
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,513
I'm funny that way.

604
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,672
Leave this to me.

605
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,874
Hey, Thunk...

606
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,996
you have a spider on your face.

607
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,349
Oops.

608
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,113
He's loose!

609
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,435
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.

610
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,874
Do you mean these rocks?

611
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,871
Do not step on these rocks!

612
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,758
Step aside, girls.

613
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,038
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.

614
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,033
You cannot walk on those!

615
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,069
Get back here now!

616
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,393
There goes our chance for survival.

617
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,391
And our log!

618
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,389
Okay.

619
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,592
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly...

620
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,079
but it doesn't get better.

621
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,399
How about...

622
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,074
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.

623
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,119
Come on.

624
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,439
I can help you...

625
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,114
but we're going to have to
make a few changes around here.

626
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,271
The log ride is over.

627
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,759
Drop the log.

628
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,116
Now, kick it away.

629
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,759
Farther.

630
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,629
Really?

631
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,517
Okay, smart "Guy"...

632
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,954
now what?

633
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,676
Good fish, good fish.

634
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,839
Okay. Now you can look.

635
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,634
I love them!
Where are my feet?

636
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,994
They're still there!

637
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,109
Okay.

638
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,708
You're really heavy.

639
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,995
Really?

640
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,309
Thank you!

641
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,998
Hey. Wait!

642
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,634
Okay.

643
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,518
She's up. We're good. I'm good.

644
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,309
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?

645
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,390
I'm calling it a "brain."

646
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,869
I'm pretty sure it's
where ideas come from.

647
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,077
Dad, I don't have a brain.

648
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,511
We've gotten along just fine
without brains until now.

649
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,871
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.

650
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,316
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.

651
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,715
Now, let's get to that mountain!

652
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,030
Wow! I love those!

653
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,395
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

654
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,038
So, how did the tiger fly?

655
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,031
She jumped on the sun...

656
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,918
and rode it to Tomorrow.

657
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,871
No, no, no.

658
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,509
Hi, Dad!

659
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,478
Bye, Dad!

660
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,834
You've seen rain before, right?

661
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,275
We don't get out much.

662
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,833
Eep, looks dangerous.

663
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,030
Dad, you say that about everything.

664
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,189
Careful.

665
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,674
Really? Okay.

666
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,713
No, no, no. Not cool!

667
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,074
So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been
dumping my bones here since last week."

668
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,395
Last week!

669
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,873
That's a funny story!

670
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,110
It's not a story. It's a joke.

671
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,554
What's a "joke"?

672
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,752
Just making something up
to make you laugh.

673
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,109
- One for you.
- Thanks.

674
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,238
One for you. And this one's for you.

675
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,949
Okay.

676
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,951
Okay! That's enough!

677
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,431
I don't see why the kids
need their own shells.

678
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,636
So if anyone gets in trouble,
we can call the others.

679
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,598
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

680
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,752
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.

681
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,434
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.

682
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,589
They can handle it.

683
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,988
We can do it, Dad.

684
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,752
No, no, no.

685
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,951
It's my job to keep you safe.

686
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,430
I'm still in charge
and we are not splitting up.

687
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,235
Except for you two.

688
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,279
And that's final.

689
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,598
Hello?

690
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,716
Is everyone all right?

691
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,154
We're okay, Grug.

692
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,390
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.

693
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,120
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do? What do I do right now?

694
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,157
Stay where you are. I'll find you.

695
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,912
No. Too slow.

696
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,992
Everybody, keep moving forward
and we'll get out.

697
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,149
Dad?

698
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,673
Yeah.

699
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,193
Okay.

700
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,828
Remember, never not be afraid.

701
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,877
You can do this!

702
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,190
It's going to be okay,
it's going to be okay.

703
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,510
I'm going to pass out.

704
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,111
Sandy. Sandy!

705
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,432
Give me another one.

706
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,393
You dropped these.

707
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,553
Come with me.

708
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,152
Here, boy! Catch!

709
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,919
Yoo- hoo!

710
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,308
Gran?

711
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,869
Mom?

712
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,519
Wow.

713
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,439
Grug?

714
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,032
I'll go get him.

715
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,510
Good boy! Who's a good boy?

716
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,716
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!

717
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,677
You need a name. You want a name?

718
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,512
I'm going to call you Douglas.

719
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,995
Can you do tricks? Roll over.

720
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,037
Come on, Douglas, roll over.

721
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,031
Good boy, Douglas!

722
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,358
I was in love once.

723
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,353
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.

724
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,909
It was quite a scandal.

725
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,076
We fed each other berries, we danced.

726
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,550
Then my father smashed him with a rock
and traded me to your grandfather.

727
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,958
Croods!

728
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,394
Get down here.

729
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,358
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.

730
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,115
Guy is with them. Okay.

731
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,709
Thank you.

732
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,759
Thank you for bringing me
that interesting Guy update.

733
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,872
Okay. I'm going to go up...

734
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,716
and why don't you join us
when you stop being a big drag!

735
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,478
Sleep pile?

736
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,472
How about a story?

737
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,439
Anyone?

738
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,073
And then Torg said,
"Know it? I drew it."

739
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,631
That makes no sense.

740
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,472
I know it was hard for you
to bring us along...

741
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,518
but they had the
best day of their lives.

742
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,308
Thank you for that.

743
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,160
I want to show you something.

744
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,870
More suns in the sky than you can count.

745
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,719
Every sun that crosses our sky
comes to rest up there.

746
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,711
Tomorrow.

747
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,711
That's where we'll be safe.

748
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,391
I'm going with Guy.

749
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,234
No. Not my little girl.

750
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,352
Come with us.

751
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,233
I can't go without Grug.

752
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,073
That makes one of us. Count me in.

753
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,878
Really, Mom? Now?

754
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,275
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

755
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,556
In fact, he has no ideas at all!

756
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,712
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...

757
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,194
Face it.

758
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,397
If he actually had an idea of his own...

759
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,755
I'd have a heart attack and die!

760
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,229
Grug?

761
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,554
- Dad!
- Dad!

762
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,871
He's a big guy. How could he
just disappear like that?

763
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,794
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady
if she's seen Dad.

764
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,119
Haven't seen him.

765
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,632
What are you doing?

766
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,789
Yeah.

767
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,589
I was up all night, because
all these ideas just kept coming to me.

768
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,398
Is that a snake?

769
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,596
Belt, new and improved.

770
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,074
It's even self-tightening!

771
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,958
What is that on your head?

772
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,076
It's called desperation.

773
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,629
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."

774
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,792
And this one, I call it a "ride."

775
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,109
Rhymes with "Grug."

776
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,269
That doesn't rhyme...

777
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,795
It's going to get us
places faster than shoes.

778
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,477
Yeah! Try to keep up!

779
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,471
I wish I had a ride.

780
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,194
And painting is a thing of the past.

781
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,794
I call this a "snapshot."

782
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,190
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

783
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,755
I call them "shades."

784
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,871
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

785
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,837
Where do you get these great ideas?

786
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,274
Since I don't have a brain...

787
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,829
they're coming from my stomach,
down deep below...

788
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,150
and then up again into my mind.

789
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,991
Grug, we have to keep moving.

790
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,959
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

791
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,112
Like this. I call it a "mobile home."

792
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,998
Isn't that something?

793
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,634
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."

794
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,709
Mom?

795
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,949
I know. It's bad.

796
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,156
I almost feel sorry for him.

797
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,513
No, I don't.

798
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,351
What are you trying to do, Grug?

799
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,513
See, I thought if I could have ideas...

800
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,159
Iike Guy...

801
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,156
maybe Eep would listen to me.

802
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,029
And maybe she wouldn't
want to go with Guy.

803
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,553
Grug.

804
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,188
Is that what this is all about?

805
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,757
And I also thought
it would kill your mother.

806
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,388
So win- win.

807
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,993
We're here!

808
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,278
Wow.

809
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,555
Cave!

810
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,629
Everyone inside.

811
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,915
Hurry up. Let's go.

812
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,314
Let's go. Go!

813
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,715
No!

814
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,953
No more caves, Grug.

815
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,155
What?

816
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,915
We're going to jump on the sun
and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!

817
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,389
Wait. So you're all going to do this?

818
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,155
Thunk?

819
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,159
Sorry, Dad.

820
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,269
You have to stop worrying for all of us.

821
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,153
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!

822
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,151
The rules don't work out here!

823
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,509
They kept us alive!

824
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,753
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.

825
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,273
There's a difference.

826
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,954
Ugga, everyone,
you have to listen to me.

827
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,197
We would be dead if we listened to you!

828
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,751
We have to follow Guy now.

829
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,189
Guy.

830
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,359
Guy? Run.

831
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,309
This is pointless!

832
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,272
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.

833
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,516
You're being irrational
and counterproductive!

834
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,999
Big words anger me!

835
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,709
Keep talking.

836
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,108
Countermeasures!

837
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,872
You remember how you were
this morning? You changed.

838
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,792
Idea man. Modern man.

839
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,512
I am a caveman!

840
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,874
No, no, no, wait!

841
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,275
No!

842
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,352
What is this stuff that saves you
from my punches?

843
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,755
Tar.

844
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,195
No. I have to get back to them.

845
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,035
Stop struggling.

846
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,109
No!

847
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,229
Grug, stop!

848
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,555
No one gets out of this.

849
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,556
Believe me...

850
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,199
I know.

851
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,389
Your...

852
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,233
Family. Yeah.

853
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,952
Sorry.

854
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,754
I was little when it happened.

855
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,194
Last thing my parents told me was...

856
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,719
"Don't hide.

857
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,079
"Live.

858
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,275
"Follow the sun.

859
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,556
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."

860
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,911
You followed the light.

861
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,711
My daughter is a lot like you.

862
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,915
No.

863
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,593
She's like you.

864
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,797
She loves you,
but always forgets to say it.

865
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,474
Just like you forget to tell her.

866
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,680
I guess I was just busy
keeping them all alive.

867
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,595
It's okay. That's what dads do.

868
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,078
That's right.

869
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,475
But we can't do that from here.

870
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,313
We need one of your ideas.

871
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,993
Come on. You can do it.

872
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,312
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!

873
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,115
I've got it.

874
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,229
Wow.

875
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,278
Yeah, I know. But he's doing
the best with what he has.

876
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,629
Let's go.

877
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,672
There he is.

878
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,559
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.

879
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,709
Move me.

880
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,193
Okay, he sees us.

881
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,669
That's our cue. Now, work it!

882
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,228
He's not coming over.

883
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,038
I don't think our puppet
looks scared enough.

884
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,555
Scared? I'll show you scared.

885
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,312
Hand me those acting sticks!

886
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,392
Hold on!

887
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,111
Yes! You did it.

888
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,189
- Grug!
- Dad!

889
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,595
Hey! We're okay!

890
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,433
Yeah.

891
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,919
We're okay.

892
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,439
Grug, your call.

893
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,556
Take us to Tomorrow.

894
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,955
Hurry!

895
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,315
Come on! We're going to make it!

896
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,518
You were right.

897
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,114
There it is! The sun!

898
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,471
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!

899
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,629
Run!

900
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,029
I don't understand.

901
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,237
The sun was right here.
It was right here.

902
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,472
We have to go back to the cave.

903
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,033
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

904
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,351
Stay together. Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.

905
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,993
Everybody, hold my hand.

906
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,754
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.

907
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,036
Grug. What's wrong with you?

908
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,272
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

909
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,036
Grug, listen to me.

910
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,873
We've got to get back to that cave.

911
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,196
No more dark.

912
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,115
No more hiding.

913
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,596
No more caves.

914
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,271
What's the point of all this?

915
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,755
To follow the light.

916
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,112
I can't change.

917
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,430
I don't have ideas.

918
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,555
But I have my strength.

919
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,073
And right now...

920
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,549
that's all you need.

921
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,840
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!

922
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,956
It's too risky!

923
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,479
It's a chance.

924
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,270
I'll take that chance.

925
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,639
I've wanted to throw you away
ever since I met you.

926
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,637
That's a joke, right?

927
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,677
What's a "joke"?

928
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,598
He made it!

929
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,749
He made it.

930
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,950
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

931
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,633
You're not coming, are you?

932
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,628
When you make it, so will I.

933
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,949
No!

934
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,198
You did good.

935
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,039
Dadda!

936
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,189
Gran...

937
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,510
No mush. Just throw me.

938
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,429
Wait.

939
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,194
You surprised me today...

940
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,793
Iunkhead.

941
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,795
Still alive!

942
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,034
Time to go.

943
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,269
No.

944
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,516
I have too much to say to you.

945
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,114
I need to fix everything,
and I don't have time.

946
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,952
I can fix it.

947
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,233
This works good.

948
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,233
What do you call it?

949
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,390
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."

950
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,431
Because it rhymes with "Grug."

951
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,710
But you can change it if you want.

952
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,638
No. I like "hug."

953
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,873
I love you.

954
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,589
I...

955
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,633
Dad...

956
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,112
I'm scared.

957
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,754
Never be afraid.

958
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,515
There!

959
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,954
I see him!

960
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,749
Hey!

961
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,319
Hey, I did it!

962
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,951
Back! Stay back!

963
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,991
Stay back!

964
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,992
They're in trouble.

965
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,469
Hang on, I'm coming!

966
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,638
How do I get across?

967
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,957
I have to think. What would Guy do?

968
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,839
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?

969
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,951
What would I do?

970
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,279
Hold this.

971
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,116
I have...

972
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,956
an idea!

973
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,669
Run!

974
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,193
Yes!

975
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,829
Douglas?

976
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,032
Hey, I know that guy.

977
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,912
Hold on!

978
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,432
It's not safe here.

979
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,118
I'll tell her.

980
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,077
I never got to tell him.

981
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,157
Eep, if your dad were here,
he would tell you to...

982
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,392
Get out of the way!

983
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,710
Wow. You sound just like him.

984
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,634
Get out of the way!

985
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,995
Dadda!

986
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,388
He did it!

987
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,999
He's riding the sun.

988
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,231
But, not very well.

989
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,556
Everybody out of the way!

990
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,153
- Dad!
- Grug!

991
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,156
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?

992
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,871
I love you, too!

993
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,878
One, two, three, four...

994
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,553
five...

995
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,749
six...

996
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,910
and seven.

997
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,714
And a half.

998
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,513
And eight.

999
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,389
Nine.

1000
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,676
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!

1001
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,274
A boy has to have a pet.

1002
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,834
Turns out I'm a cat person.

1003
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,549
No.

1004
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,876
You really need to see this.

1005
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,432
We should go there.

1006
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,030
Yes! Coming through!

1007
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,549
Wait!

1008
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,878
This is me. My name is Eep.

1009
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,277
And this is my family, the Croods.

1010
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,795
If you weren't clued in
by the suntans and pets...

1011
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,639
we're not exactly cavemen anymore.

1012
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,673
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

1013
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,232
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...

1014
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,796
but now we know the Croods will make it.

1015
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,758
Because we changed the rules...

1016
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,751
the ones that kept us in the dark.

1017
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,673
And because of my dad,
who taught us that anyone can change.

1018
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,512
Release the baby!

1019
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,199
Sort of.

1020
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,276
So, from now on,
we'll stay out here...

1021
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,550
where we can follow the light.
