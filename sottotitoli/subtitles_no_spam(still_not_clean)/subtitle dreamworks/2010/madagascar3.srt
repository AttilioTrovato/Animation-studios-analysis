1
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,002
<i>OK. Wind her up, boys!</i>

2
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:49,839
<i>It's Monte Carlo or bust.</i>

3
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,275
<i>- Struts.
- Check.</i>

4
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:52,380
<i>- Flaps.
- Check.</i>

5
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:54,278
<i>- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.</i>

6
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:58,346
<i>We'll be back from our gambling spree
in a couple weeks.</i>

7
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,456
<i>- Bye!
- Or whenever the gold runs out.</i>

8
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:01,556
- Buh-bye!
- Good-bye.

9
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,386
All right! We'll be waiting for you!

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,554
Just kidding!
We're never coming back!

11
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,027
Sorry! What was that?

12
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,029
Initiate warp drive.

13
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,703
Did they just say
they were never coming back?

14
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,467
Guys?

15
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:23,876
Marty?

16
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:25,674
Oh, goody, you're here!

17
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,976
Why don't you just chew on this?

18
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:29,709
I'm hungry.

19
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:36,555
I'm just messing with you.

20
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:39,718
I lost all feeling
in this thing years ago.

21
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:43,726
Melman? Why do you look like that?

22
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:45,865
Look who's talking.

23
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:49,027
Gloria? Why are you guys so... elderly?

24
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:51,934
Now, when was the last time
you looked in the mirror?

25
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:53,165
What?

26
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:54,939
No!

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,340
Wake up! Wake up, Ally-Al!

28
00:01:57,513 --> 00:01:58,502
- Wake up!
- Marty!

29
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,112
Marty, it was horrible.

30
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:01,840
That same nightmare again, huh?

31
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:05,077
We were stuck here in Africa,
and we were all super-old and wrinkly...

32
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,722
Well, I aged well,
but the rest of you looked terrible!

33
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,882
Relax, Alex.
'Cause I got a surprise for you!

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,528
Is it the penguins?
Have they come to take us home?

35
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:16,460
Nope. But it's the next best thing.

36
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:18,264
Another day bites the dust.

37
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,423
Come on, now!

38
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:21,194
Watch it. Watch yourself. Small divots!

39
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,033
Sorry, little incline there.
Back up this hill.

40
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:29,775
A low-hanging branch,
then just over this bluff and voil?

41
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,216
Happy birthday, pal!

42
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,243
Whoa.

43
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,782
Wow! New York City.

44
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:46,955
Surprise!

45
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,428
Gloria! You're the Statue of Liberty!

46
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,567
Bring me your huddled masses, baby!

47
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,101
And, Melman,
you're the Brooklyn Bridge!

48
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,897
Actually, I'm the Triboro Bridge.

49
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,802
Wow! You guys made this?

50
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,843
Yeah. From memory!
From crazy, obsessive memory.

51
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:08,341
Hey! Fifth Avenue... with no traffic!

52
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:12,510
There's Times Square, with its
modern-day corporate lack of character.

53
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,419
Nine Duane Reades on the same street!

54
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:19,824
And the zoo.

55
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:21,986
Wow, our home.

56
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:23,756
Look! There's a little me.

57
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,494
And little all of us-es!

58
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:34,334
Alex! Alex! Alex!

59
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,619
Oh, no!

60
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:07,239
You guys.
You've both made and ruined my day.

61
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:09,404
Make a wish, sweetheart.

62
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,473
Your wish has come true!

63
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,208
Oh, yay!

64
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:19,884
My tummy is speaking to me!

65
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,546
Oh, gross!

66
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:24,521
I wouldn't eat that side of the cake
if I were you.

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,425
Alex, what was your wish?

68
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:30,359
I wished we could go home.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

69
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:33,056
I love this.
But it's not the real thing.

70
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:35,828
That's because it's a mud model, Alex.

71
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,563
It's not actually New York.
I hope that was clear.

72
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,002
What are we doing?

73
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:43,007
Here we are relying on the penguins
to come back for us.

74
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:46,669
But... we should just go to Monte Carlo
and get them.

75
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:49,646
How do a lion, a zebra,
a giraffe and a hippo walk

76
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,547
into a casino in Monte Carlo?

77
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,778
I don't know. Ask the rabbi!

78
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,047
- Hey, I'm serious.
- Come on!

79
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:57,885
We can do it!
We can do anything! It's us!

80
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:58,889
We're us!

81
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,392
Yeah, that's right.
We've gone halfway around the world!

82
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:05,396
Compared with that, Monte Carlo's
just a hop, skip and a swim away!

83
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,396
Yeah.

84
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,534
To home.

85
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:08,726
- Home!
- Home.

86
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,564
- Home.
- Cheeseburger.

87
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:13,707
Tell you what, bet those penguins
will be glad to see us.

88
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,605
Yeah, they're probably
bored out of their minds!

89
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,624
You pillow fight
like a bunch of little girls!

90
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:39,626
Chimichanga! These pillows
are filled with baby birds!

91
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,158
What?

92
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,354
There it is. The casino!

93
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:14,626
What?

94
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:17,428
I said, "Perfect.
That's where we'll find the penguins."

95
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,628
What?

96
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,033
Come on, guys.

97
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:26,611
Operation Penguin Extraction
does not include levity.

98
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,714
We can't draw attention to ourselves.

99
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:31,146
We're invisible!

100
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:33,786
I'm talking really, really quiet.

101
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:37,688
Everybody dance now!

102
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,023
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

103
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,685
Everybody dance now!

104
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:46,229
Yeah!

105
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:51,504
OK. Phase One: We break
into the casino, grab the penguins,

106
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,002
and get them
to take us back to New York

107
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:54,640
in the Monkey-Powered Super Plane!

108
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:55,638
Check.

109
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:58,835
Phase Two: We chew out the penguins
for abandoning us in Africa.

110
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:00,001
Check.

111
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,705
Phase Three:
We apologize to the penguins

112
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:07,217
for overly harsh chewing outing,
but we've gotten our point across.

113
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:10,254
Phase Four: Back to New York City.

114
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:11,321
- Yes!
- I like it!

115
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:15,217
All right, we take
these ventilation ducts

116
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,761
to the crawlspace above the casino
where we find the penguins.

117
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,765
I just need to figure out
which duct each of us should take.

118
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:23,562
Pause
Back with the bass

119
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:26,171
The jam is live in effect
and I don't waste time

120
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:28,330
On the mic with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm

121
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:30,772
Jump, jump to the rhythm, jump...

122
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,561
Oh, no!

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,726
Take cover!

124
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,236
- Hi, honey.
- OK!

125
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:02,238
OK, OK. I got you. I got you, honey.

126
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,083
Now, they're not gonna let
animals on to the casino floor,

127
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,913
so expect some kind of disguise.

128
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:19,648
Look at that!
That is one ugly, mug-ugly lady!

129
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,954
That is roach-killing ugly!

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,254
That's not a lady.
That's the King of Versailles.

131
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,227
And that's not the King of Versailles.

132
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:28,628
That's the chimps.
And the chimps are like smoke.

133
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:32,430
And where there's smoke, there's fire.
And by fire, I mean the penguins!

134
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:33,502
King of Versailles wins again.

135
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:35,264
I say we let it ride.

136
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:40,771
Then we'll pick up the hippies
and fly back to New York in style.

137
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,140
Can we buy an Airbus A-380?

138
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,077
Solid gold, baby!

139
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:46,479
Sir! A solid gold plane
wouldn't be able to fly.

140
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,621
Kowalski, we'll be rich!
The rules of physics don't apply to us.

141
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:50,652
Let it ride!

142
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:51,847
Right-o!

143
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:58,588
OK. In exactly two minutes and 17
seconds, the lemurs will cut the power.

144
00:08:58,764 --> 00:08:59,753
- Now?
- No.

145
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:00,796
- OK?
- No.

146
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:01,796
- Now?
- No.

147
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:05,266
I drop down, grab the penguins.
You crank me up, and we are out of here.

148
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,803
Let me drop down!
I'll grab the penguins!

149
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,133
You don't have fingers, Marty.

150
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,935
- Now? Do it?
- No. No!

151
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,441
These are things a leader
has to think of.

152
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,670
Why should you be the leader?
Why not me?

153
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,337
'Cause I'm the phase tracker!

154
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,983
The king is letting it ride.

155
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,877
- How did I get phased out?
- You're part of a phase.

156
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,022
A phase isn't something you own,
it's something you're in.

157
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,019
That's it.

158
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,358
Who voted you
Grand Phase Master anyway?

159
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,892
Me! I voted me!
'Cause I'm the leader!

160
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:31,996
- Black!
- That's it, baby!

161
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:32,994
- Now?
- No!

162
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,032
The King of Versailles wins it all!

163
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,668
- Maybe I should be in charge.
- Melman!

164
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:39,064
I am a doctor.

165
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:40,136
- Now!
- No.

166
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:41,294
Why can't we all be leaders?

167
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:43,634
Enough! I'm gonna lead.

168
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,424
What's new, pussycat?

169
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:03,753
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

170
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,522
Marty, what phase are we at?

171
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:07,688
Phase Three: Apologize!

172
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:09,856
Right. Oh, man, we are so sorry.

173
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:12,559
Apology accepted. Let's roll!

174
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,733
Marty! We skipped Phase Two!
We didn't chew them out!

175
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,239
Don't look at me.
I'm just following the leader!

176
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,878
- Now!
- I'm a bit busy right now.

177
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,513
Just pull the switch!

178
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:25,774
OK, fine.

179
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:34,057
What the heck is going on
with the lights?

180
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:36,557
Yo, tell me what you want
What you really, really want

181
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,059
I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want...

182
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,891
What are you doing?!

183
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:42,396
Come on!

184
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,799
Initiate lockdown!

185
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:52,272
And get me Captain Dubois
from Animal Control!

186
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,414
Speak.

187
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,250
Oui.

188
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,752
A zebra?

189
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,321
A hippo?

190
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:07,583
A giraffe?

191
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,591
A lion?!

192
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,424
When I was seven,
I strangled my first parrot,

193
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:17,227
flushed my first goldfish,
punched my first snake.

194
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:22,236
Now I have finally reached the moment
I have been preparing for my entire life.

195
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:24,707
The pinnacle of my career:

196
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,003
to hunt the king of the beasts!

197
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:43,957
- Oh, no.
- Lockdown, eh?

198
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:44,958
What do we do?

199
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,690
All right, everybody, stand back.
I got this one.

200
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:54,497
Never mind.

201
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,573
Well, you only get one chance
at a first impression.

202
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:06,805
- What just happened?
- Where are we? What is this?

203
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,816
We call it
the Luxury Assault Recreational Vehicle.

204
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,385
The car goes vroom-vroom!

205
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,647
Step on it, boys!

206
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:53,760
Captain Dubois, I am so happy
to see you! You will not believe...

207
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,060
Get back, you fool! Your cheap cologne
is obscuring the animal musk!

208
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,429
Oh, my face!

209
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,545
Poor, poor animals.

210
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:22,624
You should never have left the forest.
Now you deal with me.

211
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,621
Kowalski, signal the chimps to meet us

212
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:29,822
at the rendezvous point
with the Super Plane.

213
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,194
Hotel Ambassador. Let's move it!

214
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,872
Voil? Giraffe at twelve o'clock.

215
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,305
Guys, we've got a tail.

216
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,072
Paparazzi!

217
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:47,478
Pedal to the metal, Private.

218
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,448
Don't take any photos, please!

219
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:50,711
Hi!

220
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,582
Here I am!

221
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:56,487
Don't take... any... photos.

222
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,460
- No more pictures!
- Medic!

223
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:10,067
- ETA to rendezvous point?
- Two minutes, 37 seconds, sir.

224
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,297
Man your battle stations!

225
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:15,401
Hey! Wait! Nobody's at the wheel!

226
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:19,274
Get back there! Negative on the driver!
There's no driver!

227
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:22,678
Help! Nobody's driving!
Oh, no! We're going to die!

228
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:25,411
Don't just sit there, fancy pants.
Grab the wheel!

229
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,316
Are you kidding?
I don't drive. I'm a New Yorker!

230
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:28,581
Move over, Miss Daisy!

231
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:32,158
What are you doing? Zebras can't drive!
Only penguins and people can drive.

232
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,091
What do all these buttons do?

233
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:36,924
Help me!

234
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:39,160
Nice one, Stripes!

235
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,166
Crazy woman gaining!

236
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,642
Our Omega-3 slick will take them down.

237
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:52,303
Private, activate!

238
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:07,117
She's good!

239
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,854
Kowalski, intel.

240
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,322
Sir. We have a serious problem.

241
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,797
Captain Chantal Dubois.

242
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:16,062
Monaco Animal Control.
Perfect case record.

243
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,400
You're going the wrong way, Marty!

244
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,069
Just call me Marty-o Andretti.

245
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:26,680
No. You're Sucky-o Andretti!

246
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:27,941
Stop backseat driving!

247
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,209
I'm passenger-seat driving.
Give me the wheel.

248
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:31,819
It's not a wheel, it's my baby!

249
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,579
Your hoofs aren't meant to be
on a wheel!

250
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:35,724
- Hey! Too late for you to drive!
- Don't look at me!

251
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,825
Don't look at me when we argue!
Look at the road!

252
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:39,221
Be cool, be cool!

253
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:41,989
Hi, Officer. Is there a problem?

254
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,392
Hi.

255
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,666
Watch out!

256
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:53,908
We need more power.

257
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:57,273
Time to fire up
Kowalski's nucular reactor.

258
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,347
- That's a nuclear reactor?
- Nucular.

259
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,543
She's on the roof!

260
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:03,547
But, sir, it's not ready.

261
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:05,345
The control rods
will have to be calibrated.

262
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,351
And don't even ask me
about the Uranium-238 blanket.

263
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:08,682
OK.

264
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:18,390
OK, Marty, we lost her!
Maybe you can slow down now.

265
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:19,931
I can't! There's no brakes!

266
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:23,696
No brakes?
Way to commit, soldier.

267
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:47,486
Let's get out of here!

268
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:49,391
Go, go, go! Move! Now!

269
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:52,226
Hey, where's everybody going?

270
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:05,242
I'm flying!

271
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:09,907
I'm flying!
I'm the first flying monkey!

272
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:12,951
Oh, yay!

273
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,485
That's our ticket out of here!

274
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,990
Yeah, baby!

275
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,679
Everybody!
On the monkey chain!

276
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:47,480
Deploy banana gun!

277
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:07,129
Grab the little guys! Toss them up!
Let's go! Go, go, go! Go!

278
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:10,037
Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on!

279
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:18,408
Come on, Melman!

280
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:19,882
Yeah!

281
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:20,883
Melman!

282
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:24,312
My neck!

283
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:32,159
Put your backs into it!
Double banana overtime!

284
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:41,833
Serpentine! Serpentine!

285
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:08,358
Hey, this lady's
really starting to freak me out.

286
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:11,461
Fix it, Mort.

287
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,476
Hold this.

288
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:21,803
Alex, be careful! She's crazy!

289
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:23,381
You think, Marty?!

290
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:36,285
That's right! Home free, baby!

291
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:37,953
I can breathe!

292
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,292
Au revoir, Dubois!

293
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,567
Well played, lion.

294
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:46,595
Game on.

295
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,304
New York, New York
It's a heck of a town

296
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,743
- The Bronx is up
- But the Battery's down

297
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,981
New York, New York

298
00:19:58,151 --> 00:19:59,948
Kowalski, status report.

299
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,816
So the good news is
this song is almost over.

300
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:06,425
Well, that's music to my ears.
And the bad news?

301
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:08,685
The gear assembly is
badly damaged, sir.

302
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:13,158
It's only a matter of time before...

303
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:25,004
Why can't we ever
just make a normal landing?

304
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,508
Oh, man!

305
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,671
Hold on, Melman. OK?
I'll get you down, sweetie.

306
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:35,277
Where is he?
Must find King Julien. King Julien!

307
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:37,615
It's getting hot in here

308
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,519
So take off all your fur

309
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,785
I am getting so hot

310
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,121
I want to take my fur off

311
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:45,729
Skipper, what about the plane?

312
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:49,732
The chimps will work through the night.
No breaks, no safety restrictions.

313
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:52,564
Hey, where are you going?

314
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:54,706
Get back here! We have a contract!

315
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:58,468
Yes. Well, I'm afraid labor laws
are slightly more lenient in France.

316
00:20:58,711 --> 00:21:01,339
You see, they only have to work
two weeks a year.

317
00:21:01,513 --> 00:21:04,175
Well, someone else
has the Canadian work ethic!

318
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:06,715
But you penguins,
you can still fix it, right? Right?

319
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:09,251
Yeah, yeah. You're
a little crackerjack, can-do team.

320
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:11,218
You want me to give it to you straight?

321
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,517
Yes! Yes! No.

322
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:14,920
Bend it a little?

323
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:18,530
Well, the plane's totaled.
Kaput, blammo, busted!

324
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:20,528
Never to fly again.

325
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:23,532
So that's it? That's it then,
we're never gonna get home?

326
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:25,567
No! We've got to get home!

327
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:28,996
We can fix it! We'll fix it!
Yeah, guys, come on, we'll fix it!

328
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,734
You just start from the outside pieces,
and you work your way in.

329
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,502
And, yeah, perfect!

330
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,580
Come on! Don't just stand there, guys.
Marty! Drag that thingy over here.

331
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:40,876
And we'll just attach it
to this dealy-bob over here. And...

332
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:46,017
We're not going home.

333
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:51,355
We're never going home.

334
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,263
It's the fuzz!

335
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,373
What are we gonna do?
We can't hide forever!

336
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:07,772
And we can't just blend!
You know this ain't Africa.

337
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,776
Oh, what's the point?

338
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:13,439
Tell me one conceivable way
that extra-large animals like us

339
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:14,983
are gonna be able
to move through Europe

340
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:18,122
without attracting unwanted attention.

341
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,051
Hey...

342
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:25,888
Where are you coming from?

343
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:29,464
Please, you got to hide us.
Just until the heat dies down.

344
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:31,158
Absolut no outsiders.

345
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:33,803
So wipe that Smirnoff your face
and Popov!

346
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:36,963
Come on, man. You gotta do
one cat a solid. Cat to cat.

347
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:39,905
Do a solid here, buddy. Come on.

348
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:44,146
Nyet! This train is
for circus animals only.

349
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:45,577
They sound like they be in trouble.

350
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,086
Stefano, we do not invite trouble
into our circus. I don't trust lion.

351
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:53,485
Hair too big and glossy!

352
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:55,558
Aw, come on, Vitaly, you're being mean.

353
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,753
He not lion.
He lioness... with a beehive.

354
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:02,923
This is awkward.
We can hear everything they're saying.

355
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:05,958
It is not our problem!

356
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,196
No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

357
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,672
Just give us a minute. He's on the phone
and... can't get him off!

358
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,676
We cannot leave them there!

359
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,940
Only circus animals on this train!

360
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:22,108
Wait, listen! We are circus animals.
You got to let us in!

361
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:26,356
You are really circus?

362
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,359
Yes. Full circus!

363
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:33,122
My momma was circus.
My daddy was circus.

364
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:34,958
Gia! Shut the door!

365
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,792
Please.

366
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:38,964
Over there! Over there!

367
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:42,731
They are circus. Circus stick together.

368
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:15,827
Wow! Circus americano!

369
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:18,497
You must all be very famous!

370
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:20,542
- Yeah, we...
- Absolutely.

371
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,076
We're relatively well known...

372
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:24,577
But Alex is really the star.

373
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:28,741
Well, I'm not... I wouldn't say "star."
More like... well, star.

374
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:29,908
What is your act, Alice?

375
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:33,749
Well... I basically,
uh, I jump up on my rock...

376
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:36,392
- Rock?
- Yeah. It's a very high... rock.

377
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,390
- A really high rock!
- And then?

378
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:43,191
And then, well, I roar like...
Iike a serious "Rawrrr!"

379
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,766
- And then?
- And then I jump off the rock.

380
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:48,302
- And then?!
- And then... And then what?

381
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:49,733
- That is all?
- lnto a pool!

382
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,771
- Full of water!
- Full of cobras!

383
00:24:51,942 --> 00:24:53,603
Actually, it appears
like I'm jumping in to a pool...

384
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:55,608
- With cobras!
- Aquatic cobras.

385
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,872
For effect. But I actually pull up
at the last second.

386
00:24:58,048 --> 00:24:58,912
- Pull up?
- Yeah.

387
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,811
- How do you do that?!
- Wire harness!

388
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:02,281
- Balloons!
- Jet pack!

389
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:09,324
I flip off the wire harness,
ignite my jet pack,

390
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:12,120
and then toss balloons
to the children of the world.

391
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:13,887
Kids love it. Kids always love that.

392
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:16,965
Is this like the trapeze?

393
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,294
Yes! Trapeze! Exactly!

394
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:22,302
Wow! Trapeze americano!

395
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:26,738
Hey, I have a great idea!
Maybe you come with us to Roma!

396
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:30,945
Hey, Vitaly is just playing around.
He is good, no?

397
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,411
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

398
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:34,015
But we're gonna get off
at the next stop

399
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,344
so we can get back to America.

400
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:38,113
That is such a coincidence!

401
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,756
Because we're going... going to...

402
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,323
Let me finish!

403
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:44,960
We're going to America, as well!

404
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,117
- What?!
- America?

405
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:47,661
- Going to America?
- What?

406
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:49,162
- S?
- Wow? When?

407
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:51,366
After Roma, we go to London.

408
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:56,437
And then a big-time promoter will see us
and then send us to New York.

409
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:58,039
They're going to New York!

410
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,005
Well, only if he likes what he sees.

411
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:02,870
New York? Seriously?
That's our home. That's where we live.

412
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:03,944
Isn't that fun?

413
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:05,103
- Could we go with you?
- Sure!

414
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,112
You can bunk with Vitaly!

415
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,510
- Whoa!
- Or not.

416
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:13,747
Nyet!

417
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:15,014
Oh, no.

418
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,820
I don't think Vitaly likes that idea.
What's he gonna do?

419
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,798
Which one of you is leader?

420
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:32,569
Tell your comrades
there is one rule we do not break!

421
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,801
Thou shalt say it and not spray it?

422
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,206
Nyet!

423
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:41,372
Circus owner no allow stowaways!

424
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:48,022
I hear you, Russki.

425
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,557
Although, the circus owner
may allow stowaways

426
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:55,254
if the stowaways
just happen to be the owners.

427
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:58,062
Riddle me that.

428
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,095
What is sharply dressed
little birdie talking about?

429
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:04,205
Show 'em, boys.

430
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:16,683
You have a deal, mi amigo.

431
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:23,682
I am sure this circus
will bring you great success!

432
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,421
I guess this is good-bye and good luck!

433
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,272
What do we know
about owning a circus?

434
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:43,309
Nothing. But it's our only shot
at getting home.

435
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:44,946
You better know what you're doing.

436
00:27:45,114 --> 00:27:47,446
You're risking
Private's community college fund.

437
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:50,107
I'll never be president.

438
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,639
Hey, this is not first class.

439
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:19,275
Definitely coach.

440
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:34,988
Mort! Stop it!

441
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,082
Hey, gorgeous.

442
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:36,690
Has anyone ever told you
that you look like a supermodel?

443
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:41,222
Albeit a fat, hairy one who smells.

444
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,571
You have a very hairy back.

445
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,709
I like that in a woman.

446
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:02,746
That's it! I'm going in.

447
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:03,941
Stop! It's too dangerous!

448
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:05,415
Don't be a hero!

449
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:14,087
Lion.

450
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,420
Twelve hours old.

451
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,089
Two hundred and fifty kilograms.

452
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:25,097
Glossy mane.
Too much conditioner.

453
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:27,937
Stupid bozos!

454
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:40,109
Hello, kitty!

455
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:44,782
So, you ran away with the circus.

456
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,789
What a clich?

457
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,747
What a dump!

458
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:15,444
If they want to attract
a decent sports team,

459
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:19,523
they should bulldoze this rat trap
and invest in a new arena.

460
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:28,495
The Colosseum, Marty!
The original theater-in-the-round.

461
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:31,501
- My ancestors used to perform here.
- No kidding!

462
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:33,536
Yeah. Every show had
a captive audience.

463
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:36,039
- Apparently, they killed.
- Sounds like a great gig!

464
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:38,541
Trenta minuti, everybody!
Trenta minuti!

465
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,543
This is so exciting!

466
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:42,147
Remember, we just lay low.

467
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:44,044
Stay out of the way.
Let them do their thing.

468
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:46,312
Would you look at this?

469
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:48,283
You gotta go back
in your momma's belly,

470
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:50,480
'cause you're too cute
to be out here in the real world.

471
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:52,716
- Oi! Naff off, you muppet!
- Whoa! What the...?

472
00:31:52,892 --> 00:31:54,723
Marty, they're professionals. Come on.

473
00:31:54,894 --> 00:31:55,986
You look gorgeous!

474
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:58,663
All right, animals!
We may be your new owners,

475
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:01,027
but we don't want to reinvent
the circus wheel here,

476
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:02,896
so just go out, do what you do!

477
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:05,503
Just think of this as a fun warm-up
for that promoter in London.

478
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:07,902
Right, Marty? Marty?

479
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:09,735
I want to be a circus horse!

480
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:10,967
We could paint you white!

481
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:12,475
And then paint you pink!

482
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:14,738
- Awesome!
- Not laying very low, are we, Marty?

483
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:19,078
Sonya! Where is the bear?
Sonya! We're about to start!

484
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:20,742
Hey, Vitaly!

485
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,580
Got your game face on.

486
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:24,583
Good game face.

487
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:26,520
What is that cat's problem?

488
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:29,183
"I'm a mean Russian cat
who isn't nice to anybody."

489
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,761
Hey, honey, look! Look, I'm doing it!

490
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,420
Guys, stop fooling around.

491
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,588
We're just having a little fun.

492
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:37,031
Let's let these animals do their show.

493
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:42,036
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, circus!
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, Afro!

494
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:43,936
Circus Afro
Circus Afro

495
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:46,543
Polka dot, polka dot, polka dot, Afro!

496
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:47,872
Really?

497
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:50,844
Sonya! Where is Sonya the bear?!

498
00:33:32,124 --> 00:33:35,491
I want to kiss
every inch of your huge head.

499
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:37,993
It may take me a number of weeks.

500
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:41,326
Hey, watch it!

501
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:48,966
That was heavy.

502
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:53,436
Don't cry. Stop crying!

503
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:56,103
It makes me cry
to see you cry, my darling.

504
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,943
I will get you something even better.

505
00:34:03,622 --> 00:34:05,021
Hey, you can buy love.

506
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,124
Whoa, not too fast!

507
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:16,794
Ladies and gentlemen,

508
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,302
presenting Gia,

509
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:23,463
the trapeze-flying jaguar!

510
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:27,008
And there she go.
The triple-flip roll

511
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:30,443
with a double leap, and...

512
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,678
What are you doing?!

513
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:34,715
That's just paper.

514
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:37,682
Were you spying on me?

515
00:34:37,855 --> 00:34:41,518
No! I just came by to say
that I don't want you to think...

516
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:46,627
I don't want you to think of me
as some sort of authority figure.

517
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:49,693
Don't worry. I don't.

518
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:51,357
- You don't?
- Not at all.

519
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:54,266
Well, the other circus animals
might find me a bit intimidating.

520
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:56,565
No. Nobody is intimidated at all by you.

521
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:59,141
Oh, good stuff. Good. Good news.

522
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,641
In fact, I do not think

523
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:02,676
they have given you a second thought
since you showed up.

524
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:03,814
That's good to hear.

525
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:06,506
If anything,
they're starting to feel sorry for you.

526
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:08,982
OK, I get it. OK?

527
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:10,820
Is there more?

528
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:14,082
I just wanted to thank you
for letting us get on the train back there.

529
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:16,419
I know the big cat with the accent...

530
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,653
...wasn't so excited
about us getting on.

531
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:20,330
Look, lion guy.

532
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:23,399
This circus means everything to us.

533
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:27,026
And if you do anything
that threatens this circus,

534
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:31,163
you will have to answer to me. Capisce?

535
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:34,568
I capisce, cool. Trust me, we're cool.

536
00:35:44,021 --> 00:35:46,421
You call this laying low?

537
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,872
Faster! Faster!

538
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:09,377
Where there is circus, there is lion.

539
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:12,409
And when in Rome...

540
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,740
Vive la France!

541
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:21,384
Halt!

542
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:29,395
Come on, my hairy queen.
We'll do doughnuts in the Pantheon.

543
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:39,241
You're in big trouble.

544
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,910
Now you're really in big troub...

545
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,636
Now you're really, really in big tro...

546
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:46,615
I'm new!

547
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:52,111
OK! Strike up the band!

548
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:53,619
You have a band?

549
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,319
Prepare to be blown away!

550
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:00,759
- Blow me away!
- Here we go!

551
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:06,263
Look at this. Whoa! Hey!

552
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:08,431
It's nice to be...

553
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:11,000
Yay...

554
00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:14,666
Hey!

555
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:19,547
Whoa! How do dogs do that?

556
00:37:19,716 --> 00:37:21,343
Get on with it!

557
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,620
Stupido!

558
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:45,199
Well, that was worth
the price of admission.

559
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:52,042
Watch it, mate!

560
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,880
Who's from Cincinnati?

561
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:57,819
Stefano, you know
"blown away" means good, right?

562
00:37:57,987 --> 00:38:00,478
Don't worry.
The big finale is coming up!

563
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:03,217
Give me a downbeat! Look at this!

564
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:08,295
Oh, no. No, this is not happening.

565
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:10,591
You have a deal, mi amigo.

566
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,166
It's good, no?

567
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:15,827
Yes, go out and get food and come back!

568
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:25,344
Deep breaths.
You're in a happy place. It's all good.

569
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:27,176
There's an angry mob outside,

570
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,112
and they're demanding
their money back!

571
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:32,515
I think we all know the right thing to do.

572
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,088
Come on, come on!

573
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:40,694
Come on! Hurry up!

574
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,755
Hop on the train!

575
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,198
Come on, guys!

576
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:51,532
Mamma mia!

577
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,106
Hurry up!

578
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:56,874
Grazie, Alice.

579
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:01,208
Just throw us the money!

580
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:14,792
Captain Chantal Dubois. Get up.

581
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:19,127
I'm going to have to send you back
to Monaco under maximum security.

582
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:23,937
What?!

583
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,274
It's just a pillow!

584
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:29,933
That's the oldest trick
in the book, Comandante.

585
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:32,740
Every bambino in ltaly knows that one.

586
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:36,817
Maybe, but do they know
about the old escape hole

587
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:39,510
behind the innocent-looking poster?

588
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:46,855
Or the really old "I'm gonna
hide up on the ceiling" trick!

589
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:54,191
Of course.

590
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:56,462
The secret tunnel under the bed!

591
00:39:56,638 --> 00:39:58,128
Get this thing out of the way.

592
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:01,810
Let's go!

593
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:07,307
This secret tunnel is a dead end!

594
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:11,213
There's nothing but bedsprings
and mattress stuffing down here!

595
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:15,214
Was that the sound
of a cell door closing?

596
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:25,359
Voil?

597
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:30,733
Was that the sound
of my HP printer printing?

598
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:42,243
This is a disaster!

599
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:46,580
We blow all our money on a bad circus,
and we're not any closer to New York!

600
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:48,187
If anything, we're further away!

601
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:51,519
We could have at least bought a circus
that knew how to circ!

602
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:55,093
I don't even know why we bought
a circus in the first place.

603
00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:57,231
We had enough dough for a plane!

604
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:58,228
Are you kidding me?

605
00:40:58,399 --> 00:40:59,889
You must have some money left over.

606
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:03,264
I used it to buy teeth
and then have them capped in gold.

607
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:05,598
Now I can eat apples!

608
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:09,402
Sadly, I discovered I don't like apples.

609
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:13,877
No promoter is sending this show
to America. It's toe up!

610
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:15,037
Now it all makes sense.

611
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:18,117
No wonder the circus master
was so happy to sell.

612
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:21,551
He was happy, all right.
Happy about ripping us off!

613
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,949
Where did Alex go?

614
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:28,186
I don't know.

615
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:40,138
Come on! This way!

616
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:42,640
No, no, no. You come this way!

617
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,869
Alice, watch your head!

618
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,658
Alice!

619
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:07,825
Alice!

620
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:10,263
I'm fine!

621
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:12,233
Fantastic!

622
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:17,235
Was that trapeze americano?

623
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah. Sort of.

624
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:19,443
Incredible!

625
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:20,944
I hope this is important.

626
00:42:21,115 --> 00:42:22,605
Come this way, Alice!

627
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:27,519
By the way, it's "icks" not "iss."
Alex. Like New York Knicks.

628
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:31,920
I know. New York Kniss. Is not hard.

629
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:33,650
Whoa.

630
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,962
What is this place?

631
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:47,834
I know you think we are
a stinky, poopy circus,

632
00:42:48,008 --> 00:42:51,705
but there is something you must know.

633
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:55,279
There was a time
when Circus Zaragoza,

634
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,040
we were a great circus!

635
00:42:57,217 --> 00:42:59,708
Numero uno in all the Europa!

636
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:04,547
And Vitaly...
he was the biggest star of us all.

637
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:08,717
He was fearless.
Taking risks. Always new.

638
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:11,989
He jump through the hoop
like he could fly!

639
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:26,304
Stefano!

640
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,379
Make the hoop smaller.

641
00:43:28,548 --> 00:43:29,515
Like this?

642
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:31,013
Smaller.

643
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:33,414
- Like this?
- Good!

644
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,594
It had never been done before
because it was physically impossible!

645
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,500
And the people... they loved it!

646
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,007
Viva Vitaly!

647
00:43:58,178 --> 00:43:59,406
Smaller!

648
00:44:11,091 --> 00:44:13,286
And the hoop, she got smaller!

649
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,518
Like the ring

650
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:19,222
on a finger of the tiniest lady
with the slimmest of fingers.

651
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:21,094
Bravo, Vitaly!

652
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:26,128
He would not stop pushing.

653
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:28,570
And one fateful day...

654
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:31,243
...he push too far!

655
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:34,346
Light the hoop on fire!

656
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,494
He fly too close to the sun...
and he got burned.

657
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:04,836
Literally. The extra virgin olive oil
is extra flammable.

658
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,841
And he lost everything.

659
00:45:07,012 --> 00:45:10,243
His wife, she run off with a musician.

660
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:13,782
He lost his dignity... his fame...

661
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:17,513
...his passion... and his fur.

662
00:45:17,689 --> 00:45:22,524
And when it grow back, it is less soft.
More like a prickly beard.

663
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:24,685
Scusi. Vitaly!

664
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:27,355
Nothing!

665
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:31,367
His only passion now is the borscht.

666
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:34,797
Whoa.

667
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:37,100
He was our inspiration.

668
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,971
So when he lost his passion,

669
00:45:39,144 --> 00:45:42,204
well... as Vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.

670
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:44,872
This is why we need your help.

671
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:45,948
What sort of help?

672
00:45:46,151 --> 00:45:50,019
You can teach us to do new circus.
Americano style!

673
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:51,486
We find a new passion.

674
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:56,560
Make a new show.
And we go all the way to US and A!

675
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,199
I know. It is stupido idea.

676
00:46:08,373 --> 00:46:10,238
We are a lost cause.

677
00:46:12,411 --> 00:46:15,141
No, no, this isn't stupido.
This could work!

678
00:46:16,215 --> 00:46:18,080
- What?
- What you just said.

679
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:21,212
- What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.

680
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:23,354
- What?
- Your stupido idea!

681
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:26,389
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!

682
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:29,686
No, no, no, no.
I am only average intelligence.

683
00:46:29,861 --> 00:46:33,388
Some say I'm even slightly below.

684
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:37,001
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!

685
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,432
I call it Phase 4-7B,

686
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:41,629
wherein, in order to get home,

687
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,363
we will come up with something fresh,

688
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:45,941
something amazing,
something brand-new!

689
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,375
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!

690
00:46:49,547 --> 00:46:52,243
Something that'll blow
that circus promoter away!

691
00:46:54,118 --> 00:46:54,982
I missed.

692
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:58,053
- Off with your head!
- I'm gonna chew his leg off!

693
00:46:58,222 --> 00:47:00,622
Circus has been same for generations!

694
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:02,782
We make good,
classic family entertainment.

695
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,622
But last few generations,

696
00:47:05,796 --> 00:47:08,959
families... not so entertained.

697
00:47:11,802 --> 00:47:14,134
That's right.
Families not so entertained

698
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:16,865
because you're just going
through the motions out there.

699
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,941
It's missing passion.

700
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,739
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?

701
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:26,542
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?

702
00:47:27,485 --> 00:47:29,646
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.

703
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,618
You stopped pushing,
you stopped taking risks.

704
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,382
But those days are over.

705
00:47:34,558 --> 00:47:37,584
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.

706
00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:40,390
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?

707
00:47:40,564 --> 00:47:43,397
Circus is not about the acts you do.

708
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:46,092
Circus is in here.

709
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,500
How come Freddie gets all the circus?

710
00:47:48,673 --> 00:47:53,406
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!

711
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:57,640
You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!

712
00:47:57,815 --> 00:47:59,612
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,

713
00:47:59,784 --> 00:48:01,979
until those French Canadians
came along,

714
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:05,179
drunk off their maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,

715
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:07,517
and completely flipped the paradigm.

716
00:48:07,692 --> 00:48:12,857
Now they play Vegas.
Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.

717
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,123
And one of them
completely in the nude.

718
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:17,164
Yeah, that's right.
And you know how they did it?

719
00:48:17,335 --> 00:48:19,303
Take off their clothes?

720
00:48:20,705 --> 00:48:23,139
- No. They got rid of the animals.
- What?

721
00:48:23,307 --> 00:48:25,639
- Say it ain't so!
- Che stupida! No animals...

722
00:48:26,711 --> 00:48:28,838
- How could they?!
- Well, you know what I say to that!

723
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:31,277
I say they can take
the animals out of the circus,

724
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:37,285
but they cannot take
the animals out of the circus!

725
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:41,520
I mean, they cannot...

726
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:43,886
I think you understand what I'm saying!

727
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,823
- Yeah!
- Yes!

728
00:48:45,995 --> 00:48:46,984
No!

729
00:48:47,163 --> 00:48:50,394
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.

730
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,296
What does a human say
when he's passionate?

731
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:54,835
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!

732
00:48:57,073 --> 00:48:59,803
We'll make an all-animal circus!

733
00:48:59,976 --> 00:49:03,207
Because if we follow our passion,
we can go anywhere.

734
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,507
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!

735
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:08,344
- Anything!
- If we do it together!

736
00:49:08,518 --> 00:49:12,181
- All of us!
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah!

737
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:15,084
- Our circus!
- Yeah!

738
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:16,589
We're in! We'll have some of that!

739
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,091
Can I hear you say "fur power"?

740
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:19,853
Fur power!

741
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:22,657
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!

742
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:25,357
You and me, baby! An act together!

743
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:26,365
I love it!

744
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:28,663
We can do
that funk and groove dance thing!

745
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:30,863
- Dance?
- This thing right here. Look.

746
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,937
Me and you! We got this!

747
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,237
But I can't dance.

748
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:37,675
Fur power!

749
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:40,213
Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun!

750
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:45,377
I do not trust this lion.

751
00:49:45,555 --> 00:49:48,046
Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,

752
00:49:48,224 --> 00:49:52,388
but I am tired of sitting
and standing and rolling over.

753
00:49:52,562 --> 00:49:56,259
It is great tradition
of sitting, standing, rolling over.

754
00:49:56,433 --> 00:49:58,731
You know our circus is in trouble.

755
00:49:58,902 --> 00:50:04,135
This could be our last chance.
But we will not do this without you.

756
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:07,276
Circus always stay together.

757
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:17,552
OK. I do one hoop.

758
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:21,317
I want a hug, too!

759
00:50:39,843 --> 00:50:44,677
Attention! I have found our lion!
He is hiding with the circus!

760
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,991
Come on, Maurice, give it to me!

761
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:09,996
More boomstick, Rico!
I really want to fly!

762
00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:12,827
Are you really going
to shoot yourself out of that thing?

763
00:52:13,535 --> 00:52:17,869
I've always dreamed of doing this,
from time I was a little pup,

764
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,372
to be a human cannonball!

765
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:24,205
Except, you know...
a sea lion cannonball.

766
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:25,539
Is it dangerous?

767
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:29,273
Is it dangerous?
Yes, of course it's dangerous!

768
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:32,018
- Now, are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

769
00:52:32,187 --> 00:52:35,054
'Cause if blowing up is your thing,
then you in the right place.

770
00:52:35,223 --> 00:52:37,123
S? That's means yes!

771
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:38,589
Ready for launch?

772
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,523
Ready for launch!

773
00:52:42,464 --> 00:52:44,363
Fire in the hole!

774
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,089
Wait!

775
00:52:59,313 --> 00:53:01,076
Mamma mia!

776
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:02,738
Help me!

777
00:53:03,784 --> 00:53:06,617
Rico! Get the cannon ready!
Same charge!

778
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,657
Fire in the hole!

779
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,496
All right!

780
00:53:39,754 --> 00:53:41,119
Yeah!

781
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:49,089
Marty! I'm so glad you're here.

782
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:52,894
I was flying! I was effin'-L-Y-in'!

783
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,897
I'm proud of you, but...

784
00:53:55,102 --> 00:53:57,798
...I don't think
I can hold on much longer!

785
00:53:57,972 --> 00:54:00,839
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry about my enthusiasm.

786
00:54:01,776 --> 00:54:03,437
Here, wrap this around you.

787
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:10,940
All right, I got you! I got you!

788
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:23,630
Forget about being part of the herd!
I'm gonna be part of the flock!

789
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:25,629
I'm going to fly, baby!

790
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:28,291
Oh, yes! What a triumph!

791
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:31,671
- Hand over that circus, Freddie!
- I'll have your guts for garters!

792
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,534
Hey, hey, put your weapons down.

793
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,643
Guys, chill out. Cute and cuddly's
obviously not your thing.

794
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:38,073
He's got us pegged.

795
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:40,008
I got a better idea. Show 'em, Rico.

796
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:46,246
That was great!

797
00:54:48,354 --> 00:54:50,219
- Flippin' 'eck!
- Rocket shoes!

798
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,414
I want to try that!

799
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:53,525
Jonesy! Jonesy!

800
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,418
Hey. Hi.

801
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:57,825
I admire how you
have inspired these animals.

802
00:54:57,997 --> 00:54:58,895
Thanks.

803
00:54:59,065 --> 00:55:02,262
And what you said about passion,
it was like poetry.

804
00:55:02,435 --> 00:55:04,266
I love passion and poetry.
They go together, really.

805
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:05,267
I know they don't rhyme.

806
00:55:05,438 --> 00:55:07,201
Trapeze is my passion!

807
00:55:07,373 --> 00:55:08,863
Terrific. I look forward
to seeing you up there.

808
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:10,509
You can teach me!

809
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:11,939
- What?
- Teach me.

810
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:13,875
Well, I've always
been kind of a solo act.

811
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:15,605
So that kind of rules that out.

812
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:18,717
I wonder if you actually do trapeze.

813
00:55:18,885 --> 00:55:21,786
- Oh, I actually do do trapeze.
- Show me!

814
00:55:21,955 --> 00:55:24,116
"Show me"? What are we, five?

815
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,053
I am five, yes.

816
00:55:28,294 --> 00:55:29,784
Dancing.

817
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:32,693
All you're doing is moving
and not getting anywhere.

818
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:35,391
I mean, the music
totally throws off my timing.

819
00:55:35,568 --> 00:55:37,126
You want excitement?

820
00:55:37,303 --> 00:55:39,897
Check it out. Who's on a tightrope, huh?

821
00:55:40,073 --> 00:55:41,062
Who's on a...

822
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:45,806
I'm on a tightrope!
I'm on a tightrope!

823
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:47,276
Melman! Oh, my gosh!

824
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,074
- Help me!
- Baby, hold on. Hold on.

825
00:55:49,249 --> 00:55:50,978
I'm coming right now!

826
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,120
Melman?!

827
00:55:59,592 --> 00:56:00,752
Calm down, Melman.

828
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:03,088
I'm going to fall
and break all of my neck!

829
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:05,823
Just look at me. Look at me.

830
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:07,990
- All eyes on me.
- OK.

831
00:56:08,168 --> 00:56:10,102
- Come to me.
- I can't.

832
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,172
It's just like dancing, Melman.
Two steps forward, one step back.

833
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,776
I can't dance, OK? There, I said it.

834
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:19,468
Maybe because you've never tried.

835
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:21,773
No, I have tried.

836
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:24,974
I practiced in private
because you dance so well.

837
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:27,779
You practiced? For me?

838
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:29,751
Yes, but it's no use.

839
00:56:29,923 --> 00:56:31,584
I never know
what to do with my arms.

840
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:34,657
Hold it.

841
00:56:34,828 --> 00:56:37,319
That part is so easy, Melman. OK?

842
00:56:37,497 --> 00:56:40,466
'Cause all you have to do
is put them around your partner.

843
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:43,798
See? Two steps forward.

844
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,631
One step back.

845
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:48,467
- I'm dancing. I'm dancing!
- Two steps forward...

846
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:51,541
- We're dancing on a tightrope!
- You're great.

847
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,371
I'm dancing!

848
00:56:56,215 --> 00:56:57,477
OK.

849
00:56:59,218 --> 00:57:00,310
All right.

850
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:03,818
So when do we get
the jet packs and aquatic cobras?

851
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:06,685
This is a beginners' class,
and that's a pretty advanced maneuver.

852
00:57:06,859 --> 00:57:08,019
OK, how do we begin?

853
00:57:08,193 --> 00:57:10,354
It's a bit complicated
unless you understand

854
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:13,896
the whole pitch and yaw...
arc and gravity.

855
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:18,162
All that stuff,
which I won't bore you with. OK.

856
00:57:18,337 --> 00:57:20,032
- Do you need a push?
- No.

857
00:57:21,006 --> 00:57:22,530
Just watch and learn!

858
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:33,844
Like that?

859
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:36,146
That's one way of doing it, sure.

860
00:57:45,597 --> 00:57:47,064
You use a net!

861
00:57:47,232 --> 00:57:49,928
Yes! Trapeze americano. We use the net.

862
00:57:54,273 --> 00:57:56,741
Trapeze americano!

863
00:58:12,591 --> 00:58:13,888
Look at him go!

864
00:58:28,807 --> 00:58:30,138
Wow!

865
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:40,482
E bravo! Bravissima!

866
00:58:40,652 --> 00:58:44,486
Hey, Vitaly,
maybe you even do two hoops, no?

867
00:58:48,827 --> 00:58:50,488
Seorita Bell-bottoms.

868
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:52,959
Tenemos una problema grande.

869
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,428
Qu? Qu?grande problema?

870
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:01,928
Oh, no! She's onto us!

871
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:04,165
Don't make it any easier on the psycho.

872
00:59:04,342 --> 00:59:07,038
- What are we gonna do?
- We'd better vamoose... pronto.

873
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,337
But we're not ready.
We're in the middle of rehearsals.

874
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:10,810
Then why don't you lilt over,

875
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:14,110
grab your peduncle,
and kiss New York good-bye?

876
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:16,344
Are you sure we are ready?

877
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,182
Of course we're ready! Born ready!
Ready steady! Come on, let's go!

878
00:59:19,357 --> 00:59:20,619
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

879
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:24,522
All right, you heard the cat.
Move it! Come on! All aboard!

880
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:26,663
Grab your luggage
and drain your bladders.

881
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:28,856
It's going to be a long ride!

882
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:39,301
All right, everybody,
let's blow that promoter away!

883
00:59:39,477 --> 00:59:40,876
London, here we come!

884
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:43,707
Sunshiny London, yes!

885
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:07,736
Vitaly! Vitaly! Vitaly!

886
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:37,832
Come on, come on, come on.
Where is he?

887
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,469
Bingo!

888
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:44,232
If that's not a red-blooded
American promoter, I don't know what is.

889
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:47,900
We need to get this show on the road.
Private! Tell them the eagle has landed.

890
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,410
The eagle has landed!

891
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,071
Roger that.
And keep an eye out for Dubois.

892
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,079
Aye, aye, guvnor!

893
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,682
The promoter is in the house!

894
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,285
New York is closer than ever!

895
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,545
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

896
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,915
First, we got a circus to do.
We're on, folks!

897
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,524
- Do we go on before or after the dogs?
- Yes.

898
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,421
- What?
- Overlap, your acts overlap.

899
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,154
- Where's Vitaly? He opens.
- I don't know.

900
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,958
Stefano! Hey, Stefano!
Have you seen Vitaly?

901
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,128
Hey.

902
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,869
Stefano, why the sad little face?

903
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,736
Vitaly... he will not go on!

904
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:20,739
What?

905
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,810
I tried everything I could.

906
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,539
Wipe away the tears. Calm down.

907
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,120
Where is he?
I'm sure I can reason with him.

908
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:35,081
Vitaly, what are you doing?

909
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,384
You missed.

910
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,653
You're leaving? You're just gonna
walk out on everybody?

911
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,558
They have good show without me.

912
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:44,894
Look, I got a good left foot,
but without my right foot, I can't walk.

913
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,558
You get fake foot, then you walk.

914
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,136
I don't want fake foot! OK?

915
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,797
What happened to "circus stick
together"? "The show must go on."

916
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:54,307
Clichs.

917
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,637
Come on, man.
Stop being this guy! Be the other guy!

918
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:58,974
What other guy?

919
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:02,175
The guy who was all circus!
The guy who jumped through hoops!

920
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:04,843
Give me that!
The guy everybody looked up to.

921
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,088
Come on. Where's that Vitaly?

922
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:15,427
That Vitaly is no more.

923
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:19,262
Listen, man.
You may have given up on yourself,

924
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,835
but your friends
haven't given up on you.

925
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:24,439
Are you just going
to turn your back on them,

926
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:27,167
and sit and eat borscht
the rest of your life?

927
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:31,876
Or are you gonna get out there
and jump through that tiny little hoop?

928
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,947
It is impossible.

929
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:42,887
It was always impossible, Vitaly.
That's why the people loved it.

930
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,454
That is why I loved it.

931
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,929
Because I did the impossible!

932
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,636
I was once a brave tiger.

933
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,108
And if I go down in flames...

934
01:03:01,977 --> 01:03:03,205
...so be it!

935
01:03:03,812 --> 01:03:08,010
You know, I think
I might have an idea for you.

936
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,488
Light the hoop on fire!

937
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:46,680
Mamma mia, Santa Maria, Santa Maria...

938
01:03:49,558 --> 01:03:52,493
Mamma Maria, mia Santa,
Santa Mia Farrow...

939
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:55,122
Come on, you got it.

940
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:07,097
Yes!

941
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:17,080
All right, what are you waiting for?
We got a show to put on.

942
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:18,981
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go!

943
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:37,265
Look!

944
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:29,281
We're going to America!

945
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,112
Today!

946
01:06:31,285 --> 01:06:33,947
That's what I call crack-a-lackin'
to the mack-a-lackin'!

947
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:35,611
- We did it, Alice!
- Yeah!

948
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,951
Maybe I am
average intelligence after all!

949
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:40,252
Perhaps even slightly above.

950
01:06:41,295 --> 01:06:42,785
No, I don't think so.

951
01:06:43,464 --> 01:06:46,456
Hair conditioner. Great idea, my friend!

952
01:06:46,634 --> 01:06:49,125
Feel. Go ahead. Soft like kitten, no?

953
01:06:49,303 --> 01:06:50,702
Look at that.

954
01:06:50,871 --> 01:06:51,895
Slippery but not flammable.

955
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:55,132
You smell like peaches and herb!

956
01:06:56,877 --> 01:06:59,971
Gia and Alex, the trapezing cats!

957
01:07:00,147 --> 01:07:01,443
We did pretty good.

958
01:07:01,614 --> 01:07:03,241
You will flip, and I will catch.

959
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:05,509
And sometimes I will flip,
and you will catch.

960
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:10,246
And then we will both flip,
and we'll travel the whole world!

961
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:13,319
Flipping and catching,
and I will flip you...

962
01:07:18,231 --> 01:07:20,096
You know, the thing is...

963
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:23,764
I may not always be around.

964
01:07:23,937 --> 01:07:24,835
Where are you going?

965
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:27,131
Well, I'm... I'm... I'm...

966
01:07:29,843 --> 01:07:31,504
Bravo, bravo!

967
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:35,674
What a heartwarming performance,
Monsieur Circus Master.

968
01:07:35,849 --> 01:07:37,976
It brought tears to my eyes.

969
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:40,008
No, not really.

970
01:07:41,788 --> 01:07:44,450
Monsieur, we both know
the lion does not belong to you.

971
01:07:44,624 --> 01:07:46,182
It's that horrid woman!

972
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:49,123
He is a fugitive from justice.

973
01:07:49,295 --> 01:07:50,956
You will turn the lion over to me

974
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:53,690
so that I may put him
where he belongs.

975
01:07:56,636 --> 01:07:58,263
On my wall.

976
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:04,968
- What?
- lncoming!

977
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:13,242
Outgoing!

978
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:14,249
Wait!

979
01:08:18,858 --> 01:08:20,052
Up high!

980
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:21,716
Down low. Too slow.

981
01:08:21,895 --> 01:08:23,487
- Well done, Private.
- Did I do good?

982
01:08:23,663 --> 01:08:25,187
Nah, not really.

983
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:27,728
Man, that was close!

984
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:29,232
Alex?

985
01:08:29,869 --> 01:08:31,734
You are from a zoo?

986
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:39,936
Yes. Yes. But wait, there's more.

987
01:08:40,146 --> 01:08:41,807
- More?
- Or less. There's less.

988
01:08:41,948 --> 01:08:43,916
You were never circus?

989
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,017
We had to say we were circus.

990
01:08:46,185 --> 01:08:47,812
Or you'd never have let us on the train!

991
01:08:47,987 --> 01:08:51,423
After all we have
been through together...

992
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:54,082
...you want to go live in a zoo?

993
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,160
- Gia, l...
- You used us.

994
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:57,694
No, no, no. I mean, yes, but...

995
01:08:57,864 --> 01:09:00,230
Trapeze americano,
you make that up, too?

996
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,867
It didn't exactly exist
when I taught it to you.

997
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:07,369
Jet packs and aquatic cobras!
I should have known.

998
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:11,600
Balloons to the children of the world
was not real, either?

999
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,904
Yeah, that's not real.
But look at what we did.

1000
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:18,106
I was shot out of a cannon!
I could have died!

1001
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,782
But I thought it was
your lifelong dream.

1002
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:25,720
For all I know,
your name is not even Alice.

1003
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:29,685
No, Stefano, but it never really was.

1004
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,624
I don't feel safe!

1005
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:35,894
Gia, l...

1006
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:38,796
We trusted you.

1007
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:43,740
My tears are real!

1008
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:45,240
You are not!

1009
01:09:48,213 --> 01:09:52,479
I can't believe you lied
to all us circus folk.

1010
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:57,485
Me? Stay with the circus?

1011
01:09:57,656 --> 01:10:02,753
I am a king! I want to rule New York!
We should talk.

1012
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:05,127
Whoa!

1013
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:10,259
Stop it! No means no!
Or in your language...

1014
01:10:11,937 --> 01:10:14,497
Not everything
is solved that way, you know.

1015
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:21,912
Sonya? Are you listening to me?

1016
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:25,180
Now I'm getting
the silent treatment, am l?

1017
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,511
Come over here, right now!

1018
01:10:29,688 --> 01:10:31,622
Don't shut me out, baby!

1019
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,451
What is wrong with you? Speak!

1020
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:41,158
OK... if these are your feelings,
I understand now.

1021
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,994
And I'm going!

1022
01:10:43,168 --> 01:10:47,798
It's obvious I'm just an emotional
whoopee cushion for you to sit on!

1023
01:10:48,974 --> 01:10:50,942
When you look for where I am,

1024
01:10:51,109 --> 01:10:53,043
I won't be there!

1025
01:11:18,536 --> 01:11:21,096
Come, everybody.
We have show to do.

1026
01:11:21,305 --> 01:11:24,502
But how do I go on without Marty?

1027
01:11:24,675 --> 01:11:26,506
- Stefano.
- I don't know what to do.

1028
01:11:26,677 --> 01:11:28,975
You can still do cannon solo.

1029
01:11:29,146 --> 01:11:33,674
But... I want to do solo act with Marty!

1030
01:11:34,251 --> 01:11:35,878
And what do I do?

1031
01:11:36,053 --> 01:11:39,853
Go back to sitting
and standing and rolling over?

1032
01:11:40,558 --> 01:11:42,025
No.

1033
01:11:42,193 --> 01:11:45,594
We can do impossible!

1034
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:48,994
And we never go back
to way we used to be.

1035
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:52,499
The way it used to be
isn't the way it was.

1036
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:58,006
And it won't be the same without them,
whatever way it is.

1037
01:12:17,261 --> 01:12:20,230
Well... we're here.

1038
01:12:22,733 --> 01:12:24,064
Home.

1039
01:12:26,237 --> 01:12:29,070
My rock looks smaller
than I remember it.

1040
01:12:30,074 --> 01:12:31,735
Look at the mural.

1041
01:12:32,576 --> 01:12:35,739
Doesn't actually capture
the real thing, does it?

1042
01:12:36,914 --> 01:12:38,074
Wow.

1043
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,083
I forgot about that wall
in between us, Melman.

1044
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:45,789
Was that always there?

1045
01:12:51,095 --> 01:12:55,759
Guys, I'm sorry
I ever left the zoo in the first place.

1046
01:12:55,933 --> 01:12:57,423
What do you mean?

1047
01:12:57,601 --> 01:13:00,434
I mean, if I had just stayed put,

1048
01:13:00,604 --> 01:13:03,505
we wouldn't have
anything to be sad about right now.

1049
01:13:05,843 --> 01:13:10,176
Leaving the zoo was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1050
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:13,112
Really?

1051
01:13:13,283 --> 01:13:17,310
Yeah. Out there, in the world,
we were really living.

1052
01:13:17,487 --> 01:13:18,852
- Yeah!
- It was exciting!

1053
01:13:19,022 --> 01:13:21,149
- It was romantic.
- It was dangerous.

1054
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:22,814
I never felt so alive!

1055
01:13:22,992 --> 01:13:26,291
When we were with the circus,
we were already home.

1056
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:29,788
I only wish we'd realized that sooner.

1057
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,428
I'm really going to miss those guys.

1058
01:13:34,337 --> 01:13:37,135
What do you say we go back?

1059
01:13:37,307 --> 01:13:38,137
Really?

1060
01:13:38,308 --> 01:13:39,536
- I'm with you!
- I'm in!

1061
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:41,199
But what do we tell them?

1062
01:13:41,377 --> 01:13:44,346
We make it right by telling them
how wrong we were.

1063
01:13:44,514 --> 01:13:45,344
It's worth a shot.

1064
01:13:45,515 --> 01:13:48,712
And if we go down in flames, so be it!

1065
01:13:48,885 --> 01:13:50,375
- Yes, let's do this!
- I like it!

1066
01:13:50,553 --> 01:13:51,645
Yeah, yeah!

1067
01:13:51,821 --> 01:13:54,187
Is my neck getting longer?

1068
01:13:54,357 --> 01:13:56,325
Feel my fur. It's so soft.

1069
01:13:56,492 --> 01:13:58,050
It is soft.

1070
01:13:58,228 --> 01:14:02,824
I'm like a candy cane
in a black and white movie.

1071
01:14:03,967 --> 01:14:05,161
Oh, no.

1072
01:14:05,835 --> 01:14:07,166
Dubois.

1073
01:14:07,503 --> 01:14:11,803
Sonya, I miss you, baby!
I miss my stinky bear!

1074
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:14,967
Babe... your fishy kisses!

1075
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:18,002
Surprise!

1076
01:14:20,216 --> 01:14:22,582
He will never fit in the carry-on.

1077
01:14:22,752 --> 01:14:25,152
But his head will!

1078
01:14:26,756 --> 01:14:27,916
- Hey!
- Qu'est-ce Que c'est?

1079
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:30,321
Look! Look what she's done!

1080
01:14:30,493 --> 01:14:32,427
You brought back Alex the lion!

1081
01:14:32,595 --> 01:14:35,359
- It's a miracle!
- Thank you! Thank you!

1082
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:37,192
Sonya, where are you?

1083
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:39,096
Sonya!

1084
01:14:39,269 --> 01:14:40,429
Excuse me.

1085
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:44,570
Sonya, baby!

1086
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,606
I don't want to be king anymore!

1087
01:14:46,776 --> 01:14:49,108
I was so hung up on who I was...

1088
01:14:49,379 --> 01:14:51,939
...who you was...
what you smelled like...

1089
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:56,449
...when all that really matters
is what we smell like together.

1090
01:14:58,955 --> 01:15:00,286
I know!

1091
01:15:00,456 --> 01:15:02,117
Baby, forgive me.

1092
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:03,725
Oh, hello?

1093
01:15:03,893 --> 01:15:05,121
Gasp! It's Dubois!

1094
01:15:05,295 --> 01:15:06,284
Baba booey!

1095
01:15:07,297 --> 01:15:08,423
Where did you get this?

1096
01:15:08,598 --> 01:15:09,565
I got it from the zoo.

1097
01:15:09,732 --> 01:15:11,596
The hippies got ambushed!

1098
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:13,735
What? We have to help them!

1099
01:15:13,902 --> 01:15:15,028
But they lied to us!

1100
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:16,694
Yeah. Why should we lift a paw?

1101
01:15:16,872 --> 01:15:18,339
They are our friends!

1102
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,064
They're not even circus!

1103
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:23,137
That's Bolshevik!

1104
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:29,042
I never thought I'd say this
on American soil, but the Russki's right!

1105
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:38,483
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1106
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,592
Oh, no.

1107
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:40,853
Alex?

1108
01:15:41,063 --> 01:15:42,462
Where are you?

1109
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:44,599
Gloria! Are you OK?

1110
01:15:44,766 --> 01:15:47,462
- What is happening?
- Alex!

1111
01:15:47,636 --> 01:15:49,763
- No, no! No, no!
- Alex the lion!

1112
01:15:49,938 --> 01:15:51,428
No!

1113
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:02,617
Thank you. Thank you all for coming
to this special celebration.

1114
01:16:02,784 --> 01:16:05,810
And now, the woman
who made this all possible,

1115
01:16:05,988 --> 01:16:08,149
who brought Alex the lion
and a couple of...

1116
01:16:08,323 --> 01:16:09,654
...three?

1117
01:16:09,825 --> 01:16:12,259
Three other animals back to New York.

1118
01:16:12,427 --> 01:16:14,019
And she's French.

1119
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:17,025
Please welcome Chantal Dubois!

1120
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:49,797
Alex?

1121
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:02,041
It was never about the money.

1122
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:05,375
It was about...

1123
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:08,312
...the lion.

1124
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:21,259
- Gia?
- Circus stick together.

1125
01:17:23,731 --> 01:17:27,223
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, circus
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, Afro

1126
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:30,063
Circus Afro, Circus Afro
Polka dot, polka dot!

1127
01:17:30,237 --> 01:17:32,262
Look! A flying circus!

1128
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,771
No!

1129
01:17:38,045 --> 01:17:41,776
Operation Afro-Circus Rescue... engage!

1130
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,348
Aye, aye, Skipper!

1131
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,108
Unleash the seal.

1132
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,915
- I am a sea lion!
- Whatever.

1133
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,521
Two tons of fun. Dive, dive, dive!

1134
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,402
Let's rock.

1135
01:18:03,571 --> 01:18:05,095
You and me, baby!

1136
01:18:24,725 --> 01:18:25,589
Wow!

1137
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,628
Suck in that gut!

1138
01:18:39,273 --> 01:18:40,672
I am impressed!

1139
01:18:51,485 --> 01:18:54,420
Mission accomplished.
Now let's get out of here!

1140
01:18:54,588 --> 01:18:56,852
- Wait! Wait for me!
- Stefano!

1141
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,958
Don't leave without me!

1142
01:19:04,498 --> 01:19:05,829
Oh, no!

1143
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:12,930
Go, Stefano!

1144
01:19:13,107 --> 01:19:14,835
Climb!

1145
01:19:21,481 --> 01:19:22,573
Come on, my friend!

1146
01:19:24,017 --> 01:19:25,143
Stefano!

1147
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:27,643
Help me!

1148
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:30,513
I will have your head!

1149
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:32,055
Oh, no! Help me!

1150
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:33,487
Alex!

1151
01:19:40,033 --> 01:19:41,660
Marty! Shoot me a line.

1152
01:19:41,834 --> 01:19:45,167
You got it. Afro, don't fail me now!

1153
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,066
What are you doing?

1154
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:52,734
We are doing trapeze americano.

1155
01:19:52,912 --> 01:19:54,573
Let's do it!

1156
01:19:55,682 --> 01:19:57,673
- Frankie, Jonesy! Be ready!
- You got it, boss!

1157
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,181
Go, go, go!

1158
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:12,087
Gia! Take Stefano!

1159
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:13,357
Alex!

1160
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:26,571
Aquatic cobras!

1161
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,943
If I am going down,
your head is coming with me!

1162
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,880
I don't think so!

1163
01:20:33,386 --> 01:20:34,580
Oi, let's go!

1164
01:20:36,189 --> 01:20:38,555
You're going down,
but not with my head.

1165
01:20:41,561 --> 01:20:43,756
Jet pack! He pull up!

1166
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:46,728
Your days of chasing animals
are over, Dubois!

1167
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:48,958
Because you've just messed
with the king!

1168
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:00,602
This is where animals like you belong!
Now sit!

1169
01:21:02,582 --> 01:21:03,571
Lie down.

1170
01:21:04,751 --> 01:21:05,740
Naughty me.

1171
01:21:05,918 --> 01:21:07,078
Roll over.

1172
01:21:09,055 --> 01:21:10,147
Good, Dubois.

1173
01:21:10,423 --> 01:21:11,447
Now stay!

1174
01:21:18,297 --> 01:21:20,822
We did it!

1175
01:21:26,305 --> 01:21:28,796
Balloons to the children of the world!

1176
01:21:28,974 --> 01:21:30,771
Trapeze americano!

1177
01:21:30,942 --> 01:21:33,467
- It is real.
- It's real!

1178
01:21:42,154 --> 01:21:44,179
That's how you do it!

1179
01:21:45,157 --> 01:21:48,786
So you want to run away
with the circus?

1180
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:51,526
- Live a life of adventure?
- Full of romance?

1181
01:21:51,697 --> 01:21:53,858
- And danger!
- Really living!

1182
01:21:54,032 --> 01:21:55,465
What do you say?

1183
01:21:57,869 --> 01:22:00,531
# Ra-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, circus!

1184
01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:03,197
# Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, Afro!

1185
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:07,311
# Circus Afro, Circus Afro!
Polka dot, polka dot, polka dot, Afro!

1186
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:10,880
# I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

1187
01:22:11,049 --> 01:22:13,813
# I like to move it, move it
You like to...

1188
01:22:13,985 --> 01:22:15,350
# Move it!

1189
01:22:17,923 --> 01:22:21,825
<i>Skipper, what did you end up doing
with the crazy lady, anyway?</i>
