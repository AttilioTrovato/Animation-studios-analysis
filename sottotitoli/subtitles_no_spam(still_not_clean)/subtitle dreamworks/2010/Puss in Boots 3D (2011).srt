1
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,664
Through the years,
I have been known by many names.

2
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,376
Diablo Gato.

3
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,962
The Furry Lover.

4
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,381
Chupacabra.

5
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,051
Friskie Two-Times.

6
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,386
And the Ginger Hit Man.

7
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,767
But to most... I am Puss In Boots!

8
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,561
Outlaw.

9
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,265
I will never forget you... Margherita.

10
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,768
I mean, Rosa.

11
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,980
Sorry. I think maybe I should go.

12
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,646
You cannot run forever,

13
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,982
Puss In Boots!

14
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,326
What can I say? I was a bad kitty.

15
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,335
Just a fugitive from the law...
forever running.

16
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,088
Searching for a way to clear my name.

17
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,010
And I would get that chance...

18
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,014
...on this one fateful night.

19
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,231
Here, kitty, kitty!

20
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:54,901
Raoul.

21
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,737
Look what the cat dragged in.

22
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,907
Oh, wait... That is the cat!

23
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,247
One leche, please.

24
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:15,088
What are you doing here, señor?
Did you lose your ball of yarn?

25
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,302
So funny.

26
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,596
One leche coming up.

27
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,779
I am not looking for trouble.

28
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,788
I am but a humble gato
in search of his next meal.

29
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,417
Perhaps you gentlemen
can help me find a simple score?

30
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:57,464
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble... Puss In Boots.

31
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:12,312
Well, perhaps if one of us were to
tell the law that you are in town,

32
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,814
we could split the reward.

33
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,618
You made the cat angry.

34
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,829
You do not want to make the cat angry!

35
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,084
The Church of St. Michael
has just put up a golden statue

36
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,669
of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

37
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,671
I do not steal from churches.

38
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,758
The boys' orphanage has been donated
silver candlesticks,

39
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,551
they would look very lovely
in your home.

40
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,553
I do not steal from orphans.

41
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,680
What about Jack and Jill?

42
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,850
- Shh! Are you crazy?
- The what?

43
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,440
The murderous outlaws Jack and Jill

44
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,610
have gotten their hands on...
magic beans.

45
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,238
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

46
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,909
I searched half my life for them.
They do not exist.

47
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:11,246
No, cat. We have seen them.

48
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,583
These... are the beans of legend.

49
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,506
Grows a vine to the Land of Giants,

50
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:24,425
and the Golden Goose.

51
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,177
The Golden Goose...

52
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,264
A heist like this
could set you up for life.

53
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,266
All nine of them.

54
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,560
Show him the golden eggs.

55
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,103
No!

56
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:38,064
Please, you have shown enough.

57
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:43,111
Only a cat with a death wish would
steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

58
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:49,784
The only wish I have
is to repay an old debt.

59
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,953
And this is my chance.

60
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,455
Now...

61
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,625
...where do I find this Jack and Jill?

62
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,622
I'm sorry... we have no rooms.

63
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,212
Well, I think one just opened up.

64
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,678
We'd like a complimentary
continental breakfast.

65
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,223
And don't even think about skimpin'
on them baby muffins.

66
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,859
We don't have any baby muffins.

67
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,324
You know, Jill...

68
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,618
...I been thinking.

69
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,036
Get it out.

70
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:19,207
I... Once we're done
with this magic bean business

71
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,543
and got ourselves
all them beautiful golden eggs...

72
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,045
Go on.

73
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,965
...that we cut down on some
of the hijacking and murdering.

74
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,718
I mean, it's fun and all, but...

75
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,098
...I want a baby.

76
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,563
A baby what, Jack?

77
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:47,276
A baby us, Jill. We'll raise it wild,
like a squirrel or something.

78
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,030
Holy frijoles!

79
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,032
They do exist.

80
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,952
Ever since you fell down that hill
and broke your crown,

81
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,620
you have been talking crazy.

82
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,628
It couldn't hurt to have
an extra shooter during ambushes.

83
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,006
Maybe I cut too deep...
cut that brain out of your head.

84
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,927
Hey! What gives?

85
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,223
If it's to be a girl,
she'll have your strong...

86
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,434
No! No! No!

87
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,645
You, you, you! You stop where you are!

88
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,566
I don't know, Jack. How do I ride and
shoot with a baby slung on my back?

89
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:30,111
They got them backpacks now.
The way I see it, Jill...

90
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,114
Those beans are mine!

91
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,659
...we fall off this flat earth one time.
What better proof of our love...

92
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,827
Me?

93
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,706
You snap me?

94
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,460
You snap me?!

95
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,308
You looking for something?

96
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,315
No.

97
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,609
No hablo inglés.

98
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,532
You are going to pay for this!

99
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,317
No!

100
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,950
Chupacabra!

101
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,952
Chupacabra! Chupacabra!

102
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,538
- Chupacabra!
- You are a crazy woman!

103
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,595
Those magic beans were my score!

104
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,848
You just cost me a chance
at getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.

105
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,100
Put up your dukes.

106
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,396
Very well.

107
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,357
If it is to be a dance fight,

108
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,902
then I will Tuesday-Night-Dance-Fight
you to the death!

109
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,176
How dare you do the Litter Box at me!

110
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,137
Hello!

111
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,912
Can you feel me?

112
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,934
Fear me... if you dare.

113
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,135
You hit me in the head with a guitar?!

114
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,221
You are a woman?

115
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,187
Amateur.

116
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,564
Wow!

117
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,943
Señorita, wait!

118
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,991
Let me buy you some leche!
I am a lover, not a fighter.

119
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,247
Hello?

120
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,291
You are hiding from me?

121
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,044
I like to play the games, too.

122
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:07,258
I sense in you a kindred spirit, a...

123
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,264
I smell something familiar.

124
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,185
Something... dangerous.

125
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,729
Something...

126
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,815
...breakfasty.

127
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,235
It's been a long time, brother.

128
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,949
Maldito huevo.

129
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,248
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

130
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,418
How dare you show your face to me.

131
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,089
I know you're angry.
You have every right.

132
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,759
But it is good to see you, Puss.

133
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,344
Are those new boots?

134
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:57,099
No! They are the same boots I wore
when you betrayed me.

135
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,685
Betrayed you?

136
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,314
You left me cracked in pieces
on a bridge, surrounded by soldiers!

137
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,732
They wrote a song about it!

138
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,068
And how did we get on that bridge
in the first place?!

139
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,113
Because we were brothers, and brothers
are supposed to look after each other...

140
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,448
Humpty!

141
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,702
Remember why we're here.

142
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,371
I should have known.

143
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,458
I had the magic beans in my grasp,

144
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:27,296
and you sent this very attractive
devil woman to interfere.

145
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,298
You are a curse on my life!

146
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,050
Wait. Hear me out. OK?

147
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,761
Yes, yes,
I sent Kitty to bring you here.

148
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,096
But she is no ordinary thief.

149
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,558
She's Kitty Softpaws.

150
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,894
The softest touch in Spain.

151
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,022
That's a lot of heel for a guy,
don't you think?

152
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,987
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain,

153
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,739
we've got a fighting chance here.

154
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,825
Puss, come on, you of all people
know that nobody's ever ripped off

155
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,536
the giant's castle
and lived to tell the tale.

156
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,956
You want to survive? You need a plan.

157
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:07,503
And I've studied this job my whole life.
You know that.

158
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,797
Let's be honest.

159
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,466
Without me, you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

160
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,886
But Jack and Jill do.
They're on their way.

161
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:22,309
We go up the beanstalk outlaws,
and we come down legends.

162
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,313
So what do you say?

163
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,315
Partners?

164
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,988
No. Never again.

165
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:39,493
I'm sorry, OK?
How long are you gonna hold a grudge?

166
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,831
It's been seven years!
That's like 35 cat years.

167
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,501
You need me! And I need you.

168
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:53,632
Puss! You got any idea what they do
to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

169
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,014
I'll tell you this, my friend.

170
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,017
It ain't over easy.

171
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,691
Adiós... Humpty Dumpty.

172
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,866
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

173
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:23,370
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I know how to speak meow.

174
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,248
...sad story with your twisted lies

175
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,293
in your greasy shell
that smells like old ham!

176
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,670
I should crack you open for...

177
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,558
Look what I found.

178
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,562
Someone forgot his money.

179
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,735
Oh, you are dangerous.

180
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,654
Humpty says you like danger.

181
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:04,495
Just think of all the trouble
we can get into.

182
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,750
The two of us together.

183
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:13,921
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

184
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,429
And... you owe me.

185
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,932
I owe you?

186
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,102
You hit me in the head with a guitar.

187
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,270
I regret the guitar.

188
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,940
OK, I forgive you.

189
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,442
So... you're in?

190
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,782
There is one teeny, tiny,
itty-bitty problem.

191
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,617
And what is that?

192
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,787
You work for the egg!

193
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:52,126
Come on, Puss. What happened between
you and Humpty that was so bad?

194
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,131
I am afraid with me and Humpty...

195
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,426
...the scars are too deep.

196
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,933
It all started a long time ago.

197
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,894
Oh, no. You really don't have to tell me
your whole life story, please.

198
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,896
You may want to sit.

199
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:18,152
It is at times quite... painful.

200
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,154
OK, here we go.

201
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,658
It was a year
in which the rain had not fallen.

202
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,163
The wind was big
and the basket was small.

203
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,582
For days, I bounced along...

204
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,502
...a hungry little kitten
with no milk, no mama,

205
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,504
and no litter box.

206
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:42,176
Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children.

207
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,686
Her name was Imelda.

208
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:57,316
And, like a mother, she took me
into her heart and raised me as her own.

209
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,778
Silencio.

210
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,739
Silencio.

211
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,116
She was an angel of kindness.

212
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,202
¡Silencio!

213
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,454
Most of the time.

214
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:14,208
I'd like to introduce
a new boy joining us.

215
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:18,045
It's OK, pequeño.
You show with the face.

216
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,300
Go on.

217
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:32,142
And that was the moment I met...

218
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,269
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

219
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,857
Hey, Whiskers! You're sitting
in Little Boy Blue's chair.

220
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,485
Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

221
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,654
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

222
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,614
Who asked you, Breakfast?

223
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,282
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue:

224
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,536
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

225
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,954
Let's spin him.

226
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,373
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

227
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,959
Not again! No! I'm going to yolk!

228
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,796
Even though he took my beans,
the egg stood up for me,

229
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,756
and I decided then...

230
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,342
...that I would always have his back.

231
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,767
Wow!

232
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,270
That was very impressive. Thanks!

233
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,855
Hey, egg boy!

234
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:25,862
There was something about this
strange little egg that intrigued me.

235
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,258
Oh... it's you.
I've been collecting for months now.

236
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,885
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

237
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,307
Magic beans... is what they are.

238
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:55,934
Hello?

239
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,895
You gonna tell all the other kids
that I believe in magic now?

240
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,856
Is that what you're gonna do?

241
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,484
No? What's your name?

242
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,654
You don't say much, do you?

243
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,240
I think I'll call you Sparky.

244
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,576
Whiskers?

245
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,994
Zoltar!

246
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,414
How about Puss?

247
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,628
Humpty's mind
was full of imagination and invention.

248
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,421
What is that, 50 feet down there?

249
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,132
Here we go. Give me a...

250
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,009
Puss!

251
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,722
Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

252
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,354
He spoke of legends and adventures
beyond my wildest dreams.

253
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,899
When I find those magic beans,
they'll grow a vine

254
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,151
straight up into the clouds,

255
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,656
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

256
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,325
...the Golden Goose.

257
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,786
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

258
00:24:55,953 --> 00:25:00,582
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

259
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,251
It's my destiny, Puss.

260
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,423
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

261
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,597
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

262
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,767
This is kind of a solo dream here.

263
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,771
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

264
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,899
What are you doing?

265
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:31,571
Oh, man, that's good. The eye thing that
you're doing, that is really splendid.

266
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,617
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

267
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,203
This is crazy, but...

268
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,540
...I am considering a partnership.

269
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,043
I just need to know one thing.

270
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,421
Can you commit?

271
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,798
Sí... I can commit.

272
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,385
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

273
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:56,972
OK...

274
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,142
First rule of Bean Club...

275
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,479
...you do not talk about Bean Club.

276
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,732
Second rule of Bean Club...

277
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,944
...is you don't talk about Bean Club.
You ready?

278
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,195
Ready.

279
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,699
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

280
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:19,035
Never alone, always together...

281
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,537
Humpty and Puss...

282
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,330
Brothers forever.

283
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,791
And from that moment on,

284
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:29,129
we were united on a great adventure
to find the magic beans.

285
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,380
Help me up.

286
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,048
Egg me.

287
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,301
Humpty was the brains...

288
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,928
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

289
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,639
- That really hurt!
- ...and I was the skill.

290
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,142
I'm cracked!

291
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:49,065
We got red beans, green beans, coffee
beans, lima beans... but no magic beans.

292
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,152
Would you care for a jelly bean?

293
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,487
Thank you.

294
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,490
Finding them meant everything to us.

295
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,659
I almost forgot
the most important thing.

296
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,912
That's me and you, Puss.

297
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,915
Me and you.

298
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,584
But we never did find them.

299
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:11,004
And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans

300
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:15,425
seemed more and more
like the dreams of a child.

301
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,514
As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...

302
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,849
...and often found it.

303
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:27,187
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time is jail time.

304
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,564
They're just kids.

305
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,359
They are thieves.

306
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,199
You are better than this.

307
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,536
I believe in you with all my heart.

308
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,455
Please do not let me down.

309
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,794
I hate this place.
I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

310
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,589
Throw a rock.
It'll make you feel better.

311
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,635
Oh, boy. We should go.

312
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,723
On instinct, I reacted.

313
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,697
He saved the Comandante's mother!

314
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,199
He saved the Comandante's mother!

315
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,666
You saved my mother.

316
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:33,420
Señor Puss... he is a hero!

317
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:41,094
Today we see that courage and bravery
come in all sizes!

318
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,807
Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.

319
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,560
These are for you, my boy.

320
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,607
Wear them as a symbol of honor...
and justice.

321
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,527
I will make you proud, Mama.

322
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:02,741
You already have, my Puss In Boots.

323
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:08,288
How strange it was
to give a cat boots...

324
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,625
...but, whoa... I looked good!

325
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,628
And as the light of my path
grew brighter...

326
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:19,132
...Humpty's road grew ever darker.

327
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,307
Gracias, Comandante.

328
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,893
Be careful of the company you keep.

329
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:35,065
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

330
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,735
You're not stealing lollipops anymore,
Humpty. This is getting serious.

331
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,279
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

332
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,657
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

333
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,576
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

334
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,204
You and me, in and out,
50 seconds tops.

335
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,998
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

336
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,793
These people have done nothing to us.

337
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:58,421
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

338
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,008
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

339
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,551
That is not true.

340
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,804
We weren't born here.
We're orphans!

341
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,764
All we got is each other,
you understand?

342
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,557
We are better than this.

343
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,477
But we're partners.

344
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,688
We are brothers.

345
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,149
But I am not stealing anymore.

346
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:23,446
But Humpty would not give up so easily.

347
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,281
I'm in trouble, Puss!

348
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,659
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

349
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,036
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

350
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,665
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

351
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,971
OK, I've got everything. We did it.
Come on, let's go!

352
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,639
How could you do this to me?!

353
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,267
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

354
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,145
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

355
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,651
You disgrace those boots!

356
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,695
Comandante, please, I can explain!

357
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,071
Arrest them!

358
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,369
Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

359
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,707
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

360
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,758
Mama...

361
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,760
Pequeño.

362
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:28,678
Watch out!

363
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,446
Oh, no.

364
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,615
Puss. I can't get up.

365
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,992
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

366
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,494
Freeze!

367
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,080
Puss, save me!

368
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,207
Save yourself.

369
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,584
We got you.

370
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:18,186
I lost everything
I cared about that day.

371
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,022
My brother.

372
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,690
My honor.

373
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,192
My home.

374
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,448
All I thought about was the
disappointment in my mama's eyes.

375
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,369
And I have been running ever since.

376
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,875
The egg betrayed me.

377
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:44,712
His lies cost me everything.

378
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,717
- Hey!
- I'm awake!

379
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,011
You think I don't want to fix the past?

380
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,100
I can't get down.

381
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,029
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

382
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,323
when I don't think about what I lost.

383
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:17,036
I lost my best friend.

384
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,455
My only friend.

385
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,584
And I get it now. I got greedy
and desperate and I let you down.

386
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,794
I let myself down.

387
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,463
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

388
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,843
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

389
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,762
Please, Puss.

390
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,724
Let me show you
what our friendship meant to me.

391
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,273
- I will do it.
- That's great.

392
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:50,653
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

393
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:54,324
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

394
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,996
OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

395
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,332
Yes!

396
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,835
I think we got our Bean Club back.

397
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,565
Humpty's plan better work.

398
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:32,737
Listen, you just need to worry about
your part. Don't screw it up.

399
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,240
- What?
- Again with the mask?

400
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,993
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

401
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,336
Come on, Puss. Now!

402
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,218
Our biological clocks
are tickin', darlin'.

403
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:58,054
- You gotta look at the big picture.
- What's your problem?

404
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,474
Listen.
I put a lot of work into my body.

405
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:04,602
I look good, and I am not
just gonna throw that away.

406
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,649
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

407
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,276
- We're gonna start small.
- Look.

408
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,403
Let's just pretend you have a baby.

409
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,406
Excellent.

410
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,162
I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

411
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,999
You don't have to, Jill.
I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

412
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,584
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

413
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,504
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

414
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,589
- That little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

415
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,341
He's a cute little bugger.

416
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,552
Why are you not using your claws?

417
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,637
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

418
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,307
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

419
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,476
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, all right?!

420
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,812
Was that Hamhock?

421
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,321
There, there.
Sleepy, sleepy, big, fat piggy.

422
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:01,075
Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time...?

423
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,660
You babysit.

424
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,913
- Soft paws.
- When did we have a monkey?

425
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,625
Well?

426
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,669
...what happened last time...
You sat on it, Jack.

427
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,921
Hello, beans of legend.

428
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,923
Let's go.

429
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:28,519
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Jill.

430
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,314
You messed with our baby.

431
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,651
And you took my beans.

432
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,488
Sausage bomb!

433
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,164
You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

434
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,541
Signal the egg!

435
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,586
Yes!

436
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,592
- OK.
- Ready.

437
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,761
- Set.
- Go!

438
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,362
Oh, my God!

439
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,299
All right, cat. Give me them beans.

440
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,429
Is it true
a cat always lands on its feet?

441
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,390
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

442
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,767
Well, let's find out.

443
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,569
See? I told you I wouldn't let you down!

444
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,487
You think this is over?

445
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,495
Hey, that was close!

446
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,882
Now!

447
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:27,346
We just got to make it to that bridge!
Hang on!

448
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,267
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

449
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,275
Humpty!

450
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,616
We're going to die!

451
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,463
I hate cats.

452
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,256
This is war!

453
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,642
Giant's castle...

454
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,810
...here we come.

455
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,815
I must hand it to the egg.

456
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,777
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

457
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:27,949
I mean, flaws. That was what I meant,
not claws. He's not a cat.

458
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,327
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

459
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:32,995
Got it.

460
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,873
OK, we should be close!

461
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,252
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

462
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,172
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

463
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,550
and you'll never know I was there.

464
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:52,890
Kitty?

465
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,185
You are not as good as they say.

466
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,189
You're better.

467
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,820
I will respect your privacy.

468
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,493
OK. I'll tell you.

469
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,413
I was just a stray...

470
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,583
...but I had beautiful claws.

471
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,629
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

472
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,132
Gave me milk every morning.

473
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,633
Loved me.

474
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:34,473
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

475
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,976
I don't know why they did it.

476
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,687
But they took my claws.

477
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,524
Cat people are crazy.

478
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,320
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

479
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,634
Can you believe this, Puss?

480
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,553
After all these years!

481
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:17,224
Here. I want you to plant them.

482
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:26,233
That... is a strange cloud.

483
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,739
OK! This is it! It's happening, hurry!

484
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,243
This way!

485
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,037
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

486
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,665
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

487
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,541
Hole! Right here.

488
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,421
Now place the beans.

489
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,217
Place the beans carefully, please.

490
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:54,178
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

491
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,516
OK, good. Very good.
Now just stand back.

492
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,227
What's happening here?

493
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,312
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

494
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,649
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

495
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,901
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

496
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,739
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

497
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:55,906
OK.

498
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,576
Let me just think for a second.

499
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,494
Hi, little plant.

500
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,160
Guys?

501
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,704
Humpty!

502
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,874
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

503
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,335
You sound weird.

504
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,338
It's the thin air!

505
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,176
Come on in! It feels great!

506
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:48,477
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

507
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:52,064
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew?

508
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,363
Come on.

509
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,340
Gotcha!

510
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:23,679
Meow.

511
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,933
Hey, Puss.
What do you think? Do I shave?

512
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,436
Let me show you something.

513
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:40,029
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

514
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,323
I don't know, maybe orphans,

515
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,409
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

516
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,494
dreaming about the future.

517
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,164
That was me and you, Puss.

518
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,833
Me and you.

519
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:55,961
Boys!

520
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:59,840
You might want to take a look at this.

521
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:05,346
The giant's castle.

522
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,559
OK, time to suit up.

523
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:11,769
Humpty!

524
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,438
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs.

525
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,777
Brilliant or what, huh?

526
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:23,530
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

527
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,451
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

528
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,539
Puss, remember when everyone
was laughing at Bean Club?

529
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,584
And who is laughing now? We are!

530
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,222
Wow!

531
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:03,654
That is our target.

532
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,864
Hey, you don't sound
like an elf anymore.

533
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,741
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

534
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:08,951
Let's go.

535
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:16,625
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

536
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,545
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

537
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,964
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

538
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:25,467
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter 14,
"Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

539
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,219
Ankle burn.

540
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,350
- What was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

541
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,936
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

542
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,689
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

543
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:42,317
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

544
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,403
Follow me and keep quiet.

545
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,748
Shh! Humpty!

546
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,876
I can't help it.
Everything's rubbing and pinching!

547
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:00,669
I need powder!

548
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,104
How are we gonna get across?

549
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:20,355
Champagne.

550
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:25,319
Cheers!

551
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:39,583
Do not worry. I will protect you.

552
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:45,089
What are you gonna do?
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

553
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,425
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

554
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,237
Catch me!

555
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:11,615
Hurry!

556
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,118
Hide!

557
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:16,995
Don't look at it!

558
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,462
- Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

559
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:29,383
I said I couldn't breathe and then
you zipped the thing over my mouth!

560
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,553
You gotta get it together. Come on!

561
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,887
OK.

562
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:52,823
Look at this. It's egg paradise.

563
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:57,119
It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

564
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,376
Golden eggs.

565
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,213
Grab as many as you can.

566
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,885
I thought they were going to be
like chicken size.

567
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:17,306
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

568
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,891
Puss!

569
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,437
How are we supposed to
get these out of here?

570
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:24,897
I don't know.

571
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,234
Oh, my!

572
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,240
The Golden Goose.

573
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,578
Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

574
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,674
My sweet darling.

575
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,345
I think she likes you.

576
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:00,724
Let's just take her.

577
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,601
Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

578
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:04,519
We don't know what happens
if we take her.

579
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,982
I know what happens
if we don't take her, we got nothing.

580
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:13,403
Guys, guys. It's a gold pooper.
We're taking it!

581
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,122
Almost there!

582
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,168
Hang on!

583
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,217
Hang on!

584
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,698
It's coming!

585
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,324
Run!

586
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,341
Kitty!

587
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,220
What are you doing?

588
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,286
Hang on!

589
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,042
Come here, you.

590
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,963
Got you!

591
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:57,883
She's mine now!

592
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,061
Hello!

593
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,819
Oh, no! Fly, little gosling, fly!

594
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:25,160
No! It's not supposed to be this way!

595
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:28,830
- Puss?
- No.

596
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,132
I'm sorry.

597
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:56,483
Thanks, Ginger.

598
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,117
We should maybe cut that down.

599
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:13,333
Look at that. You finally
got that family you wanted, Jack.

600
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,378
Did you hear that?
I think he just called me Daddy.

601
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:20,882
- He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

602
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,145
Well, what is it?

603
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,741
I do believe that's our cue.

604
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,707
To paying back San Ricardo!

605
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,459
To being rich!

606
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,751
¡Olé!

607
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:12,517
You.

608
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:13,977
Me?

609
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:15,687
Yeah, yeah, baby!

610
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,150
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

611
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,319
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!

612
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:24,279
One, two... What?!

613
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:29,826
There is one word for you,
Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

614
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:34,915
I know you have quite a reputation
with the ladies, Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

615
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:38,251
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

616
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,422
But that was before I met you.

617
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:47,594
You don't know me, Puss. I'm not who
you think I am. I'm all about the score.

618
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:52,849
Come on. Look me in the eyes and
tell me all you care about is the gold.

619
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,101
Puss...

620
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,353
Kitty...

621
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,522
Oh, my God!

622
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,900
New partners!

623
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:06,571
Do not fall for his animal magnetism.
You stay focused.

624
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,241
What?!

625
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,627
So... I have been thinking,
Miss Softpaws,

626
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:24,422
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

627
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,258
...together.

628
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,512
Puss, you have to go, now.

629
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,349
You do not have to push me away
anymore. You can trust me.

630
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:39,813
Give it up for the legends of San
Ricardo, Humpty and Puss! We did it!

631
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:45,318
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

632
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:49,322
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

633
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:52,325
OK, yeah. Have fun with that!

634
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:55,036
We should give her some privacy.

635
00:56:57,582 --> 00:57:00,083
I never thought we would get to here.

636
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,169
After all we went through...

637
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,006
...to pull this off, together.

638
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,677
It is good to have my brother back.

639
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:14,222
Yep. Sure is.

640
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,058
Well, we have a big day tomorrow.

641
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,061
Pretty exciting stuff.

642
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:21,896
We should get some rest.

643
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:25,400
Good night, Humpty.

644
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:33,074
Canasta!

645
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,150
I am still alive!

646
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,449
Jack and Jill.

647
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,118
Kitty?

648
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:18,453
Humpty?

649
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,957
I will find you.

650
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,963
Get out of here!

651
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,436
Be gone!

652
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,482
What do you want? Gold? I have gold!

653
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,485
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

654
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:33,987
With our own gold.

655
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,406
Come on now,
all we want is a little breakfast.

656
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:39,409
- No, no, please!
- How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

657
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:41,244
Humpty, no!

658
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:49,085
Hello, Puss.

659
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,087
Surprise!

660
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,133
What is going on?

661
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:59,220
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

662
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,973
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

663
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,683
You were in cahoots?!

664
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:06,144
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

665
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,526
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

666
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,404
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

667
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:20,909
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

668
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:25,413
This little adventure
was about one thing.

669
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:27,916
Revenge.

670
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:33,838
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there.

671
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:59,030
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

672
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:00,573
Why would you do this?

673
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,158
You left me on that bridge!

674
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,452
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

675
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,163
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

676
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,374
Well, now you're finally gonna know
what it feels like,

677
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:12,335
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

678
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:14,295
Guards!

679
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:19,259
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

680
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,427
Consider this the final meeting
of Bean Club.

681
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,471
I should scramble you with onions!

682
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,225
You should never have come back.

683
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:31,354
¡Pequeño! Wait.

684
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,648
Do not fight them, please.

685
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,609
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

686
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:41,155
No. Puss, no more running.

687
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:45,493
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

688
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,164
I'm sorry, Mama.

689
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,667
I let you down.

690
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,922
Paws where we can see them!

691
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,092
Turn around... slow.

692
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:04,762
Slower!

693
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,522
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

694
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:26,284
Attention! Attention, everyone! If you
could just come in a little closer.

695
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:32,040
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you... the Golden Goose of legend!

696
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,589
Kitty. Not you, too?

697
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,930
Gold for everyone!

698
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,101
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

699
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,605
Step right up! Get it hot!

700
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,942
¡Huevos! ¡Huevos! ¡Huevos!

701
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,368
One hat.

702
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,703
One belt.

703
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,039
And two boots...

704
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:16,042
...once a symbol of honor.

705
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,338
One bottle of catnip?

706
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,132
It is for my glaucoma.

707
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:30,223
This is where you belong, outlaw.

708
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:34,727
And this is where you will stay...
forever.

709
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,248
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

710
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:11,723
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

711
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,725
You're talking about Humpty?

712
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:19,188
Don't say his name! I used to
share this cell with that smelly thing.

713
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,316
Happiest day of my life
was when he left.

714
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:25,194
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

715
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,489
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

716
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,076
Hey! What's your name?

717
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:34,078
Andy Beanstalk!

718
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,080
My friends call me Jack.

719
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:39,584
I traded the family cow for them beans.

720
01:04:39,752 --> 01:04:41,669
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

721
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:44,756
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

722
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:48,926
Always know which cow is yours.

723
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,055
Crazy man. Wake up!

724
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,223
What else do you know?

725
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:58,102
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

726
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:03,524
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

727
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:06,027
Don't take the goose. Why?

728
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:13,409
The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

729
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,869
Oh, no.

730
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:17,705
And she will be out for blood

731
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:21,417
when she comes back for her baby.

732
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:26,214
Guard! San Ricardo is in terrible
danger! You must listen to me!

733
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,715
Quiet, you!

734
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,074
Shut up.

735
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,760
Open the door.

736
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,019
Drop the weapon.

737
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:25,148
Very good.

738
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,483
Step aside.

739
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:29,652
No.

740
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,612
Diablo Gato!

741
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:33,781
Nice try.

742
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,504
I hope you can forgive me.

743
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:51,465
Apology accepted!

744
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,552
I don't really have time for you.

745
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,804
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

746
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:58,806
Wait, Puss!

747
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,892
Don't you see? I'm here because...

748
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:04,645
I am here
because you made me realize

749
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:07,899
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

750
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,610
Something?

751
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,654
OK. Someone.

752
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:16,699
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

753
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,326
Handsome?

754
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,453
He's very handsome.

755
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,871
A real beefcake?

756
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:23,998
- A stallion?
- Yes.

757
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,042
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

758
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,629
But this does not make us even.

759
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:30,796
Freeze!

760
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,423
Yes, it does.

761
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:34,258
No, no, no, it doesn't.

762
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,597
I saved you!

763
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,183
You owed me one.

764
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,769
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

765
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:48,522
So now you owe me two.

766
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,780
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

767
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,828
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

768
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,997
Wrong boots.

769
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,083
Kitty!

770
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:08,918
Now we're even!

771
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:19,929
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

772
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,682
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

773
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:24,934
...one hundred percent.

774
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,650
Never alone, always together...

775
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:34,151
Humpty and Puss...

776
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,070
Brothers forever.

777
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:43,953
Come on, sweetie. Let's get
out of here before Mama shows up.

778
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,914
I should make you
into an egg salad sandwich!

779
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,542
That is disgusting!

780
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,210
Give me the goose, Humpty.

781
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,296
No can do, I'm afraid.

782
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,464
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

783
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:59,969
it's bye-bye San Ricardo
and everything you ever cared about!

784
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:03,973
Revenge on me is one thing,
but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?

785
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:05,683
This is our home.

786
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,226
You mean your home.

787
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,981
I never belonged here.

788
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,482
We had a plan to get out of here,

789
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,820
but then you became a hero
and you picked this place over me.

790
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,990
You left me with nothing.

791
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:28,664
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

792
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:35,087
But do not take it out on these people.
You are better than this!

793
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,632
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

794
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,509
I know the real Humpty.

795
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:44,805
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

796
01:09:44,973 --> 01:09:47,266
What happened to that guy?

797
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:55,107
I... I think it's too late.

798
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,777
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

799
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,029
Together we can save San Ricardo!

800
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:09,413
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

801
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:11,707
Really?

802
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,251
After everything I put you through?

803
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:17,213
Prove to me there is still
a good egg in you.

804
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,966
I'll try.

805
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:14,019
Goggles, check.

806
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,730
Get the baby over the bridge.
I'll get the mother to follow.

807
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,399
OK. Give me a...

808
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:19,900
Puss!

809
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:45,217
Mama Goose!

810
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,556
Wait!

811
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:54,185
Just follow me
and I will lead you to your baby.

812
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,859
No! Not that way!

813
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:05,321
Pequeño, help!

814
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:06,947
Hang on!

815
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,167
That's my boy!

816
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,466
Come with me, Mama Goose.
I know where your baby is.

817
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:27,927
Here. Look!

818
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,232
Humpty, pick up the pace!

819
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:43,859
I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

820
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,451
Sorry, egghead,
we want more than just eggs.

821
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,411
So how about you give us that goose!

822
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:55,496
Humpty!

823
01:12:57,332 --> 01:12:58,332
Get her off!

824
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:03,671
- Nice moves.
- What would you do without me?

825
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:09,552
Freeze!

826
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,431
Comandante!

827
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,058
I can explain?

828
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:21,772
Gato, you are going back to jail
if it's the last thing I do!

829
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,232
Humpty, hurry!

830
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,694
We're almost there. We're almost there!

831
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:53,554
- Puss, help!
- Humpty, hang on!

832
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,848
Puss!

833
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:07,234
Here we are again, right, Puss?

834
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:13,282
I will not leave you behind
this time, Humpty.

835
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,626
I'm sorry, Puss.

836
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,461
I've made a mess out of everything.

837
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,006
I'm a rotten egg.

838
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:31,759
I'm not a person.

839
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:35,095
I'm not a bird. I'm not even a food.

840
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:38,557
I don't know what I am.

841
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:42,186
You are what you have always been.

842
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,438
My brother.

843
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:48,525
Brothers forever.

844
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:05,334
- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

845
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:11,965
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

846
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:15,719
It's the right thing to do.

847
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:21,850
I will not let you go, Humpty.

848
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:24,353
I know you won't.

849
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,356
So I won't make you choose.

850
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:29,483
Humpty!

851
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,298
I'm very sorry.

852
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,050
She's OK.

853
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,768
Humpty?

854
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:26,623
I always knew that you were good inside.

855
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,139
Goodbye, Humpty.

856
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:56,069
- Yeah, I think it's wonderful...
- And I got a goose egg.

857
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:58,238
It's him. Puss In Boots.

858
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:00,407
He saved us from the giant goose!

859
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,367
His sword is like lightning!

860
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,411
They say he has ten lives.

861
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:08,373
His boots are made
of the finest Corinthian leather.

862
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,834
He only drinks whole milk.

863
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:15,631
Good leche.

864
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:19,343
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

865
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:21,678
Meow?

866
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:26,016
A gift for you, Mama.

867
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:32,689
I have to go.
The soldiers are coming for me.

868
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:37,027
I am so proud of you, my son.

869
01:17:39,948 --> 01:17:44,117
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

870
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:47,371
You earned those boots.

871
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:52,543
And the people know that
you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.

872
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:55,546
I did it for you, Mama.

873
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,341
You will always be in my heart.

874
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:01,718
And you in mine.

875
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:06,348
¡Gato!

876
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:09,142
- There he is!
- I see him!

877
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:54,605
I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!

878
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,773
Sooner than you think.

879
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:07,576
She is a bad kitty.

880
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:16,418
This is the story of a cat
who became a hero.

881
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:21,089
An outlaw dedicated to justice.
And a lover of beautiful women.

882
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:24,885
A great... great lover.

883
01:19:25,053 --> 01:19:27,679
Really. It is crazy.

884
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:30,891
I am Puss In Boots!

885
