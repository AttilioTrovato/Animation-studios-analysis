1
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,748
<i>Here's my day so far:</i>

2
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,584
<i>went to jail,
lost the girl of my dreams,</i>

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,045
<i>and got my butt kicked pretty good.</i>

4
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,757
<i>Still, things could be a lot worse.</i>

5
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,468
<i>That's right.</i>

6
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,887
<i>I'm falling to my death.</i>

7
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,931
<i>Guess they can't.</i>

8
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>How'd it all come to this, you ask?</i>

9
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,437
<i>My end starts at the beginning.</i>

10
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,605
<i>The very beginning.</i>

11
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,153
<i>Yes, that's me.</i>

12
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,614
<i>I had a fairly standard childhood.</i>

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,618
<i>I came from, what you might call,
a broken home.</i>

14
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,538
<i>Literally broken.</i>

15
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,083
<i>I was eight days old
and still living with my parents.</i>

16
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,461
<i>How sad is that?</i>

17
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,713
<i>Clearly it was time to move on.</i>

18
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,674
Here is your minion.
He will take care of you.

19
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,259
And here is your binky.

20
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,179
You are destined for...

21
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>I didn't quite hear that last part,
but it sounded important.</i>

22
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,394
<i>- ...two, one.
- Destined for what?</i>

23
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,899
<i>I set out to find my destiny.</i>

24
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt
quadrant had the exact same idea.</i>

25
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,207
<i>That was the day
I met Mr. Goody Two-Shoes...</i>

26
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,547
<i>...and our glorious rivalry was born.</i>

27
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,513
<i>Could this be
what I was destined for?</i>

28
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>A dream life filled with luxury.</i>

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,435
<i>Apparently not.</i>

30
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,897
<i>Even fate picks its favourites.</i>

31
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,525
<i>No big deal.</i>

32
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,361
<i>A much different fate awaited me.</i>

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,747
A baby! How thoughtful.

34
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,708
Oh, yes.
Yes, I saw it and thought of you.

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,629
<i>Luckily I found
a lovely little place to call home.</i>

36
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,964
Can we keep it?

37
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,717
<i>A place that taught me
the differences between right...</i>

38
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,220
<i>and wrong.</i>

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,722
<i>Mr. Goody Two-Shoes,
on the other hand,</i>

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,392
<i>had life handed to him
on a silver platter.</i>

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,018
Our baby can fly.

42
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,437
Yes, yes, nothing
but the best for you, darling.

43
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,859
<i>The power of flight,
invulnerability, and great hair.</i>

44
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,196
<i>But I had something far, far greater.</i>

45
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,657
<i>My amazing intellect...</i>

46
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>and knack
for building objects of mayhem.</i>

47
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,128
<i>After a few years, and with some
time off for good behaviour,</i>

48
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,173
<i>I was given an opportunity
to better myself through learning...</i>

49
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,594
<i>at a strange place called shool.</i>

50
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,348
<i>It was there that I once again ran
into Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.</i>

51
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,352
<i>He had already amassed a gigantic army
of soft-headed groupies.</i>

52
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,819
<i>He bought their affections
with showmanship</i>

53
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,322
<i>and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.</i>

54
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:06,329
<i>So I, too, will make this popp-ed corn
and win over those mindless drones.</i>

55
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,872
Lights out.

56
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,975
<i>That's when I learned
a very hard lesson:</i>

57
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,811
<i>Good receives all the praise
and adulation,</i>

58
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,856
<i>while evil is
sent to quiet-time in the corner.</i>

59
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,277
<i>So fitting in wasn't
really an option.</i>

60
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,697
<i>While they were learning</i>
the Itsy Bitsy Spider...

61
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,869
<i>I learned how to dehydrate animate
objects and rehydrate them at will.</i>

62
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:52,875
<i>Some days, it felt like it was
just me and Minion against the world.</i>

63
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,003
<i>No matter how hard I tried,</i>

64
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,214
<i>I was always the odd man out,</i>

65
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,174
<i>the last one picked,</i>

66
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,426
<i>the screw-up, the black sheep...</i>

67
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:03,970
Get him!

68
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,388
<i>- ...the bad boy.</i>
- Freak!

69
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,519
Weirdo!

70
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,068
<i>Was this my destiny?</i>

71
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,946
<i>Wait, maybe it was.</i>

72
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,908
<i>Being bad is
the one thing I'm good at.</i>

73
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,204
<i>Then it hit me:
If I was the bad boy,</i>

74
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,375
<i>then I was going to be
the baddest boy of them all.</i>

75
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,713
<i>I was destined to be
a super-villain,</i>

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,507
<i>and we were destined to be rivals.</i>

77
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,593
<i>The die had been cast,</i>

78
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,973
<i>and so began an enduring, epic,
lifelong career.</i>

79
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,183
<i>And I loved it.</i>

80
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:57,648
<i>Our battles quickly got more elaborate.
He would win some.</i>

81
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,276
<i>I would almost win others.</i>

82
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,781
<i>He took the name Metro Man,
defender of Metrocity.</i>

83
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,577
<i>I decided to pick something
a little more humble: Megamind...</i>

84
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,498
<i>incredibly handsome criminal genius
and master of all villainy.</i>

85
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,137
Read on your own time. Open up.

86
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,562
- Hey!
- Boo!

87
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,901
Good morning, Warden.

88
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,987
Great news: I'm a changed man, and...

89
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,908
and I'm ready to re-enter society
as a solid citizen.

90
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,494
You're a villain,
and you'll always be a villain.

91
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,330
You'll never change,
and you'll never leave.

92
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,790
You're fun.

93
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,208
You got a present in the mail.

94
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,751
Is it a puppy?

95
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,090
From Metro Man. "To count every
second of your 85 life sentences."

96
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,510
That's funny. Never thought Metro Man
was the gloating type.

97
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,387
But he does have nice taste.
I think I'll keep it.

98
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,681
Any chance you could give me the time?

99
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,810
I don't want to be late for the opening
of the Metro Man Museum.

100
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,522
Oh no. Looks like
you're gonna miss it,

101
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,565
by several thousand years.

102
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,110
Oh, am I?

103
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,159
<i>Happy Metro Man Day, Metro City.</i>

104
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,206
<i>It's a beautiful day
in beautiful downtown,</i>

105
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:41,460
<i>where we're here to honour
a beautiful man, Metro Man.</i>

106
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,215
His heart is an ocean
that's inside a bigger ocean.

107
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,677
For years he's been watching us
with his super-vision,

108
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:54,390
saving us with his super-strength
and caring for us with his super-heart.

109
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,351
Now it's our turn
to give something back.

110
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,436
This is Roxanne Ritchi,
reporting live

111
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,064
from the dedication
of the Metro Man Museum.

112
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,859
OK, the stuff they make you read on-air,

113
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,278
that's un-freaking-believable.
It's crazy.

114
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,697
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

115
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,240
What I was trying to say was,

116
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,118
I can't believe
that in our modern society,

117
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,787
they let, like,
actual art get onto the news.

118
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,247
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we...

119
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,541
Like, let's just get
a coffee or something.

120
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,377
Come on, it's time to get
in the Metro Man Day spirit.

121
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,920
Well, if I were Metro Man,

122
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,922
Megamind wouldn't be
kidnapping you all the time.

123
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,425
- That's the first thing.
- That's sweet, Hal.

124
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,928
And I'd be watching you,
like a dingo watches a human baby.

125
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,346
OK, that sounded...

126
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,765
- OK, that sounded a little weird.
- A little bit. Yeah.

127
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,143
And you're making a weird face,
and that's making me feel weird.

128
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,728
The point is, I would watch you
like someone...

129
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,191
Not love. We're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.

130
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,609
Hey, I love you. Whatever.

131
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,694
But I'm not saying like
I'm in love with you. I'm saying...

132
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,822
Roxanne? Roxaroo?

133
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,921
- What?
- Hey...

134
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,090
Get back to work.
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

135
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,259
- Freeze!
- What are you doing, guys?

136
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,220
It's me! It's the warden.

137
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,388
Hey! Open up!

138
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,106
No, you fools. He's tricked us.

139
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,691
You were right.

140
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,111
I'll always be a villain.

141
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,548
Well, hello good-looking.
Need a lift?

142
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,093
Certainly do,
you fantastic fish, you.

143
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,763
- Get in the car, you.
- I'm free!

144
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,348
Right?

145
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,517
Nice work sending me
the watch, Minion.

146
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,019
- You got it, boss.
- Punch it!

147
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,690
All right,
put your hands in the air.

148
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,198
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Metro Man!

149
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,576
- Who's your man?
- Metro Man!

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,329
Yeah, Metro City!

151
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,583
Gimme some. Come on. Give it now.

152
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,628
Give it to me. Right on.
Gimme the good stuff. All right.

153
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,231
Hey, Metro City.

154
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,608
Hey. Hey.

155
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,071
You know, you know,
I just want to bring it down a bit.

156
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,324
Boys, a little lower.
Thank you, fellas.

157
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,743
Let's get real for a moment.

158
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,163
That's right. That's right.
That's right.

159
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,875
Although getting a whole museum
is super-cool, is super-cool,

160
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,253
you want to know what the greatest
honour you've given me is?

161
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,173
Do you really want to know? Really?

162
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,800
I'll tell you.

163
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:21,388
The greatest honour you've
given me is letting me serve you,

164
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,098
the helpless people of Metro City.

165
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,017
And at the end of every day,

166
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,270
well, I often ask myself...

167
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,815
who would I be without you?

168
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,943
- I love you, Metro Man!
- And I love you, random citizen.

169
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:47,039
I tell you, Minion.
There's no place like evil lair.

170
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,292
I've kept it cold and damp
just for you, sir.

171
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,088
How do I look, Minion?
Do I look bad?

172
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,131
Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

173
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,800
You always know what to say.

174
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,135
The brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.

175
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,763
Did you miss your daddy?
Who's a menacing little cyborg?

176
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,140
You are. Yes, you are. No biting.

177
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,309
No, no.

178
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,561
You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.

179
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,648
- Look at that.
- Now, back to laughing.

180
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,077
She's awake. Quick, to work.

181
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,005
Miss Ritchi, we meet again.

182
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,007
Would it kill you to wash the bag?

183
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,301
You can scream all you wish,
Miss Ritchi.

184
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,554
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

185
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,182
Wh... Why isn't she screaming?

186
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,017
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind?

187
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,686
Like this...

188
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,604
But that's, that's a poor lady scream.

189
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,191
He's a little better.

190
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,029
Is there some kind
of nerdy super-villain Web site

191
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,032
where you get Tesla coils
and blinky dials?

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,785
Actually, most of it comes
from an outlet store in...

193
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,245
Don't answer that.

194
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,373
- Romania.
- Don't! Stop!

195
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,792
She's using her
nosy reporter skills

196
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,379
on your weak-willed mind
to find out all our secrets.

197
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,469
Such tricks won't work on me...

198
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,304
- Please talk slower.
- ...temptress.

199
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,557
What secrets?
You're so predictable.

200
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,726
Predictable? Predictable?

201
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,521
You call this predictable?

202
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,398
Your alligators. Yes.

203
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,276
Yeah, I was thinking about it
on the way over.

204
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,821
What's this? Boom! In your face.

205
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,032
- Cliché.
- No! Look, watch.

206
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,076
- Juvenile.
- Shock and awe.

207
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,662
- Tacky.
- Oh, it's so scary!

208
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,456
- Seen it.
- What's this one do?

209
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,416
Garish.

210
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,586
- OK, the spider's new.
- Spider?

211
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,927
Yes. The... The spee-ider.

212
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,430
Even the smallest bite
<i>from Arachnis deathicus</i>

213
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,099
will instantly paralyse...

214
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,268
Get it off! It bit me!

215
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,729
Give it up, Megamind.
Your plans never work.

216
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,651
Let's stop wasting time and call
your boyfriend in tights, shall we?

217
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:28,116
It is with great pleasure that
I present to Metro Man his new museum.

218
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,618
If you please.

219
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,628
- Metro Man!
- Hey! My kid can't see.

220
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:06,280
- Megamind!
<i>- Bravo, Metro Man.</i>

221
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>Boo!</i>

222
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,995
<i>Yes, I can play along too. Boo!</i>

223
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,289
Should've known
you'd try to crash the party.

224
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,624
<i>I intend to do more than crash it.</i>

225
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:23,338
<i>This is a day you and Metrocity
shall not soon forget.</i>

226
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,549
It's pronounced Metro City!

227
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,594
<i>Potato-tomato, potato-tomato.</i>

228
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,139
We all know how this ends:
with you behind bars.

229
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,892
<i>I'm shaking in my custom
baby seal leather boots.</i>

230
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,646
<i>You will leave Metrocity,
or this will be the last</i>

231
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,525
<i>you ever hear
of Roxanne Ritchi.</i>

232
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,028
Roxanne! Don't panic, Roxie.

233
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,030
- I'm on my way.
<i>- Yeah, I'm not panicking.</i>

234
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,242
<i>In order to stop me,
you need to find me first, Metro Man.</i>

235
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,910
<i>We're at the abandoned observatory.</i>

236
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,121
<i>No, we're not!</i>

237
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,332
<i>Don't listen to her. She's crazy.</i>

238
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,605
Metro Man approaching, sir.

239
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,834
Hold on a second.

240
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,885
Oh, good heavens!

241
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,931
You didn't think you
were in the real observatory, did you?

242
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,105
Ready the death ray, Minion.

243
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,107
Death ray, readying.

244
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,487
<i>Over here, old friend.</i>

245
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,157
<i>In case you haven't noticed,
you've fallen right into my trap.</i>

246
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,285
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.

247
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,664
<i>Even the most heartfelt belief
can be corroded over time.</i>

248
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,290
Justice is a non-corrosive metal.

249
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,960
<i>But metals can be melted
by the heat of revange.</i>

250
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,045
It's "revenge",
and it's best served cold.

251
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,006
<i>But it can be easily reheated
in the microwave of evil.</i>

252
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,175
Well, I think your warranty is
about to expire.

253
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,510
<i>Maybe I got an extended warranty.</i>

254
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,304
Warranties are invalid if you don't use
the product for its intended purpose.

255
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,599
Girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?

256
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,145
<i>Of course. That is,
if Metro Man can withstand the full,</i>

257
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,814
<i>concentrated power of the sun!</i>

258
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,150
<i>Fire!</i>

259
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,536
Minion. Fire?

260
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,164
- It's still warming up, sir.
- Come again?

261
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,709
- Warming up, sir.
- Warming up? The sun is warming up?

262
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:10,005
One second more and...

263
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:15,010
just tippy-tappy tippy-tap-tap,
tip-top more,

264
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,387
- and we are ready in just...
- Honestly!

265
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,722
<i>On my way, Roxie.</i>

266
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,017
I told you to have things ready.
I told you countless times.

267
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,019
Why do you always blame me?

268
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,021
My spider bite is acting up.

269
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,482
Your plan is failing. Just admit it.

270
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,025
Yeah, good luck with that one.

271
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,568
Whose side are you on?

272
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,570
- The losing side.
- Thank you.

273
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,490
Could someone stamp
my Frequent Kidnapping Card?

274
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,788
You of all people know
we discontinued that promotion.

275
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,873
- Ciao-ciao, all!
- Same time next week?

276
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,961
<i>Dag! Crab nuggets!</i>

277
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,714
- What did he just say?
- "Crab nuggets"?

278
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,175
<i>Fackled fish cracker!</i>

279
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,344
<i>Ten seconds to full power.</i>

280
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,805
- Good lord, I'm trapped.
- Ten...

281
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,807
<i>- What kind of trickery is this?
- ...nine...</i>

282
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,683
- You mad genius.
<i>- ...eight...</i>

283
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,561
- Your dark gift has finally paid off.
<i>- ...seven...</i>

284
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,396
<i>- It... It has?
- ...six...</i>

285
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,359
This dome is
obviously lined with copper.

286
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,820
- Yeah? So?
- Sir...

287
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,364
- Copper drains my powers.
- ...two...

288
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,908
<i>- Your weakness is copper?
- ...one.</i>

289
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,535
<i>- You're kidding, right?
- Full power.</i>

290
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,105
I don't think
even he could survive that.

291
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,276
Well, let's not get
our hopes up just yet.

292
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,945
- Look!
- Metro Man!

293
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,989
Metro Man.

294
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,574
Metro Man!

295
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,801
- You... You did it, sir.
- I did it?

296
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,890
He did it.

297
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,184
<i>- I did it?</i>
- He did it.

298
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,686
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!

299
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:33,857
- You did it!
- I did it! Metrocity is mine!

300
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,904
- You did it, sir!
- I did it! Yeah, me, me!

301
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,448
- Yes, I did it!
- Us! We both did it!

302
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,408
- Not us! I!
- You, a little more

303
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,327
- than me but still, come on!
- A lot more than you.

304
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,786
When they're giving out the awards,

305
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,372
- I'm gonna be right there next to you.
- What awards? What awards, for what?

306
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,458
Hit it!

307
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,157
Drop 'em!

308
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,646
First off, what a turnout.

309
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,815
How wild is this?

310
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,570
All I did was eliminate the most
powerful man in the universe.

311
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,491
Are there any questions?
Go on. Yes! You in the back.

312
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,621
I'm sure we'd all like to know what
you plan to do with us and this city.

313
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,415
Good, I'm glad you asked that.

314
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,085
Imagine the most horrible, terrifying,

315
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,255
evil thing you can possibly think of,

316
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,259
and multiply it... by six!

317
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,928
In the meantime,

318
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,306
I want you to carry on
with the dreary, normal things

319
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,018
you normal people do.

320
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,311
Let's just have fun with this. Come on.

321
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,939
And I will get back to you.

322
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,863
Now slam the door really hard.

323
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,074
They... They can still see you.

324
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,576
- Now?
- Your elbow's still in.

325
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,119
Good.

326
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:59,085
<i>There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord</i>

327
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,797
Minion, did you think
this day would ever come?

328
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,133
No way. Not at all, sir.

329
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,302
Never. Never in a million...
I mean...

330
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,514
- Yes, I did.
- Look at the intricate mouldings.

331
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,558
I'm looking. I'm looking.

332
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,477
And what's this?

333
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,688
It's like one of the giant monitors
in the lair.

334
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,608
But it seems to only carry one station.

335
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,944
That, sir, is called a window.

336
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,572
- Window?
- All the kids are looking through them.

337
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,451
I've never had a view before.

338
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,913
Metrocity, Minion, it's all mine.

339
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,416
If my parents could see me now.

340
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,629
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down
from evil heaven.

341
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,174
And now that Mr. Goody Two-Shoes is
out of the way,

342
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,885
I can have everything I want,

343
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,388
and there's no one to stop me!

344
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,308
I know. I know.

345
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,229
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

346
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,399
I understand you,
little well-dressed bird.

347
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,863
Purposeless, emptiness.
It's a vacuum, isn't it?

348
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,740
It's... What's your vacuum like?

349
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,706
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.

350
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,960
I'm in a heated,
existential discussion

351
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,754
with this dead-eyed, plastic desk toy.

352
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,510
Is... Is something wrong, sir?

353
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,889
Just think about it.

354
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,599
We have it all.

355
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,310
Yet, we have nothing.

356
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,813
It's just too easy now.

357
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,691
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

358
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,196
I mean, we did it, right?

359
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,615
Well, you did it, sir.

360
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,284
Yes, you've made that perfectly clear.

361
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,371
Then why do I feel so... mel-on-choly.

362
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,040
"Mel-on-choly"?

363
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,834
- Unhappy.
- Well...

364
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,629
What if tomorrow,

365
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,173
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

366
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,300
That always seems to lift your spirits.

367
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,973
Good idea, Minion.
But without him, what's the point?

368
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,101
- "Him", sir?
- Nothing.

369
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,814
OK, all right. We'll just...
that's something to consider...

370
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,985
and... Well, I think I'll just
power down for a while then.

371
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,996
<i>He was always there for us. Dependable.</i>

372
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,668
<i>Perhaps we took him for granted.
You know, maybe,</i>

373
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,004
<i>we never really know how good
we have it until it's gone.</i>

374
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,093
<i>We miss you, Metro Man. I miss you.</i>

375
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:40,682
<i>And I have just one question
for Megamind: Are you happy now?</i>

376
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,729
<i>This is Roxanne Ritchi,
reporting from a city without a hero.</i>

377
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,610
<i>Coming up next, are you ready to be
a slave army? What you need to know.</i>

378
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,079
And... wrap that up and give it
to a child on Christmas,

379
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,040
- 'cause we're done.
- OK. See you tomorrow, Hal.

380
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,335
Wait. Roxie, I'm having a party
at my house.

381
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,254
It's gonna be, like,
off the hook, or whatever.

382
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,089
You should come over.
I got a deejay,

383
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,133
rented a bouncy house,
made a gallon of dip.

384
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,259
It's gonna be sick.

385
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,052
I don't know, Hal.

386
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,221
I don't really feel like being
around a bunch of people.

387
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,390
No, no, no, that's the best part.
It'll just be like you and me.

388
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:28,229
That... that's certainly
very tempting, but...

389
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,774
I did hire a wedding photographer.
That's just in case we were like,

390
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,651
something crazy happened
and we wanted a picture of it.

391
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,238
Like, maybe we should have this for,
like, ever. Like a memory, you know?

392
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,198
I'm gonna pass.

393
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,035
I have some work here
that I need to do, anyway.

394
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,412
Cool. So Thursday? Soft Thursday?

395
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,873
- Good night, Hal.
- That's a soft yes on Thursday.

396
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,753
What's wrong with me?
Rented a bouncy house?

397
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,629
Chicks don't like bouncy houses.

398
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,423
They like clowns.

399
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,552
Stupid van! You broke my finger!

400
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,883
I've made a horrible mistake.

401
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,469
I didn't mean to destroy you.

402
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,472
I mean, I meant to destroy you,

403
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,766
but I didn't think
it would really work.

404
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,352
What are we supposed to do?

405
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,189
Without you, evil is running rampant
through the streets.

406
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:56,901
I'm so tired of running rampant
through the streets.

407
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,986
What's the point of being bad

408
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,406
when there's no good
to try and stop you?

409
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,325
Someone has to stop Megamind.

410
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,120
- Hey, we're closing soon.
- You scared me.

411
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,621
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.

412
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:13,084
Bernard. I was just...
Well, I was talking to myself.

413
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,836
You probably think
I'm a little bit nuts.

414
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,796
I'm not allowed to insult
guests directly.

415
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,841
Thank you. Just...
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

416
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,635
OK.

417
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:23,845
Thanks.

418
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,390
I had so many evil plans in the works.

419
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,809
The illiteracy beam.

420
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,644
Typhoon cheese.

421
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,479
Robo-sheep.

422
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,398
Battles we will now never have.

423
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,654
You know,
I never had the chance to say goodbye.

424
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,116
So it's good
that we have this time now.

425
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,368
You know, before I destroy the place.

426
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,788
Nothing personal, it just brings back
too many painful memories.

427
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,043
Hello?

428
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,212
- Hello?
- Roxanne.

429
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,475
- That's a pretty tasteless costume.
- Costume?

430
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,394
Megamind's head is not
that grossly exaggerated.

431
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,733
And you even made a cheap replica
of his dehydration gun. How...

432
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,487
Hello? Is someone there?

433
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,074
Hello? Who's there?

434
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,370
It's just you, Bernard.

435
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,499
Yes. It's just me. Bernard.

436
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,542
Well, thank you
for letting me stay.

437
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,170
Look, I wouldn't stay here for more than
two minutes and 37 seconds

438
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,923
if I were you. We're having
the walls and ceiling removed.

439
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,300
That sounds like quite the renovation.

440
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,094
I guess I'll catch
a ride down with you then.

441
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,522
I kept thinking he was gonna do
one of his last-minute escapes.

442
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,983
Yeah. He was really good at those.

443
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,861
If only the world had
a reset button.

444
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,948
I've looked into the reset button.

445
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,783
The science is impossible.

446
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,619
Oh, Bernard...

447
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,498
I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you OK?

448
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:21,003
Metro Man's gone. And now there's
no one left to challenge Megamind.

449
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,464
Oh, come on, Bernard.

450
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,300
As long as there's evil,
good will rise up against it.

451
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,718
Oh, I wish.

452
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,596
I believe someone is gonna stand up
to Megamind.

453
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,099
- You really think so?
- Yeah. I mean, it's like they say,

454
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,768
"Heroes aren't born, they're made."

455
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,233
Heroes can be made. That's it!

456
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,443
All you need are
the right ingredients.

457
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,529
- Yeah. Bravery.
- Yes.

458
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,697
- Strength.
- Of course.

459
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,074
- Determination.
- Imperative!

460
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:54,245
And a smidgen of DNA.
With that, anyone can be a hero!

461
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,788
Yeah!

462
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,999
I think we should run!

463
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,750
Bye!

464
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,671
Time to put the past behind us.

465
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,048
Only the future...

466
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,594
I'm too close!
I'm genuinely scared right now.

467
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,721
I hope no one's seeing this!

468
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,558
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what?
Why would you do that?

469
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,560
So I have someone to fight.

470
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,229
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

471
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,273
A yin with no yang.

472
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,358
A bullfighter with no bull to fight.

473
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,028
In other words, I have no purpose.

474
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,324
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.
Go on! Ask!

475
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,993
How are you gonna do it?

476
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,538
I'm going to give someone...
I don't know who yet...

477
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,206
Metro Man's powers.

478
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,502
I'm going to train that someone
to become Metrocity's new hero.

479
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,712
Over here! Follow!

480
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,381
And then finally,
I'm going to fight that hero

481
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,259
in an epic battle of good and evil.

482
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,137
Which will put everything back
the way it was...

483
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,599
when the world was
perfect and rosy.

484
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,186
Behold, Minion, Metro Man's cape.

485
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,772
Look closely. Tell me what you see.

486
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,692
- Dandruff?
- Yes. It's his DNA.

487
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:11,697
From this, we'll extract the source
of Metro Man's awesome power.

488
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,702
Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

489
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,248
Yes! This is a very wickedly bad idea
for the greater good of bad.

490
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,251
But I'm saying this is
a kind of bad that...

491
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,296
OK, you might think is good
in your bad perception,

492
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,424
but from a good perception it...
it's just plain bad.

493
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,135
You don't know
what's good for bad.

494
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,472
Now, we have just one shot at this.

495
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,060
We must find a suitable subject,
someone of noble heart and mind.

496
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,773
Who puts the welfare of others
above their own.

497
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,527
What on Earth is that?

498
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:53,114
It seems to be emanating
from there, sir.

499
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,826
Ollo.

500
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,285
It's "Hello."

501
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,787
Hello? Like that?

502
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,289
<i>- Bernard, it's Roxanne.</i>
- It's Roxanne.

503
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,458
<i>I just wanted to thank you
for inspiring me the other day.</i>

504
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,169
- Oh, you inspired me too.
<i>- Great!</i>

505
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,756
<i>It's time we stood up to Megamind
and show him he can't push us around.</i>

506
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,925
Really? She's so cute.

507
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,386
<i>I'm already hot on his trail.</i>

508
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,805
- And what gives you that idea?
- Sir?

509
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,682
<i>I just found his secret hideout.</i>

510
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,475
How did she find my hideout?!

511
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,062
How did you find his hideout?

512
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,525
This is the only building in Metro City
with a fake observatory on the roof.

513
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,530
OK. There's no way
she'll find the secret entrance.

514
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,742
<i>There's a doormat here
that says "Secrit Entrance"!</i>

515
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,787
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.

516
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,581
She'll discover all our secrets!

517
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,459
- Oh, no!
- You dim-witted creation of science!

518
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,127
<i>- What?</i>
- What? Oh, no, not you, Roxanne.

519
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,755
No, I was just yelling at my...
mother's urn.

520
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,590
Don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

521
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,217
Roxanne?

522
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,844
Oh no, not again!

523
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,477
Roxanne?

524
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,397
I'm glad you're here.
Wait, how did you get here so fast?

525
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,193
Well, I... I happened to be
speed walking nearby when you called.

526
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,486
In a suit?

527
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,198
It's called... formal speed walking,
but that's not important.

528
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,533
I better take the lead.
This way looks exciting.

529
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,035
No, it says "Exit".

530
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,871
Which is the abbreviation
for "exciting", right?

531
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,332
This is the mother lode!

532
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,251
Just look at this thing.

533
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,962
You know, I really could use
your help in deciphering all this.

534
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,506
- Really?
- You're an expert

535
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,133
- on all things Megamind, right?
- Yes. Right.

536
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,054
Together, we could figure out his plan
for the city and stop it.

537
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,890
- Are you in?
- Oh, what fun!

538
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,141
That's what I want to hear.

539
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,393
Minion, Code: Send In The Brain-bots.

540
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,604
You know,
the whole point of a code is...

541
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,773
Oh, Code: Just Do It, Minion.

542
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,400
<i>Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!</i>

543
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,904
- It's me, you fools!
- Bernard!

544
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,574
It's Daddy!

545
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,411
Megamind.

546
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,122
- What have you done with Bernard?
- Oh, Bernard? Oh, yes.

547
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,375
I'm doing horrible things to that man.

548
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,002
I don't want to get into it,
but lasers, spikes.

549
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,422
No, please! No!
Not the lasers and the spikes!

550
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,759
- You know the drill.
- No! Not the drill!

551
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,345
- Let him go or...
- Or what?

552
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,597
Or I'm gonna find out
what this weird-looking gun does.

553
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,058
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot that gun!

554
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,643
I'll just go get him.

555
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,271
- Unhand me, you fiend!
- Never!

556
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,648
His strength's too much!

557
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,192
I work out!

558
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,028
Well, it's really paying off!
You're so fit,

559
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,281
and strangely charismatic.

560
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,077
Are you OK?

561
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,080
I did my best, but he's too fantastic.

562
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,291
Here. Let me carry
that heavy gun for you.

563
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,917
I got us covered.

564
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,172
- Let go. It's mine!
- Bernard, run!

565
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,550
<i>Roxanne?</i>

566
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,510
- You're going to break it!
- Give it to me!

567
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,345
Oh, no!

568
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,602
Roxanne?!

569
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,067
Who on Earth is that?

570
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,203
- Help!
- Roxanne!

571
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,790
Bernard! You were right
about that door being exciting.

572
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,334
<i>- Intruder! Intruder!</i>
- This way.

573
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,002
<i>Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!</i>

574
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,215
What are you doing?

575
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,217
This'll stop them. Here!

576
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,178
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

577
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,807
- Just throw it!
- Daddy's sorry.

578
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,279
- That was really exciting.
- Yeah.

579
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,031
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.

580
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,034
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man
stand up to him like that.

581
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,286
- What's going on?
- Hal, what happened?

582
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,205
I think a bee flew up my nose.

583
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,041
I was just about to make
my frontal assault to rescue you,

584
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,878
but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me,
so I had to beat 'em all up,

585
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,964
and I did, and I... They were all,
like, crying and stuff...

586
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,300
- A brave one, isn't he?
- Who are you?

587
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,594
This is Bernard.
He's my partner.

588
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,138
- Partner?
- Yes. Yes. Partner.

589
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,393
Well, look, "partner", I'm her partner.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

590
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,894
She's been through
a traumatic experience.

591
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,522
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.

592
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,739
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

593
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,242
Yeah, OK. I'd like that.

594
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,077
That was weird for everybody,

595
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,246
'cause you accidentally hugged him
instead of me.

596
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,665
<i>Sir? Sir!</i>

597
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,251
<i>Code: Did You Find Out Who It Was?</i>

598
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,006
Code: Get The Car.

599
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,340
<i>Code: Right Away, Sir.</i>

600
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,600
- Bye-bye!
- See you tomorrow, Hal.

601
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,145
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
you want to check on me later.

602
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:22,401
Who is this man
we've infused with godlike power?

603
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,116
Well, sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's 28 years old.

604
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,577
No criminal record.
Actually no records at all.

605
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,288
Apparently this man hasn't
accomplished anything.

606
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,292
Not yet, Minion. Not... yet.

607
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,253
Could this day get anymore fun-tastic?

608
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:46,425
So, I will just go ahead and defuse him
since this is clearly a mistake.

609
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,553
No, Minion! There's something
much more powerful at work here.

610
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,265
This is no mistake. It's destiny.

611
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,896
Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!

612
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,398
Hal? Hal Shtewart?

613
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,317
- Hey! In the bed!
- Am I saying it right?

614
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:04,818
"Stewart".

615
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,779
Is this a robbery?

616
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,323
'Cause the lady across the hall
has way better stuff than me.

617
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,659
Look, it's Hal Stewart.
Quick, the spray.

618
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,162
All out.

619
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,498
- Well, use the Forget-Me Stick.
- Oh, right.

620
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,835
Just look at him.

621
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,465
No, he doesn't look quite
the hero-type to me.

622
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,342
You're such a pill, Minion.

623
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,512
A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.

624
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,056
I smell a hero.

625
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,600
I smell something burning.

626
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,811
I think it's working. Places! Places!

627
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,105
Places! Places! Places.

628
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,606
Do you have your disguise?

629
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,572
What?

630
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,366
You look fantastic.

631
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,753
Rise my glorious creation.

632
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,714
Rise, and come to Papa.

633
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:11,093
- What's going on?
- Easy my child.

634
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,512
- Who are you?
- I sent you to this planet

635
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,558
to teach you about justice,
honour, and nobility.

636
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,893
I am your father.

637
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,021
So you're like my space dad?

638
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,900
Yeah, I'm like your space dad.

639
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,194
And you are what?

640
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,072
I'm your space stepmom.

641
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,159
I've had some
work done recently.

642
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,119
Is this some kind of dream?

643
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,371
This is a dream come true.

644
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,708
You've been blessed
with unfathomable power.

645
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,751
- What kind of power?
- Unfathomable.

646
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,254
It's unf... without fathom.

647
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,674
Yeah. We've come to guide you

648
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,553
on your path
to be Metrocity's new hero

649
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,891
and battle the super-genius
of Megamind.

650
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,188
I know this is a lot to take in.

651
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,440
It may take months
for you to come to grips.

652
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,400
No freaking way!

653
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:10,402
I wasn't finished.

654
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,616
I'm gonna be a hero!

655
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,452
I'm gonna be a hero!

656
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,455
See, Minion, he's perfect!

657
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,083
And... action!

658
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,920
- Someone help me!
- I'm OK!

659
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,801
You... Bad!

660
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,637
Zap! Zap! Zap!

661
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,517
The flames of my evil burn bright.

662
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,269
Now you say something cool
back at me.

663
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,439
Look. It doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.

664
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:52,277
No, no, no, no, no. Stomach down,
hands up. Like Metro Man.

665
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,322
- Wait!
- Watch out.

666
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,911
He's hopeless. Hopeless!

667
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,664
- Maybe we should change tactics.
- You think so?

668
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,374
You know how boys are.

669
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,875
They love video games.

670
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,628
- I could throw a few parts together.
- Can't wait.

671
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,631
LOL. Smiley face.

672
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,091
Can't wait for what, sir?

673
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,219
That was such a funny story.

674
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,097
And brilliantly told, by the way.

675
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,807
OK, now you tell one.

676
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,434
Bernard, I never knew
you were so funny.

677
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,020
And I never heard you laugh before.

678
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,357
Yeah, it's been a while.
Feels pretty good.

679
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,905
And action.

680
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,326
Gotcha!

681
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,336
- You don't get out much, do you?
- Oh, what fun!

682
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,632
I used to come here
with my mother when I was a kid.

683
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,468
It was one of my favourite things to do.

684
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,888
Now look at it. It's a dump.

685
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,729
Why are we cleaning up the city, sir?

686
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:13,358
Well, we don't want to battle
our new hero in a dump now, do we?

687
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,407
They're all back. But how? Why?

688
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,951
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

689
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,541
That's it.

690
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,086
Be free, my beautiful dove!

691
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,009
OK, OK.

692
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,429
Metro Man and I were never a couple.

693
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,723
- But I thought you two were...
- I know. Everybody did.

694
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,559
It's just...
Well, he was never really my type.

695
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,019
Really?

696
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,229
OK, now you tell me something.

697
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,107
Something you've never told anyone.

698
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:58,403
Well, in sh... school...

699
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,282
none of the other kids
really liked me.

700
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,744
I was always the last one picked
for everything.

701
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,123
It's too bad that we didn't go
to the same school.

702
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,382
Hal, I think you're ready for this.

703
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,470
- Do I have a son?
- No.

704
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,305
You make me laugh.

705
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,432
It stretches. It's for you.

706
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,227
Hey, what's the T stand for?

707
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,728
Titan.

708
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,814
"Titan"?
What's that supposed to mean?

709
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,525
It was the only name
I could trademark.

710
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,571
Do you have someone special
in your life, Hal?

711
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,784
No, not yet. But... there's this
really, really good-looking one

712
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,036
I've got my eye on currently.

713
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,543
That's very good.

714
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,004
- Romance is very inspiring.
- That's what I hear.

715
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:03,051
All you have to do is
save her and she'll be yours.

716
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,845
- Who wants churros?
- I do!

717
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,098
- I do, yeah. Thanks, Space Stepmom.
- Churros all the way around.

718
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,851
On the count of three,
unsheathe your churro.

719
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,644
One, two, three!

720
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:13,937
To Titan!

721
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:19,276
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind,
and the city will know your name.

722
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,947
<i>...the city's parks restored
to their original glory,</i>

723
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,993
<i>the streets the safest they've been,
the banks reopened.</i>

724
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,078
<i>Has something happened to Megamind?</i>

725
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,956
<i>Has someone tamed this monster?</i>

726
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,293
<i>This is Roxanne Ritchi,
cautiously optimistic,</i>

727
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,503
<i>and pleasantly confused.</i>

728
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,672
Well, you seem
in a very good mood tonight, sir.

729
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,509
Oh, yes. How long is
this going to take, Minion?

730
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,553
Just a few alterations, sir,
and I will be done

731
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,889
with your most terrifying cape yet!

732
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,390
I'm calling it...

733
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:54,769
the Black Mamba...

734
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,563
Black Mamba. Perfect.

735
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,483
Gosh, I am running late.
I have to go.

736
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,735
What? Where...
Where are you going, sir?

737
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,154
We have our debut battle
with Titan tomorrow morning.

738
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,281
We haven't even tested
your big battle suit yet.

739
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:10,368
You attend to the details, Minion.
I have to... run a quick errand.

740
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,787
You don't run errands.

741
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,247
- What's going on here?
- What?

742
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,665
Wait a minute.

743
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:20,378
Are you wearing
Jean Paul Gaultier's Pour Homme?

744
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,924
It's just my natural musk.
Now, where are the car keys?

745
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,470
This is about Ms. Ritchi,
isn't it?

746
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,096
You're going on a date with her.

747
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,768
No, my main man.
Get out of town.

748
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:38,605
This is bad. This is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.

749
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:42,150
You are forgetting your place, Minion.
Now give me the keys.

750
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,322
What happens when Roxanne
finds out who you really are?

751
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,951
She will never find out.
That's the point of lying.

752
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,621
Honestly, if I didn't know
any better,

753
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,706
I'd think this was
your first day of being evil.

754
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,291
No!

755
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,711
This has gone far enough!

756
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,881
That was really grown-up!

757
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,135
Sir, please.
It's for your own good.

758
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,720
What do you know?

759
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,139
I may not know much,
but I do know this:

760
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,017
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

761
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,979
Maybe I don't want to be
the bad guy anymore.

762
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,150
You heard me!

763
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,069
Who are you?

764
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,114
- Now, give me the keys!
- No!

765
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,784
My sole purpose in life is
to look after you.

766
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,953
Well, I don't need you
to look after me.

767
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:38,373
What are you s... What are you saying?
You don't need me?

768
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:42,127
Let me make it clear.
Code: I Don't Need You.

769
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,129
You know what? You know what?

770
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,175
Code: I'll Just Pack My Thing And Go!

771
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,137
- Code: Fine!
- Code: Fine Back!

772
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,226
- Well, good luck on your date!
- I will!

773
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:01,104
- That doesn't even make any sense!
- I know!

774
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,472
I know I am so close. I can feel it.

775
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,728
OK, OK. I just have
to take a step back.

776
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,069
Wait a minute.

777
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,667
"Titan".

778
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,962
- What's a Titan?
- My super-ears are burning.

779
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:13,218
I usually just hear criminals.
You haven't been naughty, have you?

780
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,304
I'm totally messing with you.
I'm totally messing with you.

781
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,140
- The name's Titan.
- Titan.

782
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,810
Your very own heroic guardian
of pure awesome.

783
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,187
What's your name? Just kidding.
I know everything about you.

784
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:26,981
And I...
And I brought some flowers.

785
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,652
Didn't know what you liked, so I
just grabbed, you know, all of them.

786
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,864
OK. You don't like flowers?
OK, forget the flowers.

787
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,116
What do you want?

788
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,618
Thought maybe we could go
for a little flight around town.

789
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,286
Get to know each other first.

790
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:42,914
This must be
very thrilling for you.

791
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,416
What do you think you're doing?!

792
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,835
Oh, am I moving too fast?
You're probably right.

793
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,754
I should just rescue you a few times
before we get all romantic.

794
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,757
Saved ya.

795
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,801
You are lucky to have
such a great hero here.

796
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,804
- Don't you ever...
- Oh, no! Somebody do something!

797
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,932
Oh, right, right.
I gotcha. I gotcha.

798
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,314
That was a close one.
You almost died,

799
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,150
- but I saved you.
- Building!

800
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:19,242
Gotcha! I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

801
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,286
I couldn't hear you over the sound
of me saving your life.

802
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:22,996
Put me down! Right now!

803
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:25,665
OK, all right. All right, hold on.

804
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,711
Are you crazy?

805
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:33,047
I suppose I'm a,
I'm a little crazy, about you.

806
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,508
Who are you, really?

807
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:40,096
Oh, right. Well, prepare to have
your mind blown, little lady.

808
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,767
- Ta-da.
- Hal?

809
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,729
Yeah. Isn't this great?
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

810
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:51,191
- No. It's not great.
- Our first fight.

811
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,068
This is so us.
We're like an old married couple.

812
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,197
Look, there is no "us", OK?
There will never be an "us".

813
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,200
But... I have powers.

814
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,243
I have a cape. I'm the good guy.

815
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,871
You are a good guy, Hal,
but you don't understand.

816
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,915
- We need to find out why...
- No, no. This...

817
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,708
- Hal, just take a deep breath
- This isn't right!

818
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,627
- and listen to me for a moment.
- You're supposed to be with me!

819
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,087
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

820
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,758
It's Titan!
It's Titan, not Hal!

821
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,241
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.

822
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,745
- Sorry I'm late.
- Wow, your hair looks exciting.

823
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,790
Not the only exciting development
of the night.

824
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,544
Megamind's created a new hero,
and I know why.

825
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,090
It all makes sense now.
He missed getting his butt kicked,

826
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:58,550
so he created a new hero

827
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,385
- to kick it for him.
- Yeah.

828
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,929
But why would he pick Hal?

829
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,431
Hal is the worst possible person
you could pick.

830
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,934
That's a lot to take in.

831
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,936
It boggles my mind.

832
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:13,273
I am extremely boggled.
You know, I'm sure we'll get

833
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,233
to the bottom
of who's kicking whose butt.

834
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:20,029
But in the meantime,
let's enjoy each other's company.

835
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,866
I'm sorry, Bernard,
of course, you're right.

836
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,701
You know, I could use a breather.

837
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,161
To Bernard,

838
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:31,624
for being the only normal thing
in my crazy, upside-down world.

839
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,086
To... being normal.

840
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,223
- Roxanne?
- Yes?

841
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,102
Say I wasn't so normal.

842
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,898
Let's say I was bald
and had the complexion of,

843
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:59,986
of a popular primary colour,
as a random, non-specific example.

844
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,823
- Would you still enjoy my company?
- Of course!

845
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,869
You don't judge a book by its cover
or a person from the outside.

846
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,245
That's a relief to hear.

847
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,289
You judge them based on their actions.

848
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,084
Well, that seems kind of petty,
don't you think?

849
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,865
What? What?

850
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,787
Don't look at me!
Just a technical glitch!

851
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,206
Don't look yet!
Well, never mind that.

852
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,750
OK.

853
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,419
Where were we?

854
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,632
- You...
- Now, now, hold on.

855
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,258
You!

856
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,031
I can explain!

857
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,368
What about everything you just said?

858
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,578
About judging a book by its cover?

859
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,623
Well, let's take a look
at the contents then, shall we?

860
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,918
You destroyed Metro Man,
you took over the city,

861
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:42,880
and then, you actually got me
to care about you!

862
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,719
Why are you so evil?
Tricking me?

863
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,888
What could you possibly hope to gain?

864
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:59,981
Wait a minute.
I don't believe this.

865
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,904
Do you really think
that I would ever be with you?

866
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,950
No.

867
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,611
OK, Minion! You were right!

868
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:49,697
I was... less right!

869
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:53,618
We should stick
to what we're good at... being bad.

870
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,829
Minion?

871
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,099
You there!

872
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,102
Yeah, you.

873
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,146
Bring out the Black Mamba.

874
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:58,850
OK, Titan.
It's time to go down in style.

875
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:26,544
I hear there's a new hero
who dares challenge my evil.

876
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,380
Where is the one they call Titan?

877
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:36,220
Challenge me if you dare!

878
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,578
Oh no. We're gonna crash!

879
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,125
This is embarrassing.

880
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,968
Of all the inconsiderate,
bone-headed...

881
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,056
irresponsible, rude...

882
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,725
Unprofessional, that's what this is!

883
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,145
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

884
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,314
Of course not! He was a pro!

885
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:31,400
Hey, Megamind!
You're actually the guy I want to see.

886
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,944
Also, there's a door here.

887
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,864
Do you have any idea
how long I waited for you?

888
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,407
No, no, no, I totally understand
what you're saying.

889
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,868
Could you just, just shut up for one
second. I'm trying to beat this level.

890
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,412
Were you even planning
on showing up?

891
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,706
What's this?

892
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,669
Where did you get all this stuff?

893
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,462
It doesn't belong to me.

894
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,506
- You stole it?
- Pretty cool, right?

895
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:57,051
- No, no, no, no! You're a hero!
- Being a hero is for losers!

896
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,096
It's work, work, work,
24/7, and for what?

897
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,390
I only took the gig to get the girl,

898
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,892
and it turns out Roxanne
doesn't want anything to do with me.

899
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,812
- Roxanne Ritchi?
- Yeah! Roxanne Ritchi!

900
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,356
I saw her having dinner
and making googly eyes

901
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,441
at some intellectual dweeb!

902
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,860
Who needs all that noise?

903
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,905
That's why I think we should team up.

904
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,865
You... Wait... What?

905
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,159
With my power,
and your big-headedness,

906
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,371
- we could rule the city!
- You want to team up?

907
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,206
I even drew up
some new costume designs, see?

908
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,666
- Costume designs?
- You'd be the brains,

909
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,167
so you'd get a little brain,

910
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,794
wearing glasses on your costume,
or something.

911
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,963
And since I'm the cool one,
I'd have, like,

912
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,549
two tanks swordfighting...

913
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,884
I can't believe you.

914
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,721
All your gifts, all your powers,

915
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,474
and you... you squander them
for your own personal gain.

916
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:48,561
- Yes!
- No! I'm the villain!

917
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,771
You're the good guy!
I do something bad,

918
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:54,442
and you come and get me!
That's why I created you.

919
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:58,446
Yeah, right. You're nuts.
Space Dad told me...

920
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,865
Look, I'm your space dad!

921
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,452
You should be more like Metro Man.

922
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,414
- You tricked me?
- Don't like that?

923
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:09,749
Well, there's more.

924
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:15,254
I'm also the intellectual dweeb
dating Roxanne.

925
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:19,175
- No.
- And we were smooching up a storm!

926
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,471
When I get my hands on you,
I'm gonna...

927
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,307
Yes! Yes, I know!
Bring me to justice.

928
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,934
God, how I've missed this.

929
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,899
And the hero strikes the first blow.

930
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:37,360
But evil returns with a backhand!

931
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,948
Yes!

932
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,417
Come out, you little freak!

933
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,962
I want to see what that big brain
looks like on the pavement!

934
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,555
You fell for the oldest
evil trick in the book!

935
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:08,974
You little blue twerp!

936
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,104
En garde!

937
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,111
Now that's the spirit!

938
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,780
Parry! Thrust! Parry again!

939
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:26,158
Now it's time for some witty
back and forth banter!

940
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,160
You go first!

941
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,788
OK! Look, I'm not sure
where to go with that!

942
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,542
This one's for stealing
my girlfriend!

943
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,842
This one's for Space Dad making
a fool out of me!

944
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:54,937
And, Megamind, this one's
for Space Stepmom! You lied to her!

945
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:59,442
Well done. I thought
that battle went really, really well.

946
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,610
- I mean, I have a few notes.
- Notes?

947
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,863
But they can wait.
You can take me to jail now.

948
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:07,783
No, no. I was thinking
more like the morgue. You're dead!

949
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,161
This isn't how you play the game.

950
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,288
Game over.

951
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,378
Brain-bots!

952
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:26,635
I'm calling time out!

953
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,473
Time out? Time out! Time out!

954
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,985
Brain-bots,
initiate the fail-safe.

955
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:54,497
Guess what, Buster Brown?
It's made from copper.

956
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,290
You're powerless against it.

957
01:03:56,458 --> 01:04:00,794
It's the very same metal used
to defeat... Metro Man?

958
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,507
You should stop comparing me
to Metro Man!

959
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,602
You can run, Megamind,
but you can't hide!

960
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,812
We're saved! We're saved!

961
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,439
What's your name, new hero?

962
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,816
- It's Titan.
- Thank you!

963
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,569
Thank you! Titan has freed us!

964
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:30,241
I wouldn't say "free".
More like under new management.

965
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:38,123
- What do you want?
- Titan's turned evil.

966
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,293
Congratulations. Another one of your
genius plans has backfired on you.

967
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,629
And why did my doorman let you up?

968
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,257
Carlos.

969
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,426
Please, Roxanne, no. No.
I need your help.

970
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,262
Why do you need my help?

971
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,808
Because you're
the smartest person I know.

972
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,644
But you can't hide here.

973
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,980
The copper should have worked.
Why didn't the copper work?

974
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,648
The copper worked
perfectly well last time.

975
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,650
Copper? You're not making any sense.

976
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,610
Look, if we don't find
Titan's weakness,

977
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,320
he'll destroy the whole city.

978
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,826
- OK, how can I help?
- We need to find answers.

979
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,663
You knew Metro Man best.
Did he have a hideout? A cave?

980
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:22,543
A solitary fortress of some kind?
Anything that would give us clues.

981
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:25,337
Well... there is one place I know.

982
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:30,593
You gave him these powers.
Can't you just take them away?

983
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,347
I can't. I lost my defuser gun
when I misplaced the invisible car.

984
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:40,352
The night you dumped me. Alone.
In the rain.

985
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:42,938
Did you ever look back?

986
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:46,275
- No!
- My giant blue head!

987
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,568
I guess we're here.

988
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,282
So, this is where he hid it.

989
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:57,828
After all these years.
My old shoolhouse.

990
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,375
You know, I think there's an apology
in order for the other night.

991
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,586
OK, that would be nice,
but make it quick.

992
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:07,713
We have much more
pressing matters to deal with.

993
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:16,305
I can't believe he kept all this stuff.

994
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,099
I remember when he wore that.

995
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:22,770
- Shouldn't we try to stay focused here?
- Yes, of course. Right. Focused.

996
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,939
Hey. Come over and look at this.

997
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,233
What is it? What did you find?

998
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,321
Look.

999
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,324
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1000
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,826
Yes, that's what happens
when water gets cold.

1001
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:41,163
No, what I'm saying is,
don't you think it's a little odd

1002
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,540
that the ice hasn't melted yet?

1003
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,376
One of life's great mysteries.

1004
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,258
Hey.

1005
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,814
<i>We now have confirmed reports.</i>

1006
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:10,734
<i>Titan, first thought to be
this city's new hero, has turned evil.</i>

1007
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:13,779
<i>The city has never seen
this level of destruction.</i>

1008
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,864
<i>If only Metro Man were still alive.</i>

1009
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,866
- You're alive?
- You're alive.

1010
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,786
- I'm alive.
- But I, we...

1011
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,122
We saw your skeleton!
You were dead!

1012
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,249
Are you a ghost?

1013
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,711
There had better be
an amazing explanation for this.

1014
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,838
Speak, apparition.

1015
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,642
OK.

1016
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,477
You both deserve the truth.

1017
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,896
It all started
back at the observatory.

1018
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,316
<i>Roxanne was kidnapped.
I was gonna stop you.</i>

1019
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,653
<i>My head wasn't in the game that day.</i>

1020
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:56,989
<i>We were kind
of going through the motions.</i>

1021
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:01,160
<i>So... using my super-speed,</i>

1022
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,494
<i>I decided to go clear my head.</i>

1023
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:03,996
<i>Fire!</i>

1024
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,331
<i>Then I realised,</i>

1025
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:10,461
<i>we had done this same silly charade
our entire lives.</i>

1026
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:14,089
<i>I tried to get my mind off
how I was feeling,</i>

1027
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,175
<i>but I just felt stuck.</i>

1028
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:21,221
<i>I began to realise,
despite all my powers,</i>

1029
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:25,851
<i>each and every citizen of Metro
had something I didn't: a choice.</i>

1030
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:30,981
<i>Ever since I can remember, I've always
had to be what the city wanted me to be.</i>

1031
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,359
<i>But what about what I wanted to do?</i>

1032
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,070
<i>Then it suddenly hit me.</i>

1033
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,948
<i>I do have a choice.</i>

1034
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,327
<i>I can be whatever I want to be.</i>

1035
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,871
<i>No one said this hero thing had to be
a lifetime gig.</i>

1036
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:48,123
<i>You can't just quit, either.</i>

1037
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:54,129
<i>That's when I got the brilliant idea...
to fake my death.</i>

1038
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:57,508
Copper drains my powers.

1039
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,593
<i>Your weakness is copper?</i>

1040
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:04,556
<i>Once your death ray hit,
I'd never felt so alive.</i>

1041
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,851
<i>So I borrowed a prop
from a nearby nursing school.</i>

1042
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,355
<i>Metro Man was finally dead.</i>

1043
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:12,689
And Music Man was born!

1044
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,108
- Music Man?
- That way I could keep my logo.

1045
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,360
- 'Cause of wha...?
- Come again?

1046
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:20,072
I was finally free to get in touch
with my true power...

1047
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,574
weaving lyrical magic.

1048
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:23,992
Check this out.

1049
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,246
<i>I have eyes that can see</i>

1050
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:31,333
<i>Right through lead...</i>

1051
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,502
- You're horrible!
- Granted, you have talent.

1052
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,381
But there's a madman
out there destroying our... your city.

1053
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,591
How could you do this?!

1054
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,720
The people of this city relied on you,
and you deserted them!

1055
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,640
You left us in the hands of him!

1056
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:49,184
- No offence.
- No, I'm with you.

1057
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,311
Look, we need your help.

1058
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:54,106
I'm sorry. I really am.

1059
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,775
I'm done.

1060
01:09:56,943 --> 01:10:00,445
You know, little buddy,
there's a yin for every yang.

1061
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,740
If there's bad,
good will rise up against it.

1062
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,202
It's taken me a long time
to find my calling.

1063
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,873
Now it's about time you find yours.

1064
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:17,963
Hey, who needs him?

1065
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,840
We can beat Titan ourselves.

1066
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:22,968
I say we go back to the evil lair,
grab some ray guns,

1067
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,762
hold him sideways,
and just go all gangsta on him.

1068
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:27,973
We can't.

1069
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,933
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1070
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:35,147
I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day,
I don't fly off into the sunset,

1071
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:37,900
and I don't get the girl.

1072
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,943
I'm going home.

1073
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:13,352
<i>Unless someone comes
to our aid soon, all may be lost.</i>

1074
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,856
<i>Thousands have already fled the city
in a mass exodus.</i>

1075
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,985
<i>Remaining citizens are warned
to stay indoors until further notice.</i>

1076
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,197
<i>Authorities have issued a warning</i>

1077
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:28,700
<i>to stay out of the downtown area
at all costs.</i>

1078
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,255
Hal!

1079
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,633
Hal!

1080
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,595
Let me guess.
After seeing how awesome I am,

1081
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:52,099
you've finally come to your senses?
Well, I'm over you.

1082
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:55,477
- I've come to stop you, Hal.
- You?

1083
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,646
OK, what are you gonna do,
report me to death?

1084
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,856
I was going to try reasoning with you.

1085
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:04,111
You and I, we worked together
for a long time. I know you.

1086
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:07,823
You don't know me.
You never took the time to know me.

1087
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,325
This is the first time
we've hung out socially,

1088
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,327
and it's when
I'm about to destroy the city!

1089
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,246
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1090
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:16,665
I want to talk to the guy
who loved being a cameraman,

1091
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,251
and eating dip, and being a nerd,

1092
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,503
and being not as scary
as the Tighten Hal.

1093
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:22,838
Too late!

1094
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,049
<i>...interrupting our scheduled...</i>

1095
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,010
<i>extraordinary events
taking place...</i>

1096
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,928
<i>Heat in the valley and...</i>

1097
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,263
<i>Megamind!</i>

1098
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,226
<i>You and I have
some unfinished business.</i>

1099
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,936
<i>I'll be waiting at Metro Tower.</i>

1100
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,564
<i>Oh, and just
so you don't get cold feet...</i>

1101
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,608
Roxanne.

1102
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:47,446
<i>Come on, Roxie, call for your hero
to come rescue you.</i>

1103
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:53,285
<i>Megamind, I don't even know
if you're listening, but if you are,</i>

1104
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,746
<i>you can't give up.</i>

1105
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,251
<i>The Megamind I knew
would never have run from a fight,</i>

1106
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:04,963
<i>even when he knew he had
absolutely no chance of winning.</i>

1107
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,591
<i>It was your best quality.</i>

1108
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:10,844
<i>You need to be that guy right now.</i>

1109
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:14,181
<i>The city needs you.</i>

1110
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,393
<i>I need you.</i>

1111
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,644
Roxanne.

1112
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,146
<i>You have one hour.</i>

1113
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,648
<i>Don't keep me waiting.</i>

1114
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:29,488
Warden! Warden! Listen to me!
You have to let me go!

1115
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,656
Tighten has to be stopped!

1116
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:35,243
Sorry, Megamind.
You still have 88 life sentences to go.

1117
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,579
Plenty of time to reflect
on what you've done.

1118
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:41,583
Did you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.

1119
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:45,253
Here it is,
from the blackest part of my heart.

1120
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,967
I am sorry!

1121
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,305
Not buying it.

1122
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,392
I don't blame you.

1123
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,729
I've terrorised this city
countless times.

1124
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:06,483
Created a hero
who's turned out to be a villain.

1125
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,070
I lied to Roxanne, and...

1126
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:15,033
my best friend Minion,
I treated like dirt.

1127
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,538
Please don't make this city...

1128
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,084
don't make Roxanne
pay for my wrongdoings.

1129
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,881
Apology accepted.

1130
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,763
Oh, Minion, you fantastic fish, you.

1131
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,891
What are we waiting for?
We'd better get going.

1132
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,229
You got me.

1133
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,192
- Good luck, fellas!
- We're gonna die!

1134
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:51,736
Wait, what?

1135
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:56,032
<i>Hey, Metro losers.
This is Metro Tower.</i>

1136
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,327
<i>They say it's supposed to be
a symbol of our city's strength.</i>

1137
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,580
But for me,
it's a reminder of the day

1138
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:07,127
this woman ferociously ripped
out my heart. And I hate reminders!

1139
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,725
Help!

1140
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:27,564
Please don't do this. I know
there's still good in you, Hal.

1141
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,232
You're so naive, Roxie.

1142
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,360
You see the good in everybody,
even when it's not there.

1143
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,613
You're living a fantasy.

1144
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,033
There is no Easter Bunny,
there is no Tooth Fairy,

1145
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,035
and there is no Queen of England.

1146
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:44,206
This is the real world,
and you need to wake up!

1147
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:59,179
<i>You dare challenge Megamind?</i>

1148
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:02,432
This town isn't big enough
for two super-villains!

1149
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,229
<i>Oh, you're a villain all right!
Just not a super one!</i>

1150
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,314
Yeah? What's the difference?

1151
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,736
Presentation!

1152
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,842
- I knew you'd come back.
- Well, that made one of us.

1153
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,040
- What's the plan?
- Well, it mostly involves not dying.

1154
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,500
I like that plan.

1155
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,853
Building!

1156
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,356
Go faster!
Make this thing go faster!

1157
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,234
I can't control it!

1158
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:52,917
No.

1159
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,380
Well, that was easy.

1160
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,841
Looks like there's
only one loose end now.

1161
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:14,272
Please, let's have a little respect
for public transportation.

1162
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,399
You came back!

1163
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:19,694
You were right, Roxanne.
I never should have left.

1164
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:22,155
I thought you were dead.

1165
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:25,575
My death was... greatly exaggerated.

1166
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:28,495
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1167
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,470
I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

1168
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,973
I'm so proud of you.

1169
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,270
Minion?

1170
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,940
Surprise!

1171
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,984
He's the real hero.

1172
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:08,201
Megamind.

1173
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,496
Going somewhere?

1174
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:13,540
Besides jail?

1175
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:22,549
No, not in the face, man. Please.

1176
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:26,177
If you know what's good for you,
Tighten, you'll stay out of Metrocity!

1177
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,762
- You got it!
- For good!

1178
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,883
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1179
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,219
But there's only one person I know
who calls this town "Metrocity".

1180
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,389
You.

1181
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,811
Bet you think it's really funny?

1182
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:20,273
Let's all laugh
at the really cool guy?

1183
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,236
Well, you're not gonna be laughing
for long.

1184
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,405
The invisible car.

1185
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,574
Hey! Remember that night
that I dumped you?

1186
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:33,119
You're bringing this up now?

1187
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:34,496
Well, I did look back!

1188
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,833
You did? You did?

1189
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:42,504
Yes! And you should look back
right now!

1190
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,423
Oh, I get it!

1191
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:55,850
This is the last time
you make a fool out of me!

1192
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,269
I made you a hero.

1193
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:02,524
You did the fool thing
all by yourself.

1194
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,281
You're so pathetic.

1195
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:14,077
No matter what side you're on,
you're always the loser.

1196
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,371
There's a benefit to losing.

1197
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:18,790
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1198
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,713
You've got to be kidding me!

1199
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,132
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

1200
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,436
Enjoy your flight!

1201
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,107
Megamind!

1202
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,950
<i>So this is how it ends.</i>

1203
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,246
<i>Normally, I'd chalk this up
to my last glorious failure.</i>

1204
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,332
<i>But not today.</i>

1205
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,420
<i>What can I say?
Old habits die hard.</i>

1206
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,053
Say bye-bye, Roxie.

1207
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:20,768
Ollo.

1208
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:33,114
The thing about bad guys,
they always lose!

1209
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,163
- You did it. You won.
- Well...

1210
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:44,751
I finally had a reason to win. You.

1211
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:55,011
Minion!

1212
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:59,265
Can't see. It's cold and... warm,
and dark and light.

1213
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,476
It's me, Minion. I'm right here.

1214
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:04,729
We've had a lot of adventures together,
you and I.

1215
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,481
We have, Minion.

1216
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:13,279
I mean... most of them
ended in horrible failure,

1217
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:17,992
but we won today. Didn't we, sir?

1218
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,829
Yes, Minion, we did it.
Thanks to you.

1219
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:26,250
Code: We're The Good Guys Now.

1220
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,212
Code: I Guess We Are.

1221
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:33,424
I'm going!
I think this, this is it!

1222
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,594
I'm going... going far...

1223
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,439
What a drama queen.

1224
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:52,527
You know, I'm feeling much better now.
I guess I just needed a swim.

1225
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,278
He had you, didn't he?

1226
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,531
Classic Minion.
Don't give me that face.

1227
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,282
He reels you in with that little face.

1228
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,284
- Look at that face.
- We did it!

1229
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,078
We did it!

1230
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,955
- Fist pump!
- You did it!

1231
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,707
We won, we won, we won!

1232
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:09,711
Get back, you savages!

1233
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:14,048
Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used
to positive feedback.

1234
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:21,139
<i>Funny, I guess destiny is
not the path given to us...</i>

1235
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:27,061
<i>but the path
we choose for ourselves.</i>

1236
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:37,572
All right, put your hands in the air.

1237
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,326
Now hand over your wallets.

1238
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:46,247
I'm just kidding!

1239
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,498
Just kidding!

1240
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:51,878
<i>I have to admit,
being good has its perks.</i>

1241
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,840
You know, you look
pretty good in white.

1242
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,217
Megamind, if you plea...

1243
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,558
Hey. My kid can't see.

1244
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,602
Sorry, my friend.

1245
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,564
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew he had it in him.

1246
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,691
Ladies and gentlemen,

1247
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:17,945
Megamind, defender of Metro City!

1248
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:22,992
<i>You know,
I like the sound of that.</i>

1249
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,452
Hit it!

1250
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:37,590
Megamind! Megamind!
Megamind! Megamind!

1251
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:47,517
I'm bad! I'm bad! That's right. Yeah!

Sir, you really need to empty
your pockets more often.

1263
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,564
This has been the worst day
of my entire life.

1264
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:42,233
No worries.
