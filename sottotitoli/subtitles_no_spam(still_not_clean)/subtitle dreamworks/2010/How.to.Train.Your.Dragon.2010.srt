1
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,519
<i>This is Berk.</i>

2
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>It's 12 days north of hopeless</i>

3
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:05,274
<i>and a few degrees south
of freezing to death.</i>

4
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,611
<i>It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.</i>

5
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:13,241
<i>My village. In a word, sturdy.</i>

6
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:18,162
<i>It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.</i>

7
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:23,042
<i>We have fishing, hunting,
and a charming view of the sunsets.</i>

8
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,503
<i>The only problems are the pests.</i>

9
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,633
<i>You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.</i>

10
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,718
<i>We have...</i>

11
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,139
Dragons.

12
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,685
<i>Most people would leave. Not us.</i>

13
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,647
<i>We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.</i>

14
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:47,775
<i>My name is Hiccup.</i>

15
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,612
<i>Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.</i>

16
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:55,074
<i>Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.</i>

17
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:57,535
<i>Like our charming Viking
demeanor wouldn't do that.</i>

18
00:01:58,953 --> 00:01:59,912
Morning!

19
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,958
- What are you doing here?
- Get inside!

20
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,585
- What are you doing out?
- Get back inside!

21
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,507
Hiccup! What is he doing out?

22
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,551
What are you doing out? Get inside!

23
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,638
<i>That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.</i>

24
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,348
<i>They say when he was a baby,</i>

25
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:22,518
<i>he popped a dragon's head
clean off of its shoulders.</i>

26
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,937
<i>Do I believe it? Yes, I do.</i>

27
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,022
What have we got?

28
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,984
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
And Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.

29
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,738
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.

30
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:34,655
Good.

31
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,407
Hoist the torches!

32
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,042
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!

33
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:50,838
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

34
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,050
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.

35
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,968
They need toothpicks, don't they?

36
00:02:57,053 --> 00:03:00,348
<i>The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.</i>

37
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,769
<i>I've been his apprentice ever
since I was little. Well, littler.</i>

38
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,357
We move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,524
Hurry!

40
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,112
<i>See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.</i>

41
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,530
Fire!

42
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,823
Let's go!

43
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:22,661
<i>That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut,</i>

44
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,413
<i>and...</i>

45
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,625
<i>Astrid.</i>

46
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,595
<i>Their job is so much cooler.</i>

47
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:40,930
Eh!

48
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,517
Aw, come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,520
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

50
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,522
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

51
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,858
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

52
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,903
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an ax.

53
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,446
You can't even throw one of these!

54
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,243
Okay, fine, but this will throw it for me.

55
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,412
Oh!

56
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,081
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

57
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,542
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!

58
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,920
If you ever want to get
out there to fight dragons

59
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,965
you need to stop all this.

60
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,175
But you just pointed to all of me.

61
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,137
Yes, that's it! Stop being all of you.

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,596
Oh.

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,848
Oh, yes.

64
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,725
You, sir, are playing a dangerous game.

65
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:31,397
Keeping this much raw
Vikingness contained?

66
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,648
There will be consequences!

67
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,818
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.

68
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:42,158
<i>One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon</i>

69
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,951
<i>is everything around here.</i>

70
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,497
<i>A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.</i>

71
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,541
<i>Gronckles are tough.</i>

72
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,669
<i>Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend.</i>

73
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,005
<i>A Zippleback?</i>

74
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,050
<i>Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.</i>

75
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,469
They found the sheep!

76
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,804
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

77
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,431
- Hurry up!
- Fire!

78
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,893
<i>And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare.</i>

79
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,021
<i>Only the best Vikings go after those.</i>

80
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,649
<i>They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.</i>

81
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,362
Reload! I'll take care of this.

82
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:26,869
<i>But the ultimate prize is the dragon
no one's ever seen. We call it the...</i>

83
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,162
Night Fury!

84
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,164
Get down!

85
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,084
Jump!

86
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,506
<i>This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...</i>

87
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,675
<i>never misses.</i>

88
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:46,472
<i>No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.</i>

89
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,100
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

90
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,355
Stay. Put. There.

91
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,526
You know what I mean.

92
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,362
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!

93
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,821
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!

94
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,787
Let's get him!

95
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:14,041
Mind yourselves!
The devils still have some juice in them!

96
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,596
Come on. Give me something to shoot at.
Give me something to shoot at.

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,154
Oof!

98
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,955
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

99
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,665
Did anybody see that?

100
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,793
Except for you.

101
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:03,591
Ugh!

102
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,010
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!

103
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,238
You're all out.

104
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,205
<i>Oh, and there's one more
thing you need to know.</i>

105
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,384
Sorry, Dad.

106
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,687
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

107
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:03,400
Whaa! It's not like the last few times,
Dad! I really, actually hit it!

108
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,153
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.

109
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,657
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

110
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,616
Stop!

111
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,243
Just stop.

112
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,705
Every time you step outside,
disaster follows.

113
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,916
Can you not see that I have
bigger problems?

114
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,670
Winter is almost here and I have
an entire village to feed!

115
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,464
Between you and me,
the village could do

116
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,758
with a little less feeding,
don't you think?

117
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,010
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

118
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:33,222
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

119
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:38,143
I can't stop myself.
I see a dragon and I have to just kill it.

120
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,145
It's who I am, Dad.

121
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,651
Agh... You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.

122
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:49,071
Get back to the house.
Make sure he gets there.

123
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,116
I have his mess to clean up.

124
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,035
Quite the performance.

125
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,788
I've never seen anyone mess up that badly.
That helped.

126
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,332
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.

127
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,834
Ow!

128
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,088
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.

129
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,298
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.

130
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,385
When he does,
it's with this disappointed scowl,

131
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,804
like someone skimped
on the meat in his sandwich.

132
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,183
"Excuse me, barmaid.
I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring.

133
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:23,105
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms,
extra guts and glory on the side.

134
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,316
This here, this is a talking fishbone."

135
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,235
You're thinking about this all wrong.

136
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:33,073
It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

137
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,325
Thank you for summing that up.

138
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,621
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard
to be something you're not.

139
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,790
I just want to be one of you guys.

140
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,137
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

141
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,973
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

142
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,267
If we find the nest and destroy it,

143
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,604
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

144
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,148
One more search before the ice sets in.

145
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,275
Those ships never come back.

146
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:12,488
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.
Now, who's with me?

147
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,323
Count me out.

148
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,492
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my ax returns.

149
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,620
All right.
Those who stay will look after Hiccup.

150
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,538
- To the ships!
- I'm with you, Stoick!

151
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,664
That's more like it.

152
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,084
Right, I'll pack my undies.

153
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,046
No, I need you to stay
and train some new recruits.

154
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,801
Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

155
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,137
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

156
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,139
What could possibly go wrong?

157
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,433
What am I going to do with him, Gobber?

158
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,935
Put him in training with the others.

159
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,312
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

160
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,357
He'd be killed before you let
the first dragon out of its cage.

161
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,067
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.

162
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,693
- No, you don't.
- No, actually, I do.

163
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:52,903
No, you don't.

164
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,030
Listen, you know what he's like.

165
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,700
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

166
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,872
He doesn't listen.
He has the attention span of a sparrow.

167
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,459
I take him fishing and he goes
hunting for... for trolls!

168
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,337
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.

169
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,006
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

170
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,925
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.

171
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,970
...my father told me to bang my head
against a rock and I did it.

172
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,931
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

173
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,933
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.

174
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,310
That rock split in two.

175
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,397
It taught me what a Viking
could do, Gobber.

176
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,776
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

177
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,948
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.

178
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,617
Hiccup is not that boy.

179
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,995
You can't stop him, Stoick.

180
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,872
You can only prepare him.

181
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,082
I know it seems hopeless,

182
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,877
but the truth is,
you won't always be around to protect him.

183
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,380
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

184
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,443
Oh, the gods hate me.

185
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,779
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

186
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,407
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

187
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,784
Ow!

188
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,501
Oh, wow. I did it.

189
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,672
Oh, I did it.
This fixes everything! Yes!

190
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,674
I have brought down this mighty beast!

191
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,871
I'm going to kill you, dragon.

192
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,458
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.

193
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,379
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

194
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,498
I did this.

195
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,441
Agh...

196
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,740
Hiccup.

197
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,700
Dad... Uh...

198
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,453
I have to talk to you, Dad.

199
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,455
I need to speak with you, too, son.

200
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,626
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.

201
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,669
- What?
- What?

202
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,547
- Uh... You go first.
- No, you go first.

203
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,881
All right.

204
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,302
You get your wish.
Dragon training, you start in the morning.

205
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,638
Oh, man, I should have gone first.
'Cause... Uh...

206
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,557
I was thinking, you know,

207
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,726
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

208
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,439
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?

209
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:22,649
You'll need this.

210
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,901
I don't want to fight dragons.

211
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,028
Come on. Yes, you do.

212
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,532
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

213
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,450
But you will kill dragons.

214
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,787
No, I'm really very
extra-sure that I won't.

215
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,831
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

216
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,083
This is serious, son.

217
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,088
When you carry this ax...
you carry all of us with you.

218
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,259
Which means you walk like us,
you talk like us,

219
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,386
you think like us.

220
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,638
No more of... this.

221
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,807
You just gestured to all of me.

222
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,186
- Deal?
- This conversation feels very one-sided.

223
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,228
Deal?

224
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,773
Deal.

225
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,401
Good.

226
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,945
Train hard.

227
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,114
I'll be back.

228
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,032
Probably.

229
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,034
And I'll be here.

230
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:15,994
Maybe.

231
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,915
Welcome to dragon training!

232
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,125
No turning back.

233
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,895
I hope I get some serious burns.

234
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,649
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like, on my shoulder or my back.

235
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,901
Yeah, it's only fun
if you get a scar out of it.

236
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,361
Yeah, no kidding, right?

237
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,488
Pain. Love it.

238
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,365
Oh, great. Who let him in?

239
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,201
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best

240
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,204
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon

241
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,914
in front of the entire village.

242
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,252
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him or...

243
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,004
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

244
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:12,592
Don't worry. You're small and weak.
That'll make you less of a target.

245
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,511
They'll see you as sick or insane

246
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,847
and go after the more
"Viking-like" teens instead.

247
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,518
Behind these doors are just
a few of the many species

248
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,560
you will learn to fight!

249
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,230
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.

250
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,731
The Hideous Zippleback.

251
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,275
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

252
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,443
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.

253
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,862
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.

254
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,656
Can you stop that?

255
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,534
And the Gronckle.

256
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,327
Jaw strength 8.

257
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,454
Whoa!
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?

258
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,124
I believe in learning on the job.

259
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:51,423
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted... you're dead!

260
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,049
Quick!
What's the first thing you'll need?

261
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,093
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?

262
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,886
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!

263
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,974
Your most important piece
of equipment is your shield!

264
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,394
If you must make a choice between
a sword or a shield, take the shield!

265
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,312
Whoa!

266
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,188
- Get your hands off!
- There are a million shields!

267
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,441
Take that one. It has a flower.
Girls like flowers.

268
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,693
Oops, now this one has blood on it.

269
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,780
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?

270
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,199
Those shields are good for another thing.

271
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:22,162
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!

272
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,999
All dragons have a limited
number of shots.

273
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,209
How many does a Gronckle have?

274
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,836
- Five?
- No, six!

275
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,713
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!

276
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,591
Fishlegs, out!

277
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,801
Hiccup, get in there!

278
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:43,099
By the way, I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.

279
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,809
You look like you work out.

280
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,603
Snotlout! You're done!

281
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,855
I guess it's just you and me, huh?

282
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,565
Nope, just you.

283
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,942
One shot left!

284
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,612
Hiccup!

285
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,455
And that's six.

286
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:09,000
Go back to bed, you overgrown sausage!

287
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,338
You'll get another chance,
don't you worry.

288
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,800
Remember, a dragon will always,

289
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:20,595
always go for the kill.

290
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,521
So why didn't you?

291
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,383
This was stupid.

292
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,596
Why don't you just fly away?

293
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,843
All right, where did Astrid
go wrong in the ring today?

294
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,763
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.

295
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,474
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.

296
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,726
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."

297
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,312
She's right.
You have to be tough on yourselves.

298
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,314
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

299
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,816
- Uh... He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.

300
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,860
He's never where he should be.

301
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,029
Thank you, Astrid.

302
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,700
You need to live and breathe this stuff.
The dragon manual.

303
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,788
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

304
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,290
Hmm...

305
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,834
No attacks tonight. Study up.

306
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,461
Wait, you mean read?

307
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,837
While we're still alive?

308
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,131
Why read words when you
can just kill the stuff

309
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,800
the words tell you stuff about?

310
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,886
I've read it, like, seven times.
There's this water dragon

311
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,765
that sprays boiling water at your face.
And there's this other one...

312
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,141
Yeah. That sounds great.

313
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,894
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...

314
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,397
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.

315
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,775
Another one has spines, like, trees.

316
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,527
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

317
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:27,615
Ah... All mine, then. Wow.
So, okay, I'll see you...

318
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,285
...tomorrow.

319
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,629
"Dragon classifications.

320
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:45,008
Strike class. Fear class. Mystery class."

"Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

322
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,100
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

323
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,810
that can kill a man at close range.

324
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,521
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight."

325
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,817
"Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor-sharp wings

326

"Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim.

329
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,913
Agh!

00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:23,171
"Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight."

331
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,924
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,845
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death!

Burns its victims. Buries its victims.

334
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,060
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.

335
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,188
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

336
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,399
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.
Kill on sight.

hide and pray it does not find you."

342
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,226
I can almost smell them.

343
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,686
They're close.

344
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,522
Steady.

345
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,200
Take us in.

346
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,495
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.

347
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,205
Hard to port!

348
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,544
Steady!

349
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,559
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice

350
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,602
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

351
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:05,898
Is there, like, another book or a sequel?
Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet?

352
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,193
- Whoa!
- Focus, Hiccup!

353
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,612
You're not even trying!

354
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,074
Today is all about attack!

355
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,202
Nadders are quick and light on their feet.

356
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,330
- Your job is to be quicker and lighter!
- Whoa!

357
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,085
I'm really beginning to question
your teaching methods!

358
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,838
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

359
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,340
Find it, hide in it, and strike!

360
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,134
Ugh!

361
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,136
Do you ever bathe?

362
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,805
If you don't like it,
then just get your own blind spot.

363
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,099
How about I give you one?

364
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,312
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.

365
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,191
Hey, so, how would one
sneak up on a Night Fury?

366
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,903
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Now, get in there!

367
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,405
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!

368
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,907
Get down.

369
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,506
Watch out, babe. I'll take care of this.

370
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,176
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

371
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,012
What do you want me to do,
block out the sun?

372
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,306
I could do that but
I don't have time right now!

373
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:26,187
They probably take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.

374
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,564
Has anyone ever seen one napping?

375
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,191
Hiccup!

376
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,985
Hiccup!

377
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,533
- Ooh... Love on the battlefield.
- She could do better.

378
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,493
Let me... Why don't you...

379
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,630
Well done, Astrid.

380
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:56,050
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

381
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,762
Our parents' war is about to become ours.

382
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,973
Figure out which side you're on.

383
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,639
Huh. Toothless.

384
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,183
I could have sworn you had...

385
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:31,938
...teeth.

386
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:37,151
Uh... Uh... I... No, no, no.

387
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,655
I don't have any more!

388
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:47,828
Ugh!

389
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,644
Uh...

390
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,523
- Mmm...
- Hmm?

391
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,025
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,570
Hmm.

393
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,411
Ugh!

394
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:31,640
Hmm?

395
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:41,353
And with one twist,
he took my hand and swallowed it whole!

396
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,857
I saw the look on his face.
I was delicious.

397
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,108
He must have passed the word,

398
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,153
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.

399
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,866
Isn't it weird to think your hand
was inside a dragon?

400
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,076
Like if your mind was still
in control of it,

401
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,955
you could've killed the dragon from inside
by crushing his heart, or something.

402
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,877
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

403
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,839
I'll chop off the legs of every
dragon I fight, with my face.

404
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:12,718
Uh-uh! It's the wings
and the tails you really want.

405
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,179
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

406
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,140
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

407
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,480
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.

408
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:28,067
Tomorrow, we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely

409
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,237
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.

410
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,114
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

411
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:37,534
It's gonna be me.
It's my destiny. See?

412
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,787
Your mom let you get a tattoo?

413
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,664
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.

414
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:45,584
I've been stuck with you since birth,
and that was never there before.

415
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,504
Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me from the left side.

416
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,630
Hey, Toothless.

417
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:35,342
I brought breakfast.
I hope... I hope you're hungry.

418
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,846
Okay, that's disgusting.

419
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:42,683
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod

420
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,852
and a whole smoked eel.

421
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,027
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's okay.

422
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:56,238
Yeah, I don't really like eel much, either.

423
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,076
That's it.

424
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,996
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.

425
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,875
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,

426
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:10,836
minding my own business.

427
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,600
It's okay.

428
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:30,606
Agh!

429
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:34,318
Okay.

430
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,278
Okay.

431
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:48,874
Huh!

432
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,459
Okay.

433
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,753
That's not too bad. It works.

434
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:56,757
Whoa! Whoa!

435
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:59,385
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

436
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,605
Oh, my! It's working!

437
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,114
Yes, yes! I did it!

438
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,502
Yeah!

439
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,421
<i>Today is about teamwork.</i>

440
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,760
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

441
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,722
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.

442
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,893
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.

443
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:53,564
Your job is to know which is which.

444
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:56,900
Razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion.

445
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,403
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

446
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,654
Will you please stop that?

447
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,829
If that dragon shows either of his faces,
I'm gonna...

448
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,164
There!

449
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,667
Hey, it's us, idiots!

450
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,795
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.

451
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:19,381
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure...

452
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:24,845
Wait.

453
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:30,267
Oh, I'm hurt!
I am very much hurt!

454
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,270
Chances of survival are dwindling
to single digits now.

455
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,778
Oh... Wrong head.

456
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:43,530
Fishlegs!

457
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,118
Now, Hiccup!

458
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,706
Oh, come on.

459
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,712
Hiccup!

460
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,258
Back, back, back!

461
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:07,930
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.

462
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,934
Back into your cage.
Now, think about what you've done.

463
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:27,407
Okay, so are we done?
'Cause I've got some things I need to...

464
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,660
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

465
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,214
Hey!

466
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,131
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

467
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:28,719
I left my ax back in the ring.
You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

468
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,969
Meet the Terrible Terror.

469
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,723
Ha! It's like the size of my...

470
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,516
Get it off!

471
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,646
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

472
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,525
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

473
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,253
Hmm!

474
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,030
Oh, great.

475
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,241
Hiccup.

476
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,591
Hiccup? Are you in there?

477
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,511
Astrid. Hey.

478
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,514
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

479
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,517
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.

480
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,601
Ow!

481
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,520
Well, weirder.

482
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:15,385
- Uh, I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.

483
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,012
Huh. Excellent.

484
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,389
I hope you had a little more
success than me.

485
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:24,102
Well, if by success, you mean that your
parenting troubles are over, then yes.

486
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:27,564
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

487
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,691
Out with the old and in
with the new, right?

488
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:30,984
No one will miss that old nuisance!

489
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,236
The village is throwing
a party to celebrate!

490
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,071
- Come over here.
- Hurry!

491
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,823
- He's gone?
- Uh...

492
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,283
Yeah...

493
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:42,579
Most afternoons, but who can blame him?
The life of a celebrity's very rough.

494
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:46,291
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

495
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,334
Hiccup?

496
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:51,296
Who would have thought it, eh?
He has this way with the beasts.

497
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,433
Okay, there, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

498
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:05,393
Here we go. Here we go. Position...

499
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,479
three. No, four.

500
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,459
All right, it's go time. It's go time.

501
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,009
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

502
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,602
Yes, it worked!

503
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:53,567
Sorry!

504
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,070
That was my fault.

505
00:44:58,488 --> 00:44:59,614
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

506
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:01,575
Position four. Uh, three.

507
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,955
Yeah! Go, baby!

508
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:08,957
Yes!

509
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,169
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... Cheat sheet!

510
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,546
Stop!

511
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,050
No!

512
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,265
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

513
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:28,894
All right, okay, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.

514
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:31,563
Okay, no, no, no.
Come back down towards me!
Come back down...

515
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:32,814
Ow!

516
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:15,482
Yeah!

517
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,276
Come on.

518
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,745
Uh... No, thanks. I'm good.

519
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:09,244
Not so fireproof on the inside, are you?

520
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,829
There you go.

521
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:30,890
Everything we know
about you guys is wrong.

522
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,946
Dad! You're back! Gobber's not here so...

523
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,240
I know.

524
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,952
- I came looking for you.
- You did?

525
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:52,954
You've been keeping secrets.

526
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,581
Uh, I have?

527
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:57,333
Just how long did you think
you could hide it from me?

528
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,378
I don't know what you're...

529
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:04,507
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

530
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:05,592
Oh?

531
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:06,968
So...

532
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:08,928
let's talk...

533
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,723
about that dragon.

534
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:16,019
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.

535
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,854
I just didn't know how to...

536
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,570
You're... You're not upset?

537
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,073
Uh... What? I was hoping for this!

538
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:31,910
- Uh... You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!

539
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,829
Just wait till you spill a Nadder's guts
for the first time!

540
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:37,624
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!

541
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:41,503
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!

542
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:45,924
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.

543
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:49,469
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.

544
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:51,888
And all the while you were
holding out on me!

545
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,807
Oh, Thor Almighty!

546
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,852
Oh! With you doing so well in the ring...

547
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,606
we finally have something to talk about.

548
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:18,706
Oh! Here, I brought you something

549
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,418
to keep you safe in the ring.

550
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:24,671
Wow. Thanks.

551
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:29,217
Your mother would have wanted you to have it.
It's half of her breastplate.

552
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:31,052
Huh...

553
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:34,848
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.

554
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:40,770
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.

555
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:50,822
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. Okay, good talk.

556
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,241
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.

557
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,784
Uh... Thanks for stopping by

558
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:58,830
- and for the... breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat. Ahem!

559
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,791
Well... Yep. Good night.

560
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,684
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.

561
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,936
Good. Please, by all means.

562
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,701
This time, this time, for sure!

563
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:48,296
No! No, son of a half-troll,

564
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:51,382
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.

565
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:53,635
- So, later.
- Not so fast.

566
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,762
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?

567
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:58,306
Late for what, exactly?

568
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,267
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

569
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:16,407
You've done it! You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!

570
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,454
That's my boy!

571
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:25,291
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

572
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,418
Leaving! We're leaving.

573
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:31,839
Let's pack up. Looks like you
and me are taking a little vacation.

574
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,841
Forever.

575
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,804
Oh, man.

576
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:43,184
Whoa! What the...
Um... What are you doing here?

577
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,645
I want to know what's going on.

578
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:50,650
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.

579
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,778
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?

580
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:54,988
Training?

581
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:56,781
It better not involve this.

582
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:00,285
I know this looks really bad,
but you see...

583
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:01,703
Whoa!

584
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,956
You're right. You're right. You're right.

585
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:10,169
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.

586
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:14,465
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.

587
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:16,676
Ow! Why would you do that?

588
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:21,180
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.

589
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:22,974
Oh, man.

590
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,143
Get down!

591
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,730
Run, run!

592
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:33,109
No! It's okay! It's okay.

593
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:34,819
She's a friend.

594
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,323
You just scared him.

595
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,657
I scared him?

596
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,618
Who is "him"?

597
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:47,790
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

598
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,756
Uh... We're dead.

599
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,259
Whoa! Where do you think you're going?

600
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,098
Whoa!

601
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:07,226
Oh, great Odin's ghost!
Ah! This is it!

602
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:14,567
Agh!

603
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,406
Hiccup, get me down from here!

604
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,700
You have to give me a chance to explain.

605
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:25,536
I am not listening to anything
you have to say!

606
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,915
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

607
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,168
Please, Astrid.

608
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,310
Now, get me down.

609
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:52,188
Toothless, down. Gently.

610
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,150
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

611
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,070
Whoa!

612
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,531
Toothless!

613
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,452
What is wrong with you?
Bad dragon!

614
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:09,330
He's not usually like this. Oh, no.

615
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,672
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

616
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:23,845
And now the spinning.

617
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,806
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

618
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,060
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

619
00:54:31,144 --> 00:54:32,645
Just get me off of this thing.

620
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,047
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

621
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,758
It's amazing.

622
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,760
He's amazing.

623
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,722
So, what now?

624
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:36,060
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.

625
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,603
You know you'll have to kill...

626
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:39,939
...kill a dragon.

627
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,232
Don't remind me.

628
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,443
Toothless, what's happening?

629
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:47,947
What is it?

630
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,784
Get down!

631
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,137
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

632
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,848
Toothless, you gotta
get us out of here, bud.

633
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,061
It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.

634
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,564
Ugh! What does that make us?

635
00:58:05,066 --> 00:58:07,443
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

636
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,672
It's satisfying to know that all of our food
has been dumped down a hole.

637
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:30,257
They're not eating any of it.

638
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:47,858
What is that?

639
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,993
All right, bud,
we got to get out of here... now!

640
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:11,132
Oh, it totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

641
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,300
They're the workers
and that's their queen.

642
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,970
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

643
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,054
No! No.

644
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:21,434
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

645
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,103
Astrid, we have to think
this through carefully.

646
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,898
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

647
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:30,776
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,

648
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,611
and you want to keep it a secret?

649
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:35,990
What? To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?

650
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:39,452
Yes.

651
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,628
Okay. Then what do we do?

652
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:53,632
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

653
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,176
Okay.

654
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,345
That's for kidnapping me.

655
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,563
That's for... everything else.

656
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,616
What are you looking at?

657
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:23,329
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

658
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:29,001
Well, I can show my face
in public again!

659
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:35,299
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks,

660
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:40,137
Hiccup would go from, well, being...
Hiccup

661
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:45,142
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast

662
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:47,728
and shipped him off
for fear he'd gone mad!

663
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:49,814
And you know it!

664
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:56,111
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised

665
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,114
or more proud than I am.

666
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,410
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

667
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:07,164
Today, he becomes one of us!

668
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:12,628
Be careful with that dragon.

669
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,340
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?

670
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,510
Put an end to this. I have to try.

671
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:23,722
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

672
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,350
just make sure they don't find Toothless.

673
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:30,563
I will.
Just promise me it won't go wrong.

674
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:34,066
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.

675
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:42,366
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

676
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:48,205
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

677
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:00,009
I would have gone for the hammer.

678
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,347
I'm ready.

679
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,957
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

680
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,713
What is he doing?

681
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,131
What is this?

682
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,885
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

683
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,227
I'm not one of them.

684
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,609
What is he thinking?

685
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:00,694
- Stop the fight.
- No!

686
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,863
I need you all to see this.

687
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,325
They're not what we think they are.

688
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,661
We don't have to kill them.

689
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:12,331
I said, stop the fight!

690
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,215
Out of my way!

691
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,549
Hiccup!

692
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,071
Hiccup!

693
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,037
This way!

694
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,042
Agh!

695
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:14,268
Night Fury!

696
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:34,663
Right, Toothless, go.
Get out of here.

697
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:37,958
Go, go!

698
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,209
Stoick, no!

699
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:40,753
Dad, he won't hurt you!

700
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,089
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!

701
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:47,051
Toothless, stop!

702
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,012
No! No!

703
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,184
Get him!

704
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:00,814
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!

705
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,901
Please don't hurt him.

706
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,325
Put it with the others.

707
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:16,955
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.

708
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,665
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

709
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:22,836
I know we did. That was before.
Oh! It's all so messed up.

710
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,423
So everything in the ring, a trick? A lie?

711
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:30,344
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...

712
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,515
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

713
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:37,726
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?

714
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,645
Not the people you almost killed?

715
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:42,231
He was just protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

716
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:44,399
They've killed hundreds of us!

717
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,318
And we've killed thousands of them!

718
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:51,782
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.

719
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,744
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.

720
01:05:55,828 --> 01:06:00,207
There's something else on their island, Dad.
It's a dragon like...

721
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,085
Their island? So you've been to the nest?

722
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,045
- Did I say "nest"?
- How did you find it?

723
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:07,756
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.

724
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,217
Only a dragon can find the island.

725
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:15,055
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.

726
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:18,350
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

727
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:22,020
Dad, please.
I promise you, you can't win this one!

728
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,481
Dad. No.

729
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,776
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me?

730
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:35,284
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.

731
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:38,745
You're not my son.

732
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,042
Ready the ships!

733
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:57,181
This way.

734
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:40,933
Set sail!

735
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,268
We head for Helheim's Gate.

736
01:07:52,194 --> 01:07:54,154
Lead us home, devil.

737
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,593
It's a mess.

738
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:21,598
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:

739
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:24,643
your father, your tribe, your best friend.

740
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,687
Thank you for summing that up.

741
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:31,775
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon
when I found him in the woods?

742
01:08:32,401 --> 01:08:36,196
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

743
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:38,907
So why didn't you?

744
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,621
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

745
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,666
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.

746
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,252
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

747
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,463
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

748
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:58,844
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

749
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,262
You said "wouldn't" that time.

750
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:02,389
Oh... Whatever! I wouldn't!

751
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:06,310
300 years, and I'm the first Viking
who wouldn't kill a dragon.

752
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:12,649
First to ride one, though.

753
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:16,611
So?

754
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:22,743
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

755
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,122
I looked at him, and I saw myself.

756
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:33,545
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?

757
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:40,135
- Uh... Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.

758
01:09:41,595 --> 01:09:43,221
Then something crazy.

759
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,183
That's more like it.

760
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,403
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.

761
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:01,114
- Here!
- One length to your stern.

762
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:06,411
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing
some of the men and, well, some of them

763
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:09,831
are wondering what it is we're up to here.
Not me, of course.

764
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:12,417
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,

765
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:16,588
not me, are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all

766
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:20,217
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.

767
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,552
Of course. Send them running.

768
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,721
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

769
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:25,931
Shh!

770
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,649
Step aside.

771
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:50,580
Bear to port.

772
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:59,256
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

773
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,928
You were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.

774
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:05,971
Uh... It's me.

775
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,598
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...

776
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:11,435
You're crazy. I like that.

777
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,646
So, what is the plan?

778
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:26,491
That's not very encouraging.

779
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:27,909
Oh!

780
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:30,412
Ha! I was wondering where that went.

781
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:45,760
Stay low and ready your weapons.

782
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,236
We're here.

783
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:28,553
Uh-uh.

784
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:38,438
- Wait! What are you...
- Shh. Relax.

785
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,941
It's okay. It's okay.

786
01:12:47,155 --> 01:12:50,158
Ha...

787
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:53,787
Where are you going?

788
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,581
You're gonna need something
to help you hold on.

789
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,886
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

790
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,764
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

791
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:16,017
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.

792
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:12,532
Is that it?

793
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:19,080
We've done it!

794
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:31,801
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!

795
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:47,317
- Get clear!
- Agh!

796
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,120
Beard of Thor! What is that?

797
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,210
Odin help us.

798
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:11,007
Catapults!

799
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:23,061
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!

800
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:37,909
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.

801
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,245
Lead the men
to the far side of the island!

802
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:41,579
Gobber, go with the men!

803
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:44,374
I think I'll stay, in case you're
thinking of doing something crazy.

804
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,669
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!

805
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:49,754
And I can double that time.

806
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,552
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!

807
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:09,023
Come on! Fight me!

808
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,483
No, me!

809
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:19,576
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!

810
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,327
Move, Fishlegs!

811
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:26,416
Look at us! We're on dragons.
We're on dragons! All of us!

812
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,919
Up! Let's move it!

813
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:34,883
Every bit the boar-headed,
stubborn Viking you ever were!

814
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:38,553
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- Okay.

815
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,431
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

816
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:45,727
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large nostrils!
Relies on hearing and smell!

817
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,522
Okay, Lout, legs! Hang in its blind spot,
make noise, keep it confused!

818
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:53,109
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit!
Make it mad!

819
01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:54,527
That's my specialty!

820
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:57,197
Since when?
Everyone knows I'm more irritating! See?

821
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,367
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!

822
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:04,412
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!

823
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,380
- Troll!
- Butt elf!

824
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:16,299
Bride of Grendel!

825
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:24,599
Um... This thing doesn't
have a blind spot!

826
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:28,269
There!

827
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,071
Go help the others!

828
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,949
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

829
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:47,622
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!

830
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:00,635
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

831
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:05,056
I'm okay!

832
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:07,141
Less okay!

833
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:09,811
Agh!

834
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:13,648
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Got something in your eye?

835
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,401
Agh!

836
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,487
Yeah! You're the Viking!

837
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,828
Whoa!

838
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,401
Dad?

839
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:18,588
You got it, bud.

840
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:22,133
Hiccup!

841
01:19:24,928 --> 01:19:27,847
I'm sorry... for everything.

842
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:29,766
Yeah. Me, too.

843
01:19:30,058 --> 01:19:31,809
You don't have to go up there.

844
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:35,563
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.

845
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,609
I'm proud to call you my son.

846
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:42,612
Thanks, Dad.

847
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:49,702
He's up!

848
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:54,374
Get Snotlout out of there.

849
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:55,792
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!

850
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,502
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.

851
01:19:57,585 --> 01:19:58,753
No, this way.

852
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,964
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!

853
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,636
I can't believe that worked!

854
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:15,937
Night Fury!

855
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,563
Get down!

856
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:28,783
Did you get her?

857
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:40,169
Go.

858
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:44,549
That thing has wings.
Okay, let's see if it can use them!

859
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:02,358
You think that did it?

860
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,198
Well, he can fly.

861
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,680
Okay, Toothless, time to disappear.

862
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:34,057
Come on, bud!

863
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:41,939
Here it comes!

864
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:35,576
Watch out!

865
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,289
Okay, time's up! Let's see if this works.

866
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,128
Come on! Is that the best you can do?

867
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:05,398
Stay with me, buddy. We're good.
Just a bit longer.

868
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,279
Hold, Toothless.

869
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:13,614
Now!

870
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:38,472
No.

871
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,558
No!

872
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,283
Hiccup!

873
01:23:58,659 --> 01:23:59,785
Hiccup!

874
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:02,663
Son!

875
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:06,709
Hiccup.

876
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:30,024
Oh, son.

877
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:33,277
I did this.

878
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:06,060
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

879
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:14,402
Hiccup!

880
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:24,078
Ha! He's alive.
You brought him back alive.

881
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,806
Thank you for saving my son.

882
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:47,560
Well, you know, most of him.

883
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,330
Hey, Toothless.

884
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:10,082
I'm happy to see you, too.

885
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,085
Oh! Ugh! Huh?

886
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:16,213
I'm in my house.

887
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:19,091
Uh... You're in my house.

888
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:21,302
Does my dad know you're here?

889
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,721
Uh... What? Okay, okay.

890
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:26,307
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

891
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,351
Toothless! Oh, come on.

892
01:27:03,594 --> 01:27:04,678
Agh!

893
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:09,517
Okay. Thanks, bud.

894
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,528
Oh!

895
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:24,156
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!

896
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,616
Hold on tight! Here we go!

897
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:29,870
What?

898
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:40,089
I knew it. I'm dead.

899
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:45,553
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?

900
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:48,722
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

901
01:27:48,806 --> 01:27:50,099
It's Hiccup!

902
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:55,896
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of... this.

903
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:57,815
You just gestured to all of me.

904
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:02,319
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.

905
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:05,698
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?

906
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,284
I might make a few tweaks.

907
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:12,079
- Ow!
- That's for scaring me.

908
01:28:12,163 --> 01:28:14,457
What, is it always going to be this way?
'Cause...

909
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:18,961
I could get used to it.

910
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:23,299
Welcome home.

911
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,510
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

912
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,523
You ready?

913
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:42,693
<i>This is Berk.</i>

914
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:47,323
<i>It snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three.</i>

915
01:28:49,033 --> 01:28:52,286
<i>Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.</i>

916
01:28:54,205 --> 01:28:57,041
<i>The people that grow here
are even more so.</i>

917
01:29:01,212 --> 01:29:03,672
<i>The only upsides are the pets.</i>

918
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:09,720
<i>While other places have
ponies or parrots...</i>

919
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:12,556
<i>we have...</i>

920
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,059
<i>dragons!</i>
