1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,460
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,350
The Peacock rules over the Gongmen city.

3
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,510
They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,520
For they have invented fireworks.

5
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,910
But their son, Lord Shen

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,860
Saw darker path in the fireworks.

7
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,410
What has brought color and joy

8
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,530
Can also bring darkness and destruction.

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,620
Shen trouble parent consult to a Soothsayer.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,160
She foretold that if Shen continue
down to this dark path,

11
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,490
He will be defeated by the warrior
of black and white.

12
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,070
The Young Lord set out to change his fate.

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,340
But what he did next, only sealed.

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,020
Shen returned to his parents for a prize.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,700
But in their faces, he saw only horror.

16
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,020
He was banned from the city forever.

17
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,430
But Shen swore revenge.

18
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,770
Some day, he will return and all
of China will bow at his feet.

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,880
Almost done, Lord Shen
But we ran out of metal.

20
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,750
Search the fartest villages,
find more metal.

21
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,500
China will be mine soon.

22
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,380
And then the Dragon warrior joined
the Furious Five.

23
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,410
And then we became the most
awesome Kung Fu team ever.

24
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,930
Enough talk.
Let's fight.

25
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,310
Listen! You can hear the Dragon warrior
is training right now.

26
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,010
33.... Stop.
It's too dangerous.

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,515
Stay focus.
36.....37....

28
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,230
How did he do it. This is freak?

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,480

Keep going, Hit 40
-He never hit 40.

32
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,250
You guys, don't worry.
I'll go to 40.

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,300
- Do it.
- No problem.

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,520
Wait a moment.

35
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:27,622
Yeah!
Yoooo...ho....!

36
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,165
He did it.
Well done Po.

37
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:31,941
Hus....ha...!

38
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:33,200
Your training is paid off.

39
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,748
Oh! Master Shifu.
Gotta go, See you later.

40
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:39,186

00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,200
Inner peace.

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,220
Inner peace.

44
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,830
Master Shifu.

45
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,680
Master Shifu. What do we got?
Pirates?

46
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,730
Vandals of the volcano mountain?

47
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,730
Whatever it is I will take them down.
Because I'm in mood

48
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,700
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
Ah! What are you doing?

50
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,340
One of Master Oogway final teaching.

51
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:08,240
Oh! Oh!...Awesome.

-Inner peace, that cool!

53
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,490
Inner peace of what?
It is the next phase of your training.

54
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,250
Every master must
find his path to inner peace.

55
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,650
Some choose to the meditate for
50 years in a cave just like this

56
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,860
Without a try to taste the food or water.

57
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,129
Or?
some find true a pain and suffering as I did.

58
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,550
At thoes day you was chosen
to be Dragon Warrior

59
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,910
...was the worst day of my life.

60
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,150
By far...
Nothing else came close.

61
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,650
It was the worst most painful,
mind destroyed horrible moment.

62
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:56,170
Okeay!
I have ever experienced.

63
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,510
But once I realized the problem was
not you, but within me

64
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,720
I found inner peace, I was able to
honest full of the universe.

65
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,740
So that's it,
I just need inner peace.

66
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,260
My inner is already super super peaceful

67
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,800
So I only need to do,
is just get this thing going.

68

Approaching the musician in the village.

72
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,119
Dangerous. Tell thoes musician to start
play some action music.

73
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,473
Because it is on.

74
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:34,420
Don't worry Shifu, I will master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

75
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,949
No snack up this time.

76
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,346
Hus...Ha....Snack up.

77
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800

78
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:46,267

00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,280

Panda?
That's impossible.

86
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,830
My fist tangled for justice.

87
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
This was my fist.

88
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,040

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,330

Oh! No. That's ok dad.

134
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,200
Not hungry?
Po, you alright?

135
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,310
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm fine, I Just…

136
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,800
Today, I was fighting bandit.
Nothing too dangerous

137
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,735
I mean they was just… you know...
Yeah!

138
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,970
And then, a strangest thing happened,
I have a crazy vision.

139
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,060
I think I saw my mom.
And me as a baby.

140
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,630
Mom? a Baby?

141
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,330
Hmm...Dad?

142
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,310
What he talking about?

143
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,570
How can I say this?

144
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,970
Where did I come from?

145
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,450
Well you see, my son.

146
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,690
A baby come from a little egg.

147
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,050
Don’t ask me where the eggs come from.

148
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,620
Dad, it is not what I mean.

149
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,800
I know it's not.

150
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,020
I think it is time to told you something
that I should told you a long time ago.

151
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:48,298
Ok!

152
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,080
You might have been kind of....

153
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,080
....Adopted.

154
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,600
I knew it.
You knew? Who told you?

155
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
No one.
I mean…. come on dad.

156
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,437
But if you do,
Why didn't you ever say anything?

157
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:07,150
Why didn't you say anything?

158
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,080
How did I get here dad?
Where did I come from?

159
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,820
Actually...

160
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,620
You came from this.

161
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,520
It was just another day at the restaurant,
Time to make the noodle

162
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,760
I went out to the back. Where the
vegetables has just been delivered

163
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,920
Chinese cabbage, radish, turnip ...

164
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,270
There were no vegetables

165
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,230
Just a very hungry baby panda.

166
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,470
There was no one.

167
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,790
Of course you could eat meet.

168
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
I've been waiting for someone to come
looking for you

169
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
But no one did.

170
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,110
I brought you inside

171
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,890
Fed you

172
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,970
Gave you a bath

173
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,190
And fed you again,

174
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,960
And again,

175
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,010
I were trying to put some pants on you.

176
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,520
And then I made a decision would
change my life forever.

177
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,250
To make my super delicious soup.

178
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,530
And to raise you as my own son.

179
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,210
Po,  My little panda.

180
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,690
And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life

181
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,670
Have been that much sweeter.

182
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,560
My little Po, Is this the end of the story.

183
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,900
Look at me.
No, don't look at me.

184
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,390
That's it

185
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,580
That can't be it.
That have to be more dad.

186
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,780
Well, There were the time you ate
all my bamboo furniture.

187
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,110
It was important too.

188
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,730
One dumpling please,
Dragon Warrior size.

189
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,650
Oh Po, your story may not have such
a happy beginning, but look how it turn out

190
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,190
You got me, you got Kung Fu,
and you got noodles.

191
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,920
I know, I just have so many questions.

192
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,420
Like how I ever fit in this tiny basket.
Why didn't I like pants?

193
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,620
And who am I?

194
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,430
Good, watch your position.

195
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,070
Good

196
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,910
Shen?

197
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,200
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

198
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,520
Now we got my parent out of their way,
Please leave my house.

199
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
Your house?

200
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,750
Yes,
didn’t you see the peacock in the front door?

201
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,510
They were so sad,

202
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,450
It seems your fortune are
not as good as you thought.

203
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,560
We shall see, Shen

204
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,400
You shall see goat, well well

205
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,470
What do you want Shen?
What is right!

206
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
Gongmen city.

207
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,870
Gongmen is under reasonability of
the master council. And we will protect it.

208
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Even from you.

209
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,330
I'm so glad you feel that way.

210
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,640
Otherwise that case is open up.

211
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,020
What's in the box, Shen?

212
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,300
Want to see it?.
It's a gift.

213
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,350
It is your parting gift.

214
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,670
I mean it will part you.

215
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,350
Part of you here, part of you there,
and part of you way way there on the wall.

216
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,010
You insane fool.

217
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,990
Show off, That is a warning.

218
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,989
You are no match for us in Kung Fu.

219
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:25,950
I agree, but this is.

220
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,070
Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen city?
Master thunder Rhino as I know.

221
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,661
Son of the legendary Flying Rhino?
Yes.

222
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,010
And the slayer of ten thousands surface
in the valey of gold.

223
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,490
He's dead.
That, that is impossible.

224
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,350
Rhino horn defend is imperial to any technique.

225
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,740
There were no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon.

226
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,350
One the breed firer and spread metal.

227
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,740
Unless he is stopped, This could be
the end of Kung Fu.

228
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,430
But I just got Kung Fu,
And now you must save it.

229
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,430
Go destroy the weapon, and bring
Lord Shen to justice.

230
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,806
Ok here we go.
here we go.

231
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:22,010
Whooo! Whooo! Wait, Wait a second,
how can I do this

232
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,280
I mean how can Kung Fu stop
something that stop Kung Fu.

233
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,520
Remember Dragon Warrior,
Anything is possible when you have inner peace.

234
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,983
Inner Peace.
Inner Peace.

235
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,228
Inner Peace.

236
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,070
Peace on

237
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
Po!
I get your things back.

238
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:52,090
I brought your food for week, cookie, bun
vegetables, and even all your action finger.

239
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:53,881
See!

240
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,330
Oh! I don’t know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

241
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Dad, you make a scratch on my doll tiger

242
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,790
I also pack your painting, the best
time together, just in case you get lonely.

243
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,170
That me and you making noodles,
and that me and you eating noodle.

244
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,590
And that me giving you a piggy back ride.

245
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,350
That's cute, and the second thought
I hang out this one.

246
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,790
Hey! Dad.
They are waiting for me.

247
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,440
Of course, you have a job to do.
Far from home.

248
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,460
A strange city, filled with strange
people and strange noodles.

249
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,220
Facing horrible danger from
would you might never return.

250
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,549
Don’t go Po.

251
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:38,400
I got to go, I'm the Dragon Warrior,
It kind of my job to save Kung Fu.

252
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,986
And if I don’t.

253
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,234
What am I?
You are my son.

254
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,360
Right?

255
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,320
Po, it's time to go.

256
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,760
Goodbye.

257
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,640
Don’t worry, Mr Ping, He will be back
before you can sell noodles.

258
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,810
Noodles.

259
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,706
Come on guys, let's go.

260
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:16,774
Yeah!

261
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:21,129
Yeah! Yeah!

262
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,800
Mamma!

263
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,610
Mom? Dad? is that you?
Mom? Dad?

264
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,629
Oh! Ah!
Hey! Son, you are back.

265
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,490
Honey, what are you doing here?

266
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,960
But I thought.
We replaced you dear with a lovely radish.

267
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
Radish?

268
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,000
He is quite, polite, and frankly
does better Kung Fu.

269
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,249
No. No.

270
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,060
Wait!

271
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,720
Radish!

272
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,220
Inner peace.

273
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,370
Inner peace.

274
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,626
Inner peace.

275
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:18,254
Inner Peace! Inner Peace!
Inner Peace! Inner Peace!

276
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,140
Oh! I'm training.

277
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,110
The mask is not a worrior opponent.

278
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,250
I'm ready.

279
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,950
Okay!
So. Seriously all you...

280
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,723
Hus...Ha!

281
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,270
I think I preferred the mask.

282
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,000
Apology I used to punch the iron wood tree
by the palace in training

283
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,860
Now I feel nothing

284
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,840
That is really cool

285
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,034
Again.
Hus..!

286
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
So this punching iron wood tree,
how long have you do that.

287
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,160
20 years.
Oh 20, 20 years.

288
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,430
Is there any faster way? You know
until to don't feel anything.

289
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,680
No. Side.

290
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,660
I don't think hard style is your thing.

291
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,820
Po. Why do you really out here

292
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,090
I just found out my dad,
he isn't really my dad

293
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,420
Your dad? Goose.

294
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,820
Must have been quite a shock.

295
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:44,066
Yeah!

296
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,110
And he is bother you?

297
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,331
Are you kidding me?
We are warrior right?

298
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:54,066
Nerves of steel. Soul of Platinum.
Like you.

299
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,090
So hard core you don't feel anything.

300
00:25:57,904 --> 00:25:59,232
Hus!..ha! Yeah!
Whoo!

301
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,160
I was...
So what are you talking about?

302
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,600
Nothing! Nothing!

303
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,033
Po, is having daddy issue.

304
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:10,951
I'm so lucky,
I don't have any problem with my dad

305
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,490
Because my mommy eat his head
before I was born.

306
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:14,681
No. No. No

307
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:18,980
Mantis, it isn't about you,
Po, is the one freaking out.

308
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,850
I'm not freaking out

309
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:23,100
Po!
I'm freaking in

310
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,682
Po!
What?

311
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,610
We are here, Gongmen city.

312
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,560
My father Throne.

313
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,780
He used to let me play here.
a side him.

314
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,910
promised so some day...
this thron will be mine.

315
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
A little to the left.

316
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,020
But this is so heavy, Master.

317
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,160
Thirty years,
I was waiting for this moment.

318
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,800
Everything must be exactly
how I have visualized

319
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,790
and my visualized is,
a little to the left.

320
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,220
Perfect.

321
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,640
With the weapon,
by my...set a little bit more.

322
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,370
With the weapon, by my side,
all China will be bowed before me

323
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,210
We move out in 3 days, when the moon
is full and the tide is high.

324
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,297
You old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

325
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,641
Fortune?

326
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,150
The future,
I was going to say the future.

327
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,620
Looking to your bowl,
And tell me what glorious await

328
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,070
If you continue on your current path...

329
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,380
You will find yourself...

330
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,320
At the bottom of the stair.

331
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,490
I see....

332
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,110
I see....

333
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,070
I see...pain.

334
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,330
And anger.

335
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,030
How dare you,
That is the finest suit in the kingdom.

336
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,178
Followed by deny,
This is not fortune telling.

337
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,217
You just say what is happening right,

338
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:21,010
No.

339
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,760
The most important time is now.

340
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,860
But if you really want to see the future ...

341
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,650
What do you see?

342
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,150
A peacock.

343
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Be defeated by a warrior of black and white.

344
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,970
Nothing has changed.

345
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,180
That is impossible.
And you know it.

346
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,580
It is not impossible.
And he knows it.

347
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,840
Who?

348
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,480
Lord Shen. I saw a pandas.
- A Panda?

349
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,690
A Kung Fu warrior,
he fought like a demon.

350
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,600
Big and fury, soft and squeachy.

351
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,720
Kind of cluching.

352
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,330
There are no more panda.

353
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,740
Even with the poor eye sight,
he can see the truth.

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,040
Po, do something.

381
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,870

At the Black Dragon area.

00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,570

Listen to yourself,
You protect Gongmen city by not protect Gongmen city?

429
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:06,933
If we all fight together.

430
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,980
Then the weapon would kill everyone.

431
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,950
Oh yeah, So we use a sneak attack.

432
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,750

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,530
By an unstoppable weapon.

434
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,390
No thing is unstoppable except for me

435
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:26,518
When I'm stoping you
from telling me some thing unstoppable.

436

467
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,180
We lost them.

468
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,130

469
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,440

476
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,430
Why are so many signs hanging?

477
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,300

Let me tell you something,

481
00:39:40,306 --> 00:39:43,081
Next time you measure a plan
you better bring a whole lot

482
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,860
There is no body told you.
You mess with a wolf, you get a pack

00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,060
I hit you twice, what are you gonna do now?

484
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,970
We surrender.

485
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,790
You can chain my body but you will
never chain my warrior spirit.

486
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,370
Dont forget the little guy.
Hey you just calm.

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,100
No way, eight point akupressure cuff.

490
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,500
Just the one that held Tailong, the
more you move the tier they get.

491
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,460
These are the best cuffs.

492
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,760
Greeting Panda, At last we meet.

493
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,060

I hope this turn out better
than your new plan

500
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:25,146
than to cook rice and your stomach
by eating raw and drinking boiling watter.

501
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:27,030
This plan is no thing like that plan.

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,600
How?
This is the one gonna work.

503

00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,570
You don't know?
Know what?

531
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,760
What so funny?
Funny thing that you clearly do not know.

532
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,690
Ok, enough for this,
Would you guys spin the bin.

533
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,600
First you know, we come in,
and the weapon is tiny, Supprise it's big.

534
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,098
And the lady over here,
I think she's a guy.

535
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:22,453
He's got...

536
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,740
The only reason you're still alive ...

537
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,330
That I find you stupid.

538
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,870
Oh! Thank you,
But I find you evil and extremely annoyed.

539
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,730
Who do you think you are, Panda?
Who do you think I am, peacock?

540
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:42,961
Hus!...Ha!
Hus!...Ha!

541
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,910
Why are we laughing?

542
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:51,870
Take him

543
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,780
Fire.

544
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,720
Well light that thing.

545
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,030
Well I did.

546
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,390
Get the weapon

547
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:25,108
Hus!...Ha!

548
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,650
Get the weapon.

549
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,900
Tiger.

550
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,330
Lord Shen.

551
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:53,833
Yeah!

552
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,800
You...you were there.

553
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,060
Yes. Yes I was

554
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,100
You just let Shen get away

555
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,770
But we destroyed the weapon

556
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,770
Fire.

557
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,640
No he got more.

558
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,134
My wings ...
Help! Help!

559
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:42,760
Coming.

560
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,840
Watch out!

561
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,070
Help me out.

562
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,940
No! Get him down.
Use the rope.

563
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,850
Run run little panda.

564
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,280
Po, come on, we need you to focus.
I got it. I got it.

565
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,010
Bring him down

566
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,810
We're trapped.
This way ...

567
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,500
Hus!...Ha!
Goodbye.

568
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,080
Fire

569
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,990
Get back

570
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,390
The only way out is up

571
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,480
Follow me. Come on.

572
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,530
Where did they go?

573
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,750
To the top, come on

574
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,180
Here we go.

575
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,630
You idiot

576
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,300
My Nose ...

577
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,450
Call the wolves, all of them,
I want them ready to move

578
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,370
The year of the peacock, begin now

579
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,124
Right now?
Because it is middle of year.

580
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:55,320
So you only get a half of the year of peacock.

581
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:01,140
And this is year,
of course the year of peacock,

582
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:02,350
Happy New Year, Sir.

583
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,080
Get the wolves ready,
We load in ship now.

584
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,850
Now ...!!!!

585
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,820
Now, now, now.

586
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,740
Move move move.

587
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,310
This way.

588
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:40,310
Come on.

589
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,011
You...
What did you do?

590
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:52,210
It is chaos out there,
What happend to stoping Shen?

591
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,879
Yeah!

592
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,070
Guys, come on,
Give me a litle of credit.

593
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:03,524
I made form to get away.
Cause it's a trick of a plan.

594
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:08,120
I was thinking,
figure out his plan more.

595
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,744
That make no sense.
Yeah!

596
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,790
Po, The truth,
you have Shen. What happend?

597
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,620
What you talking about?
I don't know what you are talking about.

598
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,441
Yeah!
Ok he got me of course

599
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,400
The truth

600
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,820
Fine

601
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:32,110
They will keep you far from danger.
Real far

602
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:35,050
What?
You stay here.

603
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,300
Wait.

604
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,880
I have to go back.

605
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,670
You are staying here

606
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,490
I'm going and you can't stop me

607
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:50,914
Wooh!

608
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,470
Ok I wasn't ready that time.

609
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:55,680
Guys don't...

610
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,858
Ready
Look!

611
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,620
Stay down.

612
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,160
I have to get to him.
Then tell me why?

613
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:24,970
He was there ok. The peacock was
there the last time I saw my parent

614
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:30,310
He know what happened,
Where I came from? Who I am?

615
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,940
Look I'm going.

616
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,680
I have to know.

617
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,420
The hard core can't understand.

618
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,430
Tiger, no.

619
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,900
The hard core do understand.

620
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,870
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

621
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,350
We are going

622
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,190
Hey maybe you can watch me be killed.

623
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:04,150
Stopping a words.
And she is back

624
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,500
Don't worry kid.
You better are here.

625
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,380
You were wrong, Ziener,
We sail to victory tonight.

626
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,380
Your magic panda, clearly a fool.

627
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,157
Are you certain it is panda
who is the fool?

628
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,109
You just destroyed your ancestor your home,
Shen.

629
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:37,490
A trivial sarcify,
when all of China is my reward.

630
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,901
Then you will finaly be satisfied.

631
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:45,273
The destruction of the whole world,
finaly make you feel better.

632
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:49,700
This is not. Maybe I built
into the dungeon.

633
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,570
The cup you choose to fill have no bottom.

634
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,513
It is time to stop this madness.

635
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:04,125
Why on earth would I do that?
-So your parent can rest in peace.

636
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,040
My parents hate me.

637
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,080
Do you understand?

638
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:16,430
They feel wrong to me,
But I will make it right.

639
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,040
They love you, they love you so much
that having to send you away.

640
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,180
but that exit in the past.

641
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,680
And I must extend to the future.

642
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,950
Set SoothSayer free,
She is not use to me.

643
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,950
Good bye Shen, I wish you happiness.

644
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,717
Happiness?
must be taken.

645
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,830
and I will take mine.

646
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,160
Hurry up...

647
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:20,894
If all of those weapon leave the building,
China will fall

648
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:22,051
We bring down the building.

649
00:54:22,482 --> 00:54:24,451
Hey guys, how a bout this.?

650
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,383
Oh this will work,
-Alright, let's go.

651
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:31,909
I can't feel my face.

652
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,730
Damn you peacock.

653
00:54:51,858 --> 00:54:53,100
Hey!
Keep it cool.

654
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,952
You ...
Where are you going?

655
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,170
On your feet,
and get off stupid on your faces.

656
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:19,841
Move you dogs, faster faster.
Load the boat.

657
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,220
Greeting Panda.

658
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,847
Tell me what happened that night?

659
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:39,287
What night?
That night.

660
00:55:39,649 --> 00:55:41,681
Oh, that night.

661
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,080
Yes!
Yes, I was there.

662
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:48,077
I watch that your parent abandon you,
as a terrible thing

663
00:55:48,403 --> 00:55:52,790
I believe it went something like this.

664
00:56:01,864 --> 00:56:03,289
Happy New Year, kid.

665
00:56:03,324 --> 00:56:06,141
Hope you like it,
because you can't return it, hus...ha!

666
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:12,280
Po, What is he doing here?
Return it, return it.

667
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:26,246
Now you willing to die for
finding the truth.

668
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:27,696
You better tell me who I am.

669
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,046
Before...I prefer not to...

670
00:56:30,499 --> 00:56:31,857
Yeah!

671
00:56:53,173 --> 00:56:54,220
We got the Po.

672
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,740
Looking for me?

673
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:26,270
I said that to soon, didn't I?

674
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:35,935
Po!

675
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,690
Po, get away from him.

676
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,060
I'll get him.

677
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,120
No more running Shen.
So I see.

678
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,800
Now answer.
Oh you want to know so badly

679
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,680
You think no one willing to heal you huh?

680
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,650
Fill some crater in your soul.

681
00:58:03,703 --> 00:58:04,863
Here are your answers:

682
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,540
Your parent didn't love you.

683
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,580
But here.

684
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,220
Let me heal you.

685
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:21,705
Ha..!
No...!

686
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,653
Yeah, I like you can make me
drink that....ha..

687
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,660
If I wanted you dead, I would have
left you in that river.

688
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:51,910
Why save me,
so you can fulfill your destiny.

689
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,065
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

690
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,700
What is this place?

691
00:59:58,735 --> 01:00:01,330
I'm supprised you remember so little.

692
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,770
But you was so little

693
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:08,190
When it happened.

694
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,660
Perhape you do remember.

695
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,340
You know what,
it just a stupid nightmare

696
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,720
Nightmares or memories?

697
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,131
This was the windy village.

698
01:00:52,893 --> 01:00:56,015
YOUNG SHEN,
was in line to rule Gongmen city.

699
01:00:56,604 --> 01:00:58,028
But he wanted more.

700
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,831
I foretold that someone will standing his way,
a panda.

701
01:01:04,646 --> 01:01:09,053
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

702
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,110
Kill them all!

703
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,870
Take our son,
and run away, Go

704
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,000
Stop fighting. Let it flows.

705
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,520
Your story may not have a such happy beginning

706
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,427
But that doesn't make you who you are

707
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,900
It is the rest of your story.

708
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:07,070
Who you choose to be.

709
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,565
So, who you are, panda?

710
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:52,190
I am Po!

711
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,840
And I'm gonna need a hat.

712
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,800
Such sad sad faces.

713
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,800
But now is the time only for joy.

714
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:14,990
You are going to be part of something beautiful.

715
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,080
Once you reach the habor,
it is in front of the world

716
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,710
You and your favorite Kung Fu will die.

717
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,440
then, China will know to bow before me.

718
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,390
Set sail.

719
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,450
You guys,
I never thought I would die like this.

720
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,640
I thought I will meet a nice girl.
Sit down, and she eat my head. So sad.

721
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:20,402
We can not give up hope,
Po, would warn us to remain strong.

722
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:22,780
Hard core, right?
Tiger?

723
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,030
Lord Shen,
what about the bridge?

724
01:06:33,065 --> 01:06:35,159
Nothing stand in my way.

725
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:36,890
Fire.

726
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,090
You coward

727
01:06:58,538 --> 01:06:59,880
Po!

728
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,440
How many time do I have to kill that
fat stinky panda?

729
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,400
Shen!

730
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:24,423
A panda stand between you
and your destiny.

731
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:26,648
What?

732
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,290
Prepare yourself,
for a hot...

733
01:07:33,161 --> 01:07:33,816
What?

734
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:38,194
And now, free the Five.
leave of this destruction.

735
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:52,050
Okay!
Take him.

736
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,620
Ready.

737
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,208
This way, that way
Yeah!

738
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,240
You can't folow me.

739
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,090
Just get him.

740
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,546

743
01:08:46,381 --> 01:08:48,470
Don't shoot.

744
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,170
You don't shoot, don't shoot.

745
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,520
Dont shoo't, stop fire

746
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,040
Attack.

747
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,940
Capture of freedom.

748
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,520
Monkey.

749
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:13,570
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What your plan?

750
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,130
Step 1 free the Five.
What is step 2?

751
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,550
Honestly I didn't think I could make this far.

752
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,360
How?
Stop Shen before he get to the habor.

753
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,990
Oh! Nice.

754
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,900
Tiger, Puppet of deadth.
Tiger

755
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:43,710

And Croc, Vengeance is served

757
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:50,300
Your friend there, is very persuasive.

758
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,780
Master Shifu.

759
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:04,078
Quickly,
use their boat to block the way.

760
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,410
Crane.

761
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,370
Wings of justice.

762
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:29,861
What?

763
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,120
I love you guys.

764
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,947
Why aren't we firing.

765
01:10:54,212 --> 01:10:56,924
They have taken all our guns sir,
They are getting close.

766
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,470
Fire, fire at them.

767
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:07,809
But sir, that will kill our own.
I said fire at them, fire.

768
01:11:10,678 --> 01:11:11,512
No!

769
01:11:19,429 --> 01:11:20,684
Po!

Make your wish.

773
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,400
Let finish this.

774
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,060
Fire.

775
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,540
Inner peace.

776
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,020
Again.

777
01:13:58,146 --> 01:13:59,122
Yeah!

778
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:03,510
Kill him,

779
01:14:08,293 --> 01:14:09,454
Hus..ha!

780
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:14,457
Yeah!

781
01:14:20,343 --> 01:14:21,158
Yeah!

782
01:14:24,652 --> 01:14:25,515
Yeah!

783
01:14:25,951 --> 01:14:26,941
Fire!
No!

784
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:37,710
Keep firing, keep firing.

785
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,240
Skadoosh it.

786
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,510
How did you?

787
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,660
How did you do it?

788
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,830
You know, just keep your elbows up,
and keep your shoulder loose.

789
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,060
Not that. How did you find peace?

790
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:50,420
I took away your parent, everything.
I scared you for life.

791
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,520
See that the thing Shen. Scars heals.

792
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:58,660
No they don't. Wound heals.

793
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,898
Oh yeah, What do scars do?
They phase I guest?

794
01:16:01,314 --> 01:16:03,137
I don't care what scars do.

795
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:07,410
You should Shen, You gotta let go
that stuff of the pass,

796
01:16:07,987 --> 01:16:09,451
because it just doesn't matter.

797
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:14,380
The only thing that matter,
is what you choose to be now.

798
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:18,670
You're right.
And then I chose this.

799
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,940
That was pretty hard core.

800
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:26,980
Wow. Don't ever do that again please.

801
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,040
It seem you have found inner peace

802
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,420
At such a young age.

803
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:36,170
Oh I have a pretty good teacher.

804
01:17:43,814 --> 01:17:45,840
Yeah!..woo!

805
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,110
What do you mean he is not here.

806
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:02,740
It my son birthday, all he want is
just meet the Dragon Warrior.

807
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,240
How about some birthday
tofu cake instead huh?

808
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,796
You know,
maybe I think we should try another time.

809
01:18:08,908 --> 01:18:10,043
When do you think he will be back?

810
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,840
I don't know, Ok I don't know.
Maybe never.

811
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,676

01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,820
Why do he have to go save China.
I know why.

814
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:30,650
But why?
He's just one litle panda.

815
01:18:40,502 --> 01:18:41,998
Yeah!

816
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,780
So, how did it go?
