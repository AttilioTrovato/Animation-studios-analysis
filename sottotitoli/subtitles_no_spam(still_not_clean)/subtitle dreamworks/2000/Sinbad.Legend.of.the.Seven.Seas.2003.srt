1
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:13,408
Wake up, my beauties.

2
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,618
Rise and shine.

3
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:18,705
It's a brand-new day,
and the mortal world

4
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,166
is at peace.

5
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,209
But not for long.

6
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,255
Just look at them.

7
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,299
I pull one tiny thread,

8
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:33,386
and their whole world
unravels into chaos.

9
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,723
Glorious chaos.

10
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,520
And what could be
more perfect than this?

11
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,814
A noble prince,

12
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:46,900
a priceless treasure,

13
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:50,153
and a black-hearted thief.

14
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:53,531
This is going to be fun.

15
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,326
Cetus?

16
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,495
You know what to do.

17
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,455
Let the games begin.

18
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,138
Gentlemen, this is
what we've been waiting for.

19
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,808
The world's most
valuable object

20
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,018
is on its way to Syracuse.

21
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,604
It's a shame
it'll never get there.

22
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,067
After today,
we retire to Fiji.

23
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:31,694
- Fiji!
- Fiji!

24
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,073
Kale!
Aye, Captain.

25
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,659
Spike!

26
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,955
Let's get rich!

27
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,908
Did you catch
that last move?

28
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,326
Pretty cool?

29
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,786
I thought you
overworked it.

30
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,162
Just a bit.

31
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,581
You...

32
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,748
Overworked it?

33
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,923
And I was
overworking it?

34
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,553
Proteus.

35
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,639
This just got interesting.

36
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,224
How long has it been?

37
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,934
About a lifetime ago.

38
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,234
You still fight
like an old lady.

39
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,402
Sinbad?

40
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:56,946
Sinbad.

41
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,115
What...
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,658
I'm working.

43
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,203
You?
What happened to you?

44
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:05,413
Where have you been?

45
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:07,498
Hey, love to stop
and catch up,

46
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:11,169
but I've got things to do,
places to go, stuff to steal.

47
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,556
Oh, yeah.

48
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,893
Sinbad,
we need to talk.

49
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,145
Heard about it,
read about it,

50
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,772
never actually seen it.

51
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,863
The Book of Peace.

52
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:42,033
It's my job to bring it
safely to Syracuse.

53
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,827
Really? Now, see, now,
I just feel bad,

54
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,496
because you're going
to get fired.

55
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,039
You can't be serious.

56
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,667
You disappear for ten years,
show up, and rob me?

57
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,585
I wish it wasn't you.
I do.

58
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,754
Really. But...

59
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,839
But it is me, Sinbad.

60
00:04:56,923 --> 00:05:00,677
Proteus, we had a special
handshake, some code words,

61
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,011
a secret hideout.

62
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:05,306
It was fun, big fun,
but we were kids.

63
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,891
We were friends!

64
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:10,061
You're not going to
steal this. Not from me.

65
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,522
And what would you
do with it anyway?

66
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,066
The Book of Peace
protects all of us
in the Twelve Cities.

67
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,359
Exactly.

68
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:19,153
So just imagine how much
all of us will pay
to get it back.

69
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:23,074
Let me say it again.
A long time ago,
you and I were friends.

70
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,619
If that ever meant anything
to you, prove it now.

71
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,455
You're right.

72
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:30,915
That was a long time ago.

73
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:40,008
Come on.
Don't get all heroic, Proteus.

74
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,269
If you want the Book,
you have to go through me.

75
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,651
What the...

76
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,323
Dear gods.

77
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,926
Go, Spike.

78
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,100
I got you! I got you!

79
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,019
Well, I see you're busy.

80
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,605
So, stay in touch.

81
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:38,274
Wait! Wait!
You're just going to
run away?

82
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,151
Yeah.

83
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,120
Sinbad!

84
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,414
You! My...

85
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:54,707
My ship!

86
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,597
Heads up!

87
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,318
Now...
Stand by for sushi.

88
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,501
Give that guy a raise.

89
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,798
Come on! Come on,
Sinbad! Let's go!

90
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,174
Wait.
Stand your ground.

91
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,425
What are you doing?

92
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,678
Hey! Hey, hey!

93
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,888
Lobster Boy, over here!

94
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:58,146
Run!

95
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,730
Fall back!

96
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,235
Grab hold!

97
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,281
Let's go!

98
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:12,702
Come on!

99
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:16,998
And the plan?

100
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,083
How about
try not to get killed?

101
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,335
Hold on!

102
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:26,174
Here, you'll need this.
Where are you going?

103
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,717
Fishing!

104
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,890
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

105
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:55,578
Now!

106
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,135
You okay?

107
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:14,096
Yeah. Thanks for
sticking around.

108
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,099
Just like old times.

109
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:18,768
Look out!

110
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,603
Sinbad!

111
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,598
The day began
with such promise.

112
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,225
And now look.

113
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,227
My sea monster is dead,

114
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,855
and I still don't have
the Book of Peace.

115
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,400
All because of you, Sinbad.

116
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,153
And you are?

117
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,156
Eris, the Goddess of Discord.

118
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,033
No doubt you've seen
my likeness

119
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,286
on the temple walls.

120
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,706
You know, they don't
do you justice.

121
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,708
Now...

122
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,960
About my sea monster.

123
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,796
Right, right. Listen,
I'm sorry about that.

124
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,465
I don't suppose a heartfelt
apology would do.

125
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,344
Heartfelt? From you?

126
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:38,681
Sinbad,
you don't have a heart.

127
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,477
That's what I like
about you.

128
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,731
So, I'm going
to let you live.

129
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,442
But there's
just one little thing

130
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,235
you have to do.

131
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:54,447
Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.

132
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,450
Right. Now, see,
that's a problem for me

133
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,244
because I had my own plans
for it. Ransom, get rich.

134
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:01,662
You know, "me" stuff.

135
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:05,249
You're not thinking
big enough, Sinbad.

136
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,169
Steal the Book for ransom,
and you'll be rich enough

137
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,254
to lounge
on an island beach.

138
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:14,884
Steal the Book for me,
and you can buy the beach,

139
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,304
and the island
and the world.

140
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:22,350
You let me live,
you make me rich,

141
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,060
I retire to paradise.

142
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,062
So far,
I don't see a downside.

143
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,397
If you keep your word.

144
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,358
Sinbad, when a goddess
gives her word,

145
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,235
she's bound for all eternity.

146
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,988
All right, you're on.

147
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,865
I knew you'd
see it my way.

148
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,744
So, when you've
stolen the Book,

149
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,914
follow that star
beyond the horizon.

150
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,540
You'll find yourself

151
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:50,378
in Tartarus,
my Realm of Chaos.

152
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,171
Tartarus.

153
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,255
I'll see you there.

154
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,049
It's a date then.

155
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,011
So, where were we?

156
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,429
Oh, yes.

157
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,307
You were holding
your breath.

158
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,359
He's so cute.

159
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,778
And so gullible.

160
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,989
Cetus, well done.

161
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,418
Sinbad, you're alive!

162
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,503
Glad you made it.

163
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,921
Pay up. He lived.

164
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,424
What happened down there?

165
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,051
You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

166
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:40,136
Try me.

167
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,596
All right, here goes.

168
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,765
So I meet Eris,
the Goddess of Chaos.

169
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,475
She's got
a major crush on me,

170
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,227
and she invited me
back to her place.

171
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,605
That's a good one!

172
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,399
Goddess of Chaos?

173
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,443
I'm writing that down.

174
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,195
So, that's it then?
No Book.
Now what do we do?

175
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,697
A little patience, Rat.

176
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,615
It's not like we don't know
where it's going.

177
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,871
Men, all sails to Syracuse!

178
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,414
Right away, sir!

179
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,998
For as long
as I can remember,

180
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,167
I've dreamed of this moment.

181
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,293
The sacred treasure

182
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,338
that's protected us
for a thousand years

183
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,006
is now in Syracuse.

184
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,883
- A toast!
- To Dymas!

185
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,927
Hear, hear!
To the Book of Peace!

186
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,721
And to you, King Dymas
and Prince Proteus.

187
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,390
Make way!

188
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,064
You see? This is what
happens when you use
the front entrance.

189
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,025
What is he doing here?

190
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,528
At least he's not out
robbing someone.

191
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,280
That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.

192
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,620
I'll bet you ten crowns
you're about to
put those swords down.

193
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,746
I'll take that bet.

194
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,872
Guards...

195
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,541
Put away your swords.

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,585
I don't see you
for ten years,

197
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,129
and now twice
in one day?

198
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,131
You're smothering me.

199
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,760
I knew you'd want
to thank me for
saving your life... Again.

200
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,681
You probably just heard
we had free food and wine.

201
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:52,393
You hear that, guys?
Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.

202
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,937
Come on. There's someone
I want you to meet.

203
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,439
Get to work.

204
00:14:58,774 --> 00:14:59,775
Weapons?

205
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,207
Here she is. I've told
her all about you.

206
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,879
Sinbad, I would like
to introduce you
to my fiancée,

207
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,507
the Lady Marina,
Ambassador from Thrace.

208
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,681
So, this is
the infamous Sinbad.

209
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,683
I heard all about
this morning.

210
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,395
First you tried
to rob Proteus,
and then you save his life.

211
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,606
So, which are you,

212
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,983
a thief or a hero?

213
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,112
Sinbad wanted
to give me an
opportunity to thank...

214
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,074
...him.

215
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,623
Eight months
on the sea

216
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,167
with nothing but eggs
and pickles...

217
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,002
You don't know what
that can do to a man.

218
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,588
It's almost too easy.

219
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,381
There's only
a handful of guards.

220
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,217
Forget it.
Let's get back to the ship.

221
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,970
Just like that?
But the Book
is almost ours.

222
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,435
What?
Who is she?

223
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,728
An old girlfriend?

224
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,189
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

225
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,398
Let's go.

226
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,984
Jed, pack it up.

227
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,861
What? I...
I just put the...

228
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,622
This is just too easy.

229
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,084
Look at it this way:

230
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,251
Now that Sinbad's gone,

231
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,421
your father can finally relax
and enjoy the evening.

232
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,217
Well, you're right about that.
He's trying not to show it,

233
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,886
but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.

234
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,598
He's been planning this day
his whole life.

235
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,686
And soon it will be
your responsibility.

236
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,230
Our responsibility.

237
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,862
It's beautiful.

238
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,072
It is.

239
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,783
My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.

240
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,951
There are guards
on every level,

241
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,411
and if you look
up to the...

242
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,584
You were talking about
the ocean, weren't you?

243
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,963
I only wish
I'd seen more of it.

244
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:30,759
I used to imagine sailing
far beyond the Twelve Cities,

245
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,970
discovering the world.

246
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,890
Look at it, Proteus.

247
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,184
There's so much wonder.

248
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,311
Marina...

249
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,317
Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.

250
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,319
It's always been
expected of us.

251
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,948
But politics is not a reason
to get married.

252
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,326
I don't want you to do this
just because it's your duty.

253
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,581
I'm asking you
for myself now.

254
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:02,750
Marina...

255
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,420
Will you marry me?

256
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,840
- Proteus, I...
- There you are!

257
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,217
I think the delegates
from Manoli are trying
to give a toast.

258
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,387
I'm not sure.
They're doing something
with their knees.

259
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,514
Marina, I need
an ambassador.

260
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,436
Of course, Sire.

261
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,276
Who's there?

262
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,209
Sinbad!

263
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,343
I love playing pretend.

264
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,146
All the pieces
are coming together.

265
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,236
Proteus, the Book!

266
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,764
- Sinbad.
- Proteus!

267
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,057
It's about time.

268
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,977
Do you realize
how serious this is?

269
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,771
Do you realize how many
times I've heard that today?

270
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,941
You've betrayed Syracuse!
Not you, too.

271
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,694
Stealing the Book of Peace,
when you knew how much
it meant to us!

272
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,195
Proteus, here's the way
this works.

273
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,072
First, I actually
commit a crime,

274
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,408
and then you get
to blame me for it!

275
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,243
Then how do
you explain this?

276
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,207
Eris.
What?

277
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,543
Eris. She framed me.

278
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,712
Sinbad, listen to yourself.
Trust me, Proteus,

279
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,631
the Book is in Tartarus.

280
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:59,009
Talk to your father.
Tell him...
This is beyond my father.

281
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,762
The ambassadors
are convening now
for your trial.

282
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,514
Trial? I didn't do it!

283
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,350
Look, I left the Book
on your ship

284
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,061
and that's the last I saw
of it. You were there.

285
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,520
You know the truth.

286
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:11,605
You know me.

287
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,231
Do I?

288
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,733
I knew a kid.

289
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,111
Who are you now, Sinbad?

290
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,532
Look me in the eye
and tell me.

291
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,827
Did you steal the Book?

292
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,289
No.

293
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,836
We've heard enough
of your lies.

294
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,465
Sinbad, for the last time,
give us the Book.

295
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,093
How many times
do I have to say it?

296
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,261
I don't have it!

297
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,388
Very well, then.

298
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,640
The Delegation
of the Twelve Cities

299
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,684
finds you guilty
of treason,

300
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,144
and we sentence you to die.
Take him away.

301
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,771
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

302
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,648
Are you...
Are you people blind?

303
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,816
I didn't do it!

304
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:56,942
Stop!

305
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,362
I demand the right
of substitution.

306
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,656
Take me in his place.

307
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,740
No!

308
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,161
Sinbad says
that Eris took the Book

309
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,371
and I believe him.

310
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,374
Let him go to Tartarus
and recover the Book.
What?

311
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:14,710
What are you doing?

312
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,713
You claim that Eris stole
the Book. Steal it back.

313
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,089
You're good at that.

314
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,508
Hey, look.
I will not be responsible
for your life.

315
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,052
You would do the same for me.
No, I wouldn't.

316
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,346
If Sinbad is allowed
to leave the city,

317
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,140
he'll never come back!

318
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,350
Son, listen to reason.

319
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,144
No, Father, you listen.

320
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,148
Sinbad either stole the Book,
or he's telling the truth

321
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,733
and it's in Tartarus.

322
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,610
Either way,
he's our only hope.

323
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:42,404
But you can't...

324
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:47,284
Proteus, you realize that
if Sinbad does not return,

325
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,870
you will be put to death
in his place.

326
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,707
I understand.

327
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,293
So be it.

328
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,338
Sinbad has ten days
to return the Book.

329
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,341
Release him.

330
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,947
And, Sinbad...

331
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,742
Don't be late.

332
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,617
So, any idea
how we actually
get to Tartarus?

333
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,701
Tartarus?

334
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,078
No, no, no.

335
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,996
People get killed
in Tartarus.

336
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,040
So where are we going?

337
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,293
Fiji.

338
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,505
Fiji? This time of year?

339
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,132
Think of the beaches.

340
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,384
Oh, beautiful,
if you like mosquitoes.

341
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,718
Think of the sun.

342
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,220
It's monsoon season.

343
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,264
Then the women.

344
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,099
They're cannibals, Sinbad.

345
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,642
Exactly.

346
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,353
Come on, Kale.

347
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,896
He's your friend.

348
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,065
Listen to you.
You sound like my mother.

349
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,901
Proteus will be fine.
You're sure of that?

350
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:48,280
You and I both know
Dymas is not going to let
them execute his only son.

351
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,240
So we're running away?
We're retiring.

352
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,201
We don't need another score.
We've got enough.

353
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,078
Now, set a course for Fiji.

354
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,498
Gentlemen,
we're heading to Fiji!

355
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,917
Fiji! Fiji!

356
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,630
Kale... Book.

357
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,257
Proteus.

358
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,636
Look at all this.

359
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,681
I can't believe it.

360
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,850
But this can't be real.

361
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,518
It'd be far too deli...

362
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,733
This is more like it.

363
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:25,901
Stolen from Venezia.

364
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,362
From Pompeii...

365
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,657
And from a brothel
in Syracuse.

366
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,951
Good guess.

367
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,578
What do you think
you're doing here?

368
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,206
I'm here
to make sure you get
the Book of Peace.

369
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,291
Or bring back your
dead body if you fail.

370
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,002
Really? And how are you
going to pull that off?

371
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,837
By whatever means necessary.

372
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,089
Did you bring a crew?
No.

373
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,300
You know how to
get to Tartarus?
No.

374
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,135
Can you navigate
on your own?
Yes!

375
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,971
Well, good! Then I'll dump
your butt in a rowboat,

376
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,557
and you can paddle
all the way back to Syracuse.

377
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,976
'Cause we're going to Fiji.

378
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,231
Fiji?
Yup.

379
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,317
Just as I thought.

380
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,819
What?
Sinbad,

381
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,113
you're not
a very complicated guy.

382
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,074
All someone has
to do is imagine

383
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,326
the most gutless course
of action,

384
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,452
and you're bound to take it.

385
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,287
Hey, this is not my problem.

386
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,998
I did not steal the Book.

387
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:25,085
You're really not going
to lose any sleep over this,
are you?

388
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,212
Not a wink.
Because me,

389
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,798
I'd be tossing and turning,
knowing I'm alive...

390
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,717
Because I let my friend die.

391
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,887
I'm not responsible
for this mess.

392
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,265
And I didn't ask
Proteus to put his neck
on the line for me.

393
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,601
Look, clearly I can't
appeal to your honor.

394
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,229
But I have other ways
of convincing you.

395
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,189
Really?

396
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:49,234
Just how do you
expect to do that?

397
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,652
By speaking your language.

398
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,823
Keep talking.

399
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,124
Yup, this'll do!

400
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,918
But not for first class.

401
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,298
As you can see,
we're well-equipped
to accommodate

402
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,883
the most discerning
of royal tastes.

403
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,386
We have excellent
ocean views...

404
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,682
Luxurious living quarters,

405
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,684
with three
gourmet meals a day...

406
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,478
pickles, eggs, and pickles.

407
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,064
Hey, Spike,
there you are.

408
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,650
I'd like to introduce you
to your new bunkmate.

409
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,110
Well, actually,
you're his new bunkmate,

410
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,695
as it's actually his bunk.

411
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,950
We do hope you have a pleasant
stay aboard the <i>Chimera.</i>

412
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,286
If he starts
hugging your leg,

413
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,038
it means he likes you.

414
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,498
If you think...

415
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,545
How did she even get
on the ship?

416
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,804
Gentlemen, we have
a new course.

417
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,389
We're going to Tartarus.

418
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,350
What
happened to Fiji?

419
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,310
What? No fun?
No beaches?

420
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,145
Rat.

421
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,688
Sorry, Captain.

422
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,983
But did you
say Tartarus?
That's right.

423
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,443
Will that be
the same Tartarus

424
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,737
from which no sailor
ever returns?

425
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,447
The Tartarus
of lost souls,

426
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,032
where they
grind your bones

427
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,950
and pickle your
spleen, and...
No, Rat.

428
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,745
This is the nice Tartarus,
with lots
of beaches and drinks.

429
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,205
You know,
with little umbrellas?

430
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,757
I'm only doing this
for the money.

431
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,134
Right.

432
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,011
So how do we get there?

433
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,223
That star's our point.

434
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:00,865
Well...

435
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,201
Our little thief
isn't going to run away.

436
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,788
He thinks he's going
to pay us a visit.

437
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:12,377
Let's provide
some mood music.

438
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,810
Oh, come on. You look great.

439
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:39,195
Look lively!
Jed, get the long poles!

440
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,614
Pardon me, milady.

441
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,786
Yeah, come on,
come on, come on.

442
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,084
The Dragon's Teeth?

443
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,174
Indeed, <i>signorina.</i>

444
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,301
Only the most
foolish of captains

445
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,510
would dare to sail
a ship through this!

446
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,304
Rat, reef the fors'le.

447
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,973
Excuse me, <i>signorina.</i>

448
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:12,770
Are you sure
you know what...

449
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,564
Yes, we've done this
kind of thing before.

450
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,232
No, there is
no other way.
Look...

451
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,984
And, yes,
you have my permission
to stand there quietly

452
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,278
and get a free lesson
in sailing.

453
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:21,362
You know...

454
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,823
Besides, a ship is
no place for a woman.

455
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:24,908
Jin!

456
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,618
- Easy on the main!
- Aye!

457
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,104
Steady as she goes.

458
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,859
Rocks off the starboard bow!

459
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,048
Steady.

460
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,562
What is that sound?

461
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,403
<i>Sinbad...</i>

462
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,447
<i>Sinbad...</i>

463
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,074
Sinbad, I...

464
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:51,869
Sirens.

465
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:06,467
Sinbad.

466
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,640
Sinbad!

467
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:13,725
Jin?

468
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,768
Li?

469
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,688
Come and get it, ladies!

470
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,106
Kale?

471
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,482
Come with me.

472
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,568
We'll speak of love.

473
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,113
Who's bad?

474
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,240
Sin-bad.

475
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,242
Men.

476
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,011
I saw her first!

477
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,016
Round the deck! Now!

478
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,144
Yeah...

479
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,357
<i>Amore! Amore! Amore!</i>

480
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,317
My darling.
Rat!

481
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,401
I love you.

482
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,968
Spike!
Get Sinbad!

483
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,633
Spike, the blades!

484
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,183
Oh, my precious.

485
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,101
Wake up, you idiot!

486
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:04,395
What happened?

487
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,980
Sinbad saved us.

488
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,774
No, Marina.

489
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,276
Marina saved us?
Marina!

490
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,778
Marina saved us.

491
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,696
All right, men,
snap out of it.

492
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,240
Let's get back to reality.
We got a ship to sail.

493
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,702
Here's my little hero.
You were so brave.

494
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,038
Yeah. What a good dog.

495
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,502
Still think a ship's
no place for a woman?

496
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,339
Absolutely!

497
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,801
I mean, look at my ship!

498
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,178
This railing was
hand-carved mahogany!

499
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:40,306
And here! These moldings came
all the way from Damascus!

500
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,766
Do you have any idea

501
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,893
what I went through
to steal these?

502
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:48,105
That's exactly
why women shouldn't drive.

503
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:53,277
Are you crazy?
I saved your life!

504
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,154
I would've been fine.

505
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,198
I always am.

506
00:35:58,324 --> 00:35:59,408
Right.

507
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,746
So ungrateful.
It's just typical.

508
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,542
And you chipped the paint!

509
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,835
Right here...
Look at it.

510
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,294
That's more than
a little scratch.

511
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,817
The dog and the crew
and that woman!

512
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,494
What?

513
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,912
Thank you!
You're welcome!

514
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,414
No problem!
Don't worry about it!

515
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,748
I won't!
Good!

516
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,292
Good-bye!
Bye to you!

517
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,803
You happy now?

518
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,286
Proteus, come quickly.

519
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,288
What?
There's a ship waiting
in the harbor.

520
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,706
A crew of my most
trusted officers

521
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,917
will take you far
from Syracuse.

522
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,253
But the ambassadors' guards?
Are asleep or well-bribed.

523
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:35,796
But we must go now.

524
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,215
Go where?

525
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,384
To live the rest
of my life in exile?

526
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:44,597
To live, son. I won't
let them execute you
for Sinbad's crime.

527
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,806
Neither will Sinbad.

528
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,516
Proteus, don't be foolish!

529
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,019
Sinbad has no intention
of going to Tartarus.

530
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,938
The Sinbad you knew
as a child is...

531
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:54,231
Is still in him as a man.

532
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,025
I've seen it.

533
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,693
Proteus...

534
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:01,989
Go, Father.

535
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,325
I know what I'm doing.

536
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,262
All right, listen up.
We're here for ten minutes.

537
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,473
You get lost, you get left.

538
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,269
How did one woman
do so much damage?

539
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,064
All right.

540
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,816
I'm going to need
the full set of chisels,

541
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,859
the jack plane,
and about
a cord of cut wood.

542
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:40,695
All right, men,
you heard the captain.

543
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,863
Find some logs
and be quick about it.

544
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,991
Oh, for heaven's sake!

545
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,283
You only need
a little tree sap,

546
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,160
and she'll be
as good as new.

547
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:51,414
When I want your advice,
I'll... Hey, hey, hey!

548
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:52,873
Where do you think
you're going?

549
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,292
Well, fine!
At least take
someone with...

550
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:56,377
May I assist you, lady?

551
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,962
Why, thank you.

552
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,588
Right this way,
<i>signorina.</i>
How nice to see

553
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:02,883
some men haven't forgotten
a little common courtesy.

554
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,885
Common courtesy.

555
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,763
Not so fast.
But you know she's right.

556
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:10,141
The tree sap would
be perfect for...
Just...

557
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,560
Stay with the ship.

558
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,524
I already said thank you.

559
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,026
That's what this is
all about, isn't it?

560
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,153
It's about repairing the ship.

561
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,280
If I break something,
I fix it.

562
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,032
Knife, please.

563
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:28,576
Oh, yeah,
like I'd give you a weapon?

564
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,495
Thank you, Rat.

565
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,790
You know, you really
ought to be

566
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:37,209
a little more courteous.

567
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,671
Oh, great. Now I'm getting
etiquette lessons

568
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,381
from a bilge rat.

569
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,133
Well, she did save
the ship, Captain.

570
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,885
Why, thank you, Luca.

571
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,803
And now
she's helping to fix it.

572
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,805
Very handy, I say.
And brave!

573
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:53,225
This girl wouldn't know how
to fix a broken fingernail!

574
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:56,062
Honestly, you are
the most boorish,

575
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,064
pig-headed man
I've ever met.

576
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,191
Hey, lady, I've seen
the highborn boys

577
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,693
your type hangs out with.

578
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,695
And I'm the only man
you've ever met.

579
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,792
Oh, no. No. No.

580
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,960
No...

581
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,172
Five on Marina.

582
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:27,760
You... You...

583
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,304
- Egotistical...
- You spoiled...

584
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:33,140
Disrespectful,
pretentious...
Deluded...

585
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:34,767
Pompous,
self-centered...

586
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,268
High-and-mighty...
Untrustworthy,

587
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,188
ungrateful, impossible,
insufferable...

588
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,857
At least I'm not repressed!
Repressed?

589
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,734
I'll show you
repressed!

590
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,453
What the...

591
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:02,878
Put it back.

592
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,652
Run!

593
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,487
- It's a fish!
- It's a fish!

594
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,780
Kale!

595
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,158
Kale!

596
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:46,881
Jump!

597
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:55,389
Kale!

598
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,473
Got it!

599
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,399
Veer off, Kale!

600
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:06,609
The star!

601
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:09,987
Hold your heading!

602
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,488
Rat, tie it off!

603
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:13,073
Wha... wha...

604
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,287
Wait!

605
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,915
Sinbad!

606
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,792
The men can't take much more.

607
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:06,627
I can't...

608
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,671
Take much more, either.

609
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,047
Cut the line!

610
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,730
Oh, no, Spike!

611
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,023
- Hold on, no...
- No, no, no, please...

612
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:29,817
Oh, Spike!

613
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,487
Hey, where'd he get
the carrots?

614
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,452
Whose idea was that again?

615
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,371
I don't know.

616
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:45,499
But he owes me lunch.

617
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,173
The Granite Gates.

618
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:55,217
Bet you never thought
I'd get us this far.

619
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:56,593
No, I didn't.

620
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,430
But Proteus did.

621
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:02,266
For some reason,
he trusts you.

622
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,478
Well, what could
he have been thinking?

623
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,732
How did you
two ever meet?

624
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:14,611
Running for my life,
as usual.

625
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:16,739
A couple of angry thugs
had cornered me

626
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,574
outside the palace walls.

627
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,409
I was trapped.

628
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:21,744
A sword at my throat,

629
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,537
at my chest, at my...

630
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,040
Pickles and eggs!

631
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:30,669
Well, you get the idea.

632
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:33,464
And then suddenly,
there was a fourth blade.

633
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:34,840
It was Proteus.

634
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:36,967
You see,
he'd watched it all
from his room in the palace.

635
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:38,677
He actually climbed down

636
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,596
the castle wall
to fight at my side,

637
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,681
and, boy, did we fight.

638
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,433
It was like we'd rehearsed it.

639
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,728
We were best friends
from that day forward.

640
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,647
What happened with you two?

641
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,614
What is it?

642
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:02,326
We took different paths.

643
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:16,340
Enough talking.

644
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:18,133
Time for some screaming.

645
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,656
For crying out loud,
what next?

646
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,575
Get a shirt on

647
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,244
before you poke
someone's eye out.

648
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:50,541
Okay, guys, get down there
and break it up!

649
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:51,917
We've got to keep moving!

650
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,797
Steal the Book of Peace.

651
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,217
We will retire
in the tropics.

652
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,877
Everyone, back on the ship!

653
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,128
Hurry!

654
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,046
Come on!
Come on! Move faster!

655
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:54,730
Jed!

656
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:00,819
Grab the rope!

657
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:07,367
Rat, your hand!

658
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:09,786
Marina!

659
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:03,924
Rat! Don't let

660
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,175
- the blocks freeze!
- Aye, aye, Captain.

661
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:07,219
- And, Kale!
- Aye!

662
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,596
- Give me a hug?
- Excuse me?

663
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:47,634
She couldn't see the bird?

664
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:50,345
Everyone else saw it.

665
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,266
It's as big as
a freakin' ship.

666
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,519
Marina?
Marina's looking
the other way.

667
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,577
You're rescuing me!

668
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:17,372
Yes, if that's what
you want to call it.

669
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,124
But this is going
to cost you another diamond.

670
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,418
Rescues aren't part
of the usual tourist package.

671
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:26,506
So...

672
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,591
How are we going
to get down?

673
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:29,718
I... I don't know.

674
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:31,261
What?
I don't know yet.

675
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,722
I'm thinking about it,
all right?

676
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,141
You scaled
a thousand-foot
tower of ice,

677
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:37,851
and you don't know
how to get down?

678
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,228
Of all the ungrateful...

679
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:42,397
Look, if you'd rather
take your chances
on your own,

680
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:43,857
that can be arranged.

681
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,192
All right.

682
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:50,822
So, what do we have
to work with?

683
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:52,574
Ropes?

684
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:53,867
No.

685
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,369
Grappling hooks?

686
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:57,120
Yeah... No.

687
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:58,330
Your swords?

688
00:49:59,665 --> 00:50:01,333
Hey, I've got this.

689
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,793
Oh, great.

690
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:05,128
He can pick his teeth
when he's done with us.

691
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:07,339
Yeah. Okay. See,
in the hands of an expert,

692
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,424
a good knife has 1,001 uses.

693
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:21,186
Run!

694
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:26,775
Come on! Faster!

695
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:31,571
Wait, wait. What?

696
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,407
Let's go!

697
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,950
No!

698
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,928
I think we lost him!

699
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:57,931
I don't think so!
Heads down!

700
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:20,912
Lean right!

701
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:34,634
Come on!

702
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:49,232
Hang on!

703
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:06,500
Yep, there they are.

704
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:17,636
There...

705
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:20,013
Just as I... Planned.

706
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,728
It's Marina!

707
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:33,151
We thought you
were gone forever!

708
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,696
I'm fine. Really.

709
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:39,616
But I'm touched
by your concern.

710
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,253
Sinbad?

711
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,132
Thank you
for coming after me.

712
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:38,341
Well, you...

713
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,012
You're welcome.

714
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:47,017
This life suits you.

715
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,102
Yeah.

716
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,395
I wasn't made for dry land.

717
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,940
And you?

718
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:56,443
Is it the shore
or the sea?

719
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:00,363
I've always
loved the sea.

720
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:03,325
I even dreamed
of a life on it.

721
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,786
But it wasn't meant to be.

722
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,040
I have responsibilities
in Syracuse.

723
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,626
You really have to
give it up?

724
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:15,545
Yes.

725
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,908
You know,
I've traveled the world,

726
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,744
seen things no other
man has seen...

727
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:50,705
But nothing,

728
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:53,667
nothing compares
to the open sea.

729
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,796
And is this
what you always wanted?

730
00:54:57,879 --> 00:54:59,881
Not really.

731
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,300
When we were young,
Proteus and I

732
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:04,719
used to talk about
joining the Royal Navy

733
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:07,430
and serving Syracuse
side by side.

734
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:11,518
But as we got older,
our lives began to change.

735
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:16,398
He's a prince,
and I'm... Well.

736
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:20,902
I was never jealous
of him, though.

737
00:55:21,987 --> 00:55:24,155
Until one morning,
a ship came into harbor,

738
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:26,825
A ship with his
future on it.

739
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:30,662
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

740
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,249
What was on the ship?

741
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:38,420
You.

742
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:42,340
Proteus met you
at the dock.

743
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,384
I jumped on
the first outbound ship

744
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:45,927
and never looked back.

745
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:49,848
Until now.

746
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,501
The gates of Tartarus.

747
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,855
Rat! Give me a lookout!

748
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,655
We're dead.

749
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:48,782
What is it?

750
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,742
It just ends, Captain!

751
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,368
It's the edge of the world!

752
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:56,706
Pay up. It's flat.

753
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,751
Well, that's it.
Time to go home.

754
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,252
Nuh.

755
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:03,129
The captain hasn't
given his orders yet.

756
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:08,593
Follow that star
beyond the horizon.

757
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,554
Beyond the horizon.

758
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:22,357
Sinbad?

759
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:24,984
Men! All hands
to your posts!

760
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:26,569
Free all sheets!
Wait for my command!

761
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:27,862
What?

762
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:31,825
Now! Go! Go! Go!
Sinbad, how are we
gonna pull this off?

763
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:32,992
Just trust me.

764
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:35,662
Rat! Rig the main yard
to the fors'le!

765
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:37,831
But that would
stop us dead!
Just do it!

766
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:38,998
Aye, aye, Captain.

767
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,005
Slack to all sheets!

768
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:47,173
Aye, aye, Cap'n!

769
00:57:47,257 --> 00:57:48,424
Cut the fore
and main trusses!

770
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,260
Move! Move! Move!

771
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:51,970
I got it.
I got it. I got it.

772
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,598
Aft yard astern!
But that's...

773
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:57,058
Crazy, I know! Now hurry!

774
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,146
Here, grab it!
Go!

775
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,522
Swing the fors'le to port!

776
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,316
Ease the aft!
Full hoist to forward sails!

777
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,860
Aye, aye, Captain.

778
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:08,153
Come on!

779
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:09,404
Pull!

780
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,704
Tie off all sails!

781
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:19,539
All hands amidships!

782
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,749
And pray to the gods.

783
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:24,419
We may be meeting them soon.

784
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:38,975
We're going to die.

785
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:57,076
Hold on! Grab the rope!

786
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:02,707
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

787
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:24,687
It worked?

788
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:26,731
Sinbad...

789
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,107
You did it.

790
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:42,956
Grab hold!

791
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,000
Grum, hard to port!

792
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:47,502
Hard to port!

793
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:50,922
Kale!
Aye!

794
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:53,007
If I don't make it,
the ship is yours.

795
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,801
No.

796
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:58,054
Gentlemen, it's been
a privilege robbing
with you.

797
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:02,558
I'm coming with you.

798
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:03,768
And don't tell me

799
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:06,562
the Realm of Chaos is
no place for a woman.

800
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:12,527
I would never say that.

801
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:19,033
Hey, sorry, boy.

802
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:20,368
Not this time.

803
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:03,513
Now, now, my pets.

804
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:06,140
Is this any way
to treat a guest?

805
01:02:15,942 --> 01:02:19,320
Okay, I'm severely
creeped out.

806
01:02:20,113 --> 01:02:22,156
Bravo.

807
01:02:22,532 --> 01:02:25,743
No mortal has ever made it
to Tartarus before.

808
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:28,955
Alive, that is...

809
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:31,541
Make yourself at home.

810
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,585
Thank you.

811
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,295
Nice place you got here.

812
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,588
Like it?

813
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:40,716
I'm planning on doing
the whole world this way.

814
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,430
That's a good plan.

815
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,890
Well, I see you're busy,
so listen, we'll just take

816
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:50,017
the Book of Peace
and get of your way.

817
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:52,770
What makes you think I have it?

818
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:55,231
Well, you framed me
for the theft,

819
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:56,774
so they would execute me.

820
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:59,068
You?
Yeah.

821
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:02,488
No.

822
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:05,032
Proteus!

823
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,742
You knew he would
take my place.

824
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:09,829
What a clever little man
you are.

825
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:11,747
You thought I'd run.

826
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:15,293
Then Proteus would die,
and Syracuse would be...

827
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:17,628
Left without
the next rightful king,

828
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:21,799
and tumble
into glorious chaos.

829
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:25,219
You humans are so predictable.

830
01:03:25,303 --> 01:03:27,805
Proteus couldn't help
being ever so noble,

831
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:30,266
and you couldn't help
betraying him.

832
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:33,060
But I didn't betray Proteus!
I didn't run away.

833
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:35,396
But you did betray him.

834
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,024
You stole his only love.

835
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:40,193
Look at her, Sinbad.

836
01:03:40,276 --> 01:03:42,153
He's not even
in his grave yet,

837
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:45,281
and you're moving in
on his girl.

838
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:50,703
Face it, your heart
is as black as mine.

839
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:53,915
You're wrong about him!
He knows I'm not!

840
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:55,374
You don't know
what's in his heart.

841
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:56,584
Oh, yes, I do.

842
01:03:56,667 --> 01:04:00,087
And more importantly,
so does he.

843
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:01,756
In your heart,
you know that

844
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,424
Proteus is
going to die

845
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:05,968
because he saw
something in you

846
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:08,638
that just isn't there.

847
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:10,848
No.
You want to bet?

848
01:04:10,932 --> 01:04:13,434
I'll tell you what.
Let's play a game.

849
01:04:13,518 --> 01:04:16,229
And if you win,
I'll give you

850
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:17,480
the Book of Peace.

851
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:24,278
There it is, noble hero.

852
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:29,158
Not so fast.

853
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:31,118
My game has rules,
Sinbad.

854
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:33,037
I'll ask you a question.

855
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,248
One simple question.

856
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:39,043
If you answer truthfully,
the Book is yours.

857
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:41,003
Give me your word.

858
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:43,172
You still don't trust me?

859
01:04:43,256 --> 01:04:45,508
No.

860
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:49,637
Isn't it a pity we live
in such skeptical times?

861
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,305
All right.

862
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:54,976
You have my word,
as a Goddess.

863
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:57,687
Fair enough?

864
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:02,400
Ask your question.

865
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:04,110
Excellent.

866
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:05,736
Now, we all know what happens

867
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,780
if you get the Book of Peace.

868
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:11,325
You return it to Syracuse
and save Proteus.

869
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:13,578
But if you don't get the Book,

870
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,705
you have
a choice to make.

871
01:05:15,788 --> 01:05:17,623
Either sail to paradise

872
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:19,333
with the woman
of your dreams,

873
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:22,962
or return to Syracuse to die.

874
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,257
You're either a thief
or a hero.

875
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,509
So, here's my question,
Sinbad.

876
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:31,262
If you don't get the Book,

877
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:33,681
will you go back to die?

878
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:50,031
I will go back.

879
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:03,711
You're lying.

880
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:48,130
I'm sorry, Marina.

881
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,175
Eris is right about me.

882
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:53,552
No, she's not.
You answered her question.

883
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:54,679
You told the truth.

884
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:56,013
It wasn't the truth.

885
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:00,267
It was me trying to pass
myself off as someone I'm not.

886
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:02,395
Sinbad,
I've seen who you are!

887
01:07:02,478 --> 01:07:04,313
You don't need to pretend!

888
01:07:04,397 --> 01:07:06,023
Eris trapped you!

889
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:09,276
Why should you or Proteus
or anyone have to die?

890
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,154
Marina...
No! You need to escape.

891
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:14,407
Get as far away as you can.

892
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,409
I'll go back.
I'll explain everything.

893
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:18,369
No, Marina.

894
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:21,789
I can't watch you die!

895
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,668
I love you.

896
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:54,739
But could you love a man
who would run away?

897
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:05,059
I bet you thought
I wouldn't make it.

898
01:09:06,227 --> 01:09:08,020
I was...

899
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,396
...beginning to wonder.

900
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:15,820
The Book?

901
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:18,405
I did my best.

902
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,283
It wasn't enough.

903
01:09:22,827 --> 01:09:24,036
No.

904
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,123
You came back anyway.

905
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:30,543
How could I do
anything else...

906
01:09:31,752 --> 01:09:32,920
my friend?

907
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,118
Get back!

908
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:04,303
How dare you?

909
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:08,223
Everything
was going perfectly,

910
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:11,185
and now you do this!

911
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:17,441
Eris, I don't understand.

912
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:20,694
Don't play coy with me.

913
01:11:20,778 --> 01:11:23,822
Maybe you can
fool these people,

914
01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:25,783
but I know who you are.

915
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:29,536
You're a selfish,
unprincipled liar!

916
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:31,538
Wait a minute.

917
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:34,124
I didn't lie.

918
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,668
I came back.

919
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:36,794
That's why you're here.

920
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:38,462
This was all
part of your test.

921
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:39,838
I told the truth.

922
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:41,674
And wasn't there something

923
01:11:41,757 --> 01:11:44,051
about being
"bound for all eternity"?

924
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:09,493
Well, well, well.

925
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:12,121
This has got to be a little
embarrassing for you, Eris.

926
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:15,749
Don't push your luck, Sinbad.

927
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:19,878
You're cute,
but not that cute.

928
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:25,426
And lucky for you,
I've got places to go,

929
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:28,846
things to destroy,
stuff to steal.

930
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:31,223
Ta.

931
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:24,610
You know,
for what it's worth,

932
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:26,695
I think the council
believes you now.

933
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,784
You think?

934
01:13:39,792 --> 01:13:41,043
King Dymas.

935
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:43,253
Hey.

936
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:44,505
How much you got on you?

937
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:49,384
I offer you the gratitude
of the Twelve Cities,

938
01:13:49,468 --> 01:13:51,637
and the apology of a king.

939
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:54,139
No, really. How much?

940
01:13:55,057 --> 01:13:56,433
Sinbad.

941
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:05,526
Come on.
This is going to be
a heck of a party.

942
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,778
Everyone's going to want
to hear about the voyage.

943
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,240
Fair winds, calm seas.

944
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:12,574
Nothing much to tell.

945
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:17,579
What's the matter? No fun
if you're actually invited?

946
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:25,045
No, it's just...

947
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:27,256
There's a hammock in Fiji
with my name on it.

948
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:34,513
Good sailing, Sinbad.

949
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:38,892
Get a haircut.

950
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:41,311
You're going to
be king someday.

951
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:21,476
Just another
uneventful day in Syracuse.

952
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:29,568
You know, I stood here
with a woman once.

953
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:31,820
She looked over the ocean

954
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:34,448
and wished she could sail
beyond the horizon.

955
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:37,951
She saw... such wonder.

956
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:41,747
And what happened
to this woman?

957
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:43,832
She got her chance.

958
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:48,170
She sailed the seas,
and she fell in love.

959
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:53,800
Proteus, I...

960
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:57,638
Marina, follow your heart.

961
01:15:58,305 --> 01:16:00,182
Mine is here in Syracuse.

962
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:02,100
Yours...

963
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:04,937
Yours is sailing
with the next tide.

964
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,610
Oh, Proteus.

965
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:31,380
Captain?

966
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:34,216
We're ready to sail.

967
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:36,760
All right, Kale.

968
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:39,137
Take us out.

969
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:40,639
Aye, aye, Captain.

970
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:41,932
Cast off!

971
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,373
Rat!

972
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,457
What?

973
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,713
Excuse me, Captain.

974
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:15,590
You need to replace
these rig joints pretty soon.

975
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:17,634
The mizzen ropes
need the support.

976
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:23,223
These joints
were from the Jasmine Sea.

977
01:17:23,307 --> 01:17:25,100
That's halfway
around the world.

978
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:27,227
Then we'd better get started.

979
01:17:32,316 --> 01:17:35,652
Well, you know,
that means going through
the Hydra's lair.

980
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,237
The Minotaur's haven.

981
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:38,655
The Cyclops' den.

982
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:40,198
Under the Swansea Bridge.

983
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:42,200
Through the China Seas.

984
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:44,828
That's a very long voyage.

985
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:48,540
And it's very,
very dangerous.

986
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:49,958
Don't worry.

987
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:51,793
I'll protect you.

988
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,478
Oh, Spike.

989
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:10,812
Spike.

990
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:14,274
Spike... Down.
