is we cut it a little close.

sure that we fill the log...

- Exactly. All the way to the top.

- Because, what are we?
- Foragers!

to do a little comparison.

346
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,437
Look at this, the grass seems
to be greener over here.

347
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,110
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

348
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,937
Yeah, 'cause
the raccoon says...

349
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,318
Okay, enough about him.
I get it.

350
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,594
So, he can do
a couple of tricks.

351
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,156
I mean, it's not like
he can walk on water.

352
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,488
Hey, everybody!
This way to the food!

353
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,041
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?

354
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,246
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

355
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,173
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk.

356
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,548
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans fit in there?

357
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,503
Usually? One.

Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,097
Of the homeowner's
association? Right.

360
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,598
- Jeepers.
- What is that?

361
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,932
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

362
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,809
And they are just as scared
of us as we are of them.

363
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,146
Now, if a human does happen
to see you, just lay down,

364
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,324
roll over and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

365
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,948
The homeowner's charter,
which you signed,

366
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,778
says the grass is supposed
to be two inches,

367
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,032
and according to my measuring
stick, yours is 2.5.

368
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,501
Could we just
get the food and go?

369
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,419
Really,
do they have it, or not?

370
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,714
Didn't you see it?

371
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,586
It was in the box.
They've always got food with them.

372
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,090
We eat to live,
these guys live to eat.

Let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,220
<i>The human mouth
is called a "pie hole."</i>

375

The human being
is called a "couch potato."

00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,513
That is a device

- (DOORBELL RINGING)
- That is one of the many voices of food.

378
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,519
That is the portal
for the passing of the food.

379
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,943
That is one of the many
food transportation vehicles.

380
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,358
Humans bring the food,
take the food,

381
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,910
ship the food,
they drive the food,

382
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,453
they wear the food!

383
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,077
That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

384
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,284
That... I'm not sure
what that is.

What do you know? Food!

388
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,250
That is the altar
where they worship food.

389
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,923
That's what they eat when
they've eaten too much food.

390
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,596
That gets rid of the guilt
so they can eat more food.

391
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,595
Food! Food! Food! Food!

392
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,142

393
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,471
So, you think
they have enough?

00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:00,359
Well, they don't. For humans,
enough is never enough!

And what do they do
with the stuff they don't eat?

397
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,487

some cookies so valuable

them say "rabid squirrel"?

just be overreacting.

WOMAN: Stop! What's he doing?

855
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,171
- What was that?
- Play, play, play, play.

856
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,967
I'm all right, I'm fine.
It's okay. It's...

857
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,810
Verne, unhook the chain.

858
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,394

859
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,068

No.

Yes.

862
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:38,985
Bad.

863
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,359
- Oh, boy.
- Wow!

Verne, I told you to
unhook the chain.

867

Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight...

Verne, you all right there?

877
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,389
- Gimme a hand, Oz.
- Sure, sure.

878
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,349
- What the heck happened?
- What happened?

879
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,607
It's gone.
The food! Gone!

880
00:44:58,905 --> 00:44:59,941
- What?
- Gone?

881
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,569
- How's it gone?
- Ask him!

882
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,569
- Verne?
- I returned it

883
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,949
to its rightful owner.
LOU and OZZIE: What?

884
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,702
We, like, worked
our tails off, you know?

885
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,830
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally...

886
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,795
You know. And you're...
You're all, whatever.

887
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,128
Yeah, Verne, what were you
thinking? The log was full!

888
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,128
- Full of junk.
- So, what are you saying there?

889
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,929
That the food
we gather our way

890
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,758
isn't as good as the food
we gather your way?

891
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,968
Your way?
You mean his way.

892
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,221
Can't you see RJ is
just using you?

893
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,314
(GASPS)

894
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,015
Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.

895
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,186
You have got to trust me on
this. Don't you understand

896
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,770
there's something
wrong with this guy?

897
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,572
My tail tingles
every time I get near him.

898
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,909
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

899
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,488
I'm starting to think that little tingle
of yours is just you being jealous.

900
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,949
- Jealous? Of him?
- Yeah.

901
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,826
He's embracing
the future there,

902
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,627
and you're just
holding us back.

903
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,205
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.

904
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,923
See what you've
done here?

905
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,171
If they listened to
half the stuff you're telling them,

906
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,844
they'll be dead
within a week.

907
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,259
You are only interested
in taking advantage of them

908
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,762
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.

909
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,680
I'm not stupid.

910
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,193
Okay, I didn't mean...

911
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,563
I meant ignorant.

912
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,784
To the ways over...
over there.

913
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,829
Come on, you guys.
You know I didn't mean it like that.

914
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,664
Don't... don't do this.

No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.
