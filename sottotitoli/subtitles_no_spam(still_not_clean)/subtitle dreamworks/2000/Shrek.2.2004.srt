1
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:57,467
Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, far away,

2
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,971
the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.

3
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:05,725
And throughout the land,
everyone was happy...

4
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:07,810
until the sun went down

5
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:11,940
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment

6
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:15,068
that took hold each and every night.

7
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:20,198
Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy godmother

8
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,284
who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower,

9
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:27,163
there to await the kiss
of the handsome Prince Charming.

10
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,294
It was he who would chance
the perilous journey

11
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,047
through blistering cold
and scorching desert

12
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,424
traveling for many days and nights,

13
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:40,677
risking life and limb

14
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:44,263
to reach the Dragon's keep.

15
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,229
For he was the bravest,

16
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,940
and most handsome...

17
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:58,695
in all the land.

18
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:01,447
And it was destiny that his kiss

19
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:05,827
would break the dreaded curse.

20
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:11,666
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

21
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:16,295
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

22
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,424
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her...

23
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,634
What?

24
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:25,304
- Princess Fiona?
- No!

25
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:28,433
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?

26
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:32,770
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?

27
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,787
<i>So she said
what's the problem, baby?</i>

28
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,622
<i>What's the problem?
I don't know</i>

29
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,708
<i>Well, maybe I'm in love</i>

30
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,252
<i>Think about it
every time I think 'bout it</i>

31
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,671
<i>Can't stop thinking 'bout it</i>

32
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,883
<i>How much longer
will it take to cure this?</i>

33
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,594
<i>Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it</i>

34
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:06,012
<i>If it's love, love</i>

35
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:08,389
<i>Makes me wanna turn around
and face me</i>

36
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:11,059
<i>But I don't know nothing
'bout love</i>

37
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,935
<i>Oh, come on, come on</i>

38
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,229
<i>Turn a little faster</i>

39
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:16,814
<i>Come on, come on</i>

40
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,983
<i>The world will follow after</i>

41
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,568
<i>Come on, come on</i>

42
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,323
<i>Everybody's after love</i>

43
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:33,331
<i>So I said
I'm a snowball running</i>

44
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:37,251
<i>Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love</i>

45
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:40,755
<i>Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight</i>

46
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:42,882
<i>Shimmering love</i>

47
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:44,634
<i>Well, baby, I surrender</i>

48
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:46,761
<i>To the strawberry ice cream</i>

49
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:49,806
<i>Never ever end of all this love</i>

50
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,808
<i>Well, I didn't mean to do it</i>

51
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:55,186
<i>But there's no escaping your love</i>

52
00:03:55,937 --> 00:04:00,108
<i>These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone</i>

53
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:02,318
<i>Never alone, no, no</i>

54
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,986
<i>Come on, come on</i>

55
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,988
<i>Jump a little higher</i>

56
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:07,115
<i>Come on, come on</i>

57
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:09,450
<i>If you feel a little lighter</i>

58
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:10,701
<i>Come on, come on</i>

59
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,080
<i>We were once upon a time in love</i>

60
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,129
<i>We're accidentally in love</i>

61
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:25,007
<i>Accidentally in love</i>

62
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:28,845
<i>Accidentally in love</i>

63
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:32,473
<i>Accidentally in love</i>

64
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:35,810
<i>Accidentally in love</i>

65
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:39,480
<i>Accidentally in love</i>

66
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:41,023
<i>Accidentally</i>

67
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:44,402
<i>I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love</i>

68
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,362
<i>I'm in love, I'm in love</i>

69
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:49,991
<i>Accidentally in love</i>

70
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:53,828
<i>I'm in love</i>

71
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,663
<i>I'm in love</i>

72
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:57,874
It's so good to be home!

73
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,670
Just you and me and...

74
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:11,220
- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?

75
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:15,224
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

76
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,602
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

77
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,939
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?

78
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,192
Donkey, what are you doing here?

79
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,319
Taking care of your love nest for you.

80
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:30,698
Oh, you mean like sorting the mail
and watering the plants?

81
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:33,784
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.

82
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:36,954
You do now. I call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

83
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,957
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

84
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,752
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.

85
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:46,756
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

86
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:51,010
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

87
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:53,221
Oh, yeah, that.

88
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:56,891
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

89
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,643
I thought I'd move in with you.

90
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,479
You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

91
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,357
But Fiona and I are married now.

92
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,735
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

93
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,906
Just with each other.

94
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,408
Alone.

95
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:17,328
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

96
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,122
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

97
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:21,916
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

98
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,417
You're bothering me.

99
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,922
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...

100
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:31,259
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament anyway, so...

101
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:36,138
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

102
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,311
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

103
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,399
I think I remember.

104
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,111
Donkey!

105
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:53,281
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.

106
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:56,409
What do you want me
to tell these other guys?

107
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:08,546
Enough, Reggie.

108
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:14,260
Dearest Princess Fiona.

109
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:18,514
You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

110
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:23,269
for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

111
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:25,479
at which time the King

112
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:30,609
will bestow his royal blessing
upon you and your...

113
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:32,820
Prince Charming.

114
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:37,533
Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

115
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:40,077
Aka Mom and Dad.

116
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,495
Mom and Dad?

117
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:44,957
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?

118
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,834
- We're not going.
- What?

119
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,879
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

120
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,965
shocked to see you like this?

121
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:55,468
Well, they might be
a bit surprised.

122
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:58,721
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

123
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:01,140
And don't worry.
They'll love you too.

124
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,183
Yeah, right.

125
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:05,019
Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome
at the country club.

126
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,896
Stop it.
They're not like that.

127
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,483
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

128
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:13,986
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

129
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,113
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

130
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:19,075
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

131
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,245
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?

132
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,790
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

133
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,917
Who says I want
to be part of this family?

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,003
You did!
When you married me!

135
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,130
Well, there's some fine print for you!

136
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:36,217
So that's it. You won't come?

137
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:41,555
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!

138
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,060
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

139
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:51,565
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

140
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,069
Hey, wait for me.

141
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:06,705
Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!

142
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:09,250
Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!

143
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,627
Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!

144
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,090
Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!

145
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:18,175
Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!

146
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,844
Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!

147
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,471
Rawhide! Yee-haw!

148
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:30,604
- Are we there yet?
- No.

149
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:36,694
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

150
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,991
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.

151
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:44,827
- Are we there yet?
- No!

152
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:46,912
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

153
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,289
- Really?
- No!

154
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:49,832
- Are we there yet?
- No!

155
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:51,709
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!

156
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,336
- Are we there yet?
- No!

157
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:57,548
Are we there yet?

158
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:01,677
That's not funny.
That's really immature.

159
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,013
This is why nobody likes ogres.

160
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:05,431
Your loss!

161
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:08,809
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!

162
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:12,480
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

163
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:16,400
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

164
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:20,779
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

165
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,490
away!

166
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:26,160
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.

167
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:28,829
Well, find a way
to entertain yourself.

168
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,188
For five minutes...

169
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,317
Could you not be yourself
for five minutes.

170
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:07,576
Are we there yet?

171
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,329
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

172
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:29,765
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

173
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:32,768
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

174
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,274
<i>Gotta make a move
to a town that's right for me</i>

175
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,071
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

176
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,283
Halt!

177
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:53,414
<i>Well, I talk about it, talk about it,
talk about it, talk about it</i>

178
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,793
Hey, everyone, look.

179
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:01,338
<i>Talk about, talk about movin'...</i>

180
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:12,683
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

181
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,319
Swimming pools!
Movie stars!

182
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,815
Announcing the long-awaited return

183
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,487
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

184
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:09,948
Well, this is it.

185
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:11,992
- This is it.
- This is it.

186
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:13,327
This is it.

187
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:39,520
Why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

188
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:44,858
So...

189
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,945
you still think
this was a good idea?

190
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:52,449
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

191
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:56,704
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that's our little girl.

192
00:13:56,787 --> 00:14:00,165
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

193
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,544
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

194
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:06,839
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

195
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:10,592
Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

196
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:13,095
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

197
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:16,432
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

198
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:18,016
That was for my own...

199
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,937
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

200
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,272
Harold, we have to be...

201
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:26,275
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

202
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:28,360
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

203
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,779
A disaster! There is no way...

204
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,489
- You can do this.
- I really...

205
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:35,075
really... don't... want...
to... be...

206
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,244
Here!

207
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:42,291
Mom... Dad...

208
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,627
I'd like you to meet my husband...

209
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:47,463
Shrek.

210
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,675
Well...

211
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,095
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

212
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:35,469
Excuse me.

213
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:39,264
Better out than in,
I always say, eh, Fiona?

214
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:43,393
That's good.

215
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,187
I guess not.

216
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,733
What do you mean, not on the list?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

217
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,486
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

218
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:56,990
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

219
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:59,910
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

220
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,455
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me, the noble steed.

221
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,582
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?

222
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,209
Oh, boy.

223
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,380
- Shrek?
- Yeah?

224
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:15,008
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs. Q.

225
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,136
No, no. Darling.

226
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:26,520
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.

227
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:28,188
Well...

228
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,607
Shrek owns his own land.

229
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:34,027
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

230
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:36,905
It's in an enchanted forest

231
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:41,743
abundant in squirrels
and cute little duckies and...

232
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:43,161
What?

233
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:45,414
I know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

234
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:49,626
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.

235
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,629
I suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.

236
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,934
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

237
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:08,937
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!

238
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:12,190
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?

239
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:15,068
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

240
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,486
I got to go to the bathroom.

241
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,032
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

242
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:26,955
Bon appetit!

243
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,499
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.

244
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,211
Let's not sit here with our tummies
rumbling. Everybody dig in.

245
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:34,671
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

246
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:38,550
I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...

247
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:40,969
Ogres, yes!

248
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:44,014
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

249
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,849
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

250
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,144
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

251
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,020
Dad!

252
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:54,733
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

253
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:58,528
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.

254
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,906
Day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

255
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:04,159
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

256
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,625
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

257
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,339
- Harold!
- Shrek!

258
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:18,423
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

259
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:19,758
- Mom!
- Harold...

260
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:20,842
Donkey!

261
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:27,075
<i>Your fallen tears have called to me</i>

262
00:19:27,993 --> 00:19:31,955
<i>So, here comes my sweet remedy</i>

263
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:37,377
<i>I know what every princess needs</i>

264
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:42,257
<i>For her to live life happily...</i>

265
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:48,388
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.

266
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:51,308
You're all grown up.

267
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:55,020
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

268
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:57,105
I'm your fairy godmother.

269
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,816
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

270
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,279
Now, don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.

271
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:07,407
With just a...

272
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:11,703
<i>Wave of my magic wand,
your troubles will soon be gone</i>

273
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:16,666
<i>With a flick of the wrist and just a flash,
you'll land a prince with a ton of cash</i>

274
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,710
<i>A high-priced dress
made by mice no less</i>

275
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:20,921
<i>Some crystal glass pumps
and no more stress</i>

276
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,964
<i>Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse</i>

277
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:24,758
<i>Confide in your very own
furniture friends</i>

278
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,969
<i>We'll help you set
a new fashion trend</i>

279
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:32,057
<i>- I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
- The kind of girl a prince would date!</i>

280
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,434
<i>They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...</i>

281
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:36,603
<i>For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!</i>

282
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:40,649
<i>A sporty carriage to ride in style,
sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle</i>

283
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:44,319
<i>Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
cellulite thighs will fade away</i>

284
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:47,114
<i>And, oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!</i>

285
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,992
<i>Nip and tuck, here and there
to land that prince with the perfect hair</i>

286
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:54,496
<i>Lipstick liners, shadows blush,
to get that prince with the sexy tush</i>

287
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:57,582
<i>Lucky day, hunk buffet,
you and your prince take a roll in the hay</i>

288
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,877
<i>You can spoon on the moon
with the prince to the tune</i>

289
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:03,588
<i>Don't be drab, you'll be fab,
your prince will have rock-hard abs</i>

290
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:06,341
<i>Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day,
have some chicken fricassee!</i>

291
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:08,969
<i>Nip and tuck, here and there,
to land that prince with the perfect hair</i>

292
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,138
Stop!

293
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:12,973
Look...

294
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,767
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

295
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:18,728
but I really don't need all this.

296
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:23,650
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you anyway.

297
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,820
Fiona? Fiona?

298
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,994
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

299
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:37,831
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

300
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:41,293
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

301
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:45,005
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

302
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,756
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

303
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,760
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

304
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,637
She's just trying to help.

305
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:55,932
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

306
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:57,517
- What?
- I don't want to leave.

307
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,144
When did you decide this?

308
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:01,897
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

309
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,358
No, that's all right.
I need to go anyway.

310
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,737
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me...

311
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:09,988
happiness...

312
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,781
is just a teardrop away.

313
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:14,409
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

314
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:16,369
Happy, happy, happy...

315
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:18,622
So I see.

316
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,540
Let's go, Kyle.

317
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:24,836
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

318
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,631
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

319
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:30,383
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

320
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,053
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

321
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:34,888
even if I did want it.

322
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:39,017
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

323
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,478
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

324
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:46,441
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

325
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:49,527
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

326
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:51,071
Here's a news flash for you!

327
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:55,075
Whether your parents like it or not,
I am an ogre!

328
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,668
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

329
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:14,594
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

330
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:20,475
That's real smooth, Shrek.
I'm an ogre!

331
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:47,836
I knew this would happen.

332
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,838
You should.
You started it.

333
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:53,925
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

334
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,470
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

335
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,889
This is Fiona's choice.

336
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:03,059
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

337
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:07,355
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this thing?

338
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:11,359
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

339
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:16,072
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

340
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:18,742
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

341
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:21,661
Don't you remember when
we were young?

342
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,706
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

343
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:28,001
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

344
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:29,502
It's not the same!

345
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:33,590
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

346
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,009
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

347
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:37,969
Fine!
Pretend there's nothing wrong!

348
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:41,056
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!

349
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:43,183
I'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

350
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:44,517
Hello, Harold.

351
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,644
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

352
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:49,689
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

353
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,526
I'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

354
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:56,696
You better get in.
We need to talk.

355
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,865
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

356
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:02,619
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

357
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:06,539
So, how about we make this
a quick visit. What?

358
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:09,501
Oh, hello.

359
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,797
So, what's new?

360
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,592
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

361
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:21,137
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

362
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,390
When did you get back?

363
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:26,434
Oh, about five minutes ago actually.

364
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:30,063
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

365
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:33,149
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

366
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:35,610
Mommy can handle this.

367
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:39,823
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

368
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:43,868
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

369
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:45,078
And what does he find?

370
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,873
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

371
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:50,834
is already married.

372
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:53,378
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

373
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,130
Stop the car!

374
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:58,299
Harold.

375
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:04,055
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

376
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:06,099
Where are we?

377
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:09,144
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

378
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,356
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy. Okay.

379
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,276
Two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo, chili rings...

380
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,821
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

381
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:21,948
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

382
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,742
- Sourdough soft taco then?
- No, really, I'm fine.

383
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:28,705
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

384
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:29,956
There you are, dear.

385
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:37,172
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

386
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:39,466
Indeed not.

387
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:43,178
So, Fiona and Charming
will be together.

388
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:46,764
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

389
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:49,350
Not only for your daughter...

390
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,645
but for your Kingdom.

391
00:26:57,275 --> 00:26:59,402
What am I supposed to do about it?

392
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,947
Use your imagination.

393
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,404
Come on in, Your Majesty.

394
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:52,539
<i>I like my town</i>

395
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:58,002
<i>With a little drop of poison</i>

396
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:01,548
<i>Nobody knows...</i>

397
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:04,884
Excuse me.

398
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:07,220
Do I know you?

399
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:10,098
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

400
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:13,893
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

401
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:18,398
Ah! There you are. Right.

402
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:23,778
You see, I need to have
someone taken care of.

403
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:28,199
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

404
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:30,118
He's an ogre.

405
00:28:32,954 --> 00:28:34,664
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

406
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:39,085
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

407
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:41,296
he don't like to be disturbed.

408
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:43,047
Where could I find him?

409
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:48,511
Hello?

410
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:51,556
Who dares enter my room?

411
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:55,268
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to

412
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:57,061
about an ogre problem?

413
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:59,439
You are told correct.

414
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:03,276
But for this, I charge
a great deal of money.

415
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,486
Would this be enough?

416
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:17,498
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

417
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,918
Just tell me where
I can find this ogre.

418
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:45,526
<i>Everyone says
I'm getting down too low</i>

419
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:52,450
<i>Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go</i>

420
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:56,245
<i>You just gotta let it go</i>

421
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:08,091
<i>I need some sleep</i>

422
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:11,552
<i>Time to put the old horse down</i>

423
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:15,431
<i>I'm in too deep</i>

424
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:18,810
<i>And the wheels keep spinning round</i>

425
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:26,192
<i>Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go</i>

426
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:33,783
Dear Knight, I pray that you take
this favor as a token of my gratitude.

427
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,390
Dear Diary...

428
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:00,184
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

429
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:04,063
but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.

430
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:07,734
Dad says I'm going away for a while.

431
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:10,153
Must be like some finishing school.

432
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:13,030
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

433
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:15,825
my Prince Charming will rescue me
from my tower

434
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:18,453
and bring me back to my family,

435
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:21,748
and we'll all live
happily ever after.

436
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,585
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

437
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:28,963
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

438
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:30,465
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

439
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:32,842
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

440
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:45,396
Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

441
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,068
No, no. I was just reading
a scary book.

442
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:56,199
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

443
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,743
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.

444
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:02,246
Do you suppose we could pretend
it never happened and start over...

445
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,416
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

446
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,629
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

447
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:13,216
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

448
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:17,762
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

449
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:19,847
A little father-son time?

450
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:24,185
I know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

451
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:37,073
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?

452
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:44,622
Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.

453
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:48,459
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

454
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:50,962
Head to the darkest part
of the woods...

455
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:54,048
Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches.

456
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:58,427
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

457
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:01,389
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

458
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:05,893
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

459
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:07,979
and I end up lost
in the woods with you!

460
00:33:08,062 --> 00:33:10,314
Don't get huffy!
I'm only trying to help.

461
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,358
I know! I know.

462
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:18,072
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

463
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:21,325
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.

464
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,245
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

465
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:33,629
Well, well, well, Donkey.

466
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:37,216
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

467
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,051
What? I ain't purring.

468
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:41,470
Sure. What's next? A hug?

469
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:45,683
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...

470
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,352
Fear me, if you dare!

471
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:50,855
Look! A little cat.

472
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:54,066
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

473
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,152
Come here,
little kitty, kitty.

474
00:33:56,235 --> 00:34:01,324
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Come here, little kitty.

475
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:08,581
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

476
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,917
Oh, God. Oh...

477
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,627
No!

478
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,089
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

479
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,133
Shrek! Hold still!

480
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:24,263
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.

481
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:31,520
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

482
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,108
Puss in Boots!

483
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,735
I'll kill that cat!

484
00:34:57,004 --> 00:35:00,716
- Hairball.
- That is nasty!

485
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:03,678
What should we do with him?

486
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:07,098
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

487
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,474
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!

488
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,310
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Señor.

489
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:13,104
I was doing it only for my family.

490
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:17,191
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!

491
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:20,778
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...

492
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:25,157
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

493
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,159
The rich King? Si.

494
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:34,083
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

495
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,503
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

496
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:38,963
Gee, thanks.

497
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:46,554
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

498
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:48,014
That's what the King said.

499
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:52,768
Oh, sorry. I thought that question
was directed at me.

500
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:56,814
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'd do anything for her.

501
00:35:56,897 --> 00:36:00,109
Well, it's not like
I wouldn't change if I could.

502
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:04,238
I just... I just wish
I could make her happy.

503
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:07,908
Hold the phone...

504
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,620
Happiness.

505
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:14,582
A tear drop away.

506
00:36:14,665 --> 00:36:18,502
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

507
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:21,213
Aw, man, where do I begin?

508
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:25,593
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

509
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:29,430
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

510
00:36:29,513 --> 00:36:33,601
Then they got drunk and start beating me
with a stick, going piñata!!

511
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:35,019
What is a piñata, anyway?

512
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:37,521
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

513
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:39,023
Don't go projecting on me.

514
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:41,233
I know you're feeling bad,
but you got to...

515
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:46,697
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

516
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:55,915
What? Is it on? Is it on?

517
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,043
This is Fairy Godmother.

518
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:01,337
I'm either away
from my desk or with a client.

519
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:05,925
But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you an appointment.

520
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,843
Have a happy ever after.

521
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,475
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

522
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:18,062
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

523
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:21,649
Ain't no stoppin' us now!
We're on the move!

524
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:26,362
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

525
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:30,282
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life

526
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:32,284
as you have spared me mine.

527
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:35,621
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

528
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,624
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

529
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:50,803
- Shrek!
- Come on, Donkey. Look at him...

530
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:52,805
in his wee little boots.

531
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,142
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

532
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,978
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

533
00:38:02,106 --> 00:38:03,899
Listen. He's purring!

534
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:07,069
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

535
00:38:07,153 --> 00:38:10,656
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

536
00:38:13,784 --> 00:38:15,494
Shrek!

537
00:38:20,249 --> 00:38:21,250
Shrek?

538
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:34,680
They're both festive, aren't they?

539
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:36,682
What do you think, Harold?

540
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:39,018
Yes, yes. Fine. Fine.

541
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:44,690
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

542
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:47,193
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.

543
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:49,570
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

544
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:51,572
Mom. Dad.

545
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:55,284
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

546
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,037
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

547
00:38:58,078 --> 00:39:00,915
I haven't.
You should ask your father.

548
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:05,628
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

549
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:08,130
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes!

550
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,759
Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

551
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:14,970
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

552
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:18,807
Ah, yes. Very good then.
Carry on, Cedric.

553
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:22,978
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.

554
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:26,899
I'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice mud hole to cool down in.

555
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:29,235
You know, after your
little spat last night.

556
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:31,612
You heard that, huh?

557
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:33,405
The whole kingdom heard you.

558
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:36,283
I mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be...

559
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:37,868
well, a bit of a brute.

560
00:39:37,952 --> 00:39:42,122
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

561
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:45,626
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

562
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:49,380
Shrek loves me for who I am.

563
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:52,091
I would think you'd be happy for me.

564
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:55,594
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

565
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:58,931
Maybe you should do the same.

566
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:14,113
No, really?

567
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:29,378
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

568
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,380
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

569
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:34,925
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

570
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:38,637
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? Spell!

571
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,561
He makes me laugh.

572
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:53,277
Hi. I'm here to see the...

573
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,363
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

574
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:59,408
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

575
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:03,996
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

576
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:06,832
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

577
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:09,084
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

578
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,127
The union?

579
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,631
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

580
00:41:14,715 --> 00:41:16,425
Oh! Oh, right.

581
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,595
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

582
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,349
A little.
We don't even have dental.

583
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,100
They don't even have dental.

584
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:27,519
Okay, we'll just have
a look around.

585
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:28,771
Oh, by the way.

586
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:32,191
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

587
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:34,276
Know what I'm saying? Huh?

588
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:38,697
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

589
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:09,812
A drop of desire.

590
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,731
Naughty!

591
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:15,567
A pinch of passion.

592
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:23,158
And just a hint of...

593
00:42:23,784 --> 00:42:24,952
lust!

594
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:30,457
Excuse me.

595
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:32,251
Sorry to barge in like this...

596
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:35,462
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

597
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:40,509
Well, it seems
that Fiona's not exactly happy.

598
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:44,596
And there's some question
as to why that is?

599
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:47,641
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

600
00:42:49,622 --> 00:42:53,230
P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.

601
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:56,525
Here we are.
Lived happily ever after...

602
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:58,777
No ogres!

603
00:42:58,819 --> 00:43:00,279
Let's see. Snow White.

604
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,116
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.

605
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:06,452
Sleeping Beauty.
Oh, no ogres!

606
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:09,663
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

607
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:12,708
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

608
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,461
No, no, no, no, no!

609
00:43:15,502 --> 00:43:19,923
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

610
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:21,633
All right, look, lady!

611
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:25,387
Don't you point
those dirty green sausages at me!

612
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,599
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

613
00:43:28,682 --> 00:43:30,184
Oh! Sorry.

614
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:32,311
Ah, that's okay.

615
00:43:32,394 --> 00:43:34,688
We were just leaving.

616
00:43:34,771 --> 00:43:37,441
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

617
00:43:37,524 --> 00:43:39,318
Just go.

618
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,694
Come on, guys.

619
00:43:56,585 --> 00:43:58,504
TGIF, eh, buddy?

620
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:03,175
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

621
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:15,979
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!

622
00:44:16,063 --> 00:44:18,023
Man, that stinks!

623
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:21,318
You don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses.

624
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:28,825
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!

625
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:31,995
Already our minds are becoming one.

626
00:44:32,496 --> 00:44:36,959
If we need an expert on licking
ourselves, we'll give you a call.

627
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,669
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

628
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:41,964
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

629
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:45,384
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

630
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:47,511
No problema, boss.
In one of my nine lives,

631
00:44:47,594 --> 00:44:50,472
I was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.

632
00:44:51,932 --> 00:44:53,308
Shrek, are you off your nut?

633
00:44:53,392 --> 00:44:54,977
Donkey, keep watch.

634
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,020
Keep watch?
Yeah, I'll keep watch.

635
00:44:57,104 --> 00:45:01,191
I'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

636
00:45:01,275 --> 00:45:04,194
I'll laugh too.
I'll be giggling to myself.

637
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:07,030
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?

638
00:45:07,114 --> 00:45:11,159
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution
for marital problems.

639
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:12,849
Elfa Seltzer?

640
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:16,707
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try handsome.

641
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:19,126
Sorry. No handsome.

642
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:23,463
Hey! How about Happily Ever After?

643
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:25,674
Well, what does it do?

644
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:29,094
It says Beauty Divine.

645
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:32,556
In some cultures, donkeys are revered
as the wisest of creatures.

646
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,182
Especially us talking ones.

647
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:36,393
Donkey!

648
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,938
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

649
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:48,697
Can we get on with this?

650
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:53,619
Hurry!

651
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,670
Nice catch, Donkey!

652
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:05,756
Finally!
A good use for your mouth.

653
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:11,219
Come on!

654
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:19,811
<i>You spurn my natural emotions</i>

655
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:23,690
<i>You make me feel like dirt
and I'm hurt</i>

656
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:30,572
<i>And if I start a commotion</i>

657
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:34,284
<i>I run the risk of losing you
and that's worse</i>

658
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:41,667
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i>

659
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,252
<i>In love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i>

660
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:47,631
<i>In love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with</i>

661
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:57,641
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i>

662
00:46:57,724 --> 00:47:00,477
<i>In love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i>

663
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,063
<i>With someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with</i>

664
00:47:04,523 --> 00:47:06,358
<i>Fallen in love with</i>

665
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:12,197
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with</i>

666
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:17,661
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

667
00:47:17,744 --> 00:47:22,582
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

668
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:27,045
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

669
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:30,590
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

670
00:47:30,674 --> 00:47:32,801
Whoa, what happened here?

671
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:35,971
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?

672
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,557
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

673
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,059
I will smite him where he stands!

674
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:45,147
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

675
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:49,735
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

676
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:52,404
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

677
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:54,531
Pardon...

678
00:47:54,614 --> 00:47:58,869
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

679
00:47:58,952 --> 00:47:59,995
What?

680
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:06,126
I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

681
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:11,631
Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

682
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:14,342
For you and your true love.

683
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:17,095
If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

684
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:20,015
Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine.

685
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:23,810
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona too.

686
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:28,523
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

687
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:31,568
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

688
00:48:31,651 --> 00:48:35,071
It says, Beauty Divine.
How bad can it be?

689
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:40,076
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

690
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:44,581
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

691
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:47,709
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

692
00:48:47,793 --> 00:48:49,711
allow me to take the first sip.

693
00:48:49,795 --> 00:48:53,256
It would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

694
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,467
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

695
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,136
If there'll be any animal testing,
I'll do it.

696
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,306
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

697
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:08,396
How do you feel?

698
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:12,692
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

699
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:14,903
You still look like an ass to me.

700
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:18,031
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

701
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:22,869
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?

702
00:49:22,953 --> 00:49:26,665
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.

703
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:28,625
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.

704
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,377
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!

705
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,838
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!

706
00:49:36,591 --> 00:49:38,552
But I love Fiona more.

707
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:41,763
Shrek, no! Wait!

708
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:58,989
Got to be... I think you grabbed
the Farty Ever After potion.

709
00:49:59,072 --> 00:50:00,866
Maybe it's a dud.

710
00:50:00,907 --> 00:50:03,952
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

711
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:11,209
What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.

712
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:14,588
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die!

713
00:50:14,671 --> 00:50:18,008
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

714
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:20,176
I'm melting!

715
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,178
It's just the rain, Donkey.

716
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,101
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy

717
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:12,771
and Fiona's father hired
a sleazy hitman to whack you.

718
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:16,900
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

719
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:20,111
<i>The sun'll come out...</i>

720
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:21,988
<i>Tomorrow</i>

721
00:51:23,156 --> 00:51:24,783
<i>Bet your bottom...</i>

722
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:26,701
Bet my bottom?

723
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:28,119
I'm coming, Elizabeth!

724
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:29,871
Donkey?

725
00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:31,831
Are you all right?

726
00:51:31,915 --> 00:51:35,794
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- Donkey?

727
00:51:45,178 --> 00:51:47,597
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

728
00:51:48,974 --> 00:51:50,433
What is it, darling?

729
00:51:50,517 --> 00:51:52,143
Dad...

730
00:51:52,227 --> 00:51:54,562
I've been thinking
about what you said.

731
00:51:55,522 --> 00:51:57,440
And I'm going to set things right.

732
00:51:57,565 --> 00:52:00,068
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.

733
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:02,862
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

734
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:05,699
I'm going to go out and find him.

735
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:08,868
And then we'll go back
to the swamp where we belong.

736
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,873
Fiona, please!

737
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:16,960
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

738
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:21,047
Fiona!

739
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,842
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

740
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,763
Good morning, sleepyhead.

741
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,432
Good morning!

742
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:14,059
We love your kitty!

743
00:53:14,142 --> 00:53:17,896
- Oh, my head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.

744
00:53:17,937 --> 00:53:19,522
Thanks.

745
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:30,241
A cute button nose?

746
00:53:30,283 --> 00:53:32,327
Thick, wavy locks?

747
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,246
Taut, round buttocks?

748
00:53:36,081 --> 00:53:37,624
I'm... I'm...

749
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:39,042
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.

750
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:40,794
I'm Jill. What's your name?

751
00:53:40,877 --> 00:53:45,048
- Shrek.
- Shrek? Are you from Europe?

752
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,425
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.

753
00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:50,261
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.

754
00:53:50,345 --> 00:53:51,930
Get in line.

755
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:54,933
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?

756
00:53:56,101 --> 00:53:59,854
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!

757
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:00,980
I can whinny.

758
00:54:01,064 --> 00:54:03,191
I can count.

759
00:54:03,525 --> 00:54:06,444
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!

760
00:54:07,112 --> 00:54:10,240
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

761
00:54:10,323 --> 00:54:13,493
Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad.

762
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:19,249
Warning. Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.

763
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:22,919
Not intended for heart patients
or those with nervous disorders.

764
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:26,089
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place!
Yeah!

765
00:54:28,174 --> 00:54:29,384
What?

766
00:54:29,384 --> 00:54:33,054
Señor? To make the effects
of this potion permanent,

767
00:54:33,138 --> 00:54:36,724
the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight.

768
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:39,144
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?

769
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:42,021
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.

770
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:44,607
I'll be true enough.

771
00:54:44,774 --> 00:54:48,153
Look, ladies,
I already have a true love.

772
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:50,905
And take it from me, Boss.

773
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:54,117
You are going to have
one satisfied Princess.

774
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:56,828
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

775
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,330
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...

776
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:01,416
- Easy.
- cantankerous, foul,

777
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,293
angry ogre you always been.

778
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:05,545
And you're still the same
annoying donkey.

779
00:55:05,628 --> 00:55:07,172
Yeah.

780
00:55:08,298 --> 00:55:09,841
Well...

781
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:14,345
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

782
00:55:15,013 --> 00:55:16,389
First things first.

783
00:55:16,472 --> 00:55:18,975
We need to get you out of those clothes.

784
00:55:22,729 --> 00:55:24,355
- Ready?
- Ready!

785
00:55:28,193 --> 00:55:30,278
Driver, stop!

786
00:55:30,403 --> 00:55:33,489
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

787
00:55:33,573 --> 00:55:35,283
I'm blind! Tell the truth.

788
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,076
Will I ever play the violin again?

789
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,870
You poor creature!

790
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:41,206
Is there anything
I can do for you?

791
00:55:41,247 --> 00:55:43,499
Well, I guess there is one thing.

792
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:46,544
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

793
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,884
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

794
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,187
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?

795
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:13,363
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.

796
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,950
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

797
00:56:23,873 --> 00:56:24,874
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

798
00:56:35,802 --> 00:56:37,929
<i>Turn and face the strange</i>

799
00:56:38,012 --> 00:56:40,139
<i>Changes</i>

800
00:56:40,223 --> 00:56:43,059
<i>Don't wanna be a richer one</i>

801
00:56:43,142 --> 00:56:44,894
<i>Changes</i>

802
00:56:44,978 --> 00:56:47,563
<i>Turn and face the strange</i>

803
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:49,565
<i>Changes</i>

804
00:56:49,649 --> 00:56:52,610
<i>Just gonna have to be
a different man</i>

805
00:56:52,694 --> 00:56:55,196
<i>Time may change me</i>

806
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,408
<i>But I can't trace time</i>

807
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:01,703
Halt!

808
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:05,248
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

809
00:57:09,877 --> 00:57:13,172
<i>Still don't know what
I was looking for</i>

810
00:57:13,256 --> 00:57:18,761
<i>And my time was running wild,
a million dead-end streets</i>

811
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:21,931
<i>Every time I thought
I'd got it made</i>

812
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:24,642
<i>It seemed the taste
was not so sweet</i>

813
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:26,769
<i>Changes</i>

814
00:57:26,853 --> 00:57:28,438
<i>Turn and face the strange</i>

815
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:31,107
- Shrek?
- <i>Changes</i>

816
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,901
<i>Don't wanna be a richer one</i>

817
00:57:33,985 --> 00:57:36,738
<i>Time may change me</i>

818
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,449
<i>But I can't trace time</i>

819
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,491
Fiona?

820
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,788
Hello, handsome.

821
00:57:47,582 --> 00:57:48,958
Shrek!

822
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:52,378
- Princess!
- Donkey?

823
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:54,630
Wow! That potion
worked on you too?

824
00:57:54,714 --> 00:57:55,965
What potion?

825
00:57:56,049 --> 00:57:59,218
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

826
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:01,512
Now, we're sexy!

827
00:58:02,805 --> 00:58:03,890
Shrek?

828
00:58:08,102 --> 00:58:10,730
For you, baby, I could be.

829
00:58:10,897 --> 00:58:13,149
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

830
00:58:13,274 --> 00:58:15,526
He went inside looking for you.

831
00:58:17,403 --> 00:58:18,404
Shrek?

832
00:58:19,364 --> 00:58:21,991
Fiona! Fiona!

833
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,079
You want to dance, pretty boy?

834
00:58:28,915 --> 00:58:32,585
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

835
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,921
Fiona?

836
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:38,591
Shrek?

837
00:58:38,674 --> 00:58:41,511
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

838
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:43,262
What happened to your voice?

839
00:58:43,346 --> 00:58:47,475
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

840
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:50,186
But not the way I feel about you.

841
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:51,729
Fiona?

842
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,483
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

843
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:59,404
Dad. I was so hoping
you'd approve.

844
00:58:59,862 --> 00:59:03,074
- Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

845
00:59:03,157 --> 00:59:06,577
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

846
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,163
but, well, what do you think?

847
00:59:13,418 --> 00:59:16,087
Fiona! Fiona!

848
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:19,424
Fiona!

849
00:59:19,507 --> 00:59:22,990
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona!

850
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:27,098
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

851
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:33,104
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

852
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,065
I just wanted her to be happy.

853
00:59:36,149 --> 00:59:38,443
And now she can be.

854
00:59:38,526 --> 00:59:40,528
Oh, sweetheart.

855
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:44,449
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

856
00:59:44,532 --> 00:59:48,578
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.

857
00:59:48,661 --> 00:59:51,956
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

858
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:56,210
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

859
00:59:56,294 --> 01:00:00,298
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

860
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,557
But...

861
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,142
I love her.

862
01:00:11,225 --> 01:00:14,061
If you really love her...

863
01:00:14,145 --> 01:00:16,189
you'll let her go.

864
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,111
Shrek?

865
01:00:22,195 --> 01:00:23,279
Señor.

866
01:00:23,362 --> 01:00:26,365
What's going on?
Where are you going?

867
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:37,001
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

868
01:00:42,215 --> 01:00:45,301
<i>People just ain't no good</i>

869
01:00:48,054 --> 01:00:51,474
<i>I think that's well understood</i>

870
01:00:51,516 --> 01:00:53,184
There you go, boys.

871
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:55,228
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

872
01:00:55,311 --> 01:00:57,688
Hey. Why the long face?

873
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:01,317
It was all just a stupid mistake.

874
01:01:02,235 --> 01:01:06,072
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

875
01:01:08,282 --> 01:01:10,201
I hate Mondays.

876
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:13,913
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

877
01:01:13,996 --> 01:01:15,581
What choice do I have?

878
01:01:15,665 --> 01:01:19,126
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

879
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,295
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

880
01:01:21,379 --> 01:01:23,839
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

881
01:01:23,923 --> 01:01:27,134
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

882
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:29,804
- Oh, he sounds dreamy.
- You know...

883
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:33,224
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

884
01:01:36,018 --> 01:01:40,022
Look, guys.
It's for the best.

885
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:41,482
Mom and Dad approve,

886
01:01:41,566 --> 01:01:44,902
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

887
01:01:44,986 --> 01:01:46,862
Everybody wins.

888
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:49,156
Except for you.

889
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,535
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

890
01:01:54,954 --> 01:01:57,540
And that's why
I have to let her go.

891
01:01:58,332 --> 01:02:01,377
Excuse me, is she here?

892
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,629
She's in the back.

893
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:06,716
Oh, hello again.

894
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,055
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

895
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:17,476
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

896
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:23,357
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really
warming up to Prince Charming.

897
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:26,944
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

898
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:28,904
I mean,
how charming can I be

899
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:31,365
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

900
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:33,492
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

901
01:02:33,576 --> 01:02:36,954
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

902
01:02:36,996 --> 01:02:41,334
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

903
01:02:41,417 --> 01:02:44,629
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!

904
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:49,133
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall
in love with the first man she kisses,

905
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:51,135
which will be Charming.

906
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,264
- No.
- What did you say?

907
01:02:55,348 --> 01:02:57,725
I can't. I won't do it.

908
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:59,393
Oh, yes, you will.

909
01:02:59,477 --> 01:03:03,064
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

910
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:06,692
And I can take it away
just as easily.

911
01:03:06,776 --> 01:03:09,987
Is that what you want? Is it?

912
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:13,449
- No.
- Good boy.

913
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:15,284
Now, we have to go.

914
01:03:15,368 --> 01:03:17,620
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

915
01:03:17,662 --> 01:03:19,955
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

916
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:22,833
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

917
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:24,585
Thank you, Mother.

918
01:03:24,669 --> 01:03:26,504
Mother?

919
01:03:26,545 --> 01:03:29,715
Mary! A talking horse!

920
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:30,800
The ogre!

921
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:36,681
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

922
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:41,310
The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus

923
01:03:41,394 --> 01:03:44,772
here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!

924
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:47,942
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

925
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:49,777
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

926
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,821
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

927
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:54,407
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

928
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:57,493
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

929
01:03:57,576 --> 01:03:58,953
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

930
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,664
What the heck are the crumbs for?

931
01:04:01,706 --> 01:04:04,792
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

932
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,545
Oh, aren't they adorable!

933
01:04:07,586 --> 01:04:10,715
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

934
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:12,717
Tired old thing.

935
01:04:13,509 --> 01:04:16,387
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

936
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:19,598
It's the one, it's the only...

937
01:04:19,682 --> 01:04:22,268
It's the Fairy Godmother!

938
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:25,563
Hello, Far, Far Away!

939
01:04:26,772 --> 01:04:28,899
Can I get a whoop whoop?

940
01:04:30,234 --> 01:04:33,654
May all your endings be happy
and...

941
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:36,824
Well, you know the rest!

942
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:39,869
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

943
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:41,871
after these messages.

944
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:43,539
I hate these ball shows.

945
01:04:43,706 --> 01:04:46,792
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel of Torture!

946
01:04:46,876 --> 01:04:50,504
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

947
01:04:50,588 --> 01:04:53,257
Whizzes on you guys.

948
01:04:53,299 --> 01:04:55,426
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

949
01:04:55,509 --> 01:04:57,762
No, to your left. Your left!

950
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:03,976
- Tonight on Knights...
- Now here's a good show!

951
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:07,480
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

952
01:05:07,563 --> 01:05:09,648
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

953
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:12,443
their devil may mare attitudes
just won't fly.

954
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:17,615
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

955
01:05:18,783 --> 01:05:20,826
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

956
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,711
We warned you!

957
01:05:23,037 --> 01:05:25,498
Did someone let the cat
out of the bag?

958
01:05:25,581 --> 01:05:27,583
You capitalist pig dogs!

959
01:05:33,088 --> 01:05:34,757
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

960
01:05:35,841 --> 01:05:37,927
Find Princess Fiona!

961
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:39,678
I'm a donkey!

962
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:42,431
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!

963
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,059
Quick! Rewind it!

964
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,562
I'm her husband, Shrek!

965
01:06:16,465 --> 01:06:17,466
Darling?

966
01:06:18,509 --> 01:06:20,469
I thought I might
find you here.

967
01:06:20,511 --> 01:06:24,139
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

968
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:26,684
I'm not going.

969
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:29,812
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

970
01:06:29,854 --> 01:06:33,816
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

971
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:36,694
I mean, look at him.

972
01:06:38,988 --> 01:06:40,489
Yes, he is a bit different,

973
01:06:40,531 --> 01:06:43,617
but people change
for the ones they love.

974
01:06:43,701 --> 01:06:46,912
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

975
01:06:46,996 --> 01:06:48,747
Change?

976
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:51,041
He's completely lost his mind!

977
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:54,670
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

978
01:06:54,712 --> 01:06:57,631
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

979
01:06:57,715 --> 01:07:00,968
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

980
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:04,096
I'd give anything to have him back.

981
01:07:07,308 --> 01:07:10,352
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

982
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:12,396
Otherwise I'm up all night.

983
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,946
Thanks.

984
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:24,909
I got to get out of here!

985
01:07:24,992 --> 01:07:27,661
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

986
01:07:27,745 --> 01:07:29,204
What about my Miranda rights?

987
01:07:29,288 --> 01:07:32,082
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.

988
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:34,376
Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!

989
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:37,004
You have the right to remain silent.

990
01:07:37,129 --> 01:07:39,673
What you lack is the capacity.

991
01:07:39,757 --> 01:07:43,260
I must hold on before I, too,
go totally mad.

992
01:07:43,344 --> 01:07:45,638
Shrek? Donkey?

993
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:48,098
Too late.

994
01:07:48,223 --> 01:07:51,435
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!

995
01:07:57,024 --> 01:07:58,859
Fire in ze hole!

996
01:08:17,711 --> 01:08:19,004
Look out below!

997
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,467
Quick! Tell a lie!

998
01:08:23,509 --> 01:08:26,261
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!

999
01:08:26,387 --> 01:08:29,390
Say something crazy like
I'm wearing ladies' underwear!

1000
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:31,558
I am wearing ladies' underwear.

1001
01:08:35,396 --> 01:08:38,023
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!

1002
01:08:38,983 --> 01:08:41,318
It looks like you
most certainly am are!

1003
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,945
- I am not!
- What kind?

1004
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:45,614
- It's a thong!
- They're briefs!

1005
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:47,074
- Are not.
- Are too!

1006
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:48,867
- Are not!
- Are too!

1007
01:08:48,951 --> 01:08:50,661
Here we go. Hang tight.

1008
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:57,126
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, hey, hey!

1009
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:03,507
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

1010
01:09:03,549 --> 01:09:05,718
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

1011
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:07,720
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!

1012
01:09:07,803 --> 01:09:09,638
We've got to stop that kiss!

1013
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,557
I thought you was going
to let her go.

1014
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,934
I was, but I can't let them
do this to Fiona.

1015
01:09:14,018 --> 01:09:17,229
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

1016
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:19,106
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.

1017
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,151
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!

1018
01:09:22,234 --> 01:09:28,115
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

1019
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:36,206
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

1020
01:09:36,248 --> 01:09:39,752
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

1021
01:09:39,835 --> 01:09:42,296
Because we're gonna need flour.

1022
01:09:42,379 --> 01:09:45,424
Lots and lots of flour.

1023
01:09:47,718 --> 01:09:50,220
Gingy!

1024
01:09:50,262 --> 01:09:54,683
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

1025
01:09:58,687 --> 01:10:00,647
It's alive!

1026
01:10:08,822 --> 01:10:12,659
Run, run, run,
as fast you can!

1027
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:22,002
Go, baby, go!

1028
01:10:23,504 --> 01:10:26,465
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

1029
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:30,928
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

1030
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:41,438
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

1031
01:10:43,023 --> 01:10:45,400
That's right!
Follow the pretty pony!

1032
01:10:45,526 --> 01:10:47,986
Pretty pony wants to play
at the castle!

1033
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:49,738
Pretty pony.

1034
01:10:51,406 --> 01:10:53,325
Ladies and gentlemen.

1035
01:10:53,408 --> 01:10:58,163
Presenting Princess Fiona
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

1036
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:02,793
Shrek, what are you doing?

1037
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:06,088
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

1038
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,048
Is that glitter on your lips?

1039
01:11:08,132 --> 01:11:11,051
Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?

1040
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:14,972
- What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

1041
01:11:17,891 --> 01:11:20,144
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

1042
01:11:21,228 --> 01:11:22,688
Ladies and gentlemen.

1043
01:11:25,274 --> 01:11:28,193
I'd like to dedicate this song to...

1044
01:11:28,277 --> 01:11:31,738
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

1045
01:11:32,739 --> 01:11:34,491
Fiona, my Princess.

1046
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:37,119
Will you honor me with a dance?

1047
01:11:37,703 --> 01:11:42,249
<i>Where have all the good men gone</i>

1048
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:45,169
<i>And where are all the gods?</i>

1049
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:46,378
Dance!

1050
01:11:46,461 --> 01:11:50,174
<i>Where's the streetwise Hercules</i>

1051
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,927
<i>To fight the rising odds?</i>

1052
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:58,557
Since when do you dance?

1053
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,518
Fiona, my dearest,
if there's one thing I know,

1054
01:12:01,602 --> 01:12:04,897
it's that love is full of surprises.

1055
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,524
<i>Late at night I toss and I turn</i>

1056
01:12:07,608 --> 01:12:12,154
<i>And I dream of what I need</i>

1057
01:12:14,865 --> 01:12:16,366
Hit it!

1058
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:20,787
<i>I need a hero</i>

1059
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:24,917
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

1060
01:12:26,335 --> 01:12:28,086
Man the catapults!

1061
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:30,881
Aim! Fire!

1062
01:12:32,007 --> 01:12:35,177
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!

1063
01:12:42,476 --> 01:12:44,728
Not the gumdrop button!

1064
01:12:51,151 --> 01:12:52,945
Incoming!

1065
01:12:54,384 --> 01:12:55,656
All right!

1066
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:04,331
<i>Somewhere after midnight
in my wildest fantasy</i>

1067
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:06,083
Go, Mongo! Go!

1068
01:13:09,711 --> 01:13:11,922
Man the cauldrons!

1069
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,762
After you, Mongo.

1070
01:13:21,473 --> 01:13:25,769
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!

1071
01:13:28,563 --> 01:13:29,856
Shrek!

1072
01:13:33,735 --> 01:13:35,529
More heat, less foam!

1073
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:38,407
<i>Up where the mountains
meet the heavens above</i>

1074
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:41,451
<i>Out where the lightning
splits the sea</i>

1075
01:13:41,493 --> 01:13:46,331
<i>I could swear there is someone
somewhere watching me</i>

1076
01:13:46,456 --> 01:13:49,084
Heave! Ho!

1077
01:13:54,923 --> 01:13:57,759
No...!

1078
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:28,749
Come on!

1079
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,126
Look out!

1080
01:14:31,209 --> 01:14:34,921
Be good.

1081
01:14:36,256 --> 01:14:38,759
He needs me!
Let me go!

1082
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:43,805
Donkey!

1083
01:14:53,065 --> 01:14:54,524
Puss!

1084
01:14:57,527 --> 01:15:00,030
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

1085
01:15:02,824 --> 01:15:05,285
Today, I repay my debt.

1086
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:15,837
On guard!

1087
01:15:19,132 --> 01:15:22,177
<i>He's gotta be strong
and he's gotta be fast</i>

1088
01:15:22,302 --> 01:15:25,806
<i>And he's gotta be fresh
from the fight</i>

1089
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:28,767
- <i>I need a hero</i>
- Stop!

1090
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:37,859
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?

1091
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:43,323
You couldn't just go back to your swamp
and leave well enough alone.

1092
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:45,659
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

1093
01:15:48,412 --> 01:15:49,955
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

1094
01:15:50,038 --> 01:15:51,790
I see London! I see France!

1095
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,920
I'm a real boy!

1096
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:07,722
Catch!

1097
01:16:09,015 --> 01:16:10,142
Donkey!

1098
01:16:14,396 --> 01:16:15,480
I'm a real boy.

1099
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:22,529
That's mine!

1100
01:16:26,658 --> 01:16:28,243
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

1101
01:16:28,368 --> 01:16:29,953
And Donkey!

1102
01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:32,998
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

1103
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:37,335
No!

1104
01:16:59,107 --> 01:17:01,485
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

1105
01:17:01,568 --> 01:17:05,572
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

1106
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:09,493
Well, I guess I gave her
the wrong tea.

1107
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,995
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

1108
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:15,373
I told you.

1109
01:17:15,457 --> 01:17:19,669
Ogres don't live happily ever after.

1110
01:17:43,193 --> 01:17:45,195
Oh, Dad!

1111
01:17:49,157 --> 01:17:51,034
- Is he...?
- Yup.

1112
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:54,204
He croaked.

1113
01:17:56,373 --> 01:17:57,624
Harold?

1114
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:58,667
Dad?

1115
01:17:59,626 --> 01:18:02,045
I'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

1116
01:18:02,087 --> 01:18:04,381
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!

1117
01:18:04,422 --> 01:18:06,675
No, no, he's right.
I'm sorry.

1118
01:18:07,592 --> 01:18:08,677
To both of you.

1119
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,721
I only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

1120
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:14,975
But I can see now...

1121
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:16,726
she already has it.

1122
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,854
Shrek, Fiona...

1123
01:18:19,938 --> 01:18:24,859
Will you accept
an old frog's apologies...

1124
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:27,737
and my blessing?

1125
01:18:27,779 --> 01:18:30,073
Harold?
I'm sorry, Lillian.

1126
01:18:30,156 --> 01:18:33,702
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

1127
01:18:34,953 --> 01:18:38,123
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

1128
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:40,166
warts and all.

1129
01:18:44,129 --> 01:18:46,464
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

1130
01:18:46,548 --> 01:18:47,674
Midnight!

1131
01:18:48,425 --> 01:18:51,386
Fiona. Is this what you want?

1132
01:18:52,387 --> 01:18:54,431
To be this way forever?

1133
01:18:54,514 --> 01:18:58,226
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

1134
01:18:58,268 --> 01:18:59,978
we can stay like this.

1135
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:03,023
You'd do that?

1136
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:05,066
- For me?
- Yes.

1137
01:19:13,867 --> 01:19:16,703
I want what any princess wants.

1138
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:19,456
To live happily ever after...

1139
01:19:23,585 --> 01:19:26,254
with the ogre I married.

1140
01:19:29,299 --> 01:19:32,302
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!

1141
01:19:32,385 --> 01:19:34,471
You cannot make me cry!

1142
01:19:59,537 --> 01:20:01,873
No. No, no.

1143
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:07,879
Oh, no.

1144
01:20:23,895 --> 01:20:28,775
Hey. You still look like
a noble steed to me.

1145
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:35,615
Now, where were we?

1146
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,034
Oh, I remember.

1147
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:49,170
Hey! Isn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

1148
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,839
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

1149
01:20:58,096 --> 01:20:59,597
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

1150
01:20:59,681 --> 01:21:02,434
<i>She's into superstitions</i>

1151
01:21:02,517 --> 01:21:05,145
<i>Black cats and voodoo dolls</i>

1152
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,897
- Sing it, Puss!
- <i>I feel a premonition</i>

1153
01:21:07,939 --> 01:21:10,400
<i>That girl's gonna make me fall</i>

1154
01:21:11,985 --> 01:21:13,027
Here we go!

1155
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,905
<i>She's into new sensations</i>

1156
01:21:15,947 --> 01:21:18,408
<i>New kicks in the candlelight</i>

1157
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:21,119
<i>She's got a new addiction</i>

1158
01:21:21,202 --> 01:21:23,663
<i>For every day and night</i>

1159
01:21:23,747 --> 01:21:25,957
<i>She'll make you take your clothes off</i>

1160
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,210
<i>And go dancing in the rain</i>

1161
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:31,337
<i>She'll make you live her crazy life</i>

1162
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:33,882
<i>But she'll take away your pain</i>

1163
01:21:33,965 --> 01:21:37,469
<i>Like a bullet to your brain</i>

1164
01:21:37,552 --> 01:21:40,013
<i>Upside inside out</i>

1165
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,390

01:21:44,142 --> 01:21:45,477

<i>And her skin's the color of mocha</i>

1170
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:56,029
<i>She will wear you out</i>

1171
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:58,782

- Say it one more time now!
<i>- Living the vida loca</i>

1174
01:22:09,459 --> 01:22:13,379
Hey, Donkey, that's Spanish!

1175
01:22:13,463 --> 01:22:14,923
<i>She'll push and pull you down</i>

<i>All by myself anymore...</i>

1192
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,838
Amigo, we are off
to the Kit-Kat Club.

1193
01:24:18,922 --> 01:24:20,256

Thanks, compadre.
I'm... I'm not in the mood.

1195
01:24:24,469 --> 01:24:27,889
We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!

1196
01:24:29,557 --> 01:24:30,600
Hey, baby!

1197
01:24:32,769 --> 01:24:36,189
Hey, that's my girl!
Yeah! All right!

1198
01:24:37,148 --> 01:24:38,441
Baby, where you been?

1199
01:24:38,483 --> 01:24:40,777
I'm sorry too.

1200
01:24:40,818 --> 01:24:43,571
I should've stayed.
But Shrek had this thing he had to do.

1201
01:24:43,613 --> 01:24:45,198
What? Say it one more time.

1202
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,909
What you talking about?
Are you serious?

1203
01:24:50,453 --> 01:24:52,288
Papa!

1204
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,297
Look at our little mutant babies!

1205
01:25:03,925 --> 01:25:05,927
I got to get a job.
