1
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,030
Dowd. Now, what do I hate?

2
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,276
Boring places.

3
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,396
And?

4
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,436
Wells that aren't pumping oil.

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,079
So what's happening?

6
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,799
Probably our people being overly cautious.

7
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,916
I'm sure it's nothing.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,956
It better be.

9
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,633
I bet the whole company on this site.

10
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,476
Well, the reserve is several hundred
feet deeper, but we have to pass through

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,120
what appears to be
a large pocket of water to reach it.

12
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
Water? Well, let's keep going.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,070
Is that why you called me down here?

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,199
Discovering water two miles
below the surface

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,112
is important, scientifically.

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Dowd, you're lead scientist here.

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,319
- Do we care about that?
- No.

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,436
If there's a water pocket,

19
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,751
there's a possibility of an ecosystem.
Life.

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,196
Okay. Actually, it's basically impossible.

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,000
The water pressure
at that depth is 10,000 psi.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,151
That water is supersaturated
with nitrogen.

23
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,469
There would be no nutrients for life.

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,358
So we keep going, yes?

25
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,913
Yeah. Punch through.

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,714
Bioluminescence.

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,274
There is life.

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,920
No, that's...

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,233
That's the reflection from our light.

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,633
- What was that?
- Warning.

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,916
The bore into the pocket
destabilized the well.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,434
The pressure's rising way too fast.

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,510
There's something down there.

34
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,275
We have to shut it down. Shut it down!

35
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,712
Something came up.
Something came up through the well!

36
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,915
What is this thing?

37
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,833
He's a real go-getter.

38
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,713
He comes highly recommended.

39
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,200
Mr. Burke!

40
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,360
Do you have this under control?

41
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,716
We got this one.

42
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,593
I have a search party
looking for the other two.

43
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,991
It is very important
that you keep your search discreet.

44
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,199
The Department of Fish and Wildlife
will shut us down

45
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,950
over a horned lizard,
let alone these things.

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,316
Wait. Wait. Wait.
We gotta get somebody to examine it.

47
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,278
We find out what it eats,
and needs to survive.

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,437
It'll help us find the missing ones

49
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,636
and eliminate them.

50
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,629
Also, if there's more where they came
from, we'll know what we're dealing with.

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,552
That is smart. But just you.

52
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,399
Okay. I'm on it.

53
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,712
We are standing on an ocean of oil.

54
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,670
If we keep this quiet,
we will all make out very well.

55
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,950
Okay.

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,630
I'm on it.

57
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,589
Don't let it out of your sight.

58
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,277
Yeah!

59
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,200
So Terravex made
some people rich around here.

60
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,476
Big deal. It doesn't matter.

61
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,836
We're making do.

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,280
You shouldn't cry just 'cause you didn't
get a land lease from an oil company.

63
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,510
Who's crying?

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,353
Wouldn't take money
from Terravex, anyways.

65
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,430
They ruined this town.

66
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,830
You're talking like you're old enough
to remember how it used to be.

67
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,158
It was never anything to shout about.

68
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,794
Dad was still here.

69
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,473
I'm gonna stop at
the Loaf 'N Go on the way home.

70
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,590
You want anything?

71
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,994
Something with four wheels
that'll get me out of this place.

72
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,592
You're so handsome.

73
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,831
Where are all the girls
knocking down your door?

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,398
I'm closing again tonight,
so I won't see you till tomorrow.

75
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,791
Just one frozen pizza.
You save the other one for Rick.

76
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,716
- How you doing?
- Good. Sorry.

78
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,280
- No.
- Okay. Bye.

79
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,350
All right.

80
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,070
Tripp.

81
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,477
She said she's not
going to be home till late.

82
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,678
Yeah? Why would that matter?

83
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,475
You're still going to be here
when I get back?

84
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,994
Don't you worry! I'm not going anywhere.

85
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,757
You enjoy that a little too much.

86
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,240
Where'd this come from?

87
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,436
Pankeska Rock.

88
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,392
Big accident up there at the drill site.

89
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,879
It got late pretty quick.

90
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,680
- Let's strip it tomorrow.
- If I come back.

91
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,320
Don't think you're doing me
a favor being here.

92
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,550
I don't take charity.

93
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,960
Neither do I.

94
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,560
This is a 6.4 liter Hemi V-8.

95
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,275
Probably the only piece worth anything.

96
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,117
Go ahead, it's yours.

97
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,278
If anyone can get it working, you can.

98
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,237
Hey, lock up for me.

99
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,230
Old Hulk ain't what he used to be.

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,311
I got 425 horsepower for you, buddy.

101
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,314
You're not gonna be
the prettiest thing in town,

102
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,279
but you're going to have
the heart of an elephant in you.

103
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,469
Outrun that volcano?
You bet we can, Mr. President.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,832
What are you doing in my truck?

105
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,150
Yeah, I can take you
and your sister to Coachella.

106
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,999
Sisters?

107
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,475
Kill 'em!

108
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,199
Ejector seat engaged.

109
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,709
You're watching KYPN, North Dakota,
your number one source for news.

110
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,714
Local residents were awakened
by a catastrophic accident

111
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,514
at Pankeska Rock,

112
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,798
where Terravex Oil workers
fought a towering fire

113
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,156
whose black smoke
still filled the morning air.

114
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,711
Rigger Wade Coley was on the scene
when the accident happened.

115
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,715
Well, I heard an explosion
and the tower crashed, and...

116
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,076
Dad?

117
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,673
...guys were running and shouting,
and that's really all I'm allowed to say.

118
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,556
Why this shroud of secrecy
and silence by Terravex Oil?

119
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,916
I just do my job.

120
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,434
I really don't know.
I can't answer any more questions.

121
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,715
You're here?

122
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,880
I explained to him
that the number of objects

123
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,395
naturally occurring in
the periodic table of elements...

124
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,119
Tripp! Hey!

125
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,190
Hey.

126
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,757
We were matched up for biology tutoring?

127
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,191
And you haven't showed up
to any of the sessions?

128
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,397
Or maybe you didn't get the schedule?

129
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,915
It was posted in class,
and I emailed you a copy,

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,320
and slid one into your locker.

131
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,030
Yeah. I just haven't checked it yet.

132
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,759
Yeah. I mean, I get it.

133
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,880
I go, like, days sometimes
without checking my email

134
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,474
or going to my locker.

135
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,598
I'm Meredith, by the way.

136
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,312
Right. Yeah, I knew that.

137
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,276
Hey, Tripp!

138
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,870
Hey, Sam. How's the luckiest kid in town?

139
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,758
You know my Dad doesn't
let me drive the merch.

140
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,752
Plus, he's flipping out right now.

141
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,876
What happened?

142
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,155
You want to see something crazy?

143
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,275
See, I'm growing out my hair, like you.

144
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
Hope people don't think we're brothers.

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
We've had trouble before, but usually
it's a rock through the window,

146
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,517
smashed taillight, that kind of thing.

147
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,756
Check it out.

148
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,433
Told you you've never
seen anything like this.

149
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,034
They ripped out the gas tanks.

150
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,191
I mean, who would even do that?

151
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,198
Well, it has to be vandals.
Serious power tools.

152
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,070
Tripp, you know what?

153
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,040
I happen to have the schedule
for our tutoring right here,

154
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,959
and it says our next sessions
are Thursday and Friday.

155
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,030
This Friday.

156
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,192
I have work Friday.

157
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,434
I can come by your work!

158
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,556
See you later, Tripp!

159
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,512
Good to hang out with you, bro.

160
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,717
It's on the far side. Here. Come on.

161
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,997
- Where is it?
- It's in there.

162
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,719
We're gonna need more guys.

163
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,640
What is it? A bear?

164
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,634
No. Just open it up and look.

165
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,640
Grab that.

166
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,311
You're going to need, like,
12 more of those things.

167
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,754
It's in there.

168
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,320
I don't see anything.

169
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,197
What? No, I...

170
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,670
No, no, no. I trapped him in here!
He had...

171
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,071
He was huge. He had tentacles and giant

172
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,400
eyes.

173
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,594
You guys go on ahead. I'll handle this.

174
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,438
Rick, I know what you're thinking,
but you've got to believe me. He...

175
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,112
He sucked all the oil out of the can!

176
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,590
- He sucked it out.
- Are you done?

177
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,194
I knew it.

178
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,512
I knew it as soon as I heard
it was you on the call.

179
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,273
I knew something wasn't gonna go right.

180
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,270
You thought this would be funny, huh?

181
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,440
Pranking me and my guys?
Making me look like an idiot?

182
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,870
I saw it.

183
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,280
Yeah. Well, I hope it was fun.

184
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,271
You're gonna wind up just like your dad
if you don't straighten out.

185
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,193
Don't talk about my dad.

186
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,637
That's it for you. That's it.

187
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,992
I just feel so squeezed in here,
like trapped.

188
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,549
Like, I might die here
if I don't get one of those scholarships,

189
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,393
because we can't afford
an out-of-state school.

190
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,756
But there's no way I can
imagine staying here, either.

191
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,559
I mean, did you see
that thing on the news?

192
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,233
About the burning well?

193
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,515
It's like, nobody cares

194
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,910
about how much damage they're doing
to the environment because

195
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,469
all the money in town
comes from Terravex Oil.

196
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,592
Hey, you know a lot about biology, right?

197
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,831
That's what I'm tutoring you in.

198
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,992
How often do they discover new species?

199
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,435
Seriously?

200
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,273
I was just watching a show on this.

201
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,556
Do you watch Nat Geo?

202
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,630
No.

203
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,517
Well, they said that they discover, like,
15,000 new species every year.

204
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,796
So, would it be possible for there to be,

205
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,032
like, a giant sea creature
here in North Dakota?

206
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,636
Technically, totally.

207
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,360
This whole state was under
an ocean at one point.

208
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,750
So theoretically,

209
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,873
the deep lakes
could have something like that.

210
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,074
I mean on land.
A giant sea creature on land.

211
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,635
Well, no.

212
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,475
Because its body evolved
in a water environment,

213
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,029
so it wouldn't be able to move
with the effects of gravity pulling on it.

214
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,110
Did you want to watch that show?

215
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,873
'Cause I have it on my DVR.

216
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,555
It's 4:00. I'll see you later.

217
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,473
Come on.

218
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,920
Come on.

219
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,360
No, no, no.

220
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,520
Come on.

221
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

222
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,030
Shit.

223
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,276
I'm trying to help you!

224
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,752
Let go of me! I just saved your life!

225
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,277
See? You would have
been flat as a pancake,

226
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,871
you squishy piece of squish!

227
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,592
What are you?

228
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,440
You want the oil?

229
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,760
You promise not to eat me?

230
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,796
Hey! Don't even touch me!

231
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,513
You got to be kidding me.

232
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,310
You better slow down there.

233
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,312
You're getting all jacked up.

234
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,475
What? You don't like that truck?

235
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,676
Okay. Watch this.

236
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,558
See? It can't hurt you.

237
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,040
Can I help you, sir?

238
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,072
Yeah. We're working for Terravex.

239
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,716
We had something crash through
our fences last night.

240
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,118
No one got a good look at it,
but it was big, whatever it was.

241
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,591
You get any reports of anything like that
in the last day?

242
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,315
No, dude, we haven't heard any of that.

243
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,390
Nothing strange?

244
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,550
No calls about seeing
some kind of big animal?

245
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,032
There was the monster in the junkyard.

246
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,640
Or was it a "giant creature"?

247
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,712
Hey! Hey! Guys!

248
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,678
What did I say? Enough about that.

249
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,114
Well, I'd like to hear the story.

250
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,912
Well, there's not much to tell.

251
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,559
It was a false call. That's what it was.

252
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,630
Where from?

253
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,757
It's Weathers' junkyard, off 112.

254
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,270
Hey! We just talked about this.

255
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,239
Look, I don't see why
you're so worked up about a prank call.

256
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,397
I don't see why you are, either.

257
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,189
Quit being a baby.

258
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,592
There we go.

259
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,195
Let's get you to the sheriff's station.

260
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,277
See what Rick has to say now.

261
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,840
What the...

262
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,112
Hey! Get back here!

263
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,800
Hey! Stop!

264
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,673
Stay! Stay put!

265
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,957
Stay put!

266
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,630
Listen...

267
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,633
Nobody's listening to me!

268
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,877
Not so tough, are you now, landsquid?

269
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,833
You are so

270
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,514
smelly.

271
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,150
No. No, no, no.

272
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,870
Hey!

273
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,353
Get back here!

274
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,838
No, no, no.

275
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,471
If you scratch my truck, so help me!

276
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,554
Can I help you?

277
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,480
I understand you had
an incident last night,

278
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,870
but the local authorities
didn't believe you.

279
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,912
Explain why you care?

280
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,712
We're looking for something unusual.

281
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,075
Something dangerous.

282
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,430
What are you looking to do with it?

283
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,879
Make sure it doesn't hurt no one.

284
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,272
I thought I heard something.
I didn't see anything.

285
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,519
Must have been a coyote,
or something like that.

286
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,273
Did this coyote come back?

287
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,550
No.

288
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,911
- Mind if we take a look?
- Yes, actually.

289
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,955
Because it's private property
and you're not allowed to go in there,

290
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,400
but go ahead and look around,
if you want to.

291
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,755
I can make an exception this time.

292
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,914
You know, the coyote that I saw...
I heard, was...

293
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,911
I think it came from that side of the yard.

294
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,634
For sure, actually.

295
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,076
From that side of the yard?

296
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,990
Yeah.

297
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,600
Stop it! Stop it!

298
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,792
Will you stop?

299
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,033
Search the whole place.

300
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,710
The battery's dead.

301
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,995
I'm going to push it over
to the other garage.

302
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,356
You guys just keep looking around.

303
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,070
Hey!

304
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,997
Give me back my truck!

305
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,350
Hey!

306
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,676
Give me back my truck!

307
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,155
Tripp?

308
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,471
I made flash cards!

309
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,190
Meredith?

310
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,910
What are you...

311
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,199
Look, seriously, now is a really bad time.

312
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,990
Okay.

313
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,879
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?

314
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,996
I don't live too far away.

315
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,595
But it was kind of a scary walk
in the dark.

316
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,549
I don't have a car.

317
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,595
It doesn't run.

318
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,354
It's not...

319
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,351
Can you just go home?

320
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,630
Please.

321
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,749
It's kind of rude of you
not to give me a ride home.

322
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,230
I came all the way over here
on Friday night

323
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,118
to help you study,

324
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,714
and you're just sending me away?

325
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,951
How would you feel if I got
abducted on my way home?

326
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,760
Who's gonna abduct you?

327
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,520
It's not what I mean.

328
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,792
It just... It doesn't happen out here.

329
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,510
What was that?

330
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,676
I heard it, too.

331
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,110
Hey, kid!

332
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,556
You should probably put that in park.

333
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,032
Hey! Why don't you just get in the truck?

334
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,396
- Really?
- Yeah. Just get in.

335
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,395
Listen, there's something going on here.

336
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,156
Really?

337
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,470
Yeah, something crazy.

338
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,711
And I don't even know
how to begin to explain it.

339
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,792
You don't have to. I mean...

340
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,833
I feel it, too.

341
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,994
No.

342
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,275
There's...

343
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,755
Just go if you're going to go!

344
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,270
Go!

345
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,830
That kid knows something.

346
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,432
You know, I can drive manual
if you don't know how.

347
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,920
Okay. Well, at the end of the hill,
turn right.

348
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,238
Right! I said right!

349
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,310
I'm trying!

350
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,112
- Stop the car!
- I can't! Nothing's working.

351
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,357
- Put your hands on the wheel!
- I...

352
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,635
- This isn't doing anything!
- Yeah. I know!

353
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,834
Tree, tree, tree!

354
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,393
There's a paved road
that goes to my house.

355
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,956
Do you even have your license?

356
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,314
Did you just steal this?
Did we just steal this?

357
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,791
Okay, get out!

358
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,314
You hear me?

359
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,670
Get out!

360
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,276
You were the one
who pushed me into your truck!

361
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,432
Give me my truck back!

362
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,599
Who are you talking to?

363
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,110
That!

364
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,590
Was that a snake?

365
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,153
Tripp, what is that?

366
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,638
Take a look and see.

367
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,717
Take a look?

368
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,674
He won't hurt you.

369
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,790
What!

370
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,876
Oh, my gosh. What is that?

371
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,430
Tripp!

372
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,273
Fine, just keep the truck!

373
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,315
You said you live close, right? Let's go.

374
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,390
Are you just gonna...

375
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,517
I mean, seriously, Tripp, what...

376
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,637
It's moving the truck.

377
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,950
Okay.

378
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,030
My dad barely comes in here,

379
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,713
so you should be fine for the night.

380
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,316
Think he'd mind if
I borrowed some of this stuff?

381
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,559
I'll pay him back.

382
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,799
I doubt he'd even notice. But for what?

383
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,152
So I can pry Creature here
out of my truck.

384
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,640
Good luck with that.

385
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,915
Yeah. My curfew is in, like,
two minutes, so...

386
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,074
Thank you for the incredibly weird night!

387
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,752
Please don't let it near my horse.

388
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,750
Okay.

389
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,676
Hey, hey, hey!

390
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,274
Sit still, would you?

391
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,955
Hey!

392
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,792
Now, it's not just this one pocket
that's blocking our oil.

393
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,871
It is a massive, interconnected ecosystem,

394
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,394
untouched for millions of years.

395
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,800
I mean, it's basically a certainty that
there are more of those things down there.

396
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,390
Prehistoric amphibians,
that can breathe water or air,

397
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,119
living in a network
of underground lakes and caves.

398
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,840
It's like the Loch Ness Monster
isn't a myth after all.

399
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,480
Can we access it?

400
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,916
Well, there's a crater lake
on the surface,

401
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,152
and, yeah, the vents that feed the lake
lead directly down there.

402
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,390
Could we get equipment there?

403
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,516
Well, it was a pretty rough drive
in my Jeep.

404
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,957
There's a good dirt road
after the strip mine,

405
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,077
but after that it's all off-road.

406
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,080
Good job.

407
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,756
What about our POWs?

408
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,040
Well, we're still working on it,

409
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,836
but if that third one
is alive out there somewhere,

410
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,274
we'll find it.

411
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,511
Stop! Stop. Give me some space.

412
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,272
- Morning.
- Morning.

413
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,957
So, instead of getting him out of there,
you built more stuff to keep him in.

414
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,191
This thing is kind of awesome.

415
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,351
Like, strong and smart. Really smart.

416
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,557
He can learn anything, fast.

417
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,036
And I gave him a name.
Isn't that right, Creech?

418
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,155
You named him Creech?

419
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,519
He's got these hair-Iike things
on its tentacles.

420
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,594
Cilia, right?

421
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,789
They can generate
a massive amount of torque,

422
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,952
especially once I scored the axles
to make more surface area to grip.

423
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,116
And that's at each tire.

424
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,431
So, imagine the angular velocity when it's
not all spread out from one differential.

425
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,280
You're not dumb.

426
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,590
What?

427
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,990
Nothing.

428
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,630
So...

429
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,558
I press the gas,

430
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,674
the throttle wire pulls these levers,
which open these blinders.

431
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,592
Right? Right?

432
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,070
It's like

433
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,277
the truck's a wheelchair for it.

434
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,271
No. It's like...

435
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,752
It is an engine for my truck.

436
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,350
Watch.

437
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,034
Yes! Yes! Yes!

438
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,314
Did you see that?

439
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,474
Okay.

440
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,790
Hey!

441
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,799
See, it's not so hard.

442
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,800
Okay.

443
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,550
Come on.

444
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,920
You got it!

445
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,830
Show-off!

446
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,270
No way!

447
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,234
Lift this up, would you?

448
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,314
Stop.

449
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,230
But this thing is important, right?

450
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,080
Shouldn't we tell somebody?

451
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,391
You think he'll be better off
with somebody poking at him,

452
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,470
trying to figure out what he is?

453
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,434
First of all, how do you
know that it's a "he"?

454
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,832
And secondly,
as a Youth for Animal Rights activist,

455
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,992
I feel responsible
for the well-being of that animal.

456
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,918
He's fine. He's happy.

457
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,470
Hey!

458
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,520
Hey, stop!

459
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,115
I'm just saying, he came from somewhere.

460
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,270
He has a home.

461
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,192
Don't you think he wants to go back there?

462
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,795
Sure, but he's safe in here
in the meantime.

463
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,633
Besides, he's having fun.

464
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,953
He's like a kid with his first tricycle.

465
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,279
I'm going to see my dad at Pankeska.

466
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,394
Was he at Pankeska Rock
when that accident happened?

467
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,270
Yeah.

468
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,755
I'm coming with you.

469
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,156
Okay, Creech, let's get you fed.

470
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,320
I'll get you back.

471
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,150
Great.

472
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,870
Hey.

473
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,870
Hey.

474
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,034
I like your truck.

475
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,360
What is this?

476
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,512
You know what this looks like?

477
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,112
This looks like if a garbage
truck took a dump.

478
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,036
And not like a normal dump.
Like a really bad one.

479
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,714
That's what this looks like.

480
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,712
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

481
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,830
Ouch.

482
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,750
That sound weird to you?

483
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,312
How is a monster living
in the hood of your car

484
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,390
supposed to sound?

485
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,434
He's probably fine.

486
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,353
Okay. Why is he moving like this?

487
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,034
I don't know. He's hyper.

488
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,554
Why would he be hyper all of a sudden?

489
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,752
It's what he ate.
Gasoline is oil, but with...

490
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,440
Added chemicals!

491
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,196
What the...

492
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,715
Okay. I think now is
a good time to take charge.

493
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,194
Let go! I can see better than you.

494
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,239
Hey, what are you doing?
Get back in there!

495
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,990
Tripp! Tripp! Watch out!

496
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,520
Oh, no. What are you doing?

497
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,637
No, no, no!

498
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,510
Get back in there! I'm driving!

499
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,679
I said, let go!

500
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,871
Oh, gosh, I touched his eye!

501
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,710
No, no, no.

502
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,833
Watch me unload this lemon
on Old Man Overalls here.

503
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,955
No! No! No!

504
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,640
Okay. Right!

505
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,750
Sorry.

506
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,873
Okay, new rule,

507
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,553
no feeding Creature gasoline.

508
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,352
So, you don't like
the bacteria cultures, huh?

509
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,032
How about nematodes?

510
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,113
Don't like those, either.

511
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,635
Well...

512
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,875
You must eat something out there
under those oil beds.

513
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,150
Hi.

514
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,190
Dad?

515
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,274
Hey, Dad.

516
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,280
It's Tripp.

517
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,189
Tripp.

518
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,434
Well, it sure is. Look at you.

519
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,351
Don't want to get my grime all over you.

520
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,430
Right.

521
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,430
This yours?

522
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,830
Yeah.

523
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,560
The truck, not the girl.
I figured the girl's yours.

524
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,270
No. Not really. Hi. I'm Meredith.

525
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,109
Wade.

526
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,160
This is something.

527
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,960
This is solid.

528
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,870
This is solid work.

529
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,630
Yeah. Thanks.

530
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,480
Come on up.

531
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,472
Why don't you park it at my trailer?

532
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,836
I'm just gonna call my guys,
tell them I won't be at the bar.

533
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,910
Yeah.

534
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,993
It's small, but it's a roof and a bed.

535
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,039
It's only temporary for work, right?

536
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,715
I mean, you have
a permanent place somewhere?

537
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,153
Yeah, well, this does the job.

538
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,278
I'm not inside much, anyway.

539
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,716
They got us working 12-hour shifts.

540
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,154
Were you working
when that accident happened?

541
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,150
Yeah.

542
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,000
There's all these rumors
I read online about it.

543
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,275
What happened?

544
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,477
This stays in here, all right?

545
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,596
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

546
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,037
They drug something
out of the ground that night.

547
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,877
Pushed so far down,

548
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,436
it was like the earth got mad
and let something bad out.

549
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,074
But they say it was a pocket of gas,

550
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,800
so I guess it was a pocket of gas, huh?

551
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,870
Yeah.

552
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,470
What do I know?

553
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,396
Right?

554
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,872
I left something on the bus.

555
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,473
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.

556
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,789
We'll have some wings.

557
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,918
Well, at least we know
where that thing came from.

558
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,474
Those guys the other night
must have been from Terravex.

559
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,156
They don't want
anyone to know about the creature.

560
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,674
Well, they wouldn't be able to drill

561
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,794
if there was some
new species living on top of the oil.

562
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,875
I'm gonna go check on him.

563
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,759
Probably not good to leave him alone long.

564
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,070
Dad?

565
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,230
These men want to have
a word with you, Tripp.

566
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,476
They want their truck back.

567
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,832
Their truck? I built that!

568
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,912
Look. Your mother called me last night.

569
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,434
She saw me on TV,

570
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,194
thought you'd maybe come
up here and try to find me.

571
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,112
You sold me out. To them.

572
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,350
I'm not selling you out to no one.

573
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,635
I just wanna do what's best.

574
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,194
For who?

575
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,431
- We just want to talk to you, son.
- Watch it!

576
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,115
- I'm not going anywhere with you!
- Yes, you are.

577
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,236
Just listen to him, Tripp.

578
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,800
You're not the police.

579
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,200
You don't have the right to take him.

580
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,954
This is private property.
Our private property.

581
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,520
Get off of me!

582
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,110
Get in the truck. Get in the truck.

583
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,314
I'll hurt you, kid.

584
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,155
I will.

585
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,754
It's the truck! That thing is in the truck!

586
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,437
Yeah, I'm just pulling in now.

587
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,318
Listen, I don't want you to worry, okay?

588
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,392
If he's here,
I'll have him home by dinner.

589
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,717
Move over! I'm driving!

590
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,200
Really?

591
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,760
I gotta go.

592
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,035
Tripp?

593
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,430
Yes!

594
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,870
Tripp!

595
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,316
What the heck is going on here?

596
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,079
Big truck, big truck, big truck!

597
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,430
Tripp.

598
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,234
No. I'm not stopping
and I'm not giving up the truck.

599
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,232
No. Go faster!

600
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,670
Okay. We got him.

601
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,515
Fan out. Cut him off.
Don't let him out of town.

602
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,236
- We're not gonna fit.
- I think we can do it.

603
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,510
It worked!

604
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,000
Move! Go!

605
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,235
What?

606
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,874
Did you train him to do this?

607
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,870
Yes.

608
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,551
I have no idea how he learned this.

609
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,951
- Did that just happen?
- Yeah, it did!

610
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,400
Wall!

611
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,920
Watch this.

612
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,235
We're driving on a roof.

613
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,437
Get out of our way, pigeons!

614
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,400
Did you see that?

615
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,110
Hang on!

616
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,270
No way.

617
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,477
I want to stay on the roof now!

618
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,672
Did you hear that? The train.

619
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,155
So what?

620
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,470
That thing is five miles long.

621
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,633
If we can put that in between us and
them, we'll get a 10 minute head start.

622
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,952
How about a plan B?

623
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,633
No time for a plan B.

624
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,196
Besides, I think we lost them.

625
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,430
Tripp, I don't think
we're going to make it.

626
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,590
We'll make it!

627
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,232
We're not going fast enough!

628
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,190
Slow down!

629
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,510
Brakes!

630
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,030
Tripp!

631
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,436
Yeah! Way to go, Creech!

632
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,995
Hey! What are you doing,
chasing that boy all over my county?

633
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,400
It's a private company security matter!

634
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,994
You're putting lives in danger.

635
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,514
You're interfering with law enforcement!

636
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,513
The company I'm working for
employs everyone in this town,

637
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,478
and that includes you!

638
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,075
When's the next election, Sheriff?

639
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,710
Go back to writing tickets
and shooing cows off the road.

640
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,271
You really saved me back there.

641
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,432
Thanks, you big, ugly, beautiful blob.

642
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,036
My dad only uses this
during hunting season, so...

643
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,110
You said there was oil?

644
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,270
Yeah.

645
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,876
But it's for the generator,
so we won't have electricity.

646
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,430
That's okay. He deserves it.

647
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,634
It's nicer out here.

648
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,713
Yeah, I don't mind.

649
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,520
Are you scared of fire?

650
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,711
I would be, too, if I drank oil.

651
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,471
Tripp, I'm sorry about your dad.

652
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,440
It would have been a lousy
place to stay, anyways.

653
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,075
I mean,

654
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,395
how weird would it have been if he'd
turned out to be a decent guy, right?

655
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,755
What would that have been like?

656
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,912
You wouldn't be who you are.

657
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,597
And there's no one like you at our school.

658
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,833
Or in our town.

659
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,070
So,

660
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,196
that's something
to thank your dad for, at least.

661
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,320
God!

662
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,000
Where are you going?

663
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,596
Hey, hey.

664
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,000
Hey. What are you doing?

665
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,110
Hey.

666
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,270
No.

667
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,753
I'm going to get you home.

668
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,913
I promise you that.

669
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,674
Thank you.

670
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,240
I love you, too.

671
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,072
Ready? Watch.

672
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,033
You could teach a mouse how to do that.

673
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,035
That's not the amazing part.
This is the amazing part.

674
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,949
I didn't teach that one
to do that for the oil.

675
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,233
I taught that one
how to do that for the oil.

676
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,634
They have hive intelligence,
like ants or bees.

677
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,995
When they're in close proximity,

678
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,710
one of them knows what the other
knows, almost immediately.

679
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,278
And they metabolize oil
like a combustion engine.

680
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,672
Dowd, what are you doing?

681
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,751
I'm a scientist.

682
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,513
- I'm being a scientist.
- No.

683
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,196
You are falling in love.

684
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,511
This is some sort of Stockholm syndrome.

685
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,680
That's backwards.

686
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,990
- Whatever.
- Okay.

687
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,676
Look, in two days,
our wastewater goes to Ohio.

688
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,911
The mucous twins go with.

689
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,352
Going to shoot it down deep
into an injection well.

690
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,350
No trace.

691
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,830
No. They're not like
mindless ground slugs.

692
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,510
They have intelligence, they show emotion.

693
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,272
It would be unethical to kill them.

694
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,590
Unethical?

695
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,715
Dowd, you and I have been
together a long time.

696
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,275
I have seen you stretch the truth,

697
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,875
falsify environmental protection reports,

698
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,873
and lie to the media.

699
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,553
We are in this together.

700
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,353
Cheer up.

701
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,396
And keep those things quiet!

702
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,753
Tripp. Tripp!

703
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,231
- What are you doing?
- He's gone.

704
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,080
Creech!

705
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,839
Why would he leave?

706
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,193
I don't know,
but we better find him before they do.

707
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,477
Yeah, well, he took off
with my cell phone,

708
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,950
so I can't even call anybody
to come pick us up.

709
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,873
It's okay. I have mine.

710
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,033
Wait, your cell phone's in the truck?

711
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,110
Yeah.

712
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,035
I have an app. We can track him.

713
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,394
There he is.

714
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,474
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

715
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,632
It's here. Stop, stop here.

716
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,313
Wait. Terravex?

717
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,234
Are you sure this is far enough?

718
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,119
Would you mind dropping us off
at the end of the block?

719
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,430
He's not there.

720
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,512
Maybe he went inside.

721
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,070
What is that?

722
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,594
I don't know.

723
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,432
He came here for them.

724
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,999
That's why he left.

725
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,114
No, don't! Don't!

726
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,271
Hey, guys, check on warehouse three.

727
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,954
No! Stop! Stop!

728
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,080
Slow it down. Tranquilize it!

729
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,150
No!

730
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,712
- Hey! Stop.
- Shoot it!

731
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,790
Stop!

732
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,473
Stop! You're killing him!

733
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,314
Scrape it up.

734
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,720
Bring them with me.

735
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,675
Well, you certainly love your cats.

736
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,513
It's all cats.

737
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,512
Oh! Here we go.

738
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,514
Delete. Delete. Delete.

739
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,840
Delete.

740
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,510
Thank you.

741
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,036
You can't just delete pictures
and think this goes away.

742
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,112
Why? What are you going to do?

743
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,350
Go to the police and tell them

744
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,875
that there are monsters
coming up out of the oil fields?

745
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,589
How'd that work out for you last time?

746
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,350
Look.

747
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,716
Hurting people, is not my thing.

748
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,360
It's his.

749
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,874
Mr. Burke,

750
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,032
show these two the highway.

751
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,880
Let's go!

752
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,109
To your left.

753
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,631
Okay! I'll take them from here.
Thanks, Charlie.

754
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,313
Tenneson's orders. So, it all checks out.

755
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,390
Just keep walking normally.

756
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,551
Get your hands off us, slimebag.

757
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,996
Okay, it's not slime, it's sweat.
I sweat when I'm nervous.

758
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,311
Thanks for calling attention to it. Look.

759
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,153
- I'm on your side.
- What?

760
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,560
Spiritually.

761
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,400
Okay, I'm messing this up.

762
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,551
Sorry. I'm a scientist, a geologist.

763
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,400
But I want to help you.

764
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,390
Why?

765
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,559
Because I can't just stand here
and watch them die.

766
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,072
And why should we trust you?

767
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,476
Because these creatures are special.

768
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,358
I think that you've seen that, too.

769
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,590
Now,

770
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,911
I've done some bad things
for this company. But this...

771
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,317
No way. Okay?

772
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,596
I'm done doing their dirty work.

773
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,593
Okay, then help us get them out of here.

774
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,670
We need to get them home.

775
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,910
It's not that simple.

776
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,316
Okay. It's 50 miles of rough terrain
back to the vent.

777
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,359
Any truck big enough to carry them
would be too slow and we'd get caught.

778
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,512
I got a truck fast enough.
We just gotta find two more.

779
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,794
If you think we can do this, I'm in.

780
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,110
We can.

781
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,470
Okay, hands in.

782
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm sorry. You're just so sweaty.

783
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,552
Mr. Weathers,

784
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,872
there's a lot of really weird stuff
going on right now and I need your help.

785
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,474
What do you need?

786
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,519
I need trucks.

787
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,000
Do you have any on your repo list?

788
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,393
It's not our fault rich boy
can't make his payments.

789
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,470
Yeah!

790
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,671
Show me something! Come on!

791
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,513
Yeah! Keep tagging him!

792
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,837
I don't see anything on this that will carry
that big sucker I saw in the warehouse.

793
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,151
What are you gonna need
to do to these trucks?

794
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,230
Well,

795
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,874
lift the engine, raise the suspension,

796
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,874
cut up the body, customize the axles,

797
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,874
and maximize the airflow.
All by morning. Twice.

798
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,557
Maybe we'd get one done, but two?

799
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,951
I don't have the tools or the parts
to get it done that quick.

800
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,913
Do you know someone with a repair shop?

801
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,232
- Or...
- A dealership.

802
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,472
You know, you're going to have to, like,
hang out with him and stuff after this.

803
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,920
Maybe once.

804
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,560
You'll be out by 7:00, right?

805
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,075
The first workers get here at 7:00.

806
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,669
Yeah.

807
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,353
What's the best truck you got on the lot?

808
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,674
Well, it's supposed to be
my 16th birthday present.

809
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,593
No harm getting an early peek, right?

810
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,590
Can you handle one of these?

811
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,430
Yeah.

812
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,112
Be careful, it'll run away from you.

813
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,710
Here you go. Drink up.

814
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,792
We're going on a little road trip.

815
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,993
Hey, man, you mind
helping me out with this?

816
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,878
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

817
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,920
Come on, man. Let's pick it up.

818
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,912
Got to get those things
to the wastewater tank

819
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,116
before they ship out.

820
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,313
What's got into these things?

821
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,310
Hey!

822
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,957
Hey! Hey!

823
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,312
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

824
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,119
Yeah, get Burke on the phone.

825
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,552
And start a trace on the box truck.
The big one.

826
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,960
Dowd.

827
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,233
Hey, I got them,
but there's not much time.

828
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,835
Tenneson probably already
has Burke coming for us.

829
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,752
Hey. Nice job.

830
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,235
Thank you.

831
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,994
I never drove a stick before.
It was very exciting.

832
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,270
Cool. Want to give me a hand with this?

833
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,350
Yeah.

834
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,795
Well, I'll be...

835
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,874
Hey, there.

836
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,713
You're looking good.

837
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,880
For you.

838
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,039
Okay. Okay.

839
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,032
Yeah, I missed you.

840
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,233
I missed you, too.

841
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,400
They're a family.

842
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,230
He was looking for his parents.

843
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,910
I got the truck. It's stationary.

844
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,114
Load up! Let's go! We got them!

845
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,792
No turning back now.

846
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,632
All right, this one's yours.

847
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,280
Someone say I'm coming with you?

848
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,472
Come on, man, we need you.

849
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,110
Okay.

850
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,951
If I'm going to go to prison,
it might as well be in style.

851
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,712
Okay. The vents are marked on this.
I'll follow you.

852
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,395
Yeah.

853
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,153
You said these guys have
hive intelligence, right?

854
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,230
Yeah.

855
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,993
Well, then he'll know what to do.

856
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,196
You're just there to guide him.

857
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,112
- Right.
- Be gentle, but firm.

858
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,190
That opens.

859
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,270
Let him know you're the one steering.

860
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,154
Right. Gentle but firm.
I'm the one steering.

861
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,790
Okay.

862
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,434
Hey.

863
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,160
Go do this. Yeah.

864
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,593
Thanks, Mr. Weathers.

865
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,590
Hope you picked something up
from watching me.

866
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,877
A week ago, you were riding a bicycle.

867
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,034
Welcome to Geldon Dodge.

868
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,077
Can we get you a cup
of complimentary coffee?

869
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,590
They're on the move.

870
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,350
What?

871
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,269
What about the next slide?

872
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,476
They're on the move in what?

873
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,719
These guys were ready for a walk.

874
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,439
They're happy they're going home.

875
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,390
We just picked them up
on a police scanner.

876
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,675
Off Old Cutler Road.

877
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,319
It's close, about a mile south.

878
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,596
There they are. Ten o'clock.

879
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,710
Here we go.

880
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,116
I can't believe I let you
and your girlfriend talk me into this.

881
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,477
We're not... That's not...

882
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,990
Are we?

883
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,991
Hey, Sheriff,
we got a call from Ken Galloway.

884
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,958
Said a bunch of trucks rode over his land.

885
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,509
He said they looked like monster trucks.

886
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,114
Yeah, which way were they headed?

887
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,796
Okay, let's take out Big Green first.

888
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,030
I'll take left.

889
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,270
Roger that. Taking right.

890
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,950
He needs help.

891
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,357
Get behind him, Meredith. Give him a push.

892
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,310
What?

893
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,080
I really hope they had their seatbelts on.

894
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,554
We can't outrun them in the flats.

895
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,989
Just hang on.
We'll lose them in the rough.

896
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,077
Stay close here, guys.
It's going to get tight.

897
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,640
We'll get them on the ridge.

898
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,836
Do we know where we're going?

899
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,514
Don't worry, they know.

900
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,234
Downed tree, dead ahead!
Do we have a tree plan?

901
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,154
Okay, guys. And pull!

902
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,073
Okay, Dowd, you can open your eyes now.

903
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,754
Did we make it?

904
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,116
Everybody, stay close.
It's going to get tight up here.

905
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:47,994
They're right behind me!

906
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,353
Tripp, on your right!

907
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,072
All right, kid,
this is where your little joyride ends!

908
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,230
Help!

909
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,950
Tripp!

910
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,029
Thanks, buddy!

911
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,594
- Tripp, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm...

912
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,550
What is that?

913
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,400
Tenneson.

914
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,871
It's poison! We gotta stop that tanker.
They're going to poison the nest.

915
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,440
Okay. We need to move faster.

916
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,755
Come on!

917
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,960
Light it up.

918
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,796
Get back! Stay back!

919
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,794
We got 'em now!

920
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,313
I see 'em! Go up the left side!

921
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,155
Rick?

922
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,799
Get to the sides! Get to the sides!

923
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,960
I cannot believe you're here.
I'm actually really happy to see you.

924
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,551
Hey, I told you I wasn't going anywhere.

925
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,040
The vents are right on the other side.

926
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,316
We have to get past this truck.
It's the only way.

927
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,075
Hang, on, Tripp,
you're not seeing what I'm seeing.

928
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,630
No, I got it right here.
I know what we're in for.

929
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,997
I seriously hope you're not
thinking about jumping off a mountain.

930
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,231
As the only scientist here,
I don't think they can do that.

931
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,470
We don't have a choice.

932
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,399
I hope you know what you're doing, Tripp.

933
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,911
Rick, give us something to jump.

934
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,239
Yeah. Okay.

935
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,671
Tripp, there's a 99% chance
that would be impossible.

936
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,229
Maybe 100%.

937
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,919
You be careful, son.

938
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,831
Rick, I'm sorry I said all those
terrible things about you.

939
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,590
Wait, what?

940
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,710
Let's go!

941
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,718
Come on, Creech!

942
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,510
Go, Tripp!

943
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,870
We made it!

944
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,032
You guys take out the pumps,
I'll handle the tanker.

945
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,794
- Got it.
- We're on it.

946
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,712
Hey, there's another one.

947
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,799
Pumps are at speed!

948
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,073
We need to stop those pumps.

949
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,879
Come on. One last push.
You're almost home.

950
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,877
Any trucks still running,
get up here to the vents.

951
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,511
- Can we stop it?
- It locked me out.

952
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,433
If this pressure gets to 15,000 psi,

953
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,113
the poison will reach
all the way down to the nest.

954
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,271
Come on, buddy, wake up! You can do it!

955
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,470
The valves!

956
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,115
Come on, come on!

957
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,114
Righty-tighty.

958
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,513
We have to stop the poison!

959
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,756
It's not working! We're too late!

960
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,396
Go! Get out! Save yourself!

961
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,349
Tripp!

962
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,676
We did it.

963
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,952
I'm going to miss you, Creech.

964
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,918
You were a good truck.

965
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,959
Don't worry. I know where to find you.

966
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,270
Tripp!

967
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,590
Tripp!

968
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,950
You stay put. We got you.

969
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,035
Hi, Fish and Wildlife?

970
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,591
Yeah, my friends and I found
some horned lizards

971
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,672
on the Terravex property.

972
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,509
Are they endangered, by any chance?

973
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:45,679
Well, it's nothing like my old one,
but I think it'll do.

974
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,956
Yeah.

975
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,876
Now you can do
whatever you want this summer.

976
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,998
Take it as far as it'll go.

977
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,480
Thanks, Rick.
