1
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,127
"Booby Traps"?

2
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,044
There you are, my lovely.

3
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,761
What's that?

4
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,486
Take the book?

5
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,460
I don't mind if I do.

6
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,088
At last, it is mine.

7
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,806
Finally, you are mine.

8
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,805
All right. Let's do this. Bare knuckles.

9
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,122
Bring it on, skinny. You don't scare me.

10
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,900
You got any sevens?

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,490
Go fish.

12
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,685
Is that all you got?

13
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,206
Man, this is way overdue.

14
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,940
"Once upon a time, under the sea,

15
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,220
"there was a little town
called Bikini Bottom.

16
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,940
"In this town, there was a place
called The Krusty Krab,

17
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,045
"where folks would come to eat a thing
called the Krabby Patty.

18
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,027
"Every greasy spoon has a fry cook,
and the one who worked here

19
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:02,449
"was named SpongeBob SquarePants."

20
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,100
<i># Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? #</i>

21
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,884
<i># SpongeBob SquarePants! #</i>

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,060
<i># Absorbent and yellow and porous is he #</i>

23
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,140
Just hold it. Hold it.

24
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,940
<i># SpongeBob SquarePants! #</i>

25
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,020
<i># If nautical nonsense
be something you wish #</i>

26
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,140
<i># SpongeBob SquarePants! #</i>

27
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,140
<i># Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish #</i>

28
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,242
<i># SpongeBob SquarePants! #</i>

29
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,561
Stop!

30
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,763
There's only one thing worse
than talking birds, and that would be...

31
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,020
Singing birds!

32
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,011
Okay, I promise not to si-i-i-ng.

33
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,700
Take it from us.

34
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,326
He really does hate singing birds.

35
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,591
Just keep weading.
Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.

36
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,521
Come closer while I tell you the tale.

37
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,207
- Okay, start reading.
- No. Not that close!

38
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,641
Yeah.

39
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,451
All right, here we go.

40
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,446
Now, SpongeBob loved his job
as a fry cook

41
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,209
more than anything.

42
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,681
And that is saying a lot

43
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,281
because he loved everything!

44
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,860
He loved his pet snail, Gary.

45
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,644
He loved his best friend, Patrick.

46
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,728
He loved blowing bubbles

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,728
and jellyfishing.

48
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,980
He loved making Krabby Patties
for the folks of Bikini Bottom

49
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,700
just as much as they loved eating them.

50
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,220
Why, you may ask,

51
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,340
do they love this
greasy little sandwich so much?

52
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,761
Why did they eat them for breakfast,

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,326
lunch,

54
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,340
and dinner,

55
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,060
despite their doctor's warnings?

56
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,685
He'll be gone in a week.

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,121
Oh, Harold!

58
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,530
It was a secret.

59
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,380
No one was sure what was

60
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,060
in these patties
that made them so delicious.

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,780
And, frankly, no one cared,

62
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,900
except for Plankton.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,380
Plankton owned a restaurant
right across the street

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,620
from The Krusty Krab,

65
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,860
where no one ate
because the food was really bad.

66
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,689
Now, is that really necessary?

67
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,808
Plankton had made it his life's work
to steal the recipe.

68
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,100
SpongeBob, please,
let's talk about this!

69
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,363
And SpongeBob was
always there to protect it.

70
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,207
But today, things

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,411
would be different.

72
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,980
Good morning, SpongeBob!

73
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,180
Morning, Patrick!

74
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,060
You here for
your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?

75
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,820
I'm getting two today.

76
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,100
One for me and one for my friend.

77
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,020
Have I met this friend?

78
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,043
"You know me, SpongeBob."

79
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,529
Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.

80
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,166
Thirteen,

81
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,340
fourteen, fifteen...

82
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,808
Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got
our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,126
Tartar...

84
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,300
Sauce?

85
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,811
Bull's-eye!

86
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,401
Plankton!

87
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,091
So it's a food fight he wants, eh?

88
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,860
Welcome to Air Plankton.

89
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,300
Please put your seat backs
and tray tables up

90
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,006
as we're now approaching
our final destination.

91
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,971
Okay, Patrick, load the potatoes!

92
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,940
Mashed or scalloped, sir?

93
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,820
No, Patrick. Raw.

94
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,081
Sir, yes, sir!

95
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,082
Locked and loaded!

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,180
Don't worry, little formuler,
you'll be safe in this

97
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,566
safe.

98
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,406
Fire!

99
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,360
Potatoes?

100
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,940
He's closing in!

101
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,123
I think we have a few minutes
before he gets here.

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,324
He's right on top of us!

103
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,165
Hey, it's raining fries!

104
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,483
It's gonna take a lot more than
potatoes to bring this baby down.

105
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,681
Or maybe not.

106
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,883
Wait a minute, Patrick, look!
He's got a tank!

107
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,966
Well, Krabs, you're certainly
in a pickle now!

108
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,881
Hey, it's raining pickles!

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,565
Now it's raining...

110
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,405
Tanks.

111
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,800
You're welcome!

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,691
Finland.

113
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,740
Your orders, sir!

114
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,420
I'll have two
Krabby Patties-extra ketchup,

115
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,727
extra mustard, and hold the mayo.

116
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,126
Wrong channel!

117
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,540
Your orders, sir!

118
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,326
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
Hold the mayo!

119
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,561
Yes, sir!

120
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,405
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!

121
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,646
Hold the mayo!

122
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,260
Unleash the condiments!

123
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,010
With relish.

124
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,849
Excuse me.

125
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,561
Hello?

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,087
Hello?

127
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,322
- Guess y'all don't want my money.
- Money?

128
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,084
Thank you! Come again!

129
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,608
I can't hold the mayo any longer!

130
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,605
Mayo? Well, it's going to
take a lot more than mayo to stop...

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,766
Now what?

132
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,445
I just remembered,
I don't work for Mr. Krabs!

133
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,244
Robot! Robot!

134
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,681
Robot! Giant robot!

135
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,763
Robot! Robot!

136
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,340
Mr. Krabs, Plankton's here
and he's got a giant robot!

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,885
Quick, boy, bar the door!

138
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,406
Got it!

139
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,640
I'll take one secret formula

140
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,726
to go.

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,651
Oh, barnacles. I'm out of gas?

142
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,220
I'm not through yet.

143
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,140
I've got something that will make
you hand over that formula.

144
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,686
Something you can't resist.

145
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,740
Money!

146
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,410
Yes!

147
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,524
That's... That's... That's impossible!

148
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,927
Well, it was full of money
just last week.

149
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,260
And then I bought that airplane
and built that tank.

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,526
Sounds to me like
someone's just a wee bit broke!

151
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,340
Well, Krabs, I guess you've won.

152
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,206
I've spent every penny I've ever made
trying to put you out of business.

153
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,020
Except this one. My last penny.

154
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,010
Besides, what can I do
with one measly cent anyway?

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,260
You could give it to me.
Just a suggestion.

156
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,964
Here, take it.

157
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,885
You've taken everything else. Why not?

158
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,620
Well, Plankton,
like a reheated Krabby Patty,

159
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,927
you've been foiled again.

160
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,820
I guess this means the secret formula
is safe forever, right, Mr. Krabs?

161
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,445
It sure does, boy.

162
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,083
Why don't you scurry along?

163
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,811
Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!

164
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,931
He's been out there
crying for 20 minutes.

165
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,300
Pathetic.

166
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,290
I'm just going to
go out there and gloat a little.

167
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,180
Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.

168
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,580
"Laptop." You do realize
that nickname is demeaning?

169
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,604
I have twice
the processing power of a laptop.

170
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,525
Never mind. Maintain radio silence.

171
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,086
Finally!

172
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,900
A pressure plate, eh, Krabs?

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,490
Amateur hour.

174
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,201
Perfect!

175
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,725
Not a bad likeness.

176
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,620
Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs.

177
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,802
Easy, easy.

178
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,700
Plankton's broke!

179
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,540
Look at Mr. Krabs go.

180
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,642
I've never seen him
gloat this hard before.

181
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,820
Hey, well, Plankton,

182
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,491
me bunions are telling me
it's time to stop gloating.

183
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,087
Looks like you're
falling apart at the seams.

184
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,580
Poor me.

185
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,331
- Sob, sob.
- A robot?

186
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,006
Plankton?

187
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,251
That ain't good.

188
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,843
Initiating lockdown sequence.

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,365
Me formuler!

190
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,620
No, no, no! No!

191
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,370
Squidward! Open up!

192
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,330
Victory dance. Boo-ya.

193
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,900
Give me that!

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,924
Come on, SpongeBob, join me!

195
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,840
And we'll be rich and powerful,
until I eventually betray you.

196
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,340
- Join me!
- No! Never!

197
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,522
I'm on Team Krabs for life!

198
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,525
Plankton!

199
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,140
What? Where'd it go?

200
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,620
Wait a minute. Molecular deconstruction?

201
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,900
I proved that to be
a scientific impossibility seven times!

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,780
Wait a minute.

203
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,486
I think I forgot to empty
Gary's litter box today.

204
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,620
Where's me formuler, Plankton?

205
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,340
I... I don't know! It just disappeared!

206
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,540
Why should I believe you,
you lying liar?

207
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,300
Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs,

208
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,980
but this time he's telling the truth.
It just vanished!

209
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,650
It's true!

210
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,900
Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you
he's innocent!

211
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,570
What are you going to do, Krabs?

212
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,980
Pour hot oil on me?

213
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,162
Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?

214
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,091
No. Knock, knock.

215
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,721
Knock-knock jokes?
I can do this all day, Krabs.

216
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,126
Knock, knock.

217
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,408
Oh, boy. Who's there?

218
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,601
Jimmy.

219
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,921
Jimmy who?

220
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,130
Jimmy back my formuler, Plankton!

221
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,171
Well, that's stupid,
but how is it torture?

222
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,260
You'll see.

223
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,603
"Jimmy back my formula"?

224
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,450
I get it!

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,890
Make it stop, Krabs! Make it stop!

226
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,327
Mr. Krabs? SpongeBob, zip it!

227
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,300
Thank you, Squidward.

228
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,340
The customers are getting restless!

229
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,808
They're asking for refunds.

230
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,527
Refunds.

231
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,180
Refunds?

232
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,169
Refund! Refund!

233
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,420
Listen up, boy. Get in there

234
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,887
and make me customers
some Krabby Patties!

235
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,088
All right, Plankton...

236
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,402
SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?

237
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,881
We're out of Krabby Patties?

238
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,180
How can we make more Krabby Patties
without the secret formula?

239
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,660
You've got to have
that formuler memorized by now!

240
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,060
But as you are aware, sir,

241
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,460
the employee handbook clearly states,
and I quote,

242
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,846
"No employee may, in part or in whole,

243
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,771
"commit the Krabby Patty secret formula
to any recorded written or visual form,

244
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,564
"including memories, dreams,
and/or needlepoint."

245
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,140
Curse you, fine print!

246
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,900
Refund! Refund! Refund!

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,445
Stop!

248
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,140
I'm not your enemy!

249
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,260
Plankton is your enemy!

250
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,601
So is he an anemone or a plankton?

251
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,201
Well, someone had to do it.

252
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,500
But Mr. Krabs...

253
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,841
He took this from you!

254
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,940
- Krabby Patty...
- I can almost taste it.

255
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,580
Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take
the secret formula.

256
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,364
Not now, SpongeBob!

257
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,770
Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty!

258
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,970
So join me! Help get the formuler back,

259
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,285
and I'll give each and every one of
you a free Krabby Patty!

260
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,460
No! Wait!

261
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,245
Even better, a slight discount!

262
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,820
To The Chum Bucket!

263
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,410
But he didn't do it.

264
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,690
I had it right in my greedy little mitts,
and then... Poof!

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,740
And now it's gone. Gone forever.

266
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,083
I was so close to
gaining the people's respect-slash-fear.

267
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,500
Plankton?

268
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,420
When will my
frustration-slash-humiliation end?

269
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,500
- Plankton?
- Not now, hon!

270
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,284
I'm ranting-slash-raving.

271
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,740
All right, what is it?

272
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,401
Well, I was trying to tell you
there's an angry mob outside.

273
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,081
But now they're inside.

274
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,450
I just work here.

275
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,291
We'd like to have a word with you!

276
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,122
You all look very hungry.

277
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,260
Can I get anybody a Chum Burger?

278
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,964
Enough with the niceties, Plankton!

279
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,124
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

280
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,300
Where is me formuler?

281
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,041
I told you, Krabs, I don't have it.

282
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,242
Wrong answer.

283
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,980
Stop!

284
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,447
All right, Mr. Krabs,
let me get in on this.

285
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,243
What's going on around here?

286
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,620
You may want to
step back a little, Mr. Krabs.

287
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,767
This could get messy.

288
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,006
Let's hope so.

289
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,780
So you won't talk, eh, Plankton?

290
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,020
I didn't want to have to do this.

291
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,885
Plankton, here comes the pain.

292
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,243
Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical!

293
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,007
No! Stop! Don't!

294
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,523
Wait. That didn't look painful.

295
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,042
Mr. Krabs, you may not understand
what I'm about to do today,

296
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,690
but someday we'll look back
and have a good laugh.

297
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,420
Wait a minute.

298
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,363
Hey, they're getting away!

299
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,370
Sorry, Mr. Krabs!

300
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,531
So, you've been running
a long con on me, eh?

301
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,289
All these years you've been
working for Plankton!

302
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,765
They're in cahoots!

303
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,860
Yeah, I guess
that's a short way of saying it.

304
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,689
Stop that bubble!

305
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,121
Please tell me
there's something soft below me.

306
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,881
- Nope.
- Nope.

307
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,048
SpongeBob!

308
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,260
You were like an underpaid son to me.

309
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,489
I would've expected Squidward
to stab me in the back.

310
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,620
What?

311
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,940
But SpongeBob?

312
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,980
Me most trusted employee?
Working with me sworn enemy?

313
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,890
You know what this means, Mr. Squidward.

314
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,300
We get the rest of the day off?

315
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,380
No!

316
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,087
This be but a harbinger
of what I fear lies ahead.

317
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,770
For you. For me.

318
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,570
For all of Bikini Bottom!

319
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,220
The Krabby Patty
is what ties us all together!

320
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,962
Without it, there will be
a complete breakdown of social order.

321
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,720
A war of all against all!

322
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,611
Dark times are ahead.

323
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,725
Dark times indeed!

324
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,281
Seriously?

325
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,288
Aren't you overreacting a bit?

326
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,801
Welcome to the apocalypse,
Mr. Squidward.

327
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,442
I hope you like leather.

328
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,250
I prefer suede.

329
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,362
And so Bikini Bottom became

330
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,446
an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore.

331
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,160
The end.

332
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,644
Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending.

333
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,020
- This is bad. Really bad.
- What? What?

334
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,327
SpongeBob's in trouble
and the story's over?

335
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,289
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

336
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,319
Hey, call a therapist!

337
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,731
I have anxiety!

338
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,802
There is no way that
that's the end of this story.

339
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,740
Of course it is. I'll show you.

340
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,921
Just turn around.

341
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,641
All right.

342
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,460
Hey!

343
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,528
I need that to fly, you jerk.

344
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,440
"The

345
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,846
"End"!

346
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,686
That's not the end!

347
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,220
Of course it is!

348
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,340
- Unhand that book!
- You let go of that!

349
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,885
Let go, you numbskull!

350
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,481
You better keep reading, Mr. Pirate,

351
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,321
or else!

352
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,690
I know I shouldn't be littering,
but that ending was rubbish!

353
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,249
Rubbish!

354
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,121
Good morning, Squidward.
I'll have the usual.

355
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,980
With cheese.

356
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,980
We're out of Krabby Patties right now!

357
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,606
No Krabby Patties?

358
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,407
No!

359
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,564
Look what's become of Bikini Bottom.

360
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,241
We've really gotta get
that formula back.

361
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,940
Get the secret formula, you say?

362
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,010
Excuse me, I need a moment.

363
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,807
With that formula,
I could rule the world!

364
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,420
You know I can hear you, right?

365
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,500
Well, what do we do now?

366
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,620
Now we work together.
You know, teamwork.

367
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,940
What's "tee-am work"?

368
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,565
No, Plankton, teamwork.

369
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,020
Tee-am work.

370
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,451
- Teamwork.
- Tie-'em work.

371
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,540
- Teamwork.
- Tie 'em up!

372
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,961
- Say "team," like a sports...
- Team.

373
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,804
- Team. Now say "work."
- Work.

374
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,967
Put them together. What do you got?

375
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,730
Time bomb work.

376
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,927
Getting better!

377
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,963
Now, Bikini Bottom Action News!

378
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,620
Hey, Patrick!

379
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,281
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!

380
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,684
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby...

381
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,380
Krabby Patty, Krabby...

382
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,940
Krabby Patty...

383
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,380
Krabby...

384
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,562
Krabby!

385
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,841
Come on, tummy,
it's gonna be a long day.

386
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,940
We interrupt your regular program
for an important news bulletin.

387
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,140
Perch Perkins reporting live
from downtown Bikini Bottom.

388
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,403
Complete chaos here today
as our town attempts to deal with

389
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,780
a sudden and complete shortage
of Krabby Patties.

390
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,900
Events here have
this reporter wondering,

391
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,620
what is the secret ingredient
in Krabby Patties anyway?

392
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,964
It's love!
The secret ingredient is love!

393
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,300
No more Krabby Patties?

394
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,688
If I'd have known that,
I'd have chewed it slower.

395
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,082
What the corndog is that?

396
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,522
Come on, Plankton, it's easy!

397
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,260
It means, I help you, you help me,
and when we accomplish our goal,

398
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,646
then we do hands in the middle.

399
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,764
Hands in the middle?
No, no. Sounds idiotic.

400
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,209
Besides, the two of us
are no match for that cranky mob!

401
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,780
We could probably
use a few more tee-am works.

402
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,260
That's exactly what I was thinking!

403
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,725
Wait, what are you doing?

404
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,370
I need Krabby Patties!

405
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,970
Patrick, what are you doing?

406
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,060
Krabby Patties!

407
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:44,805
Vandalizing stuff.

408
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,660
Isn't that your house?

409
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,420
Hey, what's with all the questions?

410
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,885
Who are you guys?

411
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,380
It's me, your best friend! SpongeBob?

412
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,506
Yeah?

413
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:57,964
Well, if you're SpongeBob,
then what's the secret password?

414
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,561
Uh...

415
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,660
Correct! It is you!

416
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,780
SpongeBob!

417
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,660
- SpongeBob.
- Patrick!

418
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,460
SpongeBob!

419
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,620
Why aren't you at The Krusty Krab
making Krabby Patties?

420
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,780
Well, I'd love to,
but the formula's gone.

421
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,940
Yeah, Mr. Krabs says
you and Plankton took it.

422
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,580
No, that's not what happened.

423
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,060
It just disappeared.

424
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,140
We're putting a team together
to find it.

425
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,651
A team?

426
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,124
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

427
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,460
Okay, Patrick, you're in.

428
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,050
I don't know, SpongeBob.

429
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,568
What exactly does this clown
bring to the tee-am?

430
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,922
He brings loyalty, Plankton.

431
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,460
Loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?

432
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,925
Yeah, yeah, loyalty.

433
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,482
I've got SpongeBob!

434
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,080
He's over here!

435
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,607
Let's go get him!

436
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,420
Come on, SpongeBob,
let's get out of here!

437
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,760
Patrick!

438
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,203
Patrick, why are you doing this?

439
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,567
Because I need

440
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,540
Krabby Patties!

441
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,642
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

442
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,890
Over here!

443
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,609
Guys, am I still on the team?

444
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,003
Hey, what are you looking at?

445
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,120
Sandy!

446
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,485
Sandy!

447
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,326
Sandy?

448
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,408
Sandy, are you home?

449
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,683
Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is.

450
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,368
What is all this stuff?

451
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,561
Sandy?

452
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,125
Don't touch that!

453
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,324
Incoherent muttering.

454
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,540
Sandy? Are you okay?

455
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,846
Okay?

456
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,780
Have you looked outside?
Does that seem "okay" to you?

457
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,770
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to society.

458
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,448
If we don't fix it soon,
there won't be anything left to fix!

459
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,460
Sandy?

460
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,740
The lack of Krabby Patties
has driven her mad.

461
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,500
And I think I figgered it out.

462
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,681
Look.

463
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,685
When this came down from above,

464
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,329
I knew it could only mean one thing.

465
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,931
And that would be?

466
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,203
It means it's the end!

467
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,041
The sandwich gods are angry with us!

468
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,580
- Sandwich gods?
- Sandwich gods?

469
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,366
I just don't know
how we're going to appease them!

470
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,660
You got any other friends
who aren't dim bulbs or nut jobs?

471
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,685
Well, I have one friend
who's loyal to the very end.

472
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,085
Gary, I'm home.

473
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,166
Gare-bear?

474
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,281
Gary?

475
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,761
Gary?

476
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,620
Revolting!

477
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,580
But it means Gary is close by!

478
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,648
Gary, I'm back!

479
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,400
Hey, Gary, Plankton and I need you
to help us find the Krabby Patty formula

480
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,811
and fix Bikini Bottom.

481
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,491
What do you mean,
you don't have to do as I say anymore?

482
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,521
What do you mean, "King of Snails"?

483
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,929
Gary The Snail, you get down here
right now and join this team!

484
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,244
What do you mean, "Seize them"?

485
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,100
Why are you running?

486
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,282
Because they're right on our tail.

487
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,060
Right, snails.

488
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,060
Well, so much for your tee-am.

489
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,900
Putting together a team is a lot harder
than I thought it would be!

490
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,331
This way!

491
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,205
We better get out of here
until things cool off.

492
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,563
Everything we know and love
has been destroyed.

493
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Yeah, looks like they're gonna have to

494
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:25,410
change the name of Bikini Bottom
to Dirty Bottom.

495
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,380
Right, SpongeBob?

496
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,380
That's kind of gross, Plankton.

497
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,801
Yeah. Yeah, too soon, huh?

498
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,724
This feels like it really is "the end".

499
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,728
Don't worry, SpongeBob,

500
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,500
we'll find the secret formula

501
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,780
and everything will go back
to the way it was,

502
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,121
you know, all happy and junk.

503
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,647
Now let's try and get some sleep.

504
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,960
Yeah, I guess you're right.

505
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,123
Here you are. Feel comfy?

506
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,620
You know, Plankton,

507
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,521
I think you might know a little bit more
about teamwork than you let on.

508
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,210
Good night, SpongeBob.

509
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,365
Good night, Plankton.

510
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,246
"Good night," indeed.

511
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
That's right, SpongeBob, sleep.

512
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,729
You're hiding that formula
in there somewhere.

513
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,886
Well, here goes nothing.

514
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,409
What is this place?

515
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,460
Fudge fight!

516
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,881
It's all over me!

517
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,500
It's so sweet in here!

518
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,980
I think my eyeball
is getting a toothache!

519
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,684
Hello, Plankton.

520
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,206
Come and play with us.

521
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,405
Hurry

522
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,761
before we melt.

523
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,700
So much sweetness.

524
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,882
I think I'm going to be sick!

525
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,206
Daddy!

526
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,940
Plankton? Plankton!

527
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,740
I just had the craziest dream!
And you were in it!

528
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,171
I'm sure it was nothing.

529
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,206
Now go back to sleep.

530
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,805
Were you in my brain?

531
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,804
What? No! That's crazy talk!

532
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,200
Then why is there
cotton candy on your antenna?

533
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,165
Because, because...

534
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,248
Okay, fine, I was in your brain.

535
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,420
What were you doing in there?

536
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,180
What do you think I was doing?

537
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,860
Looking for the secret formula.

538
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,008
- What?
- Don't act so innocent.

539
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,650
You knew what I was up to.

540
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,180
That's why you're pretending
not to know the formula.

541
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,540
I'm not pretending!

542
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,420
I can't believe you thought I was lying.

543
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,080
Hey, don't take it personally.

544
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:30,020
I just assume everyone is lying.

545
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,740
That is a horrible way

546
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,524
- to live your life.
- Whatever.

547
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,540
It is! And if we're going
to be on the same team...

548
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,043
Maybe I don't want to be on the tee-am!
You think of that?

549
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,164
But, Plankton, everything's better
when you're part of a team.

550
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,700
You're not going
to start singing, are you?

551
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,000
- <i># Teamwork! #</i>
- Oh, brother.

552
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:51,860
<i># We can do anything when we have teamwork #</i>

553
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,940
<i># Don't you think so, my friend? #</i>

554
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,565
<i># No, tee-am work #</i>

555
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,291
<i># Is getting in the way
of my schee-am work #</i>

556
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,780
<i># What don't you comprehend? #</i>

557
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,882
<i># But working together is the key #</i>

558
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,130
<i># Nothing's impossible
when it's you and me #</i>

559
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,322
<i># I'm doing just fine on my own #</i>

560
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,329
<i># Work is no fun when you do it alone #</i>

561
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,780
<i># If I want it done right,
I'll do it by myself #</i>

562
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,820
<i># But what if you need
something on a higher shelf? #</i>

563
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,580
<i># But I'm the target Of a very scary,
crazy post-apocalyptic mob!#</i>

564
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,500
<i># Well, that's exactly
why you need a partner #</i>

565
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,763
<i># Helping you with this important job #</i>

566
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,922
<i># I'll be the hammer, you'll be the nail #</i>

567
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,883
<i># I'll be the boat and you'll be the sail #</i>

568
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,100
<i># I'm the flower, you're the aroma #</i>

569
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,300
<i># Right now I wish I was in a coma #</i>

570
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,460

571
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,540

573
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,403

574
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,667

00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,420
<i># 'Cause nothing's impossible #</i>

576
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,940
<i># When we're a team! #</i>

577
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,500
All right, you can put me down.

578
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,940
Well...

579
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,260
That's one minute of my life
I'll never get back.

580
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,771
Not without a time machine.

581
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,882
Wait a minute. Hold that thought.

582
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,721
Now back up.

583
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,326
Slow down.

584
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,920
Not without a time machine.

585
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,921
Yes!

586
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,084
- SpongeBob, you're a genius!
- I am?

587
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,240
If we build a time machine,

588
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,100
we can go back to before
the formula disappeared.

589
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,741
Before society broke down.
Before we became the hunted!

590
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:30,090
That sounds great, Plankton,
but how do we build a time machine?

591
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:33,320
Well, first we'll need
a computer powerful enough

592
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,420
to calculate the intricacies
of time travel.

593
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,443
Where would we get one of those?

594
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,731
There she is. My computer wife.

595
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,962
They've got her tied up
in the back room.

596
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,300
I've never seen
this many people at The Chum Bucket.

597
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,540
I've never seen anyone there.

598
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,860
Now was that really necessary?

599
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,040
Cause the food's really bad.

600
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,720
Come on! Really?

601
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,161
How are we gonna
sneak past those guards?

602
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,851
Well, what do we have here?

603
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,849
We better hurry.
Those guys really hate tires.

604
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,845
We'll never get in. The door's locked.

605
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,411
Wait. The window is open.

606
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,300
Come on, Plankton,

607
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,460
it's time for some teamwork.
Give me a boost.

608
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,528
Okay. Wait a minute, no!

609
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,202
Just a little higher, Plankton.

610
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,001
Plankton?

611
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,491
Why don't you boost me up instead?

612
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,971
Yeah, good thinking.

613
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,287
Come on, SpongeBob, come on!

614
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,451
We're in!

615
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,564
There's a guard over there.

616
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,920
Let's take the key from around his neck.

617
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,140
We're gonna have to be very quiet.

618
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,720
Let's walk on the tips of our toes.

619
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,580
Will you stop playing that tiny piano?

620
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,205
You're gonna get us caught.

621
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,321
Sorry.

622
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,764
Now just reach over and grab it.

623
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,042
Halt! Who goes there?

624
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,085
Stop! Pull it over his head!

625
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,521
Stop, stop, stop!

626
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,803
Let me get up there.

627
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,970
Help me.

628
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,205
What?

629
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,321
No!

630
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,970
Plankton, help!

631
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,963
I'll rock him,
you tell him a bedtime story.

632
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,860
Once upon a time

633
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,282
there was a big fat pink idiot
who went to sleep. The end!

634
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,324
Nice try, but it's
gonna take more than that to...

635
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,644
I told you, I don't have the formula,
you monsters!

636
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,207
- Hey, baby, how are you?
- Plankton!

637
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,660
My hero! You must need something,

638
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,489
otherwise you wouldn't have come back.

639
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,325
Plankton has a plan
to save Bikini Bottom.

640
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,131
It doesn't matter, Plankton.
Krabs knows all your plans.

641
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,244
He's been through my hard drive
looking for the secret formula.

642
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,340
I never had it.
But we're going to get it.

643
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,361
We're gonna go back in time to steal
the formula before it disappeared.

644
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,601
Time travel!

645
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,980
Where are you gonna find
a computer that can do that?

646
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,320
Wait a minute!

647
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,180
I've never carried a head before.

648
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,691
You'll get used to it.

649
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,450
It's still warm.

650
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,340
So you won't talk, huh?

651
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,204
Let some air out of him.

652
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,087
Is this where
we're gonna build our time machine?

653
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,567
Sure. It's got everything we need.

654
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,721
A photo booth.

655
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:02,325
A cuckoo clock.

656
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,161
Some day-old chips.

657
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,402
Now all we have to do is build it.

658
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,380
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Hey, my pitch pipe!

659
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,020
I need it. For the time machine.

660
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,360
Okay.

661
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,811
Installed!

662
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,660
I did it!

663
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,860
No, we did it!

664
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,803
Wait. We did do it.

665
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,180
As a tee-am.

666
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,980
- A team.
- Whatever.

667
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,243
<i># Working together in harmony #</i>

668
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,641
<i># Side by side, we can reach our dreams #</i>

669
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,646
<i># 'Cause nothing's impossible
When we're a team #</i>

670
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,127
Okay, now for the brains!

671
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,760
Okay, Plankton, this is it.

672
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,401
It's gonna take all my processors
and energy to power this time machine.

673
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:12,740
So if you have anything
you wanna tell me,

674
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,251
you better tell me now.

675
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,660
Well, Karen...

676
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,162
I know I've taken you for granted
all these years, and...

677
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,820
...I, I just wanted to say,

678
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,207
I'm glad you're on my tee-am.

679
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,730
Oh, Sheldon, that's the sweetest thing
you've ever...

680
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,860
Plankton, are you crying?

681
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,624
No, no, no!

682
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:41,100
It's just one of the hazards
of having a giant eyeball.

683
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,140
There's always stuff getting in there.

684
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,969
Anyway, where were we?

685
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,685
Say "cheese."

686
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,525
Cheese!

687
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,082
According to my calculations,

688
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,180
The Krusty Krab should be right here!

689
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,123
What's that over there?

690
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,681
- SpongeBob?
- Patrick?

691
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,205
Is it really you?

692
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,243
- Yes, Patrick, it's...
- Finally!

693
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,200
The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!

694
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,688
Great Krabby Patty Famine?
What year is this?

695
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,046
It's Thursday.

696
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,260
According to my calculations,

697
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,840
we've only gone
four days into the future.

698
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,570
Where is everybody?

699
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,500
They all gave up on you. But not me!

700
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,762
Cause I'm not very smart.

701
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,328
Where is The Krusty Krab?

702
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,682
Right where it's always been!

703
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,220
I think we may be
lost in time, Plankton.

704
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,607
Maybe we should ask
this guy for directions.

705
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,009
Excuse me, sir?
Can you tell us when we are?

706
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,660
Who dares disturb
The One Who Watches?

707
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,046
The One Who Watches?

708
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,100
Your name is The One Who Watches?

709
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,700
No, my true name is

710
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,484
Bubbles.

711
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,100
Bubbles?

712
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,965
What kind of a name is Bubbles?

713
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,731
It is my ancient dolphin name.

714
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:56,850
So what's a dolphin doing out here
in the middle of space?

715
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,700
My kind have been
watching and protecting

716
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,087
the galaxy for...

717
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,122
10,000 years!

718
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,420
So you're the one
keeping the meteors from hitting us.

719
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,646
Yes, I am.

720
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,740
And I could really do
with a potty break.

721
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,571
Would you mind keeping an eye on things?

722
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,721
Sure thing.
But what am I keeping my eye on?

723
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,486
What are you doing?

724
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,005
I'm watching.

725
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,645
We don't even know
what we're watching for.

726
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,980
Maybe we should split up the workload.

727
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,740
You watch the one with the big red eye,

728
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,683
I'll watch the one
with the ringy thingies.

729
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,484
Like a team.

730
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,931
Okay, mine's moving.

731
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,525
Mine, too.

732
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,965
No, this doesn't seem right.

733
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:51,140
Should we call Bubbles?

734
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,846
Let's give him a minute.
He's been holding it for 10,000 years.

735
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,700
I'm pretty sure
that wasn't supposed to happen.

736
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,460
Come on, Plankton,
we got to clean this up

737
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,688
before Bubbles gets back!

738
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,251
Much better. Yes.

739
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,086
You two are free to go.

740
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,171
What happened to Saturn and Jupiter?

741
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,122
You were supposed to...

742
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,020
Keep them from smashing into each other!

743
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,201
Sorry.

744
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,607
Now I am going to lose my job!

745
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,287
And you will lose your lives.

746
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,245
Quarter me!

747
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,840
Plankton?

748
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,600
SpongeBob!

749
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,204
Plankton?

750
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,660
SpongeBob?

751
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,444
Who are you two supposed to be?

752
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,420
I'm you, from the future.

753
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,249
And I'm him from the future.

754
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,900
So you traveled back through time
to help me? Great thinking.

755
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,340
Nope. He's helping me.

756
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,860
But he's the enemy!

757
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,220
Was the enemy. Now we're a team.

758
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,288
What? A tee-am?

759
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,130
A team!

760
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,442
All right, go get the formula.

761
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,525
What have I become?

762
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,966
All right, Plankton.

763
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,180
Do you have
flying boatmobiles in the future?

764
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,740
We only came back
from the day after tomorrow, dimwit.

765
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,410
Are there rocket packs?

766
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,700
- Did they outlaw clothes in the future?
- No!

767
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,860
Then why are you naked?

768
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,327
Because they don't make
clothes in my size.

769
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,487
Hold still, you!

770
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,580
If you're from the future,
what am I gonna say next?

771
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,808
- Something moronic?
- Wow.

772
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,684
Hey, hurry up over there!

773
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,764
That ain't good.

774
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,780
Initiating lockdown sequence.

775
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,247
Come on, SpongeBob,
we gotta get out of here!

776
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,887
- Got it!
- Come on!

777
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,460
That was crazy!

778
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,940
So that's what teamwork is.

779
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,700
All those years I tried
to make you mine,

780
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,660
and I finally did it.

781
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,161
I mean, we did it!

782
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,130
And so it would seem that

783
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:58,281
our heroes have accomplished
all they had set out to do.

784
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,140
Now that's an ending.

785
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,810
Andy, cue the music.

786
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,931
Oh, no.

787
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,100
That's not the end.

788
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,249
So you mean the ending
might be even happier?

789
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,691
Here we go!

790
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,082
Land ho!

791
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,809
Mom, where's my towel?

792
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,841
What?

793
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,608
- Dude, look at that.
- What?

794
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,926
I'm coming! Come on, you lazy people!

795
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,283
Out of my way! I'm coming!

796
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,206
Out of there!

797
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,406
Sorry!

798
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,642
- Too fast!
- Slow down!

799
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,082
- I'm coming!
- No, no!

800
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,260
Yeah!

801
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,126
All right, you feathered rats,
time to shove off!

802
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,408
What? Why?

803
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:25,124
Well, I can't have you pooping
all over my restaurant, can I?

804
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,527
Restaurant? I thought
this was a pirate ship.

805
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,500
It is.

806
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,125
But it is also...

807
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,205
My very own food truck!

808
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,401
A what?

809
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,008
You know, a restaurant on wheels.

810
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:55,003
- Like a garbage truck.
- No!

811
00:49:55,003 --> 00:49:57,282
Are you trying to
scare away my customers?

812
00:49:57,283 --> 00:50:00,524
Well, we're not leaving
till we see how the story ends.

813
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,491
No problem.

814
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,604
You guys like
a little snack while you wait?

815
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:08,900
- Sure, I'll take a curdled milk.
- How about a fish head?

816
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,445
And a French fry covered in sand.

817
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,860
Who wants some...

818
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,301
hot wings?

819
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:17,483
Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?

820
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,170
Which one of you is next?

821
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,851
He's a madman!

822
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,020
Let's get out of here!

823
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,009
You crazy, man! You crazy!

824
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,540
Bye-bye, Mr. Poop.

825
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,926
Now I can get my gold sticker.

826
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,700
Hey, Mr. Piwate.

827
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,882
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

828
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,205
I can't fly without my feathers.

829
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,060
Where to, Mac?

830
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,730
Just dwive.

831
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,407
Squidward!

832
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,568
Still out of Krabby Patties.

833
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,810
Does anyone have a picture of ketchup?

834
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,085
I done figgered it out!

835
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:19,884
We have angered the sandwich gods
and only a sacrifice will appease them!

836
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,590
Well, that sounds reasonable.

837
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:25,282
Soon our post-apoca-whatchamacallit
will be over,

838
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,240
and Krabby Patties
will rain down from above!

839
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,900
Rain down? Well, that's no good.

840
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,764
How will I get me money?

841
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,003
You don't like that idea?
Then we'll sacrifice you!

842
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,925
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

843
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,020
It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice

844
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,140
on an empty stomach.

845
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,322
Who wants a Krabby Patty?

846
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,340
SpongeBob, is that me formuler?

847
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,044
Oh, happy day!

848
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,771
I missed you so much.

849
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,140
Where was it? Where did you find it?

850
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,180
Well, Plankton and I
built a time machine

851
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,140
out of an old photo booth
and then we added...

852
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,685
- Cheese!
- Patrick, wait!

853
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,764
It's okay, everyone.

854
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,685
The post-apocalypse is almost over!

855
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,122
Ain't that right, SpongeBob?

856
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,088
"Eugene, eat my

857
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,966
"subaquatic air bubbles.
Love, Plankton"?

858
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,100
You grabbed the wrong bottle!

859
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!

860
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,820
That's okay, SpongeBob.

861
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,940
We'll just have to sacrifice
the two of you then.

862
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,169
Prepare them for the sacrifice!

863
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,202
I bring a message from the dawn of time!

864
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,401
What is it, Patrick?

865
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,011
Run!

866
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,402
Squidosaurus rex!

867
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,900
Well, Plankton,

868
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,300
I guess we failed
to accomplish our goals.

869
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,900
"We"?

870
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,340
But even failure hurts a little less
when you do it as a team, right?

871
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,010
This is all your fault!

872
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,420
My fault?

873
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,260
You're the one who stole
the wrong secret formula.

874
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,940
I didn't know there were two bottles.

875
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,140
Of course you didn't!

876
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,766
Because you got cotton candy for brains!

877
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,362
No, seriously, he really does.

878
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,620
Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess
in the first place,

879
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,460
if you weren't so selfish and evil.

880
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,340
I was selfish and evil,

881
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,364
until you ruined everything
with your "teamwork"!

882
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,449
You take that back!

883
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,803
You are the worst teammate ever!

884
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,921
No!

885
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,882
Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing
garbage and recycling!

886
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,084
Look at me.

887
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,723
Why, I've become like all of you.

888
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,090
Savage.

889
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,526
Fear-ridden.

890
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,171
Selfish.

891
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,403
An entire town of formerly good citizens

892
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,060
turned into heartless freaks,

893
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,020
bent on their own self-prever...

894
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,660
Self-preter...

895
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,100
- "Preservation?"
- Yes!

896
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,980
We've become alienated from each other.

897
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,420
Each one an island unto himself,

898
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,580
concerned only with ourselves.

899
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,444
And in the name of all fishhood,

900
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,921
I am not about to let that happen!

901
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,500
And so,

902
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,162
if a sacrifice is needed to restore
Bikini Bottom to its former glory...

903
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,642
Then I am willing
to take one for the team!

904
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,801
You heard him!

905
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,645
Sacrifice!

906
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,043
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

907
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,540
Sacrifice!

908
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,644
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

909
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,771
Let the sacrifice begin!

910
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,008
Patties! Patties!

911
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,765
And I thought my friends were primitive.

912
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,060
Don't cry, me boy.

913
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,260
Everything's going to be fine, for us.

914
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,940
I'm not crying, Mr. Krabs.

915
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,485
I smell Krabby Patties!

916
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,940
That's right.
Keep thinking happy thoughts.

917
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,201
Now!

918
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,089
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

919
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,730
The boy's right.

920
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,420
My leg!

921
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,820
I smell 'em, too!

922
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,207
Okay, SpongeBob, go get it!

923
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,927
Wait. You mean we can
just take this stuff off?

924
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,690
Go find that Krabby Patty!

925
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,640
Come on, everybody!

926
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,889
I've got some Krabby Patty
orders to fill!

927
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,882
It's coming from over there!

928
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,242
Come on, guys,
I think it's just over this hill.

929
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,380
How do you expect us
to go up to the surface?

930
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,700
We won't be able to breathe!

931
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,690
All right, all secondary characters
come with me.

932
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,140
- Yeah, I'm with you guys.
- No way, Squidward.

933
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,460
You're going up there with us.

934
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,980
My feet hurt.

935
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,650
Patrick, you don't have feet.

936
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,380
It's not fair! You have feet.

937
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,280
Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.

938
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,044
Actually, I have four feet.

939
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,500
It's not about feet.

940
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,020
What is it about, then?

941
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,966
It's about being a team
and sticking together, no matter what!

942
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,380
The only way
we're going up there is if some

943
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,882
fairy godmother shows up
and helps us breathe air.

944
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,980
- Bubbles!
- SpongeBob, you know this guy?

945
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,180
Don't hurt us!
We're sorry we got you fired.

946
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,500
Hurt you?

947
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,570
Why, I traveled back
through time to thank you.

948
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,610
I've been stuck in that job for eons.

949
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,020
I needed a change,

950
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,010
but I was too afraid to go for it.

951
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,060
Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.

952
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,780
Now it is my turn to help.

953
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,645
I can get you safely to the surface.

954
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,380
Now!

955
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,860
Quick, all of you, get in my mouth.

956
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,340
Come on, guys, let's go!

957
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,649
There's no way I'm climbing
into some dolphin's mouth.

958
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,240
Yeah. This guy just wants a free lunch.

959
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,540
Guys, if Bubbles has the courage
to quit his dead-end, nowhere job

960
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,580
and travel back through time to help us,

961
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,648
then we need to have the courage to...

962
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,522
Well, I never thought
I'd be eaten by a dolphin.

963
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,740
No, if he was eating us,

964
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,127
he'd be chewing us up
and we'd be going down there.

965
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,580
This is what you call riding in style.

966
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,001
Not a lot of legroom in here.

967
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,885
Well, maybe if you didn't
have four feet!

968
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,568
Note to self:
Never stow away in a gym sock.

969
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,565
What's happening? I feel tingly!

970
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,361
My neck!

971
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,580
I've done all I can.

972
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,820
The rest is up to you.

973
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,445
Thank you, Bubbles!

974
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,608
Farewell, SpongeBob.

975
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,220
Farewell, Bubbles.

976
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,482
Now to update my...

977
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,920
Resume!

978
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,124
Fresh air! How I've missed you.

979
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,844
This place smells awful!

980
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,491
Come on, guys.

981
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,331
Let's get the Krabby Patty formula
and save Bikini Bottom.

982
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,580
What is this place?

983
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,684
I have a bad feeling about this.

984
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,168
Maybe this guy knows where we are.
He looks smart.

985
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,180
He's got five heads.

986
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,260
Sir? Could you tell us
where to find a Krabby Patty?

987
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,011
Hey, my friend's talking to you!

988
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,847
What?

989
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,328
A giant, hairy porpoise!

990
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,331
It's beached!

991
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,729
It's suffering. Poor thing.

992
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,020
Y'all, those aren't porpoises.

993
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,122
- All hands on deck!
- Oh, brother.

994
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,008
We need to get these guys
back in the water.

995
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,531
Come on! Push!

996
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,768
- Heave!
- Ho!

997
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,244
- Heave!
- Ho!

998
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,860
Put your back into it!

999
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,564
Come on, push!

1000
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,646
Well, I guess this is where that
horrible smell was coming from.

1001
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,370
Excuse me, do you know where we can get
a Krabby Patty around here?

1002
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,090
Invaders!

1003
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,060
You get out of my sister's sand castle!

1004
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,241
Mom!

1005
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,051
Where have you been all my life?

1006
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,220
Oh, Frank.

1007
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,163
That feels so good.

1008
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,521
Gross!

1009
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,770
Oh, hey, Squidward.

1010
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,260
Sandy!

1011
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,771
The Krabby Patty!

1012
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,245
I think I see where it's coming from!

1013
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,140
SpongeBob, you will not believe the size
of the ice creams here.

1014
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,460
I wonder what
other giant snacks they have.

1015
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,608
Cotton candy?

1016
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,300
If you ate all that,
you'd have enough energy

1017
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,084
to run around the whole world!

1018
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,171
When is the sugar gonna wear off?

1019
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,166
Hey, guys, I smell Krabby Patties!

1020
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,203
I think it's this way!

1021
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,205
Don't leave me, Squidward!

1022
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,610
- Now what?
- We're never going to make it!

1023
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,607
- Heave!
- Ho!

1024
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,326
We're doing it, guys!

1025
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,966
Dude, watch out!

1026
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,325
Hold on!

1027
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,367
SpongeBob!

1028
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,845
- Lean!
- Starboard!

1029
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,847
- What the...
- What?

1030
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,850
"Home of the Krabby Patty"?

1031
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,380
But The Krusty Krab
is the home of the Krabby Patty!

1032
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,180
Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?

1033
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,460
$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?

1034
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,609
Why didn't I think of that?

1035
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,806
You!

1036
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,685
Cease and desist
that unauthorized patty flipping!

1037
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,420
Yeah, that's my job!

1038
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,726
How did you get here?

1039
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,170
You cannot breathe air.

1040
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,060
Well, there was this magical dolphin

1041
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,100
from the future who shot us
out of his blowhole, and...

1042
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,328
Wait! Wait.

1043
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,790
That's not in the book.

1044
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,000
Book?

1045
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,561
There is no magical dolphin
in this story.

1046
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,210
What story?

1047
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,420
The story of how Bikini Bottom
was brought to its knees

1048
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,180
when its beloved Krabby Patty formula

1049
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,740
was stolen by me,

1050
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,410
Burger Beard.

1051
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,364
How does it end?

1052
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,740
Well, let me see.

1053
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,161
It looks like

1054
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,100
Burger Beard becomes the richest

1055
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,841
food truck proprietor in all the land.

1056
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,300
But how did you steal the formula?

1057
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,447
That was easy.

1058
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,449
I simply rewrote the story, and...

1059
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,607
Poof!

1060
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,460
Me formuler!

1061
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,642
What do you mean, rewrote the story?

1062
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,966
Watch this.

1063
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,771
"The brave

1064
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,620
"and handsome

1065
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,620
"Burger Beard

1066
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,860
"banished our poor heroes

1067
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,008
"to be stranded on

1068
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,402
"Pelican Island!"

1069
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,728
"The End"!

1070
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,340
This looks bad.

1071
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,249
And these guys look hungry!

1072
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,566
Look out!

1073
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,700
Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.

1074
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,565
Here! Take Squidward, you vile beasts!

1075
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,860
I want to be on a new team.
This one's broken.

1076
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,883
Sandy, you're smart. You have any ideas?

1077
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:36,168
I ain't been too smart
since I found this old piece of paper!

1078
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,483
- What?
- Incoming!

1079
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,650
Wait a minute!

1080
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,804
Now all we need is some ink!

1081
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,726
Which Squidward has helpfully provided.

1082
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,163
It happens when I'm nervous.

1083
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,402
Whatever you're going to do,
make it quick!

1084
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,060
They're closing in on us!

1085
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,650
I'm gonna write us an ending.

1086
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,420
Will it be a happy ending?

1087
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,000
It's going to be superpowered!

1088
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,044
I'll show you a happy ending.

1089
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,291
Patrick!

1090
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,485
Hey, I got feet!

1091
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,370
What is in these things?

1092
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,281
We'll take one secret formula to go!

1093
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,740
Clear the area, citizens.

1094
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,730
There's going to be
some serious aft-kicking here.

1095
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,929
But I banished you.

1096
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,485
Sour Note?

1097
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,723
My tiny little eardrums!

1098
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,490
Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on!

1099
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,331
Wait! Wait! Customers!

1100
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,602
Wait, please!

1101
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,844
Mr. Superawesomeness,

1102
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,805
take him down.

1103
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,443
Maybe we should have picked
a better superpower for you, Patrick.

1104
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,280
Let's see you get out of this one!

1105
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,290
Get ready for the Invinci-Bubble!

1106
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,771
No!

1107
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,371
My book!

1108
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,420
All right, team,
time for hands in the middle!

1109
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,860
Yes!

1110
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,610
Oh, yeah.

1111
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,403
Great job, guys. We did it!

1112
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,940
What?

1113
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,327
Sandy? Is that you?

1114
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,404
You can call me The Rodent!

1115
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,327
Hey, where'd the pirate go?

1116
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,521
It looks like Burger Beard forgot
the first rule of mobile fry cooking.

1117
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,680
Always batten down your grease traps.

1118
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,161
Follow that grease, team!

1119
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,085
There she blows.

1120
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,164
Oh, no, you don't.

1121
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,011
He's after the book!

1122
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,140
Sandy, use your squirrel powers!

1123
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,321
Roger that!

1124
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,805
She's never gonna make it!

1125
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,220
Everyone...

1126
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,004
Lean!

1127
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,411
That's what you get.

1128
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,804
Come here.

1129
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,620
The book!

1130
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,290
Sour Note!

1131
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,011
All right, Burger Beard,
prepare to be teamworked!

1132
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,682
I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.

1133
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,820
I don't get it.

1134
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,331
Because you're a sponge.

1135
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,521
Duh.

1136
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,610
Get him, The Rodent!

1137
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,370
Consider him roasted!

1138
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,127
Aw, nuts! I'm all out of nuts!

1139
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,246
Justice is best soft served.

1140
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,363
Patrick, I should have
never doubted your powers!

1141
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,965
I can't think of a sweeter way to go.

1142
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,808
It's all mine!

1143
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,970
Not so fast, Booger Beard!

1144
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,724
Me formuler.

1145
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,327
This will make you feel a little butter.

1146
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,451
Not melted butter!

1147
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,925
Mr. Krabs!

1148
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,008
Oh, yeah!

1149
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,525
They're beautiful!

1150
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,487
Patrick!

1151
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,285
I gotcha!

1152
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,561
SpongeBob!

1153
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,366
- Patrick?
- Talk to me, buddy.

1154
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,171
I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.

1155
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,044
Is this better?

1156
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,860
Much. Thank you.

1157
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,980
But the discomfort I feel
in my eyes is nothing

1158
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,820
compared to the shame I feel
for letting down the Patty.

1159
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,968
For letting down Bikini Bottom.

1160
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,691
Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it.

1161
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,049
No, Patrick, we blew it, as a team.

1162
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,561
Nope. This one's on you.

1163
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,251
Where do you think you're going?

1164
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,645
Why don't you get going, little fella,
before you hurt yourself?

1165
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,806
Plankton?

1166
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,442
It's Plank-Ton!

1167
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,131
Come on down from there, little fella.

1168
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,247
You wouldn't want to get hurt.

1169
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,089
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1170
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,651
My eye!

1171
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,051
He's getting away!

1172
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,845
Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles?

1173
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,003
The formula, please.

1174
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:16,245
Come on. Team up with me.
We'll be rich and powerful!

1175
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,521
No, thanks.

1176
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,688
I'm already part of a teamwork.

1177
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,620
Can we do hands in the middle again?

1178
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,940
Yes, we can, Patrick.

1179
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,010
But this time, there's one more
hand to go in the middle.

1180
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,161
Plankton?

1181
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,165
Oh, no.

1182
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,725
Here you go, Krabs.

1183
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,420
She's all yours.

1184
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,842
This doesn't have
another insulting note in it, does it?

1185
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,300
No, that's the old me.

1186
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,801
The one who turned his back
on everything important

1187
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,580
just to have that formula
all to himself.

1188
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,765
But I realize now that keeping
something to myself is...

1189
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,660
Selfish.

1190
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,923
Especially when that something
is the Krabby Patty.

1191
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,540
Okay, everybody, let's get back
to Bikini Bottom and...

1192
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,166
Oh, no! I don't have the page!

1193
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,327
Oh, no!

1194
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,930
It must be back on Pelican Island!

1195
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,442
Don't worry. I thought of everything.

1196
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,291
All right, SpongeBob, take us home.

1197
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,487
Thanks.

1198
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,900
- Squidward!
- Oh, yeah.

1199
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,607
Come on, it's time to go back
and open up The Krusty Krab!

1200
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,180
Are you out of your patty-flipping mind?

1201
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,460
I'll never leave this place!

1202
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,860
I mean, look at me. I'm a god!

1203
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,486
No, Squidward, you're a cashier.

1204
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,163
Wait a minute! What? No!

1205
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,370
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

1206
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,891
Don't be sad, Squidward.

1207
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,691
I left you a little surprise
under your shirt!

1208
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,648
Rock-hard abs!

1209
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,660
Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.

1210
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,700
Aw, shucks.

1211
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,725
Excuse us! We'd like
3,000 Krabby Patties, please!

1212
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,363
That sound must mean
things are back to normal.

1213
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,051
Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?

1214
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,980
First one's for you, Gary.

1215
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,048
Extra mayo, just the way you like it.

1216
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,964
Caught you red-handed!

1217
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,820
Gary hates mayo.

1218
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,620
Plankton!
Up to your old tricks again already, eh?

1219
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,220
Hey, I'm just putting things
back the way they were.

1220
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,129
What do you have
to say about this, Gary?

1221
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,161
Oh, shrimp.

1222
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,971
See you later, tee-am-mate!

1223
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,207
- Now can we sing it?
- Yeah!

1224
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,407
Pwease, Mr. Piwate?

1225
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,688
Oh, Kyle...

1226
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,884
How can I say no to you?

1227
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,620
Are you ready, kids?

1228
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,300
- Aye-aye, Captain!
- Aye-aye, Captain!

1229
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,580
What did you say?

1230
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,980
There's sand in my ears
and I can't hear you!

1231
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,447
- Aye-aye, Captain!
- Aye-aye, Captain!

1232
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,940
<i># Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? #</i>

1233

Silence!

1243
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,140
Oh, man. I like that song.
What happened?

1244
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,500
I don't like that song
and I put an end to it.

1245
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,940
Well, this music is terrible.

1246
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,371
