1
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,489
<i>My name is Flint Lockwood.</i>

2
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,246
<i>My whole life I always wanted to be
a great inventor.</i>

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,726
<i>Just like my hero.</i>

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,760
<i>The Scientifically Wonderful
World of Science.</i>

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,527
<i>With your host, Chester V.</i>

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,922
<i>Welcome back, science friends.</i>

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,084
You know, I have devoted my life
to inventing the future.

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,527
But every dream has a beginning.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,326
I still remember my first invention:

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,483
The humble Food Bar.

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,604
<i>It was like Chester V
was speaking directly to me...</i>

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,490
<i>...using the language of science.</i>

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,846
Now look at us.

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,402
Our new Food Bar XL
with flavor crystals.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,803
Still making people happy
after all these years.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,249
Now, kids, you'll almost certainly
never be me.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,848
But, remember, there's no such thing
as small science.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,690
Only small scientists!

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,888
We love you, Chester V!

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,722
Speaking of small scientists,
say goodbye, Barb.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,967
<i>Goodbye, Barb.</i>

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,006
<i>Can your ideas...</i>

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,571
<i>...change the world?</i>

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,241
Yes.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,129
<i>Just like Chester V...</i>

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,044
<i>...my dream was to make the world...</i>

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
<i>...a better place.</i>

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,249
Spray-On Shoes!

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,241
How you gonna
get them off, nerd?

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,602
<i>Unfortunately, a lot of people...</i>

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,800
<i>...didn't believe in me.</i>

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,650
<i>But I never gave up.</i>

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,563
<i>And eventually...</i>

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,847
<i>...I invented this:</i>

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,923
A machine that could turn water...

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,208
...into food.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,249
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,721
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super Mutating...

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,922
...Dynamic Food Replicator.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,770
Or, for short...

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,605
...the FLDSMDFR.

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,724
<i>Because of my invention's
food weather...</i>

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,209
<i>...I finally made the world...</i>

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,202
<i>...a better place.</i>

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,362
Yeah!

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,567
I love it!

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,205
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,124
<i>When the weather evolved
into a disaster...</i>

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
<i>...of epic portions...</i>

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,760
<i>...and the machine started creating...</i>

51
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,041
<i>...dangerous living food...</i>

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,726
<i>...I had to face the truth:</i>

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,161
<i>It was time to...</i>

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,043
<i>...put an end...</i>

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,611
<i>...to my FLDSMDFR.</i>

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,447
Chee... Chee... Chee... Chee...

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,763
<i>Cheese...</i>

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,481
<i>By destroying
my greatest invention...</i>

59
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,927
<i>...I made something even better:</i>

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,681
<i>Friends!</i>

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,604
You made me very proud, son.

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,963
- Thank you, Dad.
- Sorry.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,964
Sam Sparks, in the eight minutes
since we saved the world...

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,565
...I've had time to reflect.

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,121
And I think you and I
should have a place together.

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,287
A Place?

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,210
A place where we work.

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,450
You think we work together?

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,488
I do.

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,326
Awesome! Yes!

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,128
- We could build a lab.
- With cool weather...

72
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,282
...forecasting devices!

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,091
We can invent fantastic machines
like the FLDSMDFR.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,889
Yeah!

75
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,400
- But not that one.
- No.

76
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,530
- Not ever.
- Never, ever, ever!

77
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,524
What shall we call our lab?

78
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,330
How about Sparkswood?

79
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,364
Sparkswood.

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,483
Sparkswood is gonna need
some security.

81
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,603
And I can be your mascot!

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,001
And I can be your dad.

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,322
There are many ways
in which I can help.

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,769
Can't forget you, lab partner.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,762
Steve!

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,923
Where'd he get the brown crayon?

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,882
This...

88
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,602
- ...could be our future.
- Oh, yeah!

89
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,926
Greetings, friends.

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,207
And <i>namaste.</i>

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,807
Is that...?

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,962
Chester V?

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,281
Mustache.

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,608
Please have some humanitarian aid...

95
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,161
...as a gesture of our goodwill.

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,170
Chester V!

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,841
Your lab vest looks even cooler
in person!

98
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,085
Thank you. The lack of sleeves
frees up my arms to do this.

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,006
Hand, what did you do?

100
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,329
There's nothing wrong with your hand,
young Lockwood.

101
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,565
You see, I am merely a hologram
of the real Chester V.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,209
The United Nations has asked
me and my Thinkquanauts...

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,568
...to assist in the cleanup
and containment...

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,127
...of the leftovers all over the world.

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,206
Including your Swallow Falls.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,404
We'll get started on the cleanup...

107
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,761
...right away.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,968
As soon as you all leave.

109
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,970
What? You need us to leave?

110
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,281
Listen up, ghost man...

111
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,121
...you expect us to skedaddle from our
homes because of some nasty leftovers?

112
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,966
Yes. Yes, I do.

113
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,845
Son, you can't argue
with yellow police tape.

114
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,526
Everybody back up!
Listen to ghost man.

115
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,125
But do not fret.

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,762
All of you will be
temporarily relocated...

117
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,328
...to sunny San Franjose...

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,409
...California!

119
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,840
- The home of Live Corp!
- The home of Live Corp!

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,684
On my word as a hologram...

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,442
...you shall all return home
before you know it.

122
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,843
Except for you, Flint Lockwood.

123
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,241
Me? Why?

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,001
You are going...

125
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,201
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
Where am I going?

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,881
Oh, please tell me!

127
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,487
Just give it a second. He's buffering.

128
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,570
You are going to join me
at Live Corp...

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,565
...and help us make the world
a better place.

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,009
Sir, that's all I've ever wanted.

131
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,401
But I can't.

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,171
On account of making a promise
two minutes ago...

133
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
...to build a lab with my friends, sir.

134
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,527
I understand, Lockwood.

135
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,604
But if you become
a Thinkquanaut like me...

136
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,167
...then all your dreams will come true.

137
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,890
You have to do this!

138
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,044
What about our dream?

139
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,170
Flint, this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

140
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,807
We're all behind you.

141
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,285
Are you guys sure?

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,881
Sure.

143
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,681
This is the best day ever!

144
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,568
Sir, I've taken care of everything.
The locals have been evacuated.

145
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,246
<i>Splendid. And the inventor?</i>

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,323
- Oh, he took the job.
<i>- Outstanding!</i>

147
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,085
<i>Now we can keep an eye on him.</i>

148
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,642
<i>He has no idea of our real plan.</i>

149
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,925
<i>Contact me as soon as Operation
Capture the Invention succeeds.</i>

150
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,770
<i>Live Corp.</i>

151
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,324
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>

152
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,801
Oh, big day, big day!
Big day, big day...

153
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,610
...big day! Yes!

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,962
Wake up, Steve!

155
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,962
Steve.

156
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,969
Do I look like a future Thinkquanaut?

157
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,760
Morning there, skipper.
You want a sardine scramble?

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
No, thanks! Can't be late!

159
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,007
Flint! Ask that Chester V when
he thinks we can go home again.

160
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,087
Morning, Sam!

161
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,926
Morning, Flint! Are you ready
for your first day?

162
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,527
Yeah! Are you?

163
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,329
Sam?

164
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,124
Well, this is me. Good luck
with your new jobs, guys.

165
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,209
- Good luck, Flint!
- Break a leg, Flint!

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,965
Bye!

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,126
Good morning, Flint Lockwood
and lab partner.

168
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,447
I'm Barb.

169
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,326
I know, I'm a huge fan.

170
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,163
Monkey.

171
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,362
Excuse me...

172
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,366
...I'm an ape. One of Chester V's
most brilliant innovations.

173
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,921
An orangutan with a human brain...

174
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,601
...within my ape brain.

175
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,046
Like a turducken.

176
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,886
I'll be your welcome ambassador.
Soy latte?

177
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,406
Okay.

178
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,083
Coffee and milk?

179
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,011
Are you ready to...

180
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,846
- ...live?
- Oh, am I!

181
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,042
Monkey.

182
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,611
Ape. Follow me, boys.

183
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,529
Welcome to Live Corp.

184
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,165
There are caffeine stations...

185
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,362
...every 10 feet.

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,682
- Soy-free soy latte?
- Thanks!

187
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,243
- Hot.
- Not too bad yourself, monkey.

188
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,926
Caffeine patches
are available 24 hours.

189
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,602
And our mocha-yoga classes
are offered in beginner or grande.

190
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,286
Over here, indoor sports.
Those are encouraged.

191
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,160
Oh, cool! I've never played volleyball.

192
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,085
Well, neither have they.
You'll fit right in!

193
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,844
<i>Can your ideas change the world?</i>

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,641
- Behold, the motivation pod.
<i>- Can your ideas...?</i>

195
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,211
I know, right?

196
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,602
- Quinoa latte?
- Absolutely!

197
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,606
<i>Can your ideas...</i>

198
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,762
<i>...change the world?</i>

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,082
Yes, Chester V poster, they can!

200
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,441
- Mine too!
- So can mine!

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,207
- I have great ideas.
- Absolutely! I've got my idea pants on.

202
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,851
Thinkquanauts! Awesome!

203
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,487
Hey! Excuse me...

204
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,760
...I'm so looking forward
to working with you guy...

205
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,443
That's where we belong, Steve.

206
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,647
Anxious!

207
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,166
That's not even a possibility
until our next vesting ceremony.

208
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,683
- What's that?
- That's where Chester V...

209
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,481
...handpicks a great inventor
and makes him into a Thinkquanaut.

210
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,682
When? When?

211
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,651
Next one's in six months,
so submit your ideas...

212
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,882
...and who knows?
He might choose you.

213
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,042
Really?

214
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,601
Hot chocolate with
double-whipped whipped cream?

215
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,649
- Thanks.
- Happy inventing!

216
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,409
We're gonna have to get used to
that landing.

217
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,760
Okay, Steve, we have six months
until the vesting ceremony.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,286
Let's do this thing.

219
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,487
Can.

220
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,489
That's the spirit, Steve!

221
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,208
<i>Say goodbye...</i>

222
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,290
<i>...to ice cubes
with the Re-Freeze-a-Fan!</i>

223
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,811
<i>Can your ideas change the world?</i>

224
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,971
The Forkenknifenspooninator!

225
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,528
<i>Can your ideas...</i>

226
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,125
<i>...change the world?</i>

227
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,203
The Grocery Deliverator!

228
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,367
<i>Can your ideas change the world?</i>

229
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,364
Invisible coffee table!

230
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,567
Flint.

231
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,883
<i>Can your ideas...</i>

232
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,921
<i>...change the world?</i>

233
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,609
Flint!

234
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,444
The Celebrationator!

235
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,087
A party in a box for any occasion.

236
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,809
Okay, Steve, time to celebrate!

237
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,007
Celebrate!

238
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,966
Flint!

239
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,044
Happy birthday, Tim Lockwood!

240
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,403
Here you go, Dad. Hope you like it.
Steve picked it out.

241
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,801
Steve!

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,082
Yeah. Yeah!

243
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,609
Okay, like we practiced.
When I'm up on stage getting my vest...

244
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,531
...you hit the red button
when I say "celebrate."

245
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,369
Celebrate!

246
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,086
Careful, Steve!

247
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,005
- This is a loaded party-in-a-box.
- Hello, Team Live Corp!

248
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,167
It's a pleasure to welcome you...

249
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,445
...to our annual Thinkquanaut
vesting ceremony!

250
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,121
Chester V!

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,005
I have built the coolest, hippest
company in the world.

252
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,167
As you all know, the Food Bar
is the lifeblood of this company.

253
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,121
And this year, I've challenged myself
to reinvent taste.

254
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,688
So in two short weeks...

255
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,281
...we shall release the new
Live Corp Food Bar!

256
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,249
Version 8.0!

257
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,882
- Yes!
- And now, without...

258
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,169
...further ado, who will be this year's...

259
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,688
...newest Live Corp Thinkquanaut?

260
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,041
Yeah!

261
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,563
We have received thousands
of invention submissions...

262
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,963
...and today, one of them
will be deemed...

263
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,810
...Thinkquanaut-worthy.

264
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,007
Thank you, Barb.

265
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,602
This person comes from an island.

266
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,850
He's got a memorable mop
of unruly hair.

267
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,087
Hair. Hair!

268
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,562
That's me!

269
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,485
Our newest Live Corp
Thinkquanaut is:

270
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,803
Flint...

271
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,607
Yeah!

272
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,484
- ...ly McCallahan!
- No.

273
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,728
Crikey blikey! Yes!

274
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,768
For inventing...

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,731
...a zero-emission car
that runs on cute.

276
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,127
This is the greatest day of my life!

277
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,802
Didgeridoo! I'm finally a real inventor!

278
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,330
Sorry, Steve. No reason to celebrate.

279
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,881
- Celebrate!
- Wait, Steve, no, no, no. No!

280
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,770
Hi, Sam, it's Flint.

281
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,051
I see you're live on TV
with a tornado.

282
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,120
Probably why you're not
answering the phone.

283
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,005
<i>Thinkquanaut? I think not.</i>

284
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,924
Please call me back.

285
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,161
Okay. Bye!

286
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,446
Bad news! Sir, we lost contact...

287
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,170
...with Search Teams X and Y.

288
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,407
- What?
- Yeah!

289
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,527
The situation is...

290
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,491
...grim, sir. Still no sign
of the FLDSMDFR.

291
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,051
Should I send in Team Z?

292
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,449
Are you mad, Barb?
We'll be all out of alphabet.

293
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,287
Look, we're running low
on Thinkquanauts. We need...

294
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,409
...someone expendable.

295
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,444
Someone who knows the island
inside and out.

296
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,321
Someone who's smart, but still naive.

297
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,881
Someone who idolizes me...

298
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,122
...has recently hit rock bottom...

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,523
...and will now do
just about anything I ask.

300
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,287
Where are we gonna find
someone so desperate?

301
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,525
I think we already have.

302
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,606
Sprinkles!

303
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,163
Fire!

304
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,721
Flint, who's number one?

305
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,448
Ta-da!

306
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,682
Hey, Flint, I got your message.

307
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,201
Oh, no, what happened to you?

308
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,482
Flint, everyone gets humiliated
on national television.

309
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,006
It's not that big a deal.

310
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,641
Yeah, but not everyone
gets humiliated...

311
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,451
...in front of their childhood hero.

312
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,691
I'll never be a real inventor...

313
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,365
...in Chester's eyes.

314
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,163
Mom gave me this lab coat because...

315
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,609
...she always dreamed
I'd do great things.

316
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,486
Now I guess I won't.

317
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,609
Now that's a big bucket of churn.

318
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,406
Flint, you don't need
Chester's approval.

319
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,562
You can still make...

320
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,730
...the world a better place
without an orange vest.

321
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,564
I don't get vests.

322
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,287
Is it winter on your torso
and summer on your arms?

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,890
For what it's worth, the people
who really care about you...

324
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,930
...think you look great in your lab coat.

325
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,321
Good night, Mr. Lockwood.

326
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,045
Good night, my dear.

327
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,607
Hey, look, son.

328
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,366
This Chester V guy.

329
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,922
He promised us we'd be home
before we know it. Well...

330
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,445
...we darn sure know it
and we're not home.

331
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,571
So I say you, me and your friends...

332
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,371
...we take the boat.
We can go fishing every day.

333
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,161
And if there's still a mess on the island,
we can go clean it up ourselves.

334
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,529
Dad, please. I'm not into fishing.

335
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,691
And cleanup? You're way too old
to be doing that kind of work.

336
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,968
I'm only 49.

337
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,441
Flint Lockwood, please.

338
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,885
Oh, Flint.

339
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,286
There's... Could you
come to the door, please?

340
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,363
I think it's that monkey
in your poster.

341
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,011
What? No!

342
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,600
Barb?

343
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,241
<i>Good day.</i>

344
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,768
<i>I'm afraid I have something
very important to discuss...</i>

345
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,922
<i>...with you.</i>

346
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,002
<i>Live Corp.</i>

347
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,891
Chester V wants to see me?

348
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,561
Follow me.

349
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,841
Young Lockwood.

350
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,969
Chester V. Sir.

351
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,369
I can explain everything.

352
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,682
I thought I was gonna meet
the real Chester V.

353
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,887
You are.

354
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,844
- Oh, not me.
- Him.

355
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,326
Yes, it's me.

356
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,130
Sorry about that.

357
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,770
My holograms and I were having
an urgent brainstorming session.

358
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,805
Mr. V! You're real!

359
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,010
I'm so excited to get this opportunity
to show you my inventions.

360
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,608
Hold on. Hold on. That's not
why I brought you here tonight.

361
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,081
Our cleanup operation
back on Swallow Falls...

362
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,244
...has met with
unexpected complications.

363
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,521
This is a photograph...

364
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,524
...before we began our cleanup.

365
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,364
And this was three days ago.

366
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,891
It gets worse, Flint.

367
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,322
<i>There's only two of us left.
We need help.</i>

368
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,682
What is that thing?

369
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,246
Cheesy.

370
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,126
It appears to be
a living cheeseburger...

371
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,569
...with french fry legs
and sesame seed eyes.

372
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,211
Living food?

373
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,125
Oh, no. This could only mean
one thing.

374
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,125
The FLDSMDFR
survived the explosion...

375
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,528
...and it's still operating.

376
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,331
This is what worries me most.

377
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,361
They're trying to learn to swim.

378
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,571
If they succeed and...

379
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,211
...get to the mainland...

380
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,600
...they will destroy monuments
all around the world...

381
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,920
...including the one monument...

382
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,287
...your food storm didn't destroy.

383
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,002
Not Lady Liberty! I've gotta destroy
the FLDSMDFR. But how?

384
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,244
Well, my Thinkquanauts
have invented...

385
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,083
...this.

386
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,286
The BS-USB.

387
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,442
Or BSUSB.

388
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,564
A Bifurcating Systematic
Universal Stop Button!

389
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,280
Precisely. It would destroy
the machine...

390
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,244
...and everything it created.

391
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,611
But we cannot find your FLDSMDFR.

392
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,365
We've searched everywhere...

393
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,522
...and failed.

394
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,651
Chester, I'll find the machine.
I invented it. I can fix this!

395
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,211
Brilliant!

396
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,171
But are you sure you want to
take this on alone?

397
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,970
Yes! Wait, did you say "alone"?

398
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,571
Alone it is, then.

399
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,805
If you succeed, you'll be more
than just a Thinkquanaut.

400
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,486
You'll be my hero.

401
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,881
Your hero?

402
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,168
Yes, my hero.

403
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,368
Your mission must be kept a secret.

404
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,887
We don't wanna create
a worldwide panic.

405
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,647
You mustn't tell anyone, not even
your closest friends and family.

406
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,411
Sir, I won't tell a soul.

407
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,684
Sam! Sam, Sam, Sam!
I gotta tell you a secret! Sam!

408
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,810
Big news. I'm going to Swallow Falls
to destroy the FLDSMDFR...

409
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,804
...which is creating
deadly food monsters...

410
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,362
...which are trying to learn to swim
so they can attack Lady Liberty!

411
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,367
Sam?

412
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,125
Wait, you're doing this alone?

413
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,126
Yeah. Please don't tell Dad. If he finds
out I'm going back to Swallow Falls...

414
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,328
...he's gonna wanna come too.

415
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,085
Well, I'm coming.

416
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,563
What? No! I promised Chester V
I would go alone.

417
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,925
There's no talking you out of this?

418
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,082
- Nope.
- Wait.

419
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,324
Sam, it's gonna be deadly dangerous
with a good chance of death.

420
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,170
And that's why we'll need help.

421
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,406
Triple decaf mochaccino-boba-latte...

422
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,603
...with skim soy and nutmeg sprinkle?

423
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,729
I'd like to order something strong.

424
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,769
Wait your turn, fancy pants.

425
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,728
Flint Lockwood...

426
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,200
...and Sam Sparks!

427
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,410
And Steve too!

428
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,809
- Juicy!
- Earl, we need your help.

429
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,884
Swallow Falls is overrun
with deadly food monsters.

430
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,729
Hey...

431
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,089
- ...where's my coffee?
- Coffee? I'm not a barista...

432
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,287
...I'm a polista!

433
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,161
Let's ride!

434
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,721
Can I come too, Dad?

435
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,807
Son, you are my beautiful,
precious little angel.

436
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,122
But I cannot let you come with me.

437
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,567
Not until you get
your first chest hair.

438
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,560
I have chest hair.

439
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,441
It's just like mine.

440
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,642
Wait a minute.

441
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,484
That's not a chest hair.

442
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,406
That's cupcake frosting.

443
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,449
Tell your mom
I'm getting our home back.

444
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,646
What's up?

445
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,246
Sponge.

446
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,402
Forceps.

447
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,721
A swab.

448
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,962
Manny. We need your help.

449
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,321
I can drop everything.

450
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,482
Camera.

451
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,251
<i>Chick 'n' sushi
Get it while it's cold</i>

452
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,562
Yo, Chicken Brent!

453
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,807
In the flesh.

454
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,960
Swallow Falls is in trouble.
Will you help us?

455
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,921
You bet I will. I just need someone
to cover my shift.

456
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,764
Thanks, tree.

457
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,527
<i>Okay, gang.</i>

458
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,401
We'll be traveling to the island
using my Grocery Deliverator!

459
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,565
All right, who wants to go first?

460
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,448
Hungry.

461
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,523
Yes, Steve, hungry for adventure.

462
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,408
See you on the island,
my brave lab partner.

463
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,243
Afraid!

464
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,604
It worked!

465
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,889
Banana! Banana! Banana! Steve!

466
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,127
I guess it only works on food.
I gotta fix that.

467
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,450
Ahoy there, skipper, my boy.

468
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,205
- Dad.
- Mr. Lockwood?

469
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,608
Dad, no. How did you know
we were here?

470
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,240
I could see you from the apartment.

471
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,850
Flint, if you're going home, so am I.

472
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,804
The island's gonna be
very dangerous...

473
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,085
I was born on the island, and I wanna
die on that island, just like your mom.

474
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,161
Besides, I know that place like
the inside of a tackle box. I wanna help.

475
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,084
- No!
- Flint, let him help.

476
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,481
The man does have a boat.

477
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,967
Which is twice as many boats
as we have.

478
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,650
Fine. But we'll get there faster...

479
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,360
...if we use the Grocery Deliverator.

480
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,367
Steve!

481
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,525
Okay, okay, we'll take the boat!

482
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,487
Shoving off!

483
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,404
<i>Ninety-nine buckets of chum on a boat</i>

484
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,527
<i>Ninety-nine buckets</i>

485
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,647
<i>Of chum</i>

486
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,528
<i>Nineteen buckets of chum on a boat</i>

487
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,649
<i>Nineteen buckets of chum</i>

488
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,450
<i>You hold your nose</i>

489
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,160
<i>And out one goes
There's 18 buckets of chum on a boat</i>

490
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,767
We'll be there in two flaps
of a sardine's fluke!

491
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,641
Thanks, Dad!

492
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,207
Okay, when we land at Swallow Falls...

493
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,647
...our first objective is to get to my lab.

494
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,890
I can use my old computer to pinpoint
the FLDSMDFR's location.

495
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,603
Once we find it, we can shut it down...

496
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,525
...with the utterly irreplaceable BS-USB.

497
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,051
What if you don't find it?

498
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,204
I have to. It's my machine.

499
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,131
If the world gets destroyed
by these, it's my fault.

500
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,121
I can't let that happen.

501
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,367
Land ho!

502
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,329
Land ho!

503
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,968
If we work together,
this should be easy as...

504
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,809
Pie.

505
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,047
Oh, no! We're...

506
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,963
Toast!

507
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,565
French toast!

508
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,205
This is totally...

509
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,123
Bananas!

510
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,806
I was gonna say "nuts,"
but now I'm afraid to.

511
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,849
- Home!
- No! Steve, wait!

512
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,889
The jungle's no place for a monkey.

513
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,283
Home, home, home!

514
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,091
Manny, are you getting this?

515
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,084
- I certainly am.
- Flint.

516
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,402
Look! The climate
has shifted dramatically...

517
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,086
...to allow this much vegetation
to grow!

518
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,171
Sam! Ratbirds!

519
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,049
Okay, then. All ashore
that's going ashore.

520
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,926
Dad, this place is really dangerous.

521
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,687
I'd feel better if you stayed here
on the boat where it's safe.

522
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,645
Safe? I wanna help.

523
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,323
I'd never forgive myself if you
got eaten by a cheespider.

524
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,244
He's right, Tim Lockwood.

525
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,926
Don't worry, we'll get your home back.

526
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,721
Well, fine.

527
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,965
Thanks, Dad. We'll try to be back
before suppertime, okay?

528
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,046
Sure.

529
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,210
Look what's happened to our town.

530
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,487
Look.

531
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,681
There's my angel son...

532
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,245
...Cal's old preschool.

533
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,805
My old van.

534
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,211
Look! An old thing
that I've never seen before!

535
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,249
That's where...

536
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,000
...the Thinkquanauts were
attacked by a cheespider.

537
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,001
It's like a cheesy spider web,
made of...

538
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,760
...cheese. Let's get out of here!

539
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,651
No, wait. What if there's
a survivor in there?

540
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,245
Stand back, everybody.

541
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,687
I'm gonna cut the cheese.

542
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,206
That was the cheese.

543
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,690
Hello? Anybody in here?

544
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,728
Sorry.

545
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,083
That is the biggest strawberry
I've ever seen in my life.

546
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,051
- Is it heavy?
- Yeah. But other than that...

547
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,285
...it looks like a perfectly normal,
fresh, delicious strawberry.

548
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,131
N-woo?

549
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,802
N-woo?

550
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,963
It's moving!

551
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,641
Oh, that was a close one.

552
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,087
You got a little someone
stuck to your pants.

553
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,081
Get it off! Get it off me! Sam! Sam!

554
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,044
Hey, wait, wait. Stop!

555
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,483
Sam, don't touch it! Put it down!
Put it down!

556
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,210
Look at him.

557
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,761
Seriously?

558
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,730
I think I'll name him Barry!

559
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,725
Okay, Sam, could you please
put "Barry" down?

560
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,804
Look, we have to get to the FLDSMDFR
so we can shut it down...

561
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,964
...with this utterly irreplaceable
BS-USB.

562
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,089
Hey! That's not for you!

563
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,448
I need that. Please?

564
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,125
That BS-USB is really important.

565
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,367
N-woo?

566
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,329
- N-woo. Yes.
- N-woo?

567
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,450
Hi, N-woo. Hey, you wanna
hand it to me, buddy?

568
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,801
I beg you.

569
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,451
Please?

570
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,326
Please?

571
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,243
N-woo.

572
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,528
N-woo, N-woo. Yes. Yes. There you go.

573
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,926
No!

574
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,929
Don't let him get away!

575
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,086
Stop!

576
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,685
Stop!

577
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,887
Gotcha.

578
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,250
- N-woo?
- Here, you take it, you take it.

579
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,047
You're gonna have to carry him
until he passes the BS-USB.

580
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,601
And by "pass," you mean...

581
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,569
Yes. Look, we better get a move on...

582
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,121
...before we run into any more
of these creatures.

583
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,047
It's so beautiful.

584
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,647
It's enough to make a grown man cry.

585
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,166
But not this man.

586
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,249
Get back in there, tear.

587
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,960
Wow, I can't believe
the FLDSMDFR created...

588
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,210
...all of this.

589
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,565
Where's Barry?

590
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,048
Just a little bit closer.
I can get him.

591
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,486
Come on, Earl, faster.

592
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,646
- Look at the mangos.
- You mean flamingos.

593
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,887
Flamangos!

594
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,531
There's a bunch of shrimp!

595
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,290
They look like chimpanzees.

596
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,090
- Shrimpanzees!
- Shrimpanzees!

597
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,209
Those are some
tasty-looking jellyfish!

598
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,091
What's that one over there?

599
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,606
That's just a tomato.

600
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,681
Barry!

601
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,160
Come on!

602
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,851
Chester gave me that BS-USB.

603
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,525
It's really important.

604
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,851
- Shrimpanzee.
- Steve.

605
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,047
- Shrimpanzee.
- Steve.

606
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,049
- Shrimpanzee.
- Shove.

607
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,447
Steve.

608
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,920
There's a leek in the boat!

609
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,160
Hold on, everyone.

610
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,970
This ain't gonna be no picnic.

611
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,765
Stop! Get back here!

612
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,720
Keep it steady, Earl.

613
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,365
Watermelophants!

614
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,643
Barry, grab my hand!

615
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,120
Barry!

616
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,921
Freeze, berry man.

617
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,201
Thanks, Earl.

618
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,608
Okay, come here.

619
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,810
You have caused enough trouble
for one day.

620
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,167
Susheep!

621
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,287
Cantalopes.

622
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,045
I can't believe your machine...

623
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,247
...reprogrammed itself to create...

624
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,848
...this entire ecosystem of living food.

625
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,401
How is that even possible?

626
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,165
I have no idea.

627
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,970
Best we don't think about it.

628
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,884
The world should know about this.

629
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,964
Manny, is your camera still working?

630
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,365
<i>Of course. I've been rolling...</i>

631
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,483
<i>- ...since we landed.</i>
- So much for...

632
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
...keeping this a secret.

633
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,242
We can't let these friends
tell the world anything.

634
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,602
What we need to do is go there...

635
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,083
...and separate Flint from his friends
so we can manage...

636
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,247
...the situation.

637
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,686
- Champion!
- Brilliant idea.

638
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,604
- Way to go, Chester.
- Thank you.

639
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,810
- Barb, you take care of that weather girl.
- But, sir...

640
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,320
...I'm a scientist.

641
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,249
That's why I need you.

642
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,451
I want the same brilliant mind
that solved the unified field theory...

643
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,081
...to help me help Live Corp.

644
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,880
Consider it done, sir.

645
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,121
Good monkey.

646
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,771
To the Helpicopter.

647
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,203
Oh, Earl.

648
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,202
Pull over there.

649
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,488
- Duck!
- Duck? I love...

650
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,727
Yeah!

651
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,405
You guys, that wasn't so bad.

652
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,722
Yeah, well, be thankful
we didn't run into a...

653
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,127
Cheespider!

654
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,047
Run!

655
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,401
Cheesy. Cheesy. Cheesy.

656
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,571
Manny!

657
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,845
Wait for me!

658
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,649
I'm glad you still wearing
that diaper.

659
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,928
I wish I brought a fresh one!

660
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,569
Hey, guys! Down this alley!

661
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,686
Oh, no! Dead end.

662
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,842
Ghost man?

663
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,845
<i>Greetings, and namaste.</i>

664
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,890
- Chester V! You're here!
- That's right...

665
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,407
...young Lockwood.
And by the looks of things...

666
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,289
...just in time.

667
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,524
One minute later, and we
would have been food for that food.

668
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,765
Flint, I thought you said you were
going to complete this mission alone.

669
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,166
Can I say something?

670
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,640
Apparently you can.

671
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,570
This is Barb, my number two.

672
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,370
Why are you carrying...

673
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,241
...a strawberry in
your backpack, miss?

674
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,647
Stand back, everyone!

675
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,888
Hey, hey, hey, stop.
You're scaring him.

676
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,246
Scaring him?

677
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,643
Oh, please, it's probably
got a mouth full of fangs.

678
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,930
Now you're scaring me.

679
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,925
I've been carrying him
and he hasn't hurt anyone.

680
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,845
I'm sorry. Are you a scientist?

681
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,162
- Matter of fact, I am.
- She's a meteorologist.

682
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,283
Meteorology. Oh, I love it.

683
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,411
The science of smiling and having
pretty hair while you point at a map.

684
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,802
- It's a very important job...
- Meteorology is...

685
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,641
- ...a comprehensive analysis...
- Ladies, ladies. Please.

686
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,566
I'm sure we can all agree
that one of you is a scientist.

687
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,168
Young Lockwood...

688
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,325
...why was your lady friend carrying this
rabid little strawberry in her backpack?

689
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,882
Why is the strawberry guy in
the backpack? Well, that's funny.

690
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,409
It's... You know what he did?

691
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,526
He... He ate the BS-USB.

692
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,206
Not the BSUSB.

693
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,208
I'm on it.

694
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,720
She's got a knife!

695
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,962
If you touch a leaf on his head...

696
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,526
Step away from the berry, madam.

697
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,367
That orange hairy lady
scared the jam out of him!

698
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,880
N-woo?

699
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,164
Oh, no, it's jammed.

700
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,243
- Lick. Lick. Lick.
- Oh, thanks, Steve.

701
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,606
Young Lockwood.

702
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,569
The world could've been destroyed...

703
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,242
...because of the actions
of one sinister strawberry.

704
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,529
We cannot allow any more mistakes
like this.

705
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,042
It won't...

706
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,487
...be long before
those malicious melons...

707
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,640
...pernicious pickles...

708
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,051
...and belligerent burgers
learn to swim...

709
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,963
...and make their way...

710
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,201
...to the mainland.

711
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,329
What is...

712
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,364
...your plan?

713
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,451
I need to get back to my lab so I can...

714
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,330
...make contact with the FLDSMDFR.

715
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,005
- Brilliant!
- I'll lead the way.

716
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,601
No, we'll lead the way.

717
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,205
Safe, safe, safe.

718
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,886
I believe my Sentinels of Safety...

719
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,051
...are better equipped to lead us
in their robe-suits.

720
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,649
N-woo?

721
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,089
"I'll be back...

722
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,287
...before supper."

723
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,965
What a bunch of baloney.

724
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,168
Just leave me on the boat
without any food.

725
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,447
I know a place where
I can get something to eat.

726
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,247
There she is.

727
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,921
Home sweet home.

728
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,529
What?

729
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,281
There's no sardines?

730
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,442
Had to be looters.

731
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,566
Vintage Baby Brent.

732
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,247
Oh, chum.

733
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,284
No, no!

734
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,091
Yeah.

735
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,131
I like them too. I do. I love them.

736
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,731
Mine. No, no. Mine.

737
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,490
Off. Off. Mine.

738
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,451
No, no, mine. Mine. Off.

739
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,963
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, you guys.
Come on, you could lose an eye.

740
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,731
Look, I tell you what. You want more
sardines? I can get you more sardines.

741
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,764
Hey, thanks for loaning me
these skinny jeans, Flint.

742
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,526
- Those aren't skinny jeans.
- Nope.

743
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,367
My feet are turning purple.
Is that bad?

744
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,324
Bananostrich!

745
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,009
Go, go, go! Come on, Brent!

746
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,844
Banana! Banana! Banana!

747
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,285
That bunch of bananostriches
nearly split us.

748
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,087
Are you okay?

749
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,161
Oh, my gosh.

750
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,521
My house!

751
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,443
Home, home, home!

752
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,330
Oh, my gosh.

753
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,925
Your lab!

754
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,486
Oh, crap balls.

755
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,688
We can't go up there, Flint Lockwood.

756
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,122
That dangly, upsy-downsy lab's
not to code.

757
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,362
I've got to, if I'm gonna find
the FLDSMDFR.

758
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,726
We can do it. Those...

759
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,280
...load-bearing vines will be able
to support a small team.

760
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,925
Onwards and upwards!

761
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,969
Right, sir. To the lab!

762
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,409
Sentinels, keep the locals safe.

763
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,961
I'll keep them safe.

764
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,362
Hey, guys! Where you going?
Guys! Hey...

765
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,647
...wait for me!

766
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,651
A little help?

767
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,567
Spooky.

768
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,650
Spooky is right, Steve.

769
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,126
I say...

770
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,365
...this laboratory of yours
is a wonder of engineering.

771
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,801
Really?

772
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,326
Thank you, sir.

773
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,090
Initiating backup power.

774
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,966
<i>Welcome, Flint.</i>

775
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,690
Whoa, my computer's dead.

776
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,125
The fate of the world is depending
on us. Think, Lockwood.

777
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,364
Well, if I could pull...

778
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,720
...the hard drive, there's enough
equipment in this...

779
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,167
...lab that I could build
a tracking device.

780
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,323
Flint!

781
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,208
I say, young Lockwood,
what extraordinary...

782
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,487
...underpants.

783
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,610
Thank you, sir. They're
my Wedgie-proof underwear.

784
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,644
I invented them when I was 6.

785
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,764
I had no idea we were so alike.

786
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,889
Except I invented mine...

787
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,963
...when I was 3.

788
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,009
You guys have been wearing the same
underwear since you were kids?

789
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,566
- Yes!
- Yes!

790
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,881
Excuse me.

791
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,248
How do you expect us
to get the hard drive...

792
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,648
...with all that electrified water?

793
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,005
We dangle!

794
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,487
Come, Lockwood, give the monkey
your underpants.

795
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,687
What?

796
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,443
Lay on...

797
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,603
...young Lockwood.

798
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,007
Yes!

799
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,928
You know, hanging from
my underpants in this space...

800
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,049
...brings back so many memories.

801
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,726
I too built my lab up high...

802
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,849
...to keep the bullies out!

803
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:31,929
You were...

804
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,170
You were bullied too?

805
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,487
Absolutely.

806
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,491
People like us...

807
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,290
...are always bullied.

808
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,882
Sometimes I wish I'd kept
my bullies around.

809
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,888
Really?

810
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,640
So I could crush them
with my success.

811
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,689
Just like you did with that man-baby.

812
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,251
You mean Brent?

813
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,165
Sure, he used to be a bully,
but he's my friend now.

814
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,208
Friend?

815
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,285
A bully can never be your friend.

816
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,926
- Never?
- Remember...

817
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,845
...the ancient Chinese proverb:

818
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,522
"Stew offered by a bully
is poisoned broth."

819
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,091
Wow, stew.

820
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,970
I have so much to learn.

821
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,371
Mission accomplished!

822
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,922
Indeed, young Lockwood. Indeed.

823
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,526
Help!

824
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,249
Help! Come on, guys. Get me ou...!

825
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,840
You okay, Earl?

826
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,321
My chest hairs
have been tingling all day.

827
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,562
Don't worry. Live Corp Sentinels...

828
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,162
...have danger-sensing fibers
built into their chest plates.

829
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,170
Bravo, Lockwood.

830
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,971
With luck, we'll survive the night.

831
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,368
Sounds like midnight snacks.

832
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,126
Dr. Manny! This is delicious!

833
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,488
I call it Manny's Gorilla Stew.

834
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,529
So how do you make a gorilla stew?

835
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,569
You keep it waiting for two hours.

836
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,410
Hey, guys. Oh, that smells good.

837
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,928
Hey, Flint! Wanna try some of this
special stew? I saved you a bowl.

838
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,169
It's killer.

839
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,606
Killer stew.

840
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,289
No!

841
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,840
Thank you...

842
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,726
...Brent.

843
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,649
Ever since that ghost man
showed up...

844
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,962
- ...Flint Lockwood's been acting...
- Jerky.

845
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,605
He rejected my stew.

846
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,161
No one has ever rejected my stew.

847
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,649
I'm gonna go talk to him.

848
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,928
- Flint, wait up.
- Yeah, Sam?

849
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,441
Is something wrong?

850
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,045
Yeah, we blew a fuse.

851
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,725
You blew a fuse.

852
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,367
Why are you being so weird
to your friends?

853
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,250
What? I haven't been weird.

854
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,323
You karate-chopped...

855
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,211
...Manny's stew out of Brent's hands.

856
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,805
You hurt their feelings.

857
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,042
Sam, you wouldn't understand.

858
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,285
I do understand,
but you're forgetting that:

859
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,925
"A bully turned friend
will be friend to the end."

860
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,645
Listen, Brent came here to help you.

861
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,086
We all did.

862
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,323
And you're acting like
we're just in your way.

863
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,007
Remember, we work together.

864
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,161
That weather girl is ruining our plan.

865
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,050
I just need more time, sir.

866
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,441
We don't have more time.

867
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,570
If we don't get the FLDSMDFR
in the next 48 hours...

868
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,690
...we'll miss our deadline
to release Food Bar 8.0.

869
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,160
I'll be a laughingstock!

870
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,568
Sir, let me handle this.

871
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,883
Never send a monkey
to do Chester work.

872
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,685
I'll take care of it.

873
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,686
Okay, guys, we're here.

874
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,688
Hey, hey, hey!

875
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,564
That is not for you.

876
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,010
All right, let's get to it.

877
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,888
Okay.

878
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,121
You got this, right?

879
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,123
Okay. Then you wanna put
one of these on there, like that.

880
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,488
No, no, no.

881
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,405
No, don't eat that. That's bad.
You'll hurt yourself.

882
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,371
Hey, hey, easy! Stop picking
on your brother, will you?

883
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,728
How would you like it
if he was shoving you?

884
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,325
Okay, now watch.

885
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,281
Are you watching?
One and two and three!

886
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,444
Catch the big one!

887
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,486
Yeah, good, huh?

888
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,042
It's called fishing.

889
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,650
<i>Out on my boat</i>

890
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,848
<i>With a pickle that likes dill</i>

891
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,923
<i>The frowny one's sour</i>

892
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,242
<i>He's a real bitter pill</i>

893
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,409
<i>She's so sweet</i>

894
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,847
<i>With her onion pet Pearl</i>

895
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,690
<i>Teaching pickles to fish</i>

896
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,321
<i>That's my crazy world</i>

897
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,040
I tell you, if only Flint liked fishing
as much as you guys.

898
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,004
Why am I talking to a pickle?

899
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,282
Dangerous food creatures detected.

900
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,000
Stay put. We'll find and destroy them.

901
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,366
Barry!

902
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,926
You can't be here.

903
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,961
You better hide him.

904
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,400
Okay, gang! Today's the day...

905
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,244
...We find the FLDSMDFR.

906
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,570
Sam, I was thinking about
what you said last night...

907
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,449
N-woo?

908
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,283
What?

909
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,681
Me too.

910
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,888
Right. Listen, I have...

911
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,606
...been acting weird, but it's only because
I'm under a lot of pressure.

912
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,807
- N-woo?
- What?

913
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,366
So true!

914
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,490
But I'm also doing this for us.
You see...

915
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,008
...I still want Sparkswood
to happen, but it can't.

916
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,686
Not until I become a great inventor
like Chester V.

917
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,406
Flint, you don't have to
prove anything...

918
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,570
Lockwood! How goes the inventing?

919
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,726
Very good, sir. I was up all night
making this.

920
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,042
I call it the Flint Lockwood
Food Jungle...

921
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,362
...Topographical Pointing Machine.

922
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,881
- Or...
- The FLFJTPM! Brilliant!

923
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,771
Oh, thank you, sir. Follow the beam,
find the machine.

924
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,883
All I have to do now...

925
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,804
...is cut the leg holes.

926
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,122
Well...

927
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,362
...maybe it's better...

928
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,601
...here.

929
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,361
Great idea, Sam.

930
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,450
And, guys, you can help me by...

931
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,002
Excuse us. Your friends are
distracting you from our mission.

932
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,889
Distracting?

933
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,605
My chest hairs just
don't trust that Chester.

934
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,247
We should be hunting
the FLDSMDFR, not chitchatting.

935
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,288
But, sir, I...

936
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,285
You're heading into the deepest,
darkest part of the jungle.

937
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,126
You need to focus on
saving the world.

938
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,647
Be a hero.

939
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,530
Okay. You're right, sir.

940
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,161
Excellent! Let's go!

941
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,724
Okay, Barry, time to go home now.

942
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,687
Okay. Okay.
Okay, one more hug, Barry.

943
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,842
Barry?

944
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,122
Right! Barry.

945
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,930
You Barry.

946
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,082
Barry.

947
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,164
And I'm Sam Sparks.

948
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,326
- Saspa.
- Right! Sam...

949
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,130
- Come on, Sam!
- Coming!

950
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,170
Okay, Barry, time to go home now.
Now go.

951
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,927
Now you go on home.

952
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,361
Bye.

953
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,651
Saspa?

954
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,884
Hot dog. Hot dog.

955
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,847
Tacodile! Supreme!

956
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,730
Holy guacamole!

957
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,086
I got this, bro!

958
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,885
I'm okay!

959
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,929
Up there! Hurry, Sam!

960
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,407
Barb!

961
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,001
You Okay?

962
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,281
Freeze!

963
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,281
Come on, let's go!
Let's get out of here!

964
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,367
Bravo, young Lockwood, bravo!

965
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,769
A mother?

966
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,962
Sam!

967
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,286
Saspa!

968
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,561
Butter.

969
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,211
Parkay.

970
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,010
Almost there.

971
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,525
The FLDSMDFR
should be just across...

972
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,484
...this syrup bog.
- This is syrup?

973
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,049
Syrup is my favorite.

974
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,328
Darn mosquitoasts!

975
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,162
Don't worry, man-baby.

976
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,251
They, like all the other
abominable food monsters...

977
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,329
...will soon be no more.

978
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,607
Wait, Flint!

979
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,601
What if we're making a big mistake?

980
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,406
Mistake?

981
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,642
About shutting off the FLDSMDFR.

982
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,850
Some of these creatures,
they're incredible.

983
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,848
Incredibly...

984
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,010
...dangerous. We were just
attacked by a giant tacodile.

985
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,323
He's right, Sam. I mean, we were
almost eaten by a cheespider.

986
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,450
It doesn't mean we have to
destroy all of them.

987
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,371
Some of the food's
actually been friendly.

988
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,849
It is true. The dessert creatures
are especially sweet.

989
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,083
Okay. Maybe we...

990
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,682
Mosquitoast!

991
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,763
Was gonna bite you.

992
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,651
See? Even the tiniest creatures
are attacking us.

993
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,688
The only reason they're...

994
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,161
...biting is because of the drop
in barometric pressure.

995
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,569
Bugs do that before a storm. And by
the look of those nimbostratus clouds...

996
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,405
Miss Sparks, we are...

997
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,369
...not talking about the weather.

998
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,410
We are talking about food here.

999
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,122
Dangerous food that does not
have human emotion.

1000
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,328
Food that is not friendly.

1001
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,087
- Food that cannot love!
- Flint...

1002
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,642
...we should be studying
the food animals, not killing them.

1003
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,445
What if he's wrong?

1004
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,249
The choice is yours, son.

1005
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,369
Live up to your full potential...

1006
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,768
...or walk away
and let the food monsters...

1007
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,241
...destroy Lady Liberty.

1008
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,167
Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR...

1009
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,124
...and saving the world...

1010
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,687
...that's what matters.

1011
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,764
Really? Our opinion doesn't matter?

1012
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,047
Of course it does!

1013
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,209
Yes! Yes, it matters.

1014
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,807
But just not right now.

1015
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,560
- Wrong answer.
- Toast.

1016
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,883
Yeah? Well, I guess
this doesn't matter either...

1017
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,884
...young Lockwood.

1018
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,008
I'll just...

1019
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,446
...see you back on the boat.

1020
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,490
Wait! Sam!

1021
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,091
Wait, please!

1022
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,448
No! No. Sam! Come back!

1023
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,370
Come back, Sam, no!

1024
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,051
No, Sam!

1025
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,442
Sam! Sam!

1026
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,220
Sam!

1027
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,570
Hey, Earl, would you talk to her?

1028
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,847
You bet I will.

1029
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,122
Hey, Sam! Wait for me!

1030
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,883
Goodbye, Senor Lockwood.

1031
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,082
Bye, Flint.

1032
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,560
Steve!

1033
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,484
Et tu, Steve?

1034
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,007
What just happened?

1035
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,003
You've made...

1036
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,401
...the right choice, son.

1037
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,570
Sentinels! Keep them safe.

1038
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,685
Butter.

1039
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,329
Young Lockwood...

1040
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,564
...we're getting close.
I feel it in my beard!

1041
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,924
Water goes in the top...

1042
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,845
...and food comes out the bottom.

1043
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,040
It's gotta be inside that
big rock candy mountain!

1044
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,528
This is exactly why I wanted you
on this mission.

1045
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,928
Sally forth, Lockwood.

1046
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,884
I can't believe Flint
is still listening to that guy!

1047
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,726
Flint is naive. It appears
he is being manipulated...

1048
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,564
...for some nefarious purpose.

1049
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,689
Of course he is!

1050
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,126
Sam! Freeze!

1051
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,322
What?

1052
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,325
Stay calm and walk toward me...

1053
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,642
...slowly.

1054
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,089
Very slowly.

1055
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,324
Oh, come on.
Now you're acting weird.

1056
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,050
I'm in no mood for this.

1057
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,090
Stop right there, cheese monster!

1058
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,845
Nobody eats my friends...

1059
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,366
...on my watch!

1060
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,329
No, wait! Chester's been lying to us...

1061
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,682
...about these creatures,
and I am going to prove it.

1062
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,649
Sam, don't do it!

1063
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,848
It's foodicide!

1064
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,931
Danger! Danger! Danger!

1065
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,531
Nice cheespider.

1066
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,360
- Yellow.
- Dude!

1067
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,171
You got special-sauced!

1068
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,442
It's okay, guys. See?

1069
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,125
She's not mean. She's just...

1070
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,691
...a little beefy.

1071
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,161
What's it doing?

1072
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,846
I think she wants you
to scratch her buns.

1073
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,366
I like that too.

1074
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,244
Who's a good cheespider?

1075
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,961
She's cute!

1076
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,884
But why did she attack us before?

1077
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,690
Because we were dressed...

1078
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,046
...like them.

1079
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,961
She doesn't like backpacks?

1080
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,086
No. It appears she...

1081
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,441
...doesn't like Live Corp.

1082
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,887
The food creatures know something...

1083
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,082
...we do not.

1084
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,728
Gasp!

1085
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,240
Who's Evel?

1086
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,926
Not "Evel." Evil.

1087
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,130
I knew it! Chester's
up to something terrible.

1088
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,407
We have to warn Flint!

1089
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,368
Let's ride!

1090
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,568
Run!

1091
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,447
You're not warning...

1092
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,529
...anyone about anything.

1093
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,444
Oh, crap balls.

1094
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,046
Magnificent.

1095
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,049
The FLDSMDFR...

1096
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,566
...must be up there.

1097
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,327
A very unpleasant fall.

1098
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,040
Finish the job, Lockwood.

1099
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,566
Yes, sir.

1100
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,011
Made it!

1101
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,246
FLDSMDFR.

1102
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,208
Look, I'm sorry I have to
do this to you...

1103
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,606
...again.

1104
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,844
But I can't let your swimming
cheespiders destroy Lady Liberty...

1105
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:05,729
...or the world.

1106
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,649
<i>Marshmallow.</i>

1107
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:39,923
They're like...

1108
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,525
...a family.

1109
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,684
Sam was right.

1110
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,127
This is a mistake.

1111
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,722
Oh, dear!

1112
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,883
- Sir! Sir?
- There it is.

1113
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,208
- Wait.
- In all its glory.

1114
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,320
Chester, look, I can't do this.

1115
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,647
Oh, okay. I will.

1116
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,847
What? Wait.

1117
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,089
Chester, wait. We can't destroy it.

1118
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,044
Let go of me, Lockwood.

1119
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,448
No, sir, I can't let you do this.

1120
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,761
No! No! No!

1121
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,167
<i>Live Corp.</i>

1122
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,050
The BS-USB...

1123
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,566
...reprogrammed it?

1124
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,649
It was never gonna
turn off the machine.

1125
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,402
A BS-USB? Hello.

1126
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,923
Your machine is what I wanted
all along.

1127
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,851
You lied to me.

1128
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,525
Of course I lied to you.

1129
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,969
I knew you'd eventually fall
for these pathetic creatures.

1130
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,763
But you were my idol.

1131
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,005
My whole life, I looked up to you.
I wanted to be you!

1132
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,091
Oh, Lockwood. I was just using you...

1133
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,810
...to get your invention.

1134
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:17,967
We're ready.

1135
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,242
Launch Operation Slice and Dice.

1136
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,404
And now that I've got what I want,
I no longer need you.

1137
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,729
I'm afraid we're going to have to
let you go.

1138
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,281
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, please.

1139
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,531
That's not natural.

1140
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,761
No, no, no.

1141
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,361
Easy, easy, you guys. Don't cry.

1142
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,002
Okay, Steve. If me and you put
our two brilliant minds together...

1143
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,890
...we will get out of here.

1144
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,088
- Steve?
- Brent, do you ever get...

1145
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,369
...the feeling that maybe Steve Lockwood
is just a monkey?

1146
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,325
Why would you say that
about him, Earl?

1147
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,126
Why would you ever say that?

1148
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,081
Of course he's just a monkey.
How stupid are you people?

1149
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,648
No one should ever put
any trust in a monkey.

1150
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,803
Chester thinks you're a monkey.

1151
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,771
Well, I'm an ape. Chester knows that.

1152
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,208
But he calls you a monkey.

1153
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,080
It is true, he does.

1154
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,004
He's just joking around.

1155
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,686
Chester's my best friend.

1156
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,405
If Chester was really your friend...

1157
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,007
...would he still call you a monkey?

1158
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,249
N-woo! N-woo!

1159
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:17,803
Flint.

1160
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,202
Dad.

1161
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,603
What's happening, son?
You look terrible.

1162
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,885
- What's with all of them?
- They saved my life.

1163
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,765
I let Chester steal the machine and now
he's starting Operation Slice and Dice.

1164
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,289
Come on, son. You're really
not making any sense.

1165
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,091
Look, Chester's gonna wipe out
all the foodimals.

1166
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,320
My friends tried to...

1167
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,886
...tell me they were good,
but I didn't listen.

1168
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,288
Everything I touch just gets ruined.

1169
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,522
- N-woo!
- Barry?

1170
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,249
N-woo!

1171
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,285
Barry. I'm so sorry I misjudged you.

1172
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,045
I should have listened to Sam.

1173
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,848
- Saspa. Sam.
- What is it? What are you trying to say?

1174
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,006
Saspa, Saspa.

1175
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,321
Saspa!

1176
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,603
Saspa.

1177
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,330
- Sassy pants.
- Dad.

1178
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,647
Saspa, Saspa!

1179
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,211
Sam and the gang?

1180
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,041
It looks like a Sentinel of Safety.

1181
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,002
Sassy pants.

1182
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,921
Sassy pants? No, Dad. He's saying
Sentinels captured Sam and the gang.

1183
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,241
- And they're being held in the factory?
- We gotta get them out of there.

1184
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,370
But how? There's just two of us.

1185
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,040
N-woo!

1186
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,406
- N-woo!
- N-woo! N-woo!

1187
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,610
- N-woo!
- N-woo!

1188
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,001
N-woo!

1189
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,410
Hey, what's with all the "N-woos"?

1190
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,051
Why do they have my TV?

1191
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,605
<i>Water goes in the top
and food comes out the bottom.</i>

1192
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,805
<i>N-woo! N-woo!</i>

1193
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,040
What's it, broken or something?
What's it doing?

1194
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,009
N-woo!

1195
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,445
Here, you take it, you take it.

1196
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,927
N-woo.

1197
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,687
- It's saying that I'm N-woo.
- N-woo.

1198
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,606
N-woo. N-woo.

1199
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,605
- N-woo.
- Look, Flint, they came here to help.

1200
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,081
We all did. It's time to let us.

1201
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,048
Okay, I don't know
if you can understand me.

1202
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,962
- I know you think I'm N-woo.
- I know you think I'm N-woo.

1203
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,170
But the truth is I'm no N-woo...

1204
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,289
...I'm just a man.

1205
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,281
A man who's made a lot of mistakes
in the last couple of days.

1206
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,725
And now my friends are in
a lot of trouble, thanks to me.

1207
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,250
Someone once told me
that I didn't need friends.

1208
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,807
That I could accomplish more
by myself.

1209
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,725
I know now more than ever...

1210
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,610
...that he was wrong.

1211
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,286
We need all the friends we can get.

1212
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,649
And I need your help.
All of you. Fruits...

1213
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,928
...vegetables and meat!

1214
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,362
I need you to help me
to get into that...

1215
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,090
...factory, save our friends...

1216
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,001
...and get our home back!

1217
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,244
Okay, now I just gotta figure out...

1218
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,209
...how to get in there.

1219
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,330
With the right rod and tackle,
I could cast you up...

1220
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,320
...into that unfinished part
of the factory.

1221
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,965
Should be a piece of cake.

1222
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,604
Dad, let's go fishing.

1223
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,842
Wildebeets!

1224
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,528
Meatballrus! Go, go, go!

1225
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,569
Watermelophant, do your thing!

1226
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,887
Spray-On Shoes.

1227
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,201
Hair Un-Balder.

1228
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,169
Grocery Deliverator.

1229
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,086
Helmet.

1230
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,248
Got it.

1231
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,364
Ready when you are, Dad!

1232
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,807
Ready, skipper, my boy.

1233
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,687
It's too heavy!

1234
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,528
Here comes the cavalry.

1235
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,766
No way! Subs!

1236
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,490
- Subwhales!
- Subwhales!

1237
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,726
Prepare to release lure.

1238
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,762
Hit it, Sweet.

1239
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,484
Catch the big one, buddy.

1240
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,327
Yes!

1241
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,846
We have a problem.

1242
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,841
N-woo, in here.

1243
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,843
What's going on?

1244
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,084
Sam's backpack.

1245
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,767
They were here!

1246
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,801
Good cheespider.

1247
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,246
Saspa?

1248
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,327
Got it, Barry.

1249
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,361
Thanks, cheespider.

1250
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,644
N-woo!

1251
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,527
Barry, use the Grocery Deliverator
to save your friends.

1252
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,609
I'll go save mine.

1253
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,450
There's a leek in my boat.

1254
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,728
Flint!

1255
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,361
Go, go, go!

1256
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,369
Hey...

1257
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,243
...freeze!

1258
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,010
Food fight!

1259
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,450
Crab cakes!

1260
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,643
Run!

1261
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,849
I'm all cheesed up.

1262
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,682
Retreat!

1263
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,689
Retreat!

1264
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,771
<i>Head scan complete.</i>

1265
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,008
Lockwood?

1266
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,566
You're still alive?

1267
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,889
That's right. Hands up.
Give me back my friends.

1268
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,811
Of course! I have them right here.

1269
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,846
Hey, Flint.

1270
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,366
Sam! Guys!

1271
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,931
Chester, let them go!

1272
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,731
Don't worry, Lockwood,
I'll let them go.

1273
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,606
Right into my super-sized
Food Bar machine.

1274
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,371
Food Bars?

1275
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,928
Food Bars? You're going to
turn them into Food Bars?

1276
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,006
Yes, Food Bars.
The lifeblood of my company.

1277
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:59,290
I learned your FLDSMDFR food
is far more delicious than "food" food.

1278
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,409
So using your foodimals
as ingredients...

1279
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,927
...would make my products
super-delicious!

1280
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,043
I had to have your invention.

1281
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,601
Unfortunately, I couldn't find it.

1282
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,806
Until you helped me.

1283
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,645
FLDSMDFR!

1284
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,246
<i>Watermelon!</i>

1285
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,769
You're a monster!
Those are living creatures.

1286
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,161
Yes, that's the problem.

1287
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,611
Food with legs
is much harder to catch.

1288
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,527
They hide, they fight back,
they want to live.

1289
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,240
But now that I control
your FLDSMDFR...

1290
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,366
...I can pave your island
and work in complete secrecy.

1291
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,965
Live Corp will remain...

1292
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,846
...the coolest, hippest company
in the world...

1293
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,009
...with a new Food Bar version...

1294
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,645
...8.0!

1295
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,320
I never should have believed in you.

1296
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,289
Yes, that was quite foolish.

1297
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,081
Now if you want your friends back,
I suggest you drop your cans.

1298
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,051
Don't do it, Flint! Save the island!

1299
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,124
But you are my island.

1300
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,328
Okay, first, shut up.

1301
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,689
Then drop the cans
or I drop your friends.

1302
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,001
Okay, okay. There.

1303
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,246
Oh, no, Flint. This is embarrassing.
I changed my mind.

1304
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,602
Please understand
I can't leave any witnesses.

1305
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,406
Barb, grind them.

1306
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,087
- But, sir, I didn't think we were going to...
- This is why I work alone.

1307
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,202
Monkey!

1308
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,044
You are dismissed.

1309
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,801
And now, without...

1310
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,411
...further ado...

1311
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,240
Flint, hurry!

1312
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,005
Why won't this go faster?

1313
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,210
- Give me that controller!
- Sure, come and get it.

1314
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,806
But which one of us has it?

1315
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:43,962
Is it me?

1316
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,361
Or me?

1317
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,449
Earl...

1318
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,484
...can't you break us out of here?

1319
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,082
Yellow police tape!
The one thing I can't break.

1320
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,690
Forkenknifenspooninator!

1321
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,168
Sam, guys, listen.

1322
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,726
Invisible coffee table!

1323
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,851
I'm sorry I was such an idiot.

1324
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,525
Flint, that's true...

1325
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,728
...but now may not be the time!

1326
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,327
Please let me finish.
I took you all for granted.

1327
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,005
I should have listened to you.

1328
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,641
Okay, go on. But hurry!

1329
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,003
The truth is I need each
and every one of you guys.

1330
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,846
You're more than my friends.
You're my family.

1331
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,807
How sweet. Note to self:
put that on their tombstones.

1332
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,530
Good one, Chester!

1333
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,450
Don't you see, young Lockwood?

1334
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,087
These friends are the reason
you keep losing.

1335
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,607
Well, it's better than ending up
alone like you.

1336
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,080
I'm not alone!

1337
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,851
I've got holograms!

1338
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,527
Flint! Why don't you throw him
a party?

1339
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,727
We love parties.

1340
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,411
Party?

1341
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,161
Party!

1342
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,887
Party's over, Lockwood.

1343
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,047
No!

1344
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,207
Not yet.

1345
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,966
I think it's time to celebrate!

1346
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,290
No!

1347
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,364
Celebrate!

1348
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,008
Yes!

1349
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,444
- Thanks, lab partner.
- Helping!

1350
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,726
Guys, I'm...

1351
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,200
...so sorry for being such a...

1352
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,243
- Chester!
- Okay, I guess I deserve that.

1353
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,369
No, Flint! Chester!

1354
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,167
I've got what I want.
Enjoy your friends, Lockwood.

1355
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,811
No! No!

1356
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,810
Don't do this!

1357
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,402
Food!

1358
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,851
Anybody gonna be keeping
folks safe in this town, it's me.

1359
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,322
Tacodile supreme.

1360
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,368
It's over, Chester.

1361
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,683
- Mustache!
- Now hand over the FLDSMDFR.

1362
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,450
No! Never!

1363
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,602
Chester...

1364
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,405
...there's nowhere to go.

1365
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,325
That's what you think.

1366
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,210
Save me, monkey!

1367
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,371
Rm an ape!

1368
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,329
Bad monkey! Give that back!
Bad monk...!

1369
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,764
My holograms! Save me!

1370
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,922
We're here for you.

1371
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,208
- You're going to be fine.
- We'll save you.

1372
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,006
You see, Flint?
With my holograms...

1373
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,485
Oh, fudge.

1374
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,689
I saved myself.

1375
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,328
That will leave a bad taste
in your mouth.

1376
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,446
I believe this belongs to you.

1377
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,931
Here you go, pal.

1378
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,603
Gosh, I hope this works.

1379
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,127
<i>Pickle.</i>

1380
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,282
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>

1381
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,767
<i>Leek. Strawberry. Lemon.</i>

1382
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,650
- Yes!
- Banana.

1383
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,044
It's enough to make a grown man cry.

1384
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,691
And that's okay.

1385
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,442
You go right ahead, tear.

1386
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,161
Guys...

1387
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,208
...do you think we could still
work together?

1388
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,882
I think we will work great together.

1389
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,885
Come on, bring it on in, Barb.

1390
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,324
This is nice.

1391
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,361
Ape!

1392
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,369
Monkey.

1393
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,091
I'm proud of you, son.

1394
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,446
Thanks, Dad.

1395
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,167
But there's one last thing
I need to do.

1396
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,323
Okay, now, son.
Now, once you put it on like that...

1397
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,284
...all you have to do is cast it.

1398
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,324
So like this?

1399
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,802
No, no, no.
Here, let me show you how.

1400
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,008
See, it's all in the wrist. Like this.

1401
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,648
Catch the big one, boy.

1402
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,609
- Am I fishing?
- Yup.

1403
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,569
I'm fishing!

1404
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,091
You've got a live one.
Now reel him in, Flint.

1405
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,884
That's it. Steady, steady.
He's a fighter!

1406
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,685
I got one!

1407
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,809
- I got one, Dad!
- Okay.

1408
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,290
Can we do this again?
Like all the time?

1409
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,246
You betcha, skipper.

1410
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,444
Sam, guys, I caught my first fish!

1411
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,610
Way to go, Flint!

1412
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,970
Flint Lockwood, you are a fisherman.

1413
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,446
Happy.

1414
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,122
Hey, look, rainbows!

1415
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,281
<i>Strawberry.</i>

1416
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,886
Hi, Steve.

1417
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,001
Hello, Steven. I'm Barb.

1418
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,971
So do you wanna
go get coffee sometime?

1419
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:04,803
Dinner!

1420
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,405
Even better!
