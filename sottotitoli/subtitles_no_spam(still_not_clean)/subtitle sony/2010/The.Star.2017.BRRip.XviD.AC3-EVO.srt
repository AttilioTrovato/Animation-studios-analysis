1
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,924
Don't think I don't see you, little one.

2
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,364
I think there's enough
for both of us, though.

3
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,207
<i>Mary.</i>

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,206
Fear not,

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,128
for you have been favored by God
to conceive and bear a son.

6
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,647
A son?

7
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,251
But how?

8
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
The Holy Spirit will overshadow you,

9
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,483
and the child will be called the Son of God.

10
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,282
For nothing is impossible with God.

11
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,600
Thank you.

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,445
Do I say thank you? I mean, yes.

13
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,003
Let it be done, just as you say.

14
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,564
Guys! Guys!

15
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,204
You're not gonna believe this!

16
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,240
Okay. You are not gonna believe this,

17
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,600
but I think a new star
just appeared in the sky...

18
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,760
No, no, no.

19
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,440
What have I said
about looking through that thing?

20
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,880
Come on. Wait.

21
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,291
This doesn't happen every day.

22
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,883
There's nothing out there for you, kid.

23
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,720
Things are changing.

24
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,450
That star means something.

25
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,925
And I'm not gonna be here forever.

26
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,400
I love the smell of freshly
ground grain in the morning.

27
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,120
Kid, your unemployed bird friend's here.

28
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,247
Dave!

29
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,729
- Hey, pal.
- What's new out there today?

30
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,523
You know, not a whole lot.

31
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
I mean, it's Nazareth.

32
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
That rooster on Fifth Street overslept again.

33
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,120
And, that horse...

34
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,280
What is his name? Jeremiah? Hezekiah?

35
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,600
There's an "iah" in there. I know that.

36
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,727
He lost a shoe.

37
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,444
And then, well...

38
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,960
I mean, it's barely worth mentioning,

39
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,600
but the royal caravan is rolling
through town today.

40
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,200
What? The royal caravan?

41
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,400
- Are you kidding?
- No, buddy! For real!

42
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,840
I spotted them outside of town

43
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
and had to come straight here to tell you.

44
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,360
Today's the day we've been waiting for.

45
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,240
Nazareth can kiss my gleaming
white tail feathers good-bye.

46
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,846
See? I told you that star was a sign.

47
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,765
We're meant for something greater than this.

48
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,600
This is our job, and once you accept that,

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,887
you'll be a glowing picture of happiness.

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,401
Like me.

51
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,240
We're talking about the royal caravan here.

52
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,651
It's the ultimate job.

53
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,720
<i>You get to go from town to town,
see the world, visit important people,</i>

54
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,080
<i>and you get to march
with the biggest, strongest,</i>

55
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,040
<i>greatest horses in the world.</i>

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave!

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,600
<i>All the animals in every town
watching us go by.</i>

58
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Dave! Dave! Dave!

59
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,888
<i>And we'll finally be doing
something important.</i>

60
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,087
A miniature donkey in the royal caravan?

61
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,680
- That'll be the day.
- Don't listen to him.

62
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,120
And what's a dove gonna do,
carry one grape at a time?

63
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,680
At least he's not
locked up in a mill like us.

64
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,081
I'm telling you,
folks in this town just don't get it.

65
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,080
And, I could carry two grapes,

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,003
one in each talon, thank you very much.

67
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,681
Bells.

68
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,006
Wait. Bells.

69
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,721
That's them.

70
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,681
It's time to activate Operation Prison Break.

71
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Okay.

72
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,960
All I have to do is kick
this sharp metal killer stick

73
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,520
towards my head and duck.

74
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
It'll cut your harness...

75
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,920
And I'll finally be free.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I love Operation Prison Break.

77
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,889
- Such a good idea.
- Here we go.

78
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,201
Okay, that's not good.

79
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,521
Oh, boy.

80
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,564
See? I knew that would work.

81
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,681
Just like we planned.

82
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,329
With a momentary near-death hiccup.

83
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,610
Well, old-timer, it's been real.

84
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,331
- Good luck to you.
- Wait, Dave.

85
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,720
We can't just leave him.

86
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,291
Buddy, I get where you're coming from,

87
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,120
but it's the royal caravan,
not the retirement caravan.

88
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,565
Look at him. He's like 300 years old.

89
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,770
All right. What's going on in...

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,723
Now, this ought to keep you where you belong.

91
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,488
You're nothing but a great big, rotten...

92
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,361
Oh, boy.

93
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,640
...good-for-nothing bully!

94
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,529
Yeah, you better walk away.

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,171
Who needs the royal caravan?

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,046
There's plenty of excitement
here in Nazareth.

97
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,802
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm very upset right now.

98
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,129
I'm gonna go find someone to poop on.

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,170
If that miller thinks
this yoke is gonna stop me...

100
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,720
Boy, do I have a surprise for him.

101
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,248
I'll be riding with kings any day now.
You'll see.

102
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Still no Mary.

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,560
Okay. Just a little late.

104
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,000
It's normal to be late
to your wedding feast. Totally normal.

105
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,880
Just like it's normal to talk to yourself.

106
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
There he is!

107
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,200
- Hey.
- Hi, Joseph.

108
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,281
Looking good!

109
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,769
Mary. You made it.

110
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,925
You look beautiful.

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,247
So do you.

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,281
Well, handsome.

113
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,767
I've missed you.

114
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,320
You're a little late, you know.
I was starting to worry.

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,527
Sorry.

116
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,680
That's our fault. We're always late.

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,411
"We" who? You were driving.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,607
She was such a big help to us
these past several months.

119
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,320
- Wasn't she, John?
- Sorry, big guy.

120
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,280
I know how great she is,
but I'm taking her back.

121
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,407
Joseph?

122
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,920
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
Of course.

124
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,124
And, just warning you,
it might be a lot to take in.

125
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,400
Mary, it's our wedding feast.

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,084
Of course. You can tell me anything.

127
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,487
She's here!

128
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
Sorry, what did you want to talk about?

129
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,685
It can wait.

130
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,211
Let's enjoy the party.

131
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,960
So, any new escape plans, kid?

132
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,087
What's the point?

133
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,880
I'm always gonna be stuck on the
same old wheel with the same old view.

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,405
What's wrong with the view?

135
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,884
I know it feels like
we're just going in circles.

136
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,689
- We are.
- Look, kid.

137
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,206
We're mill donkeys.

138
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,960
We grind grain. We don't carry kings.

139
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,041
Yeah.

140
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,121
Should've listened to you
and given up a long time ago.

141
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,480
What is happening?

142
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,802
Kid, it's my leg. Go get help.

143
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,330
These good-for-nothing animals.

144
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,841
What is it now?

145
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,724
Just what I needed.

146
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,803
- Are the gates open?
- What?

147
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
- Yeah.
- You!

148
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,531
What are you doing...

149
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,960
Kid, get out of here.

150
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,280
Wait, but I thought you said...

151
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,768
- What about you?
- I'll be fine.

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,407
I just hope you find what you're looking for.

153
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,006
I don't know what to say.

154
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,486
You're welcome, kid.

155
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
Now, get going.

156
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,165
No, you don't!

157
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,443
You're free, kid. Make it count.

158
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,681
What?

159
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,807
Where do you think you're going?

160
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,731
Get back here!

161
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,320
Look, I'm not gonna be here long.

162
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Runaway donkey! Somebody grab him!

163
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
Sorry, hon. Looks like I'm leaving
sooner than I thought.

164
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,326
Never forget me!

165
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,925
You broke out! Yes, the dream is back on.

166
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,680
See, not free yet.

167
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,091
The miller! The miller's on my tail!

168
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Yeah, and he does not look happy.

169
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,640
I am not happy!

170
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Follow me.

171
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,840
- This way. Up here.
- No, no, not up.

172
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,411
No, donkey don't like up!

173
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,445
Sorry. Sorry.

174
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,370
I'm a really nice guy.

175
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,885
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

176
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,286
- What now?
- Jump.

177
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,090
Jump? What, are you crazy?

178
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,601
Just jump!

179
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,931
A flying donkey!

180
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,686
Well, greetings, ladies.

181
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
Wait a second. Are they eating chicken?

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,684
Ladies, run!

183
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,724
Other way. Other way!

184
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,884
No, no. Where'd you go?

185
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,411
Dave? Dave? Where are you?

186
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,251
I got you now.

187
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,527
No.

188
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,411
- No, no, no.
- There's no way out of this.

189
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,245
Here we go!

190
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,089
Okay. Here goes.

191
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,090
He's a good man. He'll understand.

192
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,281
Thanks.

193
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,962
Zechariah! Party's over.

194
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,520
Let's go.

195
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,760
Great party, guys.

196
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,921
- Bye, now.
- Joseph,

197
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,766
you must be the happiest man in the world.

198
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,691
Or second happiest.

199
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,720
Clearly, I'm the happiest.

200
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,406
You know, I think I liked you better
when you couldn't talk.

201
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,960
Our place is a mess.

202
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,167
"Our place."

203
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,567
I like the sound of that.

204
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,961
Me, too.

205
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, this place isn't gonna clean itself.

206
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,161
I'm starting with the dishes.

207
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,368
Okay. And I'll start down here.

208
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,922
Where I figure out how to tell him about you.

209
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,929
It's all good news. Promise.

210
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,967
All good news.

211
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,481
Yep.

212
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,651
I'm caught again.

213
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,171
There's gotta be a better hiding place.

214
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,091
Okay, maybe not here.

215
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,201
Nope, not that one, either.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,286
Why couldn't I be smaller?

217
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,363
The one time I wish I was smaller.

218
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,324
No.

219
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,491
You poor thing.

220
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,281
You're hurt.

221
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,687
What is she doing?

222
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,281
That can't be good.

223
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,406
If I'm going to help you,
you're gonna have to let me, okay?

224
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,041
Okay.

225
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,921
Better?

226
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,762
Good. Nice to meet you.

227
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,361
I'm Mary.

228
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,040
Hey. You gonna bring me up any more dishes?

229
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,088
You didn't tell me you had a donkey.

230
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,521
I don't.

231
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,885
No, he must be a stray.

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,411
Go on, boy. Shoo!

233
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,961
You're scrappy. Scrappy little donkey.

234
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,685
Come on.

235
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,122
All right, that's how it's gonna be?

236
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,526
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. It's just a...

237
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,640
Well, I'm glad to see
that the donkey survived.

238
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,320
Poor little guy is hurt.

239
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,120
- Give him a break.
- Hello!

240
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,680
Has anyone lost a donkey?

241
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,683
- Because, if you have, he's here!
- What should we call you?

242
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,086
And I do not want him!

243
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,160
How about...

244
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,720
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Boaz.

245
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,880
You're naming it?

246
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,849
What do you think, Bo?

247
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,611
Bo? No way.

248
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,760
Bo's a good name for you. Isn't it?

249
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,650
- Isn't it?
- Yeah, Bo's great. Love it.

250
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,291
Mary, no.

251
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,360
No, if you name him, you're gonna start
feeling affectionate toward him.

252
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
And once you feel affectionate,
you're gonna want to keep him.

253
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,808
And if there is one thing
we are definitely not going to do...

254
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,771
Do you think he'll be warm enough down here?

255
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,800
That's my workshop.

256
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,483
Let's just let him stay here
till he's all better.

257
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,251
Don't you think we should at least...

258
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,287
Mary?

259
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,368
Come on. Let's go talk upstairs.

260
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,771
Okay...

261
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,124
Finally. They are gone, and I am out of here.

262
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,241
There you are.

263
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,441
I am so glad you're okay.

264
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,600
Do you know how much flying around
I have done looking for you?

265
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,920
I thought that maybe the miller
caught you and was gonna eat you.

266
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,880
Eat me? Yeah, I don't think
he was gonna do that.

267
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,680
You don't know! He had crazy in his eyes.

268
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,922
So keep it down.
He's still out there someplace.

269
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,329
- Do you think he heard?
- Nah. I think we're good.

270
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,926
This is the last place he'd check.

271
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,965
Nothing special ever happens
in an old shack like this.

272
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,487
The Messiah?

273
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,448
You're saying that baby
is the actual Messiah?

274
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,600
Like from the prophets?
I do need to sit down, actually.

275
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,684
I know. I know how it sounds, but yes.

276
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,808
And God wants you and me to raise him.

277
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,528
Me? Are you sure...

278
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,970
I mean, did the angel mention me?

279
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
Well, no, but it's...

280
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
Look, I can't raise the Son of God.

281
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,280
He's a king. I'm just a carpenter.

282
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,328
He needs someone with a little
more experience being...

283
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,530
I don't know, king-ish?

284
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,847
I mean, who am I?

285
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,205
You're my husband.

286
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I am so sorry.

287
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,960
This is just so much to take in right now.

288
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,963
Can I have a little time?

289
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,404
Okay. We got it this time.

290
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,720
We're making progress, though, right?

291
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,643
Hate to say it, but even if we got you out,

292
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,803
you're never gonna make it
to the royal caravan on that leg.

293
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,727
Dave, look, I don't want to hold you back.

294
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,967
You fly ahead without me.

295
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,641
I'll catch up once my leg heals.

296
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,160
No. We're in this together,
and I'm not gonna leave you here.

297
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,760
- Friends don't do that.
- Are you sure?

298
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,491
Yeah, and besides,
you'd never make it without me.

299
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,280
I am a bird of the world.

300
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,283
I know how things work out there.

301
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,324
You are a donkey of a barn.

302
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,125
A very small, ill-smelling barn.

303
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,051
- You need me.
- Okay.

304
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,407
So, now what?

305
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,523
Hide out here until your leg heals,

306
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,360
and then just get yourself kicked out.

307
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,124
And we'll be back on track, pal.

308
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,646
Bo, actually.

309
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
My name is Bo now. Mary named me.

310
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,281
"Bo."

311
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,760
That's got a nice ring to... Wait.

312
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,570
That lady person named you?

313
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,360
I said hide here,
not settle in and get a name.

314
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,001
- Have I taught you nothing?
- No one is settling in, okay?

315
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,240
Once my leg is healed,
it's time for Operation Kick Me Out.

316
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,480
Good. Now, I'm an expert
at this type of thing, so listen up.

317
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,688
Things I found that tend to tick people off.

318
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,485
Jumping out and scaring them.

319
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,449
Singing really loudly early in the morning.

320
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,569
Staring at them while they eat.

321
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,005
At the risk of stating the obvious,
a well-placed number two.

322
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,441
Breaking things.

323
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,761
Setting things on fire.

324
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,004
Licking things that don't want to be licked.

325
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,810
<i>What child is this</i>

326
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,080
<i>Who laid to rest</i>

327
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,281

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,200
<i>This, this is Christ the King</i>

00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,760
<i>Whom shepherds guard and angels sing</i>

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,846

<i>Field and fountain</i>

<i>Moor and mountain</i>

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,360
Hang on!

347
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,920
<i>- Following yonder star</i>
- Cyrus! Deborah!

348
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,320
Come on, guys! Wait up!

349
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,600
I expected a left turn two deserts ago.

350
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
I'm dying back here!

351
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,400
I can't believe we passed that last oasis.

352
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,323
- I'm getting thirsty.
- Lost!

353
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,124
These wise guys are lost.

354
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,160
Wise men don't get lost, Felix.

355
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,680
So you're saying they know
where this birthday party is?

356
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,080
And what makes you so certain
it's a birthday party?

357
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,161
Here we go.

358
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,880
Have you seen the presents
these guys are bringing?

359
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,480
Gold, myrrh, frankincense.

360
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,846
Could be a baby shower.

361
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,520
- You bring gifts to a baby shower.
- Baby shower?

362
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,320
What is a baby gonna do
with frankincense, silly camel?

363
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,891
It's a birthday party.

364
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Baby shower.

365
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,640
- Birthday party.
- Baby shower.

366
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,840
Birthday party.

367
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
- Baby shower.
- Birthday party!

368
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
What if it's not a party at all?

369
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,928
What if we're on our way
to do something important like,

370
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,520
I don't know, meeting the Son of God?

371
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,570
Deborah's crazier than a box of rocks.

372
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,840
I believe the expression is,
"Dumb as a box of rocks."

373
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,320
You ever shake a box of rocks?

374
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,720
They sound crazy.

375
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,280
<i>You're westward leading</i>

376
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,088
<i>Still you're proceeding</i>

377
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,321
<i>Guide us to the light</i>

378
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,683
So floridly written.

379
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,360
It makes one wonder how the emperor

380
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,091
has so much time for counting his subjects.

381
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,765
But if Caesar decrees a census,
then a census he will get.

382
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,520
Send the royal guard to round up
every man and woman.

383
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,968
- Sire.
- Let the counting of the sheep begin.

384
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,331
Your Majesty, three magi
bearing gifts for the king.

385
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,648
Hold it right there, camels.

386
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,120
I bet they can play that game we made up.

387
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,720
That was fun. What was it called again?

388
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,086
"How High."

389
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,009
On three. One, two...

390
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,681
Three!

391
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,444
- How high?
- Camel high.

392
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,882
Your gifts are unexpected,
though not unwelcome.

393
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,480
Your Majesty, these gifts are not for you.

394
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,563
Yes, they're for the new king.

395
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,244
- What new king?
- The one foretold by the star.

396
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
I knew it.

397
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,080
It's a birthday party for the new king.

398
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,120
No, no. I'm pretty certain
it's a baby shower.

399
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,680
Or maybe they're referring
to the coming Messiah.

400
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,327
The Son of God.

401
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,647
Okay, now I'm starting to worry about her.

402
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,805
Deborah, are you okay?

403
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,248
How many hooves am I holding up?

404
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
Now bring in my scribes.

405
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,640
There is a prophecy.

406
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,926
What are they saying?

407
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,240
I can't make it out, but it's something
about the king of the... Shoes?

408
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,448
King of the shoes? That's what this is about?

409
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,480
- That can't be right.
- Look!

410
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,280
Look! Dude has gold slippers.
King of the shoes, no doubt.

411
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,760
That, Felix, is money and no taste.

412
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
Can we move past the shoes?

413
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,760
- I think...
- Look at that guy.

414
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,600
- You see him?
- He's just the royal dog walker.

415
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,400
Trust me. Felix, I know these things.

416
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,080
What? Dog walker?

417
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,924
He's like a nightmare wearing a helmet.

418
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,282
We must find this king at once.

419
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,888
I will set my scribes to the task.

420
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,887
In the meantime, I invite you to stay
in the palace as my royal guests.

421
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,886
No, no, that's not necessary, sire.

422
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,491
But, I insist.

423
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,640
Okay. That was sinister.

424
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,960
Yep. We're leaving.

425
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,602
We're not gonna do any slumber parties
with any evil shoe kings.

426
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,051
No, thank you.

427
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,441
Too late.

428
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,769
This new king is a problem.

429
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,446
Get rid of the problem.

430
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,851
The room was filled with magical light.

431
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,728
And then the angel said
that the child would be the new king.

432
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,681
New king?

433
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,567
And I thought, "I'm not ready to be a mom."

434
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,527
But then I realized
the angel was talking to the lady.

435
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,882
Wait, wait. I'm not done.

436
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,211
That's usually everyone's favorite part.

437
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,441
Nice story, rat. Here's how it ends.

438
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
The end.

439
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,929
Rufus, spit it out.

440
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,730
We need that rat to talk.

441
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,360
I am not a rat.

442
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,600
- I'm a pygmy jerboa.
- What's a jerboa?

443
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,440
It is in the rodent family
but an entirely different species.

444
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,887
Rufus, enough. Spit it out.

445
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,485
I was just starting to
get a little bit of the flavor.

446
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,289
You've been telling this story
to every critter in Galilee.

447
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,888
Now it's our turn to hear it.

448
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,487
From the beginning.

449
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,485
From the beginning?

450
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,207
Okay. Well...

451
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,480
I was born in a sack of barley
somewhere in Capernaum.

452
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,802
Skip to the end! Who's the woman?

453
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Her name is Mary. She lives in Nazareth.

454
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,800
But, please, don't hurt her.

455
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,360
- She's really nice.
- Don't worry.

456
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,530
We're harmless.

457
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,205
That's mine!

458
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
No.

459
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,005
Mary!

460
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,485
Looks like you're healed up.

461
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Feeling better?

462
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,680
All I'm saying is it's unfair, you know,

463
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,809
to make all these people
drop everything for the census.

464
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,760
And for us to travel to Bethlehem,
especially in your condition.

465
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,680
Joseph, I'm not dying.

466
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,842
It's just a little road trip. We'll be fine.

467
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,520
This feels right.

468
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,240
You know, Mary, most donkeys have to work.

469
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,400
You are spoiling him.

470
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,005
She is spoiling you.

471
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,690
Hey, look at you.

472
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,007
- Your leg's all better.
- Hey, Dave.

473
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,760
All right, time to activate
Operation Kick Me Out.

474
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
What's your plan of attack?

475
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,960
First, I thought I'd let her finish
this belly rub.

476
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,200
Snap out of it!

477
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
A little bird named Methuselah

478
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,569
told me the royal caravan will be
passing through not too far from here.

479
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,045
We can catch them if we leave soon.

480
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,730
All right, let's get kicked out of here.

481
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,480
All packed up. Is the donkey ready?

482
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,320
Yes, his leg looks good as new.

483
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,845
Finally. Time for him to earn his keep.

484
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,200
All right, Bo, let's get you
hitched up to this cart

485
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,771
so you can take us to Bethlehem.

486
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,164
- Bethlehem?
- Bethlehem?

487
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
Not good, not good.

488
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,729
The royal caravan is nowhere near Bethlehem.

489
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,365
Don't worry. He's gotta catch me first.

490
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,447
- Joseph, maybe if you just...
- Don't worry, Mary. I've got this.

491
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,443
Well, looks like you got me.

492
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,091
Come here!

493
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,283
- That looked like it hurt.
- It did.

494
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,805
- How was that?
- Bo, look out!

495
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,764
Come on. See?

496
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,730
Under control.

497
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,406
Joseph!

498
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,600
No, no, I'm okay.

499
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,160
You know what? We can walk to Bethlehem.

500
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,886
- No problem.
- Useless donkey.

501
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,880
- Nicely done.
- I thought so.

502
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,880
Did you see how I laid him out on the ground?

503
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,327
Those caravan horses have nothing on you.

504
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,443
- Okay, so now what?
- Easy.

505
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,840
All we have to do is slip through the gate

506
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,490
when they're on their way out.

507
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,807
No, no, no, don't close the gate!

508
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,570
Don't worry. We'll be back soon.

509
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,963
I guess that was good-bye?

510
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,921
You're not gonna cry, are you?

511
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,766
Come on, we gotta figure out a way
to open this thing.

512
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,689
This is what I get
for having a friend who can't fly.

513
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,840
You know what? Gates were never
a problem before I met you.

514
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,960
There's gotta be something we can use here.

515
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,200
There's that table, that lumber, those tools.

516
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,010
A giant knife.

517
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,167
Hide!

518
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,682
Okay, Bo. What haven't you told me?

519
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,484
- You been making some new friends?
- No.

520
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,243
I bet the miller sent them
to bring me back to the mill.

521
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,001
- They left the gate open.
- I'll make a run for it.

522
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,720
Dave, you jump out and create a distraction.

523
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,960
What? No. Terrible plan.

524
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,282
Why don't you make the distraction
and I run for it?

525
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,210
Because I'm the one trapped in here,
and you can fly,

526
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,442
- as you like to keep telling me.
- All valid points.

527
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,840
I got a scent.

528
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,840
I smell a dog!

529
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,800
Thaddeus, there's definitely a dog here.

530
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,211
Yeah!

531
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,404
- I smell me.
- Hey! Scary dogs!

532
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,330
You guys here for the show?

533
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,730
- What show?
- What...

534
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,807
"What show," the silly dog asks.

535
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,280
You're adorable.

536
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,967
"The Dance of the Royal Dove," of course.

537
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,243
Played in Rome six years.

538
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,686
Great reviews.

539
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,564
Caesar saw it twice. Made him cry.

540
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,080
He won't admit that because,
you know, he's Caesar and all.

541
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,640
But he definitely cried like a baby.

542
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,760
- But I digress.
- We don't have time for this.

543
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,161
No! Wait! The show is about to start.

544
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,363
Okay. You can...

545
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,002
What are you doing? Don't watch me.

546
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,763
Yeah. This bird can dance.

547
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,400
No, guys. Guys, guys, guys, no,
this is the best part.

548
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,760
Okay, there you go. They're gone.

549
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,127
- Where's your owner?
- Yeah! Where's your owner?

550
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,600
Who, the miller? I don't know a miller.

551
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,923
My owner's a nice pregnant lady.
You would love her.

552
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,128
- That's her.
- Where is she?

553
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,325
Wait, you're looking for Mary?
Did I say "pregnant lady?"

554
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,085
I meant "miller."

555
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,282
I'm just a mill donkey on vacation.

556
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,370
- Who's Mary?
- Keep talking.

557
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,360
Okay, that was pathetic.
Let me handle this, Bo.

558
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,480
- Guys, donkeys are stubborn.
- Yeah.

559
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,130
- He's not gonna tell you anything.
- Sorry, guys.

560
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,000
You would have to torture it out of him.

561
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,445
Wait, what?

562
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,205
- He didn't bandage himself.
- That's her scent.

563
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,323
Now we just gotta figure out
which way she went.

564
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,528
We'll tell her you said hello.

565
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,327
They left the gate open.

566
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,560
Okay. The royal caravan is right this way.

567
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,880
We'll catch it in no time.

568
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,400
Wait. Where you going? Dream is that way.

569
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,926
- Right, but Mary is this way.
- No.

570
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,088
Royal caravan cannot wait
for a rescue mission.

571
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,080
Especially when that guy is after her.
He is major bad news.

572
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
I'm not gonna just let her get hurt, Dave.

573
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,480
- She was nice to me.
- Come on, Bo.

574
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,484
- We've been waiting for this.
- It'll just take a second.

575
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Once Mary's safe, we'll turn right around

576
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,200
and join the royal caravan.

577
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,046
- Deal?
- Fine! Deal.

578
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,884
So we turn right around.

579
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,890
Okay, leave this to me. I know a shortcut.

580
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
He'll lead us right to her.

581
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,762
- And then what?
- Then we find the baby.

582
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,880
That baby messed with the wrong dogs.

583
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,521
Nothing scares us.
Not even a baby. Right, partner?

584
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,400
Just stop.

585
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,245
Thaddeus, do you think I'm bad at being bad?

586
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,205
I got it.

587
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,760
Okay, Dave, be honest.

588
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,440
- Are we lost?
- No.

589
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,560
'Cause this doesn't exactly
look like the beaten path.

590
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,882
It's a shortcut. Trust me.

591
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Bo? Bo, right here. Look at me, buddy.

592
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,248
Just breathe. Breathe.

593
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,010
Breathe.

594
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,800
Nope. That's it.

595
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,884
No more of your terrible shortcuts. We are...

596
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,720
Look. It's Mary. That's them.

597
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,803
Guess we'll have to take
my terrible shortcut.

598
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,485
You're welcome.

599
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,400
Wait. No, no, no, no. Okay.

600
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
Come on. Really?

601
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,322
- Which way am I supposed to go?
- It's a cliff.

602
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,965
You go down.

603
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,760
- Hi.
- Could you help me get down, please?

604
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,126
Just let go.

605
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,646
- Here, let me.
- Wait, no, no, no.

606
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,089
- I'm Ruth.
- Hi, Ruth. I'm Bo.

607
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,927
Ruth? You're a little close.

608
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,840
- You know, personal space?
- Sorry.

609
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,120
Flocking. It's a sheep thing.

610
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,045
So, what are you doing
all alone on a cliff like this?

611
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,320
Well, actually,
I'm here with my friend, Dave.

612
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,560
I'm meeting him at the bottom.
We're on the road to Bethlehem

613
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,882
so we can catch up with
my friend Mary and save her.

614
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,244
And once we do,
we will be joining the royal caravan.

615
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,450
Sounds exciting.

616
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
Well, I guess I'll get back
to following the star.

617
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
The star? You mean the...

618
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,680
- You mean that super bright one?
- Yeah, that one.

619
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,444
Have you noticed
how it's been getting brighter?

620
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,880
Totally. And the weird way
it kind of pulsates.

621
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,200
Yes! It's like it's...

622
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,400
- Like it means something.
- Exactly.

623
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,848
Okay, come on. We're almost down.
One more chasm.

624
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,680
This is really easy for you, isn't it?

625
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,366
You got it, Bo. Just don't look down.

626
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,930
Okay, great. Now, just...

627
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,760
Just try to get your hooves in...

628
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,969
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Spread-eagle.
We're going for a wedge thing here.

629
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,960
That's it. You got it. You're a wedge.

630
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,200
- How does that feel?
- Fantastic.

631
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,080
Great. Okay. Next, just lift that hoof
and take a step down.

632
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,562
- No, no, no.
- You can do it. Just one hoof at a time.

633
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,121
That's it.

634
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,924
What is taking him so long?

635
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,080
Well, didn't exactly stick the landing,
but that was good.

636
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,128
You're a fast learner.

637
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,082
- Dave? Dave?
- I'm under you and in a lot of pain.

638
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,962
- Dave?
- Yeah. Right here. On your butt.

639
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,243
Come on. Let's get moving.

640
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,960
You must be Dave.
I've heard great things about you.

641
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,804
- I'm Ruth.
- Pleasure.

642
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,169
Well, we've got places to be,
people to save, caravans to join.

643
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,608
- See you around.
- Thanks, Ruth.

644
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,889
Have you ever been to Bethlehem before?

645
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,440
- We've never been anywhere before.
- Well, you're in for a treat.

646
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,840
The Samaritan Mountains
are beautiful this time of year.

647
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,651
Deadly steep, but great views.

648
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,327
- You've been to Bethlehem?
- Are you kidding?

649
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,080
I grew up around there.
I know all the ins and outs,

650
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,402
how to avoid predators
and treacherous high cliffs.

651
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,842
The treacherous cliffs.

652
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,610
You're not really considering this, are you?

653
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,404
Come on, Ruth. Lead the way.

654
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,841
Sheep are usually better at following,
but I will do my best.

655
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,611
- Let's go, flock.
- Yippee.

656
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,650
- Felix, come on.
- Shouldn't we be sneaking out?

657
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,280
Why are we sneaking in?

658
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,201
King Herod is up to something.
And we are gonna find out what.

659
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,766
With the help of a little
well-placed distraction.

660
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,604
Come on, fellas. Hurry.

661
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,720
Still no report from my hunter?

662
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,451
- Has he found the child?
- No, sire.

663
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,920
But your scribes are ready
to present their findings.

664
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,526
Well, finally, someone's doing their job.

665
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,324
So tell me where he is.

666
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,440
According to the prophecy, Your Majesty,

667
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,523
the new king is to be born in Bethlehem.

668
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,960
And? That's all? To what family?

669
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,520
Who are they? I am the king.

670
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,560
I am the king of Judea.

671
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,768
If you people can't find this one child,

672
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,769
then I'll just have to kill them all.

673
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,611
See? I told you.

674
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,087
Shall we send soldiers to track him down?

675
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,761
No.

676
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,407
You three, come.

677
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,800
- It's the wise men.
- Hide, quickly.

678
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,521
- So, any word of the new king?
- Yes.

679
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,045
Look for him in Bethlehem. You're free to go.

680
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,487
Our humblest thanks, Your Majesty.

681
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,082
When you find him, send word to me.

682
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,846
I dearly wish to know where he is

683
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,845
so that I, too, may honor him

684
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,531
with a gift.

685
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,360
You know, I think
he might be up to something.

686
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,360
He's using the wise men
to track down the new king.

687
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,683
Yeah! Plus, did you see him
crumple that flower?

688
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,725
- We have to warn the new king.
- Pack your bags, boys.

689
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,360
Looks like we're going to Bethlehem.

690
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,640
And now our tour will continue
past these pebbles on the path.

691
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,200
Watch your step. Watch your step.
And watch your step.

692
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,324
I blame you for this.

693
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,641
There they are.

694
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,445
Come on.

695
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,801
Mary.

696
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,485
Are you sure you don't want
to sit in the cart?

697
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,840
No, it's hard enough for you as it is.

698
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,684
Just let me fix my boot.

699
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,080
- I don't believe it.
- Really, I'm fine.

700
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,129
No, not that. That.

701
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,121
Bo?

702
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,960
Mary. You're in danger.

703
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,885
You need to listen to what I'm about
to say extremely carefully.

704
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,400
You ever feel like he's trying to talk to us?

705
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,403
Why is he here? Where did he come from?

706
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,126
She's not getting it.

707
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,328
Okay, new plan.

708
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,960
Can you two act like dogs?

709
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,560
- What do you think?
- Yes. I do a great dog.

710
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,769
- Dogs are my fourth best animal.
- Great. Just follow my lead.

711
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,726
"Look at me. I'm Mary. I'm so pregnant."

712
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,805
"I'm Joseph. I'm in a bad mood."

713
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,405
Wait, wait, wait. Is that supposed to be me?

714
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,327
It's totally you.

715
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,762
"No! Look! Here come the dogs!"

716
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,081
That's you guys.

717
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,120
Throw me a stick,
and I'll bring it right back.

718
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,680
What's this? It's a tail?

719
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
- I'm gonna get you.
- Seriously?

720
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,365
We're doing this
instead of the royal caravan?

721
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,882
No, Ruth, you're a scary dog. Just be meaner.

722
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,887
Meaner? You mean like this!

723
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,520
No! They got me!

724
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,524
If only a certain donkey had warned me.

725
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,560
There is something seriously
wrong with those animals.

726
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,720
I think Bo's trying to tell us something.

727
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,370
Come on, come on.

728
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,451
I think he wants a belly rub.

729
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,281
What? No. I mean, yes, always, but not now.

730
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,920
This is not working.

731
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,202
Guys, I hate to break this up,
but we've got trouble.

732
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,040
- Mama!
- Those guys?

733
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,360
Yeah, they've been following us
since we came down the cliff.

734
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,120
Couldn't you have pointed that out sooner?

735
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
No. They followed us right to her.

736
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,726
Well, why don't we hide
in that big flock over there?

737
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,484
That's what a sheep would do.

738
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,205
Yes. Great idea.

739
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,446
Bo, what are you...

740
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,210
- Joseph?
- Right behind you.

741
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,321
Okay.

742
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,965
You must be really thirsty.

743
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm gonna grab some water. Do you want some?

744
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,248
Sure. Yeah, I guess I'll just take
a look at that wheel, then.

745
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,645
- Don't carry too much, okay?
- I won't.

746
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,040
Sorry.

747
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,243
- Fresh figs! Get your fresh figs here.
- I got them.

748
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,205
Hello, sir. You look like a man
who appreciates fine pottery.

749
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,401
I...

750
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,326
Hurry up. We need three buckets of water.

751
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,040
- Do you see anything?
- What are we looking for?

752
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,640
What...

753
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,640
Here we are, minutes away from being chopped

754
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,400
into tiny little pieces
by a knife-wielding psycho.

755
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,689
- We could've been riding with royalty.
- Look! They're here.

756
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,720
Dave, let's try and lead them away.

757
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,560
Ruth, you stay here and guard Mary.

758
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,280
If they find her, get our attention.

759
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,728
- Yeah. We should have a secret signal.
- Sounds great.

760
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,726
Help me.

761
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,931
Gosh. The signal. Okay.

762
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,885
- No.
- I'll take care of this.

763
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,005
Looks like it's up to me.

764
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,526
Nope, too big. Too big.

765
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,287
- Ruth, looks like it's up to you.
- Me?

766
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,522
I knew this day would come.

767
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,529
For the flock!

768
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,411
Look out!

769
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,362
- No!
- Get back! Get back!

770
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,846
Watch out!

771
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,720
Hold it up!

772
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,207
No!

773
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,927
Yes!

774
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,203
Bo, are you okay?

775
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,720
- What has gotten into you?
- That donkey did it.

776
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,200
He destroyed everything.

777
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,407
Did you do this?

778
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,240
- It was the donkey.
- Who owns that?

779
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,685
Oh, boy.

780
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,880
We stopped him!

781
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,480
That went great, right?

782
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,290
Hey, you big mutts!

783
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,880
- Come here.
- Hope your boss knows how to swim.

784
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,325
You want some of this?

785
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,808
What's the matter, guys? All tied up?

786
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,211
That's it, you're dead.

787
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,805
Thank you. Thank you very much.

788
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,485
- I hate that dancing bird.
- I know. He's so talented.

789
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,444
- Joseph.
- No, no.

790
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,967
I do not want that donkey
near you or the baby.

791
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,203
Go! Get out of here!

792
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,680
- Joseph, it's fine.
- Fine?

793
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,040
Mary, this is not going well, all right?

794
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,880
I just promised four people
I'd repair the carts that he smashed.

795
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,849
Yeah, trying to save her life.

796
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,203
Maybe if you pulled the cart,
Joseph would want you to stay.

797
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,160
- No, he is just too much to deal with.
- He's just a donkey.

798
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,760
"Just a donkey?" Yeah, he is.
Just a good-for-nothing donkey

799
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,161
that has only ever brought us trouble.

800
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,920
Come on, Dave. Let's go.

801
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,400
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think?

802
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,120
To join the royal caravan.

803
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,090
Where we'll finally do something important.

804
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,160
Bo, wait a minute. What about the star?

805
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,720
It means something. You said so yourself.

806
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,803
You follow the star. I'm done with that.

807
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,085
But what about our tiny flock?

808
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,369
Flocks stick together.

809
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,245
We're not a flock.

810
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,410
I never should have followed you.

811
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,851
Bo?

812
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,805
Bo!

813
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,770
We're gonna die. We're gonna die!

814
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,528
We're gonna live. We're gonna live!

815
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,083
Someone's gonna die.

816
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:29,441
<i>Why should I feel discouraged?</i>

817
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,491
<i>Why should the shadows come?</i>

818
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:45,008
<i>Why should my heart be lonely?</i>

819
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,529
<i>And long for Heaven and home?</i>

820
00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:01,050
<i>I sing because I'm happy</i>

821
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:08,851
<i>I sing because I'm free</i>

822
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,491
<i>His eye is on the sparrow</i>

823
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,847
<i>And I know He watches me.</i>

824
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,925
Is that the royal caravan?

825
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,371
I can see them!

826
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,161
Royal caravan-van-van-van-van!

827
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,766
The royal caravan!

828
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,085
Dave?

829
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,523
I don't think I can go with you.

830
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,320
Of course you can. What do you mean?

831
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,004
Look...

832
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,240
I know we've always talked about
joining the royal caravan,

833
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,163
being a part of something important,

834
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,405
but now that we're here,
I don't think this is it.

835
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,880
You know, Mary may not be big and royal,

836
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,883
but she's important.

837
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,731
She's important to me.

838
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,565
I know this was our dream,

839
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,008
and even though I can't come,
I think you should go.

840
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,845
Say hi to the horses for me.

841
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,840
- Come on.
- No, really, I mean it.

842
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,604
Bo, yes, you're right.

843
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,723
The royal caravan was our dream.

844
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,130
But the best part
was that it was gonna be us.

845
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,600
If all I wanted was to flap
around a bunch of fancy wagons,

846
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,489
I could have gone and done that
a long time ago.

847
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,810
I mean, I can fly, you know?
You realize that?

848
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,129
Yeah. I guess so.

849
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,080
Look, you lead the way, and wherever you go,

850
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,005
your best friend Dave
will be right behind you.

851
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,245
You ready?

852
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,131
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Let me help.

853
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,528
- Mary, you're in no condition to help.
- Stop saying that.

854
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,680
- I'm fine.
- No, you are not fine.

855
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,080
- None of this is fine.
- Joseph, God chose us.

856
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,200
But why? Why us?

857
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,204
Look at us. We'll be lucky
just to make it to Bethlehem.

858
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,449
And we're supposed to raise the Son of God?

859
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,320
This must be part of God's plan.

860
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,687
Well, so far, this plan is going great.

861
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,723
I can't wait to see what happens next.

862
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,921
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

863
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,491
<i>That your baby boy
will one day walk on water?</i>

864
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,160
What are you looking at?

865
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,163
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

866
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:27,085
<i>That your baby boy
will save our sons and daughters?</i>

867
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,330
Lord, I can't do this.

868
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,080
All right? I am not the father of a king.

869
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,766
I'm just a carpenter. Please, give me a sign.

870
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:44,409
<i>This child that you delivered
will soon deliver you</i>

871
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,763
Really?

872
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,760
The donkey?

873
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,808
Stop it.

874
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,080
<i>Mary, did you know?</i>

875
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,491
Mary?

876
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,925
Hi, Ruth.

877
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,800
Look, I'm sorry for what I said back there.

878
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,723
It was mean, and...

879
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,930
I'm glad we followed you.

880
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,205
You know, that night I saw the star,

881
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,000
I tried to get my old flock to follow me,

882
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,680
but they wouldn't.

883
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,331
And so I struck out on my own,

884
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,240
which has been hard
'cause, well, I'm a sheep.

885
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,129
Thank you for coming back.

886
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,762
- Can you help me with these?
- Of course! You're back!

887
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,802
- Sorry, personal space.
- Come here.

888
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,001
Mary.

889
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,282
Are you okay? I am so sorry.

890
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,449
No, Joseph. You were right.

891
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,082
I was? About what?

892
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,761
This is hard.

893
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,767
Trust me, I know it is.

894
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,646
Just because God has a plan
doesn't mean it's going to be easy.

895
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,523
And that scares me.

896
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,370
I'm scared, too.

897
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,965
But I'm here. And I am yours.

898
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,362
And I will give everything that I have

899
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,087
to keep you and the baby safe.

900
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,446
I mean, I may not have a lot...

901
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,365
Speaking of which,
what happened to all our stuff?

902
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,363
- Bo!
- I always liked that donkey.

903
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,291
I always did. I didn't say it enough.
That's true.

904
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,640
- Hello.
- Did the baby kick?

905
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,490
No, that was something different.

906
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,451
Different? What "different?"
Like, baby's coming now?

907
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,408
We've got some time, but, yeah, I think so.

908
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,684
Okay! Nobody panic!
I've got the clothes. I've got the bag.

909
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,007
I've got the sheep. Why do I have the sheep?

910
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,646
Bo, can you carry her?

911
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,331
<i>One dark night</i>

912
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,207
<i>Something said follow the light</i>

913
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,400
<i>So you look up and see the word</i>

914
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,366
<i>That's written upon the sky</i>

915
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,611
<i>Strong and wise</i>

916
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,607
<i>Keeping the Lord as your guide</i>

917
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,886
<i>And through the doubt you realize</i>

918
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,120
<i>He's with you all the while</i>

919
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,171
<i>Follow that star above you</i>

920
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,725
<i>Should the world try to break you down</i>

921
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,643
<i>There is one who waits for you</i>

922
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,368
<i>Though you can't see Him now</i>

923
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,724
<i>Thunder and rain surround you</i>

924
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,242
<i>But His love's just a breath away</i>

925
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,520
<i>If you follow your heart, follow the light</i>

926
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,730
<i>Follow that star</i>

927
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,960
<i>If you follow your heart, follow the light</i>

928
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,520
<i>Follow that star</i>

929
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,642
<i>I have traveled</i>

930
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,680
<i>Many moonless nights</i>

931
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,367
<i>Cold and weary</i>

932
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,360
<i>With a babe inside</i>

933
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,760
<i>And I wonder</i>

934
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,440
All right. Shall we?

935
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,851
<i>What I've done</i>

936
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,091
All right, buddy, just wait here,
and we'll be back out in a second.

937
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,602
And they're inside.

938
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,684
Thank goodness. This has been so stressful.

939
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,840
I don't know how we held it together.

940
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,240
Well, we made it.

941
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,800
Safe and sound in Bethlehem.

942
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,730
Something's not right.

943
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,765
Excuse me.

944
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,087
You.

945
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,440
- No, no, no.
- Easy. Easy, boy.

946
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,760
It's okay.

947
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,280
Just hold still.

948
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,080
Let me go!

949
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,640
No, you don't,
crazy-eyed, donkey-eating miller.

950
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,085
That's my best friend!

951
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,246
- Move on!
- Dave!

952
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,523
Dave, are you okay?

953
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,603
Where did they go? Who was that?

954
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,881
Bad news.

955
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,440
- I'm sorry. The inn is full.
- What?

956
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,680
But, no, can't you see
she's about to have a child?

957
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,683
What can I do? Blame the census.

958
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,240
You know what? We will pay double.

959
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,760
Just hold that thought.

960
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,046
I'll be right back.

961
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,289
- I left the money with Bo.
- Joseph?

962
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,240
Bo?

963
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,160
Where's Bo?

964
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,640
Joseph, we're running out of time!

965
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,760
Mary.

966
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,921
Bo...

967
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,929
Bo, where are you?

968
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,160
Ruth, I know we have had our personal issues,

969
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,402
but we need to set them aside and find Bo.

970
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,808
We have personal issues?

971
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,241
Dave, I think you are a delight.

972
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,040
I am a delight. Thank you for noticing.

973
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,169
Okay, time to activate Operation Rescue Bo.

974
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,006
She's here.

975
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,840
Down the street. Try them.

976
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,651
You don't understand.
We just came from there.

977
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,646
Sorry.

978
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,806
Where do we go now?

979
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,561
We will find a place.
We just have to keep looking.

980
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,400
So this is Bethle-ham.

981
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,440
It is pronounced "Bethle-hem."

982
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,329
- That's what I said. "Bethle-ham."
- "Hem."

983
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,200
"Hem." As if you're clearing your throat.

984
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,400
- Boys.
- That's what I've been saying.

985
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,560
- You need to get your ears checked.
- Boys, focus.

986
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,080
The new king's in danger.

987
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,491
Right. Let's go find him.

988
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,000
They've secured our restraints.

989
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,400
Yeah, and they tied us up, too.

990
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,120
We have to find the new king.

991
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,720
Wise men indeed.

992
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,080
Okay, okay, think. What do kings look like?

993
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,880
In most cultures,
a king is set apart from the plebeians

994
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,480
with an ornamental headdress.

995
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,680
A ornamel what?

996
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,091
They wear hats.

997
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,240
They're coming for you, Your Majesty!

998
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,811
Run for your life!

999
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,600
- Run like the wind!
- Will you cut that out?

1000
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,120
We'll never find him tied up here.

1001
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,040
- We have to go out and search.
- That's it.

1002
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,640
I'm biting through the reins.

1003
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,721
Don't you dare.

1004
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,640
That is fine Corinthian leather.

1005
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,688
Do you have any idea how much that cost?

1006
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,484
- You kidding me?
- No, he's right.

1007
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,240
Well, we'll have to untie
these knots ourselves.

1008
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,440
Just follow my instructions.

1009
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,200
First, Felix, we'll need you in the middle.

1010
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,805
Deborah, on the left.

1011
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,280
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- No.

1012
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,560
- Let me... Move.
- No. Over.

1013
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,920
- Would you move?
- The other way.

1014
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,400
- Sorry about that. Sorry. My bad.
- I got it.

1015
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,480
- Move.
- No, around.

1016
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,687
No, the other...

1017
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,960
- The other left.
- Stop!

1018
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,371
Would you stop pinching me?

1019
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,364
Come on. Come on.

1020
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,208
No, no, no. Don't do this. Please!

1021
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,685
I can't let them down.

1022
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,962
I could try praying.

1023
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,247
Let's see...

1024
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,050
Okay, how did Mary do this?

1025
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,961
Never mind.

1026
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,327
It's fine.

1027
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,523
God? Hello?

1028
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,600
I don't really know how this works

1029
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,480
or if You listen to prayers from donkeys,

1030
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,120
but I've seen Mary do this many times,

1031
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,487
and I don't know what else to do.

1032
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,251
My friends need help.

1033
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,045
I thought, if I followed the star,

1034
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,322
it would lead me to where I'm supposed to be,

1035
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,891
but I failed them.

1036
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,010
What do you want me to do?

1037
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,441
Begone! Away with you!

1038
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,446
- God?
- Now it's talking back.

1039
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,920
There's nothing to fear, Zach.

1040
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,520
It's all a figment of your imagination.

1041
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,360
This really realistic vision
of a donkey who's talking to God

1042
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,522
- and won't stop eyeballing you.
- Zach.

1043
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,765
Pull yourself together.

1044
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,406
What's your name, sweetie?

1045
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,200
Bo.

1046
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,040
Bo is a funny word.

1047
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,440
Bo, Bo, Bo.

1048
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,960
- Bo, Bo.
- What?

1049
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,040
- Bo, Bo!
- He has a name?

1050
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,040
- And she's singing him a song?
- I'm doomed.

1051
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,560
- Bo!
- I kind of like that.

1052
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,040
They're not usually like this.

1053
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,611
You caught us at a bad time.

1054
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,680
We haven't slept in nine months.

1055
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,603
- Nine months?
- Not a wink.

1056
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,680
So that explains your eyes.

1057
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,649
What? What's wrong with my eyes?

1058
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,366
Nothing.

1059
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,360
Yep, no sleep at all

1060
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,966
since that giant night light turned on.

1061
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,520
- Light?
- All you can do

1062
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,126
is lie awake and listen to the crickets.

1063
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,726
Ta-da.

1064
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,800
Sorry. So excited.

1065
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,080
Zach and Edith don't like the spotlight,

1066
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,208
but I think it's beautiful.

1067
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,607
It's here.

1068
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,125
I can't believe this.

1069
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,240
- Me, neither.
- You don't understand.

1070
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,084
That light, that's the star.

1071
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,282
This is where it's been leading me.

1072
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,880
But Mary... Joseph...

1073
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,610
Guys, I gotta get out of here.

1074
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,287
- Can you help me?
- I got you. I'm gonna chew him free.

1075
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,243
- Woody.
- No. Try biting the...

1076
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,164
I know! I'll sing you free.

1077
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,600
That was beautiful, but not helpful.

1078
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,603
I think I got a splinter in my tongue.

1079
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,646
Step aside.

1080
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,284
Yes, yes! That's perfect.

1081
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,168
Now I just gotta get past that gate.

1082
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,160
Has that ever worked for you?

1083
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,651
No, actually.

1084
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,170
Come on. Up you go.

1085
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,800
Thanks, guys.

1086
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,647
Gotta run. Mary's having a baby!

1087
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,680
- A baby?
- I love babies.

1088
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,360
Bring 'em back here.
There's plenty of room in the stable.

1089
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,841
Great. Now we'll never sleep.

1090
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,880
What?

1091
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,485
No, no, no, no.

1092
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,680
Bo, buddy, where are you?

1093
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,808
Bo, are you there?

1094
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,721
Bo? Bo!

1095
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,803
Bo! Hey, Bo.

1096
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,201
Bo!

1097
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,080
- Ruth.
- You're here.

1098
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,840
- Dave.
- We've gotta help Mary and Joseph.

1099
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,000
I know. Where are they?

1100
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,889
Yeah, we hadn't gotten that far.

1101
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,487
The dogs are here.
We can't take them on our own.

1102
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,640
We need to find help.

1103
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,962
- You can count on us!
- We won't let you down!

1104
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,010
They went that way.

1105
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,560
What are we doing? We're not gonna
stop those giant, scary dogs

1106
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,160
with a fluffy sheep and a tiny donkey.

1107
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,208
Even with a very masculine and brave dove.

1108
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,760
We need backup.

1109
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,491
Where do you find a dog-eating
hippopotamus in Bethlehem?

1110
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,962
A three-headed camel? Nice.

1111
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,804
Help! Help!

1112
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,850
Help! Anybody!

1113
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,571
Look, a flock of sheep.

1114
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,243
That kind of looks like my...

1115
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,124
That's my flock.

1116
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,960
Help.

1117
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,963
Is there anybody else?

1118
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,808
No? Okay.

1119
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,040
Bo needs my help.

1120
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,963
Okay, you can do this. Here we go.

1121
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,363
Hey, everybody.

1122
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,720
What's up?

1123
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,930
It's me, Ruth.

1124
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,165
Okay.

1125
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,600
I know you guys think I was crazy
to leave and follow the star,

1126
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,120
but you wouldn't believe
all the adventures I've had out there.

1127
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,600
And the biggest one of all
is happening tonight.

1128
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,280
I've made new friends,
and they need our help.

1129
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,125
So, this time, you gotta follow me.

1130
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,931
Guys?

1131
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,284
This is important!

1132
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,961
Fear not.

1133
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,680
I bring good tidings of great joy.

1134
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,570
For unto you is born this day a savior,

1135
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,445
Christ, the Lord.

1136
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,882
Told ya it was important.

1137
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,322
I'm sorry. There's no room.

1138
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,961
Sorry.

1139
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,207
I'm sorry.

1140
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,166
Joseph, I can't go any further.

1141
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,444
All right, all right, Mary, here.

1142
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,645
Just...

1143
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,691
Here. Lay here.

1144
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,960
Mary? Mary, look at me.

1145
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,880
You're doing great.

1146
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,280
Remember, God chose us for a reason.

1147
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,930
This must be part of His plan.

1148
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,730
Help us. Help us.

1149
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,851
Please, God, help us.

1150
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,283
Mary! Joseph!

1151
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,045
Not good.

1152
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,208
No, no, no, no, that's not good at all.

1153
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,763
- Bo?
- Bo? You're back!

1154
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,162
Buddy, we need somewhere to go.

1155
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,970
Mary, let's go.

1156
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,210
Guys, guys.

1157
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,640
- I found them.
- We're all set.

1158
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,041
It's not much, but there's plenty of light.

1159
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,440
No, no, no, this isn't gonna work.

1160
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,966
We can't have the baby here.
Mary, we need stronger bedding.

1161
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,764
- You know, we need warmer...
- Joseph.

1162
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,251
It's time.

1163
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,240
Thank you.

1164
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,203
Well, well...

1165
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,970
Look who it is.

1166
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,560
We should've eaten him
the first time we met him.

1167
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,041
But, Rufus, if we had eaten him,

1168
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,647
he would never have led us here.

1169
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,048
We've been meaning to thank you.

1170
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,403
Now, be a good little donkey and run along.

1171
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,728
You've served your purpose.

1172
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,920
You guys are pretty scary.

1173
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,120
Yeah. And you might be stronger than I am.

1174
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,760
But if you wanna get to my friends,

1175
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,127
you're gonna have to get past me first.

1176
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,601
No problem, donkey!

1177
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,882
Getting past you is my middle name.

1178
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,560
What is that?

1179
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,080
What's what? I wasn't
supposed to look, was I?

1180
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,605
Donkey kick!

1181
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,728
You just made a big mistake.

1182
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,931
You're mine!

1183
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,923
Not gonna let you do this!

1184
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,365
No, no, no, no, no.

1185
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,526
No. Mary! Joseph!

1186
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,520
Mary.

1187
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,931
I'm sorry.

1188
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,049
For the flock!

1189
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,084
Coming at you, bro!

1190
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,522
- I don't wanna die!
- Somebody, help.

1191
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,165
It's just another cliff.

1192
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,481
Grab hold of this.

1193
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,246
Come on.

1194
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,691
Bo?

1195
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,487
Bo, you're doing it.

1196
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,800
Excellent climbing form, Bo.

1197
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,450
Be the wedge.

1198
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,490
We're bad dogs.

1199
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,891
You don't have to be.

1200
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,045
You're free now.

1201
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,000
Bo, where are you going?

1202
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,440
We've got a baby to meet.

1203
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,726
Come on.

1204
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,880
After all that, it is a baby shower.

1205
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,644
You were right the whole time.

1206
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,880
You had it right as well.
It is a birthday party.

1207
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,486
Literally, it's the day of his birth.

1208
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,489
I'm gonna let 'em have this one.

1209
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,367
<i>Holy</i>

1210
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:02,520
<i>Holy</i>

1211
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,687
<i>O holy night</i>

1212
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:13,120
<i>The stars are brightly shining</i>

1213
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,880
<i>It is the night</i>

1214
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:21,603
<i>Of our dear Savior's birth</i>

1215
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,245
<i>Long lay the world</i>

1216
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,328
<i>In sin and error pining...</i>

1217
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,971
Hey, little guy.

1218
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,285
It's okay, Bo.

1219
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,369
<i>A thrill of hope</i>

1220
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,320
<i>The weary world rejoices</i>

1221
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,960
Everybody, everybody, listen up.

1222
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,960
There's this huge guy with two dogs
coming after Mary,

1223
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,202
and if we don't do something now,
then the baby's not gonna...

1224
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,720
Looks like...

1225
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,200
Looks like you guys handled it.

1226
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,361
Sweet.

1227
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,446
This seat taken?

1228
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,846
Everyone,

1229
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,605
this is Mary and Joseph.

1230
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,211
And that's their new baby.

1231
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,251
The flock is growing.

1232
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,046
No. Not happening. Don't even think about it.

1233
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,203
It's okay. Let them in.

1234
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,404
Look with your eyes.

1235
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,920
See?

1236
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,411
He's just a baby.

1237
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,760
Look at him.

1238
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,491
Thaddeus, are we good dogs now?

1239
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,769
We have to try.

1240
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,561
Is...

1241
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,040
I'm sorry. Is this your stable?

1242
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,320
No, no, no.

1243
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,687
We've come to honor the new king.

1244
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,200
I'm sorry.

1245
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,089
King? Where? What...

1246
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,091
What is he talking about? A king?

1247
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,286
What's his name?

1248
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,484
His name is Jesus.

1249
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,043
For Jesus, gold.

1250
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,926
Myrrh.

1251
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,889
Do you guys like frankincense?

1252
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,771
I never know what to get.

1253
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,087
Thank you.

1254
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,920
For the newborn king.

1255
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,448
<i>A thrill of hope</i>

1256
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:54,160
<i>The weary world rejoices</i>

1257
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:58,131
<i>For yonder breaks</i>

1258
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,000
<i>A new and glorious morn</i>

1259
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:09,160
<i>Fall on your knees</i>

1260
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,920
Guys, I carried a king on my back.

1261
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
We're never gonna hear
the end of this, are we?

1262
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,287
And I hope we never do.

1263
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,606
You know, I think people
are gonna remember this night.

1264
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,080
What happened here around this manger

1265
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,720
will be celebrated for thousands of years.

1266
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:29,560
Families will come together
and exchange presents and sing carols.

1267
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:34,680
All to remember the grace of this moment
that we are witnessing right now.

1268
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,882
- Okay, Deborah.
- She's back to talking crazy again.

1269
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,767
Hey. It's okay.

1270
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,087
Thank you.
