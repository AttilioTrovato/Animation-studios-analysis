5
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,801

6
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:31,536

00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:37,743
With great power comes
great responsibility.

10
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:42,184
<i>I saved a bunch of people,
fell in love, saved the city.</i>

11
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:45,151
<i>And then
I saved the city again.</i>

12
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:46,285
<i>And again and again</i>

13
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:47,586

00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:48,588

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,188

Where's my laptop?

50
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,814
If you want me to drive you,
we gotta go now.

51
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:23,349
No, Dad, I'll walk.

52
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,384
- Personal chauffeur going once.
- It's okay.

53
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,754

57
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:39,932
See you Friday.

58
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,770
Look who's back.
Yo, what's going on, bro?

59
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:47,839
Hey, I'm just walking
by. How you doin'?

60
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,777
Yo, Miles! You feel
that earthquake last night?

61
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:54,847
What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.

62
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,748
- How's that new school?
- So easy.

63
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,018
- We miss you, Miles.
- You miss me? I still live here!

64
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,254
Wait, you miss me?

Oh, come on.

67
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,969
Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.

68
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,572
You can walk plenty
on Saturday

69
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:20,839
when you peel
those stickers off.

70
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,907
You saw that?
I don't know if that was me.

71
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,909
And the two from yesterday
on Clinton.

72
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,445
Yeah, those were me.

73
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,649
Look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

74
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:32,351
- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.

75
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:34,286
- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.

76
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:37,022
"Foam Party"? Come on.

77
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:39,392
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?

78
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:40,558
I see it.

79
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,060
Is that a coffee shop
or a disco?

80
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,762
Dad, you're old, man.

81
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:45,563
<i>There are multiple reports</i>

82
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,465

<i>Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.</i>

84
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:52,904
Spider-Man. I mean,
this guy swings in once a day,

85
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,340
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

86
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:56,508
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

87
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,010
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

88
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:00,445
- lives on the line, no masks.
- Uh-huh.

89
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:03,416
- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.

90
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:05,418
With great ability
comes great accountability.

91
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,019
That's not even
how the saying goes.

92
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:09,555
I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.

93

You've given it
two weeks.

100
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,842
We're not having
this conversation.

101
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,044
I just think that
this new school is elitist.

102
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:34,647
- "Elitist"?
- And I would prefer to be

103
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,448
at a normal school
among the people.

104
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,383
"The people"?
These are your people.

105
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,820
I'm only here 'cause
I won that stupid lottery.

106
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:43,556
No way. You passed the entry
test just like everybody else.

107
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:46,125
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?

108
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,827
You wanna end up
like your uncle?

109
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:50,895
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

110
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:52,464
We all make choices in life.

111
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,998
It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,436
You don't!

113
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:10,015
I love you, Miles.

114
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,921
Yeah, I know, Dad.
See you Friday.

115
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:19,657
- You gotta say "I love you" back.
- Dad, are you serious?

116
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:20,793
I wanna hear it.
"I love you, Dad."

117
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:22,460
You wanna hear me
say it?

118
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:23,828
You're dropping me off
at a school.

119
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,029
- "I love you, Dad."
- Look at this place.

120
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,031
"Dad, I love you."

121
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:30,770
Dad, I love you.

122
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,438
That's a copy.

123
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,539
Tie your shoes, please.

Oh, my gosh!
This is embarrassing.

128
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,188
We wore the same jacket.

129
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,489
Hey. Your shoe's untied.

130
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:54,527

Maybe you guys are early.

00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,743
Sorry.
It was just so quiet.

146
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,046
Would you like
to keep standing there,

147
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,113

00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:04,496
I mean, it wasn't funny.
That's why I laughed.

153
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,731
But it was smart,
so I liked it.

154
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,267
I don't think

155
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:09,969

you'd probably have
to kick me outta here, huh?

Maybe I'm just not right
for this school.

162
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,121
If a person wearing a blindfold

164
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,825
do you know
what score they would get?

- 50%?
- That's right!

166
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:36,861
The only way to get
all the answers wrong

167
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,164
is to know
which answers are right.

168

Peace.</i>

347
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,197
<i>No. No-No-No-No-No.</i>

348
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,466
<i>It's not possible!</i>

349
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:43,334
<i>It's just puberty.</i>

350
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:46,204
<i>It's a normal spider
and I'm a normal kid!</i>

351
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,645
All right!

352
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:56,851
<i>I gotta tell someone.</i>

353
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,544
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.

354
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,846
Find the spider.

355
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,450
You'll see.

356
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,665
It's a normal spider.

357
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:51,870
It's, like, boring
how normal this spider is.

358
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:02,613
<i>I'm right here.</i>

359
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,885
<i>Why is this happening to me?</i>

360
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,594
<i>Slow down! What am I doing?</i>

361
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:20,732
<i>Way over there.</i>

362
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:21,899
<i>You're like me.</i>

363
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,735
<i>Miles. Look out.</i>

364
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,437
<i>I don't wanna be a hero.</i>

365
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,507
<i>Miles.</i>

366
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,575
Whoa!

367
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,679
Norman, listen to me.

368
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:37,415
<i>Spider-Man?</i>

369
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:40,351
I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.

370
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:42,456
Brooklyn is not zoned
for that.

371
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,590
It's not up to me.

372
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,324
<i>Is that Green Goblin?!</i>

373
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:48,860
Why won't you quit?!

374
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:51,795
I guess I like Brooklyn not
being sucked into a black hole.

375
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:53,497
I think I'm gonna go.

376
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:55,435
Staten Island, maybe.
Not Brooklyn.

377
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,573
No! No!

378
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:25,900
Whoa!

379
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,301
What now?

380
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:30,738
What is this place?

381
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,566
Did you know your shoes
are untied?

382
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,700
- Uh-huh.
- This is a onesie,

383
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,638
so I don't really
have to worry about it.

384
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:13,678
I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.

385
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,112
I don't wanna be.

386
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:18,015
I don't think
you have a choice, kiddo.

387
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,584
Got a lot going through
your head, I'm sure.

388
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:21,886
Yeah.

389
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:24,421
You're gonna be fine.
I can help you.

390
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,791
If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.

391
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,127
Yeah.

392
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:32,464
I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick

393
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,532
before the space-time
continuum collapses.

394
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:35,534
Don't move.

395
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:40,104
See you in a bit.

396
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:52,486
<i>How does he do that?</i>

397
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:58,022
Is it here?
No, no, it's here.

398
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:00,457
All right, folks.

399
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,594
I always get this wrong.

400
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:04,063
Oh, boy.

401
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,030
Prowler.

402
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,870
Man, I was in
the middle of something.

403
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:16,043
I am so tired.

404
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,916
Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.

405
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,591
That all you got?

406
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,691
Aw, so gross.

407
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:37,829
<i>I should go
up there and help him.</i>

408
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:40,598
<i>Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.</i>

409
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:50,073
Watch out.
Here comes the Spider-Man.

410
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:52,075
You like my new toy?

411
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:56,514
Cost me a fortune, but, hey,
can't take it with you, right?

412
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:59,784
You came all this way.
Watch the test.

413
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,218
It's a hell of a freaking
light show.

414
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
You're gonna love this.

415
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:09,060
No! No,
don't do this! Stop!

416
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:12,530
You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!

417
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:30,047
I see multiple
dimensions opening!

418
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:35,018
That was three, four
and five separate dimensions.

419
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,023
It's unstable! We should stop.

420
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:52,006
Norm, what's your take
on head trauma?

421
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,844
I tried to warn you, pal.

422
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:13,694
Goblin, no!
Get him outta there!

423
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:21,802
<i>Wilson! Where are we?</i>

424
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:25,570
<i>Really weird.</i>

425
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:26,940
<i>Wilson!</i>

426
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:02,940
Hey! Are you okay?

427
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:04,978
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm just resting.

428
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,646
- Can't you get up?
- Yeah.

429
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:10,848
Yeah, I always get up.

430
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:14,686
The coughing's
probably not a good sign.

431
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,720
Find him. Now.

432
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:20,024
Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.

433
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:22,893
This override key is the only
way to stop the collider.

434
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:26,598
Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.

435
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,931
You need to hide your face.

436
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,168
You don't tell anyone
who you are.

437
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,236
No one can know. He's got
everyone in his pocket.

438
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:35,105
If he turns
the machine on again,

439
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:37,041
everything you know
will disappear.

440
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:38,976
Your family, everyone.

441
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:41,379
Everyone.

442
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:43,784
Promise me you'll do this.

443
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:49,653
I promise.

444
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:52,623
Go. Destroy the collider.

445
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,092
I'll come and find you.

446
00:26:55,828 --> 00:26:56,996
It's gonna be okay.

447
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:06,803
Tombstone.

448
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,007
We're done with tests.

449
00:27:09,776 --> 00:27:12,976
Get that thing ready
to go again. And soon.

450
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,946
Run faster!

451
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,680
These guys are weak.

452
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:19,417
I'd say it's nice
to see you again, Spider-Man,

453
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:20,784
but it's not.

454
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:22,285
Hey, Kingpin.
How's business?

455
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,888
Boomin'. Heh.

456
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,225
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

457
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:29,826
This might open a
black hole under Brooklyn.

458
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:32,263
It can't be worth the risk.

459
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:35,102
It's not always
about the money, Spider-Man.

460
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:42,939
Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?

461
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,010
Wait.

462
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,246
I know
what you're trying to do,

463
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:50,047
and it won't work.

464
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,151
They're gone.

465
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:06,730
Get rid of the body.

466
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,332
What was that?

467
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,273
Kill that guy.

468
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:50,408
Stop sticking!

469
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:11,931
<i>Stand clear
of the closing doors, please.</i>

470
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,826
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

471
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:50,101
Police! Put your hands up!

472
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:51,839
Miles? Miles?

473
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:54,572
Why aren't you
at school?

474
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:57,909
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

475
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:00,178
Miles?
<i>¿Qué te pasa?</i>

476
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:04,250
Is it the earthquake?

477
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:07,552
Can I sleep here tonight?

478
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,219
Miles.
It's a weeknight.

479
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,155
You made a commitment
to that school.

480
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:12,760
He's upset.

481
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,163
Of course you can stay.

482
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,932
- Dad?
- Yeah.

483
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:24,134
Do you really hate
Spider-Man?

484
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,939
Yeah. I mean, with
a vigilante, there is...

485
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:30,240
Jeff, <i>mi amor.</i>

486
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,209
What? He asked me.

487
00:30:32,211 --> 00:30:34,847
Baby, you know how I feel
about Spider-Man. Come on.

488
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:38,983
<i>Tú sabes que
él te quiere mucho.</i>

489
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:41,919
That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?

490
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:46,290
Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?

491
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:49,994
Our family doesn't run
from things, Miles.

492
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:52,132
Yeah, I know.

493
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:56,467
What's that about?

494
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:58,236
He's having a hard time, Jeff.

495
00:30:58,238 --> 00:30:59,570
When it gets hard,

496
00:30:59,572 --> 00:31:01,371
that's when
he's gotta stick it out.

497
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:11,082

00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:22,455
<i>He didn't ask for his powers,</i>

523
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:29,126
<i>but he chose to be Spider-Man.</i>

524
00:32:29,128 --> 00:32:31,728
<i>My favorite thing about Peter</i>

525
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,533
<i>is that he made us each
feel powerful.</i>

526
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:39,536
<i>We all have powers
of one kind or another.</i>

527
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:42,273
<i>♪ Of the dark... ♪</i>

528
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:44,175
But in our own way.

529
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:46,177
We are all Spider-Man.

530
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:49,746
<i>And we're all
counting on you.</i>

531
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:51,614
They're counting on me.

532
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:55,321
Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.

533
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:49,132
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

534
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:52,703
That thing you gave me,
that key

535
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:55,674
I think I really messed it up.

536
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:59,509
I wanna do what you asked.

537
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,312
I really do.

538
00:35:01,314 --> 00:35:04,380
But I'm sorry.

539
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:07,650
I'm not sure I'm the guy.

540
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:10,587
I can't do this without you.

541
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:12,156
Hey, kid.

542
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:15,728
Whoa!

543
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:20,132
What did I do to him?!

544
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:32,611
No.

545
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:38,685
Who <i>are</i> you?

546
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,823
<i>All right, people,
let's do this one last time.</i>

547
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:48,359
<i>My name is Peter B. Parker.</i>

548
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:51,562
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

549
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:53,797
<i>And for the last 22 years,</i>

550
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:57,536
<i>I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

551
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,370
What a day.

552
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:02,705
<i>I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.</i>

553
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:05,609
<i>You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married,</i>

554
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,777
<i>saved the city some more,
maybe too much.</i>

555
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,681
<i>My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.</i>

556
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:12,850
<i>Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.</i>

557
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:15,786
<i>Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.</i>

558
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:18,422
<i>I broke my back,
a drone flew into my face,</i>

559
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:19,489
<i>I buried Aunt May.</i>

560
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,591
<i>My wife and I split up.</i>

561
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:23,826
<i>But I handled it
like a champion.</i>

562
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:25,696
<i>'Cause, you know what,</i>

563
00:36:25,698 --> 00:36:27,531
<i>no matter
how many times I get hit,</i>

564
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:30,433
<i>I always get back up.</i>

565
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:37,607
<i>And I got a lot of time
to reflect and work on myself.</i>

566
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,743
<i>Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?</i>

567
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:42,712
<i>Could you imagine?</i>

568
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:45,882
<i>A seahorse seeing
another seahorse</i>

569
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,784
<i>and then making it work?</i>

570
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:51,721
<i>She wanted kids and...</i>

571
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:53,559
<i>And it scared me.</i>

572
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:57,527
<i>I'm pretty sure
I broke her heart.</i>

573
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:59,897
<i>Flash-forward: I'm in
my apartment doing push-ups,</i>

574
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:01,931
<i>doing ab crunches,
getting strong,</i>

575
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,301
<i>when this weird thing
happened.</i>

576
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:07,638
<i>And I gotta say, weird things
happen to me a lot.</i>

577
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,609
<i>But this was real weird.</i>

578
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:53,852
Ow!

579
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:59,056
<i>You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.</i>

580
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,759
<i>Also, I was dead.</i>

581
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,426
<i>And blond.</i>

582
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:05,663
<i>I was kind of perfect.</i>

583
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:09,466
<i>It was like
looking in a mirror.</i>

584
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:11,502
<i>I have a feeling that
the thing</i>

585
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:12,935
<i>that brought me here</i>

586
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:15,839
<i>was the thing
that got him killed.</i>

587
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,875
<i>You wanna know
what happened next?</i>

588
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,413
<i>Me, too.</i>

589
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:24,882
Who <i>are</i> you?

590
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:26,850
What are
you doin' over there?

591
00:38:26,852 --> 00:38:29,319
Freeze! P.D.N.Y.

592
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:30,390
Stop!

593
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,426
Are you kidding me right now?

594
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:37,895
Stop! Stop!

595
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:39,596
I gotcha. I gotcha.

596
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:41,401
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

597
00:38:43,736 --> 00:38:46,536
- Hey, kid. Get over here!
- Come on, now!

598
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:47,538
Whoa.

599
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:51,641
See you, officers!

600
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:52,911
Aw, come on.

601
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:01,018
- Hey, kid.
- Kid, come on, now!

602
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,722
Put 'em up, son!

603
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,125
Uh... <i>adiós?</i>

604
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:14,931
Help!
Somebody stop that train!

605
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:34,118
Oh, hey. What the...?

606
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:38,491
Sorry.

607
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:45,431
I'm gonna die!

608
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:51,902
<i>Looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man</i>

609
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:54,004
<i>dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.</i>

610
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,540
Yes! I didn't kill you.

611
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,542
- Who are you?
- Who are <i>you?</i>

612
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:00,710
Why are you trying to kill me?

613
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:02,481
I'm not. I'm trying to save you.

614
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:24,033
Hey, maybe you
guys can go around?

615
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:27,673
All right. Thanks, New York.

616
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,549
<i>What was that?</i>

617
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:42,085
<i>Kid electrocuted me</i>

618
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:43,953
<i>with his hands.</i>

619
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,759
- You're like me.
- I got some questions.

620
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:56,098
Why do you look like
Peter Parker?

621
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:00,103
Because I am Peter Parker.

622
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:02,973
Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?

623
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:05,509
Why are you older?
And why is your body

624
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:06,976
a different shape?

625
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:08,779
Pretty sure
you just called me fat.

626
00:41:08,781 --> 00:41:10,746
You don't look
so hot either, kid.

627
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,882
Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.

628
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,016
- Are you a ghost?
- No.

629
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,486
- Are you a zombie?
- Stop it.

630
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:17,154
- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.

631
00:41:17,156 --> 00:41:19,890
Are you from another dimension?
Like a parallel universe

632
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:21,225
where things are like
this universe but different?

633
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:23,092
And you're Spider-Man
in that universe?

634
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:24,995
But somehow traveled
to this universe,

635
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:26,163
but you don't know how?

636
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:27,797
Wow. That was really
just a guess?

637
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:29,665
We learned about it
in physics.

638
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,701
- Quantum theory.
- This is amazing!

639
00:41:31,703 --> 00:41:33,770
You can teach me
like Peter said he would.

640
00:41:33,772 --> 00:41:34,871
Before he died.

641
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:36,138
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah, right.

642
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,908
Look, I made a promise
to him.

643
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,609
Here's lesson number one,
kid.

644
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:42,712
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

645
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:49,189
Peter, seriously...

646
00:41:51,056 --> 00:41:53,223
Trust me, kid.

647
00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:55,558
This'll all make you
a better Spider-Man.

648
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:02,266
Hey, are you okay?

649
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,667
No, I'm not.

650
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:05,067
What's going on
with your body?

651
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:06,969
I don't think my atoms
are real jazzed

652
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,739
about being
in the wrong dimension.

653
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:12,909
Look, I'm not looking
for a side gig

654
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:14,310
as a Spider-Man coach.

655
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:16,612
I got a lot going on
in my dimension.

656
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:18,714
"With great power
comes great..."

657
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:20,317
Don't you dare
finish that sentence.

658
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,085
Don't do it!
I'm sick of it.

659
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,859
Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.

660
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:30,027
I don't have a choice!

661
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:31,594
Kingpin's got
a supercollider.

662
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:33,029
He's tryin' to kill me.

663
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:35,098
- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

664
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,199
Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?

665
00:42:37,201 --> 00:42:39,069
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

666
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:40,237
- Goodbye.
- Where you going?

667
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,904
When it runs again,
I'll jump in

668
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:43,339
- and get back to my life.
- You can't let them run it.

669
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,908
I'm supposed to destroy it

670
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,976
so it never runs again
or everyone's gonna die.

671
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:50,647
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

672
00:42:50,649 --> 00:42:53,650
But there's always a little bit
of time before everybody dies

673
00:42:53,652 --> 00:42:55,018
and that's when I do
my best work.

674
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,719
Aren't you gonna need this?

675
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,321
Aw, you have a goober.
Give it.

676
00:42:58,323 --> 00:43:01,792
Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.

677
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:04,627
There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.

678
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:05,862
I can never remember,

679
00:43:05,864 --> 00:43:07,096
so I always call it
a goober. Give it.

680
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:08,832
I need it
to destroy the collider.

681
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,232
I need it to go home.

682
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:11,835
I'll swallow it.
Don't play with me.

683
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:13,971
- What?
- I said...

684
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:16,373
The collider created a portal
that brought me here.

685
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,007
And I have to get...

686
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:22,145
- Did you break this?
- No, it broke.

687
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:23,779
I don't remember
what happened.

688
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:25,315
See, this is why
I never had kids.

689
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:26,882
Can't we make another one?

690
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:28,919
<i>We</i> can't do anything.
Thanks to you,

691
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:31,888
I have to re-steal what
your guy stole from Alchemax

692
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,757
and make another one of these.

693
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:36,792
If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave,

694
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:38,295
everyone in this city,

695
00:43:38,297 --> 00:43:41,163
my parents, my uncle and
millions of others, will die.

696
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:42,833
And you're just gonna
go home

697
00:43:42,835 --> 00:43:45,134
and leave me here
to figure this out for myself?

698
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:48,106
- You good with that, Spider-Man?
- Yeah.

699
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,348
What are you doing?

700
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:03,719
Making you feel guilty.
Is it working?

701
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:05,989
How could it...? No.
Look at me.

702
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,757
Does it look like
it's working?

703
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:11,296
No. No, it's not...

704
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:17,937
No! No! No!
Do not let him win!

705
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,370
All right, kid. You win.

706
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:22,873
Come on, we don't have
a second to lose.

707
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,708
Mmm. I love this burger.
So delicious.

708
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,678
One of the best burgers
I've ever had.

709
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,346
In my universe, this place
closed six years ago.

710
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,214
I don't know why.
I really don't.

711
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:33,218
Mmm.

712
00:44:35,254 --> 00:44:37,953
You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.

713
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,755
- Can we focus?
- Mm-hm. Sure.

714
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:42,294
- The other Peter...
- You gonna eat that?

715
00:44:43,328 --> 00:44:44,728
I'm listening.

716
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,328
The other Peter said
he was gonna be

717
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,230
- showing me the ropes.
- Wow.

718
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,966
You got any Spider-Man
tips you can tell me now?

719
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:51,967
Yeah, I got plenty.

720
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:53,402
Disinfect the mask.

721
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:55,871
You're gonna wanna use
baby powder in the suit,

722
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:57,074
heavy on the joints.

723
00:44:57,076 --> 00:44:59,241
You don't want
any chafing, right?

724
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:01,745
- Anything else?
- Nope, that was everything.

725
00:45:01,747 --> 00:45:03,446
I think you're gonna be
a bad teacher.

726
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:05,982
Uh-uh-uh?
Look up where Alchemax is.

727
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:09,351
"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."

728
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:10,853
You can teach me

729
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:12,121
to swing on the way there.

730
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:17,794
I'm not swinging to
the Hudson Valley, Miles.

731
00:45:17,796 --> 00:45:19,730
Not after a hearty
burger breakfast.

732
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:22,035
Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.

733
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:26,203
<i>♪ I can see a new horizon ♪</i>

734
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:28,038
<i>♪ Underneath the blazing sky ♪</i>

735
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,208
<i>♪ I'll be where the eagle's
Flying higher... ♪</i>

736
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,375
- And it's a no on the cape.
- I think it's cool.

737
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:35,112
Take that off.
It's disrespectful.

738
00:45:35,114 --> 00:45:37,080
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

739
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:40,183
So how do we
retrace Peter's steps?

740
00:45:40,185 --> 00:45:42,152
That's a good question.

741
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:44,991
What would I do
if I were me?

742
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:47,156
Got it.

743
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,158
<i>Step One:
I infiltrate the lab.</i>

744
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,127
<i>Two: Find the head scientist's
computer.</i>

745
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:53,330
<i>That lady with the
bike is the head scientist.</i>

746
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:55,397
<i>I saw her
in this documentary.</i>

747
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:57,833
<i>Cool! Step Three: I
reexamine my personal biases.</i>

748
00:45:57,835 --> 00:45:59,069
<i>Step Four:
I hack the computer.</i>

749
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:00,402
It's not technically
hacking.

750
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:02,438
Not now. I just lost
my train of thought.

751
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,373
<i>Step Five:
Download the important stuff.</i>

752
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,176
<i>I'll know it when I see it.</i>

753
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:09,045
<i>Step Six: I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.</i>

754
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:10,813
So, what am I doing?

755
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:13,949
Step Seven: You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.

756
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:16,553
Look, man. You gotta teach me
how to do Spider-Man stuff

757
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:18,154
or I won't be able
to help.

758
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:22,259
Watch and learn, kid!
I'll quiz ya later!

759
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,295
Why did I get stuck with

760
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:28,531
the janky, old, broke
hobo Spider-Man?!

761
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:31,935
That's new.

762
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,248
Kingpin.

763
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,951
<i>What am I doing?
What am I doing?</i>

764
00:46:47,953 --> 00:46:49,388
<i>What am I doing?
What am I doing?</i>

765
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,931
Whoa!

766
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,004
Peter!

767
00:47:08,006 --> 00:47:09,839
Peter!

768
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:11,208
Peter!

769
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,310
- What are you doing here?
- Kingpin's here.

770
00:47:13,312 --> 00:47:14,844
Just move over.

771
00:47:14,846 --> 00:47:17,547
You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.

772
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:20,049
No! I can't sit there
and let Spider-Man die

773
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:21,518
without doing anything
about it.

774
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,020
I'm not doing that again.

775
00:47:24,022 --> 00:47:25,621
What?

776
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:29,592
Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me,

777
00:47:29,594 --> 00:47:31,263
so you're
a nice change of pace.

778
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:34,563
Mr. Fisk!
Look at this data.

779
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:36,466
I know you can't
really understand it,

780
00:47:36,468 --> 00:47:38,136
but these are
really good numbers.

781
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:40,971
And I got the password.

782
00:47:40,973 --> 00:47:43,406
Mr. Fisk.
If we fire again this week

783
00:47:43,408 --> 00:47:46,042
there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.

784
00:47:46,044 --> 00:47:47,576
You see this? And this?

785
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:49,212
This is multiple dimensions

786
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:51,448
beginning to crash
into each other.

787
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,616
This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes.

788
00:47:53,618 --> 00:47:55,384
You get used to it.
Watch this.

789
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:58,221
He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."

790
00:47:58,223 --> 00:47:59,522
You've got 24 hours.

791
00:47:59,524 --> 00:48:01,625
What this means is there
could be a rupture

792
00:48:01,627 --> 00:48:03,125
in the space-time
continuum.

793
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:04,361
Ooh. That's bad.

794
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:05,962
Actually, everything
she said was bad.

795
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:06,964
I was lying before.

796
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:18,310
Hold on. Let
me get you some more data.

797
00:48:20,178 --> 00:48:22,978
- What are you doing, bud?
- I can't move.

798
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,480
Okay, relax your fingers.

799
00:48:24,482 --> 00:48:27,516
We don't have time.
Just let go. Be in the moment.

800
00:48:27,518 --> 00:48:29,618
I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.

801
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,288
- I'm not refusing.
- No more excuses.

802
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,957
I just need more time.

803
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:36,058
They're right there.
They're gonna see you.

804
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,993
Miles, you gotta unstick.

805
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:39,929
What do you do to relax?

806
00:48:39,931 --> 00:48:43,033
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

807
00:48:43,035 --> 00:48:46,169
♪ Needless to say, I... ♪

808
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:48,203
Oh, for crying out loud.

809
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:50,973
♪ Callin' it quits
Now, baby, I'm a wreck ♪

810
00:48:52,477 --> 00:48:55,344
♪ You're a wreck, ooh... ♪

811
00:48:57,616 --> 00:49:00,052
Teenagers: just the worst.

812
00:49:02,421 --> 00:49:04,687
- Miles, where did you go?
- I'm right here.

813
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:08,123
- Where? I can't see ya.
- I'm right in front of you.

814
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,659
- Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
- Not in my universe.

815
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,562
Aah! You just poked me
in my eye!

816
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:15,332
This is incredible. Some kind
of fight or flight thing.

817
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:16,494
What's that?

818
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:21,603
Remember this password.
D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D...

819
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:22,605
Slow down!

820
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:26,042
-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

821
00:49:26,044 --> 00:49:28,344
- I need to write it down!
- Download the schematic.

822
00:49:28,346 --> 00:49:30,917
- How do I do that?
- While I turn on the charm.

823
00:49:32,984 --> 00:49:34,150
Spider-Man?

824
00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:36,752
Oh, hey.
Didn't see you there.

825
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:38,154
Wow.

826
00:49:38,156 --> 00:49:40,323
Okay, I'm kinda
freaking out right now.

827
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:42,158
You're supposed to be dead.

828
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,462
Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no.
We don't like that.

829
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:47,230
This is fascinating.

830
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:48,998
Okay, that's my face.

831
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,234
An entirely different
Peter Parker.

832
00:49:51,236 --> 00:49:54,069
Little bit of a gut, perhaps
from dimensional warping.

833
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:56,605
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. I was way
flatter before I warped.

834
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:58,475
Travel through the multiverse

835
00:49:58,477 --> 00:50:00,476
appears to have
deteriorated the...

836
00:50:00,478 --> 00:50:02,547
What was the rest?!

837
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:05,547
Hey, how old are you?

838
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:08,183
'Cause you don't look
a day over 35.

839
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:10,754
They said I was crazy!
They said I was crazy!

840
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:12,654
You showed
'em you're not crazy.

841
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,392
This might pinch a little.

842
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:19,362
I know. I just need
to get these samples.

843
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:20,596
Okay.

844
00:50:20,598 --> 00:50:22,399
Organize your desktop, lady.

845
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:25,370
Wow. Just complete
cellular decay.

846
00:50:26,571 --> 00:50:28,337
I've never seen
anything like this.

847
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:29,571
What are you doing?

848
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:31,507
I'm just taking the whole thing.

849
00:50:31,509 --> 00:50:33,308
And obviously
you've been glitching.

850
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,446
"Glitchin'"? No.
Why would you even say that?

851
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:38,380
If you stay in this dimension
too long,

852
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:40,049
your body's gonna
disintegrate.

853
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:42,051
Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?

854
00:50:42,053 --> 00:50:43,053
I don't know.

855
00:50:43,055 --> 00:50:45,154
You can't imagine.

856
00:50:45,156 --> 00:50:47,190
And I, for one,

857
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:48,995
can't wait to watch.

858
00:50:51,096 --> 00:50:52,495
What did you say
your name was?

859
00:50:52,497 --> 00:50:54,366
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

860
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:04,841
Can I assume that your friends
call you Doc Ock?

861
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:07,277
My friends
actually call me Liv.

862
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:09,712
My enemies call me Doc Ock.

863
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:11,281
I got this! Run!

864
00:51:11,283 --> 00:51:13,348
Who are you talking to?

865
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:18,221
- I got it!
- Oh, you "got it," Peter?

866
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:21,660
I got it handled, buddy!

867
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:25,163
Everything is fine!

868
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:29,299
Okay, this is

869
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:31,301
- a little bit bad.
- You're chatty.

870
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:32,303
Gotta go.

871
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:37,475
This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.

872
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:42,679
Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.

873
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:45,181
Peter!

874
00:51:45,183 --> 00:51:48,851
You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!

875
00:51:48,853 --> 00:51:50,786
Could you give me that back,
young man?

876
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:52,788
Peter!

877
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,227
It's proprietary.

878
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,598
Oh.

879
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,699
This'd be a good time

880
00:52:02,701 --> 00:52:04,366
- to turn invisible.
- Yep.

881
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:07,569
Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.

882
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:09,272
Act super normal.

883
00:52:09,274 --> 00:52:10,406
Spider-Man?

884
00:52:10,408 --> 00:52:11,607
You know, that's funny,

885
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:13,308
- I get that a lot.
- Hey.

886
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,545
- Spider-Man?
- Hey! Hands up!

887
00:52:15,547 --> 00:52:16,846
Now we do
a switchy-switchy.

888
00:52:16,848 --> 00:52:18,248
Get back here!

889
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,449
Where do you think
you're going?

890
00:52:19,451 --> 00:52:21,484
- He took a bagel!
- Time to swing,

891
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:23,853
- just like I taught ya.
- When did you teach me that?

892
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:26,455
I didn't. It's a little joke
for team-building.

893
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:28,223
Hey!

894
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:30,426
- All right, you ready?
- Of course I'm not ready!

895
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:33,663
I can't do this yet!

896
00:52:33,665 --> 00:52:35,732
Everybody knows
that the best way to learn

897
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:37,770
is under intense
life-threatening pressure.

898
00:52:40,906 --> 00:52:42,741
Come on, come on, come on.

899
00:52:46,678 --> 00:52:48,247
Uh-oh.

900
00:52:53,618 --> 00:52:55,618
What are you doing down there?

901
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,520
I run better than I swing.

902
00:52:57,522 --> 00:53:00,623
You gotta swing
or they'll catch you.

903
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,891
This is what you wanted.

904
00:53:08,466 --> 00:53:09,868
Uh-oh.

905
00:53:15,774 --> 00:53:17,473
Come back, little boy.

906
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:19,841
Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.

907
00:53:19,843 --> 00:53:22,312
Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!

908
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:23,779
Don't shoot off
your back foot.

909
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,482
- That's too many things!
- Then stop listening to me!

910
00:53:26,484 --> 00:53:29,555
That's the best idea
you've had all day!

911
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:39,164
Nice, Miles!

912
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:44,299
Good. You're doin' it.

913
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:46,902
Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.

914
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:48,770
Thwip and release.

915
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:52,007
- And thwip. Release. Thwip.
- And release.

916
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:53,775
You're a natural.
Thwip. Release.

917
00:53:53,777 --> 00:53:56,511
- Feel the rhythm?
- Thwip. And release!

918
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:57,714
Good, Miles.

919
00:53:57,716 --> 00:53:59,815
I gotta say,
you're amazing, man.

920
00:53:59,817 --> 00:54:01,350
We're a little team!

921
00:54:01,352 --> 00:54:03,319
Me as the teacher
who could still do it.

922
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:06,355
You as the student who can
do it, just not as good.

923
00:54:06,357 --> 00:54:09,194
I'm proud of us. Is there
something you want to say to me?

924
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:12,328
Peter!

925
00:54:24,776 --> 00:54:26,509
- What the...?
- Who did that?

926
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:54,404
Hey, guys.

927
00:54:54,406 --> 00:54:55,538
Gwanda?

928
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,339
It's Gwen, actually.

929
00:54:57,341 --> 00:55:00,310
Oh, you know her.
Very cool.

930
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:02,078
I'm from another dimension.

931
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,315
I mean,
another-another dimension.

932
00:55:05,317 --> 00:55:07,984
<i>All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.</i>

933
00:55:07,986 --> 00:55:09,719
<i>My name is Gwen Stacy.</i>

934
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:12,554
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

935
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:14,357
<i>And for the last two years,</i>

936
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:17,627
<i>I've been the one
and only Spider-Woman.</i>

937
00:55:17,629 --> 00:55:19,562
<i>You guys know the rest.</i>

938
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:21,033
<i>I joined a band.</i>

939
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:24,536
<i>Saved my dad.</i>

940
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:30,339
<i>I couldn't save my best friend,</i>

941
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:31,809
<i>Peter Parker,</i>

942
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,712
<i>so now I save everyone else.</i>

943
00:55:35,714 --> 00:55:38,647
<i>And I don't do friends
anymore,</i>

944
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:40,285
<i>just to avoid
any distractions.</i>

945
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:45,987
<i>And one day
this weird thing happened.</i>

946
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:49,060
<i>And I mean, like,
really weird.</i>

947
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:57,335
<i>I was blown into last week.</i>

948
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:02,871
<i>Literally.</i>

949
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:06,509
<i>I landed in New York,
but not my New York.</i>

950
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:09,478
<i>Lucky for these folks,</i>

951
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,748
<i>Spider-Man was there
to save the day.</i>

952
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,917
<i>My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.</i>

953
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:16,919
...you guys are early.

954
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:19,955
<i>Wasn't sure why
until I met you.</i>

955
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:20,957
Oh!

956
00:56:21,859 --> 00:56:23,125
I like your haircut.

957
00:56:23,127 --> 00:56:25,027
You don't get to like
my haircut.

958
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:26,529
Let's go.

959
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:27,864
How many more Spider-People
are there?

960
00:56:27,866 --> 00:56:29,031
Save it
for Comic-Con.

961
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:31,134
What's Comic-Con?
Whoa!

962
00:56:47,886 --> 00:56:49,685
You're dead, Spider-Man.

963
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:51,888
Wilson!
What are you doing?

964
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,054
Vanessa.

965
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,426
Richard, come on.

966
00:56:57,995 --> 00:56:59,862
Vanessa! Richard!

967
00:56:59,864 --> 00:57:01,496
<i>No!</i>

968
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:04,065
Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

969
00:57:22,886 --> 00:57:24,853
I killed Spider-Man.

970
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,922
Why did I just see two more?

971
00:57:26,924 --> 00:57:29,192
There's three, actually.

972
00:57:29,194 --> 00:57:32,228
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.

973
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,929
This means
you get what you want.

974
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:37,098
It means my collider works.

975
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,569
All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.

976
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:43,239
And the collider will bring
your family back.

977
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:45,844
As many families
as you want.

978
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,786
Tomorrow, at my collider.

979
00:57:57,788 --> 00:57:59,857
Our collider.

980
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:04,627
He broke this?

981
00:58:04,629 --> 00:58:07,163
Yeah. He's actually
really embarrassed about it,

982
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:09,265
so just keep
it between us, okay?

983
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:12,502
I know where we
can make a new one.

984
00:58:12,504 --> 00:58:14,703
And we won't let him
break it this time.

985
00:58:17,509 --> 00:58:18,911
I'm sorry about your friend.

986
00:58:20,611 --> 00:58:21,810
Thanks, Miles.

987
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:25,848
I know
how hard this is.

988
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,551
To have to figure
this stuff out on your own.

989
00:58:28,553 --> 00:58:31,721
It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.

990
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:33,121
Yeah.

991
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:36,958
If you ever decide
to do friends again,

992
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,696
I could always open up a slot.

993
00:58:40,064 --> 00:58:42,864
I'll keep you posted.

994
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,902
Cool.

995
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:51,540
We should probably go.

996
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:53,875
Peter, we're
literally on the doorstep.

997
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:55,777
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

998
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:57,312
Just relax.

999
00:58:57,314 --> 00:58:59,114
You guys are all very sweet,

1000
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:01,583
but no more fans today, please.

1001
00:59:04,922 --> 00:59:06,589
I'm not ready for this.

1002
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:12,830
Peter?

1003
00:59:14,698 --> 00:59:16,699
Hey, Aunt May.

1004
00:59:16,701 --> 00:59:18,734
So this is gonna
sound crazy,

1005
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:21,203
but I'm pretty sure
that I'm from an...

1006
00:59:21,205 --> 00:59:23,205
An alternate dimension.

1007
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:24,509
Yeah.

1008
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,877
You look tired, Peter.

1009
00:59:27,879 --> 00:59:30,078
Well, I am tired.

1010
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,248
- And older. And thicker.
- Yeah. I've heard that already.

1011
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,784
Oh, jeez.
Are those sweatpants?

1012
00:59:35,786 --> 00:59:38,020
Yup, that's what they are.

1013
00:59:38,022 --> 00:59:39,922
I was there,

1014
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:42,290
when it all happened.

1015
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:44,359
I am so sorry.

1016
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:46,629
And what dimension
are you from?

1017
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:48,698
Brooklyn.

1018
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,967
Did Peter have a place where we
could make another one of these?

1019
00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:53,772
A goober.

1020
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:56,237
Follow me.

1021
00:59:59,377 --> 01:00:01,643
Oh, yeah,
I got one of these, too.

1022
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:03,913
A little, old shed
where I keep my Spider-gear.

1023
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:18,296
I mean,
this place is pretentious.

1024
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:27,171
Whoa.

1025
01:00:31,808 --> 01:00:33,708
Dude. Was yours
anything like this?

1026
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,011
Mine was like this,

1027
01:00:35,013 --> 01:00:37,078
but take away the jeep,
the plane.

1028
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,882
Imagine it way smaller.
Imagine a futon.

1029
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:43,254
I feel sad for this guy.

1030
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:58,336
Hey, Peter.

1031
01:00:59,671 --> 01:01:01,837
I think this is a cape.

1032
01:01:17,422 --> 01:01:21,390
Peter knew
how dangerous the job was.

1033
01:01:21,392 --> 01:01:24,159
But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy

1034
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:25,897
was Spider-Man.

1035
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:29,330
Kingpin knows
we're coming.

1036
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:31,299
We're going to be
outnumbered.

1037
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:33,703
Don't be
so sure.

1038
01:01:33,705 --> 01:01:35,741
You might need these.

1039
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,247
You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?

1040
01:01:45,783 --> 01:01:47,248
Hey, fellas.

1041
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,951
Is he
in black and white?

1042
01:01:48,953 --> 01:01:51,353
Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.

1043
01:01:51,355 --> 01:01:53,154
Wherever I go,
the wind follows.

1044
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:56,027
And the wind,
it smells like rain.

1045
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:58,127
Hi, guys!

1046
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:05,734
This could literally not
get any weirder.

1047
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:08,504
It <i>can</i> get weirder.

1048
01:02:08,506 --> 01:02:11,810
I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.

1049
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,879
No other reason.

1050
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:23,220
You're like me.

1051
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:27,422
<i>My name is Peter Parker.</i>

1052
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:29,091
<i>My name is Peni Parker.</i>

1053
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:31,092
<i>My name is Peter Porker.</i>

1054
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:32,862
<i>I was
bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

1055
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:34,263
<i>I was bitten
by a radioactive pig.</i>

1056
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,431
<i>In my universe, it's 1933,</i>

1057
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,033
<i>and I'm a private eye.</i>

1058
01:02:38,035 --> 01:02:39,368
<i>I like to drink egg creams,</i>

1059
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:41,804
<i>and I like to fight Nazis.
A lot.</i>

1060
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:43,938
<i>I'm from New
York in the year 3145.</i>

1061
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,540
<i>I have a psychic link
with a spider</i>

1062
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:47,342
<i>who lives inside
my father's robot.</i>

1063
01:02:47,344 --> 01:02:49,978
<i>And we're best friends.
Forever.</i>

1064
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,047
<i>Sometimes I let
matches burn down to my fingertips</i>

1065
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:53,415
<i>just to feel something,
anything.</i>

1066
01:02:54,785 --> 01:02:55,817
<i>I'm a photographer</i>

1067
01:02:55,819 --> 01:02:56,919
<i>for the</i> Daily Beagle.

1068
01:02:56,921 --> 01:02:58,020
<i>When I'm not pooching around,</i>

1069
01:02:58,022 --> 01:02:59,455
<i>I'm working like a dog,</i>

1070
01:02:59,457 --> 01:03:00,790
<i>trying to sniff out
the latest story.</i>

1071
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:01,924
♪ I frolic and I dance ♪

1072
01:03:01,926 --> 01:03:02,958
♪ And I do this
With my pants ♪

1073
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,560
Okay! Enough!

1074
01:03:04,562 --> 01:03:07,830
So how did you
get here?

1075
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:10,000
Well, it's kind of
a long story.

1076
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:16,304
Maybe not
that long.

1077
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:19,408
And now we're just trying
to find a way home.

1078
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:23,978
The only way home is back
through that collider gizmo.

1079
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,313
The only trouble is...

1080
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:28,551
One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.

1081
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:29,984
- I'll do it. - I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

1082
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:32,388
No, no, no.
You guys don't get it.

1083
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,192
Don't get what?

1084
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:42,230
None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.

1085
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:44,466
I'm the guy
who's gonna turn it off.

1086
01:03:44,468 --> 01:03:48,304
And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.

1087
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:52,344
Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.

1088
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:58,446
Who are you
again?

1089
01:03:58,448 --> 01:03:59,848
This is Miles.

1090
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,417
And he's gonna save
the multiverse.

1091
01:04:01,419 --> 01:04:02,884
Yeah, man.

1092
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:04,486
This kid can turn himself
invisible.

1093
01:04:04,488 --> 01:04:06,020
Watch this.
He can do it now.

1094
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:11,594
- I can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.

1095
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:14,362
But it is cool. Show 'em
the zappy thing, Miles.

1096
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:19,467
- Can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.

1097
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:22,004
But he can do so much more.
What else do you do?

1098
01:04:22,006 --> 01:04:24,906
- Just those two things.
- Just those two things.

1099
01:04:24,908 --> 01:04:26,408
Aw, man.

1100
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:31,016
Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.

1101
01:04:32,183 --> 01:04:34,386
I think he's gonna
get us home.

1102
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:37,585
Okay, little fella,

1103
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:39,922
Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.

1104
01:04:39,924 --> 01:04:42,024
I'm talkin' hard boys,
real biscuit boxers.

1105
01:04:42,026 --> 01:04:43,926
Can you fight them
all off at once?

1106
01:04:43,928 --> 01:04:46,194
I haven't actually
fought anyone.

1107
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:47,332
Surprise attack!

1108
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:51,333
Can you rewire a mainframe
while being shot at?

1109
01:04:51,335 --> 01:04:52,400
- Can I what?
- Show me!

1110
01:04:52,402 --> 01:04:54,236
Surprise attack!

1111
01:04:54,238 --> 01:04:56,071
Can you swing and flip with
the grace of a trained dancer?

1112
01:04:56,073 --> 01:04:58,040
Can you close off your feelings
so you don't get crippled

1113
01:04:58,042 --> 01:04:59,942
by the moral ambiguity
of your violent actions?

1114
01:04:59,944 --> 01:05:02,076
Can you help your aunt create
an online dating profile

1115
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:04,078
so she can get out of
the dang house once in a while?

1116
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,348
Can you float through the air
when you smell a delicious pie?

1117
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,683
- Can you be strong?
- Ruthless?

1118
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:10,451
- Disciplined?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1119
01:05:10,453 --> 01:05:12,321
- Psychic?
- Show me some moxie, soldier!

1120
01:05:12,323 --> 01:05:15,223
Above all, no matter
how many times you get hit,

1121
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:16,658
can you get back up?

1122
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,627
'Cause when a Spider-Man
is on the floor...

1123
01:05:18,629 --> 01:05:20,529
When you think
you can't keep goin'...

1124
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:22,563
- Come on, Miles.
- Come on. You can do it.

1125
01:05:22,565 --> 01:05:24,632
- You can do this.
- Guys, cool it.

1126
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:27,569
- Come on. You can do it!
- Get up, Miles.

1127
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:29,607
Come on, Miles. Get up.

1128
01:05:36,147 --> 01:05:38,413
You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.

1129
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:39,647
He's not ready.
It's obvious.

1130
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:41,317
There's no way.
He's just a kid.

1131
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:42,518
If he can't do this,

1132
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,252
we have to stay
and do it for him.

1133
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:47,089
He's looking right at us
while we talk about him.

1134
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:48,524
Miles?

1135
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:49,558
Miles?

1136
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:55,730
You see that? He can, um...

1137
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:58,067
He can turn invisible.

1145
01:06:22,359 --> 01:06:24,528

either.

and we haven't heard
from him.

1153
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:48,616
And you know I wouldn't reach
out if this wasn't important.

1154
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:50,451

Has anyone
heard from Miles?

1175

Look, he's just clearing
his head. I know the kid.

1176
01:10:20,598 --> 01:10:22,463
He's got
what it takes.

1177
01:10:22,465 --> 01:10:25,234
I bet you he's gonna come back
through that door,

1178

recharged
and ready to fight.

- My uncle.
- Hey, where have you been?

1180
01:10:28,938 --> 01:10:31,405
My uncle Aaron,
he's the Prowler.

1181
01:10:31,407 --> 01:10:33,342
- Slow down, Miles.
- He works for Kingpin.

1182
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:34,942
He tried to kill me!

1183
01:10:34,944 --> 01:10:36,744
This is a pretty
hard-core origin story.

1184
01:10:36,746 --> 01:10:38,813
It's okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

1185
01:10:38,815 --> 01:10:41,853
- Were you followed?
- No, I don't think so.

1186
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:54,529
- Cute place. Real homey.
- Oh, great. It's Liv.

1187
01:10:54,531 --> 01:10:56,565
I guess
I was followed.

1188
01:10:56,567 --> 01:10:57,732
Oh, no.

1189
01:10:57,734 --> 01:10:59,433
Get out of here,
kid.

1190
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:03,804
You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.

1191
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:09,043
Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider gang.

1192
01:11:09,045 --> 01:11:11,312
Would you mind
taking this outside?

1193
01:11:11,314 --> 01:11:14,348
We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.

1194
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,987
Ooh, I think
I'll be taking that.

1195
01:11:20,556 --> 01:11:23,760
Stand, <i>niñito, dale.
Prepárate a morir.</i>

1196
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:25,960
Man, stupid pillows.

1197
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:47,082
I said,
take it outside!

1198
01:11:47,084 --> 01:11:48,486
I got it!

1199
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:03,033
I got this, buddy.
Leave the kid alone!

1200
01:12:06,636 --> 01:12:07,772
No, no, no! No!

1201
01:12:17,648 --> 01:12:19,284
You gotta go, man.

1202
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,892
<i>All vehicles in
the area, we have a disturbance</i>

1203
01:12:30,894 --> 01:12:33,462
<i>involving
multiple Spiderpeople?</i>

1204
01:12:33,464 --> 01:12:34,730
Yeah. On my way.

1205
01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:45,973
Give me that thing.

1206
01:12:45,975 --> 01:12:49,313
Don't be stupid, kid.
Hand it over, now!

1207
01:13:07,398 --> 01:13:09,667
Nowhere left
to run.

1208
01:13:14,638 --> 01:13:16,570
Miles?

1209
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:17,674
Uncle Aaron.

1210
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:22,479
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1211
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:29,786
Please, Uncle Aaron.

1212
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:34,088
<i>Prowler.</i>

1213
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:36,794
What are you waitin' for?
Finish it.

1214
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,857
Get out of here!

1215
01:14:26,676 --> 01:14:27,676
No.

1216
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:29,945
Miles.

1217
01:14:29,947 --> 01:14:32,681
Uncle Aaron.

1218
01:14:32,683 --> 01:14:34,583
This is my fault.

1219
01:14:39,223 --> 01:14:41,125
No, Miles.

1220
01:14:42,192 --> 01:14:43,192
I'm sorry.

1221
01:14:46,763 --> 01:14:48,966
I wanted you to look up to me.

1222
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:53,571
I let you down, man.
I let you down.

1223
01:14:57,107 --> 01:15:00,174
You're the best
of all of us, Miles.

1224
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:02,179
You're on your way.

1225
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:06,751

1226
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:11,085

1227
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:46,087
Hands up!

1228
01:15:46,089 --> 01:15:49,124
Put your arms up. Now!

1229
01:15:49,126 --> 01:15:51,496
Turn around.

1230
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:56,200
Hey! Hey!

1231
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:07,244
Aaron. Aaron, no. No!

1232
01:16:16,653 --> 01:16:18,820

1233
01:16:18,822 --> 01:16:21,755
I want an APB

1234
01:16:51,621 --> 01:16:52,889
Hey, bud.

1235
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:55,690
You okay?

1236
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:02,998
We've all been there.
You know, for me,

1237
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,268
it was my Uncle Ben.

1238
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:09,270
For me, it was
my Uncle Benjamin.

1239
01:17:09,272 --> 01:17:11,940
For me,
it was my father.

1240
01:17:11,942 --> 01:17:14,942
For me, it was
my best friend.

1241
01:17:14,944 --> 01:17:19,280
Miles, the hardest thing
about this job is

1242
01:17:19,282 --> 01:17:21,883
you can't always
save everybody.

1243
01:17:21,885 --> 01:17:26,120
Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.

1244
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:29,160
Miles, we're probably the
only ones who <i>do</i> understand.

1245
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:34,029

1256
01:18:08,465 --> 01:18:10,832
Miles, I came
to say goodbye.

1257
01:18:10,834 --> 01:18:12,400
We can say goodbye
at the collider.

1258
01:18:12,402 --> 01:18:14,735
You're not getting it.
You're staying here.

1259
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:16,838
I need to be there.
So you can all go home.

1260
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,040
They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.

1261
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:23,712
You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.

1262
01:18:23,714 --> 01:18:25,280
I'm doing
what needs to be done.

1263
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:27,084
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

1264
01:18:28,151 --> 01:18:29,252
What about MJ?

1265
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:32,890
Not everything works out,
kid.

1266
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:36,458
I need the goober.

1267
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,293
Please don't make me
take it from you.

1268
01:18:38,295 --> 01:18:39,460
That's not fair!

1269
01:18:39,462 --> 01:18:41,329
You gotta tell them
I can do this.

1270
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:42,933
It wasn't their decision.

1271
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:49,971
I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!

1272
01:18:49,973 --> 01:18:51,505
Miles, you're gonna get
yourself killed.

1273
01:18:51,507 --> 01:18:53,173
But I'm ready.
I promise!

1274
01:18:56,212 --> 01:18:58,279
Then venom-strike me
right now.

1275
01:18:58,281 --> 01:19:03,051
Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.

1276
01:19:13,496 --> 01:19:17,030
Look, I know how
much you want this, kid.

1277
01:19:17,032 --> 01:19:18,902
Poor
little guy.

1278
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:24,774
But you don't
have it yet.

1279
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,449
I'm sorry.

1280
01:19:32,948 --> 01:19:35,118
When will I know
I'm ready?

1281
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:39,419
You won't.
It's a leap of faith.

1282
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:41,522
That's all it is,
Miles.

1283
01:19:41,524 --> 01:19:44,027
A leap of faith.

1284
01:20:24,568 --> 01:20:27,067
Miles.

1285
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:28,906
Miles, it's your dad.

1286
01:20:29,906 --> 01:20:31,975
Please open the door.

1287
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:36,213
Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.

1288
01:20:38,081 --> 01:20:42,217
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.

1289
01:20:42,219 --> 01:20:44,488
Look, can we talk
for a minute?

1290
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:48,124
Something...

1291
01:20:50,026 --> 01:20:52,028
Something happened to...

1292
01:20:54,864 --> 01:20:58,269
Look, sometimes
people drift apart, Miles.

1293
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:03,905
And I don't want that
to happen to us, okay?

1294
01:21:03,907 --> 01:21:06,207
I know I don't always do
what you need me to do

1295
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:08,546
or say
what you need me to say.

1296

amazing. It's why I push you.

- I'm right here.

01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:35,642

the waiters are dressed.

It can't be

01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:42,685
It's that easy.

1349
01:25:47,223 --> 01:25:49,589
I just wanna
thank Mary Jane Parker

1350
01:25:49,591 --> 01:25:50,861
for being here this evening.

1351
01:25:52,162 --> 01:25:53,427

01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:59,366
Pay attention.
It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?

1353
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:01,334
I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.

1354
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:03,370
Peter! Come here. Trust me.

1355
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:05,772
I've been there.
You gotta move on, buddy.

1356
01:26:05,774 --> 01:26:08,176
It will take one second.
Let me just... Oh!

1357
01:26:08,178 --> 01:26:11,212
- Hello.
- Oh, wow.

1358
01:26:11,214 --> 01:26:13,313
Um...
I just wondered

1359
01:26:13,315 --> 01:26:15,419
if we could have some more
bread at table 12.

1360
01:26:16,419 --> 01:26:17,520
Yeah.

1361
01:26:19,889 --> 01:26:22,289
I'm just...
I'm really sorry.

1362
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:25,359
Oh! Don't be sorry.
It's just bread.

1363
01:26:25,361 --> 01:26:27,794
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

1364
01:26:27,796 --> 01:26:29,396
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't even try.

1365
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:31,932
That's fine. You know,
I should really get going.

1366
01:26:31,934 --> 01:26:34,267
I know I could do better

1367
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:35,869
if I just had
another chance

1368
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:41,409
to give you the bread
that you deserve.

1369
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:42,709
Are you okay?

1370
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:44,678
We'll take care of
that bread right now.

1371
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,780
Well, it's been nice
talking to you.

1372
01:26:46,782 --> 01:26:49,749
For you, they should fill this
place up with fresh bread.

1373
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:52,453
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

1374
01:26:52,455 --> 01:26:54,521
Good, 'cause we are not
getting any bread.

1375
01:26:56,459 --> 01:26:58,325
I'm just sorry
my family can't see

1376
01:26:58,327 --> 01:26:59,929
what we're doing here
tonight.

1377
01:27:08,237 --> 01:27:11,806
<i>Initializing
primary ignition sequence.</i>

1378
01:27:16,545 --> 01:27:17,914
Sleep.

1379
01:27:23,786 --> 01:27:25,552
Start the sequence.

1380
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:28,321
Uploading Vanessa Fisk
and Richard Fisk DNA sequence.

1381
01:27:28,323 --> 01:27:30,924
Beginning scan
for dimensional matches.

1382
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:41,701
<i>Secondary
ignition in five, four,</i>

1383
01:27:41,703 --> 01:27:46,274
<i>three, two, one.</i>

1384
01:28:02,759 --> 01:28:05,892
Peter, you don't have to stay
behind. I can do it.

1385
01:28:05,894 --> 01:28:07,594
It's okay.

1386
01:28:07,596 --> 01:28:09,763
I've made up my mind.

1387
01:28:13,803 --> 01:28:16,369
I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.

1388
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:19,440
After you're gone,
I'll blow it up.

1389
01:28:19,442 --> 01:28:20,544
Good luck, guys.

1390
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,948
They know
we're here.

1391
01:28:33,656 --> 01:28:36,526
Nice to see you again,
Peter.

1392
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:44,632
<i>I got you covered!</i>

1393
01:28:44,634 --> 01:28:46,569
These guys are the pits.

1394
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:55,743
Why is this
always difficult?

1395
01:28:55,745 --> 01:28:58,378
Where you going, Peter?

1396
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,946
Any last words?

1397
01:28:59,948 --> 01:29:02,982
Can I get a minute to think
about it? You have a pen?

1398
01:29:02,984 --> 01:29:05,488
Goodbye, Peter Parker.

1399
01:29:15,732 --> 01:29:17,365
Who did that?!

1400
01:29:23,605 --> 01:29:25,873
- Miles?
- Spider-Man?

1401
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:28,875
Wow, Miles. You're
doing it on command!

1402
01:29:28,877 --> 01:29:30,410
It's about time, right?

1403
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:32,780
- Look who's here!
- You figured it out.

1404
01:29:32,782 --> 01:29:34,515
I love you!
I am so proud of you!

1405
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:37,485
Do I want kids?

1406
01:29:37,487 --> 01:29:39,523
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about her.

1407
01:29:41,157 --> 01:29:42,957
Well, that doesn't look
promising.

1408
01:29:42,959 --> 01:29:44,728
No, it doesn't.

1409
01:29:50,632 --> 01:29:53,133
<i>I've got genetic matches.
Hold on.</i>

1410
01:29:53,135 --> 01:29:54,535
It's too risky.

1411
01:29:54,537 --> 01:29:55,936
Shut up and turn it up.

1412
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:57,804
- On your left!
- On your right!

1413
01:29:57,806 --> 01:30:00,173
I got five o'clock! Three o'clock!
Two o'clock!

1414
01:30:00,175 --> 01:30:02,645
Every direction!

1415
01:30:04,781 --> 01:30:06,847
Get to a shelter.
I'll be right there.

1416
01:30:08,451 --> 01:30:10,620
I tried the school,
but I can't get through.

1417
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:26,066
Guys, are you seeing this?

1418
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:29,803
Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.

1419
01:30:29,805 --> 01:30:32,173
Does look cool though,
right?

1420
01:30:32,175 --> 01:30:34,111
We gotta get back
up there.

1421
01:30:36,545 --> 01:30:37,844
Is that all you got?

1422
01:30:37,846 --> 01:30:39,847
You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?

1423
01:30:39,849 --> 01:30:41,649
You hard-boiled
turtle slapper!

1424
01:31:03,104 --> 01:31:06,707
What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?

1425
01:31:06,709 --> 01:31:08,875
You got a problem
with cartoons?

1426
01:31:14,649 --> 01:31:16,152
Blammo!

1427
01:31:21,224 --> 01:31:22,556
Aww...

1428
01:31:22,558 --> 01:31:25,092
Did that feel like
a cartoon?

1429
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:39,875
Gwen!

1430
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:49,950
I like your suit.

1431
01:31:49,952 --> 01:31:51,651
Thanks. I made it myself.

1432
01:31:51,653 --> 01:31:55,459
That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!

1433
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:11,605
Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.

1434
01:32:15,211 --> 01:32:16,977
All right.
Never mind.

1435
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:18,145
Let's end
this thing.

1436
01:32:18,147 --> 01:32:19,579
Guys,
I got it.

1437
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:21,183
I'll go. I'm the one
with the goo...

1438
01:32:22,684 --> 01:32:24,051
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

1439
01:32:24,053 --> 01:32:27,253
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

1440
01:32:31,894 --> 01:32:33,063
- Miles!
- Be careful!

1441
01:32:46,809 --> 01:32:48,075
That was crazy.

1442
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:50,009
We taught him that,
right?

1443
01:32:50,011 --> 01:32:52,782
I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.

1444
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,068
You okay?

1445
01:33:13,702 --> 01:33:15,104
Come on.

1446
01:33:21,844 --> 01:33:24,712
Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!

1447
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:29,783
<i>Alert! Quantum
polarity has been reversed.</i>

1448
01:33:34,889 --> 01:33:36,656
Guess
this is it.

1449
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:40,060
Well, nice to know
we're not alone.

1450
01:33:40,062 --> 01:33:43,830
- Right?
- Yeah.

1451
01:33:43,832 --> 01:33:46,266
I got the portal open.
You first, Peni.

1452
01:33:46,268 --> 01:33:48,369
Thank you,
Miles.

1453
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:50,607
From both
of us.

1454
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:56,944
I, uh, love you all.

1455
01:33:56,946 --> 01:33:59,879
I'm taking this cube thing
with me.

1456
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:01,949
I don't understand it.

1457
01:34:01,951 --> 01:34:03,586
But I will.

1458
01:34:07,657 --> 01:34:09,056
I want you
to have this.

1459
01:34:09,058 --> 01:34:10,894
It'll fit
in your pocket.

1460
01:34:12,294 --> 01:34:14,261
That's all, folks.

1461
01:34:14,263 --> 01:34:17,132
Is he allowed
to say that, legally?

1462
01:34:20,769 --> 01:34:22,869
Do I get to like
the hairdo now?

1463
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:26,073
You know I'm older than you.

1464
01:34:26,075 --> 01:34:29,410
15 months, but it's pretty
significant if you ask me.

1465
01:34:29,412 --> 01:34:33,213
Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?

1466
01:34:34,684 --> 01:34:35,986
Nice.

1467
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:39,989
Friends?

1468
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:42,923
Friends.

1469
01:34:42,925 --> 01:34:43,990
Cool.

1470
01:34:43,992 --> 01:34:46,026
See you around,
Spider-Man.

1471
01:34:56,971 --> 01:34:58,073
Your turn.

1472
01:34:59,175 --> 01:35:02,045
Yeah, yeah. Right.

1473
01:35:05,413 --> 01:35:07,847
You're not going anywhere!

1474
01:35:07,849 --> 01:35:10,316
I'll hold him off.
You shut this down.

1475
01:35:10,318 --> 01:35:12,018
Peter,
that wasn't the deal!

1476
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:15,291
Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!

1477
01:35:18,961 --> 01:35:21,494
- What are you doing?
- You gotta go home!

1478
01:35:21,496 --> 01:35:24,464
This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.

1479
01:35:24,466 --> 01:35:26,201
Neither can I.

1480
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:29,839
It's okay.

1481
01:35:30,739 --> 01:35:32,207
Yeah, it is okay.

1482
01:35:36,412 --> 01:35:38,915
You gotta go home, man.

1483
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:43,116
How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?

1484
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:44,319
You won't.

1485
01:35:45,821 --> 01:35:47,286
Right.

1486
01:35:47,288 --> 01:35:49,224
It's a leap of faith.

1487
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,336
Not bad, kid.

1488
01:36:09,511 --> 01:36:10,813
Kingpin!

1489
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:25,558
Nope!

1490
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,796
Sorry! That's cheating.

1491
01:36:29,931 --> 01:36:31,067
<i>Adiós.</i>

1492
01:36:39,407 --> 01:36:41,410
I gotta get to that button.

1493
01:36:46,282 --> 01:36:47,914
Oh, no.

1494
01:36:47,916 --> 01:36:50,252
Not so easy doing it
on your own, is it?

1495
01:36:53,889 --> 01:36:56,522
I can't wait to kill
one more Spider-Man.

1496
01:36:59,894 --> 01:37:01,962
- Where am I?
- What?

1497
01:37:01,964 --> 01:37:03,563
Wilson?

1498
01:37:03,565 --> 01:37:06,600
- Is this what you want, man?
- What are you doing?

1499
01:37:06,602 --> 01:37:09,035
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1500
01:37:09,037 --> 01:37:11,538
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know, Richard.

1501
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,841
It's me. You know me.

1502
01:37:13,975 --> 01:37:15,542
We're leaving now.

1503
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:17,878
Don't go.

1504
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,346
Stay with me.

1505
01:37:19,348 --> 01:37:21,084
Please!

1506
01:37:26,322 --> 01:37:29,222
You're not stopping this.
Not today.

1507
01:37:29,224 --> 01:37:31,861
I am stopping this.
Right now!

1508
01:37:40,035 --> 01:37:42,272
I need backup.

1509
01:38:19,407 --> 01:38:21,176
Come on.

1510
01:38:29,385 --> 01:38:32,121
The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.

1511
01:38:34,523 --> 01:38:36,226
You're nothing!

1512
01:38:42,264 --> 01:38:44,500
You took my family.

1513
01:38:48,336 --> 01:38:52,441
And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.

1514
01:39:11,961 --> 01:39:13,963
Get up, Spider-Man.

1515
01:39:16,297 --> 01:39:18,934
Get up! Come on!

1516
01:39:25,474 --> 01:39:29,011
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1517
01:39:40,154 --> 01:39:43,323
I'll always have my family.

1518
01:39:43,325 --> 01:39:45,060
You ever hear of
the shoulder touch?

1519
01:39:46,161 --> 01:39:47,263
What?

1520
01:39:51,433 --> 01:39:52,598
Hey.

1521
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:06,381
Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!

1522
01:41:55,357 --> 01:41:58,357
Miles? Miles? Are you okay?

1523
01:41:58,359 --> 01:41:59,461
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

1524
01:42:00,429 --> 01:42:01,695
You're probably busy...

1525
01:42:01,697 --> 01:42:03,730
<i>No! I can talk,
I can talk.</i>

1526
01:42:03,732 --> 01:42:07,603
<i>Look, so I
came by earlier because...</i>

1527
01:42:08,836 --> 01:42:11,273
- Your uncle...
- I know, Dad.

1528
01:42:12,573 --> 01:42:14,141
I am so sorry.

1529
01:42:14,143 --> 01:42:16,209
Yeah.

1530
01:42:16,211 --> 01:42:17,677
Do you know
who did it?

1531
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:19,512
I thought I did.

1532
01:42:19,514 --> 01:42:21,647
But I was wrong.

1533
01:42:21,649 --> 01:42:25,218
Look, Miles,
what I said at the door,

1534
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,589
it wasn't just talk.

1535
01:42:28,489 --> 01:42:30,656
Look, you know,
I was thinking

1536
01:42:30,658 --> 01:42:33,360
maybe we could find
a nice wall,

1537
01:42:33,362 --> 01:42:36,495
privately owned,
like at the police station,

1538
01:42:36,497 --> 01:42:42,701
and you could "throw up"
some of your art.

1539
01:42:42,703 --> 01:42:45,237
Man, I'm bad at this.

1540
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:48,374
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1541
01:42:48,376 --> 01:42:51,311
Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!

1542
01:42:51,313 --> 01:42:54,213
- Officer.
- Spider-Man!

1543
01:42:54,215 --> 01:42:56,516
Listen, down there,
that was...

1544
01:42:56,518 --> 01:42:58,250
I mean, I owe you...

1545
01:42:58,252 --> 01:43:00,456
Okay!

1546
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:10,329
I look
forward to workin' with you.

We can't all be
everywhere at once.

1817
01:55:34,375 --> 01:55:36,208
Little text
might've been nice.

1818
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:37,977
I was gone for less than two hours.
What happened?

1819
01:55:37,979 --> 01:55:40,045
Okay.
I know what it looks like.

1820
01:55:40,047 --> 01:55:42,515
- But here's the good news.
- Oh, here we go.

1821
01:55:42,517 --> 01:55:44,450
The multiverse <i>didn't</i> collapse.

1822
01:55:44,452 --> 01:55:46,218
- Oh, cool!
- Little touch and go.

1823
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:47,719
But it worked out.

1824
01:55:47,721 --> 01:55:49,155
Great story. Did
you finish the goober?

1825
01:55:49,157 --> 01:55:50,588
It's not a goober.
It's a gizmo.

1826
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,124
Do you always
have to call me out?

1827
01:55:52,126 --> 01:55:53,325
It's just really frustrating
and bums me out.

1828
01:55:53,327 --> 01:55:54,660
Don't get excited, Miguel.

1829
01:55:54,662 --> 01:55:56,161
- It's just a prototype.
- Not excited.

1830
01:55:56,163 --> 01:55:57,429
But you could
be the first person

1831
01:55:57,431 --> 01:55:59,397
to make an autonomous
multiverse jump.

1832
01:55:59,399 --> 01:56:00,700
Or the last.

1833
01:56:00,702 --> 01:56:02,535
So we're just gonna roll
the dice on this?

1834
01:56:02,537 --> 01:56:05,404
So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?

1835
01:56:05,406 --> 01:56:08,341
Let's start at the beginning
one last time.

1836
01:56:08,343 --> 01:56:10,575
Earth '67.

1837
01:56:13,081 --> 01:56:14,646
- Whoa!
- What the...?

1838
01:56:14,648 --> 01:56:16,281
I'm Spider-Man.

1839
01:56:16,283 --> 01:56:17,650
- I need you to come with me.
- Who the heck are you?

1840
01:56:17,652 --> 01:56:20,186
I just told you...
Listen. I'm from the future.

1841
01:56:20,188 --> 01:56:22,454
- How dare you point at me!
- You were pointing first.

1842
01:56:22,456 --> 01:56:24,990
- It's rude to point.
- <i>You're</i> being very rude.

1843
01:56:24,992 --> 01:56:27,026
Which one pointed first?

1844
01:56:27,028 --> 01:56:28,994
Spider-Man pointed first.
Obviously.

1845
01:56:28,996 --> 01:56:30,695
- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.

1846
01:56:30,697 --> 01:56:32,431
Look at your finger.

1847
01:56:32,433 --> 01:56:33,732
I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.

1848
01:56:33,734 --> 01:56:35,368
You haven't seen pointing.

1849
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,570
You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!
