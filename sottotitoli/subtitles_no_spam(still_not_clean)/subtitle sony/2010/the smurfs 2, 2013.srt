Perhaps she'd already made
provision for you.

There's been an arrangement
in place for some time.

A modest pension.

you plotted with Do to kill Micky.

just this, the last detail,
to be opened on Micky's birthday.

Happy birthday to Micky,
by the way.

You said it's worth 100,000.

You could sell it if you want.

Hello?

The old lady had the last word.

What do you mean?

She left everything to you.

- To me?
- To you.

She left everything to
Domenica Law.

All this for nothing.

No, she knew nothing.

I sent the tape to Chance.
