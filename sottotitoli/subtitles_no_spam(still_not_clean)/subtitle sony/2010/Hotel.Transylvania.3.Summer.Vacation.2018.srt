1
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,380
Budapest.

2
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,792
The next stop's Budapest.

3
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,801
Budapest is the next stop.

4
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,803
Budapest.

5
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,259
Tickets, ladies.

6
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,589
Here you go.

7
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,550
- Here's mine.
- And mine.

8
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,681
- Mine, too!
- Here you go!

9
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,224
Thank you, young man.

10
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,060
Man, I hate wearing disguises.

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,019
These heels are killing me.

12
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,855
Okay, take it down a notch.

13
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,398
We don't want to alarm the humans.

14
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,151
Drac.

15
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,616
I'm about to <i>und</i> freak out!

16
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,535
You're a nice kitty.

17
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,867
I'm <i>und</i> kitty-cat.

18
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,303
No, not this clown again.

19
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,885
Good evening, travelers.

20
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,309
I am Professor Abraham Van Helsing.

21
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,430
Yes. One of the Van Helsings.

22
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,982
For centuries, my family
has protected humanity

23
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,394
from the evils of monsters.

24
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:57,573
So you can believe me when I tell you,
there are monsters hiding amongst you!

25
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,485
But fear not,

26
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,414
for I am a professional,
and I know how to flush out

27
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,913
these beasts and bring them into the light!

28
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,960
Fire bad!

29
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,778
Sorry, guys.

30
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,922
Finally! First I kill Dracula,

31
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,883
and then the rest of the monsters!

32
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,804
Why do you keep doing this?

33
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,804
Your dad, your grandfather,
your great-great-granny...

34
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,476
I defeated them all.

35
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,146
When will you Van Helsings ever
learn to let go of the hate?

36
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,317
Never! Because you, monster, are a...

37
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,275
What? A mouse?

38
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,990
You can't run from me, Prince of Darkness!

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,950
I will hunt you for all eternity!

40
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,291
I swear I will never rest
until I destroy you...

41
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,620
And...

42
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,922
Every...

43
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,085
Other...

44
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,291
Monster...

45
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,876
If it's the last thing...

46
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,168
I...

47
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,294
Ever...

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,838
Do!

49
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,681
Boy, that guy is annoying.

50
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,892
Maybe one day there will be a place

51
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,520
where monsters can go
to get away from it all,

52
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,145
take a vacation.

53
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,774
Who knows, maybe even get married.

54
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,441
Wouldn't that be something?

55
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,609
It's okay.

56
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,827
When is this thing starting?

57
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,413
You made them cry, Wayne.

58
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,624
All except this little one.

59
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,035
That's Sunny. She doesn't cry.

60
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,420
She bites.

61
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,966
This is a very special moment, Carl.

62
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:07,381
Any second, your beautiful bride
is going to walk right down the aisle.

63
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,304
No, Drac, she's not coming.

64
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,760
Don't worry.

65
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,894
Mavis is with her.
I'm sure everything is under control.

66
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,688
Mavey, is everything under control?

67
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,983
Yep, just a slight case
of pre-wedding jitters.

68
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,575
Yep, everything is fine here.

69
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,835
Please try to relax, Lucy.

70
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,629
I've taken care of everything.

71
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,336
The wedding is going to be perfect.

72
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,009
It's not that.

73
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,929
Just, how do I know
I'm doing the right thing?

74
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,975
I know just how you feel.

75
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,433
The day I married Johnny was
the best day of my life,

76
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,972
but I was so nervous.

77
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,856
Not as nervous as I was.

78
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,609
And you should have seen my dad.
He was a mess.

79
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,396
I wouldn't get out of my coffin that night.

80
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,406
But he knew it was meant to be.

81
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:11,365
It doesn't matter where you come from
or how different you are.

82
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,448
A Zing only happens once in your life,
and you have to cherish it.

83
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,582
You're right! Thank you!

84
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,003
Okay. All right. Okay.

85
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,083
Okay.

86
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,638
I do.

87
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,224
I do.

88
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,056
Do you hear that?

89
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,767
Yes. I thought we locked him in his room.

90
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,851
We did!

91
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,525
Hi, Mom. Hi, Papa.

92
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,606
- Dennis!
- Dennis!

93
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,817
Tinkles was crying, so we let him out.

94
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,036
Tinkles, sit!

95
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,095
Whose idea was it to let Dennis have a puppy?

96
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,423
Yours?

97
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,472
Right.

98
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,895
Poor Tinkles.

99
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,226
Dennis...

100
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,608
Look, honey, I know you love Tinkles,

101
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,856
but we're not allowed to bring our dogs...

102
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,692
I mean, our pets everywhere.

103
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,864
Okay?

104
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,278
Okay.

105
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,580
<i>DJ Jazzy Johnny in the house.</i>

106
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:43,037
<i>It's time to welcome the happy couple,
Mr. and Mrs. Prickles!</i>

107
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,552
<i>The bride and groom invite everyone
to join them on the dance floor.</i>

108
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,050
Care to dance?

109
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,731
- Is that her?
- Watch out now.

110
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,393
She got stitches in all the right places.

111
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,654
Okay, there's no way that
is related to you, Frank.

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,356
No, she's my right arm's cousin.

113
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,162
I see it now.

114
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,240
Frank wanted me to meet you.

115
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,826
We're arm cousins, twice removed.

116
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,583
Of course.

117
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,291
I'd recognize that bicep anywhere.

118
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:34,466
He thought, since we're both single,
we might hit it off, maybe go on a date?

119
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,672
"Date"?

120
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,512
Well, it's just that...

121
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,223
The DJ booth is a sacred space!

122
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,892
I love this song!

123
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,441
Don't you?

124
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,730
Dracula?

125
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,527
Where'd he go?

126
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,616
Dracula?

127
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,868
What's the matter, Drac, you didn't like her?

128
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,166
No offense, but you can't be too picky.

129
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,209
You haven't had a date in 100 years.

130
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,540
Look, guys, I appreciate your concern,
but it's not up to me.

131
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,422
You only Zing once, and I did.

132
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,378
Times have changed, buddy.

133
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,465
You can even find someone
to Zing with on your phone now.

134
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,220
What? Really?

135
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,767
No, no, no.

136
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,094
I'm far too busy.

137
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,228
I have Mavis and Dennis and the hotel,
and bleh, bleh-bleh.

138
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,938
Did you guys hear that?

139
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,940
He actually said, "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

140
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,113
I don't say, "Bleh, bleh-bleh"!

141
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,245
I'm looking for a Zing.

142
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,664
<i>Okay. Changing phone ring.</i>

143
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,038
No. no. I'm looking for a date.

144
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,713
No, no, no.

145
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,670
I want to meet someone.

146
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,762
Are you kidding me right now?

147
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,061
Don't you get it? I want to go on a date!

148
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,480
I'm lonely.

149
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,643
<i>You want baloney.</i>

150
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,196
What? Look at that hair. Come on.

151
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,657
Too many eyes.

152
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,908
Too few eyes.

153
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,489
Not into tentacles.

154
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,991
"Match found"?

155
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,868
No, no, no!

156
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,169
<i>First things first.</i>

157
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,545
<i>I'm not into games.</i>

158
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,249
<i>You'd better have a job,
and my cats have to like you.</i>

159
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:38,919
No.

160
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,003
No.

161
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,713
Dad?

162
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,507
Mavis!

163
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,176
What are you doing here?

164
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,978
I was just checking on the honeymoon
suite, and I heard something.

165
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,222
I'm sorry, my little bedbug.

166
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,433
I was just cleaning the attic.

167
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,066
It's so dirty, yes...

168
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,072
- <i>Who is that?</i>
- Are you on the phone?

169
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:07,157
What, this? I was just trying to find a maid

170
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,617
- to help me with the mess.
- <i>A maid?</i>

171
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,919
- <i>Who do you think...</i>
- Thank you, I'll check your references

172
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,371
and get back to you. Goodbye!

173
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,005
Dad.

174
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,757
Stop trying to hide it from me.

175
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,180
Hide? Who? I mean, what? Me?

176
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,347
Yes.

177
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,141
And I know what it is.

178
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,177
Really?

179
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,854
You're stressed out from working too hard.

180
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,524
Okay, yes.

181
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,942
You got me.

182
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,111
It's a big hotel, you know?

183
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,688
Can't get to everything.

184
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,946
But what about you?

185
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,899
You're pretty busy yourself.

186
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,327
I know. It seems like now that
we're working together more,

187
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,870
we're seeing each other less.

188
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,165
Yeah. You're absolutely right.

189
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,085
I am working too much,
you're working too much.

190
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,255
We should really take a break,
starting right now.

191
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,502
Night-night.

192
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,674
<i>I'm still here!</i>

193
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,150
Hey, honey.

194
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,610
You ready for

195
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,067
date night?

196
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,657
That's okay, sweetheart.

197
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,988
You rest.

198
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,209
You know, Dad's right.

199
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,706
We need a break.

200
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,631
We need to all be together again,
like a family.

201
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,340
Like we used to.

202
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,971
<i>Are you overworked and stressed out?</i>

203
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,219
<i>Do you need some family time?</i>

204
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,346
<i>Are you a monster?</i>

205
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,723
<i>Then you need a vacation,</i>

206
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,897
<i>a monster vacation.</i>

207
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,976
<i>Sail away, sail away, sail away</i>

208
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,446
Welcome aboard Gremlin Air.

209
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,336
Ladies and gentlemen,

210
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,793
please direct your attention
to the front of the cabin.

211
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,003
For your safety,
please unbuckle your seat belts.

212
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,226
In the likely event we experience
a sudden drop in cabin pressure,

213
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,895
oxygen will be provided.

214
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,187
Can I stow that for you, sir?

215
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,518
All right. Thanks.

216
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,859
Beverages. Snacks. Beverages.

217
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,736
Beverages. Snacks.

218
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,816
Beverages.

219
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,749
- Coffee?
- That would be lovely.

220
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,750
Mavis, please, you're torturing me.

221
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,927
You know I hate surprises.

222
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,346
This is a fun surprise.

223
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,424
There are no fun surprises.

224
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,224
Just tell me where we're going.

225
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,802
Why are we on a plane?

226
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,683
We can fly, you know.

227
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,186
Back in my day, people took trains.

228
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,686
Now, that's classy.

229
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,770
Sure, Dad. Forty hours in a closet-sized room

230
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,651
with you and Uncle Bernie
and his smelly cigars,

231
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,607
arguing who was more attractive,

232
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,192
Cleopatra or Nefertiti.

233
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,235
Nefertiti.

234
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,946
Okay, Dad, thank you.

235
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,245
Mavis, this is such an amazing surprise!

236
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:41,079
I can't wait to spend time
with the people I love most.

237
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:45,086
But I beg of you, tell me where we're going!

238
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,965
Nope. I've taken care of everything,
so you don't need to worry.

239
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,546
You've been so stressed out lately.

240
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,053
It's time for you to relax.

241
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,892
Now, isn't that better?

242
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,271
Yes.

243
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,773
So relaxed.

244
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,987
I'm gonna go check on you-know-who.

245
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,613
I'll be right back.

246
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,945
I have to go to the bathroom.

247
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,246
Did you see that?

248
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,914
Dennis went to the bathroom!

249
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,787
Okay.

250
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,455
Hey, where are you?

251
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,254
There you are, Tinkles.

252
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,261
Don't worry, we'd never leave you home alone.

253
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,136
<i>Okay, folks, you're free to move</i> about
the cabin, as we have started our descent.

254
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,408
So, any big plans
for the weekend there, Bill?

255
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,864
You know, the usual.

256
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,620
Got to take the kids to soccer.

257
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,205
Snacks. Beverages.

258
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,336
Snacks. Beverages. Snacks.

259
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,981
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've arrived at our destination,

260
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,557
the Bermuda Triangle.

261
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,159
Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle,

262
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,035
where you'll embark on a monster cruise
of a lifetime.

263
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,873
A cruise?

264
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,171
Surprise!

265
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,256
No, you... No.

266
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:35,757
But it's just like a hotel on the water.

267
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:40,181
I just figured you need a vacation
from running everyone else's vacation.

268
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,060
You've barely been out of the hotel since...

269
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,141
Well, since Mom died.

270
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,398
But this is a chance to make new memories,

271
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,770
with all of us.

272
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,146
With Dennis.

273
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:57,450
- Boat!
- Boat!

274
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,789
Who made you such an amazing daughter?

275
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,074
You.

276
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,449
That's right!

277
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,126
What a father I am.

278
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,996
Come on, Denisovich, let's get cruising!

279
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,633
Okay. Smile.

280
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,381
Thank you.

281
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,895
"No pets allowed"?

282
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,658
Perfect.

283
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,503
Welcome aboard. How are you doing?

284
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,004
- Dennis, come on.
- Nice to see you.

285
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,427
Lovely shirt. Yes.

286
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,800
Hello. Welcome aboard.

287
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,473
This is Bob.

288
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,399
Say hi, Bob.

289
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,730
"Hi, Bob."

290
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,826
Oh, my gosh, Griffin.

291
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,529
I'm, like, so excited.

292
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,956
This is, like, the nicest hotel
I've ever been to.

293
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,203
Yeah!

294
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,206
Man, this is amazing!

295
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,706
There's so much to do!

296
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,789
Olympic-size swimming pool...

297
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,590
<i>All-you-can-eat buffet...</i>

298
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,630
<i>Full-service spa...</i>

299
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,467
I'm gonna get me a seaweed rewrap!

300
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,144
It sounds like everything we can do

301
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,937
at our hotel!

302
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,481
Except on the water!

303
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,657
You nailed it, honey.

304
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,085
Your dad is going to love this!

305
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,003
Best summer vacation ever!

306
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,876
Wait till you see the itinerary.

307
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,792
That's nice.

308
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,503
Frank, "fire bad." Remember?

309
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,260
Yeah, right, but maybe you'll find

310
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,716
your own fireworks on the cruise, huh?

311
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,802
It's not the Love Boat, Frank.

312
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,889
I'm just here to have fun with my family.

313
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:23,943
Ahoy there!

314
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,399
Welcome aboard!

315
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,704
Who is that?

316
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,382
I am Captain Ericka.

317
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,336
And, yes, I'm human.
But don't hold that against me.

318
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,422
I could not be more excited
to have all of you on board

319
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,099
our first-ever monster cruise!

320
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,855
Dad? Are you okay?

321
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,322
No! He's having a heart attack!

322
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,899
Drac? Not likely.

323
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,576
Yeah, the only heart attack that can
hurt him is with a wooden stake.

324
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,699
It must be a stroke!

325
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,746
Actually, I think it might be her.

326
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,616
Watch where you're pointing, mister,
I'm right here.

327
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,501
You always stand so close to me.

328
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,577
It's creepy.

329
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,627
For so long, monsters were hiding,
living in the shadows,

330
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,174
but not anymore!

331
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,588
You've stood up and waved your hand
or claw or tentacle

332
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:34,552
and said, "We're here, we're hairy,
and it is our right to be scary!"

333
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,023
Now it's time to celebrate!

334
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,230
You'll enjoy gourmet dining,
thrilling adventures,

335
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,936
and nonstop entertainment,

336
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,068
all on the way to our final destination,

337
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,196
the lost city that isn't lost anymore,

338
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,700
Atlantis!

339
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,535
Yeah!

340
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,338
The fish are acrobats!

341
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,665
They're fishcrobats!

342
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,086
Hello. How y'all doing?

343
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,843
So...

344
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,392
You must be the one and only Dracula.

345
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,185
I have waited so long to meet you.

346
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,767
You really don't age, do you?

347
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,318
I would kill for your skin.

348
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,482
You're speaking Transylvanian.

349
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,363
Always wanted to learn.

350
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,792
Such a romantic language.

351
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,840
You know, there's just something
about an accent

352
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,136
that makes a man sound so intelligent.

353
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,472
That's Transylvanian right there.

354
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,595
He's saying it's nice to meet you.

355
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,308
Well, then "alibooboo" to you as well.

356
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,849
Drac! Drac, snap out of it.

357
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,775
Wait. I've always wanted to do this.

358
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,853
Wake up! Wake up, Drac!

359
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,188
Snap out of it!

360
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,567
Hey, cut it out!

361
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,944
Hey, buddy, you okay?

362
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,526
No, not okay.

363
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,906
Not okay!

364
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,912
I... I...

365
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,238
I...

366
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,290
Zinged.

367
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,772
<i>I went to the moped store, I said, "Sell it"</i>

368
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,902
<i>Salesman's like,
"What up? What's your budget?"</i>

369
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,985
<i>And I'm like, "Honestly, I don't know
nothin' about mopeds"</i>

370
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,286
<i>He said, "I got the one for you, follow me"</i>

371
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,364
<i>It's too real</i>

372
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,744
<i>A chromed-out mirror,
I don't need a windshield</i>

373
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,674
Check that out!

374
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,428
Here we go.

375
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,680
Yummy.

376
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,421
Papa.

377
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,520
"Kids Club."

378
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,772
What's a kids club?

379
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,960
- Fish.
- That's right, dear.

380
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,832
I'm still not sure I understand.

381
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,507
You take my kids, all day, on purpose?

382
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,709
Fish.

383
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,967
That's right.

384
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,262
What exactly don't you understand?

385
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,512
Why?

386
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,722
So they can have a great time,
and you can have a great time.

387
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,182
Fish.

388
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,686
Don't worry, you get them back
at the end of the day.

389
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:52,900
Fish.

390
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,773
Oh, well. That's better than nothing.

391
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,155
So...

392
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,707
What do we do now?

393
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:12,254
I think we do whatever we want.

394
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,255
"Whatever we want"?

395
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,208
Whatever we want.

396
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,052
- Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want!

397
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,053
Whatever we want.

398
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,806
- Stop! Help me!
- Whatever we want.

399
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,932
- Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want.

400
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,514
Hi. Hello.

401
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,815
How y'all doin'?

402
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,062
Good evening, Captain.

403
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,065
Well, hello. Oh, my goodness.

404
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,112
Would you mind lifting your tail? You know...

405
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,529
- Certainly.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

406
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,998
Hello.

407
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,457
Welcome aboard.

408
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,189
You were so right, Great-Grandfather.

409
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,946
Monsters are disgusting!

410
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,073
They're animals!

411
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,595
I'll be right there.

412
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,227
Dracula, is he on board?

413
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,980
Yes. I saw him. Face-to-face.

414
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,152
I was so nice to him.

415
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,526
That pale face of his and his goofy smile,

416
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,152
showing off his fangs.

417
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,984
It's just like you taught me!

418
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,491
It's even worse than I feared!

419
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,744
It was that fateful night that I realized

420
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,247
a human could never defeat a monster.

421
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,834
<i>But I wouldn't let our family legacy die.</i>

422
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:28,181
<i>And so, I began to search for an answer.</i>

423
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:33,513
<i>And I saw it in an ancient text,
an instrument of destruction</i>

424
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,813
<i>so powerful it destroyed Atlantis,</i>

425
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,937
<i>a whole city of monsters.</i>

426
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:44,022
<i>And there, deep within the rubble,
it lay, waiting.</i>

427
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,780
Endlessly, I searched for the lost city.

428
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,408
Time passed, and my body began to fail me.

429
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,032
It was so sad, Ericka.

430
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,664
First my liver, then my spleen,

431
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,040
followed by a kidney or two.

432
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,376
Then my golden locks.

433
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,509
But I wouldn't let that stop me.

434
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:10,465
I replaced my failing organs with technology!

435
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,972
And look at me now.

436
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,648
Girl, it's an improvement, really.

437
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,560
Sure.

438
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:27,320
And now, after 120 years,
I have finally found Atlantis.

439
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,491
Forget about all this!

440
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,989
Let me get rid of Dracula right now.

441
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,786
I was so close to him, I could've just...

442
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,912
No, no, no!

443
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,293
We have to stick to the plan.

444
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:43,589
Lure the monsters to Atlantis,
retrieve the instrument of destruction,

445
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,418
trap them there, and then wipe them out.

446
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,047
It's simple, Ericka!

447
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,298
Now, promise me
you won't try and kill Dracula.

448
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:52,806
Fine!

449
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,010
- I promise.
- Promise what?

450
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,767
I promise I won't try and kill Dracula. Okay?

451
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,281
Don't worry, Great-Grandfather,
I won't try and kill him...

452
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,075
I will kill him.

453
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,720
Work it, Dracula.

454
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,631
You know it.

455
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,350
Lookin' good, Drac!

456
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,803
Feeling good, Frank.

457
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,264
Look at you, so fancy!

458
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,973
What? This? Please.

459
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,192
Dressed to impress, huh?

460
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,519
"lmpress"?

461
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,320
Who do I need to impress?

462
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,273
lsn't that Captain Ericka?

463
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,608
Oh, no!

464
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,575
What?

465
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,615
No, not her.

466
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:20,863
That's good!

467
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,994
Very amusing.

468
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:35,257
Sorry, Drac. You know, it's just
we've never seen you like this.

469
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,428
I know.

470
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,676
It doesn't make any sense.

471
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,600
You can't Zing twice, it's impossible!

472
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,972
But I did! So now what?

473
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,354
And what about Mavis?

474
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,724
She wants you to be happy, right?

475
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,434
I'm sure she'll go with the flow.

476
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,186
No, no, no!

477
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,772
Mavis needs me. She depends on me.

478
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,859
I need to be home with my family.

479
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,993
Murray here may be from Egypt,
but you're the one in

480
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,414
"da Nile."

481
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,242
You guys get that?

482
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,956
You hit me right in the...

483
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,036
Mavis!

484
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,050
Don't say a word, or I'll haunt your dreams.

485
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,545
Having fun?

486
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,473
I'm having even more fun
now that you're here.

487
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,765
You know, Dad, I feel really lucky
to have this time with you.

488
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,597
All of us together, it's really special.

489
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,974
Me, too, spider monkey.

490
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,978
Now, are you ready for me
to destroy you in monster ball?

491
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,564
Monster ball!

492
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:37,774
Come on, Papa Drac!

493
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,525
Bring it on!

494
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,111
For I am king of family fun!

495
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,493
All right! Who is ready to get pummeled?

496
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,124
I got to warn you,

497
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:55,049
I played second-team coed intramural
volleyball at Santa Cruz.

498
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,881
Sure, pal. Whatever you say.

499
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,679
Everybody, just please watch the hair.

500
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,381
Watch the hair!

501
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,975
Let's go! Let's do this!

502
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,303
Oh, my gosh, this is gonna be so much fun.

503
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,478
Get ready.

504
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,348
Here comes the pain!

505
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,695
- Spike!
- Not the hair!

506
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,492
No, no, no!

507
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,492
All right!

508
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,118
<i>Captain Ericka, you are needed on deck.</i>

509
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,624
Next stop... Buh-bye, Dracula.

510
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,123
All right, baby!

511
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,737
Oh, baby, I got this.

512
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,109
Hey there, monsters.

513
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,953
Yeah! What'd I say!

514
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,037
<i>We're arriving at our first destination.</i>

515
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,049
<i>The underwater volcano!</i>

516
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,884
<i>Everyone, grab your scuba gear
and get ready to explore</i>

517
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,215
<i>the wonders of the sea.</i>

518
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,554
Especially you,

519
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,435
Count Dracula.

520
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,316
You see that, pal? She likes you.

521
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,769
No, no, no.

522
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,854
That sounds like a Zing in full effect.

523
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,735
No, no, no.

524
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,361
Yes, yes, yes.

525
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,159
I'm just here to have family fun.

526
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,363
Family, family, fun, fun.

527
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,432
Let's see. What about here?

528
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,118
Right this way, everyone.

529
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:51,092
Welcome to one of the true wonders
of the underwater kingdom.

530
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,849
I give you Volcano del Fuego.

531
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,893
Or, as the local sea life call it...

532
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,799
What a cute family.

533
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,883
What? No, it's not.

534
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,593
Dracula bad!

535
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,923
Frank, we just ate.

536
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,096
I can't believe you're hungry already.

537
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,548
I'm sorry. You know what it is?

538
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,804
It's all... Just all that
seafood just swimming around,

539
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,760
and when I "see food..."

540
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,642
Oh, man! I'm gone.

541
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,812
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula!

542
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,268
Dracula, Dracula!

543
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:33,026
I get so close,
but it's almost like he's teasing me.

544
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,324
I just, I can't stand it anymore.

545
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,491
I have to get him!

546
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,714
Boy, that underwater volcano looked hot.

547
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,217
Hi, Bob.

548
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,176
Right. We promised you
we'd play ping-pong now.

549
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,595
Dennis? Who is this?

550
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,850
It's our friend, Bob.

551
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,728
- Say hi, Bob.
- "Hi, Bob."

552
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,270
Okay! Time to go play ping-pong.

553
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,438
- Drac!
- Drac!

554
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,990
- Drac!
- Drac!

555
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,611
Hey, boys, where's the fire?

556
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,325
Well, Griffin here, he...

557
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,077
- He has something to tell you.
- Me?

558
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,079
Yeah, I got this bite on my hand,
and since, you know,

559
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,457
you're a biting expert,
I thought you could take a look.

560
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,833
- Yeah. Come on over here.
- The light is better.

561
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,711
Okay...

562
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,881
Okay, what is going on?

563
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,806
You guys are acting weirder than normal,
and your normal is pretty weird.

564
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,804
You are not gonna believe
what we heard, but...

565
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,813
<i>Ericka loves the Drac</i>

566
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,107
<i>She can't get enough of that Drac</i>

567
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,059
<i>Yeah</i>

568
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,439
<i>Drac is back</i>

569
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,065
<i>He's got the Zing</i>

570
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,772
<i>The Zinga-Zing</i>

571
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,403
I told you I don't want to upset Mavis.

572
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,952
But what are you talking about?

573
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,450
Okay, well, see, Frank got
hungry, so no surprise there...

574
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,284
But we swam back to the ship,
and we found Ericka raving about you.

575
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,959
She can't live without you, buddy.

576
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,287
It's serious!

577
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,420
<i>You can't deny the Zing, baby</i>

578
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,299
So, Drac, this is great. Are you gonna
make a move on the Captain, or what?

579
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,378
Yes.

580
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,052
Maybe? No.

581
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,393
It's been a while.
I don't even know where to start.

582
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,142
It's easy, Drac. Just make some small talk.

583
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,939
- Remember to smile.
- Look into her eyes.

584
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,937
- Keep it casual.
- Say something funny.

585
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,234
Ask her where her parts are from.

586
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,902
And say that her wrappings look nice.

587
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,650
- "Do you like coffins?"
- Compliment her.

588
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,527
- "Your neck looks delicious."
- Here she comes.

589
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,824
Okay, Drac, hit it.

590
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,407
Your delicious neck wrappings
are in a nice coffin.

591
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,204
Would you like to see my parts?

592
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,169
Yes, I'd love to go out with you.

593
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,371
What?

594
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,538
What?

595
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,873
Cantina. Midnight.

596
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,048
Don't be late.

597
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,470
That was a close one.

598
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,685
- Wait! Stop it, Tinkles, stop!
- Wait, Tinkles. Come back.

599
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,032
- Tinkles, stop!
- Wait!

600
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,159
No, no, no!

601
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,544
Tinkles, stop!

602
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,721
I've been found!

603
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,800
You'll never get me, monster!

604
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,223
Tinkles, stop.

605
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,965
<i>Everybody, we are pulling up
to our next stop, the Deserted Island.</i>

606
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,717
<i>It's time to get "lost" on the beach,</i>

607
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:28,049
<i>and we hope you'll "find" yourself
some fun and relaxation.</i>

608
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,594
Beach time!

609
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,269
Johnny, you go set everything up.

610
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,313
And, Dad,
you go get in line for the snow cones.

611
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,016
You know, actually,
I was thinking you and Johnny

612
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,817
should spend some time together.

613
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,317
What do you call it again? Date night?

614
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,609
Date night?

615
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,740
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I thought

616
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,943
me and the guys would take this opportunity

617
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,620
to spend some quality time with Dennis.

618
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,910
Okay. That's a great idea.

619
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,662
Come on, Johnny. Date night.

620
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,168
Date night!

621
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,931
Okay, here you go!

622
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,059
- Good girl!
- I got this one.

623
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,077
What was that?

624
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,246
It sounds like our children.

625
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,332
- It is our children! Run!
- Run!

626
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,411
Please! Help! Someone!

627
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,745
Get the parents!

628
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,298
Frank? Would you rub
some moonscreen on my back

629
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,625
before I get burned?

630
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,587
Wait one second, honey. You know,
the kids buried me in the sand.

631
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,431
Thanks, honey.

632
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,104
- Shall we have another?
- Sure.

633
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,524
- Sounds good.
- Straight up.

634
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,567
lsn't this place amazing?

635
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,692
The menu is in a bottle!

636
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,444
Genius! lsn't that awesome, honey?

637
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,448
What? Sorry.

638
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,321
I was just thinking about my dad.

639
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,370
Don't you think he's acting weird lately?

640
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,786
Not really. Besides having
a huge crush on the Captain.

641
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,746
- What?
- Yeah.

642
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,457
The Love Boat is
definitely making another run.

643
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,883
No way. He's...

644
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,469
He's my dad.

645
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,384
I know, right? It's weird.

646
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,091
When my parents kiss, I still close my eyes.

647
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,559
I guess I never thought about him
with anyone besides my mom.

648
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,475
You're cool with it, though, right?

649
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,022
Of course. I want him to be happy.

650
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,311
Totally.

651
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,272
Totally.

652
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:04,705
Have you a beverage
to quench me of my parchment?

653
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,332
Yes, of course, Mr. Chupacabra.

654
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,314
You look ravishing.

655
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,698
Thank you. I just...

656
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,285
So...

657
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,124
Does Captain Ericka have a last name?

658
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,509
Guacamole!

659
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,303
"Ericka Guacamole"?

660
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:56,723
That's so international.

661
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,927
No. Guacamole for us to share.

662
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,934
How beautiful is that full moon tonight?

663
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,309
Look. Right behind you.

664
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,064
The food here is to die for.

665
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,294
Holy moly, that was a lot of guacamole.

666
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,998
Are you feeling all right?

667
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,674
- Totally fine. Why?
- No reason.

668
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:38,803
There must have been garlic in the guacamole.

669
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:39,883
No.

670
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,722
lsn't that deadly for you?

671
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,849
No, no, no. It's just that I'm...

672
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,355
Garlic intolerant.

673
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:55,949
Was that you?

674
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,492
Yeah!

675
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,911
Dolphin surfing!

676
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,459
Hi, Mama. Hi, Papa.

677
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,543
Hey-hey.

678
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,711
Hey there.

679
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,301
- Papa.
- Hidey-ho!

680
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,427
Hi.

681
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,892
Is my dad in there, too?

682
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,312
Don't worry, I'm over here.

683
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,568
No, Papa Drac's not here. He's on his date.

684
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,479
Date?

685
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,450
Please, forgive me,

686
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,489
I'm just very nervous.

687
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,660
You see,

688
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:47,831
I haven't had a date since my wife died.

689
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,462
How old was your daughter?

690
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,666
She was just an infant.

691
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:58,129
It was hard being a single dad,
but I did my best.

692
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,183
I never knew my mother, either.

693
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,052
Or my father.

694
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,057
I'm so sorry.

695
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,354
Who raised you?

696
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,143
My great-grandfather.

697
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,813
I basically grew up on this ship.

698
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,486
That's why you're a captain.

699
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,111
Yeah. It's all I've ever known.

700
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,367
It was just expected.

701
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,782
You know, a family thing.

702
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:27,456
I understand, family is everything.

703
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,876
You have to honor the past.

704
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,746
But we make our own future.

705
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,932
- Dad?
- Mavis!

706
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,472
Johnny!

707
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:57,988
Captain Ericka and I were just
discussing the hospitality industry.

708
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,939
You know, just work stuff.

709
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,525
You're working now?

710
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,406
This is supposed to be a vacation.

711
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,781
A family vacation.

712
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,449
I should really go do captain-y things.

713
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,376
Dad, you said you were
gonna spend time with Dennis.

714
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,751
Dennis. Dennis? Dennis.

715
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,332
Yeah, you're right. Where is that kid?

716
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:20,134
Denisovich? You're supposed to be with me.

717
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,212
Come on now, kid, it's family time.

718
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,922
Quit hiding. Dennis?

719
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,553
What was that about?

720
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:27,760
You mean your dad's date?

721
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,687
It wasn't a date. It was work stuff.

722
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,473
I'm telling you, Johnny,

723
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,729
there is something
about that woman I don't trust.

724
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,857
But you want your dad to be happy, right?

725
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:39,937
Yes.

726
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,065
Just not with her.

727
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,234
Heads up, honey.

728
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,662
This guac is loaded with garlic.

729
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:48,829
Garlic?

730
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,873
That was a cute toot, honey.

731
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,817
- We've been up all night!
- Let's stay up all day, too!

732
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,485
Let's get wild!

733
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,284
- Ericka!
- What?

734
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,879
Just where have you been, young lady?

735
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,252
Doing work.

736
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,174
Wearing that?

737
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,836
You were with him! I know it!

738
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,137
Who?

739
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,932
"Who?" You know who!

740
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,509
You've been sneaking around my back

741
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,937
trying to kill Dracula again, haven't you?

742
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,686
So what if I have? I am a grown woman!

743
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,062
I have the right to kill whoever I want.

744
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,395
It's not just about you.

745
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,356
You could have ruined the legacy.

746
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,859
What if he discovered who you were?

747
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,867
I know. I wasn't thinking.
There's just something about him

748
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,788
that just drives me crazy!

749
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,743
- I just, I see him, and I want to...
- Punch him?

750
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,495
I guess.

751
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,831
Just, I can't wait to get this over with.

752
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,132
Don't worry, it won't be long now.

753
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,302
Once you recover
the instrument of destruction,

754
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,425
no one can stop us.

755
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,256
Not even Dracula!

756
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,802
- Excuse me.
- Spies!

757
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,817
Now, quickly, before someone comes!

758
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,007
<i>Everyone assemble on the forward deck.</i>

759
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:08,257
<i>We are arriving at our final destination.</i>

760
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,088
From the depths of creation,

761
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:13,095
the mighty city has risen once again.

762
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,845
<i>Home to the greatest monster civilization</i>

763
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,271
<i>the world has ever known,</i>

764
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:23,273
far surpassing Athens and Rome
in art, culture and sophistication.

765
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:28,528
I give you
the legendary lost city of Atlantis.

766
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,675
It's a giant Kraken!

767
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,638
<i>There's a place you've gotta be</i>

768
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:03,065
<i>A thousand leagues beneath the sea</i>

769
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,942
<i>And it's waiting over here for you and me</i>

770
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:12,401
<i>Gonna take you for a ride</i>

771
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,737
<i>But first you've gotta come inside</i>

772
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:20,075
<i>Get ready, for the party's on tonight</i>

773
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:25,043
<i>So relax and just unwind</i>

774
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:28,421
<i>Leave your worries all behind</i>

775
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,720
<i>And get ready, for the party's on tonight</i>

776
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,851
<i>Welcome to Atlantis!</i>

777
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,482
<i>So get ready</i>

778
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,734
<i>Ready</i>

779
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,786
<i>It's party time</i>

780
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,747
<i>It's party time!</i>

781
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,047
I am so excited!

782
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,373
Come to Daddy!

783
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,131
Twenty-eight black!

784
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,351
No, you don't.

785
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,350
Last time you gambled,
you lost an arm and a leg. Literally!

786
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,272
- Replacement limbs...
- I'll raise you 40.

787
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,567
...aren't just lying around
like they were in the old days.

788
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,068
So, no gambling.

789
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,239
- Frank!
- Yes, dear! Got it! No gambling!

790
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,247
- Tinkles, stop.
- Wait.

791
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,537
- Stop it, Tinkles, stop.
- Wait!

792
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,213
Have you guys seen Mavis? I have to find her.

793
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,380
Why? What's going on?

794
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,504
I'm going to tell her about Ericka.

795
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,211
I can't lie to my own daughter anymore.

796
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,093
She's the most important person
in the world to me.

797
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,175
I have to tell her the truth.

798
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,224
Right after I talk to Ericka.

799
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,556
Hey.

800
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,772
All right, I'm all...

801
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,275
Frank, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

802
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,982
I got this. I'm all in.

803
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,036
Johnny, have you seen my dad?

804
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,706
- Maybe he's with Bob.
- Why would he be with Bob?

805
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,078
Bob's a great guy.

806
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,831
- There he is.
- Who? Bob?

807
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,145
There he is! Hi, Bob!

808
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,425
There it is.

809
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,319
You saved my life.

810
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,029
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

811
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,787
I just can't believe you would do that
for a human.

812
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,711
Humans, monsters, what's the difference?

813
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,504
Yeah, right. Right.

814
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,958
Wait. What are you doing here?

815
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,966
Well, you know,
vampires can predict the future,

816
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,844
so I knew you would need my help.

817
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,134
Never heard that before.

818
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,386
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a well-known fact.

819
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,222
What are you doing here?

820
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,396
Well, I'm here to get that.

821
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,360
Yeah, it's a family heirloom.

822
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:25,986
Yeah, it was lost at sea,
and my great-grandfather is... Was!

823
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,451
Was totally obsessed with getting it back.

824
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:33,827
So, anywho, thanks for saving my life,
but I can take it from...

825
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,088
Got to be a little more careful.

826
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,961
How many times can you save my life, right?

827
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,963
I don't know. Every time?

828
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,799
Really? Well, then...

829
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,564
That was incredible.

830
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:00,452
Don't you want to get
your family heirloom thingy?

831
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:02,999
Right.

832
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,253
Got it.

833
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,664
Here, let me get that for you.

834
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,664
Dad!

835
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:48,957
Mavis!

836
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,210
What are you doing to my father?

837
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,840
Wait!

838
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,635
Mavis, stop! Put her down!

839
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,889
No! She's trying to hurt you.
Why can't you see that?

840
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,972
Because I...

841
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,898
Because I Zinged.

842
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:09,771
- What?
- I Zinged with Ericka.

843
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,777
No, that can't be true.

844
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,575
You only Zing once.

845
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,994
That's what I thought, too.

846
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,488
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

847
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,076
Well, it's a thing for monsters.

848
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,416
It's kind of like our "love at first sight."

849
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,214
What? No. No, no, no.

850
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,633
- You don't even know me.
- Well, not yet.

851
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,006
- But we're just...
- No, you don't understand.

852
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,679
I can't be with you.

853
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,303
I could never be with someone like you.

854
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,846
I could never be with

855
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,886
a monster.

856
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,861
Dad, I'm so sorry.

857
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,026
- I...
- It doesn't matter.

858
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,076
You heard what she said.

859
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,585
But a Zing never lies.

860
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,897
You got it!

861
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,312
Yes.

862
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,153
Now that we have
the instrument of destruction,

863
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,076
our family legacy will be fulfilled.

864
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:43,702
But first, we'll draw them in
with a dance party!

865
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:44,952
I love to dance.

866
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,966
Frank, could you zip me up?

867
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,517
We're gonna be late.

868
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,890
Where did you get those?

869
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,143
See, here's the funny thing.

870
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,187
I lost my hands gambling,
but... It's no big deal!

871
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,234
Look, I got these from the seafood buffet.

872
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,730
Look at this. Clickety-click, click,
clack, clack, click, click.

873
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,860
I kind of like 'em. I like 'em.

874
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,692
I guess the party's this way.

875
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,290
Let's get this party started right!

876
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,121
All right!

877
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:15,335
What?

878
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:21,136
I thought they said the party was this way.

879
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,952
DJ in a clamshell?

880
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,205
I'm so jealous.

881
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:43,086
I can't believe my dad Zinged
with someone who's trying to kill him.

882
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,762
Yeah, the Zing makes you do crazy things.

883
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,089
Really, Johnny?

884
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:52,349
What's most important to understand
is that love is an infinite enigma

885
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,555
that is beyond our understanding.

886
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:58,059
You and I were two halves, a world apart.

887
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:01,195
But then we followed the strands of destiny

888
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,896
and were brought together.

889
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,653
And our halves made one whole.

890
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,117
But what if she and he...

891
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,572
You must release all the negativity
and look within.

892
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,703
Your bond is unbreakable.

893
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,210
You're right, honey.

894
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,000
Thanks.

895
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,714
You sounded pretty smart, Dad.

896
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,793
That? Yeah, it was just the philosophy

897
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,469
of Sifu Sing from my favorite
TV show when I was a kid,

898
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,218
<i>Kung Fu Shaolin Monk Master.</i>

899
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,673
Anyways, let's get back to dancing!

900
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,050
Cool.

901
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,640
Dad? You have to talk to Ericka.

902
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,145
- What?
- I know.

903
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:43,024
I know what I said before,
but maybe I overreacted a teensy bit.

904
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,651
It's just the thought of losing you.

905
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,826
What? What are you talking about, losing me?

906
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,994
Well, obviously, after you get married,

907
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,821
you're gonna live on the ship
and travel around the world...

908
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,449
Slow down, Mavis.

909
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,626
There are two things I can promise you.

910
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:03,545
One, nothing can ever take me
from you and all my family.

911
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,752
Two, I will never live on a boat.

912
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,882
You're my cute little tarantula.

913
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,808
How could I ever leave you?

914
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,057
Now, seriously, go talk to her.

915
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:21,188
I can't. You heard what she said,
she could never be with someone like me.

916
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,360
No, Dad. You're just a half,

917
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,655
and you have to follow
your destiny to find an infinite whole.

918
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,690
You sound like Johnny.

919
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,527
Point is, you can't deny a Zing.

920
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,238
Monster, human, unicorn...

921
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:35,539
It doesn't matter.

922
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,492
So go to her! Now!

923
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,537
Okay. I'm on it.

924
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,585
Hey, man, you're not allowed up here.

925
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,041
The DJ booth is a sacred space.

926
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,097
No. Tinkles, quiet.

927
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,302
Who is this?

928
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:02,099
I know you recognize me, your greatest rival.

929
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,897
Right.

930
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,980
You own that Holiday Inn down by the airport.

931
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:12,576
No! It is I, Abraham Van Helsing.

932
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,286
Van Helsing?

933
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:15,988
After all these years?

934
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,081
You look awful.

935
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,744
Always with the quick insults.

936
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,671
Well, this will shut you up.

937
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,419
And all monsters.

938
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:30,461
That's just Ericka's family heirloom thingy.

939
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,092
Good one, Ericka.

940
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,430
Ericka?

941
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,091
You fool.

942
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:40,805
Not only is she the ship's captain,
but she also happens to be...

943
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:45,559
Wait. You tell him.

944
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,946
I'm his great-granddaughter.

945
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,529
I'm Ericka Van Helsing.

946
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,946
I knew there was something wrong with her.

947
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,029
But...

948
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,658
See, what happened...

949
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:05,087
Now that we're all caught up,
let's get back to the dying.

950
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:10,960
Behold, the key to the demise
of all monsters.

951
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,144
Let's see.

952
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,271
Right... Okay.

953
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,824
Listen to the melody of your destruction.

954
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,413
What's this little doodad do?

955
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,325
Yeah!

956
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,975
Hey, look! It's the Kraken.

957
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:23,953
Everybody out! Now!

958
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,422
We're trapped! Everybody back!

959
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,578
Baby!

960
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,255
Papa!

961
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,642
This has to stop now!

962
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:26,803
Drac, no!

963
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:41,776
Dad!

964
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,450
Mavis!

965
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,828
Time for the immortal Dracula to die.

966
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,669
Dad!

967
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:07,177
No!

968
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:09,687
Ericka!

969
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,435
Bob! Help!

970
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:20,865
Tinkles?

971
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,032
Dennis.

972
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,695
Oh, no. Bob is Tinkles?

973
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,200
How did he get here?

974
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,202
But thank goodness he did, 'cause look!

975
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,449
You can't do this!

976
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,330
You're wrong about monsters!

977
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:16,129
Dracula... He saved my life.

978
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,497
What?

979
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,291
I'm so sorry, Drac.

980
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,794
I was trying to kill you this whole time,

981
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,504
but then I realized how wrong I was.

982
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,635
How wrong all of this is.

983
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,259
And then I...

984
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:30,935
I Zinged.

985
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,146
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

986
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,599
It's a monster thing.

987
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,059
You wouldn't understand.

988
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,606
It's like true love.

989
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:40,895
Love?

990
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,951
Well, I guess the legacy ends with me.

991
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,365
That's an awkward ending.

992
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:50,113
Nope!

993
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:52,912
It's time to start a new legacy.

994
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,544
A monster-human legacy.

995
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,621
No!

996
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,931
Drac! Van Helsing's beats are
controlling the giant octopus thingy.

997
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,602
If there's one thing I hate, it's an evil DJ.

998
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,935
We need positive energy!

999
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,357
Get ready for a DJ battle!

1000
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:28,193
You just carry
all that stuff around with you?

1001
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:31,488
Once a bar mitzvah DJ,
always a bar mitzvah DJ.

1002
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:35,493
We're gonna use good music
to defeat his evil music.

1003
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,044
- What?
- Trust me, I know the tunes,

1004
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,917
but you've got the power.

1005
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,714
All right. Okay.

1006
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,589
Opening song needs to be off the shizak.

1007
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,003
Got it. Play this!

1008
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,806
<i>I'm picking up good vibrations</i>

1009
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,809
<i>She's giving me excitations</i>

1010
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,186
- <i>Good</i>
- <i>I'm picking up</i>

1011
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,892
<i>Good vibrations</i>

1012
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,522
<i>She's giving me</i>

1013
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,979
<i>Excitations</i>

1014
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,780
<i>Good, good, good</i>

1015
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,232
<i>Good vibrations</i>

1016
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,487
<i>She's giving me...</i>

1017
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,318
What is that noise?

1018
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,120
<i>I'm picking up good vibrations</i>

1019
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,789
<i>She's giving me excitations</i>

1020
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,286
I like this one.

1021
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:17,743
This feels good.

1022
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,162
<i>Good vibrations</i>

1023
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,417
The fool.

1024
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,232
His music is too powerful!

1025
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,443
We're gonna need something
even more positive.

1026
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:52,826
Now, Drac!

1027
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,167
<i>So don't worry</i>

1028
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:05,965
<i>Be happy</i>

1029
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,167
<i>Don't worry</i>

1030
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,878
- Really?
- It has a nice message.

1031
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:15,016
<i>Don't worry</i>

1032
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:17,885
<i>Be happy</i>

1033
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,311
I've had enough of this nonsense!

1034
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,545
Johnny, we need the most brain-dominating,

1035
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:52,128
toe-tappinating song
in the history of all the universe.

1036
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,301
Come on. Where is it?

1037
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,763
I don't know!

1038
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,898
There's too many choices.

1039
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,478
No, wait!

1040
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,648
This is it.

1041
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,416
What the...

1042
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,102
Boy, that stinks.

1043
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,686
It's working!

1044
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:02,078
Hey, Johnny's corny music
is defeating the evil music.

1045
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:03,617
I kind of like it.

1046
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,477
No!

1047
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:53,670
I'm a slave to the rhythm!

1048
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:00,923
No!

1049
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,011
Drac, what are you doing?

1050
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,180
You got to be greater than the haters!

1051
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,197
Why?

1052
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,499
Why, after everything,

1053
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:29,206
would you save my life?

1054
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:32,376
Because basically we are all the same.

1055
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:36,172
Claws or hands, two eyes or three eyes.

1056
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,218
- Green skin.
- No skin.

1057
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,716
- Prickly.
- Brainy.

1058
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:46,887
I'm sorry.

1059
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,905
You are amazing.

1060
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,168
Look at me, Dennis. Look at me.

1061
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,585
Come on, you can't deny it.

1062
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,342
No! I'm too young to Zing!

1063
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,223
Well, I feel kind of silly now.

1064
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:27,760
For decades I have hunted your kind,

1065
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,770
persecuted you.

1066
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:36,103
The only thing I can do
to make it up to you is

1067
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,692
give you

1068
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:41,858
a 30% refund.

1069
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,406
Preposterous!

1070
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:47,322
All right.

1071
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,785
Full refund.

1072
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:22,323
Wayne, Wanda, what happened to you guys?

1073
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,867
Yeah, we, like, hardly saw you on the cruise.

1074
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,068
Yeah, I know.

1075
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:29,031
We got tranquilized and spent
most of the trip locked in a closet.

1076
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,117
We're gonna book it again for the holidays.

1077
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,419
Hi. Checking in?

1078
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:41,216
Yes. Thank you.

1079
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:43,511
Great. I have a room all ready for you.

1080
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:47,094
Hey, buddy, would you mind?

1081
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,633
Sure thing, pal.

1082
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:08,111
Okay, what's going on, sneaky pants?

1083
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:09,946
Nothing.

1084
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:14,625
It's just, I wanted to make sure
nobody would bother us.

1085
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:16,869
Why?

1086
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,670
Are you going to suck-a my blood?
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1087
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:22,751
No.

1088
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,420
I was going to ask you

1089
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:27,805
if you would marry me.

1090
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,311
Well? What do you say?

1091
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,434
Will you marry me?

1092
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,315
I... I...

1093
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:47,612
Wha...

1094
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,241
I mean, I woobee doobeedee?

1095
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,168
What did she say?

1096
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,331
I'm not sure.

1097
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:05,801
Yes!
