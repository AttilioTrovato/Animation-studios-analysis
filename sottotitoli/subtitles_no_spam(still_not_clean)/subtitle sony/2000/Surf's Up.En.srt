1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,074

2
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,202
Quiet on the set. And we're rolling.

3
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,938
Cody Maverick interview, take one.

4
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:36,782
Why are you guys here
to interview me?

5
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,077
It's what we do.
We're a reality film crew.

6
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:41,814
Should I know some of the questions
before we start?

7
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:44,457
- No. They're easy.
- Okay.

8
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,185
- Can you stand on that box, please?
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:51,263
Right there? What is that?

10
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:53,433
- What is that?
- A sound thing. It's a microphone.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,862
What's up, man? I'm Cody.

12
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:56,798
And you're what, 14, 15 years old?

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,004
Seventeen years of age.

14
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:01,163
And any other skills
besides surfing?

15
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,309
Like what?
Like singing and dancing?

16
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:04,466
Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,175
No, not me, man. I just surf.

18
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:09,838
- Loser.
- I just...

19
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:12,483
Cut it out, Glen. Stop, man.

20
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:14,142
We're here to make
a movie about Cody.

21
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,050
- Does he have to be here?
- It's gonna be great.

22
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:18,050
Can I get in line now to not see it?

23
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:18,600
We'll re-slate.

24
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:22,360
Since we're talking about surfing,
give us your thoughts about surfing.

25
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:23,893
Surfing. Surfing.

26
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,300
- Where do I start?
- How about at the beginning?

27
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:30,400
Okay, well...

28
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:36,167
So as soon as there was the first wave,
right? There was the first surfer.

29
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:41,738
All they needed was, like,
a piece of driftwood...

30
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:45,510
...a block of ice or something like
that, and then they were off.

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,355
And they were hooked, man.
They were hooked.

32
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:56,824
Up till recent times, you had
your old dudes. Your hang-six cats.

33
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:59,966
These old guys used to lay down
with these huge, humongous boards.

34
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:03,436
These guys were the pioneers...

35
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:06,697
...but nobody saw
what surfing could really be...

36
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:09,504
...until Big Z did it.

37
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,770
- Could you tell us who Big Z was?
- Who was Big Z?

38
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:17,610
You're asking the right guy.
You got that far. Z is everything.

39
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:19,513
Big Z is surfing.
I mean, he's...

40
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:21,847
There may well as not have been
an ocean before Z.

41
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:24,149
They invented the ocean for him.

42
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:29,627
He lived so hard
because he wasn't afraid to live.

43
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:31,861
He wasn't afraid to die.

44
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,074
He came to Antarctica
when I was just a kid.

45
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:50,775
Man, it was the biggest thing
that ever happened here.

46
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,681
And suddenly there he was.

47
00:02:54,855 --> 00:03:00,316
Just floating over the water.
Hovering, you know, like weightless.

48
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:06,732
He could've walked up to anyone...

49
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,399
...and he walks right up to me.

50
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:15,366
And he gives me this awesome,
one-of-a-kind Big Z necklace.

51
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:20,040
And then he tells me,
"You know, kid, never give up.

52
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:23,705
Find a way,
because that's what winners do. "

53
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,117
He was the greatest.

54
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:33,690
Everyone looked up to him,
respected him, loved him.

55
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,900
And one day, one day
I'm gonna be just like him.

56
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:53,450
And I've been surfing
ever since I can remember.

57
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:57,700
It's hard to imagine my life
when I wasn't surfing.

58
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:01,300
I want to get out of here,
and this is my ticket out.

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,650
I'm really good, man.
I'm the best on the island.

60
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,900
I know it sounds cocky for saying that,
but, I mean, I am, like the best.

61
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,700
I was born and raised here
in Shiverpool.

62
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,437
Lived here my whole life.

63
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,639
That's where they sort the fish. It's
the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

64
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:33,682
But yeah, I worked there
just to pacify my mom a little bit.

65
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,580
Good old Shiverpool.

66
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,356
This place sucks, bro.

67
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:44,087
I worked my way up from the sardine
pile, then to the mackerel pile...

68
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,093
...and I ended up
on the gefilte fish pile.

69
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,562
- All hard work.
- Not like some I could mention.

70
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,928
Yes, this farkakte kid
with the thing on the water.

71
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:52,494
My house?

72
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,764
Over there. You see it
right there with the surfboards?

73
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:59,041
Yeah, I just live here with me
and my brother, Glen, my mom.

74
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:02,375
He was a little, teeny, small egg.

75
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:05,281
He wasn't very impressive.

76
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,441
Glen was the big egg,
Cody was the small egg.

77
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,620
He can't help it.
That's just the way he is.

78
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:11,881
I mean, he's out there...

79
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:16,682
...in the water all day
shirking his responsibilities.

80
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:20,520
You know, hatching these eggs
is a big responsibility.

81
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,996
And my brother, Cody,
he just doesn't understand that.

82
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:27,797
- He needs to step up and be a man.
- It takes a real man to sit on an egg.

83
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:30,942
- You know it.
- Quincy, come to Daddy.

84
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,270
He wants to be different.
All the time with the different.

85
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:34,810
Who's got the time in the day to...

86
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,470
Only six months in a day.

87
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:38,445
- Thanks for making it.
- Sorry. It was too good to miss.

88
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,085
- Thanks for making it.
- How was it out there?

89
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,981
He's the big brother.
I'm the little brother.

90
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm not touching you.

91
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,646
- Not gonna touch you.
- Do you see this?

92
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,087
- Don't. Please?
- I'm not.

93
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,624
He makes sure that I know that.

94
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:53,553
I had to fight for everything.
Even Mom's tuna casserole.

95
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:01,864
I'm lucky I survived.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,066
It really wasn't that easy
for him growing up.

97
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:07,304
Like I said before...

98
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,575
...he never really knew his father.

99
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:17,649
I'm not really the person to ask about it
because I was too young to remember.

100
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:20,416
Look, I'm not the only kid
on the island...

101
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:24,119
...whose dad was, you know, eaten.

102
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:30,096
- Still, it had to be traumatic.
- No. Not for me, bro. Not for me.

103
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:34,699
- What's your dream?
- To go away.

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,876
- To go away. That's great.
- Do you guys want a drink?

105
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:42,104
Got to run away
from responsibility and life.

106
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,542
This is unique.

107
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:45,910
- This is not the norm.
- "I have dreams."

108
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:50,118
- When is this not happening?
- Don't make that noise.

109
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,283
- Cody!
- It's really disrespectful.

110
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:56,657
I would never do that.

111
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,459
You just wouldn't make it
out of your mouth.

112
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:02,293
That's the difference
between you and me.

113
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,730
You know what?
I can't do this anymore.

114
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,131
Mom. Look what you did.

115
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:08,670
This is for me. This isn't for you.
Why is Glen still here?

116
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,365
Oh, yeah, exactly. Mom!

117
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,477
I don't understand why
everybody's so judgmental.

118
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,840
I understand why Mom's judgmental.

119
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:19,575
I think it's because she cares,
partially. It's also partially because...

120
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:22,242
...everyone else is looking at her like,
"Hey, Cody's just a bum.

121
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,820
Cody's this. Cody's that.
Cody's this. "

122
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,050
Cody's me, bro. Let me be me.

123
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,388
When is that gonna start?

124
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:45,740
You know what they call me?
The dream maker. The dream maker.

125
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:49,113
I find these kids,
I bring them here...

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,511
...and I give them a chance
to be somebody.

127
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:56,485
You know my greatest joy
as a surf promoter? Finding Z.

128
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:58,121
Watching him rise to the top.

129
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,521
I still can't believe he's gone.
He was like a son to me, you know?

130
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:06,460
It was a heart thing, you know?
Can we just take five minutes?

131
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,792
How's my hair? Is it messed up?
I ain't got all day. Is it mussed?

132
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,663
We just have a few more questions
about Big Z.

133
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:13,531
But right now
I think we're more interested...

134
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:16,071
...in the Reggie Belafonte story,
and who could blame us?

135
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,970
But Big Z is kind of the focus
of our...

136
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:20,043
Let's get the coconut filler guy
over here.

137
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,838
And how about the guy
sweeping the sand?

138
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:25,813
Can we hear your boring story
about your tedious, ridiculous life?

139
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:27,679
Get your feathers off it! Stop!

140
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:29,820
I ain't got all day.
I got a big production here.

141
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:31,148
Roll, okay? Just roll!

142
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:35,549
Welcome, fans, to another edition
of SPEN Sports.

143
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,359
This is Sal Masakela...

144
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,863
...and we're here at the surfing capital
of the world, Pen Gu Island...

145
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:46,333
...for a preview of the tenth annual
Big Z Memorial Surf-Off.

146
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:49,397
Professional surfers
extraordinaire...

147
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:51,439
...Kelly and Rob tell us...

148
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:54,009
...what challenges
our surfers are going to face.

149
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,938
First things first, Sal. The wave.
It's the perfect combination...

150
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:02,576
...of beauty and danger. Even
the pros are terrified of this place.

151
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:05,782
Hi, Mom.

152
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,481
Dig this, Sal. Section behind me.

153
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:11,125
It's "The Boneyards."
Few surfers have ventured in there...

154
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:12,320
...and come out alive.

155
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:15,091
Are you trying to tell me
people have died here?

156
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,894
- That's right, Sal.
- A moment of silence for them.

157
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:22,130
And we keep it moving because
if the Boneyards was not enough...

158
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:26,209
...our surfers will be facing off with
Tank "The Shredder" Evans.

159
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:29,210
Tank, nine-time defending champ.

160
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:31,311
A role model? No.

161
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:35,445
But I do consider myself somebody
that everyone should look up to.

162
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,214
Kids should try to pretend
that they're Tank.

163
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:40,857
I mean, they should try.
Good luck, kids.

164
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:44,353
You never want to get in there
and help them out...

165
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,260
...and show them how to surf
and spend some time with the kids?

166
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,094
No, I don't want to do that.

167
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:52,498
- Anyway, this is my wave.
- Always classy Tank Evans.

168
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,400
Coming up after the break,
penguin dodge ball. Stick around.

169
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:00,174
Okay, to get back to the competition,
I just want to say:

170
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm scouring the globe
for the next big thing.

171
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:04,980
But that's another story.

172
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,147
He doesn't look for them.
I find them.

173
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,047
I find these penguins.
I find the talent.

174
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:16,985
Reggie has sent me everywhere
on this trip.

175
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:18,718
Anyplace there's an ocean...

176
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:21,691
...a lake, a puddle.
It's ridiculous.

177
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,832
I am on so much migraine medication,
you have no idea.

178
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:29,167
The stress is killing me. I don't know
how much longer I can last.

179
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,331
I have to tell you that right now.

180
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,406
You gotta try
this blowhole thing, man.

181
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:38,845
This whale dude
is giving me a brain freeze.

182
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,986
I lost a bet.

183
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:45,720
Excuse me. Excuse me.

184
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,348
Does anybody
in this entire frozen wasteland surf?

185
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,155
- The Cody Maverick kid does that.
- Wonderful. Thank you.

186
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:54,331
You know, you're sitting on...
thin ice.

187
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,627
Excuse me, I'm looking for...
I'm looking for Cody Maverick.

188
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:01,431
- Has anyone seen Cody Maverick?
- I'm Cody Maverick.

189
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:06,037
Mike Abromowitz from the Big Z
Memorial Surf-Off, Pen Gu Island.

190
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,041
You came here on a wha...
You came to see me. Wow!

191
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:12,308
- Quite a slip-and-slider, aren't you?
- You're here. What an honor, sir.

192
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:14,849
Lovely. Wonderful. I hear you surf.

193
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,611
- Is this true?
- You gotta see what I can do.

194
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:18,483
- You can actually stand on a board?
- I'll be back.

195
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:20,851
You're gonna see what I can do
everything's gonna be good...

196
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,516
...and I'm coming with you.
- I can't imagine a better day.

197
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:27,722
Ma! Ma, he came... the scout.
Mikey. He came. He's here.

198
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,561
- What? Yeah.
- He's giving me a shot now, Ma.

199
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:32,293
You want to come watch me surf?

200
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,404
- No, that's okay.
- Just this time.

201
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:39,373
- I'm busy. I'm chopping here.
- Okay. All right, well, wish me luck.

202
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,843
Cody, just be careful
of those big waves.

203
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,809
Well, anytime now.

204
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:52,282
You should have been here yesterday.
We had a sweet swell yesterday.

205
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:55,426
I was doing some layback 360s
and floaters. It was insane.

206
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:56,924
Wow! Start the whale.

207
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,029
No! Wait! Wait!
Just give me one more chance.

208
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:00,858
- All I need is one, please.
- You just had it.

209
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,966
- Dude, please don't go.
- Tough break, kid.

210
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:05,500
- Just wait one second.
- Better luck next year. Move it.

211
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,605
- Let's go. He's coming!
- Just one wave. That's all I need.

212
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:12,699
I've never won anything
my whole life.

213
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:16,479
Just once I want to feel like a winner.

214
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:21,044
I used to scout songbirds. Toucans
for this musical revue in Brazil.

215
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:23,483
Now that's show business.
Toucans...

216
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:24,712
Hold on!

217
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:28,487
I don't care what you say,
I'm coming to Pen Gu!

218
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:33,494
No way, no how.
This is a contest for big-wave surfers.

219
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:36,155
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
Step on it, fish sticks!

220
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,128
No, no, no, no!

221
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:48,170
Poor kid. I feel bad a little bit.
Honestly, this is embar...

222
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:49,813
No, wait! Wait!

223
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,457
Did you guys see that?
He almost had my board!

224
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:07,262
He almost had it.
Next time we'll get it.

225
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:09,297
- Yeah, so anyway...
- Wait!

226
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:34,053
We got you. We got you.
Oh, you are heavier than you look.

227
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,288
- Man, we did it.
- Thank you.

228
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:37,951
Teamwork always pays off.

229
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:39,858
- I'm Chicken Joe, man.
- Thanks, Joe.

230
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:43,398
Don't you ever, ever, do anything
like that in the contest, all right?

231
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:44,830
- I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

232
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:48,904
Because that was entertaining,
in a horrifying sort of way.

233
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:51,631
Right on, dude.

234
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,642
My name's Cody Maverick,
Shiverpool. You?

235
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:58,145
No, I'm not from Shiverpool.

236
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:02,078
- Where are you from?
- Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan.

237
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,244
That's where I surf.
I was the only one...

238
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:07,588
...around my town who did it.

239
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,158
A lot of people thought
I was crazy, but I'm used to that.

240
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:12,523
- I know how you feel, Joe.
- You do?

241
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:15,391
- Yeah.
- Radical.

242
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,170
- Butt freeze!
- Somebody help the chicken.

243
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,036
Look out!

244
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:05,315
Slater, Machado.
How's it going, bros?

245
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:06,711
- Good. Thanks.
- What's up, buddy?

246
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,613
Okay. Later, dudes.

247
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:11,078
Radical.

248
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:35,638
Dude, look where I'm standing.
I'm standing where Z stood.

249
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:41,249
- Aw, man.
- Dude, you gotta try this.

250
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,979
- No, I'm okay.
- Come on. Just one bite.

251
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,487
All right. One bite, that's it.

252
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:49,587
Yeah, yeah? What do you think?

253
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,024
It's not bad.
It kind of tastes like chicken...

254
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:54,363
Yep. What's chi-chi?

255
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,759
Coming through! Oh, crap.

256
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:05,542
Oh, man. I'm in love.

257
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,770
Help me! I'm drowning!

258
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:15,747
What are you standing here
next to me for? Go talk to her, man.

259
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,945
- I'm not gonna talk to her.
- She's digging on you.

260
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:19,214
- She called you crap.
- Joe.

261
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,324
- Thanks again.
- All right, well...

262
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,756
...this is the third time
you've been unconscious this week.

263
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,759
I just don't think
it's very good for your brain.

264
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,490
- I know. Bye, Lani.
- Okay.

265
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,160
Yeah, that was awesome
how you saved his life and all.

266
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:35,965
That was just unbelievable. Really.

267
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,367
You here for the surf contest?

268
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:45,343
- Well, I'll be watching you.
- Really? You'll be watching me?

269
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:47,143
Well, yeah,
from the lifeguard station.

270
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:49,616
- Yeah. Right.
- It's my job.

271
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:51,914
- That's your job.
- Are you gonna kiss her?

272
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:54,114
- What's going on?
- Come on, Joe.

273
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,556
- You were saying you were in love...
- No, I didn't say that.

274
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,422
- Look, he really digs you.
- Joe, listen...

275
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:00,757
He likes you, though. See you.

276
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:03,024
I love my job.
I have an amazing job.

277
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,565
Just this week, with the contest...

278
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,571
...it's a little crazy. You really
have to be extra, extra attentive.

279
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,934
When you have so many guys
in the water you can't miss a thing.

280
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,773
But you know what? I have a perfect
record. I've never lost anybody.

281
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,006
Sure, there have been
close calls, but...

282
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:21,777
- Help!
- Oh, Arnold. I turn my back for one...

283
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:24,284
- Just lay some feeling on her.
- How do you mean?

284
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:27,822
- Through words. Through touch.
- Walk me through the approach.

285
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,358
- I'm Lani. You're me.
- You sure about that?

286
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,588
- I get real serious.
- Let's not. Let's not.

287
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:35,254
- Whoa.
- What is it?

288
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,394
That's it! That's Big Z's shrine.

289
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:41,970
- Remember?
- No, no. Not really.

290
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:47,242
Today, the world of surfing
lost one of its legends.

291
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:50,039
Big Z took his final ride
this morning...

292
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:54,708
...during a competition with
up-and-coming surfer Tank Evans.

293
00:17:55,286 --> 00:18:00,223
Z was last seen paddling into
a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.

294
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:13,970
Friends of Big Z gathered
to remember and celebrate his life.

295
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,329
Great shot!

296
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:18,975
What? Hey!

297
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:22,410
- Every time.
- He's got a pretty good throwing fin.

298
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,741
Stop doing... Stop it! Cut it out!

299
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:28,417
- That's like three in a row.
- Here, give it a shot.

300
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:34,987
What? Wait a minute. Look at this.

301
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,593
- Don't. Stop it.
- It's a Big Z necklace.

302
00:18:37,762 --> 00:18:40,822
That's not funny. Stop.
Stop! What are you doing?

303
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:43,125
Look, everybody, it's Big Z's last fan!

304
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,199
Coming through.
Out of the way. Let's go.

305
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:47,360
- You don't deserve to talk about him.
- He's a big zero.

306
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:49,028
- Shut your mouth!
- Zero starts with "Z"!

307
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:52,039
You'll never be
as good as Big Z, Stank.

308
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:56,738
Hey, hey, people, come on now.
Smile on your brother.

309
00:18:56,914 --> 00:19:01,248
- Keep your girlfriend out of this!
- You can't do that to my friend.

310
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:04,921
You're getting quite a workout there.
That feels good.

311
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:08,581
Why don't you work on my glutes
a little bit? That's very nice.

312
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:14,288
- All right. That's enough, guys.
- I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

313
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:18,026
Well, then how about
right here, right now, huh?

314
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:20,534
Hey, Mikey, get this kid a board!

315
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:24,538
All right, who wants to see
the little guy take on the champ?

316
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:26,367
Little guys rule!

317
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:33,382
A little one-on-one surfing action
between Tank Evans and Jerry...

318
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,314
- Cody. Cody.
- Cody Maverick.

319
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:40,317
Cody Mavencourt. And the one
that rides the biggest wave wins.

320
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:55,331
Are you nervous
about going against Tank Evans?

321
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:57,940
Ah, Tank. Nervous?
What do I have to be nervous about?

322
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:18,725
Give it up! Come on, now!

323
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:20,727
I'm gonna chum the water
with your head.

324
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:24,163
- Bring it on, pecker face. Let's go.
- Pecker face?

325
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,770
It's mine!

326
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,784
So, Cody, when you take
your first wave...

327
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,420
...and the whole island's there
to watch, what'll it be like?

328
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:47,421
It's gonna be amazing.
It'll be the best wave of my life.

329
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:49,991
I hope the cameras are rolling
because you'll want to watch it...

330
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,687
...over and over and over again.
It's gonna be awesome!

331
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:10,145
I can't look.

332
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:14,243
- Poor kid. He's... Poor kid.
- Wow! That was spectacular!

333
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:20,014
I'm number one! The Tank!

334
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,916
We're trying to get the details.
The lifeguard just pulled him in.

335
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:04,890
That's what happens
when you take on the Tank, right?

336
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:07,898
Cody, Cody!

337
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:10,734
- How is he? Okay? What can I do?
- Yeah, he's okay.

338
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:15,902
I can help. Except if there's blood.
Just the thought of blood makes me...

339
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,739
Somebody help the chicken.

340
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,407
- Tank, you okay?
- Tank needs fuel.

341
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,114
Mikey, get the board, will you?

342
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:26,749
Come on. Come on. Come on.

343
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:36,226
- Did I win? I won, huh?
- You should've stayed in Antarctica.

344
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,293
- Oh, wow.
- You're gonna be okay.

345
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,668
Look at that.
There's pixies everywhere.

346
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:48,634
What do you think about Cody going
into a contest and possibly winning?

347
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:49,836
- You know, I'm...
- Ha.

348
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:53,780
- Why did you just laugh?
- Because he keeps saying "possible."

349
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:58,388
Like it's "possible" that you're gonna
win. And you're gonna do anything.

350
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:01,922
- Really, what are the chances?
- They're high. Aren't they high?

351
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:06,287
I mean, they're normal chances.
It's not like I'm, like, the underdog.

352
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:21,640
Hey, Geek! Geek!
Get up and help me.

353
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:23,412
Geek.

354
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:25,739
Geek?

355
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:31,816
Geek. Wake up! I need your help.

356
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:34,620
Come on. Get off your lazy butt
and come and help me.

357
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,453
Beautiful dream.

358
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,926
- Did you ever know Sheila?
- No. I don't know Sheila.

359
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:42,065
- Wait, wait, wait. What?
- What?

360
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,221
Who's this guy?

361
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,130
- He's a surfer. He's hurt.
- Who are all those guys?

362
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:48,430
They're with him. Ignore them.

363
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:50,334
- Come on.
- Lani, what are you doing?

364
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:52,668
If you help him, they'll go away.

365
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:55,368
- Hey! Get out of here!
- Help him!

366
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,876
- Where do you want him?
- Nowhere. That's the whole point.

367
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:02,075
- No outsiders. Come on.
- I know, I know, I know.

368
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:06,586
This is an emergency. He went down
bad over the falls. I don't know if he...

369
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:11,758
- And did he hit the reef?
- I don't know.

370
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:13,419
I'm not sure. I got him after...

371
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:15,394
- What, is he your boyfriend?
- No. No.

372
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:19,127
Wait, wait, wait.
Looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.

373
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,462
Stepped on me? Are you kidding?
This guy was dancing on me.

374
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:28,608
Just look at this. Broken, broken,
gone, gone, broken, broken, broken...

375
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:33,614
This is pretty bad.
This is really bad.

376
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:36,482
- What... Cody!
- I hurt.

377
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:40,054
- You're gonna be okay. What?
- Maybe I shouldn't have taken that out.

378
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:42,124
Poison's released. Wow. Amazing.

379
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,726
- What's amazing?
- That you're still alive.

380
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:49,093
It's all right. I'm gonna fix you up.
I can fix your foot just fine.

381
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:53,030
- Where is it? I've been looking...
- It's a saw. You just threw a saw.

382
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:57,970
Don't let him move like that. He's
pushing the poison all over his body.

383
00:24:58,142 --> 00:25:00,372
- Come on, come on.
- I know he looks...

384
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:02,478
Here it is.

385
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:05,538
- What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

386
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:07,013
This is a sure-fire cure.

387
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:11,143
I learned it from an old medicine
man. It, well, works wonders.

388
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,414
- What? No! Not that!
- Not what?

389
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:15,819
What is he gonna... Gonna what?

390
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,927
- Come on, now.
- Geek, stop.

391
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:21,531
Let's do this. Lani, can you make
some water sounds?

392
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:23,996
- Oh, my gosh, this is so gross.
- What is water sounds?

393
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:27,899
- Come on. Here we go.
- No, no, no. You...

394
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,935
Kid, you better keep your mouth shut.
See, what'd I tell you?

395
00:25:35,112 --> 00:25:38,172
Hold his foot still, Lani. Come on.
Knock him out or something.

396
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:40,509
- I'm running on empty here.
- I'm trying!

397
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:48,255
So how you been?

398
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,761
Wow, sea urchin in the foot.
That sounds pretty nasty.

399
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:52,918
Yeah.

400
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,791
How do you cure something like that?

401
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:57,364
You pee on it.

402
00:25:58,168 --> 00:26:00,636
- That's disgusting.
- I know!

403
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:04,205
Hey. How long am I stuck
with this guy?

404
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,239
- Because you know...
- Till he's better.

405
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:11,006
Well, come back soon and,
please, bring me some clams.

406
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,705
- No.
- I'm running low here.

407
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,545
I can't keep doing this. You've got
to start taking care of yourself.

408
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,380
- Oh, come on.
- Bye.

409
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:22,349
- Bring me some more clams!
- Okay.

410
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:34,932
If it's just as well with you,
I don't want to talk about Cody.

411
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:37,198
He lost. That's it.
That's his problem. It's not mine.

412
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:39,239
Aren't you concerned
about anybody's well-being...?

413
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,173
The kid's fine. He was born in water.
He's a penguin, for crying out loud!

414
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:45,110
- Did you see that wave hit him?
- That's the whole idea of surfing.

415
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:48,410
- I care. I care!
- Mikey! Wait till you see this.

416
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:51,412
Look at those little legs.
Stick, stick, stick, sticky.

417
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:54,056
It's the way I walk. I'm constantly...

418
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:57,193
- Boom-chicka-chicka...
- What's with the "boom-chicka-boom"?

419
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:01,628
I can't stand blood.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

420
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,632
I can't stand...
sight of blood. Cody!

421
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:11,365
- Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
- No.

422
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:14,742
Cody? Cody?

423
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:18,509
He's not under there.

424
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:21,814
Cody!

425
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:24,985
How's it going, man?

426
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:29,992
So I woke up this morning.

427
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,563
I didn't know where I was. It's never
a good place to be when you wake up.

428
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:36,926
Come on. Get up.

429
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,795
- I don't want to.
- Breakfast.

430
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:42,405
- Wakey, wakey. Come on.
- I don't want to.

431
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,039
- How's your foot?
- My foot...

432
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:49,304
- My foot's fine, but my head.
- Good. Good. Come on, kid. Get up.

433
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:51,776
What the...?

434
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:55,310
Yeah, I think I got a concussion.

435
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:02,086
You should meet my brother, Glen.
You guys would really hit it off.

436
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:07,754
Oh, no. No. Where's my necklace?
Did you see my necklace? It's gotta...

437
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:09,930
No, no.

438
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,228
Big deal. Get yourself another one
at Reggie's trinket shops.

439
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:16,634
It's not just some necklace, guy.
He gave it to me himself.

440
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:20,072
- Who?
- Big Z. When he came to Shiverpool.

441
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:22,677
That guy believed in me
when no one else did.

442
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:24,814
He told me never to give up
and to find a way...

443
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:27,450
...because that's what winners do.
- What winners do. Yeah.

444
00:28:27,617 --> 00:28:30,177
It's funny, you know,
what a loser I became.

445
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:34,654
Who cares what Big Z said?
You got to...

446
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:40,456
...you know, do things your own way.
- I don't have a way.

447
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:47,964
You do now. Just follow this.
It'll take you back to North Beach.

448
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:51,339
Okay, nice to meet you.
Good luck.

449
00:29:00,217 --> 00:29:01,309
What do I do now?

450
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:04,977
I can't show my face on the beach.
I can't go home.

451
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:11,417
You always visualize where you're
gonna be, what you're gonna do.

452
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:16,929
This ain't it.

453
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:48,464
- What are you doing here?
- Here.

454
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:52,534
- Oh, man. Thank you, man. This...
- Yeah.

455
00:29:52,702 --> 00:29:54,294
That's cool of you to come back.

456
00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:56,496
- Thank you.
- Better keep that knot tight.

457
00:29:56,673 --> 00:29:58,834
You lose it during a contest,
it's a goner.

458
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:02,604
Yeah, well, I'm not going
in any surf contests.

459
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:08,708
Well, there's more to surfing
than beating Tank Evans, you know.

460
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,417
Yeah.

461
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:14,522
Look at that.
You know what you're sitting on there?

462
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:16,988
That's koa wood.

463
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,287
Best surfboards in the world
are made of that stuff.

464
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:22,489
- Yeah?
- You got a koa board?

465
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:28,434
- No, I don't have a "board" board.
- Well, you wanna...?

466
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:30,696
You want to make one?

467
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:33,366
- Nah.
- What?

468
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:35,841
I come all the way back here
to give you the necklace...

469
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:39,504
...and I'm offering to make you
a board and you say, "Nah."

470
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:42,413
Get off your lazy butt.
We're making a board. Come on.

471
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:44,451
- All right.
- It's gonna be the best board...

472
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:45,645
...you ever had.

473
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:47,380
- All right?
- Okay, man.

474
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:48,615
Cody!

475
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:52,420
That's cool.

476
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:55,629
Joe, can you just tell us
why you're out here looking for Cody?

477
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,165
You know, we've known
each other way back...

478
00:30:58,335 --> 00:31:03,204
...since, like, yesterday, I think it was.
We got a lot in common.

479
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:05,532
I never really knew my father either.

480
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:14,840
Why are you making surfboards
in the middle of the jungle anyway?

481
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:17,509
I'm just trying to understand.
I don't get it.

482
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:21,214
Forget the 20 questions.
Let's just get the board made.

483
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:26,426
Okay, it's just...
Are you a surfer, or do you...?

484
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:32,058
- Very funny.
- Less talk, more pushing. Come on.

485
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:35,035
Why are we pushing it?
Why don't we just roll it?

486
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:36,998
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

487
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:40,905
I didn't know your foot was there.
Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

488
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:44,103
It's not like I intentionally did it.
I'm sorry.

489
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:48,379
- Cody. The log!
- Yeah, I know!

490
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,614
Geek! Stop, stop!

491
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,821
Cody, grab the vine. Grab the vine!

492
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:01,692
- Now, pull it.
- I'm trying!

493
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,662
Pull!

494
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:09,670
Cody!

495
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,272
Geek!

496
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:14,238
Cody!

497
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,551
Oh, no, no, no.

498
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,752
Help me up so I can kick your butt.

499
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:34,496
- I thought I killed you. You okay?
- Next time, when I say don't roll the...

500
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,791
Wait. What's that?

501
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:43,461
Yeah, it's a beach.
Sand, water, sun.

502
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:46,301
You seen one, you seen them all.
Let's get out of here.

503
00:32:46,476 --> 00:32:48,740
No, come on, man.
Let's go check it out.

504
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:56,043
You think Cody and the Geek
are doing all right?

505
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:58,949
Yeah. I hate to see him
living out there all alone.

506
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:00,987
It'll be good for him
to have something to do.

507
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,571
Hey. Somebody's old board shack.

508
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,442
Look at this.

509
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

510
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:34,352
These are Big Z's boards.

511
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:38,688
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards.
He rode this in the Australian Open.

512
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,065
This is the board he rode
when he came to Shiverpool, man.

513
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:45,997
This... I... Geek!

514
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:48,763
This is Big Z's place, man!
This is where he lived!

515
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:50,633
This is where he made his boards!

516
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:52,172
Did you know this was here?

517
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:54,436
Why didn't you wanna
come down here?

518
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:58,707
And then he went up to this
old shack, you know.

519
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:16,121
And I realized, you know...

520
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,033
...it was Z.

521
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:45,784
I could tell he needed some space
and some time to himself.

522
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:47,961
I didn't want to ask him
all these questions.

523
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:50,895
So I just kind of stood there quietly.

524
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:53,535
You're Big Z! I can't believe it.

525
00:34:53,703 --> 00:34:55,466
You're alive! You're alive!

526
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:57,435
That's the respectful way to go,
I think.

527
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:59,038
Why are you alive?
What happened?

528
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:01,473
Tell me everything.
Start at the beginning and just go.

529
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:04,407
Kid! You're gonna
hurt yourself. Relax.

530
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:08,347
And people said you were dead,
but you're not dead. You're in hiding.

531
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:10,312
Did something happen?
Something happened.

532
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,785
You saw something
you weren't supposed to see.

533
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:14,184
I knew it!
That's what happened!

534
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:17,190
Are you nuts?
It's not a conspiracy. It's no big deal.

535
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,989
- What happened?
- I don't want to talk about it.

536
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,223
You don't... Okay, I got it!

537
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:30,032
I'll be over here if you need anything
or you just feel like talking.

538
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,772
Do you feel it now? Like talking now?

539
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:35,672
- Go away.
- Got it. All right. I'm going away.

540
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:37,073
Unless you...

541
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,747
- Cody!
- Okay, got it.

542
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:42,214
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is, like, it's huge, man.

543
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:45,752
It changes everything.
The contest is a few days away.

544
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:51,019
If I can get him to train me, then...
Boom. I could win this with him.

545
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:54,952
It's my dream. And I don't want to
give up on that dream.

546
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:58,066
Winners find a way,
no matter what, right?

547
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,130
A winner is...

548
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:06,600
They see their goals.
They just go for it.

549
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:08,869
They're not in it
for the money or glory.

550
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:12,378
- A winner is... like...
- Hey, hey!

551
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:15,413
It's the surfer who's out there
having the most fun.

552
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:16,916
Yep, it's a lot of fun.

553
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,446
Right, I get you. What's winning
without the losers?

554
00:36:20,623 --> 00:36:23,091
They're in it for the joy of it
and the rapture...

555
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:25,250
...and the slow-motion
instant replay, which is my...

556
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:28,261
Head over to the snack bar
and get yourself a big bowl of shut up!

557
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:31,195
Feels better when there's a lot
of losers around.

558
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,857
Was that your question?

559
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:37,370
A winner is somebody who doesn't
knock me off my surfboard...

560
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:40,574
...and break it when I'm trying
to get some big waves.

561
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:43,541
Especially Tank.
He is definitely not a winner.

562
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:46,546
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

563
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,710
Yeah, I can't remember a time
when I wasn't surfing.

564
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,815
My mom put me right on there.
I think she pooped me out...

565
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,286
...just put me right on there.

566
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:56,152
What is it about surfing
that you love?

567
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:58,587
I love being the center of attention...

568
00:36:58,761 --> 00:37:01,491
...because it's really
where I should be.

569
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:06,265
And I love the looks
my ladies give me, you know?

570
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:10,462
The little glint. I love that.
I love holding the ladies.

571
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,668
- You know what I'm talking about?
- I think so.

572
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:16,243
- Sort of.
- Come with me.

573
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:21,315
Put this curtain in myself.

574
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:25,283
These are my ladies.

575
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,090
This is Jill.
This is my lady, Amy.

576
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:31,591
Little Suzie. Briana.

577
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:34,696
- You know why we call her Briana?
- No.

578
00:37:34,864 --> 00:37:36,297
It's a long story.

579
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:39,264
Shaniqua. Helga. Miss Kitty.

580
00:37:39,435 --> 00:37:41,596
Jeannie. I dream of...

581
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:45,634
Theresa.
This is Theresa right here.

582
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:49,642
- Now, is Theresa, is that your...
- Dirty girl.

583
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:55,149
This spot?
This spot is for my special lady, Lia.

584
00:37:55,985 --> 00:38:00,217
I'm gonna say that one more time.
Lia. Oh, yeah.

585
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:02,448
That's a sweet, sweet lady.

586
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,321
Tank! Are you polishing
your trophies again?

587
00:38:06,796 --> 00:38:11,130
Mom, I wasn't polishing.
I was talking to my friends.

588
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:14,498
I'm gonna be polishing later.

589
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:18,167
When's he coming out?
I'm running out of film.

590
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,636
Mr. Topanga! Could you
tell us why you're not dead?

591
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:25,110
No! I am dead! I'm dead.

592
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,518
What are you doing?

593
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,921
Hey, who said you...

594
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,754
Turn the board around.
Get back here.

595
00:38:38,928 --> 00:38:40,987
Come out here
and show me some moves.

596
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:42,528
- No, no.
- Come on!

597
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:46,362
- Grab a board and come out.
- You want to kill yourself, go ahead.

598
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:48,834
Fine with me.
Just don't mess up my board.

599
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:52,771
- How do you turn this thing?
- It's not a short board. Sit back on it.

600
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:54,432
Hey, watch the wave!

601
00:38:56,779 --> 00:39:00,078
You mess up my board,
I'm messing up your other foot.

602
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:04,481
I'm just trying to ride
this canoe or whatever it is, okay?

603
00:39:04,654 --> 00:39:08,181
Stop trying so hard! Just relax.

604
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:10,719
What do you mean, rela...?

605
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:15,527
Long, smooth strokes.

606
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:18,667
- Dig deep. Dig, come on.
- I'm digging!

607
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:22,362
Keep the nose up! Keep it up!
Watch it! You're pearling!

608
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:31,908
- What are you doing?
- Come on, please?

609
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:34,549
Z, I can't learn anything
with you on the beach.

610
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:37,584
Well, then you're not gonna
learn anything.

611
00:39:37,754 --> 00:39:40,917
- Now, come on in.
- I'm not coming in until you come out.

612
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,890
Oh, you're coming in, all right.
He's not even watching the wave.

613
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:47,355
- What wave?
- That one.

614
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,830
Five, four, three, two, and...

615
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:06,877
- Don't touch my stuff, man.
- I couldn't help it.

616
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,214
- I just wanted to learn from the best.
- Yeah, well.

617
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,981
- I don't surf anymore, okay?
- What?

618
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:15,784
What do you mean, you don't surf?

619
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,290
You want to learn
how to surf the right way?

620
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:19,894
Sure.

621
00:40:20,063 --> 00:40:22,896
Then you gotta make
your own board, all right?

622
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,730
- What do you mean, you don't sur...
- Can't hear you.

623
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:28,734
- Can I ask one question...
- We're making a board.

624
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,396
Could you tell me
about your board?

625
00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:35,203
I just have a palm tree board.

626
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:38,478
I would have to say it's not
the nicest board in the world...

627
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:40,582
...but it is a pretty good board.

628
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,548
The ancient Hawaiians believe
that "mana" or heart...

629
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,518
...was transferred into the surfboard
as you shaped it.

630
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:48,816
What are your thoughts on that?

631
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:52,290
What's up with the hair?
You could fit a whole fish in there.

632
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:54,987
My dream surfboard.
It's pretty powerful.

633
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:58,497
You can add a lot of attachments to it,
like a grenade launcher attachment.

634
00:40:58,668 --> 00:40:59,965
Anybody know whose board this is?

635
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:03,003
- I'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.
- Has anybody seen the chicken?

636
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:05,231
Cody!

637
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:09,272
I know he's out here.
I can feel it in my nuggets.

638
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:12,881
Aren't you nervous out here
in the jungle? It's kind of dangerous.

639
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:16,644
Dude, the jungle is the most
peaceful place on the planet.

640
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:25,722
- Hold it steady.
- This is a dream come true.

641
00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:29,023
This is a dream come true,
to be here with Z, doing this.

642
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:31,189
- And it's koa wood.
- Where's the...

643
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,335
All the best boards
are made from koa wood.

644
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:38,534
All right, now,
I drew this pattern as a guide.

645
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:43,441
Do you want to have your board
with a lot of rocker or just a little?

646
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,511
I don't know.

647
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,707
What you want is something
in-between. Trust me.

648
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:50,477
- I'm the expert here.
- Okay.

649
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:52,349
So...

650
00:41:52,722 --> 00:41:54,849
...here are your shaping tools.

651
00:41:55,291 --> 00:42:00,092
Now, remember, the board's
already inside there, see, somewhere.

652
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:03,596
And what you're doing
is you're trying to find it.

653
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:06,428
- Reveal it. All right?
- Okay.

654
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:10,305
Every carve counts.
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

655
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:14,466
- I'm not smiling. I'm excited.
- This isn't like hacking a piece of ice.

656
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:17,044
It takes patience and finesse.

657
00:42:17,213 --> 00:42:20,478
All right already. Can you just
give me the tools, please?

658
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,210
- Here, take it. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

659
00:42:24,153 --> 00:42:27,145
- Here we go.
- What are you doing?

660
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:30,550
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

661
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:33,889
All right, look.
First of all, with the grain.

662
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,156
With the grain.
You see what I'm doing here?

663
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,166
You let the tool do the work.
You see?

664
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:44,170
Just like you're riding a wave.
You let the wave do the work.

665
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,538
You don't fight the wave.
You can't fight these big waves.

666
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:52,977
Long strokes. Loads of finesse.

667
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,078
Find the board within the tree.

668
00:42:57,253 --> 00:43:00,347
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah, I got it.

669
00:43:00,523 --> 00:43:02,684
See that? You just...

670
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:05,183
- You just...
- Maybe I could do it now.

671
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:06,953
Move with...

672
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:10,524
- With the...
- Can I do it now?

673
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:13,893
Can I do it now?

674
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:20,465
Yeah. I got carried away.
Sorry about that.

675
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:22,668
- It's your board.
- My board.

676
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:25,137
Okay, with the grain. I got it.

677
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:27,544
Don't forget to eyeball it
once in a while.

678
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:31,380
- Long strokes, with the grain.
- Not too long.

679
00:43:31,554 --> 00:43:33,351
Here we go.

680
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:39,726
- You're doing it wrong.
- Will you just let me...

681
00:43:39,896 --> 00:43:43,127
I can't... No finesse
when you're in my face. Okay?

682
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:45,233
Just let me make the board.

683
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:48,131
- Do you want my help?
- No, I don't want your help.

684
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:49,635
I don't want your help.

685
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:51,773
- You don't want my help?
- I don't want your help.

686
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:55,001
- All right. Fine.
- I want to make my board.

687
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:58,738
- Build the board yourself, all right?
- Thank you.

688
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:02,214
I don't care what the board
looks like. You're the one...

689
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:05,354
...who's got to ride the thing.
- Fine. Thank you.

690
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:10,721
- It's in there somewhere.
- Walk over there, please! Please.

691
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,457
Don't cut yourself.

692
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:16,322
So it's day three, yeah?

693
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:20,759
I come across Pen Guans.

694
00:44:20,937 --> 00:44:24,373
I'm Chicken Joe. Joseph.
It's long for Joe.

695
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:26,101
Sweet, man.

696
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:30,541
And they treat me as their king
and put me in a hot tub.

697
00:44:31,113 --> 00:44:33,741
It is, I guess, their royal hot tub.

698
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:51,428
It got kind of hot and steamy.

699
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:54,159
But really opened up
my pores, you know?

700
00:44:56,372 --> 00:44:57,669
It was kind of cool.

701
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,536
They served me food
while I was in there.

702
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:03,405
It was like dinner and a show.

703
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:17,586
As enjoyable as it was,
I still had a vision of my quest.

704
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:23,563
Thank you. See you guys later.
I gotta get going.

705
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:26,925
Not again.

706
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:31,164
You know what else it was?
I had the board.

707
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,035
The board was fine.
The board was great.

708
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:39,439
- How's it going?
- It's going great, man. It's great.

709
00:45:39,915 --> 00:45:41,405
It did look a little rough.

710
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:44,985
A little rough? The board looked
a little... It's a work in progress, bro.

711
00:45:45,154 --> 00:45:47,054
You think it's good enough
for the big waves?

712
00:45:47,223 --> 00:45:50,624
I think it's good enough
for any wave.

713
00:45:52,094 --> 00:45:53,584
Hang on.

714
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:58,923
- Okay, let's say I'm a big wave.
- Hold on. No, no, no, no.

715
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,932
- Hey, where you...
- Hold on!

716
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:03,799
- Where are you going?
- It's my board, man, all right?

717
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:06,942
Why don't you take your board
and go try it out?

718
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:10,704
Maybe I will. Piece of junk. Watch!

719
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:17,180
Nice ride, man.
Nice ride.

720
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:20,387
This is supposed to be fun.

721
00:46:20,556 --> 00:46:24,287
I got three days until the contest.
I don't have time for fun.

722
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:27,293
No time for fun, huh?

723
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:28,930
- Hey, Cody!
- What?

724
00:46:29,098 --> 00:46:31,896
Bring me some clams
when you come back!

725
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:34,764
I'm not coming back!

726
00:46:34,937 --> 00:46:37,405
- He'll be back.
- No, I won't!

727
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:39,165
He'll be back.

728
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:41,735
- You guys like barbecue?
- Yeah, sure.

729
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:43,469
Got some wood here.

730
00:46:44,313 --> 00:46:47,749
I wasted my whole day and I have
nothing to show for it, which is...

731
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:56,682
- I was just going to check on you...
- That's why you were...

732
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,156
...and the Geek.

733
00:46:58,327 --> 00:47:01,626
- Listen. The Geek is Big Z.
- What?

734
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:03,025
- I know.
- You know?

735
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,133
- How did you find out?
- We went to the beach.

736
00:47:05,301 --> 00:47:06,529
- You got him to the beach?
- Yeah.

737
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:09,330
I've been trying to get Z
out of that tree for 10 years...

738
00:47:09,505 --> 00:47:11,871
...and you got him all the way
down to the beach in one day?

739
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,565
This is fantastic!

740
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:20,975
It's amazing!
Do you want to go somewhere fun?

741
00:47:21,183 --> 00:47:26,018
Do you want to go somewhere
really, really fun?

742
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:28,816
Unless you want...
Did you want to get back to Big Z?

743
00:47:28,991 --> 00:47:31,357
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have invited you.
- No, no, no.

744
00:47:31,527 --> 00:47:34,462
- What? Okay. No?
- No, look. I want to have fun.

745
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,894
- Okay.
- Do I need mints or something?

746
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:40,035
- You tell me.
- No, you won't need mints.

747
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:44,569
Z used to carry us up here on his
shoulders. We'd have so much fun.

748
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,368
- It's one of my favorite spots.
- Really?

749
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:50,477
- Boy, to be 8 years old again.
- What is this?

750
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:52,637
You don't want to
get all cut up, do you?

751
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:54,146
Hold on. What are you doing?

752
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:56,580
No, no, no. I'm out of here.
I'm better off...

753
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:10,088
It's going down! No, no, no!

754
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:18,464
- This is insane!
- Stop fighting it, Cody! Just let go!

755
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:22,203
All right!

756
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:29,311
Now I'm in front of you.
What's going on now?

757
00:48:29,485 --> 00:48:30,975
It's not a race!

758
00:48:39,762 --> 00:48:42,663
Okay, wait, don't take the left...
Cody!

759
00:48:47,336 --> 00:48:51,363
- Give up, slowpoke! It's over with now!
- Not for long!

760
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:53,902
Give up now, sucker!

761
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,413
- I beat you!
- Congratulations, you sure did.

762
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:03,142
You should probably
get out of there.

763
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:05,583
Why is that? This stuff is...
Look at me. It's so beautiful.

764
00:49:05,754 --> 00:49:07,346
Look at it. What is this stuff?

765
00:49:07,523 --> 00:49:10,356
See those things up above you?
They're glowworms.

766
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:14,986
So you're right beneath them.
Yeah, that's poop.

767
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:28,773
You know how some stinks stink
and other stinks smell good?

768
00:49:28,944 --> 00:49:31,208
- Yeah.
- This is, like, a good stink.

769
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,369
A good stink?

770
00:49:33,048 --> 00:49:34,777
Can I tell you something personal?

771
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,214
We're in the shower together.
You can say whatever you want.

772
00:49:37,386 --> 00:49:41,823
I'm serious. I'm really, really
jealous of you.

773
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:43,117
Why?

774
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:47,160
I couldn't get Z off his butt
for the last 10 years...

775
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:49,854
...and then you come along and...

776
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:52,796
He must really think a lot of you.

777
00:49:52,968 --> 00:49:56,529
I don't know. I've been a jerk to him.
I don't know what he thinks.

778
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,798
- You haven't.
- I have. I've been a jerk.

779
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:03,542
- I have.
- Then go not be a jerk.

780
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:05,976
What does it matter to you anyways?

781
00:50:06,148 --> 00:50:08,844
He's my uncle.
He's the only family I've got.

782
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:19,492
Okay.

783
00:51:21,924 --> 00:51:23,653
Z? No.

784
00:51:24,326 --> 00:51:28,592
No, no, no, don't you do it.
Z, don't do it. No.

785
00:51:28,764 --> 00:51:30,629
- No.
- Let's see here.

786
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:32,664
- I swear...
- It's stronger than I thought.

787
00:51:32,835 --> 00:51:36,168
...if you break it...
- Should've been broken by now.

788
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:39,000
Come on! Come on!

789
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:44,439
Look at that.

790
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:49,677
That's the best place
in the world to be, in the tube.

791
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:50,876
Really?

792
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:55,456
Yeah. Better than winning,
the trophy, all that stuff.

793
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,658
Tube riding
is the ultimate thing in surfing...

794
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,023
...to ride inside the wave
and make it out of it.

795
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:03,789
It's all we want to do every day.

796
00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:06,901
It's almost impossible to describe.

797
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:09,003
There's nothing I can compare it to.

798
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:13,631
It's a feeling that not too many people
will experience...

799
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:15,804
...so it's special in that sense.

800
00:52:15,978 --> 00:52:17,343
Then you try to remember it.

801
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,448
Like, "I wish I could remember that,"
or "I wish I could get that again."

802
00:52:20,616 --> 00:52:22,277
It's so addicting.

803
00:52:22,651 --> 00:52:26,485
Once you get inside
you never want to get out.

804
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:32,149
- Wow. That's amazing.
- Yeah, man. Nothing like it.

805
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:37,822
So, that aside, how many points
would you get for getting tubed?

806
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,331
Like, what does it depend on
for the contest?

807
00:52:40,502 --> 00:52:42,732
- Points?
- What?

808
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:45,429
You know who you
sound like right now?

809
00:52:45,607 --> 00:52:47,370
I promote happiness!

810
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:51,172
Can you see the happiness emanating
from me? What's wrong with you?

811
00:52:51,346 --> 00:52:53,177
- We're live.
- Good. Good.

812
00:52:53,348 --> 00:52:57,648
I have to say, I have no doubt
that this year's Big Z Memorial...

813
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,151
...is gonna be the best ever.

814
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:03,047
With the competition
just one day away...

815
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:07,719
...the excitement is definitely building
here on Pen Gu Island.

816
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:31,450
That didn't take too long.
I feel lightheaded.

817
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,848
So get this.

818
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:37,249
On my search for Cody,
I bump into my hot tub buddies again.

819
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,789
I get it. You guys look hungry.

820
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:44,194
You've probably got
the munchies or something.

821
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,532
Squidito on el stickito?

822
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:02,215
Check it out! Dude,
have you seen my friend Cody?

823
00:54:02,384 --> 00:54:05,114
He's kind of like a penguin.

824
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:08,381
He's got a lot of black on him,
a lot of white.

825
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:12,049
- How did you learn how to surf?
- I saw Big Z do it, actually.

826
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:14,127
I don't think you were born yet.

827
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,696
- I wasn't?
- No, I don't think so.

828
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:21,732
Lani? I like her when
she teaches us because...

829
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:23,633
Smudge! Not another one!

830
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:26,330
I think he really has to go
to the bathroom right now.

831
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:28,704
What's next? The board is done.

832
00:54:28,877 --> 00:54:30,777
- The board is done?
- The board is done.

833
00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:34,848
- Well, let's do some training.
- Finally!

834
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:38,277
- Can we get a shot of you...
- You've got to get it in a long shot.

835
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:41,812
Hey, Z! Come on!

836
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:43,924
- Where you going?
- I thought we were going to train.

837
00:54:44,092 --> 00:54:47,550
Not in the water. Jeez.
What are you thinking?

838
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:52,092
- You want to surf like Big Z used to?
- Yeah.

839
00:54:52,267 --> 00:54:54,963
I've got some tests here
to figure out your potential.

840
00:54:55,137 --> 00:54:57,662
- Let's do it.
- No, put them on your eyes.

841
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,330
- Like this.
- On my eyes.

842
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:06,071
- Take it, Cody.
- Can we do some training, seriously?

843
00:55:06,248 --> 00:55:08,375
What are you talking about?
What do you think we're doing?

844
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,575
Acting like nutjobs.
That's what I think we're doing.

845
00:55:10,752 --> 00:55:13,152
Yeah, good. You're learning!

846
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:15,347
And a big set comes in.

847
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:19,421
Wipeout!

848
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:21,661
- That's it!
- Take it easy!

849
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:23,722
This is getting ridiculous.

850
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:25,332
- You having fun?
- I hate you.

851
00:55:26,435 --> 00:55:27,868
Big, you know, slow:

852
00:55:29,771 --> 00:55:32,865
He does this flip over the top.
All right, now you go.

853
00:55:34,977 --> 00:55:37,878
No joy, man. No joy. Fail.

854
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:43,511
I'm starting to see it, man. I think
I know what you're talking about.

855
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:47,513
That's great. As long as
we're all having fun, right?

856
00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:51,987
Z, wake up. Wake up, Z. Z!

857
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:02,570
Hey, Z, breakfast!

858
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,938
Not a chance.

859
00:56:06,274 --> 00:56:09,869
- Four, three, two...
- You gotta get up early in the morning...

860
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:11,537
...one.

861
00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:21,478
That is fun.

862
00:56:21,657 --> 00:56:24,592
- You're having fun?
- I am. Yes. Now I am.

863
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,354
Then, Cody...

864
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:28,189
...you passed!
- What?

865
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:30,854
You did it! You're ready! Let's surf!

866
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:35,561
Don't play me, Z. We're surfing?
Yes! Yes!

867
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:47,715
Hey, check it...

868
00:56:54,423 --> 00:56:56,550
I didn't know you could surf!

869
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:04,026
Relax!

870
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:07,896
Long, slow, smooth.

871
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,901
- Like making the board!
- There you go.

872
00:57:10,072 --> 00:57:13,007
- All right. Okay.
- Feels good, yeah?

873
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:29,088
- You're in the water, Z!
- Come on out. Get wet! Come on!

874
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:37,259
Lani, thank you.

875
00:57:43,171 --> 00:57:44,934
Look at that!

876
00:57:58,053 --> 00:58:01,716
- Nice! That's it! Nice.
- Great ride!

877
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:28,879
Big Z is back!

878
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:42,663
This is what it's all about.

879
00:58:43,465 --> 00:58:45,990
What could be better than this?

880
00:59:12,861 --> 00:59:15,455
I need some help
on this landing for the high note

881
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:22,766
Nice. Nice.

882
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:25,231
- Is that the only song that you know?
- Pretty much.

883
00:59:25,407 --> 00:59:27,875
You want to hear it again?
It goes like this.

884
00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:30,771
No? Okay. I got you there, didn't I?

885
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:34,609
I must say you were
quite amazing out there today.

886
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,547
- You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo.
- Thanks to this guy.

887
00:59:38,386 --> 00:59:42,948
- I just pointed you in a direction.
- Question, Z.

888
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,150
- Change your mind about the song?
- No, no, no.

889
00:59:46,328 --> 00:59:47,795
Here, it goes something like this...

890
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:50,693
I was wondering if you could come
watch me ride tomorrow.

891
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,700
Yeah, yeah. We'll both ride, man.

892
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,534
- No, not just... In the contest.
- Contest? What contest?

893
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,903
The Big Z Memorial.
Remember that one?

894
01:00:02,077 --> 01:00:03,704
I know I'm asking a lot...

895
01:00:03,879 --> 01:00:06,279
...but it would really, really be...

896
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:09,576
...the biggest thing in the world
to me if you could come.

897
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:14,486
- You still want to be a part of that?
- Absolutely.

898
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:19,516
- Why do you want me there anyway?
- I thought you'd want to be there.

899
01:00:19,694 --> 01:00:22,663
- I don't know why it's a big deal.
- It's no big deal.

900
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:24,761
Why won't you come?

901
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,262
- I'm not coming.
- Why?

902
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:28,231
- Give it a rest.
- It's getting cold, guys.

903
01:00:28,403 --> 01:00:29,961
- Tell me why you're hiding.
- Hiding?

904
01:00:30,138 --> 01:00:32,504
- Why are you hiding?
- I'll have to eat all this by myself.

905
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,801
Why didn't you come back
after you fell off the wave?

906
01:00:35,877 --> 01:00:38,004
That wave.

907
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:44,979
That last day, winning had
become everything to me.

908
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,947
I knew I was gonna beat Tank.

909
01:00:48,256 --> 01:00:54,422
But then, you know,
he starts to surf circles around me.

910
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:57,656
I saw what he was doing.
I couldn't do what he was doing.

911
01:00:58,466 --> 01:01:00,764
Times had changed.

912
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,703
I didn't want to walk back
on that beach with all my fans there.

913
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:09,333
A loser. Everyone looking
at Big Z, the loser, the has-been.

914
01:01:09,911 --> 01:01:11,572
So...

915
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:22,722
Big Z's dead,
and that's how it's gonna stay.

916
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:25,519
Let me play you that song.

917
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:29,697
What about "never give up"?
What about "find a way"?

918
01:01:30,031 --> 01:01:34,968
- You're giving up. You're giving up!
- Yeah, I'm giving up. That's my way.

919
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:38,702
- Giving up.
- I thought you were the one guy.

920
01:01:38,873 --> 01:01:41,842
You don't like it, find your own way.

921
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:45,135
Leave me out of it.

922
01:01:45,947 --> 01:01:47,539
Leave me out of it.

923
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,601
I messed up.
I'm just...

924
01:02:17,812 --> 01:02:19,803
I'm... not good.

925
01:02:20,215 --> 01:02:22,945
This is when I needed someone.
I needed him.

926
01:02:23,985 --> 01:02:26,886
It's hard enough
losing one dad, but...

927
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:30,390
- What do you mean by...?
- Nothing.

928
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:32,890
Nothing, man. Forget it.

929
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:49,773
Peaceful. Peaceful.
I'm in peace. I come in peace.

930
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,138
- Cody!
- Joe!

931
01:02:51,546 --> 01:02:54,845
- I've been looking everywhere for you!
- You've been looking for me?

932
01:02:55,016 --> 01:02:57,849
I didn't lose you on the whale.
I'm not gonna lose you now.

933
01:02:58,019 --> 01:03:01,455
- Thank you. Seriously, thank you.
- Radical.

934
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:06,159
They're starting!
Cody, we gotta go! Come on!

935
01:03:06,361 --> 01:03:07,828
Wait a minute. Joe?

936
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,088
Surfers riding...

937
01:03:09,264 --> 01:03:12,290
I'm sorry. Watch this, dude.
I can speak their language.

938
01:03:16,204 --> 01:03:19,401
I totally need my board. I don't
know where it is. I gotta go find it.

939
01:03:19,574 --> 01:03:21,769
- I'll see you in the lineup.
- See you, Joe.

940
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:24,468
- This is gonna be fun, huh?
- See you.

941
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:29,778
The tenth annual Big Z
is about to get underway...

942
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:32,749
...and, whoa, it is the day of days.

943
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:36,118
Big mountainous bombs
marching into our coastline.

944
01:03:36,424 --> 01:03:40,053
Kelly Slater, on a danger level,
one to ten, give me a number.

945
01:03:40,228 --> 01:03:41,217
Twenty.

946
01:03:41,396 --> 01:03:43,421
- Wow. Rob?
- There'll be blood.

947
01:03:43,598 --> 01:03:45,532
I'm scared, and I'm in the booth!

948
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,662
- What are you doing here?
- Mike.

949
01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:51,101
You're gonna kill yourself.
Don't do this to yourself.

950
01:03:51,272 --> 01:03:52,603
Look what happened last time.

951
01:03:53,308 --> 01:03:55,572
- It's good to see you back.
- Are you serious?

952
01:03:55,743 --> 01:03:57,267
You're gonna be
a real crowd pleaser.

953
01:03:57,445 --> 01:03:59,777
I'm telling you,
these people are gonna eat you up.

954
01:03:59,948 --> 01:04:03,440
- I'll be expecting big things from you.
- Thank you.

955
01:04:03,618 --> 01:04:05,848
People, big announcement.
Cody Maverick, he's back.

956
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,351
The Wipeout King is back...

957
01:04:07,522 --> 01:04:09,615
...and I'm gonna tell you,
start looking for the sharks.

958
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,850
They'll be circling because
there's gonna be blood.

959
01:04:12,026 --> 01:04:13,459
Spectacular carnage today.

960
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:17,564
Thank you! Reggie Belafonte. Little
guy, big hair, big thoughts, big heart.

961
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:30,400
Look at this.
You're going down, snowflake.

962
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:34,810
I'm gonna make you wish
you were never even hatched.

963
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:38,475
You want to see my trophies?

964
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:49,927
Arnold, no.

965
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:58,929
About 24 surfers
battling their way out to the...

966
01:04:59,974 --> 01:05:02,772
Good golly! Make that 18.

967
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,447
Rob, after such a heavy wipeout
earlier in the week...

968
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:10,641
...what do you think is going
through Maverick's mind?

969
01:05:10,818 --> 01:05:14,811
He's gonna have to stay focused and
channel that energy into good places.

970
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:16,784
When are you gonna get a life?

971
01:05:19,194 --> 01:05:20,957
You are a nobody.

972
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,460
You should've stayed
in Antarctica, kid.

973
01:05:49,023 --> 01:05:51,890
He made it! Yeah, good.

974
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,928
What an amazing first ride
mind-blower from Maverick.

975
01:06:01,636 --> 01:06:03,297
Did you guys see that?

976
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:06,565
Man. I thought I was gonna lose it,
and then I just...

977
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:10,710
I just let go, you know.
I let go, and there it was.

978
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,642
Wow, it's been an amazing day...

979
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:16,807
...of shredding in less than
stellar conditions...

980
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:19,920
...but I never would have guessed
our three finalists.

981
01:06:20,088 --> 01:06:22,215
Well, Sal, it's no surprise
that Tank Evans...

982
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,484
...has just breezed his way
into the finals.

983
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:29,960
And Cody Maverick, from a horrible
wipeout a few days ago to this.

984
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:35,564
And Chicken Joe from Sheboygan.
Who would have guessed it?

985
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:39,503
I have never seen a finals like this.

986
01:06:40,642 --> 01:06:43,270
- We're in the finals, Joe.
- No way! We get to surf some more?

987
01:06:43,444 --> 01:06:46,777
Isn't it exciting?
Look at that. This is great, huh?

988
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:50,381
You know, you should know this.
The Tank loves you.

989
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:53,720
Looks like this will be
the easiest year ever.

990
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:57,815
No way. Cody, did you hear that?
It's gonna be easy.

991
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,221
Are you loving this?

992
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:05,565
So who would you like
to see win the trophy?

993
01:07:05,733 --> 01:07:08,327
It's not so important to me.

994
01:07:08,503 --> 01:07:11,165
Friends are better than anything
in the world.

995
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:12,533
Friends are forever.

996
01:07:13,174 --> 01:07:16,473
Trophies, you never know
what they can have happen to them.

997
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:20,578
- That was awesome, mate.
- Muy impresivo, my friend.

998
01:07:20,748 --> 01:07:22,079
Thank you, bro. Thanks.

999
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,249
- Finals.
- Hey!

1000
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:27,081
Yeah. I know. I can't even...

1001
01:07:28,022 --> 01:07:30,684
I think I can win this thing.
It's too much right now.

1002
01:07:30,858 --> 01:07:33,349
- Well, that's all you came for.
- What?

1003
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,622
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You made it pretty clear last night...

1004
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:38,857
...that winning's more important
to you than Z or me.

1005
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:41,433
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take
your stupid trophy home.

1006
01:07:41,602 --> 01:07:44,002
- Lani. Come on.
- Come here, you!

1007
01:07:44,472 --> 01:07:45,803
How about this, huh?

1008
01:07:45,973 --> 01:07:51,036
Let me tell you something. You win
this thing, we're going places!

1009
01:07:51,245 --> 01:07:54,146
Look at this kid.
He is a champ!

1010
01:08:03,725 --> 01:08:07,889
Tank, nine-time defending champion.
He will roll on you.

1011
01:08:08,062 --> 01:08:11,554
Expect him to win this thing. It's
basically a contest for second place.

1012
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:16,397
First, I'm gonna take you down.
Then I'm gonna fry the chicken.

1013
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:21,474
That cloud looks just like a kitten.

1014
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:36,786
Maverick and Evans take off.

1015
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:38,516
Mine!

1016
01:08:38,693 --> 01:08:41,025
And it's Evans dropping in.

1017
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:46,790
And Tank's playing games,
blocking Maverick's every move.

1018
01:08:47,735 --> 01:08:49,259
Maverick sticks a rail.

1019
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:55,170
Tank Evans down!
I have never, ever seen this before!

1020
01:08:57,145 --> 01:08:58,635
But I'd love to see it again.

1021
01:08:58,813 --> 01:09:02,442
Cody trying to take back the wave
that Tank snaked from him.

1022
01:09:02,617 --> 01:09:04,915
Evans toying with him,
not paying attention.

1023
01:09:05,086 --> 01:09:07,316
And there's the outside rail.
Evans goes down.

1024
01:09:07,488 --> 01:09:12,016
And it's Maverick with this new-school
move. We'll call it "The Maverick."

1025
01:09:17,832 --> 01:09:20,995
And look at this.
Maverick scoring big.

1026
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:26,506
Oh, it's so cute.
It's got little paws and the whiskers.

1027
01:09:29,477 --> 01:09:32,310
Chicken Joe
with a no-paddle drop-in!

1028
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:36,814
- Here we go!
- Nobody needs to help this chicken.

1029
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:39,080
I'm flying!

1030
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:45,756
Maverick and Joe tied, and no score
for Tank Evans? Unbelievable.

1031
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:51,229
Surfers, this is your final wave!

1032
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:55,733
- Joe, this is it. This wave wins it.
- Yeah, man!

1033
01:09:57,738 --> 01:10:02,072
This wave is stacking up
to be a beautiful tube.

1034
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,941
Maverick should score big
on this one!

1035
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:10,114
But wait! Evans drops in.

1036
01:10:10,284 --> 01:10:13,879
It looks like Evans
is gonna take out the chicken.

1037
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:20,624
What's Maverick doing?

1038
01:10:20,795 --> 01:10:23,696
- Go, Joe, go!
- Got it! Let's go!

1039
01:10:23,865 --> 01:10:26,766
I don't believe this.
This contest was Maverick's to win.

1040
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:30,699
Now Evans pushing Maverick out
of bounds and into The Boneyards.

1041
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:46,250
- Tank, look out!
- You look out!

1042
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:22,611
Code!

1043
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:26,148
Z!

1044
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:32,198
- Cody, come on.
- Z!

1045
01:11:32,366 --> 01:11:36,132
Paddle! Come on! Dig! Faster!
Come on. Dig!

1046
01:11:37,371 --> 01:11:39,771
Don't dig! Don't dig!

1047
01:11:39,941 --> 01:11:41,033
What?

1048
01:11:41,709 --> 01:11:44,234
Let the wave carry you!

1049
01:11:44,879 --> 01:11:46,540
You're gonna have to time it!

1050
01:11:47,081 --> 01:11:50,209
You're gonna come right here,
right to me!

1051
01:11:53,754 --> 01:11:55,745
Five... four...

1052
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,584
Three... two... one.

1053
01:12:03,664 --> 01:12:05,131
Z!

1054
01:12:20,414 --> 01:12:21,972
Where's Cody?

1055
01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:28,413
Don't touch it! Don't touch that!

1056
01:12:28,589 --> 01:12:31,683
This is a reminder
of the young surfer...

1057
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:36,922
...who gave his life
for the sport he loved.

1058
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:42,932
There you are.

1059
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:51,007
I can't believe it! I can't believe it.

1060
01:12:52,213 --> 01:12:53,544
You came back.

1061
01:12:54,048 --> 01:12:56,710
You saved my life, man.
Thank you.

1062
01:12:56,884 --> 01:13:00,251
Hey, hey, come on.
You're gonna tip us!

1063
01:13:02,089 --> 01:13:04,717
Well, I lost.

1064
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,089
Me too.

1065
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:13,223
Come on. Let's go, loser.

1066
01:13:14,068 --> 01:13:15,433
You want to help me out here?

1067
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:20,734
You know the routine. Come on. Long.
That's it. Smooth, you know. Come on.

1068
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:26,069
Young Joey MacEnroe
was a beacon for a new generation.

1069
01:13:26,247 --> 01:13:29,216
May he rest in peace.

1070
01:13:31,118 --> 01:13:34,178
So, what am I bid for the board?
Who'll give me 30? 30, come on.

1071
01:13:34,355 --> 01:13:36,516
- Don't touch his stuff, man.
- Pal, if you want to bid...

1072
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:38,886
- Give me that.
- Hey...!

1073
01:13:44,632 --> 01:13:46,361
Hey. Hey, everyone.

1074
01:13:47,368 --> 01:13:49,666
- How you been?
- Oh, my gosh!

1075
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:52,031
- Yeah...
- Hey, man, that's Z.

1076
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:53,797
...that's me.

1077
01:13:53,974 --> 01:13:56,204
Skank, what's happening, man?

1078
01:13:56,377 --> 01:13:59,039
Got a little sand
in your egg sac there, fella.

1079
01:13:59,213 --> 01:14:01,545
- Where have you been, Z?
- What happened?

1080
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:03,747
Oh, you know...

1081
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:10,714
...I got lost for a little while.
But that kid there, Cody...

1082
01:14:11,926 --> 01:14:14,759
...he pointed the way back.

1083
01:14:25,606 --> 01:14:27,801
Could you please shut that off?
Could you give me a minute?

1084
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,115
Check it out! How about this?

1085
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:38,751
You want to talk about talent scout?
People find talent.

1086
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:44,619
I bring them back from the dead.
The now living legend, ladies and...

1087
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:46,123
- Shut up.
- What? Shut up?

1088
01:14:46,293 --> 01:14:50,286
I'm not a legend. I'm a guy looking for
some nice waves, some good friends.

1089
01:14:50,798 --> 01:14:54,427
Hey, guys, the swell is happening
over on the north shore!

1090
01:14:54,602 --> 01:14:55,967
I'm right behind you, Z.

1091
01:14:56,137 --> 01:14:57,468
Ouch, that hurt.

1092
01:14:59,607 --> 01:15:03,873
Come back here!
You don't just walk away! Come on!

1093
01:15:05,246 --> 01:15:06,611
He's taking this loss pretty hard.

1094
01:15:06,781 --> 01:15:09,750
Tank, how does it feel
to lose after nine time...

1095
01:15:11,385 --> 01:15:14,616
I wasn't kissing her.
You can't have her!

1096
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,148
Can we get a few words?

1097
01:15:19,326 --> 01:15:21,988
You gave up the trophy to help Joe.
What's that about?

1098
01:15:22,163 --> 01:15:25,064
You know, Rob,
that's what friends do.

1099
01:15:25,232 --> 01:15:28,360
- How's it feel to win, Joe?
- I won?

1100
01:15:28,536 --> 01:15:31,835
Come on! I'll tell my mom.
Gimme. Gimme!

1101
01:15:33,507 --> 01:15:36,374
Oh, Lia! Oh, Lia.

1102
01:15:36,544 --> 01:15:40,139
Don't you walk away from me!
I am Reggie Belafon...

1103
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:45,176
Turn that thing off.
Mikey! You are so fired!

1104
01:15:45,786 --> 01:15:48,414
I can't imagine a better day.

1105
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:58,588
Dude, this... This whole
experience has just been...

1106
01:15:58,799 --> 01:16:01,700
It's amazing. Z?

1107
01:16:01,869 --> 01:16:06,772
I don't think I've ever had
a better friend to me in my life.

1108
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:10,604
It's just really cool
to have everything I need.

1109
01:16:11,478 --> 01:16:13,946
- Don't do it. Help!
- Arnold!

1110
01:16:14,114 --> 01:16:17,515
To be honest, man, I'm kind of, like,
bored of talking about myself.

1111
01:16:17,685 --> 01:16:21,348
So, is that cool?
You guys got what you need?

1112
01:16:21,522 --> 01:16:23,820
- We got it.
- All right. Be good!

1113
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:33,957
Cowabunga!

1114
01:17:42,002 --> 01:17:43,936
Of course we're proud of him!

1115
01:17:44,104 --> 01:17:45,935
What mother wouldn't be
proud of him?

1116
01:17:46,106 --> 01:17:48,370
We're so full of proudness.

1117
01:17:48,542 --> 01:17:50,442
You know what?
He followed his dream...

1118
01:17:50,611 --> 01:17:54,377
...and he went out there, and now
he's coming home with the trophy.

1119
01:17:54,548 --> 01:17:56,539
I can't wait to see his trophy.

1120
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:58,708
There's not really a trophy.

1121
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:01,887
Is there, like, a big shell
or something like that?

1122
01:18:02,056 --> 01:18:04,786
There's no shell. There's no trophy.
Well, he didn't win.

1123
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:05,983
What?

1124
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,352
How bad was it?
Did he get smoked?

1125
01:18:09,563 --> 01:18:12,726
- He was in the finals.
- Second place? That's losing.

1126
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,232
- Winning is not everything, Glen.
- Right.

1127
01:18:15,402 --> 01:18:16,892
Look at what Cody did...

1128
01:18:17,071 --> 01:18:19,232
Go back to the
"winning isn't everything" thing.

1129
01:18:19,473 --> 01:18:21,737
That doesn't compute, really.

1130
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:27,404
You know what, Glen? I really hope
someday you can be more like Cody.

1131
01:18:27,881 --> 01:18:29,348
This interview is over.

1132
01:25:00,506 --> 01:25:02,906
Remember when were talking
about you leaving? That was great.

1133
01:25:03,076 --> 01:25:04,703
Remember when
you were gonna go?

1134
01:25:04,878 --> 01:25:06,903
- We were gonna go...
- You should still go.

1135
01:25:07,146 --> 01:25:08,204
It's technical equipment.

1136
01:25:08,381 --> 01:25:12,374
I know what I'm doing. I can unplug
one of your little Hollywood devices.

1137
01:25:12,886 --> 01:25:15,184
The lighting thing,
