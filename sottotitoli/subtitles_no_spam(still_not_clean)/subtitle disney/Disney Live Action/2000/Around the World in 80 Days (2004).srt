1
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,330
To the Bank of England! Quickly!

2
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:18,890
Surround the building!

3
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:21,571
You go that way! You go this way!

4
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:31,761
There he is!

5
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,818
- Come on!
- After him, men!

6
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:02,276
That way!

7
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:29,366
- He came this way. I'm sure of it.
- Come on!

8
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:31,857
Come on, mates! Keep up!

9
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,584
Sorry, sir.

10
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:04,144
Today is the day I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible.

11
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:08,207
Man can break
the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.

12
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:11,743
And you're lucky
to be a part of it, Pierre.

13
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:14,265
- It's Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.

14
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:17,947
We will make history.
Or we will die trying.

15
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:21,408
- Die?
- This is very exciting.

16
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:24,770
That's it!
I refuse to be catapulted,

17
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:29,036
electrocuted, or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

18
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,824
I quit!

19
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:37,698
He is a very sick man!

20
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:43,194
The electrocution was not my fault!

21
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:46,495
You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

22
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:48,642
We're looking for a bank robber.

23
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,839
Is there no man brave enough
to be my valet?

24
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,145
Oh... Aah!

25
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,454
I'm your new valet.

26
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:05,313
Uh... I must commend
the valet service

27
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,723
on their impeccable foresight.

28
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:10,986
But they know I only
accept French valets.

29
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,092
Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!

30
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:17,806
I come from a long line
of French valets.

31
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:20,583
On my father's side.
Very, very French.

32
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,110
- But your accent.
- My father French. Never speak.

33
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:30,192
My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.

34
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,668
Very well.

35
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:37,741
Will you be willing to risk your life
to challenge the laws of physics?

36
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:42,293
- Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent. Pop this little hat on.

37
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,490
- He's got to be in here.
- He's this way!

38
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:53,960
And the throttle in your
right hand controls the speed.

39
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:02,487
- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!

40
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:21,808
Uh-uh-uh...

41
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:27,208
Twenty-five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.

42
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,413
We need more speed, man.

43
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:33,973
Waah! Wee-yoo!

44
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:37,355
Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.

45
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:45,153
Forty-seven.

46
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:46,812
Forty-eight.

47
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:48,675
Forty-nine.

48
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,709
Eureka! We've done it!

49
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:00,674
Uh...

50
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:02,750
Waaah!

51
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:05,257
I say, I say. Uh, good morning.

52
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:09,050
- I'm looking for a man with...
- Over here!

53
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,999
There he is. There's my valet.

54
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:16,550
Sorry! New valet.

55
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,162
Whoa!

56
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:32,078
Whoa!

57
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,400
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

58
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:40,310
You'll be able to let go any second.

59
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,034
The pack will run out of steam

60
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:46,429
in exactly three, two, one.

61
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,370
Now.

62
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,686
Look out!

63
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:56,735
- That was incredible!
- We've broken the human speed barrier.

64
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,825
Good-bye, sir.

65
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,873
It's been very nice valeting for you.

66
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:07,659
Let's... do it again soon.

67
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,175
Please, wait!

68
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:12,237
With you as my brave valet,
I can test all my inventions.

69
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,487
No!

70
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,461
Spread out!

71
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:17,885
- Cover that...
- Yes, yes.

72
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,727
- I take the job.
- Splendid!

73
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:23,150
I can't wait to present
my results to the Academy.

74
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:28,483
Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.

75
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:33,194
And with this grant to develop
new applications for copper wire,

76
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:36,657
Dr. Ramsey invented this.

77
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,253
Needless to say,
the Royal Academy of Science

78
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:47,178
declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent,

79
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,432
and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum.

80
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:56,530
Sir. I have an urgent
announcement for you. Here.

81
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,268
Don't just stand there. Read it.

82
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,393
Oh. Um...

83
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:05,034
"It is with great distress

84
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,843
that Scotland Yard announces

85
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,678
that the Bank of England...
has been robbed."

86
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:15,911
My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!

87
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:19,616
You gave me every assurance that
the Bank of England was impenetrable!

88
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:22,325
Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."

89
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:25,191
It's the same thing, you idiot!

90
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:29,433
Please, please, not the quills!

91
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:31,470
Lord Salisbury!

92
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:35,447
Please contact General Fang
and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.

93
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:39,396
To forgo your obligation would
be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.

94
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:43,079
A woman in the Royal Academy?

95
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:46,841
The Jade Buddha was delivered
by us to the Bank of England.

96
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:51,125
- What happens while in British hands...
- Is absolutely your concern.

97
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:54,685
Colonel Kitchner,
chief of Scotland Yard,

98
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:56,216
please inform General Fang

99
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:58,829
what other items were stolen
from the bank.

100
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,328
Nothing else.

101
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:05,844
Exactly. It seems
your little land dispute

102
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:09,052
has spilled over
onto our noble shore.

103
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:11,643
Until the Jade Buddha
is back in my possession,

104
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:16,942
you and your cause will receive no
British military assistance whatsoever.

105
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,488
Kitchner.

106
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:26,109
My agents will retrieve the Jade
Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.

107
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:29,633
This time, do not let it
slip through your fingers.

108
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:49,282
A female general.

109
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,560
What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

110
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:58,445
Cor!

111
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,214
- Come away from here.
- Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?

112
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,753
My wind-powered pulley system

113
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,340
circulates the house with fresh air.

114
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:18,391
Kitchen items are to be placed
on the white boat,

115
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,958
and the blue is for laundry.

116
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,396
But most importantly,
this supplies the house

117
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:26,693
with a running current of electricity.

118
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,858
Electricity.

119
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:34,639
This is my comprehensive
data schedule and list of regulations.

120
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:38,617
It's quite simple. You're never
to divert one iota from my plans.

121
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:41,267
I must live my life
with total efficiency...

122
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:43,813
to maximize my inventing capacity,

123
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:47,660
thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind.

124
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:52,163
Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,
precise gentleman.

125
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:57,595
Thank you. Uh... Sorry.
What was your name? Ahem.

126
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:01,860
Passport. Too.

127
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,529
Passepartout.

128
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:15,585
Bottled light.

129
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,241
A miracle.

130
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,789
Hardly.

131
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:23,195
Just undiscovered science from
an American named Thomas Edison.

132
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:26,205
It turns on with a whistle.

133
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:31,493
Please don't do that.

134
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,640
Ah, I see your eye is drawn

135
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:37,279
to what I hope will one day
be my crowning achievement.

136
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,257
A giant moth?

137
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:43,973
- It's a flying machine.
- It can fly?

138
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:46,216
Yes.

139
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,062
No. But it will... one day.

140
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:52,183
One day it will transport people
through the air.

141
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:55,200
Perhaps over entire oceans.

142
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:58,967
Uh-oh.

143
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:02,026
I'm going to have
to make a rule for this.

144
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,464
Dear Father:

145
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:21,180
I will find the fastest way
back to China...

146
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,781
to make our village safe once again.

147
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:40,940
Passepartout?

148
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:45,735
Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes.

149
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:47,313
Prepare my urban transport device.

150
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,295
Prepare my urban transport device.

151
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,102
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

152
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,008
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

153
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:57,907
Clear the way. Clear the way.

154
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,352
Mr. Fogg coming through.
Watch out! Watch out!

155
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,562
Excuse me. Out of way.

156
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,914
- Gangway.
- Fogg's arrived.

157
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:09,362
- Gangway. Ooh!
- Hey!

158
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:12,245
That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon.

159
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,361
That will be all.

160
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:20,694
Gentlemen.

161
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,173
Today I have proved that man

162
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:26,190
can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier

163
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,746
without disrupting
his internal organs.

164
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:33,364
Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

165
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:35,887
What am I thinking? What a fool.

166
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:39,054
That would mean that you
were a real scientist!

167
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:43,644
By your definition,
a real scientist's objective

168
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,000
would be to prevent man from progress.

169
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,038
We live in a golden age, Fogg.

170
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:52,136
Everything worth discovering
has been discovered.

171
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:54,376
Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist

172
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,736
on a past filled with dinosaurs...

173
00:13:57,943 --> 00:13:59,405
and evolution.

174
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,648
And on a future filled

175
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,668
with motorized vehicles,

176
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:06,052
radio waves,

177
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,073
and flying machines!

178
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:11,320
Confound it! The bloody
Bank of England is a madhouse!

179
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:16,207
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.
An Asian chap.

180
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,730
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.

181
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,545
Nothing.

182
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:32,329
Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,
and he acted alone.

183
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:43,044
No. Actually,
they say he was Norwegian.

184
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,258
In fact, though, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians.

185
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:53,618
I heard it from a very reliable source

186
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,647
that it was a gang
of redheaded elderly Norwegians

187
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:58,177
with very tiny feet.

188
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:03,027
It's about time
someone robbed that bank.

189
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,346
Like this very institution,

190
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,452
the Bank of England is outdated.

191
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:10,547
As usual, your contempt
for tradition is appalling.

192
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:14,818
You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer,

193
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,698
but, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.

194
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,326
So now you're an expert
on the bank thief as well.

195
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:25,791
Give us the benefit
of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.

196
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,300
Twenty-six minutes ago,
a ship left Dover for Paris.

197
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:35,059
From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express,

198
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:38,503
where he transfers to a steamer,
from Istanbul to India.

199
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:41,133
In little over a month,
that man could be in China.

200
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:46,554
If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,
he will have circled the globe

201
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,674
and returned to England in a fortnight.

202
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,344
Actually, by my calculations, it would
be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.

203
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:08,777
Outstanding idea.

204
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:10,829
Well, then, Fogg,

205
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,727
let's see you circumnavigate the world

206
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:16,248
in 80 days.

207
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:21,242
I... That would be
a fruitless use of my time.

208
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:23,592
I'm on the verge of numerous...

209
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:26,123
countless... scientific breakthroughs.

210
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:30,427
You coward. Admit it.
It cannot be done.

211
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,080
It can! I could do it.

212
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,503
A wager.

213
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,768
£10,000.

214
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,736
Unlike you and your colleagues,
money does not inspire me.

215
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,921
I believe every man has his price.

216
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:52,075
Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.

217
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,759
There must be something I could offer
that would be worthy of your time.

218
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:03,571
There is. Your position as head
of the Royal Academy.

219
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:10,054
I could lead Britain
and the rest of the world

220
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,757
into a new age of progress
and discovery.

221
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,033
- Fair enough.
- What?

222
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,659
I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow

223
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:28,290
to surrender my position as minister
of science to Phileas Fogg...

224
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:30,562
- No!
- No! No!

225
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:34,498
if he can circumnavigate
the globe...

226
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:37,183
in no more than 80 days.

227
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,038
But if he cannot,

228
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,062
he must never set foot
in this academy again,

229
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:50,920
he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore
he calls a laboratory,

230
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,665
and he must swear...

231
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:56,781
never to invent again.

232
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,857
Just as I always suspected, Fogg.

233
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:06,339
You promise so much, yet you deliver...

234
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:08,086
oh, nothing.

235
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,368
- I'll take your wager.
- What did you say?

236
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,224
I'll take your wager!

237
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,646
He did it.

238
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:25,067
Then it's done.

239
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:29,336
A man who has never set foot
out of England circling the globe.

240
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:33,607
This is going to be rather amusing.

241
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:40,178
History won't remember your amusement,
but it will be hard-pressed to forget

242
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:44,899
the moment I'm standing on the very top
step of the Royal Academy of Science.

243
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:48,099
By the strike of noon,

244
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:51,945
after I, Phileas Fogg,
have traveled around the world

245
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,945
in 80 days!

246
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:03,055
Oh, dear.

247
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:09,398
Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?

248
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:12,755
Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!

249
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,911
- Uh...
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?

250
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,853
Huh?

251
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,853
Uh, Passepartout.

252
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:24,882
Would you... sit with me a moment?

253
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,656
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:40,345
I risked everything,
my entire life's work.

255
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:44,689
For something you believe in.

256
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,792
Nothing could make
more sense than that, sir.

257
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:55,154
You are honorable, Passepartout.

258
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:59,950
But I'm afraid this was
a calamitous lapse of judgment.

259
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:06,001
- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?

260
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:09,528
- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.

261
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,182
This house and my inventions
are all I have.

262
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:23,746
And a brave French valet that will help
you make it around the world in 80 days.

263
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:31,451
- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.

264
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,888
Yes. Yes. Yes!

265
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:37,944
You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India.

266
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:42,388
We're with you, sir!

267
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,577
Good luck!

268
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,247
Halt!

269
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,512
- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.

270
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:06,330
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain
you and your valet until further notice.

271
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,862
This here doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code.

272
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:13,238
Vehicle code?

273
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,070
Code 431.

274
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:19,143
All vehicles
must be powered by horses.

275
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:23,062
Or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like,

276
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,078
excluding giraffes and...

277
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:26,751
You're driveling. Stand aside.

278
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:29,382
I'm about to embark upon
a journey around the world.

279
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:31,984
Not in this monstrosity,
you're not. No!

280
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:34,052
- Mm-mm.
- That's hot.

281
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,756
It's... Ow!

282
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,964
Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.

283
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,446
Stealing a police vehicle is not
an acceptable way to begin our journey.

284
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:56,758
- Not stealing. Borrowing.
- Excuse us.

285
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:59,791
We're borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris,

286
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:02,643
if someone could inform
the appropriate authorities.

287
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:14,970
Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!

288
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:19,938
Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.

289
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,501
What's the point of hiring
a corrupt police officer

290
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:25,048
if he can't abuse the law properly?

291
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:26,591
- Kitchner.
- Sir!

292
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,574
Tell Fix to pack his bags.

293
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,663
- He's going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.

294
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,088
Hmm. Smart man.

295
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,575
Passepartout, tell this
impudent fellow we must

296
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:28,966
leave within six and a half hours, or we
miss our connection in Constantinople.

297
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:31,997
Yes, sir. Please.
We are in a great hurry.

298
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:33,394
- Passepartout?
- Yes?

299
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,494
In French.

300
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,083
Sacre bleu, la champignon,

301
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:47,286
chateau, bien, françoise, voilà,
ooh-la-la, foie de gras.

302
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,532
- What did he say?
- Uh...

303
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:57,590
He say...

304
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:07,556
- What?
- He says not to worry.

305
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,649
The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.

306
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:15,338
Passepartout, this is
a scientific expedition, not a holiday!

307
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:17,569
I will not miss this train.

308
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:21,220
Ah!

309
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,026
- Very amazing.
- What?

310
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:24,695
What does it say?

311
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:27,139
Eddie Thomason will be
showing his inventions.

312
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:29,445
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

313
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:32,478
What a chance for you
to meet another great inventor.

314
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:36,191
I would quite like to tell him
about my whistle modification.

315
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:37,495
Good idea.

316
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:44,989
See? Exposition. Science.

317
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:01,521
I assure you these are not
the works of Thomas Edison.

318
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:04,129
Uh, I think he is
somewhere around here.

319
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:08,487
Wait a moment. This isn't science.

320
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:11,106
This is art.

321
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,625
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

322
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:14,857
That painting is highly inaccurate.

323
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,671
It's not supposed
to be accurate.

324
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:22,700
The artist views reality
through imagination

325
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:26,027
rather than simply recording it.

326
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,817
It is called "lmpressionism."

327
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:33,368
Well, um, I'm not impressed.

328
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:36,987
Trees are not violet,
grass is not charcoal,

329
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,998
and a man cannot...

330
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:51,195
fly.

331
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,233
You feel something.

332
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,582
You dream of flying.

333
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,347
Or of naked men.

334
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:00,898
- Sometimes.
- Ah.

335
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:04,100
The flying. N-N-Not the men.

336
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:07,118
I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.

337
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:11,365
Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot
better than these amateurs.

338
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,585
What did he say?

339
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:18,933
Oh, no.

340
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:32,207
Non.

341
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:50,964
Goodness. What was that all about?

342
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,925
Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.

343
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:57,544
Champagne for everyone!

344
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,764
I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.

345
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:20,229
Have you considered
a career in schematic drawing?

346
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:23,631
No. It would be far too limiting.

347
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:26,018
At least your work
shows genuine promise.

348
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:31,328
Thank you. Those I painted
many months ago.

349
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:33,412
I was lacking inspiration.

350
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:37,041
I found some men
to help me find Mr. "Edimon."

351
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:41,146
- This way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

352
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,377
He's very eager.

353
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:47,947
Get him!

354
00:27:55,781 --> 00:27:59,611
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it's terrible, no?

355
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,312
No, no, it's...

356
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:02,664
- clever.
- Oh.

357
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:03,933
Hmm. Yes.

358
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:05,918
- He's a clown.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:08,034
And yet...

360
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:10,332
he's incredibly angry.

361
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,824
The irony is, uh, terrifying.

362
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,954
- Is that good?
- Is it?

363
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:46,838
Ah, this is interesting.

364
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:51,367
Without opposable thumbs,
a dog could never play poker.

365
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,709
Yes, they can.

366
00:28:53,872 --> 00:28:55,781
Where have you seen
a dog playing poker?

367
00:28:56,742 --> 00:28:58,433
Right there.

368
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:34,013
Perhaps I'm not the best judge.

369
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:39,447
Bandits! They come to take away
all the paintings!

370
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:52,756
- Quickly! Come this way!
- Passepartout!

371
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:56,675
Go, go, go!

372
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:22,578
Thank you, Miss La Roche.
You may just have saved our trip.

373
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:25,215
- There you are.
- I would, uh...

374
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:28,078
- I would like to repay you.
- Take me with you.

375
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:31,843
- What?
- I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.

376
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:35,549
They think of me only
as a coat-check girl!

377
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:39,122
- Why?
- Because I am the coat-check girl.

378
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,855
- Ah.
- Look.

379
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:43,497
The leading art critic in Paris.

380
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,069
Look what he wrote
about one of my paintings.

381
00:30:47,217 --> 00:30:50,064
- I can't read this. It's French.
- I wish I couldn't.

382
00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:51,879
Why do you carry it?

383
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:56,778
When I do succeed,
I can throw it in his face, but for now,

384
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:59,908
I need a world journey to inspire me.

385
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,163
I'm inspired to get us
back on schedule.

386
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:12,666
Let's see. Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots,

387
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,560
factoring in air density...

388
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:16,956
Outstanding!

389
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,211
Passepartout, onward! Ah.

390
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:30,392
There we go. Passepartout,
tell him to keep the change.

391
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,929
Uh...
fromage, por favor.

392
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:36,603
We are going around
the world in 80 days!

393
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,544
The balloon cannot
support all this weight!

394
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,108
Your hot air should compensate, no?

395
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:49,185
Get off!

396
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,637
- What are they doing?
- They're being disorderly.

397
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,765
Hey! Let go! Let go!

398
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:06,563
Hey! Passepartout!
My valise! It has all my money in it.

399
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:20,777
Hey, lady, lady, lady! It's my bag.

400
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:22,799
No, that is my bag.

401
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:25,434
No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!

402
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:26,629
- No!
- You crazy.

403
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:28,178
Yes.

404
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:32,027
That tickles!

405
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:40,502
You took my bag.

406
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:42,387
Mr. Fogg!

407
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,045
- Good catch!
- Thank you.

408
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:59,225
Ooh!

409
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:05,126
Those are the gallery bandits.

410
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,837
Oh, yes!

411
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:17,940
Ah.

412
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:26,268
He stole my purse!
This devil stole my purse!

413
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:52,355
My bag! He took my... Ah!

414
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:57,446
- We've stolen that old lady's purse.
- Huh. Here.

415
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:04,736
We must help Passepartout.
How do I make this go lower?

416
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:07,600
What are you doing?
Decrease the overall weight...

417
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,922
- That's not going to work.
- Yes, it is.

418
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:15,880
Physics, no?

419
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,816
Yes.

420
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,118
Ahhh...

421
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:36,482

422
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:47,767
Bonjour.

423
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:50,858
Bonjour.

424
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:53,871
- Eh?
- Bye-bye!

425
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,877
Wake up, lady! Wake up, lady!

426
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:10,778
Wake up! Lady, wake up!

427
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,745
- Bye, mama.
- Merci.

428
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:22,852
Bye, baby.

429
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:27,372
Ohh...

430
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,918
Very impressive. I'd have let go by now.

431
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:44,367
The statue's grabbing his trousers.

432
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,620
I don't think it's doing it on purpose.

433
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:03,193
Oh, dear.

434
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:15,192
Help!

435
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:24,813
Well done, Passepartout.

436
00:36:24,954 --> 00:36:27,802
We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves.

437
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,812
Yes, yes. Thank you.

438
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,928
Those art thieves
seemed to recognize you.

439
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:42,539
- I look like someone they know.
- Some other Frenchman, perhaps?

440
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:50,277
- So, where can we drop you off?
- We're not stopping.

441
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,427
Once we land to board
the Orient Express, you are free to go.

442
00:36:53,616 --> 00:36:54,991
Thank you so much.

443
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:58,474
- For what?
- I'm free to go with you.

444
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:01,109
I did not say you were free to come.

445
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:03,048
- I said you were free to go.
- Where?

446
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:06,427
- Anywhere.
- Thank you. I will go with you.

447
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:11,564
- No, you will not, Miss La Roche.
- Monique.

448
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:12,914
Miss... Monique!

449
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:14,865
There! Now we are getting along.

450
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:20,082
Comme c'est beau.

451
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:22,284
C'est magnifique.

452
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:25,706
Toutes ces couleurs.

453
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,461
Look at the sunrise.
There is only one word for it.

454
00:37:29,686 --> 00:37:32,174
- "Magical."
- Miss La Roche!

455
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:35,225
I refuse to allow you
to continue traveling with us.

456
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:39,288
I'm not traveling with you.
I'm making my own way.

457
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:41,417
Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.

458
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:44,085
This is what happens
when you leave your home.

459
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,050
You meet... people!

460
00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:58,610
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

461
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:07,301
Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,
and together he and I can speculate.

462
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:20,860
A very sacred object
was stolen from my village.

463
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:23,012
I have taken it back.

464
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:34,461
Incroyable.

465
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:39,161
For many centuries, the Jade Buddha
has protected my people.

466
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,488
It has never left our village until now.

467
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:48,396
And those art thieves. Who are they?

468
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:52,974
The Black Scorpions.
They work for an evil warlord. Fang.

469
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:56,683
She wants the Buddha
so she can take over my village.

470
00:38:56,906 --> 00:39:00,801
I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.

471
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:03,727
Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.

472
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:08,660
Perhaps, then,
we can help one another.

473
00:39:09,552 --> 00:39:13,131
I will keep your secret,
and you convince Mr. Fogg

474
00:39:13,357 --> 00:39:15,778
to allow me to travel
the world with you.

475
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,277
Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!

476
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:33,065
Merely pointing out if they coordinated
their coal-shoveling technique,

477
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:36,538
they could maximize our speed.

478
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:43,122
When we reach Constantinople, I suggest
you board a train we are not on.

479
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:48,859
- Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.
- And why is that?

480
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,763
Uh, we just discovered that we are
related from the same family.

481
00:39:56,966 --> 00:40:02,084
I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side. French.

482
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:07,750
Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train
go faster, I can come with you, oui?

483
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:10,563
Yes.

484
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,668
I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.

485
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:35,760
If there's anything else you would like,
just let us know, Miss La Roche.

486
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:38,296
Ah! Voilà.

487
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:42,468
Champagne with your first-class seats,
Mademoiselle La Roche.

488
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:43,792
Merci.

489
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:47,121
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

490
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,977
- Merci.
- Monsieur.

491
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,135
A tea?

492
00:41:22,718 --> 00:41:23,733
Okay.

493
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:29,038
How to make English tea.

494
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:32,478
Precisely 96 degrees.

495
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,380
Ooh.

496
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:42,064
Excuse me, sir.

497
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:45,051
- Fogg's valet!

498
00:41:45,274 --> 00:41:48,143
- A jade Buddha!
- This is not a jade Buddha.

499
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:52,369
- Oh, yes, it is!
- You're right. But I'm not a valet.

500
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:54,525
Oh. Really?

501
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:57,430
Owww!

502
00:41:58,721 --> 00:42:00,663
Me bloody nose!

503
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:04,501
Let me in!
You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!

504
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,728
Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.

505
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:26,012
Ow! Oh! Ow!

506
00:42:26,215 --> 00:42:29,215
Ahhh!

507
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:31,328
You're under arrest!

508
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:35,592
Ah! Ooh! Ow!

509
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:38,001
Sorry!

510
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,920
Why the devil are we stopping?

511
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:07,024
Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Fogg

512
00:43:07,189 --> 00:43:09,393
and his traveling companions
at his banquet.

513
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:11,186
How very flattering.

514
00:43:11,362 --> 00:43:15,257
But please inform Prince "Happy"
that we are on a very tight schedule.

515
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,116
Prince Hapi demands it.

516
00:43:19,904 --> 00:43:23,068
Then Prince Hapi
will have to get accustomed

517
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:25,412
to not getting everything he wants.

518
00:43:33,017 --> 00:43:35,024
It is magnificent.

519
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:37,902
Mr. Fogg, his house
is even bigger than yours.

520
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:41,733
His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.

521
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,388
Yes, it is.

522
00:43:44,728 --> 00:43:47,630
Not good.
Very old. Look. Broken.

523
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:50,701
And where is His Highness?

524
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:03,021
Oh. The prince is also
a talented musician.

525
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:05,865
If I did nothing
but lounge about the palace,

526
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:08,089
I'd learn to pluck a few notes.

527
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:23,617
Let's make this brief.
I'll pose for photographs,

528
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,721
wearing a turban,
holding an atlas...

529
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:27,309
Mademoiselle.

530
00:44:29,673 --> 00:44:34,529
How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?

531
00:44:34,812 --> 00:44:36,339
Is that what you call it

532
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,032
when one stops a train
and kidnaps its passengers?

533
00:44:39,216 --> 00:44:41,224
Phileas Fogg.

534
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:42,845
Please forgive me,

535
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:47,395
but I feel like Aphrodite herself
descended to Earth.

536
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:50,335
What is a ravishing
woman like you...

537
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:57,151
- I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.

538
00:44:57,434 --> 00:44:59,092
- Yes. Well, I mean...
- No!

539
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:01,156
Don't touch it!

540
00:45:01,338 --> 00:45:06,521
- That is my most treasured possession.
- I was only pointing. I was just...

541
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,599
Don't even point.

542
00:45:08,745 --> 00:45:10,305
Rodin.

543
00:45:10,447 --> 00:45:13,447
Yes. A Rodin.

544
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,992
Oh.

545
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:18,467
I have never seen a more beautiful...
muscular form.

546
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:22,517
Well, I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.

547
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,891
Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!

548
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:27,241
Yes.

549
00:45:27,365 --> 00:45:30,333
"Hapi Birthday.
Your pal, Rodin."

550
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,764
- Come, my dear. Let us dine.
- Yes.

551
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:38,620
Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.

552
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:40,718
No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.

553
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:43,693
We will join you, actually.
But just one drink.

554
00:45:49,753 --> 00:45:52,917
After the duke and the duchess
sat down in the bath,

555
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:55,676
I realized I forgot
to put on my bathing suit.

556
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:03,074
I'm such a fool.

557
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:07,095
Always embarrassing myself
in front of visiting dignitaries.

558
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:10,273
But you know how that can be,
right, Phil?

559
00:46:10,507 --> 00:46:12,394
Uh, yes.

560
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:15,161
Uh, it's Phileas, actually.

561
00:46:15,345 --> 00:46:18,858
So, Foggy, tell me.
I heard you're an inventor.

562
00:46:19,082 --> 00:46:22,311
Well, I try to apply myself
to thinking of new ways

563
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:25,007
to help better mankind,
if that's what you mean.

564
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:27,044
Well, I'm not an inventor,

565
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,670
but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land

566
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:33,741
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.

567
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:35,043
Oh.

568
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,075
Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.

569
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,461
Not now, Passepartout.

570
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:48,466
Oh.

571
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:50,018
Mmm.

572
00:46:50,145 --> 00:46:51,607
- Miss La Roche.
- Hmm?

573
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:55,775
It is mesmerizing,
the way your face illuminates.

574
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,164
Oh...

575
00:46:57,287 --> 00:46:59,970
Her discoloration could be
an allergic reaction

576
00:47:00,156 --> 00:47:02,709
or a mild form of hives.

577
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:08,193
Although I've noticed a certain

578
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:11,943
luminescent glow about her
complexion when she's drawing.

579
00:47:12,203 --> 00:47:16,546
And sometimes, when she's...
concentrating on her latest work,

580
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,295
her ears will actually flutter.

581
00:47:22,146 --> 00:47:26,554
- It's rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.

582
00:47:26,816 --> 00:47:29,751
U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.

583
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:34,275
Shouldn't we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.

584
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,432
Thank you for your hospitality.

585
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:40,139
It's been absolutely fascinating,
but I'm afraid we must push on.

586
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:41,346
Yes.

587
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:43,386
Very well.
The gentlemen are free to go.

588
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:46,850
But Miss La Roche...
stays here with me.

589
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,580
- To be my wife.
- Hmm?

590
00:47:49,773 --> 00:47:52,261
Yes. Wife number seven.

591
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,241
- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.

592
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:02,277
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!

593
00:48:02,484 --> 00:48:03,891
Prince Hapi has spoken!

594
00:48:06,657 --> 00:48:10,104
Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we're leaving.

595
00:48:10,326 --> 00:48:12,366
I can tell when we're not wanted.

596
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:17,581
Monsieur Fogg!

597
00:48:18,868 --> 00:48:21,040
Do Tuesdays work for you?

598
00:48:22,172 --> 00:48:24,823
- Good-bye.
- Thank you!

599
00:48:28,912 --> 00:48:31,246
No!

600
00:48:32,382 --> 00:48:33,397
Halt!

601
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:35,545
Or Hapi gets smashed!

602
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:39,646
Please! Anything but my statue of me!

603
00:48:39,888 --> 00:48:43,271
Miss La Roche,
please join us, if you will.

604
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:49,106
- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!

605
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:53,219
- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!

606
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:56,698
- Now!
- Let's go. Come on.

607
00:49:03,313 --> 00:49:07,469
Now, take off your clothes
and throw them... Uh...

608
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:11,492
I assure you the statue is not
armed... harmed in any way.

609
00:49:27,237 --> 00:49:30,019
Get them!

610
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,484
His arm!

611
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:38,017
Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.

612
00:49:38,182 --> 00:49:40,735
Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.

613
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:44,048
This is exactly why
I should never have let you come along.

614
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:45,432
Kill them!

615
00:49:46,155 --> 00:49:49,701
I want my arm!

616
00:49:49,927 --> 00:49:52,927
No!

617
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:56,708
Sir! I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix.

618
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:59,070
- A-ha!
- According to him,

619
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:02,368
the bank thief and Fogg's valet
are the same man.

620
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:05,506
Fogg doesn't realize
he's transporting the bank thief!

621
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:09,898
Or does he?
He did leave town in quite a hurry.

622
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:12,033
Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

623
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:14,036
Indeed, Lord Salisbury.

624
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:16,125
Eh, evading arrest,

625
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:18,556
stealing a police vehicle,

626
00:50:18,722 --> 00:50:21,340
sounds rather incriminating to me.

627
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:23,347
One can almost deduce

628
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:26,144
this entire bet was merely a ruse

629
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,337
to facilitate his escape.

630
00:50:29,198 --> 00:50:32,908
- Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.

631
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:34,697
Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.

632
00:50:34,872 --> 00:50:38,516
I shall name a beef-related entrée
after you in your honor! Kitchner!

633
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:40,749
- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yard

634
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:46,093
that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt
the man who robbed the Bank of England!

635
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:49,799
- Where are they now?
- They're taking a train across India,

636
00:50:49,987 --> 00:50:51,481
from Bombay to Calcutta.

637
00:50:51,622 --> 00:50:53,793
Thank God we own India!

638
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:56,227
I want their faces
in every police station,

639
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:58,781
army barracks, post office,
railway station and outhouse in India!

640
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,683
We're going to stop Fogg
and get my Jade Buddha back

641
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,519
by any means necessary!

642
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,998
Agra is where we will capture them!

643
00:51:25,355 --> 00:51:27,591
Intercept them at Agra!

644
00:51:27,758 --> 00:51:29,416
Carry on, Cutter!

645
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,893
Move it! Move it! Fall in!

646
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:45,789
And they were
the greatest kung fu boxers.

647
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:48,431
Ten Tigers of Canton.

648
00:51:48,578 --> 00:51:49,854
Brothers in arms.

649
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:52,630
They fought to keep order
and justice in China.

650
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:56,132
The most famous of Ten Tigers
is Wong Fei Hung.

651
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:03,492
Armed with
only bamboo sticks...

652
00:52:03,661 --> 00:52:05,636
It's salivating on... please.

653
00:52:05,795 --> 00:52:07,223
Is this your goat?

654
00:52:07,363 --> 00:52:09,436
Did they really fight like tigers?

655
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:12,731
Each Tiger have their own
animal fighting style.

656
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:15,173
Like tiger.

657
00:52:15,338 --> 00:52:18,272
Snake. Snake head, snake tail,
snake mouth, snake tongue!

658
00:52:19,443 --> 00:52:21,101
Where are my calculations?

659
00:52:21,244 --> 00:52:22,585
Monkey!

660
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:27,193
The goat! Passepartout, I'm being
attacked by a ferocious animal!

661
00:52:28,484 --> 00:52:31,386
- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.

662
00:52:31,587 --> 00:52:34,369
Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me.

663
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:36,531
And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.

664
00:52:36,693 --> 00:52:39,475
Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?

665
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:41,821
It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.

666
00:52:42,598 --> 00:52:46,821
How could a man learn to defend himself
by watching animals behave like...

667
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:49,405
- animals?
- It is famous legend.

668
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:53,369
- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.

669
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:55,333
Yes.

670
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:58,795
But all truths are born from facts.

671
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:01,601
Solid, tangible facts
that can be calculated

672
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:03,442
and written down on paper.

673
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:07,262
And then eaten by a goat.

674
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,425
Mr. Feelsillious,
when I tell the story

675
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:13,757
of the man who circled
the entire world in 80 days,

676
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:16,200
would that not be a legend?

677
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:21,754
Only if the man's name
was Feelsillious Frog.

678
00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:31,082
- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way! Come on!

679
00:53:31,347 --> 00:53:34,097
Look sharp, now. Get 'em!

680
00:53:34,283 --> 00:53:35,777
Find these men!

681
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:40,740
Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England.

682
00:53:41,024 --> 00:53:44,024
Preposterous. This is a desperate
attempt by Lord Kelvin

683
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,373
to impede my journey.

684
00:53:45,461 --> 00:53:47,850
I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.

685
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:52,208
Except bullets.

686
00:53:53,337 --> 00:53:55,541
Listen up!
Have you seen these men?

687
00:53:57,306 --> 00:53:59,313
Come on!

688
00:54:11,788 --> 00:54:13,643
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

689
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:16,311
They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.

690
00:54:16,492 --> 00:54:17,954
They won't get past us, sir!

691
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:22,582
Ladies, have you seen these two men?

692
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,329
Look closely. They're very dangerous.

693
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:30,439
They're everywhere!
This is not going to work!

694
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:34,121
- Just act like ladies.
- Not a problem.

695
00:54:34,343 --> 00:54:37,060
Hello. Hello! Ah.

696
00:54:38,514 --> 00:54:41,645
- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!

697
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:43,924
No, but I am.

698
00:54:50,493 --> 00:54:53,657
Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?

699
00:54:58,202 --> 00:55:02,991
What nice hand,
nice eye, nice hair...

700
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,280
Hang about!

701
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:12,614
Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.

702
00:55:12,815 --> 00:55:14,441
Stop, stop.

703
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:20,527
Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.

704
00:55:20,756 --> 00:55:22,960
Passepartout, we did it.

705
00:55:28,364 --> 00:55:30,274
Hey, wrong way.

706
00:55:30,466 --> 00:55:31,644
Ah!

707
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:38,411
Phileas? No! No!

708
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,985
Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!

709
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:46,774
Ah! Ah!

710
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:48,443
Ahhh!

711
00:55:48,585 --> 00:55:50,341
Fogg's valet! Heh!

712
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:53,126
- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!

713
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:55,317
Hand over the Jade Buddha!

714
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:57,708
Oh!

715
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,407
You're under arrest! Whoa!
Watch me plums! Ooh!

716
00:56:08,171 --> 00:56:11,815
Now you get him very mad! Let's go.

717
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:14,146
Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!

718
00:56:23,252 --> 00:56:25,162
Run!

719
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:28,694
- Which way?
- Down!

720
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:30,768
Again!

721
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:33,439
Down!

722
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:37,212
Jump!

723
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,653
- Go, go, go!
- What's upsetting him?

724
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:46,589
- He wants the Jade Buddha!
- Then give it to him!

725
00:56:50,546 --> 00:56:54,223
- Phileas, wake up!
- Please, please. You must go.

726
00:56:55,384 --> 00:56:59,159
- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!

727
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:13,889
Ow! Ay!

728
00:57:17,874 --> 00:57:19,467
Phileas, help!

729
00:57:19,608 --> 00:57:21,430
Leave her alone! I'll protect you!

730
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:23,432
Ah!

731
00:57:24,513 --> 00:57:26,007
I'm here, my dear.

732
00:57:26,149 --> 00:57:29,051
Uh, that stumble was
simply to buy me time.

733
00:57:30,186 --> 00:57:33,350
This cane is not as it appears.

734
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:38,161
If I depress this button, it would
deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.

735
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:44,354
This... is...

736
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:47,120
a strange knife.

737
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:48,743
Isn't it a sextant?

738
00:57:49,705 --> 00:57:51,592
Yes.

739
00:57:58,381 --> 00:57:59,787
Huh.

740
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,262
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!

741
00:58:08,524 --> 00:58:10,379
You men, come with me!

742
00:58:10,526 --> 00:58:13,625
You'd better put this on.

743
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:16,480
Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often.

744
00:58:21,237 --> 00:58:23,147
Oh.

745
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:24,801
We should run.

746
00:58:24,973 --> 00:58:26,828
- What, now?
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,404
Yes, we should run.

748
00:58:33,816 --> 00:58:35,823
- Break down the door!
- Okay.

749
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,497
No, not me brains!

750
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:53,500
- Give me the Jade "Bu-ddha"!
- Okay, okay.

751
00:58:53,702 --> 00:58:55,392
What's "Bu-ddha"?

752
00:58:57,907 --> 00:59:00,526
Get ready to jump! Now!

753
00:59:14,491 --> 00:59:17,622
It is him, the Englishman
who robbed the Bank of England!

754
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,412
He's escaping in that palkee-garry!

755
00:59:20,597 --> 00:59:22,866
Hey, there he is!

756
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,822
They'll check all trains heading east.

757
00:59:27,036 --> 00:59:31,226
If we could make it to the coast, we
can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.

758
00:59:31,474 --> 00:59:34,671
- They're both British colonies.
- Does England own everything in Asia?

759
00:59:34,878 --> 00:59:38,194
Not China. Not yet.

760
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:33,843
Passepartout?

761
01:00:35,238 --> 01:00:40,093
- You look troubled.
- I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.

762
01:00:40,376 --> 01:00:41,969
You did what you had to.

763
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,533
The fate of your village
is of far greater importance

764
01:00:44,748 --> 01:00:47,465
than any bet Phileas has made.

765
01:00:47,617 --> 01:00:50,748
If he loses, all it will
cost him his money and pride.

766
01:00:50,954 --> 01:00:54,270
No, Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that.

767
01:00:55,357 --> 01:00:58,226
What do you mean?

768
01:01:02,932 --> 01:01:04,972
My village!

769
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:11,783
- Your village?
- Uh... I mean,

770
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:13,861
my, what a village!

771
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,417
Oh, it's beautiful!

772
01:01:16,879 --> 01:01:19,749
We do need to stop and
resupply, but we must be off by morning.

773
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,058
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.

774
01:01:42,238 --> 01:01:44,824
Lau Xing.

775
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:48,139
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

776
01:01:57,587 --> 01:02:01,165
Goodness, that's quite a welcome.
Do these people know him?

777
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:05,067
It must be their custom,
the way they welcome all strangers.

778
01:02:05,294 --> 01:02:07,301
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

779
01:02:22,278 --> 01:02:24,482
Whoo!

780
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:27,096
Lau Xing.

781
01:02:39,194 --> 01:02:40,623
Lau Xing.

782
01:02:42,563 --> 01:02:44,254
Lau Xing.

783
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:47,929
Ah. Uh...

784
01:03:14,764 --> 01:03:16,170
Oh. It's beautiful.

785
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:18,185
You are very talented.

786
01:03:18,334 --> 01:03:19,643
Thank you.

787
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:22,879
You need more blue.

788
01:03:29,779 --> 01:03:32,429
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.

789
01:03:35,184 --> 01:03:37,486
Sorry?

790
01:03:46,963 --> 01:03:47,977
Vile.

791
01:03:48,097 --> 01:03:50,912
Absolutely vile.

792
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:01,330
Welcome home, Lau Xing.

793
01:04:05,114 --> 01:04:06,838
Your brothers will be proud.

794
01:04:06,983 --> 01:04:09,700
The whole notion of
a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,

795
01:04:09,886 --> 01:04:12,406
unless you can
harness the power of helium.

796
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:14,530
Or hydrogen, which is far better...

797
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,029
Yes, well, couldn't have
put it better myself.

798
01:04:20,195 --> 01:04:25,051
As for this Englishman, do you think
such an association is wise?

799
01:04:25,368 --> 01:04:28,401
He is the most disciplined man
I have ever met.

800
01:04:29,438 --> 01:04:31,325
The crane!

801
01:04:31,474 --> 01:04:33,513
The monkey. Very frightening.

802
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:37,491
Snake.

803
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,101
And, of course, the eagle.

804
01:04:43,386 --> 01:04:44,433
Phileas?

805
01:04:46,555 --> 01:04:49,719
Phileas, I made this for you.

806
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:54,180
Oh, yes.
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.

807
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:55,575
What does this say?

808
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:58,567
Stupid.

809
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:02,277
Lau Xing...

810
01:05:30,466 --> 01:05:32,408
I've had quite enough.

811
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:34,544
I just... I...

812
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:02,778
Ahhh.

813
01:06:02,899 --> 01:06:06,095
I am going to be abominably ill.

814
01:06:19,948 --> 01:06:22,283
I... I want to die.

815
01:06:23,386 --> 01:06:25,491
Please kill me.

816
01:06:59,054 --> 01:07:01,225
"Dear Father:

817
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,423
I will find the fastest way to China."

818
01:07:08,397 --> 01:07:10,055
It's strong.

819
01:07:18,508 --> 01:07:21,126
Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.

820
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:30,912
- This is your family.
- My name is not Passepartout.

821
01:07:31,153 --> 01:07:32,844
It is Lau Xing.

822
01:07:33,722 --> 01:07:38,456
- I robbed the Bank of England.
- You robbed the Bank of England?

823
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:42,305
Not for gold or money,
but for the Jade Buddha.

824
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:44,899
It was stolen from our village.

825
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:50,632
Phileas, he had no other choice.
This was his only way to get home.

826
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:57,104
- You knew about this?
- Well...

827
01:07:59,014 --> 01:08:01,567
I have nothing but respect
for you, Mr. Fogg.

828
01:08:03,919 --> 01:08:06,504
Then respect my deductive reasoning.

829
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:09,754
You have both used me.

830
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,747
You to escape to China,

831
01:08:11,893 --> 01:08:14,959
and you to travel to further
your impressionistic humbug!

832
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:18,562
Your overtures of... comradeship,

833
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,742
of friendship, of...

834
01:08:25,173 --> 01:08:28,173
All that was a means to ensure
I would take you along.

835
01:08:28,378 --> 01:08:32,534
My entire life,
I got along splendidly by myself.

836
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:36,675
You've been pebbles in my shoe,
slowing me down, endangering my life,

837
01:08:37,986 --> 01:08:40,921
risking everything,
all I've ever lived for.

838
01:08:41,123 --> 01:08:42,911
And you!

839
01:08:44,393 --> 01:08:45,986
You knew that.

840
01:08:59,509 --> 01:09:02,607
Don't let him go.
He'll be lost by midnight.

841
01:09:03,413 --> 01:09:05,006
Go!

842
01:09:08,984 --> 01:09:12,180
More of your relatives, I suppose.

843
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:20,358
You can just forget
about a reference.

844
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:23,945
I beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Fogg.

845
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:35,385
What's he screaming about?

846
01:09:35,544 --> 01:09:37,999
He's saying, "Please, let me go.
I'm bored."

847
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:43,458
Why is he in prison?

848
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:52,430
Urinating in public.

849
01:09:52,594 --> 01:09:55,311
Charming.

850
01:09:55,498 --> 01:09:58,497
At least he had the decency
to be forthcoming about it.

851
01:09:58,735 --> 01:10:01,582
Is there anything you've told me
that's even remotely true?

852
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:03,429
I really can sing.

853
01:10:04,306 --> 01:10:07,273
# Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

854
01:10:07,476 --> 01:10:09,232
# Dormez-vous

855
01:10:09,378 --> 01:10:10,752
# Dormez-vous

856
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:13,530
# Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines

857
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:16,017
# Ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding #

858
01:10:16,184 --> 01:10:19,119
Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.
Ding, dang, dong.

859
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:21,591
Look!

860
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:29,029
Oh, good. Here comes
Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.

861
01:10:35,103 --> 01:10:39,227
- Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off killing me.

862
01:10:40,609 --> 01:10:44,765
You have nerve.
Are your comrades so brave?

863
01:10:45,715 --> 01:10:48,976
Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your silly bracelet.

864
01:10:50,786 --> 01:10:53,469
All right. It's not silly.

865
01:10:53,655 --> 01:10:57,485
I spit on you! France spits on you!

866
01:10:57,727 --> 01:10:59,101
Vive I'Anjou!

867
01:11:00,163 --> 01:11:02,912
- Your turn will come soon enough.
- Coward!

868
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:05,946
Leave them alone. Fight me.

869
01:11:06,135 --> 01:11:08,110
Yes, fight him.

870
01:11:09,106 --> 01:11:11,440
Let's see how ferocious you really are.

871
01:11:59,622 --> 01:12:01,597
Hey, that's cheating!

872
01:12:03,025 --> 01:12:04,814
- Look out!
- Huh?

873
01:12:04,962 --> 01:12:07,002
Left!

874
01:12:10,968 --> 01:12:12,277
Behind you!

875
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:17,230
No!

876
01:12:17,373 --> 01:12:20,505
- Hit them!
- Silence!

877
01:12:26,415 --> 01:12:27,593
You savages!

878
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:30,712
Phileas, help him!

879
01:12:30,853 --> 01:12:33,635
- Watch out on the right.
- Huh?

880
01:12:33,824 --> 01:12:35,252
No, my right.

881
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,834
Stop helping me!

882
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,749
What's happening?

883
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,173
Where is Passepartout?

884
01:12:41,297 --> 01:12:42,726
How is he getting on?

885
01:12:42,865 --> 01:12:46,956
I wouldn't say he's winning,
but, uh, I think he's doing all right.

886
01:12:55,278 --> 01:12:57,350
Go home to mama.

887
01:13:11,861 --> 01:13:14,033
Huh?

888
01:13:15,132 --> 01:13:18,514
- What took you so long?
- I had to finish my lunch.

889
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:29,726
Wong Fei Hung!

890
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:34,490
Surely you're not foolish enough
to take on all of my men by yourself?

891
01:13:40,256 --> 01:13:41,271
Ten Tigers?

892
01:13:49,766 --> 01:13:51,457
Kill them!

893
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,177
Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!

894
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,582
What's happening?

895
01:14:20,429 --> 01:14:21,989
Phileas!

896
01:14:28,604 --> 01:14:30,011
Ohhh!

897
01:14:31,975 --> 01:14:33,797
Passepartout... Knife!

898
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:47,294
- Merci.
- You're welcome.

899
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,247
You promise me that Black Scorpions
will never come back to Lanzhou.

900
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,677
These are my brothers and sister.
The Ten Tigers.

901
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:41,967
- But there are only nine.
- Including me.

902
01:16:42,205 --> 01:16:43,579
They're real.

903
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,300
The legend was true.

904
01:17:34,356 --> 01:17:36,560
- Mr. Fogg...
- Passepartout,

905
01:17:36,726 --> 01:17:39,060
or whatever your name is,
save your apologies.

906
01:17:39,228 --> 01:17:42,938
Phileas, he risked his life
for what he believes in.

907
01:17:43,165 --> 01:17:45,172
If anyone understands that, you do.

908
01:17:45,367 --> 01:17:48,782
Please ensure Miss La Roche
finds safe passage home.

909
01:17:49,038 --> 01:17:51,788
This should be adequate.

910
01:17:56,311 --> 01:17:57,718
Oh.

911
01:17:57,847 --> 01:18:00,563
I, uh, believe this is your veil.

912
01:18:04,787 --> 01:18:07,821
I will never dress like a woman again.

913
01:18:09,391 --> 01:18:11,245
Ever.

914
01:18:11,394 --> 01:18:14,655
Mr. Fogg.
Please let me help you win your bet.

915
01:18:16,265 --> 01:18:20,007
I have secured the services
of a more reliable gentleman.

916
01:18:32,314 --> 01:18:34,288
Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,

917
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:36,043
travel alone.

918
01:19:28,271 --> 01:19:32,068
Fifi La Belle!
She sings! She dances!

919
01:19:32,341 --> 01:19:35,821
She does the dance of the...
You, sir, come right in.

920
01:19:36,045 --> 01:19:38,663
See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...

921
01:19:38,848 --> 01:19:43,190
Ah, the most modern city in the world.

922
01:19:43,452 --> 01:19:46,267
Finally, civilization.

923
01:19:53,329 --> 01:19:55,850
Excuse me. Pardon me.

924
01:19:56,032 --> 01:19:59,861
Can anyone direct me
to the Pacific Railroad Station?

925
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:04,826
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

926
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:08,040
I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.

927
01:20:08,243 --> 01:20:10,578
No, no, no.
Please, it's my fault entirely.

928
01:20:10,746 --> 01:20:13,910
- Let me, uh...
- Oh... Ah!

929
01:20:14,117 --> 01:20:16,899
Oh. Oh, Lord,
I think I sprained my knee.

930
01:20:17,086 --> 01:20:19,028
Uh! Ooh.

931
01:20:19,188 --> 01:20:21,293
I should find you a physician.

932
01:20:21,457 --> 01:20:24,075
There's a doctor who has
an office around the corner.

933
01:20:24,259 --> 01:20:27,805
Excellent.
Well, uh, I'll get him for you.

934
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,110
Thank you.

935
01:20:29,231 --> 01:20:32,526
There should be more people
like you in this world.

936
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:37,587
Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!

937
01:20:41,778 --> 01:20:44,331
Whoo!

938
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,283
Mon Dieu.

939
01:20:55,424 --> 01:20:58,773
Can you imagine Phileas alone
in a place like this?

940
01:20:58,994 --> 01:21:00,488
I'm sure he's fine.

941
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:04,651
Alms.

942
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:06,622
Alms.

943
01:21:08,036 --> 01:21:09,760
Alms for the poor?

944
01:21:14,443 --> 01:21:15,555
Arms?

945
01:21:16,712 --> 01:21:20,127
You already got arms.
It's money you need.

946
01:21:21,184 --> 01:21:24,283
I can't even scrounge proficiently.

947
01:21:24,486 --> 01:21:25,860
Hey.

948
01:21:26,522 --> 01:21:30,100
Cheer up, pal. You just gotta
figure out what'll work for you.

949
01:21:30,325 --> 01:21:34,319
Now, what makes you
different from them?

950
01:21:34,564 --> 01:21:36,833
I'm hungry and miserable.

951
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,553
No. You stink.

952
01:21:40,334 --> 01:21:44,524
Your stink is your most powerful weapon
in your begging arsenal.

953
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:46,433
Watch this.

954
01:21:49,077 --> 01:21:50,801
Hey.

955
01:21:50,946 --> 01:21:53,434
- Give me money.
- Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.

956
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:57,965
- That guy smells like a dead horse!
- I'm not proud of it.

957
01:21:58,153 --> 01:22:00,803
Simple, yet effective.

958
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:02,418
- Yeah, I see.
- You try.

959
01:22:02,558 --> 01:22:05,493
Give it a shot. I got faith in you.

960
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:10,357
Excuse me. Now, uh, you...

961
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:14,917
Ah.

962
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:18,779
I'm not gonna lie to you.
That's gonna happen about half the time.

963
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:23,520
It's a volume business.

964
01:22:25,781 --> 01:22:28,814
- Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes, I would rather...

965
01:22:29,017 --> 01:22:30,544
Maybe later.

966
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:34,970
What are them drawings?
You some kind of devil worshipper?

967
01:22:35,959 --> 01:22:38,414
Don't you be putting a hex on me.
I'll cut you.

968
01:22:39,896 --> 01:22:42,830
- I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.

969
01:22:43,031 --> 01:22:45,268
Or, rather, I was.

970
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:57,405
One day I will build a machine
that will allow man to fly.

971
01:22:58,214 --> 01:23:00,450
Flying men? Where?

972
01:23:01,783 --> 01:23:05,329
- Nowhere.
- Where are the flying men?

973
01:23:05,554 --> 01:23:07,626
- Where are the flying men?
- Over there.

974
01:23:07,789 --> 01:23:09,993
The bird men are coming! I knew it!

975
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:13,093
The bird men are coming!
The bird men are coming!

976
01:23:13,296 --> 01:23:15,565
The birds! The bird men!

977
01:23:15,732 --> 01:23:17,619
Bird men! Birds!

978
01:23:26,909 --> 01:23:29,975
"I traveled the world for inspiration

979
01:23:30,178 --> 01:23:34,848
and found it in a man...
who lives what he dreams."

980
01:24:15,924 --> 01:24:18,859
- Phileas?
- No.

981
01:24:19,895 --> 01:24:22,316
Passepartout! Monique!

982
01:24:24,967 --> 01:24:25,982
Mr. Fogg.

983
01:24:28,537 --> 01:24:32,312
You crossed the Pacific Ocean.
For me?

984
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:36,470
- We will help you win your bet.
- Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.

985
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:41,028
- But why would you do this?
- Because you are our friend,

986
01:24:41,249 --> 01:24:43,999
and perhaps... more.

987
01:24:45,721 --> 01:24:49,201
More with her. You and me?
We just stick with friends.

988
01:24:51,426 --> 01:24:52,987
- Ooh.
- Oof!

989
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:57,155
Lord Kelvin, I can
offer you something much more precious

990
01:24:57,399 --> 01:24:59,471
than a single Jade Buddha.

991
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:03,312
Beneath Lanzhou are a series
of untapped jade reserves.

992
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:08,174
If the town were to be overrun,
those reserves would be ours.

993
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:09,554
I see.

994
01:25:09,676 --> 01:25:12,709
However, should Phileas Fogg
win this race,

995
01:25:12,912 --> 01:25:17,702
I will have neither the power nor
the means to hand over any arsenal.

996
01:25:17,984 --> 01:25:23,003
Then I will see to it personally
that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.

997
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:27,316
Very well.
Let us consider our deal to be...

998
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:32,677
Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.

999
01:25:32,867 --> 01:25:37,023
What's this blocking my jade reserves?
That will have to be demolished.

1000
01:25:37,303 --> 01:25:38,580
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1001
01:25:38,705 --> 01:25:40,592
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1002
01:25:41,775 --> 01:25:43,368
It's not that great.

1003
01:25:53,787 --> 01:25:56,983
Passepartout went
to get help hours ago.

1004
01:25:57,191 --> 01:25:59,427
What if he's lost, or...

1005
01:25:59,592 --> 01:26:01,316
Don't fret, my dear.

1006
01:26:01,461 --> 01:26:05,552
Passepartout's a warrior
with impeccable survival instincts.

1007
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:09,792
No doubt he'll return with help, and we
will board our train with time to spare.

1008
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:11,478
Agua.

1009
01:26:12,572 --> 01:26:15,256
Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.

1010
01:26:15,442 --> 01:26:16,652
Help!

1011
01:26:16,776 --> 01:26:18,598
- Help us!
- Help!

1012
01:26:18,746 --> 01:26:20,753
Ah! A rattlesnake!

1013
01:26:20,915 --> 01:26:21,897
Help!

1014
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:24,186
I don't want to die!

1015
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,489
Ah. Good morning.

1016
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:30,212
- Howdy.
- Hey.

1017
01:26:30,356 --> 01:26:32,658
Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.

1018
01:26:32,826 --> 01:26:36,601
How's about going someplace else?
You're blocking the path.

1019
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:38,740
Wilbur, it's him.

1020
01:26:40,768 --> 01:26:41,945
I'll be damned.

1021
01:26:43,636 --> 01:26:47,313
Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.
This is my brother, Wilbur.

1022
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,835
- We're big fans of yours.
- Fan's a strong word.

1023
01:26:51,077 --> 01:26:55,649
Better way to say it's we got a lot
of money riding on you to win your bet.

1024
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:58,153
We're gonna use
our winnings to build this.

1025
01:26:58,786 --> 01:27:01,600
Orville, maybe now is not the time.
Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.

1026
01:27:01,789 --> 01:27:06,328
Just one second. Forgive my brother.
He's got his head up in the clouds.

1027
01:27:06,593 --> 01:27:10,903
He's one of these dreamers who thinks
man's gonna go swooshing around

1028
01:27:11,164 --> 01:27:14,131
on the planet
like a little hummingbird.

1029
01:27:14,335 --> 01:27:16,985
Yeah, we're all gonna fly.
He thinks so, too.

1030
01:27:17,203 --> 01:27:20,073
It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.
He's kind of a moron.

1031
01:27:20,306 --> 01:27:24,561
He's mastered the cable steering system.
The drag-and-lift ratio.

1032
01:27:24,812 --> 01:27:26,721
- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.

1033
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,749
That's what I've been saying,
but Orville doesn't listen.

1034
01:27:29,949 --> 01:27:32,764
All that stuff about mastering...
That's what I say.

1035
01:27:32,952 --> 01:27:36,694
You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.

1036
01:27:36,923 --> 01:27:39,574
- But you told me...
- You gotta have confidence.

1037
01:27:39,759 --> 01:27:42,727
- You've got to speak up and support me.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1038
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:45,318
Have you come across our friend
on your way here?

1039
01:27:46,499 --> 01:27:48,441
Who are we looking for?

1040
01:27:48,635 --> 01:27:49,682
Passepartout.

1041
01:27:50,637 --> 01:27:52,742
You mean the crazy,
half-naked Chinese guy

1042
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:54,914
we saw running around,
where he was like...

1043
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:57,727
- Singing "Frère Jacques"?
- With a cow skull on his head?

1044
01:27:58,379 --> 01:27:59,808
- Possibly.
- Yes.

1045
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:03,208
- He's in the back of the wagon.
- Passepartout.

1046
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:05,838
- You are alive!
- Is that you, Grandma?

1047
01:28:09,589 --> 01:28:11,956
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck. Go win the bet.

1048
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:15,770
- No pressure, but you gotta win it.
- Bye.

1049
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:19,825
Now, you see, to get the real
classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.

1050
01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:22,488
I did.

1051
01:28:22,702 --> 01:28:24,590
"I did"? What's with the "I did"?

1052
01:28:24,771 --> 01:28:27,869
We're the Wright Brothers.
We did. Now go.

1053
01:28:28,174 --> 01:28:30,989
Hyah!

1054
01:28:37,117 --> 01:28:42,038
They're not going to make it!

1055
01:28:55,368 --> 01:28:58,216
Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!

1056
01:28:58,438 --> 01:29:00,805
So much to see! So little time!

1057
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:03,244
Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!

1058
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:05,297
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

1059
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:18,023
- We're never going to make it.
- Phileas Fogg?

1060
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:24,195
Autograph this for me?
It's for the wife.

1061
01:29:24,365 --> 01:29:28,259
Certainly. This business about me
robbing the Bank of England...

1062
01:29:28,534 --> 01:29:30,803
Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.

1063
01:29:32,906 --> 01:29:37,445
The boat. Follow me.
I know a shortcut. Make a lane!

1064
01:29:42,415 --> 01:29:44,270
Make a lane!

1065
01:29:53,193 --> 01:29:54,916
Where are we?

1066
01:29:55,663 --> 01:29:58,150
- Ah!
- Whoa!

1067
01:29:58,331 --> 01:30:02,488
- That's a big man.
- It is a lady. A French lady.

1068
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:06,197
She looks like an evil
Chinese warlord to me.

1069
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:20,332
Your journey has caused
quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,

1070
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:22,375
but I'm afraid it ends here.

1071
01:30:22,523 --> 01:30:25,141
Leave them alone.
This has nothing to do with them.

1072
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:28,828
On the contrary, Lau Xing,

1073
01:30:28,995 --> 01:30:33,218
Lord Kelvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.

1074
01:30:33,466 --> 01:30:35,376
Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,

1075
01:30:35,568 --> 01:30:38,568
they entail his... permanent detour.

1076
01:30:38,806 --> 01:30:40,366
I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,

1077
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:43,355
but to align himself
with such a little scoundrel!

1078
01:30:44,578 --> 01:30:47,229
You're not a scoundrel,
but you are quite small!

1079
01:30:49,482 --> 01:30:54,698
As in petite, but most definitely lethal
and generally very scary.

1080
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:59,045
One, two...

1081
01:30:59,959 --> 01:31:02,032
- Go!
- Three!

1082
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:09,806
- Go up there.
- Stop them.

1083
01:31:16,377 --> 01:31:18,744
Passepartout, my cane!

1084
01:31:22,148 --> 01:31:23,261
Uh, there.

1085
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,307
Passepartout!
Help! We are trapped!

1086
01:32:07,193 --> 01:32:08,720
Help!

1087
01:32:11,931 --> 01:32:14,746
Passepartout! Help!

1088
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:34,396
There you are!

1089
01:32:37,656 --> 01:32:40,023
You have a knife in your buttock.

1090
01:33:07,121 --> 01:33:09,292
It's the evil Chinese warlord!

1091
01:33:09,455 --> 01:33:10,764
- Ooh!
- Huh?

1092
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:13,061
She's coming!

1093
01:33:16,129 --> 01:33:17,852
The boat!

1094
01:33:17,997 --> 01:33:20,779
Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!

1095
01:33:21,934 --> 01:33:24,585
Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.

1096
01:33:43,356 --> 01:33:45,593
Wait, wait! What am I thinking?

1097
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:47,450
Passepartout can't defeat them.

1098
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:49,666
He's nine Tigers short.

1099
01:33:52,064 --> 01:33:56,701
Phileas, I do believe you are becoming
the man of my dreams.

1100
01:33:57,002 --> 01:33:59,424
When this is over,
let's hope the arms and legs

1101
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:02,454
of the man of your dreams
are still attached to the torso...

1102
01:34:02,642 --> 01:34:04,530
of the man of your dreams.

1103
01:34:31,771 --> 01:34:35,797
- You have failed to stop him.
- Then your death will have to suffice.

1104
01:34:55,628 --> 01:34:57,035
Let go of me!

1105
01:34:57,163 --> 01:35:00,938
The book! It's going to fall!
How can we save...

1106
01:35:01,167 --> 01:35:03,240
- Phileas?
- I will save him...

1107
01:35:03,436 --> 01:35:05,957
Wah!

1108
01:35:14,414 --> 01:35:16,039
Mr. Fogg!

1109
01:35:28,995 --> 01:35:30,784
No!

1110
01:35:43,143 --> 01:35:45,150
Oh. Passepartout?

1111
01:35:55,222 --> 01:35:57,524
Passepartout!

1112
01:35:57,691 --> 01:35:58,869
- Huh?
- You're alive!

1113
01:35:59,993 --> 01:36:02,448
Are you injured?

1114
01:36:06,999 --> 01:36:10,512
Yes, well, uh...
Rules are made to be broken.

1115
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:13,488
Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.

1116
01:36:13,673 --> 01:36:17,503
Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.
You'll lose your bet.

1117
01:36:17,777 --> 01:36:21,290
Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.

1118
01:36:31,658 --> 01:36:34,658
You must be the eleventh Tiger.

1119
01:36:35,195 --> 01:36:36,788
Meow!

1120
01:36:39,866 --> 01:36:45,103
- Let's go. We must catch the next ship.
- It would never reach London in time.

1121
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:51,075
No. No! No!

1122
01:36:51,277 --> 01:36:55,107
We are not giving up!
I almost died! You almost died!

1123
01:36:55,348 --> 01:36:58,610
We take the next ship
and win that bet!

1124
01:37:01,454 --> 01:37:03,756
Very well.

1125
01:37:03,924 --> 01:37:05,517
- Let's go.
- Yes!

1126
01:37:06,593 --> 01:37:08,186
Thank you.

1127
01:37:43,662 --> 01:37:46,532
Yes. Yes! Yes!

1128
01:37:48,335 --> 01:37:50,310
Oh, it's hopeless.

1129
01:37:50,503 --> 01:37:53,318
By those calculations,
I'm still behind by one day.

1130
01:37:53,506 --> 01:37:58,241
- There must be some way!
- Phileas Fogg on my boat?

1131
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:01,962
What an honor, sir!

1132
01:38:02,148 --> 01:38:05,760
I've quite a penny wagered on you.
The wife's none too happy about it.

1133
01:38:05,985 --> 01:38:10,622
Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile
since that shark almost devoured me.

1134
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:13,727
Got 'em both in one bite.

1135
01:38:29,376 --> 01:38:31,994
Ah, it's Inspector Fix!

1136
01:38:32,178 --> 01:38:35,691
My goodness! He made it
around the world before Fogg!

1137
01:38:36,516 --> 01:38:39,811
I came back from India
the short way, you ninny!

1138
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:44,687
I take it you don't have
Phileas Fogg in that valise.

1139
01:38:49,228 --> 01:38:50,984
A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?

1140
01:39:04,845 --> 01:39:07,333
That's the last
of the coal, Captain.

1141
01:39:17,725 --> 01:39:20,059
Mr. Fogg.

1142
01:39:20,227 --> 01:39:23,129
I'm sorry to say,
we've burnt the last of the coal.

1143
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:25,883
But I've had a word with the crew,

1144
01:39:26,067 --> 01:39:28,401
and all of them...

1145
01:39:29,169 --> 01:39:31,241
have agreed to burn their shoes.

1146
01:39:32,606 --> 01:39:34,777
The effort is appreciated, Captain.

1147
01:39:34,941 --> 01:39:37,756
Unfortunately,
we've gained a mere six hours.

1148
01:39:38,545 --> 01:39:43,182
- Even shoes cannot help us now.
- Must be something we can do.

1149
01:39:52,058 --> 01:39:55,320
That's it.
I've got it.

1150
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:57,678
Birds.

1151
01:39:57,797 --> 01:40:00,186
Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!

1152
01:40:00,367 --> 01:40:02,506
No, we'll fly to London.

1153
01:40:02,702 --> 01:40:06,281
We follow the laws of physics
mastered by the birds millennia ago

1154
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:10,315
and combine it with the Wright
Brothers' steering system.

1155
01:40:11,145 --> 01:40:13,512
Most people would laugh at you.

1156
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,996
But not us. We care about you.

1157
01:40:24,291 --> 01:40:27,640
Captain, I'm afraid
I have to ask permission

1158
01:40:27,861 --> 01:40:30,282
to dismantle your ship
to build this machine.

1159
01:40:30,463 --> 01:40:32,536
Dismantle Carmen?

1160
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,515
But she's me livelihood,
me most loyal companion.

1161
01:40:35,735 --> 01:40:36,913
Never, never, ever!

1162
01:40:37,071 --> 01:40:40,366
What if I could direct you
to an impeccable physician

1163
01:40:40,608 --> 01:40:43,608
who could replace both your nipples,
at my expense,

1164
01:40:43,843 --> 01:40:47,072
and I will give you enough money
to buy a brand-new ship?

1165
01:40:48,682 --> 01:40:51,202
You had me at the nipples.

1166
01:40:51,651 --> 01:40:55,612
- Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!
- Aye, aye, Captain!

1167
01:40:57,325 --> 01:40:58,732
One, two! One, two!

1168
01:41:04,965 --> 01:41:06,875
Timber!

1169
01:41:38,666 --> 01:41:41,154
I'll go sharpen the propeller.

1170
01:41:50,944 --> 01:41:52,667
Wrong way. Not looking.

1171
01:42:28,983 --> 01:42:30,925
Just one more.

1172
01:42:31,084 --> 01:42:33,767
That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!

1173
01:42:33,953 --> 01:42:38,296
The Greenwich time zone. The last time
I shall set my watch ahead.

1174
01:42:38,726 --> 01:42:40,831
Well...

1175
01:42:40,995 --> 01:42:43,842
- Shall we fly?
- Let's.

1176
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:48,725
Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!

1177
01:42:49,002 --> 01:42:50,944
Hurrah!

1178
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,526
Inspiring words.

1179
01:42:55,675 --> 01:42:59,091
- Very well. Prepare for takeoff!
- Yes, sir!

1180
01:43:12,826 --> 01:43:15,925
- Mr. Fogg, are you sure?
- No!

1181
01:43:17,797 --> 01:43:19,902
Whoa!

1182
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:29,430
How the hell are we getting back?

1183
01:43:29,642 --> 01:43:32,392
Whoa!

1184
01:43:35,281 --> 01:43:37,550
- Now!
- Ohhh!

1185
01:43:44,457 --> 01:43:47,654
You did it, Phileas! We are flying!

1186
01:43:47,827 --> 01:43:50,478
My God! It's...

1187
01:43:51,598 --> 01:43:52,808
magical!

1188
01:43:53,534 --> 01:43:56,665
- Better than your dreams?
- Better than my dreams.

1189
01:43:56,904 --> 01:43:58,660
Hey! Don't forget to steer!

1190
01:44:19,727 --> 01:44:22,094
It's a...

1191
01:44:22,263 --> 01:44:24,368
a telegram from...

1192
01:44:24,532 --> 01:44:26,539
General Fang, sir.

1193
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,828
We're going to make it!

1194
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:43,085
- This all right?
- Oh, dear.

1195
01:44:43,249 --> 01:44:46,697
- This is exactly like a dream I had.
- You dream of winning the race?

1196
01:44:46,953 --> 01:44:51,590
- No, of crashing to my death.
- Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.

1197
01:44:54,594 --> 01:44:56,864
- Look up there!
- Great Scott!

1198
01:44:57,031 --> 01:44:59,071
Look! A flying machine!

1199
01:44:59,799 --> 01:45:03,182
- Don't step on the wing!
- It's Phileas Fogg!

1200
01:45:04,471 --> 01:45:07,667
Sir, rumor has it a flying machine
is heading for the Royal Academy,

1201
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:09,980
our bank thief at the pedals.

1202
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:12,697
Some people will believe anything.

1203
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,301
A flying machine is
heading for the Academy!

1204
01:45:15,481 --> 01:45:19,376
- The bank thief is pedaling!
- See what I mean?

1205
01:45:19,618 --> 01:45:21,473
Help!

1206
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:23,923
Well done, Passepartout!

1207
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:25,984
The wing ropes!

1208
01:45:27,328 --> 01:45:31,321
Just a minor setback.
Another minor setback.

1209
01:45:32,498 --> 01:45:36,175
All right, this is a major setback.

1210
01:45:36,836 --> 01:45:39,291
A flying machine is headed
for the Royal Academy,

1211
01:45:39,505 --> 01:45:42,320
and witnesses swear
that it's Phileas Fogg.

1212
01:45:44,044 --> 01:45:47,339
Faster, Passepartout! Faster!

1213
01:45:47,548 --> 01:45:50,101
- We're losing altitude!
- Landing gear?

1214
01:45:50,283 --> 01:45:52,739
That would have been
an excellent idea!

1215
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:58,097
The bird men are here!

1216
01:46:01,195 --> 01:46:04,097
No. I will not lose this wager!

1217
01:46:04,297 --> 01:46:08,488
He is not to reach the top step.
Get the police. Here. Now!

1218
01:46:08,735 --> 01:46:11,866
I want Fogg arrested the moment
his feet touch British soil!

1219
01:46:12,106 --> 01:46:13,316
Oh!

1220
01:46:13,474 --> 01:46:15,328
- I'm sorry...
- Right in my ear!

1221
01:46:15,476 --> 01:46:18,345
Passepartout, get back in your seat.

1222
01:46:18,578 --> 01:46:21,360
We're going to return to the ground!

1223
01:46:27,154 --> 01:46:29,293
Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!

1224
01:46:30,089 --> 01:46:32,511
Why are they fleeing?

1225
01:46:32,692 --> 01:46:34,765
Cowards!

1226
01:46:39,532 --> 01:46:40,939
Hold on!

1227
01:47:11,831 --> 01:47:13,719
Make it to the top step!

1228
01:47:13,866 --> 01:47:16,615
- New Zealand. We didn't go there.
- Top step.

1229
01:47:16,836 --> 01:47:19,836
Arrest them!
They robbed the Bank of England!

1230
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:23,904
No, no!
Nonsense! Where is your proof?

1231
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:26,729
This is the Royal Academy of Science!

1232
01:47:26,914 --> 01:47:29,816
We don't need to prove anything!

1233
01:47:30,016 --> 01:47:33,148
Besides which,
by the time you get out of jail,

1234
01:47:33,353 --> 01:47:35,742
you'll have lost the wager.

1235
01:47:40,794 --> 01:47:42,288
Noon.

1236
01:47:42,428 --> 01:47:43,737
We did our best.

1237
01:47:45,297 --> 01:47:49,258
Out of me way! Move it!
I used to be somebody important!

1238
01:47:49,969 --> 01:47:52,173
Should have thrown him
through a higher window.

1239
01:47:52,372 --> 01:47:55,022
- Get off!
- Get rid of this buffoon!

1240
01:47:55,209 --> 01:47:59,616
That's the thanks I get for going
halfway around the world to stop Fogg?

1241
01:48:00,946 --> 01:48:05,005
He also sent a Chinese warlord
to kill Phileas Fogg!

1242
01:48:05,251 --> 01:48:06,877
That's right. He did!

1243
01:48:08,389 --> 01:48:10,560
Lies! All of it!

1244
01:48:14,327 --> 01:48:15,407
- Kitchner!
- Yes?

1245
01:48:16,295 --> 01:48:18,913
- Tell them!
- Oh, well, yes, uh...

1246
01:48:19,098 --> 01:48:22,393
- Well, the thing of it...
- You mumbling moron!

1247
01:48:22,635 --> 01:48:24,904
Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.

1248
01:48:25,104 --> 01:48:27,951
I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!

1249
01:48:28,142 --> 01:48:31,076
- Rhodes!
- The thing of it is,

1250
01:48:31,844 --> 01:48:33,731
I don't want to make a fuss.

1251
01:48:33,881 --> 01:48:37,558
You spineless cretins!

1252
01:48:37,785 --> 01:48:42,389
That man stuck me with quills!
Bunches of them!

1253
01:48:42,655 --> 01:48:46,201
Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!

1254
01:48:46,459 --> 01:48:51,544
It's true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered lord.

1255
01:48:51,799 --> 01:48:54,799
- No!
- Oh, boo-hoo!

1256
01:48:55,001 --> 01:48:58,100
So what if I did
try to kill Phileas Fogg?

1257
01:48:58,604 --> 01:49:01,800
What are you gutless peons
going to do about it?

1258
01:49:02,008 --> 01:49:05,718
I hold all the power!
I run everything!

1259
01:49:05,945 --> 01:49:11,063
So which of you half-wits
is going to stop me? You? You? You?

1260
01:49:11,351 --> 01:49:14,384
- The queen!
- The queen?

1261
01:49:14,588 --> 01:49:17,338
Oh, the queen!

1262
01:49:17,523 --> 01:49:21,484
That inbred, antiquated old cow!

1263
01:49:21,728 --> 01:49:26,550
The only way she could stop me
is if she sat on me!

1264
01:49:27,767 --> 01:49:31,215
With her big, fat royal bottom!

1265
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:37,463
She's behind me, isn't she?

1266
01:49:38,244 --> 01:49:40,415
Oh, Your Majesty.

1267
01:49:40,581 --> 01:49:44,771
I have just apprehended the culprits
who robbed the Bank of England.

1268
01:49:45,018 --> 01:49:47,352
- No, Majesty!
- Rubbish!

1269
01:49:49,055 --> 01:49:50,965
Quiet!

1270
01:49:52,392 --> 01:49:54,759
I love being able to do that.

1271
01:49:54,927 --> 01:49:57,480
So, Lord Kelvin,

1272
01:49:57,663 --> 01:50:01,111
unsportsmanlike conduct,
attempted murder,

1273
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:04,399
trading my arsenal for Buddhas.

1274
01:50:04,637 --> 01:50:07,026
How do you know about that?
I never said...

1275
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,430
Admit it. You've been
a naughty boy, haven't you?

1276
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:18,934
Your Majesty, I assure you,
there is an explanation for all of this.

1277
01:50:19,218 --> 01:50:21,487
What it was, was, was...

1278
01:50:21,654 --> 01:50:24,654
I was... I... I was simply...

1279
01:50:24,857 --> 01:50:26,450
simply...

1280
01:50:28,361 --> 01:50:30,085
Why do they always run?

1281
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:31,690
Arrest him.

1282
01:50:31,831 --> 01:50:36,468
Get out of my way, you fools!
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?

1283
01:50:37,604 --> 01:50:41,084
I'll kill you!
I'll have you for this, Fogg!

1284
01:50:41,341 --> 01:50:45,847
So, is this Phileas Fogg's
miraculous flying invention?

1285
01:50:46,712 --> 01:50:49,363
Your Majesty, we all invented it.

1286
01:50:49,549 --> 01:50:53,094
I'm very impressed,
and that doesn't happen often.

1287
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,597
Thank you.

1288
01:50:54,721 --> 01:50:58,201
But still, we failed
to help Phileas win his bet.

1289
01:51:00,026 --> 01:51:03,823
- I'm sorry, Phileas.
- Don't be, my chéri.

1290
01:51:04,064 --> 01:51:08,123
I saw the world.
I learnt of new cultures.

1291
01:51:08,367 --> 01:51:10,603
I flew across an ocean.

1292
01:51:10,803 --> 01:51:12,396
I wore women's clothing.

1293
01:51:13,372 --> 01:51:15,543
Oh?

1294
01:51:16,643 --> 01:51:18,977
Made a friend.

1295
01:51:20,513 --> 01:51:23,066
Fell in love.

1296
01:51:23,249 --> 01:51:26,413
- Who cares if I lost a wager?
- I do.

1297
01:51:26,619 --> 01:51:32,249
- I've got 20 quid riding on you.
- Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.

1298
01:51:32,558 --> 01:51:35,973
Correct. Which gives you
24 hours remaining.

1299
01:51:36,863 --> 01:51:39,612
- Could we have miscounted?
- No.

1300
01:51:39,799 --> 01:51:43,541
I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour
as we passed each time zone.

1301
01:51:45,105 --> 01:51:47,494
The international date line.

1302
01:51:47,707 --> 01:51:50,555
We set our watches forward
at 20 more time zones, so...

1303
01:51:50,776 --> 01:51:53,645
here it's still day 79.

1304
01:51:53,847 --> 01:51:56,400
- So, we've...
- We've won!

1305
01:52:03,623 --> 01:52:05,085
We won, we won...

1306
01:52:05,224 --> 01:52:07,744
Thank God. Ah!

1307
01:52:12,265 --> 01:52:15,200
Your Majesty, I...
I apologize. Do forgive me.

1308
01:52:15,401 --> 01:52:19,329
- I quite forgot myself.
- Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.

1309
01:52:19,605 --> 01:52:22,540
I shall need a new minister of science.

1310
01:52:25,144 --> 01:52:28,854
Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.

1311
01:52:31,351 --> 01:52:33,620
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1312
01:52:34,754 --> 01:52:38,169
Go!

1313
01:52:43,463 --> 01:52:45,350
- We won, Phileas! We won!
- Yes!

1314
01:52:45,532 --> 01:52:47,125
We won!

1315
01:52:49,635 --> 01:52:51,577
Oh, well done!

1316
01:52:58,578 --> 01:52:59,788
Go ahead.
