Quiet, missy.

6
00:00:57,846 --> 00:01:00,222
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

7
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:02,557
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

8
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,435
Mr Gibbs, that will do.

9
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,105
She was singing about pirates.

10
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:09,272
Bad luck to be
singing about pirates

11
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:12,527
with us mired in this
unnatural fog, mark my words.

12
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,945
Consider them marked.

13
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:18,115
- On your way.
- Aye, lieutenant.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,284
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board too.

15
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,577
Even a miniature one.

16
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:26,164
I think it'd be rather
exciting to meet a pirate.

17
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:29,961
Think again, Miss Swann.

18
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,880
Vile and dissolute
creatures, the lot of them.

19
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:36,092
I intend to see to it that any
man who sails under a pirate flag

20
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:38,760
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

21
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,140
A short drop and a sudden stop.

22
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:48,812
Lieutenant Norrington, I
appreciate your fervour,

23
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:51,291
but I'm concerned
about the effect this

24
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,484
subject will have
upon my daughter.

25
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:55,360
My apologies, Governor Swann.

26
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,655
Actually, I find
it all fascinating.

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,488
Yes. That's what concerns me.

28
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,187
Look. A boy. There's
a boy in the water.

29
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,608
Man overboard.

30
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,569
Man the ropes. Fetch a hook.

31
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,738
Haul him aboard.

32
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:50,207
He's still breathing.

33
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,542
Mary, Mother of God.

34
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,551
What happened here?

35
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,773
Most likely the powder magazine.

36
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:05,763
Merchant vessels
run heavily armed.

37
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,390
Lot of good it did them.

38
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:12,062
Everyone's thinking
it, I'm just saying it.

39
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,147
Pirates.

40
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,067
There's no proof of that.

41
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,650
It was probably an accident.

42
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,029
Rouse the captain.

43
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:23,989
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

44
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,741
- Launch the boats.
- Heave to.

45
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,247
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

46
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:32,749
He'll be in your charge.

47
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,459
Take care of him.

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,437
It's ok.

49
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:58,274
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

50
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,027
Will Turner.

51
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,947
I'm watching over you, Will.

52
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:18,711
You're a pirate.

53
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:20,714
Has he said anything?

54
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,382
His name's William Turner.

55
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,966
That's all I found out.

56
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,178
Take him below.

57
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,374
Elizabeth.

58
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,377
Are you all right?

59
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:43,921
Are you decent?

60
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:45,548
Yes.

61
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:46,591
Yes?

62
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:49,552
Still in bed at this hour?

63
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:53,889
It's a beautiful day.

64
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,977
I have a gift for you.

65
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,897
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

66
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,987
May I inquire as to the occasion?

67
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,488
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

68
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,616
Go on.

69
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,579
Actually, I...

70
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,875
I had hoped you might wear
it for the ceremony today.

71
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,210
Ceremony?

72
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,671
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

73
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:26,922
I knew it.

74
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:30,300
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

75
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:32,302
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

76
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,596
He fancies you, you know.

77
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,683
Elizabeth?

78
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,434
How's it coming?

79
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:41,103
It's difficult to say.

80
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,439
I'm told it's the latest
fashion in London.

81
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:44,856
Well, women in London

82
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,608
must've learnt not to breathe.

83
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:50,447
My Lord, you have a visitor.

84
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:09,965
Ah, Mr Turner.

85
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,467
Good to see you again.

86
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,385
Good day, sir.

87
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:15,470
I have your order.

88
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,144
Well...

89
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:23,979
The blade is folded steel.

90
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:27,065
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

91
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:29,026
If I may?

92
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,653
Perfectly balanced.

93
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,741
The tang is nearly the
full width of the blade.

94
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,829
Impressive. Very impressive.

95
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,206
Very nice.

96
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:45,875
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

97
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:49,505
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

98
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:52,673
I shall.

99
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:57,471
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

100
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:02,475
Elizabeth. You look
absolutely stunning.

101
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,352
Will.

102
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:07,522
It's so good to see you.

103
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:09,273
I had a dream about
you last night.

104
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,358
About me?

105
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,111
Is it entirely proper for you...?

106
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,986
About the day we
met. Do you remember?

107
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,864
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

108
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,409
How many times must I ask
you to call me Elizabeth?

109
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,787
At least once more, Miss Swann.

110
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,704
As always.

111
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,040
Now, you see?

112
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,375
At least the boy has
a sense of propriety.

113
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,710
We really must be going.

114
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:29,753
Come on.

115
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:32,380
Good day, Mr Turner.

116
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:34,967
Come along.

117
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:39,553
Good day...

118
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:43,892
Elizabeth.

119
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,275
Hold up there, you.

120
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:21,279
It's a shilling to tie
up your boat to the dock.

121
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:24,991
And I shall need
to know your name.

122
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:29,956
What do you say to
three shillings,

123
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,249
and we forget the name?

124
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,920
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr Smith.

125
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,208
Two paces... march.

126
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,756
Right about... face.

127
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:25,052
Present... arms.

128
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:52,079
This dock is off-limits
to civilians.

129
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:53,913
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

130
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:56,667
If I see one, I shall
inform you immediately.

131
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,174
Apparently, there's
some high-toned

132
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,881
and fancy to-do up at the fort?

133
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,094
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

134
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,138
did not merit an invitation?

135
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:12,391
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.

136
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,811
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

137
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,854
But it seems to me, a...

138
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:18,688
A ship like that...

139
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,776
makes this one here a
bit superfluous, really.

140
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,944
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

141
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:28,948
but there's no ship that can
match the Interceptor for speed.

142
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,075
I've heard of one.

143
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,786
It's supposed to be very
fast, nigh uncatchable.

144
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,622
The Black Pearl.

145
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,665
There's no real ship

146
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,419
that can match the Interceptor.

147
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,131
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

148
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:45,799
No. No, it's not.

149
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,175
Yes, it is. I've seen it.

150
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,011
You've seen it?

151
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:51,972
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it.

152
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:54,764
- Yes, I have.
- You've seen a ship

153
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,812
with black sails,

154
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,562
that's crewed by the damned,

155
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,147
and captained by a man so evil

156
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,817
that hell itself
spat him back out?

157
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,861
No.

158
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,030
But I have seen a
ship with black sails.

159
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:12,992
Oh... And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

160
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,829
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

161
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,497
could possibly have black sails,

162
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,833
therefore couldn't
possibly be any other ship

163
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,335
than the Black Pearl, is
that what you're saying?

164
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:24,504
No.

165
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:25,838
Like I said,

166
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:29,134
there's no real ship that
can match the Interceptor...

167
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:32,596
Hey.

168
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:35,058
You.

169
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,225
Get away from there.

170
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,685
You don't have permission
to be aboard there.

171
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,439
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

172
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,522
Ship.

173
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,275
What's your name?

174
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,357
Smith.

175
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,152
Or Smithy, if you like.

176
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,489
What's your purpose in
Port Royal, Mr Smith?

177
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:51,532
Yeah, and no lies.

178
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:53,075
All right then.

179
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
I confess.

180
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,871
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

181
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:01,373
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and
pilfer my weasely black guts out.

182
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,333
I said, no lies.

183
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,296
I think he's telling the truth.

184
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,921
If he were telling the truth,

185
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,257
he wouldn't have told us.

186
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,940
Unless he knew you
wouldn't believe

187
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,760
the truth, even if
he told it to you.

188
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,856
May I have a moment?

189
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:35,574
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

190
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,411
Yes.

191
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:41,164
I apologise if I seem forward,

192
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,334
but I must speak my mind.

193
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,214
This promotion throws
into sharp relief

194
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,215
that which I have
not yet achieved.

195
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,430
A marriage to a fine woman.

196
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,642
You have become a
fine woman, Elizabeth.

197
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:02,602
I can't breathe.

198
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:04,478
Yes, I...

199
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,064
I'm a bit nervous myself.

200
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,651
And then they made me their chief.

201
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:14,656
Elizabeth?

202
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,368
Elizabeth.

203
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,330
The rocks. Sir, it's a
miracle she missed them.

204
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,128
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim.

205
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,297
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are.

206
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,050
Do not lose these.

207
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:49,732
What was that?

208
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:26,017
Make way.

209
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:33,566
I got her.

210
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,111
She's not breathing.

211
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,196
Move.

212
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,038
I never would've thought of that.

213
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,372
Clearly you've never
been to Singapore.

214
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:55,590
Where did you get that?

215
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,011
On your feet.

216
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,638
Elizabeth.

217
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:05,973
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

218
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:13,523
- Shoot him.
- Father. Commodore...

219
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,608
do you intend to kill my rescuer?

220
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,785
I believe thanks are in order.

221
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,250
Had a brush with the East
India Trading Company, did we?

222
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:33,584
Pirate?

223
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,129
Hang him.

224
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:38,964
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

225
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:41,552
Well, well.

226
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,096
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

227
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,807
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

228
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,768
Well, I don't see your ship...

229
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:49,976
captain.

230
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:52,437
I'm in the market, as it were.

231
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,481
He said he'd come
to commandeer one.

232
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:57,359
I told you he was telling the
truth. These are his, sir.

233
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:03,949
No additional shots nor powder.

234
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,620
A compass that
doesn't point north.

235
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,293
And I half expected
it to be made of wood.

236
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,716
You are, without doubt, the
worst pirate I've heard of.

237
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,134
But you have heard of me.

238
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,639
Commodore, I really must protest.

239
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,307
Carefully, lieutenant.

240
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,643
Pirate or not, this
man saved my life.

241
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,510
One good deed is
not enough to redeem

242
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,190
a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

243
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:37,982
But it seems enough
to condemn him.

244
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,526
Indeed.

245
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,779
Finally.

246
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,156
Wait, don't shoot.

247
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,532
I knew you'd warm up to me.

248
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:49,412
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

249
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,163
And my hat.

250
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,122
Commodore.

251
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,929
Elizabeth. It is
Elizabeth, isn't it?

252
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,004
It's Miss Swann.

253
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:01,673
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

254
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:04,343
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

255
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,096
Now, if you'll be very kind.

256
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,529
Easy on the goods, darling.

257
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,365
You're despicable.

258
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,494
Sticks and stones, love.

259
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,119
I saved your life, you save mine.

260
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,204
We're square.

261
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,413
Gentlemen...

262
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:36,958
my lady...

263
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,377
you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

264
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,881
Captain Jack Sparrow.

265
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,399
Whoa.

266
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:02,942
Now, will you shoot him?

267
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,694
Open fire.

268
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,410
Burn his heels.

269
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,547
Take steady aim.

270
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,921
Fire.

271
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:30,846
Take cover, men.

272
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,847
Gillette...

273
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,767
Mr Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

274
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,143
I would hate for him to miss it.

275
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,566
Search upstairs.

276
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,111
Look lively, men.

277
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,612
Whoa.

278
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,497
Right where I left you.

279
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,880
Not where I left you.

280
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:42,309
You're the one they're hunting.

281
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:44,478
The pirate.

282
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,357
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

283
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,069
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

284
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,193
Ah...

285
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,904
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

286
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,490
So if you'll excuse me...

287
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:02,161
Do you think this wise, boy?

288
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:06,290
Crossing blades with a pirate?

289
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,751
You threatened Miss Swann.

290
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:12,131
Only a little.

291
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:28,897
You know what you're doing, I'll
give you that. Excellent form.

292
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:31,482
But how's your footwork?

293
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,652
If I step here...

294
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:36,447
Very good.

295
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,574
And now I step again.

296
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:44,621
Ta.

297
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,184
That is a wonderful trick.

298
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:11,148
Except, once again, you are
between me and my way out.

299
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,356
And now...

300
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,400
you have no weapon.

301
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:38,382
Who makes all these?

302
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:41,179
I do.

303
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,513
And I practise with them...

304
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:45,182
three hours a day.

305
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:49,185
You need to find
yourself a girl, mate.

306
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:58,778
Or... perhaps the reason you
practise three hours a day

307
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,697
is that you already found one,

308
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,368
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

309
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:06,870
You're not a eunuch, are you?

310
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:09,915
I practise three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

311
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,374
I can kill him.

312
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,661
You cheated.

313
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:30,994
Pirate.

314
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:36,626
- Move away.
- No.

315
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:38,044
Please move?

316
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:39,129
No.

317
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,965
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

318
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,509
This shot is not meant for you.

319
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:58,856
There he is. Over here.

320
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,816
Excellent work, Mr Brown.

321
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,697
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

322
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:09,074
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

323
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:12,662
I trust you will always
remember that this is the day

324
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:16,165
Captain Jack Sparrow
almost escaped.

325
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,958
Take him away.

326
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:25,173
- Come here, boy.
- Smell it?

327
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:28,552
- Come here, boy.
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

328
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:30,763
- Hey.
- Come here, boy.

329
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:33,348
- Come here, boy.
- You can keep doing that forever.

330
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,642
The dog is never going to move.

331
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:37,949
Well, excuse us if
we haven't resigned

332
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,980
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

333
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:42,441
Come on.

334
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:47,988
There you go, miss.

335
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,825
It was a difficult
day for you, I'm sure.

336
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,536
I suspected Commodore
Norrington would propose,

337
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,205
but I must admit, I wasn't
entirely prepared for it.

338
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,541
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate.

339
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,833
Sounds terrifying.

340
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:03,337
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

341
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,381
But... the Commodore proposed.

342
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:07,048
Fancy that.

343
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,717
Now that's a smart match, miss,

344
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,927
if it's not too bold to say.

345
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:12,388
It is a smart match.

346
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,348
He's a fine man.

347
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:19,146
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

348
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:22,356
Well, that WillTurner,

349
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,566
he's a fine man too.

350
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:26,402
That is too bold.

351
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:28,571
Well, begging your pardon, miss.

352
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:30,280
It was not my place.

353
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,332
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

354
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,123
No, she hasn't.

355
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,503
Well, she has had
a very trying day.

356
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,339
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

357
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:32,300
Bleak. Really bleak.

358
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,096
What's that?

359
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,056
Cannon fire.

360
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:41,309
Return fire.

361
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:44,396
I know those guns.

362
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,361
It's the Pearl.

363
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,155
Black Pearl?

364
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:57,283
I've heard stories.

365
00:29:57,326 --> 00:30:01,328
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

366
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:02,998
Never leaves any survivors.

367
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,499
No survivors.

368
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:07,377
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

369
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,432
Clear the dock.

370
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:33,652
Mama.

371
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:41,870
Hoist your oars.

372
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,127
Come on, you.

373
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:41,721
Sight the muzzle flash.

374
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:42,764
Aim for the flashes.

375
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,933
I need a full
spread, fore and aft.

376
00:31:44,975 --> 00:31:46,642
Mr Stevens, more cartridges.

377
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,647
Governor. Barricade
yourself in my office.

378
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:52,606
Good God.

379
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,274
That's an order.

380
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,503
Don't.

381
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:15,462
Hello, chum.

382
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,261
Up there. Go.

383
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,690
Miss. They've come to kidnap you.

384
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:36,316
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter.

385
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,569
In here.

386
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,391
They haven't seen
you. Hide, and the

387
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,574
first chance you
get, run to the fort.

388
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,710
Got ya. Haven't I?

389
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:01,716
No. No. It's hot.

390
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,678
- I'm burning.
- Come on.

391
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:09,474
Come on, me lads.

392
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:38,670
Come out.

393
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:50,473
We know you're here, poppet.

394
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,725
Poppet.

395
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:53,852
Come out...

396
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,981
and we promise we won't hurt you.

397
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,069
We will find you, poppet.

398
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:05,530
You've got something of ours,

399
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:07,365
and it calls to us.

400
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:15,582
The gold calls to us.

401
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,793
The gold.

402
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:25,966
Hello, poppet.

403
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:27,512
Parley.

404
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:29,429
What?

405
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:30,639
Parley.

406
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:32,139
I invoke the right of parley.

407
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:34,159
According to the
code of Brethren, set

408
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,144
down by pirates Morgan
and Bartholomew,

409
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:38,303
you have to take
me to your captain.

410
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:39,314
I know the code.

411
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,107
If an adversary demands
parley, you can do them no harm

412
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,944
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code.

413
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,987
She wants to be
taken to the captain.

414
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:50,784
And she'll go, without a fuss.

415
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:54,869
We must honour the code.

416
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:06,882
Say goodbye.

417
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:12,847
Goodbye.

418
00:35:16,976 --> 00:35:18,771
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

419
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:21,399
Well.

420
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:29,779
Out of my way, scum.

421
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:45,336
My sympathies, friend. You've
no manner of luck at all.

422
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:11,114
Come on, doggy. It's
just you and me now.

423
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,574
It's you and old Jack. Come on.

424
00:36:13,658 --> 00:36:15,368
Come on. That's a boy.

425
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:17,578
Good boy. Come get your bone.

426
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:21,540
That's a good boy. Come on,
a bit closer, a bit closer.

427
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,667
That's it. That's it, doggy.

428
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,130
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur.

429
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:30,049
Don't do that. No, no, no.

430
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:31,759
I didn't mean it. I didn't...

431
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:40,184
This ain't the armoury.

432
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,104
Well, well, well.

433
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,065
Look what we have here, Twigg.

434
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:48,235
Captain Jack Sparrow.

435
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,569
Last time I saw you,

436
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,405
you were all alone

437
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,242
on a godforsaken island,

438
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:58,495
shrinking into the distance.

439
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,079
His fortunes aren't improved much.

440
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:04,584
Worry about your own
fortunes, gentlemen.

441
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:07,670
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

442
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:09,296
and mutineers.

443
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:14,927
So there is a curse.

444
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,013
That's interesting.

445
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:20,350
You know nothing of hell.

446
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,025
That's very interesting.

447
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:09,022
I didn't know we was
taking on captives.

448
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:12,151
She's invoked the right of
parley with Captain Barbossa.

449
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:16,070
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to.

450
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:19,158
And ye will not
lay a hand on those

451
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,618
under the protection of parley.

452
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:23,412
Aye, sir.

453
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:28,042
My apologies, miss.

454
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:30,461
Captain Barbossa,

455
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:32,775
I am here to negotiate
the cessation

456
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:34,924
of hostilities against Port Royal.

457
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,089
A lot of long words
in there, miss.

458
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,054
We are nought but humble pirates.

459
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,724
What is it that you want?

460
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:45,100
I want you to leave
and never come back.

461
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:50,189
I'm disinclined to
acquiesce to your request.

462
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:54,108
Means "no."

463
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:56,528
Very well.

464
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,116
I'll drop it.

465
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:09,791
Me holds are bursting with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?

466
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,918
Why?

467
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:14,338
It's what you've
been searching for.

468
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,047
I recognise the ship.

469
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:19,008
I saw it eight years ago on
the crossing from England.

470
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,220
Did you now?

471
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:24,222
Fine.

472
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:26,809
I suppose if it is worthless,

473
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:28,727
then there's no point
in me keeping it.

474
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,062
No.

475
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,074
You have a name, missy?

476
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,243
Elizabeth...

477
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:46,661
Turner.

478
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,873
I'm a maid in the
governor's household.

479
00:39:53,168 --> 00:39:54,586
Miss Turner.

480
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:57,046
Turner.

481
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:58,506
Bootstrap.

482
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:05,221
And how does a maid come to
own a trinket such as that?

483
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,849
Family heirloom, perhaps?

484
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:10,436
I didn't steal it, if
that's what you mean.

485
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:15,105
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

486
00:40:15,189 --> 00:40:16,399
and ne'er return.

487
00:40:30,122 --> 00:40:31,122
Our bargain?

488
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:35,961
Still the guns and stow them.

489
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:38,839
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

490
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,631
Wait. You have to
take me to shore.

491
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:43,301
According to the code of
the order of the Brethren...

492
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:45,220
Your return to shore
was not part of

493
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:47,055
our negotiations
nor our agreements,

494
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:48,307
so I must do nothing.

495
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:51,477
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

496
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,144
and you're not, and thirdly...

497
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:55,939
the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

498
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:57,482
instead of actual rules.

499
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:59,941
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

500
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:01,486
Miss Turner.

501
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,591
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

502
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:26,763
Mr Murtogg, remove this man.

503
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:29,931
We have to hunt them
down. We must save her.

504
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:32,056
And where do you propose we start?

505
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:35,384
If you have any
information concerning

506
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:36,978
my daughter, please share it.

507
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:41,025
That Jack Sparrow.

508
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,362
He talked about the Black Pearl.

509
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:45,321
Mentioned it is more what he did.

510
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:50,034
Ask him where it is. Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

511
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,577
No.

512
00:41:51,662 --> 00:41:54,956
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

513
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,041
ergo they are not his allies.

514
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:01,087
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

515
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:03,047
That's not good enough.

516
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,049
Mr Turner...

517
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:08,636
you are not a military
man, you are not a sailor.

518
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:11,056
You are a blacksmith.

519
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,933
And this is not the
moment for rash actions.

520
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:19,229
Do not make the mistake of
thinking you are the only man here

521
00:42:19,313 --> 00:42:20,816
who cares for Elizabeth.

522
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:28,572
Please...

523
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,162
You. Sparrow.

524
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:35,246
Aye?

525
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,914
You are familiar with that
ship, the Black Pearl?

526
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:39,332
I've heard of it.

527
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:42,086
Where does it make berth?

528
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:45,046
Have you not heard the stories?

529
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,718
Captain Barbossa

530
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,511
and his crew of miscreants

531
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:53,181
sail from the dreaded
Isla de Muerte.

532
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:56,059
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

533
00:42:56,102 --> 00:42:59,186
by those who already
know where it is.

534
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,937
The ship's real enough,

535
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,441
therefore its anchorage must
be a real place. Where is it?

536
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:06,611
Why ask me?

537
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:08,863
Because you're a pirate.

538
00:43:08,946 --> 00:43:11,616
And you want to turn pirate
yourself. Is that it?

539
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:13,868
Never.

540
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:19,290
They took Miss Swann.

541
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,167
Oh. So it is that
you found a girl.

542
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:23,043
I see.

543
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,881
If you're intending to brave
all, hasten to her rescue,

544
00:43:25,965 --> 00:43:27,924
and so win fair lady's heart...

545
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:30,593
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

546
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:32,719
I see no profit in it for me.

547
00:43:33,804 --> 00:43:35,056
I can get you out of here.

548
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,806
How's that? The key's run off.

549
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,475
I helped build these cells.

550
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,312
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

551
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:45,899
With the right leverage, and the
proper application of strength,

552
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:48,444
the door will lift free.

553
00:43:50,822 --> 00:43:52,072
What's your name?

554
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:54,074
Will Turner.

555
00:43:55,368 --> 00:43:57,703
That would be short
for William, I imagine.

556
00:43:57,788 --> 00:43:58,954
Good, strong name.

557
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:01,872
No doubt named for your father?

558
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:04,584
Yes.

559
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:06,586
Huh.

560
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:08,797
Well, Mr Turner,

561
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:10,048
I've changed me mind.

562
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:13,718
If you spring me from this
cell, I swear, on pain of death,

563
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:16,012
I shall take you
to the Black Pearl,

564
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:17,722
and your bonny lass.

565
00:44:17,808 --> 00:44:19,809
Do we have an accord?

566
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:25,146
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

567
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:26,356
Get me out.

568
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,137
Hurry. Someone will
have heard that.

569
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:33,655
Not without my effects.

570
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:41,746
We're going to steal the ship?

571
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:44,541
That ship?

572
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,457
Commandeer.

573
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,795
We're going to
commandeer that ship.

574
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:49,964
Nautical term.

575
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:52,716
One question about
your business, boy,

576
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,217
or there's no use going.

577
00:44:54,302 --> 00:44:55,801
This girl...

578
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:58,595
how far are you willing
to go to save her?

579
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,016
I'd die for her.

580
00:45:00,058 --> 00:45:01,265
Oh, good.

581
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:03,351
No worries then.

582
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,914
This is either
madness or brilliance.

583
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:29,336
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

584
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,786
Everyone stay calm. We're
taking over the ship.

585
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,579
Aye. Avast.

586
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,126
This ship cannot be
crewed by two men.

587
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,798
You'll never make
it out of the bay.

588
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,464
Son...

589
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,342
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

590
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:19,970
Savvy?

591
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:24,473
Commodore.

592
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:27,142
- Sir.
- They're taking the Dauntless.

593
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:29,896
Commodore.

594
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,315
They're taking the ship.

595
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:35,652
Sparrow and Turner. They're
taking the Dauntless.

596
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:37,152
Rash, Turner.

597
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:38,821
Too rash.

598
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:44,578
That is, without doubt, the
worst pirate I have ever seen.

599
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:49,165
Here they come.

600
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:56,255
Bring her around.
Bring her around.

601
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:05,974
Search every cabin, every
hold, down to the bilges.

602
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:21,906
Check the aft.

603
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:24,366
Sailors, back to the
Interceptor. Now.

604
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:25,785
Quickly, men

605
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:28,454
Whoa.

606
00:47:30,873 --> 00:47:34,795
Thank you, commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

607
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:37,463
We'd have had a hard
time of it by ourselves.

608
00:47:40,718 --> 00:47:42,759
Set topsails and
clear up this mess.

609
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:45,387
With the wind a quarter
astern, we won't catch them.

610
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:48,391
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

611
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:50,559
Hands, come about.
Run out the guns.

612
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:51,978
Bring out the guns.

613
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:54,647
We are to fire on
our own ship, sir?

614
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:56,724
I'd rather see her
at the bottom of the

615
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:58,567
ocean than in the
hands of a pirate.

616
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:03,197
Commodore. He's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

617
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,911
Abandon ship.

618
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:15,166
Let go the gear and sheet home.

619
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:17,711
That's got to be the best
pirate I've ever seen.

620
00:48:18,923 --> 00:48:21,549
So it would seem.

621
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:32,099
When I was a lad,
living in England,

622
00:48:32,184 --> 00:48:34,061
my mother raised me by herself.

623
00:48:34,146 --> 00:48:36,104
After she died, I came out here,

624
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:38,023
looking for my father.

625
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,609
Is that so?

626
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,362
My father,

627
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:44,821
Bill Turner?

628
00:48:44,906 --> 00:48:46,532
At the jail, it was only after you

629
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:48,493
learnt my name that
you agreed to help.

630
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:51,286
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

631
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,912
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

632
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:54,956
You knew my father.

633
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,171
I knew him.

634
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:05,175
Probably one of the few who
knew him as William Turner.

635
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,679
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

636
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:09,762
Bootstrap?

637
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:13,183
Good man. Good pirate.

638
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:15,353
I swear, you look just like him.

639
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:16,478
It's not true.

640
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:18,314
He was a merchant sailor.

641
00:49:18,399 --> 00:49:20,649
A good, respectable
man who obeyed the law.

642
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:22,900
He was a bloody
pirate, a scallywag.

643
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,989
My father was not a pirate.

644
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:30,157
Put it away, son.

645
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:32,159
It's not worth you
getting beat again.

646
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:33,371
You didn't beat me.

647
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:35,270
You ignored the
rules of engagement.

648
00:49:35,271 --> 00:49:36,790
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

649
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:39,667
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

650
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:50,263
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

651
00:49:50,347 --> 00:49:52,848
The only rules that
really matter are these:

652
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:56,810
What a man can do, and
what a man can't do.

653
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,687
For instance,

654
00:49:58,771 --> 00:50:01,897
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

655
00:50:01,982 --> 00:50:03,025
or you can't.

656
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,983
Pirate is in your
blood, boy, so you'll

657
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:06,612
have to square with that someday.

658
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,655
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

659
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:14,201
but I can't bring this ship into
Tortuga all by me onesies. Savvy?

660
00:50:14,536 --> 00:50:15,537
So...

661
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,919
Can you sail under the
command of a pirate?

662
00:50:25,174 --> 00:50:26,505
Or can you not?

663
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:30,259
Tortuga?

664
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:32,094
Tortuga.

665
00:50:54,158 --> 00:50:56,578
More importantly, it is indeed

666
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,497
a sad life that has
never breathed deep

667
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:01,748
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

668
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:04,627
What do you think?

669
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:10,008
It'll linger.

670
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:14,095
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

671
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:16,639
no man would ever feel unwanted.

672
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:19,685
Scarlett.

673
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:22,937
Not sure I deserved that.

674
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:25,899
Giselle.

675
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:26,942
Who was she?

676
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:28,026
What?

677
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,612
I may have deserved that.

678
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:36,992
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot.

679
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:41,455
Mother's love.

680
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,540
Jack.

681
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:46,670
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleeping.

682
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:47,824
It's bad luck.

683
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:50,632
Fortunately, I know
how to counter it.

684
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:54,009
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

685
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:55,804
and the man who
was sleeping drinks

686
00:51:55,805 --> 00:51:57,513
it while listening
to a proposition

687
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:59,306
from the man who did the waking.

688
00:52:01,475 --> 00:52:03,311
Aye, that'll about do it.

689
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,402
Blast. I'm already awake.

690
00:52:10,486 --> 00:52:11,861
That was for the smell.

691
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:23,830
Keep a sharp eye.

692
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,047
Now...

693
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:34,593
what's the nature of
this venture of your'n?

694
00:52:36,427 --> 00:52:40,849
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

695
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,851
I know where it's going to be,

696
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,685
and I'm gonna take it.

697
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:47,731
Jack,

698
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:50,107
it's a fool's errand.

699
00:52:50,192 --> 00:52:53,528
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

700
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:56,113
That's why I know what
Barbossa is up to.

701
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,032
All I need is a crew.

702
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,742
What I hear tell of
Captain Barbossa,

703
00:53:00,826 --> 00:53:03,829
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

704
00:53:03,872 --> 00:53:06,080
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool then.

705
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,291
Prove me wrong.

706
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:11,296
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

707
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,715
Let's just say it's
a matter of leverage?

708
00:53:21,556 --> 00:53:22,598
Mm.

709
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:24,057
Huh?

710
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:31,941
The kid?

711
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:36,529
That is the child of
Bootstrap Bill Turner.

712
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,075
His only child. Savvy?

713
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,076
Is he now?

714
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:47,415
Leverage, says you.

715
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:50,084
I think I feel a change
in the wind, says I.

716
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,919
- Mm.
- I'll find us a crew.

717
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,879
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

718
00:53:54,923 --> 00:53:57,299
One can only hope.

719
00:53:57,384 --> 00:54:00,133
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

720
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:26,787
You'll be dining with the captain,

721
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,206
and he requests you wear this.

722
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:33,752
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

723
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,172
He said you'd say that.

724
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:39,633
He also said, if
that be the case...

725
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:41,467
you'll be dining with the crew,

726
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,345
and you'll be naked.

727
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:50,894
Fine.

728
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:09,050
There's no need to stand on

729
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:11,124
ceremony no call
to impress anyone.

730
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:13,542
You must be hungry.

731
00:55:30,976 --> 00:55:32,184
Try the wine.

732
00:55:37,024 --> 00:55:40,026
And the apples. One of those next.

733
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:49,994
It's poisoned.

734
00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:53,873
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

735
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:55,838
Then release me. You
have your trinket.

736
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,376
I'm of no further value to you.

737
00:56:01,383 --> 00:56:03,424
You don't know what this is,

738
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:04,885
do you?

739
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,219
It's a pirate medallion.

740
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:09,346
This is Aztec gold.

741
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:13,016
One of 882 identical pieces

742
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:16,646
they delivered in a stone
chest to Cortés himself.

743
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:19,865
Blood money paid to
stem the slaughter

744
00:56:19,866 --> 00:56:21,943
he wreaked upon them
with his armies.

745
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:25,863
But the greed of
Cortés was insatiable.

746
00:56:25,906 --> 00:56:29,407
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

747
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,913
a terrible curse.

748
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,854
Any mortal that
removes but a single

749
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,792
piece from that stone chest...

750
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:42,254
shall be punished for eternity.

751
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:47,927
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

752
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:49,263
Aye.

753
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:53,599
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

754
00:56:53,642 --> 00:56:56,561
Buried on an Isle of the
Dead what cannot be found,

755
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:58,480
except for those who
know where it is.

756
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:01,523
Find it, we did.

757
00:57:03,193 --> 00:57:04,526
There be the chest.

758
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,405
Inside be the gold.

759
00:57:07,363 --> 00:57:09,781
And we took them all.

760
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:11,826
We spent them and traded them,

761
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,578
and frittered them away

762
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,371
on drink and food and
pleasurable company.

763
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:18,458
The more we gave them away,

764
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,169
the more we came to realise...

765
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:24,630
the drink would not satisfy.

766
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:28,634
Food turned to ash
in our mouths...

767
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:31,887
and all the pleasurable
company in the world

768
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,973
could not slake our lust.

769
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:38,644
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

770
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:43,067
Compelled by greed
we were, but now...

771
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:46,485
we are consumed by it.

772
00:57:57,664 --> 00:58:00,582
There is one way we
can end our curse.

773
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,631
All the scattered
pieces of the Aztec gold

774
00:58:07,673 --> 00:58:09,091
must be restored,

775
00:58:09,175 --> 00:58:11,594
and the blood repaid.

776
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:15,723
Thanks to ye,

777
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:17,935
we have the final piece.

778
00:58:19,978 --> 00:58:22,270
And the... blood to be repaid?

779
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:24,857
That's why there's no
sense to be killing ya.

780
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:26,651
Yet.

781
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:30,196
Apple?

782
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,201
Hah.

783
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:38,161
Arrgh.

784
00:58:38,204 --> 00:58:39,747
No.

785
00:58:47,047 --> 00:58:48,047
I'm curious.

786
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:51,049
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

787
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:56,824
Look.

788
00:59:56,909 --> 00:59:59,827
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

789
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:03,873
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

790
01:00:03,957 --> 01:00:05,623
But neither are we dead.

791
01:00:06,876 --> 01:00:10,671
For too long I've been parched of
thirst and unable to quench it.

792
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:13,131
Too long I've been
starving to death,

793
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:14,841
and haven't died.

794
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:17,261
I feel nothing.

795
01:00:18,054 --> 01:00:20,972
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

796
01:00:22,391 --> 01:00:24,558
nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

797
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:30,066
You best start believing in
ghost stories, Miss Turner.

798
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,150
You're in one.

799
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,170
What are you looking
at? Back to work.

800
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:03,056
Feast your eyes, captain.

801
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:06,058
All of them, faithful
hands before the mast.

802
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:09,353
Every man worth his salt...

803
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:11,439
and crazy to boot.

804
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:14,359
So this is your able-bodied crew?

805
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:21,199
You, sailor.

806
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:22,659
Cotton, sir.

807
01:01:22,702 --> 01:01:24,493
Mr Cotton.

808
01:01:24,536 --> 01:01:26,373
Do you have the
courage and fortitude

809
01:01:26,374 --> 01:01:27,871
to follow orders and stay true

810
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:29,541
in the face of danger and death?

811
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:31,292
Mr Cotton.

812
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:32,502
Answer, man.

813
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:33,962
He's a mute, sir.

814
01:01:34,046 --> 01:01:35,756
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

815
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:37,881
So he trained the
parrot to talk for him.

816
01:01:37,966 --> 01:01:39,844
No one's yet figured how.

817
01:01:43,054 --> 01:01:44,681
Mr Cotton's parrot.

818
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:47,183
Same question.

819
01:01:47,226 --> 01:01:49,978
- Wind in your sails.
- Wind in your sails.

820
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:53,188
Mostly, we figure
that means "yes."

821
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:54,735
Of course it does.

822
01:01:54,817 --> 01:01:55,817
Satisfied?

823
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:58,778
Well, you've proved they're mad.

824
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:00,739
And what's the benefit for us?

825
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,333
Anamaria.

826
01:02:14,253 --> 01:02:16,588
I suppose you didn't
deserve that one, either.

827
01:02:16,672 --> 01:02:18,589
No, that one I deserved.

828
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:20,383
You stole my boat.

829
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:21,508
Actually...

830
01:02:23,596 --> 01:02:25,972
Borrowed. Borrowed,
without permission,

831
01:02:26,058 --> 01:02:28,640
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

832
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,142
But you didn't.

833
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:31,602
You'll get another one.

834
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,980
I will.

835
01:02:34,065 --> 01:02:35,439
A better one.

836
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:37,440
A better one.

837
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:39,110
- That one.
- What one?

838
01:02:41,822 --> 01:02:42,989
That one?

839
01:02:46,451 --> 01:02:48,161
Aye. That one.

840
01:02:48,245 --> 01:02:49,828
- What say you?
- Aye.

841
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:51,288
Aye.

842
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:53,373
Anchors away.

843
01:02:53,457 --> 01:02:55,667
No, no, no, no, no.
It's frightful bad luck

844
01:02:55,752 --> 01:02:57,253
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

845
01:02:57,296 --> 01:02:59,963
It'll be far worse
not to have her.

846
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:36,708
How can we sail to an
island that nobody can find,

847
01:03:36,793 --> 01:03:39,253
with a compass that doesn't work?

848
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:41,297
Aye, the compass
doesn't point north,

849
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,173
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

850
01:03:54,853 --> 01:03:57,229
We should drop canvas, sir.

851
01:03:57,313 --> 01:03:59,355
She can hold a bit longer.

852
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:05,113
What's in your head that's put
you in such a fine mood, captain?

853
01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:07,197
We're catching up.

854
01:04:22,214 --> 01:04:24,214
Time to go, poppet.

855
01:05:19,771 --> 01:05:24,190
Dead men tell no tales...

856
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:29,404
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

857
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:31,280
have been claimed by this passage.

858
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:49,131
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

859
01:05:49,174 --> 01:05:50,921
Not a lot's known
about Jack Sparrow

860
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:52,385
before he showed up in Tortuga

861
01:05:52,469 --> 01:05:55,138
with a mind to go after the
treasure of Isla de Muerte.

862
01:05:55,223 --> 01:05:56,472
That was before I met him,

863
01:05:56,557 --> 01:05:58,723
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

864
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:00,602
What?

865
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:05,732
He failed to mention that.

866
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:08,067
He plays things closer
to the vest now.

867
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:10,237
And a hard-learnt lesson it was.

868
01:06:10,321 --> 01:06:13,198
Three days out on the
venture, the first mate says,

869
01:06:13,282 --> 01:06:16,367
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

870
01:06:16,451 --> 01:06:19,830
of the treasure too," so
Jack gives up the bearings.

871
01:06:19,998 --> 01:06:22,165
That night, there was a mutiny.

872
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,877
They marooned Jack on an
island and left him to die.

873
01:06:25,962 --> 01:06:28,630
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

874
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,009
Ah...

875
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:35,138
So that's the reason
for all the...

876
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,889
Reason's got nothing
to do with it.

877
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:42,019
Now, Will, when a
pirate's marooned,

878
01:06:42,103 --> 01:06:44,855
he's given a pistol with
a single shot. One shot...

879
01:06:44,897 --> 01:06:48,232
Well, that won't do much good
hunting, nor to be rescued.

880
01:06:48,317 --> 01:06:51,528
But after three weeks of a
starving belly and thirst,

881
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:54,948
that pistol starts to
look real friendly.

882
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:57,034
But Jack, he escaped the island,

883
01:06:57,118 --> 01:06:58,701
and still has that single shot.

884
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:01,370
Oh, he won't use it,
though, save on one man.

885
01:07:02,372 --> 01:07:04,415
His mutinous first mate.

886
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:06,459
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

887
01:07:07,711 --> 01:07:10,672
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

888
01:07:10,715 --> 01:07:12,842
He waded out into the shallows,

889
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:15,468
and he waited there three
days and three nights,

890
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:19,389
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

891
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:21,933
And on the fourth morning,

892
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:23,910
he roped a couple of sea turtles,

893
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:26,146
lashed them together
and made a raft.

894
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:30,211
He roped a couple of sea turtles.

895
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,194
Aye. Sea turtles.

896
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:36,447
What did he use for rope?

897
01:07:41,412 --> 01:07:42,995
Human hair.

898
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:45,414
From my back.

899
01:07:46,582 --> 01:07:47,959
Let go the anchor.

900
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,419
Lower the anchor line.

901
01:07:50,504 --> 01:07:52,921
Young Mr Turner and
I are to go ashore.

902
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,675
Captain.

903
01:07:54,759 --> 01:07:56,467
What if the worst should happen?

904
01:07:57,345 --> 01:07:59,846
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

905
01:08:25,665 --> 01:08:26,831
Move.

906
01:08:26,915 --> 01:08:28,916
Ten years of hoarding swag.

907
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:31,459
And now we finally
get to spend it.

908
01:08:34,298 --> 01:08:35,298
Oh.

909
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:41,596
Once we're quit of the
curse, we'll be rich men...

910
01:08:42,306 --> 01:08:43,871
and you can buy an eye what

911
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:46,015
actually fits and
is made of glass.

912
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,020
This one does splinter
something terrible.

913
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:51,314
Stop rubbing it.

914
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,566
Oh.

915
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:14,003
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

916
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:16,337
The pirates' code.

917
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:17,839
Any man who falls behind...

918
01:09:17,882 --> 01:09:20,216
is left behind.

919
01:09:21,553 --> 01:09:23,846
No heroes amongst thieves?

920
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:27,641
You know, for having such
a bleak outlook on pirates,

921
01:09:27,684 --> 01:09:30,602
you're well on your
way to becoming one.

922
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:32,688
Sprung a man from jail...

923
01:09:34,024 --> 01:09:36,524
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

924
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:39,111
sailed with a buccaneer
crew out of Tortuga...

925
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:44,532
and you're completely
obsessed with treasure.

926
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:48,412
That's not true.

927
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:50,872
I am not obsessed with treasure.

928
01:09:58,089 --> 01:10:00,840
Not all treasure is
silver and gold, mate.

929
01:10:00,883 --> 01:10:02,927
Gentlemen, the time has come.

930
01:10:03,011 --> 01:10:04,221
Hurrah.

931
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:06,430
Salvation is nigh.

932
01:10:06,515 --> 01:10:07,931
Yeah.

933
01:10:08,015 --> 01:10:10,726
- Our torment is near an end.
- Elizabeth.

934
01:10:11,394 --> 01:10:14,271
For ten years, we've
been tested and tried,

935
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:15,981
and each man-jack of you here

936
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:19,068
has proved his mettle
100 times over.

937
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:21,403
And 100 times again.

938
01:10:21,446 --> 01:10:23,530
Yeah.

939
01:10:23,572 --> 01:10:25,157
Suffered, I have.

940
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:27,743
Punished, we were,

941
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:29,327
the lot of us,

942
01:10:29,411 --> 01:10:32,747
disproportionate to our crime.

943
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,625
Right.

944
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:35,917
Here it is.

945
01:10:39,588 --> 01:10:43,217
The cursed treasure
of Cortés himself.

946
01:10:45,218 --> 01:10:47,763
Every last piece that went astray,

947
01:10:47,806 --> 01:10:49,557
we have returned.

948
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,307
Save for this.

949
01:10:51,392 --> 01:10:52,810
- Yeah.
- Jack.

950
01:10:52,894 --> 01:10:55,521
Not yet.

951
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:58,106
We'll wait for the
opportune moment.

952
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,941
Despairing of ever
finding the lass.

953
01:11:00,984 --> 01:11:02,821
When's that?

954
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:05,614
When it's of greatest
profit to you?

955
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:06,990
May I ask you something?

956
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:10,702
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

957
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,080
Do us a favour.

958
01:11:13,122 --> 01:11:15,248
I know it's difficult for you,

959
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,333
but please, stay here,

960
01:11:17,418 --> 01:11:20,295
and try not to do anything stupid.

961
01:11:22,965 --> 01:11:25,467
And who among us has
paid the blood sacrifice

962
01:11:25,552 --> 01:11:27,803
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye.

963
01:11:27,888 --> 01:11:30,723
And whose blood must yet be paid?

964
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:32,473
Hers.

965
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:39,229
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

966
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,986
Eat a whole bushel of apples.

967
01:11:52,745 --> 01:11:54,746
Begun by blood,

968
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,832
by blood undone.

969
01:12:01,294 --> 01:12:02,338
Sorry, Jack.

970
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,963
I'm not going to be your leverage.

971
01:12:14,182 --> 01:12:16,350
That's it?

972
01:12:16,392 --> 01:12:18,062
Waste not.

973
01:12:56,058 --> 01:12:57,392
Did it work?

974
01:12:57,434 --> 01:13:00,311
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

975
01:13:07,402 --> 01:13:08,903
You're not dead.

976
01:13:09,947 --> 01:13:12,448
No.

977
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:13,865
He shot me.

978
01:13:13,908 --> 01:13:17,453
It didn't work. The
curse is still upon us.

979
01:13:22,543 --> 01:13:25,004
You. Maid. Your father,
what was his name?

980
01:13:25,088 --> 01:13:27,338
Was your father William Turner?

981
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:28,922
No.

982
01:13:28,965 --> 01:13:30,593
Where's his child? The child that

983
01:13:30,594 --> 01:13:32,468
sailed from England
eight years ago?

984
01:13:32,553 --> 01:13:35,596
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

985
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,931
Where?

986
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:44,480
You two.

987
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:47,692
- You brought us the wrong person.
- Yeah.

988
01:13:48,651 --> 01:13:49,651
No.

989
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:53,113
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

990
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:55,825
She said her name was
Turner. You heard her.

991
01:13:57,703 --> 01:14:00,371
- I think she lied to us.
- Yeah.

992
01:14:01,622 --> 01:14:03,957
You brought us here for nothing.

993
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,128
I won't take questioning or second
guesses, not from you, Mr Twigg.

994
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:10,145
Who's to blame him? Every decision

995
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:12,468
you made has led us
from bad to worse.

996
01:14:14,678 --> 01:14:17,263
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths.

997
01:14:17,306 --> 01:14:18,306
Yeah.

998
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,685
And it's you who brought
us here in the first place.

999
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:28,148
If any coward here dare
challenge me, let him speak.

1000
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:32,361
I say, we cut her throat,

1001
01:14:32,446 --> 01:14:34,071
and spill all her blood.

1002
01:14:34,155 --> 01:14:35,156
Just in case.

1003
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,656
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1004
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:39,284
Yeah.

1005
01:14:45,249 --> 01:14:46,500
The medallion.

1006
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:47,835
She's taken it.

1007
01:14:47,877 --> 01:14:52,381
Get after her, you
feckless pack of ingrates.

1008
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:00,972
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars.

1009
01:15:01,015 --> 01:15:03,851
The oars have gone
missing. Find them.

1010
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:14,695
You.

1011
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,698
You're supposed to be dead.

1012
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:19,075
Am I not?

1013
01:15:21,035 --> 01:15:22,035
Oh.

1014
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:30,584
Puh-la-lem.

1015
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:34,215
Puh-la-lie-lay-lool.

1016
01:15:36,802 --> 01:15:38,426
Pah-lee-nee...

1017
01:15:38,511 --> 01:15:41,263
parsnip... par-sley...

1018
01:15:41,348 --> 01:15:43,348
par... partner, pardoner...

1019
01:15:43,391 --> 01:15:44,391
Parley?

1020
01:15:44,474 --> 01:15:46,309
That's the one. Parley.

1021
01:15:47,061 --> 01:15:48,062
Parley.

1022
01:15:48,105 --> 01:15:49,397
Parley?

1023
01:15:50,648 --> 01:15:54,443
Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley.

1024
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:58,363
That would be the French.

1025
01:16:10,168 --> 01:16:11,377
Not more pirates.

1026
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,461
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

1027
01:16:14,423 --> 01:16:15,629
Mr Gibbs?

1028
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,632
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

1029
01:16:18,759 --> 01:16:21,262
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

1030
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:24,014
He fell behind.

1031
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:33,107
Keep to the code.

1032
01:16:34,358 --> 01:16:37,151
- Weigh anchor.
- Hoist the sails.

1033
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:38,904
Split-quick, you dibbies.

1034
01:16:45,118 --> 01:16:48,163
How the blazes did you
get off that island?

1035
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:53,000
When you marooned me on that
godforsaken spit of land,

1036
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:55,463
you forgot one very
important thing, mate.

1037
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:59,465
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

1038
01:16:59,507 --> 01:17:03,136
Ah, well, I won't be
making that mistake...

1039
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:04,388
again.

1040
01:17:05,181 --> 01:17:08,641
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

1041
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:09,934
Aye.

1042
01:17:10,687 --> 01:17:11,687
Kill him.

1043
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:15,522
The girl's blood
didn't work, did it?

1044
01:17:18,194 --> 01:17:19,360
Hold your fire.

1045
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:28,536
You know whose blood we need?

1046
01:17:30,248 --> 01:17:32,122
I know whose blood you need.

1047
01:17:39,257 --> 01:17:41,839
What sort of a man trades
a man's life for a ship?

1048
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:43,176
A pirate.

1049
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:45,680
Here.

1050
01:17:45,764 --> 01:17:47,472
Let me.

1051
01:17:47,515 --> 01:17:49,016
Thank you.

1052
01:17:50,393 --> 01:17:52,977
You said you gave
Barbossa my name as yours.

1053
01:17:54,855 --> 01:17:55,855
Why?

1054
01:17:59,192 --> 01:18:00,483
I don't know.

1055
01:18:02,446 --> 01:18:04,656
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

1056
01:18:04,699 --> 01:18:06,401
I know they're rough.

1057
01:18:06,402 --> 01:18:09,286
No... I mean, yes,
they are, but...

1058
01:18:11,746 --> 01:18:13,539
But don't stop.

1059
01:18:22,048 --> 01:18:23,465
Elizabeth.

1060
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,734
It's yours.

1061
01:18:45,155 --> 01:18:48,575
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

1062
01:18:48,617 --> 01:18:50,075
It was a gift from my father.

1063
01:18:50,118 --> 01:18:52,245
He sent it to me.

1064
01:18:57,918 --> 01:18:59,460
Why did you take it?

1065
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:04,340
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

1066
01:19:05,925 --> 01:19:07,718
That would've been awful.

1067
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:12,973
It wasn't your blood they needed.

1068
01:19:15,769 --> 01:19:18,021
It was my father's blood.

1069
01:19:20,482 --> 01:19:23,067
My blood.

1070
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:29,365
The blood of a pirate.

1071
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:31,575
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

1072
01:19:44,924 --> 01:19:46,786
So you expect to
leave me standing on

1073
01:19:46,787 --> 01:19:48,550
some beach, with
nothing but a name

1074
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:51,191
and your word it's the one I need,

1075
01:19:51,192 --> 01:19:53,972
and watch you sail
away in my ship?

1076
01:19:54,057 --> 01:19:55,224
No.

1077
01:19:55,308 --> 01:19:57,399
I expect to leave
you standing on some

1078
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,436
beach with absolutely
no name at all,

1079
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:01,564
watching me sail away on my ship,

1080
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:04,525
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

1081
01:20:04,609 --> 01:20:05,943
Savvy?

1082
01:20:05,985 --> 01:20:09,029
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

1083
01:20:09,114 --> 01:20:12,950
with nought but a name and
your word it's the one I need.

1084
01:20:13,992 --> 01:20:15,327
Of the two of us,

1085
01:20:15,412 --> 01:20:19,206
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

1086
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:23,292
Therefore, my word is the
one we'll be trusting.

1087
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:25,088
Although...

1088
01:20:25,172 --> 01:20:27,798
I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

1089
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:30,133
if you hadn't betrayed
me and left me to die,

1090
01:20:31,176 --> 01:20:35,473
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1091
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:36,890
Funny old world, isn't it?

1092
01:20:40,895 --> 01:20:43,396
Captain. We're coming
up on the Interceptor.

1093
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:58,578
I'm having a thought
here, Barbossa.

1094
01:20:59,246 --> 01:21:01,038
What say we run up
a flag of truce,

1095
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:02,916
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

1096
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,462
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

1097
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:10,924
You see, Jack, that's exactly the
attitude that lost you the Pearl.

1098
01:21:11,009 --> 01:21:13,927
People are easier to
search when they're dead.

1099
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,305
Lock him in the brig.

1100
01:21:28,567 --> 01:21:31,026
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants.

1101
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:34,363
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

1102
01:21:34,406 --> 01:21:36,866
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl.

1103
01:21:36,909 --> 01:21:38,116
She's gaining on us.

1104
01:21:42,707 --> 01:21:45,083
This is the fastest
ship in the Caribbean.

1105
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:47,920
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

1106
01:21:47,962 --> 01:21:49,879
We're shallower on
the draft, right?

1107
01:21:49,922 --> 01:21:50,923
Aye.

1108
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,089
Can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

1109
01:21:54,552 --> 01:21:56,260
We don't have to outrun them long.

1110
01:21:56,303 --> 01:21:57,597
Just long enough.

1111
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,930
Lighten the ship.

1112
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,181
Stem to stern.

1113
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:03,352
Anything we can afford to
lose, see that it's lost.

1114
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:14,780
Apparently, there's a leak.

1115
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:32,631
Haul on the main brace.
Make ready the guns.

1116
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:34,882
And run out the sweeps.

1117
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:04,787
We're gonna need that.

1118
01:23:13,464 --> 01:23:16,257
It was a good plan, up till now.

1119
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:17,800
Gibbs.

1120
01:23:17,843 --> 01:23:19,260
We have to make a stand.

1121
01:23:19,344 --> 01:23:20,762
We must fight.

1122
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,806
- Load the guns.
- With what?

1123
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:25,600
Anything. Everything.

1124
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:27,393
Anything we have left.

1125
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:31,397
Load the guns.

1126
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:33,190
Case shot and langrage.

1127
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:34,859
Nails and crushed glass.

1128
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:38,572
With a will.

1129
01:23:59,884 --> 01:24:02,720
The Pearl's gonna luff
up on our port quarter.

1130
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,389
She'll rake us without
ever presenting a target.

1131
01:24:05,431 --> 01:24:07,516
Lower the anchor
on the right side.

1132
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,518
On the starboard side.

1133
01:24:10,563 --> 01:24:13,690
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady.

1134
01:24:13,733 --> 01:24:14,733
You both are.

1135
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:16,233
Daft like Jack.

1136
01:24:16,944 --> 01:24:18,444
Lower the starboard anchor.

1137
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:22,614
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons.

1138
01:24:22,698 --> 01:24:24,241
Aye.

1139
01:24:41,093 --> 01:24:42,343
Let go.

1140
01:24:48,935 --> 01:24:50,601
They're club hauling.

1141
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:53,436
Hard a port. Rack
the starboard oars.

1142
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,272
Hard a port.

1143
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:07,910
Keep her steady, man.

1144
01:25:14,959 --> 01:25:15,959
Now.

1145
01:25:16,043 --> 01:25:18,337
Fire.

1146
01:25:28,097 --> 01:25:30,098
Stop blowing holes in my ship.

1147
01:26:16,687 --> 01:26:18,856
We could use a few
more ideas, lass.

1148
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,523
It's your turn.

1149
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:22,358
We need us a devil's dowry.

1150
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:23,734
We'll give them her.

1151
01:26:24,738 --> 01:26:26,237
She's not what they're after.

1152
01:26:28,824 --> 01:26:30,158
The medallion.

1153
01:26:52,263 --> 01:26:54,849
Strike your colours, you
blooming cockroaches.

1154
01:26:54,892 --> 01:26:57,644
Hands, grapnels, at the ready.

1155
01:26:57,728 --> 01:26:59,563
Prepare to board.

1156
01:27:33,889 --> 01:27:36,723
Pistols and cutlasses, men.

1157
01:27:36,766 --> 01:27:39,060
Koehler and Twigg to
the powder magazine.

1158
01:27:39,103 --> 01:27:42,438
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion.

1159
01:27:51,991 --> 01:27:54,410
Hey. Hey.

1160
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,845
Hey. Below.

1161
01:28:32,656 --> 01:28:34,157
Thanks very much.

1162
01:28:37,493 --> 01:28:39,079
Haa.

1163
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:46,084
Whoa.

1164
01:28:47,547 --> 01:28:48,547
Jack.

1165
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,715
Bloody empty.

1166
01:29:07,648 --> 01:29:09,526
That's not very nice.

1167
01:29:14,156 --> 01:29:15,364
Where is the medallion?

1168
01:29:15,406 --> 01:29:16,492
Wretch.

1169
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:19,452
Ah...

1170
01:29:19,536 --> 01:29:20,869
Where is dear William?

1171
01:29:23,081 --> 01:29:24,331
Will.

1172
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:28,752
- Will.
- Elizabeth.

1173
01:29:31,716 --> 01:29:32,840
Monkey.

1174
01:29:39,515 --> 01:29:41,349
I can't move it.

1175
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:43,725
Will.

1176
01:29:43,768 --> 01:29:44,894
Elizabeth.

1177
01:29:44,936 --> 01:29:46,019
Will.

1178
01:29:57,116 --> 01:29:59,241
Why, thank you, Jack.

1179
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:00,951
You're welcome.

1180
01:30:01,035 --> 01:30:03,622
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

1181
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:07,749
Gents. Our hope is restored.

1182
01:30:07,834 --> 01:30:09,252
Yeah.

1183
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:47,789
Any of you so much as
thinks the word parley,

1184
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:50,625
I'll have your guts for garters.

1185
01:30:58,509 --> 01:30:59,926
Will.

1186
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:01,970
Stop it. Stop it.

1187
01:31:02,847 --> 01:31:04,805
Welcome back, miss.

1188
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:07,641
You took advantage of our
hospitality last time.

1189
01:31:07,684 --> 01:31:11,022
It holds fair now that
you return the favour.

1190
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,316
No. No.

1191
01:31:16,986 --> 01:31:18,071
Barbossa.

1192
01:31:20,031 --> 01:31:21,032
Will.

1193
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:24,826
She goes free.

1194
01:31:25,952 --> 01:31:27,663
What's in your head, boy?

1195
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,332
She goes free.

1196
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,045
You've only got one
shot, and we can't die.

1197
01:31:34,129 --> 01:31:36,129
Don't do anything stupid.

1198
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,342
You can't.

1199
01:31:40,426 --> 01:31:41,842
I can.

1200
01:31:43,555 --> 01:31:45,179
Like that.

1201
01:31:46,226 --> 01:31:47,516
Who are you?

1202
01:31:47,558 --> 01:31:49,060
No one. He's no one.

1203
01:31:49,811 --> 01:31:52,813
A distant cousin of my
aunt's nephew, twice removed.

1204
01:31:52,855 --> 01:31:55,357
- Lovely singing voice, though.
- Eunuch.

1205
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:57,066
My name is WillTurner.

1206
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:59,861
My father was
Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1207
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:01,864
His blood runs in my veins.

1208
01:32:02,574 --> 01:32:04,866
It's the spitting image
of old Bootstrap Bill,

1209
01:32:04,951 --> 01:32:06,742
come back to haunt us.

1210
01:32:06,827 --> 01:32:08,830
On my word, do as I say,

1211
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:10,747
or I'll pull this trigger,

1212
01:32:10,832 --> 01:32:13,040
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker.

1213
01:32:14,084 --> 01:32:16,378
Name your terms, Mr Turner.

1214
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:17,587
Elizabeth goes free.

1215
01:32:17,673 --> 01:32:19,297
Yes, we know that one.

1216
01:32:19,382 --> 01:32:20,382
Anything else?

1217
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:24,345
And the crew.

1218
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:26,346
The crew are not to be harmed.

1219
01:32:31,103 --> 01:32:32,893
Agreed.

1220
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:42,571
Go on, poppet. Walk the plank.

1221
01:32:52,081 --> 01:32:53,749
Barbossa, you lying bastard.

1222
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,418
You swore she'd go free.

1223
01:32:56,502 --> 01:32:58,754
Don't dare impugn me honour, boy.

1224
01:32:58,838 --> 01:33:00,504
I agreed she'd go free.

1225
01:33:00,589 --> 01:33:03,592
It was you who failed to
specify when or where.

1226
01:33:09,307 --> 01:33:11,315
Though it does seem
a shame to lose

1227
01:33:11,316 --> 01:33:13,268
something so fine, don't it, lads?

1228
01:33:13,311 --> 01:33:14,311
Aye.

1229
01:33:15,313 --> 01:33:18,481
So I'll be having that
dress back before you go.

1230
01:33:22,819 --> 01:33:24,947
I always liked you.

1231
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,285
Goes with your black heart.

1232
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:33,037
Mm. It's still warm.

1233
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:38,460
Off you go.

1234
01:33:38,543 --> 01:33:39,878
Come on.

1235
01:33:43,507 --> 01:33:44,673
Too long.

1236
01:33:55,811 --> 01:33:58,312
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1237
01:33:59,899 --> 01:34:01,315
Jack.

1238
01:34:01,358 --> 01:34:02,443
Jack.

1239
01:34:04,194 --> 01:34:05,654
Did ya not notice?

1240
01:34:05,738 --> 01:34:07,835
That be the same
island we made you

1241
01:34:07,836 --> 01:34:09,990
governor of on our
last little trip.

1242
01:34:11,284 --> 01:34:12,952
I did notice.

1243
01:34:12,994 --> 01:34:17,164
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure
up another miraculous escape,

1244
01:34:17,207 --> 01:34:18,833
but I doubt it.

1245
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,212
Off you go.

1246
01:34:24,214 --> 01:34:26,840
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1247
01:34:26,925 --> 01:34:28,509
By the powers, you're right.

1248
01:34:28,592 --> 01:34:30,721
Where be Jack's pistol?

1249
01:34:30,805 --> 01:34:31,972
Bring it forward.

1250
01:34:35,142 --> 01:34:37,936
Seeing as there's two
of us, a gentleman...

1251
01:34:38,645 --> 01:34:40,438
would give us a pair of pistols.

1252
01:34:40,523 --> 01:34:42,231
It'll be one pistol, as before,

1253
01:34:42,315 --> 01:34:45,108
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

1254
01:34:45,192 --> 01:34:47,028
and starve to death yourself.

1255
01:35:11,386 --> 01:35:13,014
That's the second time I've had to

1256
01:35:13,015 --> 01:35:14,930
watch that man sail
away with my ship.

1257
01:35:17,393 --> 01:35:20,060
You were marooned on this
island before, weren't you?

1258
01:35:20,144 --> 01:35:21,730
We can escape the same way.

1259
01:35:21,772 --> 01:35:23,898
To what point and
purpose, young missy?

1260
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:26,400
The Black Pearl is gone,

1261
01:35:26,443 --> 01:35:28,055
and unless you have a rudder and a

1262
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:29,903
lot of sails hidden
in that bodice...

1263
01:35:29,988 --> 01:35:32,406
Unlikely...

1264
01:35:32,449 --> 01:35:35,408
Young Mr Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1265
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,414
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

1266
01:35:40,457 --> 01:35:42,551
You vanished from
under the eyes of

1267
01:35:42,552 --> 01:35:44,877
seven agents of the
East India Company.

1268
01:35:44,919 --> 01:35:47,672
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot.

1269
01:35:47,757 --> 01:35:50,007
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1270
01:35:52,552 --> 01:35:54,053
How did you escape last time?

1271
01:36:00,894 --> 01:36:02,769
Last time...

1272
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:05,605
I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

1273
01:36:06,608 --> 01:36:07,608
Last time...

1274
01:36:09,652 --> 01:36:12,946
the rum runners used
this island as a cache.

1275
01:36:12,989 --> 01:36:15,448
They came by and I was
able to barter passage off.

1276
01:36:15,532 --> 01:36:17,285
From the looks of things,

1277
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,578
they've long been out of business.

1278
01:36:19,621 --> 01:36:21,841
You probably have your bloody

1279
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:24,750
friend Norrington
to thank for that.

1280
01:36:24,793 --> 01:36:26,334
So that's it then?

1281
01:36:27,628 --> 01:36:31,465
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow.

1282
01:36:32,468 --> 01:36:34,259
You spent three days,

1283
01:36:34,302 --> 01:36:36,637
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

1284
01:36:39,016 --> 01:36:42,809
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1285
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:53,027
♪ We're devils We're black sheep ♪

1286
01:36:53,112 --> 01:36:54,279
♪ We're really bad eggs ♪

1287
01:36:54,322 --> 01:36:56,948
♪ Drink up, me hearties Yo ho ♪

1288
01:36:56,991 --> 01:37:00,952
♪ Yo ho, yo ho A
pirate's life for me ♪

1289
01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:02,830
I love this song.

1290
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:08,000
♪ Really bad eggs ♪

1291
01:37:09,421 --> 01:37:11,422
Ooh...

1292
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,882
When I get the Pearl back,

1293
01:37:14,966 --> 01:37:17,468
I'm gonna teach it
to the whole crew,

1294
01:37:17,511 --> 01:37:19,054
and we'll sing it all the time.

1295
01:37:19,139 --> 01:37:20,984
And you will be
positively the most

1296
01:37:20,985 --> 01:37:22,932
fearsome pirates in
the Spanish Main.

1297
01:37:23,016 --> 01:37:24,851
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1298
01:37:25,895 --> 01:37:27,603
The entire ocean.

1299
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:29,440
The entire world.

1300
01:37:30,357 --> 01:37:32,358
Wherever we want to go, we go.

1301
01:37:32,401 --> 01:37:33,985
That's what a ship is, you know.

1302
01:37:34,027 --> 01:37:36,864
It's not just a keel and a
hull and a deck and sails.

1303
01:37:36,948 --> 01:37:38,449
That's what a ship needs.

1304
01:37:38,533 --> 01:37:40,534
But what a ship is...

1305
01:37:41,911 --> 01:37:44,871
What the Black Pearl really is...

1306
01:37:46,332 --> 01:37:49,584
is freedom.

1307
01:37:50,585 --> 01:37:51,670
Jack...

1308
01:37:51,713 --> 01:37:56,467
It must be really terrible for
you to be trapped on this island.

1309
01:37:57,258 --> 01:37:58,469
Oh, yes.

1310
01:37:58,553 --> 01:38:01,389
But the company is...

1311
01:38:01,432 --> 01:38:04,224
infinitely better than
last time, and the...

1312
01:38:06,018 --> 01:38:09,729
scenery has definitely
improved. Mr Sparrow.

1313
01:38:09,771 --> 01:38:11,967
I'm not entirely
sure I've had enough

1314
01:38:11,968 --> 01:38:13,817
rum to allow that kind of talk.

1315
01:38:15,444 --> 01:38:17,237
I know exactly what
you mean, love.

1316
01:38:24,745 --> 01:38:26,289
To freedom.

1317
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:30,583
To the Black Pearl.

1318
01:39:00,113 --> 01:39:01,199
No.

1319
01:39:01,283 --> 01:39:04,076
Not good. Stop.

1320
01:39:04,117 --> 01:39:05,326
Not good.

1321
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:06,410
What are you doing?

1322
01:39:06,453 --> 01:39:08,539
You've burned all the
food, the shade...

1323
01:39:08,623 --> 01:39:10,874
the rum. Yes, the rum is gone.

1324
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:12,207
Why is the rum gone?

1325
01:39:12,667 --> 01:39:14,543
One, because it is a vile drink

1326
01:39:14,627 --> 01:39:17,548
that turns even the most
respectable men into scoundrels.

1327
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,717
Two, that signal is
over 1,000 feet high.

1328
01:39:20,802 --> 01:39:23,010
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

1329
01:39:23,095 --> 01:39:25,471
Do you think there is
even the slightest chance

1330
01:39:25,514 --> 01:39:26,681
they won't see it?

1331
01:39:26,765 --> 01:39:28,598
But why is the rum gone?

1332
01:39:29,685 --> 01:39:31,143
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1333
01:39:31,186 --> 01:39:32,981
You give it one hour, maybe two,

1334
01:39:33,065 --> 01:39:35,282
keep a weather eye open, and you

1335
01:39:35,283 --> 01:39:37,983
will see white sails
on that horizon.

1336
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:46,492
"Must've been terrible for
you to be trapped here, Jack."

1337
01:39:46,535 --> 01:39:49,620
"Must've been terrible for
you..." Well, it bloody is now.

1338
01:39:57,003 --> 01:39:59,254
There'll be no living
with her after this.

1339
01:40:00,256 --> 01:40:03,842
- We've got to save Will.
- No. You're safe now.

1340
01:40:03,926 --> 01:40:06,012
We will return to Port
Royal immediately,

1341
01:40:06,096 --> 01:40:08,056
not go gallivanting after pirates.

1342
01:40:08,141 --> 01:40:10,058
Then we condemn him to death.

1343
01:40:11,144 --> 01:40:13,852
The boy's fate is regrettable...

1344
01:40:13,936 --> 01:40:16,522
but then, so was his
decision to engage in piracy.

1345
01:40:16,607 --> 01:40:19,859
To rescue me. To prevent
anything from happening to me.

1346
01:40:19,943 --> 01:40:23,780
If I may be so bold as to
interject my professional opinion,

1347
01:40:23,865 --> 01:40:27,033
the Pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle.

1348
01:40:27,075 --> 01:40:29,993
It's very unlikely she'd
be able to make good time.

1349
01:40:30,036 --> 01:40:31,370
Think about it.

1350
01:40:31,455 --> 01:40:33,664
The Black Pearl.

1351
01:40:33,707 --> 01:40:38,210
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1352
01:40:38,253 --> 01:40:40,213
How can you pass that up?

1353
01:40:42,382 --> 01:40:45,217
By remembering that I
serve others, Mr Sparrow,

1354
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:47,762
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you.

1355
01:40:47,847 --> 01:40:48,847
Please do this.

1356
01:40:48,888 --> 01:40:50,513
For me.

1357
01:40:50,556 --> 01:40:52,725
As a wedding gift.

1358
01:40:52,808 --> 01:40:53,975
Elizabeth?

1359
01:40:55,062 --> 01:40:57,605
Are you accepting the
commodore's proposal?

1360
01:41:00,024 --> 01:41:01,067
I am.

1361
01:41:01,902 --> 01:41:03,569
A wedding. I love weddings.

1362
01:41:03,654 --> 01:41:05,404
Drinks all around.

1363
01:41:07,698 --> 01:41:10,451
I know. "Clap him
in irons," right?

1364
01:41:12,997 --> 01:41:14,162
Mr Sparrow...

1365
01:41:15,499 --> 01:41:17,833
you will accompany these
fine men to the helm

1366
01:41:17,919 --> 01:41:20,419
and provide us with a
bearing to Isla de Muerta.

1367
01:41:20,462 --> 01:41:22,549
You'll then spend the
rest of the voyage

1368
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:24,382
contemplating all
possible meanings

1369
01:41:24,424 --> 01:41:26,925
of the phrase "silent
as the grave."

1370
01:41:26,967 --> 01:41:28,550
Do I make myself clear?

1371
01:41:28,593 --> 01:41:30,681
Inescapably clear.

1372
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:36,936
Shiver me timbers.

1373
01:41:37,728 --> 01:41:39,355
Cotton says you missed a bit.

1374
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:45,735
You knew William Turner?

1375
01:41:47,614 --> 01:41:49,699
Old Bootstrap Bill.

1376
01:41:49,783 --> 01:41:50,783
We knew him.

1377
01:41:51,784 --> 01:41:55,787
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

1378
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:57,915
the mutiny and all.

1379
01:41:58,498 --> 01:42:00,501
He said it wasn't
right with the code.

1380
01:42:01,585 --> 01:42:04,755
That's why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you, as it were.

1381
01:42:04,798 --> 01:42:08,425
He said we deserved
to be cursed...

1382
01:42:10,012 --> 01:42:12,096
and remain cursed.

1383
01:42:12,139 --> 01:42:13,179
Stupid blighter.

1384
01:42:13,264 --> 01:42:15,097
Good man.

1385
01:42:15,141 --> 01:42:18,000
But, as you can
imagine, that didn't

1386
01:42:18,001 --> 01:42:20,396
sit too well with the captain.

1387
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:23,733
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all.

1388
01:42:23,817 --> 01:42:27,444
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story.

1389
01:42:29,989 --> 01:42:34,074
So... what the captain did...

1390
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,745
he strapped a cannon to
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1391
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:38,330
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1392
01:42:38,373 --> 01:42:41,375
Last we saw of old Bill Turner...

1393
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,918
he was sinking to the
crushing black oblivion

1394
01:42:44,003 --> 01:42:47,131
of Davy Jones' locker.

1395
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:50,633
Because it was only after that
we learnt we needed his blood

1396
01:42:50,676 --> 01:42:51,885
to lift the curse.

1397
01:42:51,969 --> 01:42:55,014
That's what you'd call ironic.

1398
01:42:59,185 --> 01:43:00,811
Bring him.

1399
01:43:08,026 --> 01:43:10,029
I don't care for the situation.

1400
01:43:10,572 --> 01:43:13,656
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1401
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:17,036
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1402
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,029
I go in and convince
Barbossa to send

1403
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,788
his men out in their little boats.

1404
01:43:20,872 --> 01:43:23,708
You and your men
return to the Dauntless

1405
01:43:23,751 --> 01:43:27,004
and blast the bejesus out of
them with your little cannons.

1406
01:43:27,047 --> 01:43:28,296
What do you have to lose?

1407
01:43:29,382 --> 01:43:31,885
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1408
01:43:33,552 --> 01:43:35,428
Now, to be quite honest with you,

1409
01:43:35,513 --> 01:43:38,474
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1410
01:43:38,558 --> 01:43:42,352
which includes the
future Mrs Commodore.

1411
01:43:42,394 --> 01:43:43,486
It's for your safety.

1412
01:43:43,487 --> 01:43:45,480
Don't care what the
Commodore ordered.

1413
01:43:45,565 --> 01:43:46,565
I have to tell him.

1414
01:43:46,607 --> 01:43:49,609
The pirates. They're cursed.
They can't be killed.

1415
01:43:49,693 --> 01:43:52,237
Don't worry, miss. He's
already informed of that.

1416
01:43:52,279 --> 01:43:55,989
A little mermaid flopped up on
deck and told him the whole story.

1417
01:43:56,074 --> 01:43:58,158
This is Jack Sparrow's doing.

1418
01:44:09,631 --> 01:44:11,089
No reason to fret.

1419
01:44:11,173 --> 01:44:13,758
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

1420
01:44:13,801 --> 01:44:15,802
No mistakes this time.

1421
01:44:15,886 --> 01:44:17,595
He's only half Turner.

1422
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:19,097
We spill it all.

1423
01:44:21,516 --> 01:44:24,435
Guess there is reason to fret.

1424
01:44:37,282 --> 01:44:39,159
Beg your pardon,
mate. Beg your pardon.

1425
01:44:39,244 --> 01:44:41,286
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

1426
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:44,080
By blood un...

1427
01:44:46,458 --> 01:44:47,458
Jack.

1428
01:44:48,502 --> 01:44:49,584
It's not possible.

1429
01:44:49,626 --> 01:44:51,796
Not probable.

1430
01:44:51,839 --> 01:44:53,632
Where's Elizabeth?

1431
01:44:55,009 --> 01:44:57,259
She's safe, just like I promised.

1432
01:44:57,302 --> 01:45:00,262
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

1433
01:45:00,305 --> 01:45:02,681
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

1434
01:45:02,765 --> 01:45:04,892
So we're all men of
our word, really.

1435
01:45:04,976 --> 01:45:08,271
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

1436
01:45:08,314 --> 01:45:09,731
Shut up. You're next.

1437
01:45:13,277 --> 01:45:16,154
You don't want to
be doing that, mate.

1438
01:45:16,196 --> 01:45:18,155
No, I really think I do.

1439
01:45:19,949 --> 01:45:21,826
Your funeral.

1440
01:45:24,997 --> 01:45:26,997
And why don't I
want to be doing it?

1441
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,708
Oh, because...

1442
01:45:29,709 --> 01:45:32,044
Because the HMS Dauntless,

1443
01:45:32,128 --> 01:45:34,546
the pride of the Royal Navy,

1444
01:45:34,631 --> 01:45:37,883
is floating just off shore,

1445
01:45:37,967 --> 01:45:39,801
waiting for you.

1446
01:45:47,853 --> 01:45:49,020
What we doing here?

1447
01:45:50,939 --> 01:45:54,358
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1448
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,486
We catch them in a crossfire,

1449
01:45:56,528 --> 01:45:59,363
and send them down to see Old Hob.

1450
01:46:00,658 --> 01:46:03,034
I know why we're here. I meant...

1451
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:04,993
why aren't we doing what it was...

1452
01:46:05,036 --> 01:46:06,869
What Mr Sparrow said we should do?

1453
01:46:06,912 --> 01:46:08,414
With the cannons and all?

1454
01:46:08,499 --> 01:46:11,541
Because it was Mr
Sparrow who said it.

1455
01:46:14,169 --> 01:46:16,755
You think he wasn't
telling the truth?

1456
01:46:16,839 --> 01:46:18,716
Just hear me out, mate.

1457
01:46:18,801 --> 01:46:20,603
You order your men
to row out to the

1458
01:46:20,604 --> 01:46:22,552
Dauntless, they do
what they do best...

1459
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:25,722
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your

1460
01:46:25,723 --> 01:46:28,058
aunt. There you
are with two ships.

1461
01:46:28,142 --> 01:46:30,560
The makings of your
very own fleet.

1462
01:46:30,645 --> 01:46:32,464
Because, you'll take
the grandest as

1463
01:46:32,465 --> 01:46:34,232
your flagship, and who's to argue?

1464
01:46:34,316 --> 01:46:35,732
But what of the Pearl?

1465
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:38,695
Name me captain.

1466
01:46:38,737 --> 01:46:40,393
I'll sail under your colours, I'll

1467
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:42,196
give you ten percent
of me plunder,

1468
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,448
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

1469
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:47,911
Commodore Barbossa.

1470
01:46:47,954 --> 01:46:49,037
Savvy?

1471
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,289
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

1472
01:46:51,373 --> 01:46:53,264
wanting me not to kill the whelp.

1473
01:46:53,265 --> 01:46:54,281
No. Not at all.

1474
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:55,919
By all means, kill the whelp.

1475
01:46:55,962 --> 01:46:58,380
Just not yet.

1476
01:46:58,423 --> 01:47:00,591
Wait to lift the curse

1477
01:47:00,633 --> 01:47:03,301
until the opportune moment.

1478
01:47:06,764 --> 01:47:08,391
For instance...

1479
01:47:10,268 --> 01:47:13,520
after you've killed
Norrington's men.

1480
01:47:13,604 --> 01:47:15,188
Every...

1481
01:47:15,273 --> 01:47:16,940
last...

1482
01:47:16,983 --> 01:47:18,443
one.

1483
01:47:28,078 --> 01:47:30,412
You've been planning
this from the beginning.

1484
01:47:30,456 --> 01:47:32,039
Ever since you learnt my name.

1485
01:47:32,874 --> 01:47:33,874
Yeah.

1486
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,336
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

1487
01:47:38,422 --> 01:47:39,422
- 15.
- 40.

1488
01:47:39,464 --> 01:47:40,465
25.

1489
01:47:41,632 --> 01:47:42,966
And I'll buy you the hat.

1490
01:47:43,009 --> 01:47:45,010
A really big one.

1491
01:47:45,803 --> 01:47:46,971
Commodore.

1492
01:47:50,099 --> 01:47:51,307
We have an accord.

1493
01:47:52,978 --> 01:47:55,270
All hands to the boats.

1494
01:47:56,273 --> 01:47:57,397
Apologies.

1495
01:47:57,482 --> 01:47:59,149
You give the orders.

1496
01:48:00,486 --> 01:48:01,486
Gents...

1497
01:48:02,488 --> 01:48:03,861
take a walk.

1498
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,035
Not to the boats?

1499
01:49:09,429 --> 01:49:12,347
Hold fire.

1500
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:17,184
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy.

1501
01:49:18,563 --> 01:49:20,188
Except they was in a horse,

1502
01:49:20,231 --> 01:49:21,690
instead of dresses.

1503
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,774
Wooden horse.

1504
01:49:36,746 --> 01:49:37,747
A moment, please.

1505
01:49:41,919 --> 01:49:42,919
Elizabeth?

1506
01:49:46,173 --> 01:49:47,965
I just want you to know, I...

1507
01:49:49,092 --> 01:49:51,552
I believe you made a
very good decision today.

1508
01:49:52,386 --> 01:49:54,389
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1509
01:49:54,891 --> 01:49:56,016
But, you know,

1510
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:59,018
even a good decision, if
made for the wrong reasons,

1511
01:49:59,102 --> 01:50:00,604
can be a wrong decision.

1512
01:50:09,615 --> 01:50:10,615
Lieutenant.

1513
01:50:17,537 --> 01:50:19,955
Yoo-hoo.

1514
01:50:29,799 --> 01:50:30,967
Elizabeth?

1515
01:50:33,136 --> 01:50:34,386
Are you there?

1516
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,266
Elizabeth, are you
even listening to me?

1517
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:08,463
Oh, what have you done?

1518
01:51:08,506 --> 01:51:09,602
Yoo-hoo.

1519
01:51:09,603 --> 01:51:12,091
Stop that. I already
feel like a fool.

1520
01:51:13,134 --> 01:51:15,636
Look nice, though.

1521
01:51:19,015 --> 01:51:21,433
Do I look nice now?

1522
01:51:57,387 --> 01:51:58,637
I must admit, Jack.

1523
01:51:58,722 --> 01:52:00,639
I thought I had you figured.

1524
01:52:00,724 --> 01:52:03,892
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1525
01:52:03,977 --> 01:52:05,935
Me, I'm dishonest.

1526
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,857
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1527
01:52:08,899 --> 01:52:10,149
Honestly...

1528
01:52:10,233 --> 01:52:12,859
it's the honest ones you
want to watch out for.

1529
01:52:12,901 --> 01:52:15,194
Because you can never predict

1530
01:52:15,237 --> 01:52:18,532
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

1531
01:52:18,575 --> 01:52:19,575
stupid.

1532
01:52:52,734 --> 01:52:54,942
You're off the edge
of the map, mate.

1533
01:52:55,027 --> 01:52:57,070
Here, there be monsters.

1534
01:53:04,954 --> 01:53:07,037
What would you pick to eat first?

1535
01:53:07,121 --> 01:53:09,041
I think we should decide now,

1536
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:11,293
just so we're ready
when the time comes.

1537
01:53:36,362 --> 01:53:37,485
What was that?

1538
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:43,033
Oh.

1539
01:54:00,426 --> 01:54:01,426
It's Elizabeth.

1540
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:23,699
Make for the ship. Move.

1541
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:34,917
To the ship.

1542
01:54:37,714 --> 01:54:40,841
Marines, arms.

1543
01:55:17,294 --> 01:55:19,045
You can't beat me, Jack.

1544
01:55:43,319 --> 01:55:44,862
That's interesting.

1545
01:55:55,748 --> 01:55:57,624
I couldn't resist, mate.

1546
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:21,941
Oh, no.

1547
01:57:04,025 --> 01:57:05,233
Sorry.

1548
01:57:14,328 --> 01:57:15,995
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

1549
01:57:16,038 --> 01:57:18,706
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an epic battle

1550
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:21,124
until Judgement Day,
when the trumpets sound?

1551
01:57:22,251 --> 01:57:23,669
Or you could surrender.

1552
01:57:35,848 --> 01:57:37,683
Ah.

1553
01:57:50,988 --> 01:57:52,197
All of you with me.

1554
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:54,324
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him.

1555
01:57:54,408 --> 01:57:56,993
Ready, and... heave.

1556
01:58:03,584 --> 01:58:05,585
Please, I need your help. Come on.

1557
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:08,421
Any port in a storm.

1558
01:58:08,506 --> 01:58:10,591
Cotton's right.
We've got the Pearl.

1559
01:58:10,675 --> 01:58:12,926
What about Jack? Are you
just gonna leave him?

1560
01:58:13,009 --> 01:58:14,803
Jack owes us a ship.

1561
01:58:14,886 --> 01:58:16,430
There's the code to consider.

1562
01:58:17,016 --> 01:58:18,139
The code?

1563
01:58:19,893 --> 01:58:22,351
You're pirates. Hang the code

1564
01:58:22,435 --> 01:58:24,105
and hang the rules.

1565
01:58:24,147 --> 01:58:26,565
They're more like
guidelines, anyway.

1566
01:58:30,361 --> 01:58:32,530
Bloody pirates.

1567
01:58:42,124 --> 01:58:43,872
- Oi.
- What?

1568
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:46,126
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1569
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:48,420
They're stealing our ship.

1570
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,546
Bloody pirates.

1571
01:58:52,634 --> 01:58:54,469
Boarders away.

1572
01:59:02,684 --> 01:59:04,685
Come on.

1573
01:59:29,879 --> 01:59:31,920
No. Me eye.

1574
01:59:33,007 --> 01:59:34,715
No.

1575
01:59:51,858 --> 01:59:53,942
I'm gonna teach you
the meaning of pain.

1576
01:59:54,027 --> 01:59:55,570
You like pain?

1577
01:59:57,406 --> 01:59:58,782
Try wearing a corset.

1578
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:10,794
Whose side is Jack on?

1579
02:00:10,878 --> 02:00:13,923
At the moment?

1580
02:00:48,123 --> 02:00:49,998
No fair.

1581
02:01:14,023 --> 02:01:15,858
Ten years you carry that pistol,

1582
02:01:15,942 --> 02:01:18,277
and now you waste your shot.

1583
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:22,239
He didn't waste it.

1584
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:48,391
I feel...

1585
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,272
cold.

1586
02:02:24,385 --> 02:02:27,388
Oh... Oh.

1587
02:02:56,541 --> 02:02:59,001
Parley?

1588
02:02:59,044 --> 02:03:00,922
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1589
02:03:01,006 --> 02:03:03,383
Huzzah. Huzzah.

1590
02:03:12,183 --> 02:03:15,061
Huzzah.

1591
02:03:49,261 --> 02:03:51,596
We should return to the Dauntless.

1592
02:03:54,143 --> 02:03:57,769
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1593
02:04:07,448 --> 02:04:10,741
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

1594
02:04:11,742 --> 02:04:13,076
that was it.

1595
02:04:14,536 --> 02:04:16,705
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

1596
02:04:16,789 --> 02:04:19,624
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1597
02:04:24,213 --> 02:04:26,381
I'm sorry, Jack.

1598
02:04:28,301 --> 02:04:30,509
They done what's right by them.

1599
02:04:30,594 --> 02:04:32,346
Can't expect more than that.

1600
02:04:47,945 --> 02:04:49,278
Jack Sparrow.

1601
02:04:49,321 --> 02:04:53,408
- We have learnt that you...
- Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow.

1602
02:04:54,118 --> 02:04:57,370
For your wilful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1603
02:04:57,454 --> 02:05:01,166
Said crimes being
numerous in quantity,

1604
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:02,792
and sinister in nature.

1605
02:05:03,461 --> 02:05:04,960
The most egregious of these

1606
02:05:05,003 --> 02:05:07,214
to be cited herewith:

1607
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:11,050
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

1608
02:05:12,052 --> 02:05:15,054
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

1609
02:05:15,138 --> 02:05:17,681
as are we all.

1610
02:05:17,724 --> 02:05:20,434
Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1611
02:05:20,519 --> 02:05:23,605
impersonating a cleric of
the Church of England...

1612
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:24,813
Oh, yes.

1613
02:05:24,855 --> 02:05:26,857
Sailing under false colours,

1614
02:05:26,942 --> 02:05:31,153
arson, kidnapping,
looting, poaching,

1615
02:05:31,197 --> 02:05:37,159
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

1616
02:05:37,202 --> 02:05:38,995
and general lawlessness.

1617
02:05:40,412 --> 02:05:42,082
And for these crimes,

1618
02:05:42,166 --> 02:05:44,708
you have been sentenced
to be, on this day,

1619
02:05:44,752 --> 02:05:48,505
hung by the neck, until dead.

1620
02:05:48,548 --> 02:05:50,841
May God have mercy on your soul.

1621
02:05:50,883 --> 02:05:52,424
Governor Swann.

1622
02:05:52,509 --> 02:05:54,428
Commodore.

1623
02:05:55,929 --> 02:05:56,929
Elizabeth.

1624
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:01,226
I should've told you every
day, from the moment I met you.

1625
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:05,563
I love you.

1626
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:21,872
Oi, watch yourself.

1627
02:06:21,914 --> 02:06:23,039
Marines.

1628
02:06:23,082 --> 02:06:24,623
I can't breathe.

1629
02:06:26,419 --> 02:06:27,458
Elizabeth.

1630
02:06:30,547 --> 02:06:31,590
Move.

1631
02:06:32,465 --> 02:06:34,757
Goodness sake.

1632
02:06:42,475 --> 02:06:44,684
You men. With me.

1633
02:06:55,947 --> 02:06:57,114
Move.

1634
02:07:06,874 --> 02:07:08,459
Come on.

1635
02:07:18,554 --> 02:07:19,677
Come on, men.

1636
02:07:45,289 --> 02:07:47,264
I thought we might
have to endure some

1637
02:07:47,265 --> 02:07:49,290
manner of ill-conceived
escape attempt.

1638
02:07:50,126 --> 02:07:51,709
But not from you.

1639
02:07:51,794 --> 02:07:55,631
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1640
02:07:55,674 --> 02:07:57,340
And this is how you thank me?

1641
02:07:57,383 --> 02:07:59,467
By throwing in your lot with him?

1642
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:01,094
He's a pirate.

1643
02:08:01,179 --> 02:08:03,139
And a good man.

1644
02:08:03,931 --> 02:08:06,183
If all I've achieved
here is that the hangman

1645
02:08:06,226 --> 02:08:08,352
will own two pairs of
boots instead of one,

1646
02:08:08,436 --> 02:08:10,062
so be it.

1647
02:08:10,146 --> 02:08:12,022
At least my conscience
will be clear.

1648
02:08:12,065 --> 02:08:15,026
You forget your place, Turner.

1649
02:08:16,568 --> 02:08:18,195
It's right here,

1650
02:08:18,238 --> 02:08:19,697
between you and Jack.

1651
02:08:23,703 --> 02:08:25,369
As is mine.

1652
02:08:25,453 --> 02:08:26,828
Elizabeth.

1653
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:29,454
Lower your weapons.

1654
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:32,250
For goodness sake, put them down.

1655
02:08:37,341 --> 02:08:40,260
So this is where your
heart truly lies, then.

1656
02:08:41,885 --> 02:08:43,387
It is.

1657
02:08:51,894 --> 02:08:55,524
Well. I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1658
02:08:55,567 --> 02:08:58,109
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place?

1659
02:08:58,193 --> 02:08:59,486
- Oh.
- Spiritually.

1660
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:01,571
Ecumenically.

1661
02:09:01,656 --> 02:09:03,740
Grammatically.

1662
02:09:04,324 --> 02:09:06,908
I want you to know that I
was rooting for you, mate.

1663
02:09:08,204 --> 02:09:09,204
Know that.

1664
02:09:13,209 --> 02:09:14,710
Elizabeth.

1665
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:19,255
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1666
02:09:20,716 --> 02:09:22,593
I'm sorry.

1667
02:09:24,721 --> 02:09:25,721
Will.

1668
02:09:28,016 --> 02:09:29,683
Nice hat.

1669
02:09:31,644 --> 02:09:33,227
Friends.

1670
02:09:35,147 --> 02:09:37,941
This the day that you will always

1671
02:09:37,984 --> 02:09:40,611
remember as the day that...

1672
02:09:45,575 --> 02:09:48,242
Idiot. He's nowhere to
go but back to the noose.

1673
02:09:50,663 --> 02:09:52,498
Sail ho.

1674
02:10:00,049 --> 02:10:02,675
What's your plan of action?

1675
02:10:03,425 --> 02:10:04,425
Sir?

1676
02:10:08,807 --> 02:10:11,264
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1677
02:10:11,307 --> 02:10:15,187
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1678
02:10:15,271 --> 02:10:19,066
piracy itself can
be the right course?

1679
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:24,613
Mr Turner.

1680
02:10:30,703 --> 02:10:33,538
I will accept the
consequences of my actions.

1681
02:10:39,503 --> 02:10:41,129
This is a beautiful sword.

1682
02:10:43,590 --> 02:10:45,341
I would expect the man who made it

1683
02:10:45,384 --> 02:10:50,180
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1684
02:10:52,224 --> 02:10:53,976
Thank you.

1685
02:10:56,854 --> 02:10:57,894
Commodore.

1686
02:10:57,979 --> 02:10:59,690
What about Sparrow?

1687
02:11:01,607 --> 02:11:04,526
Oh, I think we can afford to
give him one day's head start.

1688
02:11:11,033 --> 02:11:12,703
So...

1689
02:11:13,786 --> 02:11:16,873
This is the path
you've chosen, is it?

1690
02:11:18,249 --> 02:11:20,541
After all...

1691
02:11:20,584 --> 02:11:22,129
he is a blacksmith.

1692
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:24,381
No.

1693
02:11:29,094 --> 02:11:31,388
He's a pirate.

1694
02:11:56,412 --> 02:11:58,079
Heave.

1695
02:12:07,632 --> 02:12:10,217
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code?

1696
02:12:10,259 --> 02:12:12,928
We figured they
were more actual...

1697
02:12:13,012 --> 02:12:14,972
guidelines.

1698
02:12:19,102 --> 02:12:20,811
Thank you.

1699
02:12:21,938 --> 02:12:23,314
Captain Sparrow.

1700
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:29,194
The Black Pearl is yours.

1701
02:12:45,002 --> 02:12:46,629
On deck, you scabrous dogs.

1702
02:12:46,713 --> 02:12:48,381
Hands to braces.

1703
02:12:48,465 --> 02:12:50,549
Let go and haul to run free.

1704
02:12:52,219 --> 02:12:54,011
Now...

1705
02:12:54,096 --> 02:12:55,930
Bring me that horizon.

1707
02:13:08,652 --> 02:13:11,153
