1
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,303
Atten-hut!

2
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,866
Here's our man.
Professor Howard Plummer.

3
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,607
He's been kidnapped
by a group of Serbian rebels.

4
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,811
I know we've been up for 72
hours, but I expect perfection.

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,854
Nothing else.

6
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,256
The enemy has a boat,
four jet skis, and a chopper.

7
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,092
I'll take you guys in
until we hit radar range.

8
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,826
Then you'll dive from there.

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,663
Once we hit our target,

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,431
Red One, Red Two,
you take out our escorts.

11
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,031
I'll handle the chopper,
and I'll find the professor.

12
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,770
Red Three, you radio in
for our copter.

13
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,903
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

14
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,742
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

15
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:26,115
We are SEALS.
And this is what we do.

16
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:20,431
Ah!

17
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,014
Red Two, handle the boat.

18
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,177
I'll take care of the bozos
on the jet ski.

19
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,530
Ah!

20
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,872
Oh!

21
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,760
Gotcha.

22
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,532
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe,
U.S. Navy.

23
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,467
Where is the briefcase?

24
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,999
It's right behind you.
Man, am I glad to see you.

25
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,014
- I never thought I'd see my family...
- I'll get you out.

26
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,414
We're gonna do it my way.
No highway option.

27
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,180
Yeah, I'm with you. Absolutely.

28
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,135
Lieutenant, thank you so much
for saving my life.

29
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,608
If I had died back there,
my wife, she would've killed me.

30
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,077
Just a joke.

31
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,877
Do you mind if I call my wife
to tell her I'm okay?

32
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,713
I have strict orders
to get you out of here safely.

33
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,946
We gotta keep moving.

34
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,047
Lieutenant, I am safe.
Please. She thinks I'm dead.

35
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,059
- All right, make it quick.
- Okay.

36
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,790
Zoe, Seth, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.

37
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,659
It's voice activated.

38
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,295
Hey.

39
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,998
These are my kids.

40
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,434
You'd like 'em.
They're really great.

41
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,971
I doubt it. Hurry up.

42
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,107
Hey! We're almost ready.

43
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,482
Give us another sec.

44
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,023
Professor!

45
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,391
The doctor says you've
healed up real good, Shane.

46
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,404
I should've been
out of here weeks ago.

47
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,497
Look, I know heads
are gonna roll for this.

48
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,871
Hey, you took a bullet.

49
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,604
Yeah, but I want you to know
I take full responsibility

50
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,475
for what happened
to the professor.

51
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,776
Plummer was the best
security expert

52
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,714
the Department of Defense
ever had.

53
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,743
He was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called "GHOST",

54
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,255
Guided High-altitude
Scrambling Transmitter.

55
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,985
One pulse from a GHOST satellite

56
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,118
and a country can't launch
its own nukes.

57
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,389
That's why the Serbians
kidnapped him.

58
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,921
They must have thought that
GHOST was in that briefcase.

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,969
GHOST is still out there.

60
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,937
Which is why I'm sending you
back in.

61
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,440
I know you've never lost anybody
before, Shane.

62
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,943
I was with your father
when he led a platoon...

63
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,172
With all due respect,

64
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,681
I'd appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this.

65
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,513
All I'm saying is that it
happens to the best of them.

66
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,051
And you're the best.

67
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,112
I need someone I can trust on this

68
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,455
- and I know I can trust you.
- Okay.

69
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,789
I'll put a team together.

70
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,920
No. It's not
that kind of mission.

71
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,864
This is at the top of the Pentagon's
priority list.

72
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,864
<i>Two days ago,
I got a call from Admiral Blair.</i>

73
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,136
<i>It seems that the professor's widow
contacted him.</i>

74
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,699
<i>Whoever killed her husband</i>

75
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,938
<i>must think that GHOST
is still in that house.</i>

76
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,072
<i>Now, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.</i>

77
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:33,209
<i>A safety deposit box has been discovered
in Zurich in the Plummers' name.</i>

78
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,086
<i>I've been assigned to escort Mrs.
Plummer there to retrieve the contents.</i>

79
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,148
<i>We're hoping it's the GHOST program.</i>

80
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,093
<i>In the meantime, someone
needs to watch over those kids.</i>

81
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,754
<i>That's where you come in.</i>

82
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,959
<i>While there, you'll be looking
for the hidden program as well.</i>

83
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,183
Ah!

84
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,432
You must be Lieutenant Wolfe!
Admiral Blair said you'd be coming.

85
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,525
Come on in.
Meet the rest of the gang.

86
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,797
Come on.

87
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:30,070
Kids! Get your butts
down here and say hello!

88
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:35,512
Okay, you've already met Lulu.
This is Zoe, Seth and Peter.

89
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,448
Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe.

90
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,452
He's gonna stay with you
while I'm away.

91
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,511
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,888
Oh! This is Helga and Tyler.

93
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,052
Ma'am. Baby.

94
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,620
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

95
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,189
I have date
with butcher tonight.

96
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,202
I want to look nice.

97
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,534
Ah!

98
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,741
You have a pleasant family.

99
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,716
Well, for the younger ones,

100
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,844
I think it hasn't really
sunk in yet.

101
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,857
It's been hardest
on Zoe and Seth.

102
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,257
But they don't really
like to talk about it.

103
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,625
Well, it must be hard
on all of you.

104
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,994
Howard wasn't around much.

105
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,124
His work took him
all over the world.

106
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,998
He'd be gone six,
seven months at a time.

107
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,300
Yeah, I can understand
that lifestyle.

108
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,502
Anyway, about a week ago,

109
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,910
someone broke into the house.
No one was home.

110
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,676
I didn't tell the kids 'cause
I didn't wanna scare them.

111
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,478
Mrs. Plummer,
I've dealt with...

112
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,746
Ow! Oh, my God!

113
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,153
I'm sorry. That's Gary.
He was Howard's.

114
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,088
Gary, down!

115
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,717
He bit me.

116
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,887
Yeah, well,
he thinks he's a guard dog.

117
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:01,491
- Mrs. Plummer?
- Oh, call me Julie. Please.

118
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,365
I'm gonna go outside
and have a look around.

119
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,802
Out, out.

120
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm gonna miss you.
Mmm...

121
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,106
I'm gonna miss you too.

122
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,941
I'll be back in 48 hours, okay?

123
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,710
Bye, pumpkin.
I love you, pumpkin.

124
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,588
Oh, and kids? Remember,

125
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,217
whatever Lieutenant Wolfe
asks you to do, do it.

126
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,318
Mom, chill.
We're gonna be fine.

127
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,793
I'm sorry.
I don't do this very often.

128
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,563
You're going away
for a few days.

129
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,933
Yeah, I know.

130
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,869
I got it.

131
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay. Here you go, Helga.

132
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,701
- I take baby.
- Bye. Bye.

133
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,246
It's okay.

134
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,645
You remember
the emergency numbers, right?

135
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,708
Don't worry, Mrs. Plummer,
your kids'll be safe with me.

136
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,620
Your little angels will be fine,
Mrs. Plummer.

137
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,063
Go.

138
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,600
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

139
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,693
Have some fun.

140
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,001
Bye-bye.

141
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,538
Tell me,
are you licensed to kill?

142
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,239
No, ma'am.

143
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:59,341
Too bad.
It could have come in handy.

144
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,858
Ah!

145
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,194
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

146
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,091
Please!

147
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,659
Oh, my God! Shut up!

148
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,571
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

149
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,806
Hey!

150
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,849
- Where's the baby?
- Tell me. Come on.

151
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,407
No!

152
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,920
Shut up! No, she didn't.

153
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,616
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

154
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,215
Oh, my God. Tell me!

155
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,783
Is there anyone here
that understands

156
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,830
the meaning of the word
"discipline"?

157
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:49,425
Hey, Flipper. You don't like it?
Do something. I make bottle.

158
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,804
Thank you, Peter.

159
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,275
Yes!

160
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,434
- Ow!
- Gotcha!

161
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,562
Ah!

162
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,769
What's your problem?
Get off me!

163
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,845
Oh, my God!

164
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,507
What are you doing, you spaz?
That's my boyfriend!

165
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,641
So you're the one breaking in!

166
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,207
- Go back inside!
- No!

167
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,399
We speak English, buddy.

168
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,991
Look, about the sirens
and the strobe lights.

169
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,266
We own a bakery, so we're up
kind of early. Would you mind?

170
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,135
Sorry.

171
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,306
Oh, and we found this
in our pool filter.

172
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,939
Keep that zoo reined in,
huh, babysitter?

173
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,719
Yo, fool, handle me like that again
and I'll lay knuckles upside your head!

174
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,313
Okay! Enough is enough!
Come on, Scott, let's go!

175
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,982
- Come on.
- No, you don't.

176
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,996
Get back here.
Give me 20.

177
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,531
I meant push-ups!

178
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,864
- Zoe?
- Drop down! Do 20!

179
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,029
- This is not the Army or Navy!
- One...

180
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,266
Real nice move, Lt. Smooth.

181
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,036
He'll probably
never speak to me!

182
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,577
- Then I did you a favor.
- Whoa!

183
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,237
Personal bubble invasion.

184
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,611
Your mother was worried sick
about you!

185
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,582
You should call
here and tell her.

186
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,881
I'm sure you'll take care of that
for me.

187
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,581
Stay out of my life!

188
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,553
Wait! You can't do this!

189
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,461
I have plans!
It's Saturday night! Ow!

190
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,929
Not anymore.

191
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:07,061
- You too. Lights out.
- Bite me.

192
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,573
Boy, this family's in
for a rude awakening.

193
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,373

200
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,850
What are you doing?

201
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,911
You're burning daylight! Move!

202
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,480
It's Sunday.

203
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,560
And it's 6:00 AM!
You're insane!

204
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,465
Listen up!

205
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,233
Your behavior is unacceptable.

206
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,570
In order to maintain
a state of safety,

207
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,473
we need to maintain
a state of order.

208
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,637
One more little bite?

209
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,147
We going to be strong mine
worker when we grow up.

210
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,614
Excuse me.

211
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,378
Excuse me!

212
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,619
Now, I've only got one rule.

213
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,658
Everything is done my way.
No highway option.

214
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,092
- Do you copy?
- Do you copy?

215
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:42,962
What? I said, "Do you copy?"

216
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,028
- Do not copy me.
- Do not copy me.

217
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:52,108
Hey, I mean it.
Cut it out!

218
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,974
Uh...

219
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,806
Peter farted.

220
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,283
- Oh, that is so gross.
- Quiet!

221
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,288
Everybody up.
That means you too.

222
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,814
Tracking devices,
never take them off.

223
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:12,057
The panic button
is for emergencies only.

224
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,032
Touch that,
you'd better be dying.

225
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,965
Or you're dead.

226
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,005
I would rather chew off my arm
than wear that.

227
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,236
Just because my mom is paranoid doesn't
mean we have to take orders from you.

228
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,573
Let me explain how
the chain of command works.

229
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,478
I tell you what to do
and you do it!

230
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,574
End of chain.

231
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,643
I'm not gonna have time
to remember all of your names.

232
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:41,091
You'll be Red Leader.
Red Baby. Red One. Red.

233
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,020
Where's the older male?
There were five.

234
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,431
He walks like Dracula

235
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:54,666
with footsteps
silent like death.

236
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,435
He's in his room.

237
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,803
Red Two!

238
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,015
Red Two, open up!

239
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,680
Red Two!

240
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,029
What have you done?

241
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,689
What? I thought...

242
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,131
Is this what you're
trained to do?

243
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,964
A "shock and awe" on my door?

244
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,096
I can fix that
with a hammer and some nails.

245
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,265
- It's real easy to fix.
- No, it's not! Look!

246
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,141
It's broken in half!
You can't fix that!

247
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,670
If you'd been wearing this,
this wouldn't have happened.

248
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:42,118
What are you talking about?
I was in the bathroom!

249
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,156
You know I would never
ask you for your help...

250
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,624
...but he has got to go.

251
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,940
Somebody help me, please!

252
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,072
Help me, somebody!

253
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,518
- Stop it, Peter! This is nuts!
- Peter, cut this out.

254
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:22,450
Hey, good soldiers
aren't scared of anything.

255
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,393
I'm not scared. I'm annoyed.

256
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,728
Ever since he heard Daddy say
there was a ghost in the house,

257
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,168
he puts on that blanket and chases me
everywhere. It drives me crazy.

258
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,898
Peter, have you seen this ghost?

259
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,880
All right, here he comes.

260
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,894
Hey! You leave towel
on floor in bathroom.

261
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,299
I pick up after kids,
not you.

262
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,167
And light a match next time.

263
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,005
Oh!

264
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,311
I have good news.

265
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,515
Your background checks
have cleared,

266
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,525
and we are free
to give you the box.

267
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,322
- Oh.
- Excellent.

268
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,852
Just as soon as you
provide us with the passwords.

269
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,091
Passwords?

270
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,656
It was your husband's wish

271
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,793
that the person who
collects the box

272
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,303
must provide us
with the passwords.

273
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,499
Great.

274
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,338
- Is it "The GHOST?"
- Ghost.

275
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,037
Mmm... No.

276
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:55,386
<i>These brats! Sugi pula!</i>

277
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,547
I had it!

278
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,559
- Remain calm.
- I am calm.

279
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,688
I quit!
That makes me calm.

280
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,631
Let's not be hasty about this.

281
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,709
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

282
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,738
<i>- Don't even think about it!
- Lt. Wolfe?</i>

283
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:25,942
<i>It's Julie Plummer.</i>

284
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,815
<i>- Who's this?
- Julie Plummer.</i>

285
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,047
<i>- What's that?
- Julie Plummer!</i>

286
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,090
Ah!

287
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,489
<i>- Oh, Mrs. Plummer.
- Did something fall?</i>

288
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,551
<i>- What was that noise?
- Nothing. Everything's okay!</i>

289
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,497
You'll be happy to know that I found
the culprit that's been sneaking around!

290
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,625
<i>- Great. Who was it?
- Just some teenager.</i>

291
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,263
<i>Teenager? I wanted to tell you
I'm gonna be a few more days.</i>

292
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,432
You'll be a few more days?

293
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,137
<i>- Yes, is that a problem?
- No, that's no problem!</i>

294
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,738
No, I'm fine.
I'm just... I'm just doing my...

295
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,339
<i>Your what?</i>

296
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,318
<i>- Duty.
- Sure everything's okay?</i>

297
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,979
Things are great,
Mrs. Plummer.

298
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,388
Yeah, you just do
whatever you have to.

299
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,484
<i>- Well, tell the kids I said...
- Bye, Mrs. Plummer!</i>

300
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,190
Just hang...
Let's calm down.

301
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,499
Just... just try to relax.

302
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:22,199
Ah!

303
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,176
Ah! She bit me!

304
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,012
Red Leader!

305
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,248
I command you to come back here!
That's a direct order!

306
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,516
You can't leave a man behind!

307
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,751
Red Leader!

308
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,788
Red Leader!

309
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,694
I don't even know
how to change a diaper!

310
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,126
Don't worry!

311
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,295
If she loves you,
she'll come back, huh?

312
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,569
Okay, everybody, listen up.
There's been a change of plans.

313
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,372
Your mother's not coming home
as soon as she expected.

314
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,970
- When is she coming back?
- Soon.

315
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,175
For now,
we'll just have some more big fun.

316
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,411
That's what we've been doing?
Having fun?

317
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,819
- Tomorrow's a school day.
- I have wrestling.

318
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,447
I need a release
for Driver's Ed.

319
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,014
I've got Fireflies.

320
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,252
I have to go to the mall.

321
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,261
I have to stop her
from spending so much.

322
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,593
Whoa, okay, Halt. Halt!

323
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,825
We'll take this hill
one inch at a time.

324
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,834
Only then can we rise
to the challenge.

325
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,041
Okay,
who's gonna change Red Baby?

326
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,701
Guys?

327
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,282
Ah!

328
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,446
God! Red Baby!

329
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,192
Alrighty. We'll try this.

330
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,592
Yes. Whoa.

331
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,529
Ooh. Soak that up a bit.

332
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,136
Hi. Zoe says you look
like The Hulk.

333
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,871
I think you're cute.

334
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,970
Thank you.

335
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,315
- Do you do kung fu?
- Yes.

336
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,879
Did you ever punch someone
so hard that their head came off?

337
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,788
No.

338
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,961
Why are your boobs so big?

339
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,724
They're not boobs.

340
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,961
Do you have to wear a bra?

341
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,701
Will my boobs
get as big as yours someday?

342
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,113
You know, little girl,

343
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,951
I think it's time you went
nappy-poo in beddy-bye land.

344
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,583
Do I look like I'm five to you?

345
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,025
What did I say?

346
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,724
Disrespectful. And to think
I was interested in you!

347
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,338
Okay, troops! Breakfast!

348
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,601
What are you waiting for?
Dig in.

349
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,165
Feel free to mix and match.

350
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,804
Stay away from the cheese.
It'll back you up.

351
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,008
Don't worry about running out.
I can get lots more of these.

352
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,142
I've survived months
off this stuff.

353
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,016
Okay, like, I'm really gonna eat
all of these carbs?

354
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,154
I can cross my eyes.
Wanna see?

355
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,623
No.

356
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,264
Tyler hates it when I do that.

357
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,166
I know how he feels.

358
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,633
What's he...? Red Four!

359
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,578
Plummer residence.

360
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,556
Yes, I know it's Monday today.

361
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,717
No, Mrs. Plummer's away.

362
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,422
Yes, we'll be right there.

363
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,989
Who was that?

364
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,295
Your vice principal.

365
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,835
He said that if you and Seth
are late again,

366
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,530
you're both suspended.

367
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,301
He wants to see you
in his office right away.

368
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,434
What is it?

369
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,572
- It's a minivan.
- Ugh.

370
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,277
Now,
is this supposed to...?

371
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,843
- How do we...?
- Excuse me, Mr. Wolfe?

372
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,389
If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna be late for sure.

373
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,448
Not on my watch.

374
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,459
- Hold that.
- How fast is your watch?

375
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,594
You'll be suspended for sure.

376
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,137
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

377
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,802
Who drives like this?
You're crazy!

378
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,388
What are you doing?
Stop!

379
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,654
Got 'em here.

380
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,821
My fault.

381
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:49,958
Yeah, I always said these kids
needed a parole officer.

382
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,095
I guess, uh, Mrs. Plummer
thought so too, huh?

383
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,605
Wow, you got a real, uh,
upper torso going on, huh?

384
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,338
You ever, uh, do any time?

385
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,379
Sasquatch.

386
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,282
- You got something to say, boy?
- No.

387
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,047
No? Good.

388
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,146
Wow, it looks like you
have a pair of legs

389
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,884
coming out of your shoulders.

390
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,654
- You hit the gym a lot, do you?
- Eh.

391
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,356
- Woolly Mammoth.
- You know what, Creeper?

392
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:23,128
You just bought yourself
an extra 15 minutes on the mats.

393
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,362
With the Murninator!

394
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,804
Excuse me.
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe.

395
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,138
I'm watching the kids
for the Plummers. A few days.

396
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,542
Oh, babysitter, huh?

397
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,445
Well, good.
Whatever job you can get, right?

398
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,541
I'm Murney.
Duane Murney.

399
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,950
My friends call me
"Little Puppet."

400
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm the VP here.

401
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,016
I'm in charge of discipline,
conduct and truancy

402
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:52,325
from top to bottom,
K through 12.

403
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,729
You're in my house now,
strong man.

404
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,428
- You're the vice principal.
- And the wrestling coach.

405
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,164
See the Creeper over there?

406
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,833
He has played hooky from every
wrestling practice this month.

407
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,935
And her, she has missed
22 Driver's Ed classes.

408
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,537
Out of 23!

409
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,947
These are the worst students
in my school.

410
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,043
- I'm ashamed...
- Your school?

411
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,290
Good morning, kids.

412
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,259
Mr. Murney,
thanks for watching my chair.

413
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,161
- I'll take it from here.
- Roger. Absolutely.

414
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,256
I was just informing
our new friend here

415
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,665
about some of the duties
as vice principal.

416
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,602
Speaking of which, how's it
going with the investigation

417
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,139
into the baloney slices
on the cafeteria ceiling?

418
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,335
- Taking some interesting turns.
- Keep up the good work.

419
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,641
Right. I'll be on the roof.

420
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,148
Bye, now.

421
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,514
All right, it's time
to get back to class.

422
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,646
I'll cut you some slack seeing as
it's Lt. Wolfe's first day. Thank you.

423
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,248
Okay.

424
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,793
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Yes, please.

425
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,230
So, what's with this Murninator?

426
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,894
He's big, he's hairy,
he's sometimes smelly,

427
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,164
but he's harmless
and he has tenure.

428
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,832
So, you're the bodyguard?

429
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,705
Mrs. Plummer thought the kids...

430
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:15,212
She briefed me on everything
and she told me that the kids

431
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,180
aren't fully aware
of the situation

432
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,341
and that's the way she wants it.

433
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,187
She also told me
you're a "Teams" guy.

434
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,156
- Yes, I am.
- Well, Petty Officer Third Class,

435
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,251
- Claire Fletcher at your service.
- You're kidding.

436
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,491
Four years at Naval Base
Coronado. They paid for college.

437
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,398
- Honor, courage.
- Commitment.

438
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,628
It's the way I run this school.

439
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,034
I like that.

440
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:47,706
So, permission to stick around
and keep eyes on the kids?

441
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,043
Permission granted.

442
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,487
<i>We don't need no music
We don't need no band,</i>

443
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,462
<i>All we need is Mustangs
and jammin' in the stands,</i>

444
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,795
<i>We said jammin' in the stands,</i>

445
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,132
<i>J- A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands,</i>

446
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,230
<i>What? J-A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands,</i>

447
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,333
Go, Mustangs! Whoo!

448
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,811
"Black belt.
Honorable discharge."

449
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,872
Clean as a whistle.

450
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,749
- Yeah, you little punk!
- Where's your babysitter now?

451
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,420
Hey!

452
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,360
- Enough.
- All right, you heard the lady.

453
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,023
Let's break it up, guys.
Come on. Hmm?

454
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,762
Relax, Popeye.
Boys will be boys, huh?

455
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,670
It's kinda good for the Creeper.
Gives him a chance to punk up.

456
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,039
- Learn to defend himself.
- Six against one?

457
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,044
Well, the odds are never pretty.

458
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,444
But look at it as, like,
a preparation for him.

459
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,243
The naked streets of Bethesda

460
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,442
can be so dark and dangerous.

461
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,546
- Right, Creeper?
- Ooh. Whoa.

462
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,852
You're pretty quick there, frogman.

463
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,155
I, myself,
happen to be a black belt.

464
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,957
That's why they wanted me
to coach the wrestling team.

465
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,464
Ooh-ah!

466
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,796
Sensei.

467
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,029
You know what that's
called, homeboy?

468
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,435
Total control.

469
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,064
You all right? Hmm?

470
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,939
Maybe sometime you can pop by
the wrestling class

471
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,672
and, uh, we'll show the boys
how a couple pros do it.

472
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,771
What do you think?
I'll go easy on you.

473
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,510
- I'm on duty.
- You're on duty.

474
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,677
Oh, that's right,
you're a babysitter.

475
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,779
So it's kinda like
"doo-doo" duty.

476
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,620
Don't worry about it.

477
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,630
We'll do it on a day when you're
not, uh, washing your hair. Hmm?

478
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,160
And I'll see you in class.

479
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,004
At ease.

480
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,466
That guy don't have
his head on right.

481
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:02,239
I was fine!
I don't need your help!

482
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,084
Okay, okay.

483
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:13,419
- Aw. Hey, rough day?
- I tried feeding him.

484
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,083
Yeah? Did you try changing him?

485
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,957
- Would you help me?
- No.

486
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,691
Just the thought of...

487
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,206
- Emergency.
- What are you...? I... Hey!

488
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,807
Hi.

489
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,868
What's up with him?

490
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,937
Where are you going?

491
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,293
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

492
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,437
Ha-ha.

493
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,347
I should go, okay?

494
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,750
Call me, you guys,
if you need anything.

495
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,584
My number's on the fridge.

496
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,146
Are you okay?

497
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:30,853
Oh... Wow.

498
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,093
Is there anything I can do?

499
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,895
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

500
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,801
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm fine.

501
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,930
I mean, they're just kids,
you know.

502
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,407
Call me if you need anything.
Okay?

503
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,343
After you shower.
Or, before. It doesn't matter.

504
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,403
I'll see you guys.

505
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:58,688
Very funny.
Thank you for the letter.

506
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,714
Guys, be quiet.
I told you he had boobs.

507
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,882
Lulu, can I see you
in the family room?

508
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:37,252
Who are those people?

509
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,991
My troop. Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday are troop nights.

510
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,930
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

511
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,128
Parents go out on troop nights.
They'll be back at 8:00.

512
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,727
Mom's our den mother!

513
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:51,070
You better tell your little
friends that they have to...

514
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,541
- Today we're supposed to sell cookies.
- I don't do cookies.

515
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,349
We have to. If we don't
sell enough cookies,

516
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,084
we can't go
to the Jamboree.

517
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,822
They're waving at me.

518
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,336
All right, ladies!
Here's how it's gonna be!

519
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,133
Tonight I'm your den mother.

520
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,834
That means if you want
to live to see tomorrow,

521
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,809
you do exactly as I say!

522
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,072
Do we understand each other?

523
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,081
Den mother,
you frighten me.

524
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,878
Good.

525
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,078
Now, let's move out!

526
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,929
- I call the front!
- Middle back!

527
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,694
Fine, I'll get the back.

528
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,202
Yeah, he's kind
of a dork, but he's okay.

529
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,568
<i>- How's Helga?
- Helga's fine.</i>

530
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:57,937
<i>- When are you getting home?
- I'm sorry...</i>

531
00:37:58,008 --> 00:38:01,774
Look, Mom, I'd love to stay and chat
all day, but I have homework to do.

532
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,996
Oh, no!
They're back!

533
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:35,133
Hey, Skeever, what glows
in the dark till you squish 'em?

534
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,304
Fireflies!

535
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,982
Please. Leave us alone.

536
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:48,888
This is troop 16 territory.

537
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,325
How are we supposed
to sell raffle tickets

538
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,989
if this place reeks
of your skanky cookies?

539
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:56,259
Hey! Hey!

540
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,927
Boo!

541
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:01,995
Get outta here!

542
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:05,508
- These cookies taste disgusting.
- I know.

543
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:09,512
- We really scared these guys.
- Where are my troops?

544
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,222
Lulu, what happened?

545
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,853
Those boys over there
broke our cookies.

546
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,521
Broke your cookies.

547
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,122
- Mm-hm.
- Lulu, this is not a toy.

548
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,228
Forget those boys. I am here
to protect you, not cookies.

549
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,296
Understand?

550
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:39,536
Good, now get in the car.
We're all going home.

551
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,307
Wait. You can't take us home yet.
You're supposed to take us to eat.

552
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,240
Where do you usually go?

553
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,684
Welcome to Woody Woodchuck's!

554
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,558
Let go!

555
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,194
And they say war is hell.

556
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,238
<i>♪ Whenever we go out ♪

557

561
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:26,384
Ah! I figured you'd
come back for him.

562
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,358
Lulu, watch your brother.
Inexcusable!

563
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:31,951
- I've never left a man behind.
- Oh, relax.

564
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,465
Once we found a kid in the ball pool
when we opened in the morning.

565
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:36,931
Whoa! Whoa!

566
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:41,631
Not cool! Uh, there is no
freestyling in the ball pool!

567
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,982
Should we send
someone in after him?

568
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,820
We're good.

569
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,764
Holy baloney.

570
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,741
Ooh!
Someone's gonna get busted!

571
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,335
- Who are these people?
- What's wrong with this?

572
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:26,713
- We need to talk.
- Don't hate the player, hate the game.

573
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,216
Beat it.

574
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,124
Party's over!

575
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,926
Oh, my God, it's here.

576
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,991
You're all gonna clean
this house spotless.

577
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:48,300
No highway option.
Now, get cleaning.

578
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,340
- I'm outta here!
- Wait! Scott!

579
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,432
Move! Later!

580
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,277
Oh, no, you don't.

581
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,852
This is my favorite shirt.

582
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,570
Thank you.

583
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,973
Come on, Seth! You've
been in there for an hour!

584
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,846
Thanks a lot, Lt. Loser! Now
I'm gonna be the school joke.

585
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,145
I don't know what
I'll say to my friends.

586
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,186
You call those people
your friends?

587
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,746
They have no respect for you.
They have no respect for your home.

588
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,384
You have no respect
for yourself!

589
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,860
I do, too, respect myself!

590
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,295
Company downstairs.
That means you too.

591
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,765
You're not my dad.

592
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,699
In case you
haven't noticed,

593
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,465
this family is going through
a really hard time

594
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,133
and you're just making
everything a lot worse.

595
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,267
You have no feelings.

596
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:37,074
We hate you
and you hate us.

597
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,445
So why don't you
just leave us alone?

598
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,849
Don't worry. When your
mom comes back, I'm gone.

599
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,447
- Now what?
- Scott.

600
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,322
Run! Take the babies!
Go to your rooms!

601
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,950
Shane! Come over here!
Take one of these!

602
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,386
Lulu!

603
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,822
- Get inside. Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Wait!

604
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,081
Don't move.

605
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,526
Ahhhh!

606
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,171
Kids, it's safe!

607
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,872
- Who was that? What'd they want?
- What happened?

608
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,108
- Don't leave us!
- What do they want?

609
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,049
They were after the program
that your father invented.

610
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:01,153
They were after this.

611
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,159
All right, all right, come on,
guys. Let's hope this is it.

612
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,760
<i>- 9-2-6, 3-1-0-4-3.
- 9-2-6...</i>

613
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:15,896
<i>3-1-0-4-3.</i>

614
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,838
<i>They want our
Ghost movie?</i>

615
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,739
Haven't they heard
of Blockbuster?

616
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,802
<i>- Tell her Rita Miller.
- Rita Miller.</i>

617
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:25,814
So there really are people
out there to get us?

618
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:28,442
Yes, there are, Zoe.
That's why I'm here.

619
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:31,578
I think we're gonna need
a little more cooperation.

620
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,113
From now on,
you listen to me...

621
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,955
...and I'll listen to you too.

622
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,455
Deal?

623
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,393
- Relax. Relax.
- I'm relaxed.

624
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,265
- If you just relax...
- I'm relaxed! I'm relaxed!

625
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,271
You've got to relax!
Please, it's on the...

626
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,170
Okay. I'm not
feeling well, here.

627
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,971
- Oh, my God! There's a bee!
- There's no bee!

628
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,604
- There's a bee!
- There's no bee! Stop! Please!

629
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,712
Okay, so she wrecked the car.
The insurance will pay for it.

630
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:05,186
They were parallel parking.
The instructor jumped from the car.

631
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:08,156
But it's not about her.
It's about the boy.

632
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,954
Has he been
skipping class again?

633
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,019
Skipping class? He always
skips sixth period, but...

634
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,154
All right. Seth!

635
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,724
Okay, take off the hat.

636
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,234
Go ahead.

637
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,836
Look at that.
That's how he showed up for practice.

638
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,937
I was doing a little recon in
his locker and I found this.

639
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,906
Okay?

640
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:38,011
If it was a girlie
magazine or a hamster, fine.

641
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:42,024
Boys will be boys.
But this is sick.

642
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,219
All right. He dyed his hair.
He's not a Nazi.

643
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,660
This is not normal.
We're very concerned.

644
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:50,322
Why don't you get back to class?

645
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,800
Mr. Murney, would you
give me a minute?

646
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,370
Look, I'm sure this
is about their father.

647
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:04,813
We've tried to get Seth and Zoe to talk
to the school psychologist, but they won't.

648
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:07,543
Maybe you can get through to them?
See what's going on?

649
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:09,744
I'll talk to them
and see what I can do.

650
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,283
Thanks.

651
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:18,856
Seth, I don't understand
unless you explain it to me.

652
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,329
Why would you join wrestling
if you hate it?

653
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,389
Because my father
wanted me to!

654
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,868
Look, I know you're
just trying to help, but don't!

655
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,132
I can take care of myself.

656
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,489
Refrigerator magnet.

657
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,330
Smart kid.

658
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,961
Red One!

659
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:03,768
You're in charge. Anyone gets within
40 clicks of the perimeter, signal me.

660
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,276
Keep all doors sealed, do
your homework, preheat the oven

661
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,541
and don't let Lulu
in the cookie jar.

662
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,679
- Everything's ready?
- Yeah.

663
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,210
Come on.

664
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:09,598
All right. All my Nazis
are finally here.

665
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,040
I want all of you
at attention!

666
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,476
Okay, let's start

We open in a week, people.
The set isn't finished.

674
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,695
Mother Abbess just quit
because she got shingles!

675
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:13,225
And every step-ball change would
make Bob Fosse rise from the grave

676
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,897
just so he could have
a heart attack again!

677
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:20,568
- I'm really sorry. I'll get it right.
- No, you won't, Seth.

678
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,478
You and your mother
over here can't get it right.

679
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:27,914
And I know this
because I am a professional.

680
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,418
<i>I directed Show Boat
with Greg Brady.</i>

681
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,785
It wasn't union,
but it was good.

682
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,154
Obviously, I quit!

683
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:46,965
Exeunt stage right!

684
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:53,342
Seriously, Seth, if you drop me
again, I'm going to kill you.

685
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,640
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

686
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,612
I'm fine.

687
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,373
Come on.

688
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,543
I'm not gonna quit!

689
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,612
- I don't expect you to understand...
- Hey...

690
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,649
I may not understand a whole
hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,

691
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,252
but I definitely
understand not quitting.

692
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,424
And from what I see,
you're pretty good.

693
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:19,662
A little discipline,
you could make a go of this.

694
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:23,103
- But what about Murney?
- He's an all-talk spaz.

695
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,641
<i>So, The Sound of Music?</i>

696
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,644
- I saw it when I was a kid.
- Really?

697
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:33,411
The idea of a nun ditching her
habit for a guy in the military.

698
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,884
Nothing wrong with that.

699
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,012
Do you think girls
will think I'm weird?

700
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,990
They probably already do, Seth.

701
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:44,322
But you'll kill 'em later.

702
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,624
Come here.

703
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:52,156
Forget about everyone else
for a second.

704
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,500
Is performing
what makes you happy?

705
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,040
Yeah,
more than anything.

706
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,135
All right, fall in.

707
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,977
Company. Center stage.

708
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,514
Company! Center stage!

709
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,455
Who is this guy?

710
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:19,894
Now, do you or do you not have
what it takes to perform this musical?

711
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,763
- We don't have a director.
- I've directed rescue missions

712
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,267
all around the world.

713
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,396
I've directed numerous
snatch-and-grabs

714
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:34,205
from countries whose names
you are not allowed to know.

715
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:38,976
I've choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings

716
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,574
and stealth air attacks!

717
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:46,782
Do you think I have
the military proficiency...

718
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,916
...to direct this production?

719
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,460
Yes.

720
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,395
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir!

721
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,431
Once upon a time,
there was a family...

722
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,297
...of elves.

723
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:04,602
And one day the
little elf family

724
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:08,007
went into the magic forest

725
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,309
to find a secret...

726
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,440
...gnome...

727
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,881
...facility,

728
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:20,821
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium.

729
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:26,829
So three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes

730
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:32,232
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank,

731
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:36,636
finishing off
anything left alive.

732
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:44,878
And not one of those elves
were left behind that day.

733
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,109
We got 'em all.

734
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,450
Even the teeniest...

735
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,459
...littlest elf of all...

736
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,859
...Rodriguez.

737
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,456
You're gonna have to do
the Panda dance or he won't stop.

738
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,058
Oh, come on...

739
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,297
I don't know how to do
the Panda dance.

740
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,862
I'll write it down for you.

741
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,932
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

742
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,774
You gotta do the dance.

743
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:20,976
Like Dad used to do.
He made it up for him.

744
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,712
You have to do the dance
to make him sleep.

745
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:27,688
Come on.

746
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:33,127
<i>♪ When you're down and low ♪
♪ Lower than the floor ♪</i>

747
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:38,498

749
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,963
- Lulu.
- Thank you.

750
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,271
Seth.

751
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,004
Zoe. Uh!

752
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:50,978
Today you drive.

753
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,175
But I can't even
pass Driver's Ed.

754
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,445
Exactly.

755
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,348
We're all gonna die.

756
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,153
Have you ever given
a driving lesson before?

757
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,924
In a minivan? No.

758
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:10,397
Think of it like
a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

759
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,058
Especially when Zoe's driving.

760
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,208
- Zoe Plummer!
- Zoe, what are you doing?

761
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,767
- What are...? Slow down!
- Truck!

762
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,120
Whoa! Whoa!

763
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,055
- Whoa!
- Not bad.

764
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,522
Land! Solid land!

765
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,591
- I think it went well.
- Oh, it's so dramatic.

766
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,527
Hey, hey, hey. No fighting.

767
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,267
- Play nicely.
- Sorry.

768
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,969
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

769
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:58,309
I have noticed an improvement in the
Plummer kids and I'm very impressed.

770
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,474
Yeah, you know,
they're just misunderstood.

771
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:04,111
Peter, careful!
Don't make me come up there!

772
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,883
Someone needs to take the time
to talk to 'em.

773
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:11,290
- You're getting a little attached.
- I take my job very seriously.

774
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,258
But it's like you said.
They're just kids.

775
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:19,529
Well, keep up the good work.

776
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,966
Oh!

777
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,405
You look very nice today.

778
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,409
Oh. Thanks.

779
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,007
I don't think you understand.
Don't you ever do that again.

780
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,517
Is that clear?
Okay, I've had it.

781
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,682
I caught the kid dancing to no music.
I want him out of my class.

782
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:43,658
Somebody's gotta give this punk
a talking to.

783
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,456
Seth?

784
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,396
Well, you got something
to say, twinkle toes?

785
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,502
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Murney.

786
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:55,764
- I quit.
- You quit.

787
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:58,830
You know why you quit?
Because you're a quitter.

788
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,877
And everybody knows
that quitters...

789
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,411
...quit.

790
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,149
What are you scared of, Prancer?

791
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:12,313
- I'm not scared. I want to act.
- And I want to take up origami.

792
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,755
<i>- I'm in The Sound of Music.
- Oh. A musical.</i>

793
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,487
You're giving up wrestling
to be in a musical.

794
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,223
That happens when there
isn't a man in the house.

795
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:25,165
There is a man
in the house. It's me.

796
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:29,227
Well,
it's gotta be a tiny house.

797
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,600
You think you're tough, boy,
don't you?

798
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,281
Wanna shave the tiger?
Do you? Huh?

799
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,182
- You want it tough?
- Where did you wanna do this?

800
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:46,381
- What are you talking about?
- You said you wanted to wrestle.

801
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,617
Where? When?

802
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,252
- After school.
- Okay.

803
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:57,290
- Today?
- That's right. The gym.

804
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,925
Okay?

805
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:03,700
Remember. You mess with
the bull, you get the horns.

806
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:14,846
Out of my way!

807
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:19,752
- How did that feel?
- It was good.

808
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,760
Murney is getting
his butt kicked at 3:00!

809
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,035
Oh, that is so gross.

810
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,508
Come on! Come on!

811
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:44,978
What? That's it!

812
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:48,574
Someone's gonna get hurt today
and you know who it is?

813
00:59:55,558 --> 01:00:00,154
You're about to enter
Murney's House of Pain!

814
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:05,292
What do you say we go over
the rules, cue ball? Huh?

815
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,136
Oooh!

816
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,570
Rule number one.

817
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,906
Never be too eager
to rush your opponent.

818
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:19,778
Wanna play prison rules, frogman?
Wanna play prison rules? You got it.

819
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,875
I'll be your daddy.

820
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,183
Ah!

821
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,090
All right.
Now you've unlocked the beast.

822
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,486
Oh, God!

823
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,293
From this position,
it's relatively easy

824
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:39,960
- to manipulate your opponent.
- Ohhh!

825
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:43,668
And thus we have
the chicken wing.

826
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,165
The chicken wing.

827
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,972
The arm bar.

828
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:53,479
The crow bar.
Or my personal favorite...

829
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:57,383
- Ahhhh!
- ...the pacifier!

830
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,523
Any questions?

831
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,829
Anything you
didn't understand?

832
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,894
Ah. The nipple crippler.

833
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,873
This is a useless, not to mention,
shameless move

834
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:22,934
that ultimately is a sure sign
of desperation.

835
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,179
And finally...

836
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,550
Pinned!

837
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:39,786
That was awesome!

838
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,629
- Are you okay, Murney?
- Get away from me!

839
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,899
Can I get a little help, please?
I can't move my back. Watch the back!

840
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,188
Go!

841
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,227
Sorry!

842
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,100
I didn't get that cone!

843
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,112
Crawl!

844
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,025
See? But he usually
breaks down the door.

845
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:24,764
Excellent!
Now do it backwards.

846
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,839

01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:39,937
You're going to sleep.
Good night, Peter Panda.

862
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,772
Good night, Daddy.

863
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:52,680
Good night, little fella.

864
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,150
Good night.

865
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,371
Hey, Skeever, what do you put in a jar
and shake till they're dead?

866
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,669
Fireflies?

867
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:18,844
Go away
and we won't hurt you.

868
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,950
Hiya!

869
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,160
Don't even think about it.

870
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,414
Cookie!

871

Eat it, you jerk!

872
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,827
Go get 'em!

873
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,960
Customer service.

874
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,632
From now on, you do things our way!

875
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:22,438
No highway option!

- No.

882
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,492
We've been
here two weeks.

883
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,834
This is a matter of
national security.

884
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:54,001
Well, I am sorry, sir, but none
of these answers ring true.

885
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:03,250
Howard. I'm so stupid.

886
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,081
Is it "my angel"?

887
01:07:08,023 --> 01:07:09,923
Yes, it is indeed.

888
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,963
Well, I'll leave you
to your business.

889
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:27,670
Please, Howard,
no more surprises.

890
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:52,357
Zoe, a rookie sniper
could drop you like a deer.

891
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:55,870
- Good.
- Good?

892
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:58,702
All right,
this is about Scott again.

893
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,800
No, it's not.

894
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:07,008
You were right about him.
Stupid guy.

895
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:10,574
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

896
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:15,014
Nothing. Okay.

897
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:28,064
You know, when I was little,
my mom left.

898
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:33,040
My dad was a spec ops
soldier like me.

899
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:39,104
When I was eight, he shipped
me off to military school.

900
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:48,820
I guess he liked being a soldier
more than he liked being a dad.

901
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,654
One day, I get a letter.

902
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,289
No more dad.

903
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,528
That's terrible.

904
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,830
For a long time I thought if I talked
about it, I was letting him down.

905
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:09,776
Like I was supposed to be brave
or something.

906
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,612
Yeah.

907
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,687
It's okay to talk
about your dad, Zoe.

908
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:28,489
I do miss him so much.

909
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,029
I don't know, I just...

910
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:36,401
I wanna be strong for Lulu
and Tyler and Peter

911
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:39,032
and Seth and my mom.

912
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:42,043
That's such
a big burden to carry.

913
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,381
I know.

914
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,119
I miss him so much.

915
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:55,350
It's okay to miss your dad.

916
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:02,764
I'll get it.

917
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,899
- Really?
- Yes.

918
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:10,268
Seth! Seth! Guess what?
Mom's coming home.

919
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,638
- When?
- Tomorrow! She's coming home tomorrow!

920
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,836
- When did you talk?
- Mommy's coming.

921
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,072
Here, buddy,
Mommy's coming home!

922
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,409
Lu, mom's coming home!

923
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:21,039
She is?

924
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,606
She's coming back.

925
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,748
Peter, aren't you excited?

926
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:33,284
- When's she gonna be here?
- So, what are we gonna do?

927
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,889
We should dress up nice.
We should make her something.

928
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:40,162
- We'll clean up the entire house.
- That's a good idea.

929
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:43,864
- We should make a banner too.
- In the family room.

930
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:05,988
What's wrong, Gary?
Foot got stuck?

931
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:10,026
Hang on, hang on.

932
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,426
Okay, now just stay still.

933
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:38,125
Hi. Come on in.

934
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,754
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, almost.

935
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:49,634
<i>- Yes?
- Hey, it's Shane.</i>

936
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:52,196
I have excellent news.
I think I found GHOST.

937
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,435
<i>- Do you have it?
- It's in a steel vault.</i>

938
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:59,004
It needs some sort of two-pronged key.
I've been working on it, but it's tough.

939
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:01,582
Great. Good work.
We're on our way.

940
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,643
Don't do anything further.
I'll be there soon.

941
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,278
Yes, sir.

942
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:10,953
Ready?

943
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:14,052
The good news is,
once I give this to my C.O.,

944
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,962
whoever's been bothering you
ain't gonna be.

945
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,023
- Really?
- Really.

946
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:23,367
What's wrong? Your mother's
coming. You should be happy.

947
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:26,339
But, Shane, doesn't that
mean you have to go?

948
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:30,541
You should get ready.
Your mother will be home soon.

949
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:52,398
I had a fight with Zoe before I left,
so they probably trashed the place.

950
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,415
Welcome home, Mom.

951
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:47,379
Hi! I missed you!

952
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,447
Guy!

953
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,263
Shane, I am so proud of you.
I truly am.

954
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,269
I am going to give you
your choice of assignment.

955
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:06,603
Anywhere you want to go,
you just name it.

956
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,439
Well, I appreciate that.

957
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:12,275
But I'll have to think about it.

958
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:15,209
You're gonna think about it?

959
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:18,253
Well, the military's
all I've ever known.

960
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,255
- I have no regrets.
- I should hope not.

961
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,757
It's just that being
with this family...

962
01:14:23,825 --> 01:14:26,089
- I've never had a...
- Put your hands up!

963
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,623
The Chuns?

964
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,967
You gotta be kidding.
I swear I checked them out.

965
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,267
Give us the key.

966
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:42,003
- Put your hands up!
- Okay. All right.

967
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:43,942
Here.

968
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,441
Now!

969
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,713
You promised us GHOST
months ago!

970
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,816
Well, I'm sorry.
There were delays.

971
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,553
Shane!

972
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:01,494
Stop talking.

973
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,896
Shane's not gonna be
babysitting you anymore.

974
01:15:04,966 --> 01:15:08,561
I trusted you.
Howard trusted you.

975
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:13,665
You've betrayed us
and you've betrayed this country.

976
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:16,643
Guess what?
North Korea pays better.

977
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,909
Chun, watch them.
They're squirmy.

978
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,808
You two, come with me.

979
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:04,014
Did you bring the
stethoscope, Mrs. Chun?

980
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,788
No, but I've
got some C-4.

981
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,866
I just had my eyebrows done.

982
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,193
Quiet!

983
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,936
I said "Quiet,"
you little bug!

984
01:16:54,075 --> 01:16:55,599
Now, Peter!

985
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:56,710
Ah!

986
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:05,646
Hiya!

987
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,711
Well, that's cute!

988
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,712
That stuff doesn't hurt!

989
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,483
Shane! You can't do this!
You can't leave a man behind!

990
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,148
Hold on, I got it.

991
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,520
Shane!

992
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,028
- Where's Mom?
- Mom?

993
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,064
I'll find her.
You guys run and get help!

994
01:17:50,131 --> 01:17:52,565
Hurry!

995
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,534
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

996
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:56,798
Yes, Lulu. Go, get help.

997
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:03,340
Hold on!

998
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,412
They're headed for the car!

999
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,508
- Zoe, call 911.
- I forgot my cell phone.

1000
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,385
- Great. The only time you don't.
- We're gonna be okay!

1001
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,201
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

1002
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:28,497
Find a cop!

1003
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,338
Ahh!

1004
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,024
- He's gaining on us.
- I'll handle it.

1005
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:22,922
Look, Zoe! It's the cops!

1006
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,693
I assume you heard the Baloney
Bandit has struck again.

1007
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:39,934
I accept total responsibility.
My intelligence, well, it was faulty.

1008
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,704
If I had better resources...

1009
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:56,285
I told you not to pass her
in Driver's Ed.

1010
01:19:56,358 --> 01:20:00,053
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

1011
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:03,996
- One, two...
- Bill.

1012
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,533
She doesn't know.

1013
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,866
And you're not taking another
parent away from those kids.

1014
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,406
Leave the family alone
and I'll get you in.

1015
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,998
You better not be bluffing.

1016
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,675
Zoe! Seth!

1017
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:26,585
Lulu! Peter! Tyler!

1018
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:31,184
Ah!

1019
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:34,695
That was the code. I saw Mr. Plummer
use it to open the briefcase.

1020
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:39,723
You think this is a game?
Code or no code, open it. Now.

1021
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,666
You can't make him do this.

1022
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:45,069
I know Howard.

1035
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,136
All right. Go.

1036
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,113
Yeah, right.

1037
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,208
Okay, I'll go first.

1038
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,257
Great work, Shane.
I knew you'd figure it out.

1039
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,424
I think you'd better open it.

1040
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,762
Wait, wait, wait!

1041
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:26,102
Back away.

1042
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,977
You open it.

1043
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:32,444
Come on.
I walked the floor first.

1044
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,675
No way.
You can do it, soldier man.

1045
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:36,442
Ah!

1046
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,529
Ahhh!

1047
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:10,547
Any last words, Shane?

1048
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,677
Say good night,
Peter Panda.

1049
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,457
Shane, are you okay?

1050
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,294
Oh!

1051
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:30,103
She was never
a good neighbor.

1052
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,828
Zoe, you're going too fast!

1053
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,895
You're not gonna
have time to stop!

1054
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:08,340
Who said anything about
stopping? I'm parking.

1055
01:24:21,789 --> 01:24:25,782
- What are you doing to these kids?
- Hands where I can see them!

1056
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,090
Okay. Calm down.

1057
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:30,392
Everybody!
Put your weapons down!

1058
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,202
I want the GHOST.

1059
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:46,410
Um... Calm down.
It's just a duck.

1060
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,779
- Where's the GHOST?
- I have it.

1061
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,250
Bring it here!

1062
01:24:57,892 --> 01:24:59,291
Put it on the ground.

1063
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,561
Now, Gary.
Go for his balls.

1064
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:11,264
Okay, duck whisperer,
step away!

1065
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:19,241
Gary, now!

1066
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,713
Ah!

1067
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,550
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1068
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,501
So I guess you'll be
taking off now, huh?

1069
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:47,269
Seeing as there's no reason
to stick around anymore.

1070
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:50,209
I'm still here,
aren't I?

1071
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,279
Yeah.

1072
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:59,811
- What now?
- I don't know. I'm on dry land.

1073
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,548
True.

1074
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:04,114
Which means you're
the superior officer.

1075
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:06,092
True.

1076
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,060
So you tell me.

1077
01:26:10,898 --> 01:26:11,922
Um...

1078
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:17,998
Lulu!

1079
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,404
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I have a few words?

1080
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,238
Sure.

1081
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,005
Well, we... I... You know.

1082
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:26,679
Oh.

1083
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,978
We'll talk later.

1084
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:34,920
- Mission accomplished, soldier.
- I suppose it is.

1085
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:39,517
- I guess you'll be leaving us now.
- I guess so.

1086
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:43,530
I want you to have this.

1087
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:49,726
Because I don't want you
ever to forget me.

1088
01:26:53,207 --> 01:26:55,903
I will never forget you.

1089
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,847
'Cause you're the
best friend I ever had.

1090
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:04,316
No matter how far...

1091
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:07,183
...or long life takes me away,

1092
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:10,156
I will always be
thinking about you.

1093
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:14,456
I love you, Shane.

1094
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,223
I love you too.

1095
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:31,077
From now on, it's your command.

1096
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:36,040
At ease, soldiers.

1097
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:39,951
Your father would
be so proud of all of you.

1098
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,718

1099
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,453
Look who just woke up.

1100
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:49,286
- Shane?
- Yes?

1101
01:27:49,363 --> 01:27:53,424
- Are we ever gonna see you again?
- What are you talking about?

1102
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,992
We still have one more mission.
