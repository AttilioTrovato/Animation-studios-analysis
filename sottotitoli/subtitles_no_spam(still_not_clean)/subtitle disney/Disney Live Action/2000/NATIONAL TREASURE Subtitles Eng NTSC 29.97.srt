

2
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,212
Grandpa

3
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,813
You aren't supposed
to be up here

4
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:27,845
What're you doing?

5
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:30,177
I just wanted to know

6
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,380
I wouId I supposed

7
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:37,192
I'II say another histories

8
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:40,762
Ok, here we go

9
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:44,828
It was 1832...

10
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:49,270
In a night much Iike this

11
00:02:55,678 --> 00:03:02,015
CharIes Cows was the Iast surviving son
of the DecIaration of Independence

12
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:06,114
He was aIso a member of a secret
society known as the ''Masons''

13
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,686
And he knew he was dying

14
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,725
He woke up in the middIe
of the night

15
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:16,693
And ordered to take him to the
White House to see Andrew Jackson

16
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,027
Because it was urgent

17
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:20,759
And he speaks to the president

18
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,665
He taIked to him?

19
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,967
No, he never got a chance

20
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:32,611
But CharIes Cow had a secret

21
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,979
So he took him to his confidence

22
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:36,914
1 person,

23
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:39,988
My grandfather's grandfather

24
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,190
Thomas Gates

25
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,019
What was the secret?

26
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:48,953
A treasure

27
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:53,669
A treasure beyond aII
the man can own

28
00:03:56,839 --> 00:04:01,936
A treasure that has been fought
over for centuries by pirates..

29
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:08,747
And every time it changed
hands it grew Iarger

30
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:12,717
Then suddenIy

31
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:15,481
It vanished

32
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,454
Again, it appeared
after a thousand years

33
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:23,530
1 knight from the 1st crusade
discovered secret vauIt...

34
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,634
Beneath the TempIe of SoIoman

35
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:27,828
You see the knight who
found the vauIt...

36
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:31,735
BeIieved that the treasure
was too great for anyone man

37
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:34,409
Not even a king

38
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,875
The brought the treaure
back to Europe

39
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:40,244
And took the name
''The Knight's TempIar''

40
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,817
Over the next century they
smuggIed it out of Europe

41
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:48,753
And the formed a new
brotherhood caIIed ''The Free Masons''

42
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:51,451
In honor of the buiIders
of the great tempIe

43
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:55,887
War foIIowed by the time
of the American RevoIution

44
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,326
The treasure had been
hidden again

45
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:02,562
By then the Masons incIuded George
Washington, Benjamin FrankIin...

46
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:10,072
They had to make sure the treasure wouId
never faII into the hands of British

47
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,282
So they divided a series of the
cIues and maps to it's Iocation

48
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:17,181
Over time, the cIues were
Iost or forgotten

49
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:21,119
UntiI onIy 1 remained and that
was the secret that...

50
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:24,816
CharIes Cows entrusted to
young Thomas Gates

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,791
ShieId it

52
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,731
The secret Iies

53
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:36,427
We shieId it

54
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:38,369
Who shieId it?

55
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:41,872
Not even Mr. Cows knew that

56
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,902
Now Iook here then

57
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,514
The Free Masons among
our finding fathers

58
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:49,582
Left this cIue...Iike this

59
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,915
The answer's apparentIy
beyond seeing eyes

60
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,757
SimpIe of the Knight TempIar

61
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,951
Guardian of the treasure

62
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:01,525
They're speaking to us thru this

63
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,390
And it Iaughing at us

64
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,430
You know what that
doIIar represents?

65
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:07,932
The entire Gates famiIy fortunes

66
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:10,662
6 generations of fooIs

67
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,831
Chasing at the fooI's goId

68
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,600
It isn't about the money,
Patrick

69
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,302
It's never been about the money

70
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:18,138
Come on, son, time to go

71
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:21,440
You can say good bye

72
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,326
Grandpa?

73
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:35,826
Are we knights?

74
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,691
You wanna be?

75
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,964
AIrite

76
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,229
KneeI

77
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:56,875
Benjamin FrankIin Gates

78
00:06:57,053 --> 00:07:00,147
You take upon yourseIf the
duty of the TempIar's...

79
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,951
The Free Mansons and
the famiIy Gates

80
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:07,021
Do yourseIf swear

81
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,895
I swear

82
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,579
I was thinking about
Hasen and Harry

83
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:37,556
Crossing this kind of terra without
the dogs sIeigh but on foot

84
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:39,422
Can you imagine?

85
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,291
It's extraordinary

86
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:47,594
We getting cIoser?

87
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,464
Assuming Ben StiIIer is correct

88
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:52,504
And my cracking modeI accurate...

89
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:54,939
We shouId be getting very cIose..

90
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:58,137
Don't go by me, I broke the
shoe Iace this morning

91
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,451
It's a bad omen

92
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,213
ShaII we turn around and go home

93
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:07,447
WeII, we can puII over
to the mountain here

94
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:11,158
Ok

95
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:13,895
RiIey, you aren't missing that IittIe
when you were at the cubicIe...

96
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,054
And we found you, are you?

97
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,095
No...absoIuteIy not

98
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,349
We Iooking for a ship

99
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,147
We don't see any ships

100
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,449
She's out there

101
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,669
Look, this is wasted time

102
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:56,096
How can a ship wind
up way at here?

103
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:59,468
WeII, I'm no expect, but...

104
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,805
It couId be that the HydrothermaI
properties of this region produce...

105
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,711
Hurricane force ice storm that cause
the ocean to freeze and then...

106
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,616
Now turn to refreeze resuIting in an
semi soIid migrating Iand mass...

107
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:17,316
That wouId Iand the ship
rite around here

108
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:07,775
HeIIo beautifuI

109
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:17,214
Go and check the fueI and generator

110
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,380
2 years ago the Hans shown up

111
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,854
I couIdn't beIieve it the
treasure was reaI

112
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:27,962
You'd have found it I've no doubt

113
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:32,032
That's why I do this crazy investment
that everyone says

114
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:35,294
I'm just reIief that I'm not as
crazy as everyone says

115
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:37,029
I say my dad was

116
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,367
Or my grand dad

117
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,099
Or my great grand dad

118
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:43,976
Ok, Iet's go

119
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,216
Let's go find some treasure

120
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:29,818
God!

121
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,660
This is it

122
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,365
It's Cargo haII

123
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:52,075
What you think were in the
barreIs?

124
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:12,696
Gunpowder

125
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:25,704
Why wouId the captain be
going in this barreI?

126
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,268
I've found something

127
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,611
What is it?

128
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:19,225
Do you guys know what this is?

129
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:21,599
It's a biIIion-doIIar pipe

130
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:24,635
It's an unusuaI pipe

131
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,801
Wow, it's beautifuI

132
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:32,505
Is it a miIIion doIIar pipe?

133
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:34,309
No, it's a cIue

134
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:39,752
What? do you break it?

135
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:42,355
We're 1 step cIoser to the
treasure, gentIeman

136
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,956
What you said that the treasure
wouId be on the CharIotte

137
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:47,289
No, the secret Iies were CharIotte

138
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:49,294
I say it couId be here

139
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:08,282
The TempIar's symboI

140
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:16,320
''The Iegend read''

141
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,449
''The stain affected''

142
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:20,458
''The key in siIence''

143
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:24,622
''Undetected 55 in annum 10''

144
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:28,369
''Mr. Mat Lock can offend''

145
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,140
This is a riddIe

146
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,177
I need to think

147
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,648
The Iegend read

148
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:45,844
The stain affected

149
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,349
What Iegend?

150
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,757
It was a Iegend of the treasure

151
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,588
That effects the Iand? how?

152
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,394
The key in siIence undetected

153
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,761
Wait

154
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,236
The Iegend, the key,
I know something...

155
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,405
The map, maps've Iegend,
map've key

156
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,177
It's a map, invisibIe map

157
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:14,441
Wait a minute, what do
you mean invisibIe?

158
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,016
An invisibIe map

159
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:20,313
The stain infect can refer
to die or anything...

160
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,413
Used to bring about certain resuIt

161
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:24,526
Combine with the key in siIence

162
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,922
Undetected the Iubrication
is that the fact...

163
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:29,520
Is to make what was
undetectabIe detectabIe

164
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:34,635
And Iast, the key in siIence
couId be...

165
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,928
Prison

166
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,543
It's knuckIe

167
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:44,110
It's where the map is

168
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:46,304
It says 55 Iron Pen,
Iron Pen is a prison

169
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:49,508
Or it couId be since the primary
writing medium of the time...

170
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:54,979
The pen is just the pen

171
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:56,921
But then why not say a pen,
why..

172
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,889
Why say Iron pen

173
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:01,322
Because it's a prison

174
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:05,230
Iron pen, the iron doesn't
describe the ink in the pen

175
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:08,962
It describes what was pen...

176
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:12,965
It was iron, it was firm,
it was mineraI, no...

177
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:15,441
Wait a minute it was stupid

178
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:19,476
It was firm, it was eIement,
it was resoIved

179
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:22,845
It was resoIved

180
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:26,113
Mr Mat Lock can offend

181
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:29,324
To anything Mat Lock was described
with the continent or congress

182
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,618
And to make sure he couIdn't
offend the map...

183
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:36,127
He was put on the back of the
resoIution...

184
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:38,492
That he transcripts the resoIution...

185
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,602
That 55 men inside

186
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:46,303
The DecIaration Independence

187
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,109
Come on there's no visibIe
map on the

188
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,184
At the back of The DecIaration
of Independence

189
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:58,581
That's cIever reaIIy

190
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:01,483
The document's important to
ensure the map's survivaI

191
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:04,585
You and said there were severaI
Masons, have you?

192
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,052
Yeah, I know it for sure

193
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:11,558
WeII, Iet's arrange a way
to exam it

194
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:15,695
This is 1 of the most important
documents in history...

195
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,865
And I just gonna Iet us
run chemicaI test on it

196
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,371
You proposed we do

197
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,307
I don't know

198
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,208
We couId borrow it

199
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:30,747
SteaI it?

200
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:34,081
I don't think so

201
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:35,449
Ben...

202
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:36,919
The treasure of the
Knight's TempIar...

203
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,786
Is the treasure of aII treasures

204
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,686
Oh, I didn't know that reaIIy?

205
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,897
Look, Ben

206
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,063
I understand your bitterness,
I reaIIy do

207
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:48,632
You spend your entire Iife
searching of this treasure...

208
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,637
And you've to respect to historicaI
community treat you and your famiIy...

209
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:54,104
With mockery and contempt

210
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:57,245
You shouId be out of the tragic
and their arrogant faces

211
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:59,471
And I want you to have
a chance to do that

212
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,345
How?

213
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:05,418
We wouId've an areas
of expertise

214
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,855
You don't admire Iimited
drastic change, do you?

215
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,315
Neither do I

216
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:14,963
I arrange a number of
operations of...

217
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,694
Question him whenever
you've to

218
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:24,399
You take his word you'II be fine

219
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:29,237
So, don't worry
I may caII the arrangement

220
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:32,573
No

221
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:39,714
We reaIIy do wanna heIp you

222
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:44,985
Ian, I'm not gonna Iet you steaI
the DecIaration of Independence

223
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:47,059
Ok

224
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,457
From this pIace zone we

You gonna shoot me, Shaw?

227
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,137
But you can't shoot me

228
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,603
There's more of the riddIe

229
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,210
Information you don't have I do

230
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:07,142
How're you gonna figure it out,
you know that

231
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,611
He's bIuffing

232
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,413
We pIay poker together

233
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:14,556

00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,727
Look, what're you standing?

237
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,462

238
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,663
If you shoot me, I drop this

239
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,240
We aII go up

240
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:36,808
Then?

241
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,278
What time the fIare burns down?

242
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:44,250

243
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:49,250
You need to know shot and catch

244
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,130
Must try you....

245
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,508
Get the heII out, Shaw!

246
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:25,787
RiIey, get over here!

247
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,331
What is it?

248
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,365
SmuggIer smoke, get in!

249
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,632
Men, get out of here!

250
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,675
Lawrence get out!

251
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:44,471
FoIIow me

252
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,879
Get down!

253
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,753
Ok Iet's go

254
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,758
There's a viIIage 9 miIes
eastern here

255
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,824
It's probabIy a push piIot

256
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,664
Now what are we gonna do?

257
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,461
Star making a way back home

258
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:19,706
How about Ian, he's gonna steaI the
DecIaration of Independence then

259
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:22,568
We'II stop him

260
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,426
It's reaIIy so hard to beIieve
that someone is trying to steaI...

261
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,155
The DecIaration of Independence

262
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,198
The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week

263
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:48,767
They aren't gonna worried about
something they sure is safe

264
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:51,397
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy

265
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:53,804
And anyone is crazy enough to
beIieve us isn't gonna wanna heIp

266
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,840
I don't need someone crazy...

267
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:57,844
But 1 step sure crazy,
what do you get?

268
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,344
Obsessed

269
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:02,775
Passionate

270
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:18,333
Dr Chase can see you now,
Mr Brown

271
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,556
Thank you

272
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:20,700
Mr Brown?

273
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:23,669
FamiIy name doesn't aIIow our
respect in the academic community

274
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,803
Think about nobIe man

275
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:30,069
Very cute, man

276
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:31,804

277
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:33,776

00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:42,956

282
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:44,989
Your accent, PennsyIvania Dutch?

283
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:46,560
Sexon in German

284
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,060
You aren't American?

285
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:52,290
I'm American, I just wasn't
born here

286
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:53,866
PIease don't touch that

287
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:55,402
Sorry, unique coIIection

288
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,299
George Washington's
campaign buttons

289
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,997
You missing the 1789 in Ecuador

290
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:01,200
I found 1

291
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:02,842
That's very fortunate for you

292
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:04,943
Had you toId my assistant
that's an urgent matter?

293
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,012
Yes, madam

294
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,408
I'II get straight to the point

295
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:13,819
Someone is gonna steaI the
DecIaration of Independence

296
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,584
It's true

297
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,193
I think I better put you gentIemen
in touch with the FBI

298
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:24,592
We've been to the FBI

299
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:25,664
And?

300
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:28,495
They're assure that the DecIaration
can't possibIy be stoIen

301
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:29,761
They're rite

302
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,802
My friend and I are certain,
however...

303
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,500
If we were given the priviIege of
examining the document

304
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,943
We'd be abIe to teII you for certain
if you were actuaIIy in any danger

305
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:41,345
What do you think you're gonna
find?

306
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:46,953
WouId you beIieve that there's
an encryption on the back

307
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:50,823
An encryption Iike a code?
-Yes, madam

308
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,358
Of what?

309
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:55,325
CaIIigraphy

310
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:57,961
A map
-Yes madam

311
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,259
A map of what?

312
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:11,042
The Iocation of hidden isIands
of historic and intrinsic vaIue

313
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,581
A treasure map?

314
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:16,740
That's what we Iost FBI

315
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:18,944
You're treasure hunters,
aren't you?

316
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:22,250
We're more Iike treasure protectors

317
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:26,517
Mr Brown, I've personaIIy seen the back
of the DecIaration of Independence

318
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:29,994
And I promise you the onIy thing
there's a quotation that reads...

319
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:35,169
OriginaI DecIaration of Independence
stated 4th JuIy 1776, yes madam

320
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:37,168
But no map

321
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:52,485
It's invisibIe

322
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,587
AIrite

323
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:57,349
And hence we Iost the
Department of HomeIand Security

324
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,987
What Iikes you 2 assume
there's an invisibIe map?

325
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,024
We've found an engraving on
a stamp of a 200-year-oId pipe

326
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,930
Known by Free Mansons

327
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,067
May I see the pipe?

328
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:12,195
We don't have it

329
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:14,868
Then, take it

330
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,737
AIrite, nice meeting you

331
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,172
Nice to meet you too

332
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:22,076
You know that reaIIy
is a nice coIIection

333
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:25,218
Must've taken a Iong time though
pound down aII that history

334
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:31,684
ConsteIIation of unique events

335
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,219
It's aIrite

336
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:38,725
What if we figure pubIic press the
story aII over the internet

337
00:26:40,535 --> 00:26:43,129
We've a reputation to worry about

338
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:46,568
AIthough that's exactIy gonna
scare him away

339
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,040
For 180 years of searching...

340
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:54,306
For aII the ideas of
became the United States

341
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:57,017
There's a Iine here into the
hearts of aII the others

342
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:59,613
When a Iong trained of abuses

343
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:03,422
Presume very Iate the
same object

344
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:06,992
Events is designed to reduce
absoIute despotism

345
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:10,723
And it's their rights and it's their
duty to throw off such government

346
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:14,025
And provide new guards for
their future security

347
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:18,865
PeopIe won't taIk that way anymore

348
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,771
BeautifuI

349
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:23,442
No idea what you said

350
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:25,078
It means there's something wrong

351
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,082
There's where the abiIity to take action
have the responsibiIity to take action

352
00:27:34,055 --> 00:27:36,421
I must steaI it

353
00:27:38,193 --> 00:27:40,491
What?

354
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:44,465
I must steaI the DecIaration
of Independence

355
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:54,036
This is huge!

356
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,905
Prison, huge

357
00:27:57,078 --> 00:27:58,909
You gonna end up in
prison you know that?

358
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,914
Yeah, probabIy

359
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,282
Ian is gonna try to steaI it

360
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:08,888
If he succeeds he'II destroy
the DecIaration

361
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:12,457
That fact is the onIy way to protect
the DecIaration is to steaI it

362
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:14,719
It's up side down

363
00:28:16,164 --> 00:28:18,257
I don't think this is a choice

364
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:21,362
Ben, for God's sake

365
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:24,333
It's Iike steaIing a
NationaI Monument

366
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,871
It's Iike steaIing him

367
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,532
It can't be done

368
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,368
Not it shouIdn't be done

369
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:32,309
It can't be done

370
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,310
Let me proof it to you

371
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,114
Ok, Ben, pay attention

372
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,754
I've brought you to the
Iibrary of congress

373
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:44,455
Why? because it's the biggest
Iibrary in the worId

374
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:46,718
Over 20 miIIion books

375
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:49,394
They aII saying the exact thing

376
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:51,325
Listen to RiIey

377
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,360
What we've here, my friend

378
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:56,333
Is the entire Iayout of the achieve

379
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,832
Those are the bIue prints

380
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:00,941
We've got construction modeIs

381
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:02,734
Phone Iines

382
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:04,876
Water in surge

383
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,445
It's aII here

384
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,173
Ok, when the DecIaration
is on dispIay, ok

385
00:29:09,284 --> 00:29:12,481
It's surrounded by guards
and video monitors

386
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:14,314
And a IittIe famiIy from Iowa...

387
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,456
And IittIe kids on
engraved fieId trip

388
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:18,693
And beneath inch of buIIet
proof gIass

389
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,829
Is an army censor and heat
monitors that wiII go off...

390
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:24,362
If someone gets too cIose
with high fever

391
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:28,102
Now, when it isn't dispIayed...

392
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:31,367
It was Iowered into a 4 foot thick...

393
00:29:31,573 --> 00:29:35,168
Concrete, steaI fataI vauIt

394
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:40,437
That happens to be equipped
with the eIectronic combination Iock

395
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:42,878
And by a matrix access
deniaI system

396
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:46,248
You know Thomas Eddison tried
and faiIed nearIy 2000 times...

397
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:49,914
To deveIop the carbonized threat
fiIament for the Iight buIb?

398
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:51,590
Eddison

399
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:53,522
When he asked about it
he said ''I didn't faiI''...

400
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:56,253
I found out 2000 ways how
to make a Iight buIb

401
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:59,398
And then I found 1 way
to make it worked

402
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:02,732
The preservation room

403
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:05,501
Enjoy, go ahead

404
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:08,742
Do you know what the
preservation room for?

405
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:11,370
DeIicious jams and jeIIies?

406
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:15,045
No, there's where they cIean and repair
and maintain aII the documents...

407
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:18,083
In the storage house when they
aren't on dispIay or in the baId

408
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,150
When the case this works...

409
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:22,256
You take it out of vauIt,
directIy cross the haII

410
00:30:22,357 --> 00:30:24,348
And into the preservation room

411
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:28,392
The best time for us or Ian to steaI
wouId be during the GaIa this weekend

412
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:31,259
And the guards just distracted
by the VIP up stairs

413
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:36,696
The preservation room where
there's much Iess security

414
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:43,107
Ian...

415
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:46,269
Preservation...

416
00:30:47,015 --> 00:30:49,449
The GaIa...

417
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:53,149
This might be possibIe

418
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:55,556
It might

419
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:42,966
Here you are

420
00:31:43,204 --> 00:31:44,831
HeIIo

421
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:58,784
That's what I want

422
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:13,160
Game on

423
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:26,463
This is just came for you

424
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:29,170
I hope it isn't from Stan

425
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:35,614
''For the woman who's everything eIse
...thanks for Iistening, pauI Brown''

426
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:20,591
AbigaiI Chase

427
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:38,803
Hey Mike

428
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:45,042
On a document IeveI

429
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:46,810
No probIem

430
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,182
Where do you go?

431
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:49,550
Went off the DecIaration frame

432
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,022
RightfuI diagnostic and
I want them aII changed out

433
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,159
Your pIan is working

434
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,762
Ben, are you sure that
we shouId do that?

435
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,439
RiIey...

436
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:41,700
Can you hear me?

437
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,275
UnfortunateIy, yeah

438
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:46,780
I want you to go around,
to the front...

439
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,848
And present you invitation
and have to show your ID

440
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,178
Go ahead

441
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:04,661
Your invitation and your ID pIease

442
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,147
How do you Iook?

443
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:26,048
Not bad

444
00:36:34,262 --> 00:36:36,287
This is it

445
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,653
For you

446
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:11,692
Mr Brown

447
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:12,799
Dr Chase

448
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,491
What're you doing here?

449
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:16,102
Is that that hot gaI?

450
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:17,499
How does she Iook?

451
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:19,606
I made a Iast minute donation

452
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:23,435
And I subject to thank
you for your wonderfuI gift

453
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:24,635
You did get it

454
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:25,711
Yes
-Oh Good

455
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:26,676
Thank you

456
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:29,783
You know I reaIIy couIdn't accept
something Iike this normaIIy, but...

457
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,680
I reaIIy want it

458
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,185
WeII, you needed it

459
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:35,788
Come on Romeo, get out of there

460
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,354
I happened wondering though...

461
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:40,585
But the engraving indicated
on the pipe with big foot

462
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:46,329
Dr HeraId this is Mr. Brown

463
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:48,365
Hi
-Hi there

464
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:49,730
Who is this?

465
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,701
Why not Iet me take that

466
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:54,397
So that you can take
that off his hand

467
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:56,440
Thank you

468
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:58,110
Let's toast

469
00:37:58,412 --> 00:38:00,573
To hired treason

470
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:03,717
This is what Nemo community when
they sang the DecIaration

471
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:08,787
Here wouId've Iost war, here wouId've
been hanged, beheaded, drowned...

472
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:12,785
My personaI favorite had
their eternaI cut out and burnt

473
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:19,062
So, here's to the man who
did what was considered wrong...

474
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,626
And aII they do what they
knew was rite

475
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:26,805
What they knew was rite

476
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:40,185
Good night
-Good night

477
00:38:40,388 --> 00:38:42,117
Good night

478
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:02,704
Ok..Go!

479
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:30,830
30 seconds

480
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:41,342
How does it Iook?

481
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:45,610
It's working

482
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:48,821

00:49:53,026 --> 00:49:54,550
Souvenir

594
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,187

So you owe me $35 pIus tax

598
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:06,566
Genius

599
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:08,072
Who were those men?

600
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:10,936
Just the guys we warned you

Pretty sure she was swearing too

607
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,186
WeII, you probabIy deserve that

608
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:33,089
Ladies and GentIemen

614
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:47,273
Thank you

615
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:51,481
The positive ID search everyone

616
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,380
IncIuding the security staff

617
00:50:53,587 --> 00:50:55,817
If they refuse detained
then get warrants

618
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:58,981
Yes, agent Andres,
you've something?

619
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,395
This isn't a day for ''umm''

620
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:04,564
We got a tips severaI days ago...

621
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:07,096
That someone was gonna steaI
the DecIaration of Independence

622
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,259
Do you've a names
of the tipster?

623
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:11,427
There's no fiIe opened...

624
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:13,800
We didn't find the info credibIe

625
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:16,541
How about now?

626
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:21,311
There isn't a treasure map on the
back of DecIaration of Independence

627
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,642
And there's no chance
anyone can steaI this...

628
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:25,374
Either

629
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:29,184
I Iet you to know 100%/0 everything

630
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:31,290
I want that document, Mr. Brown

631
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:34,022
Ok, my name isn't Brown,
it's Gates

632
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:38,491
Wait a minute,
do you just say Gates?

633
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:41,561
Gates?

634
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:45,197
You're that famiIy with that conspiracy
series about the founding father's?

635
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:47,566
It isn't a conspiracy theory

636
00:51:47,808 --> 00:51:48,934
Crusade

637
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,938
You know what I take it back,
you aren't a Iiar...

638
00:51:51,144 --> 00:51:52,509
You're insane

639
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,670
There's a copy of the
DecIaration on dispIay now?

640
00:51:54,848 --> 00:51:56,338
Yes, we decided...
-Leave it there

641
00:51:56,616 --> 00:51:59,210
They guess there was something
happen, but they don't know what

642
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:01,479
They got them at the service
entrance

643
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:04,317
AIso we found bIood casings

644
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:06,423
How you got description
from other guards?

645
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:07,525
Which guard?

646
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:09,390
They guard who found the body

647
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:11,588
We running out guard to
patroI down here

648
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:18,197
So, who was shooting,
who was they shooting at?

649
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:21,201
And why weren't they
getting aIong?

650
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:24,171
You can't seriousIy intend to
run chemicaI test on...

651
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:25,675
The DecIaration of Independence

652
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:27,245
In the back of a moving van?

653
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,142
We've aII environment aII set up,
idiot...

654
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,476
That suit particuIar aIpha ration
system

655
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:32,877
ReaIIy?

656
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:34,280
We can't go back there

657
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:35,385
What?

658
00:52:35,555 --> 00:52:36,385
Why not?

659
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:37,681
This is the guy

660
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:39,825
Dr HeraId said Dr Chase introduced
him to Mr. Brown

661
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,325
Not in the guest's Iist

662
00:52:41,628 --> 00:52:43,653
The gift tour cIerk,
she said he seemed...

663
00:52:43,897 --> 00:52:46,798
Look, she said he tried to waIked
out with a copy of...

664
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:48,901
The DecIaration of Independence
without paying

665
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,399
He paid with the VISA

666
00:52:52,572 --> 00:52:54,665
Charge Benjamin Gates

667
00:52:55,709 --> 00:52:57,438
A credit card sIip?

668
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:01,506
They got your record forever

669
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:03,376
They got my record...
-I know...I know

670
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,643
It's onIy the matter if the FBI
shows up on my front door

671
00:53:05,785 --> 00:53:06,911
What do we do?

672
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,121
We need those Ietters

673
00:53:09,222 --> 00:53:10,712
What Ietters?

674
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:14,683
You know, get off the road,
take a ride

675
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:16,428
What Ietters?

676
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:22,562
Just those 2?

677
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:24,330
We've scanned the originaI's

678
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:26,069
Quite pIease

679
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,837
How did you get scan?

680
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:29,669
I know the person who's
the originaI

681
00:53:33,647 --> 00:53:35,274
Why do you need them?

682
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:37,076
You can't shut her mouth,
can you?

683
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:39,046
I teII you what, Iook

684
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:41,219

685
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,652
To promise to shut up,
pIease

686
00:53:44,457 --> 00:53:46,015
Thank you

687
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:49,356
Ben, you know what you've to do

688
00:53:49,596 --> 00:53:51,496
You what I've to do, I'm just trying
to think of anything eIse...

689
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:52,723
We couId do

690
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:54,627
We aren't to be a ...

691
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:58,333
But you do reaIize how many
peopIe we've after us

692
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:01,572
They probabIy have us
on sateIIite by now

693
00:54:03,677 --> 00:54:06,874
I took here aII of 2 seconds
to decide the skiII...

694
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,911
The DecIaration of Independence

695
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:11,879
Yeah, but I don't think I'II
personaIIy have to teII my dad about it

696
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:14,447
Hey knock, cooI!

697
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:17,045
Let me go!

698
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:19,218
Ok, you're Iet go! go!

699
00:54:19,726 --> 00:54:21,694
I'm not going not without
the DecIaration

700
00:54:21,895 --> 00:54:23,453
You aren't going with
the DecIaration

701
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:27,363
Yes, I am, I'm not Ietting it
out of my sight so I'm going

702
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:30,901
Wait, you aren't going with
us with the DecIaration

703
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:34,234
Yes, I am
-No, you aren't

704
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:37,706
Look, if you wanna Ieave me behind

705
00:54:37,877 --> 00:54:40,072
You shouIdn't have to me
where you'II be going

706
00:54:56,229 --> 00:54:58,129
CIear

707
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:05,369
We get you somewhere?

708
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,037
They digitaI scan Ietters...

709
00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:11,672
Written 1722

710
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:14,010
They aII from the same person

711
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,740
''Your HumbIe servant,
SiIence Dogord''

712
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:36,932
GentIemen, why is these
words capitaIized?

713
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,030
Because it's important?

714
00:55:42,442 --> 00:55:45,343
Because it's a name

715
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:47,305
Ok, I got it

716
00:55:47,547 --> 00:55:50,209
Ben FrankIin was on his 15 years
oId secretIy wrote 14 Ietters...

717
00:55:50,383 --> 00:55:53,181
To his brother's news paper pretending
to be a middIe age pseudo named...

718
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:54,786
SiIence Dogord

719
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:57,856
This treasure written by
Benjamin FrankIin huh?

720
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:05,757
Looks ok

721
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,357
Park the car coupIe bIocks away

722
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:11,366
We'II get a coupIe hours at Ieast

723
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:13,063
I hope

724
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:14,467
We do we do about her?

725
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,131
I've some dark tape at the back

726
00:56:16,976 --> 00:56:18,238
No that won't be necessary

727
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:19,571
Sure you won't be any troubIe

728
00:56:19,813 --> 00:56:20,745
Promise you won't be in any
troubIe

729
00:56:20,914 --> 00:56:22,006
I promise

730
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:24,013
See, she's curious

731
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:29,421
This is what I got on Gates

732
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,717
The Grad on American History
from Georgetown

733
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:33,959

Navy ROTC in NavaI Diving
in Southern Training Center

735
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,558
Wanna know what this guy
wanna be when he grew up?

736
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:43,832
We keep our focus on Gates

737
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:45,434
Run him to ground

738
00:56:45,939 --> 00:56:48,965
CIosest reIative 1st

739
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,042
Dad

740
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:01,717
Where's your buddy?

741
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:06,217
I'm in a IittIe troubIe

742
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:09,220
Is she pregnant?

743
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:12,364
WeII, she's the woman who
onIy carrying your grandchiId...

744
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:14,399
Standing out of the cooI

745
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:17,026
I'm pregnant?

746
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:24,306
This better not to
be the dumb treasure

747
00:57:30,016 --> 00:57:31,950
WeII, have a seat

748
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:33,307
Make yourseIf comfortabIe

749
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,680
There's some pizza...

750
00:57:34,888 --> 00:57:36,378
StiII warm I think

751
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:37,920
Dad...

752
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:41,925
I need the SiIence Dogord Ietters

753
00:57:42,695 --> 00:57:44,629
Yeah, it's about the treasure

754
00:57:44,864 --> 00:57:46,593
Are they 2 drag you into
this nonsense?

755
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:47,927
LiteraIIy

756
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:49,263
I voIunteer

757
00:57:49,536 --> 00:57:52,004
Then, voIunteer before
you waste your Iife

758
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:53,264
Knock it off, dad

759
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,030
Sure...I know, I'm the famiIy cook

760
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:57,004
I've a job, a house,
heaIth insurance

761
00:57:57,243 --> 00:57:58,904
At Ieast I had your mother

762
00:57:59,012 --> 00:58:00,479
For however brief of the time

763
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:01,841
At Ieast I had you

764
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:03,107
What do you have?

765
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,941
Him?

766
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:08,280
If you just give us the
Ietters we're gone

767
00:58:08,455 --> 00:58:10,320
You disappoint me, Ben

768
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,815
Maybe that's the reaI Gates
famiIy Iegacy

769
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:14,755
Sons who disappoint their fathers

770
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:17,558
Get out

771
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:20,057
Take your troubIes with you

772
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:26,871
I found the CharIotte

773
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:35,613
CharIotte,
you mean she's a ship

774
00:58:35,782 --> 00:58:38,216
Yes, she was beautifuI,
she's amazing dad

775
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:39,717
And the treasure?

776
00:58:40,487 --> 00:58:43,456
No...but we found another cIue
that Ied us here

777
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:45,815
Another day you do another cIue

778
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,816
And I saw you ever find another
cIue

779
00:58:47,994 --> 00:58:48,858
Don't you get it, Ben?

780
00:58:48,962 --> 00:58:50,452
I finaIIy figure it out

781
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,996
The Iegend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British

782
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:54,530
But what reaIIy happened was

783
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:57,328
Legend was invented keep
the British occupied...

784
00:58:57,604 --> 00:58:59,162
Searching for buried treasure

785
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,602
Treasure is a myth

786
00:59:02,308 --> 00:59:04,868
I refuse to beIieve that

787
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,480
WeII you can beIieve what you
want you're a grown person

788
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:15,052
What am I doing?

789
00:59:15,288 --> 00:59:16,755
Do what you want, Ben

790
00:59:19,592 --> 00:59:20,957
He's probabIy rite

791
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,187
We don't even know if
there's another cIue

792
00:59:25,932 --> 00:59:28,298
WeII, I can think another
way to find out

793
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:30,492
We can find out rite now

794
00:59:48,154 --> 00:59:51,123
Looks Iike animaI's skin
how Iong is it?

795
00:59:51,357 --> 00:59:53,291
At Ieast 200 years

796
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:55,053
ReaIIy? sure

797
00:59:57,463 --> 00:59:59,624
If this thing got an invisibIe
Iink we gotta Iook at it

798
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:01,197
Throw in the oven

799
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:04,799
SeIf-fading can onIy be
brought out by heat

800
01:00:05,038 --> 01:00:07,939
Yes, but this...
-This is very oId

801
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:09,904
It's very oId and...

802
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:12,307
And we can't risk
compromising the map

803
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:14,870
You need a reIigion

804
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:17,173
Dad, it's reaIIy Iate why
don't you get some rest

805
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:19,075
I'm fine

806
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:21,846
Lemons

807
01:00:26,092 --> 01:00:28,822
You can't do that

808
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:30,490
But it's to be done

809
01:00:30,763 --> 01:00:34,199
Let someone who's trained to
handIe antique documents gonna do it

810
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:37,098
Ok

811
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:44,839
Now, if there's a secret message

812
01:00:45,178 --> 01:00:50,013
It'II probabIy be marked by
a symboI in a right up hand corner

813
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:52,280
That's rite

814
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:57,979
I'm sure getting fired for this

815
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:30,852
I toId you, you need heat

816
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:49,741
See?

817
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,740
We need more juice
-We need more heat

818
01:02:08,194 --> 01:02:10,128
This isn't a map

819
01:02:11,164 --> 01:02:13,564
More cIues, what a surprised

820
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:15,199
This is a Iatitudes
and Iongitudes?

821
01:02:15,368 --> 01:02:16,835
This is why we need
SiIence Dogord's Ietters

822
01:02:17,236 --> 01:02:18,567
That's the key?

823
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:20,330
It's the key in siIence
I wanna detect it

824
01:02:22,308 --> 01:02:24,799
Somebody pIease expIain to
me what's this magic numbers are?

825
01:02:28,014 --> 01:02:29,504
That's rite

826
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,518
It's just codes

827
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,119
Each of these 3 numbers
correspond to a word in a key

828
01:02:37,423 --> 01:02:40,483
UsuaIIy on a book
or on news papers

829
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:42,692
In this case the SiIence
Dogord's Ietters

830
01:02:42,962 --> 01:02:44,896
It's Iike the page number
of the key tags

831
01:02:45,164 --> 01:02:46,324
The Iine on the page

832
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:48,431
And the Ietter in that Iine

833
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:50,865
So dad, where are the Ietters?

834
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,205
Your grandfather couIdn't find them
-Dad

835
01:02:57,343 --> 01:02:58,867
They were in an antique desk

836
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:03,415
Dad, where are the Ietters

837
01:03:03,616 --> 01:03:07,108
I don't have them, son
-What?

838
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,754
I don't have them

839
01:03:16,195 --> 01:03:17,526
Where are they?

840
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:20,561
I donated them to the FrankIin
Institute in PhiIadeIphia

841
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:22,894
Time to go

842
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:25,928
I stiII can't beIieve it

843
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:28,000
AII these time none knows...

844
01:03:28,174 --> 01:03:29,266
What's at the back

845
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:31,500
The back of what?
-No!

846
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:34,479
Oh my God

847
01:03:34,614 --> 01:03:35,876
I know

848
01:03:36,115 --> 01:03:37,514
What've you done this is...

849
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,639
I know

850
01:03:38,918 --> 01:03:41,284
DecIaration of Independence
-Yes

851
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:43,555
And it's very deIicate

852
01:03:43,756 --> 01:03:45,348
You stoIe it

853
01:03:45,591 --> 01:03:47,456
Dad, I can expIain but
I don't have time

854
01:03:47,593 --> 01:03:49,185
It was necessary

855
01:03:49,595 --> 01:03:50,960
And you saw the cypher

856
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:52,256
And that wiII Iead to another cIue

857
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,360
There's no treasure...

858
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,158
I wasted 20 years of my Iife

859
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:58,427
And it'II destroy aII yours

860
01:04:00,072 --> 01:04:02,404
And you puII me into aII these

861
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,135
No, we can't have that

862
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,916
I'm in here

863
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:17,518
FBI rite

864
01:04:20,393 --> 01:04:23,590
Are you gonna untied me?

865
01:04:26,132 --> 01:04:28,225
And you've no idea where
he's going?

866
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:30,262
I wouId've toId you if I did

867
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:31,970
WouId you

868
01:04:32,438 --> 01:04:34,406
He tied me to a chair

869
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:38,340
The garage is empty but there's a
CadiIIac registered to Patrick Gates

870
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:40,408
He stoIe my car

871
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:42,839
AIrite, Mr. Gates,
we'II find your car

872
01:04:43,015 --> 01:04:44,539
And your son

873
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:51,982
I think we shouId change cIoths

874
01:04:54,393 --> 01:04:57,226
I Iove to go shopping too
but we've no money

875
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,021
Here, I took this from the house

876
01:05:00,132 --> 01:05:02,157
UsuaIIy there's a few
hundred doIIars

877
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:05,360
''Common Sense''
how appropriate

878
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:08,336
When we'II be at there, I'm hungry

879
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:11,367
This car smeIIs weird

880
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,341
PhiIadeIphia, PennsyIvania

881
01:05:53,653 --> 01:05:55,587
Excuse me

882
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:58,914
Sorry sir
excuse me

883
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:09,497
S. S. A. N. D
-Ok

884
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:13,465
Are you sure this is rite?

885
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,237
Ok

886
01:06:19,912 --> 01:06:21,812
No, ''N''

887
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:24,141
Doesn't Iook Iike an ''N''

888
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:28,452
You know what, here, Iast one

889
01:06:31,023 --> 01:06:33,287
1 more doIIar
-Thank you

890
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:35,450
Go get the Iast 4 Ietters

891
01:06:35,928 --> 01:06:37,691
Go get them, come on

892
01:06:56,849 --> 01:07:01,616
Vision to see the treasure
past comes as a tiny shadow...

893
01:07:02,521 --> 01:07:05,752
Crosses in front of the
house pass and...

894
01:07:06,158 --> 01:07:08,319
Pass and what?

895
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:51,830
What's going on?

896
01:07:53,506 --> 01:07:55,804
I'm not sure

897
01:07:58,044 --> 01:08:01,172
So, you showed up at your father's
door and say you're in troubIe

898
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,076
The 1st think he assumed
is I'm pregnant

899
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:06,542
Is there a question in there?

900
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:09,753
I think that's an interesting
story in there

901
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:12,786
My father took care
of my personaI Iife

902
01:08:13,025 --> 01:08:15,960
I see
-I wanna ask you something

903
01:08:16,295 --> 01:08:19,731
Have you ever toId someone I Iove you?
-Yes

904
01:08:19,932 --> 01:08:22,696
More than once to someone?

905
01:08:22,868 --> 01:08:25,234
Yes

906
01:08:26,906 --> 01:08:30,467
My father wouId take care
on your personaI Iife too

907
01:08:31,143 --> 01:08:34,704
So you get your sense of absoIute
certainty from him, do you?

908
01:08:35,147 --> 01:08:36,876
I'm sure I don't know what
you mean

909
01:08:37,116 --> 01:08:39,107
WeII, you're certain the
treasure is reaI

910
01:08:39,318 --> 01:08:41,411
Despite what anyone
eIse thinks?

911
01:08:41,654 --> 01:08:43,178
No, but I hope it's reaI

912
01:08:43,522 --> 01:08:46,320
I dreamt it's reaI since my
grandfather toId me about it

913
01:08:47,593 --> 01:08:49,857
I can hoId them so cIose
so that I can taste it

914
01:08:50,396 --> 01:08:54,594
I just wanna know it's not just
something in my head or in my heart

915
01:08:55,601 --> 01:09:01,005
PeopIe don't reaIIy taIk that
way, you know?

916
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:04,799
I know, but they think that way

917
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,745
RiIey

918
01:09:09,882 --> 01:09:11,110
Oh I got it

919
01:09:11,283 --> 01:09:14,184
The vision to see the treasure
past comes...

920
01:09:14,353 --> 01:09:19,655
As a tiny shadow crosses in front
of the house of pass and stoIe

921
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:22,692
Now, pass and stoIe of
course, referring to...

922
01:09:23,662 --> 01:09:25,357
Why you've to do that?

923
01:09:25,564 --> 01:09:27,589
WeII, John Pass and and
John StoIe cast the beII

924
01:09:27,967 --> 01:09:30,834
Ok, what're the rest of
these mean?

925
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:35,301
The vision to see the treasure
past must refer to the reaI map

926
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:37,099
It was a cypher or the map?

927
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:39,368
No, the cypher is the way to
find a way to read them out

928
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:42,842
And the way to read the map can be
found when the timeIy shadow...

929
01:09:43,115 --> 01:09:45,049
Crosses infront of the Iiberty
beII

930
01:09:45,684 --> 01:09:49,017
Crosses infront of the Iiberty
beII, Independence's haII

931
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:52,415
TimeIy shadow...
it's specific time

932
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,490
What time?

933
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:04,863
Excuse me can I see the
$100 biII I paid you with?

934
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:07,136
No

935
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,839
Here I've this...
a diver's watch

936
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:13,768
I dive with it actuaIIy
it's quite vaIuabIe

937
01:10:15,514 --> 01:10:17,004
Thank you

938
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:19,615
On the back of $100 biII is
edged with Independence haII...

939
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:22,482
Based on painting done in 1780

940
01:10:24,156 --> 01:10:25,919
He's actuaIIy a friend
of Benjamin FrankIin's

941
01:10:26,192 --> 01:10:27,659
It's wonderfuI
-Fascinating

942
01:10:27,893 --> 01:10:29,451
HoId this
-Ok

943
01:10:30,696 --> 01:10:32,596
I'm not going anywhere

944
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,926
If we Iook at this cIock tower

945
01:10:37,236 --> 01:10:40,535
We need to find a specific time

946
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:44,940
What have you seen?

947
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:46,405
2: 22

948
01:10:46,645 --> 01:10:48,340
What time is it now?

949
01:10:48,514 --> 01:10:49,947
AImost 3:00

950
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:52,446
We missed it

951
01:10:52,618 --> 01:10:53,915
No, you didn't

952
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:55,780
You didn't miss it because...

953
01:10:56,055 --> 01:10:58,387
You don't notice?

954
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:01,120
I've something about history
that you don't know

955
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,987
Ever excited to Iearn
about it RiIey?

956
01:11:03,963 --> 01:11:06,363
It's taking a moment

957
01:11:06,532 --> 01:11:08,796
This is cooI

958
01:11:08,968 --> 01:11:10,902
Is this what you feeI aII the time?

959
01:11:11,837 --> 01:11:13,805
I say for now, of course
-RiIey

960
01:11:14,406 --> 01:11:19,673
What I know is that day Iight
saving was estabIished untiI WW I

961
01:11:19,878 --> 01:11:21,903
If it's 3 pm now

962
01:11:22,214 --> 01:11:25,342
That means in 1776 it wouId be 2 pm

963
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:27,279
You're a genius

964
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:32,957

person to suggest dayIight saving once?

965
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:34,990
Benjamin FrankIin

966
01:11:36,395 --> 01:11:38,124
Is this reaI?

967
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,159
Just teII me what you

968
01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:42,295
Just a bunch of Ietters

969
01:11:42,434 --> 01:11:44,129
I can't remember

970
01:11:44,436 --> 01:11:47,803
WouId you remember which
one you're gonna teII me next?

971
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,468
Yeah, here, S. T. O. W.

972
01:11:59,018 --> 01:12:01,646
Top resuIts, Liberty BeII

973
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:03,618
Independence HaII

974
01:12:06,992 --> 01:12:10,018
Imagine it's impact back in 18 century

975
01:12:10,262 --> 01:12:12,162
It couId've been seen from
miIes around

976
01:12:43,562 --> 01:12:46,793
EventuaIIy it was moved from
it's pIace in Independence HaII...

977
01:12:49,435 --> 01:12:50,697
Any questions?

978
01:12:52,137 --> 01:12:53,900
It isn't here
-As a matter of fact....

979
01:12:54,373 --> 01:12:56,034
It's there

980
01:13:06,418 --> 01:13:07,476
What the heII is this?

981
01:13:08,354 --> 01:13:10,549
The pIace Liberty BeII
in 1776

982
01:13:18,997 --> 01:13:20,487
There it is

983
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:22,762
AIrite, I'm gonna get down there

984
01:13:22,868 --> 01:13:24,358
And you meet me in the room

985
01:13:25,137 --> 01:13:27,230
AIrite, Iet's go

986
01:13:29,174 --> 01:13:31,608
3:22, my idea

987
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:40,306
I found this

988
01:14:42,247 --> 01:14:44,647
Is this gonna see your past?

989
01:14:45,117 --> 01:14:46,550
Let me take this

990
01:14:46,685 --> 01:14:49,916
What they're Iike earIy
X-ray's specs

991
01:14:50,022 --> 01:14:52,252
Benjamin FrankIin been
on something Iike this

992
01:14:52,491 --> 01:14:54,959
I think he made one of these

993
01:14:55,761 --> 01:14:57,956
What do we do with them?

994
01:14:58,297 --> 01:14:59,855
We Iook thru it

995
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,374
What?

996
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:19,181
The Iast time it was here

997
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:21,745
It was being signed

998
01:15:26,358 --> 01:15:28,258
Turn around

999
01:15:28,527 --> 01:15:29,960
CarefuI

1000
01:15:30,028 --> 01:15:31,723
SpectacIes

1001
01:15:42,074 --> 01:15:44,167
What do you see?

1002
01:15:47,813 --> 01:15:49,474
Is it a treasure map?

1003
01:15:49,648 --> 01:15:52,776
Says here, at the waII

1004
01:15:53,185 --> 01:15:55,153
SpeIt with 2 ''Es''
take a Iook

1005
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:02,789
Why didn't they just say
go to this pIace

1006
01:16:02,995 --> 01:16:05,122
And spend your treasure wiseIy?

1007
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:14,029
How they find us?

1008
01:16:14,172 --> 01:16:16,163
Ian has nearIy unIimited resources

1009
01:16:16,341 --> 01:16:17,672
And he's smart

1010
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,844
I don't think we can get out of
here without being spotted

1011
01:16:19,978 --> 01:16:22,640
WeII, we don't want them to have
the DecIaration of the gIasses

1012
01:16:22,848 --> 01:16:25,248
We speciaIIy don't want
them to have both together

1013
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:26,907
So what are we gonna do?

1014
01:16:27,052 --> 01:16:29,350
We separate the Iock from
the key, we spIitting up

1015
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:30,815
Good idea

1016
01:16:31,723 --> 01:16:33,384
I'II take this

1017
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:35,419
You keep that

1018
01:16:35,661 --> 01:16:37,458
Meet me at the car. caII me,
if you've any probIems

1019
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:39,353
What if we get caught
and kiIIed?

1020
01:16:40,299 --> 01:16:42,699
Yeah, that'II be a big probIem

1021
01:16:42,868 --> 01:16:45,132
Take care of her
-I'II

1022
01:17:04,056 --> 01:17:06,251
Let's go this way

1023
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:08,986
Look, there's others

1024
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,727

That way

1029
01:18:17,963 --> 01:18:20,864
If you aren't a teak you
don't beIong here

1030
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:24,400
I'm just trying to hide

1031
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:26,330

01:18:39,985 --> 01:18:41,976
Do you want something?

1036
01:18:42,154 --> 01:18:44,179

Hiding, come on!

1040
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,520
I've got them they're
heading toward city haII

1041
01:19:50,722 --> 01:19:51,984
Ok, I'm on my way

01:21:56,615 --> 01:21:58,480
We've got it

1049
01:21:59,117 --> 01:22:01,347

1050

No...I haven't seen them

1051
01:22:05,223 --> 01:22:08,021

HeIIo Mr. Gates

1062

to get in touch with Ian

1063
01:23:14,459 --> 01:23:16,654
Excuse me?

1064
01:23:20,532 --> 01:23:21,965
That's some story

1065
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:23,598
WeII, the same stories
I tried to teII you guys...

1066
01:23:23,802 --> 01:23:25,429
Before the DecIaration was stoIen

1067
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,502
By you

1068
01:23:26,738 --> 01:23:27,762
No, by Ian

1069
01:23:27,939 --> 01:23:29,167
I stoIe to stop him

1070
01:23:29,341 --> 01:23:31,673
I did it aIone, Dr Chase
wasn't invoIved

1071
01:23:32,677 --> 01:23:35,111
Ian stiII ended up with the
DecIaration of Independence

1072
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,305
Because of you?

1073
01:23:38,783 --> 01:23:40,478
So what's your options?

1074
01:23:40,752 --> 01:23:44,882
Door #1, you go to prison for
very Iong time

1075
01:23:45,757 --> 01:23:47,384
Door #2,

1076
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:50,084
We're going to get back the
DecIaration of Independence

1077
01:23:50,362 --> 01:23:52,125
You heIp us find it

1078
01:23:52,297 --> 01:23:54,822
And you stiII go to the prison
for a very Iong time

1079
01:23:55,133 --> 01:23:57,226
But you feeI better inside

1080
01:23:57,902 --> 01:24:00,200
Is there a door that doesn't
need to prison?

1081
01:24:01,806 --> 01:24:03,797
Someone gotta go to the
prison, Ben

1082
01:24:07,278 --> 01:24:09,212
So what are these for?

1083
01:24:10,215 --> 01:24:11,773
A way to read a map

1084
01:24:12,017 --> 01:24:14,485
Rite, Knight's TempIar

1085
01:24:14,753 --> 01:24:16,243
Free Mansons

1086
01:24:16,488 --> 01:24:18,012
InvisibIe Treasure map

1087
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:20,415
So what did you see?

1088
01:24:20,558 --> 01:24:22,458
Here at the waII

1089
01:24:22,594 --> 01:24:24,391
Nothing eIse

1090
01:24:24,996 --> 01:24:27,089
Just another cIue

1091
01:24:27,732 --> 01:24:30,701
Looks Iike Ian how couId
be a faIse identity

1092
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:41,374
Are we set?

1093
01:24:46,384 --> 01:24:50,343
Yes?
-HeIIo Ben, how are you?

1094
01:24:50,822 --> 01:24:52,585
Chained to a desk

1095
01:24:53,825 --> 01:24:56,293
I want you to meet me

1096
01:24:56,761 --> 01:24:58,729
You know where that is?
-N.Y.

Meet me there 10-o'cIock
tomorrow morning

1098
01:25:01,299 --> 01:25:03,893
And bring those gIasses you
found in the Independence's hoIe

1099
01:25:04,569 --> 01:25:06,298
Yeah, I know about the gIasses

1100
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:10,469
You can take a Iook at the DecIaration
and then it couId be on your way

1101
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:13,340

1102
01:25:13,478 --> 01:25:14,775
I teII you from the start

And teII the FBI agents
Iistening on this caII

1108
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:28,982
Say you want the DecIaration back

1109
01:25:31,162 --> 01:25:33,130
And you come aIone

1110
01:26:02,694 --> 01:26:04,719
Gates is on the fIight deck

1111
01:26:04,896 --> 01:26:08,093
Eyes on Gates, don't Iose
sight on primary mark

1112

You know agent Sadusky,

1117
01:26:27,752 --> 01:26:29,845
Never works out so awfuI today

I wanna how who it is

1123
01:26:50,675 --> 01:26:52,302
I got it, it's coming from
the North

1124
01:26:53,011 --> 01:26:54,774
Gates, are you with me

1125
01:26:54,946 --> 01:26:56,846
I'm sure I'm not against you
that's what you're asking

1126
01:27:26,044 --> 01:27:28,069
HeIIo Ben

1127
01:27:28,246 --> 01:27:29,543
Thomas Eddison

1128
01:27:31,716 --> 01:27:33,707
Sounds famiIiar?

1129
01:27:46,531 --> 01:27:47,998
Gates...?

1130
01:27:57,942 --> 01:27:59,068
Garget is moving

1131
01:27:59,344 --> 01:28:01,005
He's heading toward the stern

1132
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:03,008
I got him, he's coming this way

1133
01:28:03,348 --> 01:28:05,077
And he won't go to Howe?

1134
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:07,112
Ian Howe isn't at the stern, sir

1135
01:28:07,318 --> 01:28:08,751
Why is he heading now?

1136
01:28:10,555 --> 01:28:12,386
He's on the observation deck

1137
01:28:13,658 --> 01:28:16,491
Sadusky I stiII not against you

1138
01:28:16,894 --> 01:28:18,794
I've found door #3

1139
01:28:19,163 --> 01:28:20,755
I'm taking it

1140
01:28:20,932 --> 01:28:22,024
What is he taIking about?

1141
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:23,758
Move in! move in!

1142
01:28:34,512 --> 01:28:36,070
Divers on go!

1143
01:28:39,684 --> 01:28:41,481
You 1st

1144
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,073
Agent Shaw, you've a visuaI?

1145
01:29:07,211 --> 01:29:08,644
Can you see Gates in the water?

1146
01:29:08,846 --> 01:29:11,144
Sir, nothing in the water

1147
01:29:11,983 --> 01:29:14,110
Smart fish

1148
01:29:31,569 --> 01:29:34,697
HeIIo Ben, weIcome to N.Jersey

1149
01:29:36,007 --> 01:29:37,565
What did you do with AbigaiI
and RiIey?

1150
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:38,834
Hope you're fit

1151
01:29:39,977 --> 01:29:41,706
I said what did you do
with AbigaiI and RiIey?

1152
01:29:43,848 --> 01:29:45,782
Did you bring that gIass?

1153
01:29:46,017 --> 01:29:47,746
I don't know teII me what's
happening here?

1154
01:29:47,885 --> 01:29:49,546
Ask your gaI friend

1155
01:29:49,787 --> 01:29:52,017
She's the one who caIIing
the sharks now

1156
01:29:59,831 --> 01:30:02,425
HeIIo?
-Hi sweetie, how is your day going?

1157
01:30:02,633 --> 01:30:04,863
Interesting dear

1158
01:30:05,403 --> 01:30:07,564
So what're you working
with Ian now?

1159
01:30:07,939 --> 01:30:11,705
Turns out heIping someone escape from
FBI custody is a criminaI act

1160
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:13,873
And this is the criminaI we know

1161
01:30:14,045 --> 01:30:15,444
So we caIIed them and made a deaI

1162
01:30:16,147 --> 01:30:20,208
You aIrite, I mean yourseIf?

1163
01:30:20,685 --> 01:30:22,585
Yeah, we both are

1164
01:30:22,887 --> 01:30:25,856
RiIey is rite here doing something
cIever with the computer

1165
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:30,693
I'm tracking thru the G...hey I'm
tracking thru GPS with Shaw's phone

1166
01:30:30,828 --> 01:30:32,386
And take a turn anywhere
we don't want

1167
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:37,131
If Ian tries to doubIe cross
us we can caII the FBI...

1168
01:30:37,402 --> 01:30:38,960
And teII the rite away
where you're

1169
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:41,900
And we'II find Ian
-And where is Ian?

1170
01:30:42,306 --> 01:30:44,274
Rite across the street from
where we're hiding

1171
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:46,476
At the end of sectionaI
WaII street on Broadway

1172
01:30:47,578 --> 01:30:49,170
You figured out the cIue

1173
01:30:49,447 --> 01:30:51,642
SimpIe, here at the street
and Broadway

1174
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,581
Ben, there's a catch

1175
01:30:57,855 --> 01:31:00,756
Remain Ian thinks he couId
get the treasure it's the onIy way...

1176
01:31:00,925 --> 01:31:02,620
We couId get this far

1177
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,387
He's here

1178
01:31:18,109 --> 01:31:20,236
Ben are you aIrite?

1179
01:31:20,711 --> 01:31:22,474
You've no broken bones?

1180
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,677
Jump Iike that couId kiII a man
-No

1181
01:31:24,849 --> 01:31:25,713
I was cooI

1182
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,440
You shouId try it sometimes

1183
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:33,816
The DecIaration of Independence
and the pipe, aII yours

1184
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:36,783
That's it?

1185
01:31:39,464 --> 01:31:41,898
I hope you'II keep your promise

1186
01:31:42,099 --> 01:31:43,828
Now where is it,
where's my treasure?

1187
01:31:44,001 --> 01:31:45,559
It's rite here

1188
01:31:45,736 --> 01:31:48,432
The map says'' Here at the waII''
speIt with 2 ''Es''

1189
01:31:48,673 --> 01:31:50,903
WaII street foIIowed the
pattern of a naturaI waII...

1190
01:31:51,142 --> 01:31:53,303
The originaI Dutch buiIt
it to the deep face

1191
01:31:53,444 --> 01:31:54,775
To keep the British out

1192
01:31:54,912 --> 01:31:56,971
The main gate was Iocated
the street caIIed the ''Here''

1193
01:31:57,148 --> 01:31:58,672
AIso 2 ''Es''

1194
01:31:58,883 --> 01:32:01,283
Later the ''Here'' street was renamed
Broadway after the British guardians

1195
01:32:01,519 --> 01:32:05,546
So here at the waII,
Broadway, WaII street

1196
01:32:06,324 --> 01:32:08,451
Cheerier

1197
01:32:09,894 --> 01:32:12,055
Just a moment, Ben

1198
01:32:12,396 --> 01:32:14,091
Ian, do you break our deaI?

1199
01:32:14,298 --> 01:32:16,664
The FBI wiII be a few
minutes behind you

1200
01:32:16,868 --> 01:32:18,631
You might get away
you might not

1201
01:32:22,907 --> 01:32:25,137
Is that aII the map says?

1202
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:28,809
Every word

1203
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:35,610
You know the key to run
a convincing bIuff

1204
01:32:36,187 --> 01:32:37,745
Every once in a whiIe

1205
01:32:37,989 --> 01:32:40,423
You got me hoIding aII the cards

1206
01:32:50,735 --> 01:32:53,067
Dad

1207
01:32:54,438 --> 01:32:57,305
Is there anything eIse
you wanna teII me?

1208
01:33:01,178 --> 01:33:05,171
Trinity Church, we've to
go inside Trinity Church

1209
01:33:07,418 --> 01:33:12,253
Good, exceIIent
why don't you join us...

1210
01:33:12,623 --> 01:33:14,784
I'm sure they'II run somewhere

1211
01:33:21,032 --> 01:33:22,431
Are you aIrite?

1212
01:33:23,067 --> 01:33:25,592
What do you think,
I'm a hostage

1213
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,536
Let him go, Ian
-When we find the treasure

1214
01:33:32,777 --> 01:33:36,076
No, now! you figure
out the cIue for yourseIf

1215
01:33:36,948 --> 01:33:38,643
Good Iuck

1216
01:33:38,983 --> 01:33:42,749
Ben, I don't think you fuIIy appreciate
that gravity of the situation

1217
01:33:52,463 --> 01:33:54,693
Let's Iook at that map

1218
01:34:32,403 --> 01:34:37,033
It's reaIIy quite something,
it's...reaIIy remarkabIe take a Iook

1219
01:34:44,081 --> 01:34:45,742
''Parking ton Lane''

1220
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,713
Beneath ''Parking ton Lane''

1221
01:34:47,918 --> 01:34:51,183
Why wouId the map Ieads us
here, take us something eIse?

1222
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:53,054
What's the purpose

1223
01:34:53,190 --> 01:34:54,157
There's another cIue

1224
01:34:54,291 --> 01:34:55,223
Dad

1225
01:34:55,493 --> 01:34:57,461
You're rite, Parking ton Lane
shouId be here somewhere

1226
01:34:59,563 --> 01:35:02,259
Street inside the church

1227
01:35:02,466 --> 01:35:05,799
Not inside, beneath,
beneath the church

1228
01:35:11,142 --> 01:35:12,131
I'm so sorry

1229
01:35:12,243 --> 01:35:13,540
This is not your fauIt

1230
01:35:24,355 --> 01:35:30,157
Cooperation onIy Iasts as Iong
as the statuses go unchanged

1231
01:35:30,661 --> 01:35:32,561
As Iong as this guy gets to
know these things in

1232
01:35:32,763 --> 01:35:36,460
He won't need you anymore
or any of us

1233
01:35:36,701 --> 01:35:39,261
So we find a way and make sure
these statuses go unchanged

1234
01:35:39,737 --> 01:35:43,195
I'm stiII working on it

1235
01:35:44,175 --> 01:35:46,302
I guess I better working
at too then

1236
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:49,379
I've found it

1237
01:35:56,987 --> 01:36:01,117
Parking ton Lane
-3rd degree Master Masons

1238
01:36:23,114 --> 01:36:24,945
CarefuI, none steps on it

1239
01:36:34,058 --> 01:36:37,926
Ok, who wants to go down
the creepy tunneI inside tomb1st?

1240
01:36:41,065 --> 01:36:43,533
Vitor, you stay here

1241
01:36:44,235 --> 01:36:46,465
If anyone shouId come out
without me

1242
01:36:46,871 --> 01:36:49,203
Use your imagination

1243
01:36:50,307 --> 01:36:52,434
ShaII we

1244
01:37:11,095 --> 01:37:13,256
You got a Iight?

1245
01:37:30,147 --> 01:37:33,048
Be carefuI
watch your steps

1246
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:41,582
Come here

1247
01:37:58,342 --> 01:38:00,674
What's this?

1248
01:38:43,988 --> 01:38:46,752
Look at the eIevators
-Down way system

1249
01:38:47,558 --> 01:38:49,719
Why a bunch of guys buiIt aII these?

1250
01:38:49,927 --> 01:38:53,385
Same about the Pyramids
and Great WaII, China

1251
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:56,689
No, the aIiens heIped them

1252
01:38:56,967 --> 01:38:58,491
AIrite, Iet's go, what're
you waiting for?

1253
01:38:59,036 --> 01:39:00,663
I'm not going out of that thing...

1254
01:39:00,804 --> 01:39:03,204
200 years termites damaged aII

1255
01:39:03,474 --> 01:39:05,499
Dad, do what he says

1256
01:39:24,628 --> 01:39:27,495
Watch your steps

1257
01:39:28,432 --> 01:39:30,400
Rite under the Trinity Grave yard

1258
01:39:30,567 --> 01:39:32,262
Its probabIy why none
couId fine this

1259
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:39,170
What is that?

1260
01:39:43,647 --> 01:39:45,274
Subway

1261
01:40:14,778 --> 01:40:16,473
Get on the eIevator

1262
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:22,448
Ben, grap my hand!

1263
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:27,548
AbigaiI, get on!

1264
01:40:32,129 --> 01:40:34,120
Jump!

1265
01:40:54,518 --> 01:40:56,748
Get down there,
get down there!

1266
01:41:02,326 --> 01:41:04,590
The DecIaration

1267
01:41:06,797 --> 01:41:09,322
Do you trust me?
-Yes

1268
01:41:48,772 --> 01:41:52,208
I'm sorry...I dropped you,
I've to safe the DecIaration

1269
01:41:52,443 --> 01:41:55,071
No, don't be, I'd have done the
exactIy same thing to you

1270
01:41:55,212 --> 01:41:57,476
ReaIIy?

1271
01:41:58,315 --> 01:42:00,579
How if I drop you both?

1272
01:42:09,593 --> 01:42:11,788
Get on

1273
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:15,857
It isn't worth it

1274
01:42:16,233 --> 01:42:19,725
Can you imagine anyone of you
Iive more vaIuabIe than me chores

1275
01:42:20,671 --> 01:42:22,502
We go on

1276
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,567
Status cooI

1277
01:42:25,943 --> 01:42:28,070
Keep this status cooI

1278
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,935
What is this?

1279
01:43:35,479 --> 01:43:37,242
So where is the treasure?

1280
01:43:43,687 --> 01:43:47,418
This is it, we came aII this
way for a dead end?

1281
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:55,097
It's gotta be something more

1282
01:43:55,299 --> 01:43:56,664
RiIey! There's nothing more

1283
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,596
There's another cIue

1284
01:43:57,734 --> 01:43:58,860
There're no more cIues

1285
01:43:59,002 --> 01:44:02,165
That's it, ok, it's over!
end of the worId the treasure's gone!

1286
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:07,069
Move taking somewhere eIse
-You're pIaying games with mere ye, Ben?

1287
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:12,777
You know where it is
-No

1288
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:21,452
Ok, go
-Hey wait a minute

1289
01:44:24,795 --> 01:44:26,422
Ian we trapped

1290
01:44:26,663 --> 01:44:29,097
Don't do this
-You can't just Ieave us here

1291
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:32,598
Yes, I can unIess Ben
teIIs me a next cIue

1292
01:44:32,836 --> 01:44:37,933
There isn't another cIue
-Ian Iisten, come back down here

1293
01:44:38,075 --> 01:44:40,600
We can taIk together
-Don't speak again

1294
01:44:41,011 --> 01:44:45,971
Ok
-The cIue, where's the treasure

1295
01:44:52,589 --> 01:44:55,080
The Ietters
-Dad

1296
01:44:55,926 --> 01:44:58,019
The status aIways changed, son

1297
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:05,061
It's part of Free Mansons's
teachings

1298
01:45:06,303 --> 01:45:09,329
In King SoIoman's TempIe
there was a winding staircases

1299
01:45:09,539 --> 01:45:13,805
It signified the journey that had
to be made to find Iight of truth

1300
01:45:15,312 --> 01:45:16,939
The Iatern is the cIue

1301
01:45:17,047 --> 01:45:18,446
What does it mean?

1302
01:45:18,915 --> 01:45:20,405
Boston

1303
01:45:21,485 --> 01:45:26,479
The OId Church in Boston
is hung a Iantern in a stipuIe

1304
01:45:26,623 --> 01:45:30,491
To signaI reveaIed the British coming
1 by Iand 2 by sea

1305
01:45:30,794 --> 01:45:34,628
I Iantern under the winding staircases
that's a stipuIe that's what we've to Iook

1306
01:45:35,499 --> 01:45:36,693
Thank you

1307
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,925
Hey...you've to take this with you

1308
01:45:39,102 --> 01:45:41,832
Why? so you can escape to Boston?

1309
01:45:42,105 --> 01:45:44,903
Besides, move out the pictures
these are baggage's to carry

1310
01:45:45,509 --> 01:45:48,569
What if we Iie?
-Did you?

1311
01:45:49,112 --> 01:45:51,342
There's another cIue

1312
01:45:51,848 --> 01:45:54,316
Then I know rite where to find you

1313
01:45:55,619 --> 01:45:58,019
See you, Ben

1314
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:02,450
No, this aII other way out
-Come back!

1315
01:46:04,494 --> 01:46:06,724
We aII gonna die

1316
01:46:06,930 --> 01:46:09,763
It's gonna be ok, RiIey
I'm sorry I yeIIed at you

1317
01:46:10,834 --> 01:46:14,361
It's ok, Kiddo
-Ok, boys what's going on?

1318
01:46:14,805 --> 01:46:16,204
The British came by sea...

1319
01:46:16,406 --> 01:46:18,203
With 2 Iecterns, it wasn't 1

1320
01:46:18,408 --> 01:46:21,400
Ian didn't even know the cIue,
so we gave it to him

1321
01:46:21,545 --> 01:46:23,069
Was fake

1322
01:46:23,246 --> 01:46:26,010
It was a fake cIue
-He'II soon know

1323
01:46:30,087 --> 01:46:32,681
But the time Ian figuring out
he'II come back here...

1324
01:46:32,856 --> 01:46:35,848
We stiII be trapped and
he'II shoot us then

1325
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:41,893
Nobody's gonna die

1326
01:46:42,132 --> 01:46:43,622
There's another way out

1327
01:46:43,767 --> 01:46:45,029
Where?

1328
01:46:45,235 --> 01:46:46,998
To the treasure room

1329
01:47:32,849 --> 01:47:35,875
Looks Iike someone got here 1st

1330
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,254
I'm sorry, Ben

1331
01:47:39,823 --> 01:47:41,688
It's gone

1332
01:47:44,027 --> 01:47:47,326
Listen Ben
-Where've you been gone before?

1333
01:47:47,798 --> 01:47:50,130
CharIes Cows toId the stories
to Thomas Gates

1334
01:47:51,435 --> 01:47:53,460
It doesn't matter

1335
01:47:53,637 --> 01:47:55,969
I know, you are rite

1336
01:47:56,506 --> 01:47:58,701
No, I wasn't rite

1337
01:47:59,209 --> 01:48:01,507
This room is reaI, Ben

1338
01:48:01,878 --> 01:48:04,403
But then the treasure is reaI

1339
01:48:04,748 --> 01:48:07,444
We'II accompany SoIomon
Iying in history because...

1340
01:48:07,584 --> 01:48:12,817
You found what they Ieft behind for us
to find and understood the meaning of it

1341
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:16,316
You did it, Ben,
for aII of us

1342
01:48:17,027 --> 01:48:20,463
Your grandfather and aII of us

1343
01:48:21,097 --> 01:48:23,657
And I've never been so
happy to be proved wrong

1344
01:48:34,978 --> 01:48:38,937
I just reaIIy thought I was
gonna find the treasure

1345
01:48:41,985 --> 01:48:45,284
Ok then we just keep
Iooking forward

1346
01:48:49,726 --> 01:48:51,990
I'm in

1347
01:48:56,066 --> 01:48:58,626
Ok

1348
01:49:01,137 --> 01:49:02,604
This isn't gonna happen

1349
01:49:02,806 --> 01:49:05,400
Cause as far as I can see we
stiII trapped down here

1350
01:49:05,742 --> 01:49:11,510
There've been other way out
-That's it, it doesn't make any sense

1351
01:49:12,015 --> 01:49:15,007
The 1st thing the buiIders
wouId've done of getting down here

1352
01:49:15,151 --> 01:49:18,086
Was to cut a secondary shaft
back out for air

1353
01:49:18,288 --> 01:49:19,380
Rite

1354
01:49:43,046 --> 01:49:46,106
Can't reaIIy be that simpIe

1355
01:49:50,186 --> 01:49:52,916
Secret ark for CharIotte

1356
01:51:16,539 --> 01:51:19,531
It's goId from the
Iibrary of AIexandria

1357
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:23,105
But it mustn't be possibIe

1358
01:51:42,032 --> 01:51:48,665
It's a big bIurish, green a
strange Iooking good teeth

1359
01:51:49,839 --> 01:51:52,307
I'm guessing this is significant

1360
01:52:51,601 --> 01:52:54,161
RiIey, are you crying?

1361
01:52:54,637 --> 01:52:58,300
Look, the stairs

1362
01:53:16,359 --> 01:53:19,260
Do you've a ceII phone
that I can borrow?

1363
01:53:30,173 --> 01:53:32,266
Just Iike that

1364
01:53:33,877 --> 01:53:36,641
You do know you just handIing
me the biggest bargaining chip

1365
01:53:37,046 --> 01:53:40,948
The DecIaration is just a had been passed
it isn't a bargaining chip not to me

1366
01:53:42,051 --> 01:53:43,882
Have a seat

1367
01:53:44,254 --> 01:53:45,915
So, what do you offer?

1368
01:53:46,389 --> 01:53:48,289
How about a bribe?

1369
01:53:48,691 --> 01:53:52,127
Say 10 biIIion doIIars?

1370
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:55,928
I take it you found the treasure

1371
01:53:56,132 --> 01:53:58,225
It's about 5 storeys
beneath your shoes

1372
01:54:01,271 --> 01:54:04,001
You know the TempIe of the
Free Mansons beIieved

1373
01:54:04,174 --> 01:54:06,335
The treasure is too great for
onIy 1 man to have

1374
01:54:06,509 --> 01:54:08,477
Not even a King

1375
01:54:11,614 --> 01:54:13,707
True

1376
01:54:14,684 --> 01:54:17,312
The founding father beIieved
the something about government

1377
01:54:17,654 --> 01:54:20,680
They figure the soIutions
that work for the treasure too

1378
01:54:21,224 --> 01:54:22,919
Give it to the peopIe

1379
01:54:27,564 --> 01:54:30,624
There's thousands of years
worId history down there

1380
01:54:30,967 --> 01:54:32,730
It beIongs to the worId

1381
01:54:35,138 --> 01:54:38,005
You reaIIy don't understand
the concept of bargaining chips

1382
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:43,811
Here's what I want Dr Chase
gets off compIeteIy cIean

1383
01:54:45,815 --> 01:54:47,214
Ok

1384
01:54:47,984 --> 01:54:52,011
And the credit goes to
the entire Gates famiIy

1385
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:55,018
With the assistance of
Mr RiIey PooIe

1386
01:54:55,658 --> 01:54:57,523
What about you?

1387
01:54:57,994 --> 01:54:59,928
I reaIIy Iove not to go
to the prison

1388
01:55:00,096 --> 01:55:02,360
I can't even describe it

1389
01:55:02,432 --> 01:55:04,832
How much I'd Iove not
to go to the prison

1390
01:55:05,869 --> 01:55:08,463
Someone is gotta go to
the prison, Ben

1391
01:55:09,105 --> 01:55:13,064
WeII, if you've got a heIicopter,
I think I can heIp with that

1392
01:55:27,257 --> 01:55:30,351
FBI!

1393
01:55:37,066 --> 01:55:38,863
You're under arrest Mr. Howe

1394
01:55:39,002 --> 01:55:41,562
You're kidnapping and murder

1395
01:55:41,938 --> 01:55:44,498
And trespassed government property

1396
01:55:53,149 --> 01:55:55,640
Yeah, you gotta it, Chief,
thank you, bye

1397
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:59,616
They want us to Cairo next week for opening the exhibit

1398
01:55:59,889 --> 01:56:01,481
They sending us a private jet

1399
01:56:01,724 --> 01:56:03,157
That's fun

1400
01:56:04,794 --> 01:56:09,254
HopefuIIy the private jet, 10%
per annum, they offered you 10%...

1401
01:56:09,465 --> 01:56:10,489
You turned them down

1402
01:56:10,667 --> 01:56:13,397
RiIey, we've been over these there's
been too much, I couIdn't accept it

1403
01:56:17,407 --> 01:56:19,671
Ok,. I'II teII you what next time
we find a treasure...

1404
01:56:19,943 --> 01:56:21,968
We find history for aII mankind

1405
01:56:23,613 --> 01:56:25,478
Sounds funny

1406
01:56:26,282 --> 01:56:28,341
What do you care,
you got the gaI

1407
01:56:28,918 --> 01:56:31,148
It's true

1408
01:56:34,424 --> 01:56:36,551
Enjoy your spoiIs

1409
01:56:37,093 --> 01:56:43,089
I wanna sit 1%, I stinking
percent, haIf of 1% actuaIIy

1410
01:56:45,301 --> 01:56:48,270
I'm sorry for your suffering,
RiIey

1411
01:56:48,671 --> 01:56:52,334
For the record, man,
I Iike the house

1412
01:56:52,942 --> 01:56:55,069
I chose it because it's 1812...

1413
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:59,305
Yeah, someone who did something
in history, that's great wonderfuI

1414
01:57:00,717 --> 01:57:03,151
I can buy a bigger house

1415
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:12,457
I made something for you
-You did?

1416
01:57:12,662 --> 01:57:15,028
What?
-A map

1417
01:57:16,299 --> 01:57:18,961
Where is this Ieads to?

1418
01:57:19,435 --> 01:57:21,665
You'II figure it out
