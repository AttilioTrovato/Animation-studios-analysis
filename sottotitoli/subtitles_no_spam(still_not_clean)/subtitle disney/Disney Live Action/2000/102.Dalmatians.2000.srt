72
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,479
My client is not a laboratory
animal, Dr. Pavlov.

73
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,715
Your client wants out of prison, Mr.
Torte,

74
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,319
and with my behavior
control therapy,

75
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,355
freedom is…

76
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,324
Mmm!

77
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,505
I have patented
a humane cocktail…

78
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,074
Of electric shock treatment,

79
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,581
Aversion therapy, hypnosis,

80
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,384
drugs…

81
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,753
And plenty of green vegetables.

82
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:48,195
But, of course, the
real challenge remains.

83
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,433
I mean, this is a
prison, not a pet shop.

84
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,569
And I don't
represent animals in court.

85
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:59,172
Dr. Pavlov, my client…
is cured.

86
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,186
Oooh!

87
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,624
Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

88
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:20,561
Brush up your Swedish,
Dr. Pavlov.

89
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,398
This could be your nobel prize!

90
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,334
Cruella De Vil.

91
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,336
Do call me Ella.

92
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,738
Cruella sounds so…
Cruel.

93
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:35,676
Ms. De vil, I am releasing you into
the custody of the probation office.

94
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:39,447
You will perform 500 hours
of community service.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,684
Mr. Torte, your client is,
I believe, a wealthy woman.

96
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:47,120
After my exorbitant fees,
milord,

97
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:51,158
her assets stand
at a mere â£8 million.

98
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:55,763
Then you will be bound over to keep
the peace to the sum of â£8 million.

99
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,699
If forfeited,
the money will be donated…

100
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,802
To the dogs' homes
of the borough of westminster.

101
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,171
Which means,
if you repeat the offense,

102
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,174
your entire fortune
will go to the dogs.

103
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,657
Alonzo.

104
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,694
My ever-loyal valet.

105
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,497
My only visitor,

106
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,867
stuttering sweetly on the far, far
side of the bulletproof glass.

107
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:40,508
Oh, miss De vil, I've
w-waited for this d-day.

108
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,177
I hope it's not too presumptuous,
but I've brought you a g-g-gift.

109
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,515
Oh, Alonzo, how considerate.

110
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,855
Oh!

111
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,226
Oh!

112
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,597
I think I'll call him fluffy.

113
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,902
Oh, he's smiling at me.

114
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,440
Oh, what a sweet voice.

115
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,510
Wrong side, Alonzo.

116
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:20,280
Come, fluffy.
Mummy will drive.

117
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,759
I told you
you wouldn't believe the truth.

118
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,496
The dog ate your pay stubs.

119
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,767
Ewan, can't you do
a little better than that?

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,437
I was abducted by aliens.

121
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:47,374
- Put me out at piccadilly, they did.
- It was a…

122
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,844
How can you work here? I can't
even keep me own story straight.

123
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,222
Listen.
I won't say it again.

124
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,658
No pay stub, no probation.

125
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:10,230
Dog shelter suits me.

126
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,233
I-I think I found meself.
Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,303
Here's a snap of me
with the dogs.

128
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:20,340
Uh, that's the boss.
He's a top bloke.

129
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,309
You'd love him.

130
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,479
Ah. Told ya.

131
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,515
Drooler got ahold of it.

132
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,986
Ewan,
this is an I.O.U.

133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,989
- Well, we're a bit tight on funds at the moment.
- Chloe, this is…

134
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,992
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

135
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,361
Ewan was just off.

136
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,665
All right.
Thanks, miss.

137
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,435
Uh, next week, then?

138
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,304
Yes. With pay stubs.
Am I being clear?

139
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,340
Uh, supremely.

140
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,342
Keep the photo.

141
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,012
You do put the
fear of god into them, Chloe.

142
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,515
Which is why I've chosen
you to…

143
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,851
Is it… line three!

144
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,853
Hello?

145
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,855
Is it… yes! Stay there!

146
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,725
Keep breathing, and I'll be
there in a second.

147
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,628
Oh! Ah.

148
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,898
Oh! Goodness.

149
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,368
Hurry!

150
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,737
See you soon!
Chloe! Chloe!

151
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,739
You forgot this.

152
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,875
W-what… ah.

153
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,851
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Are you two at it again?

154
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,854
Kevin, how many times
have I had to tell you…

155
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,592
It's pointless for you humans to
play tug-of-war against us dogs.

156
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:51,398
Come on, drooler!
Hit him with both barrels!

157
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,902
Yes! You got it!

158
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:59,372
He's ours! He's down!
He's… he's getting up!

159
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:03,877
Well, I always say, if you
can't stand the heat, cheat!

160
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,615
Hurry, boys!
Get in there!

161
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,383
We dogs need to stick together.

162
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,856
All right, chomp,
sock it to him!

163
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,961
Can you dig it, digger?

164
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,004
Let's get ready to tumble!

165
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:37,477
Hey! Hey!
That's not fair!

166
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,480
Yes, it is! All's
fair in tug-of-war!

167
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,951
I took you misfits in out of the goodness
of my heart, and this is how you repay me?

168
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,857
That's pathetic, kev. How many
times you gonna fall for that one?

169
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,929
I managed to get another week out
of my probation officer, boss.

170
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,833
Think she quite fancies me.

171
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,004
Come on, boys.
It's grub time.

172
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,482
Where'd you get that dog food?

173
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,084
Didn't pinch it, did you?

174
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,120
No. I'm done
with all that.

175
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,993
There you go.

176
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,028
Fill your belly.
Come on.

177
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,031
Good girl.

178
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,535
Okay, who's next?

179
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,178
Hey.

180
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,548
Fill 'er up, kev.
I'm a very hungry dog.

181
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,019
Oh, thank you.

182
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,654
Hey! Hey, wait!
Come back with my grub!

183
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,157
Come on, waddlesworth.
Today's the day.

184
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,829
Fly up to your house, and then I'll
feed you. Come on, waddlesworth, fly!

185
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:06,199
No, I've told you once, I've told you
a hundred times: We dogs can't fly!

186
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,069
See? Now stand
aside, birdbrain.

187
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:14,808
Save some for tomorrow. I don't know
where our next meal's coming from.

188
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:19,713
Me mum always said, "when the heart
hopes, hope comes knocking."

189
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,681
"'Eart 'opes"?

190
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,920
Hope comes knocking.

191
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,896
What? Evicted?
But you said…

192
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,199
you shouldn't believe what people say.
I don't.

193
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,235
You can't turn all these
dogs loose in the city.

194
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,773
Give us another chance. I'm not
the one running a charity here.

195
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,675
- Maybe you can get
away with this…

196
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,219
You and your mangy pack
are out of here tomorrow!

197
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,222
You'd better not leave
any of this junk about!

198
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,225
Next time I'll bite
your bum, you smelly little git.

199
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:15,268
Don't worry.
Everything'll be all right.

200
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,814
Oh, Dottie, they're
absolutely beautiful.

201
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,849
Aren't they, dipstick?

202
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,262
You must be very proud.

203
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,549
You are an odd one, aren't you?

204
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,019
There you go.

205
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,824
Now you should get some rest.

206
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,860
Come on, dipstick.

207
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,056
It's smaller than I remember.

208
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,159
I k-kept everything
just as you l-left it.

209
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,728
Oh, come, fluffy.

210
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,730
We'll share a bath.

211
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,366
An interminable soak…

212
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,302
Scented with lavender…

213
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,305
And a drop of sumatran…

214
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,640
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

215
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,711
Never mind.

216
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,747
I think I'll enjoy
doing a little dusting.

217
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,151
Oh, fluffy, a bath,

218
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,186
Followed by a nap…

219
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,389
Submerged in feather pillows and satin…

220
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,393
Alonzo!

221
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:23,696
Fur! It's everywhere!

222
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,400
Lock them away! Bury them
beyond sight and memory!

223
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:31,138
- Even the Mongolian pony skin trousers and the…
- Now!

224
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,066
And this!

225
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,985
Is it safe?

226
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,925
Yes, it's s-safe.

227
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,797
I do not believe it.

228
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,800
How could they release
that… that…

229
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,972
I pity the poor probation
officer that has to look af…

230
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,940
oh, no.

231
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,842
No, it's not possible.

232
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,846
Oh!

233
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,254
Well, I refuse.

234
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,023
I'm not doing it.

235
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,393
What?

236
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,867
You remember her, don't you?

237
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,504
You remember what she
almost did to you.

238
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,075
Dipstick.

239
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,782
Okay.

240
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,118
I'll do it for you.

241
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,087
And for the family.

242
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,404
Miss De vil.
Yes?

243
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,907
You're five minutes late.
It's a good start.

244
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,145
Well, perhaps your clock's fast.

245
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,547
I'm your probation officer,
Chloe Simon.

246
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,549
Yes, of course you are.

247
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,052
And we're going to be
such friends.

248
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,054
Mmm. Friends.

249
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:04,057
You are going to help me be a useful
member of society, aren't you?

250
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:07,427
Find me
a little niche somewhere?

251
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,430
Could you manage something
with puppy dogs?

252
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,400
I see you as a coal miner,

253
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,368
or something
in the sewers, perhaps.

254
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,104
Ah, I see.

255
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,372
Oh!
You have doggies?

256
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,375
Yes, and I don't want you
looking at them.

257
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,244
I'm sorry. I…

258
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:28,248
listen, can we just be
sensible about this?

259
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,017
Yes! Let's.

260
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,120
Well, must dash.

261
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,955
Bye.

262
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,430
This is your last chance,
Mr. Button.

263
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,433
When the press sees what you're
doing to these poor dogs,

264
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,468
you'll be the most
hated man in London.

265
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,537
I don't see any press,

266
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,540
but I can guarantee
the bailiff is on his way.

267
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,109
Right!
That's it, Mr. Buttocks!

268
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,977
That one's vicious, he is!

269
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,012
They're here!

270
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,419
Everyone on your best behavior.
Pick up your signs.

271
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,957
Come on.

272
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,226
Here! Here we are outside
the second chance…

273
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,462
you're just in time. Excuse me.
I'm trying to…

274
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,965
no, the dogs are over here. These
rescued dogs are being evicted…

275
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,967
just one moment!
This man has no right…

276
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,935
here she comes!
Who she comes?

277
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:34,647
- Cruella De Vil?
- Cruella! Cruella!

278
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,516
Cruella!
Cruella!

279
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,985
Please!
Call me Ella.

280
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,454
Ella! Ella!

281
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,590
Well.

282
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,593
This place and I
were made for each other.

283
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,995
Is it yours?
No, it's mine.

284
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,930
And he… Alonzo.

285
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,932
Buy the dump.

286
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,369
And give him a little extra
for a tie.

287
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,372
So, could you tell us how Cruella
De Vil became plain Ella?

288
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:03,643
Well, I certainly can. It was all
thanks to Dr. Pavlov and his therapy.

289
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,213
Do you really think
that you, a convicted dognapper,

290
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,648
are the right person
to run this establishment?

291
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,318
Second chance
dog shelter says it all.

292
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:15,288
And I think I deserve a
second chance too. Don't you?

293
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,257
No, I do not.

294
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,327
She tricked me!

295
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:27,300
It's
the red baron, king of the sky!

296
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,569
Stop playing
and give me a hand here.

297
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,206
Look. Another volunteer.

298
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,376
See, Ewan? There are
good-hearted people everywhere.

299
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,215
Beautiful good-hearted people.

300
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,217
That's my probation officer!

301
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,919
What, that's
your probation officer?

302
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,425
- Are you Kevin Shepherd?
- Yes. Yes, I'm Kevin…

303
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,727
and you call yourself
a dog lover?

304
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,096
Well, yes, I do. I am.
He does. He is.

305
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,031
I'll get to you, Ewan.

306
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,068
I'm Chloe Simon.

307
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,036
Cruella De Vil's
probation officer.

308
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,739
Oh!
She's in the back.

309
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,544
Is there some problem?
I mean, uh…

310
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,513
excuse us, chomp.

311
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,549
I mean, miss De vil, she seems
devoted to…

312
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,551
Nice bird!

313
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,120
You are a nice bird.
I'm not a bird.

314
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,556
He means you.
Where are your manners?

315
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,559
Buried in the yard with my bone.
This is…

316
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,262
um… Chloe. Chloe Simon.

317
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,264
Chloe, meet waddlesworth.

318
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,266
He's a rottweiler.
Hello.

319
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,436
That's funny, because he looks
like a macaw.

320
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,705
Trust me.
He's a rottweiler.

321
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:43,142
I don't think I trust anyone who knowingly
puts Cruella anywhere near dogs.

322
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,578
Well, yes, but she's changed.

323
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,716
- People like Cruella don't change.
- Of course they do.

324
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,586
That's why I started second chance. I
knew what it was like to need one.

325
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,423
And the same goes
for dogs. Eh?

326
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,428
Take chomp here, for example.

327
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,264
He chewed through three postmen before I
rescued him. Now he wouldn't hurt a flea.

328
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:09,669
And digger, he was banned from every
park in London as a menace to roses.

329
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,671
And drooler…

330
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,142
well, drooler hasn't
really changed much.

331
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,547
- Those are dogs.
- Oh, but dogs are people too.

332
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,050
- But Cruella is…
- changed.

333
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,362
Who's washing who, Alonzo?

334
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,199
Now, hair must be a statement,

335
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,269
a reflection of our inner life.

336
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,271
Color is important, of course,

337
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,740
but texture is vital.

338
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,679
Voila!

339
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:55,181
Oh, darling, darling.

340
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,183
It's you.

341
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,186
Do you like it? I'll be
keeping my eye on her.

342
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,555
I hope so.

And now BBC 2
is proud to present…

372
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,546
The third part in our series,
What makes Big Ben tick?

373
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,665
Turn down the television, quick!

374
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:01,808
What a unique sound pattern.

375
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,810
Very loud.

376
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,845
That would be Ben on the telly.

377
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,315
Yes.

378
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,619
It must have jolted their
brain waves back into…

379
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,489
this mustn't get out.

380
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,992
Do you hear me?
It never happened.

381
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,837
What are you doing?

382
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,339
You're… yes.

383
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,510
And this is domino.

384
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:40,947
Little Dipper's easy because his
tail is exactly like his daddy's.

385
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,550
And I know oddball
because she doesn't have any…

386
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,718
shh!

387
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:49,689
I don't want her to be sensitive
about her lack of, um,

388
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,724
s-p-o-t-s.

389
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:54,460
Oh. Is that normal
at her age?

390
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,396
Well, like everything else
about her,

391
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,700
it is a bit…

392
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,501
Odd.

393
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:10,042
Hello? Is that you, Nigel?

394
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,745
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

395
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,548
Will you take them up to
your office for a while?

396
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,585
'Cause I just keep
staring at them,

397
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,588
and I'm falling dreadfully behind
with my paperwork, as you can see.

398
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,590
Yes, I can see.

399
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:27,026
It's probably just as well
with miss De vil coming in.

400
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,361
- Cruella?
- Y-yes.

401
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,530
She asked to change her appointment.
I thought you knew.

402
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,734
Come on, oddball,
little Dipper, dipstick.

403
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,969
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

404
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,740
Cruella De Vil, that wretched…

405
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,576
philanthropist? Cruella,
I didn't realize…

406
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,345
oh, please, please call me Ella.

407
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,448
Now, Chloe, you can't stop me.

408
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,719
It's my duty to demonstrate
against a fur fashion show.

409
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,722
And it's my duty to inform you
that if you go anywhere near fur,

410
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,757
I'll put you
straight back in prison.

411
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,926
Won't you even let me heckle
that monstrous LePelt?

412
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,630
- No.
- Just a teensy-weensy heckle?

413
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:06,633
You know… murderer!

414
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,472
Round two!

415
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,745
Knockout!

416
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,815
Body blow! Body blow!

417
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,084
Bonus fall.

418
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,620
Round three!

419
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,066
I have so much to atone for.

420
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:56,508
I'm seeing spots.

421
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,220
Dr. Pavlov!

422
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,891
Oddball!

423
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,897
Grab my legs! Grab my legs!
What… oh!

424
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,235
Oddball! Aah!

425
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,607
Aaah!

426
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,747
Ohh!

427
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,616
How did you get out?

428
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:44,957
Are these your lovely dogs?

429
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:48,560
Yes. Are you all right?
Dipstick, shh, please!

430
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:55,935
I remember you…
As a puppy.

431
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,770
Aah!

432
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,077
Why don't I come back later.

433
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,079
I'm feeling a little…

434
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,981
Chilly.

435
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:32,571
Aaah!

436
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,606
Aah! Aah!

437
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,817
Aaah!

438
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,620
Aaah!

439
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:04,971
Um, wouldn't you be more
c-comfortable in the c-car?

440
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:08,207
Aaah!

441
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,009
Ella?

442
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,845
Not Ella.
Ella's gone.

443
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,681
And Cruella's back!

444
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,996
Pull! Pull!

445
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:33,199
Stand aside, worm.

446
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,367
Aaah!

447
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:51,383
Oh, mummy's home, and I'll
never leave you again!

448
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:54,086
Oh, yes!
Oh, hello!

449
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,222
Oh, yes!

450
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,932
Oh!
Why do I feel incomplete?

451
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,367
What could be missing
from my life?

452
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,369
Cruella De Vil, who has it all!

453
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,739
The softest, the rarest,
the whitest, the blackest,

454
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:16,842
the stripiest,
the sportiest, the…

455
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,111
- hmm?
- Of course.

456
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,082
Where is it?
Where?

457
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,118
Where is it?
Oh, there it is.

458
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:31,390
My dalmatian puppy coat.

459
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,792
The coat of dreams.

460
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,861
The ultimate fur coat…

461
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,931
That was denied me
by that canine cabal…

462
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:42,101
For which I have lost
three years of my life!

463
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,136
Alonzo!

464
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,974
- We are going to make them pay.
- Oh, yes! How much?

465
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:52,244
Dipstick, she called him.

466
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,246
Ah, what fiendish justice.

467
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,250
He escaped me, but I shall wreak my
vengeance on the next generation.

468
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,953
S-sounds w-wonderful.

469
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:02,955
Alonzo, I need you.

470
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,957
I'm yours.

471
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:06,959
Furnish yourself with a torch,

472
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,961
a large sack
and rubber-soled shoes.

473
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,963
Meanwhile, I need a furrier.

474
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:13,165
And I know
just where to find him.

- You're nicked!

499
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,211
No! No!

500
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,880
Monsieur LePelt! Monsieur LePelt!
Get out!

501
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:38,016
Animals!
They are all animals!

502
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,886
They have no class! Ooh!
But, monsieur…

503
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,925

No… no…

Not here!

506
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,405
Forgive me.

507
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:02,574
My idiots didn't recognize you.

508
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,011
Only two minions to abuse?

509
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,382
Oh, Jean-Pierre,
the world is so unfair.

510
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,854
Get out! You are unfit to look
upon this goddess of fashion!

511
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,257
Out! Out!

512
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:22,394
Cruella De Vil,

513
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:26,598
my idol, my inspiration,
at my show.

514
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,939
I am so sorry
for the demonstrators.

515
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:37,109
Demonstrators?
I thought they were critics.

516
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,148
Go away!

517
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,252
Jean-Pierre,

518
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:50,889
you've come such a long way
from poaching weasels.

519
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,991
And you, out of prison at last.

520
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,496
Yes.
Terrible experience, prison.

521
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,901
Who are you, little man? And what
are you doing in my trailer?

522
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,904
You shouldn't have brought them
in here, you idiot! But I…

523
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,639
he's with you!
Aah!

524
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:14,280
What is this?
Your salvation, Jean-Pierre.

525
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,149
Monsieur LePelt
has clearly run out of ideas.

526
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:21,153
I propose…

527
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,489
An alliance…

528
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,524
Mmm?
Between monsieur LePelt…

529
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,160
And the house of De vil.

530
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:32,130
You have an idea in the bag?
Oh, Jean-Pierre.

531
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:36,001
Together,
you and I will make a coat…

532
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:39,438
So soft, so luxurious,
so practical in any weather,

533
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:43,442
so bad that we'll rip the veils
off the eyes of fashion…

534
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,545
And write our names
in the pantheon of stars.

535
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:50,316
Of course.
From "poopies."

536
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,553
Ah, not just any "poopies."

537
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,925
"Poopies" with…

538
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,699
Spots.

539
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,073
Hey, wait for me!

540
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,678
Enjoy the show.

541
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,482
One adult, three dogs
and one bird, please.

542
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,584
Oy, I'm a dog, mate.
Four dogs.

543
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,220
Four dogs.
Well, look who's here.

544
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:30,222
Blimey!
I'm seein' spots!

545
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:32,224
Hello, Kevin.

546
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:35,227
Chloe! Are you,
uh… yeah, I'm going.

547
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:38,230
- And are these your dalmatians?
- Yeah.

548
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:41,199
This is digger, chomp and drooler.

549
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,169
You call that a bark?

550
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,705
This is a bark.

551
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,708
That's right.
Go hide behind mummy.

552
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:54,380
And… oddball.
He's not gonna hurt you.

553
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,948
Your change, sir.
Oh. Thank you.

554
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:02,421
- Don't you count your change?
- Well, why should I?

555
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,559
Now it all makes sense.

556
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,561
What?

557
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:12,631
How you could actually believe
that Cruella De Vil had changed.

558
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,600
She h changed.

559
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,469
Shh! The show's gonna start.

560
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:19,571
Let's just enjoy the show.

561
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:22,274
Let's.

562
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:26,412
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello, Mr. Punch!

563
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,280
Hello, everybody!

564
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,815
Hello, Judy!

565
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:33,319
Give us a kiss. Aaah!
Everybody would laugh at us!

566
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:35,721
- Wouldn't you, everyone?
- No!

567
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,290
All right, one kiss.
Ready? Eeeek!

568
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:41,092
Oh, you are awful!

569
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,462
There's a dog around here today.
Ohh!

570
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:47,466
- If you see a dog, will you tell us, please?
- Yes!

571
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,068
- I won't be long then. Bye-bye!
- Bye!

572
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,638
I don't see any dog. Where is it?

573
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,274
Oh, dear.

574
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,243
What is it?

575
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,278
Oddball's obsessed with…

576
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,315
S-p-o-t-s.

577
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,484
- Spots?
- Shh!

578
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,519
What? What'd I do?
I just said "spots."

579
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,621
Help! Help!
Help! Help! Oh!

580
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,758
Oh, no!

581
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,194
Help, help!
Help! Help!

582
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,296
Ohh!

583
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,500
Oddball!

584
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:30,141
Oddball, no!

585
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,313
Follow that dog!

586
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,353
Ooh! Oh!
What's that?

587
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,455
Oy!
They've got balloons!

588
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,857
Oddball! Stop!
Get 'em back here!

589
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:49,227
Where is that dog?
Hold on! We're coming!

590
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,301
Waddlesworth.
Oddball!

591
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,538
Now's your chance. You fly up
there and just cut a few strings.

592
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,408
- Not all of them!
- Right, just a few! Come on, waddlesworth!

593
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:05,411
You can do it! Fly! No! Owww!

594
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,814
Let go of my paw, you twit! I
told you I couldn't fly! Ohh!

595
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,383
Honestly!
Don't worry. I'll go.

596
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:17,389
Hey, hey, what you doing?
Hey, get off… oww!

597
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,774
Got her.

598
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,582
Oddball.

599
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,383
Oh.

600
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,353
Oh, Kevin, I don't know
how to thank you. Oops.

601
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,888
Uh, how about dinner?

602
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,625
Sorry?

603
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,762
I was inviting you to dinner.

604
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,167
Dinner would be nice.

605
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,742
A coat
to make the world "shuvver."

606
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,445
"Shudder."
"shutter"?

607
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,213
Shudder?
Sh…

608
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,215
shiver?
Exactement.

609
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,884
Genius!

610
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,452
Yes, but…

611
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:22,588
I need…

612
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:25,757
A special something…

613
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,495
For three special puppies.

614
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,433
Too dressy?

615
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,435
Too dressy.

616
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:41,306
Too stuffy.
Too small. Too blue.

617
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,342
Dottie, I've got nothing to wear.
Please help me.

618
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,313
What's that?

619
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:51,316
Dottie, are you sure?

620
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,952
It's completely
see-through. Look.

621
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,622
Oddball.
Yeah, that's a sweater.

622
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,990
But…

623
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,992
what a fantastic idea!

624
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:02,994
Thank you!

625
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,996
Thanks, oddball.

626
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,633
My brilliance astounds me.

627
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,668
No. No.

628
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,671
We should add the "poopies" to the hem.
Oh, you wouldn't dare.

629
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,673
But this is last year's length!

630
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,543
If Cruella De Vil draws it,
it defies length.

631
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,847
No. No!

632
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,349
No…

633
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:29,354
What?

634
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,723
Forty dalmatian puppies…

635
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:34,526
Sh-shipped off to Paris…

636
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,361
To h-his shop.

637
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:39,565
Not enough.
We need 102.

638
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:43,034
This time I want
a hooded spotted puppy coat.

639
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:46,638
- Hooded spotted p-puppy coat?
- "Hooded spotted poopie coat?"

640
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,040
But 99 puppies
would make a lovely coat.

641
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:53,044
- It's not that easy to steal…
- Steal? Who said anything about steal?

642
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:56,514
What did you think, LePelt, that
we'd have time to breed them?

643
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:58,516
Skinning is one thing,

644
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,518
but stealing…

645
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,320
oh, stop whining.

646
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,055
I have a perfectly good idiot…

647
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,558
To take the fall.

648
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:08,660
Not you, Alonzo.
Another idiot.

649
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:14,332
On, dasher, on,
dancer, on, digger, on, drooler!

650
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:19,404
Look at me! I'm Rudolph, the red-nosed
rein-dog with a present for miss oddball.

651
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,406
Hello?

652
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,775
I'll be right out, Kevin.

653
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:25,777
Take your time.

654
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,416
Oh, right.

655
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:34,552
Chomp's brought his favorite video.
Is that all right?

656
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:37,422
Is it suitable for the children?

657
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,457
Yes, it's absolutely fine.

658
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:45,463
Is everything all right?

659
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,899
Yes. Beautiful.

660
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:55,774
Um, waddlesworth, he's brought
a present for oddball.

661
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:59,611
Yeah, about time. This thing was
gettin' heavy. Hang on, pup.

662
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:02,781
Keep your spots on…
sorry. You don't have any.

663
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:06,517
Here you go. There.

664
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,789
Come on, show us.

665
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,926
Mr. Puppeteer and I
came to an agreement.

666
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,964
Oh, Kevin, thank you.
It's brilliant.

667
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,634
Come here, you.

668
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,142
Well, I think it's a success.

669
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,144
Looking good, girl!

670
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:36,748
Looking… oh, no!
Oddball's got no underwear!

671
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:40,351
Look away, children!
Turn a blind eye!

672
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:53,965
Excuse me, young lady.
Is this spot taken?

673
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:06,544
I can see we're not needed.

674
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:11,182
As soon as the video's over,
straight to bed for the children.

675
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,184
No more telly.

676
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:16,054
Bye.
Be good.

677
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,692
Anybody wanna order takeout?

678
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:24,830
So, where was I?
Oh, yes.

679
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,832
I started the shelter,

680
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:30,201
and we were going down for the third
time when Cruella stepped in.

681
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:32,738
Her again.
Yes.

682
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:36,207
But did you know that if she
ever goes back to dognapping,

683
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:40,211
all her millions will go straight into the
dogs' homes of the borough of westminster?

684
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:43,081
Yes, I did.
It's in her file.

685
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,684
Thank you.
Thank you.

686
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,687
How did you know that?
She told me.

687
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,656
And did you know…

688
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,993
That second chance is the only
dog shelter in the borough?

689
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,562
You're joking.
Mmm!

690
00:44:57,595 --> 00:45:00,231
Can you imagine what drooler
would do with â£8 million?

691
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,835
Now, tell-a me,
what's-a you pleasure?

692
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:06,604
A la carte?
Dinner?

693
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,609
Aha. Okay.
Hey, Joe!

694
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:16,581
Butch, he says he wants
two spaghetti speciale,

695
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,216
heavy on the meats-a-ball.

696
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:21,186
Tony, dogs-a don't-a talk!

697
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:25,556
He's-a talk-a to me! Okay, he's-a
talk-a to you. You the boss.

698
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,459
Mama Mia.

699
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,229
Now here you are.

700
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:34,132
The best-a spaghetti in-a town.

Darn it.

725
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:01,112
I, uh, had a great time.

726
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,882
So… so did I.

727
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:11,789
Oh, kiss her, for heaven's
sake, while we're still young.

728

00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:23,068
do you believe in second dates?

732
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,338
I do, a-actually.

733
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,442
Good.

734
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,244
Great.

735
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,314
Good night.

736
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:45,123
Well, at least
he's good-looking.

737
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,802

Sweet and solid,

746
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,496
funny without meaning to be.

747
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,272
Hello? There
are "poopies."

748
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,275
"Poopies"? At second
chance "poop" shelter.

749
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,377
What? Poor little
dalmatian "poopies."

750
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,979
Dalmatians? Oui. Second
chance "poopie" shelter.

751
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,349
- Hello? Who is this?
- Hello?

752
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:46,384
Hello? Hello?

753
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:51,389
"Poopies"?
Oui! "Poopies"!

754
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:54,125
Oh, puppies. Mm-hmm. Oui. Voila.

755
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,229
You will find them by the river
at the foot of the bridge.

756
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:01,866
We'll pick them up right away, monsieur.
Bye.

757
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:05,836
Box of abandoned puppies
just around the corner.

758
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,206
Abandoned no more.

759
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,539
Oh, blimey!
The coppers!

760
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,243
Forensics
is on its way. Over.

761
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:47,912
Don't panic, Kevin.
Let me handle this.

762
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,416
Kevin Shepherd?
Yes, hello, guv.

763
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,418
I'm Kevin Shepherd.
Waddlesworth!

764
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:56,053
Sorry. How can I
help you, officer?

765
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,590
A warrant
to search the premises.

766
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:14,205
You have expensive taste, sir.

767
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,208
Don't admit to anything.
What's all this about?

768
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:21,246
Sixteen dalmatian puppies were
reported stolen last night.

769
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,948
Sir.

770
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:25,983
You'll never guess.

771
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,956
Oh, no!

772
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,458
Busted!

773
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,914
Oh, miss De vil.

774
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,016
Ooh, I suppose I must.

775
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,118
Disgusting creature!

776
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,193
Oh! Ohh!

777
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:11,128
Chloe, that helmet. I'd
rather have my skull crushed.

778
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:14,031
Cruella De Vil, you're under arrest.

779
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,668
- Kevin Shepherd, you're under arrest.
- Kevin!

780
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:20,605
Chloe.
Hello, miss Simon.

781
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,941
Is he one of your charges?
No, he's not the one.

782
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,944
She is! Why suspect Kevin?
Caught him red-handed.

783
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,014
And he's got a record
for dognapping.

784
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:33,050
- Mmm.
- I can explain.

785
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,954
- You can explain where you were last night.
- He was home kissing her. Oh!

786
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,524
I was out. Out?

787
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:42,193
- Out.
- I think we've established he was out.

788
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:46,431
- Right, let's discuss this at the station.
- He was out… with me.

789
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,402
Found this, sir…
list of addresses.

790
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:54,071
All the houses that have
had dalmatians stolen.

791
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:59,076
Chloe, you can't possibly
believe… this is crazy!

792
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,313
I'm being set up. Here's the box
of puppies you asked us to…

793
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,549
whatever it is, I didn't do it.
No.

794
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:09,086
I sent Ewan to pick up those.
There was a phone call and…

795
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,223
oops.

796
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:15,393
This is crazy. Why would
I steal dalmatians?

797
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:18,496
Hmm? What possible motive
could I have to want to…

798
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:22,066
- the judge's order.
- What?

799
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:24,402
Oh, Kevin, how could you?

800
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:27,372
- All this for money?
- What?

801
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:30,207
Just like you said
at the restaurant.

802
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:34,512
Would somebody kindly
acquaint me with the facts?

803
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:39,617
If I'm caught stealing puppies,
my entire fortune goes to him.

804
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,619
Would that be a motive?

805
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:51,095
I'm innocent, I tell you!
Innocent!

806
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:53,431
Couldn't tear them apart, sir.
Ah, never mind.

807
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:57,067
Just goes to show,
a dog will love anyone.

808
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:01,272
Inspector Armstrong!
Oh, inspector, thank you.

809
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:03,708
You and your men
do such a wonderful job…

810
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,277
Protecting the weak
and the innocent.

811
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:09,280
Oh, thank you very much. And
I must say, miss De vil,

812
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:13,050
you are the most remarkable case of rehabilitation
I've known in all my years on the force.

813
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,486
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

814
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,122
Good-bye.

815
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,510
Don't be hard on yourself, dear.

816
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:42,347
We were both fooled.

817
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,615
I'm sorry, miss De vil.

818
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:47,485
I had no idea that Kevin was a…

819
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:49,487
that I let myself trust him.

820
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,358
Oh, this is all so dreadful.
You need distraction, darling.

821
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:57,127
I'm having a few friends 'round for
dinner tonight with their dogs.

822
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:59,430
Why don't you and yours join us?

823
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:02,433
Adults only, of course.
Oh, do come.

824
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:06,537
Remember, darling, we have
the doggies to live for.

825
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:11,175
Smashing.

826
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:16,547
A party?

827
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:21,285
I was hoping we would
dine alone tonight.

828
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,689
- I can't be seen dining with a furrier, you fool.
- You fool!

829
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:28,693
Grr! In fact, you shouldn't
even be here at all.

830
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:31,696
Why do you keep that "job
odd" man about the place?

831
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:34,465
Are you jealous, Jean-Pierre?
Jealous? Of him?

832
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,734
Poo!
What can he do for you?

833
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,736
Steal puppies.
Poo!

834
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,539
Like taking the baby from the candy.
Oh, just like.

835
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:43,641
Well, now's your chance
to impress me.

836
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,477
I've saved the last three for you.
Me?

837
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:50,347
Three very special puppies.
The owner will be out.

838
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:54,752
But, cherie… faint heart never
won fair lady, Jean-Pierre.

839
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:59,256
The keys, my little c-cabbage.

840
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:18,909
Dipstick.

841
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,222
Chloe, darling!
Dipstick.

842
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:34,224
How kind of you to come.

843
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:36,393
Oh!

844
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,696
We're not still holding
a grudge, are we?

845
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,599
Dipstick, be polite.

846
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:44,902
I'm so pleased
you're here, darling.

847
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,904
Come with me.

848
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:51,609
Now, tell me.

849
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:54,579
Your little spotted puppies…

850
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,647
Are snug and safe at home?

851
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59,817
Yes, they're with Dottie.
Oh, with mummy!

852
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,919
Yes.
How dear.

853
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:06,791
It's such a relief to
have the bad man in jail.

854
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:10,728
If puppies can't be
safe in this world, who can?

855
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:19,637
Dinner is served.

856
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,439
Alonzo?

857
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:27,478
Take our guests of honor
to their places.

858
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:30,515
I've a special surprise
planned for you, my dear.

859
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:47,297
Tonight our dogs
join us at table…

860
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:51,669
So we can show our appreciation
to a magnificent species.

861
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:53,771
My past…

862
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,840
Has been riddled with mistakes.

863
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,375
I pray someday to be forgiven.

864
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,611
Shh.

865
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:05,382
But tonight I will begin
to set things right.

866
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,518
From tonight…

867
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:10,220
We'll be closer than ever.

868
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:16,226
- To the dogs.
- To the dogs!

869
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:31,041
"Bone" appetit!

870
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:35,445
Please eat! Eat!

871
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:45,422
Dipstick.
Do you want mine?

872
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:00,571
Ugh!

873
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:10,581
Whee!

874
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:12,783
Whee!

875
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,055
Oh, my… oh!

876
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,790
Everyone, eat!

877
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:36,907
Where's dipstick?
Dipstick!

878
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:39,409
Dipstick!

879
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:17,441
Oh!

880
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:21,545
Oh. Oh.

881
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:43,567
Ahh, bonsoir, my little ones.

882
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,936
I am the great LePelt,

883
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:50,941
and you are… how do
you say… dog meat.

884
01:01:53,778 --> 01:01:56,613
Oh!
Nice. Nice, doggy.

885
01:01:57,782 --> 01:02:01,618
Dog nice!
Aaaah! Nice!

886
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:06,556
Quiet!

887
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,693
Shh. Nice doggy.

888
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,195
Be quiet!

889
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,865
Be nice.

890
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:16,801
Naah!

891
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,116
Hee-hee! Hee-hee!

892
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:45,996
Three puppies, she said, hmm?

893
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,132
Yaah!

894
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:53,838
Well.

895
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:09,619
Aaah! Aaaah!

896
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:12,322
Oh!

897
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:32,702
Surprise!

898
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:35,405
Earlier than I planned,
but c'est la vie.

899
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:38,775
- I hereby revoke your probation.
- And I hereby lock you up.

900
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:42,379
With St. Kevin of assisi in the
clink, it just wouldn't do…

901
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,382
If three more puppies
were reported missing.

902
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:47,918
- Three more?
- Good-bye, my dear.

903
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:49,786
No!

904
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:53,690
I'll think of you every time I
wear your sweet little doggies!

905
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,960
No!

906
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:58,328
Stop!

907
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:14,278
Ooh, not bad.

908
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:16,813
The english can do the knitwear.

909
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,436
Shh! Be quiet!

910
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:57,154
Ooh!

911
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,823
Hey, what's that?
Listen. Hey.

912
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:02,993
Do you hear that?
What? What is it?

913
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:06,830
Uh, best I can make out, they're
all yappin' about "tubble."

914
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:10,034
Tubble? Oh, trouble.
Must be puppies talking.

915
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,036
Listen. Hey, wait.
There's more.

916
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:16,840
Uh, "widdle ones"?
"Bad man gwab widdle ones.

917
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:18,875
Twee potted doggies."

918
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,046
Potted?
Twee widdle potted…

919
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:26,416
bad man grabs three
little spotted doggies.

920
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:32,089
Oh, my gosh.
Chloe's dogs.

921
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,378
Aah!

922
01:07:10,294 --> 01:07:13,063
Aaaah!

923
01:07:13,097 --> 01:07:15,565
Oh! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

924
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:30,947
The puppies!

925
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,084
Thank you, fluffy!

St. John's mews, please. You know,
I could get five to ten for this.

935
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:33,443
That's 35 to 70 in dog years.

936
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:35,479
Ow!

937
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,309
They've gone.

938
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,389
Where are they? Calm
down, calm down.

939
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:24,561
- Whoa!
- Aah!

940
01:09:26,263 --> 01:09:29,666
Hoo! Aaah!

941
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:40,710
I'm so sorry.
I should have trusted you.

942
01:09:40,744 --> 01:09:43,347
No, I should never
have trusted Cruella.

943
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,315
With my police record…
it doesn't matter.

944
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:47,351
Yes, it does matter.

945
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,688
Look,

946
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:55,692
I broke into the lab
and freed those dogs.

947
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,595
They were being used
for experiments.

948
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:03,567
That was your
dognapping conviction?

949
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,035
Yes.

950
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,405
That's all?
Yes.

951
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:42,639
What's this?

952
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:45,008
"The orient-express."

953
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:49,679
Paris.

954
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:54,017
They're going to Paris!
Come on!

955
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,288
Oh, Jean-Pierre,
you've outdone yourself.

956
01:10:58,322 --> 01:11:01,325
I am the Napoleon of the fur,
and you are my…

957
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:04,060
Waterloo? My Josephine.
Together we'll…

958
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,795
aaah! A rat!

959
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,133
I need spotted puppies,
you idiot!

960
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,469
But it is not a rat.
I know rats!

961
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:15,271
It's a "poopie."
Alonzo!

962
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:17,607
Yes. Find the rat and kill it.

963
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,510
- Lepelt and I will be on the orient-express.
- K-kill?

964
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:24,314
The last time I underestimated a
puppy, I wound up in the pokey!

965
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:26,583
Go! Go!
Why not him?

966
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,786
Oh! Yes, I see.
Thank you.

967
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,471
Ahh.

968
01:11:47,504 --> 01:11:49,839
There.

969
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,122
Yaah!

970
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:13,397
Oh, oh. Ohh!

971
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,765
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh!

972
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:26,175
Excuse me. The orient-express?
Platform nine.

973
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:31,715
Paris! City of I'amour!
Of la mode!

974
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:34,384
Of LePelt!

975
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,910
Lepelt, with his
slippery frenchman ways.

976
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:04,581
She'll see. She'll see
that I'm the loyal one.

977
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:09,586
Alonzo. Oh, joy. Le petit homme.

978
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,888
You took care of the rat?

979
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:16,225
You will never…

980
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:19,429
See it… again.

981
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,904
This isn't the orient-express.

982
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,774
We're on the wrong platform!
There she is!

983
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:35,645
Come on.

984
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:41,317
Oddball!

985
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:46,322
Oh, no, I can't look!
She'll be killed!

986
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:53,930
Somebody do something!

987
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:57,501
Oh, what am I doing?
Help! Help!

988
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:59,469
Your wings!
Flap your wings!

989
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:03,673
Flap wings? Oh!
Where did these come from?

990
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:06,943
Blimey, they work!
I can fly!

991
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,546
Dogs can fly!

992
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:20,323
Whee-yah!

993
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:23,527
I just realized I'm not
a rottweiler at all!

994
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,595
I'm a retriever.

995
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,846
Where are we going?
Paris!

996
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:44,881
We've missed the train! Then
we'll catch the next one!

997
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,520
You think he saw us?
We better… we better hide.

998
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:52,522
But where?

999
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:57,727
What? Bad wady's cow?

1000
01:14:57,761 --> 01:15:00,396
Oh, good idea, spotty.

1001
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:17,446
Vive la Paris!
Careful now.

1002
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,251
Careful. Careful.

1003
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:25,689
Uh, careful!

1004
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:28,725
Mustn't harm the
"poopies."

1005
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:43,740
The p-poopieman
gets to ride in the c-car.

1006
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:46,610
Is Alonzo keeping up?

1007
01:15:46,643 --> 01:15:48,778
The little man is too slow.

1008
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:53,082
This traffic is too slow. The French
are useless behind the wheel!

1009
01:15:57,621 --> 01:15:59,756
Aah! You're
going the wrong way!

1010
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:02,525
They're going the wrong way!

1011
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,595
We're going to die!

1012
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,904
Shut up, Jean-Pierre!

1013
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:21,044
Jean-Pierre, our next challenge:

1014
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,947
Reinventing the poodle skirt.

1015
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:47,336
Nothing. Nobody saw anything.
Oh!

1016
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,448
I didn't know you spoke French.

1017
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:04,487
Come on! Come on!

1018
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,489
Taxi, stop!

1019
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:21,771
So what did they say?

1020
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:24,507
Follow les chiens.

1021
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:36,786
It's spooky, all right,

1022
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:40,489
but you'd have to be a sniveling,
whimpering, cowardly little chihuahua…

1023
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:43,192
Not to barge right in there and
take charge of the situation…

1024
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:45,528
With no hesitation at all.

1025
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:49,098
After you, then.

1026
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:02,678
Ohh, I'm gonna regret this.

1027
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:19,095
What do you look at?
Work! Work!

1028
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:26,069
Illegal immigrants?
Of course.

1029
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:28,905
Hmm. How much?

1030
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:32,742
Fifty francs a week.
Oh.

1031
01:18:32,776 --> 01:18:35,044
That's not much.

1032
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:37,747
It's all they can afford.

1033
01:18:37,781 --> 01:18:41,084
Sure hope you know
where you're going, pup.

1034
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:45,254
Bingo.

1035
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:48,925
Don't worry, oddball. I'll
have 'em out in a jiffy.

1036
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:58,802
Hmm. Tastes like chicken.

1037
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:10,613
Ooh.

1038
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:16,052
It's no good looking
at me like that.

1039
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,621
It won't do any good, you know.

1040
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:22,826
Sorry.

1041
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,843
Okay.

1042
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:58,194
Go right through.

1043
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:00,663
Did you hear something?

1044
01:20:00,696 --> 01:20:03,132
It's just your little man
outside.

1045
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:10,874
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

1046
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:17,213
Hey, I thought I told you
to wait outside. Hey.

1047
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:21,650
I know, but they
were worried. Oh!

1048
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:26,022
Hello!

1049
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,691
Hi!

1050
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:31,227
Okay, let's get them
out of here.

1051
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:35,731
Come on.
Well, miss Houdini.

1052
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,002
Aren't you in a tight spot?

1053
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,372
Ooh, what fun
to get away with murder!

1054
01:20:43,406 --> 01:20:45,708
Ta-ta!

1055
01:20:48,711 --> 01:20:51,680
I'm really beginning
to dislike that woman.

1056
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:01,090
There's got to be a way
out of here.

1057
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:14,938
Hello, nice bird. Aah! Aah!

1058
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:17,073
Waddlesworth!
Is oddball with you?

1059
01:21:17,106 --> 01:21:20,343
You bet she's here.
She's commando leader.

1060
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,246
- Now, pass up the pups, quick.
- Okay.

1061
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,282
One. Have a seat.

1062
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:31,387
Two. Good, good.
Join the other one.

1063
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,323
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

1064
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:58,948
One hundred. In a bunch.
Come on, in a bunch.

1065
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:02,385
One hundred and…
are you 100 or 101?

1066
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:05,788
Great. Now we have to start
all over again. That's it.

1067
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:15,131
Bring me the "poopies"!

1068
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:17,000
Come on!

1069
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:28,344
This is my favorite part.

1070
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:31,014
The skinning?
Not the strangling?

1071
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:33,149
Ah, I like the strangling also.

1072
01:22:33,182 --> 01:22:36,986
The Mark of a great furrier, Alonzo,
is that he does his own strangling.

1073
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,355
Remember that.
Thank you.

1074
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,357
Shh.

1075
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,796
Wha…

1076
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:52,001
Aaah!
It's the little rat!

1077
01:22:52,035 --> 01:22:54,270
You lied to me.

1078
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,006
M-m-me? Why should I… ugh!

1079
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,843
Does she look dead to you?
Does she?

1080
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:04,380
You worm!
I'll kill her myself.

1081
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:09,218
You are a wormy little man.

1082
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:19,262
Oh!

1083
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:24,067
Aaah!

1084
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:38,214
Whoa!

1085
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:41,917
Oh! You're both idiots!

1086
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:01,470
Aah! Excuse me!

1087
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,113
Work!

1088
01:24:21,624 --> 01:24:24,293
Now I crush you, little man!

1089
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:29,565
Aaah!

1090
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:35,271
Who's the little man now?

1091
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:41,477
Aaah!

1092
01:24:58,161 --> 01:25:02,165
I'll wear you on my sleeve.

1093
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:41,370
Here, puppy, puppy.
Puppy.

1094
01:25:41,404 --> 01:25:44,039
Sweet puppy.

1095
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,476
Uhh!

1096
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:25,180
Oh! Oh!

1097
01:26:52,107 --> 01:26:56,712
Oh, oh!
No!

1098
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:59,282
Aah!

1099
01:27:02,117 --> 01:27:04,987
Aaaah! Ugh.

1100
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,734
Oh! Oh!

1101
01:27:29,144 --> 01:27:31,314
Oh. Aah!

1102
01:27:56,839 --> 01:27:59,308
Oh! Aah, aah!

1103
01:27:59,342 --> 01:28:02,244
Ohh! Aah! Aah!

1104
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:09,518
Aaah! Aaah!

1105
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:29,705
Quickly! To the bakery!
But can we trust him?

1106
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:33,376
Now is not the time to count
your change, Kevin. Come on!

1107
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:35,378
She's after the puppies!

1108
01:29:03,406 --> 01:29:06,274
I've got you now,
you little rat!

1109
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:26,895
Oh.

1110
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:36,439
Without spots, you're just
not worth the trouble.

1111
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:38,441
Chop, chop.

1112
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:46,782
And now to my coat!

1113
01:30:16,845 --> 01:30:20,215
Domino! Little Dipper!

1114
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,385
Oddball!
Oddball?

1115
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:26,789
Where are you? Come out,
come out, wherever you are!

1116
01:30:51,847 --> 01:30:54,182
Ahh!

1117
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:47,502
Aaah-aah!

1118
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:49,972
Oh!

1119
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:52,374
And now for the topper.

1120
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:54,910
You may now kick the bride.

1121
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:27,409
I'm ruined! This is the
fall of Maison LePelt.

1122
01:32:27,442 --> 01:32:29,845
How do we get out
from this mess?

1123
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:32,480
Piece of cake.

1124
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,639
Look out, everybody!
It's the bad lady's cow.

1125
01:32:56,672 --> 01:32:58,641
Oh, no.

1126
01:33:09,985 --> 01:33:12,387
Hello, all.

1127
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,791
I've come from miss De vil's
solicitor, Mr. Torte.

1128
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:19,527
I asked if I might have the
pleasure of delivering this.

1129
01:33:33,776 --> 01:33:36,979
- Eight million pounds?
- Yes!

1130
01:33:37,012 --> 01:33:39,481
It's the judge's orders.
Eight million quid?

1131
01:33:39,514 --> 01:33:41,483
Eight million pounds!
Eight million quid.

1132
01:33:41,516 --> 01:33:43,919
It's for the dogs, of course.
That's eight million.

1133
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,955
And for the best, unless…
unless she's rehabilitated.

1134
01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:48,957
No, Alonzo.

1135
01:33:48,991 --> 01:33:51,827
Cruella will always be Cruella.

1136
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,796
Hope Springs eternal.

1137
01:33:59,668 --> 01:34:02,170
What's that puppy
doing up there?

1138
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:06,809
No, oddball!
Oddball!

1139
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:13,716
Oh, oddball!
Ohh!

1140
01:34:13,749 --> 01:34:17,185
What have you been up to now?
What have you been doing?

1141
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:19,888
Hey! Hey.

1142
01:34:19,922 --> 01:34:22,024
Ohh!

1143
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:24,026
Dirt.

1144
01:34:24,059 --> 01:34:26,995
Kevin. Look.

1145
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:30,833
These won't come off.
She's got her spots.

1146
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:33,869
Oddball's got her spots!

1147
01:34:33,902 --> 01:34:35,904
Look!

1148
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:49,184
