1
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:45,065
Some say juvenile.

2
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:47,799
I say genius!

3
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:00,884
Leave me alone!

4
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,714
Matt, I'm getting ready
for graduation!

5
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,316
Matt!

6
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,660
Say goodbye
to your little toy.

7
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:21,331
And say hello to Matt owning
his big sister for eternity!

8
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,339
Never give up

9
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,743
Yeah, yeah

10
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:30,577
Never give up

11
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,245
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

12
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:40,349
I'm gonna be
your number one

13
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:42,291
I'm not the kind of girl

14
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:46,320
Who gives up
just like that

15
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,196
Oh, no

16
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:53,864
It's not the things you do
that tease and hurt me bad

17
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,433
But it's the way you do
the things you do to me

18
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,876
I'm not the kind of girl

19
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:04,939
Who gives up
just like that

20
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:07,679
Oh, no

21
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,622
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

22
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:16,718
I'm gonna be
your number one

23
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:21,289
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

24
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:24,859
I'm gonna be
your number one

25
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,165
Ooh

26
00:02:26,238 --> 00:02:29,230
Number one

27
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:30,969
Number one

28
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:34,206
Number one

29
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,610
Number one

30
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:39,617
Every girl wants you
to be her man

31
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:44,952
But I'll wait right here
till it's my turn

32
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,787
I'm not the kind of girl

33
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:50,760
Who gives up
just like that

34
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,559
Oh, no

35
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:58,433
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

36
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:03,100
I'm gonna be
your number one

37
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:07,839
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

38
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:12,350
I'm gonna be
your number one

39
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:15,546
Number one

40
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,054
Number one

41
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:20,853
Number one

42
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:21,915
Gotta hold on

43
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,155
Every time
that I get the feeling

44
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,527
You give me something
to believe in

45
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,725
Every time
that I got you near me

46
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,962
I know the way
that I want it to be

47
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,664
But you know
I'm gonna take my chance now

48
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,764
I'm gonna make it happen
somehow

49
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,866
And you know
I can take the pressure

50
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:40,411
A moment's pain
for a lifetime of pleasure

51
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,538
Pleasure, pleasure,
pleasure...

52
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:47,017
Every girl wants you
to be her man

53
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:51,716
But I'll wait right here
till it's my turn

54
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,815
I'm not the kind of girl

55
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:58,056
Who gives up
just like that

56
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,621
Oh, no

57
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,659
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

58
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:10,003
I'm gonna be
your number one

59
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,940
The tide is high

60
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,501
But I'm holding on

61
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,243
I'm gonna be
your number one

62
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:19,249
Whoa!

63
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:21,912
Every time
that I get the feeling

64
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:24,148
You give me something
to believe in

65
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,487
Every time
that I got you near me

66
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,788
I know the way
that I want it to be

67
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,386
But you know
I'm gonna take my chance now

68
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,590
I'm gonna make it happen
somehow

69
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:35,860
And you know
I can take the pressure

70
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,334
A moment's pain
for a lifetime of pleasure

71
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,665
The tide is high...

72
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,105
I shall win the Academy Award!

73
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:46,208
Yesterday, you were in diapers,

74
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,712
and now you're graduating
junior high.

75
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,908
You're growing up, and I can't
believe you're going to Rome

76
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:54,179
for two weeks
all by yourself.

77
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:58,053
Without me.
Without me there with you.

78
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,750
Without me with you there.

79
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:01,087
You there without me.

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Mom, that's about
all the combinations

81
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,256
of those words you can make.

82
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,390
Lizzie, this is a big day
for you, sweetheart.

83
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,628
He's going to quote a dead guy.

84
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,403
As William Shakespeare wrote,
"Be not afraid of greatness:

85
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:18,034
some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

86
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,544
and some have greatness
thrust upon them."

87
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,775
Thanks, Dad, but I'm just trying
to get through graduation.

88
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,409
Greatness can wait
till this nightmare's over.

89
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:27,577
Hey, Gordo.

90
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,382
So, do I look okay?

91
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,853
I'm your guy best friend.

92
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:33,153
You should talk to Miranda
about this.

93
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:35,056
But she's in Mexico City.

94
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,290
Yes. Your blue robe
looks way cooler

95
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:40,160
than all the other girls'.

96
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:41,893
Oh...my...God.

97
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,698
Only you would think
you could hide that powder- blue,

98
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,329
puffy-sleeved,
it's-kind-of-a-peasant-dress-

99
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:49,806
but-it-might-just-be-
a-baggy- disaster

100
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,900
that you wore
to the spring dance.

101
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,147
Lizzie McGuire, you are
an outfit repeater!

102
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,678
But I...

103
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,447
Maybe I'm an outfit repeater,

104
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,284
but you're
an outfit rememberer,

105
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:06,324
which is just as pathetic.

106
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:09,019
Does she not have
anything better to do

107
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:10,891
than make my life miserable?

108
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:14,126
I mean...
we used to be best friends.

109
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,531
But that was before
she became popular.

110
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,365
McGuire!

111
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,337
Go.

112
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,929
Hey, Mr. Escobar.

113
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,840
Nice after-shave.

114
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,139
Oh, thank you.

115
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:30,045
Margaret Chan either has ebola
or a very bad cold.

116
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,548
In any event, you're up.

117
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:33,050
U-U-Up where?

118
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:34,676
At the podium.

119
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:37,813
You are going to deliver
the class president's speech.

120
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,982
B-But what about
the vice president?

121
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:41,252
He's not graduating.

122
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,453
The secretary treasurer's
next in line.

123
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,359
All I did was handle petty cash.

124
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,490
I'm sorry, but you're not
buying your way out of this.

125
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,535
I want you to deliver
your speech

126
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:52,570
with as much pride
and commitment

127
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,071
as Margaret Chan would,

128
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,266
even though
you're no Margaret Chan.

129
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:05,248
You're no Margaret Chan.

130
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:07,683
You're no Margaret Chan.

131
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:09,118
You're no Margaret Chan.

132
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:10,779
Run!

133
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,594
Ladies and gentlemen,
uh, Lizzie McGuire.

134
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:28,970
Um...

135
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,771
U-Uh, Margaret Chan
couldn't make it tonight,

136
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:36,007
so I'm going - I'm going to
be filling in for her.

137
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,081
Not that any of us
could really do that,

138
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,245
but, um, anyway...

139
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:45,313
Honey, I'm losing the feeling
in my knuckles.

140
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,416
I think that we can all agree
that junior high

141
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,155
is filled with
embarrassing and awkward

142
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,723
and sometimes just downright
humiliating moments, right?

143
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,029
Uh...

144
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,539
Oh!
Me neither.

145
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,802
It is so sad.

146
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:06,935
Wow.

147
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,173
It's like watching one
of those animals

148
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,238
get killed
on the Discovery Channel.

149
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,121
I-I think Margaret Chan

150
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,318
would want me to have
some water right now.

151
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:23,883
Uhh! Oh!

152
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,170
Play something!
Do something!

153
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:41,638
Yes! Ha ha ha!

154
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:43,236
Come on! Mom! Dad!

155
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,248
I've got to get out
of the country!

156
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,149
I know you're still upset,
but it wasn't that bad.

157
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:49,550
Oh, really, Mom?

158
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,351
Was your junior-high graduation
on "Good Morning America"?

159
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:56,086
What creep would send
Diane Sawyer a video

160
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,821
to embarrass you like that?

161
00:08:57,895 --> 00:08:58,919
Oh.

162
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,899
- Ugh!

163
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:10,668
What is that?

164
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:13,005
That is Miss Ungermeyer.

165
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:15,341
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

166
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:18,438
She's gonna be our principal
for the next four years.

167
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,074
If you stay on her good side,

168
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:22,745
it's a one-way ticket
to an lvy League school.

169
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,583
What if you're on her bad side?

170
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:27,522
Excuse me!
I need to mop up some puke.

171
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:28,819
Well, you...

172
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:31,157
You wind up as that guy?

173
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:34,527
No. You end up working
for that guy.

174
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:37,658
Can you make sure there are
no garlic or soy products

175
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,396
in anything Brittany
puts near her mouth?

176
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,631
Miss Ungermeyer,
Luke has tennis elbow.

177
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,536
Could somebody
carry his luggage?

178
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:46,508
My son has asthma,
and he must have his puffer.

179
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,545
Brittany, she's got allergies.

180
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,244
Attention, parents...

181
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:54,250
shut your pie holes.

182
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,651
I'm on a mission here
to drag your progeny

183
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:01,350
to 31 historically significant
Roman landmarks

184
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,518
in two weeks.

185
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:07,223
Now, when these back-talking
miscreants return to you,

186
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:11,098
they will have dipped their
toes in a lake of culture,

187
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:12,829
before assuming their destiny

188
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,996
folding shirts
at the outlet mall.

189
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,701
Many - actually, most -
of your classmates opted

190
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:22,610
for the 36-hour bus ride
to the Water-slide Wonderland.

191
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,942
Whoo!

192
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,709
But you...

193
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:29,844
you, who are not
mouth- breathing trailer trash,

194
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,412
you will get to experience
the delights

195
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,516
of la citta eterna!

196
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,856
Hmm-hmm.

197
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,293
Rome. The eternal city.

198
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:43,424
Did no one read
the info packets?

199
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,900
Watch and learn.

200
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:50,796
Um, Miss Ungermeyer,

201
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,208
I just wanted to let you know
I'm really looking forward

202
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,247
to this exciting
and academically enriching trip.

203
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:58,281
What's your name?

204
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,338
David Gordon.

205
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,974
- David Gordon.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,643
I think, in ltalian,

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,281
that means a sneaky brownnoser
with a hidden agenda, huh?

208
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:07,790
Uh, uh.

209
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:09,917
Yeah! Come on,
check those bags!

210
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:12,155
I want to see that junk
in the trunk

211
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:13,594
and a seat looking neat.

212
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,992
Okay.

213
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,000
Mom...

214
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:28,209
Okay, it's only
two weeks, Mom.

215
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,145
- Honey, she's got to go.
- Two weeks.

216
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:36,819
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

217
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:38,787
- Safe trip, huh?
- Okay.

218
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,951
Sweetheart...

219
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:18,918
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,993
Flight 72 to Rome.

221
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,095
Final boarding,
Flight 72 to Rome.

222
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:32,006
Hey! We're going to the land
where they invented spaghetti!

223
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,805
Ah heh.

224
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:35,469
Yeah, and the best part is

225
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,140
Kate and all the little
teeth- whitening friends

226
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,809
who'd be ragging on me
for messing up graduation

227
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:42,476
went to Water-slide Wonderland.

228
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,579
How many Lizzies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

229
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:49,092
I don't know, but it only takes
one to screw up a graduation.

230
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,109
Hey. Zip it.

231
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,780
Whoa!

232
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:17,912
Whoa!

233
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:08,131
Down each avenue or via,
street or strata

234
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:14,007
You can see 'em disappearing
two by two

235
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,878
On an evening in Roma

236
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:20,178
Do they take 'em
for espresso?

237
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,911
Yeah, I guess so

238
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:27,582
On each lover's arm,
a girl I wish I knew

239
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,526
On an evening in Roma

240
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:35,531
So please meet me
in the plaza near your casa

241
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:41,196
I am only one,
and that is one too few

242
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:44,934
On an evening in Roma

243
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:48,500
Don't know what
the country's coming to

244
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,605
But in Rome,
do as the Romans do

245
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,378
Will you?

246
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:57,818
- On an evening in Roma

247
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,950
Here we are.
Step right up.

248
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,120
Number one...
Number two...

249
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,543
Welcome to the Hotel Cambini.

250
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:08,891
Welcome to the Hotel Cambini.

251
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:12,026
Lest you think there are many
of you and less of me

252
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:15,538
and it will therefore be easy
to pull anything over on me,

253
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:16,630
think again.

254
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,641
In addition to being
smarter, faster,

255
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,574
and better-looking
than most of you,

256
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:22,441
I've also enlisted
a little help.

257
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:25,914
The assistant manager
of the hotel, Giorgio Averni,

258
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,042
was a commander
in the ltalian Navy

259
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:31,554
and is therefore
as up on his game as I am mine.

260
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:34,113
Giorgio, would you like
to brief my students

261
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:36,557
on the security procedures
of the hotel?

262
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:40,085
We serve at 5:00.

263
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:41,859
The cookies.

264
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,263
Yeah.

265
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:47,600
You heard the man.

266
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,104
Room assignments.

267
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:50,697
David Gordon...

268
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:53,265
you will be rooming
with Ethan Craft.

269
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:55,107
You'll be in Room 103.

270
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,272
Are those English
or ltalian numbers?

271
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:58,940
You got a problem with that?

272
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:00,415
Um, no, ma'am.

273
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,748
Any room is just -
just fine for me.

274
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,412
Being a spineless jellyfish

275
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:07,753
is almost as unattractive
as being a little brownnoser.

276
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,088
McGuire!

277
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:15,461
Seeing as how Margaret Chan
was unable to make the trip,

278
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:17,762
you will be rooming with...

279
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:20,736
Okay, I am not,
under any circumstances,

280
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:22,362
sharing a room with -

281
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,532
I'll be taking the bed
by the window.

282
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,939
You don't mind, do you?

283
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:29,376
Uh, ye-e-e-e-s!

284
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,607
No.

285
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:34,412
I sleep much better
with the Swiss eiderdown.

286
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,544
Lizzie, seeing as we're roomies

287
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,986
and we're gonna be spending
time together,

288
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:41,149
I wanted to let you know
I understand

289
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:44,285
you want to put all that
embarrassing stuff behind you

290
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:46,829
and just move on
and have a fresh start.

291
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,427
You do?

292
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,263
Yes. I understand
your dream.

293
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:52,495
It's a big dream.

294
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:55,402
It's a huge dream,
and you can't do it alone.

295
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,100
In fact, I don't think
you can do it at all.

296
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,233
Let it go.

297
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,610
Lizzie, come on.

298
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,917
Whoa!

299
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:09,975
Gordo, what?

300
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,714
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

301
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:12,949
Where are we going?

302
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:14,547
Look.

303
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,383
Wow!

304
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:19,895
Pretty cool, huh?

305
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,100
You know what, Gordo?

306
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,866
I'm not gonna let
Kate Sanders get to me.

307
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,167
Promise me something.

308
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,229
Anything.

309
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:34,243
Promise that when we're here,
we'll find adventures.

310
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:36,973
All right? This is
our chance to start over.

311
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,572
I mean, do anything
that we want to do.

312
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,845
Yeah. I-I know.
You're right.

313
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,649
Hmm. You and me.
Adventures. Deal.

314
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,687
Deal.

315
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,388
The Trevi Fountain was designed

316
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,993
by Gian Lorenza Bernini
and Peitro da Cortona

317
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,536
in the 17th century.

318
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:03,698
And it took about 100 years
to finish this bad boy.

319
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:07,210
Throughout history, people have
come from all over the world

320
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:10,542
to make a wish and toss their
coin in the Trevi Fountain.

321
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:12,241
Those people are suckers.

322
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:14,807
You got to make your own luck
in this world.

323
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,480
All right, moving on, people.
Let's go.

324
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,522
Scusi,

325
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,182
Grazie.

326
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:23,783
Scusi, Grazie,

327
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,852
You know what?
Forget what she says.

328
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,123
Make a wish.

329
00:18:27,197 --> 00:18:29,427
I'm in Rome
with my best friend.

330
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,195
I'm good.
You make one.

331
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:32,929
Okay.

332
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:34,334
Hmm.

333
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,769
Okay.

334
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,877
lsabella?

335
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:51,420
Huh?

336
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,317
Okay, I was wishing for smooth
sailing through high school,

337
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,418
but this will work.

338
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:00,395
Uh, I'm sorry.

339
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:04,764
It's just you look an awful lot
like a friend of mine.

340
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:07,861
Paolo, you have to get
to your photo shoot.

341
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,064
We got to go.

342
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:14,239
What you little halflings
are feeling right about now

343
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:15,903
is your energy flagging.

344
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:17,674
We got four more stops today.

345
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:20,239
I want you to
at least be able to shuffle

346
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:21,841
from monument to monument.

347
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,353
We got one word for that,
and it's gelato.

348
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,582
Keep in mind
that ltalian ice cream has

349
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:29,217
about twice the sugar
of American ice cream.

350
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,887
Means you're gonna want about
two scoops, huh?

351
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,896
I know I do.
All right.

352
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,488
I don't mean to bother you.

353
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,898
I'm Paolo.
Paolo Valisari.

354
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,334
Oh, um, I'm Lizzie McGuire,

355
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,099
and this is my friend Gordo.

356
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,662
This is my friend Sergei.

357
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,402
Sergei, doesn't she look
exactly like lsabella?

358
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,943
- lsabella!
- Paolo!

359
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,474
Um...

360
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,517
Paolo!

361
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,416
lsabella! Isabella!

362
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,415
Paolo! Paolo!

363
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,822
Ciao, Paolo!

364
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,655
Uh, hmm...

365
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:13,632
Wow! That really
does look like me.

366
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:16,730
Except for the hair,
you could be her twin.

367
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:20,004
Isabella is my singing partner,
and you're like her sister.

368
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:21,772
Like two pods in a pea.

369
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:26,448
Lizzie, can I see you again?

370
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,949
Maybe tomorrow?

371
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,383
Please?

372
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,387
What's the word for "yes"
in ltalian?

373
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:32,547
- Si,

374
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:33,954
Uh...

375
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,013
No, I'm -

376
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:36,787
It's okay.
I can cover for you.

377
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,327
Head check!

378
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:41,057
I'm sorry. I'm here
with my school, so I can't.

379
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,689
Forgive me
if I embarrassed you.

380
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:44,757
Some people,
when they come to Rome,

381
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:47,065
they want to find adventure.

382
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:49,002
Oh, it's okay.

383
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:51,302
I got some cool cheese.

384
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,434
Did you just say
"cool cheese"?

385
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,477
Wah!

386
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,375
Paolo...

387
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:57,504
We must go.

388
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,142
Uh, Lizzie,
if you change your mind,

389
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,449
I will meet you tomorrow morning
at the Trevi Fountain at 9:00.

390
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:05,715
Hey, Gordon, McGuire,

391
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,882
did you not hear me say
"head check"?

392
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,153
15, 16.

393
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,319
Who are you?

394
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,555
Paolo Valisari.

395
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,359
Put your money
in your front pockets.

396
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:21,067
She makes me very scared.

397
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,265
Join the club.

398
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,830
Lizzie...

399
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,041
Ci vediamo,

400
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:31,080
What does that mean?

401
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:33,616
We will see each other.

402
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,253
Hey.

403
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,723
This Paolo and lsabella CD
isn't so bad.

404
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:45,523
I mean, if you're into
the Alanis Morissette-y,

405
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,756
alternative, dark,
like, brooding,

406
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:48,855
I-never-go-out-

407
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,901
and-my-life's-a-black-hole-
of-depression kind of thing,

408
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,196
you'd think they stink.

409
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,034
For driving-around-in-the-car-
with- the-top- down,

410
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,370
Ioving-life kind of thing,
they're good.

411
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,670
Here. Listen.

412
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:02,109
You don't have to sail
the ocean

413
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,510
Yeah, not bad.

414
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,673
You use scented soap, huh?

415
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:06,841
What?

416
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,750
Um, it -
N-Never - never mind.

417
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,018
So, Paolo wants me to meet him
at the Trevi Fountain tomorrow.

418
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:15,115
So go.

419
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:18,218
That would mean I would have to
sneak away from the group.

420
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,284
So?

421
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:21,023
I'm incapable of sneaking.

422
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,963
Weren't you the one that said

423
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,059
we were gonna have adventures
on this trip?

424
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,400
Yeah. We. We were
going to have adventures.

425
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,734
And we will.

426
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,173
It just so happens that
you have dibs on the first one.

427
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:35,878
Okay.

428
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:38,005
Just as long
as we don't do anything

429
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:41,050
that would get us tossed
on a plane home.

430
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,450
Uh. Unh.

431
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,954
Lizzie, are -
are you feeling okay?

432
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,266
Is this girl sick,
or isn't she?

433
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,432
She doesn't have a fever,
and yet she's in bed.

434
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,970
Ask yourself why
a beautiful young girl

435
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:10,036
on her first visit
to Rome,

436
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:11,706
probably seeking adventure,

437
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:14,273
wants to lie in bed
all day.

438
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:16,779
She's ill.

439
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,119
I heard she fell down
at graduation,

440
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,091
made a complete fool
out of herself.

441
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,855
I saw that on CNN.

442
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,395
CNN?

443
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,456
Often, the nervous system
collapses

444
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,297
after that type of humiliation.

445
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,358
Hmm.

446
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,772
Do you have
any recommendations?

447
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,637
Oh, yeah, yeah.

448
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,475
This young woman
should stay in bed.

449
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:47,574
Uh, she - she should
also eat two apricots.

450
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:49,585
Oh, for digestion or...

451
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:51,883
No, they're in season.
Very delicious.

452
00:23:51,955 --> 00:23:53,752
Feel better, Signorina McGuire.

453
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:55,018
You rest up, McGuire.

454
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:58,152
Don't want you to miss
all the adventures of Rome.

455
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,321
Uh, doctor, I have a boil...

456
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,050
Sorry.

457
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,789
Uno, due, tre,

458
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,026
- Tre,
- Tre,

459
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:41,803
Bene,

460
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:51,812
I-I just - I had them all wish
for you to come.

461
00:24:55,886 --> 00:24:57,877
Hmm...

462
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,322
I don't have much time.
You know my chaperon -

463
00:25:01,391 --> 00:25:02,722
Wait, wait, wait.

464
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,954
I have to show you something.

465
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:06,290
Sometimes the world

466
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:08,354
Is a valley
of heartaches and tears

467
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:09,865
- Come on.

468
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:13,664
And in the hustle and bustle,
no sunshine appears

469
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:17,036
But you and I have a love
always there to remind us...

470
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:18,039
Wow!

471
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,269
You should see Rome
the way Romans do.

472
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,312
So you knew
that I would come.

473
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:23,903
I hoped you would.

474
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:28,245
Are you sure you know
how to drive this thing?

475
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,809
This is Rome.
Nobody knows how to drive.

476
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:33,117
Volare

477
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,249
Oh, oh

478
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,088
Cantare

479
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,754
Oh, oh, oh, oh

480
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,358
Let's fly
way up to the clouds

481
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:47,870
Away from
the maddening crowds

482
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:50,839
We can sing in the glow
of a star that I know of

483
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:52,841
Where lovers enjoy
peace of mind

484
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:56,345
Let us leave the confusion
and all disillusion behind

485
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,278
Just like birds
of a feather

486
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,044
And the rainbow together
we'll find

487
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:02,813
Volare

488
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:04,649
Oh, oh

489
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:06,484
Cantare

490
00:26:06,556 --> 00:26:09,286
Oh, oh, oh, oh

491
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,559
Whoo!

492
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,754
Volare

493
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:40,221
Oh, oh

494
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,222
Oh, oh

495
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,986
Cantare

496
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,029
Oh, oh, oh, oh

497
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:50,032
No wonder
my happy heart sings

498
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,866
Your love has given me
wings

499
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:58,271
No wonder
my happy heart sings

500
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:03,041
Your love has given me
wings

501
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:04,944
Wow!

502
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,981
I don't know what catastrophe
is going to happen in Rome,

503
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:12,180
but with Lizzie there,
something will.

504
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,019
What are you going to do
with that information?

505
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,084
Give it away, like you did
with the graduation video?

506
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,686
Hey! She was really
freaked out by that.

507
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,732
And you have what
to show for it?

508
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,359
The pride of a job well done?

509
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,336
Try buying a PS2 with
the pride of a job well done.

510
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:29,372
Oh!

511
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,304
Matt, Matt, Matt.

512
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,071
We've been over this
before. Cash up front.

513
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:37,113
Melina,
are you staying for dinner?

514
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,205
- I'd love to, Mrs. McGuire.
- Great.

515
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,479
We'll need extra energy to work
on our summer reading list.

516
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,577
In that case,
I'll make brownies.

517
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:45,450
Oh.

518
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,890
I've said it before.
You're weak. Weak!

519
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,621
Don't do anything
without consulting me first.

520
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:57,258
You rock.

521
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:14,517
Hey, Paolo,
can I ask you something?

522
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:15,744
Si, carina,

523
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,913
Um, I know that our lives
are a little different.

524
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,753
Actually, like, several
universes different.

525
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,591
But doesn't Sergei get tired
of following us around?

526
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,687
Actually, Sergei's my bodyguard.

527
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:29,925
So, you see,
between me and Sergei,

528
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,695
you'll always be safe.

529
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,804
Whoa!

530
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:39,740
How famous do you have to be
before you need a bodyguard?

531
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,480
Paolo, go! Go!

532
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:46,709
I-It's Miss Ungermeyer!
It's our bus!

533
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,778
- Go!
- I cannot.

534
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,591
Miss Ungermeyer, didn't we just
pass the Castel Sant'Angelo?

535
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,752
Yep. What about it?

536
00:28:57,828 --> 00:29:00,194
I just noticed
it's not on our itinerary.

537
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:01,491
That is correct.

538
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:03,192
Well, s-shouldn't it be?

539
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:05,461
I-I mean,
it was a papal residence

540
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,093
and it does contain frescoes

541
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,934
from artists influenced
by the school of Raphael.

542
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,769
What are you up to, Gordon?

543
00:29:11,842 --> 00:29:12,866
N-N-Nothing.

544
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:14,308
I-I just figure that,

545
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,402
while in Rome,
we should be exposed

546
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,744
to as much Renaissance,
Raphaelite work

547
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:21,807
typified by chiaroscuro
and Hellenic mythical imagery

548
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,352
as humanly possible.

549
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:27,889
Whew.

550
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,756
Ah, Gordon,
you are on the list,

551
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,261
and the list is not a place
you want to be.

552
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,491
What is this?
Only in Rome, huh?

553
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:40,369
You know how to move that, or
you want me to do it for you?

554
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,096
What are you looking at?

555
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,337
Want a piece of that,
a piece of the Ungermeyer?

556
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,316
Over there by that statue.
You see it?

557
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:59,321
Yeah.

558
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,687
That's where
the artist Caravaggio

559
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,953
had his opponent
burned at the stake.

560
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:04,051
Or was it the pope

561
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:06,460
who had Caravaggio burned
at the stake?

562
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,760
Either way,
this neighborhood was tough.

563
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:13,670
Paolo...

564
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:14,999
Si, carina?

565
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,633
Do you still love her?

566
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,199
Who? Isabella?

567
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,335
Si,

568
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,580
Of course I still love her.

569
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,981
But like a sister.

570
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:29,815
So, why did you break up?

571
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:32,583
It's, um, it's complicated.

572
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,252
- What?

573
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:39,591
Yes, we've been voted "best
pop duo of the year" again.

574
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:41,654
But I want to do
more serious music.

575
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:43,563
And when I told this
to lsabella,

576
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:44,999
she said flat-out "no."

577
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:47,230
I was forced to tell her,
"This is it.

578
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,272
This will be
our last CD together."

579
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:50,829
Did she totally freak out?

580
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:52,341
She totally freak out.

581
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:54,843
I feel awful about that,
but what about me?

582
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,504
I need to grow as an artist.

583
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,512
Yeah.

584
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:59,742
So, the other day
when I saw you,

585
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,479
I just - I don't know,
I had this crazy -

586
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:03,952
I just - I don't know.

587
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:05,318
W-What?

588
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:08,290
I had this crazy idea
that maybe you could help me.

589
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,825
Come on. How crazy could it be?
Just tell me.

590
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:17,025
No, I can't.
It's too - It's too...

591
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:18,625
- Please.
- Okay.

592
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,899
Isabella and I are supposed to
present an award together

593
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:24,202
at the International
Music Video Awards.

594
00:31:24,274 --> 00:31:25,571
Cool!

595
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:28,338
I-I mean, cool for
regular people like me,

596
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:30,437
but for you,
I guess it's like work.

597
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,379
No, no, no.
It's cool for me, too.

598
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:34,417
You get all kinds
of free stuff.

599
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:36,749
But now because lsabella's
so mad at me,

600
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,219
she's refusing to appear.

601
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:41,655
The record company's threatening
to sue if she doesn't show up.

602
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:42,657
What about you?

603
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,956
For me is no problem.
I write the music.

604
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,962
I don't know
where it comes from.

605
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,622
It just comes from me.

606
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,791
La la la la

607
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,062
See?
So I can go solo.

608
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:53,501
But lsabella...

609
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,572
She needs the help to sing.

610
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,303
You mean lsabella lip-synchs?

611
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,309
Please, please!

612
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,846
Promise me you
will speak of this to no one.

613
00:32:03,914 --> 00:32:06,542
Imagine what would happen
to lsabella's career.

614
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:09,643
Oh, that's so sweet.
You still care about her.

615
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,580
You're definitely
broken up, right?

616
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:14,589
Si,

617
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:16,558
So, when I saw you yesterday

618
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:18,925
and how people thought
you were lsabella,

619
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:20,054
I got my crazy idea

620
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,621
that maybe you could pretend
to be lsabella

621
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,929
and present the award
with me onstage.

622
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:27,402
Present an award?
O-Onstage?

623
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:32,772
In front of an audience?

624
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:35,869
I-I-I'm really not good
in front of crowds.

625
00:32:35,946 --> 00:32:37,504
I could never do that.

626
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,549
Of course you can do it.

627
00:32:39,616 --> 00:32:41,277
You are magnifico.

628
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:46,349
I don't know ltalian,
but I know what that means.

629
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:51,688
I don't know, Paolo.
I...

630
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,162
Don't worry, carina,

631
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,859
I could never ask you to do
this crazy thing.

632
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:05,205
No. You know what?
You don't have to ask.

633
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,073
If this is gonna help
you and lsabella, then...

634
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:10,973
...I'll do it.

635
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:13,410
Grazie!

636
00:33:13,483 --> 00:33:15,280
Prego!

637
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:38,040
Head check!

638
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,446
Gordo. Gordo.

639
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:53,685
You, Lizzie McGuire,
are actually presenting an award

640
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:55,247
at the lMVAs with Paolo?

641
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,952
No. Me lsabella with Paolo.

642
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:58,654
- What?
- It's a long story.

643
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:00,720
I'm doing it because
lsabella won't.

644
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:04,130
You're gonna get up onstage
in front of all these people?

645
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:06,999
That's the great thing.
It's not gonna be me.

646
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,970
It's Paolo's idea
to help lsabella

647
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,132
because he still loves her.

648
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,143
But not romantically.
Like a sister.

649
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,838
He is so amazing.

650
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:16,901
And he's 17!

651
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,242
For being so famous

652
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:21,216
and used to getting everything
that you want,

653
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:23,947
he's just -
he's just so kind.

654
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,386
For real?

655
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,514
That's a lot
to say about someone

656
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:28,990
just knowing them a day.

657
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:30,185
I-I know that.

658
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,127
But I feel like
I've known him my whole life.

659
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,629
Anyway, um...

660
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,394
I just wanted to come by
and thank you.

661
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,492
I had the most magical day
of my life.

662
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,197
It wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you.

663
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:44,535
It was that good, huh?

664
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,473
You're such a good friend.

665
00:34:49,246 --> 00:34:50,975
The sting.

666
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:53,646
What sting?

667
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,912
You want a little mano a mano?

668
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:59,646
See, this is
one of the reasons

669
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,418
me and you aren't friends.

670
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:04,426
I never have any idea
what you're talking about.

671
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:06,394
Some dudes get the approach.

672
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:07,589
Others, the sting.

673
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:10,394
That ltalian dude.
He's big-time approach.

674
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:13,800
I actually feel my brain
turning into goo.

675
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,303
Embrace the sting.

676
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:17,567
That's what you're vibin'
from Lizzie.

677
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:19,040
Wait a minute.

678
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:22,442
Now, you actually think
that I'm jealous of Paolo?

679
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:24,412
Word.

680
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:25,971
Oh, no.

681
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,880
No, see, that would mean

682
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,351
that I like Lizzie
as more than a friend.

683
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,684
You and I
have trouble communicating?

684
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,314
You're wrong, man.

685
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,090
Whoa!

686
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:41,324
This girl looks freakishly
like my sister!

687
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:43,697
- Ow.
- Zoom! Zoom!

688
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,237
Another freakish coincidence.

689
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:51,468
I mean, she has the same
necklace as my sister's.

690
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,735
Huh.

691
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:56,142
Why do we even pretend
you're in charge?

692
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:00,372
- Let's see what this says.

693
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,508
Ow.

694
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:02,916
"lsabella goes blond.

695
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:05,250
Italian pop duo
Paolo and lsabella

696
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:08,348
wowed the crowd outside a shop
near the Trevi Fountain,

697
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:10,620
showing off lsabella's
new blond hair."

698
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:14,494
They must think that Lizzie
is this famous singer!

699
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:19,126
And if I show this to my mom,
Lizzie will be so busted!

700
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:22,603
If you show this to your mom,
it's worth nothing.

701
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:27,609
But if you show this
to the ltalian tabloids,

702
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:30,612
we will be rolling in cash,
my friend.

703
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,807
Interesting!

704
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,786
"We"?

705
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:39,236
Not up to toughing it out
on the streets with us?

706
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:40,618
Not up to toughing it out
on the streets with us?

707
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:43,853
I could try, Miss Ungermeyer.

708
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:46,158
No, I just hate seeing you
being denied

709
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,290
the cultural experience
of being in a foreign country.

710
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:50,731
You missed seven points

711
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:52,894
of historical significance
yesterday.

712
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,428
I know. It's really killing me
too, Miss Ungermeyer.

713
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:59,601
Which is why I thought
I'd bring you something

714
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:01,474
to help ease the pain, hmm?

715
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:04,605
Mmh, well, that's really
thoughtful of you.

716
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:07,207
Seeing as how
your teeny- tiny little body

717
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:08,751
doesn't have the strength,

718
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:12,186
we're gonna have to let
your mind do the wandering.

719
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:13,655
Ah!

720
00:37:13,724 --> 00:37:16,420
"The Rise and Decline
of the Roman Empire," hmm?

721
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:19,485
I'd like one report on the rise
and one on the decline.

722
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:20,552
Ouch!

723
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:23,862
If I didn't have a headache
a minute ago, I do now.

724
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:27,870
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

725
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:29,735
Um, no.

726
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:32,867
- What else do I have to do?

727
00:37:32,943 --> 00:37:35,002
Why not

728
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,842
Take a crazy chance?

729
00:37:36,914 --> 00:37:39,109
Why not

730
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:41,242
Do a crazy dance?

731
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:43,218
If you lose the moment

732
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:45,016
You might lose a lot

733
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,580
So why not?

734
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:49,626
Why not?

735
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:52,389
Why not
take a crazy chance?

736
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:55,890
Wow.

737
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:02,234
I am so grateful for your help.

738
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:04,774
You're doing a very kind thing
for lsabella.

739
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:07,037
Uh, Paolo, where are we?

740
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:09,409
Via Condotti.
One of the most expensive

741
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,345
shopping districts
in the world.

742
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,747
We must find you
the perfect outfit.

743
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:17,118
Ah!

744
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:18,984
Oh, hey, lsabella, Paolo!

745
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:20,546
Ciao!

746
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:23,184
Your hair is so blond
and, uh, innocent.

747
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,887
- Who did it?
- Um...

748
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:27,726
The island we were on
was really, really sunny,

749
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:29,527
so it was j-just the sun.

750
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,999
We must get sun, too, no?

751
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:32,365
Ciao, bella!

752
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:33,664
Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.

753
00:38:33,737 --> 00:38:35,261
They are so tall!

754
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:38,308
- They all want to be you.
- They want to be lsabella.

755
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:41,208
Sit and I'll get Franca.
I will just be a moment.

756
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,779
Whoa! Take your time.

757
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:47,942
I'll just be sitting here
in heaven.

758
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:49,417
Hard as it is to imagine,

759
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,681
as we look at the ruins
of the Forum,

760
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:54,121
that this was once
the center of commerce,

761
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:57,058
religion, and politics
in ancient Rome.

762
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,459
All right, now,
the Forum came into being

763
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,725
in the sixth century B.C.,

764
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:06,133
and with it,
a new urban culture was born.

765
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:07,602
Uh, um, di-

766
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:09,263
Yeah, Craft?

767
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,068
Is it time for the spaghetti?

768
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,802
It's 9:00 in the morning.

769
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:15,743
So? You never had leftover
spaghetti for breakfast?

770
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:17,007
I don't eat carbs.

771
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:19,481
You never had
a spaghetti sandwich, either?

772
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,418
This cultural experience
is, like, so wasted on you.

773
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,285
Excuse me, where did you
buy that Prada bag?

774
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:29,424
Craft! Sanders! Separate.

775
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,757
We did, Miss Ungermeyer.
And thank God.

776
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,324
Why don't you people, uh,
do something at your, uh,

777
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,560
skill level here?

778
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:41,502
Take a 10-minute shopping break
while I choke down an espresso.

779
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,134
This dude definitely spent
too much time on his biceps

780
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,509
and not enough on his abs.
Totally old school.

781
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:55,776
Wha-

782
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:57,286
Nice spy, bro.

783
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,878
Yeah, watch and learn.

784
00:39:58,956 --> 00:40:01,754
The slow curve.
Works every time.

785
00:40:01,825 --> 00:40:03,292
I've got to talk to them.

786
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,420
That's not how the slow curve
works. They come to us.

787
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,359
Um, eh, ciao.

788
00:40:12,436 --> 00:40:13,994
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

789
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,403
Do you guys speak English?

790
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:17,735
Yes.

791
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:19,867
It is your friend we like.

792
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,501
Word.

793
00:40:21,578 --> 00:40:23,205
Word?
Is that his name?

794
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,247
Yeah, sure.

795
00:40:24,314 --> 00:40:26,544
Do you know who that is
on the cover?

796
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:29,177
- Oh, lsabella. Certo,
- Certo,

797
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:31,983
Do you think you guys could
translate it for me?

798
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,650
Um, only if
you introduce us to Word.

799
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,525
Can I keep the magazine, then?

800
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:40,222
Deal!

801
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:42,822
All right.
Let's go.

802
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,532
Ciao, Word.

803
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:53,669
Word?

804
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:55,844
Mmh?

805
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:56,971
English?

806
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:58,571
She's speaking English.

807
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:01,914
Our single is in English
and lsabella needs to practice.

808
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:07,684
What have you done?

809
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,089
Uh, uh, uh...

810
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,686
You look...
You look like a schoolgirl.

811
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,756
Maximus, what is wrong?

812
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,925
You love lsabella.

813
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:20,265
Nice Maximus.

814
00:41:23,974 --> 00:41:26,067
Very odd.

815
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,704
There is something...

816
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,908
something very different
about you.

817
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:34,143
Um...

818
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:35,412
Rest.

819
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:37,783
The rest on the island
did lsabella good.

820
00:41:37,854 --> 00:41:38,912
She is transformed.

821
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:40,115
Yeah.

822
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,590
Well, I cannot
put clothes on this.

823
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:43,819
You - fix the hair.

824
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:45,054
Fix the eyebrows.

825
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,060
Fix the lips.

826
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,620
- Oh!
- And fix the ears!

827
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:50,223
Fix the ears?

828
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,894
Jewelry.

829
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,130
Jewelry.

830
00:41:54,204 --> 00:41:56,570
That's a language
every girl understands.

831
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:00,934
You better work

832
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:01,943
Covergirl

833
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:02,979
Work it, girl

834
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:04,172
Give it a twirl

835
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:05,806
Do your thing

836
00:42:05,882 --> 00:42:07,611
On the runway

837
00:42:07,684 --> 00:42:09,311
Work

838
00:42:09,386 --> 00:42:11,479
You better work it, girl

839
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:13,216
Wet your lips

840
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,349
And smile to the camera

841
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:17,188
Work

842
00:42:17,261 --> 00:42:18,626
- Ah! Aah!
- Work

843
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:20,629
- Turn to the right
- Oh!

844
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:21,686
Sashay

845
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:23,357
Chante

846
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:27,392
Well, it don't matter
what you wear

847
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:29,871
They're checkin' out
your savoir faire

848
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,464
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

849
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:34,999
And when you walked
into the room

850
00:42:35,078 --> 00:42:39,139
You had everybody's eyes
on you

851
00:42:39,216 --> 00:42:40,547
Supermodel

852
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,549
Work

853
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,560
Work it, girl

854
00:42:51,628 --> 00:42:53,493
Do your thing

855
00:42:53,563 --> 00:42:55,326
On the runway

856
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:58,300
Work,
you've got to work it, girl

857
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,460
Of the world

858
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,867
Wet your lips

859
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,871
And smile to the camera

860
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:04,873
Work

861
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:06,636
Work

862
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,699
- Aah!
- Work

863
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:09,336
Sashay

864
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:10,641
Chante

865
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,443
Work

866
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:14,313
Work

867
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,578
Work

868
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:16,584
Sashay

869
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:17,585
Chante

870
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:19,918
You better work

871
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,981
Work

872
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,026
Work

873
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,321
Give it up

874
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:27,591
On the ru-u-u-nway

875
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:29,325
Work

876
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,731
Work

877
00:43:31,802 --> 00:43:34,999
Ohhhh

878
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:36,198
Whoo

879
00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:41,534
Okay. Diva - good.

880
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:42,942
Tacky - bad.

881
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,046
We'll have to fix that.

882
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,989
Okay, none of these are me.

883
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:01,553
- Why are you laughing at me?

884
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:03,394
You're not supposed to be you.

885
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:06,095
If I have to go onstage
as lsabella,

886
00:44:06,169 --> 00:44:08,933
then I-I'm gonna have to
be confident,

887
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:10,905
and that's the thing
I'm worst at.

888
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:13,534
- We are all the same that way.
- Not you.

889
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,134
Yes, me, and lsabella, too.

890
00:44:15,212 --> 00:44:17,271
It's how she works
through her fears

891
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:18,507
that makes her strong.

892
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:20,982
Isabella doesn't let
Franca di Montecatini

893
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:22,416
tell her what to wear.

894
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:24,477
Isabella tells Franca.

895
00:44:24,554 --> 00:44:26,283
Okay, so you're telling me

896
00:44:26,356 --> 00:44:28,551
to tell Franca
di Monteca-teca- tecatini

897
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,853
how I should dress?

898
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:30,915
Si,

899
00:44:32,662 --> 00:44:33,993
Test your strength.

900
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:35,929
Vai! Vai, vai,

901
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,624
You don't like my clothes?

902
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:41,170
No. No.
I-I love your clothes.

903
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:43,103
But I don't want you
to dress me.

904
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:45,368
What?!

905
00:44:45,442 --> 00:44:47,501
See, I'm not your Barbie doll.

906
00:44:47,577 --> 00:44:49,340
I am lsabella Parigi,

907
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,438
and I dress myself.

908
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:52,914
So, choices.

909
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:54,416
I-I need choices.

910
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,113
Whoa.

911
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,822
I really like these two.
You pick.

912
00:45:07,297 --> 00:45:08,286
Both.

913
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:10,196
Both.

914
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:11,427
Wow.

915
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,368
This is the exact color
I wore to my spring formal.

916
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:16,906
- Danny Kessler thought...

917
00:45:18,408 --> 00:45:21,866
Look at all of you.
You'd think that I'm American.

918
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:24,641
I am,
how you say, um...

919
00:45:24,714 --> 00:45:25,646
awesome?

920
00:45:28,952 --> 00:45:31,546
The island.
You should go more often.

921
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:33,054
Mmh.

922
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:35,556
Ooh, ooh, ooh

923
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,219
Goodbye, Lizzie McGuire.
Hello, fabulous.

924
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:41,625
Yeah, yeah, yeah

925
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:42,995
Come on

926
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:45,694
You make me feel
like a star

927
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:46,827
Oh, baby

928
00:45:46,903 --> 00:45:49,371
You say, "Stay, baby, stay

929
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,997
Just the way you are"

930
00:45:51,074 --> 00:45:54,066
And tell me, "Girl, you're
fine and you will shine

931
00:45:54,144 --> 00:45:55,805
Forever in my heart"

932
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,575
That's why you,
yeah, you

933
00:45:58,648 --> 00:46:02,084
You make me feel
like a star

934
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:04,245
Ooh, ooh, ooh

935
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,515
- There you go.
- Grazie.

936
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:06,521
Grazie.

937
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,217
Ooh, ooh, ooh

938
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:10,726
I'm ready for my close-up.

939
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:11,920
- Whoo!

940
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:17,027
I cannot believe
that not one Roman guy

941
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,624
has asked me out yet.

942
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:23,397
Look.

943
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:25,703
Paolo...

944
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:26,901
We gotta go!

945
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:31,482
Where's the zoom
on this thing?

946
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:34,049
Uh, uh...

947
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:39,992
Hello? Excuse me.

948
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,466
Oh!

949
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:44,595
I'm sorry.
I was just...

950
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:47,839
Hup! Head check!

951
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,672
Let's go! On the bus,
then back to the hotel!

952
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:52,871
Come on! Come on! Go!

953
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:54,709
Andiamo! Andiamo!

954
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:11,030
- Hold on!

955
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:12,724
Okay! Hello.

956
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:15,962
Hotel Cambini.
This is Giorgio.

957
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:18,730
- Go!
- Huh? What?

958
00:47:18,805 --> 00:47:20,568
Wait.

959
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,437
Excuse me,
can you fix this?

960
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:23,976
It will not close.

961
00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:27,070
Why is it open
when there is no rain?

962
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:28,705
This umbrella is stubborn.

963
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:31,250
It's bad luck to have
an open umbrella inside.

964
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:33,843
- In Hotel Cambini, no bad luck.
- Hey, thanks.

965
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,478
GlORGlO:
Ah!

966
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,120
One at a time.
No running.

967
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,557
Ha ha ha!

968
00:47:45,632 --> 00:47:49,124
Ha! Ha ha!
Age before beauty, huh?

969
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:53,563
You look strangely large
and familiar.

970
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,834
Which floor?

971
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:57,035
Oh. Thank you. First.

972
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,168
Okay.

973
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:02,276
Little hint for you -

974
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:05,375
you want to push the button,
elevator moves.

975
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:07,545
Elevator is not safe.

976
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:08,986
You an employee here?

977
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:10,545
- No.
- No.

978
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:13,491
Who are you to tell me
whether the elevator's safe?

979
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,686
I am Sergei.

980
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,456
Sergei.

981
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:19,362
You're gonna have to
stand down immediately.

982
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:25,360
Just because you are one hunk
of Slavic muscle

983
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:28,407
does not mean you're not
gonna make it on my list!

984
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:30,534
Elevator is safe now.

985
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:40,986
Hey! Your umbrella!

986
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:50,597
Feeling any better?

987
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:51,790
Mom?

988
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:56,261
Still a little warm.

989
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:58,361
Miss Sanders,
would you be so kind

990
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,030
as to look after her for me?

991
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,133
As in do stuff for her?
Why should I be punished?

992
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,837
I'm not the one who's sick.

993
00:49:04,912 --> 00:49:07,278
Next year, I'm joining
the mouth breathers

994
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:08,871
at Water-slide Wonderland.

995
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,678
You are so busted.

996
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:12,844
You've been out
of this hotel room.

997
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,046
What?

998
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:16,215
How do you know?

999
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,484
Please.

1000
00:49:17,558 --> 00:49:20,857
Your eyebrows finally match,
your hair has highlights,

1001
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:22,555
fresh manicure.

1002
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,962
I smelled acetone the second
I walked in the lobby.

1003
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:29,434
Okay, but you didn't rat me out
to Miss Ungermeyer.

1004
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:30,527
Yet.

1005
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:33,072
Not until I figure out
what's in it for me.

1006
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,767
Now spill, Dorkerella.

1007
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:40,411
You'll never make me talk!

1008
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,209
I-I know that this
sounds insane,

1009
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:45,410
but I think Paolo
really does like me.

1010
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:48,147
How could this happen?
How did you get my trip?

1011
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:50,520
How is Lizzie McGuire
living this fantasy

1012
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,582
and I can't even get
an ltalian boy

1013
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,490
to buy me a plate of spaghetti?

1014
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:56,859
Um, Kate,
you don't eat spaghetti.

1015
00:49:57,865 --> 00:50:00,766
I'd eat carbs if an ltalian boy
bought them for me.

1016
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:06,534
So, I suppose you want me
to keep quiet about this?

1017
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,441
Yeah.
I'd appreciate that.

1018
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:10,874
Well, I'll keep it quiet

1019
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:13,674
if you keep it quiet
about me keeping it quiet.

1020
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:17,114
And when we get back home,
I'm the cool one again,

1021
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:19,084
and you turn
back into a pumpkin.

1022
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,044
Oh, my God. It's her.

1023
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:23,350
What are you doing?

1024
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:25,550
Uh, it's a long story.

1025
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,155
What do you want?
We're closed.

1026
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:31,391
I-I just wanted
to talk to Lizzie.

1027
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:32,454
So talk.

1028
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:35,126
I was kind of thinking
maybe, you know,

1029
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:36,829
outside in the courtyard.

1030
00:50:36,904 --> 00:50:39,168
If this is about
that parallel-universe,

1031
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,072
Italian-rock-star,
Lizzie's- suddenly-a- diva thing,

1032
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:43,769
I know all about it.

1033
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:45,175
She figured it out.

1034
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,643
Evil and smart.

1035
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:50,307
Embrace it. Fear it.

1036
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,545
You might want
to take a look at this.

1037
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,349
I'm on the front cover
of a tabloid!

1038
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:57,447
I wish to thank everyone

1039
00:50:57,524 --> 00:51:00,823
who's always believed in me
for this great honor.

1040
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:02,521
Do you know what that says?

1041
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:05,360
Paolo and lsabella
are supposed to be singing

1042
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:06,694
at the music awards.

1043
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,860
Well, it's got to be a mistake.

1044
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:11,200
I had some ltalian girls
translate it.

1045
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,636
Paolo didn't tell you?

1046
00:51:12,706 --> 00:51:13,638
Mmh, no.

1047
00:51:13,707 --> 00:51:16,471
Don't you think it's weird
he tried to hide this?

1048
00:51:16,543 --> 00:51:17,669
Can you believe it?

1049
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,507
Maybe it's a last-minute thing.

1050
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:22,446
Aren't these things planned
months in advance?

1051
00:51:22,516 --> 00:51:25,917
When did you become an expert
on ltalian award-show thingies?

1052
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:28,682
It's called common sense,
which I have a lot of

1053
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,383
to make up for my lack
of the slow curve.

1054
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,720
Slow curve?

1055
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:33,953
Forget it.

1056
00:51:34,027 --> 00:51:35,995
If you want to believe
some ltalian kid

1057
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,894
you think you know
after two days

1058
00:51:37,965 --> 00:51:39,865
because he's
an international superstar,

1059
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,731
is really rich and has
nice hair, be my guest.

1060
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:43,861
Gordo.

1061
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:54,246
Oh, my God! He's early!

1062
00:52:00,887 --> 00:52:01,979
Lizzie.

1063
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:04,023
Oh, my God,
I gotta get dressed.

1064
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:07,390
I'll cover for you in case
Miss Ungermeyer does one of her

1065
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:09,622
middle-of-the-night,
head-check things.

1066
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:10,958
Thanks. I owe you.

1067
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:12,055
Duh!

1068
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:20,565
Mom, Dad, I found something
on the Internet

1069
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,471
I think you both should see.

1070
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:23,770
What is it?

1071
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:25,573
Since Lizzie's in Europe,

1072
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:28,170
I thought I'd do
a little E- search on ltaly.

1073
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,272
That's nice, son.

1074
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,546
But what I found out,
it's not so E-assuring.

1075
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:37,245
In fact, it may shock you.

1076
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:39,422
What are we looking at?

1077
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:42,690
Maybe nothing, and, uh,
maybe something.

1078
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:45,288
You see, when polled,

1079
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:48,459
74% of ltalian teenage boys

1080
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:52,403
said they would most like
to date American girls.

1081
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:54,201
Where'd you get these numbers?

1082
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:57,107
They're available for anyone
who has a computer.

1083
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,543
You don't have to worry
about your sister.

1084
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:02,241
She's well-chaperoned.
Miss Ungermeyer's there.

1085
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:06,149
Yeah, what is she,
5'1", 5'2" max?

1086
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,918
Oh, please.

1087
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:14,222
Matt, as interesting
as this is,

1088
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:15,955
where are you taking it?

1089
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:18,589
All right, you caught me.

1090
00:53:18,665 --> 00:53:19,632
I always do.

1091
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:22,031
I don't know why I even try.

1092
00:53:24,137 --> 00:53:26,332
I'll deny
I ever said this, but...

1093
00:53:27,574 --> 00:53:29,405
...I miss my sister.

1094
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,239
There. I said it.

1095
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:33,074
Now you know.

1096
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:36,810
I know I rag on her
all the time,

1097
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:40,444
but now that she's gone,
I-I -

1098
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,148
Oh, honey, we miss her, too.

1099
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,248
So, so much.

1100
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,589
I feel so alone!

1101
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:50,255
Oh! Listen to me.

1102
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:53,788
You don't have to
make fake pie charts.

1103
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:56,665
You just come to us
with the truth, okay?

1104
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:58,795
I know that now, Mom.

1105
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:01,496
It's just so hard.

1106
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:02,769
I miss her so much!

1107
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:03,775
Oh!

1108
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:07,175
I can't believe
I let you talk me into

1109
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:10,307
Ietting her go
on that trip!

1110
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:12,078
I'll go get the passports.

1111
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:13,449
Oh, honey.

1112
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:15,718
- Shh.

1113
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:17,916
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1114
00:54:21,895 --> 00:54:24,693
Ah, hmm, ah.

1115
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,357
Hmm.

1116
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,129
Uh...

1117
00:54:29,202 --> 00:54:33,332
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmmm.

1118
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:45,309
Hmm?

1119
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:49,312
Hmm.

1120
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,447
Hmm!

1121
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,992
- Paolo.
- Si,

1122
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:05,232
What is this?

1123
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,273
Uh, a car.

1124
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:12,505
Look, are we supposed to sing?

1125
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:13,671
Scusa?

1126
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:17,279
Don't speak to me in ltalian.

1127
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,681
It's too adorable.

1128
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:23,080
Are Paolo and lsabella
supposed to sing at the awards?

1129
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,714
Si,

1130
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,055
Si?! Well,
why didn't you tell me?

1131
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:30,290
I wanted to, but you told me
not to telephone the hotel.

1132
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:33,093
Get in. I'll explain
everything on the way.

1133
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:36,397
I want to show you the
Tivoli Gardens before sunset.

1134
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:37,458
Come on.

1135
00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:39,402
We have to get you back
by 10:00.

1136
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:40,905
Okay.

1137
00:55:44,044 --> 00:55:46,569
So, where is Sergei?

1138
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:49,706
You're not the only one
who sneaks off at night.

1139
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:01,053
lsabella and I
were going to sing,

1140
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:02,890
but after lsabella
would not speak to me,

1141
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:05,329
I told the producers
we refuse to perform.

1142
00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:07,730
I said lsabella
had throat problems.

1143
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:08,961
So, what happened?

1144
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:10,366
I mean, what changed?

1145
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:11,870
Isabella did.

1146
00:56:11,938 --> 00:56:14,600
The real lsabella
or me lsabella?

1147
00:56:14,674 --> 00:56:16,835
You. A reporter
heard her speaking,

1148
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,344
and he reported
lsabella's voice was fine.

1149
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:21,437
He said her English
was very good.

1150
00:56:21,514 --> 00:56:22,913
The record company called,

1151
00:56:22,983 --> 00:56:25,611
and they're going to sue
if we don't sing.

1152
00:56:25,685 --> 00:56:27,016
What?

1153
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:29,078
So, they're
gonna make you sing?

1154
00:56:29,155 --> 00:56:30,816
I-I mean, us sing?

1155
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,085
Don't worry, carina,
I'll make this work.

1156
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:34,251
Look.

1157
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:52,600
Ah!

1158
00:56:53,713 --> 00:56:57,046
Look, Paolo, I-I don't think
this is going to work.

1159
00:56:57,117 --> 00:56:59,677
I cannot sing
in front of an audience.

1160
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:02,654
I won't even let my mom
hear me sing in the shower.

1161
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:04,849
I will teach you
all you need to know.

1162
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:06,084
Okay.

1163
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,492
So, what is lsabella gonna do
when she sees me being her?

1164
00:57:09,562 --> 00:57:13,089
She won't. She's off on some
island trying to get over this.

1165
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:15,191
Come on.

1166
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:23,869
Here's my vow to you.

1167
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:25,376
I, Paolo Valisari,

1168
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:28,380
will never let you,
Lizzie McGuire, be embarrassed.

1169
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:31,042
If I fail,
I have to spend seven days

1170
00:57:31,117 --> 00:57:33,517
with that scary
head-check woman.

1171
00:57:33,586 --> 00:57:36,817
Her name's Miss Ungermeyer.

1172
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:40,553
Carina, hasn't everything
I've promised you come to be?

1173
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,561
Everyone believes
you are lsabella.

1174
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,688
You're having
the time of your life.

1175
00:57:44,764 --> 00:57:46,698
You even told
Franca di Montecatini

1176
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:47,755
to buzz off!

1177
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:52,938
Don't you trust that we can
do the singing together?

1178
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:57,600
I guess.

1179
00:57:57,677 --> 00:57:58,837
Well, you shouldn't.

1180
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:08,316
Hmmm-mmmm

1181
00:58:08,388 --> 00:58:10,618
Ohhh

1182
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,523
Ye-e-e-ah

1183
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:18,155
You've been searching the
world to find true love

1184
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:21,723
Looking in all
the wrong places

1185
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:25,862
When all of the time,
you've been blind to love

1186
00:58:25,939 --> 00:58:29,602
It's plain as the nose
on your face is

1187
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:31,667
It's here

1188
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:34,009
It's now

1189
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,345
Open your eyes and see it

1190
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:39,544
Right here

1191
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:40,608
Right now

1192
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:41,847
Ohh

1193
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:44,389
This is so beautiful.

1194
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:45,947
Yes, you are.

1195
00:58:46,025 --> 00:58:47,253
Ohhhh

1196
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:51,093
Love has been
right by your side

1197
00:58:51,164 --> 00:58:55,624
Oh, so close,
that you couldn't see

1198
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:59,604
If love could speak,
it would shout to the sky

1199
00:58:59,672 --> 00:59:04,166
"I've always been here,
I always will be"

1200
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:05,734
Wow!

1201
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:07,177
I'm here

1202
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:08,179
I'm here

1203
00:59:08,248 --> 00:59:09,272
I'm now

1204
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:10,475
I'm now

1205
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:14,042
Open your eyes and see

1206
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,315
Right here

1207
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:18,584
Right now

1208
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:24,961
Open your eyes to love

1209
00:59:25,031 --> 00:59:27,261
Open your heart

1210
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:31,326
To love

1211
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:49,478
Hey.

1212
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:51,456
What do you got there,
little man?

1213
00:59:51,524 --> 00:59:53,219
- Uh, nothing.
- What's this?

1214
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:54,817
Uh, that's not Lizzie!
No!

1215
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,419
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1216
00:59:56,496 --> 00:59:59,056
I know my daughter.
I gave her that necklace.

1217
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:01,965
All right, tell me
what you know that I don't.

1218
01:00:02,035 --> 01:00:05,266
It's only
a 14-hour flight, Dad.

1219
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,243
Swallow those biscotti.

1220
01:00:12,312 --> 01:00:15,179
We got a big day.
The Pantheon, the Colosseum.

1221
01:00:15,248 --> 01:00:16,180
Oh.

1222
01:00:16,249 --> 01:00:17,773
Uh, halt!

1223
01:00:17,851 --> 01:00:20,285
Got to get these apricots
to McGuire.

1224
01:00:20,353 --> 01:00:22,878
She looked sick as a dog
this morning.

1225
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:25,788
Mr. Gordon,
you having a problem?

1226
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:27,087
N-No, I just...

1227
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,094
I'm starting to agree
with Ethan.

1228
01:00:29,162 --> 01:00:31,687
- We need to eat more spaghetti.
- You da man!

1229
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,858
Sorry.

1230
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:38,063
Is there a reason you
don't want me to go upstairs?

1231
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:40,902
No, I-I just really think
we should get going.

1232
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:44,102
Uh, so much Roma,
so little time-a.

1233
01:00:44,177 --> 01:00:46,202
Well, when I get upstairs -

1234
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:49,180
and I will get upstairs -

1235
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:51,877
I expect to find Miss McGuire
in her bed.

1236
01:00:53,186 --> 01:00:56,121
She may be in the bathroom
or - or something.

1237
01:00:56,189 --> 01:00:58,180
I'm beginning
to get the feeling

1238
01:00:58,258 --> 01:01:01,056
she was never sick
to begin with.

1239
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:02,719
No, no, no!
She - She was!

1240
01:01:02,796 --> 01:01:05,060
I bet this whole thing
was just a clever ruse

1241
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:08,066
to sneak out of this hotel,
wasn't it?

1242
01:01:09,302 --> 01:01:11,236
Yeah, it - it was.

1243
01:01:11,304 --> 01:01:12,601
It was?

1244
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:16,233
Well, Lizzie and I were
talking about adventures,

1245
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:17,401
and I don't know.

1246
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:19,069
Ah, spit it out, Gordon.

1247
01:01:19,145 --> 01:01:21,739
Lizzie's upstairs.
It - It's me.

1248
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:23,806
I'm the one
who's been sneaking out.

1249
01:01:23,883 --> 01:01:25,748
- You?
- But - But -

1250
01:01:26,553 --> 01:01:29,386
Feels good
to get it off my chest.

1251
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:32,190
You realize
what this means?

1252
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:37,186
I shouldn't look to you
for a college recommendation?

1253
01:01:37,263 --> 01:01:40,164
You should look
for your suitcase, Gordon.

1254
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:41,495
You're goin' home.

1255
01:01:41,568 --> 01:01:44,503
Oh, I pegged you
right from the start.

1256
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:45,799
David Gordon.

1257
01:01:45,872 --> 01:01:48,864
Sneaky little brownnoser
with a hidden agenda.

1258
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,707
Well, you're busted.

1259
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:58,946
Love lifts us up
where we belong.

1260
01:02:09,696 --> 01:02:12,392
Wow.
This place is so cool.

1261
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:13,625
Si,

1262
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,634
Are you sure it's okay
we're here?

1263
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:16,669
Si,

1264
01:02:16,736 --> 01:02:19,000
And here is where, exactly?

1265
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:20,471
It's the rehearsal hall.

1266
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,134
But the Colosseum
will look more like this.

1267
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:24,267
Sergei!

1268
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:32,683
If you want to convince
the world you're lsabella,

1269
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:34,117
you must take the stage.

1270
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:35,279
You must dance...

1271
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,391
...and sing.

1272
01:02:43,129 --> 01:02:48,965
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1273
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:51,060
Just move your mouth
with the words.

1274
01:02:51,137 --> 01:02:53,401
Oh. So you want me
to lip-synch.

1275
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:54,599
- Si,

1276
01:02:54,674 --> 01:02:55,834
Just like lsabella.

1277
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:57,570
You know the song, right?

1278
01:02:57,644 --> 01:03:01,045
Uh, well, yeah.
I mean, I have your CD, but...

1279
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:03,048
So try it.

1280
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:04,674
I'm not gonna try it.

1281
01:03:09,522 --> 01:03:11,717
- Okay.

1282
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:18,955
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1283
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:28,196
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1284
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:33,302
Was it awful?

1285
01:03:33,379 --> 01:03:35,609
- Uh, yes.

1286
01:03:35,682 --> 01:03:37,115
But it helps to sing.

1287
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:39,117
Really - really sing?

1288
01:03:39,185 --> 01:03:41,653
It looks more real
when you're lip-synching.

1289
01:03:41,721 --> 01:03:44,588
- You weren't singing.
- But I won't be lip-synching.

1290
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:47,785
No one's going to hear you.
The microphone will be off.

1291
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:49,123
You must try.

1292
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:51,121
Please?

1293
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:53,924
Okay.

1294
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:06,369
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1295
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:15,316
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1296
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:19,925
When I see you smiling

1297
01:04:19,993 --> 01:04:24,487
I go, "Oh, oh, oh"

1298
01:04:25,698 --> 01:04:30,135
I would never want
to miss this

1299
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:35,937
'Cause in my heart
I know what this is

1300
01:04:36,943 --> 01:04:42,779
This is what dreams
are made of

1301
01:04:45,151 --> 01:04:47,119
This is what

1302
01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:49,951
Dreams are made of

1303
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:51,251
I've got

1304
01:04:51,324 --> 01:04:54,191
Somewhere I belong

1305
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,522
I've got

1306
01:04:55,595 --> 01:04:58,359
Somebody to love

1307
01:04:58,431 --> 01:04:59,398
This is what

1308
01:04:59,465 --> 01:05:03,231
Dreams

1309
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:07,763
Are made of

1310
01:05:11,444 --> 01:05:13,036
Brava.

1311
01:05:13,112 --> 01:05:14,977
And now we dance!

1312
01:05:21,854 --> 01:05:22,843
Hey!

1313
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:30,819
Hey!

1314
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:38,428
Hey!

1315
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:50,006
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1316
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:53,048
Hey!

1317
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,450
Hey!

1318
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,612
Hey!

1319
01:05:55,688 --> 01:05:58,384
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1320
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:22,046
Hey!

1321
01:06:22,115 --> 01:06:24,913
I'm glad you're up.
I had the most amazing night.

1322
01:06:24,985 --> 01:06:27,681
I'm gonna grab Gordo
so I can tell you together.

1323
01:06:27,754 --> 01:06:28,948
You won't find him.

1324
01:06:29,022 --> 01:06:30,751
What?

1325
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,121
Why? Where'd he go?

1326
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:35,093
Probably getting on a plane
right now.

1327
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:36,254
Why?

1328
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:37,819
He totally covered for you

1329
01:06:37,898 --> 01:06:39,957
and got himself
kicked off the trip.

1330
01:06:40,033 --> 01:06:42,126
I-I don't believe it.

1331
01:06:42,202 --> 01:06:43,965
W-Why would he do that?

1332
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:46,938
You're seriously asking
that question?

1333
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,916
Call the airline and see
if Gordo's plane has left!

1334
01:06:56,983 --> 01:06:59,508
- Do you know what flight?
- Si, si,

1335
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:01,110
I will call.

1336
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,590
I cannot believe Gordo
would do this for me.

1337
01:07:04,658 --> 01:07:06,319
Maybe he's not
on the plane yet.

1338
01:07:06,393 --> 01:07:08,725
Maybe I could go
to the airport and...

1339
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:10,126
And what?

1340
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:13,393
I don't know.

1341
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,060
I am now on hold.

1342
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:19,902
This is the final call
for Lufthansa Flight 6240,

1343
01:07:19,973 --> 01:07:23,431
departing for Los Angeles.

1344
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:30,849
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1345
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:36,981
Mm-hmm.

1346
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:39,821
Mm-hmm.

1347
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,793
Mm-hmm.

1348
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:42,920
Mm-hmm.

1349
01:07:42,996 --> 01:07:44,861
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:46,922
Mm-hmm.

1351
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,662
Thank you very nice.

1352
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:51,169
The plane is gone.

1353
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:26,033
Who is this girl?

1354
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:27,869
I have been on the island,

1355
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,466
trying to forget
about this whole situation.

1356
01:08:30,544 --> 01:08:32,808
Can somebody tell me
what is going on?

1357
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:35,677
I can. That's my friend
Lizzie McGuire.

1358
01:08:38,585 --> 01:08:39,847
Let him go.
Let him go.

1359
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,286
I demand you tell me
everything you know

1360
01:08:42,355 --> 01:08:43,515
about Lizzie McGuire.

1361
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:48,050
I demand you tell me everything
about Paolo Valisari.

1362
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:51,120
I left him and all thoughts
about him on the island.

1363
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:53,189
You may have left him
on the island,

1364
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:55,393
but Lizzie is out there
pretending to be you

1365
01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:57,095
so you don't get sued.

1366
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:00,940
We need to talk in private.

1367
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:05,339
Gordo's life is ruined
because of me.

1368
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:07,175
Selfish me!

1369
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:08,714
What are you gonna do now?

1370
01:09:08,782 --> 01:09:10,545
It's over.

1371
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:13,347
I'm going to turn myself in
to Miss Ungermeyer.

1372
01:09:14,955 --> 01:09:16,718
Lizzie, you'll get sent home,

1373
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,781
and you won't be able
to help Paolo.

1374
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,451
I'm never going to be able

1375
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:23,018
to get through this
the way I feel now.

1376
01:09:23,096 --> 01:09:24,859
Okay. Fine. Quit.

1377
01:09:24,931 --> 01:09:27,957
But then everything Gordo did
will be for nothing.

1378
01:09:30,871 --> 01:09:35,638
Now, you know things are bad
when Kate starts making sense.

1379
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:37,301
I know one thing's for sure.

1380
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:38,469
What?

1381
01:09:38,545 --> 01:09:40,775
I'm not gonna have to
act sick today.

1382
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,813
Mr. Craft, you are in
the most historic

1383
01:10:16,883 --> 01:10:19,078
and beautiful city
in the world.

1384
01:10:19,152 --> 01:10:20,983
Has it had no effect on you?

1385
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:22,351
Well, actually, it has.

1386
01:10:22,422 --> 01:10:24,720
The cobblestones
are shredding my wheels.

1387
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:27,316
Switched to a pair
of birdhouse pterodactyls.

1388
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:30,761
Have you even made a dent
in your reading list?

1389
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,320
I finished it.

1390
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,162
You read 11 books?

1391
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,429
I mean I read the list.

1392
01:10:45,145 --> 01:10:46,442
Shh.

1393
01:10:48,882 --> 01:10:50,281
Shh.

1394
01:10:52,285 --> 01:10:53,718
McGuire.

1395
01:10:53,787 --> 01:10:55,550
Lizzie McGuire.

1396
01:10:55,622 --> 01:10:58,682
Si, si, we are in
the travel guides.

1397
01:10:58,758 --> 01:11:00,020
No. No.

1398
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:01,583
No.

1399
01:11:02,629 --> 01:11:05,564
We're the parents of Lizzie.

1400
01:11:05,632 --> 01:11:06,894
Ah! Si!

1401
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:12,400
I'll call a cab.
It's very far.

1402
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:14,838
Anybody else want to step up
to the plate?

1403
01:11:14,908 --> 01:11:17,172
Who's asking for McGuire?

1404
01:11:17,243 --> 01:11:19,234
I had left you
four messages already,

1405
01:11:19,312 --> 01:11:22,713
but she's been under
my watchful eye all the while.

1406
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:24,716
Where'd Sanders go?

1407
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:27,309
Lizzie? Sweetheart?

1408
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:29,252
Honey?

1409
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:31,913
Cool!

1410
01:11:36,096 --> 01:11:37,290
Where is Lizzie?

1411
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:39,332
Do you have
any embarrassing photos

1412
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:41,526
or videos of her
while she's been here?

1413
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:42,795
Ow.

1414
01:11:42,869 --> 01:11:43,836
Uh...

1415
01:11:43,903 --> 01:11:47,304
Tell us where Lizzie is,
or this deck's gonna catch air.

1416
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:50,741
It's possible she's at the
International Music Video Awards

1417
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:54,109
doubling for pop star lsabella,
who's totally her twin.

1418
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:58,448
Why does everyone
always look at me like that?

1419
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:07,255
When you wish upon a star

1420
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:09,887
Your dreams will take you
very far

1421
01:12:11,765 --> 01:12:14,734
Once you see your light
so clear

1422
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:21,131
In the sky so very dear

1423
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:23,198
You're a shining star

1424
01:12:23,276 --> 01:12:25,870
No matter who you are

1425
01:12:25,945 --> 01:12:28,277
Shining bright to see

1426
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:30,111
What you can truly be

1427
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:34,111
Prince William?

1428
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:36,781
Tell him he'll have to hold.

1429
01:12:44,564 --> 01:12:45,656
Ooh!

1430
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:47,324
- Oh.

1431
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:54,766
Shine its watchful light
on you

1432
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:56,741
Hey, Paolo!

1433
01:13:01,314 --> 01:13:04,613
Words of wisdom,
yes, I can

1434
01:13:05,852 --> 01:13:07,945
You're a shining star

1435
01:13:08,021 --> 01:13:10,546
No matter who you are

1436
01:13:10,623 --> 01:13:12,716
Shining bright to see

1437
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,919
What you can truly be

1438
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:26,238
Si,

1439
01:13:26,306 --> 01:13:27,068
What?

1440
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:29,267
He said for you to enter
from here, stage right,

1441
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:32,368
and I must enter
from stage left.

1442
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:35,107
What about my dress?
I have to get dressed.

1443
01:13:35,181 --> 01:13:36,808
It's in your dressing room.

1444
01:13:36,883 --> 01:13:39,181
Lizzie, you have time.

1445
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:40,913
Calm down.
You can do it.

1446
01:13:41,921 --> 01:13:43,752
Of course I can do it.

1447
01:13:44,757 --> 01:13:47,021
This is moi
we're talking about.

1448
01:13:47,093 --> 01:13:48,856
I don't think I can do it.

1449
01:13:48,928 --> 01:13:50,361
Lizzie, you must.

1450
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:53,422
We've rehearsed this.
You know the steps, the words.

1451
01:13:53,533 --> 01:13:56,127
You will be great.
I know.

1452
01:13:56,202 --> 01:13:57,499
How do you know?

1453
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,765
Because.

1454
01:13:59,839 --> 01:14:02,569
Because you shine
like the light from the sun.

1455
01:14:08,214 --> 01:14:10,182
Paolo. Paolo.

1456
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,413
31 minutes till showtime.

1457
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:16,754
Lizzie.

1458
01:14:16,823 --> 01:14:19,087
Gordo!
What are you doing here?!

1459
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:21,855
Lizzie, that's
not important right now.

1460
01:14:21,928 --> 01:14:23,555
You need to listen to me.

1461
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:27,066
I feel so bad. I cannot believe
you would do that for me.

1462
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:29,033
- Why aren't you gone?
- Long story.

1463
01:14:29,102 --> 01:14:32,094
I want to hear it, but
I've got to get my dress on.

1464
01:14:32,172 --> 01:14:33,104
Listen to me.

1465
01:14:33,173 --> 01:14:35,403
Paolo is setting you up.

1466
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:38,372
What are you talking about?

1467
01:14:38,444 --> 01:14:41,038
Actually, he is setting me up.

1468
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:48,645
Freaky, huh?

1469
01:14:48,721 --> 01:14:50,552
Way freaky.

1470
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:52,921
Way, way freaky.

1471
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:55,825
That whole story
about Paolo doing his own music

1472
01:14:55,895 --> 01:14:57,123
and going solo.

1473
01:14:57,197 --> 01:14:58,528
That's lsabella.

1474
01:14:58,598 --> 01:15:00,361
She's the one that sings live.

1475
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:03,231
Paolo is the one
that lip-synchs, not me.

1476
01:15:03,303 --> 01:15:05,533
Isabella wants to quit the act.

1477
01:15:05,605 --> 01:15:06,902
Paolo is just a liar.

1478
01:15:06,973 --> 01:15:09,441
This has all been some scheme
to set you up

1479
01:15:09,509 --> 01:15:10,908
and embarrass you onstage

1480
01:15:10,977 --> 01:15:13,036
so it looks
like lsabella can't sing.

1481
01:15:13,112 --> 01:15:14,602
Si, si, It's true.

1482
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,047
Paolo wants to destroy
lsabella's career.

1483
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:22,079
But Paolo would never
do that to me.

1484
01:15:22,155 --> 01:15:23,417
I don't believe you.

1485
01:15:25,024 --> 01:15:26,457
Isabella...

1486
01:15:30,463 --> 01:15:32,954
Lizzie, who are you
going to believe,

1487
01:15:33,032 --> 01:15:35,262
this boy you are knowing
your whole life

1488
01:15:35,335 --> 01:15:39,294
or this boy you are
just meeting who says,

1489
01:15:39,372 --> 01:15:41,670
"You shine with the light
from the sun"?

1490
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:18,400
Okay. Well, then, you're here
now, so go and sing.

1491
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:21,413
But I am not blond.
Paolo will know that it's me,

1492
01:16:21,481 --> 01:16:23,608
and he'll make an excuse
to leave.

1493
01:16:23,683 --> 01:16:25,674
But if we want to
get back at him

1494
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:28,016
in front of the whole world
on live TV,

1495
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:29,349
we must make him sing.

1496
01:16:29,422 --> 01:16:31,390
And really sing, not lip-synch.

1497
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:33,152
How? What am I
supposed to do?

1498
01:16:33,226 --> 01:16:36,286
- I can't sing live!

1499
01:16:36,362 --> 01:16:37,920
Change! Change!

1500
01:16:37,997 --> 01:16:39,055
Change your clothes

1501
01:16:39,132 --> 01:16:41,464
and go up there and do
what you rehearsed.

1502
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:43,661
Everything will be fine,
I-I promise.

1503
01:16:43,736 --> 01:16:45,636
- I have a plan.
- What plan?

1504
01:16:45,705 --> 01:16:47,434
28 minutes till showtime.

1505
01:16:47,507 --> 01:16:49,441
So, what's the plan?

1506
01:16:49,509 --> 01:16:50,737
I don't know.

1507
01:16:52,312 --> 01:16:54,872
No, see, it doesn't matter
about the tickets,

1508
01:16:54,947 --> 01:16:57,279
because my daughter
is back there

1509
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:59,113
impersonating
a famous pop star,

1510
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,447
so I got to get in!

1511
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,010
That's what everyone says.

1512
01:17:02,088 --> 01:17:03,020
Enough of this!

1513
01:17:07,093 --> 01:17:08,185
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

1514
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:09,694
Let's go!

1515
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:15,525
Did Paolo bring
the voice track for me?

1516
01:17:15,601 --> 01:17:18,069
No. No, he did not.
There is no track.

1517
01:17:18,137 --> 01:17:21,231
Paolo says you're gonna sing
live, like you always do.

1518
01:17:22,975 --> 01:17:26,172
Paolo and lsabella!

1519
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,690
Sandro, turn down
lsabella's mike.

1520
01:17:39,759 --> 01:17:41,693
- What's that?
- Turn down the mike!

1521
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:57,266
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1522
01:17:59,712 --> 01:18:05,309
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1523
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:11,887
When I see you smiling,
I go

1524
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:14,791
"Oh, oh, oh"

1525
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:20,391
I would never want
to miss this

1526
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,457
'Cause in my heart

1527
01:18:22,535 --> 01:18:24,628
I know what this is

1528
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:32,978
This is what dreams
are made of

1529
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:34,842
Sing to me, Paolo.

1530
01:18:36,249 --> 01:18:41,186
This is
what dreams are made of

1531
01:18:59,272 --> 01:19:01,001
Okay.

1532
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:06,273
Say buonasera to my new American
friend, Lizzie McGuire!

1533
01:19:07,713 --> 01:19:09,840
Paolo tried to use her
to fool all of you

1534
01:19:09,916 --> 01:19:11,713
into thinking I could not sing.

1535
01:19:11,784 --> 01:19:14,480
Lizzie McGuire is nice girl.
You try to hurt her.

1536
01:19:14,554 --> 01:19:16,681
Let me go, Sergei.
You work for me.

1537
01:19:16,756 --> 01:19:18,883
Not anymore, Paolo.
I quit.

1538
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:19,890
Paolo!

1539
01:19:21,194 --> 01:19:25,221
Paolo cannot sing music.
Now he must face music.

1540
01:19:25,298 --> 01:19:27,698
- Was it all a lie?
- No, it's just...

1541
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:30,861
- Do you want to hear us sing?

1542
01:19:41,047 --> 01:19:46,485
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1543
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:54,523
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1544
01:19:55,895 --> 01:20:00,229
When I see you smiling,
I go

1545
01:20:00,299 --> 01:20:03,427
"Oh, oh, oh"

1546
01:20:03,503 --> 01:20:07,940
I would never want
to miss this

1547
01:20:08,007 --> 01:20:11,408
'Cause in my heart
I know what this is

1548
01:20:11,477 --> 01:20:12,603
Hey, now

1549
01:20:12,678 --> 01:20:14,111
Hey, now

1550
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:18,947
This is what dreams
are made of

1551
01:20:19,018 --> 01:20:20,110
Hey, now

1552
01:20:20,186 --> 01:20:21,517
Hey, now

1553
01:20:21,587 --> 01:20:25,546
This is what dreams
are made of

1554
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:29,288
I've got
somewhere I belong

1555
01:20:29,362 --> 01:20:33,059
I've got
somebody to love

1556
01:20:33,132 --> 01:20:36,898
This is what dre-e-e-ams

1557
01:20:36,969 --> 01:20:39,597
Are made of

1558
01:20:41,507 --> 01:20:42,974
Wait! Isabella!

1559
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:44,236
Go! Si!

1560
01:20:46,612 --> 01:20:47,772
Lizzie!

1561
01:20:50,883 --> 01:20:52,748
Ru-u-u-u-n!

1562
01:20:59,492 --> 01:21:01,687
Hey, hey, hey!

1563
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:07,427
Have you ever wondered
what life is about?

1564
01:21:09,602 --> 01:21:15,097
You could search the world
and never figure it out

1565
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:20,504
You don't have to sail
the oceans

1566
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,344
No, no, no

1567
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,344
Happiness is no mystery

1568
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,752
It's here and now

1569
01:21:29,822 --> 01:21:32,450
It's you and me, yeah

1570
01:21:34,193 --> 01:21:36,593
Hey, now, hey, now

01:21:36,662 --> 01:21:40,689

I've got somebody to love

01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:59,147
This is what dre-e-e-ams

Are made of

1578
01:22:01,287 --> 01:22:02,811
Hey, now

01:22:02,888 --> 01:22:06,221
This is what dreams

01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:07,850
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, now

01:22:08,995 --> 01:22:10,826
Hey, now

01:22:10,896 --> 01:22:14,992
This is what dreams
are made of

1584
01:22:15,768 --> 01:22:18,168
Open your eyes

1585
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:22,230
This is what dreams
are made of

1586
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:25,602
Shout to the skies

1587
01:22:25,678 --> 01:22:28,203
This is what dreams
are made of

1588
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,305
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1589
01:22:30,383 --> 01:22:32,442
Then I see you smile

1590
01:22:32,518 --> 01:22:37,046
And I go, "Oh, oh, oh"

1591
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:41,748
Yesterday
my life was duller

1592
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:45,593
Now everything
is technicolor

1593
01:22:49,402 --> 01:22:51,666
Hey, now, hey, now

1594
01:22:51,737 --> 01:22:55,673
This is what dreams

01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,535
Hey, now, hey, now

1596
01:22:59,578 --> 01:23:03,674
This is what dreams
are made of

1597
01:23:03,749 --> 01:23:06,980
I've got somewhere I belong

1598
01:23:07,053 --> 01:23:11,149
I've got somebody to love

1599
01:23:11,223 --> 01:23:15,717
This is what dre-e-e-ams

1600
01:23:15,795 --> 01:23:18,855
Dre-e-e-ams

1601
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:22,423
This is what dre-e-e-ams

1602
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:23,593
Are made of

1603
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:25,102
Hey, now, hey, now

1604
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:27,139
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, now, hey, now

01:23:32,978 --> 01:23:35,139
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1609
01:23:35,214 --> 01:23:36,647
Hey, now, hey, now

1610
01:23:36,716 --> 01:23:38,616
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1611
01:23:38,684 --> 01:23:39,708
Hey!

1612
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:40,845
Lizzie got everything
you're supposed to get

1613
01:24:40,913 --> 01:24:42,471
when you go to Europe.

1614
01:24:42,548 --> 01:24:44,982
Adventure, romance,
total confidence.

1615
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,176
Yeah?

1616
01:24:46,251 --> 01:24:50,017
Well, if all that can happen
to Lizzie McGuire,

1617
01:24:50,088 --> 01:24:54,218
the only thing I know now is
I don't know anything.

1618
01:24:54,293 --> 01:24:55,885
That's hot.

1619
01:24:55,961 --> 01:24:57,428
What?

1620
01:24:57,496 --> 01:25:00,897
Girls who think they know
everything are just a turnoff.

1621
01:25:02,334 --> 01:25:03,460
Really?

1622
01:25:03,535 --> 01:25:05,059
Oh, totally.

1623
01:25:05,137 --> 01:25:07,332
What about you
not ratting out Lizzie?

1624
01:25:07,406 --> 01:25:11,467
I mean,
that was just so...

1625
01:25:11,543 --> 01:25:12,874
not you.

1626
01:25:27,392 --> 01:25:28,586
That's good.

1627
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:29,592
Si,

1628
01:25:29,661 --> 01:25:31,492
Aaaaaaah!

1629
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,966
Mom, Dad, I'm so glad
that you guys made it.

1630
01:25:37,035 --> 01:25:38,696
You would have never
believed me.

1631
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:39,759
That is for sure.

1632
01:25:39,838 --> 01:25:43,296
I thought after you found out
all I did, I would be grounded.

1633
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:46,208
You're grounded for the rest
of the summer, sweetheart,

1634
01:25:46,278 --> 01:25:48,212
but we're really proud of you.

1635
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,810
Lying, even for a good reason,
is beneath you, Gordon.

1636
01:25:54,887 --> 01:25:56,320
Yeah. I know. I know.

1637
01:25:56,388 --> 01:25:59,255
I'm a lying, spineless,
brownnosing jellyfish

1638
01:25:59,324 --> 01:26:00,552
with a hidden agenda.

1639
01:26:00,626 --> 01:26:01,593
I got it.

1640
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,254
That may be true,
but I'll tell you something.

1641
01:26:04,329 --> 01:26:06,354
Little Miss Diva
told me everything.

1642
01:26:06,465 --> 01:26:09,866
The way I see it, you're
a pretty loyal friend, Gordon.

1643
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:12,927
And loyalty goes a long way
with the Ungermeyer.

1644
01:26:13,005 --> 01:26:14,097
- Hmm?
- Thanks.

1645
01:26:19,211 --> 01:26:20,701
Hey, just think about it.

1646
01:26:20,779 --> 01:26:24,078
We got 4 years of high school
to look forward to together.

1647
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:25,446
Ooh. Sammies.

1648
01:26:27,686 --> 01:26:29,119
Sergei is hungry.

1649
01:26:29,187 --> 01:26:31,519
So is Miss Ungermeyer.

1650
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,494
You are strong woman.

1651
01:26:36,562 --> 01:26:39,656
You protect cubs like lioness.

1652
01:26:39,731 --> 01:26:41,426
Sergei is impressed.

1653
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,765
Hmm. You're still on my list.

1654
01:26:44,836 --> 01:26:46,861
As long as I am at the top.

1655
01:26:49,341 --> 01:26:50,933
Hey, there!

1656
01:26:51,009 --> 01:26:54,137
I bet you're wondering,
who is this Lizzie McGuire,

1657
01:26:54,212 --> 01:26:55,543
where did she come from,

1658
01:26:55,614 --> 01:26:58,242
and what are her
most embarrassing moments?

1659
01:26:58,317 --> 01:27:02,777
Well, I can give you
total access to all of that

1660
01:27:02,854 --> 01:27:05,448
for a very competitive price.

1661
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:07,424
Hmm. When in Rome...

1662
01:27:07,492 --> 01:27:10,017
Yeah, yeah.
Do as the Romans do, right?

1663
01:27:10,095 --> 01:27:11,027
No.

1664
01:27:11,096 --> 01:27:13,826
We do not blackmail
our sisters.

1665
01:27:13,899 --> 01:27:16,459
As a former commander
in the ltalian Navy,

1666
01:27:16,535 --> 01:27:19,698
I am ordering you
to leave the country.

1667
01:27:19,771 --> 01:27:20,760
No!

1668
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,911
Hey.

1669
01:27:32,618 --> 01:27:37,055
So, one last sneak-away
for old times' sake?

1670
01:27:37,122 --> 01:27:38,555
Yeah. Sounds good.

1671
01:27:38,624 --> 01:27:40,558
Okay.

1672
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:43,493
Aha.

1673
01:27:43,562 --> 01:27:45,655
No!

1674
01:27:51,903 --> 01:27:53,996
So, are you gonna miss it here?

1675
01:27:54,072 --> 01:27:55,164
I don't know.

1676
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,368
Kate says I should stay
and have my stuff shipped over,

1677
01:27:58,443 --> 01:28:01,037
because when I leave,
it'll never be the same.

1678
01:28:01,112 --> 01:28:02,409
She's wrong, as usual.

1679
01:28:02,481 --> 01:28:05,314
You didn't have to be in Rome
for all this to happen.

1680
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:06,941
You think?

1681
01:28:07,018 --> 01:28:08,349
Trust me.

1682
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,513
You had it in you
the whole time.

1683
01:28:15,026 --> 01:28:16,960
Gordo?

1684
01:28:17,028 --> 01:28:18,518
What?

1685
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,562
Thanks.

1686
01:28:26,638 --> 01:28:28,799
You're welcome.

1687
01:28:32,511 --> 01:28:33,443
Yeah.

1688
01:28:33,512 --> 01:28:36,413
So, um, want to get back
to that party

1689
01:28:36,481 --> 01:28:38,472
so we don't get
in any more trouble?

1690
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,780
Yeah. I can't afford
any more trouble.

1691
01:28:40,852 --> 01:28:42,012
Yeah.

1692
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:21,782
Why not?

1693
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:23,623
Think you're goin' nowhere

1694
01:29:23,695 --> 01:29:25,993
When you're walkin'
down the street

1695
01:29:26,064 --> 01:29:28,055
Acting like
you just don't care

1696
01:29:28,133 --> 01:29:29,828
When life can be so sweet

1697
01:29:29,901 --> 01:29:32,028
But why you want to be
like that

1698
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:33,866
As if there's nothing new?

1699
01:29:33,939 --> 01:29:35,634
You're not foolin' no one

1700
01:29:35,707 --> 01:29:37,800
You're not even foolin' you

1701
01:29:37,876 --> 01:29:41,869
So walk a little slower
and open up your eyes

1702
01:29:41,947 --> 01:29:46,043
Sometimes it's so hard to see
the good things passin' by

1703
01:29:46,117 --> 01:29:49,883
And there may never be a
sign, no flashing neon light

1704
01:29:49,955 --> 01:29:53,982
Telling you to make your move
when the time is right

1705
01:29:54,059 --> 01:29:56,254
Why not

1706
01:29:56,328 --> 01:29:58,091
Take a crazy chance?

1707
01:29:58,163 --> 01:30:00,290
Why not

1708
01:30:00,365 --> 01:30:02,128
Do a crazy dance?

1709
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,966
If you lose the moment,
you might lose a lot

1710
01:30:06,037 --> 01:30:08,301
So why not?

1711
01:30:08,373 --> 01:30:10,307
Why not?

1712
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:14,368
Oh, I could be
the one for you

1713
01:30:14,446 --> 01:30:18,382
Oh, yeah,
maybe yes, maybe no

1714
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:22,716
Oh, it could be
the thing to do

1715
01:30:22,787 --> 01:30:26,883
What I'm sayin' is you got to
let me know, oh, oh

1716
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,220
Ah, ah, yeah

1717
01:30:28,293 --> 01:30:29,726
Ah, ah, ah

1718
01:30:29,794 --> 01:30:33,025
Yeah, yeah

1719
01:30:34,633 --> 01:30:36,396
Ah, ah, ah, yeah

1720
01:30:36,468 --> 01:30:37,560
Ah, yeah

1721
01:30:37,636 --> 01:30:40,969
Ah, yeah, yeah

1722
01:30:42,474 --> 01:30:46,410
You'll never get to heaven
or even to L,A,

1723
01:30:46,478 --> 01:30:50,744
If you don't believe
there's a way

1724
01:30:50,815 --> 01:30:52,749
Why not

1725
01:30:52,817 --> 01:30:54,751
Take a star from the sky?

1726
01:30:54,819 --> 01:30:56,810
Why not

1727
01:30:56,888 --> 01:30:58,822
Spread your wings and fly?

1728
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:02,553
It might take a little,
and it might take a lot

1729
01:31:02,627 --> 01:31:04,720
But why not?

1730
01:31:04,796 --> 01:31:06,730
Why not?

1731
01:31:06,798 --> 01:31:09,062
Why not

1732
01:31:09,134 --> 01:31:10,726
Take a crazy chance?

1733
01:31:10,802 --> 01:31:12,861
Why not

1734
01:31:12,937 --> 01:31:14,700
Do a crazy dance?

1735
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:18,675
If you lose the moment,
you might lose a lot

1736
01:31:18,743 --> 01:31:21,007
So why not?

1737
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:23,411
Why not?

1738
01:31:27,852 --> 01:31:31,481
Hmmmmmm, mmmm, mmmm

1739
01:31:32,824 --> 01:31:37,557
Ohhhhh, yeah

1740
01:31:37,629 --> 01:31:39,722
You've been searching
the world

1741
01:31:39,798 --> 01:31:41,891
To find true love

1742
01:31:41,966 --> 01:31:45,902
Looking in all
the wrong places

1743
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:49,906
When all of the time,
you've been blind to love

1744
01:31:49,974 --> 01:31:53,740
It's plain as the nose
on your face is

1745
01:31:53,812 --> 01:31:58,078
It's here, it's now

1746
01:31:58,149 --> 01:32:01,585
Open your eyes and see it

1747
01:32:01,653 --> 01:32:06,090
Right here, right now

1748
01:32:06,157 --> 01:32:11,823
Open your eyes to love

1749
01:32:11,896 --> 01:32:15,889
You've been down on yourself,
thinking something's wrong

1750
01:32:15,967 --> 01:32:19,596
Wondering why love
has never found you

1751
01:32:19,671 --> 01:32:23,767
Don't you know it's been
right here all along

1752
01:32:23,842 --> 01:32:27,676
If only you'd look
around you?

1753
01:32:27,746 --> 01:32:29,771
It's here

1754
01:32:29,848 --> 01:32:32,112
It's now

1755
01:32:32,183 --> 01:32:35,619
Open your eyes and see it

1756
01:32:35,687 --> 01:32:37,814
Right here

1757
01:32:37,889 --> 01:32:38,913
Right now

1758
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,287
Right now

1759
01:32:40,358 --> 01:32:45,455
Open your eyes to love

1760
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:49,125
Love has been
right by your side

1761
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:53,637
Oh, so close
that you couldn't see

1762
01:32:53,705 --> 01:32:57,801
If love could speak,
it would shout to the sky

1763
01:32:57,876 --> 01:32:59,969
"I've always been here

1764
01:33:00,044 --> 01:33:03,810
I always will be"

1765
01:33:03,882 --> 01:33:06,077
I'm here

1766
01:33:06,151 --> 01:33:07,413
I'm now

1767
01:33:07,552 --> 01:33:08,484
I'm now

1768
01:33:08,553 --> 01:33:12,148
Open your eyes and see me

1769
01:33:12,223 --> 01:33:13,281
Right here

1770
01:33:13,358 --> 01:33:14,347
Right here

1771
01:33:14,425 --> 01:33:15,619
Right now

1772
01:33:15,693 --> 01:33:16,819
Right now

1773
01:33:16,895 --> 01:33:21,730
Open your eyes to love

1774
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:27,270
Open your mind to love

1775
01:33:29,073 --> 01:33:36,172
Open your heart to love

1776
01:33:36,247 --> 01:33:42,652
Ooh, ooh, ooh
