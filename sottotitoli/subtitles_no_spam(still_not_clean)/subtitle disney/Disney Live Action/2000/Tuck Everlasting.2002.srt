1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,646
(whistling wistful melody)

2
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,138
(bird hoots)

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,583
(clock ticking)

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,213
(water gurgling)

5
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,986
(hooves clomping)

6
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:29,483
(thunder rumbling)

7
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,521
(kids shouting)

8
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,362
(horn beeps)

9
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,115
(engine stops)

10
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:10,165
NARRATOR:
For some, time passes slowly.

11
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,466
An hour can seem an eternity.

12
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:17,305
For others,
there's never enough.

13
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,971
For the Tucks, it didn't exist.

14
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:22,640
(bird fluttering)

15
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:28,677
(tranquil music playing)

16
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,322
Time is like a wheel...

17
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:38,819
turning and turning,
never stopping

18
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:45,496
and the woods are the center,
the hub of the wheel.

19
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:51,033
(melancholy melody playing)

20
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,644
It began the first week
of summer

21
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:06,453
a strange and breathless time,
when accident, or fate

22
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,289
bring lives together

23
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,626
when people are led
to do things

24
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,132
they've never done before.

25
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,293
(water running)

26
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:21,135
On this summer's day,
not so very long ago

27
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:26,805
the wheel set lives in motion
in mysterious ways.

28
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,177
It set Mae Tuck out
in her wagon

29
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,149
for the village of Treegap

30
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:36,348
to meet her two sons as she did
once every ten years.

31
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:00,344
(horn blares)

32
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,370
(horse whinnies)

33
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:24,932
(women talking indistinctly)

34
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:28,200
(music box playing
wistful melody)

35
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,175
Ma!

36
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,473
Miles!

37
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:34,808
Jesse!

38
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,144
Oh...!

39
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,307
(both laughing)

40
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:38,316
Oh, I missed you.

41
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,475
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,814
Oh, I couldn't wait to see you.

43
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,819
I missed you, Jesse.

44
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,320
Oh, wait,
I got something for you.

45
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:44,322
Oh, look at you.

46
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:45,323
I got something.

47
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:46,324
Here, look.

48
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,688
The Eiffel Tower.

49
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,955
Would you look at that.

50
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:50,290
Got it in Paris, France.

51
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,762
Oh, Mom,
you've never seen anything

52
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,127
- So tall in your life.
- Hello...

53
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:55,156
Oh, I got something else.
I got something else.

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,168
How are you, old friend?

55
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,498
Your favorite... chocolates.

56
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,163
Oh, I've died
and gone to Heaven.

57
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,502
Oh, Jesse.

58
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:03,063
(gasps):
Miles...

59
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,568
Miles.

60
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:11,342
Give your mother a hug.

61
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:16,276
Ten years.

62
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,949
(laughs)

63
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,153
You're as cozy as barbed wire.

64
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,586
I have you back.

65
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:30,600
WOMAN:
Winifred!

66
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,797
Winifred!

67
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,170
Yes, Mother?

68
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,802
I need a new name.

69
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,574
One that's not all worn out
from being called so much.

70
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:44,843
(frog croaking)

71
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:46,747
Come inside this instant.

72
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,012
You're getting filthy!

73
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:49,884
(piano playing)

74
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,288
(playing classical music)

75
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,815
Ow! I can scarcely breathe.

76
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,487
(speaking French)

77
00:04:57,528 --> 00:05:00,156
"You must suffer
to be beautiful."

78
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:01,665
So say the French.

79
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,463
The French are crazy.

80
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:08,370
(piano music continues
playing)

81
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,375
(women speaking softly)

82
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,812
NARRATOR:
For Winnie Foster
one thing was true:

83
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:18,872
the heat of summer was not
nearly as stifling

84
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,908
as the formality of her life.

85
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:24,478
(piano music continues)

86
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,456
With every passing day

87
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:32,053
the feeling grew stronger.

88
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:34,930
She was coming closer
to the end of something

89
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:38,129
and moving towards
the beginning of something new.

90
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,297
(playing off-key)

91
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,307
- (groans)
- (music stops)

92
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:44,968
(sighs)

93
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,314
Change was in the air.

94
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,151
It was only a question of when.

95
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:06,459
(horn honking)

96
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,593
(engine stops)

97
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:11,362
Wait for me in the car.

98
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,927
I won't be a minute.

99
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:15,439
In the car, Mrs. Foster.

100
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:17,271
(kids yelling playfully)

101
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,038
BOY 1:
Throw it home! Throw it home!

102
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,543
BOY 2:
Come on, throw it home!

103
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,603
- Go!
- Run to me!

104
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,612
Yay!

105
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:24,238
No, no, no, no, no.

106
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,341
Too large for tea cakes.

107
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,283
None of these will do.

108
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,845
I prefer petit fours.

109
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,858
BOY (laughing):
What kind of a funny hat
is that?

110
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,449
Well, look'ee here.

111
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:39,257
If it's not Miss Moneybags
in her fancy car.

112
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,324
What's the matter?

113
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,459
Don't want
to get your feet dirty?

114
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:46,869
(kids chuckling)

115
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,463
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Foster.

116
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,634
Not much call
for such treats out here.

117
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,336
Well, I could just make them up
for you, special.

118
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:54,435
GIRL:
Winnie Foster?

119
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:55,946
You've got to be kidding!

120
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,141
BOY:
Wow!

121
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,444
GIRL:
Winnie, run!

122
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:01,384
Run, Winnie, run!

123
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,716
Throw it! Throw it!

124
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:05,221
BOY 2:
Throw it home! Come on!

125
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,951
Slide, Winnie, slide!

126
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,620
Winifred!

127
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:20,168
(fiddle music playing)

128
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:24,403
(geese clucking)

129
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,444
(clapping and laughing)

130
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:37,148
JESSE:
Oh, and they had
their arms crossed

131
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:40,124
and you see, the lines
were perfectly square.

132
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,216
Come here, come here.

133
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,452
I want to teach you. Come on.

134
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,788
Oh, all the way from France.

135
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,988
How about that?

136
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,394
Oh, look. Look-Look at this one.

137
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,795
I want to see, Pop. Let me see.

138
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,800
Look it.

139
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,324
Oh! Aah, he shot me!

140
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,199
Oh, I'm dead!

141
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,399
MAE:
Oh, oh, my!

142
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,805
- (Jesse groaning)
- Oh, my!

143
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,810
Oh, you'll have to see this one.

144
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,471
Miles, look at this!

145
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:01,478
(laughing)

146
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:04,072
Oh... let's see.

147
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,673
Okay, come here,
I want to show you.

148
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:06,911
I want to show you.

149
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,112
All right.

150
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:14,216
Good to have you home, son.

151
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm glad to see you.

152
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:21,591
And the family together.

153
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:24,295
But don't get used to it.

154
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,600
War's coming, I hear.

155
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:29,266
I'm joining up.

156
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:32,764
I'm going to fight the Huns.

157
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,144
Get as far away
from this place as I can.

158
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:49,953
Oh, you think
that'll solve things, do you?

159
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:54,830
You haven't had enough killing
for two lifetimes?

160
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:06,239
Somebody's on to us.

161
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:09,769
I know it.

162
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:17,378
There's a man who's been
following us

163
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,616
and we've lost him
several times, but...

164
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,856
he keeps coming back.

165
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:35,667
I think he knows something.

166
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,107
This man...

167
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,136
(laughing)

168
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:44,442
Jesse...

169
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:45,971
- (laughter)
- Whoo!

170
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:49,043
We're being tracked.

171
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,455
Oh, Miles, we lost him.

172
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:55,822
Don't go spoiling everything.

173
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,125
Yeah, we lost him, Jess...

174
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:02,793
but he keeps coming back.

175
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:06,462
It was only a matter of time
before someone found us.

176
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,903
The world is closing in.

177
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,139
Entire forest is almost gone.

178
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:19,878
All except this little wood.

179
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:28,158
I saw tire marks down
on the lower wash...

180
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:31,219
a few weeks ago.

181
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:34,822
There'll be more.

182
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,231
I don't want anyone going
to town.

183
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,668
Not for anything,
and that's that.

184
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,102
Tuck.

185
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,039
You see any strangers
in the woods getting too close

186
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:45,201
you know what to do.

187
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,041
No exceptions.

188
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:56,043
Our time here is almost done.

189
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:02,754
I can feel it.

190
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,580
MAN:
You'll never catch one that way.

191
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:28,484
Do you know
about catching fireflies?

192
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:29,985
Afraid not, never tried.

193
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,488
I prefer... bigger game.

194
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,149
Though I suspect the strategy

195
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,590
is much the same.

196
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,990
Strategy?

197
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:39,154
One must never announce
one's presence to the prey.

198
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,323
One must become part
of the scenery...

199
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:42,663
invisible...

200
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,260
almost disappear.

201
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:48,272
And be patient

202
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,070
until the exact, right moment

203
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,134
arrives... (grunts)

204
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:54,405
(gasps)

205
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:59,008
Take a prisoner.

206
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:00,346
For you?

207
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:02,682
No, thank you.

208
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:05,854
You're quite right.

209
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,451
A girl of your age
should find...

210
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:09,993
trapping suitors
more interesting

211
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,427
than trapping insects, anyway.

212
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:14,955
Far easier, I might add.

213
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,231
Have you lived here long?

214
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,466
Forever. Why?

215
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:25,668
I'm... looking
for some old friends

216
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,144
who live hereabouts.

217
00:12:28,178 --> 00:12:29,645
Thought you might
help me find them.

218
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,047
My father
practically built Treegap.

219
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,311
He knows everyone.

220
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,977
Perhaps he can help you.

221
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,145
Perhaps.

222
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,815
I quite like talking to you.

223
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,325
MRS. FOSTER:
Winifred?

224
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,485
Winifred, who are you talking to
out there?

225
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,154
I don't know.

226
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:49,832
He hasn't told me his name.

227
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,461
Good evening, madam.

228
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:54,471
Please forgive my intrusion.

229
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,100
This young lady tells me
you've lived here forever.

230
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,405
I thought you might know
of a certain family

231
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,706
goes by the name of...

232
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,076
I hardly know everyone,
nor do I want to.

233
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,947
And I don't stand outside
discussing such a thing

234
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,576
with... strangers.

235
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:11,145
Then I beg your pardon.

236
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:12,712
Good evening, young lady.

237
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:14,748
Madam.

238
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,825
(whistling wistful melody)

239
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,855
This is why I worry
about you, Winifred.

240
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,131
You don't have the sense
not to talk to a man like that.

241
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:28,605
(whistling continues)

242
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,205
MRS. FOSTER:
A proper education gains one
entré into society.

243
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,908
MR. FOSTER:
Your mother and I have given
this a great deal of thought.

244
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:39,745
Middlehouse Academy for Girls

245
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,581
in Pensford,
has an excellent reputation.

246
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,613
Middlehouse?

247
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:50,594
But that's a terrible place,
everyone says so.

248
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,958
It's like a jail.

249
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:52,964
Nonsense.

250
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,831
Girls emerge from there
as refined young ladies

251
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,130
well-versed in etiquette
and manners,

252
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:00,296
both of which
you are sorely lacking.

253
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,806
But I don't want to be
one of those girls.

254
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,308
Which is precisely why
you must go.

255
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,437
I cannot let
your unbridled nature

256
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,572
ruin your chances
for a respectable future.

257
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:13,208
Winifred... I'm sorry...

258
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,312
but we have to do
what's best for you.

259
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:23,120
I won't do it.

260
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,753
I'm not like those girls.

261
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:25,763
I won't go!

262
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:26,855
Winifred!

263
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,990
I won't go!

264
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:34,695
(melancholy music playing)

265
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:44,475
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was to be sent
500 miles away to be educated.

266
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:47,950
But what her parents didn't
understand

267
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:51,581
was she only wanted to step
just outside her fence...

268
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:54,318
so she did.

269
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,524
(birds chirping)

270
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:06,763
What in these quiet woods
should be so forbidden?

271
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:11,839
Winnie had always sensed
a mystery

272
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,105
waiting for her there.

273
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:22,849
It was a place so entirely
different from what she knew

274
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:26,254
so far away from her tight,
pruned world.

275
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,664
(birds screeching)

276
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:37,566
(gasps)

277
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:40,001
(foreboding music playing)

278
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,669
(water gurgling)

279
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:15,934
(music playing gently)

280
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,586
Ah!

281
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,779
Ah...

282
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,323
(exhales)

283
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,149
How long have you been
standing there?

284
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:01,481
Not long at all.

285
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:04,681
I was only walking past,
and I...

286
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:07,657
Well, you shouldn't...

287
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:11,183
be in these parts of the woods.

288
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:14,824
It's best you turn around
and go home.

289
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:21,969
Well, go on, now, get!

290
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:26,409
Excuse me,
but I own these woods, and...

291
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:29,105
I'll go on and get
when I want to.

292
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,374
You own these woods?

293
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,442
Yes, I do.

294
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,318
What's your name?

295
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:45,089
Winifred.

296
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,790
Winnie... Foster.

297
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,096
A Foster?

298
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,659
Well, I'll be.

299
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:54,672
Is that a fact?

300
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:58,232
Well... Winnie Foster,
like I was saying

301
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,472
you need to turn around
and go home.

302
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:04,606
It just so happens
that I was on my way home

303
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,207
before you made
your rude suggestion

304
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,151
and I would be happy
to continue on my way

305
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:11,519
if I only knew which way to go.

306
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,047
In other words, you're lost?

307
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:18,387
I'll point you home.

308
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,693
I'd be much obliged.

309
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,700
But I want a drink first.

310
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,201
Wait... no!

311
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:25,223
No!

312
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,395
What?

313
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,337
You don't want that water.

314
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,567
Uh, it's poisoned.

315
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,268
I saw you drink some.

316
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:33,334
Well, now I'm feeling sick.

317
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,278
You don't look ill.

318
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:36,439
I'm dry as dust.

319
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,607
I said, leave it alone!

320
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,085
Let go of me! My father
will have you arrested!

321
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,587
You're not going to go
and tell him, now, are you?

322
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,089
Hey! Come back!

323
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,786
Don't run away!

324
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:54,155
(panting)

325
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,098
Come back!

326
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,429
(screams)

327
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,233
Where you going so fast, Miss?

328
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:03,398
Miles, wait!

329
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,702
- No! No!
- You know what Tuck said, Jesse.

330
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:06,936
- No exceptions.
- Help!

331
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:08,638
You can't do this.

332
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,910
Stop! Let go!

333
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:11,915
We can't.

334
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,849
(Winifred grunting)

335
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,875
(rapid drumbeat music playing)

336
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,948
(horse snorting)

337
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:26,021
(panting)

338
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,259
Miles!

339
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:38,800
(grunting)

340
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,016
(grunting)

341
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:01,661
(panting)

342
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,875
Miss Foster!

343
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,280
Miss Foster!

344
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,888
Miss Foster!

345
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,486
Where are you?!

346
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,134
(horse galloping)

347
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:47,371
Ho.

348
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,810
(horse snorts)

349
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:51,336
We're stopping here.

350
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,050
- Not a word out of you, hear me?
- (yells)

351
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,076
Miles!

352
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,712
- What are you doing?
- No!

353
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,222
Let the poor girl go.

354
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:02,782
There's no reason
to be frightened, young lady.

355
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:03,987
(crying)

356
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:06,154
I caught her at the spring
with Jesse.

357
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,255
She's a Foster.

358
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,960
Oh, Lord.

359
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,434
It's finally happened.

360
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,663
I want to go home, please.

361
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:14,865
I want to go home.

362
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:17,431
There, there, child.
Please don't cry.

363
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:19,567
We're not bad people.

364
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,339
We'll take you home
just as soon as we can.

365
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:23,039
I promise.

366
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,673
Miles, go find your father.

367
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,080
He's across the lake.

368
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:28,175
He'll know what to do with her.

369
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:32,553
Tell Jesse I'm going to fix
that mouth of his.

370
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:41,022
(sighs)

371
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:45,092
(music box plays
wistful melody)

372
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:55,804
I've heard that.

373
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:57,040
Have you?

374
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,381
It's, it's my little music box.

375
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,444
I found it
in the forest one day.

376
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,818
Just waiting for me, I expect.

377
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:10,419
I've had it a long, long time.

378
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,988
(sighs)

379
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,227
Oh!

380
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:19,430
I put my baby boys
to bed with it every night.

381
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,871
Gave 'em such sweet dreams.

382
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,307
(music box plays)

383
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,573
(crickets chirping)

384
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,579
(frogs croaking)

385
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,942
I'm sure my boys
didn't mean you any harm.

386
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,353
Then why did they bring me here
this way?

387
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:39,583
Why am I here?

388
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,647
(sighs)

389
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,718
You have every right
to be upset.

390
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,422
And I know your family
must be...

391
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:46,656
worried sick about you.

392
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,494
(door opens)

393
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,965
Where's the child?

394
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:58,335
MAE:
She's no child... Angus.

395
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,096
(whispering):
Does she know?

396
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,365
Why do you think
I brought her...?

397
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:28,372
(indistinct whispering)

398
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:30,464
Yeah, but now she knows
about us, thanks to you.

399
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:31,474
Shh! Shh!

400
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,906
She's a Foster,
she only knows...

401
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:34,707
Know what?

402
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,452
Miss Foster,
this is my husband, Angus Tuck.

403
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:50,153
Angus, meet Miss Foster.

404
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,232
Hello, Miss Foster.

405
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,563
She's the most important event

406
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:05,905
that's taken place in this house
in 80 years.

407
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:14,076
You hungry?

408
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:16,051
MAE:
Oh, well, let's, let's all eat.

409
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:17,247
Yeah.

410
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,924
Jesse, pass your mother
a plate, please?

411
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,357
JESSE:
Mmm, where's the fish?

412
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:25,384
Oh, they weren't biting
for some reason.

413
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:27,157
(chuckles):
'Cause Pa can't fish?

414
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,165
Don't matter. There's plenty.

415
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,929
I catch fish.

416
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,198
If there's no fish,
there's no fish

417
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,432
if you keep scaring
the fish away.

418
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:36,565
(chuckling)

419
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:38,131
Mmm, this looks good.

420
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:39,643
MAE:
Oh! Isn't this nice?

421
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:43,271
Everybody sitting down together
and having Miss Foster here.

422
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,406
It's just like having a party.

423
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,718
My father will come looking
for me.

424
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:54,748
Your father... will cut down
the entire forest

425
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,987
the way things are changing
around here.

426
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,654
Make himself a very rich man.

427
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:01,994
Oh, now, let's not ruin
a perfectly good meal

428
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:03,432
with a lot of talk.

429
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,765
My father has plenty of money.

430
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,634
He'll pay.

431
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,933
Anything you want.

432
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:12,271
We don't want your father's
money, Miss Foster.

433
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:15,006
Then let me go home.

434
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,376
We will.

435
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:19,747
We'll let you go home...
just like I promised.

436
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:20,978
Directly.

437
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,747
We'll need to be able
to trust her first

438
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,653
before we're sending her
back to her folks.

439
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,920
Trust her? We can't trust her.

440
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,550
Or any normal people.

441
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,857
She'll turn on us in a second.

442
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:34,022
No, she won't.

443
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,666
You're a fool.

444
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:41,867
You don't even realize
what you've done here.

445
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,810
(slams door)

446
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,357
(clock ticking)

447
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:16,529
(clock ticking)

448
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:24,981
Him.

449
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,008
It's him.

450
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:30,019
Robert!

451
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:31,714
I expect you to find her, Henry.

452
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,086
That's your job.

453
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,455
I've already wired her
description down the main line.

454
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:36,460
They'll keep a lookout

455
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,461
and we'll get up a search party
come morning.

456
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,827
My wife is certain that this man
wearing a yellow suit

457
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,026
has something to do
with Winifred's disappearance.

458
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:45,193
And Miss Foster says so
based on...?

459
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:47,803
Her instincts.

460
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:49,067
Hmm.

461
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,540
Well, maybe you better step
in here, Mr. Foster.

462
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:04,048
Am I whom you're looking for?

463
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,146
I do believe I fit
the description.

464
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:11,159
My wife said she saw you
talking to my daughter.

465
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,320
Yes, I did.

466
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:15,423
She's a charming girl,
full of fire.

467
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:17,193
Perhaps too much.

468
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,827
She's gone, is she?

469
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,634
Looks like she... ran away.

470
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:23,833
Did she now?

471
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,307
Somehow I'm not surprised.

472
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,971
My daughter did not... run away.

473
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:30,741
And I'm not interested
in what surprises you, sir.

474
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,181
I want to know
if you know anything

475
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,183
of her whereabouts.

476
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:35,184
No, Mr. Foster.

477
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,016
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I do not.

478
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:41,012
I am quite coincidentally here
in search of someone myself.

479
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,183
I'm seeking a family

480
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:43,853
that used to live
in these environs.

481
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,259
I thought the constable could

482
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,320
help me locate them,
but ironically, Mr. Foster

483
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,095
your daughter thought
you could help.

484
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,359
Name of Tuck.

485
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:55,030
Long lost relatives.

486
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:57,506
I-I can't help you.

487
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:00,933
Nor I you.

488
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,173
At least not now.

489
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:11,748
However, I'd be happy

490
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:13,779
to search your woods
for you, Mr. Foster.

491
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:15,689
I'm rather talented
at finding people.

492
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:17,284
I just might meet with success.

493
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:18,589
Good evening, Constable.

494
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:24,031
Find out what happened
to her, Henry.

495
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,865
Please.

496
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:30,202
She's our only child.

497
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:36,342
Angus made that cradle.

498
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,279
Brought it all the way
from Scotland.

499
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,840
Oh, it's rocked a few Tucks.

500
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,182
There you go.

501
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,586
The breeze off the lake
will keep you cool all night.

502
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,057
The boys sleep up in the loft
when they're home

503
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:49,615
so you'll have your privacy.

504
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:52,692
Oh, that corset looks painful.

505
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,560
May I help you off with it?

506
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh, honestly, I can't understand

507
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,875
why women torture themselves
this way.

508
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:14,612
It's no way to live.

509
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,643
Do you have a daughter?

510
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:19,747
A granddaughter.

511
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,382
And a grandson.

512
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:25,087
Anna and Beau.

513
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:27,961
Oh, Miles loved them so.

514
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,429
What happened?

515
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,903
They died.

516
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,337
Their mother, too.

517
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,968
I'm afraid the good parts
of Miles died along with them.

518
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,740
You'll have to forgive
what's left of him.

519
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,875
I'm sorry.

520
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:50,409
Well, it's... it's the way
things are, Miss Foster.

521
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,017
Can I call you Winnie?

522
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,789
MAE:
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

523
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,458
WINIFRED:
No, it's only me.

524
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:03,464
My mother...

525
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,023
(soft music playing)

526
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:07,866
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

527
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,576
MAE:
There.

528
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,770
WINNIE:
So where do they go?

529
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:17,837
Oh, they go different places,
do different things.

530
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,078
Miles can do carpentry
and he's good with his hands.

531
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:23,847
Jesse, now, he seems
to have settled himself.

532
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,377
Of course, then, he's...

533
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,413
he's young yet.

534
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:37,067
Well...

535
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,228
I hope you will be
comfortable here.

536
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:45,571
It's a good feeling
having another woman here.

537
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,979
Try and get some sleep now.

538
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,391
(church bells toll
in distance)

539
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,469
(scoffs)

540
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:14,471
MAN:
Hello?

541
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,836
(church bells tolling)

542
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:20,672
Have you lost your way, friend?

543
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,111
Not hardly, Reverend.

544
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:27,480
I'm looking
for a family name... Tuck.

545
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,211
Are you familiar with it?

546
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:31,482
Tuck. Tuck?

547
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:33,489
I'm afraid I can't help you.

548
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:35,888
There are no Tucks
in this cemetery that I know of.

549
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:36,983
No, I wouldn't think so.

550
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,994
Ha!

551
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:40,655
Or in any other.

552
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:43,992
Tell me, Reverend

553
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:46,832
you who have attended
so many deathbeds...

554
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,998
what is it people most desire

555
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,201
as they face the end
of their lives?

556
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:54,676
More time?

557
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:55,837
Well, I suppose.

558
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,744
Exactly.

559
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:01,775
They'd give almost anything,
I imagine, for one more year.

560
00:32:01,818 --> 00:32:04,720
Imagine what they'd give
for all eternity.

561
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,722
Sir, I don't quite understand
what...

562
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,748
You will.

563
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:14,430
Reverend, are you prepared
to die right now, this instant?

564
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:15,829
If it's God's will.

565
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,196
What if it is my will?

566
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:23,798
What if you could be eternal?

567
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,833
Right now, this instant?

568
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:29,038
Without having to face
the uncertainty of death?

569
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:30,239
Hmm?

570
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,112
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

571
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:33,376
No muss, no fuss.

572
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:36,579
Invincible to disease.

573
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:40,750
Never having to suffer
the stench and rot of old age.

574
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,020
Forever young.

575
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:48,087
You speak blasphemy, sir.

576
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,656
Fluently.

577
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,292
(laughs)

578
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,933
Good night, Reverend.

579
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,816
(whistling wistful melody)

580
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:32,673
Hey, Winnie Foster, you asleep?

581
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:38,278
Not anymore.

582
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,782
Good.

583
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:43,582
Hey.

584
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,588
Listen.

585
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,683
How would you like
to see the Eiffel Tower?

586
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,694
What?

587
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:52,923
Someday.

588
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:54,931
No, now.

589
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:57,525
While the day is still ours.

590
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,727
(birds singing)

591
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:04,834
Get those dogs over there.

592
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes, sir.

593
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,442
Come on, boys, let's go.

594
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,105
Henry, this is
Winifred's nightgown.

595
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:10,443
Give it to the dog handlers.

596
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,539
Start in the north end.

597
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:13,344
Let's split up
when we get to the lake.

598
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,577
We'll find her.

599
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:15,811
I know we will.

600
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,286
Winifred!

601
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,880
Miss Foster!

602
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:21,083
Winnie!

603
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,117
Winifred Foster!

604
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,458
Miss Foster!

605
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,623
Winifred!

606
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,097
Over here!

607
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,161
I found something!

608
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:43,110
(both panting)

609
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,949
There it is.

610
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,585
This is the Eiffel Tower?

611
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,923
The one in Paris,
it's pretty tall.

612
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:03,626
Mine's two feet higher.

613
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,340
Here.

614
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,969
Come on.

615
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,070
Have you really seen
the real one in Paris?

616
00:35:16,112 --> 00:35:17,340
Yes, I have.

617
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,440
And climbed 1,652 stairs
to the top.

618
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,108
Much easier than this.

619
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,277
Yes.

620
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,445
You doing all right?

621
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:25,614
I think so.

622
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:26,782
You're doing great.

623
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:29,724
Here.

624
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:33,891
If I went to the Eiffel Tower

625
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,454
I would take
one of those elevators.

626
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:36,659
Not with me.

627
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,065
You'd take off your shoes

628
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:40,262
and walk up
every single solitary step.

629
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,599
How old are you?

630
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,474
Do you really want to know?

631
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,277
Yes.

632
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,748
104.

633
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:54,876
I'm serious.

634
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:57,681
So am I.

635
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,518
Let's just call it 17.

636
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:09,260
There's my Paris.

637
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:14,760
The view from the Eiffel Tower
can't be better than this.

638
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:21,472
I've seen a lot of views,
and this is one of the best.

639
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,583
(piano playing
classical music)

640
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:49,164
(clock ticking)

641
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:59,940
(men shouting)

642
00:36:59,983 --> 00:37:01,951
Come on.

643
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,452
(dogs barking)

644
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,139
(music ends)

645
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,514
(shouting playfully)

646
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,715
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was beginning
to lose track of time.

647
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:18,527
Had she been there a day,
a week, a month?

648
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:26,125
It seemed to Winnie
that the Tucks lived in a way

649
00:38:26,168 --> 00:38:28,898
the rest of the world
had forgotten.

650
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:35,309
They were never in a hurry
and did things the slow way.

651
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:50,456
For the first time

652
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:57,092
Winnie felt free to explore,
to ask questions, to play.

653
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,813
# #

654
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:26,420
Me?

655
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,260
I'm going to see the world.

656
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:30,596
Every speck of it.

657
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:35,161
Heck, I may even find some
new continents or something.

658
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:41,431
I mean, I've been
to a lot of places

659
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,503
but the world is huge!

660
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:51,449
Jesse Tuck,
what-what are you doing?

661
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:56,983
What does it look like?

662
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,367
Woo-hoo!

663
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:12,998
Woo! Ah, whoo.

664
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,179
(gasping)

665
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,907
Come on!

666
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:20,141
I can't!

667
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:21,480
Why?

668
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:23,815
You're not afraid of a little
cold water, are you?

669
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,150
No.

670
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:26,485
Are you afraid of me?

671
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,286
No.

672
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:30,224
Well, what then?

673
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:35,159
I can't swim.

674
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:37,166
You're joshing me.

675
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,894
I wish I were.

676
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,733
So, you're afraid you'll drown,
right?

677
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:47,869
Swallow too much water,
sink to the bottom and die.

678
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:50,003
Thank you for putting it
so vividly.

679
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,514
And, yes,
considering I'd sink like a rock

680
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:54,175
drowning is a fair concern.

681
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:58,516
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to enjoy this

682
00:40:58,554 --> 00:41:01,182
all by myself.

683
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:02,952
Hmm...

684
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:04,425
Hmm!

685
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,204
(yells)

686
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,306
Ah, Jesse!

687
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:26,315
Hey, hey, it's okay.

688
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:27,976
Come here, come here, come here.

689
00:41:28,016 --> 00:41:30,315
I've got you, I've got you.

690
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:32,480
I've got you, relax.

691
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:33,989
Relax against me.

692
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:35,148
You all right?

693
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,318
I think so.

694
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,157
Whoo!

695
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,322
You did it!

696
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,490
I did it!

697
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:45,329
Ah, it feels wonderful.

698
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:47,996
I'm weightless.

699
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:50,335
That's 'cause we're
carrying you, see?

700
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,840
The water and me.

701
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:55,503
We're both carrying you.

702
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:56,842
You like the feeling?

703
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,211
I love it.

704
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,280
Jesse, don't let go!

705
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:05,617
It's okay, it's okay.

706
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,282
There's no chance of that,
Winnie Foster.

707
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:12,818
I'm never going to let you go.

708
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:32,608
# #

709
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:48,291
# #

710
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,447
(horse nickers)

711
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:08,313
(car honking)

712
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,820
(honky-tonk music playing)

713
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:36,777
You know, I don't like
being laughed at by a cheat.

714
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,608
Now "cheat" is a nasty word,
sir.

715
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:47,449
I much prefer "card sharp."

716
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:52,925
(chuckles)

717
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:03,762
You are looking for trouble,
aren't you, mister?

718
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:05,432
Yes, sir, I sure am.

719
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:06,702
Going outside!

720
00:44:06,742 --> 00:44:07,710
Come on!

721
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:09,108
Perhaps next time...

722
00:44:09,144 --> 00:44:10,442
(glass breaking)

723
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,469
Come on!

724
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:16,876
He can't hurt me!

725
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,447
Whoo!

726
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,822
(laughing)

727
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:29,791
Thank you.

728
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:33,164
Thank you very much.

729
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:41,666
Excuse me, citizen.

730
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:49,010
(bird hooting)

731
00:44:54,856 --> 00:44:57,791
(bird screeching)

732
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:02,324
You hear that?

733
00:45:02,364 --> 00:45:04,764
Tuck says
it's the most melancholy sound

734
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,427
in all of nature.

735
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:08,436
Listen.

736
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,099
Just listen.

737
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:13,802
(cacophony of bird sounds)

738
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:21,141
They're playing for you.

739
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:42,302
(drumbeats)

740
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:47,001
(rhythmic tapping)

741
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:54,572
# #

742
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:58,746
Whoo! Yeah!

743
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:04,748
# #

744
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,096
# #

745
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,385
# #

746
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:10,418
I wish this moment
could last forever.

747
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:14,088
Forever?

748
00:47:14,128 --> 00:47:16,427
You want to spend forever
with me, Winnie?

749
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:19,797
I do.

750
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:27,268
You know, we could see
the world together.

751
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:31,268
We could do
everything together.

752
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:34,771
Have a million moments
like this one that...

753
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,650
never, never stop.

754
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:46,291
There's a part about us
you don't know...

755
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:49,626
the part I've sworn
not to tell you.

756
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:51,291
The secret?

757
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:55,702
The reason you don't want anyone
to find out about you?

758
00:47:55,737 --> 00:47:56,864
I knew it.

759
00:47:56,905 --> 00:48:00,864
You're... you're bank robbers
or grifters.

760
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:03,400
You are the first human
I've ever met

761
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:05,309
I wanted to know the truth.

762
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:10,911
Jesse Tuck, you're the first
human I've ever met

763
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:14,581
that I've ever wanted to...

764
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:16,454
to...

765
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:22,528
...to do that.

766
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:37,869
Winnie, listen.

767
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:39,141
Remember the giant oak tree

768
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:40,978
at the center of the wood
where we met?

769
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:46,954
The little spring bubbling up
you saw me drink from?

770
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:50,425
You remember when I told you
I was 104 years old?

771
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,385
Well...

772
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,864
it's the honest truth.

773
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:06,067
I'm going to live forever.

774
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:07,871
I'm never going to change.

775
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:11,746
The same with Miles
and Tuck and Mae.

776
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,577
Something happened to us.

777
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:16,550
As far as I know, I'm...
I'm going to be 17

778
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:18,576
until the end of the world.

779
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,681
It's the spring, Winnie.

780
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:24,420
The water,
something's wrong with it.

781
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:26,858
It stops you
right where you are.

782
00:49:26,894 --> 00:49:29,887
If you had a drink of it today,
you'd stay just like you are.

783
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:33,059
(twigs snapping)

784
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:40,268
Don't you wish he'd told you...

785
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:42,300
before you kissed him?

786
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:44,369
Did he tell you

787
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:47,347
immortality isn't all the
preachers crack it up to be?

788
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:49,713
Hey, leave her alone, Miles.

789
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:53,117
Oh, now... you want her
to hear it, Jesse boy.

790
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:57,090
She's the first person
you want to tell the truth to.

791
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:00,458
You just don't want me
to have what you lost.

792
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:02,224
WINNIE:
Stop this...

793
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:05,793
...both of you

794
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,630
and tell me the truth.

795
00:50:07,668 --> 00:50:08,931
I want to know.

796
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,873
We all had a drink...

797
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:24,184
...except for the cat...
that's important.

798
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:28,211
(gentle music playing)

799
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:32,318
The water tasted like...

800
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,989
Heaven.

801
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,123
Floated over your tongue
like a cloud.

802
00:50:40,135 --> 00:50:43,434
Tuck carved a "T" in the trunk,
to mark where we'd been.

803
00:50:43,472 --> 00:50:46,407
We moved on west, looking
for a place to settle down.

804
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,643
Put up a house for Mae and Tuck

805
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:53,909
and a little shed
for Jesse and me.

806
00:50:56,652 --> 00:51:02,454
That was the first time we
figured there was something...

807
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,788
(chuckles)

808
00:51:03,824 --> 00:51:05,793
peculiar.

809
00:51:05,827 --> 00:51:07,157
(muffled yell)

810
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:10,891
Jesse fell 30 feet,
landed right on his neck.

811
00:51:10,932 --> 00:51:12,400
(muffled yell)

812
00:51:12,434 --> 00:51:14,163
He was up on his feet again

813
00:51:14,202 --> 00:51:16,431
before Mae could work up
a good cry.

814
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:19,702
Didn't hurt him a bit.
No broken bones... nothing.

815
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:23,869
That's not all.

816
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:28,677
Not by a long shot.

817
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:32,443
Things began to happen.

818
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,148
# #

819
00:51:34,188 --> 00:51:35,679
Some brushpoppers mistook

820
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:38,420
- Mae's horse for a deer.
- (gunshots)

821
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:41,291
Thing is,
the bullets didn't kill him.

822
00:51:42,496 --> 00:51:45,795
Barely even left a mark.

823
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,391
Then Tuck got bitten

824
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:50,166
by a rattlesnake,
and you know what?

825
00:51:50,204 --> 00:51:52,001
He didn't die...

826
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:53,905
(laughs)

827
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,932
...but the cat did

828
00:51:55,978 --> 00:51:58,139
of old age.

829
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:06,079
# #

830
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,885
And Miles got married.

831
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:20,228
Daddy!

832
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:25,769
(laughing)

833
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:31,434
(laughing)

834
00:52:39,186 --> 00:52:40,518
(whispering):
Beau.

835
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,451
Little Anna.

836
00:52:48,463 --> 00:52:50,362
Tuck figured it early on.

837
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:53,333
It's the spring.

838
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:57,702
We all drank from it,
even the horse.

839
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:06,445
Had to be... the source
of our changelessness.

840
00:53:12,987 --> 00:53:15,251
I begged her to come back...
for me

841
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:17,780
and find the spring
and drink from it.

842
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:19,452
The children, too.

843
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:22,088
It was our only hope
to be together.

844
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:28,402
(chain creaking)

845
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:34,835
(creaking)

846
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,365
She made up her mind

847
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:38,844
I'd sold my soul
to the Devil...

848
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:42,606
...and she left me.

849
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,619
She took my babies with her.

850
00:53:45,652 --> 00:53:47,643
(creaking)

851
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:57,063
Everyone...
pulled away after that.

852
00:53:57,097 --> 00:54:02,331
There was talk of witchcraft...
black magic.

853
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:08,601
(whinnying)

854
00:54:12,112 --> 00:54:13,045
(whinnying)

855
00:54:18,418 --> 00:54:20,387
# #

856
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:27,692
I went looking for wars
to fight...

857
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:33,257
and I saw brave men die
at Vera Cruz...

858
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,826
and then Gettysburg...

859
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:40,204
thousands,
in the blink of an eye...

860
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,510
(voice breaking):
...but not me.

861
00:54:46,547 --> 00:54:48,538
I couldn't die...

862
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:53,076
...like little Anna.

863
00:54:56,123 --> 00:55:01,083
The influenza took her
before she's 15.

864
00:55:01,128 --> 00:55:03,028
And Beau.

865
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:05,259
He'd be almost 80 now

866
00:55:05,298 --> 00:55:07,289
if he were still alive.

867
00:55:16,811 --> 00:55:18,369
And my sweet...

868
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:25,384
...my sweet young bride.

869
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:31,617
She died in an insane asylum...

870
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:35,925
...old and alone.

871
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:41,625
(crying):
But I'm still here.

872
00:55:43,637 --> 00:55:44,934
I'm still here.

873
00:55:44,972 --> 00:55:48,202
(crying)

874
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:50,233
# #

875
00:55:58,286 --> 00:56:00,277
# #

876
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,947
(birds chirping)

877
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:16,960
# #

878
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:28,972
# #

879
00:56:40,427 --> 00:56:43,885
Winnie Foster, you're the only
other person in the world

880
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:45,922
who knows about us.

881
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:51,735
We'll have to have a talk.

882
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:53,239
Pa.

883
00:56:53,273 --> 00:56:54,934
Come on.

884
00:57:00,181 --> 00:57:02,809
(birds chirping)

885
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:04,840
# #

886
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,827
# #

887
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,528
(whispering):
Look around you.

888
00:57:25,672 --> 00:57:27,641
It's teeming life.

889
00:57:27,675 --> 00:57:30,974
It's flowers and trees
and frogs.

890
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:34,572
It's... it's all part
of the wheel.

891
00:57:34,615 --> 00:57:37,585
It's always changing;
it's always growing

892
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,085
like you, Winnie.

893
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,351
Your life is never the same.

894
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:47,690
You were once a child.

895
00:57:47,728 --> 00:57:51,391
Now, you are
about to become a woman.

896
00:57:51,498 --> 00:57:53,090
One day, you'll grow up

897
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:55,398
and you'll do
something important.

898
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,630
You'll have children,
maybe, and then one day

899
00:57:58,672 --> 00:58:01,972
you'll go out...

900
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,978
just like the flame of a candle.

901
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:05,842
You'll make way for new life.

902
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,177
That's a certainty.

903
00:58:07,215 --> 00:58:10,081
That's the natural way
of things.

904
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:12,018
And then, there's us.

905
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:16,012
What we Tucks have,
you can't call it living.

906
00:58:16,056 --> 00:58:19,025
We just... are.

907
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:23,052
We're like rocks,
stuck at the side of a stream.

908
00:58:24,965 --> 00:58:25,954
Listen to me.

909
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,730
Winnie, you know
a dangerous secret.

910
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:30,260
If people find out
about the spring

911
00:58:30,304 --> 00:58:31,827
they'll trample
all over each other

912
00:58:31,873 --> 00:58:32,840
to get to that water.

913
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:35,740
There's one thing I've learned
about people.

914
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:38,677
Many will do anything,
anything not to die

915
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:42,342
and they'll do anything
to keep from living their life.

916
00:58:42,382 --> 00:58:47,150
Do you want
to stay stuck as you are

917
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:50,179
right now, forever?

918
00:58:53,193 --> 00:58:56,061
I've just got
to make you understand.

919
00:58:58,065 --> 00:59:00,159
I don't want to die.
Is that wrong?

920
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:02,498
No.

921
00:59:02,536 --> 00:59:06,166
No human does...

922
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:09,505
but i-it's part of the wheel...

923
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:12,307
the same as being born.

924
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:16,577
You can't have living
without dying.

925
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:20,780
Don't be afraid of death,
Winnie.

926
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:24,815
Be afraid of the unlived life.

927
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:28,795
# #

928
00:59:38,438 --> 00:59:40,429
# #

929
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,117
# #

930
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:53,643
(knocking at door)

931
00:59:55,088 --> 00:59:56,679
(hinges creaking)

932
01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:02,985
Your tea, sir.

933
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:12,804
She's with them now.

934
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:14,806
I came directly here,

935
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,139
knowing how tormented
you must be.

936
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:19,144
We-we just want her back safely.

937
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,577
Course you do.

938
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:22,911
Dreadful business, kidnapping.

939
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:25,918
Fortunate I was witness.

940
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:28,920
I'm perhaps the only person...

941
01:00:28,954 --> 01:00:30,945
who knows where to find her.

942
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:38,126
Just what is your game, sir?

943
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:39,826
What is my game?

944
01:00:41,835 --> 01:00:43,768
You detect in me a playful mood?

945
01:00:43,804 --> 01:00:46,500
"Playful" is not
the word I had in mind.

946
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:52,266
What I have in mind
is a simple, clear-cut trade.

947
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:54,871
You see,
I very much like your woods

948
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:58,942
not for their timber, mind you

949
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:01,818
but for their natural assets.

950
01:01:01,855 --> 01:01:03,880
Wh-What is it you want?

951
01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:06,893
You want your daughter.

952
01:01:06,927 --> 01:01:09,760
I want your woods.

953
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,733
You're involved in this,
aren't you?

954
01:01:14,768 --> 01:01:16,291
If you have touched
my daughter...!

955
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:20,001
I have my faults, Mr. Foster.

956
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:22,166
Kidnapping is not amongst them.

957
01:01:24,177 --> 01:01:27,043
These are rough people,
the ones who took her.

958
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:29,014
No telling what they might do.

959
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:30,983
(exhales)

960
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:37,148
Unless we do what you say.

961
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:40,181
Give the man whatever he wants.

962
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:48,030
(hinges creaking)

963
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:52,603
Done and done.

964
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:55,802
Nice to have things legal
and tidy, don't you agree?

965
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,902
You're an intelligent,
reasonable man, Mr. Foster.

966
01:01:58,945 --> 01:02:01,469
I'm seldom wrong
as a judge of character.

967
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:05,677
Have your friendly constable
on hand

968
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:07,686
to make
the appropriate arrests.

969
01:02:07,721 --> 01:02:10,280
Your terrible ordeal is
as good as over.

970
01:02:10,322 --> 01:02:12,018
I'll get there before you.

971
01:02:12,057 --> 01:02:13,820
We have to move quickly.

972
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,918
They were packing to leave.

973
01:02:18,498 --> 01:02:22,025
ROBERT:
What kind of horrible people
must these kidnappers be?

974
01:02:22,068 --> 01:02:24,695
HENRY:
There is evil in the world,
Mr. Foster.

975
01:02:24,737 --> 01:02:27,467
There aren't fences high enough
to keep it out.

976
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:30,065
ROBERT:
Bring your men
directly to my house.

977
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,440
I'm going with you.

978
01:02:31,478 --> 01:02:33,445
(dogs barking)

979
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,471
# #

980
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:47,686
# #

981
01:02:53,632 --> 01:02:54,963
(birds calling)

982
01:02:57,536 --> 01:02:59,596
It isn't fair, Tuck.

983
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:01,106
No, it isn't...

984
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:03,802
but when has life
ever been fair?

985
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:10,806
How am I going to take you home

986
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:13,818
when I can't make my feet move
from this spot?

987
01:03:16,489 --> 01:03:19,150
If I could die tomorrow,
I'd do it...

988
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:21,956
just to spend one more night
with you.

989
01:03:21,994 --> 01:03:24,759
Forgive me for interrupting
such a tender moment.

990
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:32,032
Hello, Winifred.

991
01:03:32,072 --> 01:03:35,974
Everyone's been so worried
about you.

992
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:38,806
I'm relieved
to find you so well.

993
01:03:38,844 --> 01:03:40,539
You know this man?

994
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:42,070
I met him once.

995
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:53,983
Hello, Mr. Tuck.

996
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:58,690
You have no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

997
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:03,291
You're the man
who's been following my boys.

998
01:04:07,106 --> 01:04:08,733
Been expecting you.

999
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:11,744
Yes, and here I am.

1000
01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:15,679
Tell me, is it a relief...
to finally be discovered?

1001
01:04:15,715 --> 01:04:20,344
Over a century of hiding out
must have taken its toll on you.

1002
01:04:20,387 --> 01:04:22,047
Who are you?

1003
01:04:24,056 --> 01:04:26,422
And how do you know so much
about us?

1004
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:30,724
I first heard about your family
from my grandmother.

1005
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:33,755
She knew a woman
in a mental facility

1006
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,496
who used to...
rant and ramble about a family

1007
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:40,300
who never grew old
and never died.

1008
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,605
This woman,
she used to call out a name.

1009
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:45,269
What was it, now?

1010
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,608
Anna.

1011
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:48,237
Crazy old woman.

1012
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,681
Kept on talking
about a music box.

1013
01:04:51,717 --> 01:04:55,313
It seems the melody had a
calming effect on her children.

1014
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:57,414
I'm sure you know it, Mrs. Tuck?

1015
01:04:57,456 --> 01:05:01,291
(whistling wistful melody)

1016
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:03,295
(music box playing)

1017
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:11,960
You have no right...

1018
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:16,567
to come to our home...
and bring us such pain.

1019
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:19,099
There, good mother.

1020
01:05:19,144 --> 01:05:21,170
I mean no harm.

1021
01:05:22,882 --> 01:05:26,943
Tell us, sir.

1022
01:05:26,985 --> 01:05:29,284
What is it you want?

1023
01:05:29,322 --> 01:05:33,452
Well, you see, the Fosters
have given me these woods

1024
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:35,824
in exchange
for bringing young Winifred

1025
01:05:35,862 --> 01:05:36,954
back home to them.

1026
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:39,396
I have the papers,
all signed and legal.

1027
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:41,400
Gives me the rights
to the forest

1028
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:42,797
and everything in it.

1029
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:44,132
Don't be alarmed.

1030
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:47,139
I'll let you stay here...
on my land

1031
01:05:47,172 --> 01:05:49,300
if you prove cooperative.

1032
01:05:49,342 --> 01:05:51,400
Cooperative?

1033
01:05:51,443 --> 01:05:54,106
I want you to take me
to the spring.

1034
01:05:58,217 --> 01:06:00,344
I don't know what you mean.

1035
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:02,047
Don't insult me, Mr. Tuck.

1036
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:03,918
It's immediately clear to me

1037
01:06:03,956 --> 01:06:06,925
that the water's powers
have been wasted on...

1038
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,927
unimaginative people like you.

1039
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:10,929
I intend to make

1040
01:06:10,963 --> 01:06:13,989
this fountain of youth,
as the simpletons would call it

1041
01:06:14,032 --> 01:06:16,023
available to those
who deserve it...

1042
01:06:16,068 --> 01:06:18,036
for a price, of course.

1043
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:23,634
You'll die of old age
before I'll take you.

1044
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:25,108
Is that so?

1045
01:06:25,144 --> 01:06:26,668
Then, perhaps Winifred will!

1046
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:27,644
JESSE:
No!

1047
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:28,112
(fires)

1048
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:28,806
(grunts)

1049
01:06:28,847 --> 01:06:30,007
Jesse!

1050
01:06:30,048 --> 01:06:32,039
(groans)

1051
01:06:39,759 --> 01:06:41,192
# #

1052
01:06:47,233 --> 01:06:49,224
(whispering):
Yes!

1053
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:51,260
Bravo!

1054
01:06:57,443 --> 01:06:58,909
Come now, Winifred.

1055
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:00,036
I'm feeling thirsty.

1056
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,637
Show me where the spring is.

1057
01:07:01,681 --> 01:07:03,739
Perhaps I'll let you have
a drink.

1058
01:07:03,782 --> 01:07:05,273
After all...

1059
01:07:06,385 --> 01:07:10,322
...then we can spend...
eternity together.

1060
01:07:12,057 --> 01:07:12,717
- (yelps)
- (screams)

1061
01:07:16,262 --> 01:07:17,922
(gasping)

1062
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,389
(moans softly)

1063
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:31,106
Winnie, Winnie, come here.

1064
01:07:31,143 --> 01:07:34,409
It's okay. It's okay, I gotcha.

1065
01:07:39,585 --> 01:07:42,179
(crying)

1066
01:07:42,222 --> 01:07:46,181
(dogs barking in distance)

1067
01:07:46,226 --> 01:07:47,887
Pa.

1068
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:49,918
(dogs barking louder)

1069
01:07:58,804 --> 01:08:00,773
(barking continuing)

1070
01:08:00,806 --> 01:08:03,570
There they are!

1071
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:05,510
Winnie Foster!

1072
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:06,943
MAN:
I see her!

1073
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,880
I got her!

1074
01:08:08,914 --> 01:08:11,110
Circle around to the right!

1075
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,117
Watch the water!

1076
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,208
Go!

1077
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:14,277
Don't let anyone get away!

1078
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,753
Jesse, come on.

1079
01:08:15,788 --> 01:08:16,755
ROBERT:
Winnie!

1080
01:08:16,788 --> 01:08:17,778
MAN:
Block that trail!

1081
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:18,791
It's my father.

1082
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:20,655
(men shouting)

1083
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:22,990
MAN:
Keep them alive!

1084
01:08:23,029 --> 01:08:24,894
(dogs barking)

1085
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,262
Be careful of the girl!
Winnie!

1086
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,961
Let's go!

1087
01:08:30,936 --> 01:08:32,871
Wait...

1088
01:08:36,275 --> 01:08:37,243
Get on.

1089
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:38,971
MAN:
Behind the house, men!

1090
01:08:39,011 --> 01:08:41,673
He's setting the house on fire!

1091
01:08:41,713 --> 01:08:43,341
Winnie!

1092
01:08:43,382 --> 01:08:45,373
You're all right.
You're all right.

1093
01:08:45,451 --> 01:08:46,382
(crying)

1094
01:08:46,452 --> 01:08:48,248
We found you. You're safe.

1095
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:49,380
You're safe now.

1096
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,014
Everything's all right.

1097
01:08:51,056 --> 01:08:52,024
Winnie.

1098
01:08:52,057 --> 01:08:53,024
(men shouting)

1099
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:54,548
Hyah!

1100
01:09:02,635 --> 01:09:05,103
(men shouting)

1101
01:09:05,137 --> 01:09:07,628
(dogs barking)

1102
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:18,974

1103
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:27,421
NARRATOR:
The hall clock chimed the hour.

1104
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:31,088
Outside, the wind was still.

1105
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:34,429
Everything, it seemed,
was waiting.

1106
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,332
(music box melody playing)

1107
01:09:36,368 --> 01:09:38,462
(feet pounding rhythmically)

1108
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,471
(music droning)

1109
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:02,484
(clock ticking)

1110
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:15,563
ROBERT:
We just want to understand
what happened.

1111
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:16,574
(sighs)

1112
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:20,978
Winnie... try, please.

1113
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:29,820
They didn't kidnap me.

1114
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:32,483
I was with them
because I wanted to be.

1115
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:34,890
- (fan snaps)
- She doesn't know

1116
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:36,554
what she's saying.

1117
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:38,926
The Tucks were kind to me.

1118
01:10:38,963 --> 01:10:40,931
They're my friends.

1119
01:10:40,966 --> 01:10:42,865
ROBERT:
If they didn't kidnap you,
why on earth

1120
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:45,734
did that woman club that man
over the head with a shotgun?

1121
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:48,034
Because Mae Tuck
was protecting me.

1122
01:10:48,073 --> 01:10:49,769
MAN:
Doesn't matter anyway.

1123
01:10:49,809 --> 01:10:52,573
That fella died.
It's a murder charge now.

1124
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,305
I didn't much like the man

1125
01:10:54,345 --> 01:10:57,542
but that won't stop
that poor woman from hanging.

1126
01:10:57,582 --> 01:11:00,746
Miss is an eyewitness.

1127
01:11:00,786 --> 01:11:03,083
She'll have to testify.

1128
01:11:03,122 --> 01:11:04,645
Oh, my God.

1129
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:07,158
(footsteps departing)

1130
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:09,457
(hinges creaking)

1131
01:11:09,494 --> 01:11:10,462
(door slams)

1132
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:12,690
I figured you might want this.

1133
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:15,461
Doesn't exist,
far as I'm concerned.

1134
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:16,627
(sighs)

1135
01:11:16,668 --> 01:11:19,637
I sure am sorry about all this.

1136
01:11:19,671 --> 01:11:20,639
Good day.

1137
01:11:20,672 --> 01:11:22,333
Thank you, Henry.

1138
01:11:25,176 --> 01:11:27,145

1139

(thunder rumbling)

1141
01:11:47,466 --> 01:11:49,457
(wind blowing)

1142
01:11:53,305 --> 01:11:54,828
(grunting)

1143
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:58,867
(whispering):
Winnie.

1144
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:03,114
Jesse!

1145
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:05,640
Oh, it's you.

1146
01:12:05,684 --> 01:12:08,345
I was afraid
I would never see you again.

1147
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:09,877
I need you to help me.

1148
01:12:09,921 --> 01:12:12,550
I need you to help us.

1149
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:15,219
Mae can't go to the gallows.

1150
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:16,887
She won't die.

1151
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:18,953
She can't die.

1152
01:12:18,997 --> 01:12:22,592
They're going to find out
our secret.

1153
01:12:22,635 --> 01:12:25,069
We have to get them out.

1154
01:12:31,342 --> 01:12:33,675
(thunder crashing)

1155
01:12:42,787 --> 01:12:43,755
WINNIE:
Help me!

1156
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:44,756
(pounding on glass)

1157
01:12:44,789 --> 01:12:45,756
Please, help me!

1158
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:46,757
Somebody, help me!

1159
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:48,657
Please, someone help!

1160
01:12:48,694 --> 01:12:49,752
(lively melody plays)

1161
01:12:49,795 --> 01:12:50,761
Please! Help!

1162
01:12:50,796 --> 01:12:51,921
All right.

1163
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:53,591
Help me, please!

1164
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:54,689
All right!

1165
01:12:54,733 --> 01:12:55,699
Help!

1166
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:57,759
PI... Please!

1167
01:12:57,802 --> 01:12:59,667
Help me! You have to stop them!

1168
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:00,729
They're after me!

1169
01:13:00,773 --> 01:13:03,037
Miss F... Miss Fo...
Who's after you?

1170
01:13:03,074 --> 01:13:04,132
The people who kidnapped me!

1171
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:05,541
They're going
to take me away again!

1172
01:13:05,578 --> 01:13:06,738
My parents couldn't stop them!

1173
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:08,405
They're right outside!

1174
01:13:08,447 --> 01:13:10,711
You have to stop them, please!

1175
01:13:10,748 --> 01:13:11,716
Help!

1176
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,341
They'll kill me if they find me!

1177
01:13:13,385 --> 01:13:15,409
Please, they're going
to kill me, please!

1178
01:13:15,453 --> 01:13:16,579
Stay right there!

1179
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:17,782
I'll handle this.

1180
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,119
Hurry!

1181
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:20,625
(thunder rumbling)

1182
01:13:20,658 --> 01:13:23,389
Help!

01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:25,396

(thunder crashing)

1187
01:13:39,478 --> 01:13:41,412
Come out and meet your doom!

1188
01:13:41,512 --> 01:13:42,912
(thunder crashing)

1189
01:13:42,948 --> 01:13:44,141
Hell is upon you!

01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:48,117
(thunder rumbling)

1191
01:13:48,153 --> 01:13:50,484
Stop right there!

1192
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,118
You're under arrest!

1193
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:55,386
(thunder crashes)

1194
01:13:55,426 --> 01:13:57,417

1195
01:13:57,462 --> 01:13:59,988
Come on, we have to hurry.

1196
01:14:00,032 --> 01:14:02,261
The boys are outside.

1197
01:14:02,301 --> 01:14:03,927
Stay back, now!

1198
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:06,301
I'll shoot!

1199
01:14:07,706 --> 01:14:08,331
(yelps)

1200
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:12,238

(thunder rumbling)

(door shuts)

1210
01:14:57,155 --> 01:14:59,123
My dear, sweet Winnie.

1211
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:02,024
What I wouldn't do to keep you.

1212
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:09,195
I wish you were ours...
for Jesse.

1213
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:12,533
For all of us.

1214
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:16,439
(crying):
You have to hurry
and get away from here.

1215
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:19,170
JESSE:
Winnie...

1216
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:21,202
Winnie, come with me.

1217
01:15:21,246 --> 01:15:22,439
There's nothing for you here.

1218
01:15:22,514 --> 01:15:23,673
We can be together forever.

1219
01:15:23,716 --> 01:15:26,707
If she comes with us,
they'll hunt us down.

1220
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:28,685
They'll never stop looking.

1221
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,779
Tuck is right.

1222
01:15:29,822 --> 01:15:31,083
If I go with you

1223
01:15:31,122 --> 01:15:34,091
it'll be too dangerous
for all of you.

1224
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:39,493
I can't go without you.

1225
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,863
(crying)

1226
01:15:46,872 --> 01:15:48,863
You have to.

1227
01:15:52,744 --> 01:15:54,770
Go back to the spring.

1228
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:56,404
Drink from it.

1229
01:15:56,481 --> 01:15:59,780
When it's safe...
I'll come back for you.

1230
01:15:59,818 --> 01:16:01,409
Will you?

1231
01:16:01,453 --> 01:16:03,784
I have to show you
the Eiffel Tower, don't I?

1232
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:08,259
1,652 steps to the top.

1233
01:16:08,292 --> 01:16:09,590
Winnie...

1234
01:16:09,627 --> 01:16:12,529
until we're together again...

1235
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:14,793
wake up with the dawn.

1236
01:16:14,832 --> 01:16:17,563
I will.

1237
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:20,697
We got to go...
before it's too late.

1238
01:16:31,149 --> 01:16:32,548
(straps snap)

Winnie Foster...

1241
01:16:36,954 --> 01:16:39,947
I will love you
till the day I die!

DOCTOR (whispering):
She's going fast

1246
01:17:28,974 --> 01:17:31,636
but you can have a couple
of minutes with her.

1247
01:17:31,676 --> 01:17:33,007
(footsteps)

1248
01:17:35,546 --> 01:17:36,945
How are you?

Mother?

1266
01:19:13,112 --> 01:19:15,079
I was just wondering

1267
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:18,105
what it is about these woods
you love so much.

1268
01:19:23,988 --> 01:19:26,287
Mother, are you all right?

01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:15,465
I just wanted to keep you
my little girl forever.

1282
01:20:15,573 --> 01:20:19,408
(sobbing)

1283
01:20:19,444 --> 01:20:22,412
(water trickling)

1284
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:24,438
# #

1285
01:20:34,393 --> 01:20:36,087
# #

1286
01:20:36,127 --> 01:20:38,426
(frog croaking)

1287
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,971
JESSE (echoing):
Go back to the spring.

1288
01:20:50,007 --> 01:20:53,774
When it's safe,
I'll come back for you.

1289
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:04,110
ANGUS:
What we Tucks have,
you can't call it living.

1290
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:07,454
We just... are.

1291
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:12,657
We're like rocks stuck
at the side of a stream.

1292
01:21:23,307 --> 01:21:25,298
(birds twittering)

1293
01:21:27,613 --> 01:21:30,479
(motor running)

1294
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:34,006
NARRATOR:
The first weeks of summer
were long over.

1295
01:21:36,454 --> 01:21:38,082
There was a feeling

1296
01:21:38,122 --> 01:21:40,454
that the wheel
was turning again...

1297
01:21:42,793 --> 01:21:45,786
...slowly now,
but soon to go faster.

1298
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:56,466
Winnie and her family
left Treegap to see the world.

1299
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,439
She wasn't certain
what herjourney might bring

1300
01:22:06,484 --> 01:22:08,453
but this much she knew...

1301
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:12,148
it would be something
of her own choosing.

1302
01:22:15,493 --> 01:22:17,859
(bell tolling)

1303
01:22:18,863 --> 01:22:20,989
# #

1304
01:22:31,007 --> 01:22:32,998
# #

1305
01:22:42,953 --> 01:22:44,944
# #

1306
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:49,783
(engine stops)

1307
01:22:52,796 --> 01:22:56,893
For some, time passes slowly.

1308
01:22:56,934 --> 01:23:01,029
An hour can seem an eternity.

1309
01:23:01,072 --> 01:23:05,770
For others,
there's never enough.

1310
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:10,247
For Jesse Tuck,
it didn't exist.

1311
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:32,451
Tuck said it to Winnie
the summer she turned 15:

1312
01:24:32,496 --> 01:24:37,729
Do not fear death,
but rather the unlived life.

1313
01:24:37,768 --> 01:24:40,828
You don't have to live forever.

1314
01:24:40,871 --> 01:24:43,065
You just have to live.

1315
01:24:43,106 --> 01:24:45,439
And she did.
