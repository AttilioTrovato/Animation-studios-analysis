1
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:17,073
Times are changing.

2
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:19,905
I'm Ed Sullivan. And this is Broadway.

3
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:29,121
I have a dream.

4
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,062
I am the greatest!

5
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:42,491
By the content
of their character.

6
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:56,741
Hey. You guys are playing like girls.

7
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:58,751
Are you kiddin' me?

8
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:02,084
Hey, hey, Winnaker,
do you want me to get you a skirt?

9
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:04,624
I'll get you a skirt
if you keep playing like a girl.

10
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:07,217
There it is, there it is.
Come on, set it up.

11
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:10,229
Bring it down, bring it down.
Set it up! Set it up!

12
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:14,358
There it is. Pop the ball.
Pop it in there, pop it in there.

13
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,869
All right, good. There it is.

14
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,808
Congratulations, Coach.

15
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:35,316
Unh!

16
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:43,024
- That's good. That's perfect.
- OK. You do that.

17
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:54,502
Get your arm up. There it is.
That's good, that's perfect.

18
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:56,943
You go like this.

19
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,878
- Shush.

20
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:00,939
All right. Here you go.

21
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,608
- My dad can slam-dunk it.
- Let me do it. Let me do it, Dad!

22
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:08,123
Great. All right, Mark, that's good.
That's good ball-handling.

23
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,988
Brent, you ready? This is a bounce pass.

24
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,729
- It's all right. You'll live.

25
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:21,965
- It wasn't me. It was Dad.
- Traitor.

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm not getting in trouble.

27
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,538
Catch it with your hands,
not your arms.

28
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,570
Hello.

29
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:32,673
This is Don.

30
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:36,879
We know you blew out your knee.
It's tough, giving up a dream, starting over,

31
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:40,787
but I'm glad to hear you're interested
in a coaching position, Mr. Haskins.

32
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:43,291
McCarty here says you're a winner.

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,228
I sure appreciate that.
Now, my style of coaching is one that...

34
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:51,064
You played for Mr. Iba, so you know
how to reign in these unruly boys.

35
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:54,798
Sir, I do believe in discipline.
Now, my basketball philosophy is...

36
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:59,832
Mr. Haskins. You know, we're a small
school and we can't pay very much.

37
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:03,870
So we're gonna need you to live
in the men's dorm with your family

38
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:07,384
and keep those boys in line over there.

39
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:09,750
But your meals are free at the cafeteria.

40
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:16,056
And you got plenty of Texas sunshine.
So... how's it sound?

41
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:23,031
If that's what it takes
to coach Division I basketball, then...

42
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,400
ha-ha-ha, that's all right with me.

43
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,704
It's just a dusty old cow town.

44
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:32,403
Yeah, but if it's got a court with a roof
and uniforms that match,

45
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,970
then I wanna coach there.
I wanna play against the best.

46
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,744
I just wanted to thank you
for bringing me on.

47
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,409
Us Aggies gotta stick together.

48
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,478
- You've been here a few weeks.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,455
What you think?

50
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:50,723
It ain't much, but we can do something
with it. Here we go. Ready?

51
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:53,698
This is where you're gonna be living.

52
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,324
Hey, Coach.

53
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,928
Ross Moore, team trainer
and spiritual advisor.

54
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,838
We're gonna need some of that.
This is my wife, Mary.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,206
Hi, Mrs. Haskins. Come on in here.

56
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,404
- Hate to put you out.
- Oh, no.

57
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,674
You ain't putting me out.
Don't think about it.

58
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,013
I'm thinking about leaving
this prize gator here for you.

59
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,781
- Makes a fine ceiling ornament.
- Cool.

60
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,412
You hear that? I made up my mind.

61
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,617
That little boy love that gator.
I'm gonna leave him there.

62
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,992
I've been checking the cupboard.
It's a little bare.

63
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,430
We got Baudoin outta Albuquerque,
20 points a game last year.

64
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,631
Got us a Missouri boy. Fast and tough
on defense - a kid named Armstrong.

65
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,768
David Palacio,
he's the top prep scorer in El Paso.

66
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,938
Waiting on junior-college transfers.

67
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:44,348
And Jerry in Housing says
on taco night, we get a real good crowd.

68
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,113
Taco night?

69
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,853
Taco night.

70
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,589
What's the budget for recruiting?

71
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,562
Ross says the budget's in the lights.

72
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,499
How can I have a winning team
with no budget for recruiting?

73
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:10,477
Now, listen, Coach. Football is king here.

74
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:13,070
And basketball sucks hind tit.

75
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:17,380
I'll shake down the boosters for a few more
bucks, get a couple more scholarships.

76
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:18,885
A few more bucks?

77
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:22,617
I gotta go find players. How can I recruit
with one or two scholarships?

78
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:27,026
Do you forget where you come from, Don?
Coaching high school girls.

79
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:30,998
Take a look around you.
This ain't Kansas, Duke, Kentucky.

80
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:35,265
We're a poor school that counts
every penny to pay for a river rat's dream

81
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:36,862
of a college education.

82
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,339
We're lucky to put a decent team
on the court.

83
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:41,933
Well, decent don't cut it with me.

84
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,705
Duke's where you wanna go.

85
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:49,580
Hey, how you doing?
Don Haskins, Texas Western.

86
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:51,552
How you doing? Don Haskins.

87
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,526
- See anyone you like?
- What about number three over there?

88
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:59,926
Jason Stevens out of Chicago.
18 points a game.

89
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:02,830
Hasn't signed a letter of intent yet.

90
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,696
Jason!

91
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:06,702
Beating a dead horse there, Don.

92
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,103
- Jason, Don Haskins, Texas Western.
- Western Union?

93
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,368
Texas Western, down in El Paso.

94
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:15,809
After the game, I'd like to talk to you
about playing for me.

95
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,146
Play for you at Texas Western?
Thanks, Coach, but I'm partial to winning.

96
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:29,389
How about that big ol' tall boy?
Made All-Jayhawk Conference last year.

97
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,429
Gonna sign with Kansas.

98
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:04,424
You wanna talk to Bobby Joe Hill?

99
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:07,294
Son, you can't win playing nigger ball.

100
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:10,494
Sure, they can jump, but they can't lead.

101
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,333
Can't handle the pressure.
Don't have enough intelligence.

102
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:16,499
That boy in particular.
No-account smart-mouth.

103
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:19,167
Just tell me where I can find him.

104
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:25,444
Excuse me. I'm the basketball coach
down at Texas Western.

105
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:28,646
- I'd like to talk to you about playing there.
- No, thanks.

106
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:32,522
I'm done playing this game.
They hardly put me on the floor tonight.

107
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,787
- I'm offering a full scholarship.
- Uh-huh.

108
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:38,729
You sign me up like your token Negro,
bury me at the end of the bench.

109
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,528
I'd rather hang it up. Do something else.

110
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:45,332
Be the next Smokey Robinson.
I might even run for president.

111
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:48,738
You got a real talent, son.
Why throw it away?

112
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:54,303
I'll tell you why. Ever since I was a kid, I
only loved one thing - that was playing ball.

113
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,840
Do you understand what that's like,
to have that ball in your hand?

114
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,386
It's like making sweet music
with your game.

115
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:04,083
Only thing is,
you don't wanna hear the song.

116
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,892
You talk a good game, Hill.

117
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:14,534
I didn't come here to find a player
I could sit on the bench.

118
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:18,436
I intend to start you -
start NCAA Division One ball.

119
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:22,943
What is it with you, mister?
I've accepted it. What are you smoking?

120
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,976
I ain't smoking nothing, son.

121
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:32,883
Now, you just told me about a big old
dream you have. I can let you play.

122
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:38,221
I can help you make your dream come true
faster than a twister'll take your socks off.

123
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:45,088
You talk funny.

124
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,397
So do you.

125
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,903
You gonna let a black player play
from the get-go?

126
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:54,237
I don't see color. I see quick,
I see skill, and that's what you have.

127
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,643
And that's what I'm putting on the court.

128
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:08,618
So, what is this team, anyway?

129
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:11,626
All right, that New York recruiter,
Hilton White.

130
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:14,925
He's got three boys up there now.
They're just playground kids.

131
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:17,295
He said they could play with anybody.

132
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:21,928
Every one of these players
you're looking at is colored, Don.

133
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,834
How many are you recruiting?

134
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:28,366
We need seven players on this team
who can put it in the hole and rebound.

135
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,811
Now, if they're colored, well, fine.

136
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,744
Well, then now, Coach,
let me try to paint you a little picture.

137
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:39,414
There are no coloreds playing
Division One basketball in the South.

138
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,325
Not in the SEC, not in the ACC
and not in the SWC.

139
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,862
But you go and put seven of 'em
on our team.

140
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,195
Am I losing my hearing?
Do I need a darn hearing aid?

141
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:53,168
No, Ross. I intend to win.

142
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:57,700
Shoot. You carrying on like Negroes
gonna be the future of basketball.

143
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,675
Could you imagine that?

144
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,810
There are rules. Unwritten rules.

145
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:07,341
You play one at home, two on the road
and three if you're losing.

146
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:10,854
Lord have mercy. Loadin' up
on Negroes, that just ain't done.

147
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:16,224
You gonna put your career at risk,
my career at risk and Moe's career at risk.

148
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:20,162
If that wasn't bad enough, we ain't
even got enough gas money to get home.

149
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:22,722
Ain't it lucky you don't got
to worry about that?

150
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,860
'Cause you'll be out on the first bus
to New York tomorrow.

151
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:30,568
You're sending me there for schoolyard
players? You gotta be out of your mind.

152
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:33,441
And who's paying for all this,
if you don't mind me asking?

153
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:37,676
You wanna win. You gotta
recruit. That's how the big boys do it.

154
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,025
It was a good game, man.

155
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:50,118
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

156
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:53,164
Mama baked a pie. One piece left,
it's got my name all over it.

157
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:56,133
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

158
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:00,737
- You know that guy?
- What? No.

159
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,207
Kid, you got a minute?

160
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,335
Run. Run!

161
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:11,674
Hey, Charlie!

162
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:19,824
Hey, Mama. You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me and Alvin.

163
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:22,953
Almost got jumped
by a couple of crackers.

164
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,361
I'm just dying for a piece of that...

165
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:28,162
...pie.
- Ma'am, this pie is so good,

166
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,499
it makes me mad at my mama.

167
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,972
This is Mr. Haskins.
He come all the way from El Paso, Texas.

168
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,373
He want you to play basketball
on a scholarship.

169
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:39,436
Texas? To get lynched?

170
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:44,746
Now, El Paso's not like the rest of Texas.
It's, um... It's more cosmopolitan.

171
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:47,185
Pops already got me a good job
at the factory...

172
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:50,451
- I always wanted an education for Harry.
- They got schools here.

173
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:54,358
I don't feel comfortable
sending my boy that far away

174
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:56,896
and trusting him to a stranger.

175
00:11:56,964 --> 00:12:02,335
I know. I understand. I will look
after him like he's one of my own.

176
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:06,636
- You ate my pie.
- We're church people around here.

177
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,006
Are you?

178
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,545
I won't lie.
I hadn't been to church in so long,

179
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:19,109
I can't remember
which day of the week it falls on.

180
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:22,452
I'm ashamed to say I'm... I'm just a wretch.

181
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:25,682
Well...

182
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:30,028
We all fall short.
And we're saved by grace.

183
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,728
- Tell me more about El Paso.
- No, Mama. Mama, come on, now.

184
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:39,139
It's lovely, ma'am. It's right on the banks
of the Rio Grande. It's a little oasis.

185
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,737
Nah.

186
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,440
- I got plenty of offers.
- Yeah?

187
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,645
From who? Duke? Kansas?

188
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,846
- I'm playing for the Globetrotters.
- It's probably for the best.

189
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:59,725
You're better off with the Trotters
playing its team of patsies every night.

190
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:05,360
You can't get past an average defender in
our league with that fancy dribble of yours.

191
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:08,303
Man, no offense, but that's bull.

192
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,897
Hey, brother, no offense,
but without work,

193
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,841
I don't think you'd get past
a beat-up old-timer like me.

194
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,641
Get past you?

195
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:23,350
I would go past you, through you,
over you, under you, around you.

196
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,150
As a matter of fact,
I'll spin you like a top,

197
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,852
eat your lunch, steal your girl
and kick your dog at the same time.

198
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:32,256
Get past you.

199
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,664
- Come on, Orsten!
- Hey, come on.

200
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:37,759
Do your thang.

201
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:39,736
- You fouling me.
- You call that a foul?

202
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:42,739
My three year old calls that a love tap.

203
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,807
Ooh! Come on, man.

204
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:49,574
Hey, hold it, hold it.

205
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:52,844
You expect me to react to all
that head-shake and body gyration?

206
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,408
It's activity without accomplishment.

207
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:59,150
You got the ball in front of you.
You ain't going anywhere without it.

208
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:02,991
Try this. It's called a rocker step.
You ready? Get in your stance.

209
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,189
OK?

210
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:08,062
The difference between me and you
is I got the ball protected.

211
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:11,433
It looks like I'm starting to dribble,
so you react, and when you do,

212
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:14,268
cross over, dribble right by you.

213
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,706
Try it. It's simple, but it'll make
that pretty little shot of yours work.

214
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:28,077
First time. There it is.

215
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,319
Excuse me!

216
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:34,485
I'm looking for three guys. Uh...

217
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,587
Names of Nevil Shed,

218
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:41,259
Willie Worsley and Willie Cager.

219
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:43,768
They're colored boys.
You know them?

220
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:46,305
- Did he say "colored"?
- He said what I think he did.

221
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:47,533
Yeah.

222
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:52,237
And I don't think he was talking
about no television set, neither.

223
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:54,007
He got a nice car.

224
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,447
These New York kids may be
from the street, but they sure can play.

225
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,280
Little guard plays like a giant.

226
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:02,048
Forward runs like an antelope.
Never seen anything like him.

227
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:04,887
- How long till you can have 'em out?
- A week maybe.

228
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,757
How's it with Lattin?
These boys play big, but they ain't big.

229
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,194
Hey!

230
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:11,857
You want me to fill this thing up?

231
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:14,094
I called his coach, but he run me off.

232
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,636
I still got one more roll of these dice,
though.

233
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:18,695
And one more little thing, Don.

234
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:20,866
I had a little misunderstanding here.

235
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,672
Do you think you could wire me
another hundred dollars?

236
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,088
Where on earth's this coach taking us?

237
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:44,826
I don't think we're even
on earth anymore, brah.

238
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,697
- Say, Willie.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:48,668
- You got a dime?
- For what?

240
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:53,340
I gotta call my mama.
Tell her I'm an astronaut.

241
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:55,808
Looks like we're the first black men
on the moon.

242
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,977
What's this dead stuff
on the side of the road?

243
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:03,142
Players from last year's team
trying to crawl back to New York.

244
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:05,380
We driving into hell, plain and simple.

245
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:08,891
El Paso, Texas! Ain't no place like it.

246
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:13,659
Big ol' west Texas sun shining down
about 330 days a year.

247
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,755
Yes, sir, you're in God's country now.

248
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:20,166
If this is God's country, obviously
the good Lord don't want no neighbors.

249
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:27,174
Say, man,
this place looks like Bonanza.

250
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:30,770
Hey, look, just smile at 'em
and say "howdy."

251
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:32,041
Howdy.

252
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:38,680
To him you gotta say "hole-ah."
Like this, see.

253
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,189
Hole-ah!

254
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:44,353
- Man, what this "hole-ah" mean?
- It means, "Hello, Puerto Ricans."

255
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:47,226
You've signed some black players, Don?

256
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,526
That's right.

257
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:51,033
Seven of them?

258
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:56,765
I'm not sure that all the boosters
are gonna like it. All right?

259
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,105
It's a little different
than what they're used to.

260
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:03,010
You hired me to put a team together -
that's what I'm doing.

261
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,641
No, Don.

262
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:09,016
I hired you to ride herd
on the athletic dorm.

263
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:12,318
I've got a little more
than I bargained for.

264
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,157
Those our new teammates?

265
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:18,661
Ross said things
were gonna be different.

266
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,722
Doesn't look like he was kidding.

267
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,327
- I ain't never seen one of them before.
- One what?

268
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:27,701
One of them - a colored.

269
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,672
You've gotta get off the farm more.

270
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:33,472
I'll have some of that and some of this
and some of that.

271
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:36,344
- Save a brother some scraps.
- Back off, midget.

272
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:38,906
Who you calling midget?
You big-toothed clown.

273
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:41,818
Grab your red hat and lantern
and get back on the front lawn.

274
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,912
I'll let you know
when the full-sized men are done eating.

275
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,723
Easy, choppers. I seen Pontiacs with
smaller grilles than those teeth of yours.

276
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:52,855
- Taco, nacho, burrito?
- No. I'm looking for hot dog-o.

277
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:55,924
Taco, nacho, burrito?

278
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:58,596
No, no. Hot dog-o.

279
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:00,366
Hot dog-o.

280
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,270
Nacho?

281
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:20,859
What are you lookin' at?
Ain't you never seen a black man before?

282
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:26,159
Yeah, I've seen plenty of folks like you.

283
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,127
So, are you from Harlem?

284
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:33,661
- You think all blacks are from Harlem?
- Are all of you from Mayberry?

285
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,302
- Take it easy. He didn't mean nothin'.
- Mind your business, man.

286
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:42,077
Hey, look, guys. My name's Togo Railey.
I'm from El Paso.

287
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,544
Where y'all from?

288
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:52,084
Bobby Joe Hill, from Detroit.

289
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,290
Yeah, I'm Willie Cager, South Bronx.

290
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,355
Forward.

291
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:05,228
Jerry Armstrong, Eagleville, Missouri.
All-State, 19 boards a game.

292
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:07,502
Starting forward.

293
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:12,944
Whoo!

294
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:15,279
- Go, Miners.
- That's it, Jerry.

295
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,313
Harry Flournoy.

296
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:20,287
Gary, Indiana.

297
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:23,222
United Steel Mill day shift.

298
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,886
The starting forward.

299
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:35,366
Back to the cows, Jethro.

300
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:38,930
Come on, Flournoy, get that.
Get it, Flournoy. Get it, get it!

301
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

302
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,039
Throw the ball, come on!

303
00:19:57,227 --> 00:20:01,926
- Hey, hold the basket still, bite-size.
- Orsten, shut your tusk! Cager! Cager!

304
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:03,795
Get off me.

305
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:09,233
Cager! Cager!
Downtown, Willie, take it downtown!

306
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,069
Oh!

307
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:14,578
- You moved the basket!
- Advantage black man, for once.

308
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,579
What? What, farm boy? What?

309
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:19,878
Hold up! Get over here!

310
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,982
This is just another example
that knuckleheads

311
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:27,421
come in all sizes, shapes and colors.

312
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:29,823
You're pitiful. Pitiful!

313
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:34,357
Messing around down here
like a bunch of kindergarten kids.

314
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,266
Now, you get this place cleaned up
and try to act like you got some sense.

315
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:41,430
- You think you can do that?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:52,012
You son of a gun. You got David Lattin
to come here and play basketball.

317
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,277
It's David Lattin.

318
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,880
I used to read about him in the paper.

319
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,392
How in the world did you swing that?

320
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,965
How you doin', brother?

321
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,270
Should have left your hand out.
Might have gave ya a tip.

322
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:20,312
Man, I'll bust that big ox
upside his head.

323
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,813
Worsley.
You know it'd take three men your size

324
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,908
to rip that boy's picture in half.

325
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:38,824
My old man wants me working
on that farm.

326
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:42,665
He thinks playing basketball
is a waste of time.

327
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,730
I think different.

328
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,208
- You the new players?
- Yeah, that's right.

329
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:53,576
- You don't look like much to me, guys.
- Whoa, whoa. Easy, bro.

330
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,673
- You lookin' at the new Mighty Miners.
- Mighty Miners?

331
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,777
You're at a hole-digging college.
A commuter school.

332
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:05,484
Playing for a girls' basketball coach.
The Mighty Miners. Ha-ha!

333
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,550
That's funny.

334
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,365
What is he talking about,
girls' basketball coach?

335
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:17,530
You're here to learn fundamental,
disciplined defensive basketball.

336
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:21,837
Now, that means discipline
both on and off the court.

337
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,900
No girls.

338
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:26,469
No booze. No late nights.

339
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:29,880
Nothing besides fundamental basketball.

340
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,618
I speak, you listen.

341
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:38,455
I don't wanna hear "can't" or "won't"
or "Coach, I'm bleeding."

342
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:42,759
I don't wanna hear anything
except the basketball bounce.

343
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:48,997
You play basketball my way.
My way's hard.

344
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:52,370
Especially if your guard's wearing a skirt.

345
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:57,678
What's the matter?
You got mud on your feet?

346
00:22:57,746 --> 00:23:01,944
Move those feet! Get down, get low, son!
Come on, come on!

347
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:05,145
Now, we do not play defense standing up!
Get your butt down!

348
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,348
Lower! Make it uncomfortable!
There you go.

349
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:13,621
What's the matter, son?
Your skirt bothering ya?

350
00:23:13,697 --> 00:23:17,565
Come on, come on, Lattin, go hard!
Lock him down.

351
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:18,828
You in my office!

352
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,962
Shed, what was that?
You let him put his armpits in the rim.

353
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:23,665
Are you kiddin' me?

354
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,767
We do not back down here, ever!

355
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:30,369
You own this part of the court!

356
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:33,143
And, Lattin, I said no dunking.

357
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,285
Now, let's do it again, come on.

358
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:39,151
Nice shot, big man.

359
00:23:39,222 --> 00:23:41,783
Excuse me, Wilt. Big ox.

360
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:45,420
Keep your hand out there a little
longer. Somebody might give you a tip.

361
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:50,399
Shed, what's up? You looking like Lattin's
shadow out here. Big guy like you scared.

362
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:53,801
Not as scared as you when I come after
you with a fly swatter, ya leprechaun.

363
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:48,554
Don't touch my stuff, brother.

364
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:51,392
Leave that to the big boys.

365
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:55,798
Probably ain't even heard of the Panthers
back in Indiana.

366
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:58,234
- Man, I know about 'em.

367
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:01,705
It's one thing to know about 'em.
It's another to live the life.

368
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:04,743
Well, I don't need a book
to live a life.

369
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,705
Brothers! Mm.
We crossin' the bridge tonight.

370
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:13,217
I hear Juarez is jumpin'
with some fine gals.

371
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:16,950
What are you gonna do when you find
'em, fool? You don't speak Español.

372
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:20,687
- This don't need no translation.
- Coach Haskins set the rules.

373
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:25,095
He has his rules, I got mine. Rule number
one: Let's get into some trouble.

374
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:28,828
- Come on!
- Willie Worsley needs the ladies.

375
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:33,771
- Better be some girls there too, brother.
- You don't know what to do with 'em.

376
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:36,674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

377
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,937
Peace, brother.

378
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:40,673
- You know we got practice in the a.m.
- Well, good.

379
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,911
You stay here
and you get a good headstart.

380
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:09,700
- I'm going back. Somebody come with me.
- Hey, relax, Shed. Just smile.

381
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,938
Everybody try to look Mexican.

382
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:14,073
I'm six foot three.

383
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:18,779
Try to look like three Mexicans, then.
How you doin'? All right.

384
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:31,322
- Worsley, you next.
- No, no, no, no.

385
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,029
Elijah Muhammad and the Black Muslims
say that liquor steals a man's mind.

386
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:38,232
Man, Elijah Muhammad never played
for a crazy white man.

387
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:41,174
Excuse me, señor. Señor?

388
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:44,179
You mind fillin' this shot glass up
with some cold water?

389
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:46,977
My man Worsley wants to take a swim.

390
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:49,810
Oh! Oh!

391
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:55,713
Seriously, I'm not busting
my butt out there for him anymore.

392
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:58,784
They're using us,
so I'm gonna use 'em right back.

393
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:00,921
Education is the key, guys.

394
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,658
Blah, blah, blah.

395
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:06,531
Hey, hey. Educate this.

396
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:09,603
- Hey, sweet thing.
- Gracias.

397
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:11,968
What's your name?

398
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:15,774
Why do you need to know my name?
You ain't gonna be usin' it.

399
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:18,041
You all business tonight?

400
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:21,380
Looks like a cold night
in Mexico for you, boy.

401
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,317
Doing OK, Tina?

402
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:28,984
Hey, listen.
I was just playing with you back there.

403
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,528
My name is Bobby Joe.

404
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:34,792
My friends call me Bobby Joe.

405
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:38,392
Tina.
And I go to the same school you do.

406
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:42,462
And I'm not about to fall
for that smooth-talking Negro routine.

407
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,908
- My mama warned me about you.
- Your mama don't even know me.

408
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:50,347
She said watch out for pretty boys
with big smiles, worn shoes,

409
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:52,508
and single dollars in their pockets.

410
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:57,112
Well, that's not me.
I'm telling you, you got me all wrong.

411
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,699
Cómo estás. Everybody?

412
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:22,647
What was that, son?
I didn't get that.

413
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:28,545
How is everybody today?
Feeling all right?

414
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:30,782
You OK, Bobby Joe?

415
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:37,558
Hey, I hear you speak Spanish, right?

416
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,622
- Sir?
- I'm just wondering.

417
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,298
You looking a little tired. All that fancy
footwork of yours tire you out yesterday?

418
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:48,864
Or was it something else?

419
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,177
Now, because some of you were bitten
by the evil worm last night,

420
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:56,307
this morning, all of you are gonna run.

421
00:28:56,383 --> 00:29:00,046
- The evil worm never bit me!
- Hundred lines! Let's do it! Let's sprint!

422
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,850
Lattin, get to the baseline, son.

423
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:08,055
Y'all are gonna burn holes
in your shoes today!

424
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:13,896
You look like you're running in mud, son!
Are you kiddin' me? Are you kiddin' me?

425
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:16,698
Hill, get your butt down.

426
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:21,970
There's 31 days before the season starts,
and you're gonna run every one of 'em.

427
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:25,169
Oh, that was pretty.
Hey, that was real pretty.

428
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:29,205
Everybody see that behind-the-back?
The circus has come to town.

429
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,684
- What are you doing?
- I'm just playing my game.

430
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:35,655
We're playing my game here.
All that other stuff's just insecurity.

431
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:43,426
Great players make simple, basic,
easy plays. Showboating's just insecurity.

432
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:47,258
He didn't want us playing our game?
Why'd he bring us here?

433
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:50,999
- Man, I'm sick of him riding my butt.
- I don't need this, man!

434
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:54,201
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Yes, you do.

435
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:04,175
This ain't basketball. You killing us!

436
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:08,587
Well, from where I'm standing,
you don't got much to bargain with.

437
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:10,557
What?

438
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:13,619
You wanna quit?

439
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,196
You wanna quit?

440
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:21,897
You quit right now,
you'll quit every day the rest of your life.

441
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:32,138
Watch.

442
00:30:56,474 --> 00:31:01,104
Don't worry.
Gunsmoke wasn't that good tonight.

443
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:03,238
How was the practice?

444
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,181
That good, huh?

445
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:12,779
Come on! Move those feet!
Move the ball, faster! Faster!

446
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:17,286
Get off me, farm boy.

447
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:20,331
- Quit your crying, Harlem.
- I told you I wasn't from Harlem!

448
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,890
Knock it off! Knock it...

449
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:26,768
Knock it off! Knock it off!
Knock it off! Knock it off!

450
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,297
You'd done that in a game,
it'd be a technical foul for fighting.

451
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,469
Both of you'd be ejected.
Probably cost us the game, son.

452
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:37,242
Baseline, everybody. Y'all gonna run
'cause of their selfishness.

453
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:39,841
Two weeks before the game,
and you still don't listen.

454
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:44,184
Class, make sure can you identify
all the minerals in your boxes.

455
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:49,661
I'll be passing around to your stations,
so if you have any problems, let me know.

456
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:01,602
This team does not play playground ball.

457
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:05,872
We play fundamental, disciplined
defensive basketball.

458
00:32:05,945 --> 00:32:08,880
Togo? Hey, show Mr. Cager
how to make a shot.

459
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:15,585
There you go.

460
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:20,151
- You want me to do that?
- Mm-hm.

461
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:23,993
Come on, Coach. What about my stylin'?
I got way too much style to do that.

462
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:29,434
You leave the styling for the barber shop.
Just show me you belong in the NCAA.

463
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,376
OK, guys.

464
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,055
You're a smart kid, Harry.

465
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:51,786
But these grades ain't pulling the truck
up the hill.

466
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,887
It's just that every class is about rocks,
and I'm a black man. I don't do rocks.

467
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:57,295
Mm-hm.

468
00:32:57,365 --> 00:33:01,529
You got two weeks to get your grades up.
Or else.

469
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:03,901
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

470
00:33:06,775 --> 00:33:08,538
- How'd it go?
- What's he gonna do?

471
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,272
He's already run our asses ragged.

472
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:15,115
She's a great girl.

473
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,983
Mm! What's that girl?

474
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:22,852
- Is she cute?
- No.

475
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:25,894
- Yeah.
- She's a cutie pie, but she's not cute.

476
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:40,037
Who can tell me the field classification
of phaneritic rocks?

477
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:42,236
My son Harry can.

478
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:43,867
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:47,882
- Granite, syenite and gabbro.

480
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,248
Can anybody tell me
how they are formed?

481
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,289
Yes, ma'am. Harry can.

482
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,492
- By slow cooling plutons?
- And what is a pluton?

483
00:33:58,562 --> 00:34:00,257
Harry.

484
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:05,828
It is a deep-seated igneous intrusion
with no visible floor.

485
00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:07,130
Very good, Harry.

486
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:13,399
You know I love you, but...

487
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:15,945
Nah, I can't. I can't do that. Not again.

488
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:19,813
Please, baby.
Don't make me do it again. Please.

489
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,290
Ah!

490
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,927
Don't ever enter
when I'm entertaining a lady friend!

491
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:40,834
- I didn't know.
- Check that vent!

492
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:44,568
I told you when that vent's open,
it's too hot for you to come in here.

493
00:34:44,642 --> 00:34:47,008
- Hey, man, cool down, man.
- You dig?

494
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:49,308
OK. OK.

495
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,591
Shed.

496
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:04,788
- Come on, brother.
- Here we go now.

497
00:35:04,863 --> 00:35:06,888
Can't be good for his back.

498
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:09,193
Shed.

499
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:11,600
Have you even slept
in your bed yet?

500
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,367
Hey, it's time for practice.
You've been sleeping out here all night.

501
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:18,035
Rise and shine. Like you used to it.

502
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:24,178
Here, man. Go buy yourself a hot dog-o.

503
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:38,387
Gimme your base. Balls of your feet.

504
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:40,956
Get your arms up. Get your arms up.
There you go.

505
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:53,280
I know I told you not to dunk, but if he's
playing that weak, slam it down his throat.

506
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:57,340
You know what, Shed? You're like a duck.
You wake up in a new world every day.

507
00:35:57,418 --> 00:36:00,285
Waitress down at Dairy Queen's
tougher than you are.

508
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:05,223
All right. Hey, move your feet.
Come on, get back to the practice.

509
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:11,892
- Well, there's seven of them.
- Actually, there's 12 in all.

510
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:15,595
Yeah, but seven of the other ones.

511
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,982
Coach...

512
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:30,483
You're going home.

513
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:33,477
Home? What are you talking about?

514
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:36,353
Too afraid to rebound and defend.
You're too soft.

515
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:39,450
- That's why I'm sending you home.
- Ah, come on! No!

516
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:42,861
The season's two days away.
You can't send me home!

517
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:46,196
I can't have a big man
that's afraid to play like one.

518
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:48,395
- No.
- There's your ticket.

519
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:53,438
Coach. Please!

520
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:57,377
I'll never be able to look my daddy
in the eye again! Coach!

521
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:18,860
Look at those moves! Look at how
he slices the defense! He's unstoppable!

522
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:21,699
Look at that jump shot!

523
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,900
It's all good! Roy, it's all good!

524
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:29,543
The crowd goes wild, Roy.

525
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:48,122
You spilled a lot of sweat on this floor,

526
00:37:48,198 --> 00:37:50,462
and it's gonna pay off.

527
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,367
Now, I know it seems
I've been hard on you for no reason.

528
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,499
But I've been tough
because I know how good you can be.

529
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:01,944
People outside this gym, they don't think
we got a chance this season,

530
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,846
playing with players
none of the big schools wanted.

531
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:08,579
But those people don't know you. I do.

532
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,679
You're talented. You're disciplined.

533
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,350
And you care about the guy
standing next to you.

534
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,155
That's how we're gonna win,
starting tomorrow night.

535
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,392
So let's go out there
and let's play Texas Western basketball.

536
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,728
Let's make that mean something.

537
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,963
On three.

538
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,444
One, two, three.

539
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,274
Miners!

540
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,041
All right, all right.

541
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:39,414
- Let's go, quick. Come on.
- Here we go.

542
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:43,444
- What are you still doing here, Shed?
- I'm... I'm ready to play.

543
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:47,652
Well, you had your chance to be a man.
Now, go on. Take your ticket and go home.

544
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:51,389
- Come on, man, let me play.
- I can't. You might get hurt.

545
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:54,227
Let me play!

546
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,998
Come on, come on, come on!
I don't care how tired you are.

547
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:03,600
That's the way to play.

548
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:09,471
Let me look at that. Come here
and let me look at that! Hold on.

549
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:11,574
- I'm all right.
- I know you're OK.

550
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:15,917
You're walking, but your nose ain't in
good shape. You're getting blood all over.

551
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:19,948
- I'm all right.
- Hold your head back. You're bleeding.

552
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:22,460
All right, let's play. Come on.

553
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,327
Quit hopping around like a jack rabbit.
I said rotate in.

554
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:35,936
You a catcher now?

555
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:43,648
- Ain't nothing gonna stop me from playing.
- He won't go to the doctor, Coach.

556
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:47,586
That's right. I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here to stay.

557
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:53,994
Just go get your nose taken care of.
We're gonna need ya this season, all right?

558
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:56,188
There you go, Nevil.

559
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:10,870
Hi again. Everybody. This is Judd Milton.
The voice of the Miners on KTSM 1380.

560
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:12,743
Welcome. It's our home opener.

561
00:40:12,814 --> 00:40:17,376
And we're hosting the Greyhounds
of Eastern New Mexico State College.

562
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:19,443
This is a night of questions.

563
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:24,424
Will Don Haskins, the little-known coach
of the Benjamin High School girls' team,

564
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:26,757
be able to lift the Miners
to respectability?

565
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:27,989
- Let me see.
- Let go!

566
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:29,827
- What?
- Don't touch it, man.

567
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:31,526
Hey, man. Where were you?

568
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:35,594
It was a late night,
if y'all know what I mean.

569
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:38,071
Are you ever gonna straighten up, man?

570
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:40,439
Somebody say something?

571
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,037
And now your Texas Western Miners!

572
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,855
At guard.
El Paso's own David Palacio!

573
00:40:55,925 --> 00:41:00,590
At forward, from Eagleville, Missouri,
Jerry Armstrong!

574
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:06,529
At guard. From Detroit. Michigan.
Bobby Joe Hill!

575
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:14,700
At forward. From Gary. Indiana.
Harry Flournoy!

576
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:23,881
And in center. From Houston. Texas.
David "Big Daddy D" Lattin!

577
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,618
Three of 'em, Wallace. They look like
the damn Tuskegee Institute out there.

578
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:33,630
Just when did we become
a colored school?

579
00:41:33,698 --> 00:41:35,962
... your 1965 Texas Western Miners!

580
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:41,665
The Miners win the tip-off
to start the season.

581
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:44,674
- Go, Hill. Set it up. Take your time.
- Set it up!

582
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:51,338
Hey, protect the ball.

583
00:41:52,016 --> 00:41:54,075
Not a good start for the Miners.

584
00:41:54,152 --> 00:41:57,747
Hey, Hill, you notice your man
just scored on you?

585
00:41:57,822 --> 00:41:59,586
Mitch, over here, over here!

586
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:02,855
- Hill spins to the basket. Puts it up for two!
- Stop showboating!

587
00:42:02,928 --> 00:42:06,762
Fundamental basketball, Hill.
Watch your base.

588
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:09,665
You didn't have a base -
that's how he went around you.

589
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:15,196
Coach Haskins trying to mold these guys
into team players... Cager for two.

590
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:17,936
Cager, just lay the ball off the board.

591
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:24,471
Get your hand in his face, son!
You gotta challenge that shot.

592
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,018
Right here, over here. Shoot it.

593
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,681
Where's the D? There ain't no D.

594
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:33,121
Hill wheelin' and dealin'.
The ball's loose!

595
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:35,991
- That's why I don't want you showboating.
- Let's go!

596
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:38,997
Hey, Armstrong. Hey, Flournoy.
Are you kiddin' me?

597
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:42,296
Lattin, you're ankle-deep in the floor, son.

598
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:44,837
Drive that ball! There it is!

599
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,069
Hey, I saw it, son.

600
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:52,373
And the Miners lead by four.

601
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:54,704
They need one stop now.

602
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,648
Good defense, Armstrong!
Good defense!

603
00:42:57,717 --> 00:43:02,052
So the Don Haskins era begins
in victory. A four-point win

604
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:05,183
over a less-than-impressive squad
from Eastern New Mexico.

605
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:06,988
But the real story tonight -

606
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:11,020
Coach Haskins putting three Negro
players into the starting lineup -

607
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:15,398
a move that's sure to stir things up
both on and off the court this season.

608
00:43:39,528 --> 00:43:43,259
- You've got all the moves, don't you?
- Oh, yeah.

609
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:45,562
Tried it on a hundred girls?

610
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:46,931
Ah...

611
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,470
Maybe 50 or 60.

612
00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:57,535
I'm tired of moving around.
I just wanna stay in one place for a while.

613
00:43:57,613 --> 00:44:02,574
Put down some roots for once.
You got what it takes, Bobby Joe?

614
00:44:24,774 --> 00:44:28,005
- Hey, Coach, I can't go no more!
- I think you can go some more.

615
00:44:28,077 --> 00:44:31,775
You got energy for all kind of nonsense
instead of putting it in your team!

616
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:34,977
Instead of demonstrating some respect
and being a leader!

617
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:37,043
I ain't got no team!

618
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:40,420
We ain't going nowhere! You telling us
all the time how bad we are!

619
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:44,587
We know we ain't gonna win!
What do I got to respect?

620
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,436
My old man drove a truck
for the better half of his life.

621
00:44:56,507 --> 00:45:00,841
Now, there ain't nothing wrong with that...
other than the fact he hated it.

622
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:03,506
That's the only way he knew
how to put food on the table

623
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:07,915
and give his kids a chance
to do something they loved.

624
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:11,683
I love this game. I love this game.

625
00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:14,852
I never was the greatest player.

626
00:45:14,926 --> 00:45:19,329
But I busted my butt,
and I outworked better players.

627
00:45:19,397 --> 00:45:23,891
I ain't the smartest coach, but I bust
my butt and I outwork smarter coaches.

628
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:29,929
And when I see the talent you got
and I see you wasting it, ticks me off.

629
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:35,311
Now, if you couldn't get in the gym,
if you didn't have the opportunity,

630
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:37,645
there'd be nothing for us to talk about,

631
00:45:37,717 --> 00:45:41,813
but, son, I've been there.
Times are different. You're in the gym.

632
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:46,324
And if you're in the gym, you step out on
that floor, you better respect my father, me,

633
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:50,795
and you better respect yourself
and play some basketball.

634
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:55,992
Midway through the first half.
Iowa playing well.

635
00:45:56,068 --> 00:46:01,370
Of course. That's to be expected. They're
undefeated. Number four in the country.

636
00:46:03,877 --> 00:46:08,337
Iowa. Always a contender in the Big Ten.
And there's a bucket for the Hawkeyes.

637
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:12,613
Coach Haskins is not happy.
It's an eight-point game right now.

638
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,218
Hey! Tighten up out there!

639
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,388
Stay on him! Stay on him!

640
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,020
Shed, box out! Shed!

641
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:29,528
- Count the bucket.
- Shed, would you box out?

642
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,431
That's it! We got 'em now.

643
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:37,604
Texas Western struggling to score
against this tough Hawkeyes' defense.

644
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:40,010
And there's a great block
just before the half.

645
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:45,879
I've seen a lot of rough halves in
basketball. But the Miners are struggling.

646
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:49,821
They'll go to the locker room
down by 16 points.

647
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:54,320
Say it, Hill.
Come on, Hill, say it.

648
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:59,094
We can't play like this!
They're better than us at your game.

649
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:01,635
You need to let us loose!

650
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:04,467
Just stick to the plan, Bobby Joe.

651
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,703
You want fundamental basketball, right?

652
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,844
Iowa is just flat outplaying Texas
Western. It's been a difficult game so far.

653
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,682
Ain't our night, Coach.

654
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:21,552
Hey, Hill. Time-out.
Time, time, time!

655
00:47:21,623 --> 00:47:23,523
Time-out, white.

656
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:27,492
Coach...

657
00:47:29,331 --> 00:47:32,129
if you let us play our game.

658
00:47:37,574 --> 00:47:41,874
All right, Hill, you play your game.
And you play my game.

659
00:47:43,746 --> 00:47:46,476
- You ready to play?
- Yeah, let's do it.

660
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:58,450
And the Miners have a couple of baskets
back to back.

661
00:47:58,528 --> 00:48:00,519
Still. Though. A huge deficit.

662
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:09,133
Orsten Artis with a steal. Bounce pass to
Bobby Joe Hill. He drives it in for two!

663
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:13,575
Well. The Miners have really turned it up
a notch defensively.

664
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,745
Now it looks like Iowa is the team
that's struggling.

665
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:23,184
This full-court pressure by the Miners
has the Hawkeyes rattled.

666
00:48:23,254 --> 00:48:25,518
Go to the basket! Go!

667
00:48:43,308 --> 00:48:47,404
The comeback is on. 59-48.
Iowa still with the lead.

668
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:49,447
Come on, son.

669
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:50,708
Bring us home.

670
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:59,086
Defense! Defense!

671
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:11,592
There it is.

672
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:16,997
Yeah!

673
00:49:17,076 --> 00:49:23,072
Down 16 at the half. Texas Western
has clawed their way back into this game!

674
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:30,747
Miners trail by one with 15 seconds left
in the game. They have a shot to win this.

675
00:49:30,823 --> 00:49:33,519
Hill! Hill! Nine, nine!

676
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:35,492
Spread their D! Their D!

677
00:49:36,496 --> 00:49:39,158
Hill goes down the middle.
Looks right. Nothing there.

678
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:41,325
Looks left.
He's gonna try it himself!

679
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:44,495
He is swarmed by Hawkeyes.
Splits the defense. Puts it up!

680
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:47,131
And it's good! Miners win!

681
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:51,143
Miners win! I'm seeing it with
my own eyes and I still don't believe it!

682
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:54,647
The Miners take down
perennial powerhouse Iowa.

683
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:58,913
Number four in the nation and the first
top-ranked team we have faced all year!

684
00:49:58,986 --> 00:50:01,318
These Miners are for real!

685
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:07,293
You were playing tonight,
not acting like a chump.

686
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:09,922
I'm never a chump.
I was always a player.

687
00:50:09,998 --> 00:50:11,966
My man.

688
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:14,524
Douse the fire and call in the dogs!

689
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:18,436
Whoever heard of Texas Western?
Well, the Hawkeyes have.

690
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:39,186
- Y'all going to church?
- Shh!

691
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,525
Shut up.

692
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:49,166
Why we got these honkies with us?

693
00:50:49,238 --> 00:50:51,900
Yeah, what are you honkies doing here?

694
00:50:51,974 --> 00:50:54,238
Hey, man.
We got more in the car behind us too.

695
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:56,641
- What are you doin' up front?
- Calm down.

696
00:50:56,712 --> 00:50:57,872
Hey! Don't...

697
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:10,419
Big Daddy's home, baby.

698
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,154
Hi.

699
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:40,079
Baudoin! Man, you something else!

700
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:44,821
I didn't think a white boy would eat chitlins!
Pig intestines.

701
00:51:51,402 --> 00:51:55,168
- What's your friend's name?
- Uh...

702
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:57,935
- That's Big Daddy.
- Hm.

703
00:52:00,177 --> 00:52:01,610
I'm-I'm Little Daddy.

704
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:18,628
So I was wondering... Do you guys wanna
be called colored or black?

705
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:23,330
- Do we look like a load of laundry to you?
- Jerry, look.

706
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:26,097
Jerry, we black. OK?

707
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:28,901
- Black?
- Yes. We black.

708
00:52:28,974 --> 00:52:34,537
- I thought you were called the other one.
- No, man. Black is bad, man. Bad.

709
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:36,308
That's what I mean, black is bad.

710
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:38,246
- Can I preach to him?
- Preach on.

711
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:42,515
- No, Mayberry Jerry. "Bad" means good.
- OK, now.

712
00:52:42,588 --> 00:52:46,524
- No, no, no. "Bad" means bad. I know that.
- No, no. Listen.

713
00:52:46,592 --> 00:52:50,551
With Ellie Mae, Uncle Jed and Granny
out on the farm, "bad" might be bad.

714
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:54,293
- Well...
- But with us, "bad" is good. You dig?

715
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:56,631
- Say it, rev.
- Come on.

716
00:52:56,702 --> 00:53:00,832
- OK, "bad" is good.
- Talk to me, baby! You're with me now.

717
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:02,534
OK.

718
00:53:02,608 --> 00:53:05,805
- So then what does "good" mean?

719
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:42,749
People put me down
'cause that's the side of town I was born in

720
00:53:42,817 --> 00:53:45,445
- Is that Billy Joe Royal?
- Yeah.

721
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,012
His white ass wouldn't know the poor side
of town if I dropped him off in it.

722
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,216
Ah!

723
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:53,055
- What you got?
- Wait, wait. Check this out.

724
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:54,185
Y'all know this song?

725
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:58,930
Aw, man! Turn that down!

726
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,467
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

727
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:05,134
Now we're gettin' our groove on, baby.

728
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:07,032
Hey, hey.

729
00:54:07,108 --> 00:54:09,235
You cats need to get with this.

730
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:20,851
- New Orleans!
- New Orleans!

731
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:26,390
Whoo!

732
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,511
For 12 years,
I've been a good friend to this school.

733
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:54,489
I support basketball, football,
put up the money for the stadium.

734
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:58,152
Always had Texas Western in my heart.

735
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,696
We could never have done any of it
without you.

736
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:05,098
But I got a little problem with Haskins
and all the colored boys he's playing.

737
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,262
Now, he doesn't need 'em to win, does he?

738
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,533
Well, we're undefeated.

739
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,736
Whoo, man.

740
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,146
- It's blazin' out there.
- I'm starving.

741
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:29,553
Hey, man. I gotta hit the john.
Order me some huevos rancheros.

742
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:33,290
Man, will you save that for El Paso?
I'm ordering us some pancakes.

743
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:36,094
Whatever you get, get me something
with salsa on it, OK?

744
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,000
- I already know what I'm gonna order.
- Hey, y'all, pass the menus.

745
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:45,332
Hey. Great game last night.
Never seen anybody play like that.

746
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:47,305
Oh, good morning.

747
00:55:47,379 --> 00:55:51,008
I need eggs. I need some sausage.
Sausage.

748
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,380
Unh!

749
00:55:53,352 --> 00:55:56,446
- It must be a New York thing.
- That's cool.

750
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,045
Unh!

751
00:55:58,123 --> 00:55:59,954
Are you guys ordering pancakes?

752
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:02,960
Don't get your black stink on me, boy.

753
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:12,061
- Hold on!
- Give it a good scrub, huh?

754
00:56:12,137 --> 00:56:15,471
Have a merry Christmas, though.
And have a good day. All right?

755
00:56:22,648 --> 00:56:26,277
Hey, man, you see them eggs up there?
Man, them a little plastic.

756
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:29,651
- I don't know, man.
- Man, you can't see it.

757
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:41,132
Shed!

758
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,364
Shed, what happened?
Something's wrong.

759
00:56:44,438 --> 00:56:47,566
What happened, son?
Shed, what happened?

760
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,243
- Help me out here.
- What's going on? You all right?

761
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:53,779
- Help him.
- Who did this?

762
00:57:05,192 --> 00:57:07,126
Anybody see 'em?

763
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:11,494
Son, get on this bus. Let's go.
Look at me. Look at me. Get on the bus.

764
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:13,598
- Baudoin.
- Who did this?

765
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:17,001
- We ain't going nowhere!
- Get on the bus! Everyone get on there!

766
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:19,471
- That everyone?
- Move.

767
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:26,943
- I could kill a honky tonight.
- Ain't nobody killing nobody.

768
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:28,710
I'm gonna start carrying a knife.

769
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:31,149
You show a blade,
they gonna pull a shotgun.

770
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:33,585
What are we supposed to do?
Just take it?

771
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:37,182
Look, we can't all live the Dr. King rule.
What you want us to do?

772
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:41,024
- Get slapped, turn the other cheek?
- Hell, no. I'm saying we think.

773
00:57:41,095 --> 00:57:44,259
When we go to the South,
we gotta go in twos.

774
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:50,238
We're always on the lookout for each other.
Don't turn your back on them crackers.

775
00:57:51,907 --> 00:57:56,310
Shed, you ain't gotta be embarrassed.
Could have happened to any one of us.

776
00:57:56,378 --> 00:58:01,315
I tell you right now, they won't catch us
alone no more. I promise you that.

777
00:58:01,383 --> 00:58:04,614
They come after one of us,
they gonna have to fight all of us.

778
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:21,128
Mary?

779
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:26,198
You're really late, Don.
Don't come home late without calling.

780
00:58:26,276 --> 00:58:28,870
You know, things happen to people...

781
00:58:28,945 --> 00:58:32,176
- Lemme get your plate and I'll heat it up.
- Honey, what is it?

782
00:58:32,249 --> 00:58:36,208
- Lemme get it. It'll only take a minute.
- Mary, just talk to me. What is it?

783
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:38,777
Hey, what is this?

784
00:58:38,855 --> 00:58:41,050
Honey, what is this?

785
00:58:52,169 --> 00:58:55,297
- This the first?
- No, I...

786
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:57,967
I throw them away
as soon as I get them.

787
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:02,502
- Why didn't you say something to me?
- I don't know. I just...

788
00:59:06,017 --> 00:59:12,081
My family's most important. How can I
protect you if I don't know what's going on?

789
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:14,514
Don.

790
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:18,723
Basketball's been our whole life.
But it's just a game.

791
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:23,092
I don't know if it's worth this.

792
00:59:28,707 --> 00:59:31,005
No, neither do I.

793
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:38,576
This is more than just a game now.
And I sure as hell can't quit on it.

794
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:14,011
Nothing ever
bothered me before.

795
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:17,819
It's like things,
they rolled right off my back.

796
01:00:17,891 --> 01:00:20,257
I just didn't care.

797
01:00:22,396 --> 01:00:25,832
Now I care.
That scares the heck outta me.

798
01:00:25,899 --> 01:00:29,027
I don't wanna want something
I can lose.

799
01:00:30,371 --> 01:00:32,805
Baby.

800
01:00:32,873 --> 01:00:35,899
There's nothing you can't lose.

801
01:00:35,976 --> 01:00:41,437
But no one can ever take your desire
away from you. No one.

802
01:00:41,515 --> 01:00:43,107
Ever.

803
01:00:44,985 --> 01:00:49,719
You know, Scoops, man, sometimes I don't
even feel like going back out there again.

804
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,591
Look. You can't let them take basketball
away from you, man.

805
01:00:53,662 --> 01:00:55,789
You can't let them win.

806
01:00:55,864 --> 01:01:00,597
I just don't know how much more of this
I can handle, man. I ain't like you, all brave.

807
01:01:00,626 --> 01:01:04,960
Sweet Pea, as long as I known you,
you been stronger than you think.

808
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,833
Hey, you OK, Scoops?

809
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:14,701
Yeah, I'm fine, man.

810
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:20,177
Hey, man. Hey, tell me
what's goin' on, man. You OK?

811
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:23,443
- Be ready, please. Thank you.

812
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:37,786
Scoops, you got a minute?

813
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:42,767
Says you got something called
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

814
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:45,235
My heart's too big.

815
01:01:45,304 --> 01:01:47,431
Ain't that something?

816
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:51,643
How long you known, Scoops?

817
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:54,579
Well, I...

818
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:58,641
I started fainting
when I was in high school, Coach.

819
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:01,210
So my mom being who she is,
she took me to the doctor.

820
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:04,223
They ran a few tests. That's how
I found out. But it doesn't matter.

821
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:07,658
You're a fool. You're a dang fool.
You could have died out there.

822
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:10,128
Coach, I'll die if I don't play.

823
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:15,700
Look, Coach. My whole life
I only loved playing basketball.

824
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:19,103
That's it. But you see,
I could never play in high school,

825
01:02:19,174 --> 01:02:23,201
because I had to work
to support my mom and my sisters.

826
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:31,182
But I never stopped playing in the street.
Never. 'Cause to not play, Coach, man...

827
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:35,746
Man. That was like letting something
just crawl up and die in me.

828
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:38,384
Far as this heart thing goes,
I can still play.

829
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,692
My heart's good. This heart thing
ain't nothing. I lived with it this long.

830
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:45,096
- That's why you gotta play me.
- I can't do it.

831
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,895
- The doctor said I could.
- I can't.

832
01:02:46,968 --> 01:02:50,370
He said I could play a few minutes here
and there. Why you won't let me?

833
01:02:50,439 --> 01:02:53,033
I know what the doctor said, Willie.

834
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:57,910
But I can't take a chance with your life.
I can't do that.

835
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,540
Now, you're still on the team.

836
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,345
We're gonna need you, Cager.

837
01:03:03,419 --> 01:03:05,853
We're gonna need your courage.

838
01:03:09,492 --> 01:03:12,620
We're gonna need that big heart of yours,
all right?

839
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:05,478
- You got basketball on your mind, Hill?
- Yeah, Coach. Nothing but.

840
01:04:08,352 --> 01:04:11,913
Coach Haskins. Matt Pavelar,
Dallas Morning News.

841
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:13,684
You're playing a lot of coloreds.

842
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:17,819
Are you concerned as to whether
the Negro player can handle the pressure

843
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,797
at the national level?

844
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:23,300
My team plays defense, rebounds.

845
01:04:23,368 --> 01:04:27,600
- What statement are you making?
- I'm a coach. I don't make statements.

846
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:31,109
- Kentucky's here.
- Thank you, Coach.

847
01:04:31,877 --> 01:04:33,538
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp.

848
01:04:33,612 --> 01:04:35,603
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp!

849
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:41,879
Coach Rupp, great game. Take us to the
last 20 seconds. What'd you tell the boys?

850
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:44,445
I knew it was 20 seconds.
I gave them a good play.

851
01:04:44,523 --> 01:04:49,722
Something in our playbook we used for
years. The boys performed it to perfection.

852
01:04:49,795 --> 01:04:51,559
I'm gonna introduce myself.

853
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:53,997
...and I know you're gonna let me go.

854
01:04:54,067 --> 01:04:55,830
- Figures.
- Thank you, Coach.

855
01:04:56,436 --> 01:04:58,734
- Coach.
- No more interviews. Thank you.

856
01:04:58,805 --> 01:05:02,468
Don Haskins.
I'm the coach over at Texas Western.

857
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,169
Just wanted to introduce myself.

858
01:05:06,246 --> 01:05:09,682
Congratulate you
on another great year and...

859
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:12,343
- These your boys?
- Yes, sir.

860
01:05:12,418 --> 01:05:14,716
Yes, sir, my players.

861
01:05:16,823 --> 01:05:20,725
Well, you had a fine season.
See you down the road.

862
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,566
- Losers!
- We don't want your kind!

863
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:36,804
Ignore all this trash!
Just get out on the court.

864
01:05:36,877 --> 01:05:38,902
Don't you come in here!

865
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:41,971
Look at all
these stupid kids!

866
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:46,208
Let go of me, boy!

867
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:49,222
Don't listen to 'em.
Come on, focus.

868
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:52,556
- That's easy for you say.
- Don't listen to 'em.

869
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:57,192
In spite of a hostile crowd.
The Miners have played well tonight

870
01:05:57,265 --> 01:05:59,130
as they look to close out East Texas.

871
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,534
And there's a block. And a fast break
opportunity for the Lions.

872
01:06:03,605 --> 01:06:06,039
And Jason Stevens puts it up for two.

873
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:10,510
Could have been in a Miners' uniform
if Coach had been able to recruit him.

874
01:06:10,578 --> 01:06:13,706
I see Coach must be clearing the bench,
huh?

875
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:19,479
And Stevens. With the hot hand here in the
second half. Being guarded by Baudoin.

876
01:06:24,293 --> 01:06:25,988
Coach sends his best.

877
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:31,432
This has been a hard-fought game
on both sides. Miners lead by five.

878
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,367
Takes it in to Big Daddy.
Who's pushed to the floor!

879
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:36,337
- Are you kiddin' me?
- It is getting rough.

880
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:40,171
Let's see who the foul's on.
They call it on Lattin! I can't believe this!

881
01:06:40,242 --> 01:06:42,369
Lattin's gotta watch his temper here.

882
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:45,812
He's already fouled
out of ten games this year.

883
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:48,213
Technical foul.

884
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:51,447
Just sit down. You never let your anger
get the better of you.

885
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,988
- He stuck his knee out!
- I know.

886
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:57,584
- Lattin's temper is gonna cost the Miners.
- You gotta hold yourself together.

887
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:00,892
- He's sticking his knee out!
- You hold yourself together.

888
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:05,458
Keep that anger inside you and I'll let you
know when you can let it go, understand?

889
01:07:07,237 --> 01:07:10,070
At the beginning of the season.
No one could have imagined

890
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,335
that we would wind up
where we are now:

891
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:14,707
Number four in the nation.

892
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:18,441
Close on the heels of powerhouses
like Kentucky and Kansas.

893
01:07:18,515 --> 01:07:21,882
Now. With two weeks to go
before the NCAA tournament starts.

894
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:24,046
We're not a secret anymore.

895
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,021
Been this cold before.

896
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,708
Man!

897
01:07:44,776 --> 01:07:46,903
Ross, Coach, hurry!

898
01:07:58,957 --> 01:08:02,552
- Oh, man.
- Moe, get us checked out.

899
01:08:04,296 --> 01:08:08,198
Listen, we're gonna get on the bus
and go to Seattle tonight, all right?

900
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:11,361
Get your stuff, pack up
and let's get on the bus.

901
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:18,442
Hey, man.

902
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:20,808
You ever get scared?

903
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:28,052
When I was a kid in Houston...

904
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:34,449
a white gang strung me on a fire escape
till I peed my pants.

905
01:08:36,429 --> 01:08:38,727
I came back down and...

906
01:08:40,266 --> 01:08:42,962
took nothing from nobody ever again.

907
01:08:44,137 --> 01:08:48,574
Took it to every honky on the block...

908
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:52,042
till they left Big Daddy D alone.

909
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:59,075
But this is different.

910
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:03,088
This is worse.

911
01:09:07,528 --> 01:09:09,962
This is the whole world.

912
01:09:10,865 --> 01:09:16,269
- Everything all right, Coach?
- Oh, what'd I get these guys into, Ross?

913
01:09:19,507 --> 01:09:22,408
You did the right thing.

914
01:09:22,476 --> 01:09:26,971
You think about what these boys had
to overcome just to get here.

915
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:33,385
You think about how they've been
degraded and humiliated,

916
01:09:33,455 --> 01:09:37,653
just 'cause they black,
by all these "civilized" folks.

917
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:42,488
- Shame on us.

918
01:09:43,565 --> 01:09:48,025
WTSM. 1380 broadcasting live
from Seattle. Washington.

919
01:09:48,103 --> 01:09:52,938
Hi, Miners fans. Thanks for joining us
at a packed house in the Pacific Northwest.

920
01:09:53,008 --> 01:09:57,571
The question: Will the Miners. In the last
regular season game here in Seattle.

921
01:09:57,647 --> 01:10:01,378
Take the number-one spot
in the NC 2A polls?

922
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:07,184
Adolph Rupp's fabled Wildcats dropped
a nail-biter to Tennessee last night.

923
01:10:07,256 --> 01:10:10,692
And that will allow the Miners.
If they win here tonight.

924
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,593
To take the number-one spot
in the nation.

925
01:10:14,997 --> 01:10:19,661
Hey, Lattin, you didn't jump high enough
to get toilet paper under your shoe.

926
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:23,300
The Chieftains go down
for an easy lay-up.

927
01:10:23,372 --> 01:10:27,309
Miners making it a little too easy
for the Chieftains at this point.

928
01:10:27,377 --> 01:10:29,277
Armstrong down low.

929
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:34,909
Armstrong's wide open. Flournoy looks
down there. Will not pass the ball.

930
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:37,920
He wants to go it alone.
Launches a 20-footer. It's off the mark.

931
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:40,081
Come on, man, I was wide open.

932
01:10:47,231 --> 01:10:48,721
Hill, we're in orange tonight.

933
01:10:48,799 --> 01:10:52,200
- Come on, Shed, meet the pass.
- Don't worry about me.

934
01:10:58,943 --> 01:11:00,740
The Miners are just playing flat.

935
01:11:00,812 --> 01:11:02,939
Your guy just got by you, Hill.

936
01:11:03,014 --> 01:11:06,916
There's no chemistry. No energy.
It's every man for themselves out there.

937
01:11:06,985 --> 01:11:10,921
They're not playing like a team.
That jump was no good.

938
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:19,957
- Coach, you're in my chair.
- I like the view better down here.

939
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:23,930
Eight minutes to play.
And I hate to say this.

940
01:11:24,002 --> 01:11:27,028
But it looks like
our Miners have given up.

941
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:41,442
They've got only themselves
to blame.

942
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,954
They didn't play together
or find the open man.

943
01:11:44,023 --> 01:11:48,153
And the Miners' perfect season
is slipping away.

944
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:10,279
Ohh!

945
01:12:22,662 --> 01:12:25,096
You stunk out there tonight!

946
01:12:25,165 --> 01:12:28,624
Squeaky could have played better D
than you did.

947
01:12:28,703 --> 01:12:31,467
And, Shed, are you kiddin' me?

948
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:35,635
That was the same ol' weak,
scared Shed out there.

949
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:40,875
Maybe you thought what used to be
an undefeated record meant something.

950
01:12:40,948 --> 01:12:43,576
That we could just waltz
our way in the tournament.

951
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:47,747
- Maybe these crackers is getting to us.
- Why you looking at me, Bobby Joe?

952
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:50,620
You a cracker, ain't you?

953
01:12:50,691 --> 01:12:53,990
Coach, the more we win,
the harder it is for us out there.

954
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:57,553
What do you suggest we do, Shed?
Lose?

955
01:12:57,631 --> 01:12:59,463
Give them what they want?

956
01:12:59,534 --> 01:13:03,527
You think basketball is everything, Coach.
And that's easy for you to say.

957
01:13:03,605 --> 01:13:06,403
But you don't have rednecks
in your face all the time.

958
01:13:06,475 --> 01:13:11,640
None of you white boys get it because you
don't have people breaking into your room

959
01:13:11,713 --> 01:13:13,340
or shoving your head in toilets.

960
01:13:13,415 --> 01:13:14,814
It's not us.

961
01:13:14,883 --> 01:13:17,784
White is white, Green Acres,
and that means you too.

962
01:13:17,853 --> 01:13:22,119
Yeah, I'm white. And you've never been
able to see past that! We're not like them!

963
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:25,182
Think we haven't had heat
come down on us?

964
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,991
You're the ones out there skating by,
while we're out there sweating blood.

965
01:13:29,064 --> 01:13:34,367
You think it's easy being on this team?
Taking a backseat to you every day?

966
01:13:34,437 --> 01:13:38,203
We came here to play basketball,
just like you guys!

967
01:13:38,274 --> 01:13:41,573
Now it's like we don't even count.
We're the minority!

968
01:13:41,644 --> 01:13:46,013
I don't wanna hear that from you. I have
been the minority every day of my life.

969
01:13:46,082 --> 01:13:51,452
And you're crying because you spent
the last few months in our shadows?

970
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:58,518
Welcome to the back of the bus,
white boy.

971
01:13:58,594 --> 01:14:03,259
I wish y'all would just sit back here
and listen to yourselves.

972
01:14:03,934 --> 01:14:10,806
It's worse than losing the game.
You've all forgotten what you're doing here.

973
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:17,246
What do you wanna do?
You wanna quit?

974
01:14:17,314 --> 01:14:22,115
- They're trying to take our dignity from us.
- Your dignity's inside you.

975
01:14:22,186 --> 01:14:26,122
Nobody can take something away from you
you don't give them.

976
01:14:27,257 --> 01:14:28,485
Hey.

977
01:14:30,562 --> 01:14:32,655
Hold your heads up.

978
01:14:34,232 --> 01:14:36,598
Hold your heads up.

979
01:14:37,202 --> 01:14:39,727
You wanna shake off that hate?

980
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:47,601
It's your choice, Harry Flournoy.
It's your choice, Jerry Armstrong.

981
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,374
Togo.

982
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:52,314
Cager, Hill, it's your choice.

983
01:14:52,383 --> 01:14:55,011
Shut them up.

984
01:14:55,086 --> 01:14:56,485
Win.

985
01:14:57,422 --> 01:15:00,016
The NCAA Tournament gets off
to a rip-roaring start

986
01:15:00,091 --> 01:15:04,358
as the powerhouse Kansas Jayhawks
take on the upstart Texas Western Miners.

987
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:07,456
Thank you
for keeping us together.

988
01:15:07,533 --> 01:15:11,970
Lord, we ask that you see us through,
no matter what the obstacles.

989
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:14,835
No matter how high the mountains.

990
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:18,675
- Amen.
- Amen.

991
01:15:18,744 --> 01:15:21,008
Let's go, guys.
Let's get this game.

992
01:15:21,012 --> 01:15:25,642
While the Texas Western club has turned
heads across the country with this roster,

993
01:15:25,717 --> 01:15:28,777
it's safe to say that Haskins' experiment
should end tonight.

994
01:15:38,864 --> 01:15:41,697
- Coach?
- You must be Mrs. Cager.

995
01:15:43,002 --> 01:15:47,962
- Thanks for seeing me before the game.
- I know you come a long way, so...

996
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,567
You have too.
You know, you're all he talks about.

997
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:57,740
"Coach said this" and "Coach said that."
So I said, "Let me meet this man."

998
01:15:57,817 --> 01:16:01,309
Well, Mrs. Cager, your son's
all a coach could ever ask for.

999
01:16:01,387 --> 01:16:04,755
He's hard working, he's unselfish.

1000
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:09,990
Tell you the truth, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Willie.

1001
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:14,191
Mr. Haskins, I came to ask you
to let him play.

1002
01:16:18,205 --> 01:16:21,834
Mrs. Cager, the thing is,
his condition is just...

1003
01:16:21,908 --> 01:16:25,173
I know about it better than anyone.

1004
01:16:26,513 --> 01:16:29,573
This is his time.

1005
01:16:29,649 --> 01:16:32,949
These are the last games
he'll ever play.

1006
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:37,990
I don't care if it's just five minutes
or five seconds.

1007
01:16:38,059 --> 01:16:41,961
Just... let him play.

1008
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:50,698
Led by all-American JoJo White.
The number-six Jayhawks are. With Duke.

1009
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:55,209
The favorites to challenge Rupp and
Kentucky for basketball's holy grail.

1010
01:16:55,276 --> 01:16:57,301
That's the all-American.

1011
01:16:57,378 --> 01:16:59,642
All press clippings.

1012
01:16:59,714 --> 01:17:02,809
- Think so?
- He's all talk too.

1013
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:22,593
Bobby Joe Hill will set up
the Texas Miner offense in the front court.

1014
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:25,103
Stolen! JoJo White.

1015
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:27,642
Tremendous
anticipation defensively by White.

1016
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,678
Easy pass and a dunk,
and a four-nothing Jayhawk lead.

1017
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,716
You gotta protect the ball, Hill!

1018
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,774
Ball in to Wesley.

1019
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:38,420
He just overpowers Lattin.

1020
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:41,787
Wesley trying to
intimidate Lattin early on in the game.

1021
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:44,053
Defense! Defense!

1022
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:49,027
White extends
the Jayhawk lead to five.

1023
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:52,796
But more importantly
now Kansas has all the momentum.

1024
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:56,032
It looks like Haskins
is going to go to his bench.

1025
01:17:56,106 --> 01:17:57,971
He's calling for Willie Cager.

1026
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:01,169
Cager missed
half the season with heart problems.

1027
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:04,646
But the Miners sure could use
a lift right now.

1028
01:18:07,451 --> 01:18:10,318
Now Cager
from the top of the key.

1029
01:18:10,387 --> 01:18:11,877
It's good!

1030
01:18:12,857 --> 01:18:17,487
Hey, welcome home, son! That's a good
play, Cager! Way to be out there!

1031
01:18:17,561 --> 01:18:19,552
- That's my son.
- Plays good.

1032
01:18:21,232 --> 01:18:24,668
JoJo White
into the front court. 22-footer.

1033
01:18:24,735 --> 01:18:26,225
It's good!

1034
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,931
Bobby Joe Hill looking to answer
for the Miners.

1035
01:18:29,006 --> 01:18:30,064
And he'll score!

1036
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:34,238
And these two point
guards are really putting on a show.

1037
01:18:34,312 --> 01:18:38,043
It's JoJo's turn.
From the wing. He looks unstoppable!

1038
01:18:38,116 --> 01:18:39,811
And Coach Haskins calls time.

1039
01:18:39,885 --> 01:18:43,844
Y'all are paying so much attention
to their jerseys that you're playing tight.

1040
01:18:43,922 --> 01:18:48,586
JoJo's having a big night, so I'm making a
change. Armstrong, you're in for Worsley.

1041
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:52,323
Now, if you can stop him, bottom line is
we're gonna win this game.

1042
01:18:52,397 --> 01:18:55,764
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- Let's go to work.

1043
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:57,825
On three.

1044
01:18:57,903 --> 01:18:59,632
- Let's go, team.
- One, two, three!

1045
01:18:59,704 --> 01:19:01,228
Miners!

1046
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,581
That's good D, son.

1047
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:18,180
Lattin. Back door to Shed.
And he'll lay it in for two.

1048
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:32,565
Here in the second half.
Armstrong has shut down JoJo White.

1049
01:19:32,638 --> 01:19:35,540
We need a stop!
We need a stop!

1050
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:41,279
Kansas scores.
And they lead by two!

1051
01:19:41,348 --> 01:19:43,646
- Seven seconds! Push the ball!
- Seven seconds!

1052
01:19:43,717 --> 01:19:46,208
No time-outs for the Miners!

1053
01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:53,686
Long inbound to Lattin.

1054
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,594
Back out to Hill. To the basket!

1055
01:19:57,664 --> 01:19:59,564
Cager! He got it!

1056
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:02,663
What a play!

1057
01:20:02,736 --> 01:20:07,106
He wasn't expected to play tonight.
But he saved the season for the Miners!

1058
01:20:07,175 --> 01:20:11,737
Overtime! Hey, you got an overtime!
Hey, get in here! We got an overtime!

1059
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:15,681
And we'll play overtime
to settle this one!

1060
01:20:20,688 --> 01:20:22,849
That's the way to go! That's it!

1061
01:20:26,127 --> 01:20:29,585
Just seconds remaining.

1062
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:31,655
Artis. Up to Lattin.

1063
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:35,635
It's good! And the Miners win!
The Miners win!

1064
01:20:35,703 --> 01:20:40,232
They're calling it
hanging on the rim! I can't believe it!

1065
01:20:40,309 --> 01:20:43,278
A foul called
against David Lattin.

1066
01:20:43,345 --> 01:20:46,576
The basket will count
and Kansas will shoot two free throws

1067
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:49,641
to try to send the game
to a second overtime.

1068
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:10,335
JoJo makes both.
And we're going to a second overtime.

1069
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:11,999
All right, bring it in!

1070
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,669
Oh. Is this a game for the record books!

1071
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,678
We got a great mismatch, a little low.

1072
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:20,341
So we're gonna swing in the ball
and let him take his man one on one.

1073
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,248
You got it? All right, let's do it.

1074
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:30,416
OK, here we go. The winner moves on
for the national championship.

1075
01:21:30,493 --> 01:21:33,087
Lattin. Cross-court pass to Artis.

1076
01:21:33,163 --> 01:21:35,723
He'll drive the baseline and score!

1077
01:21:35,799 --> 01:21:39,395
The Jayhawk defender really bit
on that fake. And the Miners lead by one.

1078
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:41,938
Kansas needs a basket to win.
Where they going?

1079
01:21:42,006 --> 01:21:44,873
Everyone knows
who will take this shot -

1080
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:47,604
it's their all-American JoJo White.

1081
01:21:50,748 --> 01:21:53,546
Ball goes in to JoJo!

1082
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,380
From the sideline!

1083
01:21:57,355 --> 01:22:01,121
It's good! Kansas wins! Kansas wins!

1084
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:08,990
Wait a minute. Ralph!
It looks like he stepped on the line.

1085
01:22:09,067 --> 01:22:11,865
I think the official's going
to wave the basket off.

1086
01:22:11,937 --> 01:22:17,102
It's no good! And Texas
Western's improbable story continues

1087
01:22:17,175 --> 01:22:21,635
with an 81-80 double overtime win
over the Kansas Jayhawks.

1088
01:22:29,121 --> 01:22:31,749
Have you seen this?
Have you read this already?

1089
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:33,017
I read it.

1090
01:22:33,091 --> 01:22:37,357
It says, "The selfless support of Texas
Western's booster Wade Richardsons,

1091
01:22:37,429 --> 01:22:41,958
which has made this breakout team's rise
a true phenomenon in the sports world."

1092
01:22:42,034 --> 01:22:45,435
Well, they got you down,
didn't they, sir?

1093
01:22:45,505 --> 01:22:47,905
Just forget all that stuff I said before.

1094
01:22:47,974 --> 01:22:52,570
I've been selling more dinettes than
I've sold in the last four years combined.

1095
01:22:55,615 --> 01:22:59,949
You're 24 hours from the biggest game
in college basketball. How do you feel?

1096
01:23:00,019 --> 01:23:01,782
You know, I've been here before.

1097
01:23:01,854 --> 01:23:04,652
It's been some time now,
but I've had some success here

1098
01:23:04,724 --> 01:23:07,818
and I feel like I'm coming home, really.

1099
01:23:07,894 --> 01:23:10,125
I'm just glad to be here.

1100
01:23:10,197 --> 01:23:13,189
I'd like to ask you
about your controversial win over Kansas.

1101
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:18,864
There's no controversy. JoJo White
stepped out of bounds. They lost, we won.

1102
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:31,881
Coach Haskins, how do you plan on
stopping Louie Dampier and Pat Riley?

1103
01:23:31,952 --> 01:23:35,911
Ask Coach Rupp how he plans on
stopping David Lattin and Bobby Joe Hill.

1104
01:23:35,989 --> 01:23:36,956
Who?

1105
01:23:38,692 --> 01:23:40,320
You have to admit. Coach Rupp.

1106
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:44,456
That the Negro player is changing
the game of basketball.

1107
01:23:44,532 --> 01:23:45,521
Oh?

1108
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:52,301
Well, as far as I know, basketball's about
taking the basketball, putting it in the hoop.

1109
01:23:52,874 --> 01:23:57,402
And you can quote me.
I don't think that's going to change.

1110
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:00,243
That horrible man,
playing those coloreds.

1111
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:02,875
And where are you from, sweetheart?

1112
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:07,615
El Paso, Texas. I'm married to that
horrible man you were just talking about.

1113
01:24:07,689 --> 01:24:11,990
Coach Rupp, what do you think of their
lightning-quick guard, Bobby Joe Hill?

1114
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:15,656
He's a good boy. But there's lots
of good boys out there this year.

1115
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:18,791
Well. This good little boy led us
to 23 and one.

1116
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:22,701
Well, I think you understood my point.

1117
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:28,175
My point is that we at Kentucky don't worry
about the boys in other uniforms.

1118
01:24:28,244 --> 01:24:29,734
We play our game.

1119
01:24:32,715 --> 01:24:38,210
Don't pay them any mind.
It's just how some people were raised.

1120
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:41,086
Well, they weren't raised right.

1121
01:24:41,157 --> 01:24:43,352
I guess not.

1122
01:24:44,961 --> 01:24:48,294
But not everybody thinks like that.

1123
01:24:49,633 --> 01:24:52,568
My name is Esther.

1124
01:24:52,636 --> 01:24:54,729
Esther Rupp.

1125
01:24:55,438 --> 01:25:00,068
Nice to meet you. Mary Haskins.

1126
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:04,009
Let's get this game over with
so we can get back to Memphis.

1127
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,779
Well, one thing's for sure -
can't no five niggers beat five white boys.

1128
01:25:09,753 --> 01:25:14,054
Yeah. Just black trash, that's all they are.
They think they belong here.

1129
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:15,558
Harris. That's enough.

1130
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:19,289
- Wait, I'm just getting started here. Hold it.

1131
01:25:19,797 --> 01:25:23,893
Maybe old Coach Rupp still
has a thing to learn about basketball.

1132
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:28,098
These boys are playing
for more than just the championship.

1133
01:25:30,641 --> 01:25:32,871
When I came here...

1134
01:25:35,646 --> 01:25:37,910
I didn't wanna come.

1135
01:25:39,951 --> 01:25:42,785
I didn't wanna be a part of this.

1136
01:25:44,289 --> 01:25:46,814
But I was wrong, Don.

1137
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:50,020
I was wrong.

1138
01:26:42,216 --> 01:26:44,946
You know, my dad called.

1139
01:26:45,019 --> 01:26:50,787
He said everybody in town's going to
Thelma's Steakhouse to watch the game.

1140
01:26:54,328 --> 01:26:56,819
He said he was proud of me.

1141
01:26:56,897 --> 01:27:02,335
It was always just a game to me. But now
it feels like a lot more than a game.

1142
01:27:02,403 --> 01:27:07,431
Yeah, I know what you mean, brother.
Feels like my whole life.

1143
01:27:07,508 --> 01:27:11,467
My folks are driving down
with Willie's parents.

1144
01:27:11,545 --> 01:27:14,879
My old man's coming too.

1145
01:27:14,949 --> 01:27:21,752
He was always a baseball fan.
But I think he's finally liking basketball.

1146
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:24,223
Bobby Joe. You hear me, man?

1147
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:29,221
This ain't gonna be nothing.
It's just a day at the playground.

1148
01:27:36,571 --> 01:27:37,697
Hello?

1149
01:27:45,548 --> 01:27:47,914
Take a look out there.

1150
01:27:48,918 --> 01:27:51,478
We can't win tomorrow night.

1151
01:27:53,589 --> 01:27:56,456
You're not a championship team.

1152
01:27:57,393 --> 01:28:02,126
You've been lucky so far,
but tomorrow your luck's gonna run out.

1153
01:28:05,067 --> 01:28:08,230
To win at this level, you gotta have a...

1154
01:28:10,773 --> 01:28:14,505
intelligence inside you out on that court.

1155
01:28:15,312 --> 01:28:17,712
You gotta be able to think.

1156
01:28:17,781 --> 01:28:21,182
We just got too much
of the wrong complexion.

1157
01:28:24,187 --> 01:28:27,122
You're athletes, sure.

1158
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:30,216
But so are monkeys.

1159
01:28:33,063 --> 01:28:34,121
Mm-hm.

1160
01:28:34,197 --> 01:28:37,030
You can run. You can jump.

1161
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,763
Maybe even hit the occasional outside shot
with the right training,

1162
01:28:40,837 --> 01:28:43,635
but to compete against a real team...

1163
01:28:47,245 --> 01:28:54,151
Well, should I go on, or you as sick
of this same old tired line of BS as I am?

1164
01:28:58,956 --> 01:29:04,952
I'm so sick of it, tonight I made a decision
that we're gonna put a stop to it forever.

1165
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:10,833
Lattin.

1166
01:29:10,902 --> 01:29:12,392
Flournoy.

1167
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:15,031
Artis, Cager, Worsley, Hill.

1168
01:29:16,575 --> 01:29:17,735
Shed.

1169
01:29:20,546 --> 01:29:23,071
Five starters, two subs.

1170
01:29:23,148 --> 01:29:25,207
40 minutes, seven players.

1171
01:29:25,284 --> 01:29:30,153
I'm only gonna play the black players
in the final game tomorrow.

1172
01:29:30,222 --> 01:29:32,452
Just you.

1173
01:29:32,524 --> 01:29:34,890
Togo, Armstrong, Palacio,

1174
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,428
Myers, Baudoin.

1175
01:29:38,463 --> 01:29:42,627
I know how hard every one of you worked
to get here. I don't wanna hurt any of you.

1176
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:46,001
Coach. I can't lie.

1177
01:29:46,072 --> 01:29:48,267
I wanna play.

1178
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:52,008
I do. We all wanna play.

1179
01:29:55,715 --> 01:29:59,674
But I just wanna say one thing.

1180
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:04,513
Tomorrow night,

1181
01:30:04,591 --> 01:30:11,394
y'all go out there and show 'em how bad
five brothers can be on the court.

1182
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:15,825
OK?

1183
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:23,374
Flournoy, if you don't get back and play
defense, I'll be all over your black butt.

1184
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:38,286
Good evening and welcome
to the Cole Field House for the finals

1185
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:40,884
of the NCAA Championship game

1186
01:30:40,961 --> 01:30:46,059
between the University of Kentucky
and Texas Western College.

1187
01:30:46,134 --> 01:30:48,625
And here come the Miners.

1188
01:30:58,847 --> 01:31:01,645
When this tournament began.
Virtually everybody

1189
01:31:01,716 --> 01:31:03,684
could have predicted one of our finalists.

1190
01:31:03,752 --> 01:31:06,550
But I don't think anyone
could have predicted the other.

1191
01:31:06,621 --> 01:31:10,182
It's Texas Western College
against the University of Kentucky

1192
01:31:10,258 --> 01:31:12,783
for the NCAA Championship.

1193
01:31:12,861 --> 01:31:15,489
A little mining college from
out in West Texas.

1194
01:31:15,563 --> 01:31:19,625
A scrappy bunch with an unusual lineup
going against basketball royalty.

1195
01:31:19,702 --> 01:31:24,139
The Baron of the Bluegrass
and his four NCAA men's championships.

1196
01:31:24,206 --> 01:31:27,004
If there was ever more of a mismatch,
I don't remember it.

1197
01:31:27,076 --> 01:31:30,409
Here's tonight's starting lineup
for the Kentucky Wildcats.

1198
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:33,642
At guard number 30, six-three,
Tommy Kron.

1199
01:31:33,716 --> 01:31:36,116
The Cats are led
by two great all-Americans.

1200
01:31:36,185 --> 01:31:41,179
First of all. Sharp-shooting Louie Dampier
and the high-scoring Pat Riley.

1201
01:31:41,257 --> 01:31:43,418
These guys play with speed.

1202
01:31:43,492 --> 01:31:47,395
They play with poise
and they play with intelligence.

1203
01:31:47,464 --> 01:31:51,195
And the coach of
the Kentucky Wildcats. Adolph Rupp.

1204
01:31:51,268 --> 01:31:55,671
Now here's the starting lineup
for the Texas Western Miners.

1205
01:31:55,739 --> 01:32:00,904
At guard. Out of Detroit. Michigan.
Number 14. five-ten. Bobby Joe Hill.

1206
01:32:00,978 --> 01:32:05,039
At the other guard, number 24,
five-six Willie Worsley.

1207
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:10,109
At center. From Houston. Texas.
Number 43. six-seven. David Lattin.

1208
01:32:10,187 --> 01:32:13,918
At forward. Number 44. six-five.
Harry Flournoy.

1209
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:17,119
At the other forward. Number 20.
Orsten Artis.

1210
01:32:17,194 --> 01:32:21,097
And the coach of the Texas Western
Miners. Don Haskins.

1211
01:32:21,165 --> 01:32:24,032
We have a
David-versus-Goliath match-up.

1212
01:32:24,102 --> 01:32:28,402
Texas Western against Kentucky
for the NCAA Championship.

1213
01:32:28,473 --> 01:32:31,772
You had a great season, Coach.
You must be thrilled to be here.

1214
01:32:34,212 --> 01:32:36,476
- One, two, three.
- Miners!

1215
01:32:37,382 --> 01:32:40,112
You three guards are in there
to stop their fast break.

1216
01:32:40,184 --> 01:32:42,277
Make them have to walk it down the court.

1217
01:32:42,353 --> 01:32:45,789
You saw who they put on the floor.
They're gonna try to run against us.

1218
01:32:45,857 --> 01:32:50,056
In an unprecedented move, Coach
Haskins is starting five Negro players.

1219
01:32:50,129 --> 01:32:53,758
- That's a spit in the face.
- A first in NCAA Championship history.

1220
01:32:53,832 --> 01:32:57,996
Now I want you to get angry. Go out there
first time you get the ball and dunk it.

1221
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:01,039
I don't care if you have
to run someone over to do it.

1222
01:33:01,106 --> 01:33:02,869
We're faster.
We can spit right back.

1223
01:33:02,941 --> 01:33:04,602
Send 'em a message. Get in there.

1224
01:33:04,676 --> 01:33:07,406
They're the one that got a chip
on their shoulder, not us.

1225
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:10,505
It ain't about nothing except basketball.
One, two, three!

1226
01:33:10,582 --> 01:33:12,072
Miners!

1227
01:33:12,151 --> 01:33:16,053
Dampier's a great ball handler. You try
to take it from him, he's gonna burn you.

1228
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:18,886
- Come on, Coach.
- Some say he's the best guard.

1229
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:21,859
If I had a choice between him and you,
I'd choose you.

1230
01:33:21,928 --> 01:33:24,920
That's good, 'cause you know
he wouldn't have chose me.

1231
01:33:31,104 --> 01:33:34,767
The opening tap.
Big David Lattin against Pat Riley.

1232
01:33:39,412 --> 01:33:42,210
And the tap is controlled
by Texas Western.

1233
01:33:42,282 --> 01:33:46,480
Worsley gives it to Bobby Joe Hill.
Now Hill rockets a pass into Lattin.

1234
01:33:46,553 --> 01:33:48,418
And he dunks it over Riley.

1235
01:33:48,488 --> 01:33:50,650
Aah!

1236
01:33:50,724 --> 01:33:51,782
Yeah!

1237
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:58,465
- He was making a statement with that.
- And Adolph Rupp looks disgusted.

1238
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:02,901
Now Kentucky on offense for the first time.
The ball in the hands of Louie Dampier.

1239
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,666
Texas Western in a man-to-man.
He gets it to Conley.

1240
01:34:05,739 --> 01:34:09,505
He's got a mismatch on Worsley. Backs
him down and scores. We're tied at two.

1241
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:13,445
Conley, that's gonna be there
all night long.

1242
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:18,008
The Miners work the ball into David Lattin.
He spins outta the double team. Scores.

1243
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:19,313
There it is. There it is.

1244
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:23,756
It's six-seven. 240
pounds of a powerhouse in the middle.

1245
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:26,623
Wildcats get the ball to the high post.
Thad Jaracz has it.

1246
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:29,459
- Slow it down. Set it up.
- Lattin, get physical.

1247
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:32,295
They cut off him.
He puts it on the floor. Goes to the hoop.

1248
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:34,995
And he is fouled
and fouled hard by David Lattin.

1249
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:38,335
That's a flagrant foul!
You gonna call that, ref?

1250
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:42,706
That's a flagrant foul! You want there to be
a melee? Someone's gonna get hurt here.

1251
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,335
I'll call the foul. Two shots.

1252
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,437
A pair of free throws ties the game
at 12.

1253
01:34:46,515 --> 01:34:49,245
But the Baron is not happy
on the Kentucky bench.

1254
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:52,549
Texas Western very disciplined
against this Kentucky zone.

1255
01:34:52,622 --> 01:34:55,716
They work the ball down low to Lattin.
He goes up for the shot.

1256
01:34:55,791 --> 01:35:00,251
No good. Offensive rebound.
Flournoy. And he is down and hurt.

1257
01:35:00,329 --> 01:35:02,024
Stay down.
Coach.

1258
01:35:02,098 --> 01:35:03,531
Ohh!

1259
01:35:06,802 --> 01:35:09,032
Where'd he hurt? Harry.

1260
01:35:09,105 --> 01:35:12,097
How'd you come down?
Did it go out or in? Hold still.

1261
01:35:12,175 --> 01:35:15,076
Well, that's one less thing
to worry about.

1262
01:35:18,181 --> 01:35:20,172
Cager, you're in.

1263
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,446
And it looks like Flournoy has
to come out of this game.

1264
01:35:26,523 --> 01:35:29,549
This will be a huge blow
to the Miners if he can't return.

1265
01:35:29,626 --> 01:35:31,093
He's through for the night.

1266
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:35,222
Oh. Boy. This will be tough because he's
a great rebounder for Texas Western.

1267
01:35:35,299 --> 01:35:40,896
At six-five. He is one of the best.
And it'll be a disaster if he can't continue.

1268
01:35:40,971 --> 01:35:43,303
Tough break, son.

1269
01:35:47,477 --> 01:35:50,310
Ten minutes gone
in this fast-paced first half.

1270
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:54,078
Kentucky with the ball and the lead.
Here's a backdoor cut by Riley.

1271
01:35:54,152 --> 01:35:56,143
He goes up and is slammed to the floor.

1272
01:35:56,221 --> 01:35:59,019
And that'll be number three
on Big David Lattin.

1273
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:03,424
That really hurts the Miners because this
big guy's been carrying Texas Western

1274
01:36:03,494 --> 01:36:05,291
with his strong inside play.

1275
01:36:05,363 --> 01:36:09,231
Now Don Haskins will have to take
the very physical Lattin out of the game.

1276
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,824
I can't let you foul out.

1277
01:36:10,902 --> 01:36:15,566
And it looks like Nevil Shed is replacing
him. But they're giving up something here.

1278
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:21,101
Riley's first free throw is good. And Coach
Haskins wants a word with Bobby Joe Hill.

1279
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:25,577
The Wildcats by four now with a chance
to stretch their lead.

1280
01:36:25,651 --> 01:36:28,643
Here's Tommy Kron
bringing the ball up for Kentucky.

1281
01:36:28,721 --> 01:36:31,383
Orsten Artis all over him.
And here comes Hill!

1282
01:36:31,457 --> 01:36:34,984
He strips it away
and he's going in for the lay-up!

1283
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,585
What a pair of hands.

1284
01:36:38,497 --> 01:36:40,488
What a steal by Hill.

1285
01:36:40,566 --> 01:36:42,158
That happens when you don't talk
to each other.

1286
01:36:42,234 --> 01:36:46,568
This time Louie Dampier with the
basketball. He's played by Bobby Joe Hill.

1287
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:49,130
He steps in and steals it again!
Holy mackerel!

1288
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:53,145
Bobby Joe Hill picked the lock
on the Fort Knox hands of Louie Dampier.

1289
01:36:53,213 --> 01:36:57,650
And he's got back-to-back steals and
lay-ups. And like that. We're tied again.

1290
01:36:57,717 --> 01:36:59,412
Time-out. Time-out!

1291
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:03,217
- Kentucky wants time.
- Time-out. White.

1292
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,222
Yes.

1293
01:37:08,128 --> 01:37:11,029
Hey, those are two big-time plays, Hill.

1294
01:37:11,097 --> 01:37:13,531
- Are you scared?
- No, sir!

1295
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,330
I know someone who's not scared.
Conley's not.

1296
01:37:16,403 --> 01:37:18,530
We don't teach scared
at the University of Kentucky.

1297
01:37:18,605 --> 01:37:21,972
I need you standing there waiting for 'em
when they come outta time-out,

1298
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:23,738
like a force, like a wall!

1299
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:27,372
Don't let that guy crowd you!
Get him out of there.

1300
01:37:27,448 --> 01:37:31,145
This the national championship.
Are you surprised? They come to play.

1301
01:37:31,218 --> 01:37:35,211
So we got to play back. We know how
to play this game better than anybody.

1302
01:37:35,289 --> 01:37:37,052
Play the game. Let's go.

1303
01:37:37,124 --> 01:37:38,921
Over here!

1304
01:37:41,929 --> 01:37:43,726
Yeah!

1305
01:37:45,733 --> 01:37:47,223
Set it up, set it up.

1306
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:50,828
Defense, defense!
Watch Hill. Inside!

1307
01:37:50,905 --> 01:37:52,270
Whoa! Whoa!

1308
01:37:56,144 --> 01:37:58,442
That's it. That's what I want.

1309
01:38:08,323 --> 01:38:09,312
Whoo!

1310
01:38:11,593 --> 01:38:13,959
Inside of ten seconds to go. First half.

1311
01:38:14,029 --> 01:38:18,125
Jaracz with the ball. High post.
Looking for Riley. Running off a screen.

1312
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,430
Here's a shot at the buzzer.

1313
01:38:20,502 --> 01:38:22,197
It's good!

1314
01:38:26,676 --> 01:38:29,440
We're all a little shocked.

1315
01:38:29,512 --> 01:38:32,310
Texas Western is leading Kentucky
at the half.

1316
01:38:32,382 --> 01:38:35,180
But the smart money
has to be on Kentucky

1317
01:38:35,251 --> 01:38:38,414
'cause they were firing on all cylinders
to end the half.

1318
01:38:38,488 --> 01:38:40,251
The Miners did have some big plays.

1319
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:43,315
But must be concerned with the three fouls
on David Lattin

1320
01:38:43,393 --> 01:38:45,520
as well as the injury to Harry Flournoy.

1321
01:38:45,595 --> 01:38:47,153
He will not return.

1322
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:56,136
- Yo, hurry up, you late.
- Close the door. Come on.

1323
01:38:56,206 --> 01:38:58,674
They're getting ready
to start the second half.

1324
01:38:58,742 --> 01:39:00,004
... crowning a champion.

1325
01:39:00,077 --> 01:39:03,069
Don't let that cocky kid set a tent up
under the basket.

1326
01:39:03,147 --> 01:39:07,174
If he gets position on you, it'll throw down
every time. Get him out of there!

1327
01:39:07,251 --> 01:39:12,279
I'm putting you in with three fouls, Lattin.
You gotta play smart and protect the paint.

1328
01:39:12,356 --> 01:39:16,190
He's trying to figure out how to get you
to foul out, so keep your feet on the ground.

1329
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:19,354
- Get a body on him. I want him outta there.
- OK? You ready?

1330
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:21,796
- Are you the University of Kentucky?
- Yes, sir.

1331
01:39:21,865 --> 01:39:23,924
What has the Baron designed
for his Wildcats?

1332
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:27,597
- Come on, number ten.
- Wildcats give the ball to Louie Dampier.

1333
01:39:27,672 --> 01:39:28,696
Get your hand up!

1334
01:39:28,773 --> 01:39:31,264
- Here's his long jump shot.
- There it is.

1335
01:39:31,342 --> 01:39:33,537
And the Kentucky fans are on their feet.

1336
01:39:33,611 --> 01:39:35,044
Come on, get back!

1337
01:39:35,113 --> 01:39:38,605
The Miners feed it inside to Lattin.
And Riley steals it away.

1338
01:39:38,683 --> 01:39:41,550
Now Kentucky looks to break.
Tommy Kron on the point.

1339
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:44,850
Feeds it to Riley. Who beats Lattin
to the basket and lays it in for two!

1340
01:39:44,923 --> 01:39:47,016
Now. That is Kentucky basketball.

1341
01:39:47,091 --> 01:39:48,581
That's it, that's it.

1342
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:52,721
Kentucky trapping outta their zone.
And Kron takes it away from Worsley.

1343
01:39:52,797 --> 01:39:56,461
The Wildcats look to run again.
Fast break ahead to Riley.

1344
01:39:56,535 --> 01:39:59,333
And that is back-to-back hoops
for the all-American.

1345
01:39:59,405 --> 01:40:03,466
I don't know what Coach Rupp told his
team at halftime. But they are on fire.

1346
01:40:03,542 --> 01:40:06,136
This is how the number-one team
in the nation plays.

1347
01:40:06,212 --> 01:40:09,648
Here's Riley on the move to the basket.
And Lattin fouls him again.

1348
01:40:09,715 --> 01:40:12,309
Foul. Miners, number 43!

1349
01:40:12,384 --> 01:40:16,081
And that will send the big center
to the bench with his fourth foul.

1350
01:40:16,155 --> 01:40:17,554
That's aggressive play.

1351
01:40:17,623 --> 01:40:21,252
The Miners are hanging in.
But that's gotta hurt on both ends.

1352
01:40:21,327 --> 01:40:24,091
Hey, there's a lot of ball on that, ref.

1353
01:40:28,502 --> 01:40:32,461
I know Lattin's out. But you can't do this
all by yourself. Just slow it down.

1354
01:40:32,539 --> 01:40:34,097
OK? Get everybody involved.

1355
01:40:36,409 --> 01:40:39,742
And Kentucky leads by eight
with ten minutes to play.

1356
01:40:39,813 --> 01:40:41,804
Ball! Ball, ball!

1357
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:46,280
Bobby Joe Hill will fire one up
from 25 feet.

1358
01:40:46,353 --> 01:40:47,377
And he got it!

1359
01:40:47,454 --> 01:40:48,614
Check him! Check him!

1360
01:40:48,688 --> 01:40:49,848
Whoo!

1361
01:40:49,923 --> 01:40:52,255
Defense, now, defense!

1362
01:40:58,099 --> 01:41:00,567
Way to penetrate. That's what I want.

1363
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,594
Ah, ha-ha!

1364
01:41:10,011 --> 01:41:11,103
Yes!

1365
01:41:23,858 --> 01:41:26,953
Cager's spun it off the glass.
And the Miners lead by three!

1366
01:41:27,029 --> 01:41:30,795
Time. Time! Time-out, Wildcats!

1367
01:41:31,667 --> 01:41:33,225
Coach Rupp calls time.
He's seen enough.

1368
01:41:34,403 --> 01:41:38,499
Miners lead at 64-61.
Just two minutes left.

1369
01:41:45,781 --> 01:41:50,445
All season, when you had nothing left,
you come up with it. And you had success.

1370
01:41:50,519 --> 01:41:52,384
You did it, you did it.

1371
01:41:52,454 --> 01:41:55,912
And that's how we got here, from your
efforts. From your efforts, we're here.

1372
01:41:55,991 --> 01:42:00,258
We are two minutes from a championship.
Lattin, I'm putting you back in.

1373
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:03,163
Right now it's not about talent -
it's about heart.

1374
01:42:03,232 --> 01:42:06,633
It's about who can go out there
and play the hardest and the smartest.

1375
01:42:06,703 --> 01:42:08,762
This team's a special team.

1376
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:12,269
Special team.

1377
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:15,373
You're gonna win this game.

1378
01:42:15,445 --> 01:42:17,003
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir.

1379
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,483
You're gonna win this game.
So go out there and make me a prophet.

1380
01:42:21,551 --> 01:42:24,042
They've been here before -
they won't give it to us.

1381
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:28,148
We gotta go out there and we gotta take it!
Right? Take it! Take it!

1382
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:31,126
I want you to go out there and take it!
One, two, three!

1383
01:42:31,195 --> 01:42:32,628
Take it!

1384
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:43,139
Two minutes to go. And the Miners lead
Adolph Rupp and Kentucky by three.

1385
01:42:43,207 --> 01:42:45,141
Defense! Defense!

1386
01:42:45,209 --> 01:42:46,198
Four-two.

1387
01:42:46,276 --> 01:42:49,404
Louie Dampier guarded tightly
by Bobby Joe Hill.

1388
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,074
He reverses his dribble and fires.
It's good!

1389
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:53,138
There it is.

1390
01:42:53,217 --> 01:42:55,685
That was a big shot.

1391
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:57,745
Miners look to answer.

1392
01:43:00,492 --> 01:43:02,050
Yes!

1393
01:43:02,127 --> 01:43:04,687
Wildcats into the front court.
Needing a score.

1394
01:43:04,763 --> 01:43:06,958
Riley breaks free.

1395
01:43:12,804 --> 01:43:14,704
Set it up! Set it up!

1396
01:43:14,773 --> 01:43:17,105
Now who will answer the bell
for the Miners?

1397
01:43:17,175 --> 01:43:19,336
Artis passes it to Cager
at the foul line.

1398
01:43:19,411 --> 01:43:23,575
He slashes around Jaracz.
Takes it right down Main Street.

1399
01:43:27,519 --> 01:43:31,149
So it comes down to this.
18 seconds remain.

1400
01:43:31,223 --> 01:43:33,521
Wildcats with the ball.
In need of a score

1401
01:43:33,592 --> 01:43:37,028
to keep their hopes
of a fifth national championship alive.

1402
01:43:37,096 --> 01:43:41,533
Kentucky looking inside for a mismatch
against the shorter Worsley.

1403
01:43:43,069 --> 01:43:45,094
Stolen away by Bobby Joe.

1404
01:44:06,059 --> 01:44:09,290
Desperation time now for Kentucky
in the final seconds.

1405
01:44:09,362 --> 01:44:12,957
Here's a miss by Kron.
Lattin has the rebound for Texas Western.

1406
01:44:13,033 --> 01:44:17,265
He gives it to Bobby Joe. Looking
at the clock. Watching it count down.

1407
01:44:17,337 --> 01:44:20,135
Ten. Nine. Eight...

1408
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:23,643
The Miners are on their way to victory.

1409
01:44:30,952 --> 01:44:33,477
Whoo! Whoo!

1410
01:44:42,263 --> 01:44:46,199
This is the greatest upset
in NCAA history!

1411
01:44:46,267 --> 01:44:50,601
Texas Western is
the new national champion!

1412
01:45:07,289 --> 01:45:08,313
Whoo!

1413
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:11,188
National champion!

1414
01:45:22,471 --> 01:45:25,531
Mama, I'm a national champion.

1415
01:45:26,341 --> 01:45:29,139
I'm a national champion.

1416
01:45:29,211 --> 01:45:30,804
Whoo!

1417
01:45:38,254 --> 01:45:40,916
Where is he?
I can't see! Where is he?

1418
01:45:45,428 --> 01:45:47,692
I love you, Mama. Thank you.

1419
01:50:39,999 --> 01:50:45,801
You know, Kentucky's so big,
and Adolph Rupp's name was so big,

1420
01:50:45,872 --> 01:50:50,832
that, I guess,
that made it more significant.

1421
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:54,505
The initial thought was,
"Do we really have a chance here?"

1422
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:57,344
We felt their presence
at the beginning of the game,

1423
01:50:57,416 --> 01:51:00,977
when they came out
with this incredible effort and zeal.

1424
01:51:01,053 --> 01:51:06,424
I think the most significant...
It's when David Lattin made his dunk shot -

1425
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:08,324
that's what really got us going.

1426
01:51:08,395 --> 01:51:12,593
And I went up, and he grabbed it,
and he just kept going up and up and up.

1427
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:14,657
And he just dunked it
over the top of me.

1428
01:51:14,735 --> 01:51:18,671
He put it down with such ferocity
that it intimidated me.

1429
01:51:18,739 --> 01:51:23,574
And I did tell David before the game,
if he hadn't run over somebody,

1430
01:51:23,644 --> 01:51:27,045
that I wanted him to tear the rim off
a couple of times.

1431
01:51:27,114 --> 01:51:33,280
But those two steals by Bobby Joe Hill
broke our back

1432
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:37,552
and reinforced what the reality was.

1433
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:40,992
And the reality was this:

1434
01:51:41,062 --> 01:51:43,223
They were bigger and they were better

1435
01:51:43,298 --> 01:51:47,234
and they were more talented and they were
quicker. They were a better team.

1436
01:51:47,302 --> 01:51:50,863
Kentucky was kind of a tough team
to match up against.

1437
01:51:50,939 --> 01:51:53,772
See, that was a very, very quick team.

1438
01:51:53,841 --> 01:51:59,040
And I played the guys
that I felt we could win with.

1439
01:51:59,113 --> 01:52:02,844
We ran out there.
And what I saw was wall-to-wall people.

1440
01:52:04,252 --> 01:52:07,984
The reporter was white.
The cheerleaders was white.

1441
01:52:08,057 --> 01:52:10,821
The referee was white.
The camera people was white.

1442
01:52:10,893 --> 01:52:16,354
It was an atmosphere that could have been
real hostile for us if we allowed it to be.

1443
01:52:16,432 --> 01:52:22,928
I feel that this game was probably
the Emancipation Proclamation of 1966.

1444
01:52:23,005 --> 01:52:28,500
And it wasn't until history started to talk
about this game, you know, in that context,

1445
01:52:28,577 --> 01:52:31,569
that we realized we were part
of something that was bigger

1446
01:52:31,647 --> 01:52:33,808
than just five blacks and five whites.

1447
01:52:33,882 --> 01:52:38,217
Black ballplayers were thought of
as inferior.

1448
01:52:38,288 --> 01:52:44,056
You know, can't work under pressure. You
know, rip 'em a little bit, and they'll fold.

1449
01:52:44,127 --> 01:52:48,655
That was the way that a white person
was thinking back then,

1450
01:52:48,732 --> 01:52:52,190
that we couldn't compete
with the white players.

1451
01:52:52,269 --> 01:52:55,432
We experienced a lot of racism
during that season.

1452
01:52:55,505 --> 01:53:02,843
People would spit at you,
and fans would call us niggers, coons...

1453
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:09,212
And the world looked at it
in that perspective -

1454
01:53:09,287 --> 01:53:13,553
the white team verses this black team.
For us.

1455
01:53:13,624 --> 01:53:16,650
We were playing for much more
than what they were playing for.

1456
01:53:16,727 --> 01:53:19,662
They were playing
for just another championship.

1457
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:24,064
We were playing to prove that it doesn't
make any difference what color you were -

1458
01:53:24,135 --> 01:53:28,834
if you're given the opportunity,
you could do anything.

1459
01:53:28,906 --> 01:53:32,865
If I could turn back the hands of time,

1460
01:53:32,943 --> 01:53:39,713
I would have love to have gone over
to the Kentucky players

1461
01:53:39,785 --> 01:53:41,912
and shaken their hands.

1462
01:53:41,987 --> 01:53:44,922
Not to patronize them, you know?

1463
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:48,926
And not to say,
"Thank you for giving me an opportunity."

1464
01:53:48,994 --> 01:53:52,486
You didn't give us this opportunity.
We earned this, see.

1465
01:53:52,564 --> 01:53:57,592
I'm proud to be part of this portrayal
of a great, great man in Don Haskins

1466
01:53:57,669 --> 01:54:02,197
and, you know, players
who simply cared about being great

1467
01:54:02,274 --> 01:54:05,539
and wanting to separate themselves
from the pack

1468
01:54:05,610 --> 01:54:10,207
and wanting to do something unique.

1469
01:54:10,283 --> 01:54:14,379
And to leave footprints in the sand.
They've done that, man.

1470
01:54:14,454 --> 01:54:16,581
They've done that.
