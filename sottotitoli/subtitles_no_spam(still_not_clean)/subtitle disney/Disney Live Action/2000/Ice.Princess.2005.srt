Casey?

31
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,318
- Something wrong, Mr. Bast?
- No, not at all.

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,555
I was curious if you'd started
weighing your college options.

33
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,524
Options? Uh...

34
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:51,226
Heard of the Helen Stoller
Physics Scholarship?

35
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:53,795
- No.
- It's given to a student
in this part of the state

36
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:56,398
who shows the most promise
in the sciences.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,668
Wouldn't that be
Ann or... Wyatt?

38
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,470
No, it's you.

39
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,906
You have a calling, Casey.

40
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:06,408
I do?

41
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,477
- What is it?
- Physics.

42
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,711
Toast?

43
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:12,814
- Uh... sure.
- You're very lucky.

44
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:15,817
Most people search their
whole lives for their calling.

45
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,653
How do you know
if you have a calling?

46
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,555
Your brilliant teacher
tells you so.

47
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:23,358
And of course your 11 straight
A-pluses on exams is a hint.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,361
You'll need a letter from me
for the scholarship

49
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:29,698
and think about a special
physics project over the summer.

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,501
Something unusual but personal.

51
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,937
Let them know you a little.

52
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,839
- He says it's my calling.
- QED.

53
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:42,377
How is this "quite easily
demonstrated"? You're as good
in physics as I am.

54
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,948
Not even close.
I grind, you glide.

55
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,849
Event horizon.

56
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:53,589
One day that guy
is gonna wake up and
realize he needs a math tutor.

57
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,491
And that tutor will be me.

58
00:03:56,493 --> 00:04:01,230
Figure out how to get us
invited to even one party
and you win the Nobel.

59
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:22,484
Hey, you're Casey, right?

60
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,686
Uh-huh.

61
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:28,357
Here's an invite
to my boyfriend's party.

62
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,292
Wow.

63
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,561
You're in chem lab
with Julian Wilson, right?

64
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,630
- Mm-hm.
- Can you give that to him?

65
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:36,665
Thanks.

66
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,737
That was way inconsiderate.

67
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,872
I love Mr. Bast.

68
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:47,676
If he uncovered a scholarship
I didn't know about,
he's a genius.

69
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,279
And to think they pay him
almost nothing.

70
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:54,683
The devaluation of teachers
in our society, it just...

71
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,518
- It blows my mind.
- Mom.

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,354
I'm back. Sorry.

73
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,558
I have to figure out
what he wants from me.

74
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,361
I mean, what is
a personal science project?

75
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:11,566
Isn't the nature of science
supposed to be completely
unbiased and factual?

76
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,702
Now he wants the inner me, too?

77
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,937
The whole secret
of the study of nature

78
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,674
lies in learning
how to use one's eyes.

79
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:21,677
- You know who said that?
- I'm guessing it was a woman.

80
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,412
That was written by George Sand,

81
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:25,647
a woman forced
to use a man's name

82
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,649
because she
couldn't get published.

83
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,751
- Mom.
- Okay.

84
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:32,354
Anyway,
I always tell my students,

85
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:36,058
"You'll know your topic when
you learn how to use your eyes."

87
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh! Oh, no...

88
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:47,336
She had it locked up.

89
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:51,573
I need to eat ice cream
and all your mother
has is leftover tofu.

90
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:54,576
- Can we go?
- Sh! Sh!

91
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:56,845
Look at that recovery! Amazing.

92
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:59,114
She'll still place.

93
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:05,387
She's so precise.
I mean, down to the last...

94
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,059
You know...

95
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:15,630
I bet there is an exact
aerodynamic formula.

119
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:18,487

120
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,822

you perfectly well know.

00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:23,091
No, I'm a student.

122
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:24,893

123
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:29,764

Whoa, yeah.

125
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:40,008
Definitely spy code.

127
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,247
She's a science geek.

128

Look, I'm sorry,
but when the CIA
wants to learn new dirty tricks,

129
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:57,659
they observe figure skaters
and their moms.

130
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,861
- Tina, can I have a word?
- Frank, not now.

131
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:02,264
I want to digitize
some images into my computer

132
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:05,767
to see if any kind of
unified theory emerges.

133
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,136
Okay, if Gen knows you
and you wanna

00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:11,873
press your nose up against
the glass and take a few notes,

135
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,808
I don't really care.

136
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,311
But you're gonna have
a hard sell with the parents.

137
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,615
Absolutely not.

138
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:23,151
But no one outside of
the scholarship committee

139
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:25,687
will ever see this program.

140
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:30,759
Here's the letter
from my teacher
explaining the assignment.

141
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:34,262
And my driver's license.

142
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:39,034
Um... I've also got
some letters of references
from people I babysat for.

143
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:43,104
[Tina] Let's keep
it moving, girls.

144
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:47,943
It's possible.
We'll have the Team Nikki
legal team check this out.

145
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,316
- [woman] Beautiful, sweetie.
- [girl] Thanks, Mom!

146
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,152
No talking to my daughter.
She's training.

147
00:09:57,154 --> 00:10:00,355
No distraction.

148
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,824
Not a word. No.

149
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:08,697
Look, I don't care
if you're here.

150
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,633
If you post me on the school
website falling on my butt,

151
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:14,836
you'd better transfer
to another school.

152
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:17,005
[Coach] Okay, Nikki.
Let's try that again.

153
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,240
[Tina] Keep it moving.

154
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:23,378
[Tina] A little wider,
that's it.

155
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:28,216
Hey! No street shoes
on the ice!

156
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:35,223
I'm sorry... Sorry.

157
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:48,837
[boy] Gen!

158
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:56,344
Hello, hon.

159
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:58,279
Gen!

160
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:02,283
Gen! Brian, she's training.
You know the rules.

161
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:05,086
- I brought a burger, Mrs. H.
- Gen can't eat that.

162
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:08,890
- Come on, Mom,
I'm burning tons of calories.
- Not enough.

163
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:11,026
- A half-hour break?
- Not if you wanna win.

164
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:14,963
You should coach
our basketball team.
We could use a kick in the butt.

165
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,366
If you don't leave this instant,
that's exactly what you'll get.

166
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,840
[Gen] Bye.

167
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:34,683
I do not want him coming here
during practice.

168
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:38,186
But I never get to see him.
Every other girl I know...

169
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:40,155
You're not like the other girls.

170
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,691
Winners make sacrifices.

171
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,392
Maybe they just cheat.

172
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,364
- Turn that off!
- Sorry.

173
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:52,434
Take it from the layback.

174
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:17,158
The conclusion's too simplistic.

175
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,027
The kinetic energy in a jump

176
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,263
equals half the skater's mass
times velocity squared, minus...

177
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:25,033
No, I could barely
understand it.

178
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,434
But...?

179
00:12:26,436 --> 00:12:28,269
I don't know if they'll care

180
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:31,106
but it's just a little bit...

181
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:32,841
dry.

182
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:35,110
Mr. Bast said
I have to make it personal.

183
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:38,446
- How do I do that?
- I don't know.

184
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,482
Put more you in it.

185
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:46,254
Oh, excuse me, Tina.

186
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:49,491
Is there any way that I could
take a few lessons?

187
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:53,194
I think I might
be able to write better
about the physics principles

188
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:55,263
if I'm the one
actually applying them.

189
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,799
- If there's any way I could...
- Fine.

190
00:12:57,801 --> 00:13:00,168
We're starting a novice class
for the summer.

191
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,036
Three afternoons a week.

192
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:03,972
$800.

193
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,474
$800?

194
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:09,911
- Popcorn! I want popcorn!
- Where are my Gummi Bears?

195
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,847
- I gave them to you.
- [boy] Four hot dogs!

196
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:16,117
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- You touched that
with your fingers.

197
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:18,386
Oh, fine. You don't want
any more? I'll eat it.

198
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:20,855
Oh, you breathed on it!

199
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:24,859
You shouldn't work here.

200
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,130
You're here again?

201
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:33,334
Um... I'm working.
It's for my science project.

202
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:36,237
Aren't you going a little
overboard with this project?

203
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:38,206
No, I'm totally committed to it,

204
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,041
like you're committed
to skating.

205
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:41,876
Whatever. I'm starving.

206
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:44,012
BLT here.
Hold the B, heavy on the L.

207
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:45,580
Um... sure.

208
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:49,951
Beef patty. Squish it
till it's dry. No bun.

209
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:52,086
- Salad for me.
- Coming up.

210
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:56,858
Just iceberg lettuce,
half a cup of garbanzos
and a lemon wedge.

211
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,296
Oh, and a quarter cup of cheese.

212
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,164
Ooh, cheese!

213
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,434
It's Saturday.
I can pig out if I want to.

214
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:08,937
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm popping my Lutz.

215
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,139
It's all that cheese.

216
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,508
Would you shut up?

217
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,343
[Tiffany] I've gotta focus.

218
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:17,846
I heard Zoey Bloch's
been sticking a quad.

219
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:20,949
That is a rumor. Which she
probably started herself.

220
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:23,284
Early in the season
for stupid head games.

221
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:25,086
[Gen] Not for Zoey.

222
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,554
Food's ready!

223
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:35,463
That is way more
than a quarter cup.

224
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:38,266
Um... It's $1.65,

225
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,201
$2.35 and $3.35.

226
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:42,937
That's $7.30 total. Or if you
split it the other way,

227
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:45,306
it's $1.75 and $5.55.

228
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:49,510
Whoa. You can keep it all
if you just stop doing that.

229
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:51,379
[laughter]

230
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:54,249
You're welcome.

231
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,121
All right, everybody.

232
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:02,423
Welcome to our
Snowplow Sam class.

233
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:04,559
Let's line up.

234
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,601
Lookin' good.

235
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:21,142
Class, can you tell our
teacher's assistant the most
important rule for this class?

236
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:23,111
- Mom...
- [all] Never be late.

237
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:26,547
Right. We have a lot to do

238
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,485
if we are going to be ready
for our recital in August.

239
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:33,621
We are going to
work on our toe loop.

240
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,993
Our Lutz.

241
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:44,565
[children gasp]

242
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:47,669
But first, all of you
have to get comfortable

243
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:51,239
with throwing
your bodies into the air.

244
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,374
Casey, you're the physics whiz.

245
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,543
What's that rule
about what goes up?

246
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:58,646
Well, technically, it's that
every particle attracts...

247
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,348
Casey.

248
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,384
Must come down.

249
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:12,226
This... is your new best friend.

250
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,110
Oh! Oh...

251
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,546
Look, could you try
not to, like, squish me?

252
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:33,214
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,083
Casey.
Pull your arms in tighter.

254
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,617
They're throwing you
off balance.

255
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,586
- Arms in.
- Okay.

256
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:41,055
Now try that
about 5,000 more times.

257
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:44,625
- Right.
- [Tina] Push over
on your right leg.

258
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:48,563
[Tina] Don't look at your feet.
Look straight ahead.

259
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:53,401
Jeremy! That toe pick
is there for a reason!

260
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:58,106
You dig it in.
Or no friends over for a week.

261
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:00,408
This is a lot of pressure
for a recital.

262
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,380
It's not only a recital.
It's a U.S.F.S.A.J.S.T.

263
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:07,115
Earth speak, please?

264
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:11,586
It's the first step in
qualifying for the regionals.

265
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:14,489
- I mean for us kids.
- Oh.

266
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,358
- You don't have to do it.
- That's good.

267
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,527
Because it's not
humanly possible.

Hey, don't you know anything?

286
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:52,753
No skating when
the Zamboni's out.

287
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:55,423
I'm fine. I'm fine.

288
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,493
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're fine?

00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:10,538
Look, you wanna tell me
what was in your head?

293
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,808
I've never skated on
such a smooth surface before.

294
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,811
I wanted to see
what it was like.

295
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:20,314
- Lake skater?
- Pond. Near my house.

296
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:26,187
- Look, you need a hand.
- No! I'm good to go.

297
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,591
Oh!

[Teddy laughs]

299
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,467
You must really want that A.

300
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,206
Wow, that's a lot of Styrofoam.

301
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,575
It's not for an A.

302
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,744
It's for a physics scholarship.

303
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:56,784
What, like, uh... inertia and
drag and velocity and all that?

304
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:59,287
- How do you know about that?
- I'm into cars.

305
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,390
Get this baby out on the road,
I can open her up to...

306
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:03,891
seven miles an hour.

307
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:07,895
Blow the doors off any
street-sweeper in town.

308
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:18,706
Um... I should get home.

309
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,741
Yeah, you should.

310
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:24,946
Can't do the ice
until you're off.

311
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:27,381
Right.

312
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:28,716
Sure.

313
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:30,918
Well...

314
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,535
How's it coming?

315
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,437
It's coming.

316
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:53,407
It takes incredible
training and effort

317
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,710
and there's artistry involved
but I'm sorry,

318
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,280
I just can't get past
the twinky little outfits.

319
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:02,817
Mom, they're actually
very aerodynamically sound.

320
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:05,753
It sets us back 50 years.

321
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:10,324
If I ever saw you squeezed
into one of those things,
I'd probably start crying.

322
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:12,893
Believe me, you never will.

Please?

00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:19,867
Hello.

327
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:22,303
This is my video presentation.

328
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:24,639
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle.

329
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:26,440
Cut a second.

330
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,542
I sound like
a driver's ed movie.

331
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:31,279
[Ann] Relax. Do it just
like you're talking to me.

332
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,748
Hey, there. I'm Casey.

333
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:37,585
Oh, my God.
I forgot my last name.

334
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,819
Can I start over?

335
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:41,589
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle.

336
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:45,693
I decided to see
if I could make myself prove
my own hypothesis

337
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:51,432
on the application of physics
to the required elements
of competitive figure skating.

338
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:56,037
Now, I'm going to increase
the centripetal force

339
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,339
by tucking in my arms.

340
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,875
This will increase
my moment of inertia,

341
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:03,377
so I will spin...

342
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,779
faster.

343
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,647
I'll increase
the height of my jump

344
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:09,684
by applying more force
to my toe pick.

345
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:17,591
- You know, you look kinda hot.
- Shut up.

346
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:19,627
I'm gonna start off
with a bad one.

347
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,629
For the before shot.

348
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:27,935
- Yeah, that pretty much blew.
- Okay.

349
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:31,339
- Now you're making me mad.
- [Ann] Good.

350
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:57,932
When you sign with Nike,

351
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:01,068
remember I wear
size six and a half.

352
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:06,073
I want to do the recital.

353
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,908
For science.

354
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:12,046
Be here tonight, 5:30.

355
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:14,648
Okay.

356
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,985
Mm! Tina...

357
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:20,621
I have this Harvard
alumni tea thing at three.

358
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,556
Then, what are we talking about?

359
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,459
No, it's okay. I'll make it.

360
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,929
Um...

361
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:31,632
You have nothing to wear.

362
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:35,436
Come by my house at noon.
Maybe one of my old things
will work for you.

363
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:38,038
Wow. Okay.

364
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:43,778
What?

365
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,881
[Casey] Thanks!

366
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,533
[knock on door]

367
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:08,135

- Just a second!

00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:16,644
Hold on!

370
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:20,080
- Almost ready?
- Uh-huh.

371
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:23,984
I have a surprise for you.

372
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:32,693
That does it.

373
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:34,061
Perfect.

374
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:36,831
I think the whole effect
is very grown up,

375
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,767
with a nod to femininity.

376
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,937
We've evolved past flaunting it,
but we don't have to deny it.

377
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,905
I mean, you are
going to be mingling

378
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:49,176
with your future prospective
classmates and professors,

379
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:51,612
and I really wanted
the look to say,

380
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,581
"We are serious."

381
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,717
Well, it definitely succeeds.

382
00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:00,754
Mom, we don't have to stay
at this thing for more
than an hour, right?

383
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:04,258
Um, because... there's
something I have to tell you.

384
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,128
Oh... Oh, honey.

385
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,263
What was that?

386
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:10,998
I've been so worried.

387
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,867
You've been living at that rink,

388
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:15,569
but you're here, now.

389
00:25:15,571 --> 00:25:20,241
And you're excited,
because you understand
what's really important.

390
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:22,610
Look, I've got goose bumps.

391
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,650
I'm sorry, that was so
type A of me. Mom disease.

392
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:32,553
Just relax.
Just be yourself.

393
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:35,656
Your normal, poised,
charming, articulate...

394
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:36,857
Mom...

395
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,660
Do you wanna go over it
one more time?

396
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:43,931
Hi. I'm Casey Carlyle,

397
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:47,701
and I'm attracted to
the physics program because...

398
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:49,603
Physics rocks.

399
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:52,973
In sophomore year, you can join
the Quantum Club and that rocks

400
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:56,744
because we compete against
Cal Tech, MIT and Stanford.

401
00:25:56,746 --> 00:26:00,147
Last year, our ion particle
accelerator took first place.

402
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:01,749
It rocked.

403
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:05,152
Sounds really, um... rockin'.

404
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:07,054
It is, it really is.

405
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:09,023
Do you know
what I think is great?

406
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,825
If everything works out
with Casey's scholarship,

407
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:17,631
I'm sensing that you two will be
spending scads of time together.

408
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:21,702
Hors d'oeuvre?

409
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:24,805
Oh, how wonderful, bruschetta.

410
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:27,942
If you have some time right now,

411
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:32,046
I'll take you through the entire
physical sciences syllabus.

412
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:36,884
We have got nothing but time!
Don't we, Case?

413
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,252
Great!

414
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:43,257
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.

415
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,226
That's the first rule.

416
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:53,033
[Tina] All right,
let's get ready. Come on.

417
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:55,703
- That's what she said...
- I have to do two turns...

418
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,671
- Really?
- Yeah.

419
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:01,308
We're supposed to go round
the side, remember?

420
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,613
- Oh...
- It's right there.

421
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:08,082
- Right there, is that better?
- Yeah...

422

Deep breath.

423
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:25,165
And then you let it out.

424
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:28,002
- It didn't work.
- Come on.

425
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,405
Okay, everybody.

426
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:33,874
[Tina] I'll take that.

427
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:35,809
- [whispers] Good luck.
- Thanks.

428
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:37,845

It's in the improvement
in the skating
of three junior champions.

1035

I also applied the findings
to my own skating and...

1036

implement the experiment

1037
01:09:57,717 --> 01:10:03,254

and entirely personal way.

Well, good, because
passion is a key component
of what we look for in students.

in front of you?

1059
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,668

I had an unfortunate warm-up
before my short program.

I collided with another skater

I was suspended.

1074

I was 26 and it was too late.

- She's already rubbed off
on you.

No, it's not enough. She'll
have to settle for silver.

This takes her to nationals
and who knows,

1244
01:30:23,842 --> 01:30:26,476
maybe the 2006 Olympics.

1245

If I'd just taken ten minutes

1250
01:30:51,603 --> 01:30:53,737
and gone to the rink with you,

come from?!

Don't you know what'll happen
after six months with Tina?

- What?
- She's gonna whip my butt!

01:32:27,132 --> 01:32:32,736
- Someone is gonna pay big time.
- Nikki. Can we have a word?

1266
01:32:32,738 --> 01:32:35,872
- Hello, Peter.
- Just wanted to say congrats.

1267
01:32:35,874 --> 01:32:39,042
We look forward to seeing the
Jumping Shrimp at the Nationals.

1268
01:32:39,044 --> 01:32:44,314
That is so sweet. I just went
out there and skated my best.

1269
01:32:44,316 --> 01:32:48,685
And today, I guess
my best was good enough.

- Love you.
- [squeak]

1271
01:32:55,893 --> 01:32:59,195
You know I can't afford this.
We'll need to find a sponsor.

1272
01:32:59,197 --> 01:33:01,698
I'm on it.
Burger Blast is interested.

1273

Burger Blast? Oh no, I am sorry.
I'm sorry, no.

1274
01:33:06,271 --> 01:33:10,173
- Why not?
- Well, if she can't eat it,
she can't endorse it.

1275
01:33:10,175 --> 01:33:13,977
We'll need something healthier.
How about Grape-Nuts?

1276
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:17,013
Grape-Nuts?
What about cod liver oil?

1277
01:33:17,015 --> 01:33:19,649
- Guys.
- You know, I am her mother.

1278
01:33:19,651 --> 01:33:21,751
What I say goes.
She is my daughter.

1279
01:33:21,753 --> 01:33:24,888
- She is my skater.
- Well, daughter trumps skater.

1280
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:29,793
Well, ask any professional
athlete, coach trumps mother
every time.

1281

Guys!

1282
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,635
And that boy, we'll need to
nip that in the bud.

1283
01:33:38,637 --> 01:33:40,837
I can't go through all this
and a boy too.

1284

That is a huge distraction.
It's unacceptable.

I don't believe this!

1286
01:33:45,277 --> 01:33:47,177
You will be busy training.

01:33:47,179 --> 01:33:49,245
And four college courses.

1288
01:33:49,247 --> 01:33:53,283
Four? Are you out of your mind,
with everything she's doing?

1289
01:33:53,285 --> 01:33:55,285
All right, two.

1290
01:33:55,287 --> 01:33:57,220
But then four in the fall.

1291
01:33:57,222 --> 01:33:58,888
Only if she wins sectionals.

1292
