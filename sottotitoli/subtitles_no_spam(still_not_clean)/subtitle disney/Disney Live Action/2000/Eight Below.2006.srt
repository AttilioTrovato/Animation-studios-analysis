1
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,952
All right, Coop.
A hundred and five degrees.

2
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:39,581
- What do you say?
- 105? I can go more.

3
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,794
- 107.

4
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,298
- 108.
- I'm feeling it.

5
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,092
109.

6
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,469
OK, the suspense is killing me.

7
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,971
- All right, 110.
- 110?

8
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,099
- 110.
- A hundred and ten toasty ones.

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,226
Right. Ready to go out
and greet the heat?

10
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,853
The warm wind in my hair?

11
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,312
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

12
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,439
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

13
13:59:59,983 --> 00:00:00,000
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,954
Thirty-one. Thirty-one degrees.

14
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,124
- Thirty-one below.
- Thirty-one below! New record!

15
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,293
- Thirty-one below!
- New record!

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,588
New record! Oh, it's cold!

17
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,374
I hate to do this, but...

18
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,709
Rise and shine, kids.
No more sleeping in.

19
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,592
All right.
If "rise and shine" won't work...

20
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,386
Is anybody hungry this morning?

21
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,014
Attaboy, Max.

22
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,185
Hey, what do you say?
Ready for exercise before breakfast?

23
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,730
How you doing?

24
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,190
How does right field look?

25
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,778
I think it looks pretty good.
What do you say, Max? Here we go.

26
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,905
Go get it!

27
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,161
Hey, Maya.

28
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,206
How's my best girl doing, huh?

29
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,250
How you doing?

30
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,043
You keeping everybody in line?

31
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,173
Left field. Go get it.

32
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,341
Left field, Maya. Here we go.

33
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,262
Go get it!

34
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,724
Attaboy, Max. Come here, buddy.

35
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,151
Settle down.
There's plenty to go around, guys.

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,694
Here you go, Shorty.

37
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,322
Good boy, Shadow.

38
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,825
Dewey. Truman.

39
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,160
There you go, Old Jack.

40
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,720
That's my best girl.
Here, I'll trade you.

41
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,804
There you go, Maya.

42
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,155
- Hi.
- Hey.

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,283
- Didn't think I'd see you this year.
- Guess you got lucky.

44
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,826
- I guess so.
- Crazy Katie!

45
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,872
- Did you get your pilot's license yet?
- Oh, Coop, I missed you.

46
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,376
OK.

47
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,547
- Got that?
- Yeah. 

48
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,423
Hey, hey, careful with that.

49
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:02,177
That equipment's made it 10,000 miles.
I'd hate that to change in six feet.

50
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,012
Sorry about that.

51
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,557
Hi. I'm Dr. Davis McClaren.

52
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,642
Earth and Space Sciences UCLA.

53
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,938
Jerry Shepard, expedition guide.
Welcome to the bottom of the world.

54
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,523
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

55
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,734
Go any further south,
you'll fall off the planet.

56
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,112
Well, that'd be unfortunate.

57
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:24,032
Charlie Cooper, cartographer,
mechanical engineer, runway paver.

58
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,035
- Nice to meet you.
- Dr. McClaren! Welcome to the ice.

59
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,539
Andy Harrison, NSF science director.
An honor to meet you.

60
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,458
- Dr. Rosemary Paris, field coordinator.
- Nice to meet you.

61
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,918
You've met our team?

62
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,172
Yeah, Mr. Cooper was just taking
good care of all my things.

63
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,008
Cooper, really?
First time for everything, I suppose.

64
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,801
- Let's get you inside.
- Thanks.

65
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,096
- Sure.
- Yeah.

66
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,019
OK. Lady luck, in my corner.

67
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,771
-What are we playing?
- She is pretty.

68
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,399
- Quarter in.
- Quarter.

69
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,277
- You're going down.
- You're going down.

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,029
Crazy Katie, you're going down.

71
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,573
- Hey, doc, you want in?
- No, thanks.

72
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,450
I gave up gambling a long time ago.

73
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,827
Hey, you flew in with Katie, didn't you?

74
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:12,497
- Remind me how you're getting home.

75
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,293
Say, Old Jack, you in or out, buddy?

76
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,173
- Translation?
- That'd be out.

77
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,761
- So, Coop, how's the new girlfriend?
- Mmm.

78
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,972
How's my new girl?

79
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,641
I don't know.

80
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,143
- How about hot?
- Wow.

81
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,604
- Huh? 
-  Wow.

82
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,649
She's a scientist too.
At the Italian base.

83
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,150
- Pretty and smart.
- Smarts.

84
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,778
Yeah. Notice something
missing in that picture?

85
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,448
OK, OK. I think...
I know you mean me.

86
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,244
You're talk... The picture's coming.
She's sending one of the two of us, OK?

87
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,453
Patience, Jer.

88
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,872
- Uh-huh. How many?
- Two.

89
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,750
Doc, you looking forward
to your first trip to Dry Valleys?

90
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,586
It's a pretty cool spot
this time of year.

91
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,130
Actually, Dr. McClaren
needs to get to Mt. Melbourne

92
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,341
to search for his meteorite.

93
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,846
Melbourne, huh?

94
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,889
Nobody said anything about Melbourne.

95
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,642
Yeah. Meteorite hunting
is a pretty small world

96
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,229
and, uh, I didn't want anybody
to know where I was really going,

97
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,982
'cause I'm looking
for something special at Melbourne

98
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,734
and the NSF let us
keep it off the paperwork.

99
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,863
Is there a problem?

100
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,533
Look, doc, let me show you something.

101
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,330
I'll show you on the map.

102
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,292
- This is where we are, right? OK.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,002
Here's Dry Valleys.

104
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:44,047
All the way over here, Mt. Melbourne.
Twice as far and the opposite direction.

105
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,800
I've been over our route twice
in the last week,

106
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,137
but I haven't been to Mt. Melbourne
since the beginning of the season.

107
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,390
Well, that may be so. But
Dr. McClaren has traveled a long way.

108
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,894
- If we can accommodate him, we should.
- Andy, it's the end of January.

109
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,897
The ice is too thin and snowmobiles
would be too dangerous.

110
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,025
There's only one way
to make that trip, with the dogs.

111
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,152
The dogs?

112
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,698
OK. Will they be able
to carry all my gear?

113
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,783
The dogs'll be fine.

114
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,828
- It's really late in the season.
- Last year we had the dogs out

115
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,372
right up until the day we left.

116
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,921
All right, Andy.
You're the boss. I'll get things ready.

117
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,344
- Hey, you need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

118
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,970
Coop, say good night to Buck.

119
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,142
Uh, I'm gonna take a rain check, Jer.

120
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,812
Ah...

121
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,689
Kids, come on! Let's go! 

122
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,901
Everyone outside. Let's get you
tucked into bed. Come on.

123
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,536
Good, Jack.

124
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,788
Good boy. I'll see you in the morning.

125
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,210
Hey, Maya.

126
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,713
What do you say? One more trip, huh?

127
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,175
Then we'll get you to McMurdo
for the winter. That sound good?

128
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,595
Huh? That sound good? That's my girl.

129
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,685
Hey, Max. I need a good trip out of you.

130
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,149
Lucky star, huh? Let's hope so.

131
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,777
See you in the morning, Max.

132
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,119
Knock, knock.

133
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,954
- Hey.
- Hey.

134
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,290
I warmed up some of
your favorite ice cream.

135
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,834
Strawberry.
That's your favorite ice cream.

136
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,462
Yeah, well, you got here early.
I didn't have time to go shopping.

137
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:52,134
Uh, yeah, well, they changed things up.

138
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,011
How you been?

139
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,096
Been a good season. Kids are doing well.

140
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,725
Maya's been awesome.
Old Jack's getting a bit older, so...

141
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,311
Jerry, I was asking you how you've been.

142
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,110
I'm not interrupting or anything, am I?

143
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,279
No, Rosie. We were just catching up.

144
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,823
OK.

145
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,037
All right, well, uh...

146
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,372
I guess I'll see you guys
in the morning, then.

147
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,041
Thank you. That was sweet.

148
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,669
No problem. Good night.

149
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,713
Good night.

150
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,476
- Pardon me.
- Oh, sorry.

151
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,853
- Oh!

152
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,023
Oh! Head's up.

153
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:53,028
Sad fact of life in this place, doc.
Floor is more comfy than the bunks.

154
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,822
So, what is it exactly that you do here?

155
00:10:55,906 --> 00:11:00,369
Cartography. I spent the last two years
mapping every inch of this territory.

156
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,414
Hey, dude.
What happened? You strike out?

157
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,212
No. I didn't even swing.

158
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:14,800
Ah, went down looking.
That's still a strike-out, Jer.

159
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,304
- Ow! Ow!
-Sorry about that, buddy.

160
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,139
I didn't see you there.

161
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,690
We turn the heat off at night, so if
there's anything you need to keep warm,

162
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,400
I suggest you sleep with it.

163
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,362
Incoming.

164
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,156
Ow! Jerry!

165
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,325
- Man!

166
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,417
OK, this is the last of it.

167
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,758
Wow, doc.
Won't be losing you, now, will we?

168
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,762
All right, rule number one.

169
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,641
If you want to approach the dogs,
approach them from the front. OK?

170
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,435
- See how the lines are taut?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,938
I want them like that at all times.
If the line's tangled, they'll fight.

172
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,773
- We don't want that.
- Got it.

173
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,985
- Anything else I should know?
- The rest is pretty much up to me.

174
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,112
I gotta watch them.
They're working dogs.

175
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,615
They'll run themselves to death.
They love work.

176
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,326
All right, official introductions.

177
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,579
Up here in front, on lead,
we got my best girl, Maya.

178
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,664
Next to her we got Old Jack.

179
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:31,543
Just turned ten, and, uh, he's
actually getting ready for retirement.

180
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,421
Back here,
the white one, this is Shorty.

181
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,257
And next to him is the pup
of the bunch. That's Max.

182
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,884
He's still in training.

183
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,929
He's got the right stuff.
I expect big things out of him.

184
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,431
Right here, we got the twins.
This is Truman.

185
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,142
Truman took a bite
out of Dewey a couple years ago.

186
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,853
- Notice the scar above Dewey's eye?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,649
Yeah. Well, they've been
buddies ever since, so...

188
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,693
Back here, last but not least,
we got the two malamutes.

189
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:00,030
The gray one's Shadow
and the red one's his buddy, Buck.

190
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,242
All brawn and absolutely no brain.
But we love 'em.

191
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:08,038
- Everyone good to go this morning?
- Yeah, I think so.

192
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,624
I was just being introduced
to Maya, Old Jack,

193
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,293
Shorty, Max, Truman,
Dewey, Shadow and Buck.

194
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,337
- Excellent.
- Jer?

195
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:20,008
- Be careful out there, OK?
- Always.

196
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,593
Take care of Cooper for me.

197
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,137
Don't worry. I'll give him
plenty of food and water.

198
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,722
OK, enough. Are we done?

199
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,977
I'd like a picture of our
intrepid explorers, please. Thank you.

200
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,312
- All right. Hang on!

201
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,981
OK.

202
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,023
OK, you ready?

203
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,403
Uno, dos, tres.

204
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,531
- Handsome. So handsome.

205
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,285
Hey, Coop. You'd better get up here
and say goodbye to Buck.

206
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,540
Oh, yeah?

207
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,293
All right, uh, see you, Buck!

208
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,336
Safe... Safe trip, Buck.

209
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,506
No. Come over and say goodbye.
You're gonna give him a complex.

210
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,220
And what about my complex?

211
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,556
Come around... Come say goodbye to him.

212
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:13,270
I'm... I'm pretty sure he heard me
say goodbye, Jer. I don't...

213
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,857
OK. I don't know why you do this.

214
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,569
- OK.

215
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,488
See ya, Buck.

216
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,616
All right. You, uh...

217
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,828
You take care of the doctor
and, uh, Jerry, OK?

218
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:33,957
- Oh! Oh! Nasty!

219
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,459
Oh! That was disgusting!

220
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,754
I got dog spit all in my mouth
and my nose!

221
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,090
It's not funny. 

222
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,095
I don't see what's so funny. 

223
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,724
All right.
Take care, guys. We'll see you.

224
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,309
- Bye.
- See ya.

225
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,229
All right, team!
Last hike of the season!

226
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,813
Let's go! Hike! Hike!

227
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,429
Come on, Jack! Come on, Old Jack!

228
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,890
Let's go, Maya! Come on, girl!

229
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,466
Whoa! Whoa!

230
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,681
Whoa! Whoa!

231
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,230
What's the problem?

232
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:24,276
We got ice fields up ahead.
I don't know how thick the ice is.

233
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,987
That's why we couldn't take
the snowmobiles. Look.

234
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,906
So, what do we do?

235
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,034
I'm gonna change things up.

236
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,494
Put the dogs
in a fan formation for safety.

237
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,873
It's a little slower,
but it spreads the weight out.

238
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,292
That way if one of the dogs
falls through the ice,

239
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,379
the lead's long enough
so the rest don't follow.

240
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,633
Hike!

241
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,248
Hey, doc.

242
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,959
- You see that over there?
- What is that?

243
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,504
Here.

244
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,842
You see 'em?

245
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,594
I see 'em. What are they?
- Leopard seals.

246
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,888
More leopard than seal, if you ask me.

247
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,599
- Give 'em a wide birth?
- Yeah, we'll give 'em some space.

248
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,581
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

249
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,916
Whoa, kids! Whoa!

250
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,503
- What was that?
- We're on a glacier now.

251
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,964
We're gonna have to
take her slow, doc. Get off.

252
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,051
I want you to take the brake.
You're gonna run the sled. All right?

253
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,970
Heavy brake.

254
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,723
Follow my footprints.
Keep the sled on my footprints.

255
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,141
- I'll probe ahead.
- Got it.

256
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:22,603
This glacier's always moving,
so we have to be careful.

257
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,986
All right, doc. Keep two feet
on the brake if you need to.

258
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,156
- Just keep a steady go, all right?
- All right.

259
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,909
All right, kids, come on! Easy, now!

260
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,369
Nice and easy. Let's go.

261
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,392
All right, stop! Stop!

262
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,853
All right, hard brake, right there!

263
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,149
We got a crevasse right here.

264
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm not sure how big it is,
so we're gonna go around. OK.

265
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,740
We're gonna bring it over this way.
Slow and easy.

266
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,492
I'm gonna call Maya over,

267
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,828
and then I just want you
to let up ever so lightly, all right?

268
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:25,123
- All right, got it.
- All right, Maya, haw! Haw!

269
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,963
Haw! Haw!

270
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,506
Max, what are you doing?

271
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,675
Max, no. Haw!

272
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,220
Max! Stop! Stop, Max! Doc, stop!

273
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,975
 No!

274
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,399
- Hold on, doc!

275
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,070
Doc! Put both hands on the sled!
Both hands on the sled, doc!

276
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,410
Hike! Come on, Jack, take it home!

277
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,870
Come on, Maya, take her home!

278
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:06,874
Come on! Hike!

279
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,269
Oh, man!

280
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,437
You OK?

281
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,398
 Yeah.

282
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,619
Do me a favor.

283
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:48,081
Next time you decide to go to Melbourne,
don't pack so much stuff.

284
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,542
And try coming a bit earlier.

285
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,170
Andy said the trip was fine.
You agreed to go.

286
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,135
Andy's my boss. I do what he says.

287
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:03,722
If you didn't think it was safe,
you shouldn't have backed down.

288
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,449
- Easy.

289
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,832
Jerry, thanks for today.

290
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,087
Yeah. No problem.

291
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,178
Who's the artist?

292
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,181
My son, Eric.

293
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,685
He does one every trip.

294
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,190
He looks like your wife.

295
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,693
Lucky kid.

296
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,364
Yeah.

297
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,908
What about you? You got somebody?

298
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,076
Are you kidding me?

299
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,413
I'm here six months a year
dragging scientists around.

300
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,707
What kind of woman
would put up with that?

301
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,793
How about Katie?
Looked like you might've had something.

302
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:19,047
Yeah. A couple years ago we did.

303
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:22,426
You know how it goes. Sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't.

304
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,179
I guess relationships
don't fit my lifestyle.

305
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,725
Anyhow, come on. Let's go outside, guys.

306
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:33,395
We're gonna get an early start tomorrow.
Come on.Come on, Max.

307
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,814
Come on, Max. 

308
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,423
All right, whoa!

309
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,259
Doc, hold it. Put on the brake,
I'm gonna take it from here.

310
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:07,471
Yeah, got it. Whoa!

311
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,059
What do you say?

312
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,937
- That's something else.
- That's Melbourne.

313
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:19,983
- That's your home for the next week.
- Beautiful.

314
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,194
Ready, now! Hike!

315
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:40,087
Victoria,this is McMurdo Weather. Come in.

316
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,215
Victoria? This is McMurdo Weather.

317
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,676
This is Victoria. We copy you, Mactown.

318
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,555
Hi, Andy. It's Steve.Just checking status on your team.

319
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,307
We've got four at the base
and two in the field. Over.

320
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,268
Suggest you bring them in.

321
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,145
We have two massive low pressure systems moving south.

322
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:00,816
Control wants you in early
just to be safe. Over.

323
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,943
Copy that, Mactown. Over and out.

324
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,195
Get Jerry on the radio.

325
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,168
Wanna sling me a cup of that
when you get a chance?

326
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,211
Yeah, sure thing.

327
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,720
- You got her?
- Yeah, thanks.

328
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,641
How's that looking there?

329
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,978
Well, everything points
to the spot that we're on.

330
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,523
The next couple days
are gonna tell us a lot.

331
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,693
Field base to Melbourne. Come in.

332
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:47,362
Base to Melbourne. Come in.

333
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,532
Jerry?

334
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:52,659
Jerry, do you read me? Over.

335
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,120
Yeah, go for Melbourne. That you, Katie?

336
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,748
Jerry, we got a call from Mactown.

337
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:01,043
...major storm coming in. Over.

338
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:04,046
You'll have to go again.
We're in a bad spot here.

339
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:08,217
Jerry... back to field base.
Do you copy?

340
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:12,888
We got a major storm coming in.
Mactown wants you in right away. Over.

341
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,307
All right. Copy that. We'll be back.

342
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,351
When do we expect this storm?

343
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,563
Katie?

344
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,653
Sorry, doc. Looks like
we're gonna have to pack up.

345
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:32,366
- Well, when do we have to leave?
- We leave first thing, tomorrow.

346
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,018
- Listen, Jerry...
- You heard what she said.

347
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:05,065
Now, Jerry, look. I cannot
go back without at least trying.

348
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,609
Yeah, well, that's not your call.

349
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,653
No. It's not.

350
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,780
There's a major storm coming in,
all right?

351
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,949
Not a minor one, but a major.

352
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,660
Down here there's a big difference
between the two.

353
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,621
My job as your guide
is to get you back home in one piece,

354
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,498
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

355
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:25,043
But Jerry, we're talking
about a rock from another world.

356
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:29,631
This ice floe might give us the first
meteorite from the planet Mercury.

357
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,384
That could lead us
to discoveries we can't imagine.

358
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,678
When you climb a mountain,
go up a river,

359
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:39,183
the exciting part isn't what you know
is there. It's what you don't know.

360
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,978
It's what you might find,
and it's the same here.

361
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:47,149
I came halfway around the world to look
for something that's important to me.

362
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,484
Jerry, please, you...

363
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,323
You gotta take chances
for the things you care about.

364
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:01,038
Half the day on the east slope.

365
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,957
But I want to be back
on that sled tomorrow by noon.

366
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,877
I'll take that. I'll take that.

367
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,182
No.

368
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:33,088
Hey, we're running
out of time here, doc.

369
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,382
Believe me, I know.

370
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,954
Hey, Jerry.

371
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:10,292
- I think we got something here.
- Hey, wait, doc!

372
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,544
Doc, wait a minute. Doc, don't move.

373
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,338
You're outside the safety zone.

374
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:17,674
This is a big one.
Eleven centimeters across, fully intact.

375
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:20,802
It looks like a basalt,
but it's like nothing I've ever seen.

376
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,180
- Jerry!
- Doc! Doc, don't move.

377
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:26,308
That area's unchecked.
I told you to stay inside the flags.

378
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,519
Oh, my God. This is it!

379
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,103
Great, doc. Stay still.

380
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,440
I'm glad you found your rock,
but let's get you out of there.

381
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:37,027
Just follow your footsteps out.
Step right in your footprints.

382
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:42,324
Man, I knew I could find it! Huh?
What'd I tell you? This is it.

383
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,993
Half a day! Thank you.

384
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,788
Now that you scared the hell out of me,
can we go home now?

385
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,874
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

386
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:56,338
Victoria, this is Mactown. Come in.

387
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,423
Victoria here. We copy you, Mactown.

388
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:02,135
The approaching storm
has picked up speed and intensity.

389
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,514
We are sending you the coordinates.
Mactown out.

390
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:08,433
Copy that, Mactown.
Over and out.

391
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,686
Field base to Melbourne. Come in.

392
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,663
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

393
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,666
Whoa! Easy there, team! Easy.

394
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,209
What's up?

395
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,879
I got to do a patch job
on one of the kids.

396
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,339
Radio Katie.
See what's going on with that storm.

397
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:40,382
All right.

398
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:46,013
Ah, shoot. Looks like it's Old Jack.

399
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,806
Come here, Jack.

400
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,436
- Field base, come in.

401
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,271
- Field base, come in.
- All right.

402
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,106
- We'll get you fixed up.
- Field base?

403
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,442
Got something in your paw?

404
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,944
This is Melbourne team calling.

405
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,905
Field base, can we get a?

406
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,365
Doc!

407
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,919
- Are you OK?

408
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,298
I think I've broken my leg.

409
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,384
All right. All right,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

410
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:30,641
- Whoa!

411
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,685
- Whoa! Wait, doc! Don't move!

412
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,021
Doc! Doc!

413
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,194
Doc! Hey! Don't tread water!

414
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,487
Don't tread water!

415
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,491
Look at me! You see the ice? Davis.

416
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,576
Grab the ice!
Lt'll freeze you to it!

417
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,579
It takes you a lot longer to freeze
than it does to drown!

418
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,962
Good, good!
Davis, hang on! I'm coming down!

419
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,595
All right, kids, come on!

420
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:15,102
Hang on, doc!

421
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,571
- Maya, come here.

422
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,990
I can't... I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

423
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,033
Take deep breaths, doc.

424
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,247
Maya, take the rope.

425
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,875
Go to doc.

426
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:42,671
She's coming to you, doc.
She's coming to you.

427
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:45,674
OK, Maya, down.

428
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,217
Good girl. Crawl to the doc.

429
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:00,063
Come on, Maya, I got you. It's OK.

430
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:04,526
- Come on, doc, stay in there with me.

431
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,653
Come on, Maya.

432
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:11,366
Easy, Maya. Easy.

433
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,662
Good girl.

434
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:28,926
Good job, Maya. Put the line over him.

435
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,470
Good girl. Doc.

436
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,555
Keep your left arm
on the ice, like it is,

437
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,225
but I want you to reach up
with your right arm.

438
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:39,144
You gotta get your elbow
and your arm up through the loop.

439
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:42,105
You can do it. There you go.

440
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:47,027
Good job, doc. Yeah, just like that.

441
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,030
All right. Maya, come on.

442
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:55,744
Good girl, Maya. Good girl.

443
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:59,623
I got you, doc. I got you.

444
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,333
Keep it tight.

445
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,252
Line 'em up, Maya!

446
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:09,174
Right now! Right now!
Come on! Take it home!

447
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:14,888
Line up! Hike!

448
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:17,933
- Come on, Maya! Come on, Old Jack!

449
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:21,728
Come on, kids!

450
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,817
Hike! 

451
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:33,782
All right, doc, you hang in there, OK?

452
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:35,909
We're gonna get you home. All right?

453
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:38,120
Don't you worry.

454
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:41,164
- I'm gonna get you back.
- I'm sorry.

455
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:43,542
You're gonna get home
and see your family, doc.

456
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,086
You're gonna see your son, all right?

457
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,064
Come here, Maya.

458
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:09,109
Maya, you got to get us home!
Get us home!

459
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:18,076
Go get up there, Max! Maya needs you!

460
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,917
Right now! Right now! Hike! Hike!

461
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,315
I can fly in this, Andy. You know I can.

462
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,860
Sorry, Katie. It's not a question
of whether you could fly in it,

463
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,196
but whether you could see anything.

464
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:57,074
Don't worry, hon.
He's been in worse before.

465
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,284
Worse than this?

466
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,667
- What?

467
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,083
 Base to Melbourne team. Come in?

468
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,253
Base to Melbourne. Come in.

469
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,673
- This is Katie. Please, come in.

470
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:59,511
- Jerry, do you copy? Over.

471
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,432
Base out.

472
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:24,578
Good, kids.

473
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:04,535
About three here, right?

474
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,096
Andy! Coop! Come on, they're here!

475
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:34,189
Jerry! Jer, are you all right?

476
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,234
He's got a broken leg!
And he's been in the water!

477
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:39,278
- Get the stretcher now!
- Got it!

478
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,031
- I don't like that cough.
- Get the dogs.

479
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,450
Look at those hands! Get him in!

480
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:47,536
-Come on, Jerry.
- Let's go!

481
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:51,582
Good team. Good team.

482
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,127
- Good girl, Maya!

483
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,338
 You got us home. 

484
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,218
All right,
let's have a look at this leg.

485
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,221
Rosemary. Hypothermia kit.

486
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:09,433
Put your hands in there.
We'll bring 'em back nice and slow.

487
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,019
Hey. Buddy, how you feeling?

488
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,688
- How are the dogs?
- Uh, good. I just fed them.

489
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,733
- Get the rock off the sled too.
- The rock?

490
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,111
- He found what he was looking for?
- Of course. He had a good guide.

491
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:23,280
Soon as you can, get that plane ready.

492
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:27,284
Dr. McClaren could lose this leg
without proper medical attention.

493
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:31,079
- What are we gonna do about the dogs?
- There's only so much we can carry.

494
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,707
I did speak to Mactown.
The winter team is ready to go.

495
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,001
Katie can fly right back,
bring the dogs out.

496
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,837
I'll wait here and, uh,
I'll fly out with the dogs later.

497
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,508
No, that's out of the question.
That could be stage three frostbite

498
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:45,469
and heaven knows what nerve damage
has already been done.

499
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:49,264
Jerry, he's right.
I'll come right back. I promise.

500
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,683
Let's get ready to pull out of here.

501
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,104
Take them out.

502
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,357
Watch his head.
Jer. I need some help.

503
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,235
Be careful with that leg.

504
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,741
Knock down the stretcher,
Rosemary.

505
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:11,578
Coop. Coop, come help me
tighten the dogs' collars

506
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:14,248
so they don't get loose.
Come on. Max! Come on!

507
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,124
Good boy, Max.

508
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,715
Come on, buddy. Come here.

509
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,887
Come here, Max. Come here, Max.

510
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:31,640
-Come here.
-Good boy. Good boy, Max.

511
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:34,434
-All right. Here we go.
-Won't be long.

512
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:36,562
Easy, Max. Easy.

513
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,398
- Let's get the other ones.
- All right.

514
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,151
- Hang in there, big guy.

515
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,202
That's the last of 'em.

516
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:54,788
All right, Maya.

517
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:58,166
You keep 'em in line, all right,
and I'll be back. I promise.

518
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,711
Be good. That's my girl!

519
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,994
All right, buckle tight.
This one's gonna be rough.

520
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:40,542
- Coop, I know you got that fear...
- Major... major fear of flying? Yeah.

521
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,633
Ugh.

522
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,155
Hey.

523
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,074
Hey!

524
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,368
Finally.

525
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:21,578
Oh, man.

526
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:24,414
Oh, you...
you are so lucky you passed out.

527
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:25,499
We... [sighs]

528
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,543
We were bouncing around up there, man,

529
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:30,295
like one of those beach balls
at Dodger Stadium.

530
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:33,549
And Katie was yelling at me
the whole time to stop screaming,

531
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,385
but, uh, I couldn't do it.
It was way too intense, man.

532
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,303
It was crazy.

533
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,848
Where is everybody?

534
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:43,350
Right here.
Everyone's here at Mactown.

535
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,853
Davis is good. Uh, you're good.

536
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:48,689
Your hands... You still have
your hands, which is good.

537
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,275
Everything's...
everything's all good, man.

538
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,777
Did Katie get the dogs OK?

539
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:56,613
Yeah, well, um...

540
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:59,366
Uh...

541
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:03,328
Uh... No.

542
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:06,331
They were telling her
that-that she should wait, maybe,

543
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:08,667
you know, until things got better.

544
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:12,754
Jer? It's been snowing
since we got here, man.

545
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:17,467
Dude...

546
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,768
Hey. You're finally up.

547
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:30,647
- How are your hands feeling?
- They're fine.

548
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:33,942
- How soon can we go back?
- I think you should get some rest, OK?

549
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:35,068
No, Katie. How soon?

550
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,571
The weather's gotten worse.
No one's flying in.

551
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:39,239
When is it gonna get better?

552
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:44,786
They've canceled the winter teams.
No one's going in till spring.

553
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,673
I need it now!

554
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:58,342
Excuse me, commander?

555
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,802
- Who are you?
- Jerry Shepard. I'm with NSF.

556
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,763
- Andy Harrison's crew?
- Yeah.

557
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:06,141
We need a plane to the field base.
We weren't entirely evacuated.

558
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,852
What? I ordered everybody
out of there yesterday.

559
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:11,647
No, not everybody.
We left eight dogs there, sir.

560
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,940
Dogs?

561
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:16,944
I've got over 200 people, ten winter
teams to evacuate to New Zealand.

562
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:19,530
Right. These dogs
are a part of our team, NSF.

563
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:23,075
Captain, we've got a big problem
with some of the engines icing up.

564
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:27,955
- We have to start moving some planes.
- Son, look. This is today.

565
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:30,832
We've got a two-day window,
then another storm hits.

566
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,001
If it lasts till here,
which they say it will,

567
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:35,671
then we're into winter
and nobody flies.

568
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:38,674
We don't have enough supplies
to keep everybody here.

569
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:42,261
- So I'm a little busy right now.
- All we need is a plane, sir...

570
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:44,680
- Do you want us to do that, sir?
- Do what?

571
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,516
- Start moving some planes.
- Will you give me one minute?

572
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:52,855
Listen. If we could just get a plane
like the one that we flew in on,

573
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:54,815
it would only take three hours.

574
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:58,360
Son, the only thing
we've got left are C-130s

575
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:00,821
and they sure as hell
can't land at a field base.

576
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:04,783
We can't just leave 'em out there.

577
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,871
There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

578
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:14,501
- Let's start moving those planes.
- Yes, sir, right away, captain.

579
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,929
- Yeah, come in.

580
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,557
Hey.

581
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:31,560
How we doing?

582
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:34,730
When's your flight leave?
You and Rosie?

583
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,733
A couple hours ahead of you,
Coop and the doc.

584
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,196
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

585
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:45,073
I'm really sorry, Jerry.

586
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,242
I don't want to talk about it.
You want a drink?

587
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:49,745
Sure.

588
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,045
- Fresca.
- Yeah, sorry. That's all I got.

589
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:02,257
You know this wasn't your fault.
This wasn't anybody's fault.

590
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:05,177
- We just left 'em there.
- Come on. We didn't just leave them.

591
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,305
Don't do this to yourself.
The dogs are strong.

592
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:09,765
Maybe there's a chance.

593
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:13,101
We tightened their collars
so they wouldn't get loose.

594
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,106
Listen, I...

595
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,816
I know...

596
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,612
I know you want me to find
a way to get us back there somehow.

597
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:25,572
I know you're disappointed in me.

598
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,493
No.

599
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:36,959
You know, sometimes you just
have to lower your expectations.

600
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:50,347
You know what, Jerry?
I'm sorry. I really am.

601
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,351
I've got to go pack.

602
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:07,591
Fill this out. Take it down to admin.
Just follow the red line on the floor.

603
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:10,219
With any luck, you could
have some funding by August.

604
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,304
August?

605
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:15,933
No, wait. I don't think you understand.
In a few days those dogs...

606
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,351
I have to go now.

607
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:20,229
I'm sorry, Mr. Shepard.
Once winter sets in,

608
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:23,524
as you know, there's no
coming or goings down there.

609
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,984
We had to cancel
the winter teams this year.

610
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:30,531
- Couldn't get 'em in before the storm.
- There must be somebody going south.

611
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:35,661
Mr. Shepard, be reasonable. This is
the biggest Antarctic storm in 25 years.

612
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:39,081
If you don't believe me,
take a look at this weather report.

613
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:24,394
- Yeah, good, good.

614
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,189
- Where's the rocket going?
- [Woman] What a surprise!

615
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:29,066
- To Mars, Dad.
-Come on in.

616
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:30,609
Yeah?

617
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:32,361
Well, look who I found.

618
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,531
Hey. Hey, world traveler.

619
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,407
- How you been?
- I'm good, I'm good.

620
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,952
- How's your fingers?
- Oh, I get to keep 'em.

621
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:41,203
- Great.
- How's the leg?

622
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:44,248
Hard to tell. The cast is
coming along great, thanks to Eric.

623
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,542
There's a pot of coffee
in the kitchen, so...

624
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,794
Eric, let's go find
a real coloring book.

625
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:50,963
- What a great surprise.
- Give you a hand?

626
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,548
- No, I'm all right.
- You got it?

627
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:55,843
So, what brings you to LA?

628
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:59,054
I brought you something.

629
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:09,064
Thanks.

630
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:12,276
I gotta get back there. Right now.

631
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:17,322
I can't sleep at night. I've been
to NSF, agencies, foundations.

632
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:20,659
I've been to TV networks to convince
them to follow me with a camera.

633
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:24,121
Anything to raise money.
It just... It all takes too long.

634
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:27,791
Now I've only got one week to get
back down there before winter hits.

635
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:32,379
Then no one gets in for six months.
You've got those guys in your pocket.

636
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:35,007
The, uh, the science fund guys.

637
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,886
- The university endowment?
- They'd do anything for you right now.

638
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,890
- Jerry, listen to what you're saying.
- No, it would just be me,

639
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,267
just a three-day trip in.
You could tell 'em.

640
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:49,229
- Tell 'em I'm scouting your next trip.
- They'd be throwing their money away.

641
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:52,232
- No, they wouldn't.
- Even if you could get down there,

642
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,775
- by now it's 50 below.
- No.

643
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,945
Jerry, be realistic.
It's already been...

644
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:59,865
I know how long it's been.

645
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:03,035
But I need to know for sure.
I have to go.

646
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,622
It's not possible, Jerry.

647
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:10,292
It's just not possible.

648
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:15,297
And you gotta find a way
to forget about all this.

649
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,050
Forget?

650
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,678
And you can do that?

651
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:54,154
Hey, Jer. It's Kate.

652
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:56,615
It's been a week.
Just checking if you're home yet.

653
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:59,952
- Bye.

654
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:05,499
Jer, it's Kate again.
Call me back. Bye.

655
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:04,775
Over here.

656
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:08,779
All right, the ocean
has a mind of its own.

657
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:11,907
So respect the ocean. Stay alert.

658
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:16,453
Now, go on ahead and take the paddle
like this, in both hands.

659
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:21,917
There you go.
We're gonna do an even paddle,

660
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:24,920
- alternating blades.

661
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:27,923
Like that.

662
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,927
Hey, Al, will you take over for me?

663
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:39,309
Hey, what are you doing here?

664
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:42,938
Somebody told me Jerry Shepard
was working at the kiddie pool.

665
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:46,400
I said, "No way.
I have to see that for myself."

666
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,735
Is that why you're here?
You're here to mock me?

667
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:52,281
I'm the chauffeur.
Somebody else wanted to see you.

668
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:56,243
Brandy! Come here. Go see Jerry!

669
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,288
Wow.

670
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:03,166
- Look who's all grown up and beautiful.
- She's smart too. Just like you said.

671
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,753
Is she? Let's see
how well she's got you trained, then.

672
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:10,966
Go get it!

673
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:17,681
She's looking good.

674
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:20,517
But I'm still not sure
what you're doing here.

675
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:23,812
Come on. You didn't return my calls.
I got worried.

676
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:28,150
- I've been busy.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.

677
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:30,903
What about you?
What have you been up to?

678
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:34,156
Nothing much. I'm seeing somebody.

679
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:37,868
- Really.
- Yeah, I mean,

680
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:41,455
I'm not seeing him for long,
but I kind of like him.

681
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:45,792
He's such the opposite of us.
A complete head guy.

682
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,253
He's an engineer.

683
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:50,756
Like on a train?

684
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:52,925
Shut up.

685
01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:58,472
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

686
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:04,436
- Go, Brandy!

687
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:13,362
So I heard you pulled yourself
off the McKinley expedition.

688
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:17,658
Listen, I know leaving the dogs
was hard for you.

689
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:21,036
Well, it is what it is.
There's really nothing to talk about.

690
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:23,205
Nothing to talk about? Jerry, come on.

691
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:25,040
I don't want to talk about it.

692
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:27,793
You can't just keep
hiding out here, Jerry.

693
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:31,213
I mean, come on.
Renting kayaks to nine-year-olds?

694
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:35,342
Well, what am I supposed
to do then, huh?

695
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:38,804
Maybe you can help me out or something
'cause I'm not sure anymore.

696
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:43,559
You know what you're supposed to do?
Let yourself off the hook.

697
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,770
It doesn't mean that you have to forget.

698
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:42,201
He knows a dog person
when he smells one.

699
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:44,286
Hey, Mindo.

700
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:46,955
- How you doing? Easy trip?
- Yeah, it wasn't bad.

701
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,458
- Appreciate you seeing me.
- My pleasure.

702
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,418
You're part of the family.

703
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:55,005
Here. I thought you'd like to have this.

704
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:58,300
Thanks. Come on in.

705
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:13,065
So, you came to apologize, hmm?

706
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,693
I just knew...

707
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:20,155
I just knew that you raised 'em.

708
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:24,993
You don't have to apologize to me.
It's not about being sorry for anything.

709
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:28,664
What is it then?

710
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:35,921
Back when I was a young man,

711
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:40,300
my father ran a team of sled dogs
up in the Yukon.

712
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:44,972
One summer he was out in the bush
walking with six of them.

713
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:50,686
They came across a grizzly bear.
Young, but big.

714
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:54,481
The first thing he did was maul
my father within an inch of his life.

715
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:57,985
When he came to,
he saw that two of his dogs

716
01:11:58,026 --> 01:12:01,613
had been killed trying to save him.
The rest were gone.

717
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:07,286
When he regained his strength,
he went out looking for his dogs.

718
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,288
He said he had to.

719
01:12:12,165 --> 01:12:14,835
You know why I told you this story?

720
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:19,882
Because I won't find my dogs.

721
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:24,011
The story's not about the dogs.
It's about my father

722
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:26,346
honoring what the dogs
had done for him.

723
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:30,225
Jerry, what's important

724
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:34,438
is finding that one thing
that will truly put your heart at rest.

725
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:25,150
And now...

726
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:27,778
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please join with me

727
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:32,241
in welcoming and honoring
the man who five months ago

728
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:36,495
brought back from Antarctica
the first documented Mercury meteorite,

729
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:38,205
Dr. Davis McClaren.

730
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,924
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

731
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:53,595
Thank you very much. There are
several people I wish to thank,

732
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:56,098
but first and most important,
my family,

733
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:59,226
my son, Eric,
and my wife, Dr. Eve McClaren,

734
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:03,564
for her patience as I travel
around the world on these expeditions,

735
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:07,109
many of which could be better
described as wild-goose chases.

736
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:11,613
Um, I'd like to thank the university
for its continued support.

737
01:16:11,697 --> 01:16:13,949
I'd also like to take a moment

738
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:18,662
to thank the entire team
at the NSF base,

739
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:22,541
without whom this discovery

740
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:26,879
and this scientist
would not have made it home.

741
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:41,727
Thanks. Thanks.
Excuse me one second.

742
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:43,437
- Thanks.
- Yeah, thanks. Hey.

743
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,648
- There he is.
- Yeah. Scotch, rocks, please.

744
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:49,109
The man of the hour. Congratulations.

745
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:52,905
Well, I'm glad you could make it.
I wasn't sure you were gonna come down.

746
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:54,615
Yeah.

747
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:56,200
You know, about that...

748
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:58,660
Last time I saw you,

749
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:01,788
I tried to make my problems yours.
I shouldn't have done that.

750
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:05,167
But it was hard to accept
that I couldn't get back to the dogs.

751
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:08,504
So, where are you with all of that?

752
01:17:09,254 --> 01:17:11,006
Uh...

753
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:13,717
Actually, I'm heading
to New Zealand later on tonight.

754
01:17:15,219 --> 01:17:17,679
So, you found a way back down?

755
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,015
Part of the way.
I'll make it to Christchurch

756
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:24,770
and if you hang out there long enough,
usually you can find a ride south.

757
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:27,272
And if you don't?

758
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:32,945
Well, it's, uh, like you said
to me the day that storm came in.

759
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:35,405
You gotta take chances
for things you care about.

760
01:17:36,114 --> 01:17:37,866
Davis?

761
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:42,329
Yeah, yeah. Just...
I'll be right with you.

762
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:43,914
Go ahead, get back to the party.

763
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:47,209
I wanna come in
and say congratulations once again.

764
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:49,461
- Sure. Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

765
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:52,714
- Give my best to your family.
- I will. And good luck, really.

766
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,049
Thanks.

767
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,427
Enjoy the evening.

768
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:13,861
- Sitter says he's been down since 8:00.
- Oh, great.

769
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:17,239
Which means he'll be up at 5:00.

770
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:23,954
Hey, little man.

771
01:25:03,353 --> 01:25:05,522
- Hello.
- Hi.

772
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:07,900
Is your boat for hire?

773
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:10,736
- For what?
- I gotta get to McMurdo.

774
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,655
Not a chance, mate.
It's a fishing boat.

775
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:15,866
Looking for someone, you know Bailies?

776
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:18,493
- Yeah.
- It's just up there. It's a bar.

777
01:25:18,577 --> 01:25:22,831
- All right, thanks. No chance, huh?
- Not in hell.

778
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:27,044
You want me to take you
to Antarctica in the dead of winter

779
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:28,629
on a 70-foot fishing trawler?

780
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:32,382
Mm-hm. And I can pay you.
Not a lot, but everything I have.

781
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:36,303
I'm sorry, mate. Everybody is looking
for a cheap ride out to McMurdo.

782
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:38,472
Basically,
my boat's a margarita blender.

783
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:40,933
First chunk of ice we hit,
we'll break in half.

784
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:42,809
I've seen your boat. We can make it.

785
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:46,104
- I'm desperate. You're my last option.
- No one in their right mind

786
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:48,440
will take you in anything
but an icebreaker.

787
01:25:48,524 --> 01:25:52,194
Excuse me, sir.
The lady at the bar bought you a drink.

788
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,498
No way. Excuse me.

789
01:26:08,043 --> 01:26:09,378
What are you doing here?

790
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:12,506
Ah, some guy needed a cheap pilot
for an expedition

791
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:14,466
and I'm always cheap in the off season.

792
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:16,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

793
01:26:16,927 --> 01:26:19,221
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

794
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:23,725
- So, where are you going?
-Same place I'm going.

795
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:28,856
What the hell?

796
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:31,608
- What's up, Jer?
- What's going on, buddy?

797
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:33,569
- Hey, buddy. Aw!
- How you been?

798
01:26:33,652 --> 01:26:35,237
- Nice to see you.
- I missed you.

799
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,406
Same here.

800
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:40,325
What's really going on?
What kind of expedition is this?

801
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:43,412
Uh, that'd be an NSF expedition.

802
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:45,664
Yeah, I had a trip that was cut short.

803
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:49,251
It turns out I got a couple of weeks
of grant money left and, uh...

804
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:50,752
- Uh-huh.
- So here we are.

805
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:53,088
You're the man. You are the man.

806
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,340
How long you think
it'll take you to pack?

807
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:59,595
- You know me, I'm always packed.
- Well, this way.

808
01:26:59,678 --> 01:27:02,347
Yeah! Yeah.

809
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:03,682
Let's go! Let's go!

810
01:27:09,855 --> 01:27:11,273
Come on in, boys.

811
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:16,111
- Whoo!
- This is crazy. I never expected this.

812
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:18,530
Sometimes you gotta
raise your expectations.

813
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,872
- Cooper, how you doing?
- I'd rather not talk.

814
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:28,582
- OK.
- Thanks.

815
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:53,625
Polarsyssel, this is helicopter
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo

816
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:55,335
requesting to land on your vessel.

817
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:57,754
Roger,
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo.

818
01:28:57,838 --> 01:29:00,257
- You're clear to land.
- Here we go, boys.

819
01:29:51,975 --> 01:29:54,520
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
01:29:57,523 --> 01:29:59,816
I thought you might like some company.

821
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,860
Sure.

822
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:08,033
It's a
good night for stargazing.

823
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:16,375
Shooting stars
mean good luck, right?

824
01:30:18,335 --> 01:30:19,920
Jerry, you know,

825
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:23,006
this may not be easy, what we find.

826
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,300
I know that.

827
01:30:25,384 --> 01:30:28,512
But whatever we find,
the dogs deserve this trip.

828
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:35,602
I'm glad you're here, Katie.
And I owe you one.

829
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:41,233
You owe me for a lot of things.
This is not one of them.

830
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:43,318
No, I'm serious.

831
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:45,445
You always understood
why I had to do this.

832
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:50,909
Careful, Jerry.

833
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:53,161
You're starting to sound like a grownup.

834
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:57,457
What about that
conductor friend of yours?

835
01:30:57,499 --> 01:31:00,460
- He's an engineer.
- Oh, yeah.

836
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:03,088
We're not seeing each other anymore.

837
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,886
That's too bad.

838
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:24,938
Shut her down, Mr. Hansen.
Let's go take a look.

839
01:33:30,819 --> 01:33:33,030
What do you make of that?

840
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:35,282
It's not good.

841
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:47,961
The ice
is six feet about here.

842
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:55,135
 The ice is deeper than we thought.

843
01:33:55,177 --> 01:33:58,805
I guess we shouldn't be surprised,
given the winter we just had.

844
01:33:58,889 --> 01:34:02,184
Come halfway around the world
and we can't make it the last 100 miles.

845
01:34:03,477 --> 01:34:04,937
Sorry, mates.

846
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:08,774
I guess now is last call
for a great idea.

847
01:34:10,025 --> 01:34:12,694
Simonetta.

848
01:34:12,778 --> 01:34:14,696
Simonetta who?

849
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:18,033
His imaginary Italian girlfriend.
Come on, not now.

850
01:34:18,116 --> 01:34:20,911
An iceberg, all right,
broke off from an ice shelf.

851
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:24,665
It blocked the route that the Adlie
penguins take for their fishing waters.

852
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:28,043
- I'm not seeing the relevance.
- Horses, doc. Rein 'em in.

853
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:31,421
Now, I needed to map the new route
so researchers could find 'em.

854
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:36,510
While I was following them, they
led me right past the Italian base...

855
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:39,054
...where one Simonetta Pirelli

856
01:34:39,137 --> 01:34:41,807
whipped me up
a mean cup of hot chocolate.

857
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:45,936
- Come on, what are you talking about?
- Step into my office.

858
01:34:48,063 --> 01:34:51,525
Our base is too far for the helicopter
to make it there, right?

859
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:54,528
But the Italian base is,
like, half the distance.

860
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:57,406
- The young man's right about that.
- Still leaves us short.

861
01:34:57,489 --> 01:34:58,824
Right, right. Hold on. See,

862
01:34:58,907 --> 01:35:01,285
all field bases
have the same basic stuff, right?

863
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:05,080
But the Italian base is equipped
with the Lamborghini of snowcats.

864
01:35:05,163 --> 01:35:07,416
I'm telling you,
this thing is like a rocket.

865
01:35:07,457 --> 01:35:10,794
So we take one of these snowcats
to our base, do what we came to do,

866
01:35:10,878 --> 01:35:12,087
blow out of Dodge.

867
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:15,174
And this way, I get to spend
a little less time flying.

868
01:35:15,257 --> 01:35:16,884
No offense, Katie.

869
01:35:16,967 --> 01:35:19,469
Huh?

870
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,809
All right, let's go.

871
01:38:20,943 --> 01:38:23,070
Ah! Ah!

872
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:26,323
Ah, there it is!

873
01:38:40,712 --> 01:38:43,757
The keys are in number two.
The shovels are around the side.

874
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:45,634
We gotta dig this place out.

875
01:38:56,812 --> 01:38:58,522
It's hard.

876
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:23,964
Sweet.

877
01:39:57,289 --> 01:39:59,166
- All aboard!

878
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,543
Nice snowcat, Coop.

879
01:40:14,348 --> 01:40:16,099
What?

880
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:23,190
Not bad, huh, Jer?

881
01:40:23,232 --> 01:40:25,734
Well, what do you want me to say?
You're the man?

882
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:27,778
That'd be nice.

883
01:40:29,071 --> 01:40:30,489
OK, you're the man.

884
01:40:31,406 --> 01:40:34,409
You are indeed the man, Cooper!
You are the man!

885
01:40:34,743 --> 01:40:36,578
Grazie, Geraldo. Grazie.

886
01:40:37,746 --> 01:40:40,541
And as for you, Crazy Katie,

887
01:40:40,582 --> 01:40:43,710
you know all those ridiculous flights
you put me through?

888
01:40:43,752 --> 01:40:45,379
Yeah.

889
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:48,757
Payback is a dish best served cold.

890
01:40:48,799 --> 01:40:51,426
- Cooper, I think that's "revenge."

891
01:44:12,836 --> 01:44:14,463
It's Old Jack.

892
01:44:18,634 --> 01:44:21,762
We came all this way and they
didn't even make it off the chain.

893
01:45:07,015 --> 01:45:09,226
They got off.

894
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:14,231
They got loose!

895
01:46:10,829 --> 01:46:12,789
Come on, kids!

896
01:46:12,873 --> 01:46:14,374
Come on!

897
01:46:21,924 --> 01:46:23,759
Come on, Max!

898
01:46:34,686 --> 01:46:36,188
Hey!

899
01:46:36,271 --> 01:46:38,273
Hey, Buck!

900
01:46:39,691 --> 01:46:41,276
Hey, Buck.

901
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,028
Max, what you been doing?

902
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:46,448
- OK, not the face! Not the face!
- No! You look so beautiful.

903
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:49,576
OK, chill, boy! Chill, boy, not the...

904
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,204
Good boy, Max. Good boy, Max.

905
01:46:57,417 --> 01:47:00,212
- Yeah...
- Told you we'd come back.

906
01:47:00,295 --> 01:47:02,422
Look at you guys. Huh?

907
01:47:02,464 --> 01:47:05,092
Shorty, come here.

908
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:08,220
Not the... Hey, Jer!
A little help over here.

909
01:47:08,303 --> 01:47:09,930
A little help.

910
01:47:11,598 --> 01:47:14,059
Hey, Buck!
Leave him alone! Get over here!

911
01:47:15,853 --> 01:47:19,648
Whew! Thank you, Jer!

912
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:22,860
Good boy, Buck.

913
01:47:23,986 --> 01:47:27,573
Shadow, Truman, Max and Shorty.

914
01:47:27,656 --> 01:47:29,992
Man, I don't believe it.

915
01:47:30,075 --> 01:47:32,119
Good boys.

916
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:35,163
My five lucky stars.

917
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:39,835
Almost perfect.

918
01:47:53,182 --> 01:47:55,267
Let's go home, kids. Come on.

919
01:47:59,062 --> 01:48:01,190
This should be enough
to get us home.

920
01:48:01,273 --> 01:48:04,193
- Give me a hand with this.
- OK.

921
01:48:07,029 --> 01:48:09,781
- All right, Shorty, up!

922
01:48:09,865 --> 01:48:12,326
Good boy! Come on, Shadow, let's go.

923
01:48:12,409 --> 01:48:15,037
Come on, buddy.
Come on, let's go. Get in the back.

924
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,457
Come on! We're losing light here.
Party's over, come on.

925
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,334
All right, Max, come on, buddy.

926
01:48:22,294 --> 01:48:24,505
- Wanna ride up front?
- Have it your way.

927
01:48:24,546 --> 01:48:26,965
Let's go. Up front. Ride with me.

928
01:48:27,049 --> 01:48:28,675
Come on, buddy. Jump up.

929
01:48:30,385 --> 01:48:32,221
Max! Max!

930
01:48:32,304 --> 01:48:34,223
Max!

931
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:50,697
Maya.

932
01:49:17,266 --> 01:49:19,726
Aw, Maya.

933
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:21,770
Come on now.

934
01:49:23,355 --> 01:49:25,357
Come on now.

935
01:49:27,943 --> 01:49:30,279
You did good.

936
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:33,115
You did good, Max. Good boy.

937
01:49:33,198 --> 01:49:35,409
You brought her home.

938
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:39,079
I'm sorry, girl.

939
01:49:59,391 --> 01:50:01,268
Maya?

940
01:50:02,895 --> 01:50:04,605
Hey.

941
01:50:06,398 --> 01:50:08,442
There's my girl.

942
01:50:09,985 --> 01:50:11,945
You're OK.

943
01:50:16,992 --> 01:50:19,620
How's my best girl doing, huh?

944
01:50:19,703 --> 01:50:23,832
Good girl, Maya.
All right, let's get you home, OK?

945
01:50:23,916 --> 01:50:25,459
Let's get you home.

946
01:50:32,299 --> 01:50:34,510
Coop. Coop.

947
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:58,534
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

948
01:51:00,619 --> 01:51:03,539
What do you say, Coop?
Let's fire her up and get out of here.

949
01:51:03,622 --> 01:51:06,333
Yes, sir. I'll just make room
for one more.

950
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,626
All right.

951
01:51:07,709 --> 01:51:10,546
Give me a hand here, Katie.
Let's get her in.

952
01:51:15,175 --> 01:51:17,344
Come here, Maya. 

953
01:51:17,427 --> 01:51:20,305
- Got her? There you go.
- I think so.

954
01:51:20,389 --> 01:51:22,015
All right, Max. Let's go, buddy.

955
01:51:22,808 --> 01:51:25,561
Come on. Good boy.

956
01:51:35,195 --> 01:51:36,238
How's your girl?

957
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:42,578
She's good.

958
01:52:05,434 --> 01:52:08,770
All right. Here we go.
