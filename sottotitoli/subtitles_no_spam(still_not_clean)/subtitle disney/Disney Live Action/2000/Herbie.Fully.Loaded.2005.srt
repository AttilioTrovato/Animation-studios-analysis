1
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,274
...little car takes first...
and third place!

2
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,414
<i>A lot of Herbie fans</i>
<i>here today wearing Herbie's colors.</i>

3
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,654
- What the heck happened to you?
- I'm sorry, Crazy Dave.

4
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:15,287
I had a few problems getting
this critter on the truck.

5
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,956
Please. I've blown
bigger things out my nose.

6
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,499
Prettier too.

7
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,866
What was that?!

8
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,741
I wouldn't insult him
if I was you. He's sensitive.

9
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,406
- He's a car.
- Yeah, I know.

10
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,007
It's that he's proud.
That's all I'm saying.

11
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:40,383
The shed I got him out of
was just full of these old trophies.

12
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,649
I think he used to be a racecar.

13
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,987
A racecar?

14
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:49,962
Yeah. You know, I bet it took
first place at the Ugly-anapolis 500.

15
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,731
Oh! Oh! Oh, ow!
What did...?

16
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,405
It wasn't the car!
All right.

17
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,169
Just be calm.
I don't have to take this.

18
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:06,612
This is just a car...
an inanimate object.

19
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,216
Oh...

20
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,842
Are you kidding?

21
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,910
It just leaked all over my shoe!

22
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,479
Just get this thing
off my truck!

23
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:20,459
You are so in the crusher. Push!

24
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,470
Come on!

25
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,824
Come on!

26
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,861
Ahh! Whoa!

27
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,030
Whoa!

28
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,078
Oh!

29
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,075
Oh...

30
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:29,488
I'm... just gonna...

31
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,725
- I got to go!
- Hey! Hey, you...

32
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,947
All right. Listen up, car.

33
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,077
No one makes a fool
out of Crazy Dave.

34
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,485
No one.

35
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,284
Consider yourself crushed!

36
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,700
<i>Marie Peters.</i>

37
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,276
<i>Derek Parker.</i>

38
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,214
<i>Gregory Petell.</i>

39
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,953
<i>Chad Peterson.</i>

40
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:32,422
- <i>Margaret Peyton.</i>
- Yeah!

41
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,456
Congratulations.

42
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,930
I've seen some photo finishes
in my time.

43
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,491
That was cutting it close.

44
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,163
OK, Dad.

45
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,230
Getting dizzy.
Oxygen deprived.

46
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:48,832
Your mom would be so proud.

47
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,309
You're the first Peyton
to graduate college.

48
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,074
One where you don't
have to keep a toolbox at the end.

49
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,207
- Where's Ray?
- Running some laps.

50
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,446
We got a qualifying race.
He's working on some problems.

51
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,646
Like not crashing?

52
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,450
Mag-Wheels!

53
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,826
Check out what mom and dad
got me for graduation.

54
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,191
Oh, great. Rub it in.

55
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,062
4.2 V-8, right?

56
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,500
V-8, what? I don't know,
but it's adorable!

57
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,004
Promise you'll look
after Maggie in New York.

58
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:23,169
- We'll be roommates for 15 minutes.
- An assistant producer job at ESPN.

59
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,178
You'll be in front of
the camera in a heartbeat.

60
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,838
Have a great time in Paris.

61
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:30,372
Bye. Be back in a month.
I'll spring you from Riverside.

62
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,046
We'll cruise to the Big Apple
and start our new lives. <i>Au revoir!</i>

63
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:40,291
I promised your brother we'd
meet him at the track. We got to go.

64
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,658
Do I even get
a graduation lunch?

65
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,592
Well, this isn't quite
what I had in mind, but...

66
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,668
Hey, I sprung for the churros.

67
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:51,000
Dad, is Sally
still sponsoring you?

68
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,404
One of the proud, the few.

69
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,638
Hey, guys!

70
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,045
- Congrats on the ESPN job!
- Thank you.

71
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,347
I thought Maggie might swing
some free publicity over there.

72
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,013
Only publicity Team Peyton
needs is to win a race.

73
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,546
We're turning this thing around.
I know it. Believe me.

74
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:20,099
Aw, come on, Ray.
What are you doing?

75
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,566
Ray, what...?

76
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,839
Ow.

77
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,044
Ray, you were just
pushing the right front.

78
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,056
Was that what it is?
Did you learn that in college? Thanks!

79
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,922
- At least he loses with style.
- He's sure had enough practice.

80
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,128
I can't believe
Trip Murphy won Daytona.

81
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,035
He's a loser.
A well-paid loser.

82
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,039
Hey, Ray,
the guy's a great racer.

83
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:03,076
Say what you want about him.
He has excellent focus.

84
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,168
Focus.

85
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,778
You drove past that tree
on purpose.

86
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:16,084
- No. We're taking a shortcut.
- You were gonna chop it down.

87
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,750
We tried to knock it down
by crashing a car into it...

88
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,817
Oh, wait! That was you!

89
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:25,558
Oh, right. I'm not the one
who crashes into walls, am I?

90
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,930
Don't let him get to you.
The important thing

91
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,528
is when you see that tree and this town
in your rearview mirror,

92
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:35,166
you know you're on your way
to a better life. Right?

93
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,233
- Right.
- All right.

94
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,872
Now you, Gramps, had style.

95
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,198
He sure did.

96
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,569
Listen.

97
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:15,342
I'm sorry I didn't really pull out
all the stops for graduation.

98
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,680
It's OK. You know,

99
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,844
that was always
Mom's department.

100
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,822
It's been ten years.
I should have more of a clue.

101
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,559
I didn't know the team
was doing so badly.

102
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,859
Maggie, it's a bad streak.
We'll pull out of it.

103
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:37,267
But I do think it's time we find room
for you up on that wall.

104
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,202
That ought to do it justice.

105
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,549
- Night, Dad.
- Night, baby.

106
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,845
Tomorrow morning, getting you
a graduation present.

107
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,289
It's OK. I really
don't need anything.

108
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,350
I want to. First thing,
bright and early, you and me.

109
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,555
- You get to pick it out.
- OK.

110
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,655
- Good night.
- Good night.

111
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:23,340
Dad, uh,
what are we doing here?

112
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,009
Buying you a car.

113
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,316
I appreciate the gesture,
but I'm only here a month.

114
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,323
You don't want me chauffeuring you
around for a month.

115
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,255
Happy graduation, Magpie.

116
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,060
Hey, Dave!

117
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,773
Wow. A stock car.

118
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,915
One lap to go. Maggie Peyton
is about to make NASCAR history.

119
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,983
She's going! She's going!

120
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,062
She's done it! Unbelievable!

121
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,533
She's the first female driver
to take the Nextel Cup! Wow!

122
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,501
Hey, Maggie!
You find anything yet?

123
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,474
- Not yet, Dad! Still looking!
- OK, honey.

124
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,510
- What do you think, hon?
- Nothing calls out to me.

125
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,714
Now, trust me.

126
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,621
There's a certified
pre-owned champion out there

127
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,250
waiting to be discovered.

128
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:51,229
A car with the guts, the character,
the heart of a thoroughbred.

129
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,935
Dad! It's perfect!

130
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,707
OK, just think,
if this horn hadn't gone off,

131
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,578
I wouldn't have found
this Nissan!

132
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,447
Hey, Maggie.
What about this guy?

133
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,753
These are great. Take care
of the engine, they run forever.

134
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,885
- Doesn't really need anything.
- It's cute.

135
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:22,962
But, Dad...

136
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,130
How much for the Nissan?

137
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,761
Good eye. Good eye.

138
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,863
We've had a lot of interest
in that car this week. But, um...

139
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,305
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

140
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,107
Since you are
the first customer today,

141
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,273
I think I can
cut you a deal.

142
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,313
Hmm.

143
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,117
I'll give you 50 for the Bug.

144
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,557
Sorry, no can do. See...

145
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:58,257
I always felt there was something
special about that car.

146
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,128
I wouldn't sell
in a million years.

147
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,067
- Seventy-five.
- Oh, sold!

148
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,195
I'll make out the papers.

149
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,941
At least we know
the horn works.

150
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,571
OK, Mags.
Tires are good.

151
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,511
Gas is good.
Brakes are good.

152
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:52,074
Look at that. The speedometer
goes up to 200 miles an hour.

153
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,985
Somebody's got
a sense of humor.

154
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,081
All right, now. Come over
to the garage later.

155
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,149
Have Augie
take a look at it.

156
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,990
Thank you, Dad.

157
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,274
"Please take care of Herbie.

158
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,616
Whatever your problem,
he'll help you find the answer."

159
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,720
Great.
A fortune cookie on wheels.

160
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,984
OK, let's start slow.

161
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,103
What are you doing?! Stop!

162
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,441
This isn't funny anymore!

163
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:58,216
Come on, car!
You're a car! I drive!

164
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,913
What is going on?

165
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,783
Oh, my God! No!

166
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,662
- Oh, God...
- Oh, my God.

167
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,296
I'm so sorry.
Let me help you.

168
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,940
Are you OK?

169
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,448
- Maggie?
- Kevin?

170
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,615
God, you look great.

171
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,650
I mean, it's great to see you.

172
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,127
What are you... I haven't
seen you since high school.

173
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,927
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I just got this car.

174
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,798
My dad wanted to get me
something for graduation.

175
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,643
Didn't you used to drive cars
with a little bit more, uh... muscle?

176
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,805
This car is not for racing.
It's for regular driving.

177
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,280
- For show.
- Yeah.

178
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,508
Oh, man.

179
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,647
You know what? It's not worth it.
I'm gonna take it back to Crazy Dave.

180
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:14,160
- Good to see you, Kevin.
- Yeah, good to see you.

181
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,125
Hey, Mags.
I could fix it for you.

182
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,665
Oh, no, that's OK.

183
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,828
No. That's what I do.
Kevin's Custom Car Shop.

184
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,462
- Nothing too fancy.
- No. Just the basics.

185
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,804
We'll take him for a test drive,
see what we got to work with.

186
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:33,039
- Sorry for almost running you over.
- Don't do that again.

187
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:39,685
Whoa! Whoa!

188
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,415
OK. All right. Easy, Mags.

189
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,692
- Smooth ride.
- Sorry.

190
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,558
Do you know where we
could get some new shocks?

191
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:53,224
Uh... There's a car show
at the Fairplex.

192
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,097
We could borrow parts
from the Hernandez brothers.

193
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,498
Yeah, I'm not really up
for that whole scene.

194
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,665
What? You used to
tear it up there.

195
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,368
Well, I mean, that was then.

196
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,775
Besides, this bucket of bolts
couldn't make it down there.

197
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,713
Whoa!

198
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,514
That's the Maggie I know!

199
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,956
What are you talking about?
I'm not doing this!

200
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,220
What'd you say?

201
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,027
OK, Mags!

202
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,069
Oh, my God.

203
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,708
It has more horsepower
than I expected.

204
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,213
Are you kidding me?
He just took off.

205
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,580
- He?
- Herbie!

206
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,585
OK, the car's name
is Herbie?

207
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,587
It wasn't my first choice.
Name came with the car.

208
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,954
Let's strip it down,
get rid of old parts.

209
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,892
- Maybe there's something to salvage.
- Works for me.

210
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:58,123
Go easy, Mags... Herbie.

211
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,430
What are you doing?

212
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,435
- Steering wheel's jammed.
- Left.

213
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,801
I can't turn it!
It's jammed!

214
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,602
OK!

215
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,575
OK! Easy!

216
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,578
Great. I'm being
carjacked by my own car!

217
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,730
OK. Watch the people.
Easy, easy.

218
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,459
Oh! That's the e-brake.

219
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,034
That should be
connected to something.

220
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,502
Oh, good.
They have valet parking.

221
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,562
Oh, man!

222
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,735
Sorry.

223
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,279
What are you doing?
You didn't want to come.

224
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,212
I didn't! It was Herbie!

225
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,909
That's funny, Mags.

226
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,246
"It was Herbie."

227
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,885
- Hey. Where are you going?
- What?

228
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,358
- I'm so sorry.
- Her bad.

229
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,429
<i>Step away</i>
<i>from the vehicle.</i>

230
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,554
Maggie!

231
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,757
- What's up?
- What's up? How are you?

232
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,569
Pablo, Pancho.
Hey, what's up, guys?

233
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,868
- Hey!
- Hello!

234
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,875
- You look good!
- Yeah, what happened?

235
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,240
Thanks, guys.
Great to see you too.

236
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,870
Hey, is that your car?

237
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,177
No. No.

238
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,843
No, no. I don't know
whose that is.

239
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,046
Good thing,
'cause that thing is ugly!

240
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,295
Hey, Trip!

241
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

242
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,938
<i>Nextel Cup Series champion,</i>
<i>Trip Murphy!</i>

243
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:58,550
I hope you don't mind
I crashed your party.

244
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,351
When I'm in the
middle of a race,

245
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:07,552
swapping paint with
Dale Earnhardt, Jr. And Jeff Gordon,

246
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,184
you know what keeps me going?

247
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,557
It's you guys.

248
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,154
My fans.

249
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:18,233
And now, I'm going to give you
that same experience

250
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,534
in your very own living rooms.

251
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,165
Crash? What have you got for me?

252
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:26,508
Oh, wow. You guys
are in for a real treat.

253
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,173
It's my new video game.

254
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,277
"Trip Murphy: Undefeated."

255
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,121
All right.

256
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,719
You got a <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
shoot in an hour.

257
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,994
No sweat. I'll do two laps.
Keep the Sharpies handy.

258
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:51,002
And when women give you
their numbers, get photos.

259
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,129
I don't want
a replay of Phoenix.

260
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,639
- I do enough charity work already.
- OK.

261
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,369
Can I get your autograph?

262
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,813
Trip! Sign my head.

263
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,111
Yeah. Yeah!

264
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:05,378
Whoo-hoo!

265
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,249
Yes! Trip Murphy signed my head!

266
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,449
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

267
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,155
I'm not gonna be
embarrassed again.

268
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:18,764
What about the car?

269
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,629
Crazy Dave can keep his cash.
I'll stick with my board.

270
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,862
You can't just leave it here.

271
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:26,565
Hello? Look around.
Somebody will take it.

272
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:49,723
What is with this car?
Like it's trying to embarrass me...

273
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,308
Look at this.

274
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:08,176
Some guy named Maxx
left these in the trunk...

275
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:09,715
You look great.

276
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:14,344
You got a tiny little spot
on your shirt. What happened?

277
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,049
- You're gonna change into those?
- Stand guard. No peeking.

278
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,355
Don't flatter yourself.
"No peeking."

279
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:39,768
Oh. Hey.

280
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,974
- Oh, good. It fits. All zipped up.
- Let's go.

281
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,711
- Wait. Where are the keys?
- Uh, they're in the...

282
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,513
Oh!

283
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:54,518
Oh, whoa. Take it easy, guy.
All you gotta do is ask.

284
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,524
I'd wear a helmet too
if my ride looked like that.

285
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:04,728
Oops.

286
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:09,238
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Good idea, loser.

287
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:13,245
Get this car back to the circus
before Bozo puts out an APB.

288
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,244
Ha-ha. Good stuff.

289
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,996
Oh, my God!

290
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:34,829
OK. OK, OK!

291
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,233
What are you...?
Take it easy.

292
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:41,371
Oh...

293
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,271
Oh!

294
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,914
Ohhh! Oh, dude!

295
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:57,015
- What did you do?
- I swear to God, I did not do that!

296
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,058
OK, try telling that to him.

297
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:04,063
Race! Race! Race! Race!

298
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,790
Trip! You gonna take that?

299
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,388
Race, race, race!

300
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,333
I can't race. Get out there
and tell them I'm sorry!

301
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,428
I love that I have
to do this. Sure.

302
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:15,497
'Cause Trip and I
have such a good rapport.

303
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,770
Race! Race! Race!

304
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:21,541
What have I got to lose?
It's a Bug.

305
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,546
Open.

306
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,249
Oh, my God! Kevin!
Kevin! Help me!

307
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,884
Kevin! Kevin!

308
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,361
Mags! What are you doing?

309
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,922
Kevin!

310
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:54,136
What is going on?
I don't want to race!

311
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,979
Kevin! Kevin!

312
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,122
Race, race, race, race!

313
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:18,063
What are you trying to do,
you crazy little car?

314
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,262
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

315
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:28,505
OK. So that's
how you want to do it?

316
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:11,133
I thought you said
you hadn't been racing.

317
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,509
- That was unbelievable!
- I know. Unbelievable.

318
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,979
Hey, Trip.
What do you say?

319
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,081
Get that camera out of my face!

320
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,281
Did you see me
come off that guardrail?

321
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,551
I saw... I don't know
how you did that.

322
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:29,059
All right. This is gonna
sound strange, but it wasn't me.

323
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,719
I think it was Herbie.

324
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,298
Herbie is a car.

325
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,596
You always said
they had personalities.

326
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,569
Yeah, personalities.
They're not possessed.

327
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:43,007
I can't explain it, but when Trip
blocked me on that final turn,

328
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,238
I wished I was on my skateboard
so I could rail-slide past.

329
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,304
Then Herbie did it.
It was like we were connected.

330
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:52,647
That makes perfect sense.
Cuckoo!

331
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,310
What are you doing?

332
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:58,380
Checking to make sure exhaust fumes
haven't gone back inside the car.

333
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:02,393
Kevin, I beat the reigning
NASCAR champion in a '63 Bug!

334
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:04,793
- How else do you explain that?
- How about,

335
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:07,127
you're an amazing racer
and proved it?

336
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,292
Why are you
afraid to admit that?

337
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:15,068
You beat Trip Murphy, on your own,
with this... hunk of junk.

338
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,163
Ow!

339
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,973
Hey. Admit it.

340
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,346
It felt great to be
behind the wheel again.

341
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,349
Yeah. It did.

342
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,081
That's what I thought.

343
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,199
The family's been
in racing for 40 years.

344
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,634
I won't let guys in suits
tell me what to do.

345
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:48,037
- These guys pay our bills.
- What do they know about racing?

346
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,098
They know not to back
a losing team!

347
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:57,844
- Another sponsor bite the dust?
- They come, they go.

348
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,215
That's business.
You got in late last night.

349
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:03,084
Let me direct you to the date
of birth on my license.

350
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,783
Let me direct you to the
address on that license.

351
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:06,984
My house, my rules.

352
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:28,547
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Sally.

353
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,412
Hey, Sal. Don't tell me
you're pulling out too.

354
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:34,510
No. I'm making your day.

355
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,248
You're gonna love this.

356
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,619
<i>Taking the sports world</i>
<i>by storm.</i>

357
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:42,855
<i>Here it is again.</i>
<i>Our exclusive footage of Trip Murphy</i>

358
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:46,762
<i>just getting scorched</i>
<i>in an impromptu street race.</i>

359
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,356
<i>And get this:</i>

360
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:52,597
<i>The competition was</i>
<i>a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle.</i>

361
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:56,129
<i>That's right, folks.</i>
<i>A '63 Bug.</i>

362
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,081
I'll be back. Dad!

363
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,174
What did I do?

364
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,095
I sense you're looking
for an explanation.

365
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,566
You promised,
no more street racing.

366
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:25,468
Listen to me.
I almost lost you once.

367
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:29,872
- I'm not gonna let that happen again.
- At least let me explain first.

368
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,773
OK, go ahead.
I'm all ears.

369
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,243
I ran into Kevin.

370
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:36,076
Kevin? You aren't
in town 24 hours,

371
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:39,675
and goofy Kevin talks you
into street racing again.

372
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:42,380
Maggie. Do you think
I busted my butt

373
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,149
to put you through school

374
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,885
so you could get back behind
the wheel of a racecar?

375
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:53,863
- Dad, I wasn't even driving.
- Who was?

376
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:57,994
It was Kevin's friend, Maxx,
who was driving.

377
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,436
They wanted to challenge Trip,

378
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:04,636
so I let them borrow the car,
and it was a one-shot deal.

379
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:10,176
Promise?

380
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,651
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

381
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,288
Sorry.

382
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,293
I'm sorry too.

383
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:34,631
Whoever this Maxx guy is,
must be pretty good

384
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:37,505
if he beat Trip Murphy
in a little thing like that.

385
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,134
Not bad.

386
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:11,274
Life's a Trip.
Then you drive.

387
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,334
- Cut.
- I nailed that one.

388
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,471
I agree. I'd love
to try one more.

389
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,914
- It doesn't get much better than that.
- OK. Moving on!

390
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,918
- Can I talk to you?
- What is it?

391
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,612
The sponsors are all over me,

392
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:24,747
and the ESPN special
is down the drain

393
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,348
because you banished
the film crew.

394
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:31,829
- I won't talk about yesterday.
- I'm not. I'm talking about tomorrow.

395
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,388
This is your future.
Those people paid for it,

396
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,992
- so get your head in the game...
- I can't deal with this, Larry!

397
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:46,001
Good hustle, everybody.
Good hustle.

398
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:05,992
It doesn't make any sense.
How could that thing beat me?

399
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:08,532
Nobody cares about
a stupid street race.

400
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,899
I care. I'm a Nextel Cup
Series champion

401
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:14,439
who got beat
by a Volkswagen Bug.

402
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,203
Yes. You're a champion
on the track, where it counts.

403
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:21,644
This is nothing! The reporters
get some laughs out of it.

404
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:24,683
By Thursday, everybody
will forget it happened.

405
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,015
I've been up all night
going over this race.

406
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:30,555
I outclassed him on every front.

407
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:39,728
- I want a rematch.
- Aw, jeez. Trip, no.

408
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,732
It's me, your brother.
Forget it.

409
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,894
A two-day racing event
where I beat all comers

410
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,632
and then destroy
that little Bug.

411
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,733
I want posters at every garage,
body shop and auto parts store,

412
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,278
and full-page ads
in the local rags.

413
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,746
How do you know
this Maxx guy would show up?

414
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,943
Maxx is a racer. He'll show.

415
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,451
I'm gonna exterminate this Bug.

416
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:23,273
Hey.

417
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:27,810
Where you been? Look at this.
I want to show you something. Huh?

418
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,079
2180 engine.
Dual Weber carburetors.

419
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,846
Front, rear swing axles.
Pretty sweet, huh?

420
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,285
Yeah, they're, um... Wow.

421
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:39,017
You really put
a lot of thought into this.

422
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,686
There's potential in this car.
We can turn him into a champion.

423
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:47,232
It'll take work, but, uh, there's
a race in Lancaster in a few weeks.

424
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,790
Whoa. Hold on a second.
The other day was great.

425
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:53,895
I don't know how it happened,
but it was a fluke.

426
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,236
You loved being
back behind the wheel.

427
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,708
Yeah, I did, but now
I'm moving to New York

428
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,904
and I'm starting a new life and...

429
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,844
How are you gonna
move to New York,

430
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:05,110
a city where you take
a subway to work?

431
00:38:05,184 --> 00:38:07,311
Listen, I told my dad
no more racing,

432
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,013
and I ended up lying to him.

433
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:12,114
The last time that happened,
I ended up in the hospital.

434
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:15,957
Note the vicious Afterschool Special
cycle I'm trying to break here.

435
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:19,690
- I need cash for my apartment.
- Those are the classifieds.

436
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,789
Listen, Kev, I'm really sorry.

437
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,368
I know, I know.

438
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,399
What about Herbie?

439
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:34,913
I guess I'll drop off the keys
and the number to an exorcist.

440
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,048
What?

441
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:44,487
Maggie, what happened?
Are you all right?

442
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:55,597
I know what you're thinking.

443
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,635
It's one race, Mags.

444
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,432
One race, ten grand.
That's a lot of cash.

445
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,235
OK. We'll split it.

446
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:06,572
You got rent money to pay.
I got this dump to fix up.

447
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:09,079
Everybody wins.
What do you say?

448
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,210
Maxx?

449
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,934
Come on, Herbie.

450
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:46,778
Hey!

451
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,083
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

452
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,455
Yeah!

453
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,947
I have been over every inch
of this model ten times.

454
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,346
I've run all the tests.

455
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:30,320
There's no way an ordinary VW engine
like this could have smoked yours.

456
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,523
There's nothing ordinary
about this Bug.

457
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,263
I don't know what
it's got under its hood,

458
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,998
but I intend to find out.

459
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:02,209
Those guys
always use you

460
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,050
to get me to do something.

461
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:10,186
You can't let them drop us.
It'll break Ray's heart.

462
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:12,822
No. It's gonna
break your heart.

463
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,798
When are you gonna
open your eyes?

464
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,357
Ray Junior
is not cut out for racing.

465
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:20,633
I have held out
as long as I can.

466
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:24,267
Bass Pro is dropping you.
I'm sorry.

467
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,676
Wait a minute, Sally.
Wait, please.

468
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:36,443
Tell them to hold on
until the Speedway races.

469
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:40,719
If Ray doesn't place,
I'm out. I close up shop.

470
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,420
I'll sell motor oil.
I'll do something.

471
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:54,169
How long you been standing here?

472
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:56,731
Long enough.

473
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:01,737
I sure am glad
you're not part of this.

474
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,642
At least I did
something right.

475
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:44,488
Why do I feel like we just got
sentenced to five to ten?

476
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:46,547
I'm gonna go sign us in.

477
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,093
Maggie Peyton.

478
00:43:57,169 --> 00:43:59,694
Haven't seen you in a long time.
Who you here for?

479
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:03,036
- "In-the-way Ray"?
- Actually, I'm sponsoring Maxx.

480
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,906
So, do you like the makeover?

481
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,152
You can take the car
out of the junkyard, Maggie,

482
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:24,161
but you can't take
the junkyard out of the car.

483
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:27,562
- How do you know this Maxx?
- Um, we go way back.

484
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:31,625
I'd like to meet him.
Can you arrange a face-to-face?

485
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,796
He's meditating.
Getting in the zone.

486
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,237
Sure. Pressure's getting to him?

487
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:39,835
- He's not worried. He beat you once.
- Beginner's luck.

488
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:43,403
You tell that to yourself at night
in your Trip Murphy pajamas?

489
00:44:43,482 --> 00:44:44,847
Look,

490
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:49,353
you tell Maxx I'm really
looking forward to the rematch.

491
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:52,652
Oh, hey.
Sorry, big fella.

492
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:55,784
I'm so sick of all
this Trip Murphy cra...

493
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,260
Geez.

494
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,591
Hey. See you later, Trip.

495
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:03,566
I don't know
if I can do this.

496
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,965
Time to suit up, Maxx.

497
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:13,644
<i>Race fans,</i>
<i>please welcome our own Trip Murphy.</i>

498
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,751
We've got 200 names up there.

499
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,880
By the end of the day,
there will be only one.

500
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,359
- Yeah!
- And that driver will face me,

501
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:32,089
and have a chance
to win $10,000.

502
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:34,696
Let's race.

503
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:37,458
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

504
00:45:37,536 --> 00:45:40,801
<i>today's winner goes up</i>
<i>against Trip Murphy tomorrow!</i>

505
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:56,381
Herbie!

506
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:05,453
Vroom, vroom!
Let me hear you say "Hey, yo!"

507
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,998
What a day.
The real wild card here

508
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:10,728
is the enigmatic racer
known only as Maxx.

509
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,599
Questions abound.
Who is Maxx?

510
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:15,299
Where did he come from?
What's with the helmet?

511
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:46,601
Gotcha, Maxx.

512
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:02,413
I've signed so many autographs,
my hand is numb.

513
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,681
Guess who wants an interview.

514
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,394
How'd you get over here?

515
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,595
What's wrong?

516
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:31,101
Wow. Maggie, you...
look amazing.

517
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:34,509
I mean, you know, for someone
who changed in a Port-A-Potty.

518
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,707
Come on. I know there's
a compliment in there somewhere.

519
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:39,875
I think I'm losing my mind.

520
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,781
That was my first reaction.

521
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:45,549
And then I embraced
the mystery that is Herbie.

522
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:47,022
She's too young for you.

523
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,321
I got to tell you...

524
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,332
...winning definitely suits you.

525
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,326
Oh, I got you something.

526
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,000
It's stupid.

527
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:07,841
It's for luck tomorrow.

528
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,903
It's amazing.

529
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:19,556
Evening.

530
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,821
I hardly recognized you
without your camera crew.

531
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:25,590
I decided to give them
the night off.

532
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,122
Can we talk?

533
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,290
Alone?

534
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:35,564
- You OK?
- Yeah.

535
00:49:37,876 --> 00:49:40,606
Your driver did pretty well,
for an amateur.

536
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:45,581
But he's got some serious flaws.
Take his car, for instance.

537
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,743
The chassis's too high, and...

538
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:50,548
...the aerodynamics
are all wrong.

539
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,988
Thanks for the tip.
I'll pass it on to Maxx.

540
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:56,549
You know what I
can't figure out?

541
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,993
Why you're not
behind the wheel.

542
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:02,123
I hear you were a heck of
a street racer back in the day.

543
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,725
- Ancient history.
- I doubt it.

544
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:06,100
It's in your blood.

545
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,969
Your grandfather was one
of the greatest drivers

546
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,530
to ever hit the track.

547
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,235
He's why I got into racing.

548
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:17,680
And I gotta believe it's
hard-wired into your DNA.

549
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:21,513
Your dad ought to get Ray out of 56
and put you behind the wheel.

550
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:25,020
How many women drivers
have won a NASCAR championship?

551
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:28,889
Well... It only takes
one person to blaze a trail.

552
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:33,393
Ever think that you might be
the next great Peyton?

553
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,627
Thanks for the props,
but I gotta go.

554
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,866
You want to see how it feels
behind the wheel of a real car?

555
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,078
Are you serious?

556
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,877
I doubt your old man is
gonna make you the same offer.

557
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:54,243
Go on.

558
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,377
It'll be our little secret.

559
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,865
OK, Bug.

560
00:52:20,939 --> 00:52:23,464
Let's see what makes you tick.

561
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,447
There's no way you could
beat me with this engine.

562
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,116
Ooh!

563
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,373
You want a piece of me?!

564
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:11,585
Who's laughing now?

565
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,641
Huh?

566
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:51,395
- That was unbelievable!
- She's a pretty sweet ride.

567
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,487
I've never driven
anything like it.

568
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,328
That was my most awesome
driving experience.

569
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:59,199
Amazing what
a real car can do, isn't it?

570
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:02,637
I got a little proposition.
Why don't we raise the stakes.

571
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,265
My car for your car.

572
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:07,869
Let's make tomorrow's race
for pinks too. Huh?

573
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:11,005
I don't know. I mean,
Herbie's really special.

574
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:14,813
Come on. Nobody's gonna
take you seriously in that thing.

575
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,344
Now, if, uh,

576
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:21,357
you drive home
in Trip Murphy's stock car,

577
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:25,089
your dad would be an idiot
not to put you on the team.

578
00:54:25,163 --> 00:54:27,893
What do you say? For pinks?

579
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:33,496
All right.

580
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:43,939
You just better hope your boy Maxx
is on top of his game tomorrow.

581
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:56,585
Ray, if you drank all the
orange juice, I'll kill you.

582
00:54:56,661 --> 00:55:00,188
- Mag-Wheels!
- Charisma!

583
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:03,427
- Why aren't you in France?
- Ugh! Paris was a drag.

584
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,992
I couldn't understand anybody.
And hello!

585
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,470
Learn to pick up
after our poodles.

586
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,531
I thought I'd come back to start
our road trip early.

587
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:15,045
Slight problem. I promised
I'd meet a friend in the desert.

588
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:18,014
Why? Are you burying a body?

589
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,381
No, he's in a racing tournament.

590
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:25,115
You think you're clever,
but I see through you.

591
00:55:25,223 --> 00:55:26,247
You can?

592
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,484
It's obvious.
You're dating him.

593
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:31,151
OK, if you say so.

594
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:34,164
Don't be coy. What's his name?
Is it serious?

595
00:55:34,232 --> 00:55:38,828
Maxx. You know, we're so close,
it's like we're the same person.

596
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,497
What are you doing?
Where have you been?

597
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:45,303
In a nightmare where my dad,
brother and best friend showed up.

598
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:48,401
Well, you got a new problem.
Herbie's freaking out.

599
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,970
I don't know what to do.
Stop it!

600
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,145
Did you leave him alone
with Trip?

601
00:55:56,254 --> 00:55:58,620
Hey, Maggie!

602
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:02,757
- Who's that?
- Keep her away from my dad.

603
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:04,727
And she thinks
I'm dating Maxx.

604
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:07,423
Just don't ask me to explain.

605
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:09,898
Five-minute warning.
Get suited up.

606
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:12,765
And have a heart-to-heart
with your car. OK?

607
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:14,099
Yeah. Sure.

608
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:17,505
- Where you been?
- Excuse me.

609
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,941
I'm Kevin!
You must be Charisma, yes?

610
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:22,241
- Good to meet you.
- I just came back.

611
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:26,272
- I had the worst time...
- Herbie. What's going on?

612
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,581
I don't have time for this now.
We need to beat Trip.

613
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,647
Just get a grip. You're a car.

614
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:36,022
You do what I tell you to do,
all right?

615
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,499
Boo!

616
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:49,733
<i>It's winner take all at the</i>

617
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,775
<i>Trip Murphy</i>
<i>Sudden Death Showdown.</i>

618
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:54,470
<i>Maxx decimated</i>
<i>his challengers yesterday,</i>

619
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:57,537
<i>but now he's up against</i>
<i>superstar Trip Murphy!</i>

620
00:56:57,615 --> 00:57:03,281
<i>And now here comes Maxx</i>
<i>and Herbie to the starting line.</i>

621
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,001
Blow his wheels off, Maggie!

622
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,469
I mean, Maxxie!

623
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:53,899
Come on, Herbie!
He's pulling ahead!

624
00:57:57,842 --> 00:57:59,139
That's it, Herbie.

625
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,226
Come on!
I want that stock car!

626
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:29,430
What?

627
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:30,633
Oh!

628
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,784
Stupid car!
You blew this on purpose!

629
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,622
You were supposed to help me!

630
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:54,324
The voice is more high-pitched
than I might have imagined.

631
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,231
Come on, Maxx.

632
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:00,498
Take off the helmet and show
everybody who you really are.

633
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:15,082
- It's a chick!
- That ain't a chick! That's Maggie!

634
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,151
I guess I was wrong about you.

635
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,657
You're not the next
great Peyton after all.

636
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:25,218
You're just another amateur
who choked in the clutch.

637
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:38,432
Mags! Maggie.
Hey. Hey, come on.

638
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:39,567
Come on. Stop this.

639
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:41,474
You had a bad day.
That's it. OK?

640
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:46,209
Come on. Let's get out of here,
take Herbie back to the garage.

641
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,911
- There's always another race.
- There's not. Kevin, it's over.

642
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,648
I should have never done
this in the first place.

643
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:53,849
That's...

644
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:05,900
- Hey. Whoa. Get away from him!
- Hold it, buddy! Take it easy.

645
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,700
- OK. All right! Easy!
- Wait a minute.

646
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:11,503
- Maggie didn't tell you?
- What?

647
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:13,839
We were racing for pinks.

648
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:17,642
It was a little deal we made
after I let her race my car.

649
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:22,877
She said it was
the best ride of her life.

650
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:31,495
Please tell me
you didn't do that.

651
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:36,862
Look, Kevin, I'm sorry.
OK? I'm sorry.

652
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:39,425
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to Herbie.

653
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,437
He's the one
you stabbed in the back.

654
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:57,012
- How could you lie to me?
- I can explain.

655
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:58,850
Your word
used to mean something.

656
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:01,221
I thought I taught you honesty.

657
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:03,089
Guess I was wrong.

658
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,786
- Dad, wait!
- I'm through listening, Maggie.

659
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:17,804
- Don't hurt him!
- It's a car!

660
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:23,613
Payback time, Bug.

661
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:49,567
I can't believe you were pulling
a Racer X on everybody.

662
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,370
I thought this was
a conversation-free ride.

663
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:54,070
We've been friends for years.

664
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:56,476
I've never known
the real you until today.

665
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,706
A lying backstabber

666
01:01:57,781 --> 01:02:00,249
who alienated
everyone she cares about.

667
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:03,081
You don't get it.
You were awesome out there.

668
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:04,415
Why go to New York?

669
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:06,956
You belong behind
the wheel of a racecar.

670
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:10,323
- Grab the wheel!
- What are you doing?

671
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,486
Sorry.

672
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,395
Look, I'm really excited
about this new career.

673
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:16,865
Are you going to be happy
to report the story

674
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:18,902
rather than being one yourself?

675
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:27,502
Trip, we need to talk.

676
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:33,007
Amateur hour's over.
I've got a real race to prepare for.

677
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,744
I want to buy Herbie back.

678
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:37,548
- Herbie?
- The Volkswagen.

679
01:02:37,655 --> 01:02:40,215
Oh, yeah, the Bug.

680
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:43,851
I'm sorry. I'd like to help you,
but you're a little late.

681
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:46,795
Crash just took him out
for a little spin.

682
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,764
Trip, what did you do
with him?!

683
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:52,393
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

684
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:55,700
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

685
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,799
Ten cars enter!
One car leaves!

686
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:01,709
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

687
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:04,680
Ten cars enter!
One car...

688
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:16,192
Yeah!

689
01:03:29,707 --> 01:03:32,232
Ten cars enter!
One car leaves!

690
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,972
<i>Drivers! Are you ready?</i>

691
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:37,411
<i>Get set!</i>

692
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,745
<i>Let's go!</i>

693
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,798
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

694
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,628
- Drivers only.
- No, wait.

695
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,897
You don't understand.
That's my car out there.

696
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:03,201
Well, now, you parked it
in the wrong place.

697
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:09,438
My name's Jimmy D.

698
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,378
This here's my place,

699
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,814
and that there car
belongs to me.

700
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,441
How much to buy him back?

701
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:18,578
If he comes out
of this thing in one piece,

702
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:21,351
I'll just give him back
to you free. How's that?

703
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:55,184
Whoo! Monster trucks rock!

704
01:04:57,027 --> 01:05:01,191
I'm gonna wipe that Bug
off my windshield!

705
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,271
Don't just sit there!

706
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,546
Do you work out?

707
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:19,309
Yeah, actually.
My gym's six miles from here.

708
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:20,543
Go, Maggie!

709
01:05:33,697 --> 01:05:36,097
- What are you doing?
- Sorry!

710
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:43,902
Come on, Herbie.
I can't lose you. We're a team!

711
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,479
I need you, Herbie! Come on!

712
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,981
Oh, come on, Herbie.
Don't do this. Please!

713
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,924
That's it. Come on, Herbie.

714
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:10,523
You can do it!

715
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,250
I didn't do that.
It was the car.

716
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:32,755
- His name is Herbie.
- That's a ridiculous na...

717
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:39,554
OK, Herbie.
Let's get out of here.

718
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:18,763
Yeah!

719
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,365
Oh, come on!

720
01:07:31,682 --> 01:07:33,343
Jerk!

721
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:44,794
Go, Herbie, go! Come on!

722
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:46,193
Yeah!

723
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:49,664
There we go!

724
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:58,274
All right! Hang on, Herbie!

725
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:12,821
Pile driver!

726
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:34,105
Thanks, buddy.

727
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,200
What...? What...?

728
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:04,001
Ahh!

729
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:09,267
Oh...

730
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:11,974
Look, I don't care if you
ever speak to me again,

731
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:13,846
but you have to help Herbie.

732
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,908
What happened?

733
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:19,046
I was a jerk. I know.

734
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:22,015
Me too.

735
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:25,720
- You weren't a jerk.
- No, I meant...

736
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,059
I also know you were a jerk.

737
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:36,535
What are you gonna do about ESPN
and New York and the big time?

738
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,131
I met someone
who made me shift gears.

739
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,302
You know,
get a new perspective.

740
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,402
We're down to the final few spots
to see who gets into the big race.

741
01:09:49,437 --> 01:09:51,287
We're down to the final few spots
to see who gets into the big race.

742
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:53,856
One lap to go for
Ray Peyton, Jr. In the 56 car.

743
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,219
It's gonna be close.

744
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:59,353
Let's see if Ray Peyton, Jr. Can qualify
for Sunday's Nextel Cup race.

745
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:01,090
Come on, Ray!

746
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:10,905
Whoo! Yeah!

747
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:18,608
Oh, my God.

748
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:35,092
Peyton. To the right.

749
01:10:35,165 --> 01:10:38,032
- He needs to be transferred.
- Ray, you OK?

750
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:40,092
I'm fine. I keep
telling everybody.

751
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:44,072
Can we please get out of here?
I'm fine! Jeez!

752
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:48,675
I guess that means
he's not totally fine.

753
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,212
No.

754
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,805
- Come here, Ray. Come on.
- Ow!

755
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,850
Doc, I'm fine.

756
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:58,148
- Look straight ahead.
- I see it. It's...

757
01:10:58,255 --> 01:10:59,654
Now it's bright.

758
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:01,987
There's a problem
with his left eye.

759
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:04,391
His depth perception is off.

760
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:07,897
We won't know the extent
of the problem until we run tests.

761
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:10,330
Bottom line,
he can't race Sunday.

762
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,167
Dad, I'm sorry.

763
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:22,610
Hey. It's not your fault.

764
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,546
You ran great today.
I'm gonna go see the doctor.

765
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,775
Wait a minute, Dad.

766
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:28,180
I still qualified.

767
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,879
All we need is another driver
and we got a shot.

768
01:11:35,025 --> 01:11:36,424
Let Maggie race.

769
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:42,297
Yeah, Ray.
It's a good idea.

770
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:45,357
I mean, Team Peyton
needs this race.

771
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,733
She's ready, sir.
She's really good.

772
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,737
No. That's not gonna happen.

773
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,142
Dad!

774
01:11:57,481 --> 01:12:00,314
Dad, I'm sorry
I lied to you, OK?

775
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,385
But all I've ever
wanted to do is race.

776
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,512
You're not getting
behind the wheel.

777
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:08,955
Because I'm a girl? I've had
one crash. Ray's had dozens!

778
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,617
It's different!

779
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:12,753
The only difference
is your support!

780
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,229
What's really your problem
with me racing?

781
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,964
Because you're the
spitting image of your mom.

782
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:29,105
And... I can't lose her twice.

783
01:12:30,413 --> 01:12:34,042
Dad, I may look like her
on the outside,

784
01:12:34,151 --> 01:12:36,449
OK, but on the inside, I'm you.

785
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:38,020
I'm a Peyton.

786
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:40,715
Racing is in my blood.

787
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:42,519
Please, let me race.

788
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:46,853
I can't.

789
01:12:48,165 --> 01:12:49,530
I'm sorry.

790
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,506
I got it. OK.

791
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:01,669
All right. Fine. Bye.

792
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,842
I have bad news. I just got off
the phone with my supplier.

793
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:14,788
They're not gonna give me parts
until I pay my overdue bills,

794
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:18,954
- which you need money to do.
- So you can't fix Herbie?

795
01:13:19,029 --> 01:13:20,519
I...

796
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:36,669
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- Mags, I'm not blind.

797
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:40,580
I just can't race.
But you can.

798
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:42,777
You're taking my space tomorrow.

799
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:44,751
Well, wait. What about Dad?

800
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:48,052
Dad always says
I should be a team leader.

801
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:51,685
I called rest of the crew.
They agree. You're the one.

802
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,393
Look, we got a lot to do

803
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:01,198
if we wanna get my car
ready to race.

804
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:04,502
There's one car I'm gonna drive.
He's sitting over there.

805
01:14:06,243 --> 01:14:07,437
You serious?

806
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,536
I race in Herbie,
or I don't race at all.

807
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:13,042
I'm with Trip Murphy,
Nextel Cup Series champion.

808
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,839
The prevailing wisdom
in the press box

809
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:19,177
is that your only worry is you
don't have enough shelf space

810
01:15:19,249 --> 01:15:20,978
for a fourth championship.

811
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:23,314
Tell the boys
thanks for the support.

812
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,321
But it's a tough track.
It's a 500-mile race.

813
01:15:26,423 --> 01:15:28,857
There are some
competent drivers out here.

814
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:31,052
Jeff Gordon's a decent driver.

815
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,322
There's an outside shot
he could win.

816
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:35,455
I guess what
I'm saying is, it's a...

817
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:38,399
...long race and anything
can happen in this sport.

818
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:56,074
We love you, Trip!

819
01:15:57,454 --> 01:16:00,184
I thought you told me
you destroyed that car.

820
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:04,090
- I'm sorry, dude.
- Hey, Trip.

821
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,787
I know you're gonna win,

822
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,729
but on the microscopic chance
she beats you again,

823
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:11,323
I've set up a Slim-Fast
"Big Loser" campaign.

824
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:12,698
So there's that.

825
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,006
- He's mad at me.
- He's mad at me.

826
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:20,770
- Hates me.
- He hates us both.

827
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:23,813
- Never seen a Bug with a spoiler.
- Don't touch.

828
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:32,717
Soft top on a racecar.

829
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:35,189
- I like that.
- I like that.

830
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:41,689
- This car just winked at me.
- A racecar winked at you.

831
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:44,097
I swear. The car winked at me.

832
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,658
Are you feeling OK?
Is it the pressure?

833
01:16:46,736 --> 01:16:49,296
I'm fine! Fine.

834
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:52,432
No problem. I'm telling you,
it just winked at me.

835
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:57,574
- Hey, Kev.
- Hey.

836
01:16:57,647 --> 01:17:00,138
- Could we get a second alone?
- You and...?

837
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:02,309
- Herbie.
- Of course. Hey, guys.

838
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:05,946
Ray? Augie? Let's give
the lady some space, huh?

839
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:08,023
- Sure.
- Thanks, guys.

840
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:23,194
You nervous?

841
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:28,504
It's good to be nervous.
Keeps you alert.

842
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:35,107
I just want to say,
in the spirit of honesty,

843
01:17:35,185 --> 01:17:37,380
I did total a car once
when I was racing.

844
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,913
That was a long time ago.

845
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:46,493
Hey, um...
Thanks for not giving up on me.

846
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,559
All right.

847
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:54,296
Ready to do this thing?

848
01:17:57,807 --> 01:18:00,401
Cool. Let's show them
what we got.

849
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:56,790
Here we go, Herbie.
This is it.

850
01:18:56,866 --> 01:19:00,495
- Maggie Peyton. Is that right?
- That's what I've got too.

851
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,131
<i>So it's Maggie Peyton</i>
<i>in #53 for Team Peyton</i>

852
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,607
<i>in a last-minute ruling</i>
<i>by race officials.</i>

853
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:09,270
What? Come on.
You've tried to think of a way

854
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:11,108
to sell gear
to women for years.

855
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,182
<i>It says she calls</i>
<i>the car Herbie.</i>

856
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,740
<i>I've never heard</i>
<i>of a VW Bug racing NASCAR,</i>

857
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:17,979
<i>but Team Peyton</i>
<i>found a loophole.</i>

858
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,146
- Go, Maggie!
- What are you doing?

859
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,690
You go, girl! Whoo!

860
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:27,087
Go, Maggie, go!

861
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:43,377
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>rise for our national anthem.</i>

862
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:16,868
Here we go.

863
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:26,481
- Go get 'em.
- Thanks.

864
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:30,484
Is this what you dreamed
it'd be like?

865
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,020
Yeah. I mean, I wanted my dad
here cheering me on, but...

866
01:20:35,098 --> 01:20:38,192
Yeah. There's something
I want to say to you.

867
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:40,997
I guess
I underestimated you guys.

868
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:48,537
Good luck out there today.

869
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:50,670
Thanks, Trip.

870
01:20:50,747 --> 01:20:54,478
Word to the wise:
It gets pretty nasty out there.

871
01:20:55,585 --> 01:20:58,554
Uh, Trip, we got a race.

872
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:01,146
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Don't listen to him.

873
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:04,317
He's trying to get inside your head.
Kev, let's go.

874
01:21:04,394 --> 01:21:05,452
All right.

875
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:09,188
So, you wanted
to tell me something.

876
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:11,426
Yeah...

877
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,935
I was gonna say,
don't cut your turns too tight.

878
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:16,471
Got it, chief.

879
01:21:17,507 --> 01:21:19,338
OK.

880
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:27,313
Let's go!

881
01:21:45,668 --> 01:21:51,231
<i>Drivers, start your engines!</i>

882
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:12,653
<i>We've got</i>
<i>the makings of a great race today.</i>

883
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:15,630
<i>Beautiful weather</i>
<i>and a great field of cars</i>

884
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:18,599
<i>as they head out</i>
<i>for their two pace laps.</i>

885
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:21,136
<i>We anticipate</i>
<i>a record crowd.</i>

886
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:23,104
<i>Fans have come to see</i>
<i>which driver</i>

887
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:25,231
<i>will hoist</i>
<i>the Nextel Cup trophy.</i>

888
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:27,503
<i>Great stories</i>
<i>bookend this field.</i>

889
01:22:27,577 --> 01:22:29,442
<i>Trip Murphy, star of the season,</i>

890
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:32,777
<i>will lead the field to the</i>
<i>green flag from pole position.</i>

891
01:22:32,882 --> 01:22:35,908
<i>Then there's Maggie Peyton,</i>
<i>starting last.</i>

892
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:37,781
<i>We'll see if she has what it takes</i>

893
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:40,014
<i>and if Herbie has</i>
<i>a good enough engine.</i>

894
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:43,183
<i>The pace car is off,</i>
<i>the green flag is out,</i>

895
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:46,193
<i>and we're underway here</i>
<i>at California Speedway!</i>

896
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:53,331
Those guys are fast!

897
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,565
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>the 53 car got left in the dust.</i>

898
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,334
<i>There is a minimum speed.</i>

899
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:00,534
<i>She better get going</i>
<i>or get a black flag.</i>

900
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,408
Come on, Herbie.
We're not out of this yet.

901
01:23:05,281 --> 01:23:07,545
Come on, Mags. Go!

902
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,813
<i>Rookie jitters</i>
<i>or a mechanical problem,</i>

903
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,411
<i>but Maggie Peyton's</i>
<i>barely hanging on now.</i>

904
01:23:13,523 --> 01:23:15,218
OK. Let's go get Dale!

905
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:22,255
<i>Herbie</i>
<i>starts to gain ground.</i>

906
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:25,232
<i>Here's Peyton drafting up</i>
<i>to Dale Jarrett in the 88.</i>

907
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:30,162
<i>Wait. I don't</i>
<i>think Herbie's drafting.</i>

908
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,605
<i>I think he's</i>
<i>literally attached to #88.</i>

909
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:34,700
That little car's
riding my bumper!

910
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:37,041
<i>Come on, Dale,</i>
<i>shake her off!</i>

911
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,782
Hang on!

912
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:43,616
Come on, Maggie.

913
01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:48,752
Here we go! Ready?

914
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:51,249
<i>What a move!</i>

915
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,818
<i>Maggie just did a slingshot on</i>
<i>Dale Jarrett to move past #88.</i>

916
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:56,728
Yes! Go, Mags!

917
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:59,859
Unorthodox, but it
put her back in the race.

918
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:02,631
I bet her granddad's
smiling at that one.

919
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:06,800
We're back in it.
Who's running first?

920
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:09,003
<i>Trip has Junior</i>
<i>by 2 lengths.</i>

921
01:24:17,787 --> 01:24:19,482
Come on, Mags!

922
01:25:01,731 --> 01:25:04,723
<i>Best pit stop</i>
<i>of the day for Team Peyton.</i>

923
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,358
<i>That keeps them in the hunt.</i>

924
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,699
<i>Got a hungry pack</i>
<i>chasing the leaders.</i>

925
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:12,798
<i>Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon,</i>
<i>Mike Bliss, all after the top spot.</i>

926
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:16,470
<i>Maggie Peyton</i>
<i>and Herbie come up on the outside.</i>

927
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:19,981
Eighteen laps to go in one
of the most surprising races

928
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:21,448
in NASCAR history.

929
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:23,609
<i>Trip Murphy in #82 is in front.</i>

930
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,187
<i>But can he hold the lead</i>
<i>in the final laps?</i>

931
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:27,278
Here we come.

932
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:37,965
Herbie, we gotta find
an opening!

933
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:41,565
We'll make a move on turn three.

934
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,373
They're boxing us in.

935
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:47,966
<i>Three wide</i>
<i>behind the leaders!</i>

936
01:25:48,044 --> 01:25:49,875
<i>Labonte low,</i>
<i>Peyton in the middle!</i>

937
01:25:49,946 --> 01:25:53,313
<i>Peyton takes a shot from Gordon</i>
<i>and one from Labonte.</i>

938
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:55,475
<i>And now one from Kasey Kahne!</i>

939
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,711
<i>Herbie's getting pounded</i>
<i>in this pack!</i>

940
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:03,656
- I'm getting killed. Can't shake them!
- Yes, you can.

941
01:26:03,726 --> 01:26:05,887
You can do this, sparkplug.

942
01:26:05,962 --> 01:26:09,227
- Dad?
- Buckle down and grit your teeth.

943
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:10,799
<i>Come on, Magpie.</i>

944
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:15,098
You're the next great Peyton.
Time for everyone to know it.

945
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:16,536
Thanks, Dad.

946
01:26:20,309 --> 01:26:21,571
Look at that.

947
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:22,736
Now what?

948
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:29,112
- Any suggestions?
- Gas it. Gas it right now!

949
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,487
Huh?

950
01:26:35,558 --> 01:26:38,356
<i>There's</i>
<i>running over competition,</i>

951
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:40,122
<i>but never done like that!</i>

952
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,857
- Yeah!
- Yah-hah!

953
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:44,399
- Oh-ho!
- Yeah!

954
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:48,199
Uh-oh. We've got a new problem.

955
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:51,433
Herbie's losing
oil pressure... fast!

956
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:57,712
Looks like the 53's
leaking oil on the track.

957
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,111
We're coming in.

958
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:05,414
Kevin, it's Sally.
What's going on with #53?

959
01:27:05,521 --> 01:27:08,581
- Did you drive here?
- Yeah. Why?

960
01:27:08,691 --> 01:27:11,091
<i>Here comes</i>
<i>the caution flag.</i>

961
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,253
<i>Everyone to the pits.</i>

962
01:27:13,329 --> 01:27:17,060
<i>Team Peyton may be out of</i>
<i>the race with that oil leak.</i>

963
01:27:36,886 --> 01:27:39,377
That stunt you pulled
almost cost us the race!

964
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:41,615
Take care of the car
and let me drive.

965
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:46,156
- Can I make two suggestions?
- Not now, Larry!

966
01:27:50,533 --> 01:27:53,093
Not a perfect fit,
but it'll have to hold!

967
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:56,768
- How bad is it?
- It might hold for 5 laps.

968
01:27:56,839 --> 01:27:58,739
It might hold for one.

969
01:27:58,808 --> 01:28:02,073
Either way, avoid being
slammed around out there!

970
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:08,842
Listen. You raced your heart
out there today, Herbie.

971
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:13,251
But if we keep going, that might
be it for you. Forever.

972
01:28:14,824 --> 01:28:17,816
Sorry. I'd rather lose
this race than lose you.

973
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:25,364
Whoa! Oh!
Are you sure?

974
01:28:25,434 --> 01:28:27,299
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

975
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:30,429
<i>Maggie Peyton and Herbie</i>
<i>are getting back on the track!</i>

976
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,935
For a car,
you're not a good listener.

977
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,940
OK, Herbie. Let's finish this.

978
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:54,922
Where is she, Crash?
The Bug! Where's the Bug?

979
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,123
Focus on the win!

980
01:28:56,198 --> 01:29:00,328
<i>The fans are pulling</i>
<i>for rookie driver Maggie Peyton,</i>

981
01:29:00,402 --> 01:29:02,370
<i>in a car she calls Herbie.</i>

982
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,334
Attagirl. Nice move.
Now go get 'em, Maggie!

983
01:29:10,412 --> 01:29:12,937
<i>Peyton</i>
<i>on an incredible rally,</i>

984
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,710
<i>passing them left and right.</i>

985
01:29:14,817 --> 01:29:18,685
<i>Now up to second place,</i>
<i>behind Trip Murphy. Amazing!</i>

986
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:21,853
Come on.

987
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:30,264
Did you miss us?

988
01:29:30,332 --> 01:29:33,165
This girl's really
beginning to tick me off.

989
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:35,635
<i>2 laps to go</i>
<i>in a two-car race.</i>

990
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,265
<i>Trip Murphy and Maggie Peyton</i>
<i>will settle this between them!</i>

991
01:29:39,341 --> 01:29:41,468
Go, Maggie!

992
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:43,603
- All right!
- We've got him now!

993
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:52,878
On the outside!

994
01:29:53,923 --> 01:29:55,413
Go high, Herbie.

995
01:30:01,263 --> 01:30:03,390
Come on, Herbie.
We're almost there.

996
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:07,458
<i>Door to door</i>
<i>off the corner at the final... Contact!</i>

997
01:30:07,536 --> 01:30:09,595
<i>Murphy slams</i>
<i>into the side of Peyton!</i>

998
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:19,005
Mags, don't push it.
Mags, Herbie can't take it.

999
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:32,257
- Forget the Bug and win!
- You're going down, Bug!

1000
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:40,762
<i>Trouble in turn four!</i>

1001
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:43,430
<i>Murphy into the wall</i>
<i>and upside down!</i>

1002
01:30:44,573 --> 01:30:48,509
OK, Herbie, you ready?

1003
01:30:48,577 --> 01:30:50,977
- Keep it steady!
- Ahh!

1004
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:53,879
<i>No place to go!</i>
<i>Look out for the crash!</i>

1005
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,917
<i>Herbie's...</i>

1006
01:30:56,018 --> 01:30:58,919
<i>Herbie's on the fence!</i>
<i>Herbie's on the fence!</i>

1007
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,093
Oh! Oh, God!

1008
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:13,567
<i>Maggie Peyton won!</i>

1009
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:17,402
- <i>Maggie Peyton has won! Incredible!</i>
- <i>Unbelievable!</i>

1010
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:19,998
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>like this in NASCAR,</i>

1011
01:31:20,075 --> 01:31:23,636
<i>not to mention the birth</i>
<i>of the next great Peyton!</i>

1012
01:31:32,388 --> 01:31:35,880
We did it.

1013
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,830
Let's go!

1014
01:31:41,897 --> 01:31:43,831
Whoo-hoo!

1015
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:08,754
- Whoo!
- Yes!

1016
01:32:12,061 --> 01:32:14,495
I'm so proud of you!

1017
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:16,622
Thanks, Dad.

1018
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:18,326
Maggie, that was awesome!

1019
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,233
- Thank you.
- So great!

1020
01:32:26,008 --> 01:32:28,306
Hey! I thought
your depth perception...

1021
01:32:28,377 --> 01:32:30,311
Oh, well,

1022
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:33,473
the best Peyton was on
the track today. You did it.

1023
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:36,416
- Congrats.
- Oh...

1024
01:32:36,518 --> 01:32:38,110
Look!
Listen to me!

1025
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,812
That car is possessed!

1026
01:32:39,922 --> 01:32:41,321
Trip!

1027
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:44,888
I saw it too.
It smiled at me!

1028
01:32:46,028 --> 01:32:47,825
That car is alive!

1029
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:51,263
You gotta believe me.
It's mocking me!

1030
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:53,801
I'm telling you!
That car is alive!

1031
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:59,772
Look! It's doing it again!

1032
01:32:59,842 --> 01:33:02,936
You gotta believe me!
You gotta believe me!

1033
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:04,808
This isn't the end, Bug!

1034
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,338
I'm going to get you, Bug!
I'm going to get you!

1035
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:12,079
He's fine. He's fine.
Just a little dehydrated.

1036
01:33:13,322 --> 01:33:14,949
Wow.

1037
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,588
Gotta say, Peyton, you and
Herbie make a great team.

1038
01:33:21,663 --> 01:33:23,995
We make a great team.

1039
01:33:24,066 --> 01:33:27,558
Yeah, I thought we had good
driver-crew chief rapport there.

1040
01:33:27,636 --> 01:33:30,070
Herbie, help me out here.

1041
01:33:30,139 --> 01:33:31,470
Wha...

1042
01:33:58,367 --> 01:34:01,097
All right, now, I'm gonna trust
you guys this time,

1043
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:02,899
but you got
a big race coming up.

1044
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:06,532
Have her home at a decent hour.
Show some respect. All right?

1045
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:08,405
My house, my rules.
<i>Comprende?</i>

1046
01:34:09,745 --> 01:34:12,009
OK, Ray,
I think they got it.

1047
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,105
All right.

1048
01:34:14,183 --> 01:34:16,674
Go on. Get out of here.

1049
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:21,623
I mean it, Herbie.

1050
01:34:27,062 --> 01:34:29,292
Rrrrr!
