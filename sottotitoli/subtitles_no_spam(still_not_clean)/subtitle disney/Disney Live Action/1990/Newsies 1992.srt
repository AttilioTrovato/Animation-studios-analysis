00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,921
- How many?
- Don't rush me.

161
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,690
I'm perusin' the merchandise,
Mr. Weasel.

162
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,028
[Laughing]

163
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,332
- The usual.
- One hundred papes to the wise guy.

164
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,338
- Next.
- Morning, Your Honor.

165
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,398
Listen, do me a favor,
spot me 50 papes, huh?

166
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,876
- I got a hot tip on the fourth.
You won't waste your money.
- It's a sure thing?

167
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,879
Oh, yeah.
Not like last time.

168
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,007
50 papes. Next!

169
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,950
Heya, Mr. Weisel.

170
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,322
[Indistinct Chatter]

171
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,988
- Anything good this mornin'?
- You wanna sit down?

172
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,224
- Next!
- 20 papes, please.

173
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,061
- 20 papes.
- Thanks.

174
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:13,800
Look at this:
"Baby Born With Two Heads."
Must be from Brooklyn.

175
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,341
Hey, hey, you got your papes.
Now beat it.

176
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,867
I paid for 20
and I only got 19.

177
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,175
[Weasel]
Are you accusing me of lying, kid?

178
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,443
No, I just want my paper.

179
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,747
He said beat it.

180
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,716
No, it's 19, Weasel.
But don't worry about it.

181
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,260
It's an honest mistake.

182
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,127
Morris, he can't count
to 20 with his shoes on.

183
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,758
[Weasel]
All right, get outta here.

184
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,667
- Race, will you spot me two bits?
- Here.

185
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,399
Thanks. Another 50
for my friend here.

186
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,407
- I don't want another 50.
- Sure you do.

187
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,104
- Every newsie wants more papes.
- I don't.

188
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't want your papes.

189
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,982
I don't take charity from anybody,
I don't even know you, I don't care to.

190
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,917
So, here are your papes.

191
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,787
- Cowboy, they call him Cowboy.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,851
That and a lot of other things,
including Jack Kelly, which is
what my mudder called me.

193
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,022
- What do they call you, kid?
- Les.

194
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,089
And this is my brother, David.
He's older.

195
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,033
- Oh, no kiddin'. How old are you, Les?
- Near ten.

196
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,095
Near ten, that's no good.
If anyone asks, say you're seven.

197
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,538
Younger sells more papes, Les.

198
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,441
- If we're gonna be partners,
we want to be the best...
- Wait, wait!

199
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,445
Who said anything
about partners?

200
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,971
Well, you owe me
two bits, right?

201
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,716
So, I'll consider that an investment.
We sell together, we split...

202
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,984
70/30, plus
you get the benefit...

203
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,583
- of observing me, no charge.
- Ah-ha!

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,252
Ah-ha!

205
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,729
You're gettin' the chance
of a lifetime here, Davey.

206
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,825
- You learn from Jack,
you learn from the best.
- The best.

207
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,303
- If he's the best,
then how come he needs me?
- Oooh!

208
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,364
Listen, I don't
need you, pal.

209
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,843
But I ain't got a cute, little brother
like Les to front for me.

210
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,813
With this kid's puss
and my God-given talent,

211
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,941
we could move
a thousand papes a week.

212
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,646
- So, what do you say, Les?
You wanna sell papes for me?
- Yeah!

213
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,986
- So it's a deal?
- Wait, hold it!

214
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,582
It's gotta be
at least 50/50.

215
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,187
- 60/40 or I forget the whole thing.
- That's fair.

216
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,495
- A golden opportunity.
- That's fair, David.

217
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,536
What do you say?

218
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,937
It's very fair.

219
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,278
- What's the matter?
- That's disgusting.

220
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,880
The name of the game
is volume, Dave.

221
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,355
You only took 20 papes.
Why?

222
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,188
- Bad headline.
- That's the first thing you gotta learn.

223
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,663
- Headlines don't sell papes.
Newsies sell papes.
- Newsies, right!

224
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,497
We hold this town together.
Without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'.

225
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,436
- That's right. Hey, fellas.
- Look at that angel.

226
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,370
- What a heaven!
- Whoa!

227
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,806
"Baby Born
With Three Heads!"

228
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:08,404
- [Chattering]
- Get your papes here!

229
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:22,082
"Trolley Strike Drags On...

230
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,994
For Third Week."

231
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:29,558
And this so-called headline
drags on for infinity.

232
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,603
[Man]
The news is slow, Mr. Pulitzer.

233
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,365
The trolley strike's
all we got.

234
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,999
That's all Mr. William
Randolph Hearst has too.

235
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,010
But look how he covers the strike.
Look, look, look!

236
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,046
We'll get a new
headline writer, sir.

237
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,479
We'll steal Hearst's man.
Offer him double.

238
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,712
That's how he stole him from us.
It's not the headlines, Chief.

239
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
These circulation wars
are cutting into our profits...

240
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,048
because you spend as much
as you make trying to beat Hearst.

241
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,490
Then we need to make
more profits.

242
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,996
You do not penny pinch
when you're in a war, Seitz.

243
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,294
Victory means everything.
When I created "The World"...

[Shouting]

245
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,636
What is that
deafening noise?

246
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,409
Just the newsies, sir.
I'll go have them quieted.

247
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,641
Never mind the newsies.
[Chuckling]

248
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,648
Where was I?

249
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,413
- Creating "The World," Chief.
- Mmm.

250
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,789
There's lots of money down there
in those streets, gentlemen.

251
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,660
I wanna know how I
can get more of it...

252
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,698

at stake! Thank you.

Okay, show me again.

Buy me last pape, mister?

269
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,285
- It's heartbreakin', go get 'em.
- My father taught us not to lie.

270
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,984
Mine told me not to starve,
so we both got an education.

271
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,050
You're just makin' up things,
all these headlines.

272
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,688
I don't do nuttin' the guys
who write it don't do.

273
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,164
It ain't lyin'.
It's improvin' the truth a little.

Right hook.
Hey, come on.

- Look at that!
- Let's go. Strike him.

Come on!

280
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,619
The guy gave me
a quarter!

281
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,889
- Quick, give me
some more of those papes.
- Wait, hold it.

You smell like beer.

283
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,290
That's how I made the quarter.
The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some.

284
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,998
Hey, no drinkin'on the job.
It's bad for business.

285
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,236
What if somebody
called a cop on you?

286
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,244
Is he a friend of yours?

287
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,678

Okay, jump.

Hurry up.

00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,452
- [Jack] He's right behind us.
- Move!

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,185
Whoa!

300
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,390
- Where's he at?
- Over here.

301
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,061
Get down.

302
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,733
Sullivan!

303
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,837
Wait 'til I get you
back to the refuge!

304
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,479
I'm not running
any further.

305

- I want some answers.
- Shh.

306
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,569
Who is he, why was he chasing you
and what is this refuge?

307
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,333
Refuge is this jail
for kids.

308
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,933
The guy chasing me is Snyder.
He's the warden.

309
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,138
- You were in jail? Why?
- Yeah.

310
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,681
I was starvin'
so I stole some food.

311
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,115
- Right, food.
- Yeah, food.

312
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:17,212
- He called you Sullivan.
- Yeah, my name's Jack Kelly.
You think I'm lyin'?

313
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,555
- You have a way of improving the truth.
- Yeah?

314
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,561
- Why was he chasin' ya?
- 'Cause I escaped.

315
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,062
Oh boy, how?

316
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,156
This big shot gave me
a ride out in his carriage.

317
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,565
I bet it was
the mayor, right?

318
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,400
No, Teddy Roosevelt.

Out, out, out, out!

321
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,668
You wouldn't kick me out
without a kiss good-bye,
would you, Medda?

322
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,682
Oh, Kelly!

323
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,218
Where you been, kid?

324
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,517
Oh, I miss seeing you
up in the balcony.

325
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,490
Hangin' on
your every word.

326
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,689
- So, Medda, this is David and Les.
- Hello.

327
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,755
- And this is the greatest star
of the vaudeville stage today,
- No.

328
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,268
Miss Medda Larkson,
the Swedish meadowlark.

329
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,897
- "Velcome," gentlemen.
- Medda also owns the joint.

330
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,739
Well, what have we here?

331
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,712
Oh, aren't you
the cutest fellow that ever was.

332
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,877
- Oh yes, you are.
- [Coughing]

333
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,785
Oh, are you
all right?

334
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,625
Buy me last pape, lady?

335
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,185
Oh, you are good.

336
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,695
Oh, yeah,
this kid is really good.

337
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,796
Speaking as one professional to another,
I'd say you've got a great future.

338
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,171
Is it all right if we
stay here for a while?

339
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,234
Just 'til the problem
outside goes away.

340
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,472
Oh, sure, stay
as long as you like.

341
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,005
Toby, give my guests
whatever they want.

342
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,212
Lads, whatever you'd like.

343
00:20:55,287 --> 00:21:00,054
Gumdrops, gumdrops.
Licorice whips.

344
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,525

[Cheering, Applause]

354
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,436
- So you liked that?
- Oh, I loved that.

355
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,637
It was great.
She is beautiful.

356
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:58,581
- How do you know her?
- She's a friend of my father's.

357
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,677
Come on, Les.
You wanna shine my shoes?

358
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,055
It's gettin' late.
My parents are gonna be worried.

359
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:14,258
- What about yours?
- They're out west
looking for a place to live.

360
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,361
Like this.

361
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,463
That's Santa Fe, New Mexico.

362
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,633
As soon as they find the right ranch,
they're gonna send for me.

363
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,870
- Then you'll be a real cowboy.
- Yep.

364
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,710
[Indistinct Noise]

365
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,781

366
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,118
Come on, fellas!
Wait up!

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,217
[Indistinct Shouting]

368
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,857
Jack, why don't we go back
to my place and divvy up?

369
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,163
You can meet my folks.

370
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:57,140
It's the trolley strike, Dave,
these dumb asses must not have joined.

371
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,177
Jack, let's get
outta here.

372
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,270
[Bell Clanging]

373
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:07,375
So, maybe we get
a good headline tomorrow.

374
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,114
Look at this.
He slept through it.

375
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,820
[Shouting]

376
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,602
- My God, what happened?
- Nothin', he's sleepin'.

377
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,572
We've been waiting dinner.
Where have you been?

378
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,404
You made all of this
selling newspapers?

379
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,473
Half of it's Jack's.

380
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,920
This is our selling partner
and our friend,

381
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,980
Jack Kelly, my parents.

382
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,549
- Hello.
- That's my sister, Sarah.

383
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,499
Esther, maybe David's partner
would like to join us for dinner?

384
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:00,129
Why don't you add a little
more water to the soup?

385
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,230
Mayer.

386
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:07,074
[Thunder]

387
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,084
[Jack] I gotta say
from what I saw today,

388
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,677
your boys are
a couple of born newsies.

389
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,485
- Can I have a little more?
- Yes.

390
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,050
So with my experience
and their hard work,

391
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,961
I figure we can peddle
a thousand a week,

392
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,692
- not even break a sweat.
- That many?

393
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,961
More when the headlines
are good.

394
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,402
- What makes a headline good?
- Well, you know, um,

395
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,568
catchy words like
"maniac" or "corpse"...

396
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,840
or um, let's see,
"love nest" or "nude."

397
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,176
Excuse me.
Maybe I'm talkin' too much.

398
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,381
Sarah.

399
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,688
Go get the cake your mother's
hiding in the cabinet.

400
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,990
That's for
your birthday tomorrow.

401
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,191
I've had enough birthdays.
This is a celebration.

402
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,359
[David]
I'll get the knife.

403
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,403
[Sarah]
I got the plates.

404
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,904
It's only the beginning.
The longer I work,
the more money I'll make.

405
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,339
You only work until I go
back to the factory.

406
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:14,105
Then you are going back to
school like you promised.

407
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,014
Happy birthday, Papa.

408
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,678
- Thank you.
- Here's your knife.

409
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:25,746
This is going to heal.
They'll give me back my job.

410
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,985
[Mayer]
I'll make them.

411
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,426
Our visitor.

412
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,557
[Esther]
Apiece for David.

413
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,695
Thanks.

414
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:44,208
[Les]
[Music] Come back my lovey dovey baby [music]

416
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,919
[Esther]
And what is this, David?

417
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,922
So how did your pop
get hurt?

418
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,428
The factory.
It was an accident.

419
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:08,159
He's no good to them anymore
so they fired him.

420
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,135
He's got no union
to protect him.

421
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:19,175
David, it's time
to come in now.

422
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,179
- All right.
- All right.

423
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,775
Jack, why don't you
stay here tonight?

424
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,786
No, thanks.

425
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,322
I got my own place.

426
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,723
But your family's real nice,
Dave, like mine.

427
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,989
See you tomorrow.

428
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,896
All right.

429
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,129

[music] [Esther Humming]

431
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,257
[Music] So that's what
they call a family [music]

00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,789
[Music] Mother, daughter
father, son [music]

[Music] For you [music]

439
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:45,025
[Music] When I dream on my own [music]

440
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,930
[Music] I'm alone
but I ain't lonely [music]

[Music] And I'm on the train
that's bound for Santa Fe [music]

00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,683
[Music] And I'm free
like the wind [music]

446

[Music] Like I'm gonna
live forever [music]

447
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,556
[Music] It's a feeling
time can never [music]

448
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,996
[Music] Take away [music]

449
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,967

a few more dollars [music]

[Music] And I'm outta here
to stay [music]

a guy can't catch a break [music]

[Music] Why should you only
take what you're given [music]

I don't care [music]

[Music] Save a place
I'll be there [music]

00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,616
- Hey, Race.

483
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,493
- How was your day at the track?
- Remember that hot tip?

484
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:08,555
Nobody told the horse.

485
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:13,601
I know we need to make more money.
That's why we're here.

486
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,696
I have several proposals.
First,

to increase
the paper's price.

488
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:23,243
Oh, then Hearst undersells me
and I'm in the poorhouse.

489
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,578
Brilliant, Jonathan,
brilliant.

490
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:32,219
Not customer price, the price
to the distribution apparatus.

491
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,191
Charge the newsies more
for their papers?

492
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,728
Bad idea, Chief.

493
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,628
Very well,
my next proposal.

494
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:45,135
Salary cuts,
particularly those at the top.

495
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,671
- Very bad idea.
- Wait, wait, wait.

496
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,105
What do the newsies pay now,
50 cents per 100 papers?

497
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,200
If you raised it to, what?

498
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,270
- Sixty cents?
- A mere tenth of a cent per paper.

499
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,646
That multiplied by 40,000 papers a day.

Seven days a week.
[Adding Machine Sounds]

501
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,551
It definitely adds up, sir.

502
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:09,491
If you do this, every newsie
we've got will head for Hearst.

503
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,358
You don't know Hearst
like I do.

504
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,628
As newspapermen, he and I would cut each
other's throats to get an advantage.

505
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,226
But as gentlemen
and as businessmen,

506
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:23,263
we often see eye to eye
on certain things.

507
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:28,802
Now if we do it,
Hearst and I, if we do it,

508
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,782
then the other papers
will do it.

509
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,944
It's going to be
awfully rough on those children.

510
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,511
Nonsense, nonsense.
It'll be good for them.

511
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,183
Incentive, make them work
harder, sell more papers.

512
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,195
They'll look on it...
as a challenge.

513
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,629
Challenge.

514
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,032
They jacked up the price.

515
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,332
Did ya hear that, Jack?
Ten cents a 100.

516
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:58,740
It's bad enough we gotta eat
what we don't sell.

517
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,335
Now they jacked up the price!
Can you believe that?

518
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,142
This'll bust me.
I'm barely makin' a living right now.

sleepin' on the streets.

520
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,482
It don't make no sense,
all the money Pulitzer's makin'.
Why would he gouge us?

521
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,319
He's a tightwad,
that's why.

522
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,882
Pipe down,
it's just a gag.

523
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,396

- Why not?

Mr. Pulitzer?

They can't do this
to me, Jack.

00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,261
Jack, I was joking. We can't strike,
we don't have a union.

00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,275
Yeah, but if we go on strike,
then we are a union, right?

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,990
What about Brooklyn?
Who wants Brooklyn?

646
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,496
Come on,
Spot Conlon's territory.

647
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,339
- What's the matter, scared of Brooklyn?
- We ain't scared of Brooklyn!

648
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,273
Spot Conlon makes us
a little nervous.

649
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:49,745
- He don't make me nervous.
You and me, Boots, we'll go.
- All right.

650
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,806
And Dave can keep us company.

651
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,852
- Right, Dave?
- Sure, as soon as you take
our demands to Pulitzer.

652
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,350
- Me to Pulitzer?
- You're the leader, Jack.

653
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,487
Go tell him, Jack!

654
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,196

soften him up a bit.

Strike!

658
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,947
[Denton] What is this strike?
What's going on?

659
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,420
We're bringing
our demands to Pulitzer.

660
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,550
- What demands?
- The newsies' demands. We're on strike.

661
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,055
I'm with "The New York Sun."
I'm Bryan Denton.

662
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,896
You seem like the kid in charge.
What's your name?

663
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:48,564
- David.
- David, as in David and Goliath?

664
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,868
- You really think Pulitzer's
gonna listen to your demands?
- He has to.

665
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,937
- [Man] Out!
- So's your old lady!

666
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,145
- Tell Pulitzer he needs
an appointment with me!
- Yeah!

667
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,652
So this real snooty mug says,
"You can't see Mr. Pulitzer.

668
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,992
No one sees Mr. Pulitzer."
Real hoity-toity, you know.

669
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:18,865
- Real hoity-toity.
- I said, "I ain't transactin'
business with office boys.

670
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,303
Just tell him Jack Kelly's
here to see him now."

671
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,171
- That's when he threw us out.
- Ha-ha!

672
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:29,872
Does it scare ya?
You're goin'up against
the most powerful man in New York City.

Look at me,
I'm tremblin'.

I wanna know everything
that's going on.

676
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,124
- Are we really an important story?
- Well, what's important?

677
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,162
Last year I covered
the war in Cuba.

678
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,063
Charged up San Juan Hill
with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt.

679
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:52,398
That was a very
important story.

680
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:57,702
So, is the newsies' strike important?
It depends on you.

681
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,575

gonna be in the papers?

like they're goin' on strike.

702

- Well, we're not playin'.
We are goin' on strike.

some kind of walkin' mouth?

Yeah, it's a mouth,
a mouth with a brain.

If you got half of one,
you'll listen.

Go on, tell him.

708
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,708
Well, we started the strike,
but we can't do it alone.

709
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,303
So we've been talkin' to other newsies
all around the city.

710
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:21,715
Yeah, so they told me.
But what did they tell you?

711
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,219
They're waitin' to see
what Spot Conlon does.
You're the key.

712
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:30,090
That Spot Conlon is the most respected
and famous newsie in all of New York.

713

And probably
everywhere else.

714
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,327
And if Spot Conlon joins the strike,
then they'll join.

715
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,893
We'll be unstoppable.
You gotta join us because...
Well, you gotta.

about us bein' serious.

ease off a little.

Kloppman?

973
01:04:54,356 --> 01:04:56,187
Very good.
That's very good.

974
01:04:56,258 --> 01:04:58,249
I like it. Yeah.

975
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:05,730
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

976
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:09,237
You have a boy who
calls himself Jack Kelly?

977
01:05:09,304 --> 01:05:14,435
- I wish to see him.
- Jack Kelly?
Jack... Never heard of him.

978
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:19,003
Never heard of him.

979
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,241
Any of you boys ever
heard of Jack Kelly?

980
01:05:21,316 --> 01:05:23,841
That's unusual name
for these parts.

981
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:26,820
[Racetrack]
Oh, you mean Jack Kelly!

982
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,354
Yeah, he was here.

983
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:33,417
But he put an egg in
his shoe and beat it.

984
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:35,258
[Laughter]

985
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:43,861
I have reason to believe
that he is an escaped prisoner,
possibly dangerous.

986
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:46,737
Oh! Dangerous?

987
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:50,175
[Kloppman]
I better look in my files.

988
01:05:50,245 --> 01:05:53,908
Oh, this way, please.

989
01:05:53,982 --> 01:05:56,712
Give to the
newsie strike fund, mister?

990
01:05:56,785 --> 01:05:59,686
Huh?

991
01:06:27,215 --> 01:06:30,912
Did you sleep out there
all night?

992
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:32,419
Yeah.

993
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:34,717
Why didn't you
wake us up?

994
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:39,590
Well, I didn't want
to disturb nobody.

995
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:43,461
Anyway, it's like
the Waldorf out here,

996
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:46,932
great view and cool air.

997
01:06:49,137 --> 01:06:51,662
Go up on the roof.

998
01:07:09,758 --> 01:07:12,158
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

999
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:15,253
Good, 'cause
I made you breakfast.

1000
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,909
Papa's so proud
of you and David.

1001
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,848
You should hear him
talking about Jack Kelly,

1002
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:39,944
the strike leader who occasionally
takes his meals with us.

1003
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:44,822
This is one strike leader who's gonna
be very happy when it's all over.

1004
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:48,624
I can get outta here
and go to Santa Fe.

1005
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:53,066
I mean, there's nothin'
for me to stay for, is there?

1006
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:04,406
You should see Santa Fe.
Everything's different there.

1007
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,538
It's all bigger.

1008
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:10,482
You know, the desert
and the sky and the sun.

1009
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,515
It's the same sun
as here.

1010
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:17,490
Yeah, just looks different.

1011
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:20,221
I should...

1012
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:22,229
get ready for work!

1013
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:27,030
Sarah, I'm just
not used to havin'...

1014
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:29,502
whether I stay or go
matter to anybody.

1015
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:39,038
I'm not sayin'
it should matter to you.

1016
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:42,550
I'm just sayin', um...

1017
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:47,645
But does it... matter?

1018
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:58,623
[Mayor] Of course,
the city is very concerned...

1019
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:03,364
that this event doesn't
get out of hand, but...

1020
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:05,804
Chief?

1021
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:08,968
We can't just charge in
and break it up, Mr. Pulitzer.

1022
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:11,308
- We've got no legal cause.
- Legal cause!

1023
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:16,180
Would the fact that this rally
is organized by an escaped criminal...

1024
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:18,185
be cause enough, Mayor?

1025
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:21,313
Escaped criminal?

1026
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:25,519
Fugitive from
one of your prisons.

1027
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:27,561
Convicted thief.

1028
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:33,295
He's been living at large
under the alias of Jack Kelly.

1029
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:35,302
- What's his real name?
- Sullivan.

1030
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,339
Francis Sullivan,

1031
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:42,467
Your Honor, I would've caught
him before now, but...

1032
01:09:45,914 --> 01:09:48,542
You know Warden Snyder,
don't you, Mayor?

1033
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:50,641
I believe you know him
because you... appointed him.

1034
01:09:50,718 --> 01:09:53,016
Yes.

1035
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,788
If this boy
is a fugitive,

1036
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:59,224
- then the chief can quietly arrest him.
- No, no, no.

1037
01:09:59,294 --> 01:10:01,762
Not quietly.
Not quietly!

1038
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,821
I want an example made.

1039
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:07,299
I want this rabble he's roused
to see what happens...

1040
01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:10,030
to those who would dare to...
[Growl]

1041
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:15,068
They should see justice
in action.

1042
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:18,840
- Arrest him at the rally.
- By the way, Mayor,

1043
01:10:18,913 --> 01:10:20,847
I'm having a few friends
for cards tonight,

1044
01:10:20,915 --> 01:10:23,748
newspaper friends,
Willie Hearst, Gordon Bennett.

1045
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:26,582
Perhaps you'll join us.

1046
01:10:26,654 --> 01:10:30,852
Talk about the...
coming election.

1047
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,658
I'd be honored.

1048
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:54,480
Carryin' the banner!

1049
01:10:54,549 --> 01:10:57,780
[Cheering]
Carryin' the banner!

1050
01:10:57,852 --> 01:11:02,152
You know the boys, Mayor.
This is Mr. Bennett
of The Tribune."

1051
01:11:02,223 --> 01:11:06,455
- Mr. Taylor of The Times."
- Nice to see you.

1052
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:10,225
- Of course, you know Mr. Hearst.
- Of course.

1053
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:12,698
This is a new member of
our little group, Mr. Gammon.

1054
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:15,497
- He just came back from Europe.
- Welcome home.

1055
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,971
Mr. Gammon owns, what?
"The New York Sun."

1056
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,974
Cigar, sir?

1057
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:23,943
We've come a long way,
but we ain't there yet.

1058
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:27,413
Maybe it's only gonna
get tougher from now on.

1059
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:30,747
But that's fine.
We'll just get tougher with it.

1060
01:11:30,818 --> 01:11:33,651
But also,
also we gotta get smart...

1061
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:38,317
- and start listenin' to my pal, David,
- Yeah!

1062
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:41,294
Who says,
"Stop soaking the scabs."

1063
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:43,660
What are we supposed to do
to the bums, kiss 'em?

1064
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:48,267
Any scab I see,
I soak 'em, period.

1065
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,031
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1066
01:11:50,104 --> 01:11:53,699
No! That's what
they want us to do.

1067
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:56,403
If we get violent,
it's playin' into their hands.

1068
01:11:56,477 --> 01:11:58,877
They're gonna be
playing with my hands.

1069
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,313
This ain't what they say,
it's what we say.

1070
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:05,045
Nobody ain't gonna listen
to us, unless we make 'em.

1071
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,680
[Shouting]

1072
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:12,624
You got no brains!
We're starting to fight each other,

1073
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,958
it's just what the
big shots wanna see.

1074
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:17,623
That we're street trash,
street rats with no brains,

1075
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,860
no respect for nothin'
including ourselves.

1076
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:24,268
So here's how it is. If we don't
act together, we're nothin'.

1077
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:28,867
If we don't stick together,
can't trust each other,
then we're nothin'.

1078
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:31,912
- Tell 'em, Jack!
- So, what's it gonna be?

1079
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,414
We're with you, Jack.

1080
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:40,750
So what do you say, Spot?

1081
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:47,453
I say that what you say...

1082
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:50,088
is what I say.

1083
01:12:50,164 --> 01:12:52,724
[Cheering]

1084
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,735
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right!

1085
01:13:01,175 --> 01:13:11,449
[music]

1086
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:14,579
[Music] High times, hard times [music]

1087
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:17,124
[Music] Sometimes the livin'
is sweet [music]

1088

[Music] And sometimes
there's nothin' to eat [music]

01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:23,655
[Music] But I always lands

1090
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:27,633
[Music] So when there's dry times [music]

1091
01:13:27,702 --> 01:13:29,966
[Music] I wait for high times
and then [music]

1092
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:33,804
[Music] I put on my best

1093
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:37,038
[Music] And I'm off
to the races again [music]

1094
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:40,603
- [Cheering]
- Oh, Medda!

1095
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:45,085
Hello, newsies?
What's new?

1096
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,629
[Medda] [music]So your old lady
don't love you no more [music]

1097
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:02,432
[Music]So you're afraid there's
a wolf at your door [music]

1098
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:08,100
[Music]So you got street rats
that scream in your ear [music]

01:14:09,677 --> 01:14:13,738
[Music] You win some

1100
01:14:13,815 --> 01:14:17,683
[Music] Oh, high times
hard times [music]

1101

1112
01:15:09,704 --> 01:15:12,832
Excuse me, aren't you
Warden Snyder?

1113
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:15,603
Bryan Denton of The Sun."
How do you do, sir?

1114
01:15:19,113 --> 01:15:21,479
I heard about your wonderful
work with the children.

1115
01:15:21,549 --> 01:15:23,983
I wondered if I might
get an interview.

1116
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:33,085
- Jack!
- Hi, David.

1117
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,425
- It's Snyder.
- What?

1118
01:15:35,496 --> 01:15:39,159
It's Snyder... right there.

1119
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:43,431
Let me get that correct.
"Snider" as in snide?

1120
01:15:43,504 --> 01:15:45,438
Smile, sir.

1121
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:48,168
Medda, thanks.
I gotta run.

1122
01:15:48,242 --> 01:15:51,109
[Whistle]

1123
01:15:56,751 --> 01:15:58,378
Hurry.

1124
01:16:00,354 --> 01:16:02,379
No!

1125
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,329
No! For God's sake!

1126
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:14,164
He's just a child.
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1127
01:16:14,235 --> 01:16:17,329
[Medda]
Racetrack!

1128
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:19,464
[David]
Get outta here now!

1129
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:23,135
Hey, come here!
Sullivan, I gotcha!

1130
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:30,847
Go up there.
All right, no, go here.

1131
01:16:33,888 --> 01:16:35,913
Push me.

1132
01:16:38,426 --> 01:16:40,826
Get outta here! Go!

1133
01:16:46,334 --> 01:16:48,734
- Stop where you are.
- Hey, come back!

1134
01:16:48,803 --> 01:16:50,964
Show's over, Cowboy.

1135
01:16:59,013 --> 01:17:02,312
You all right?
Come on.

1136
01:17:13,728 --> 01:17:15,662
Stay back!

1137
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:51,990
[Man] Arise, arise.
Court is now in session.

1138
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:55,102
Judge E.A. Monahan presiding.

1139
01:17:55,169 --> 01:17:57,729
Are any of you represented
by counsel?

1140
01:17:57,805 --> 01:18:01,571
No. Good, good.

1141
01:18:01,642 --> 01:18:04,873
- That'll move things along considerably.
- Your Honor, I object.

1142
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,710
On what grounds?

1143
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:12,082
On the grounds of Brooklyn,
Your Honor.

1144
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:14,348
[Gavel Banging]

1145
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:16,788
I fine each of you $5.00,

1146
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:20,816
or two weeks'confinement
in the house of refuge.

1147
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:24,456
- He said five bucks.
- Whoa. Hey, we ain't got five bucks.

1148
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:26,625
We don't even got
five cents.

1149
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:30,933
Your Honor, how 'bout
I roll you for it?
Double or nothing.

1150
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:32,973
- Move along, move along.
- [Denton] Your Honor,

1151
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,134
I'll pay the fines,

1152
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,872
all of them.

1153
01:18:38,946 --> 01:18:41,471
- Fellas, you all right?
- It's David.

1154
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:44,211
- Where's Jack?
- Look, we got to meet
at the restaurant.

1155
01:18:44,285 --> 01:18:46,344
Everybody.
We have to talk.

1156
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,321
Pay the clerk.
Move it along.

1157
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:52,518
Hey, fellas!

1158
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:55,619
Hey, Cowboy, nice shiner.

1159
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:58,560
Pay the clerk.
Move it along.

1160
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,966
Hey, Denton, I guess
we made all the papes this time.

1161
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:06,166
- How'd my picture look?
- None of the papers covered the rally,

1162
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,174
not even "The Sun."

1163
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:10,938
Case of Jack Kelly.
Inciting to riot,

1164
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:13,947
assault, resisting arrest.

1165
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:17,644
Judge Monahan,
I'll speak for this young man.

1166
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:22,152
You two know each other.
Ain't that nice!

1167
01:19:22,223 --> 01:19:26,319
Just move it along,
Warden Snyder.

1168
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,659
This boy's real name
is Francis Sullivan.

1169
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:33,461
His mother's deceased,
his father's a convict.

1170
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:35,798
He's an escapee from
the house of refuge...

1171
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:38,805
where his sentence for three months
was extended to six months...

1172
01:19:38,873 --> 01:19:43,139
- for disruptive behavior.
- Like demanding we eat the food
you steal from us.

1173
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:46,179
Followed by an additional
six months for attempted escape.

1174
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:50,513
Attempted? Last time
wasn't an attempted escape.

1175
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:54,418
Remember me and Teddy Roosevelt
and the carriage?

1176
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:57,116
- You remember Roosevelt
and the carriage!
- I ask he be returned...

1177
01:19:57,191 --> 01:20:00,718
- to the house of refuge.
- Away for my own good,
right, move along?

1178
01:20:00,795 --> 01:20:03,764
For my own good and
what he kicks back to you.

1179
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:07,665
And that the court order his
incarceration until the age of 21...

1180
01:20:07,735 --> 01:20:11,762
in the hope that we may yet guide him
to a useful and productive life.

1181
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:14,069
So ordered!

1182
01:20:14,141 --> 01:20:16,439
No!

1183
01:20:18,045 --> 01:20:20,605
Next.

1184
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:30,323
Hey, Mr. Denton!

1185
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:37,389
- Thanks for bailing us out.
- My pleasure.

1186
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,336
- Why didn't "The Sun" print the story?
- Because it never happened.

1187
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:46,168
What do you mean? It never happened?
You were there!

1188
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,471
If it's not in the papers,
it never happened.

1189
01:20:49,543 --> 01:20:53,980
The owners decreed that it
not be in the papers, therefore...

1190
01:20:54,048 --> 01:20:58,451
Anyway, I came to tell
you fellas good-bye.

1191
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:04,382
- What happened? You get fired?
- No, I got reassigned...

1192
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:09,020
back to my old job as
"The Sun's" ace war correspondent.

1193
01:21:09,096 --> 01:21:11,121
They want me
to leave right away.

1194
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:16,898
The owner thinks I should only cover
the really important stories.

1195
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:22,372
Yep, well,
wish me luck, fellas,

1196
01:21:22,443 --> 01:21:25,003
at least half of what
I wish for you.

1197
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:29,675
They don't always
fire you, David.

1198
01:21:31,852 --> 01:21:36,255
I would be blackballed from
every paper in the country.

1199
01:21:36,323 --> 01:21:39,292
Hey,

1200
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,555
I'm a newspaperman.

1201
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:45,725
I have to have a paper
to write for.

1202
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,702
This is the, uh,

1203
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,830
story I wrote
about the rally.

1204
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:54,966
And...

1205
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,704
I want you to read it,
at least.

1206
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,519
Bill?

1207
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:17,553
- No, no.
- This should cover it. Thanks.

1208
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:41,080
We get Jack out of
the refuge tonight.

1209
01:22:41,155 --> 01:22:45,285
- From now on, we trust
no one but the newsies.
- Yeah!

1210
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:48,920
[Racetrack] Come on,
get the lead out of your pants.

1211
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:03,508
Move along, boy.

1212
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:18,283
That's where we saw Crutchy.

1213
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:20,657
[Whistle]

1214
01:23:20,728 --> 01:23:22,821
It's Jack.

1215
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,627
- It's Jack!
- Shh, shh.

1216
01:23:29,737 --> 01:23:30,965
Whoa, boy.

1217
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:34,872
Where they takin' him, Dave?

1218
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:37,672
There's one way to find out.

1219
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:43,850
I'll meet you guys
at the square.

1220
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:46,352
Racetrack, watch him.

1221
01:24:08,442 --> 01:24:10,672
Whoa, whoa, boy.

1222
01:24:14,214 --> 01:24:16,114
Get him inside.

1223
01:24:16,183 --> 01:24:21,052
[Man] Oh, well, about ready
to wrap up for the night.

1224
01:24:21,121 --> 01:24:24,887
- Gonna be another late one.
- Yes, I know.

1225
01:25:04,531 --> 01:25:06,499
Sit!

1226
01:25:13,507 --> 01:25:17,637
Know what I was doing
when I was your age, boy?

1227
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:20,612
I was in a war!

1228
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:26,142
- The Civil War.
- Yeah, I heard of it.
So... did you win?

1229
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:30,418
People think that wars
are about right or wrong.

1230
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:32,891
They're not.
They're about power.

1231
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,363
I heard of that too.
I don't just sell your papers,
Joe, sometimes I read 'em.

1232
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:43,297
Power of the press
is the greatest power of them all.

1233
01:25:44,905 --> 01:25:47,066
I tell this city
how to think.

1234
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:49,541
I tell this city
how to vote.

1235
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:53,410
I... shape its future.

1236
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,710
Yeah? Well, right now...

1237
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,809
I'm just thinking about
one future and that's mine.

1238
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:00,911
So am I, boy.

1239
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:04,446
I have the power to see that
you stay locked in the refuge.

1240
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:07,016
- And I have the power
to break out again.
- Or...

1241
01:26:07,094 --> 01:26:10,291
I could see you released
tomorrow free and clear...

1242
01:26:10,364 --> 01:26:15,358
with more money in your pockets than
you could earn in... three lifetimes.

1243
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:18,633
Are you bribin' me, Joe?

1244
01:26:18,705 --> 01:26:21,731
Mmm. Well,
no-no-no-no-no.

1245
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:25,802
It's been nice chattin' with you,
Joe, but I gotta be going now.

1246
01:26:25,879 --> 01:26:27,813
You listen to me, boy.

1247
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:30,179
Just shut your mouth
and listen to me.

1248
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:34,414
You shut up and listen
to me for once!

1249
01:26:34,488 --> 01:26:37,389
It's no game I'm playing.

1250
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:40,552
You work for me
until the strike is over.

1251
01:26:40,627 --> 01:26:44,324
It will end, boy,
make no mistake, without you.

1252
01:26:44,398 --> 01:26:47,060
Then you go wherever you
want to buy a ticket for.

1253
01:26:47,134 --> 01:26:50,126
Away from the refuge,
these foul streets.

1254
01:26:50,204 --> 01:26:52,138
Free!

1255
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:54,970
With money to spend
and nobody chasing you.

1256
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:08,618
I must have you scared
pretty bad, old man.

1257
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:12,250
I offer you freedom
and money just to work for me again.

1258
01:27:12,326 --> 01:27:17,389
To your friends,
I won't be so kind!

1259
01:27:17,464 --> 01:27:21,662
Now your partner,
what's his name, David?
I understand he has a family.

1260
01:27:21,735 --> 01:27:26,138
What do you think the
refuge will do to him?

1261
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:29,175
And it would be you
who put him there.

1262
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:32,974
And all the others.
After all, you're their leader.

1263
01:27:36,316 --> 01:27:40,252
Go back to the refuge tonight.
Think about it.

1264
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,552
Give me your answer
in the morning.

1265
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:51,491
Jack, come on!

1266
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:54,966
Come on! Run!

1267
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:57,694
After him!

1268
01:28:04,211 --> 01:28:07,408
Don't worry.
He's got no place to go.

1269
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,815
- Come on, keep running!
- You shouldn't have done this, Dave.

1270
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:19,290
- They could put you in jail.
- I don't care.

1271
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:21,350
Come here!

1272
01:28:21,428 --> 01:28:25,194
What about your family?
What happens to them if you go in jail?

1273
01:28:25,265 --> 01:28:28,234
You don't know nothin'
about jail.

1274
01:28:28,302 --> 01:28:32,466
Thanks for what you've done,
but you get outta here.

1275
01:28:32,539 --> 01:28:37,135
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand either,
but just get outta here!

1276
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:43,115
- No!
- Go!

1281
01:29:21,054 --> 01:29:22,919
Psst, Jack.

1282
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,858
Look. I snitched it off of
Snyder's plate when I was serving him.

1283
01:29:26,927 --> 01:29:30,454
It's the biggest one.
Oh, Mr. Snyder was eating good tonight.

1284
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:32,464
You know, the stuff
that we don't never get.

1285
01:29:32,532 --> 01:29:37,333
Potatoes, olives,
even bacon, sauerkraut.

1286
01:29:37,404 --> 01:29:40,237
Guess what I done
to his sauerkraut.

1287
01:29:40,307 --> 01:29:43,572
- So what's it get ya?
- Another three months.

1288
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:45,578
But you can't let him
beat ya, right, Jack?

1289
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,637
That's what you always say.

1290
01:29:47,714 --> 01:29:51,980
We was beat when we was born.

01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:46,901
Cheese it!
Cheese it!

1300
01:30:46,973 --> 01:30:51,501
- Cheese it! Race, please help me.
- All right, I ain't deaf.

1301
01:30:51,578 --> 01:30:56,538
Hey, hey, hey.
Break it up.

1302
01:30:56,616 --> 01:30:58,777
Hold it right there.

1303
01:30:58,852 --> 01:31:02,845
- Hey, Race, come here.
- What?

1304
01:31:02,923 --> 01:31:05,221
Tell me I'm just seein' things.
Just tell me I'm seein' things.

1305
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:08,159
[Racetrack]
You ain't seein'things. That's Jack.

1306
01:31:08,228 --> 01:31:11,061
- What's he doin'?
- He's dressed like a scabber.

1307
01:31:11,131 --> 01:31:14,862
Jack, look at me, will ya?
Come on, it's me, Mush.

1308
01:31:14,935 --> 01:31:16,994
Look at me!
What're you doing?

1309
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:20,403
This ain't happening!
What are you doin', Jack?

1310
01:31:20,474 --> 01:31:22,567
Hey, what is this?

1311
01:31:22,642 --> 01:31:26,635
- Where'd you get them clothes?
- Mr. Pulitzer picked them.

1312
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:31,047
- A special gift
to a special new employee.
- He sold us out.

1313
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,020
Look at him in his little suit.
Ya bum! I'll soak ya!

1314
01:31:35,088 --> 01:31:37,750
- Ya fink!
- Let me get my hands dirty.

1315
01:31:37,824 --> 01:31:41,419
Come here, you dirty,
rotten scabber!

1316
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:43,986
[Shouting]

1317
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:46,899
I'll murder ya!

1318
01:31:50,303 --> 01:31:53,363
Oh, you want to talk to him.
Come on, sure.

1319
01:31:58,845 --> 01:32:01,211
Go right ahead.

1320
01:32:07,454 --> 01:32:10,651
So this is why you
didn't escape last night.

1321
01:32:10,724 --> 01:32:14,524
- Yeah.
- You're a liar.

1322
01:32:14,594 --> 01:32:18,462
You lied about everything.

1323
01:32:18,532 --> 01:32:21,990
You lied about your father
being out west.

1324
01:32:22,068 --> 01:32:27,165
- You didn't even tell me your real name.
- So? What you want to do about it?

1325
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,299
I don't understand you.

1326
01:32:29,376 --> 01:32:32,812
So let me spell it out for ya.

1327
01:32:32,879 --> 01:32:37,441
You see, I ain't got nobody
tucking me in at night like you.

1328
01:32:37,517 --> 01:32:40,042
It's just me.
I gotta look out for myself.

1329
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:43,647
- You had the newsies!
- What'd being a newsie give me...

1330
01:32:43,723 --> 01:32:47,250
but a dime a day
and a few black eyes?

1331
01:32:47,327 --> 01:32:51,696
I can't afford to be a kid
no more, Dave.

1332
01:32:51,765 --> 01:32:56,759
For the first time in my life
I got money in my pockets. Real money!

1333
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:58,964
Money. You understand?

1334
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:02,202
I got more on the way and as soon
as I collect, I'm gone, all right?

1335
01:33:02,275 --> 01:33:05,802
That's good 'cause
we don't need you.

1336
01:33:05,879 --> 01:33:08,439
We don't need you!

1337
01:33:08,515 --> 01:33:11,075
All those words you said,
those were mine.

1338
01:33:11,151 --> 01:33:15,645
But you never had the guts
to put 'em across yourself.

1339
01:33:15,722 --> 01:33:18,020
I do now.

1340
01:33:33,073 --> 01:33:35,268
What's the matter?

1341
01:33:35,342 --> 01:33:37,503
Got a problem?

1342
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:42,810
Maybe, maybe you'd like
a new suit of your own, huh?

1343
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:45,943
- Never!
- Get outta here! Off with him.

1344
01:33:55,395 --> 01:33:57,363
You make me sick!

1345
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:59,455
- Look at yourself, huh?
- I trusted you.

1346
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:01,398
Seize the day, huh, Jack?

1347
01:34:01,468 --> 01:34:05,461
He's foolin' 'em
so he can spy on 'em or something.

1348
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:08,372
Yeah, that's it.
He's foolin' 'em.

1349
01:34:08,441 --> 01:34:11,205
Yeah, he's spyin'
on 'em, kid.

1350
01:34:22,355 --> 01:34:24,323
Les,

1351
01:34:24,391 --> 01:34:28,327
what is this?

1352
01:34:31,031 --> 01:34:33,659
I'm savin' it.

1353
01:34:36,903 --> 01:34:38,928
David,

1354
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,036
it's Denton's article.

1355
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:46,636
"The Dark Truth,
Why Our City Really Fears
The Newsies' Strike...

1356
01:34:46,713 --> 01:34:48,681
"by Bryan Denton.

1357
01:34:48,748 --> 01:34:51,911
"Last night I saw naked force
exercised against mere boys,

1358
01:34:51,985 --> 01:34:55,477
the newsies, who were the..."

1359
01:35:07,834 --> 01:35:11,463
One trick, Cowboy,
and it's right back to the refuge.

1360
01:35:11,538 --> 01:35:13,472
Please.

1361
01:35:25,518 --> 01:35:29,852
Ah, you gonna be requiring
anything else this evening?

1362
01:35:29,923 --> 01:35:33,620
No? Ah, tsk, tsk.

1363
01:35:33,693 --> 01:35:37,459
Well then, I oughta
be saying good night.

1364
01:35:38,898 --> 01:35:43,631
Remember... one trick
and I go straight to Mr. Pulitzer.

1365
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:55,807
[Weasel]
Move along, gentlemen, move along.

1366
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:58,009
20 papes. Next.

1367
01:35:58,084 --> 01:36:00,746
- 20 papes, please.
- Next.

1368
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,720
- 30 papes, please.
- Yes, sir.

1369
01:36:02,789 --> 01:36:05,349
30 papes. Next.

1370
01:36:05,425 --> 01:36:08,292
- I'll take, uh, 50.
- 50 papes!

1371
01:36:08,361 --> 01:36:11,762
50 papes. Next.

1372
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:19,330
Sleep well, Cowboy?

1373
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:24,309
Come with us, Cowboy.
We're gonna go fix your pal Davey.

1374
01:36:24,377 --> 01:36:27,744
- Fix him so he can't walk.
- Shut up!

1375
01:36:27,814 --> 01:36:32,478
Uh-uh. Lift one finger,
it's back to the refuge.

1376
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:39,625
Next!

1377
01:36:39,693 --> 01:36:42,389
50.

1378
01:36:46,832 --> 01:36:49,300
- Good mornin'.
- Good mornin' to ya.

1379
01:36:52,103 --> 01:36:54,094
'Scuse me, sweet face.

1380
01:37:00,979 --> 01:37:03,413
- How's your little brother, tootsie?
- [Laughing]

1381
01:37:03,482 --> 01:37:05,473
Where's the little Davey?

1382
01:37:08,653 --> 01:37:11,087
Leave my sister alone!

1383
01:37:15,894 --> 01:37:19,591
[Sarah]
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1384
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:28,330
You stupid ape.

1385
01:37:30,542 --> 01:37:32,134
No!

1386
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:34,678
- What happened? Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

1387
01:37:34,746 --> 01:37:37,408
- Help Sarah.
- [Sarah] Run, Davey!

1388
01:37:37,482 --> 01:37:39,416
Oh, yeah, run, Davey.

1389
01:37:39,484 --> 01:37:43,545
We got the best part
of your family right here.

1390
01:37:43,622 --> 01:37:47,149
Let go of me!
Stop it!

1391
01:37:47,225 --> 01:37:50,388
- Get up!
- [Sarah] Les!

1392
01:37:50,462 --> 01:37:54,057
Stop, you're hurting him.
No! Leave him alone!

1393
01:38:04,442 --> 01:38:06,433
[Sarah]
Stop it!

1394
01:38:06,511 --> 01:38:09,742
Leave him alone!

1395
01:38:27,499 --> 01:38:29,729
Get over here!

1396
01:38:30,802 --> 01:38:34,238
Remember Crutchy?

1397
01:38:34,306 --> 01:38:37,901
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1398
01:38:39,244 --> 01:38:41,235
David?

1399
01:38:43,281 --> 01:38:46,307
You better run, Cowboy.
We're gonna tell Uncle Weas.

1400
01:38:46,384 --> 01:38:50,844
- You'll be back in the
refuge by supper time.
- Run, ya lousy coward.

1401
01:38:50,922 --> 01:38:54,551
[Les] Run, get outta here!
Don't come back.

1402
01:38:56,061 --> 01:38:59,553
What? You couldn't stay away?

1403
01:38:59,631 --> 01:39:02,293
Well, I guess I can't
be something I ain't.

1404
01:39:02,367 --> 01:39:04,335
A scab?

1405
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:06,336
No, smart.

1406
01:39:10,342 --> 01:39:12,469
Did you mean
what you wrote here?

1407
01:39:12,544 --> 01:39:15,479
About all these sweatshop
kids listening to me?

1408
01:39:15,547 --> 01:39:18,448
I don't write anything
I don't mean.

1409
01:39:18,516 --> 01:39:22,509
Well, come on in.
I was just packing a few things.

1410
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:34,391
So, yes, I meant it.

1411
01:39:34,466 --> 01:39:37,833
The city thrives
on child labor.

1412
01:39:37,902 --> 01:39:39,927
A lot of people
make money that way.

1413
01:39:40,005 --> 01:39:42,838
They're terrified that
the newsies strike will spread.

1414
01:39:42,907 --> 01:39:45,171
There's not much chance
of that...

1415
01:39:45,243 --> 01:39:47,734
as long as
they got the power.

1416
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:52,709
Sometimes all it takes
is a voice.

1417
01:39:52,784 --> 01:39:55,844
One voice
that becomes a hundred,

1418
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,480
and then a thousand...

1419
01:39:58,556 --> 01:40:00,319
unless it's silenced.

1420
01:40:04,062 --> 01:40:06,292
Why can't we spread
the strike?

1421
01:40:06,364 --> 01:40:10,164
Have another big rally and get
the word out to all the sweatshop kids?

1422
01:40:10,235 --> 01:40:13,466
- Why not?
- What are we gonna do?
Put an ad in the paper?

1423
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:16,871
We'll do better than that.
We'll make our own paper.

1424
01:40:16,941 --> 01:40:19,967
We tell 'em they gotta join us.
Isn't that a good idea?

1425
01:40:20,045 --> 01:40:25,142
Yeah, it is. But what do we know
about printing a newspaper?

1426
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:29,152
- Nothing, but our man, Denton...
- But I think our man, Denton,

1427
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:33,020
has something more
important to do.

1428
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:37,255
I mean, he's gonna be
an ace war correspondent.

1429
01:40:37,328 --> 01:40:39,660
Right, Denton?

1430
01:40:44,235 --> 01:40:46,294
All right.

1431
01:40:46,371 --> 01:40:48,703
[Denton]
Where do we start?

1432
01:40:48,773 --> 01:40:51,333
We gotta move fast.

1433
01:40:51,409 --> 01:40:54,173
We're gonna need
the newsies to circulate.

1434
01:40:54,245 --> 01:40:56,406
[Denton]
We need a printing press.

1435
01:40:56,481 --> 01:41:00,417
So happens I know a guy
with a printing press.

1436
01:41:04,189 --> 01:41:07,522
- You've been living here?
- Shh! They're above us.

1437
01:41:07,592 --> 01:41:11,153
If weasel catches us,
we're all in the slam.

1438
01:41:24,275 --> 01:41:28,371
All right!
A platen press!

1439
01:41:28,446 --> 01:41:31,506
Looks like old man Pulitzer
never threw anything away.

1440
01:41:31,583 --> 01:41:36,247
- Will this thing work?
- It better. We have a deadline.

1441
01:41:36,321 --> 01:41:38,312
[Music] This is the story
you wanted to write [music]

1442
01:41:38,389 --> 01:41:41,119
[Music] Well tonight is a night
that you can [music]

1443
01:41:41,192 --> 01:41:43,490
[Music]Just get this done
and by dawn's early light [music]

1444
01:41:43,561 --> 01:41:46,621
[Music] You can finish the fight
you began [music]

1445
01:41:46,698 --> 01:41:49,098
[Music] This time we're in it
to stay [music]

1446
01:41:49,167 --> 01:41:51,795
[Music] Think about
seizing the day [music]

1447
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:55,772
[Music] Think of that train as
she rolls into old Santa Fe [music]

1448
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,740
[Music] Tell 'em I'm on my way [music]

1449
01:41:57,809 --> 01:42:02,644
[Music]See ol'man Pulitzer
snug in his bed he don't
care if we're dead or alive [music]

1450
01:42:02,714 --> 01:42:04,807
[Music] Three satin pillows
are under his head [music]

1451
01:42:04,883 --> 01:42:07,977
[Music] While we're begging
for bread to survive [music]

1452
01:42:08,052 --> 01:42:10,680
[Music]Joe, if you're still
countin'sheep [music]

1453
01:42:10,755 --> 01:42:13,383
[Music] Wake up and read 'em
and weep [music]

1454
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,551
[Music] You got your thugs with
their sticks and the slugs [music]

1455
01:42:15,627 --> 01:42:18,892
[Music] Yeah, but we got
a promise to keep [music]

1456
01:42:18,963 --> 01:42:24,026
[Music] Once and for all something
tells me the tide'll be turnin'[music]

1457
01:42:24,102 --> 01:42:26,434
[Music] Once and for all
there's a fire inside me [music]

1458
01:42:26,504 --> 01:42:29,667
[Music] That won't stop burning [music]

1459
01:42:29,741 --> 01:42:32,039
[Music]Now that the choices
are clear [music]

It's nice of Mr. Pulitzer
to let us use his press.

1463
01:42:43,254 --> 01:42:45,950

01:44:00,498 --> 01:44:03,296
I thought you'd feel
this way, Governor.

1481
01:44:03,368 --> 01:44:08,738
And I did nothing...

1482
01:44:08,806 --> 01:44:11,036
until now.

1483
01:44:11,109 --> 01:44:14,772
Good, very good, sir.

1484
01:44:20,785 --> 01:44:23,879
So when's the others

Strike! Strike!

01:46:30,681 --> 01:46:33,115
It's awful, everyone's calling.
Mr. Hearst, Mr. Benton...

1509
01:46:33,184 --> 01:46:35,175
and the mayor,
and such awful language.

1510
01:46:35,253 --> 01:46:37,221
The city's at a standstill
and they all blame the chief.

1511
01:46:37,288 --> 01:46:41,850
It's like the end of the world.
Oh, dear, I didn't say that.

1512
01:46:49,767 --> 01:46:51,860
Extry! Extry! Joe!

1513
01:46:55,406 --> 01:46:57,874
Read all about it.

1514
01:47:06,617 --> 01:47:12,180
I promised that if you defied me,
I would break you.

1515
01:47:14,358 --> 01:47:16,588
I'll keep that promise, boy.

1516
01:47:16,661 --> 01:47:20,529
I gave you the chance to be free.
I don't understand.

1517
01:47:20,598 --> 01:47:24,762
Anyone who doesn't act
in his own self-interest...

1518
01:47:24,836 --> 01:47:27,566
is a fool.

1519
01:47:27,638 --> 01:47:31,096
- What does that make you?
- What?

1520
01:47:31,175 --> 01:47:34,508
This is my pal, David,

1521
01:47:34,579 --> 01:47:36,513
the walking mouth.

1522
01:47:36,581 --> 01:47:38,742
You talk about self-interest,
but since the strike...

1523
01:47:38,816 --> 01:47:41,546
your circulation
has been down 70%.

1524
01:47:41,619 --> 01:47:43,519
Every day you're losing
thousands of dollars...

1525
01:47:43,588 --> 01:47:46,056
just to beat us out of
one lousy tenth of a cent.

1526
01:47:46,124 --> 01:47:49,821
Why?

1527
01:47:49,894 --> 01:47:51,862
[Jack]
It ain't about the money, Dave.

1528
01:47:51,929 --> 01:47:56,559
If Joe gives in
to nobodies like us,

1529
01:47:56,634 --> 01:47:59,000
that means
we got the power.

1530
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:03,530
He can't do that no matter
what it costs. Am I right, Joe?

1531
01:48:03,608 --> 01:48:06,805
I sent for the police.
They must be here by now.

1532
01:48:06,878 --> 01:48:10,143
Send 'em in, Seitz.
Send 'em in.

1533
01:48:11,282 --> 01:48:14,012
I'm not goin' back
to jail, Joe.

1534

Look at here. Right out here
is right where your power ends!

[Pulitzer] Shut the windows!
Close the windows!

1536
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:23,454
Stop that infernal noise!
Go home!

1537
01:48:23,528 --> 01:48:26,656

Go home to your mothers and fathers!

1539
01:48:28,933 --> 01:48:31,697
- Go home! You listen to me!
- I can't hear ya!

1540
01:48:31,769 --> 01:48:35,364
- Maybe you should listen
to me for a change.
- No, you listen to me!

1541
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:38,704
- No, you should listen!
- Shut the window and shut up!

1542
01:48:38,776 --> 01:48:42,507
There's a lot of people out there!
They ain't gonna go away!

1543
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:44,605
They got voices now
and they're gonna be listened to.

1544
01:48:44,682 --> 01:48:46,980
Putting me in jail
is not gonna stop them.

1545
01:48:47,051 --> 01:48:50,646
That's the power
of the press, Joe.

Those kids put out
a pretty good paper, Chief.

1549
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:08,968
[Pulitzer] I ordered
a printing ban on all strike matters.

1550
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,372
Now who defied it?

1551
01:49:11,442 --> 01:49:15,742
Whose press did you use
to print this? Whose?

1552
01:49:17,782 --> 01:49:21,513
Well, we only used
the best, Joe.

1553
01:49:21,586 --> 01:49:24,020
So I just wanna say,

1554
01:49:24,088 --> 01:49:26,022
thanks again.

I told ya, Mr. Snyder.

The first thing you do in jail,
make friends with the rats.

1571

you got in common.

The governor's very grateful you brought
this problem to his attention.

I said you might need a lift somewhere.
