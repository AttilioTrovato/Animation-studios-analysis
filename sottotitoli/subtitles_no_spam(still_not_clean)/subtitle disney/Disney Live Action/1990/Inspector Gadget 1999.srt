See you at
the P.T.A. meeting.

13
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,966
Good morning, Officer Brown.
Morning.

14
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,708
Officer Brown!
How do you do? Morning.

15
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,333
No brakes!

16
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,300
Help, Uncle John!

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,000
Somebody help!
Save us!

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,583
Help!

19
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,417

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,458
Help!

00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,792
Hey, the dog!
The dog!

22
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,625
Oh, Harvey!

23
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,383
Officer Brown,
you're my hero.

24
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,258
Oh, please, Miss.
It was nothing. Oh, geez

25
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,834
All in a day's work, ma'am.
Any cop woulda done the same.

26
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,917
Brain? Yech.

27
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,816
Having another hero cop dream,
Uncle John?

28
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,166
Every time I close my eyes.
How was school?

29
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,925
Fine.

30
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,959
Don't forget, tomorrow's the day parents
come and talk about their careers.

31
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,333
Oh. Well, I might
have to work.

32
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,250
Do you want me to ask off?

33
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,342
Oh, no.
That's okay.

34
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,800
Parents coming to school
Whose idea was that anyway?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,792
But if it's important to you, Penny...
Did the letter come?

36
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:27,125
Letter?
Uh, gee, well What letter?

37
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,550
I don't... Oh, yes.

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,375
They said two years as a security guard
isn't enough experience to be a cop.

39
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:37,883
Uncle John, I'm sorry.
Me too.

40
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,841
Well, I can still
secure and protect.

41
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,125
I just think I could do
so much more good as a cop.

42
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45,542
Hey, wait a minute.
Tomorrow's your day off.

43
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,300
Oh, well...

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,667
Look, I know that
Nicole's dad is a lawyer,

45
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,217
and Kim's dad is a dentist,

46
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:56,667
and I just didn't want to
embarrass you with your friends.

47
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:57,800
If I only had that badge.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,041
Uncle John, it's not the badge,
it's the heart behind it.

49
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,708
I'm very proud of you.

50
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,133
Fingers crossed.

51
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,625
This chip is gonna make
the whole Gadget project work.

52
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:19,375
Dad, concentrate.
Try to move the foot.

53
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,125
All right.
Kick the ball.

54
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,508
Nothin'.
I'm hungry.

55
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,125
Okay, all right. I'll go get us some dinner.
But then we keep going.

56
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:30,175
Yeah. Okay.
I'll call the guardhouse

57
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,175
so they don't search
the deliver guy again.

58
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:39,041
Hello, Antonio's? Yeah, it's Brenda.
No, foot's still not moving.

59
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:41,270
Dad, keep thinking
about that foot.

60
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,500
Yep, the usual.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

61
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,208
Dad.
Hmm? What?

62
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,959
Tap your foot again.

63
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,917
What?
Huh.

64
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,550
That's weird.

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,800
Wh... What were you
thinking about?

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,458
I was thinking about how much
you remind me of your mother.

67
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,254
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

68
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,417
That's it!
It's animated by will,

69
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:32,925
not by thought.

70
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,508
By your heart,
not your head!

71
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,166
Come on, try it again.
Do it again! All right.

72
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:49,417
We did it!
We moved the foot!

73
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,966

to myself.

Thelma, how do I look?

79
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,166
Like a geek from Kansas
who became a security guard.

00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,708
Brenda Bradford.

81
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,900
Well, good evening,
young lady.

82
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,925

Go.

85
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,458
Dr. Bradford.
Yes?

86
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,291
Hi.
Hi.

87
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,983
I borrowed a book from your dad.
You did?

88
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,574
Power Learning Through Speed Study.
Oh.

89
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:58,166
It took me forever
to get through it.

90
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,837
But I really think
it's gonna pay off, though.

91
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:05,960
I just applied
to the Riverton Police Force.

92
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,083
Yeah?
It's what I've always wanted to do.

93
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:15,091
Help people, that is.
Um, I gotta...

94
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,583
Dr. Bradford is out
of the lab and we can go in.

96
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,166
Nice stars.

97
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,417
Yeah? Which ones?

98
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,792
I just meant the whole...

99
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,250
All of 'em.
Oh, I thought you meant a specific cluster.

100
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,792
I always take everything
so literally.

101
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,792
So do I.
Yeah?

102
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,295
I forgot my keys.

103
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,133
Oh.

104
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,759
I'm Okay.
Sorry.

105
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,175
Good night now.
Nite.

106
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:07,333
well, I'll just stay here, then,
and, uh, secure the parking lot.

Concentrate, you twit!

108
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,675
Hey, that guy's speeding.

109
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,425
Ten miles an hour
in the parking lot, buddy!

110
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,500
No,no,no,no, straight ahead!
No, left! Bad cat. Bad cat.

111
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,333
Left, Sikes, turn!

112
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,000
What was that?
We have an intruder on the premises.

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,217
A black van.

114
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,333
Where?
Try that big hole in the wall!

Hello, Artemus.
I'll take that.

118
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:54,258
Oh, no, wait.
No, no, no, no!

119
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,708
Now, just a moment...
Arrivederci, Professor.

120
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,083
Uh-oh!
Someone's gonna blame the old lady.

121
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,208
Sniffy, let's go.

122
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:30,708
Dr. Bradford, I won't rest until
I find whoever's responsible.

123
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,208
Justice will be served.

124
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,717
Brown, where are you going?

125
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:44,333
To catch the bad guys!
Stand back, Thelma!

126
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,250
This isn't going to end well.

You're not on duty, Brown!
I'm always on duty!

Oh, no.

Oh.

Did you know him?

No, I didn't.

172
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,675
So, how soon can you finish
the Gadget Project, hmm?

173
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,083
I'm sure that he would have wanted
me to finish it as soon as possible.

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,867
So, how can you be so sure that
this is the proper subject?

178
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,834
Dad told me that I would know
when the right man came along.

179
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,667
John Brown's the right man.

180
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,383
Well.
Well.

181
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,417
That's good enough
for me.

182
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,125
Let's go.

183
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:00,634
Hmm.

184
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:04,208
Chain saw! Waxy buildup, stat.
Bring in the hoses, stat!

185
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,125
Ready, and...
Break!

186
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,258
It's a thing of beauty,
Quimby.

187
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,667
The future of law enforcement
reborn before our very eyes.

188
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:29,166
Yeah. Columbo and Nintendo
all rolled into one.

189
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,550
He'll make you obsolete,

190
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,550
no overtime, no hazard pay,
no blue flu.

191
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,634
And he won't call me
"evil gidget" behind my back.

192
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:44,208
Oh, by the way, what do we have on
the Artemus Bradford murder, hmm?

193
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,966
Well, we got a limo
with no license,

194
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,625
and some scrap metal from whatever
it was that broke into the lab.

195
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,383
Do we at least know
what was stolen?

196
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,500
According, to Doctor Bradford,
a robotic foot.

197
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:54,883
Robotic foot.

198
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,467
A robotic foot?
Yeah.

199
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,834
What kind of cyber-freak
are we dealing with?

200
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,542
Not bad, Kramer.

201
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,675
Not bad at all.

202
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,875
It's got a sort of postmodern
Captain Hook kind of feel to it.

203
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,675
Very diabolical.

204
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,759
I deserve
a dashing appellation.

205
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,625
"Dashing Appalachian"? What is that?
A hillbilly with a tuxedo?

206
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,383
No, you idiot!
No!

207
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,050
It's a nickname

208
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,792
One that will send my
enemies cowering in fear.

209
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,834
Ah.

210
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,712
Ah, too bad
"Hook" is taken, huh?

211
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:45,050
How 'bout... "Captain Claw"?
Oh.

212
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,333
No, no, no, no, no...
Or "Santa Claw."

213
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,792
Just "Claw."
One word,

214
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,091
like "Madonna."

215
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,883
Well, anyhoo, Captain...
Sir... Mr. Claw,

216
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,667
I know how much you like to
maintain an active lifestyle,

217
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,437
so I have managed to design

218
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:07,008
a few interchangeable options.

219
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,441
Hi, hi.
Oh, very clever, Kramer.

220
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,675
"Very clever, Kramer."

221
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,792
Very clever, indeed.

222
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:19,625
Well, first we have
the opera hand,

223
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,041
for those special nights out.

224
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,625
And I know how much
you enjoy Japanese food,

225
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,458
so I made you a sushi hand
See there?

226
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,479
Tasty.

227
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,300
Hmm.

228
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,166
Also, I don't remember if you
enjoy the medieval fare, but...

229
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,291
Kramer, that's enough.

230
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,462
Sikes, bring on the foot.

231
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:44,750
Oops.

232
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,375
Hmm?

233
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,875
What the...

234
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,875
What have they got me on?
Ooh! Ooh!

235
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,500
Oh, my Oh!
Ooh!

236
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,342
I, um...
Your thumb's on fire!

237
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,708
I seem to be having
a reaction.

238
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,834
Mr. Brown.
Oh. Oh, it's you.

239
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,759
It's all right.
It's all right.

240
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,550
Um, I, uh...

241
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,917
I don't know what's wrong.
I, uh I seem to be ill,

242
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:19,675
and I can't remember anything.

243
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,675
You may not remember
very much right now.

244
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,667
You suffered a pretty major
concussion in the explosion.

245
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,342
What happened?

246
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,383
You've just come out of
a very long recovery.

247
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:33,000
You are now a sophisticated network
of tissue, hardware and software.

248
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,383
No!

249
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,250
I gotta get outta here.

250
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,750
Mr. Brown...
Mr. Brown, come back here.

251
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,834
We're gonna go in
I'll take...

252
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,291
Look, Mr. Brown, I know
that this is all new for you,

253
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:53,925
and it must feel strange.

254
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,883
You will adjust.

255
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,750
My head is very heavy.
Don't worry. That's easy to fix.

256
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,333
I don't
wanna be like this.

257
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,625
I don't understand
what happened to me.

258
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,425
John, we saved your life.

259
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,959
I'm not me anymore.
I'm a hardware store.

260
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,258
This is a huge opportunity.

261
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,467
You were designed
as the first prototype

262
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,966
cyber police officer for the
Riverton Police Department.

263
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,333
You said yourself you wanted to
help people This is your chance.

264
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,041
I do want to help people.

265
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:33,333
I know.

266
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:37,300
Aiyee!
Oh!

267
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,467
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

268
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,592
Okay. I'd shake your hand
but you might lose an eye.

269
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:48,291
An android of this quality
could have a myriad of uses:

270
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,728
shock troops,
kamikaze pilots, hit men.

271
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:54,966
International rescue workers,
teachers.

272
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,708
Oh, yes. I was getting to them.
Well, let's see him in action, huh?

273
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:00,875
Okay.

274
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Oh, I'll strap myself in.

275
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,708
Okay.
Turn me on, Kramer.

276
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,774
Move, darn you!
Move!

277
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,708
It's a lemon.

278
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,750
Thank you for that, Sikes.

279
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,592
You put it on. Come on.
Why can't he do it?

280
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,166
He's capable of intelligent thought.
That's useful to me.

281
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:43,800
Now, strap you in.

282
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,125
Perhaps if we give
him maximum voltage.

283
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:49,875
Yeah, that might work.

284
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,750
I want my...

285
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,917
Mama!

286
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,717
Something got left behind.

287
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,467
What does Brenda have
that I don't?

288
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:17,083
Now this is the single most important
component, the neuron synapse amplifier.

289
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:19,133
It's a highpowered
processor chip...

290
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,883
That increases the charge
in the human brain wave,

291
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,066
enough to move the machinery
that's now built into your body.

292
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:30,250
Without this chip The most powerful
robotics chip in the world

293
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,875
Your body couldn't
possibly function.

294
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,583
Any more questions?

295
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,091
Nope, I'm fine.

296
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,566
Guess it just takes a little getting used to,
you know?

297
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,041
Good. Then I will just give
you your manual to study.

298
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,542
Volume one.

299
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,792
Mmm-hmm.
Looks like the usual stuff,

300
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,166
extendolegs,
helicopter hat.

301
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:12,091
Guess I'm all set then.
Right. Oh!

302
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,667
There's one more thing.
I almost forgot.

303
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,875
It's important.

304
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,834
Your new wardrobe.

305
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,458
The Gadget suit.

306
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,800
Okay, so if you want to
operate one of your gadgets,

307
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you simply say "Go-go gadget,"
and then you name the device.

308
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,834
Well, couldn't I say something more official,
like...

309
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,300
Like,
"In the name of justice."

310
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,291
Well, you could,
but it wouldn't work.

311
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:54,050
But "Go-go gadget,"
sounds so

312
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,275
My father designed
the program, and he...

313
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,500
Oh! Oh, oh, oh,oh!
It's "Go-go gadget."

314
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,291
I really like it.
Okay.

315
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,133
Good. I'm glad.

316
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:10,250
So, okay, let's say there are two
guys trying to rob a jewelry store,

317
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,708
and you wanted to trip
'em up What would you do?

318
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,792
Okay, uh, let me think.

319
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,417
Go-go gadget
oil slick.

320
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,959
That's not oil,
it's toothpaste!

321
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,550
Ooh! Ooh!

322
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,166
Stop it!

323
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,217
Whoa!
Say, "Go-go gadget, stop"!

324
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:51,000
Go-go, stop!
We're gonna need some more work with you.

325
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,625
Try to visualize your goal.

326
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,550
Concentrate.

327
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,583
Put all other things
out of your head except

328
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:08,458
obtaining the balls.

329
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:11,959
Okay.

330
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,625
He's just like
the, "Six Million Dollar Man."

331
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:31,625
What?

332
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:36,258
Ungrip! Ungrip!
Turn it off!

333
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:40,083
Well, I guess $6,000,000
doesn't buy what it used to.

334
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:42,425
Excuse me.

335
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:46,083
He is not a man, you know.
He is a monster.

336
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:52,542
I've got something special
to show you. Ta-da!

337
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,291
The Gadgetmobile.

338
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:56,959
Wow.
It's for you.

339
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,133
I made it myself.

340
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,175
Come on.
You made me a car?

341
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,708
The only thing anybody's ever
made me before is a sweater.

342
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:08,759
All right.
Now, it may look simple,

343
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:12,291
but this thing has just about as
many factory extras as you do.

344
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,400
Come on!
Get in there!

345
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,834
Oh.
Watch the coat.

346
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,166
Okay.

347
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,483
Gosh, she's incredible.

348
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:28,291
Oh, it's a he.
excuse me?

349
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:29,300
You'll see.

350
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,133
Okay, now, it has voice activation,
ejection seats,

351
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:36,625
a power-assisted metamorphic camouflage
system, a cardio-homing device.

352
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:39,008
then there's a periscope,
a candy...

353
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,625
Dr. Bradford,
there's something I just have to ask you.

354
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:45,542
Oh, just say,
"Go-go Gadgetmobile."

355
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:46,958
Yes, but will you...

356
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:48,562
"Go-go Gadgetmobile?"

357
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:49,966
Good morning, Riverton!

358
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:54,175
Hey! Who's in the car?
I work alone.

359
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,583
Hey, before we hit the road,
I gotta tell you somethin'.

360
00:25:57,783 --> 00:25:58,717
Duck!

361
00:25:58,917 --> 00:25:59,841
I don't think
the car likes me.

362
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:03,500
Who you callin' "car"?
I'm a crimefighting machine.

363
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,759
Watch this. Left turn!

364
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,834
Haven't you fallen out yet?

365
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,675
No, sir, I haven't!

366
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:13,500
Who are you, rookie?
I'm Officer John Brown,

367
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,208
and you're exceeding
the speed limit.

368
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:22,208
Speed limits are for cars,
not the Gadgetmobile.

369
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:23,759
Are you...
Are you talking to me?

370
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,458
Speakin' of the law, who's
not wearing a seat belt?

371
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:28,883
Gotta wear the belt, baby!
Hey!

372
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:34,458
It's a Disney movie.
Now, I'm gonna fight me some crime. Whoo!

373
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:36,759
More left turns!

374
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:40,291
Could you slow down, please?
I... I get carsick.

375
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:41,717
You know what makes
me peoplesick?

376
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:44,342
A rookie thinkin'
he's good enough for Dr. B.

377
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:47,625
Not that it's your business,
but what makes you think I was

378
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,091
putting moves
on Dr. Bradford?

379
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,417
Hey, I've got heat sensors.
I know what you were thinkin'

380
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:53,841
when Dr. B. gave
you that smile.

381
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:57,712
Now, look here. Come clean with me,
or I'm gonna bounce you right outta here.

382
00:26:57,912 --> 00:27:01,583
I can assure you my only interest
in Dr. Bradford is professional.

383
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:05,717
"Professional," huh?

384
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:09,525
Well, good.
Keep it that way, and that's an order.

385
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:12,887
You got it?
Uh, I'm the inspector, you're the car.

386
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:15,818
I'll tell you what you are.
You're the...

387
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:18,750
Don't make me go,
"De La Hoya" on you!

388
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,625
Isn't there an "off" button
or something? A "mute"?

389
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,091
Oh!
Sorry, sir!

390
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:28,625
Don't push my buttons
without readin' the manual!

391
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,854
Ooh, watch out there, now.

392
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:32,883
Whoa!

393
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:37,634
Hmm? Aw, man.
I got a june bug in my grille.

394
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,796
Shouldn't we be working
together, helping people?

395
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:43,759
Why didn't you say so?

396
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:47,467
Yo, Clouseau, 9 o'clock.

397
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,467
Left, you idiot!
Over the lock!

398
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,417
Shut up and let me do it.
Please. Thank you.

399
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:54,291
Very observant,
Gadgetmobile.

400
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,542
Time to do some good.

401
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,708
Lost your keys, fellas?

402
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,296
Uh, keys Yeah, keys.

403
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:05,925
Allow me to help.

404
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:09,166
Ugh. Say,
"Bye bye" to the rookie.

405
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,166
Here.
This ought to do it.

406
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,091
Oh. Thanks.

407
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:17,675
Yo! Check out
the bowling shirt!

408
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,300
Huh. I'm a bowler myself.
You work at the prison?

409
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,300
Uh, yeah. Work at the prison.
Psst! Gadget!

410
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,333
I'll be getting into the law
enforcement bowling league too.

411
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,508
There you are. Drive carefully.
We'll see you.

412
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,333
That's it. I can't take it anymore.
Step away from the Viper!

413
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,508
Hey, what's the big idea?

414
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,508
Open your eyes! we got
a couple of jailbreakers!

415
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:41,041
Well, then, we should inform the
prison guar... Wait a minute!

416
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:43,917
Let's split up.
I'll go after 'em, and you say, "10-4"

417
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:46,458
10-4!

418
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,500
Go-go gadget coils!

419
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,342
Skates!
I meant skates!

420
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,233
Come here, Carl Lewis.

421
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,925
Uh, halt! Forward!

422
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:01,834
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Go-go forward, please!

423
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,875
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Halt!

424
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,175
Hello.
Sit back and enjoy the bars.

425
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,583
You'll be lookin' at 'em
for the next 20 years.

426
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:16,333
oh! Ooh!

427
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,175
Uh-oh. Oh, gosh!
Ooh!

428
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,375
Go-go gadget
Grappling hook!

429
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,959
Whoa!

430
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,959
Wowser!

431
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,750
The Riverton Police Department
has a new cop on the beat.

432
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,175
Here's Tira with the story.

433
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,966
In an incredible display
of courage,

434
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,649
Riverton's first cyber-crimefighter
heroically apprehended,

435
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:58,133
two escaped convicts this
afternoon in the downtown area.

436
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:02,333
The soon to be inspector will be inducted
into the Riverton Police Department,

437
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,091
at a gala event
tomorrow night

438
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:07,208
Why, it's that annoying little
security guard from the institute.

439
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:09,133
...Riverton's much admired
budget surplus to fund

440
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:14,000
So he's the lucky duck they
plucked for the Gadget Program.

441
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,759
Ha! Irony abounds.

442
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:18,542
That's my cruller!
Gimme that!

443
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,592
Sikes!
Yes, boss?

444
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:29,458
Get my tuxedo ready.
Tomorrow promises to be quite an evening.

445
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,566
So, anyone special
going tonight?

446
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:38,333
Well, the mayor,
the governor.

447
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,759
Any doctors?

448
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:44,462
Doctors?
You know, female doctors

449
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:48,166
Very attractive
female doctors.

450
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,083
Wowser.

451
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:04,966
Is it that obvious?

452
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,175
Come on, Uncle John.

453
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,834
You just need to...
Loosen up, be cool.

454
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,771
You been talking to my car?
What?

455
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,708
Huh. You'll see.

456
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,375
Fire!

457
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,750
Wrong finger.

458
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,250
Careful.

459
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:40,208
Excuse me. Inspector,
may I have this dance?

460
00:31:40,408 --> 00:31:43,333
Oh. Why, sure.
Yeah. You betcha.

461
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,166
Uh, here.

462
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,708
Let's see if I still
know how to do this.

463
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,250
Not bad, John Brown.

464
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,091
May I cut in?

465
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,583
Hello. Sanford Scolex.
We were at Harvard together.

466
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:16,166
We were? Oh, you don't recognize me.
That's because I've changed.

467
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,550
I was obese.

468
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,917
Maybe you remember me better
like this.

469
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:25,041
Yes!

470
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,250
Wow!

471
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,208
Well, it's nice
to see you again.

472
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,041
Here you go.
You look...

473
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,208
Different.

474
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,342
Well, I'll go get us
some champagne.

475
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:47,542
Oh, great idea!
Three flutes of bubbly, please, Mr. Gizmo.

476
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:49,083
We'll be right here.

477
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,091
You know, Brenda...

478
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,917
I'm not at all surprised you
became such a renowned scientist.

479
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:02,333
You were always the most
brilliant one in school.

480
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,383
No, I...

481
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,400
I was a hard worker.

482
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,217
Oh, I remember.

483
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:12,542
I used to watch the way you wrinkled your
little nose, concentrating on calculations.

484
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,625
You did? Mmm.
You took my breath away.

485
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,634
I did.

486
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:19,925
Brenda, dance with me.

487
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,750
You remind me of a thing
Godzilla once said.

488
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:31,500
Tell me, what will you do now that
the Gadget Program is completed?

489
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,500
Ooh. Oh.
Huh?

490
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:39,004
You're done with
the Gadget thing.

491
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:41,592
Come and join me
at Scolex Industries.

492
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:44,959
We'll be right here.

493
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,000
Ahem.

494
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,375
I could only carry
two glasses.

495
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,333
Oh.

496
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,458
A bientot, ma cherie

497
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,083
Ah!

498
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,300
John...

499
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,425
He just offered me a job.

500
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:14,542
He said that I would have
unlimited funding,

501
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:16,175
my own lab...

502
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:20,458
And complete control
of all my research.

503
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,542
But what about
your other research?

504
00:34:22,742 --> 00:34:23,383
The Gadget Program.

505
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:26,333
Are you sure you've
worked out all the bugs?

506
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,925
Well, um...

507
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,708
Oh, how touching.
The creator and the creation.

508
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,050
Excuse me, Inspector,

509
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,708
but the press would like to take some
photos of us with our boys in blue.

510
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:41,375
Let's go.
photo op.

511
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,217
Okay. Come on.

512
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,917
get ready, boys. Here's the dynamic duo.
The camera is your friend.

513
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,129
Watch the birdie!
Get a big smile!

514
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:53,585
Chief, if you don't mind
my asking,

515
00:34:53,785 --> 00:34:55,626
when do I get started
on my big case?

516
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,467
Oh, soon enough, Gadget.

517
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:01,921
I have a few assignments for
you to cut your teeth on first.

518
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:06,375
Big grin. That's it.
Inspector! Over here, please!

519
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:23,792
I've got to talk to the chief.
The trouble is he's not taking me seriously.

520
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:26,550
Oh, boo-hoo hoo, rookie.

521
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,083
Nobody likes a whiner.
Now, what are you gonna do about it?

522
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:32,125
I'm ready to get tough
Real tough.

523
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,008
Here comes Gadget.

524
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,634
Hey, that your new partner,
Gadget?

525
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:41,583
What you got, a cat burglar?
A real felon, huh?

526
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:43,091
the city's safe now.

527
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,875
Cat got your tongue?

528
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:52,091
Inspector Gadget reporting,
sir, with the 13th...

529
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,792
That's a baker's dozen...
Kitten I've pulled out of a tree this week.

530
00:35:54,992 --> 00:35:57,342
So?

531
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,792
Permission to speak freely, sir.
No.

532
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,417
Well, if you're gonna pout.

533
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,542
Thank you, sir.

534
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,383
What I want to say is that,

535
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,550
while I appreciate cute and fluffy
as much as the next officer,

536
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,625
I fear that the kitten rescue patrol
is a misuse of my capabilities.

537
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,841
Huh.

538
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,091
You know, I don't get it, Gadget.
Every time you

539
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:26,250
I won't be happy until I've brought the
murderers of Artemus Bradford to justice.

540
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,800
Ah.

541
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,217
And I won't be happy
until you're off the force,

542
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:36,333
and being sold, piece by piece,
at some garage sale.

543
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,008
I want that case, sir.

544
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,917
Well, I'll tell you, the problem is the
Bradford case requires real police work

545
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,966
and the fact is, you're not
a real police inspector.

546
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:52,083
You are not a real policeman. You are just a
publicity stunt that we have to put up with.

547
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,217
So...

548
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:58,166
Why don't you just about-face
and get out of my office.

549
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:13,133
Okiedokles, sir.

550
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,108
I've pretty much completed
Prometheus per your specifications,

551
00:37:17,308 --> 00:37:21,012
and, I must say,
the likeness is really quite convincing.

552
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:24,917
Good. Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, Kramer.

553
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,417
Isn't that Dr. Brenda
Bradford's Private data?

554
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:30,091
Oh, yes.

555
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:34,417
I tapped into her files
and stole her research.

556
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,091
Why would you do that?

557
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,250
"Why would you do that?
Why would you do that?"

558
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,258
Ah.
Oh, oh.

559
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,675
Kramer, don't look
so nonplussed.

560
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:54,583
Now that Dr. Bradford is part of the
Scolex team, we share everything,

561
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:57,508
or at least we will.

562
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,712
Oh, well, I think sharing files is a
great way to bring the company together.

563
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,917
You know, make sure we're all singing
off the same song sheet, so to speak.

564
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,217
Imagine my relief
to have your support.

565
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,667
Anyway, sir, like I said,
without the chip, I don't think...

566
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:14,175
Oh, so you made the chip.

567
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,959
Hey, that looks just like
the guy we almost killed.

568
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,959
Oh, I didn't hear that!

569
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,458
Chips ahoy.

570
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:28,342
Wow!
Oh, sweet lordy.

571
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,691
Good morning, Robogadget.

572
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,841
You have just been animated,

573
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:36,542
by the most complex computer
technology in the world.

574
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:40,375
What are you going
to do now?

575
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:41,959
I'm gonna kick some butt.

576
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,592
Very saucy.

577
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:47,759
It looks so real.
Yow!

578
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,883
Oh!
Very good, yes!

579
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,792
Oh, Robo, nothing
can stop us now!

580
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,417
Gotta make my own case.

581
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,125
B, b, b, b, b, b, b
Bradford.

582
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,083
Go-go gadget

583
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,208
Increase magnification.

584
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,333
Increase magnification.

585
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,841
"Si."
Go, go Spanish translation.

586
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,625
"Si" means "Yes."
I knew it!

587
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,208
Inspector Gadget,
can I have your autograph?

588
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:07,208
Got any money?
uh-uh.

589
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,458

But what else could "si" stand for?
"Space invaders"?

596
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,800
Nah!
"Scuba instructor"?

597
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,925
No!
Hey, how about "super idiot"?

598
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,634
No, that's not it.
Uncle John,

599
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:50,250
I love you, but I think
you have a loose wire.

600
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,333
Oh, what about that?

601
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,300
"Scolex Industries."

602
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,925
Hello. Finally, there's
a detective in the house.

603
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:12,000
Wait a minute. If Scolex stole the foot,
then Scolex murdered Dr...

604
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,792
Oh, no! Brenda!

605
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:19,925
Time to work!

606
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,375
Can you find the Scolex
building from here?

607
00:41:22,575 --> 00:41:25,375
Or should I
call the police?

608
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:26,342
I am the police.

609
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:27,300
Hey, wait.
What about me?

610
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,966
You're smarter than he is.

611
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,008
Stay in the car. I don't mind
babysitting you, Penny,

612
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:35,592
but please tell the beagle that
that's an armrest, not a chew toy.

613
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:41,375
Inspector Gadget apparently has gone
berserk in the downtown Riverton area.

614
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:43,217
Eyewitnesses told me
that he was laughing

615
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,634
while he maliciously stacked these four cars.
What's gone wrong?

616
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:49,333
Other reports indicate that he's already
caused a major traffic accident,

617
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:54,750
destroyed private property and set
fire to an elderly man's beard.

618
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,667
Go-go gadget
grappling hook.

619
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,834
Whoo!

620
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,834
John!

621
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:22,800
What happened?

622
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,717
I'll go get Scolex.
Maybe he can help.

623
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,208
Brenda, it's not safe here.
Scolex is a liar and a thief and...

624
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:31,667
Let's just say
he's not a very good guy.

625
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,841
Go home!
Lock your doors!

626
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:38,708
Stay alive!
Whatever happens, I will find you.

627
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:45,925
Oh, too far!
Whoa!

628
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,542
That hurt!

629
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,166
Wowser. I knew it.

630
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,667
You'll pay for this, Scolex.

631
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,625
Go-go suction shoes.

632
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:16,667
Hello?

633
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,083
Hello?

634
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,708
Sandy, is that you?

635
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,050
wow!

636
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,342
I finally get to meet you.
Y...

637
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,750
Sandy built me
to your specifications.

638
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,634
You're me?

639
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:35,708
We are like totally twins.

640
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,050
You must be Brenda.

641
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,342
Sandy was right.
I'm you. Only prettier.

642
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:44,208
We probably share brain waves.
Are you thinking about gelato right now?

643
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:45,625
'Cause I am.

644
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,046
I gotta go find John.

645
00:43:50,246 --> 00:43:51,834
Don't you wanna hang out?

646
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:24,917
John!

647
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:31,634
Outside! It's so beautiful!

648
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:35,834
Hey, Brenda, let's hang out, okay?
Have some quality girl time.

649
00:44:58,583 --> 00:44:59,634
Gotcha!

650
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:01,291
Whoa!

651
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,000
Huh?
Go-go gadget blades.

652
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,634
Huh?

653
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,708
We have a blader.

00:45:39,992 --> 00:45:43,041
All Sandy ever wants to
talk about is that gross foot.

661
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,634
What foot?

662
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:52,525
The one he stole
and copied to make me.

00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:55,417

Glad you could drop in.

670
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,717
I owe you one, Scolex.
Oh?

671
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:17,671
You blew up me
and my Chevette,

672
00:46:17,871 --> 00:46:19,425
and I really liked that car.

673
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:24,166
Well, you crushed my hand,
and I really liked that hand,

674
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,883
so, go, go
get over it.

675
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't know what
you're up to, Scolex,

676
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,217
but you'll
never get away with it.

677
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:35,342
Oh, how cliché, Inspector.

678
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:40,792
I think somebody's been watching
too many Saturday morning cartoons.

679
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:42,083
Hmm?
Huh?

680
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,841
Huh?

681
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:48,417
Unfortunately, Gadget,
in the real world...

682
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,567
Evil quite often prevails.

683
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,834
I'm afraid so.
Pull him up.

684
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,041
Now, look how your replacement
is helping people...

685
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:05,645
To cross the street.
Hey.

686
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:08,250
He looks just like me.

687
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,258
I don't get it.

688
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:12,792
Why would you do this?
To make teachers!

689
00:47:12,992 --> 00:47:15,041
Shut up!
Oh.

690
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,917
I'll tell you why.

691
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:25,417
To make techno-warriors
that never get tired,

692
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:27,188
never get hungry...

693
00:47:27,388 --> 00:47:28,959
And never say "no."

694
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:35,166
Every army in the world will
be made up of my creations.

695
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:39,542
Imagine the confusion,
Gadget, huh?

696
00:47:39,742 --> 00:47:41,000
Imagine the perks.

697
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,333
Comprende?

698
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,542
Yeah, I comprende.

699
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,500
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

700
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,008
I comprendo.
Yo comprendo.

701
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:57,467
Conjugate the verb, for pity's sake.
Oh.

702
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,625
Pull the N.S.A. chip before
he butchers another language.

703
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:00,717
You're kidding, right?

704
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,275
Okay. You see?
He's always kidding.

705
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:05,634
I never know.
This time no.

706
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:09,083
I want to make sure nobody else
can develop their own android.

707
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:12,875
Do it,
or you'll be building yourself a new head.

708
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:14,217
Oh.

709
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,667
"New head."

710
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:21,800
Okay, I am not here
right now.

711
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,208
I am on the beach with dolphins,
and, oh, hi, look at this starfish.

712
00:48:26,408 --> 00:48:27,458
I don't feel so good.

713
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:32,708
I'm sorry, Gadget.
Good help is so hard to find these days.

714
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:34,834
Would you mind
if I do the honors, hmm?

715
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,091
Well, here goes.

716
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,583
Arrivederci. Ciao, ciao.

717
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,550
Goodbye, Mr. Chip.

718
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,542
Dump this idiot
in the junkyard.

719
00:48:48,742 --> 00:48:51,383
Yes, boss.

720
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:54,675
Oh, no, not that idiot.
This one.

721
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,008
Oh, I wish you'd be
more specific.

722
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:59,250
There's an awful lot
of idiots around here.

723
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:03,592
Attention, Robogadget.

724
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:06,050
Destroy the city
and have some fun.

725
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,942
Okay, boss.
You with the beard, come here.

726
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:11,634
Hello? John?
Anybody home?

727
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:14,342
You sit back and enjoy the ride, Penny.
I'm driving.

728
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:18,875
Hey, remember, kids. I'm a professional car,
so don't try this at home.

729
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:22,000
Penny, where's your uncle?
I thought he was with you.

730
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:24,883
This is bad.

731
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,608
Come on, Penny.
We gotta find him.

732
00:49:26,808 --> 00:49:28,333
There's something
rotten in Riverton.

733
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,166
Where you going, Gadget?
The chief is very upset with you.

734
00:49:33,366 --> 00:49:34,792
I'm gonna
have to arrest you. Hey!

735
00:49:34,992 --> 00:49:35,966
Get your hands off me!

736
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,508
Officer down!
Strike!

737
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:44,291
Next time you pay for a gadget,
don't forget the extended warranty.

738
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:45,792
What?

739
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:54,759
Let's talk, chief.

740
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:59,208
Sure. What do you What do you
want to talk about? Politics?

741
00:49:59,408 --> 00:50:00,625
The Florida Marlins?

742
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,316
II know you're upset
about yesterday.

743
00:50:04,516 --> 00:50:06,283
That was the job talking.
The truth is...

744
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:08,050
I want you I want you
on the Bradford case.

745
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:13,417
In fact, I... I want you
to lead the Bradford case.

746
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,258
I think...

747
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,333
Freeze!
Hold it right there!

748
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,792
Shoot him!

749
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:24,417
Adios, boys!

750
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,333
Whee!

751
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,792
♪ Wild thing

752
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:35,004
♪ You make my heart sing

753
00:50:35,204 --> 00:50:38,792
♪ You make everything

754
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,834
♪ Come on, wild thing ♪

755
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,208
Ladies, I don't like
the looks of this.

756
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,792
What would
Uncle John be doing here?

757
00:51:12,992 --> 00:51:14,041
I mean...

758
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:16,883
Are you sure we picked up
the right signal?

759
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:17,925
Of course,
I have the right signal.

760
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,250
You know I have lojack
on my father's side.

761
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,008
Uh-oh, I don't like this.

762
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:50,166
See, I know what dogs do
when they're nervous. Stop!

763
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:53,458
Uncle John!
Penny!

764
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,592
Uncle John!

765
00:51:56,792 --> 00:51:58,583
Penny!
Uncle John!

766
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:07,583
No! Uncle John!
Wake up!

767
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,166
Please, don't tell me.

768
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:17,250
No.

769
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,166
The N.S.A. chip is gone.

770
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:27,166
He doesn't need the chip.

771
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:30,125
He's got the heart.

772
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:31,792
He can do it all by himself.

773
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:06,250
Hmm?

774
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,667
Can't be.

775
00:53:14,834 --> 00:53:16,817
John?
Uncle John?

776
00:53:17,017 --> 00:53:19,000
John, can you hear us?

777
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:20,750
He's alive.

778
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,800
Brenda.

779
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,545
Penny?
You're alive.

780
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,091
It's a miracle.

781
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,091
He doesn't need the chip.

782
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,000
It's my Uncle John,
that's what it is.

783
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,875
Whoa.

784
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,175
Way to go, rookie.

785
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,250
We'll make a cop
out of you yet.

786
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,050
Buckle up, kids,
and stick some newspaper under that beagle.

787
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,875
This engine's only got two speeds,
"Fast" and "Whoo, what was that?"

788
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,508
Where's Scolex?
I'll find him. You drive.

789
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:57,708
Let's see what you can do,
Gadgetmobile, 'cause I feel the need...

790
00:53:57,908 --> 00:53:59,208
The need for speed.

791
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,458
Now, if I'm home late,
it just means it took a little extra time

792
00:54:09,658 --> 00:54:12,083
to overthrow Scolex's
evil empire, okay?

793
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:14,708
Okay!
Later, Penny.

794
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:18,125
Left turn!

795
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,875
Right turn!

796
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:23,425
Where'd they go?

797
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,959
Heads up, baby!
Evil dude's limo at 12:00.

798
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,875
Left turn!
Got it!

799
00:54:29,075 --> 00:54:30,592
Okay, take the wheel.

800
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:33,583
Right!
When I give you the signal, slow down.

801
00:54:33,783 --> 00:54:35,300
Okay!

802
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,375
Okay. Whoo!

803
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:41,925
Now!

804
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,333
Gotcha!

805
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,025
Nice aim, doc!

806
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:49,300
Thank you.

807
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,750
You're under arrest for the murder
of Artemus Bradford, Scolex.

808
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,417
God, you're irritating.

809
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,091
And you...

810
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:59,667
You're under arrest for
impersonating a police officer.

811
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:01,959
Oh, what a tangled web
we weave

812
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:03,333
Get rid of him.

813
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:15,125
You just ran a stop sign.
Whoa!

814
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:21,458
Hot, hot, hot, hot.
Hot foot. Hot, hot, hot.

815
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:24,250
Oh, whoo!
Go-go gadget skis.

816
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:26,962
Go-go gadget snow.

817
00:55:27,162 --> 00:55:29,333
Go-go gadget water.

818
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,875
Go-go gadget...

819
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,625
Mommy!

820
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,333
Hmm?

821
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:43,166
Whoa!

822
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,500
Whoa!

823
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,250
Hey, stretch, pull over.

824
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:17,375
Hey, you don't bump
the Gadgetmobile.

825
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,208
The Gadgetmobile bumps you.

826
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:27,375
I'll go get him, boss.
Sit tight.

827
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:34,375
Watch out behind you!

828
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,667
We're gonna have some fun.

829
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,625
I'm gonna make you
into a compact.

830
00:56:46,825 --> 00:56:48,841
Whoo!
Time for a bat turn.

831
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:52,041
Don't lose that limo!
On the case, doc!

832
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:01,717
You know how to dance,
don't you?

833
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:05,667
Actually, I was taking lessons
not long ago, in the hope...

834
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,667
Shut up and dance!
That one day I...

835
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:08,917
Uh-oh.

836
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:21,375
Go-go gadget air bag.

837
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,875
Ooh! Ooh!
Ah!

838
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:34,175
Oh, Sikes, you lost her.

839
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:36,125
I'm gonna try
to find her, boss.

840
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,383
It's not good, sir.

841
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,875
Let's use the element
of surprise.

842
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,133
Oh, surprise.

843
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,708
Brenda, what
a pleasant surprise.

844
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,041
Brenda, Brenda.

845
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:53,125
You!

846
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:57,759
Stop, Claw!

847
00:57:57,959 --> 00:57:58,759
Brenda, Brenda, Brenda.

848
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:02,046
You know, I love it
when you call me "Claw."

849
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,333
So what's new?
Hello... You killed my father!

850
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,291
Time.

851
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,275
Gadget here.
It's about Brenda, partner.

852
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:27,217
Yeah?
Scolex is taking her to the roof.

853
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:29,917
I'd save her, but I can't
fit in the elevator.

854
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:31,342
I'm on my way.

855
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,208
You know what they say about
nice guys finishing last?

856
00:58:34,408 --> 00:58:34,966
Huh?

857
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:37,066
Well, they were wrong.

858
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:39,166
Go-go gadget
oil slick.

859
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,291
Toothpaste?
Whaa!

860
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:50,546
What happened to you?

861
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:51,759
Let me put it this way.

862
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:54,500
I got the skittles
kicked out of me.

863
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,592
I'll be right back.

864
00:58:56,792 --> 00:59:00,166
Oh. Penny, why are you here?
Evidence!

865
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,625
Hey, Gadget.
It's a clip-on.

866
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:13,083
Whoa!

867
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,750
Okay, Brain. No, no, no,
Brain, you go that way.

868
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,041
I'll go this way.

869
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,875
I gotta destroy the evidence.
Why couldn't it be a finger?

870
00:59:33,075 --> 00:59:36,208
I could be working
at my dad's store right now...

871
00:59:36,408 --> 00:59:38,583
Selling nails, hammers
and power drills.

872
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,875
Yes!
Power drills rock!

873
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,208
Get in there!

874
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:53,796
Well, who are you?

875
00:59:53,996 --> 00:59:55,917
Whoa, there, big boy.

876
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:59,417
Um, hi, there.

877
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,550
Hello.

878
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,500
Why's that foot
in the toilet?

879
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,875
I was, uh,
I was cleaning it.

880
01:00:09,075 --> 01:00:10,291
So what's your name?

881
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:13,966
Uh, I'm Sikes.

882
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:18,917
You know, Sikes, you look more like
the kind of guy who should be, um...

883
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:20,917
Uh...

884
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,333
Helping someone pick out
good weather stripping.

885
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,291
My old man had
a hardware store.

886
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,834
Telephone!

887
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,375
It's mine.

888
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:48,008
Hello?
Hi, Mr. Gadget.

889
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:50,125
Nicole and Kim, how'd you get
the number of my hand?

890
01:00:50,325 --> 01:00:51,925
From Penny.
Is she there?

891
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,171
Penny isn't here right now,
but you can call her at home, okay?

892
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:56,168
She's not home, but we'll try her again.
Okay, bye.

893
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:58,166
Bye. What do they mean,
she's not at home?

894
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,883
Whee, whee!

895
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:15,458
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh!

896
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:26,175
I don't get it, Claw.
What's your plan now?

897
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,834
Since my dreams for
a global robotic empire...

898
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,458
Mongrel! My pants!
Oh, God!

899
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:38,625
Mongrel.

900
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,000
Next thing you know...

901
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:45,041
Next thing you know,

902
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:46,634
you're a minion.

903
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:48,667
You're a minion.

904
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,583
I'm a minion.

905
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,208
Ooh! Oh!

906
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:01,959
Ow, ow!

907
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,800
Uncle.

908
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,542
Hey, hey, don't touch that.

909
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:15,008
Hey. Hey,

910
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:16,900
what'd you do that for?

911
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,592
We shouldn't be fighting.

912
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:21,542
We've got a lot in common,
except I've got nicer teeth.

913
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:27,375
I'd hoped that we could've worked together,
been partners.

914
01:02:27,575 --> 01:02:28,759
Together, you and I could've

915
01:02:28,959 --> 01:02:31,342
ruled the world.

916
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:33,333
You should've quit
while you were ahead.

917
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,875
Cannonball!

918
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:42,125
Ooh! Ooh la la!

919
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,417
Go-go gadget chopper.

920
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,375
Contact.

921
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:10,300
Whoa! Whoa! whoa!
Whoa!

922
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,959
How do ya... Whoa...
Fly this thing?

923
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:18,383
Oh! Oh, no!
Go, go back.

924
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:21,333
Up, up, up, up. Good, good, good, good.
Oh, bad, bad, bad.

925
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,792
My hair!

926
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,792
Sit back and relax, darling.

927
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:44,717
Whoa!

928
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:47,542
Hey!
I can see my house from here.

929
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:48,425
Whoa!

930
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:49,467
Two things, Scolex!

931
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:52,171
One, you are
completely insane.

932
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,875
And two,
I liked you better fat.

933
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:02,542
Bring on the brownies!
Ha!

934
01:04:02,742 --> 01:04:05,133
Wheel in the waffles!

935
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:08,000
I'm ready to binge!

936
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:16,792
Darn! That fellow
will not give us a break!

937
01:04:16,992 --> 01:04:20,166
For the third time
Sanford Scolex,

938
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:22,041
you are under arrest!

939
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:26,300
No!

940
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,959
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
Gadget!

941
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,500
John!
Oh, no!

942
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,008
Let me give you a lift.

943
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:48,175
Where can I drop you off?

944
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:50,208
I'd answer, but I doubt
you really care.

945
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:55,008
John! I'm up here!
Take my hand!

946
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:57,375
Hi, John. How are you
doing down there?

947
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:04,008
John!
"John!"

948
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:08,333
John, I know you can save us!
Think of something!

949
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:09,959
I'm working on it.

950
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,250
Hurry!

951
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,750
Try to visualize your goal.

952
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:45,708
Back to the drawing board!

953
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:49,217
Brenda, jump!
Right on my back!

954
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:52,125
Oh, Brenda, don't jump. For god's sake,
we can work this out, darling.

955
01:05:52,325 --> 01:05:54,500
Sweetie pie, really!

956
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,750
My God.
Me I'm out of control.

957
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:09,458
Go-go gadget air brakes.
Go-go gadget airplane.

958
01:06:09,658 --> 01:06:11,091
I don't know what
to go, go anymore!

959
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:12,966
Didn't you read the manual?
Try something else!

960
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:17,291
Go-go gadget glider. Go-go gadget balloon.
Go-go gadget parachute.

961
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:19,133
Go-go gadget
giant trampoline.

962
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:22,083
Go-go gadget circus net. Go-go gadget
featherbed. Go-go gadget hay wagon.

963
01:06:22,283 --> 01:06:25,792
Go-go gadget bubble wrap.
Go-go gadget parasail. Parakeet.

964
01:06:25,992 --> 01:06:27,500
Paraglider. Parasol.

965
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:32,300
Umbrella?
John, you did it.

966
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,125
You saved our lives.
I did? I guess I did.

967
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,425
Wowser!

968
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:39,634
Just watch out for the big head.
Understood.

969
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:42,792
You know, arrogance can sneak up on you.
No, that big head!

970
01:06:42,992 --> 01:06:44,750
Oh, no.

971
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:54,542
John!
Are you okay?

972
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,083
Gadget.

973
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:05,417
Oh, hello, Brenda.

974
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:07,625
Are you breathing?

975
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:10,417
I think so.

976
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:15,834
How's your central vallecular
equilibrator feeling?

977
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:17,966
It feels pretty good.

978
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,834
And how's your auto-axle
lubricator functioning?

979
01:07:21,034 --> 01:07:22,166
It's functioning fully.

980
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:37,383
Oh, Gadget.
What is it?

981
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,542
Is my occipital piston
slipping?

982
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,208
No.

983
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:42,966
I just never realized

984
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:46,375
what beautiful brown eyes
you have.

985
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:00,550
It's a high-fly Scolex.

986
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,083
The Gadgetmobile
pulls under it.

987
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:04,395
The crowd's going crazy.

988
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:06,708
He makes the catch!

989
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:08,091
We made it!

990
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:12,208
Ladies and gentlemen, Scolex
is out and that is the game!

991
01:08:12,408 --> 01:08:16,417
Final score, Gadgetmobile one,
Scolex zippo.

992
01:08:16,617 --> 01:08:19,383
And the fans rush the field.

993
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,333
No autographs, please.
Please, y'all, come on, now.

994
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:23,883
Freeze! Get back!

995
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:26,583
Gentlemen, there's been
some kind of a mistake.

996
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:28,383
Chief!

997
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,383
Oh, sorry, kiddo.

998
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:32,417
I'm gonna have to place
your uncle under arrest.

999
01:08:32,617 --> 01:08:34,050
Freeze!
Don't move, Gadget!

1000
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,504
Well, I just thought you'd
wanna know That Sanford Scolex

1001
01:08:37,704 --> 01:08:40,959
created an evil version of my
uncle to terrorize Riverton.

1002
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:41,883
Is that true?

1003
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:44,966
Every word of it.
She's an amazing young woman.

1004
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:49,542
She held up a mirror to my misguided
ways in the service of Mr. Scolex.

1005
01:08:49,742 --> 01:08:51,091
I'm sorry, Chief.

1006
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:56,417
Here's the foot.
I didn't know any better.

1007
01:08:56,617 --> 01:08:57,008
Et tu, Sikes?

1008
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:59,800
Cover him, men!

1009
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,875
They're all yours, fellas.

1010
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,667
Wowser.

1011
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:14,258
Excuse me!
Press!

1012
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:16,583
Excuse me!
Mayor on the premises.

1013

The shepherd needs her sheep.

1014
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:20,717
Yes, it is a credit to myself
and my administration,

1015
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:26,458
that we had the courage to believe
in and initiate the gadget program.

1016
01:09:26,658 --> 01:09:29,937
Arrivederci, Gadget!

I'll get you.

Brain is not here.

1046
01:11:20,959 --> 01:11:24,166
Please leave a message
at the sound of the woof.

1047
01:11:24,366 --> 01:11:25,250
Woof!

1048
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,959
Hey, thanks for watching
my movie.

1049
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,175
Yeah, my movie.

1050
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,708
Even though we called it
Inspector Gadget.

1051
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:36,175
I know you all are wondering.

1052
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,900
Things with the Volkswagen
are working out real good.

1053
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,625
We got married in Las Vegas
in a drive-through chapel.

1054
01:11:41,825 --> 01:11:44,875
We're expecting a little
subcompact any day now.

1055
01:11:45,075 --> 01:11:46,258
Thinking of calling him
"The Love Bug,"

1056
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:50,025
which is in no way a plug for my employer,
the Walt Disney company.

1057
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:53,792
Although when our little one is old enough,
his first words will be,

1058
01:11:53,992 --> 01:11:55,300
"I'm going to Disneyland!"

1059
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,567
But don't any of you leave
for theme parks just yet.

1060
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:01,834
