1
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,341
Smile, damn you.

2
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,409
Smile!

3
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,622
Shut the door.

4
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:37,424
What do you want?

5
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:40,593
I have a job for you.

6
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,795
What kind of job?

7
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,830
<i>It's heavy work.</i>

8
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:47,866
Digging.
We'll need another man.

9
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:52,836
- When do you want it done?
- Some night soon.

10
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:54,804
Where?
<i>The graveyard.</i>

11
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:58,473
Unless you're afraid.

12
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:05,111
The job pays two dollars.
Take it or leave it.

13
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,346
I'll take it.

14
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,850
But the job pays three dollars.

15
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:15,285
Unless you think
I deserve more.

16
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:18,888
No. Three dollars
seems fair enough. Yep.

17
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:37,204
¶¶

18
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:56,420
And where do you think
you're going?

19
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:59,523
Go back to sleep, sid. I'm
just runnin' away from home.

20
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:04,160
Again?
This time for sure.

21
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:09,631
Me and Joe Harper and Ben Rogers
is goin' to new Orleans...

22
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,767
To be steamboat men. Not
if I tell aunt Polly.

23
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:17,871
I knew you were gonna be your
annoying little self, sid.

24
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:20,607
So I rigged up
a little surprise for ya.

25
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,209
There.
And so you don't get lonely...

26
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:31,649
now, that right there is the most
poisonous spider in the whole world.

27
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:35,786
If you knock that glass over,
she's gonna be pretty angry.

28
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:38,822
'Course, it could just be
a little harmless fruit spider.

29
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:42,292
But, only one way
to find out, right?

30
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:26,302
<i>Howdy, boys!</i>

31
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,304
Hey, muff.
Yeah, hey, muff.

32
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,506
Where are you headed
this hour of the night?

33
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:32,941
We're runnin' away from home.
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

34
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:37,578
I used to do that all the time,
until home ran away from me.

35
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,947
<i>Where'd they go?</i>

36
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,582
As far away as they could.

37
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,551
Come on.

38
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,954
Don't let me stop you.

39
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,957
Hey, when ya comin' back?

40
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,025
Never!
Yep, never!

41
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,327
Never, huh?

42
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,566
See ya tomorrow.

43
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,758
Bye, bye, Hannibal. Good-bye!
We're gonna be steamboat men.

44
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:34,929
Left and bring her into the wind, Mr.
Harper. Aye, sir.

45
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,331
Steady, now, steady.

46
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,634
Steady it is, sir.

47
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:44,471
Next stop, new Orleans.
Nothing can stop us now.

48
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:53,345
- Hard to port! Hard to port!
- What's port?

49
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:56,047
To the left!
No, it's right!

50
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:58,482
<i>To the right then. Just pull it, Joe.
Pull it!</i>

51
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,917
<i>Come on, Joe!
Pull!</i>

52
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:26,974
All right. Tom, tom.
Tom! Tom!

53
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:30,110
<i>Tom!</i>

54
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,897
<i>Tom! Tom!</i>

55
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:04,840
You all right, tom? Yeah, yeah.
Of course I'm all right.

56
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,976
If it hadn't been for...

57
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:11,079
Whoever it was,
you'd have been a goner.

58
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:14,749
Town? Town. Come on.

59
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,433
Bye, tom.

60
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:57,119
Mornin', everybody.
What's for breakfast?

61
00:07:57,121 --> 00:08:01,889
Well, you can start...
With this.

62
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,691
<i>Eeow.</i>

63
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,959
Couldn't I just have
some scrambled eggs?

64
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:11,029
Tom, I have a notion
to skin you alive.

65
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:14,098
Sneaking out 'til all hours!
Worrying a body to death!

66
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,700
Yeah. Shall I get
the switch?

67
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:21,471
I swore to your mama, my own sister, on her
deathbed that I would raise you proper.

68
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:23,806
And you're doin' a fine job. No.

69
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:26,575
I know I am not doing
my duty by you.

70
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,710
I'll get the switch.
No!

71
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,816
I'll just be obliged
to make you work tomorrow.

72
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:39,219
Tomorrow? Couldn't I
just take a whippin'?

73
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:42,889
I have got to do something, and I
ain't got the heart to hit you.

74
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,157
<i>Now sit.</i>

75
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:36,104

81
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:55,588
Are you feeling okay, tom?

82
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,958
Hi, Billy. I was havin' so much
fun, didn't even hear you comin'.

83
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,027
Fun? Whitewashin'
this here fence.

84
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:12,535
Nah. That ain't fun.
That's work.

85
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,838
Billy, if this was work,
would I be doin' it?

86
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,741
Ain't every day a boy gets
to whitewash a fence.

87
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:22,276
Say, tom?
Hmm?

88
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,912
Let me whitewash a little?

89
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:31,016
Aunt Polly's awful particular
about this fence.

90
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:33,051
<i>Just a little.</i>

91
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:35,653
I'd like to help you out, bill.
Honest injun.

92
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:38,589
But if you were to tackle this here fence,
and anything was to happen to it...

93
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:41,825
I'll be real careful.

94
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:45,161
What'll you give me?

95
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,062
Uhh...

96
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,868
oop! Oooh!

97
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,702
<i>Huck!</i>

98
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:37,975
You're back! Where'd you go?
Where've you been?

99
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:40,644
Well, I'm a traveler.

100
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,912
I go lots of places.

101
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:46,115
Go upriver, downriver.
No place particular.

102
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:49,751
I'm bound to pass through here
sometime.

103
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:55,155
You're the one who pulled
me out the other night.

104
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,625
I felt like a swim.

105
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:02,160
Come on.
I'll show you my place.

106
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:07,965
So how long you been
livin' here, huck?

107
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,300
About a month.

108
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:13,703
A month, huh?
Uh-huh.

109
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,771
Well?

110
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,309
Whoa!

111
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,715
Last week, aunt Polly whupped me for swipin'
a pie that was coolin' on the windowsill.

112
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:31,984
<i>But it wasn't me.
Figured it was sid.</i>

113
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:35,787
- He wanted it, but I beat him to it.
- I oughta punch you in the nose.

114
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,392
You're welcome to try.

115
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,028
Maybe later.

116
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,467
<i>So, when you're not stealin' food
and savin' folks from drownin',</i>

117
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:55,138
<i>what do you do all day?
</i> Whatever I want.

118
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,910
Sure are lucky.

119
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:04,313
Yep.
I'm a free man.

120
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:11,252
Go wherever I want when I wanna go there,
do whatever I want when I want to do it.

121
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:13,354
It's as simple as that.

122
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:22,529
It's good to see ya.

123
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:24,564
What's that for?

124
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,133
It's what friends do.

125
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,268
We friends?

126
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,441
It's up to you.

127
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,943
If your aunt Polly
catches you and me,

128
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,211
she'll whup you
from here to St. Louis.

129
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:45,081
This has nothin' to do with her. We was
friends before. Don't you remember?

130
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,950
Yeah, I guess we were.

131
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,585
Now we're friends again.

132
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:53,053
Yeah, I guess we are.

133
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,957
<i>We won't do it again,
will we?</i>

134
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,060
Will we? I can't hear you.
Uh-uh.

135
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,267
Thomas Sawyer!

136
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:12,069
<i>Sorry I'm late for school,
Mr. dobbins.</i>

137
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:16,173
Well, what's your excuse
this time?

138
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,375
I stopped to talk
with huckleberry finn.

139
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:23,045
Thomas Sawyer!

140
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:26,848
That is the most
astounding confession...

141
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,350
I have ever had to listen to.

142
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,419
Yes, sir.
<i>You are not unaware...</i>

143
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,555
That it is forbidden
to converse with that...

144
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:38,291
Idle wastrel?

145
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:42,962
No, sir.
I-I mean, yes, sir.

146
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:45,965
You know, of course, that I shall
have to punish you. <i>Oh, no.</i>

147
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:51,002
No, Mr. dobbins, please. You
wouldn't make me sit with the girls.

148
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,139
Once again, Thomas Sawyer,

149
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:59,608
you have outsmarted yourself.

150
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,345
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh.

151
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:06,947

174
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:06,216
She pushes you off a bridge 'cause
she likes you? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

175
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:11,019
I think you're both crazy.

176
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:14,989
Hey, huck, what you got
in the sack?

177
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,591
A dead cat.

178
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:20,760
Wagon run over him.
Guts come out both ends.

179
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:24,997
What's a dead cat
good for?

180
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,299
To cure warts with.

181
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:30,602
I got one.
How's it work?

182
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:34,305
You take your dead cat to the graveyard
on the day somebody wicked's been buried.

183
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:37,474
When the devil comes, you heave
your dead cat at him and say,

184
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:40,610
"devil follow corpse.
Cat follow devil.

185
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:43,212
Warts follow cat.
I'm done with you."

186
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:46,048
That'll fetch any wart.
<i>Sounds right.</i>

187
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,484
- So when you gonna try?
- Tonight.

188
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,420
Let me go with ya, huck.

189
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,755
You might get scared.

190
00:17:55,757 --> 00:18:00,059
I ain't scared of nothin'.

191
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:21,345
Dead seems kinda lively tonight,
don't they?

192
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,214
Baah!

193
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,583
<i>Be careful!</i>

194
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,690
Hmm.

195
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:42,197
<i>- Who are they?
- The two on the right ain't so bad.</i>

196
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:46,067
<i>The skinny one's doc Robinson,
and the fat one's muff Potter.</i>

197
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:51,238
<i>Muff wouldn't hurt a fly.
That third fellow there?</i>

198
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,507
That's injun Joe.
Injun Joe?

199
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,643
You know him?

200
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:00,212
Let's just say I met him once,

201
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:02,714
and I ain't in a hurry
to meet him again.

202
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:09,119
They're goin' for
one of them old graves.

203
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:20,161
That's it. That's it.

204
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:22,296
W-would it be all right...

205
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:26,866
If we stopped for a...
A little libation?

206
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:30,636
What?
I need me a drink.

207
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:34,172
No! Haul it up!
And hurry.

208
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:44,680
<i>Yep! C'mon, c'mon.
Pry it open. Tip it over.</i>

209
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,886
Murrell!

210
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:56,290
One-eyed murrell?
My God!

211
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,168
Put the coffin back.
Cover up your tracks.

212
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:15,273
Hey, not so fast. Get
your hands off me.

213
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:19,743
Gimme that box. Doc, Joe, let's
talk this over like gentle...

214
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:24,146
what'd you do that for?
That's just not right.

215
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:26,214
Is it, doc?
Come here.

216
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:29,417
<i>Come on, now. I got ya.
</i> It's a treasure map.

217
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:32,219
<i>Oh!</i>

218
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:36,622
Murrell's treasure?
Murrell's lost treasure?

219
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:39,324
By glory, we're rich!

220
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:41,426
<i>It's mine!</i>

221
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:42,794
Oooh!

222
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:56,372
No.

223
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:14,887
What are you doing
with that thing?

224
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,963
We gotta tell the sheriff.
<i>I ain't tellin' nobody.</i>

225
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,899
Unless you're dumber than I think you are,
you're gonna keep your mouth shut too.

226
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:03,901
But we seen a murder.

227
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,803
Yeah. And there's gonna be two more
murders if we squeak on injun Joe.

228
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:10,839
Killin' us would mean less to
him than drowning a few cats.

229
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:18,746
I guess you're right.
We can't tell nobody.

230
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,648
You're damn right.

231
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,884
Just to make sure
you don't change your mind,

232
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,553
we're gonna swear an oath.

233
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,356
We'll write it down
and sign it in blood.

234
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:34,725
Our blood?

235
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:39,396
Unless you wanna go back and
borrow some from doc Robinson.

236
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:47,469
You do it. I ain't
much good at writin'.

237
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,839
Damn!
I lost my marble!

238
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:54,508
We've got bigger things
to worry about.

239
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,611
Now, would you please
write this down?

240
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:01,314
I'm sorry.

241
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:10,555
Huck finn and tom Sawyer...

242
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,757
Swear they'll keep shut...

243
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,493
<i>About what they seen.</i>

244
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:19,830
May they drop down dead
if they ever tell a soul.

245
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,068
And rot.

246
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,470
And rot.

247
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,908
Now we sign it.

248
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:10,644
"H" is for huck.

249
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:15,748
"F" for finn.

250
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,950
Thanks.

251
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:01,758
I'm gonna kill you, tom Sawyer.

252
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,795
No-o-o!

253
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,863
No!

254
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,700
Bad dream?

255
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:19,004
Ow! Mother, mother!
Tom hit me with a pillow!

256
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,108
<i>C'mon! C'mon!
Right down here.</i>

257
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:31,715
<i>Hey, tom!
School's been called off.</i>

258
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:35,551
Why? What for? There's
been a murder.

259
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,890
I didn't do it!
I swear, I didn't do it!

260
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:46,160
What happened to your face? I-I-I don't
know, but I swear I didn't do it.

261
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:49,163
Look what I found!
It's muff Potter's knife.

262
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:53,100
I sold it to him last winter. <i>I
say lynch him. Lynch him now!</i>

263
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:55,202
- You've gotta believe me!
- No.

264
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:58,805
<i>- I saw the murder.</i>
- Hang him up.

265
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:04,809
<i>Oh. Oh, Joe.
Thank the lord.</i>

266
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:07,645
You tell them now.

267
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:12,016
You tell them...
you tell them it ain't me.

268
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:14,952
<i>Tell us what you know.</i>

269
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:19,155
Yeah, I passed through here
last night.

270
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:23,292
And I saw muff and doc Robinson...
Diggin' up that there grave.

271
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:29,898
<i>Then in a drunken rage,
I saw muff stab the doc.</i>

272
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,934
String him up!

273
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:37,238
That ain't the way it happened.
I swear.

274
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,742
We found the map...
To murrell's treasure.

275
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:46,346
And then Joe and doc got to fightin'.
Murrell's treasure.

276
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:49,916
You hear that, people? More
drunk talk from muff Potter.

277
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:54,053
Murrell's lost treasure
is an old wives' tale.

278
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:56,889
I know the history
of this entire county,

279
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:59,291
and I'm telling you
it doesn't exist.

280
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:02,861
But I seen the map!

281
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:05,897
I say you're lyin'.

282
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:09,133
I say there ain't no map.

283
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:12,903
- And there never was.
<i>- String him up!</i>

284
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:17,673
Who all thinks muff Potter's
a drunk,

285
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:21,943
a liar and a murderer,
raise your hand!

286
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,113
<i>I say we hang him!</i>

287
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:35,253
<i>All right, folks. Let's just hold on here.
Now, hold on.</i>

288
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:37,355
Thank you.

289
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:43,260
Now, you folks wouldn't be trying
to deny me the pleasure...

290
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,962
Of presidin' over a trial,
now would ya?

291
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:51,365
You all right,
Mr. Potter?

292
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,801
After all, what would be the point
of having a new judge in town...

293
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:58,037
If you won't let me judge anything?
<i>We all know he's guilty!</i>

294
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:02,374
Ow! Hey! We all know you're
an idiot, ed dobbins.

295
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:05,110
Listen to me,
you pointy-headed ghouls.

296
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:08,379
Muff Potter may be
the scum of the earth,

297
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:11,715
but he deserves a fair trial,
and I aim to see he gets one.

298
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:14,417
<i>Judge, how soon can you
get this business started?</i>

299
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,685
I should be able to start hearin'
evidence day after tomorrow.

300
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:22,123
Settled. Now, the rest of you<i> good
</i> citizens, you be on your way.

301
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,925
Let the law do its job.
Come on.

302
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:28,228
Let's go, muff.

303
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:39,871
I didn't do it, tom.
I swear, I didn't do it.

304
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:46,977
<i>¶ There's gonna be a hanging
there's gonna be a hanging ¶</i>

305
00:28:52,016 --> 00:28:54,216
<i>you wanna drop dead and rot?</i>

306
00:28:54,218 --> 00:28:57,752
Muff's innocent, huck.
We gotta help him.

307
00:28:57,754 --> 00:29:00,454
We ain't gotta do nothin'.

308
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:04,457
You'd let him hang
for somethin' he didn't do?

309
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:08,093
It ain't no skin off my back.

310
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,428
What if we could get the map?

311
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,198
We could prove muff was tellin' the truth,
and it wouldn't make us break our oath.

312
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,035
Only one little problem. That
map is in injun Joe's pocket.

313
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:21,338
Well, if you're scared... why should
I stick my neck out for muff Potter?

314
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,773
'Cause we know he didn't do it.
So?

315
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:28,010
So not doin' anything about it is wrong.
Says who?

316
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:32,781
What if it was you in muff's shoes?
It ain't.

317
00:29:32,783 --> 00:29:36,384
What if it was me?
If you was that stupid,

318
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:39,887
maybe you'd deserve
what was comin' to you.

319
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:42,155
It's not what friends do, huck.

320
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:45,824
I thought we was friends.

321
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:50,028
Maybe I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

322
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:58,735
¶¶

323
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:05,775
Hello, tom.
Hey, Becky.

324
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:08,344
Sorry I pushed you
in the creek yesterday.

325
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:11,046
You can push me in
if you want to.

326
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:15,783
I would. I just don't
feel like it right now.

327
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:19,986
Thank you.

328
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:27,760
What's the matter, tom?

329
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:30,529
Oh, nothin'.

330
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,467
You can tell me.

331
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:40,237
I won't ever tell anybody.

332
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,244
Here.

333
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,881
This is for you.

334
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:56,216
Thanks.

335
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,354
You ever been engaged, Becky?

336
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:04,190
No.
How do you do it?

337
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:09,361
Well, you gotta tell the person
that you love 'im.

338
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,463
Then what?

339
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,333
Well, then you're 'spose
to kiss.

340
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:19,869
Really?
Sure.

341
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:26,474
You first. I love you. There.
Now you gotta say it to me.

342
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:29,877
Turn your face away.

343
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:34,314
And you can't tell anybody ever.
I won't.

344
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:40,084
I love you.

345
00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:47,590
Well, I... Guess everything's
done but the kissin' part.

346
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:58,432
Here.

347
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,603
Oh, tom, it's, it's...
what is it?

348
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:07,907
It's your engagement ring.
It's beautiful.

349
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:11,076
It sure is. Why, when I was
engaged to Amy Lawrence, she...

350
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:14,279
what? You mean,
I'm not the first?

351
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:17,915
Yeah. But, Becky, that was ages ago.
Two months at least.

352
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,917
I hate you.
What?

353
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,120
I hate you, and I hope you die!

354
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,191
What'd I do?

355
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:49,143
Guys, that's injun Joe.
Run!

356
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:52,646
This here belong to any of you?

357
00:32:57,485 --> 00:33:00,085
Hah!

358
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,351
Uh, anybody come to see me, sheriff?
Muff, don't be stupid.

359
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:37,153
Nobody cares about you. Nobody's
gonna miss you when you're gone.

360
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:40,221
<i>Here you go.</i>

361
00:33:43,993 --> 00:33:47,394
Thank you.

362
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:12,617
Injun Joe's on the move.

363
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,058
What made you come back, huck?

364
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,462
I figured if you did it alone,
you'd probably splotch it up.

365
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,697
<i>Yeah, probably.</i>

366
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:50,282
<i>You better watch your mouth.</i>

367
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:14,570
<i>Some kid dropped a marble
in the graveyard.</i>

368
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:17,805
You see this here?
He's got my marble.

369
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:22,175
Agh!

370
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:37,255
Eh, probably a drunk.

371
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:41,892
It ain't muff Potter. It's so.

372
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:46,429
The only stumblin' he's gonna be
doin' is at the end of a rope.

373
00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:49,665
Shut up,

374
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,733
Partner.

375
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,569
Yeah, Joe...
Partner.

376
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:57,638
<i>Come on, move!
Let's move.</i>

377
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,807
<i>Watch it. Watch it.
C'mon, hit me.</i>

378
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:08,847
<i>Nice little pirogue
you got there.</i>

379
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:16,187
<i>Come on, lefty.
All right, lefty.</i>

380
00:36:16,189 --> 00:36:19,924
<i>Get it out.
That's it, that's it.</i>

381
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:22,459
Double hold.
Now, c'mon.

382
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:25,395
All right, separate apart.
Go ahead.

383
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:30,266
I guess we can use muff's raft.

384
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:33,269
Yeah. I doubt he'll be
usin' it anytime soon.

385
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:36,438
We better hide the raft and
camp out 'til first light.

386
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,803
Huck?

387
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:18,708
Huck?

388
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:25,212
Huck?

389
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:28,614
Huck!

390
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,854
He's just drunk asleep.

391
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:15,723
Shouldn't be too hard
to get that map.

392
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:18,492
Yeah. Let's get it
and "git."

393
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:26,531
Ain't ya comin'?

394
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:29,800
One map don't need
the two of us.

395
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:33,537
I'll wait here.

396
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,864
Go.

397
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:59,979
Them goddamn wild boars.

398
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,614
Hah!

399
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:20,597
You had to sneeze.

400
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:27,870
Muff's raft must've
washed away in the storm.

401
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:32,441
I guess we'll have to take the
long way back to Hannibal.

402
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:35,444
But I'll tell ya, your ol' aunt's
gonna tar the head off of you...

403
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:38,980
If she finds out you've been
out with me all this time.

404
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:42,016
What?

405
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,552
It's the old haunted house. So?

406
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:49,689
Ghosts don't come out
'til night anyway.

407
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:53,159
Then what was that?

408
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,761
I don't know,
but it's gettin' closer.

409
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:58,864
Then what are we
standing here for?

410
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:41,036
<i>Tom. Tom.</i>

411
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:02,823
What was that?

412
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:05,559
They say this place is haunted.

413
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:08,828
Ahh!
With rats maybe.

414
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:13,499
<i>Let's go to work.</i>

415
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,235
According to murrell's map,

416
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:21,872
it should be
right next to the fireplace.

417
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:44,660
<i>Hey, dig faster,
you stinkin' hog.</i>

418
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,662
<i>I'm doin' all the work.</i>

419
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:51,098
That's a damn lie! I'm diggin'
like a chick on the beach.

420
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,233
Move over.
Ahh!

421
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,968
<i>Quit your bellyachin' and dig.</i>

422
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:04,075
<i>You sure about the fireplace?
Ain't that what I said?</i>

423
00:43:05,912 --> 00:43:08,712
<i>Well, if it's the right place,
he sure buried it deep.</i>

424
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:12,549
- I'm halfway to China.
<i>- Just keep diggin'.</i>

425
00:43:17,922 --> 00:43:21,256
You see?
Right here.

426
00:43:21,258 --> 00:43:23,725
<i>Fireplace!</i>

427
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:27,628
I think I found somethin'.
Great snakes!

428
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:37,703
<i>I gotta get outta here!</i>

429
00:43:46,012 --> 00:43:48,245
<i>Shut up!</i>

430
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:01,690
You screamin' coward.

431
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:05,560
<i>That wasn't ghosts.
It was cobwebs!</i>

432
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:07,828
Now, c'mon!

433
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,897
<i>Well, no need to hit me.</i>

434
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:20,939
God, that's heavy!

435
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:26,844
Go ahead and knock it off.
Quick.

436
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:30,247
<i>Good lord! Look at you.</i>

437
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:33,817
<i>You beautiful money.</i>

438
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:36,885
Hello, Texas and the good life.

439
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:40,254
<i>No!</i>

440
00:44:40,256 --> 00:44:42,623
<i>What?</i>
We'll wait.

441
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,325
<i>'Til after the trial.
I've got to testify.</i>

442
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:48,828
Make sure muff takes the blame
for doc's murder.

443
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:54,066
- Where're we gonna keep it in the meantime?
- Number two under the cross.

444
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:58,303
<i>Load up. I've got some things to take care
of in town.</i> Number two under the cross.

445
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,977
Look who's doin'
all the darn work.

446
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:09,246
<i>Raining like pouring pigs
on a rawhide. Well...</i>

447
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,030
no more map.

448
00:45:28,032 --> 00:45:30,766
No more muff.

449
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:39,807
<i>Number two under the cross.</i>

450
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:44,711
<i>If you ask me, we're better
off not knowin'. Why?</i>

451
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:48,281
<i>Why? 'Cause we're pushin' our
luck messin' with injun Joe.</i>

452
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:52,285
It's the best way I know of
to get killed.

453
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:56,422
Yeah. They say he's the best knife
fighter on the whole Mississippi.

454
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:59,825
No.
My pap's the best.

455
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:03,128
Taught injun Joe
everything he knows.

456
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,297
Your pap knew injun Joe?

457
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:08,832
They met in jail.

458
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:14,002
See, my pap was always runnin' from the law,
'cept when he was beatin' me like a rented mule.

459
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:19,474
Anyways, he taught Joe
how to throw a knife.

460
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:53,206
He taught me too.

461
00:47:01,348 --> 00:47:03,815
Huck, you hear that?

462
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:08,485
Them's church bells.

463
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:11,955
Nah. It ain't Sunday. Oh.

464
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:14,524
Them's funeral bells.

465
00:47:14,526 --> 00:47:17,326
You're right.

466
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:23,131
<i>He sold it to Doug Tanner...
no, wait.</i>

467
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:26,367
<i>Mickey Douglas got the marble
from his cousin in St. Louis...</i>

468
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:31,071
Who traded it to Alfred temple,
who sold it to... Johnny Miller.

469
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:35,208
No, wait.
Alfred sold it to...

470
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,844
Just tell me who owned it last, boy.
Tom Sawyer owned it last.

471
00:47:38,846 --> 00:47:43,514
But it don't matter now
'cause now tom's dead.

472
00:47:43,516 --> 00:47:46,216
That's too bad.

473
00:47:46,218 --> 00:47:48,251
I'm so sad.

474
00:47:50,455 --> 00:47:53,222
Yeah, that's it.
Run, fat boy.

475
00:47:53,224 --> 00:47:55,290
Run!

476
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,093
Tom Sawyer's hat.

477
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:06,098
They found it in the wreckage
of muff Potter's boat.

478
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,435
The mighty Mississippi
claims another life.

479
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:15,873
<i>And while there's some comfort
in knowing...</i>

480
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,541
<i>Tom's fate,</i>

481
00:48:19,578 --> 00:48:23,212
<i>- he was so young, just a boy.
- Hey, that's my hat.</i>

482
00:48:23,214 --> 00:48:26,248
<i>And a good boy.</i>
It's me.

483
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,584
They think I'm dead.
Can you believe it?

484
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:33,287
<i>Boy, this is the best trick that's ever been
played in the history of Hannibal ever.</i>

485
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:36,556
They actually miss me.
What do you think of that?

486
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:41,260
I don't know. I ain't never been missed.
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

487
00:48:41,262 --> 00:48:45,564
<i>I can't believe he's gone. I wish I
could see him just one more time.</i>

488
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:48,366
I'd tell him
I love him.

489
00:48:48,368 --> 00:48:50,634
<i>And I'd hold him close,
and I'd kiss him...</i>

490
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:54,270
Right in front of everybody.

491
00:48:54,272 --> 00:48:57,640
Hey, I'm still here. Huck!

492
00:48:57,642 --> 00:49:00,109
<i>...His spirit,</i>

493
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:02,978
<i>a bit mischievous.</i>

494
00:49:05,082 --> 00:49:09,150
We have to admit, there's a little
bit of tom Sawyer in all of us.

495
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:14,154
I know I speak for everyone
when I say...

496
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:16,623
I am going to miss him.

497
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:19,626
I'm beginnin'
to miss me too.

498
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:25,231
<i>To accept this loss...</i> how long
you gonna make your aunt suffer?

499
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:27,933
What are you talkin' about?

500
00:49:27,935 --> 00:49:29,935
Look.

501
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:36,073
She does look kinda sad,
doesn't she?

502
00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:39,142
<i>Aunt Polly,
please don't cry.</i>

503
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:42,145
You got all these people
bawling their eyes out for ya.

504
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:46,015
- Go home, tom.
<i>- Lord, we'd give anything...</i>

505
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:49,952
To have tom back with us
right now.

506
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:52,087
<i>Amen.</i>

507
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:01,728
<i>It's tom Sawyer!</i>

508
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,401
Tom! Tom!
Oh, tom!

509
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:19,642
Hello, Becky.

510
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:27,115
Becky Thatcher!

511
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:31,451
<i>Now that you're alive again,
tom Sawyer,</i>

512
00:50:31,453 --> 00:50:34,987
you should set your mind
to being useful.

513
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:37,456
A young man doesn't want
to waste his time...

514
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:42,059
<i>Foolin' folks and
fallin' out of church ceilings.</i>

515
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,763
She is absolutely right.

516
00:50:47,765 --> 00:50:50,499
Come on. We're going home.
Ow! Ow!

517
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:55,437
<i>Aunt Polly, I just fell
15 feet onto a hard floor. Ow!</i>

518
00:50:58,275 --> 00:51:00,275
<i>I don't say it wasn't
a fine joke, tom.</i>

519
00:51:00,277 --> 00:51:02,610
<i>But to keep everybody suffering
while you had a good time!</i>

520
00:51:02,612 --> 00:51:05,312
Hang you, tom! Can't you
ever learn anything?

521
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:09,082
I've a mind to having you whitewashin'
the whole town for what you did.

522
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:11,784
Shall I get
some more soap, mother?

523
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:16,655
I don't know why you're smilin', sid.
You're next!

524
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,157
Ahh.

525
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,174
Huck, whatcha doin'?
I'm packing.

526
00:51:38,176 --> 00:51:40,576
What for?

527
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:44,346
It's time to move on
down the river. Why?

528
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:48,350
Why? 'Cause it's what I do. I never stay
long in one place. I gotta keep movin'.

529
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:52,220
What about muff Potter? We tried.
It didn't work out.

530
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:55,456
But the trial's tomorrow,
huck. But, huck...

531
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:58,091
look! I don't leave places
'cause I want to.

532
00:51:58,093 --> 00:52:02,428
I leave 'cause sooner or later they're
gonna find me and run me out.

533
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:07,165
I'm sick and tired of it, tom. I'm
gonna beat 'em to the punch this time.

534
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:14,104
I thought we was friends, huck.

535
00:52:15,107 --> 00:52:17,340
You thought wrong.

536
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,843
I ain't got no friends.
I ain't got time for 'em.

537
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:26,114
<i>But if I did have one,
I'd want him to be like you.</i>

538
00:52:32,788 --> 00:52:34,487
Hah!

539
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:55,438
<i>You lose something?</i>

540
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:01,710
It... it ain't mine.

541
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:04,379
Don't you lie to me, boy!

542
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:09,350
You know that is my marble.
Reason I didn't recognize it...

543
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,484
<i>Is I lost it two, three
months ago in a graveyard.</i>

544
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:17,423
<i>Now...</i>

545
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:19,824
Fetch me the knife.

546
00:53:22,261 --> 00:53:24,828
I said, fetch!

547
00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:40,276
<i>Give it to me.</i>

548
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:55,723
You'd like to stick
that thing in me, wouldn't ya?

549
00:53:55,725 --> 00:53:59,560
You'd like to gut me good,
wouldn't ya, boy?

550
00:54:00,496 --> 00:54:03,430
Well, here's your chance.

551
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,366
Go ahead.

552
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:10,837
I dare you.

553
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:21,347
You didn't kill me, boy.
Big mistake!

554
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:24,216
'Cause if you tell anybody
what you know,

555
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:26,818
I sure as hell
am gonna kill you!

556
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:43,466
<i>Hey, muff.</i>
Hi, tom.

557
00:54:43,468 --> 00:54:45,501
How you feelin'?

558
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,504
Not so good.

559
00:54:48,506 --> 00:54:51,473
They treatin' you okay?

560
00:54:51,475 --> 00:54:55,743
It's an awful thing
that's happened, tom,

561
00:54:55,745 --> 00:54:58,312
and now I gotta swing for it.

562
00:54:58,314 --> 00:55:01,748
Give her a try.

563
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:06,384
Maybe not.

564
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:11,989
I'm innocent.

565
00:55:11,991 --> 00:55:14,591
I didn't do it.
I swear!

566
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:17,694
I done a lot of crazy,
drunk things in my time.

567
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:20,797
But I never killed anyone. You
gotta believe me. I do, muff.

568
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,267
You do?
<i>Yep, I do, muff.</i>

569
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:27,569
How come?

570
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:31,539
Well, I know you, muff.

571
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:35,409
I mean, sure when you get drunk,
you're awful disgusting...

572
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:37,277
<i>And you smell too.</i>

573
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:41,581
But I know
you wouldn't hurt a fly.

574
00:55:46,654 --> 00:55:50,322
Oh... muff, muff,
please don't cry. Please.

575
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:55,493
You been mighty good
to me, tom.

576
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:57,962
Better than anybody else in this
town, and I'm not gonna forget it.

577
00:55:57,964 --> 00:56:00,264
<i>I swear I'm not.</i>

578
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:03,467
Let me shake your hand, tom.

579
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:06,536
<i>You'll have to come through the bars.
Mine's too big.</i>

580
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,773
Little hands.

581
00:56:13,477 --> 00:56:17,712
But I know they'd help muff
Potter a power if'n they could.

582
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:28,388
<i>Tom?</i>

583
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,456
<i>Tom? Tom!</i>

584
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,395
Why, tom, it's not bedtime
for another hour.

585
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:41,297
Are you feeling all right?

586
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:50,038
You don't have a fever.

587
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,474
What's ailing you?

588
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,744
Aunt Polly,

589
00:56:57,746 --> 00:57:00,780
what if you swore an oath...

590
00:57:00,782 --> 00:57:03,916
Promising
not to tell somethin',

591
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:08,853
but the something you promised
not to tell needs tellin'?

592
00:57:08,855 --> 00:57:11,722
<i>Hmm.</i>

593
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:14,758
<i>I guess you can't break
the oath.</i>

594
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,628
You'd drop dead and rot.
<i>Not good.</i>

595
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:22,198
And on top of that, someone will
cut your neck with a knife.

596
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,934
Not good at all!

597
00:57:26,671 --> 00:57:31,473
But if you don't tell,
somethin' worse will happen...

598
00:57:31,475 --> 00:57:34,676
To someone
who doesn't deserve it.

599
00:57:34,678 --> 00:57:40,180
<i>Tom, for as long as I can remember, you
have been nothing but trouble to me.</i>

600
00:57:42,117 --> 00:57:47,152
<i>Most of the time you are
selfish and irresponsible.</i>

601
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:52,990
But you're a good boy.
You've got a good heart.

602
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:57,727
And I believe you'll know
the right thing to do.

603
00:57:57,729 --> 00:58:00,996
And you'll do it.

604
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,867
Just follow your heart.

605
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:18,076
Muff's a goner.

606
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:21,979
And you're sure,

607
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:25,615
beyond any shadow of a doubt,

608
00:58:25,617 --> 00:58:27,883
that this is the implement...

609
00:58:27,885 --> 00:58:31,219
Upon which a transaction
resulting in purchase...

610
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:35,889
Between yourself
and the accused, as vendee,

611
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,892
took place?

612
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:43,162
I, uh... could you repeat
the question, please?

613
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:48,634
<i>You're sure
this is the knife...</i>

614
00:58:48,636 --> 00:58:50,902
You sold?
Sure, I'm sure!

615
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:52,970
Last winter.
Aha!

616
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:55,973
Last winter.

617
00:58:57,609 --> 00:59:01,911
And, um, is the beneficiary...

618
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:06,282
<i>Of the aforementioned
transaction present here today?</i>

619
00:59:06,284 --> 00:59:09,084
<i>If you're askin' me about muff
Potter, I can tell you that he...</i>

620
00:59:09,086 --> 00:59:11,920
could you, please,

621
00:59:11,922 --> 00:59:15,256
point out
the owner of this knife?

622
00:59:15,258 --> 00:59:19,159
Are you blind?
He's sittin' right there.

623
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:24,130
<i>Say the name, please.</i>

624
00:59:24,132 --> 00:59:28,267
Potter! Potter!
Muff Potter!

625
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:31,570
<i>Everyone knows
it's muff Potter.</i>

626
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:34,005
Muff Potter!

627
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:35,873
Thanking you.

628
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:39,809
<i>That will be all.
Take the witness.</i>

629
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,113
No questions.

630
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,121
So I went
on up to the cemetery.

631
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,858
I like to sit up there
and watch the stars.

632
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,728
Anyway, I saw muff drunk.

633
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,263
Real drunk and in a rage.

634
01:00:04,265 --> 01:00:08,267
And he lifted the knife...
And he stuck it in the doc.

635
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:14,706
Over and over and over.

636
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:17,809
'Bout four times
he stuck 'im...

637
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:19,910
'Til he was dead.

638
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:24,914
<i>Take the witness.</i>

639
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:29,318
No questions.
Mr. aycock,

640
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,589
I would be obliged if you would at
least pretend to defend Mr. Potter.

641
01:00:37,627 --> 01:00:40,995
<i>Order!</i>

642
01:00:40,997 --> 01:00:44,597
There will be order
in this courtroom!

643
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:50,269
You may step down.

644
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,871
<i>Thanking you,
your honor.</i>

645
01:00:52,873 --> 01:00:55,840
<i>By the oaths...</i>

646
01:00:55,842 --> 01:00:57,875
Of honest citizens...

647
01:00:57,877 --> 01:01:02,746
Whose simple word
is above suspicion,

648
01:01:02,748 --> 01:01:08,150
we have fastened this crime,
this awful crime,

649
01:01:08,152 --> 01:01:12,186
beyond all possibility
of question...

650
01:01:13,722 --> 01:01:15,822
Upon the unhappy prisoner.

651
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:22,394
<i>Muff Potter is guilty of the murder of Dr.
Jonas Robinson!</i>

652
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:31,335
We rest our case... here.

653
01:01:32,905 --> 01:01:35,672
- Well said.
<i>- That's a gift.</i>

654
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:42,410
Counsel for the defense.

655
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:46,113
Do you have a defense?

656
01:01:46,115 --> 01:01:49,416
<i>Indeed we do, your honor!</i> Good.

657
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:54,119
The defense calls to the stand
Mr. Thomas Sawyer.

658
01:01:54,121 --> 01:01:57,956
Wha...
whatcha doin'?

659
01:02:21,714 --> 01:02:24,448
Thomas Sawyer, do you solemnly
swear to tell the truth,

660
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:29,119
the whole truth and nothin' but
the truth, so help you God?

661
01:02:30,755 --> 01:02:33,155
<i>I, uh...</i>

662
01:02:33,157 --> 01:02:36,124
- I, uh...
<i>- Tom.</i>

663
01:02:36,126 --> 01:02:38,459
Do you swear to tell the truth?

664
01:02:40,296 --> 01:02:44,097
- It would certainly be the first time.
- Stop it!

665
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:45,898
I do.

666
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,834
Then have a seat, son.

667
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:54,405
<i>Mr. Sawyer, where were you the twenty-eighth
of this month at the hour of midnight?</i>

668
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:57,408
I was in the graveyard...
Sir.

669
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:00,811
What were
you doing there?

670
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:05,381
Tryin' to get rid
of warts, sir.

671
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:12,487
Were you close to the grave that
muff Potter was digging up?

672
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,160
I... I...

673
01:03:20,162 --> 01:03:22,362
<i>I...</i>

674
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:24,731
this is a waste of time.

675
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:28,501
Thomas Sawyer wouldn't know the truth
if it kicked him in the teeth.

676
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:30,836
The boy's an outright liar!

677
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:33,738
I<i> was</i> there!
I<i> saw</i> the murder!

678
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:37,007
Doc Robinson wasn't stabbed four times.
He was stabbed three times.

679
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:41,777
He is right! And I ain't
told that to a soul!

680
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:47,148
It wasn't muff.

681
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,951
Muff even tried to stop it.

682
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:55,388
But injun Joe
took muff's knife...

683
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:58,290
And stabbed the doc.

684
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:03,527
It was injun Joe.

685
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,533
Tom!

686
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:13,202
Stop right there!

687
01:04:22,178 --> 01:04:25,445
<i>Go get him! Let's go!</i>

688
01:04:28,149 --> 01:04:32,084
<i>Tom. don't just stand there.
Go after him!</i>

689
01:04:32,086 --> 01:04:34,886
All right, all right.

690
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,023
All right. He's fine.
Tom, are you all right?

691
01:04:40,025 --> 01:04:43,426
He's fine. Sit down. Sit down.
Oh, my darling!

692
01:04:43,428 --> 01:04:48,097
Good job. Yes, sir.
<i>he's a brave boy.</i>

693
01:04:57,906 --> 01:05:00,039
Hey, Joe!

694
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:03,008
Gonna do some diggin' without me?
<i>No, Joe. I was, uh...</i>

695
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:07,812
I was just gettin' these tools together in
case you come back. Oh, am I glad to see ya!

696
01:05:07,814 --> 01:05:10,147
I don't think
you're glad to see me.

697
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:13,383
I think you was gonna go to
number two under the cross...

698
01:05:13,385 --> 01:05:15,551
And get the treasure
for yourself!

699
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:20,288
I wouldn't cheat ya!

700
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:23,725
That's right.

701
01:05:23,726 --> 01:05:27,161
<i>You wouldn't cheat me 'cause you're
smart enough to know if you ever did,</i>

702
01:05:30,566 --> 01:05:32,966
<i>I just might have to kill you.</i>

703
01:05:36,271 --> 01:05:39,038
<i>Injun Joe's far, far away from here.
Believe me, tom.</i>

704
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,440
<i>And Mary's taking
the flowers as usual.</i>

705
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:45,577
I'll need you and sid to carry the jam. Tom,
mind you don't eat any on the way there.

706
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:50,014
<i>I ain't goin'.
</i> You're not going to the picnic?

707
01:05:50,016 --> 01:05:54,985
<i>Shut your head, sid.</i> Tom, now I
know you're scared, and rightly so.

708
01:05:54,987 --> 01:05:59,289
But right now you're a glittering hero, and
the whole town'll be wantin' to see you.

709
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:02,358
It's not your place to be
worrying about that injun Joe.

710
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:07,596
I hear a detective came up from St.
Louis. They say he found a clue.

711
01:06:07,598 --> 01:06:11,099
Yeah, well, you can't
hang a clue for murder.

712
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:13,367
Did you hear that?

713
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:17,138
<i>What?
</i> I thought I heard somethin'.

714
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,975
- Where?
- Maybe...

715
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,177
At the front door.

716
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:26,180
Well, go see, sid.

717
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,588
<i>One moment, please!</i>

718
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:41,427
Oh, tom, there's an Indian
gentleman to see you.

719
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:48,599
Tom! Wha...
tom! Sid!

720
01:07:39,512 --> 01:07:42,079
Shh.

721
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:44,514
<i>You scared?</i>

722
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:46,582
You should be.

723
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:49,518
Huck, what are you doin'?

724
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,721
Remember this? Yeah.
But, huck...

725
01:07:52,723 --> 01:07:57,225
according to this, you should be
dead and rottin' right about now.

726
01:07:57,227 --> 01:08:01,629
I had to help muff.

727
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:04,398
Not helpin' him
would've been wrong.

728
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,267
I know, but...
You swore an oath, tom.

729
01:08:07,269 --> 01:08:11,604
Don't that mean anything to ya?

730
01:08:11,606 --> 01:08:15,407
Yeah, of course it does.

731
01:08:15,409 --> 01:08:19,244
It's just...

732
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:22,180
it just felt like
the right thing to do.

733
01:08:23,716 --> 01:08:26,650
Huck, it was the right
thing to do. No!

734
01:08:26,652 --> 01:08:30,720
You swore an oath, tom.
You swore!

735
01:08:30,722 --> 01:08:33,322
What was I supposed to do, huh?

736
01:08:33,324 --> 01:08:35,557
Just lay back and let muff Potter swing?
You tell me, huck!

737
01:08:35,559 --> 01:08:39,360
You know you ain't never been in
more trouble than you are right now!

738
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:44,264
- Injun Joe's gonna kill you.
- You think I don't know that?

739
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:48,801
Just don't expect me to stick around
and save your little neck this time.

740
01:08:48,803 --> 01:08:51,303
I don't.

741
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:53,805
Good.
'Cause I ain't goin' to.

742
01:08:53,807 --> 01:08:56,674
Then why'd ya come back?

743
01:08:56,676 --> 01:08:59,143
I don't know.

744
01:08:59,145 --> 01:09:01,879
To tell you to be careful.

745
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:04,514
I've been to your funeral once.

746
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:07,550
<i>I ain't goin' again.</i>

747
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:19,293
Huck! Hey, huck!

748
01:09:21,297 --> 01:09:23,530
<i>Muff Potter's my friend.</i>

749
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,135
When a friend's in trouble,
you can't run away.

750
01:09:44,517 --> 01:09:47,684
<i>If you go to the crossroads
and you listen to the wind,</i>

751
01:09:47,686 --> 01:09:51,821
it'll tell you all the important things that are
gonna happen to ya in the next twelve months.

752
01:09:51,823 --> 01:09:55,858
<i>Now, you may be wantin' to tell,
you may be wantin' to fuss...</i>

753
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:10,204
Hmm?

754
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:18,812
<i>Come back here.
I'm gonna get you!</i>

755
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:22,215
<i>Tom, don't...
sid, now don't...</i>

756
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:27,219
Come back here!
I'm not done with you yet!

757
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:36,461
I sow hemp seed; And he
who is to be my husband,

758
01:10:36,463 --> 01:10:40,531
let him come and harrow it.

759
01:10:40,533 --> 01:10:43,600
Look into the mirror, and you shall
see the form of your husband.

760
01:10:47,738 --> 01:10:51,372
<i>Come and get some pie, gals.</i>

761
01:10:55,811 --> 01:11:00,280
<i>Come on, sid! Come here.
Got another spider for ya!</i>

762
01:11:00,282 --> 01:11:02,582
<i>Na-na-na-na.</i>

763
01:11:02,584 --> 01:11:04,850
Hey, Becky.

764
01:11:07,354 --> 01:11:09,520
Oh, no!

765
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:11,622
What? What'd I do? We're
gonna be married.

766
01:11:11,624 --> 01:11:14,524
Huh? You needn't look
so disappointed.

767
01:11:14,526 --> 01:11:16,992
I don't like it
any better than you do!

768
01:11:21,898 --> 01:11:24,465
<i>Every one of 'em was dead.</i>

769
01:11:24,467 --> 01:11:27,701
<i>And every one of 'em...
Was smilin'.</i>

770
01:11:30,639 --> 01:11:34,007
Well, I run out of stories.

771
01:11:34,009 --> 01:11:38,744
How 'bout we go
look at the cave?

772
01:11:40,814 --> 01:11:44,916
Come on, boys and girls,
let's go look at that cave!

773
01:12:30,796 --> 01:12:34,564
<i>Everybody stay together.
No wandering off!</i>

774
01:12:34,566 --> 01:12:39,635
<i>So he said, "me?" In a silly voice.
So I said...</i>

775
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:42,404
hello, sir. This truly
is a wondrous place.

776
01:12:42,406 --> 01:12:46,074
God's own cathedral, your honor.
Well put, Mr. Potter.

777
01:12:46,076 --> 01:12:47,909
<i>Be careful, Rebecca.</i>

778
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:51,712
I will. <i>You children stay
to the forechambers.</i>

779
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,347
<i>You heard the judge.
Now, listen to him.</i>

780
01:12:54,349 --> 01:12:57,550
"Be careful, Rebecca. Stay close
to the forechamber, Rebecca."

781
01:12:57,552 --> 01:13:00,653
I'll go where I please.

782
01:13:07,494 --> 01:13:10,528
I dare ya.

783
01:13:17,402 --> 01:13:21,937
¶ Ring around the Rosie
pocketful of posies ¶

784
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:26,107
<i>¶ ashes, ashes
we all fall down ¶¶</i>

785
01:13:37,352 --> 01:13:39,552
it's beautiful.

786
01:13:39,554 --> 01:13:44,557
<i>I've been here a million times.
Satan's cathedral.</i>

787
01:13:44,559 --> 01:13:49,128
Well, I'll find a cavern you haven't
been to, and I'll name it myself!

788
01:13:50,531 --> 01:13:53,365
I'll name it myself.

789
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,054
<i>- Come on, move it. Come on.
- I'm here.</i>

790
01:14:18,056 --> 01:14:22,558
Stragglers, move on. That's it.
<i>Good-bye, muff.</i>

791
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,760
Yeah.

792
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:30,398
Yeah, that's the last of 'em.
Looks like that about does it.

793
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,435
Here, I don't mind
if I do.

794
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:37,003
I don't mind
if you do, either.

795
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:43,709
Excuse me, judge. I was
wondering if you'd seen tom.

796
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:47,012
<i>He was with my Rebecca. They were chasing
each other around in the back of the cave.</i>

797
01:14:47,014 --> 01:14:49,047
<i>I'm assuming they came out
with everybody else.</i>

798
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:52,116
What is it, sheriff?
What's wrong?

799
01:14:52,118 --> 01:14:55,486
I was out makin' my rounds, and
I seen the tavern door open.

800
01:14:55,488 --> 01:15:00,557
So I went on inside, and there he was
lying there deader than a mackerel.

801
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:03,526
Emmett. Big ol' knife hole
in his back.

802
01:15:03,528 --> 01:15:06,529
<i>Ain't but one man
throw a knife like that.</i>

803
01:15:13,137 --> 01:15:18,807
Look at this one. This one's beautiful too.
I'll name this one.

804
01:15:18,809 --> 01:15:22,010
We call it Aladdin's palace.

805
01:15:22,012 --> 01:15:23,611
Hello!

806
01:15:23,613 --> 01:15:26,180
<i>Hello!</i>

807
01:15:26,182 --> 01:15:29,683
<i>Hello!</i>

808
01:15:30,952 --> 01:15:33,052
Hello?

809
01:15:33,054 --> 01:15:35,554
Hello!

810
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:38,690
Hello!
Hello!

811
01:15:38,692 --> 01:15:41,059
Hello!
Hello!

812
01:15:41,061 --> 01:15:42,960
<i>Hello!</i>

813
01:15:42,962 --> 01:15:46,196
Hello! Hello!

814
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:50,800
Hello! Hello! No.
No, Becky, stop!

815
01:15:50,802 --> 01:15:54,103
Stop, Becky, stop! Don't
tell me what to do!

816
01:15:54,105 --> 01:15:55,904
<i>Tell me what to do.</i>

817
01:15:57,607 --> 01:15:59,607
Becky!

818
01:16:18,593 --> 01:16:22,561
<i>Gentlemen, my daughter Rebecca and tom
Sawyer are both lost in the caves.</i>

819
01:16:22,563 --> 01:16:25,964
<i>And injun Joe has come back
to take his revenge on tom.</i>

820
01:16:25,966 --> 01:16:30,568
Now, be on your guard. Injun
Joe has already killed twice.

821
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,771
The sheriff and I believe that he
will not hesitate to kill again.

822
01:16:33,773 --> 01:16:36,640
Judge? Judge.

823
01:16:36,642 --> 01:16:40,109
Judge, I'd like to help ya.

824
01:16:41,245 --> 01:16:44,746
All right, muff.
Let's go!

825
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,640
This way.

826
01:17:51,577 --> 01:17:54,744
What's this cavern called, tom?

827
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:57,979
I don't know.

828
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:17,295
It's just rock.

829
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:23,934
<i>- Judge!
- Any luck?</i>

830
01:18:23,936 --> 01:18:26,803
<i>Over here, judge.</i>

831
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:29,305
What is it, muff?
There's been a cave-in.

832
01:18:29,307 --> 01:18:32,374
There are other ways out.
Okay? N-now...

833
01:18:32,376 --> 01:18:34,642
Becky!

834
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:45,952
I, I think we're gonna be
stuck here forever.

835
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:51,290
Don't worry, Becky. I'm gonna
get you outta here. I promise.

836
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:04,935
Run, Becky, run!

837
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:20,015
Hah!

838
01:19:26,056 --> 01:19:28,189
This way! This way!

839
01:19:30,293 --> 01:19:33,260
Through here. Through here.
Go! Go!

840
01:19:33,262 --> 01:19:36,062
Hurry, hurry!
Go! Go!

841
01:19:36,064 --> 01:19:39,298
<i>Becky! Go, go.</i>

842
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,969
- Hurry up.
<i>- Tom!</i>

843
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:46,338
<i>Tom!</i>

844
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,939
Becky.

845
01:19:52,044 --> 01:19:55,545
<i>I think we lost him.</i>

846
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:36,950
<i>It's one-eyed murrell.</i>

847
01:20:36,952 --> 01:20:40,353
<i>He must've been hiding here
when the army came to get him.</i>

848
01:20:40,355 --> 01:20:45,124
<i>Looks like he got lost
and slowly... died.</i>

849
01:20:45,126 --> 01:20:47,159
Come on.

850
01:20:47,161 --> 01:20:49,194
Please be careful.

851
01:20:49,196 --> 01:20:54,165
This way, Becky. <i>Not so loud, tom.
He'll hear us.</i>

852
01:20:56,602 --> 01:21:00,170
<i>Number two under the cross!
What are you talking about?</i>

853
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,880
Becky, look!

854
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:22,857
Go on.
I'm right behind you.

855
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:30,330
Tom, come on.

856
01:21:30,332 --> 01:21:33,299
Find your father.
Bring him back.

857
01:21:34,402 --> 01:21:38,237
It's dangerous.
Hurry!

858
01:22:08,634 --> 01:22:12,935
<i>Looks like I got it all!
The treasure... and you!</i>

859
01:22:32,021 --> 01:22:34,021
<i>Hey!</i>

860
01:22:49,404 --> 01:22:51,704
I know you.

861
01:22:55,942 --> 01:22:57,975
Huck?

862
01:22:59,078 --> 01:23:02,512
You're pap finn's boy.

863
01:23:02,514 --> 01:23:05,114
Blueberry!

864
01:23:05,116 --> 01:23:07,416
Huckleberry.

865
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:13,388
Your daddy was the best knife
fighter on the Mississippi.

866
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,257
Did he teach you?

867
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:18,292
He taught me.

868
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:20,127
Ah.

869
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:25,298
Then let's see what you got,
river trash.

870
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,301
I ain't river trash!
Come on!

871
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:37,208
You got guts, boy!

872
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:40,978
And in a minute,
they're gonna be on the ground.

873
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:44,114
Let's see you hit this!

874
01:24:31,026 --> 01:24:35,060
So, why'd you come back, huck?

875
01:24:36,463 --> 01:24:39,664
When a friend's in trouble,
you don't run away.

876
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:52,709
I guess
injun Joe got his treasure.

877
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:55,378
No, no, he didn't.

878
01:24:58,383 --> 01:25:03,318
The chest, I couldn't lift it.
It was too heavy.

879
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:07,322
I had to dump out
all the coins.

880
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:16,730
<i>Here comes our hero!
There he is!</i>

881
01:25:16,732 --> 01:25:19,165
Gimme your hand.

882
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:25,604
It's all right.
Come on out.

883
01:25:25,606 --> 01:25:31,108
Bring 'em over here.
You're a good boy!

884
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:34,244
Three cheers. Three cheers for
the richest boys in Hannibal.

885
01:25:34,246 --> 01:25:40,115
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

886
01:25:40,117 --> 01:25:42,416
Thank you, judge.
Thank you.

887
01:25:45,254 --> 01:25:48,321
Young man,
what's to become of you?

888
01:25:48,323 --> 01:25:51,123
Have you begun to think
about your future?

889
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:54,159
No, ma'am. I never really
much had a future.

890
01:25:54,161 --> 01:25:58,362
Well, you've got one now.
And you best begin!

891
01:26:01,867 --> 01:26:04,701
<i>You are indeed our hero, tom!</i>

892
01:26:04,703 --> 01:26:09,505
<i>You're a hero, tom.
You made the front page!</i>

893
01:26:09,507 --> 01:26:12,140
Congratulations.
So proud.

894
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:18,711
<i>Fine boy, tom.
Mighty nice.</i>

895
01:26:20,648 --> 01:26:23,882
Hannibal's proud
of our fine young man.

896
01:26:49,741 --> 01:26:51,907
Huck! Hey, huck!

897
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:58,245
<i>Hey, who are you?
What are you doin' here?</i>

898
01:26:58,247 --> 01:27:00,814
- Huck?
- What do you think?

899
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:04,484
Well, I think one of us
has lost his mind.

900
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:08,654
The widow Douglas
is gonna adopt me.

901
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:12,591
The widow?

902
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:24,769
You're givin' all this up,
move into town?

903
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:27,772
Why not? Why not? I'll
tell you why not.

904
01:27:27,774 --> 01:27:30,407
Huck finn goin' to church?
Huck finn goin' to school?

905
01:27:30,409 --> 01:27:34,377
I start tomorrow mornin'.
I gotta sit down.

906
01:27:34,379 --> 01:27:36,278
Huck?

907
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,515
<i>Huck, say it ain't so.
</i> I gotta get goin'.

908
01:27:40,517 --> 01:27:42,316
I promised the widow I'd take
her to the church social.

909
01:27:42,318 --> 01:27:45,485
Church social?

910
01:27:45,487 --> 01:27:47,620
All right, that's it!
That tears it!

911
01:27:47,622 --> 01:27:52,291
I ain't gonna stop ya. I'm stayin' here.
Somebody's gotta carry on.

912
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:58,230
Suit yourself, tom.
I hope things work out for ya.

913
01:27:58,232 --> 01:28:01,299
Nights out here get awful cold.

914
01:28:01,301 --> 01:28:04,502
Well, you know where to find me
if you change your mind.

915
01:28:04,504 --> 01:28:07,805
And you know where to find me.

916
01:28:17,816 --> 01:28:20,950
Huck!

917
01:28:20,952 --> 01:28:23,319
Huck, wait for me!

918
01:28:23,321 --> 01:28:27,690
You comin' along?

919
01:28:27,692 --> 01:28:32,628
I guess I got to. Somebody's
gotta look out for ya.

920
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:36,465
Civilization can be
a pretty dangerous place.

921
01:28:36,467 --> 01:28:38,867
So...

922
01:28:38,869 --> 01:28:42,303
You ready to go put some gray
hairs on your aunt's head?

923
01:28:42,305 --> 01:28:44,772
Whatcha got in mind?

924
