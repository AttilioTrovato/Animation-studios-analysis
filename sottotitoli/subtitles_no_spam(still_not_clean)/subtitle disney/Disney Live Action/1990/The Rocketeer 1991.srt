1
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,780
<i>Sinclair, is it you?</i>

2
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,320
<i>Why did you call?</i>

3
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,070
<i>Where are you?</i>

4
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,770
A NEW BEGINNING

5
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,270
TODAY EUROPE, TOMORROW THE WORLD

6
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,270
Assault Division!

7
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,770
Attack!

8
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:29,520
Move, move! Let's go!

9
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,830
- Seize the rocket! Now!
- Aye aye!

10
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:24,120
Keep them at bay.

11
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:48,080
- My lord--

12
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,020
- Fast!
- Understood.

13
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,780
Don't you have the rocket?

14
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:53,800
Answer me!

15
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,480
- What is wrong?
- The rudder, I think.

16
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:48,620
- Something is wrong with the rudder here.
- Dear God!

17
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:51,290
So what? Where is he?

18
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:53,290
Are you crazy, Sinclair?
What's with the lady?

19
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,830
Keep your mouth shut.

20
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,670
You're ignoring me. I have my orders. And you, too!

21
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,870
This is your fault!

22
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,420
You...

23
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,100
Come!

24
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:41,960
Hurry up!
He's up there.

25
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:42,860
Go!
