00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,310
You're Will Stoneman?
You're a boy!

341
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,082
I sent in my entrance form
and my $50.

342
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,990
- So, I want to run the race.
- [Harper] You do, do you?

343
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,654
Might I ask, what for?

344
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:09,325
- What for? For $10,000,
that's what for.
- [Laughing]

345
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,335
[Man] That sounds good to me!

346
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,575
- How much money you got, son?
- Two dollars. Why?

347
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:23,205
I'm afraid the penalty
for late registration is $10.

348
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,272
[Audience] Ooh!

349
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,284
I'll give you
the $2 I've got now...

350
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,515
and the rest I'll pay
from my winnings.

351
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,921
I know what you're doing
and I don't like it.
It's just 'cause I'm a kid.

352
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,392
Wait!

353
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,726
The Kane Newspaper Syndicate will
cover the boy's registration fee.

354
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,698
Now, Mr. Kingsley...

355
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,362
Sir, if this young man
is not allowed to compete...

356
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,168
twenty million Americans
who daily read Kane papers...

357
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,709
- will loudly cry, "Foul!"
- Here, here!

358
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:56,042
You're prepared to risk
this young man's life to
sell some newspapers?

359
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,674
[Whispering] If it gets me back to
a warm office in Chicago I am.

360
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,718
- Son, how old are you?
- Almost eighteen.

361
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,582
This young man may be fighting
Germans in a trench soon, Harper.

362
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,457
A lot farther from home
than he is right now.

363
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,929
And you're saying he's not
man enough to run a dog race!

364
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:18,332
- Let the kid race.
- Let him race. He won't last
through the first day.

365
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,837
I'll last as long as
any man here, including you.

366
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,840
[Kingsley]
What's it gonna be, Mr. Harper?

367
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,274
One more racer...

368
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:31,338
- or 20 million angry readers?
- [Crowd] Let him race!

369
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,409
[Crowd Jeering]

370
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,487
- Let him race!
- Let him race!

371
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,997
Take a seat, lad.
Someone get him a packet.

372
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,192
- Get the kid a cigar too.
- Music!

373
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,328
[Music] My name is Kaiser Bill
I'm the fella you want to kill [music]

374
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,601
Hey, kid.

375
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,608
Son, look, have a cigar.

376
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,873
- [Music]But I hear a voice
of freedom calling [music]
- [Laughing]

[Music] Far across the sea [music]

378
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,982

- Hi. Hi.

00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,816
- [Music] To me [music]
- Whoa!

380
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:15,723
[Music] Go home, Kaiser Bill
Pack up your guns and beer [music]

381
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,025
[Music] Pack up your guns and beer
Get yourself on out of here [music]

382
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,966
[Music] Go home, Kaiser Bill
Better not test our will [music]

383
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:29,132
[Music] We've almost had our fill
Go home, Kaiser Bill [music]

[Music][music] [Singing]

386
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,114
Not another word to
these parasites, kid.
You're Kane property now.

387
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,915
- I'm nobody's property.
- It's just a figure
of speech, that's all.

388
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:47,321
Just make sure you talk
to me before them.
Harry Kingsley, at your service.

389
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,326
Sorry, I gave 'em away
to all the ladies.

390
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,386
You sure you want to sell
your soul to this devil?

391
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,431
All I know is
he put up my fee.

392
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,433
- I'm not here to sell anything.
- Of course you're not.

393
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,231
- Boy's got integrity.
- You'll cure him of that in no time.

394
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,464
That's cute.

395
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,903
Drink it. Can't trust
a man that doesn't drink.

396
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,072
To the best eight dollar
investment I ever made.

397
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:16,078
- [Coughing]
- Can't die on me now, kid.

398
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:20,181
- I never drank before.
- You never raced before, either.

399
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,091
Uh, can I ask you something?

400
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,358
- Why'd you help me?
- Helping you is helping myself.

401
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,626
Having you in the race gives me
something to write about.

402
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,466
- Gotta sell newspapers, kid.
- [Music][music] [Singing]

403
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,439
Oh, I see it's the first time
for a lot of things, huh?

404
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,634
Get an eyeful, 'cause you
won't be seeing anything...

405
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:42,770
- but the butts on your dogs
for some time.
- Oh, my dogs!

- Ah, back off!
- Hey, don't kick my dog, mister!

410
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,145
Then you shut your dog up!

411
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,515
Your dog started the trouble.

412
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,885
- You okay, Gus?
- So...

413
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,084
you think you gonna last
as long as me, huh?

414
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,185
Boyca!

415
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,965
You ever had frostbite?

416
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,661
You will,
you run this race.

417
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:45,074
Yeah, the mercury drop
to 30 below.

418
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,611
Forty below sometime.

419
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:52,172
Your fingers and toes,
they gonna look like this.

420
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,980
Yeah.

421
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,453
This race, boy...

422
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,686
this is the meanest stretch
of land God ever put together.

423
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:07,026
Good men have died out there.

424
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,067
When you get the frostbite,
you call me.

425
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,659
I cut off anything you want.

426
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,671
No charge.

427

[McPherson]
Don't give me an excuse, Borg.

428
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,835
You got a little frostbite
on the brain, don't you?

429
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,642
What you say to me?

430
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:28,048
I said, don't let me catch you
irritating my countryman again.
Now, get!

431
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,053
Come on, Joe.

432
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,420
I was just having fun
with the boy.

433
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,722
Remember to call me
if you need anything cut off.

434
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,319
[Chuckling]

435
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,700
Stay away from him. Mean.

436
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,467
Got a little timber wolf
not far down the family tree.
You all right?

437
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,371
Yeah, we're okay.

438
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,740
All right. Take care.

439
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,779
Thanks.

440
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,518
[Harper] I require
a gentleman's promise
from each of you.

441
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,619
You will not try to steal
my chef. He is world class.

442
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,630
Although, at the end
of the journey...

443
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:17,429
since I've laid in
some excellent vintages...
Thank you, Abdul.

444
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,766
I'll make a gift of them to you
if we have any left over.

445
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:25,172
In the meantime,
you'll find this cognac
more than satisfactory.

446
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,906
Elevated only by the taste
of my imported Havana cigars.

447
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,108
You should not have let him
enter,J.W., reporter or not.

448
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,050
I was not about to let Kingsley
ruin the reputation of the race!

449
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,020
Whatever he might have done,
it'll be nothing compared to...

450
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,957
what you'll face if that boy
gets himself killed.

451
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,985
We'll let the boy race
for a day, then find some
reason to disqualify him.

452
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,931
Didn't you want to take on
the world at that age?
Let the boy have a day!

453
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,595
- If he lasts that long.
- I'll bet $500 he does.

454
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,299
You two have already bet
over $5,000, Jonah.

455
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,434
- Then you're not gonna miss
another $500, are you?
- Right!

456
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,501
- Oh!
- It's $ 1,000...

457
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,513
- says he won't make Heartbreak Hill.
- No.

458
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,778
Yes. You're on.

459
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,419
Ahh. I couldn't
have dreamed all this.

460
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,450
Can't wait to tell Ward.

461
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,189
Tell you something,
though, Gus.

462
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:27,203
Ned's right. Got to stay away
from those racers.

How 'bout acting like
I'm the boss tomorrow, huh?

in the lead!

Hey, the kid's in the lead.

508
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:57,032
- You think your boy's
got a chance?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

509
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,904
If I convince 20 million

If he can make it through
that and Devil's Run...

512

you might get that desk
after all.

We'll give 'em something
to talk about back home!
