00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THE THREE MUSKETEERS (2011)

2
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,031
Cardinal Richelieu,
these men, they...

3
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,517
Please help me, Your Eminence.
Please, please have mercy. Please.

4
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,713
He defaced your carriage and
stole valuables from inside.

5
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,274
But it's just a coach.
Please, I was hungry.

6
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,868
My family hasn't eaten
for days. Please.

7
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,753
Please. In the name of God,
I beg you.

8
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,199
Very well.
In the name of God.

9
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,714
Oh, thank you,
Your Eminence.

10
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,792
Your place in heaven
will always be assured.

11
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,711
Of course.

12
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,592
No. No. Don't!
No, please!

13
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,910
Please, God.
No! No!

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,036
One less mouth to feed.

15
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,872
Getting sloppy, Girard.
Why don't you do yourself a favour?

16
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,190
- Surrender.
- My sister's honour is at stake.

17
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,788
How many times do I have to
tell you? Nothing happened.

18
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,072
- I know what I saw, D'Artagnan.
- Girard, I told her I was leaving for Paris.

19
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,997
She wanted to give me something
to remember her by.

20
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,237
- Liar!
- This is stupid, Girard.

21
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,473
All I want to do is get to Paris
and join the Musketeers.

22
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,592
You, a Musketeer?
Fantasy!

23
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,110
My father was a Musketeer,
the King's personal bodyguard.

24
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,674
The King was assassinated.
Your father was a failure...

25
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,228
a disgrace
to the Musketeers.

26
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,239
- What did you say?
- Your father was a disgrace.

27
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,237
My brothers will avenge me.

28
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,791
Already?

29
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,634
Charge! Charge!

30
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,916
Get him!
He's mine!

31
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,396
Come back!

32
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,830
He went that way!

33
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,353
We'll get you,
D'Artagnan!

34
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,029
In the meantime, give
my regards to your sister.

35
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,437
What should I do
with the Musketeer flag?

36
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,470
Burn it.

37
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,877
Musketeers.

38
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,516
By joint edict of His Majesty
the King, Louis Xlll...

39
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,029
and His Eminence
Cardinal Richelieu...

40
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,396
the Musketeers are
officially disbanded.

41
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,436
In preparation for
the coming war with England...

42
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,632
the ranks and commissions are forthwith
transferred to the infantry.

43
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,673
You'll be notified
and told where to report.

44
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,590
Until such time,
return to your homes.

45
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,229
- And who will protect the King?
- The Cardinal's guards...

46
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,470
have already assumed
that responsibility.

47
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,431
You are ordered
to disperse.

48
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,873
Should even one of you resist,
the entire corps...

49
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,911
will be arrested
and imprisoned.

50
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,469
All for one...

51
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,397
and one for all.

52
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,238
Well, there's nothing more
to be said, is there?

53
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,434
Your Eminence.

54
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,435
An impressive performance.
I especially admired that last touch.

55
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,394
"All for one
and one for all. "

56
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,916
If I didn't know better, I should have
thought you wanted them to riot.

57
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,032
It would have given us
an excuse to arrest them.

58
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,230
Hardly necessary.

59
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,316
The Musketeers
are finished.

60
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,035
Not entirely.
There are three.

61
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,357
Three?

62
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,074
I sent a patrol to find them.
They haven't returned yet.

63
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,272
I want those Musketeers,
not excuses.

64
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,510
Bring them in at once.

65
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,671
Follow me.

66
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,595
No loose ends this time,
Captain Rochefort.

67
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,637
Athos.

68
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,557
Porthos.

69
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,477
Aramis.

70
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,317
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

71
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,432
I've saved you and your friend
from these bandits.

72
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,397
These "bandits" are
the Queen's own bodyguards.

73
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,433
The Queen? I'm sorry.
I- I had no idea.

74
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,438
- What's your name?
- D'Artagnan.

75
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,279
D'Artagnan.
A Gascon?

76
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,153
I've come to Paris
to join the Musketeers.

77
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,596
Then I'm sure I'll be
hearing your name again.

78
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,790
- Would that please you?
- Ladies-in-waiting...

79
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,195
are forbidden to socialize
with Musketeers.

80
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,072
I'm not a Musketeer yet.

81
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,914
With that kind of courage,
you will be one soon enough.

82
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,991
Good luck, D'Artagnan.

83
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,833
And thank you for the entertainment.
I enjoyed it immensely.

84
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,550
Wait! You didn't
tell me your name!

85
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,796
Constance!

86
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,714
Constance.

87
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,557
Come along.

88
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,235
Is this Musketeer
Headquarters?

89
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,479
No, this was
Musketeer Headquarters.

90
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,114
Oh, you mean
it's been moved.

91
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,113
No, I mean the Musketeers have been
disbanded. They no longer exist.

92
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,800
Feel free to poke around
for souvenirs if you wish.

93
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,032
But I just got here. How am I supposed to
become a Musketeer if they've been disbanded?

94
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,515
I say you've got
quite a problem.

95
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,431
You're not being
very helpful.

96
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,717
You need a lesson
in manners, boy.

97
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,637
Anytime.

98
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,756
Why don't you meet me outside
the city, by the ruins?

99
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,671
Let's say noon.

100
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,876
I'll be there!

101
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,637
There he is.

102
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,069
Come on. Out of my way, man!
Out of my way!

103
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,476
How dare you touch me!
D'Artagnan!

104
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,433
Get your hands off me!
D'Artagnan!

105
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,318
- D'Artagnan!
- Here. Hold this horse for me, all right?

106
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,709
I'll be right back.
You got it? Thank you.

107
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,517
My word!

108
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,594
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Excuse me!

109
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,519
This sash was a gift to me
from the Queen of America.

110
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,391
There's no Queen of America.

111
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,516
I beg to differ, infant.

112
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,637
We're on quite intimate terms,
unless you can prove otherwise.

113
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,955
Here's my proof.

114
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,909
Oh, I see. It's twit of the month,
come to challenge the mighty Porthos.

115
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,312
- Thinks he's lightning with a sword.
- With the mighty who?

116
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,830
- Don't tell me you've never heard of me.
- The world's biggest windbag?

117
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,557
Little pimple...

118
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,478
meet me behind
the Luxembourg at 1:00...

119
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,358
and bring a long wooden box.

120
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,476
Bring your own.

121
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,239
"The Lord God took the man and put him in
the garden to till it and care for it...

122
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,033
but of the fruit of the tree,
which is in the midst of the garden...

123
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,833
God hath said,
'Ye shall not eat of it.

124
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,033
Neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die. '

125
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,549
And the serpent said
unto the woman, 'Ye... "

126
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,031
Madam, I'm flattered, but I am
here to tutor you in theology.

127
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,711
Forgive me, Monsieur Aramis, but when
you started talking about original sin...

128
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,070
I lost control
and became impassioned.

129
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,352
It won't happen again.
Please go on.

130
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,837
Well, there's nothing unholy
about expressing one's emotions.

131
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,115
On the contrary, religion
should be experienced...

132
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,196
in an all-embracing way.

133
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,550
We should feel free to express
our spirituality.

134
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,478
Yes, darling.

135
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,875
- Let me in!
- My husband!

136
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,150
- You're married?
- Yes, I'm married.

137
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,113
Oh. We must pray
for our sins.

138
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,556
On second thought,
God's often busy.

139
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,471
Out of my way, woman!

140
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,391
No!

141
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,595
Thank you. You broke
my fall perfectly.

142
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,593
- But I do apologize for the inconvenience.
- Get off me!

143
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,148
- If there's one thing I can't abide, it's rudeness.
- You fell on me.

144
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,676
- And I apologized for it.
- Well, your apology's not accepted.

145
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,751
I hope your sword
is as quick as your mouth.

146
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,994
- It's quicker.
- Ah. A duel then.

147
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,957
A duel.

148
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,197
Meet me behind the Carmes-Deschaux
Monastery at 2:00.

149
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,151
- I'll be there.
- As will I.

150
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,350
Three duels in one day.

151
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,394
- Homesick?
- Cardinal Richelieu.

152
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,317
You surprised me.

153
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,238
I often have
that effect on people.

154
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,794
I can't imagine why.

155
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,993
I'm really a very
gentle person.

156
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,477
You seem a little unhappy
in your new home.

157
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,751
Lonely.
Is that the same thing?

158
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,071
Austria's loss
is France's gain.

159
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,236
I'm not sure the King
shares your opinion.

160
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,635
We've barely spoken
since our wedding day.

161
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,794
Whenever we're together,
he seems so... uncertain.

162
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,678
Arranged marriages
can be difficult.

163
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,109
Your father and I
thought yours...

164
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,113
would bring Austria and France
closer together.

165
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,272
Countries align more swiftly
than people, I'm afraid.

166
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,197
What a pity.

167
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,749
Love is, I think...

168
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,514
wasted on the young.

169
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,033
His Majesty, the King.

170
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,358
Cardinal Richelieu,
I've been looking for you.

171
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,598
- Your Majesty.
- Anne. I didn't know you were here.

172
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,077
- W-Would you like me to go?
- No. Please stay.

173
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,034
- Your Eminence, I demand an answer.
- Perhaps if I knew the question.

174
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,038
I just learned that you went ahead
and disbanded my Musketeers.

175
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,510
- You approved the decision.
- But not the timing.

176
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,513
I intended to address them myself
and explain the situation.

177
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,229
These men are not just my
personal guards. They are my friends.

178
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,756
A thousand apologies,
Your Majesty.

179
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,718
We are on the brink
of war with England.

180
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,799
The Duke of Buckingham plans
to invade La Rochelle within the month.

181
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,436
We'll need the Musketeers in
the field if we are to defeat him.

182
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,994
I thought it best
to act quickly.

183
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,554
I will be the judge
of what is best...

184
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,790
for me and for France.

185
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,555
Of course.
Forgive me.

186
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,714
He is becoming as troublesome
as his father.

187
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,751
He's a foolish boy
and barely that.

188
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,836
That foolish boy
is about to become a man...

189
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,559
which is all the more reason
for us to act quickly.

190
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,632
- Have our loose ends been tied up?
- Two patrols have been sent.

191
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,350
I trust, Captain Rochefort, that you
are doing everything in your power...

192
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,755
to rid us of these rebels.

193
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,152
Don't let having only one eye
impair your vision.

194
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,750
The loss of the other
would be most inconvenient.

195
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,630
What is this?

196
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,196
We were having a private party
celebrating the demise of the Musketeers.

197
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,517
- Go away.
- Athos, is that any way to greet our guests?

198
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,677
Gentlemen, don't be shy.
Come in.

199
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,558
- Your friends have been expecting you.
- You're under arrest.

200
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,949
Under whose authority?

201
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,871
Mine.

202
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,554
Hello again, Cyclops.

203
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,716
Let's see, when was the last time
we had the pleasure of his company?

204
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,473
I believe it was the day he was
cast out of the Musketeers.

205
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,155
Conduct unbecoming a Musketeer.
That was the charge, was it not?

206
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,073
You should know.
Three of you stood against me.

207
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,873
- It was the least we could do.
- You are hereby ordered...

208
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,270
to surrender your tunics
and your commissions at once.

209
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,112
You can, of course, refuse...

210
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,596
become outlaws,
hunted men.

211
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,837
But why not
come along quietly...

212
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,951
for old times' sake?

213
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,873
- Did I miss anyone?
- Congratulations, Porthos.

214
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,394
- You brought down the house.
- Oh, drat.

215
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,199
I was trying
to hit Rochefort.

216
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,711
You go back and
you tell the Cardinal...

217
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,277
we will continue to perform our sworn
duty, which is to protect the King.

218
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,188
And we will use every means
within our power to fight him.

219
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,675
Bold words.

220
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,473
I look forward to ramming them
down your throat.

221
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,428
Rochefort. Isn't that
a smelly kind of a cheese?

222
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,314
Your manners have not
improved yet. You're late.

223
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,277
Are you in a hurry to die?

224
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,076
Here come
the grave diggers now.

225
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,635
Athos, you cannot
fight this boy.

226
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,597
- Why not?
- I'm fighting him.

227
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,359
- Not until 1:00.
- I have a duel with him too.

228
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,710
Not until 2:00.

229
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,196
Let's get on with it then.

230
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,078
Wouldn't want you to be late
for your future engagements.

231
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,799
You're a Musketeer?

232
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,031
- You're all Musketeers?
- You choose your opponents well.

233
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,436
- Or should I say foolishly?
- I've been looking all over for you.

234
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,233
Now you've found us. We have
some business to attend to...

235
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,709
unless, of course, you'd like
to make it for a later date.

236
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,637
No. I'm a man of honour.

237
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,150
But believe me when I say that
killing you will bring me no pleasure.

238
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,077
I'll be with you gentlemen
in a moment.

239
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,794
- Oh, he's a feisty little fellow.
- Feisty indeed.

240
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,636
There they are!

241
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,835
Only a fool would try
and arrest us twice in one day.

242
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,754
- You're under arrest.
- A fool.

243
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,677
The boy's of no interest to me.
He's free to go.

244
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,836
You coming peacefully,
or do you intend to resist?

245
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,988
Oh, don't be so stupid. Of course we intend
to resist. Just give us a moment, all right?

246
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,716
Five of them, three of us.
Hardly seems fair.

247
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,637
Maybe we should give them
a chance to surrender.

248
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,751
- Excuse me, but there's four of us.
- It's not your fight.

249
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,637
You're not a Musketeer.

250
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,433
I may not wear the tunic, but I believe
I have the heart of a Musketeer.

251
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,391
- Warrior.
- Poet.

252
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,954
- You got a name, boy?
- D'Artagnan.

253
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,597
- Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
- Hello.

254
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,915
- Nice to meet you again.
- Pleasure.

255
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,634
Everyone acquainted?

256
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,751
Now we are prepared
to resist you.

257
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,028
God, I love my work.

258
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,957
Take a look
at our young friend.

259
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,630
By god, he's still alive.

260
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,076
May the Lord forgive you for
any sins you may have committed.

261
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,991
Amen.

262
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,035
What's he doing?

263
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,675
Last rites. Aramis takes death
very seriously.

264
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,276
- Is he a priest?
- He used to be one of the Cardinal's students.

265
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,197
You, boy...

266
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,359
are arrogant, hot-tempered
and entirely too bold.

267
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,675
I like that.
Reminds me of me.

268
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,753
Don't encourage him. By helping us, the
boy has made himself an outlaw as well.

269
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,713
- Not if he leaves Paris right now.
- I can't leave now.

270
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,439
- I just got here.
- Go home. Find a wench.

271
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,471
Raise fat babies.
Live a good, long life.

272
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,711
What about the motto of the Musketeers:
"All for one and one for all"?

273
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,912
Wake up, boy.
The Musketeers are just a dream.

274
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,555
Halt!

275
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,873
Long live the Musketeers!

276
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,791
He's mine.

277
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,560
Go on. Get out of here.
Go on!

278
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,590
- My sword!
- It's magnificent.

279
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,353
Where did you steal it?

280
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,471
It belonged to my father.

281
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,357
Your father?

282
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,790
Well, now it belongs to me.

283
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,990
I collect swords, you see.

284
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,913
I take them from
men I've killed.

285
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,389
- Well, I'm not dead yet.
- You and the Musketeers...

286
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,832
are responsible for the killing of the
Cardinal's guards, an offence punishable by death.

287
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,190
They interrupted a duel
we were fighting.

288
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,430
A deed also punishable
by death.

289
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,755
It's been a busy day.

290
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,509
Tell me where to find
the Musketeers...

291
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,234
and I will give you back
your father's sword.

292
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,716
Give me back my father's sword,
and I'll cut out your heart.

293
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,234
Idiot.

294
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,157
Like your father.

295
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,996
- Take him below.
- Yes, sir.

296
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,311
Hey, boy!

297
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,716
Leave us.

298
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,830
Milady de Winter.

299
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,511
Your Eminence.

300
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,036
Your beauty would make even
the most chaste of men...

301
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,630
think of... impurity.

302
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,832
I don't believe you suffer
the burden of chastity.

303
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,035
Perhaps you're right.

304
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,354
I was making an observation,
not an offer.

305
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,471
A word of caution, Milady.

306
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,599
A snap of my fingers, and you could
be back on the block where I found you.

307
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,280
And with a flick
of my wrist...

308
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,470
I could change
your religion.

309
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,511
You're very persuasive.

310
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,878
For a moment I forgot that your lovers
have a tendency to end up dead.

311
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,077
Love has its risks.

312
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,151
So does duty.

313
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,708
The precision with which you
disposed of your husband...

314
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,957
or should I say your
ex-husband, Lord de Winter...

315
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,957
was commendable.

316
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,156
Not to mention
helpful to our cause.

317
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,794
- I do what is necessary.
- Yes.

318
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,789
I have a new mission which
requires your singular talent.

319
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,595
- What is it?
- You will carry this treaty to the Duke of Buckingham.

320
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,511
You're making an alliance
with England?

321
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,596
The King has
left me no choice.

322
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,429
The boy is beginning to believe that
he should rule France instead of me.

323
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,433
- God forbid.
- You're to leave at once for Calais.

324
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,988
A ship called the Persephone
will carry you to England.

325
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,230
She sails Tuesday
at midnight.

326
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,430
Buckingham's signature
must be next to mine...

327
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,715
before the King's birthday,
Friday.

328
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,637
Consider it done.

329
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,276
And doing so
will earn you...

330
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,359
the gratitude of a king.

331
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,471
Until that day,
Your Eminence.

332
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,279
Or should I say
"Your Majesty"?

333
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,591
"Majesty" sounds good.

334
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,711
Looking for me?

335
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,509
Kneel. Were you taught
no respect for a man of God?

336
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,431
Cardinal Richelieu.

337
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,715
How much did you overhear?

338
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,553
Hardly a word, Your Eminence.
The voices were much too low...

339
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,076
- and with all the noise from the prison...
- What's your name, boy?

340
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,872
D'Artagnan.

341
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,309
D'Artagnan.

342
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,398
Oh, yes. Your father
was a Musketeer.

343
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,914
He died while
protecting the King.

344
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,354
The dream of every warrior:

345
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,711
dying nobly
for King and country.

346
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,072
Tell me, D'Artagnan, what noble
business brings you here?

347
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,628
I came to join
the King's Musketeers.

348
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,948
- Bad timing.
- So I've heard.

349
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,196
Like the Knights
of the Round Table...

350
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,078
the Musketeers have
outlived their usefulness.

351
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,997
And so have
your three friends.

352
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,510
Tell me where they are,
and I will spare your life.

353
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,955
- I can't tell you what I don't know.
- Give my regards...

354
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,152
- to the headsman and your father.
- Wait!

355
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,075
- You object to losing your head?
- Yes. I like it where it is.

356
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,191
Then tell me
what I want to know...

357
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,436
and maybe you will keep it
a while longer!

358
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,869
I don't know where they are.

359
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,916
And if you did?

360
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,551
I wouldn't tell you.

361
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,111
I admire your courage,
D'Artagnan.

362
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,310
You might have made
a fine Musketeer.

363
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,432
But now we'll never know,
will we?

364
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,311
They're bringing him now.

365
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,389
It's your time, lad.
Step down.

366
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,230
Milady left at midnight
by private coach.

367
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,956
A remarkable woman. The most
beautiful I've ever known.

368
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,435
And the deadliest.

369
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,358
Which would explain
my attraction.

370
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,715
How is our young daredevil
holding up?

371
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,753
He's wishing he never heard
of the Musketeers.

372
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,080
D'Artagnan!

373
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,077
Don't lose your head!

374
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,236
Fear not, my son.
We are with you always.

375
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,151
All for one...

376
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,031
one for all.

377
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,039
Now this axe was a gift to me
from the Czarina of Tokyo.

378
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,237
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

379
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,039
My carriage!

380
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,669
Gentlemen, your carriage,
compliments of the Cardinal.

381
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,669
Stop! Follow them!
Come on! Come on!

382
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,829
D'Artagnan!

383
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,196
The Cardinal's
sacred snack chamber.

384
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,078
And what have we here?

385
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,991
Is he a man of God
or a man of gold?

386
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,233
D'Artagnan, would you be so kind
as to redistribute this wealth?

387
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,829
Throw the coins, lad.
The people are hungry.

388
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,356
Well done.

389
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,469
Those Musketeers are a menace.
They must be stopped.

390
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,233
The boy knows our plans.

391
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,880
One thousand gold pieces
on each of their heads...

392
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,797
dead or alive.

393
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,875
I prefer dead.

394
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,393
They're firing at us!

395
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,438
- Champagne?
- We're in the middle of a chase, Porthos.

396
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,279
You're right.
Something red.

397
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,790
For a chase, the Cardinal recommends
his excellent '24 cabernet.

398
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,717
You can't have any.
You're too young.

399
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,831
Take the reins, boy.

400
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,751
Thank you.

401
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,189
The picnic was delicious.
The champagne was excellent.

402
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,117
Remind me to send
the Cardinal a note.

403
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,037
The Cardinal!
We have to hurry!

404
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,391
- You two have a date?
- No, it's the Cardinal. He's conspiring against the King.

405
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,351
- Tell us something we don't know.
- He sent a messenger...

406
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,278
with a secret treaty
to a man named Buckingham.

407
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,476
- The Duke of Buckingham?
- Do you know him?

408
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,795
He rules England the way
the Cardinal rules France.

409
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,354
There's a ship called the Persephone.
It's waiting in Calais...

410
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,558
to take the messenger to England;
it sails Tuesday midnight.

411
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,636
We get that treaty, we can prove
the Cardinal guilty of treason.

412
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,557
Calais is over
200 leagues from here.

413
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,114
Is the Cardinal aware of the fact
that you have this information?

414
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,470
Yes.

415
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,951
- Turn here. Here!
- Right here?

416
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,271
That's it.
Next time you drive.

417
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,679
Give me the reins.

418
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,155
Stop in the name
of the Cardinal!

419
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,235
Over there! To your left!
Stop the Musketeers!

420
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,317
Unhitch the horses.

421
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,277
This is the end of the line, gentlemen.
I hope you enjoyed the ride.

422
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,874
- Very much so. Thank you.
- Porthos, the brandy.

423
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,428
Ooh, what a waste.

424
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,593
- Up the hill!
- They're over there!

425
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,511
- Hurry!
- It's headed for the powder wagon!

426
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,234
Run for it!

427
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,319
Run! Run!

428
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,439
Your Eminence, the Musketeers
have been sighted on the road to Calais.

429
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,511
Thanks to
our winged friends...

430
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,679
every mercenary and bounty hunter
in France will be waiting for them.

431
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,797
All for one...

432
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,150
and more for me.

433
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,514
And I said, "Marquaise...

434
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,830
as I told you
at the Sausage Festival...

435
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,872
a queen is no different
from a barmaid in the dark...

436
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,709
though less practised
in the arts of massage. "

437
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,877
Right? D'Artagnan, if you're
going to be a proper Musketeer...

438
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,316
you will have to be schooled in the
manly art of wenching. Right, ladies?

439
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,596
First subject.
Very good.

440
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,473
Very good indeed.
Let the schooling begin.

441
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,273
The secret to wenching
is in the first kiss...

442
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,029
for in that first kiss, a lasting
impression is made. Right, ladies?

443
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,630
If it is... If it is weak,
she'll think you're weak.

444
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,354
If it is comical, she'll
think you a clown. With me?

445
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,835
Weak, weak.
Comical, clown.

446
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,636
And as a Musketeer is never weak
and only rarely a clown...

447
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,315
your first kiss must be
all the things that you are.

448
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,237
Like this.

449
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,956
See? You may, uh,
speak first if you like:

450
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,031
your name, her name,
an endearment or two.

451
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,954
Trust me. Words are a complete
waste of time at this sensitive point.

452
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,072
Only the wrong words are
a complete waste of time.

453
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,472
The right words can make a more lasting
impression than a thousand of Porthos' kisses.

454
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,397
- Not likely.
- Ah, see?

455
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,317
Shall I demonstrate?

456
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,398
As morning hues of sun-swept
fire caress your passionate face...

457
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,479
alone with thee a pure desire
to worship untold grace.

458
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,716
My soul would cry
in silent prayer...

459
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,796
toward hours swept apart.

460
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,390
Your essence warms the evening air
as I dance into your heart.

461
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,315
- Shakespeare.
- Aramis.

462
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,709
- Cheating.
- It was beautiful.

463
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,234
Thank you.

464
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,750
Very well, D'Artagnan.
Your turn.

465
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,230
As morning hues
of sun-swept...

466
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,956
- Fire.
... fire caress your poisoned face...

467
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,437
Bravo!
The boy's a natural!

468
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,675
Ooh. A lively tune.
I'm inspired to dance.

469
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,315
Why is Athos
sittin' by himself?

470
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,516
He takes his drinking
very seriously.

471
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,030
Not to worry. He'll be his
usual charming self by morning.

472
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,551
Ho-ho-ho!
A lovely time.

473
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,156
Athos, why don't you
come join us?

474
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,631
You fight like a man. Let's see
if you can drink like one.

475
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,790
I'll drink anything
you put in front of me.

476
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,071
Famous last words.

477
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,437
What should we drink to?

478
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,637
Let's drink to love.

479
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,356
To love. Let me tell you
a story about love, D'Artagnan.

480
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,113
I knew a young man once,
a Count.

481
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,191
Feared he would
never fall in love.

482
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,914
One day he met a woman.
This woman was more than beautiful.

483
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,749
She was intoxicating, mysterious...
everything he'd ever dreamed of.

484
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,070
He felt his heart would burst
if he couldn't have her.

485
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,590
- What happened?
- The poor idiot married her.

486
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,757
- Isn't that what people do when they fall in love?
- Shut up and listen to me.

487
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,720
They were riding through
the forest one day.

488
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,519
She was thrown from her horse
and knocked unconscious.

489
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,154
When he rushed to her side,
he noticed a mark on her body...

490
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,955
something he'd never seen before, something
she'd managed to keep hidden all this time.

491
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,871
What was it?

492
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,791
The brand of the fleur-de-lis...

493
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,509
the mark given to those who are
to be executed for murder.

494
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,235
Count was crushed. The woman he loved,
his bride, had betrayed him.

495
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,033
She'd lied to him. When
she came to, she swore...

496
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,954
that she'd been falsely accused of
these crimes, but he didn't believe her.

497
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,640
He rejected her for
her lies and for her past.

498
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,955
Then he banished her
from his province.

499
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,755
When the guards came to take her
away, to be executed, she...

500
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,754
She was still professing
her undying love.

501
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,472
Soon after, the Count realized
how much she had meant to him...

502
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,716
but it was too late.

503
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,719
His betrayal was far greater
than hers could ever have been.

504
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,515
He gave up his title, his land,
everything he believed in...

505
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,909
never to be seen
or heard from again...

506
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,639
all because of love.

507
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,315
Whoo. May I
have this dance?

508
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,076
How's your head,
D'Artagnan?

509
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,794
I'm beginning to wish
the Cardinal had chopped it off.

510
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,950
- Would you stop whistling, please?
- I'm not whistling.

511
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,877
Well, somebody's whistling.

512
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,878
- Barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.
- I hear it too.

513
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,275
- Sounds like a...
- Cannonball!

514
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,558
Oh, I hate cannonballs.

515
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,117
- The Cardinal has a long reach.
- Get out of here!

516
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,911
Flank left.

517
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,595
Fire!

518
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,637
- There they are!
- Kill the Musketeers!

519
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,399
We'll split up.
D'Artagnan rides with me.

520
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,511
- We'll see you in Calais.
- Or hell.

521
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,317
- Split up!
- We need heads for the reward.

522
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,680
The first time
you saw D'Artagnan...

523
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,672
did you need the laces
in your corset loosened?

524
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,069
Yes. And I felt
my cheeks flush.

525
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,118
- But your hands were cold.
- My knees trembled.

526
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,668
- But your heart was pounding?
- Yes.

527
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,792
But I don't understand
why I feel this way.

528
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,879
- We only met for a moment.
- A moment is all it may take.

529
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,110
Do you think so?

530
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,751
When my father promised me
to Louis, I was furious.

531
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,912
The thought of marrying
a complete stranger...

532
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,036
someone I'd never even seen...

533
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,708
I thought
I'd never be happy...

534
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,758
and that I'd never find love.

535
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,192
But then, the first time I saw
him and our eyes met, I knew.

536
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,669
What did you know?

537
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,792
What you knew in your heart
when you first saw D'Artagnan.

538
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,717
What if he doesn't
feel the same?

539
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,031
We must never give up hope.

540
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,477
I'll get your robe.

541
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,157
What are you doing here?

542
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,475
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

543
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,795
I need your help...

544
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,912
and could not, in good
conscience, wait another minute.

545
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,110
On what matter?

546
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,629
I'm worried about
the King's happiness.

547
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,990
In what way?

548
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,913
I'm afraid he's fallen into
a dreadful melancholy...

549
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,952
and wishes to postpone
his birthday celebration.

550
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,517
Perhaps he's concerned with more important
matters, like the coming war with England.

551
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,353
Which is exactly why the
celebration must be held:

552
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,550
to show the world
that the King of France...

553
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,353
can face an enemy on any field;

554
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,351
to show France...

555
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,596
who is King.

556
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,517
He will listen to you.

557
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,751
I will talk to him.

558
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,671
Thank you.

559
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,830
I have always said...

560
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,751
that you are as intelligent...

561
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,912
as you are beautiful.

562
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,878
I am not worthy
of such a compliment.

563
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,195
Oh, but you are.

564
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,269
It is difficult to be
a man in the service of God.

565
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,471
It is assumed that certain...

566
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,397
wants...

567
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,471
desires...

568
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,358
are void from my existence.

569
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,271
But after all...

570
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,191
I am still a man.

571
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,590
Your sacrifice brings you
closer to God.

572
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,511
Yes.

573
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,158
But it is not God
to whom I wish to be close.

574
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,151
I want you to consider...

575
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,230
to know all that we might
accomplish together.

576
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,230
For France.

577
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,756
I think you should leave.

578
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,275
Remember,
kings come and kings go...

579
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,318
but one thing remains the same...

580
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,113
and that is me.

581
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,316
- Do you think we lost them?
- I don't know.

582
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,592
I hope we're close to Calais. My horse
could use a rest, and my rear is killing me.

583
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,916
You're a good man, D'Artagnan...

584
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,871
much like your father was.

585
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,388
- You knew my father?
- Only by reputation.

586
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,636
His death was mourned
by all Musketeers.

587
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,757
How did he die?

588
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,235
He uncovered a plot
to assassinate the King.

589
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,551
He was led into a trap by a fellow
Musketeer and then murdered.

590
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,868
A Musketeer?

591
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,237
There they are!

592
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,351
Well, we didn't lose them.

593
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,950
I'll try and hold them off as long
as possible. You ride on without me.

594
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,798
I can't leave you here,
not like this.

595
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,195
A Musketeer's first duty
is to protect the King.

596
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,590
You ride on to Calais
and intercept the Cardinal's messenger.

597
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,190
- There's too many of them!
- Go, or I will shoot you myself!

598
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,709
Take these.

599
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,878
Don't let me down.

600
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,596
- I'll never forget you!
- Go!

601
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,039
Back.

602
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,750
Advance.

603
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,997
Yes! Now lunge.
One, two, three, four.

604
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,149
Now disarm.

605
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,479
Excellent.

606
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,555
Forgive me for being late,
Your Majesty.

607
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,838
I was wrestling with an
important affair of state.

608
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,433
Excuse us, please.

609
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,674
Your Eminence...

610
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,712
I've been hearing some very
troubling rumours about you.

611
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,838
There are so many
to choose from.

612
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,154
Betrayal.

613
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,718
Ah, yes.
That is usually the first.

614
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,950
Let me see if
I remember it correctly.

615
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,156
While the English
attack from without...

616
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,118
the wicked Cardinal
undermines from within...

617
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,756
forging a secret alliance with Buckingham
and placing himself on the throne.

618
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,235
But, really, Your Majesty,
why stop there?

619
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,630
I have heard much more
festive variations.

620
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,553
I make oaths with pagan gods...

621
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,756
seduce the Queen
in her own chamber...

622
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,633
teach pigs to dance
and horses to fly...

623
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,548
and keep the moon carefully hidden
within the folds of my robe.

624
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,916
- Have I forgotten anything?
- It does seem rather farfetched.

625
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,956
Sire, if there are any doubts
about my loyalty...

626
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,232
they will be laid to rest when we appear
together to celebrate your birthday.

627
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,952
Ah, my birthday. You know, I've
been meaning to speak to you...

628
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,278
The Queen has just been telling
me how eager she is to attend.

629
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,153
Anne is coming?

630
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,910
The entire nation is anxious
to celebrate the birth of its King.

631
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,797
It will be an event to remember.

632
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,599
I promise.

633
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,957
Whoa. Whoa.

634
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,118
- What is it, Henri?
- There's a body in the road, Milady.

635
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,873
It's a young man.

636
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,309
He appears to be injured.

637
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,958
He's handsome.

638
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,239
Put him inside.

639
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,159
With me.

640
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,034
Welcome back.

641
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,479
Did you dream?

642
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,557
- Where am I?
- We're in Calais.

643
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,068
Calais?

644
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,793
Tuesday! Midnight!

645
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,437
Where are my clothes?

646
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,956
Do you have a name, or shall
I make one up for you?

647
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,719
My name's D'Artagnan.

648
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,071
D'Artagnan. I like that.

649
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,795
I'm the Countess De Winter.
Milady.

650
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,195
- Countess?
- By marriage.

651
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,995
- But my husband's dead.
- I'm sorry.

652
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,674
I've learned to live with death.

653
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,878
Uh, Milady, I'm grateful
for all that you've done...

654
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,428
- but I've got...
- What?

655
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,152
Important business.

656
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,111
How mysterious.

657
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,276
Does it require clothes?

658
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,352
Yes, I need my clothes.

659
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,836
I'm afraid they won't be ready
for at least an hour.

660
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,152
Until then, you're my prisoner.
Would the prisoner care for a drink?

661
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,038
Well, I am thirsty.

662
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,879
What brings you to Calais?

663
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,391
I'm on a mission for the King.

664
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,677
- I've heard that before.
- I'm serious.

665
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,591
You're young.

666
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,114
Young men
are given to exaggeration.

667
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,510
However, if you'd like to
entertain me with a story...

668
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,710
I love a good adventure.

669
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,836
I came to Calais to stop a spy.

670
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,034
- A spy?
- Yes.

671
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,992
I believe you.
Aren't you afraid?

672
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,192
- A Musketeer isn't afraid of anything.
- I knew it.

673
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,880
I knew you were a Musketeer
the moment I saw you.

674
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,318
- You did?
- Of course.

675
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,029
But, D'Artagnan, if this spy
were to find out you're here...

676
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,588
your life
could be in grave danger.

677
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,790
A Musketeer
isn't afraid of danger.

678
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,757
I'm dangerous.

679
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,434
Aren't you afraid of me?

680
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,351
You're not dangerous.

681
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,271
Then what am I?

682
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,677
You're beautiful.

683
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,228
Beauty. Danger.

684
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,151
They are the same.

685
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,358
Milady, I'm sorry...

686
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,548
Oh, my god!

687
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,795
Parker!

688
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,869
- Kill him.
- You can kill me...

689
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,673
but a surprise waits for you
that even Buckingham can't prevent.

690
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,718
You're young and vain...

691
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,109
but I don't know
if you're clever.

692
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,350
I know how you love
a good adventure.

693
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,588
Take him with us.

694
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,592
The bodyguards are waiting
outside, Milady.

695
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,513
All right.

696
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,353
- Can I help you, Lord de Winter?
- Milady de Winter, is she here?

697
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,069
- Oh, no, I've not seen her.
- She murdered my brother, old man.

698
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,799
Let's take the back stairs.

699
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,193
We are the Countess de Winter's
party, arrived from Paris.

700
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,794
Permission to come aboard!

701
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,751
Permission granted!

702
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,590
Take us to your captain.

703
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,268
What are you, deaf?

704
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,999
Dead. They're all dead!

705
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,439
Not all of us.

706
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,476
Porthos the pirate!

707
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,360
- Pirate?
- I told you I was famous.

708
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,189
Sabine.

709
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,599
Athos.

710
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,239
Stop!

711
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,152
I thought you were dead.

712
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,192
Cardinal Richelieu
took pity on me.

713
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,070
You are the spy.

714
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,671
I've learned the value of lies.
They've kept me alive.

715
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,399
The treaty. Give it to me.

716
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,919
No.

717
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,831
I will shoot.

718
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,433
Be kind.

719
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,716
Aim for my heart.

720
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,992
Countess De Winter...

721
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,157
I will not be so kind.

722
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,519
The treaty outlines Richelieu's plan
to forge an alliance with Buckingham.

723
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,431
- No mention of the King?
- None.

724
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,230
However, the agreement is contingent upon
a demonstration of the Cardinal's power.

725
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,676
A demonstration?
What kind of demonstration?

726
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,119
I don't know.

727
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,160
I know someone that does.

728
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,958
I wish to speak
with your prisoner.

729
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,877
She dies in the morning.

730
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,916
There was a time I would have
given my life for a kind word from you.

731
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,870
I could not give it.
I was a fool.

732
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,954
Is it true what he says?
Did you kill his brother?

733
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,031
I have become the nightmare...

734
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,072
you once thought me to be.

735
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,513
But not before.

736
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,869
- Not us.
- No.

737
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,871
Do you know
of the Cardinal's plans?

738
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,997
- I do.
- Tell me.

739
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,350
Will you have
my life spared?

740
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,317
No, I cannot.

741
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,153
Society demands swift justice.

742
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,952
I'll take my secret
to the grave.

743
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,399
Sabine.

744
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,119
You will die for your crimes.

745
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,993
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

746
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,918
But how you choose to leave
this world is up to you.

747
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,909
What has this world
ever done for me?

748
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,310
"'I am the resurrection and
the life,' sayeth the Lord.

749
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,069
'He who believeth in me
shall never die. "'

750
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,789
We forgive you for your crimes.
Die in peace.

751
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,718
On your knees.

752
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,239
No!

753
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,709
- What is this?
- Sabine...

754
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,035
forgive me, please.

755
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,673
I do forgive you.

756
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,032
The Cardinal intends
to assassinate the King...

757
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,873
on Friday
at his birthday celebration.

758
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,353
God's justice be done.

759
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,873
Amen.

760
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,997
The King's life is in danger.
We have work to do.

761
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,598
Impressive.

762
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,875
And he can do that every time.

763
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,434
- And he has no qualms about...
- None.

764
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,114
He believes a man should
honour no kings before God.

765
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,397
A man of faith.
How reassuring.

766
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,794
Whatever you're paying him,
double it.

767
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,674
I want the King's birthday
to be a memorable event.

768
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,555
And, uh, rehang this painting
in my chamber...

769
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,238
just as it is.

770
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,590
It was always a little
too flattering.

771
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,039
Horsemen!

772
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,315
- Over here!
- What does it say?

773
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,269
Well, over there.

774
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,074
Search the perimeter.
I'll try to find the King.

775
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,991
- But wh...
- Go!

776
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,593
You look beautiful.

777
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,999
Thank you.

778
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,073
Is something wrong?

779
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,237
- Cardinal Richelieu.
- Yes?

780
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,593
He is an evil man.

781
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,831
Do not believe
every rumour you hear.

782
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,633
He is powerful.

783
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,395
I ride through the countryside every
day; I've seen the uses of his power.

784
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,590
Power sometimes frightens.

785
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,989
But here in the palace
I've seen it too.

786
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,871
- I know.
- What shall we do?

787
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,430
I'm not sure,
but we will do it together.

788
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,792
Get back!

789
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,519
- Captain, protect Their Majesties! Get them inside!
- Richelieu!

790
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:11,639
Kill those Musketeers!
They're trying to murder the King!

791
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,957
Save the King!

792
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,753
Go with God.

793
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,829
I like this.

794
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,711
I think our young friend
could use some help.

795
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,279
Hold this.

796
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,676
- It's about time!
- Come, D'Artagnan! We're saving the King!

797
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,873
You have failed!

798
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,031
Oh. You are so naive.

799
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,830
Things couldn't be more perfect
if I'd planned them myself.

800
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,471
The King of France dies at the
hands of his own personal guard!

801
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,676
Grief-stricken, terrified...

802
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,234
the huddled masses
turn for comfort...

803
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,596
to their devout
spiritual leader...

804
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,392
who...

805
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,590
ever so humbly...

806
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,557
assumes the throne...

807
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,876
with the Queen by his side.

808
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,714
- I would rather die.
- That can be arranged!

809
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:35,558
But first, your reluctant
husband will be found...

810
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,150
pierced through the heart
by the sword of a Musketeer...

811
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,068
the same sword that failed
to protect his father.

812
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,796
- I hope we're not interrupting.
- On the contrary.

813
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,438
You're right on time.

814
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,513
Follow me.

815
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,592
- Leaving so soon?
- Oh, you know. I abhor bloodshed.

816
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,309
- Especially your own.
- Stand aside.

817
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,637
You are under arrest,
charged with treason.

818
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,314
You, of all people, should know
that the Cardinal...

819
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,715
does not answer
to the laws of men.

820
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,917
Then you'll answer to God.

821
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,351
You first.

822
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,069
Aramis.

823
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,950
- This sword belongs to me.
- So it does.

824
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,711
Let's see if you're as brave
a man as your father was.

825
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,553
And as foolish.

826
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,712
Is he dead?

827
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,068
Gently. Gently.

828
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,111
Oh!

829
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,760
You see? There is a God.

830
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,598
We're being followed.
Do something about it.

831
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,271
My god.

832
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,277
Which one do we take?

833
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,153
- I've never been here before.
- Split up.

834
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,949
Whoa, ugly!

835
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,519
Whoa.

836
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,036
You smelly...

837
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,270
lump of lard!

838
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,434
Impressive.

839
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,759
Damn it!

840
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,593
How pathetic.

841
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,319
Killed by the same man
that killed his father.

842
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,831
You killed my father?

843
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,076
Oh, yes.

844
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,513
As I will you.

845
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,873
Well, well.

846
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,828
One thing is certain:
You are no Musketeer.

847
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,833
I might have been mistaken.

848
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,758
For you, Father.

849
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,029
- Where have you been?
- Taking care of something ugly.

850
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,592
Richelieu!

851
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,950
You're too late, Musketeers!

852
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,152
By now the Duke of Buckingham's
signature is next to mine.

853
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,276
The alliance is complete!

854
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,710
That would be difficult, considering
the treaty never left France!

855
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,751
A minor problem.

856
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,274
I will return twice as strong...

857
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,198
and the throne will be mine!

858
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,635
I think not.

859
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,754
You will never harm...

860
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,671
another soul ever again.

861
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,591
My promise to God.

862
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,159
Wait!

863
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,877
Well done, Your Majesty.

864
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,837
Are you all right?

865
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,559
Yes.

866
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,993
Arise.

867
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:04,033
Is this the man
who saved my life?

868
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,958
His name's D'Artagnan, Sire.

869
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:11,750
D'Artagnan, I am in your debt. What can
I do to repay the courage you've shown me?

870
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,757
Your Majesty, his heart
has but one desire...

871
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,474
and that is to become
a Musketeer.

872
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,318
Then approach.

873
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,433
Kneel.

874
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,510
This world is an uncertain
realm, filled with danger...

875
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,273
honour undermined
by the pursuit of power...

876
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,472
freedom sacrificed when the weak
are oppressed by the strong.

877
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,469
But there are those who
oppose these powerful forces...

878
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,479
who dedicate their lives
to truth, honour and freedom.

879
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,915
These men are known
as Musketeers.

880
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,317
Rise, D'Artagnan...

881
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,159
and join them.

882
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,595
Long live the Musketeers!

883
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:50,110
Your father would be proud
of you; you are a Musketeer.

884
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,118
What do we do now?
What's next?

885
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,959
- Well, we protect the King.
- Protect the Queen.

886
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,152
- In the name of God.
- And France. Correct?

887
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,396
- France, indeed.
- D'Artagnan!

888
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,320
My sister's honour will not
wait a moment longer.

889
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,190
- I'll handle this.
- D'Artagnan.

890
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,356
We also protect each other.

891
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,471
All for one...

892
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:20,913
and one for all!

893
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,559
Run!

894
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,479
When it's love you give

895
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,870
I'll be your man of good faith

896
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,560
When in love you live

897
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,632
I'll make a stand
I won't break

898
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,311
I'll be the rock
you can build on

899
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,510
Yeah

900
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,637
Be there when you're old

901
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,399
To have and to hold

902
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,994
When there's love inside

903
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,157
I swear
I'll always be strong

904
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:21,232
And there's a reason why

905
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,357
I'll prove to you we belong

906
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:28,871
I'll be the wall
that protects you

907
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,076
Yeah

908
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,192
From the wind and the rain

909
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,630
From the hurt and the pain

910
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,637
- Yeah
- Hey

911
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,476
Let's make it all for one

912
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,556
And all for love

913
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,748
Let the one you hold
be the one you want

914
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,473
The one you need

915
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,831
'Cause when it's all for one

916
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,871
It's one for all

917
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,198
When there's someone
that should know

918
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:09,078
Then just
let your feelings show

919
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,158
And make it all for one

920
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,271
And all for love

921
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,508
When it's love you make

922
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,110
I'll be the fire
in your night

923
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,794
Then it's love you take

924
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,753
I will defend
I will fight

925
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:33,396
I'll be there when you need me

926
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,675
Yeah

927
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,792
When honour's at stake

928
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,917
This vow I will make

929
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,439
Yeah

930
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,112
That it's all for one

931
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,549
And all for love

932
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,352
It's all for love

933
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:57,274
Let the one you hold
be the one you want

934
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,999
The one you need

935
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:04,271
'Cause when it's all for one

936
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,436
It's one for all

937
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,629
Yeah

938
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,752
When there's someone
that should know

939
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,599
Then just
let your feelings show

940
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,632
And make it all for one

941
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,035
And all for love

942
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:25,758
Don't lay our love to rest

943
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,111
'Cause we can
stand up to the test

944
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:32,232
We got everything

945
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,151
And more

946
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:38,028
Than we had planned

947
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:40,270
More than the rivers

948
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,075
That run the land

949
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,355
We got it all

950
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,034
- In our hands
- Yeah

951
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:15,118
Now it's all for one

952
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,555
And all for love

953
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,551
It's all for love

954
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,355
Let the one you hold
be the one you want

955
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:27,159
The one you need

956
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:30,511
'Cause when it's all for one

957
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,714
It's one for all

958
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,917
When there's someone
that you know

959
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,309
Then just let
your feelings show

960
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,915
When there's someone
that you want

961
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,634
When there's someone
that you need

962
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:46,670
Let's make it

963
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:51,390
All

964
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,751
All for one

965
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:04,436
And all for love
