a little somethin', all right?

166

When you need something from me, you
don't have to hand me a bunch of lines.

167
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,605
All you have to do is
look at me in the eye and say,

168

"Sanka, you are my best friend.

169
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,486
We've been through a whole heap together
and I really, really need you."

170

Sanka, you're right.

171
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,335

been through a whole lot together.

- Heap. Heap.
- Sorry, man. A whole heap together.

173

And I really, really need you.

174

Forget it!

175
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,264
- But you just said if I said that, man...
- All right, all right,

176
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,807
all right.

177
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,722
All right, man.

about this "billsled" team.

- Whoever.

180

I'm gonna be on it by myself, right?

It's 900 degrees out there.

And me. You don't have me.

238

As far as I'm concerned, the sport
of bobsledding no longer exists.

2,000 miles of anyone who does.

649
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,158
I don't want you to worry
about lookin' good out there.

650
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,655
Ah, Blitzy.

651
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,446
You're going to tuck them in too?

652
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,495
Hey. Seemin' to you
like nobody likes us?

653
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:11,705
We're different. People
always afraid of what's different.

654
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,255
Hey, Jamaica!

655
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,627
Watch out for number 12 turn.
It's scary, <i>ja?</i>

656

Oooh!

What's his problem?

658
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,429
He's Josef Grool. He's one
of the best drivers in the world.

659
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,928
Yeah, he's one of the biggest
assholes in the world, too.

660
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:31,565
Don't listen to him; you listen to me.
Derice, right here. You got it?

661
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,816
Remember, keep your hands soft

- High in, low out.

00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,318
All right, put your helmets on,
everybody. Let's go.

Here we go, come on.
Helmets on.

665

- Hey, coach?
- Yeah.

00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,706
I cannot get my helmet on.

667
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,456

- That's what I'm here for.

668
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,708
- Oh, coach? I-I gotta go. You know.
- Yeah?

669
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,919
- Hold it!
- Hold it?

670
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,885
- Hold it! Yeah, hold it!
- Hold it?

671
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,718
B-But, coach, I, I can't hold it.
We're not bobsledding yet.

it's too advanced for the likes of you.

What are you trying to say? That I'm
not smarter than a little child?

696
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,410
No. What I am saying to you is that you

00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,375
Well, I know my father
started off in a one-room hut.

721
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,037
Now, he lives in one of
the biggest homes in Kingston.

722

- Well, <i>he</i> ain't your father.
- He doesn't have to be.

723
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,090
All he has to do is know what he wants
and work hard for it.

And if he wants it bad enough,
he'll get it.
