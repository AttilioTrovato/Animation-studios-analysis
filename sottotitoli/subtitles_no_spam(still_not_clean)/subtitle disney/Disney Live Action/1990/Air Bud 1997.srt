1
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,681
OH, DARN IT!

2
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,022
OKAY, MUTT.

3
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,457
SHOW TIME.

4
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,659
OKAY, COME HERE.

5
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,795
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

6
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:12,065
HEY, DO NOT MAKE ME
USE THIS, OKAY?

7
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,673
HI.
"CLOWN AND THE HOUND."

8
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,343
OW!

9
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,647
HEY, KIDS,
IT'S HAPPY, SLAPPY TIME!

10
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,285
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
I TELL YA WHAT WE'LL DO.

11
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,655
WE'LL START OFF WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PLATE-SPINNIN', OKAY?

12
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,570
I BET YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GUESS WHAT THIS ONE IS.

13
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:58,246
HOO-HOO-HA, HOO-HOO-HOO.
HULA, HULA, HULA HOOP

14
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,751
PICK A CARD, ANY CARD.

15
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,521
NOW WE PUT THE PLATE
IN OUR MOUTH!

16
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:16,364
IT WENT DOWN A LITTLE BIT...
FAR.

17
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,582
OKAY, DOG, YOUR TURN.

18
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,457
OH. OH. OH.

19
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,528
ONE MORE.

20
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,229
YEAH!

21
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:53,301
AND NOW
FOR THE GRAND FINALE, KIDS!

22
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,772
WHERE ARE YOU?

23
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,275
COME BACK HERE!

24
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,445
OW!

25
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,288
MY CAKE!

26
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,261
OH!

27
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,171
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I GET A COUPLE REFERENCES?

28
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,442
COME ON! GET UP HERE!

29
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,176
I WARNED YOU.

30
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,846
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE,
YOU FLEA-BITTEN MONGREL.

31
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,515
YOU'RE GOING TO THE POUND!

32
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:42,816
DO YOU HEAR ME?

33
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,184
YOU'RE GOING TO THE POUND!

34
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,458
I HATE BIRTHDAY PARTIES!

35
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,926
I HATE KIDS!

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,563
I HATE BEING A CLOWN!

37
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,368
I CAN'T STAND
BIRTHDAY CAKES!

38
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,677
YEAH, DOG POUND?

39
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,312
I GOT A VICIOUS DOG.
NO, IT'S A HORRIBLE DOG.

40
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,648
IT'S A MENACE!

41
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,884
I'M BRINGIN' HIM IN NOW!

42
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,821
NO,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

43
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,856
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING YA.

44
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,394
WHAT? OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, I KNOW WHERE THAT IS.

45
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,963
I COULD BE THERE
IN 15, 20 MINUTES.

46
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,865
YEAH. WELL, NO, I GOT A MAP.

47
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,767
I GOT A MAP
HERE IN THE TRUCK.

48
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,717
OH, MY GOD!

49
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,885
OH, MY!

50
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,755
YOU OKAY?

51
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:28,856
YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?

52
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,790
YOU OKAY? NO!

53
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:34,094
WELL, JEEZ,
ALMOST GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

54
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,597
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT BOX DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD?

55
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,798
WE'RE OKAY.

56
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,932
EVERYONE'S OKAY.
WE-WE'RE OKAY. FINE.

57
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,728
ISN'T IT CUTE?
OH, DON'T FORGET:

58
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,797
MY NEW JOB IS JUST
TEN MINUTES AWAY.

59
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,799
DID I TELL YOU THAT THE FERNFIELD NAPKIN FACTORY...

60
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,503
IS THE THIRD LARGEST MANUFACTURER
OF NAPKINS IN ALL NORTH AMERICA?

61
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,639
WHOOP, HERE WE ARE.

62
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:32,452
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

63
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,760
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HIM STARTING
THREE MONTHS INTO THE SCHOOL YEAR.

64
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:49,563
HE DOESN'T MAKE FRIENDS
VERY EASILY.

65
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,999
NOT THAT HE'S NOT FRIENDLY.

66
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,568
IT'S JUST-- WELL, HE
DOESN'T TALK MUCH THESE DAYS.

67
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,570
YOU SEE, WHEN HIS DAD
PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR--

68
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,738
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

69
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,906
THANK YOU.

70
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,107
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT.

71
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,742
SO, ANYWAY...

72
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,445
I USED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AROUND
HERE BECAUSE MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED HERE.

73
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,249
SO I THOUGHT THAT THE MOVE WOULD REALLY BE
THE BEST THING FOR US, ESPECIALLY FOR JOSH.

74
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,918
I UNDERSTAND.

75
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,586
I'M SURE HE'S GOING
TO DO VERY WELL HERE.

76
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,789
BUT TELL ME ABOUT
EXTRACURRICULAR PROGRAMS.

77
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,558
DOES JOSH HAVE ANY INTERESTS
OR HOBBIES?

78
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:23,731
WELL, HE USED TO LIKE TO PLAY
BASKETBALL WITH HIS DAD,

79
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,733
BUT HE'S LOST INTEREST
IN THAT TOO.

80
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,267
WELL, LET'S SEE.

81
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,102
WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT BAND.

82
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:34,074
OH, I USED TO PLAY THE FLUTE WHEN I WAS HIS AGE.
THAT WAS FUN.

83
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,685
I THINK AN INSTRUMENT
WOULD BE JUST THE THING!

84
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,157
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T BLOW SO HARD.

85
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,795
OKAY, BLOW A LITTLE HARDER.

86
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,810
HEY, MIKE, PASS!

87
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,278
PICK UP. COME ON.

88
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,846
COME ON.

89
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,148
GO! COME ON, SHOOT!

90
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,517
SHOOT!

91
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,403
I KNOW, MOM.

92
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,771
IT'S NOT CALLED MOONLIGHTING.
OH, I FOUND IT.

93
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:52,906
YEAH, IT'S--

94
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,007
IT'S-IT'S-- NO!

95
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,275
IT'S NOT MOONLIGHTING.

96
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,144
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO HAVE TWO JOBS.

97
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,947
HMM? MOM, WOULD YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE?
I HAVE ANOTHER CALL.

98
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,482
HELLO. OH, Y--
Q-R-S, T-U-V

99
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,784
YES, MRS. GRAYSON. HI.
W-X

100
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:10,223
I FIGURED OUT WHY BOLIVIA DIDN'T GET THE NAPKINS SENT.
VENEZUELA GOT 'EM. YEAH.

101
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,365
SORRY, SWEETIE,
THAT WAS GRANDMA ON THE PHONE.

102
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,802
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

103
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,471
IT SUCKS.

104
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,240
HOW WAS THE TROMBONE?

105
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,846
AW, SWEETIE.

106
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,352
I'M SORRY.

107
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,491
YOU KNOW,
WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN THIS LAST YEAR.

108
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,160
BUT I KNOW WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH IT.

109
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,496
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE.

110
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,066
ALL WE GOTTA DO IS JUST GIVE IT OUR BEST SHOT EVERY DAY.

111
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:01,041
YOUR DAD WOULD'VE WANTED IT
THAT WAY.

112
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,043
I GUESS.

113
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:07,080
SURE. HE WOULDN'T HAVE
WANTED YOU BEING ALL MOPEY.

114
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,758
I LOVE YOU.

115
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,949
CHECK OUT THE NEW KID.

116
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,451
IT LOOKS LIKE HE STOLE THAT BALL
FROM THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS.

117
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,256
HOW YOU DOIN', BUDDY?

118
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,392
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP!

119
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:56,896
NOW, YOU'RE HERE TODAY TO TRY OUT
FOR THE SCHOOL'S FINEST TRADITION:

120
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,399
BASKETBALL.

121
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,435
NOW, I'VE GOT FIVE OF MY BOYS
BACK FROM LAST YEAR,

122
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,272
INCLUDING LEADING SCORER
LARRY WILLINGHAM.

123
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,141
RAISE YOUR HANDS, GENTLEMEN.

124
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,544
THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOIN' ALL THE WAY.
WHY'S THAT, WILLINGHAM?

125
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,313
'CAUSE WE'RE WINNERS, SIR.

126
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,115
THAT'S RIGHT.

127
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,450
WE ARE HERE TO WIN...

128
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,088
'CAUSE IF YOU CAN WIN
ON THE COURTS,

129
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,323
YOU CAN WIN AT LIFE.

130
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,491
GET YOUR BUTTS OUT HERE.

131
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,458
LET'S SEE IF
YOU CAN PLAY BALL.

132
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,429
WHAT TEAM YOU PLAYIN' FOR?

133
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,298
WHAT TEAM YOU PLAYIN' FOR?
WHO'S GONNA WIN?

134
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,899
WHO'S GONNA WIN?

135
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,234
TIMBERWOLVES!

136
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,335
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

137
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,469
TIMBERWOLVES!

138
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,505
WHAT TEAM'S GONNA WIN?

139
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,658
GOOD NIGHT, ART.

140
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,959
GOOD NIGHT.

141
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:04,197
HEY, KID,
YOU'RE NEW HERE, RIGHT?

142
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,867
WELL, UH, I COULD USE
A MANAGER.

143
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,336
WELL--

144
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,970
MANAGER WORKS HIS BUTT OFF.

145
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,539
HE ARRIVES BEFORE THE TEAM.

146
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,341
HE LEAVES AFTER THE TEAM.
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT?

147
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,944
PRACTICE IS FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

148
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,212
YOU BE HERE.

149
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,477
HEY, BOY.

150
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,679
WANT ME TO GET
THOSE RAGS OFF YA?

151
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,674
YES, MRS. GRAYSON, I KNOW,
BUT THAT ACCOUNT NEEDS TO BE ZEROED OUT.

152
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,676
MM. I KNOW.

153
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,278
COULD YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE?

154
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,546
I HAVE ANOTHER CALL. THANKS.

155
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,048
HI. HELLO? OH, HI!

156
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,351
WEREN'T YOU GUYS SUPPOSED
TO START WALLPAPERING TODAY?

157
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,254
JOSH, WOULD YOU EAT SOMETHING, PLEASE?
I DON'T KNOW WHY

158
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,436
WHOA.

159
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,318
YOU LIKE BASKETBALL?

160
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,959
HEY, BOY, COME AND GET IT!

161
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,227
COME AND GET IT!

162
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,257
HEY, BOY.

163
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,948
GOOD BOY.

164
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,416
OKAY, IN YOU GO.

165
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,955
COME ON.

166
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,827
COME ON.

167
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:02,341
COME ON. MY MOM'S
GONNA BE HOME AT 5:00.

168
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,349
WAIT A MINUTE.

169
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,923
HEY, BOY!

170
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,958
YEAH, GOOD BOY, GOOD BOY.
YOU WANT IT, BOY?

171
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,359
YOU WANT THE BALL?

172
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,594
YOU WANT THE BALL?

173
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,462
YEAH, GO GET IT,
GO GET IT.

174
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,698
SPLISH, SPLASH
I WAS TAKIN' A BATH

175
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:29,669
LONG ABOUT A SATURDAY NIGHT

176
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,471
RUB, DUB
JUST RELAXIN' IN THE TUB

177
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,474
THINKIN' EVERYTHING

178
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,845
WELL, I STEPPED OUT THE TUB

179
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,447
I WRAPPED THE TOWEL AROUND ME
AND I OPENED THE DOOR

180
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,851
AND A SPLISH SPLASH
I JUMPED BACK IN THE BATH

181
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:47,687
WELL, HOW WAS I TO KNOW

00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,815
FLIP, FLOP THEY WAS DOIN' THE BOP STAY, BUDDY.

00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,417

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,088

JOSH, I'M HOME!

196
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,555
BUDDY, STAY.

197
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,958
AND DON'T MOVE
UNTIL I COME BACK.

198
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,897
THERE YOU GO.

199
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:09,869
HI, MOM!

200
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,103
CAN I HELP WITH
THE GROCERIES?

201
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,605
EXCUSE ME?

202
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,806
CAN I HELP WITH
THE GROCERIES?

203
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,108
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

204
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:19,145
OKAY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

205
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,954
WHAT'S WRONG?

206
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:31,490
NOTHING!
CAN'T A GUY EVEN HELP HIS MOM WITH THE GROCERIES?

207
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,098
WHAT DID YOU DO?

208
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:43,002
MOM, DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO HAVE A HAMSTER?

209
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,107
YOU WANT
ANOTHER HAMSTER? NO!

210
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,645
NOT EXACTLY.

211
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,846
JOSH, SPIT IT OUT!

212
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,791
OH, MY GOD.

213
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:13,532
OH, MY GOD!

214
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,898
NO!

215
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:51,570
BUDDY! EW!

216
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:00,780
SO, CAN I KEEP HIM?

217
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,793
OH, HERE.

218
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,304
I GOT AN IDEA.

219
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:21,160
JOSH, WOULD YOU
COME IN HERE, PLEASE?

220
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,728
UH-OH.

221
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,996
BUDDY,
YOU GOTTA STAY HERE, OKAY?

222
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,297
BUDDY, NO.

223
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:28,300
YOU GOTTA
STAY OUTSIDE.

224
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,737
HEY, MOM, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

225
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,771
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

226
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:33,739
THE BOX.

227
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,473
THE BOX?

228
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,407
DON'T GET FUNNY
WITH ME, JOSH.

229
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,442
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

230
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,410
WHAT AM I DOING?

231
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,779
YOU ARE MAKING A HOME FOR HIM,
AND THIS IS NOT HIS HOME.

232
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,148
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW--

233
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,782
MOM, WE CAN'T LEAVE
HIM OUT IN THE RAIN.

234
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:44,917
THAT'S TOTALLY INHUMAN.

235
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,018
THAT'S JUST THE POINT, JOSH.

236
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:47,253
HE'S NOT HUMAN.

237
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,787
HE'S A STRAY.

238
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,990
DO NOT GET ATTACHED
TO THIS DOG, JOSH. DO NOT!

239
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,325
NO, I HAVE WAY TOO MUCH
ON MY PLATE AS IT IS.

240
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,961
I'D TAKE CARE OF HIM.

241
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,996
JOSH, WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS DOG.

242
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,398
WE HAVE YOUR LITTLE SISTER TO THINK ABOUT.
NO. THE ANSWER IS NO.

243
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,370
ONE WEEK, AND IF NOBODY CLAIMS HIM,
HE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE POUND.

244
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,437
THREE WEEKS?

245
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,372
TWO AND A HALF? TWO.

246
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:08,340
JOSH!

247
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,276
CHRISTMAS.
THAT'S LIKE TWO WEEKS AND A COUPLE DAYS, RIGHT?

248
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,978
THAT'S PERFECT.

249
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,445
WE CAN'T DUMP HIM
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

250
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,847
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

251
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,015
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, CHRISTMAS.

252
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,851
BUT THE MINUTE AFTER,
HE'S OUTTA HERE.

253
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:21,020
MEANWHILE, HE STAYS OUTSIDE.

254
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,222
AND IF YOU TRY TO SNEAK
HIM IN HERE JUST ONCE--

255
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,456
MOM, MOM, MOM.

256
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,791
I SWEAR.

257
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,026
ALL RIGHT.

258
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,495
AS LONG AS WE'RE CLEAR.

259
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,064
I SWEAR,
YOU'RE GONNA GROW UP TO BE A LAWYER SOMEDAY.

260
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,306
JOSH, DID YOU SEE
MY NEWSPAPER? NO, MOM!

261
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,208
MORNING, MOM!

262
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,243
BUDDY, HOW ARE YA?

263
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,979
HOW ARE YA, BOY?

264
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:54,546
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD SLEEP?
DID YA?

265
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,948
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

266
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,145
DON'T DRAG YOUR FEET.

267
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,179
DON'T DRAG YOUR FEET.
I GOT THE SHOT.

268
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,181
DOWN, DOWN. LET'S GO!

269
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,918
STEWART,
DON'T TRY TO BE A HERO.

270
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,453
YOUR JOB ON THIS TEAM IS TO
GET THE BALL TO WILLINGHAM.

271
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,089
LET'S GO!

272
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,357
PASS IT OFF. LET'S GO!

273
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,858
MOVE IT, MOVE IT.
BACK.

274
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:45,197
THAT'S IT. LET'S GO, CURTIS.

275
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:57,143
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
WATER BOY?

276
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,180
LET'S GO!

277
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:30,409
HEY, GET OUT. CAN'T YOU SEE
THIS IS WET PAINT?

278
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,660
HE SHOOTS... AND SCORES!

279
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,563
HERE!

280
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:54,366
GOOD BOY!

281
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,072
COOL. PIZZA.

282
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:03,109
ME TOO. WHO IS IT?

283
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,448
WHAT'S WITH JOSH TODAY?

284
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,263
WHOA! HOW DID YOU
GET UP HERE?

285
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,498
HEY!

286
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,133
JOSH!

287
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,801
NO!

288
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,603
ARE YOU OKAY?

289
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,640
JOSH!

290
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,376
I'M FINE, MOM!

291
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,249
JOSH?

292
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:19,285
JOSH!

293
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,520
IS EVERYTHING OKAY IN HERE?

294
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:22,488
YEAH, MOM.

295
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,190
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

296
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,457
JUST DOIN' MY HOMEWORK.

297
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:30,496
WHY DON'T I TAKE CARE OF THAT LAUNDRY AS LONG AS I'M HERE?

298
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,198
NO!

299
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,665
I'LL DO IT LATER.

300
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,668
YOU WORK SO HARD, MOM.

301
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:38,670
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR ME.

302
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,848
HELLO?

303
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,517
YES, THIS IS MRS. FRAMM.

304
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,719
YES, MY SON PUT UP
THOSE FLYERS.

305
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:59,391
OH, NO, NO.
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT ONE UP ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

306
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,227
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

307
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,794
OH.

308
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,530
YEAH!

309
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,428
HEY, JACKIE! WHAT'S NEW?

310
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:39,698
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

311
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,435
BYE, MOM. I GOT PRACTICE.

312
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,437
I'LL BE HOME LATE.
BYE, HONEY.

313
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,510
THAT'S IT, GENTLEMEN.

314
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,744
SHOWERS!

315
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:57,115
YOU TRIED TO GET

316
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:41,853
COLD WATER.

317
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,221
HUH?

318
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:47,959
MAKE SURE YOU USE
COLD WATER.

319
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:51,797
THEY'LL COME OUT ALL MINIATURIZED IF YOU DON'T.

320
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,832
OKAY.

321
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,337
I DON'T GET IT.

322
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,807
YOU DON'T GET WHAT?

323
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,843
WHY ARE YOU PUTTIN' YOURSELF
THROUGH THIS?

324
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:14,786
I GUESS I JUST LIKE
BASKETBALL.

325
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,582
WHOA!

326
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,056

A WONDERFUL HOLIDAY, CHILDREN.

327
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,058
WE'LL SEE YOU ALL

328
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,838
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

329
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,617
COULD YOU SIGN THIS?

330
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,424
YOU THINK THIS IS ME?

331
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,959
IT ISN'T?

332
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,761
NO, KID.

333
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,797
THAT GUY'S DEAD.

334
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,799
DIED A LONG TIME AGO.

335
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,670
OH, OKAY.

336
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,839

00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,479
HEY, BUDDY, IT'S CHRISTMAS.

355
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,885
BUDDY? BUDDY?

356
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,993
BUDDY!

357
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,864
MERRY CHRISTMAS, JOSH.

358
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,599
BUDDY!

359
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,643
THANK YOU, MOM.

360
00:42:57,676 --> 00:42:59,410
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

361
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:03,882
I GOTTA GET THESE FLYERS OUT TO THE BOYS WHO
TRIED OUT FOR THE TEAM AND DIDN'T MAKE IT.

362
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,885
THE SIMMONS TWINS MOVED TO CANADA.
GOD KNOWS WHY.

363
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,120
I GOT TWO SLOTS OPEN.

364
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,122
YOU KNOW WHICH LOCKERS
BELONG TO WHICH BOYS?

365
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,803
DON'T EVEN WASTE
YOUR TIME, WATER BOY.

366
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:53,231
I WISH MY DAD WERE HERE.

367
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,903
HE ALWAYS KNEW WHAT TO DO.

368
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:07,212
NO, BUDDY! NO.

369
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,247
I DON'T WANNA PLAY.

370
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,322
FINE.

371
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,224
YOU CAN PLAY.

372
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:36,341
NO WAY.

373
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:45,383
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

374
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,719
COME ON, BOY.

375
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:50,088
SIT, BOY.

376
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,599
WHOA!

377
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:30,061
YES!

378
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,135
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU LEARNED TO DO THIS,

379
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:41,139
BUT JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,
OUR SECRET, OKAY?

380
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,641
YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD BOY. YEAH.

381
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,448
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
LISTEN UP.

382
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,784
NOW, WE'RE OFF
TO A ROCKY START.

383
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,820
WE'RE TWO AND TWO.

384
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:57,422
IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT TO THE PLAY-OFFS,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START WINNIN'.

385
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:00,058
WHICH IS WHY I'M LOOKIN'
FOR A COUPLE OF WINNERS.

386
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,160
THERE'S NINE OF YOU HERE.

387
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,295
ONLY TWO OF YOU
ARE COMIN' BACK.

388
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,831
FRAMM! YOU'RE LATE!

389
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:07,132
BRING OVER THAT
RACK OF BALLS!

390
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:09,767
I'M HERE TO TRY OUT
FOR THE TEAM.

391
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:12,437
HE CAN'T TRY OUT.
HE'S THE WATER BOY.

392
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,907
FRAMM, WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT?

393
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:18,176
IT WAS IN MY LOCKER.

394
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,012
WELL,
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.

395
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:24,182
WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE
IF I TRIED OUT ANYWAY?

396
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,786
COACH, JUST LET HIM.

397
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,122
ALL RIGHT,
BUT IF YOU SLOW DOWN

398
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:33,358
MY TRYOUT, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PULL YOU OUT.

399
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,862
FAST BREAK, FAST BREAK!

400
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,778
YES!

401
00:46:58,884 --> 00:47:01,252
LOOK AT
MY NEW SHOES, MAN.

402
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,757
NERVOUS?

403
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,065
THIS ALWAYS BROUGHT ME GOOD LUCK.
YOU SHOULD CARRY IT TONIGHT.

404
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,867
AN ORANGE PEEL?

405
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:17,368
NOT JUST ANY ORANGE PEEL.

406
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:22,073
SCOTTIE PIPPEN DROPPED THIS ORANGE PEEL AT THE SONICS GAME.
I PICKED IT UP.

407
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:26,511
I CAN'T TAKE THIS, TOM.

408
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:28,079
IT'S OKAY.

409
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:31,917
I GOT THIS
OUT OF SHAWN KEMP'S TRASH.

410
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,029
WATER BOY.

411
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,064
JUST STAY
OUT OF MY WAY.

412
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,262
JOSH. HI!

413
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,064
JOSH!

414
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,865
YEAH, JOSH.

415
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,310
BE A MAN, LARRY!

416
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:36,982
YOU MAKE THE BASKET,
THEN YOU DRAW THE FOUL! COME ON!

417
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:51,462
PASS, PASS!

418
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,164
OVER HERE, LARRY. OVER HERE.

419
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,277
THEY'RE KILLIN' US ON THE TRANSITIONS.
FULL-COURT PRESS.

420
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,850
ALL RIGHT?
TIMBERWOLVES!

421
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:17,989
STEWART! I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU DROP THE BALL AGAIN.
YOU GOT IT?

422
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:29,500
THAT WAS OUR BALL, REF!

423
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:32,137
- HACKING NUMBER THREE, HACKING NUMBER THREE.
- GET YOUR BUTT OVER HERE!

424
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,641
THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO MOUTH OFF AT THE REFEREE IS ME.

425
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:37,942
FRAMM, CHECK IN!

426
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,344
ME?

427
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:42,180
DO YOU SEE ANY OTHER FRAMMS
SITTIN' HERE? CHECK IN!

428
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,183
YEAH, JOSH!

429
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:49,154
FRAMM, NUMBER FOUR,
NOW ENTERING THE GAME.

430
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:57,528
PASS IT OFF!

431
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:58,996
GO, GO, GO!

432
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:25,723
BUDDY!

433
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,496
GET HIM!

434
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,964
BUDDY, NO!

435
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:38,103
BUDDY, STOP!

436
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:43,408
HEY, GIMME THAT.

437
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:44,609
GIMME THAT BALL.

438
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,618
EXCUSE ME.

439
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,486
COME BACK HERE!

440
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,670
BUDDY, GET OVER HERE!

441
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:19,977
BUDDY, NO!

442
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:36,194
BUDDY. BAD DOG.

443
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,333
SORRY, JOSH.

444
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:43,334
COME ON, BUDDY.

445
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,520
JOSH.
HEY, BOY.

446
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,655
DID YOU KNOW THAT BUDDY
COULD DO THAT?

447
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:07,425
DID YOU KNOW THAT HE COULD PLAY BASKETBALL?
THERE HE IS!

448
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,127
OH, THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

449
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:12,263
AND THE DOG!

450
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:16,133
I SWEAR I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT IF I
HADN'T SEEN IT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

451
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:19,270
A BASKETBALL-PLAYING DOG!

452
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,372
A REGULAR
MICHAEL "WOOF" JORDAN.

453
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:24,809
YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING THIS
UNDER YOUR HAT.

454
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:27,812
OH, BUT I'M GOING ON LIKE A FAUCET.
MELISSA, THIS IS MRS. FRAMM...

455
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,681
AND HER TALENTED SON, JOSH.

456
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:32,383
HI.

457
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,118
HI.

458
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,120
I'M THE PRESIDENT
OF THE BOOSTER CLUB,

459
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,290
AND I WONDERED IF, MAYBE,
YOU AND--

460
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,725
BUDDY.

461
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,360
BUDDY-- COULD DO THAT TRICK
AT THE NEXT HALF-TIME SHOW.

462
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:44,629
WOULDN'T HE BE
A GREAT MASCOT?

463
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,698
IT WOULD BE GREAT
FOR SCHOOL SPIRIT!

464
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,702
BUDDY?

465
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:54,205
BUDDY.

466
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,242
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA DROP
ANOTHER BALL AGAIN, STEWART.

467
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:06,217
YOU COULD DO THAT.

468
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:08,586
JUST MEET THE BALL.
JUST CATCH THE BALL.

469
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:13,090
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

470
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:17,395
JUST RUNNING TOM THROUGH A LITTLE DRILL.
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH, JOE.

471
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:20,765
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH.

472
00:53:26,271 --> 00:53:30,174
GOOD BOY.

473
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,609
HI, I'D LIKE TO REPORT A PROBLEM WITH
MY MORNING NEWSPAPER DELIVERY.

474
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:33,411
I'M NOT GETTING ONE.

475
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:34,912
NO, I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN ONE FOR WEEKS NOW.

476
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,682
I KEEP CALLING AND CALLING.

477
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,117
LOOK, MY NEIGHBORS HAVE THEM,
AND I DON'T.

478
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,621
OH, NO, I'M SURE HE'S A REALLY GREAT,
GREAT PAPERBOY.

479
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,790
JOSH!

480
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,531
MISS PEPPER?

481
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,432
MM-HMM.

482
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,801
UM, HAVE YOU FOUND
A BASKETBALL COACH YET?

483
00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:02,773
MMM. LARRY'S FATHER VOLUNTEERED.
JUST UNTIL WE FIND A NEW P.E. TEACHER.

484
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:06,143
OKAY.

485
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,445
MMM.

486
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:08,646
UM--

487
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:13,651
WOULD IT BE WEIRD
IF I MADE A SUGGESTION?

488
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,902
AFTERNOON.

489
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,705
UH, LET'S GET STARTED.

490
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:38,309
YOU SEE THIS BALL?

491
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,647
I DON'T SEE NOTHIN'.

492
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,282
WELL, I DO.
IT'S A GOOD BALL.

493
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,952
REGULATION WEIGHT, SIZE.

494
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:51,188
A LITTLE WORN,

495
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,224
BUT STILL HAS
A NICE BOUNCE TO IT.

496
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:01,666
DON'T-DON'T HANG ON TO IT,
JOSH. PASS IT ON.

497
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:04,569
NICE CATCH.

498
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:08,539
UH-OH. FUMBLE.

499
00:55:08,573 --> 00:55:10,708
THIS IS STUPID. LET'S
GET A REAL BALL IN HERE.

500
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:14,979
A BALL IS NOTHING
BUT RUBBER AND AIR, LARRY.

501
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:16,514
BASKETBALL...

502
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:17,848
IS WHAT YOU DO WITH IT.

503
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:19,984
BEFORE YOU PLAY WITH THIS,

504
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:23,988
YOU GOTTA LEARN HOW TO PLAY
WITH YOUR TEAMMATES.

505
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,990
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
PASS THE BALLS.

506
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,324
COUNT THE DRIBBLING.

507
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:28,393
PASS THE BALL.

508
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:29,694
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

509
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:30,995
LOOKING GOOD.

510
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,997
TWO POINTS! FINE.

511
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,833
ONLY YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE BALL. WHAT?

512
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:39,003
YOU'RE NOT WATCHING YOUR TEAMMATES.
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH AN INVISIBLE BALL.

513
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,972
YOU GOTTA GET YOUR INFORMATION FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

514
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,308
NOW, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

515
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,755
IT'S HALF.

516
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,830
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE?

517
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,032
UH, WE HAVE A REAL TREAT
FOR YOU TONIGHT, FOLKS.

518
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:11,736
I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO WELCOME OUR VERY OWN GUARD JOSH FRAMM...

519
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:15,906
AND THE NEW MASCOT FOR THE TIMBERWOLVES' BASKETBALL TEAM...

520
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,275
AIR BUD!

521
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,376
GREAT!

522
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,400
COME ON. COME ON.

523
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:44,769
GOOD BOY.

524
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,303
YEAH, GOOD BOY.

525
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:59,383
LET'S GO.

526
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,418
LET'S GO.

527
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,659
COME ON.

528
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:10,595
I'M JUST PLAYING.

529
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:11,629
YEAH, GOOD BOY.

530
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:12,663
JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

531
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:15,833
YOU CAN DO THIS.

532
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,469
YOU ALREADY
SHOWED ME THAT.

533
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:23,073
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
ALL THOSE PEOPLE. HEY.

534
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,075
GOOD BOY. YEAH.

535
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,977
GOOD BOY. LET'S GO.
COME ON. LET'S GO, BOY.

536
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:28,679
COME ON. LET'S GO.

537
00:57:28,713 --> 00:57:30,347
YOU WANNA PLAY? GOOD BOY.

538
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:50,801
PASS THE BALL. LET'S GO.

539
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:53,003
I'M OPEN.

540
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:55,405
LARRY, COME ON!

541
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:03,781
LARRY, OUT!

542
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,482
WHAT?

543
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:06,951
WHY ARE YOU TAKING ME OUT?

544
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,886
JOSH, GO ON IN
FOR LARRY. HUH?

545
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,556
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOIN'?

546
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:13,558
TIME, REF!

547
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:15,125
WHY ARE YOU
TAKIN' MY KID OUT?

548
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,794
'CAUSE HE'S PLAYIN'
LIKE A ONE-MAN TEAM.

549
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:20,798
THIS BOY IS THE TEAM.
MAYBE HE IS TO A WORKED-UP FATHER,

550
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,200
BUT TO ME,
HE'S A PLAYER WHO'S GOT A WHOLE LOT TO LEARN.

551
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,703
NOW I'LL KINDLY ASK YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEAT,
MR. WILLINGHAM.

552
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:28,472
LET ME GET BACK
TO COACHING MY TEAM.

553
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,541
COME ON, LARRY.

554
00:58:30,575 --> 00:58:32,543
WE'RE LEAVIN'.

555
00:58:32,577 --> 00:58:33,978
BUT DAD?

556
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,512
NOW!

557
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,717
CHECK IN, JOSH.

558
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,893
CHRIS, CHRIS!

559
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:49,954
A LOT EASIER WHEN THE PRESSURE'S OFF,
ISN'T IT?

560
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:53,223
I THOUGHT IF I MADE THE BASKET,
THE GUYS WOULD'VE,

561
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,292
YOU KNOW, ACCEPTED ME.

562
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:59,630
YOU TOOK THAT SHOT FOR THE WRONG REASONS, JOSH.
SEE THAT DOG?

563
00:59:59,664 --> 01:00:01,666
TOSS HIM THE BALL.
YEAH.

564
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,834
OKAY.

565
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:07,304
THAT DOG COULDN'T GIVE
A RAT'S BEHIND...

566
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:10,975
ABOUT HIS POINT AVERAGE,
WHETHER HE'S M.V.P.

567
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:14,845
HE JUST LOVES TO PLAY
THE GAME.

568
01:00:14,879 --> 01:00:17,815
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PLAYERS
IN THE PROS...

569
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:19,817
LIKE THAT GUY CHANEY,
FOR INSTANCE,

570
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,619
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE
YOU MADE.

571
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:26,556
IF YOU'RE JUST OUT THERE
FOR YOURSELF, YOU LOSE.

572
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:30,260
IT'S ALL IN HERE, JOSH.

573
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,863
YOU GOTTA PLAY
FROM THE HEART.

574
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,937
THAT'S IT.

575
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,271
CONCENTRATE ON THE BALL.

576
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,673
GOOD. GOOD!

577
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:43,808
NOW YOU'RE GETTIN' IT.

578
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:50,014
YEAH!

579
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,549
THAT'S GREAT!

580
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:20,344
GO, BUDDY!

581
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:58,916
WE'RE HERE
AT FERNFIELD SCHOOL...

582
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,051
WHERE THE TIMBERWOLVES
HAVE JUST QUALIFIED...

583
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:03,954
FOR NEXT WEEK'S FINAL
AGAINST THE WARRIORS.

584
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:08,292
EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN THE TIMBERWOLVES'
MIRACULOUS MID-SEASON TURNAROUND...

585
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:11,061
IS THEIR MASCOT'S
INCREDIBLE ABILITIES.

586
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:13,063
HIS NAME IS BUDDY,

587
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:15,699
BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY
GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

588
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,968
HE'S MORE OF
A GOLDEN SHOOTER.

589
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:20,170
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
TAKE A LOOK.

590
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:49,934
BUDDY.

591
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:01,045
OH.

592
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:06,283
OH, HEY.

593
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:08,018
SORRY TO DISTURB YA.

594
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:09,820
NAME'S NORM SNIVELY.
I BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT MY DOG.

595
01:03:09,854 --> 01:03:11,088
HUH? WHAT?

596
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,322
MY DOG.

597
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:16,193
YOU KNOW, OLD-- OLD--

598
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:19,930
OLD BLUE.

599
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,165
UH--

600
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:22,366
UH, HERE.

601
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:25,802
THERE'S A PICTURE OF HIM.

602
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:26,770
THAT'S HIM AND ME.

603
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,274
- YOU SEE, I'M A CLOWN
BY PROFESSION. - UM--

604
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:34,178
- MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
HIS PAPERS. - UH-- UH--

605
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,853
JOSH.

606
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:44,288
NO!

607
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,123
BLUE, YES.

608
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,892
NOW YOU'RE COMIN'
HOME WITH DADDY.

609
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:49,459
NO! YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM!

610
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,195
JOSH! HONEY, HONEY!

611
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53,898
JOSH, THERE'S
NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO.

612
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55,299
HE'S GOT PAPERS.

613
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,800
HE'S MY DOG!

614
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,203
PLEASE,
SIR, COULD WE PAY YOU?

615
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:01,805
LOOK, LADY, I JUST
WANT MY DOG BACK, OKAY?

616
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,907
HE HATES YOU!

617
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,041
HE HATES YOU!

618
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,042
BABY, IT'S OKAY.

619
01:04:05,075 --> 01:04:06,710
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, KID.

620
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:09,213
ON YOUR NEXT BIRTHDAY, ME AND THE DOG,
WE'LL COME OUT, WE'LL DO A SHOW FOR YOU CHEAP.

621
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:11,215
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

622
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:13,183
BABY, IT'S OKAY. JOSH!

623
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,422
PLEASE, JUST TALK TO ME!

624
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:21,525
PLEASE! WAIT!

625
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,988
A BEER COMMERCIAL?

626
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,557
NO, I DON'T WANT MY DOG
TO DO BEER COMMERCIALS.

627
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,064
PSST, BUDDY.

628
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:43,633
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I AM ANYWAY?

629
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:44,968
I GOT-- I'M-- I GOT--

630
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,070
LOOK, I GOT ETHICS.

631
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:47,704
BUDDY.

632
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,414
JUST FOR CURIOSITY'S SAKE
THOUGH,

633
01:06:57,447 --> 01:07:01,085
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT FOR
ONE OF THOSE BEER COMMERCIALS?

634
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,555
WOULD YOU SHUT UP
OUT THERE!

635
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:08,392
WHAT'S THAT?

636
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:11,061
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH? HEY, BUDDY.

637
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:15,065
OH, THAT KIND OF BLOWS ETHICS RIGHT OUT OF THE WATER,
DOESN'T IT?

638
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:16,400
I MEAN, HEY, HE'S JUST A DOG.

639
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:17,934
WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

640
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,669
NO, APRIL'S NOT GOOD FOR US.

641
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,538
WE'RE BOOKED ON A TOUR.

642
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,074
WAIT!

643
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:26,743
IS THAT OPRAH WOMAN-- OPRAH,
YOU KNOW, THE OPRAH WOMAN--

644
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,579
DOES SHE LIKE DOGS?

645
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:32,249
I'D LOVE TO DO JAY LENO.

646
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,683
HEY!

647
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,252
GET BACK HERE WITH MY DOG!

648
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:39,089
BUDDY, COME ON. RUN!

649
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:40,524
YOU LITTLE DARNED KID!

650
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:41,991
THAT'S MY DOG!

651
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,266
GO, BUDDY!

652
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,153
I GOT YOU, KID!

653
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:20,797
GO, BUDDY, GO!

654
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:05,175
HEY!

655
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:10,714
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

656
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:25,229
HEY!

657
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:28,398
YOU CAN'T RUN FAST ENOUGH!

658
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:43,847
I NEEDED THAT!

659
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,781
HEY!

660
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:21,285
I'M GONNA GET YOU,
YOU LITTLE--

661
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,439
THANKS.

662
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,809
HERE, BOY.

663
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,455
COME ON, BOY.

664
01:11:14,538 --> 01:11:16,540
BUDDY?

665
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,944
I KNOW YOU'RE ONLY A DOG,

666
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:23,947
SO I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GONNA SAY.

667
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,950
YOU CAN'T COME HOME
WITH ME.

668
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,419
THAT GUY'LL JUST COME
AND TAKE YOU BACK.

669
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:32,288
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND THAT--

670
01:11:32,322 --> 01:11:35,659
WELL, BUDDY, I FOUND YOU.

671
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:39,295
SOMEBODY ELSE
IS GONNA FIND YOU TOO.

672
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:43,700
I KNOW THEY'LL LOVE YOU,
SO I'M GONNA SET YOU FREE.

673
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:48,872
HERE, I GOT YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

674
01:11:53,577 --> 01:11:55,745
STUPID THING.

675
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:13,530
I WISH I COULD GO BACK TO BEFORE I
EVER KNEW YOU COULD MAKE A BASKET.

676
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:16,566
MAYBE NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE EVER HAPPENED.

677
01:12:29,613 --> 01:12:30,714
GO ON, BUDDY.

678
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:31,715
YOU'RE FREE NOW.

679
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:34,283
GO!

680
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,421
GO ON.

681
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:42,826
BUDDY! GET.

682
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,862
YOU HAVE TO GO, BUDDY.

683
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:50,834
PLEASE, BUDDY. GO.

684
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,869
GET!

685
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:57,407
GO! GET OUT OF HERE!

686
01:12:57,441 --> 01:12:59,909
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

687
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:01,545
GET!

688
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:02,879
I DON'T WANT YOU ANYMORE!

689
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,914
GET!

690
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:15,425
YOU WANNA PLAY, BUDDY?

691
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:17,927
YEAH, GOOD BOY.

692
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:21,297
COME ON, BUDDY.
YEAH, GOOD BOY.

693
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:24,000
JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

694
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,824
LET'S GO, WOLVES

695
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,031
LET'S GO, WOLVES

696
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:08,705
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
A TEAM IS A COMMUNITY,

697
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:11,908
WHICH MEANS WHEN ONE BOY
GETS THE CHICKEN POX,

698
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,910
HALF THE TEAM IS OUT.

699
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:17,113
YOU BOYS HAVE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU TONIGHT.
LET'S GO, WOLVES

700
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:25,421
THESE LAST MONTHS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD.

701
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:28,091
I OWE THAT
TO YOU BOYS HERE...

702
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:31,861
AND MAYBE TO A DOG...

703
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:34,097
WHO ISN'T HERE.

704
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,933
BECAUSE WHATEVER
HAPPENS TONIGHT,

705
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:40,570
THIS IS A TEAM,

706
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:43,673
AND THAT'S A VICTORY

717
01:16:20,644 --> 01:16:21,878
IT'S OKAY.

01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:36,720
I'M TIRED, COACH.

01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:37,553
WE'RE DYIN' OUT THERE.

734
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,289
YOU GOTTA LET THE BALL

735
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:42,291

01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,126
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO
LOSE ANYONE ELSE.

751
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,428
ALL RIGHT, THE GAME'S
NOT OVER YET.

752
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,798
A WHOLE LOT CAN HAPPEN
IN SEVEN MINUTES.

753
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,699

01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:33,769
LET'S FORFEIT.

762
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:35,071
WE'VE ONLY GOT FOUR PLAYERS.

763
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,305
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

764
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:38,241
HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
AND DO THE BEST YOU CAN.

765
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,743
WE'LL BEAT 'EM
WITH FOUR GUYS.

766
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,246
COME BACK HERE!

767
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,882
HEY, GET OUT OF THERE!

768
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:55,191
BUDDY!

769
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,998
BUDDY!

770
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:19,515
HEY, FELLAS, I GOT AN IDEA.

771
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,057
LET'S GO, WOLVES

772
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:31,260
K9 CHECKING IN.

773
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,031
LET'S GO, WOLVES

774
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:37,033
WHAT THE HECK'S
GOIN' ON HERE?

775
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:38,301
I'LL HANDLE THIS, JOSH.

776
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,535
THE TIMBERWOLVES
WANNA SUBSTITUTE A DOG.

777
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,370
WHAT ARE THEY, NUTS?

778
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:43,172
DOG'S A REGISTERED
MEMBER OF THE TEAM.

779
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:44,740
HE PRACTICES WITH THE TEAM.

780
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,075
HE TRAVELS WITH THE TEAM.

781
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:48,144
YOU CHECK IN YOUR RULE BOOK.

782
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,213
BET YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING
THAT SAYS A DOG CAN'T PLAY.

783
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:54,050
HE'S RIGHT.
AIN'T NO RULE THAT SAYS A DOG CAN'T PLAY BASKETBALL.

784
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,551
THIS IS A JOKE.

785
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,220
I MEAN,
DOGS DON'T PLAY BASKETBALL.

786
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:59,188
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
GENTLEMEN?

787
01:20:59,222 --> 01:21:01,090
AFRAID YOUR TEAM
MIGHT GET BEAT BY A DOG?

788
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,061
PUT HIM IN.

789
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:09,899
NOW ENTERING THE GAME,
NEW PLAYER...

790
01:21:09,933 --> 01:21:12,468
K9.

791
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:28,051
OKAY, BOY,
WE'RE JUST PLAYING. STAY.

792
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:29,785
STAY.

793
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,928
YES! YES!

794
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,085
YEAH!

795
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:02,818
NICE SHOT!

796
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,293
DOES HE DRIBBLE?

797
01:22:10,326 --> 01:22:12,328
NO, BUT HE MIGHT
DROOL A LITTLE BIT.

798
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,964
WON'T SOMEBODY
COVER THE DOG?

799
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:17,433
DON'T JUST LOOK AT THE DOG.
COVER HIM!

800
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,135
COME ON! COME ON, LARRY.

801
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:20,536
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE HUSTLE.

802
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:25,508
COME ON, LET'S GO!

803
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,947
GET IT, BUDDY.

804
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,116
LET IT GO, BUDDY.

805
01:22:33,149 --> 01:22:34,183
COME ON, BREAK IT UP.

806
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:35,151
BREAK IT UP.

807
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:36,085
GIVE ME THE BALL.

808
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:38,087
GIVE ME THE BALL.

809
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:44,360
AW, JEEZ.

810
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:54,337
COME ON. YOU READY?

811
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,638
HERE WE GO.

812
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:09,485
YEAH! ALL RIGHT!

813
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:11,187
THAT'S GREAT!

814
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,889
THAT'S THE WAY!

815
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:19,395
YEAH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

816
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,170
YES! YES!

817
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:31,207
WOULD SOMEBODY COVER
THE DOG?

818
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,343
COVER HIM.

819
01:23:34,377 --> 01:23:36,212
MY MOTHER COULD
COVER THAT DOG.

820
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:38,614
DOG'S IN FOR TWO MINUTES,
HE'S GOT THREE ASSISTS.

821
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:50,426
BUDDY, BUDDY, BUDDY, BUDDY!

822
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:52,928
BUDDY, BUDDY, BUDDY!

823
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:55,231
CAN SOMEONE COVER THAT DOG?
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

824
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,165
OH, HE'S TRAVELING.

825
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:57,066
HE'S TRAVELING.
TRAVELING DOG.

826
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,601
DON'T LET HIM GO TO HIS LEFT.

827
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:00,369
DON'T LET HIM GO TO HIS LEFT.

828
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:16,085
GOOD DOG, BUDDY!

829
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:17,620
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

830
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:27,663
WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THAT DOG! GO!

831
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:31,467
FOUL, NUMBER SIX.

832
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,635
ONE AND ONE.

833
01:24:38,507 --> 01:24:40,476
COME ON, BUDDY!

834
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:43,212
T-TOSS IT TO HIM,
I GUESS.

835
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:45,248
THAT'S IT, BUDDY. GO ON.

836
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,283
YOU CAN DO IT, BUDDY.
YOU CAN DO IT.

837
01:25:22,518 --> 01:25:25,154
LARRY, GET IN THERE!

838
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:38,201
TEAMWORK! TEAMWORK!

839
01:26:42,598 --> 01:26:44,099
THAT'S MY SON!

840
01:26:45,468 --> 01:26:47,236
YES!

841
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:51,807
WATER BOY!

842
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,480
NICE SHOT.

843
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:00,783
I'LL TAKE
MY DOG BACK NOW.

844
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:03,752
HE DOESN'T WANNA GO WITH YOU.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

845
01:27:03,786 --> 01:27:05,788
THERE'S NO PROBLEM,
MS. FRAMM.

846
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:07,623
YOUR SON'S HAD
HIS LITTLE FUN.

847
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,425
NOW I THINK IT'S TIME TO GIVE ME BACK WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE.

848
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:11,794
YOU KNOW WHAT, MR. SNIVELY,
I BELIEVE MY SON IS RIGHT.

849
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:13,596
THAT DOG DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

850
01:27:13,629 --> 01:27:15,431
SO THE ANSWER IS NO.

851
01:27:15,464 --> 01:27:19,402
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY CHOICE, LADY.

852
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:22,305
I GOT PAPERS.

853
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:30,313
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.

854
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:37,152
SNIVELY VERSUS FRAMM.

855
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:42,458
THIS ONE OF YOUR
HIGH-PROFILE DIVORCE CASES?

856
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:44,460
NO, SIR.

857
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:46,462
CUSTODY. OH, CUSTODY.

858
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:49,765
HOLY TOLEDO, WHAT IS THAT DOG
DOING IN THE COURTHOUSE?

859
01:27:49,798 --> 01:27:51,900
THAT'S THE, UH, CHILD, SIR.

860
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:55,504
THAT'S A PRETTY UGLY KID.

861
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:59,241
IT'S A DOG.

862
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,643
WHAT?

863
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:02,277
THE CASE IS ABOUT
CUSTODY OF A DOG.

864
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:05,748
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE IT,
BUT WE HAVE TO DO THIS SERIOUSLY.

865
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:10,353
I WILL NOT HAVE MY COURTROOM
TURNED INTO SOME KIND OF A CIRCUS.

866
01:28:14,523 --> 01:28:16,792
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

867
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:20,663
MR. NORMAN F. SNIVELY,
YOUR HONOR.

868
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:22,798
I'M THE PLAINTIFF.

869
01:28:26,234 --> 01:28:27,770
YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

870
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:29,438
WHY, THANK YOU, SIR.

871
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:31,306
SEE,
I'M A CLOWN BY PROFESSION.

872
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,841
HAPPY SLAPPY'S THE NAME.
CLOWN AND THE HOUND.

873
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:35,711
BEGGING YOUR HUMBLEST PARDON,
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO YOUR HONOR...

874
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:37,713
IF I APPEARED HERE TODAY IN THE GUISE MOST PERTINENT...

875
01:28:37,746 --> 01:28:41,283
TO THE COGENT AND UNEQUIVOCAL
STATING OF MY CASE.

876
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,685
WHATEVER, WHATEVER.

877
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,319
Y-Y-YOU GO FIRST, CLOWN.

878
01:28:44,353 --> 01:28:46,288
WELL,
THE FACT IS, YOUR HONOR,

879
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,223
THAT DOG'S MY PROPERTY, AND
I HAVE PAPERS TO PROVE IT.

880
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:51,293
WELL, WOULD YOU SHOW THEM
TO ME, PLEASE?

881
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:54,697
WELL, ACTUALLY, YOUR HONOR,
I-I HAD PAPERS TO PROVE IT.

882
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:55,798
BUT THAT BOY--

883
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,466
THAT YOUNG HOOLIGAN--

884
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,569
BECAUSE OF HIS IRRESPONSIBLE AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY,
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU SEE.

885
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:02,304
ORDER!

886
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,708
YOU SEE, SIR, WHEN I LOST
MY DOG FOR THE FIRST TIME,

887
01:29:05,741 --> 01:29:07,710
IT BROKE ME UP REAL BAD.

888
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:10,312
WHEN I LOST HIM THE SECOND TIME,
IT DARN NEAR KILLED ME.

889
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,682
HELL'S BELLS, YOUR HONOR,
ALL I WANNA DO IS GET OLD BLUE BACK.

890
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:17,486
SO IT CAN BE HIM AND ME TOGETHER JUST LIKE IT ALWAYS WAS.

891
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,321
WHY? SO YOU CAN ABUSE HIM
SOME MORE?

892
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,824
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH,
YOUNG MAN. -

893
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,692
I RAISED THAT
DOG FROM A PUPPY.

894
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,461
I WOULDN'T HARM
A HAIR ON HIS HEAD!

895
01:29:27,596 --> 01:29:29,665
BAILIFF, WHAT IS THAT?

896
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,734
THE DOG, YOUR HONOR.

897
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:34,537
ORDER!

898
01:29:35,604 --> 01:29:37,440
QUIET!

899
01:29:37,473 --> 01:29:38,907
IT'S THE GAVEL, SIR.

900
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:40,576
WHAT?
SPEAK UP! -

901
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:41,744
BAILIFF!

902
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:42,778
YOU SAID "SPEAK."

903
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:44,079
SPEAK!

904
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:46,281
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE
SUPPRESS THAT DOG?

905
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:48,350
SHH!

906
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,418
OH, WHAT A DAY.

907
01:29:49,452 --> 01:29:50,385
WHAT A DAY.

908
01:29:52,455 --> 01:29:54,423
NOW THEN--

909
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:57,726
YOUNG MAN,
HAVE YOU ANY EVIDENCE...

910
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,762
THAT THIS MAN
ABUSED YOUR DOG?

911
01:30:01,764 --> 01:30:04,567
DID YOU EVER SEE HIM
HIT THE DOG?

912
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,570
WELL... NO.

913
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:09,938
THEN HOW DID YOU KNOW
THE DOG WAS ABUSED?

914
01:30:09,972 --> 01:30:11,907
BECAUSE BUDDY
DOESN'T LIKE HIM.

915
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,809
BUDDY'S MY FRIEND.

916
01:30:13,842 --> 01:30:18,614
I KNOW WHAT HE'S FEELING,
SO HE KNOWS WHAT I'M FEELING.

917
01:30:18,647 --> 01:30:20,649
- HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH,
YOUR HONOR. - WHO'S THAT?

918
01:30:20,683 --> 01:30:22,818
THE BOY'S MOTHER.

919
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:24,987
OH,
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YOU MAY SP--

920
01:30:25,988 --> 01:30:28,323
YOU MAY ADDRESS THE COURT.

921
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,960
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED
TO THIS TOWN,

922
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:34,730
UH, MY SON...

923
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,965
WAS VERY UNHAPPY.

924
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:39,735
AND THEN HE FOUND BUDDY HERE.

925
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,738
BUDDY'S GIVEN HIM SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

926
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:47,442
PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T TAKE BUDDY AWAY FROM MY SON.

927
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:49,444
MRS. FRAMM, AS FAR AS
THIS COURT IS CONCERNED,

928
01:30:49,478 --> 01:30:51,680
THE DOG IS PROPERTY UNLESS YOU HAVE EVIDENCE-- YOUR HONOR.

929
01:30:51,714 --> 01:30:56,351
ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE DID NOT COME
HERE BECAUSE OF A PIECE OF PROPERTY.

930
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:00,088
THEY CAME HERE BECAUSE OF BUDDY.
HE'S PART OF THIS TOWN.

931
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:03,492
HE'S PART OF THE TEAM,
AND HE'S PART OF OUR FAMILY NOW, YOUR HONOR.

932
01:31:03,526 --> 01:31:05,994
WELL, HE'S PART
OF MY FAMILY TOO!

933
01:31:06,028 --> 01:31:08,030
HE'S LIKE A SON TO ME!

934
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,833
SHUT UP!

935
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:16,605
WHY NOT LET THE DOG CHOOSE,
YOUR HONOR?

936
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,775
THEY SAY A DOG
IS MAN'S BEST FRIEND.

937
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,844
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

938
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:25,013
SHOULDN'T THE DOG BE ABLE TO CHOOSE
WHO HE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH?

939
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:26,815
WHO ARE YOU,
BARNUM OR BAILEY?

940
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:28,717
ARTHUR CHANEY, YOUR HONOR.

941
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:30,653
MR. CHANEY, DO YOU REALI--

942
01:31:30,686 --> 01:31:32,988
ARTHUR CHANEY?

943
01:31:33,021 --> 01:31:35,490
NEW YORK KNICKS, '56?

944
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:37,860
HUH.
I WAS AT THAT CELTICS GAME

945
01:31:37,893 --> 01:31:40,128
WHERE YOU DID THE TURNAROUND JUMPER AT THE BUZZER.

946
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:43,398
I SPILLED BEER
ALL OVER MY WIFE.

947
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:45,568
YOUR HONOR.

948
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:46,635
WHAT?

949
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:49,004
OH, YES, YES, YES.

950
01:31:49,037 --> 01:31:51,006
MR. CHANEY.

951
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:52,908
WELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

952
01:31:52,941 --> 01:31:56,144
THIS DOG'S WHAT,
THREE, FOUR YEARS OLD.

953
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:59,715
THAT MAKES HIM AN ADULT
IN OUR YEARS.

954
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:01,049
I SAY LET BUDDY DECIDE.

955
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:05,020
MR.
CHANEY, DURING MY 40 YEARS ON THE BENCH,

956
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:10,425
I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF LAMEBRAIN COCKAMAMIE PROPOSALS,

957
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:15,063
BUT THIS ONE, I LIKE.

958
01:32:15,097 --> 01:32:17,566
MOVE BACK, EVERYBODY!

959
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,902
WAY BACK.
COME ALONG NOW. WAY BACK.

960
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,072
GENTLEMEN,
STAY ON YOUR SPOTS.

961
01:32:24,106 --> 01:32:28,877
IF YOU'LL TAKE JUST ONE SINGLE STEP TOWARD THAT DOG,
YOU LOSE.

962
01:32:28,911 --> 01:32:30,946
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

963
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:35,951
NOW, BEGIN CALLING THE DOG.

964
01:32:35,984 --> 01:32:39,221
OLD BLUE,
COME TO DADDY.

965
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:41,523
BUDDY, COME ON.

966
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,592
BUDDY, COME ON, PLEASE.
BUDDY, BUDDY.

967
01:32:43,626 --> 01:32:45,027
BUDDY, BUDDY!

968
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:45,894
DADDY LOVES YA, BABY.

969
01:32:45,928 --> 01:32:46,762
BUDDY, BUDDY.

970
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:48,597
BUDDY, COME ON, PLEASE.

01:32:48,631 --> 01:32:50,465
BUDDY, COME ON.
DADDY LOVES YA.

972
01:32:50,498 --> 01:32:51,533
HEY, BUDDY!

COME ON. COME ON, BOY!

BUDDY, COME ON. COME ON.

975
01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:54,870
DON'T PAY ANY
ATTENTION TO THAT BOY.

976
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,939
COME ON. YOU WANNA
COME TO ME. BUDDY!

977
01:32:56,972 --> 01:32:58,206
BUDDY! BUDDY!

978
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,608
COME TO DADDY!

979
01:32:59,642 --> 01:33:00,909

01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:02,144
COME ON, BUDDY. - HEY, BLUE!

981
01:33:02,177 --> 01:33:04,112
BLUE, BLUE, COME ON.

01:33:04,146 --> 01:33:06,281
- COME ON, BUDDY.

983
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:08,617
PLEASE.
PLEASE, BUDDY. - BLUE!

984
01:33:08,651 --> 01:33:10,986
COME ON.

01:33:11,019 --> 01:33:13,488
BLUE! HEY,

01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:18,894
BUDDY! BUDDY!

989
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,495
OLD FRIEND, COME ON.

990
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:21,964
COME THIS WAY. COME ON.

991
01:33:21,997 --> 01:33:23,565
BUDDY, NO. BUDDY, NO!

992
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:24,933
GET OVER HERE!

993
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,803
THAT'S RIGHT, BOY.

994
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:29,304
COME ON. COME ON.

995
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:30,305
COME ON.

996
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,173
OVER THIS WAY. BUDDY, DON'T!

997
01:33:31,206 --> 01:33:32,908
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.

998
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,609
BUDDY, NO!
- GET OVER HERE!

999
01:33:34,643 --> 01:33:35,744
GET OVER HERE!

1000
01:33:36,879 --> 01:33:39,648
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1001
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:44,152
STUPID DOG!

1002
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:46,188
YEAH, COME ON!

1003
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:53,628
BY THE POWERS VESTED IN ME,
I AWARD CUSTODY OF THE DOG TO JOSH FRAMM.

1004
01:33:53,662 --> 01:33:55,097
CASE CLOSED.

1005
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,699
THANK GOD.

1006
01:33:56,732 --> 01:33:59,601
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

1007
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,103
THAT DOG IS MY DOG!

1008
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:02,771
I GOT PICTURES!

1009
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:05,573
WILL SOMEBODY SUPPRESS
THAT CLOWN?

1010
01:34:32,234 --> 01:34:34,569
HEY,
BUDDY, DO YOU WANNA PLAY?

1011
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:36,571
YEAH, JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.
