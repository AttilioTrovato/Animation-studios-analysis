1
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:13,481
- Bring it in, Gordon.
- Okay, Dad.

2
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:16,646
All right! Way to shoot, there.
You look good, son.

3
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:18,656
Thanks.

4
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:21,716
Listen, i want you
to remember this pond.

5
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:24,887
No matter how far you go,
don't forget your home.

6
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:45,114
Here in the third period, where the
Minnehaha Waves led by Gordon Bombay...

7
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,547
are in the lead four to one.
What a story this is.!

8
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:51,916
He went from a legal career to coach
the Minneapolis Mighty Ducks...

9
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,547
to a State Pee Wee
Championship last year.

10
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:57,114
And this year, at age 29...

11
00:01:57,192 --> 00:02:00,558
he's one short step away
from the N.H.L.

12
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:04,462
There's the puck at center ice.
It's intercepted by Gordon Bombay.

13
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:07,558
Bombay across the blue line. He's in
all alone. Great chance for Bombay.

14
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:10,535
Dekes once, twice, in front.
He shoots. He scores.!

15
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:13,539
Yeah!

16
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:16,701
Gordon Bombay, unassisted,
puts his team up five to one.

17
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:19,404
Boy, he can still fly.

18
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:23,414
Ifhe keeps this up, I'd expect to see
him in the National Hockey League...

19
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,450
real soon.

20
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:44,334
Here's Bombay in his own zone. Comes up the
right wing side, steps away from one check there.

21
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,336
Still has the puck at center ice.
Gets pinned along the boards.

22
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:50,305
Fights to get free.

23
00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:53,569
Aah! Aah!

24
00:02:57,013 --> 00:03:01,472
Oh, what a hit.!
Bombay goes down hard.

25
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,043
~Like the river flows ~

26
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:17,076
~Like the snow melts ~

27
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:23,253
~ You're gonna find your situation ~

28
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:26,053
~ Changing for the better ~

29
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:31,560
~Like the melting snow ~

30
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,757
~Just let your troubles go ~

31
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:40,169
~ 'Cause you and I ~

32
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,766
~ will get through this together ~

33
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:51,846
- ~Some days seem to drag on forever ~
- it's great to be home.

34
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,010
~ You need all your strength ~

35
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,918
- ~Just to keep your head together ~
- Hello,Jan!

36
00:04:57,988 --> 00:05:01,424
Welcome back, Gordon.
Get in! Get in!

37
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:04,256
Thanks for comin' down to get me.

38
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,457
Great to see ya.

39
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:11,466
Hans couldn't make it?

40
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:14,435
Ah, don't get me
started on that strudel-head.

41
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,529
He went back
to the old country for the summer.

42
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:19,267
Left me to run
the shop all by myself.

43
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,309
Wanted to visit our mama.

44
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:23,901
She loves him more, you know.

45
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:30,312
~ This too will pass ~

46
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:36,221
~ This too will pass ~~

47
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:42,722
- Sorry, did i wake you?
- Hey, Charlie.

48
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:46,128
- Hey, Coach. it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

49
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,464
We really missed you.

50
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:52,402
For breakfast, my specialty:
Jan's hasen-

51
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:54,405
Hasenpfeffer and eggs.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:56,464
I thought I smelled
something burning.

53
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:59,136
i see you've met
my new apprentice.

54
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:01,610
Jan told me you did
this job when you were my age.

55
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,910
- That's right. i hope he pays you more than he paid me.
- You got paid?

56
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:08,180
Eat, everybody, before
the hasenpfeffer gets cold.

57
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,631
That was a good day.

58
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,633
Look at Charlie. God, he's grown.

59
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,760
Oh. They do that.

60
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:32,034
Since his mother remarried, he
started spending a lot of time here.

61
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:34,371
i just had to hire him.

62
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:37,605
- i should've kept in touch more.
- But you are here now.

63
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,613
So what's your plan?

64
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,615
Have you talked
to Ducksworth?

65
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:45,550
No, no. i'm not a lawyer,
Jan, i'm a player.

66
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:49,020
But your injury,
it requires rest and time.

67
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,523
Yeah, time is something
i don't have a whole lot of.

68
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:56,187
i was this close to the N.H.L.,Jan.
i was back in the game.

69
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,856
And, man, i was alive.

70
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,867
Have you thought about coaching?

71
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:06,233
After all, you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.

72
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:09,240
Well, coaching the Ducks was one
of the best things in my life...

73
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:11,242
but i can't make a living
coaching Pee Wee hockey.

74
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,574
Where there's a way,
there must be a will.

75
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:17,580
My hockey suppliers tell me
Team U.S.A. is still without a coach...

76
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:19,582
for the
Junior Goodwill Games.

77
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,050
Sounds great. Give 'em
a call for me,Jan.

78
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,713
- Maybe i can sharpen their skates.
- Don't knock skate sharpening.

79
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,087
i know.
it's a great skill,Jan.

80
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:31,650
But i don't want to spend the rest of my life
sharpening skates in this rinky-dink town.

81
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,889
i want something better.

82
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:36,829
Something bigger.

83
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:44,332
Whoa!

84
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,405
- You don't have to do them right now.
- Oh, thanks.

85
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,415
You have a customer.
Go and help him.

86
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,746
Then come back and do them.

87
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,758
- Can i help you?
- Oh!

88
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:08,851
Oops, sorry.
Got away from me. Hi.

89
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:12,728
Oh, wow, yeah.
You look great. Yeah.

90
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:15,358
- Yeah, much better than your pictures.
- Thanks.

91
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,526
i'm, uh, Don Tibbles...

92
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,627
Senior V.P.,
Hendrix Hockey Apparel.

93
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:23,140
How's the knee? i have a doctor in Los
Angeles i want to take a look at it.

94
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,575
- He's doing great things with baboon ligaments.
- Hendrix Hockey, huh?

95
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,703
What exactly is it that
you want, Mr. Tibbles?

96
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,975
i want you, Gordon.

97
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,984
i want the next coach ofTeam
U.S.A. to become a household name.

98
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,247
i want you to become
synonymous with winning...

99
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:39,311
and winning to become
synonymous with Hendrix.

100
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:43,587
Er, wait a minute.
Y- You're joking, right? i mean...

101
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,686
- this is a joke.
- it's no joke. This is the real thing, Gordon.

102
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:51,626
You want me to coach
Team U.S.A.?

103
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,998
Your friend Jan's been
pitching you for months.

104
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:57,470
Gordon, what you did with the
Ducks, there was magic, and we-

105
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,472
and by we, i mean
Hendrix Hockey...

106
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,476
theJunior Goodwill Games and your country
- need that magic.

107
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,002
What do ya say, coach?

108
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,983
Come on.
Let's round up those Ducks.

109
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,383
- Got a lot of work to do.
- Gordon.

110
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,354
Use this.

111
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:21,382
- Thanks,Jan.
- Go get 'em, Gordon.

112
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:38,372
Hey, Charlie.!

113
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:43,041
Hey.! You wanna
play some hockey?

114
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:00,962
Watch me go.!
This is your last chance.!

115
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,327
Come on, man! Move it!

116

Yes! Yeah!

Jesse, we're back!
- Hey, Charlie!

118
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:12,406
Let's go get Averman.

119
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:17,301
- Look out!
- You can't-

120
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:19,174
What are you kids

121
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:21,373
- Whoa, hey!

123
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:29,318

- Where we goin' now?
- Gotta get Connie and Guy.

130

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

132
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:27,595
Whoa!

133
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:31,132
- Aah!
- Yeah.!

134
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,237
Oh!

135
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,051
Oh, look.

136
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:47,285
Goldberg.!

137
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:52,426
Come on, Goldberg!

- Whoa!
- Yeah!

141
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,976
He's comin' across the goalie,
between his legs- Score!

142
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,076
Hey, cake-eater,you wanna

00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,484
- Yeah, come on!
- Yeah!

144
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:26,021
Guys, it's an international

145
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:28,028
Hey, man, bring 'em on.
We're ready!

146
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:31,394

00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,694
Ow! Ooh!
Hi.

148
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:40,103
Ducks!

149
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:43,301
I still can't believe
they beat us last year.

150
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:46,072
Well, let's do
somethin' about it.

151
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,239
Yeah.! All right.!

152
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:56,144

00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:04,186
- Come on. Over here. Over here.
- Shh.

155
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,855
They're sittin' ducks.

156
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,695
- Here they come.
- i love this.

157
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,700
They are so stupid.

158
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:15,363
One large order of
shredded duck comin'up.

159
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:18,566
- They won't know what hit 'em.
- i know.

160
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,907
Who said that?

161
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:26,647
Hi, guys.

162
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,042
Hey, come here!

00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:45,493
Come on, let us go!
My mom's pickin' me up!

167
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,262
That'll teach ya to mess

168
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:51,998
- Yeah!

169
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:55,131

Awesome.! Wow.! Who's in there?

Well, i got something
to show you.

185
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,551
This is your endorsement
contract with Hendrix.

186
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,558
i been tryin' to figure this out.
What does Hendrix want with me?

187
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,153
- i-i'm just a coach.
- Pat Riley, Bear Bryant...

188
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,459
Mike Ditka,
are theyjust coaches?

189
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,796
Gordon, today coaches have
images. Images mean dollars.

190
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:05,929
i sell you, you sell the sport.
We both get rich. How's that sound?

191
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,405
- Don't get me wrong. i don't have anything against making money.
- No, Gordon.

192
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,943
A lot of money.

193
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,775
You're gonna pay me that much
to endorse sportswear?

194
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,975
Gordon, life can be great
when you know the right people.

195
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,177
What do you say?

196
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,482
- Got a pen?
- Oh,yeah.

197
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:26,987
Former Pee Wee coach and minor
league player Gordon Bombay...

198
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:31,357
makes the move to the national stage as
he steps behind the bench for Team U.S.A.

199
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:35,626
Coach Bombay's Ducks will bejoined
by some of the top young players...

200
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,633
from around the United States.

201
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,863
Tell me about my new kids.
- That's Luis Mendoza.

202
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:44,303
He's from our Miami club.
A real speedster. Incredible skater.

203
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:48,002
I clocked him at 1.9 seconds,
blue line to blue line.

204
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:59,716
- Good-lookin' skater. - Very
good-lookin'. What do you think, Guy?

205
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:02,483
- Shut up, Averman.
- Oof!.

206
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:04,490
He has one minor problem.

207
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:07,049
Aah!

208
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:10,187
- Has a little trouble stopping.
- i'd say so.

209
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,356
- Are you okay?
- Need some help?

210
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,559
Yeah. i'm all right.
i almost had it that time.

211
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:22,498
Yee-haw! How is everyone!
Y'all ready to play some puck?

212
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:25,805
- Hey, look.
it's Hopalong Gretzky.

213
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:28,368
That's Dwayne Robertson
from Austin.

214
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,380
He's the best puck handler
I've ever seen.

215
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,211
- You mean for his age.
- No, i don't.

216
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,549
Hey, this is easier than
ropin' hogs! Yee-haw!

217
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:41,018
- He does have a tendency to showboat.
- Yahoo!

218
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:44,548
- Wow.
- There's Julie "The Cat'"Gaffney.

219
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:47,528
She won the state championship
for Maine three years in a row.

220
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:49,758
Well, we have a goalie.
Goldberg.

221
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,131
All right! Bring 'em on, man! i'm ready
for this! i'm the man! i'm the man!

222
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,669
Ohh.!

223
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:57,830
Uh, help.

224
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:00,966
Watch this.

225
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:08,206
Well, we...
could use a backup.

226
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:11,376
Isn't that that kid from the
Olympics? The figure skater?

227
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:14,352
Yup. Ken Wu.
What can I say?

228
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,889
I convinced him that hockey
had more of a future.

229
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:20,085
We put a stick in his hands
and nobody's been able to touch him.

230
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,854
Yeah. Show time!

231
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:29,128
- That guy's a teenager?
- ~ Don't you know that ~

232
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:33,262
~ Everything's on fire, yeah ~

233
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:36,136
- Uh, yeah. Hormones.
- He's a goon.

234
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:39,540
- Ohh!
- C'mon, Tex! Sing it with me!

235
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:42,910
- Uh-uh! No!
- ~ Everything ~

236
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,915
- Here ya go, sweetie!
- My kids don't play that kinda hockey.

237
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,144
i believe they're
called enforcers, Gordon.

238
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:51,153
- When you play iceland, you're gonna need him.
- My little man!

239
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:54,054
- Who does this guy
think he is?

240
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,717
- All right, that's it!
- Let me take care of this.

241
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:08,499
Everybody freeze!

242
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:11,931
Now, we didn't
come here to fight!

243
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,941
We came here to play hockey!

244
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,341
We're Team U.S.A.
You represent your country.

245
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:20,107
- That's right.
- Now, i want you-

246
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,114
To be all that you

00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:25,117
Ya gotta raise yourself up,

00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:28,244
- All right, now. Let's

249
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,085
Great! Scrimmage!
You heard your coach! Now-

250
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,318
Hey. You don't need me here.

251
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:36,328
i've got an appointment anyway.
i've got to see Miss MacKay.

252
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:38,920
- She's the team tutor.
- Don?

253
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,500
Come on.

254
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:46,332
You'll get it back
at the end of the school term.

255
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,872
All right, Ducks.

256
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,636
Show 'em what you got!
Let's scrimmage!

257
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,646
- Great day for hockey, ain't it?
- Sure is, cowboy.

258
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,842
Yee-haw!

259
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:07,715
- Hey, man, take it easy! Slow down!
- Goldberg, look out!

260
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:11,621
Oh, no!

261
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,787
This guy's gotta
learn how to stop.

262
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,195
- Thanks for breaking my fall.
- Anytime.

263
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:21,035
- Let's go, defense!
- Whoa!

264
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,974
Come on!
Dig it out of there!

265
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,976
Let's go! Come on!

266
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,977
Haven't you guys been training
in the off-season?

267
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,378
You know, i knew
we forgot somethin'.

268
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,484
Good shot, Adam.
Way to show 'em.!

269
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,916
- How do you feel,
tough guy?

270
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,093
Ding! Round one.

271
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:54,493
Wait 'til you meet these kids.
They're just fantastic.

272
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:59,662
- Look out!
- It's Fulton.! Look out for his shot.!

273
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:02,103
What a bunch of wusses!

274
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:04,800
Oh!

275
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:10,945
Half of'em are ringers from various
parts of the U.S. Then the other half-

276
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:12,948
- Duck!
- That's right. The Ducks.

277
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:16,182
Hello? Mr. Tibbles?

278
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:20,086
Mr.. Tibbles?
Mr. Tibbles, can you hear me?

279
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:22,919
Mr. Tibbles, wake up.

280
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:26,256
Oh, Mr. Tibbles,
are you all right?

281
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:30,025
Oh, uh, i-i'll have the cheeseburger,
fries, and a chocolate shake, please.

282
00:20:32,134 --> 00:20:35,569
i think he'll be okay.
We'll keep an eye on him.

283
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:38,571
Oh, i'm sorry. He didn't
have a chance to introduce us.

284
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,233
i'm Michele MacKay,
their tutor.

285
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,606
Hi, i'm Coach Bombay,
their coach.

286
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:47,077
- Who said we need a tutor? - Yeah.
Really. - i don't need no school.

287
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,843
Now, Miss MacKay,
we're America's team here.

288
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,883
Shouldn't we just
be concentrating on hockey?

289
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,078
May i suggest
optional attendance?

290
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,781
- i agree.
- Yeah. Good idea.

291
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,086
- Well, that's not a bad idea.
- Call me Goldberg.

292
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,560
Goldberg. Yes.
School will be optional.

293
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,823
However-

294
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:10,266
However, should you not attend,
you will not be eligible to play.

295
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:14,270
Oh, that's unfair.!
Man, can she do that?

296
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:17,500
Hey, is that a tattoo?
is it real?

297
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:20,509
- Get away from me.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:27,142
Well, i'm just here to tutor the kids and
provide them with a little adult supervision.

299
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:35,323
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh!

300
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:38,917
- That was awesome. Are you okay?
- Yes.

301
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,018
All right.!

302
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:45,999
- Sorry.
- Yeah, sorry.

303
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,125
We're okay.

304
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:53,672
This is more crowded than
a truckload of goats.

305
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,675
Somebody better
watch their hands.

306
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:58,767
Yeah, someone licked me!

307
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:02,303
- Oh, i smell somethin'. Eewh.
- Eewh.

308
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,508
Goldberg!

309
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:07,519
- it wasn't me.
- No, it was me!

310
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,554
Thank you.

311
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,556
i don't know how to make
this any clearer.

312
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,785
You are a team.

313
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,523
And to win this thing,
you have to work as one.

314
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:21,724
Now as one, skate.

315
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,132
Whoa!

316
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:28,137
Everyone goes their own way,
everyone falls down.

317
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:30,138
Now get up and try it again.

318
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:33,698
- All right, all of you move to your right. Now.
- Who made you boss?

319
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:36,711
- Everyone to the left.
- Yeah, left guys. Come on.

320
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,544
- Aw, man.
- You guys can argue all you want...

321
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:43,551
but i am not untying you
until you move as one.

322
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,419
Now you're learning!
Communication! That's it!

323
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,650
Good, together.
Move together.

324
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:53,023
Charge! All right!

325
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,028
- Right turn!
- Turn right.

326
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:58,657
Yeah, that's it! That's it!
All right! Knock wood, Charlie.

327
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:02,691
You guys are startin' to look like
hockey players. i'm proud of ya, team.

328
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:04,703
You worked hard today.

329
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,467
But hockey
should also be fun.

330
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:09,838
- Rancher Dwayne.
- Yes, sir!

331
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,901
- Round me up some stray
cattle there. - Uh-oh.

332
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,912
- My pleasure!
- Whoa!

333
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,349
~ Together we stand
Divided we fall ~

334
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:22,750
~ Come on, people
Let's all get on the ball ~

335
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,879
~And work together ~

336
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:28,949
~ Come on, come on
Let's work together ~

337
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:31,018
~Now, people ~

338
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:35,758
~Because together we will stand
every boy, every woman ~

339
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,766
~And man ~

340
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:43,633
~Make someone happy,y'all
Now make someone smile ~

341
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:47,267
~Let's all work together
and make life worthwhile ~

342
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,243
~Let's work together ~

343
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:52,475
~ Come on, come on
Let's work together ~

344
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:55,072
~ Uh hey now, people ~

345
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,281
~Because together we will stand
every boy, every woman ~

346
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,290
~And man ~~

347
00:24:09,964 --> 00:24:13,832
- ~ Ta da ~~
- Oh! That's awesome!

348
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,501
- Hey, y'all. That's us!
- Duh, whatta ya know?

349
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:21,972
- Today,
it's a Wheaties box.

350
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:27,103
Tomorrow, it's video games, action
figures, lunch boxes. The sky is the limit.

351
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,273
Now,just to make sure
that everybody knows who you are...

352
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:33,011
try on one of these.

353
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:37,180
- Oh, that's so cool!
- Brought to you by those wonderful people at Hendrix...

354
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:40,691
for all your hockey needs.
Fulton, there you go. Coach.

355
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,784
Everybody take your own. I'm not
gonna give 'em out to everybody.

356
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:50,830
That's nice, Coach, but we're Ducks.
This stuff says "Hendrix" all over it.

357
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,266
Well, yeah, they're
our sponsors, Charlie.

358
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:55,531
So what?
Can't we be U.S.A. Ducks?

359
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,697
Or at least
keep our own colors?

360
00:24:57,773 --> 00:25:00,333
it's business stuff, Charlie.
Don't worry about it.

361
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:05,044
- What'd ya think?
- i love it. it's cool.

362
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,617
Ancient Greece was the beginning
of Western Civilization.

363
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:15,178
See, in Greece, they didn't
have professional sports...

364
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:17,383
or Wheaties boxes.

365
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:19,982
So the athletes competed
for another reason.

366
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,551
- Anybody?
- Falafels?

367
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:25,564
- Ohh. Greg.
- You wish, Goldberg.

368
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:28,691
- Charlie?
- Pride.

369
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:32,534
That's right. The various
city-states waved their flags...

370
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:34,539
and wore
their home colors proudly.

371
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,802
Did America always dominate?

372
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,706
- Fulton.
- That's a good question.

373
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:42,645
- No. America wasn't
around back then.

374
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:45,478
- it's okay.
- Don't forget that compared to other countries...

375
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,076
America is still young,
still forming its own identity.

376
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:54,090
- America is a teenagerjust like you.
- Like us?

377
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:57,753
You bet.
A little awkward at times...

378
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:02,093
but always right there
on the verge of greatness.

379
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:06,027
~ i don't know but i been told ~

380
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:09,401
~ Team U.S.A.'s gonna win the gold ~

381
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:11,336
~ U.S.A.'s gonna win the gold ~

382
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:14,000
~Listen up and listen good ~

383
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:15,407
~ Listen up and listen good ~

384
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:20,106
~ We're all headed for Hollywood ~

385
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:22,775
- ~Sound off ~
- ~ One, two ~

386
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,011
- ~Sound off ~
- ~ Three, four ~

387
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:28,613
- ~Bring 'em on down ~
- ~ One, two, three, four ~~

388
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:40,897
Welcome to Los Angeles, California,
and theJunior Goodwill Games...

389
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:45,426
as teams from around the world arrive to
compete in both winter and summer events.

390
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:49,235
The U.S.A. is expected to
score well in the medal count...

391
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,868
especially in basketball,
swimming and hockey.

392
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,879
And there's Team U.S.A. hockey
led by Coach Gordon Bombay.

393
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,508
They're looking fit and anxious
to begin the competition.

394
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:05,317
Tonight's game matches
the second-seeded Team U.S.A...

395
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:08,222
against the tenth-seeded team,
Trinidad Tobago.

396
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:12,387
This marks the first game for Team
U.S.A. in this double-elimination...

397
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:14,725
winner-take-all
tournament.

398
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:20,235
Gordon Bombay looks to have his team well
in control here. They lead six to nothing.

399
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:31,243
This is sewn up tight!

400
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:33,610
All right! Yeah!

401
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:37,980
Yeah, high-five some more. Man, my
little brother could score on these guys.

402
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:42,112
- Go bother him, then. - Ha-ha!
i ain't even got a little brother!

403
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:44,316
Hey,Jesse.! Quit gabbin'
and get on the ice.

404
00:27:44,391 --> 00:27:46,324
Show me
you want it, son. Go!

405
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:49,088
Yeah, show us

406
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,324

00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:05,505
- Ohh!
Face-off!.

408
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:07,510
Hey, what's
your problem, man?

409
00:28:07,578 --> 00:28:10,479
Jesse, forget about it.!
Let's go.!

410
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:14,211
U.S.A. penalty, number nine,
Hall. Two minutes, roughing.

411
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:17,344
He dissed you bad, G.

412
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,184
- Yeah? Come here, man!
- Ha-ha. Bye-bye.

413
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:23,419
Have a nice day.

414
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:33,595
- All right, Fulton, let's have some fun!
- Yeah, Portman, let's do it!

415
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:43,542
- All right!
- Yeah! Yeah!

416
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:45,772
- That's it.
- All right, Portman, take it!

417
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:51,049

418
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:53,677
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

419
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:56,221
- Yeah!
- All right!

420
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,689
- Yeah!
- Look at those guys! Look at 'em!

421
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:03,194
They're the Bash Brothers!

422
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:06,060
Hey, ya got a girl
in the stands?

423
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:08,065
No. Scouts, man.
Look at 'em.

424
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:11,727
Don't worry about scouts, Adam.
Just play your best.

425
00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:14,772
Team U.S.A. loses the puck
at center ice.

426
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,774
Here's Bellafonte across the
blue line with a great move.

427
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:21,277
Walks right down in front.
He shoots, he scores.!

428
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:24,473
Way to go, man!
Way to go!

429
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:35,617
Nearing the end of the game, Team
U.S.A. with it out at center ice.

430
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:39,058
Here's Connie Moreau. Moreau
stick-handling in the Trinidad zone.

431
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:42,619
Moreau still with it, moves around
a pileup, gives it to Kenny Wu.

432
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,632
Wu, the former figure skater, back behind
the net, ducks underneath the check.

433
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,430
Moves around the it.
It's a wraparound. He scores.!

434
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,738
All right, way to go.!

435
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:55,866
- That wasn't a game,
that was a statement!

436
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:01,769
Ladies and gentlemen,
Team U.S.A. hockey.

437
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:05,409
And the man chosen to lead
them to the gold, Gordon Bombay.

438
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:08,579
- Bring the bear up here. This
is Henry, the Hendrix bear.

439
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:12,954
- Hello, everyone.!
- Guys, I want you to come in, get some shots with the bear.

440
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:15,550
Big wave.! Big wave.!
Wave to everybody.!

441
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:19,461
- Hello, everybody! it's great to be here!
- Got that? Great.

442
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:23,330
Thanks a lot. Okay, we're gonna
open it up to questions. Yes.

443
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:25,995
Team U.S.A., how does
it feel competing...

444
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,561
on the international level
here in Los Angeles?

445
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:31,073
- Um-
- Feels good. Love it.

446
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:34,702
Coach Bombay, the Vikings from
iceland are the heavy favorite.

447
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:37,609
Their coach has already
guaranteed victory.

448
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:42,618
- How are you gonna handle them?
- Um... hard work.

449
00:30:42,686 --> 00:30:46,416
i think our team is ready to go
up against the best in the world.

450
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:49,787
We're not worried about 'em.
Iceland may be tough, but, uh...

451
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,418
we're Team U.S.A. and
we're goin' all the way.

452
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:55,655
- Yeah.! All right, Coach.!
- Okay, that's it.

453
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,665
Thank you very much.
Thank you, everybody.

454
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:02,260
- Real good. Did good.
- Team U.S.A. 's going down.

455
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:05,430
That's where
you're going.

456
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:09,236
See you on the ice, Bombay!

457
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:12,808
That's, uh, Stansson.

458
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:15,142
Coach of the Iceland team.
He's wound a little tight.

459
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:18,479
Stansson from the N.H.L.? Wolf"The
Dentist" Stansson is coaching?

460
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:22,180
- You didn't tell me that.
- it's all right!

461
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:24,484
- That guy's a dentist?
- That was his nickname.

462
00:31:24,557 --> 00:31:27,286
Played one year of pro,
collected more teeth than goals.

463
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,658
- He even punched out his coach.
- They ran him out of the league and the country.

464
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:34,460
What happened to freedom of
speech, huh? isn't this America?

465
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:37,261
That's his team?
Those guys are huge!

466
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:39,996
- One more thing- - He's
already told you what he thinks.

467
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,004
- Gordon.
- Thanks. How'd i do?

468
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:46,008
- Great. it was quite a circus, huh?
- it's all part of the game.

469
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:49,875
A giant polar bear with sunglasses
is part of hockey now?

470
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:51,880
i guess the game's
really changed.

471
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:55,076
Gordon, come on.
CNN, one on one.

472
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:57,085
CNN.

473
00:31:57,153 --> 00:32:00,087
Gordon.! Just one question.!
One question.!

474
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:03,921
- Hello, there, missy.
How about a bear hug?

475
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:07,257
Tibbles, what are we
doin' here in Malibu?

476
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,888
This is your new place, man.
it's our way of saying "Thank you. "

477
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:12,933
You take care of Hendrix,
Hendrix is gonna take care of you.

478
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,936
i can't help feeling a little guilty.
Shouldn't i be closer to the team?

479
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,272
Whoa.

480
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:35,181
You know, they don't
need me 24 hours a day.

481
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:38,621
- i'm sure they're just fine in the dorms.
- Yeah.

482
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:54,266
Shh. Do it quiet.

483
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:57,135
All right.
Let me get the hand.

484
00:32:57,207 --> 00:33:00,142
- Hurry.
- i'm hurrying! Shh!

485
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,700
Go ahead.

486
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:09,042
Okay, that's good.
Feather.

487
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:14,121
Shh.

488
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:45,482
Ah.

489
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,075
A little tune-age
to go to sleep by?

490
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,747
- Yeah.
- All right.

491
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:52,790
- ~ Ain't seen nothin' yet ~
- All right.

492
00:33:52,858 --> 00:33:56,953
~ B-B-Baby, you just
ain't seen nothin' yet ~

493
00:33:57,027 --> 00:34:00,087
~ Here's somethin' Here's somethin'
that you just won't forget ~

Your triumph?

520
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:48,886
Lighten up a little bit.
We're all just here to have-

521
00:35:48,962 --> 00:35:50,953
A little fun, right?

522
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,430
Don't you worry.

523
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:56,957
We will. We will.

524
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:08,274
It's been all Team U.S.A. tonight.

525
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:11,577
They lead Italy six to nothing.
They've really dominated this game.

526
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:13,913
Italy with the puck
across the line.

527
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:16,647
D'Agistino shoots.
Glove save by Goldberg.

528
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,121
Have no fear!
Goldberg is here!

529
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,987
Hey, man, there was nothing
on that. How about a real shot?

530
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:24,424
Hey, paisan, meatballs
are slowing you down?

531
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:27,759
Uh, how do you say,
in italiano, "wussy"?

532
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:30,561
Break it up! Break it up!

533
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:33,796

534
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:36,463

00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:25,611

552
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:48,035

Thank you. We're done.
See what i mean?

555
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:56,303
Everybody wants to be
something bigger.

556
00:37:56,377 --> 00:38:00,643
Listen, all i'm saying
is you could be big. i mean Costas big.

557
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:03,377
N.H.L. stars Neely,
Chelios and Robitaille.

558
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:07,546

00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,255

00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:15,726
Kareem, i'd like you to meet
Gordon Bombay, coach ofTeam U.S.A.

562
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:18,024
- Hey, Gordon, how ya doin'?
- Glad to meet ya.

563
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:21,396
Coaching. Okay,
two words about that: Pat Riley.

564
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,526
What it is, it's a loafer.

565
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,230
And we'll call it
the Air Bombay loafer...

566
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,534
for kids who wanna coach.

567
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,439
You think there's enough kids
out there who wanna... coach?

568
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,443
Absolutely.

569
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,841
This don't look like
no Rodeo Drive to me.

570
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,848
No, that's Ro-day-o Drive.

571
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:43,079
You can't fool me. i saw it on
the sign. it says Rodeo Drive.

572
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,781
No, see, there's
an accent at- Never mind.

573
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,449
i don't get it. This is Beverly
Hills. Where's all the hills?

574
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:52,460
- Where's that 90210 school? What about the Hillbillies?
- Where are the movie stars?

575
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,519
Wasn't that the captain
from The Love Boat?

576
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:57,532
- Let's go check out some stores.
- Great. i gotta buy my mom a T-shirt.

577
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,897
- She'll love it.
- Yeah.

578
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:02,960
Let's think about it
and go get an espresso, okay?

579
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:06,572
Maybe they're not open.

580
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:09,734
Hey, there's a doorbell here.

581
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,246
i'm sorry. We do not allow
unsupervised children into the store.

582
00:39:13,313 --> 00:39:18,250
- Can you make an exception?
- No, now go away or the police will be called.

583
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:20,751
if we were in Texas,
this wouldn't have happened.

584
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,311
- We'll find some other place.
Step back from the vehicle.

585
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:26,654
- You have activated
the theft-deterrent device.

586
00:39:26,726 --> 00:39:30,821
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, we'd like four burgers. What do you want to drink?

587
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:34,332
You kids get outta here!
Quit playin' with that thing!

588
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:38,096
- I'm sorry.
We do not allow unsupervised-

589
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,503
i'm sure Uncle Aaron will be very upset to
hear we were treated with such disrespect.

590
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,507
Aaron? Aaron Spelling?

591
00:39:44,575 --> 00:39:47,772
No, Hank Aaron.
Of course, Aaron Spelling.

592
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,972
Now, i want you to make yourselves
comfortable. Carole, beverages.

593
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:53,572
And i will be with you
in a moment.

594
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,820
- Gosh, this store sure is nice.
- Goldberg, my man.

595
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,153
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

596
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:07,991
i know you boys.
You're, um-

597
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:10,327
- Aaron Spelling's nephew.
- No.

598
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:14,334
- Team U.S.A. hockey.
- You guys are just great!

599
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:17,269
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks.

600
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:19,329
Now, a gift for your mother.

601
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:23,638
You'll want something light, airy.
it is summer, after all.

602
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,270
i'm going to show you

00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:33,984

00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,523

608
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:44,789

612
00:40:51,102 --> 00:40:53,036

613
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:56,129
~How about givin'me

614
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,141

00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:04,172
~Here it is

616
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:06,215

619
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,689
~Do you want it
Do you know how-~~

620
00:41:16,758 --> 00:41:18,988
Well, gentlemen, did you
see anything you liked?

621
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,552
You know, i gotta be honest.
My mom really needs...

622
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:24,496
a bikini.

623
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,733
- Hey!
- You little brats don't ever come back into this store.!

624
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,828
Anti-children!

625
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,841
No, no, no. it's not a sneaker,
it's a street shoe.

626
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,502
Like coaches wear.

627
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,511
Yeah, come on in.

628
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:41,877
Sure, with a pump.
That'll work.

629
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:45,850
Go ahead, sit down.
We'll talk about it at dinner. Okay.

630
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:48,113
What's up?

631
00:41:48,187 --> 00:41:52,089
i wanna play.
When am i gonna get my chance?

632
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:54,125
Julie, Goldberg's
on a hot streak.

633
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:56,354
i gotta stick with him
as long as we're winning.

634
00:41:56,428 --> 00:41:59,396
i understand. But i left
my team in Maine...

635
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:01,693
to show
the world what i can do.

636
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:03,700
Just give it time.

637
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:06,760
You will show the world.
i promise.

638
00:42:06,837 --> 00:42:08,861
Okay?

639
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:11,533
All right.
Now get outta here.

640
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:17,037
~ Bom, bom ~

641
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:20,138
Look at them. Fulton.
Fulton, talk to 'em.

642
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:23,151
Uh, hey, ladies. Nice night
for a stroll, wouldn't you say?

643
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:25,312
That was a good one!

644
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:27,321
No curfew's
gonna keep us down.

645
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:29,481
- Yeah!
- ice cream.

646
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:32,651
Wait a minute. I thought
Iceland was covered with ice.

647
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:35,787
- No, it's very green.
- i thought Greenland was green.

648
00:42:35,863 --> 00:42:40,128
- Greenland is covered with ice, and iceland is very nice.
- Ahh.

649
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,931
i imagine it'd be
like Minnesota, where you're from.

650
00:42:44,004 --> 00:42:46,802
How do you know
where i'm from?

651
00:42:46,873 --> 00:42:49,068
i asked around.

652
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:52,042
Okay.

653
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:56,507
Look at this.
She's an iceland chick.

654
00:42:56,582 --> 00:42:59,847
What's he doin'with her?
Great coach we got.

655
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:08,625
All right, are we ready
for warm-ups?

656
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:12,184
- Let's go!
- Whoa! He's stylin'! Mr. Coach!

657
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:14,197
Yeah, all right.
All right.

658
00:43:14,265 --> 00:43:18,634
- Nice jacket. Did you get
- two pairs of pants with that?

659
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:21,864
- Good night last night, Coach?
- Yeah, it was fine.

660
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:23,872
What'd ya do?

661
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,034
Oh, i... just watched some TV,
got to bed early.

662
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,374
But not without
a little dessert, right?

663
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:32,809
A little
ice cream, maybe?

664
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:35,782
Nice haircut.
What, ya lose a bet?

665
00:43:38,553 --> 00:43:42,545
Live from Los Angeles, welcome
to theJunior Goodwill Games.

666
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:45,786
Tonight's matchup, Team U.S.A.
faces off against Team iceland.

667
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,387
- Cakewalk.
- We have with us Greg Goldberg, goaltender for Team U.S.A.

668
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:53,057
Greg, what is it gonna take to beat
these feisty icelanders tonight?

669
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:56,899
i think it'll take a supreme
individual effort by me, Greg Goldberg.

670
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,565
- Let's play hockey, gentlemen.
- Okay, cut it.

671
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,131
Hi, everybody.
Welcome to today's game.

672
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:07,406
This is a very important matchup,
Team U.S.A. against Iceland...

673
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:10,505
in what could be a preview
of the championship game.

674
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:12,573
Iceland, coached by
Wolf"The Dentist'"Stansson.

675
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:15,278
He'll be taking on
Gordon Bombay.

676
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,022
Good luck, there,
Coach.

677
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,752
You'll sure need it.

678
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:30,431
What does that mean?

679
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,263
You'll find out.

680
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:37,603
Come on, fool! Get up!

681
00:44:37,673 --> 00:44:40,267
- You ran at him unprovoked.
- Huh?

682
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:44,109
- Calm down, son. You're out of the game.
- Give me a break!

683
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,673
You're throwin' him out? You can't do
that! it's three seconds into the game!

684
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:52,986
Oh, man.

685
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:03,452
Come and get it.

686
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:12,797
Wake up, defense.
Can't do this all myself.

687
00:45:12,872 --> 00:45:17,934
Hey, Goldberg! if that puck was a
cheeseburger, you'd stop it! Ha-ha-ha!

688
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:31,485
Yee-haw!

689
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:34,615
- Pass the puck, Dwayne! Come on!
- Dwayne, give me the puck.!

690
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:36,887
- Pass it to Fulton!
- Dwayne, pass it!

691
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:41,689
- Look out, Dwayne!
- Yee-haw! Aah!

692
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,501
Oh, man!

693
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:49,298
i can't believe this is
happening! i should be out there!

694
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,306
...missing big Dean Portman,
it's one-nothing iceland.

695
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,810
iceland outhitting and
outskating Team U.S.A...

696
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,438
all over the ice
in the first period.

697
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:00,447
Here's Gunnar Stahl
again for Iceland.

698
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:04,747
Team U.S.A. can't stop him.
On the backhand, saved by Goldberg.

699
00:46:04,852 --> 00:46:09,982
Captain Adam Banks has it for Team
U.S.A. He gets knocked head over heels.

700
00:46:10,056 --> 00:46:15,084
Team U.S.A. still with the puck.
Luis Mendoza, he can really fly.

701
00:46:15,162 --> 00:46:19,030
Mendoza across the blue line. He
gets tripped, slides into the boards.

702
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:21,191
Come on, ref,
call something.

703
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:25,533
- We're in trouble, Ken. What can you do for us?
- Let's see.

704
00:46:25,604 --> 00:46:28,698
Uh, a triple aerial
with a Double Hamill Camel...

705
00:46:28,774 --> 00:46:32,709
that should split the D, then a
pirouetting half-toe-touch for the goal.

706
00:46:32,777 --> 00:46:36,873
- Show it to me, son.
- Come on, Kenny. Get us back in the game.

707
00:46:36,948 --> 00:46:39,508
i'm sure
you can do it, Ken.

708
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,054
Aah!

709
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:52,018
Aw, man. Aw.

710
00:46:52,094 --> 00:46:54,028
Aw.

711
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,134
Was that it?

712
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:04,227
Please give me one more
chance to get those guys!

713
00:47:04,306 --> 00:47:08,868
They've got to get back into
this game. Iceland with the puck.

714
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:11,310
Here's Olaf Sanderson
right down the middle.

715
00:47:11,379 --> 00:47:15,075
- Sanderson over to Stahl.
He scores.!

716
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:19,644
Where's our concentration?

717
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,382
You guys are runnin' around like a bunch
of chickens with your heads cut off!.

718
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:27,358
- We're doin' our best.
- Well, your best isn't good enough anymore.

719
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,760
Blow this game and we are one
loss away from elimination.

720
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:34,925
You guys might want to go home
early, but i sure as heck don't.

721
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:40,663
My, that was inspiring.

722
00:47:40,772 --> 00:47:44,037
Four-nothing, Iceland, as we
head for the final period.

723
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:49,136
I hope Bombay's got some magic up his sleeve,
because he's getting manhandled tonight.

724
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:04,049
No! No.

725
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:09,286
You're off, Goldberg!

726
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:13,065
Ah, thank you.

727
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:17,264
- Hey, good luck, goalie. You're gonna need it.
- Thanks, Goldberg.

728
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,306
- Sending in a woman to do a man's job.
- Don't break a nail.

729
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:29,379
i'm sorry, boys, but can you
help me with my pads, please?

730
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:33,044
Yeah. Oof!.

731
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,248
Intent to injure.!
You're out of the game.!

732
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:40,588
- See ya around, fellas.
Aw, geez.

733
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,720
Thanks for the breather.

734
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:47,253
- Fulton! Get out there and blast one!
- Go on in!

735
00:48:47,332 --> 00:48:50,324
Fulton Reed on the ice
for Team U.S.A.

736
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:53,735
- He's open to the blue line.
- Fulton, fire it in there!

737
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,898
Reed winding up-

738
00:48:57,576 --> 00:48:59,736
Whoa.! Glove save by Seggi.

739
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,678
Oh, what a save.! He'll have an
imprint of a puck in his palm...

740
00:49:03,747 --> 00:49:05,681
after that one.!

741
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:14,290
- Hi.
- i know how you feel.

742
00:49:14,357 --> 00:49:17,918
Here's Banks,
starts onto the ice...

743
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:20,188
moves along the left wing side,
now moves into the center, but-

744
00:49:20,262 --> 00:49:22,696
A spinning move.! A great
move to the blue line.

745
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:26,200
Banks all alone.
He scores.!

746
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:28,202
Yeah, we got one!

747
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,829
Hey!

748
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:35,005
Come on! Relax!
Take it easy!

749
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:37,010
- Calm down, son.
- Are you okay?

750
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:39,205
- i'm all right. i'm okay.
- Are you sure?

751
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,112
He scored!

752
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:48,881
- Sit down. Right in there.
- Sanderson!

753
00:49:48,955 --> 00:49:50,888
In my country,
we call that a love tap.

754
00:49:50,956 --> 00:49:54,016
i want a piece of you,
Sanderson! You're mine!

755
00:49:54,093 --> 00:49:56,186
- Oh, you think it's funny?
- Come on, get down!

756
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:58,388
i want you!

757
00:49:58,464 --> 00:50:01,455
Hey, man, don't touch me.!

758
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,133
C'mon, Charlie!
That's it!

759
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,905
- iceland!
- Olaf.

760
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,040
Ja, Coach.

761
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,812
- Good game, Coach.
- Thanks, ref.

762
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,913
Damn it!

763
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:35,794
Twelve to one, huh?
Twelve to one.

764
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:39,196
Ya think Hendrix is interested
in backing a loser?

765
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:41,428
Hey, how are ya?

766
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:43,493
You're only good to us
if you win.

767
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,869
Don, i'm- i've-

768
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,376
i- i've been good to you, man.
i gave ya a real shot.

769
00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:52,378
A real shot
to be somebody...

770
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:54,436
and this is
how you repay me.

771
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:57,779
We just didn't have
the magic tonight.

772
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,342
Well, you better get the damn
magic, and you better get it fast.

773
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:05,117
Or i'm out of a job, and you're on your
way back to Palookaville, Minnesota...

774
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,284
shoveling snow
and sharpening skates.

775
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,419
Have a nice night.

776
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:19,961
Twelve to one.

777
00:51:20,037 --> 00:51:24,667
You know what word comes to
mind when you think of that? Hmm?

778
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:27,606
Pathetic.!

779
00:51:28,978 --> 00:51:31,037
You guys were brought
here to play hockey.

780
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:33,911
- What about you?
- What about me,Jesse?

781
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:37,713
Coach Stansson knew everything
about us. They were ready for us.

782
00:51:37,786 --> 00:51:40,983
And you spend your time driving around in
convertibles talking to those sponsor fools.

783
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:45,254
Or hanging with the iceland lady.
We saw you two Saturday night.

784
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:47,590
Eating ice cream with
the enemy, huh, coach?

785
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:50,495
What? What are you talking
about? What's going on?

786
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,530
Hey. Hey, what i do is none of
your business. is that clear?

787
00:51:59,873 --> 00:52:01,966
Don't take those pads off.

788
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:05,136
Everyone stay in your gear.
We have practice.

789
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:06,975
Tonight?

790
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:30,032
This isn't
very much fun, Coach.

791
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,035
Who said it was
supposed to be fun?

792
00:52:33,103 --> 00:52:35,333
You did, when you
coached the Ducks.

793
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:37,839
Well, i don't see
any Ducks here, Charlie.

794
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:41,934
All i see is Team U.S.A.
one loss away from elimination.

795
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:44,808
Twenty more sprints!
Let's go!

796
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:47,816
Line up! Come on, let's go!

797
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:51,944
Line up, Charlie!

798
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,512
Let's go! Keep you here
all night if i have to.

799
00:53:10,904 --> 00:53:14,032
Not my best...

800
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,200
Luis.

801
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,210
Sorry.

802
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,905
All right, let's go!

803
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:25,575
Team?

804
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:29,914
Hello!

805
00:53:31,256 --> 00:53:33,416
Hey, guys.

806
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:38,053
- Hello?
- I canceled their practice.

807
00:53:38,129 --> 00:53:41,825
- What're ya talkin' about? Where are they?
- They needed a day off. Trust me.

808
00:53:41,898 --> 00:53:43,866
i need 'em here
to practice!

809
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:46,027
Well,
they need to rest.

810
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:48,366
You've been running
those children ragged.

811
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:52,067
They can barely stay awake in class.
They're calling you Captain Blood.

812
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:55,201
i am preparing these kids for
battle. Can you understand that?

813
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:57,245
We win the gold,
we go on to bigger things.

814
00:53:57,313 --> 00:53:59,247
- Bigger things?
- That's right!

815
00:53:59,315 --> 00:54:01,749
Please!
Gordon, it's a game!

816
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:05,308
You said it yourself. Games
should be fun. Remember?

817
00:54:08,089 --> 00:54:11,183
- And hold, two, three- - Coach
isn't here. Why do we have to be?

818
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:14,056
We have a game tonight.
We have to work out.

819
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:18,121
i say mutiny.
Who's with me?

820
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:20,254
Goldberg,
i'm too tired to mutiny.

821
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,128
Come on, guys, it's not like we
couldn't use the conditioning.

822
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,329
- Speak for yourself, babe.
- Her name is Julie, not "babe. "

823
00:54:27,403 --> 00:54:31,635
- Don't tell me how to talk, rich boy!
- Hey, Portman, chill!

824
00:54:31,707 --> 00:54:34,470
Hey, you want a piece of this?

825
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:38,308
Yo, Team U.S.A., what are you gonna
do today, a million jumping jacks?

826
00:54:38,346 --> 00:54:41,782
- This kid's crazier than me. Forget about him. Look, Fulton!
- Hey, chill!

827
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,942
Hey, man,
i'm gettin' sick of you!

828
00:54:44,018 --> 00:54:47,282
i'm gettin' sick of seeing the U.S.A.
represented by a bunch of whining babies.

829
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:49,584
Too bad you can't back up
that mouth.

830
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:52,284
Me and my boys can take you
anytime, anywhere.

831
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:55,089
- i don't see no "boys. "
- i got 'em waitin'.

832
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:57,662
Grab your gear and let's go play
some schoolyard puck.

833
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:01,291
- Or maybe you forgot what it's like to play for real pride.
- You got a pass?

834
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:04,200
- Come on, it's not too far, you little wimps.
- Come on.

835
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,568
- What are you doin'? Get off!. You comin' or not?
- Let's go.

836
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:13,502
My little brother Russ here has been telling
me that you have been chokin' big time.

837
00:55:13,578 --> 00:55:16,603
Your brother's
got a big mouth.

838
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:19,008
Uh-oh.

839
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:24,816
He does, doesn't he?

840
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:28,118
- Oh, boy.
- We thought we'd call you all to see what you got.

841
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:31,160
We know you can talk to the
press and sign autographs.

842
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:35,527
- We can do more than that.
- Yeah? We can teach you to play like the real Team U.S.A.

843
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,361
What would you know
about it?

844
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:40,367
~Party people ~

845
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:43,666
You gotta earn every inch.

846
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:47,004
~ Tag team back again Check
it's a record and let's begin ~

847
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:49,304
~Party on party people
Let me hear some noise ~

848
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:52,038
- ~D.C. 's in the house
Jump,jump forjoy ~

849
00:55:52,113 --> 00:55:55,844
~Party over here, party over there, wave
your hands in the air, shake your derriere ~

850
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:59,646
~ These three words while you're
gettin'busy Whoomp, there it is, hit me ~

851
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:01,710
Come on!
Get him!

852
00:56:01,788 --> 00:56:07,488
~ Whoomp, there it is Whoomp,
there it is Whoomp, there it is ~

853
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,019
~ Whoomp, there it is
Whoomp, there it is ~

854
00:56:12,097 --> 00:56:16,557
Hey, ain't no whistles out here either.
You keep diggin' until you score that goal!

855
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:19,570
Pick it up!

856
00:56:19,638 --> 00:56:22,162
- He scores!
- All right, Russ!

857
00:56:24,742 --> 00:56:27,905
And then you take a few breaths,
slug some water...

858
00:56:27,979 --> 00:56:31,004
- and get out there
and do it again!

859
00:56:31,114 --> 00:56:33,582
- ~Let me hear you say ~
- ~ Whoomp, there it is ~

860
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:36,551
Don't just stand there.
Come and get it.

861
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,884
Don't mind if i do.

862
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:42,048
- Yeah, Luis!
- ~ Whoomp, there it is ~

863
00:56:42,124 --> 00:56:44,592
~ Whoomp, there it is
Whoomp, there it is ~

864
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,255
Whoa! Not again!

865
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:51,857
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Use the brakes, baby.

866
00:57:02,142 --> 00:57:05,737
- Eh, no sweat. it happens all the time.
- Excuse me.

867
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:10,477
- Throw it back, please.
- Here, kid. Alley-oop.

868
00:57:11,785 --> 00:57:14,617
All right, get it.!

869
00:57:15,788 --> 00:57:17,585
Yeah!

870
00:57:17,657 --> 00:57:21,252
- Yeah, Charlie!
- Yeah.!

871
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:24,454
- ~ Whoomp, there it is ~
- Come on, let's go.!

872
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:27,293
~ Whoomp, there it is ~

873
00:57:31,837 --> 00:57:34,896
Yeah! All right!

874
00:57:34,972 --> 00:57:36,940
Did you see that?

875
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:39,669
What the heck
kinda shot was that?

876
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:42,269
- Ah, you like that, huh?
- Yeah.

877
00:57:42,346 --> 00:57:46,475
That's my knucklepuck. it's hard to be
accurate but it drives goalies crazy.

878
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:48,608
Let's play!

879
00:57:48,685 --> 00:57:51,620
Come on, Danny, come to me.!

880
00:57:51,688 --> 00:57:53,588
Yeah.!

881
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,117
Yeah!
Way to go!

882
00:57:57,192 --> 00:58:00,787
Sweet move, kid.

883
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:04,094
- All right!
- Aw,you done messed up now.! Come here, I'm gonna get you.!

884
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:07,032
Come here. Come here! Come
here,junior! Come here! No.

885
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:09,160
i'm just messin'
with you, okay. Listen.

886
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:12,297
When a guy comes at you
like i just did, you do this:

887
00:58:12,373 --> 00:58:16,331
Stick, gloves...
and shirt.

888
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,103
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

889
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,772
My turn.

890
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:25,443
Stick, gloves,
shirt.

891
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:28,282
- All right?
- All right.

892
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,826
- All right, you guys,
go get 'em!

893
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:41,161
- All right!
- Come on, go get 'em.! You guys do it, okay?

894
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:43,427
- All right.!
- Play hard!

895
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,938
Go, U.S.A.
Go get 'em.

896
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:14,657
This is not a place
for a coach.

897
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:20,358
So who's looking
after the shop?

898
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:22,698
We are closed.

899
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:25,000
First time in ten years.

900
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:29,269
i saw the iceland game
on television.

901
00:59:29,342 --> 00:59:33,904
- Who was that man in the suit with the wet hair? Was it raining?
- it's a style,Jan.

902
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,575
You looked like
you just got out of the shower.

903
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:42,086
You came 2,000 miles to make fun of me?
You could have done this over the phone.

904
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:45,021
On TV, you looked like
a man who needs a friend.

905
00:59:46,758 --> 00:59:49,420
You don't understand.

906
00:59:51,095 --> 00:59:53,427
Gordon...

907
00:59:53,498 --> 00:59:57,730
when i told the Goodwill Committee
who you were...

908
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,702
i did not talk
to them about your good looks.

909
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,705
I didn't tell them
you would win at any cost.

910
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:09,568
i told them you were a man
who loves the game.

911
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:13,274
And i told them you were a man
who could teach the kids...

912
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:16,375
about more than just
winning or losing.

913
01:00:16,452 --> 01:00:20,616
I told them you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.

914
01:00:20,689 --> 01:00:24,556
And only you
could teach them to fly.

915
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:26,719
So be that man.

916
01:00:28,496 --> 01:00:30,896
Be that man, Gordon.

917
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,647
Hey, team.! Hey, team.
We're gonna be great today, right?

918
01:01:26,715 --> 01:01:29,115
- Where's Gordon?
- You tell us.

919
01:01:29,184 --> 01:01:32,642
- i don't believe this.
- Team U.S.A. i'm sorry.

920
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,121
Without a coach behind the bench,
you'll forfeit the game.

921
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,488
- But you can't do that.
- We have one.

922
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,119
Miss MacKay.!

923
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:45,131
Hey, Charlie,
what's up?

924
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:47,632
You have to pretend you're a coach
or we forfeit the game.

925
01:01:47,701 --> 01:01:51,137
- Where's Coach Bombay?
- Pretend or we're out of the tournament.

926
01:01:51,237 --> 01:01:55,037
But i don't know anything
about coaching.

927
01:01:58,043 --> 01:02:01,945
Here she is, our coach; Coach MacKay.

928
01:02:03,248 --> 01:02:05,842
Yeah.

929
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:10,047
- Come on, Coach MacKay.
- What are you waitin' for, ice to freeze? Let's play!

930
01:02:10,121 --> 01:02:13,056
Let's go.

931
01:02:13,124 --> 01:02:14,853
Yes!

932
01:02:14,926 --> 01:02:17,156
Face-off at center ice.
Germany wins the draw.

933
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:20,286
Comes across the U.S.A. blue line.
Germany on the right wing side.

934
01:02:20,397 --> 01:02:22,695
Down to big Klaus Stabias.
He shoots.!

935
01:02:22,766 --> 01:02:25,496
And a save by Goldberg.
Great save by Goldberg.

936
01:02:25,602 --> 01:02:29,367
As Germany is really
throwing their weight around.

937
01:02:29,438 --> 01:02:34,171
Oh! We look tired.
We need to, uh... trade places.

938
01:02:34,243 --> 01:02:37,212
- What?
- New players.

939
01:02:37,279 --> 01:02:40,042
- Oh, say, "Change it up. "
- Change it up.

940
01:02:40,115 --> 01:02:42,242
- Scream it!
- Change it up!

941
01:02:48,757 --> 01:02:50,587
Cool.

942
01:02:52,493 --> 01:02:56,725
- We're late in the period
with a face off coming up.

943
01:03:01,934 --> 01:03:04,061
Look who finally
shows up.

944
01:03:04,137 --> 01:03:07,038
- Just ignore him. Averman,
take the face-off. - All right.

945
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:34,896
- What do we got to lose?
- Respect. He'll dump us the minute it's all over.

946
01:03:34,964 --> 01:03:38,525
Come on in!
Let's go, come on.

947
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:43,329
Thanks.

948
01:03:50,913 --> 01:03:52,846
Team.

949
01:03:54,649 --> 01:03:56,617
Guys.

950
01:03:56,684 --> 01:03:59,517
I was wrong.

951
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:05,083
And i'm sorry.
i forgot about the team.

952
01:04:05,158 --> 01:04:08,594
And the team is all I have.

953
01:04:08,662 --> 01:04:12,325
All I want...
is another chance.

954
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:14,389
Just one more shot.

955
01:04:15,668 --> 01:04:18,728
i'm back.
Okay?

956
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:23,107
Believe me.

957
01:04:27,512 --> 01:04:29,605
Together now.

958
01:04:36,854 --> 01:04:39,618
Come on,Jesse.

959
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:45,785
- Jesse,just do it, man!
- All right, let's go! Flying "V"!

960
01:04:45,862 --> 01:04:50,959
Hall joined by his teammates behind
the Team U.S.A. net in the third period.

961
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:53,593
They start back out
and they form a "V';

962
01:04:53,703 --> 01:04:59,072
I've heard of this before but I've never
seen it. It's the Flying "V'"led byJesse Hall.

963
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:02,474
Hall up to center ice. Hall with
it toward the Germany blue line.

964
01:05:02,544 --> 01:05:06,570
Hall
- Shot by Averman. He scores.!

965
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:13,820
Yes!

966
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:23,660
i've had a lot of big distractions
since i've been here in L.A.

967
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:26,358
This is a distraction.

968
01:05:26,432 --> 01:05:30,299
- Nice haircut, Coach.
- Looks familiar. i know that guy.

969
01:05:33,105 --> 01:05:35,437
This is a fire in a barrel.

970
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,681
This is a distraction in a
fire in a barrel. Any questions?

971
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,808
Good job, Coach.

972
01:05:47,918 --> 01:05:50,443
All right!
Wooo!

973
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:55,148
All right, Coach.!

974
01:05:58,627 --> 01:06:03,360
We've got a lot of work to do. We've gotta
study our opponents and study ourselves.

975
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:08,668
We have to learn
from our mistakes.

976
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:12,536
You all have special skills.
Now we have to refine them.

977
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:17,203
Luis, your speed is a great weapon.
Now you must learn to harness it.

978
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:20,110
Let's do it.

979
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:27,476
- Whoa!
- We need to get back to basics.

980
01:06:27,554 --> 01:06:31,887
That's it. Dwayne, hustle. We're gonna
be a lean, mean, fighting machine.

981
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:35,086
Move that big butt.
Go!

982
01:06:35,161 --> 01:06:38,221
- Hey, how you feelin' today, Goldberg?
- Lean and mean.

983
01:06:38,297 --> 01:06:42,426
Banks.!
Show me something, now.! That's it.!

984
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,434
Good. Good.

985
01:06:47,072 --> 01:06:49,165
Hey, Banks,
let's go!

986
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:51,572
Comin'.
i'll be right there.

987
01:06:51,642 --> 01:06:56,375
And no matter what, we'll work
together to overcome every obstacle.

988
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:15,059
- Nowjust think how you'd play with two good wrists.
- Coach.

989
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:20,331
it's just a little sore.
i'm okay.

990
01:07:20,402 --> 01:07:25,634
i should have spotted this sooner.
Sorry, man, i wasn't doin' my job.

991
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:28,106
Coach, i'm fine.
i can play, i swear.

992
01:07:28,175 --> 01:07:30,507
Okay.

993
01:07:32,113 --> 01:07:34,945
Here.
Let's find out.

994
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,548
The other hand.

995
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:45,456
Now rotate it.

996
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:53,789
i have to bench you.

997
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:55,992
No!
You can't do that.

998
01:07:56,067 --> 01:07:58,865
- Adam, you could injure yourself permanently.
- You can't bench me.

999
01:07:58,937 --> 01:08:02,634
i gotta play. All the scouts are
here watching me. This is my shot.

1000
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:05,903
You're young and you're gonna
have plenty of shots, believe me.

1001
01:08:05,976 --> 01:08:08,877
But my dad's
counting on me.

1002
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:12,213
I'm sorry.

1003
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,653
Hey.

1004
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:22,816
My dad worked a lot
when i was a kid.

1005
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:25,383
So when he made it
to a game...

1006
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:28,827
i wanted so bad
to score 100 goals for him.

1007
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:33,163
i spent half the game a nervous
wreck, my stomach in knots.

1008
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,964
That's how i feel.

1009
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:40,836
Before he died,
my dad told me...

1010
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,376
that his happiest times...

1011
01:08:43,444 --> 01:08:47,106
were watching me skate on this
pond we had behind our house.

1012
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,547
He didn't need me
to score 100 goals for him.

1013
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:53,847
He was proud of me
'cause i was his son...

1014
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,150
and i did my best.

1015
01:08:57,489 --> 01:09:00,356
I'm sure that's how
your dad feels.

1016
01:09:02,627 --> 01:09:04,822
i know it is.

1017
01:09:09,033 --> 01:09:11,524
Thanks, Coach.

1018
01:09:11,602 --> 01:09:14,628
All right. Let's go
get that wrist X-rayed.

1019
01:09:14,705 --> 01:09:16,730
Come on.

1020
01:09:16,807 --> 01:09:20,469
- That's the way.
- We will work hard and we're gonna succeed.

1021
01:09:23,613 --> 01:09:26,673
Nothing will bring us down.

1022
01:09:28,118 --> 01:09:30,984
If we fall,
we'll get up and try it again.

1023
01:09:31,053 --> 01:09:33,248
Way to get over
on your edge there, Connie!

1024
01:09:33,322 --> 01:09:35,847
Good, Portman, good.
Soft hands.

1025
01:09:41,963 --> 01:09:45,922
Coach. Coach, i know with Banks
out, we got a roster slot open.

1026
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,561
- Yeah?
- You know how I always told you I'd make a better coach than a player?

1027
01:09:49,637 --> 01:09:54,573
I did some scouting
for us. Come on in.!

1028
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:57,201
- Russ Tyler. Coach Bombay.
- Hiya, Coach.

1029
01:09:58,578 --> 01:10:01,774
Russ Tyler, huh.

1030
01:10:01,847 --> 01:10:04,611
Well, Russ,
what can you do for the team?

1031
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:07,243
You never heard
of my knucklepuck?

1032
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:10,379
Knucklepuck?
No.

1033
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:15,650
- U.S.A. leading Russia two-to-one
here in the third period. - Over here.

1034
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:20,187
Russ Tyler, Team U.S.A. 's newest member from
Los Angeles calling for the puck. He gets it.

1035
01:10:20,265 --> 01:10:23,131
- it's knucklepuck time.
- He winds up.

1036
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,031
He shoots.
He scores.!

1037
01:10:25,102 --> 01:10:29,539
Yeah!

1038
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:34,033
- Yeah!
That's my stuff!.

1039
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:38,843
I told him no visitors, but he
wanted to congratulate you anyway.

1040
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:41,679
That's Wayne Gretzky.

1041
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:44,514
Can i shake your hand?

1042
01:10:44,586 --> 01:10:46,213
How ya doin'?

1043
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:48,518
- This is The Great One.
- Wayne's fine.

1044
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:52,856
- Say, hockey.
- Hockey!

1045
01:10:53,394 --> 01:10:55,521
Powered by a one goal victory
over Russia...

1046
01:10:55,596 --> 01:10:59,532
Team U.S.A. hockey advances to the
finals of theJunior Goodwill Games...

1047
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,400
where they'll go up against the
top-seeded team from Iceland.

1048
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:09,039
- Coach, shouldn't we have our hockey gear on?
- Yeah?

1049
01:11:09,109 --> 01:11:13,705
- Guys, this is our last team practice,
which means- - The return of Captain Blood.

1050
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:16,339
No.

1051
01:11:16,415 --> 01:11:20,010
- it means... let's have some fun.
- All right!

1052
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,318
- Easy, easy now.
- Whoa.

1053
01:11:28,392 --> 01:11:30,519
- Good.
- i love it.

1054
01:11:30,595 --> 01:11:32,529
i can skate.

1055
01:11:32,597 --> 01:11:34,861
Yes, he can skate.

1056
01:11:36,766 --> 01:11:39,564
Oh.

1057
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:14,266
Playtime is over.
We have the ice now.

1058
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:17,200
You and your little rink rats
must leave.

1059
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:20,534
We're right here,
Coach.

1060
01:12:22,141 --> 01:12:24,735
The only thing little
was your career in the pros.

1061
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:28,943
Gordon, no,
let's go.

1062
01:12:29,014 --> 01:12:33,246
Well, at least I had a shot.
I was there.

1063
01:12:33,318 --> 01:12:36,515
You were a disgrace.

1064
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:44,225
All right, team,
we're outta here.

1065
01:12:44,295 --> 01:12:47,423
- Let's go, i said! Come on!
- Can you still move on the ice?

1066
01:12:47,498 --> 01:12:49,829
Well, please,
play a little with me.

1067
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:55,494
Show me the famous triple deke
your daddy taught you.

1068
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:59,632
Or was it that
old geezer over there?

1069
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,642
Marria.

1070
01:13:11,419 --> 01:13:15,753
Three bar. First one to hit
both posts and the crossbar.

1071
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:19,156
- Have to take it out past the blue line.
- i know the game.

1072
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:54,157
Come on, Bombay.
Come on!

1073
01:13:54,224 --> 01:13:57,284
That's it. That's it.!
Yeah.!

1074
01:14:09,372 --> 01:14:12,432
News flash.

1075
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:15,270
That wasn't even
my triple deke.

1076
01:14:21,616 --> 01:14:25,711
One more post and you go home crying. By
the way, Stansson, you owe me a beach ball.

1077
01:14:43,436 --> 01:14:46,666
It's all right.

1078
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:56,542
Get your coach off the ice.
We have to practice now.

1079
01:14:56,614 --> 01:14:59,174
Stay back!
Back, back, back.

1080
01:15:11,294 --> 01:15:14,923
Live from the Arrowhead Pond
in Anaheim, California...

1081
01:15:14,998 --> 01:15:20,560
it's Team U.S.A. versus Iceland in the
hockey finals of theJunior Goodwill Games.

1082
01:15:20,636 --> 01:15:23,799
Hi, everybody. This is Bob
Miller along with Jacques Berman.

1083
01:15:23,872 --> 01:15:27,637
Nice to have you with us for what
should be an exciting title game tonight.

1084
01:15:27,709 --> 01:15:29,870
Coach.

1085
01:15:32,013 --> 01:15:35,915
i woke up...
and the pain was gone.

1086
01:15:41,288 --> 01:15:44,189
Adam, i'm sorry,
we already have a full roster.

1087
01:15:47,727 --> 01:15:49,786
He can have my spot.

1088
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,127
it's what i can do
for the team.

1089
01:15:58,203 --> 01:16:00,364
Let me do it.

1090
01:16:02,507 --> 01:16:06,807
Charlie, i need you on the bench,
+coaching right there with me.

1091
01:16:09,213 --> 01:16:12,444
Take a deep breath.
Here we go.

1092
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:32,963
Now the two teams gather
at their respective benches.

1093
01:16:33,034 --> 01:16:37,334
In their last meeting,
Iceland crushed Team U.S.A., 12-one.

1094
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:40,670
Heads high.! Stand tall.! Fly straight.!

1095
01:16:40,741 --> 01:16:44,268
- U.S.A.!
- All the way!

1096
01:16:44,345 --> 01:16:46,108
Wooo!
Wooo!

1097
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:55,082
We're ready for the opening face-off
in tonight's championship game.

1098
01:16:55,188 --> 01:16:57,122
Team U.S.A.
against Iceland.

1099
01:16:57,223 --> 01:17:00,488
Lester Averman will move in
to take the draw for Team U.S.A.

1100
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,823
And off the face-off,
Averman gets knocked down.

1101
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:06,353
Iceland physically dominated
the first game between two teams...

1102
01:17:06,432 --> 01:17:08,525
and they'll try
to do it again tonight.

1103
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,364
Guy Germaine gets checked down
in the corner.

1104
01:17:11,437 --> 01:17:16,499
Behind the net, Goldberg cuts it off
for U.S.A. Here comes Dean Portman.

1105
01:17:16,574 --> 01:17:19,338
He's hit hard into the glass
by Gunnar Stahl.

1106
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,970
Iceland out to dominate
this game early.

1107
01:17:22,046 --> 01:17:25,139
Puck is still in the U.S.A. zone.
There's a shot from the blue line.

1108
01:17:25,215 --> 01:17:28,378
Stick save by Goldberg.
Good save.

1109
01:17:28,452 --> 01:17:32,013
Held in by Iceland. Goldberg
looks like he got tripped.

1110
01:17:32,088 --> 01:17:35,386
Iceland still with it. Back behind the
net. Here's a wraparound by Sanderson.

1111
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:39,394
- He scores.! Iceland gets
an early one-to-nothing lead.

1112
01:17:39,462 --> 01:17:41,657
it's all right.
We'll get that one back.

1113
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:44,857
Hey!
Too slow, big boy.

1114
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:48,835
- All right! That's it!
- Don't listen to him.

1115
01:17:48,903 --> 01:17:53,033
- That guy'll kill you.
- Well, at least hold me back like i'm gonna kill him.

1116
01:17:53,107 --> 01:17:56,234
Come on, man! Let me at him! Let me go!

1117
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,369
You want some of this?
Let me at him!

1118
01:17:58,445 --> 01:18:00,538
Line change!

1119
01:18:00,614 --> 01:18:03,845
Guy,Jesse, Russ.

1120
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:06,680
- You ready? Get out there.
- Yeah.

1121
01:18:11,457 --> 01:18:13,425
That's the shooter!
Watch him! Get him!

1122
01:18:18,597 --> 01:18:21,589
- There he is.
- There you go. That's my boy!

1123
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:23,691
Cross sticks.

1124
01:18:29,607 --> 01:18:32,440
What are you doin'?
Get off me.

1125
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:36,104
Boo!

1126
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:41,576
- Over here, man. Gimme the puck.
- Shooter!

1127
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:44,711
Watch out, boy.
it's knucklepuck time.

1128
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:49,890
Aw, man,
i messed up.

1129
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:53,894
Iceland with a one-nothing lead.
Throwing everything they have at U.S.A.

1130
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:12,601
Team U.S.A. has to find a way
to get back in this game...

1131
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:16,638
because they are being totally dominated
by a bigger, faster Iceland team.

1132
01:19:16,716 --> 01:19:22,153
We can't make it. iceland's bigger,
stronger, faster. They got more facial hair.

1133
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:35,127
Banks, you're on.

1134
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,225
Hey, be careful
out there.

1135
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:55,813
Sit down. Sit down. Hey, Ref, why don't you
call something? He almost took his arm off!.

1136
01:19:55,885 --> 01:19:59,616
- That'll be two minutes.
- Two minutes well worth it.

1137
01:19:59,722 --> 01:20:02,622
Get in the box,
you big goon.

1138
01:20:11,532 --> 01:20:14,831
- i'm okay.
- You sure?

1139
01:20:14,902 --> 01:20:18,998
Yeah. i'm fine. They
just hit the pad. Really.

1140
01:20:19,073 --> 01:20:21,199
You'll be okay,
Banks.

1141
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:24,107
Way to hang in there, Adam.
Great playing.

1142
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:36,077
Now the crowd doing the wave, trying
to get Team U.S.A. back in this game.

1143
01:20:36,154 --> 01:20:40,648
It may be working.
Team U.S.A. up to center ice.

1144
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:44,354
Moreau to the blue line of Iceland. Drops
it back to Mendoza. Ducks under a check.

1145
01:20:44,428 --> 01:20:49,229
Robertson with it now for Team U.S.A.
He's got great moves with the puck.

1146
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,326
Robertson still with it. Portman
calling for it in front of the net.

1147
01:20:52,403 --> 01:20:56,702
Robertson knocked down from
behind. Iceland will take over.

1148
01:20:56,773 --> 01:20:58,900
- Somebody get on him.
- Get him, Luis.!

1149
01:20:58,975 --> 01:21:02,502
Here's Luis Mendoza in a
footrace trying to catch Amselik.

1150
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:05,672
Amselik on a breakaway.
He could make it three-nothing.

1151
01:21:05,748 --> 01:21:08,842
Mendoza trying
frantically to catch him.

1152
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:12,546
Amselik moving in on Goldberg.
Gets hit from behind.

1153
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:15,350
Taking the puck-

1154
01:21:15,423 --> 01:21:19,917
Amselik, Mendoza and the puck
all in the net. It's a goal.

1155
01:21:19,994 --> 01:21:23,020
And Iceland leads now...
three-to-nothing.

1156
01:21:25,499 --> 01:21:28,730
Show me the Flying "V".
Let's go! Let's go!

1157
01:21:28,802 --> 01:21:30,702
Hey!

1158
01:21:50,522 --> 01:21:54,583
And here's a four-on-none
break for Iceland.

1159
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:59,095
- Gunnar Stahl to Sanderson.
Wide open net and he scores.

1160
01:21:59,163 --> 01:22:01,131
Four-nothing,
Iceland.

1161
01:22:07,503 --> 01:22:10,939
And iceland is really taking it
to Team U.S.A.

1162
01:22:11,007 --> 01:22:13,669
They are completely
dominating this game.

1163
01:22:13,743 --> 01:22:18,406
As we start the second period, you wonder
how is Team U.S.A. going to get back in this.

1164
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,540
It's like
David versus Goliath.

1165
01:22:24,186 --> 01:22:26,484
Oy, vey.

1166
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:32,117
- You guys wanna ease up a little bit? Just thought i'd ask.
- Come on, guys.

1167
01:22:32,193 --> 01:22:36,323
Off the face-off,Averman gets
knocked down by Gunnar Stahl.

1168
01:22:36,397 --> 01:22:39,957
And the heavy hitting by Iceland continues.
It's gonna take something drastic...

1169
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:43,696
for Team U.S.A.
to turn this game around.

1170
01:22:46,506 --> 01:22:49,099
Party!

1171
01:22:57,182 --> 01:23:00,309
Yeah!

1172
01:23:00,384 --> 01:23:04,980
Iceland trying to pad their
lead in the second period.

1173
01:23:05,056 --> 01:23:08,048
Number 74 spins around.
He's right in the slot.

1174
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:10,650
He shoots.!
And a save by Goldberg.

1175
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:14,663
Kenny Wu picks it up behind the U.S.A.
net. Wu, the former Olympic skater...

1176
01:23:14,731 --> 01:23:18,690
weaves his way up to center ice,;he's
gonna try and split the Iceland defense.

1177
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:21,134
Get him!

1178
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,378
Pretty cool, huh?

1179
01:23:30,445 --> 01:23:32,845
Fulton back to Wu.
He shoots.

1180
01:23:32,914 --> 01:23:34,973
- He scores.!
- Yeah!

1181
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:39,712
- Yeah! Yeah! Yes!
- Wooo!

1182
01:23:41,255 --> 01:23:43,985
Wu.! Wu.! Wu.!
Kenny Wu...

1183
01:23:44,057 --> 01:23:47,857
puts Team U.S.A. on the board.!

1184
01:23:47,928 --> 01:23:51,364
What'd you think of that?
Pretty sweet, huh?

1185
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:55,833
Hey, you wanna piece of me?
Here, take that.

1186
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:59,861
- All right! Yeah! i taught him that.
- Yeah, i know, man!

1187
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:03,533
- Come on! Let's go.
- Take that! What'd i do?

1188
01:24:03,608 --> 01:24:07,408
All right. All right. Grim up.
We still got a lot of work to do.

1189
01:24:09,114 --> 01:24:11,708
What are you doing out there? Wake up!

1190
01:24:11,783 --> 01:24:15,411
- That'll be two minutes, son.
- Two minutes? Well worth it.

1191
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:23,855
- All right, Ken Wu!
- Our little Bash Brother! He's our man!

1192
01:24:27,764 --> 01:24:30,756
- Yeah! Get up!
- Come on! Get up!

1193
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:34,929
Hey, you guys, come on, get-
Let's play hockey!

1194
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:38,166
- Yes!
- Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

1195
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:45,737
Yes, let's hear it for the three
Bash Brothers entertaining the crowd.

1196
01:24:51,285 --> 01:24:53,913
Yeah!

1197
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:57,616
- Come on!
Let's go, come on.

1198
01:24:57,691 --> 01:25:01,627
Fulton and Portman are gonna
get misconduct penalties here.

1199
01:25:01,695 --> 01:25:05,790
They're ushered into the penalty box where
theyjoin Wu and they're still going wild.

1200
01:25:05,865 --> 01:25:08,425
Now there's
three Bash Brothers.

1201
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,434
- Olaf!.
- Ja.!

1202
01:25:10,502 --> 01:25:12,936
Destroy!

1203
01:25:13,005 --> 01:25:15,939
Connie, be careful out there.
They're gunning for you.

1204
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:18,635
Don't worry.
i'll be fine.

1205
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,821
Iceland on the attack again.
Uberjavik fires the puck in the corner.

1206
01:25:41,898 --> 01:25:44,093
Connie Moreau
over to get it.

1207
01:25:44,166 --> 01:25:47,999
- Sanderson has her lined up.
- Get out of there.!

1208
01:25:49,704 --> 01:25:51,638
Yee-haw!

1209
01:25:51,706 --> 01:25:53,503
No, Dwayne!

1210
01:25:53,575 --> 01:25:56,408
i'm comin', Connie.

1211
01:26:10,223 --> 01:26:12,123
All right!

1212
01:26:15,762 --> 01:26:20,221
Get up there! Where i come from,
we treat ladies with respect.

1213
01:26:20,299 --> 01:26:23,962
Thank you, Dwayne,
but i'm no lady; i'm a Duck!

1214
01:26:24,036 --> 01:26:27,665
- Come on!
- Way to go, you little filly.

1215
01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:29,672
i'll get you for th-

1216
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:32,641
Referee taking Robertson
over to the penalty box.

1217
01:26:32,743 --> 01:26:37,339
What are they gonna call this
penalty? It's two minutes for roping?

1218
01:26:37,415 --> 01:26:41,373
That's a new one on me. We're
at the end of the second period.

1219
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:44,249
Iceland has a commanding
four-to-one lead.

1220
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:47,757
This isn't a hockey game;
it's a circus.

1221
01:26:52,962 --> 01:26:56,625
- Did you all enjoy that?
- Yeah!

1222
01:26:56,732 --> 01:27:01,725
So did they, because they're still three
points up and we're one period away from defeat.

1223
01:27:04,005 --> 01:27:08,169
- if we can't beat them, we might as well keep our pride.
- Yeah.

1224
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:11,770
Jesse, that's not pride.

1225
01:27:11,845 --> 01:27:15,611
Sure, when Dwayne roped that
big oaf, part of me cheered.

1226
01:27:15,682 --> 01:27:18,617
But, guys, i've been there.
i know how you feel.

1227
01:27:18,685 --> 01:27:22,586
i wanted to cream that jerk that busted
my knee when i played in the minors.

1228
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:26,284
And i really, really wanted to go
after Stansson for that cheap shot.

1229
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:29,351
But you know what?
My knee will heal.

1230
01:27:29,428 --> 01:27:33,227
And if i become
someone i'm not...

1231
01:27:33,298 --> 01:27:36,699
if i sink
to their level...

1232
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:39,635
well, then,
i lost more than my knee.

1233
01:27:39,704 --> 01:27:41,638
You understand?

1234
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:44,139
Yeah.

1235
01:27:48,946 --> 01:27:52,313
We're not goons.
We're not bullies.

1236
01:27:52,383 --> 01:27:55,442
No matter
what people say or do...

1237
01:27:55,518 --> 01:27:57,952
we have to be ourselves.

1238
01:27:58,021 --> 01:28:00,387
You.
Who are you?

1239
01:28:00,456 --> 01:28:03,050
- Dean Portman.

Les Averman.
Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.

1247
01:28:21,175 --> 01:28:23,735
- Fulton Reed. Stillwater, Minnesota.
- That's right!

1248
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:25,937
Russ Tyler.
South Central Los Angeles.

1249
01:28:26,012 --> 01:28:28,344
Charlie Conway.
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1250
01:28:28,415 --> 01:28:30,679
Ken Wu.

1251
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:32,684
Connie Moreau.

1252
01:28:32,752 --> 01:28:34,413
Adam Banks.

1253
01:28:34,487 --> 01:28:36,613
Dwayne Robertson.

1254
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:38,781
Michele MacKay.
Duluth, Minnesota.

1255
01:28:38,857 --> 01:28:41,724
And i'm Gordon Bombay.
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1256
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:49,994
We're Team U.S.A., gathered
from all across America.

1257
01:28:50,068 --> 01:28:54,801
- And we're gonna stick together. You know why?
- Because we are Ducks.

1258
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:58,102
- And ducks fly together.
- That's right,Jan.

1259
01:28:58,175 --> 01:29:02,373
- And just when you think they're about
to break apart- - Ducks fly together!

1260
01:29:02,446 --> 01:29:07,110
- And when the wind blows hard and
the sky is black- - Ducks fly together!

1261
01:29:07,183 --> 01:29:12,450
When the roosters are crowing and the
cows are spinning circles in the pasture-

1262
01:29:12,521 --> 01:29:16,218
- Um. Okay.
- Ducks fly together!

1263
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:21,285
And when everyone says it can't be done
- Ducks fly together.

1264
01:29:21,362 --> 01:29:24,297
Now, new Ducks...

1265
01:29:24,365 --> 01:29:28,323
and old Ducks must unite
under a new banner.

1266
01:29:28,402 --> 01:29:31,530
And i thought perhaps
something like this.

1267
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:37,605
Wooo!

1268
01:29:40,546 --> 01:29:44,642
Here to start the third period,
what team is this?

1269
01:29:44,717 --> 01:29:49,051
It's not Team U.S.A. Yes, it
is. They've got on new uniforms.

1270
01:29:49,122 --> 01:29:53,023
They're wearing the logo of the
duck. I've never seen this before.

1271
01:29:53,091 --> 01:29:54,558
Yeah! Come on!

1272
01:29:56,895 --> 01:30:00,694
I'vejust gotten word that there is
no rule against changing uniforms.

1273
01:30:00,764 --> 01:30:05,167
- Come on. This is ridiculous.
- Well, Gordon Bombay's old team was called the "Ducks';..

1274
01:30:05,236 --> 01:30:08,467
and I guess we've got
the U.S.A. Ducks out there now.

1275
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,172
Quack! Quack!
Quack!

1276
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:26,452
Go... Ducks!

1277
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,463

~Buddy,you're a boy

1282
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:01,214
~Playin'in the street
Gonna be a big man someday ~

1283
01:31:01,287 --> 01:31:04,744
~ You got mud on your face
You big disgrace ~

1284
01:31:04,822 --> 01:31:07,222
~Kickin'your can
all over the place ~

1285
01:31:07,292 --> 01:31:11,991
- ~Singin'~
- ~ We will We will rock you ~

1286
01:31:12,063 --> 01:31:14,758
Germaine gives it to Wu.
Wu back to Germaine.

1287
01:31:14,831 --> 01:31:18,562
Germaine slides it to Connie
Moreau. She shoots. She scores.!

1288
01:31:20,504 --> 01:31:23,632
Connie Moreau with a lovely move
in front of the net...

1289
01:31:23,707 --> 01:31:26,903
pulls Team U.S.A.
to within two goals.

1290
01:31:26,976 --> 01:31:30,207
Yes! Yes. All right,
you guys! Way to go!

1291
01:31:32,882 --> 01:31:36,578
Team U.S.A. still down by two
goals. Trying to get back in it.

1292
01:31:36,651 --> 01:31:41,111
- Shot and a diving save by Goldberg.
- Watch your back!

1293
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:45,249
Averman with it, leads the attack. Comes
right up the middle. Averman lost the puck.

1294
01:31:45,326 --> 01:31:47,851
Iceland gets it over Gunnar Stahl.
He's got an open net. He scores.!

1295
01:31:47,928 --> 01:31:53,093
- Yes! - Oh, that hurts. The
Ducks trail now, five-to-two.

1296
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:55,260
Okay, Ducks,
take a look here.

1297
01:31:55,336 --> 01:31:59,237
- Charlie, this isn't the NBA.
- it's the perfect teamwork play.

1298
01:32:10,349 --> 01:32:12,579
Now, cowboy!

1299
01:32:12,684 --> 01:32:14,709
Alley-oop, boys.

1300
01:32:24,729 --> 01:32:28,892
Yeah!

1301
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:33,967
Wooo!
All right!

1302
01:32:34,037 --> 01:32:35,971
Yeah.! Wooo.!

1303
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:38,006
All right!

1304
01:32:38,073 --> 01:32:40,007
That's the way,
Dwayne!

1305
01:32:40,075 --> 01:32:42,908
Play continues here
in the final period.

1306
01:32:42,978 --> 01:32:46,175
The hitting has picked up, but
the Ducks are hanging in there.

1307
01:32:46,248 --> 01:32:49,148
However, they're still down by
two goals with time running out.

1308
01:32:49,217 --> 01:32:52,812
Bodies flying all over the ice.
The puck is in the Ducks'zone.

1309
01:32:52,887 --> 01:32:55,549
Here's Mendoza on a breakaway.
He can really fly.

1310
01:32:55,623 --> 01:32:58,819
The speedster
into the Iceland zone.

1311
01:33:03,063 --> 01:33:05,588
- i stopped.
- Put it in, Luis!

1312
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:08,032
He scores.!

1313
01:33:08,101 --> 01:33:10,830
- Luis Mendoza on a breakaway...
- Yeah!

1314
01:33:10,903 --> 01:33:13,371
scores with
two minutes left.

1315
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:15,373
And the Ducks
trail by one.

1316
01:33:18,444 --> 01:33:22,504
it's five-four. We are still
in this. Come on, we can do it!

1317
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:25,071
- Russ.
- Yeah, Coach.

1318
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:28,119
- Two minutes left. Can you get your shot off?
- i don't know.

1319
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:31,177
- They're gunning for me.
- Make it happen.

1320
01:33:40,997 --> 01:33:44,524
Get off me, man. Get off me!

1321
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:49,060
Time out. Time out. Time
out! Guys, come in. Come on!

1322
01:33:49,138 --> 01:33:52,868
Goldberg! Huddle up! Listen up!

1323
01:33:52,941 --> 01:33:55,136
This is what i wanna do.

1324
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:59,977
When 56, Tyler's on the ice, he's covered
with three men. Do you understand that?

1325
01:34:00,048 --> 01:34:02,447
- Ya.
- Okay. Go!

1326
01:34:02,516 --> 01:34:05,451
Go... Ducks.!

1327
01:34:05,519 --> 01:34:08,079
Let's go!

1328
01:34:08,155 --> 01:34:10,783
Time running out here
in the third period.

1329
01:34:10,858 --> 01:34:16,261
The Ducks with the puck. They're still down
by a goal. They're back in their own zone.

1330
01:34:16,329 --> 01:34:19,389
I don't know why they're not moving it
up to center ice. They have to attack.

1331
01:34:19,466 --> 01:34:23,663
- The clock is ticking. Iceland with a one goal lead.
- All right! Guy, now!

1332
01:34:23,736 --> 01:34:28,002
Here's Germaine in his own zone.
Germaine gives it to Luis Mendoza.

1333
01:34:28,073 --> 01:34:31,736
Mendoza goes behind the net.
Starts up on the attack.

1334
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:34,835
Mendoza drops it back
to- to Goldberg?

1335
01:34:34,912 --> 01:34:38,507
He gave it to the goaltender
Goldberg. Wait, it's not Goldberg.

1336
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:41,416
- it's Russ. - Here,
take it. - Thanks.

1337
01:34:41,486 --> 01:34:43,817
The goalie!

1338
01:34:45,489 --> 01:34:48,424
Tyler with it.
Tees up the puck.

1339
01:34:48,492 --> 01:34:51,427
- No!
- With the knucklepuck.

1340
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:57,923
- Russ Tyler with the knucklepuck ties the game...
- Yeah!

1341
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,868
with no time left
on the clock.

1342
01:35:06,508 --> 01:35:09,409
Yeah! That's my boy! That's my boy!

1343
01:35:13,515 --> 01:35:16,244
Yeah!

1344
01:35:20,754 --> 01:35:23,985
So the championship
comes down to a shootout.

1345
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:28,117
Each team picks five of their
best. One-on-one with the goalie.

1346
01:35:28,194 --> 01:35:31,721
No rebounds. Best of
five shots wins it all.

1347
01:35:31,798 --> 01:35:33,925
What a way to end it.!

1348
01:35:58,721 --> 01:36:02,418
Yeah!

1349
01:36:29,783 --> 01:36:31,648
All right!

1350
01:36:50,368 --> 01:36:51,995
Yeah!

1351
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:06,534
Yes!
Oh, yes!

1352
01:38:11,842 --> 01:38:15,106
Gunnar, you can do it.
Come on.

1353
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:17,271
Go.

1354
01:38:20,617 --> 01:38:24,644
Julie, you got the fast glove.
i know this kid's move.

1355
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:28,121
Triple deke, glove side.
Anticipate it and you got him.

1356
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:31,353
- What if he goes stick side?
- He's fancy. He'll go glove.

1357
01:38:31,427 --> 01:38:33,657
Don't hesitate.
Let's go.

1358
01:38:33,729 --> 01:38:36,663
In a surprise move,
Bombay has gone to his bench.

1359
01:38:36,731 --> 01:38:40,724
He's sending outJulie Gaffney to replace
Goldberg. She'll face Gunnar Stahl.

1360
01:38:40,802 --> 01:38:45,795
- Go get him,Julie.
- I don't know about this move by Bombay.

1361
01:38:45,872 --> 01:38:48,739
Putting in a cold goaltender
to face the leading scorer...

1362
01:38:48,809 --> 01:38:51,642
in the tournament.

1363
01:38:51,712 --> 01:38:56,081
But hang on to your hats. Here we
go. IfJulie "The Cat'"Gaffney...

1364
01:38:56,149 --> 01:38:59,311
stops Gunnar Stahl,
the U.S.A. wins.

1365
01:38:59,385 --> 01:39:01,751
That's one.

1366
01:39:01,821 --> 01:39:03,550
Two.

1367
01:39:03,623 --> 01:39:06,091
Three.

1368
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:30,777
Ducks win.! Ducks win.!

1369
01:39:30,847 --> 01:39:33,680
- Oh, I can't believe it.! The Ducks have come...
- Yes! Yes!

1370
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,650
- from behind to beat Iceland...
- Yes! Yes!

1371
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:38,152
in a shootout
in the championship game.!

1372
01:39:40,122 --> 01:39:42,682
Nice try.

1373
01:39:42,758 --> 01:39:46,922
Bombay, the Minnesota
Miracle Man, has done it again.

1374
01:40:15,954 --> 01:40:17,854
Gunnar.

1375
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:22,055
You lost it for me.

1376
01:40:22,126 --> 01:40:24,651
You lost it
for yourself.

1377
01:40:28,733 --> 01:40:31,997
Let's go shake
their hands.

1378
01:40:34,671 --> 01:40:36,332
- Good game.
- Good game.

1379
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:38,306
- Good game.
- Good game, guys.

1380
01:40:39,309 --> 01:40:42,072
Good work, Captain Duck.

1381
01:40:42,144 --> 01:40:44,009
Thanks, Gunnar.

1382
01:40:49,485 --> 01:40:52,749
- Good job, Coach.
- Thanks, Wolf.

1383
01:40:52,821 --> 01:40:55,756
We'll see ya again.

1384
01:40:55,824 --> 01:41:00,227
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

1385
01:41:43,033 --> 01:41:46,934
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!

1386
01:41:49,939 --> 01:41:54,273
Come on, Ducks!
We're goin' home.

1387
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:14,756
- Whoa! Help me!
- You're not supposed to light it on fire.

1388
01:42:16,897 --> 01:42:20,856
