2
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:23,186
My name's Huck... Huck Finn, and this
story's about me and a slave named Jim.

3
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:27,107
It's mainly the truth. Oh, sure,
there's a few stretchers here and there,

4
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:30,907
but I never met anybody who didn't lie
a little when the situation suited him.

5
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,868
So kick off your shoes,
if you're wearin' 'em,

6
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:35,468
and get ready
for a spit-lickin'good time.

7
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,869
Come on, Finn!

8
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,789
Hit me! Come on!

9
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:45,509
Come on, Finn!
Come on!

10
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:49,430
Come on, Finn!
Come on! Let's go!

11
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,910
Hit me! Hit me! Come on!

12
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,711
- Hit me! Afraid of me?
- That all you got?

13
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,992
Come on...

14
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,833
Knock him
into Tuesday, Huck!

15
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:17,993
- Ahhh! Ahhh!
- Oooh!

16
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,794
Ahhhhhh!

17
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,715
- Go for the glory, Huck!
- Yeah, go for the glory!

18
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:38,156
Personally I can't see no glory
in punching an ignorant lard ass.

19
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:41,716
But... I gots to.

20
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,238
- Pap.
- Come on! What're you doin', Huck?

21
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:01,559
I whooped him!
I whooped him good!

22
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:24,482
- Hey, Louise! Is Jim home?
- Hello, Huckleberry.

23
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:27,362
- Hey. Thanks.
- My husband's in the cabin.

24
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:33,123
Ohhh! I'm startin'to lose
the vision. I'm startin'to lose...

25
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:36,003
It's goin' and it's goin'!

26
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:41,364
Ahhh, now it's comin' back.
It's comin' back now.

27
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:45,284
- Aaah!
- Hey, everybody.

28
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,285
Hey, Sam. Hey, Otis.

29
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,525
Hey, Huck.

30
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:54,205
- Sorry for bustin' in, Jim.
- That's all right.

31
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:58,406
- But I need some advice on my futures.
- What kinda advice you need?

32
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,966
Pap's back.

33
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:05,767
Are you sure? 'Cause he ain't
been seen for more than a year now.

34
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:08,847
I saw his boot print,
the cross made with nails.

35
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,688
To ward off the devil.
Yeah, that's your pap, all right.

36
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:15,368
- I need to know what he's gonna do and
how long he's gonna stay. - Now hold on.

37
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:19,049
I ain't never done this
for no white folks before.

38
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,409
I-I-I don't even know
if it's gonna work.

39
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,090
Give you some marbles.

40
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,290
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to try.

41
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,130
Thanks, Jim.

42
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:51,173
- What in hell's bells is that?
- Hair ball... from a ox!

43
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,893
Puked it up just the other day.

44
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:58,573
- That'll tell me my future?
- Shhh!

45
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:02,214
Spirit lives on the inside of it.

46
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:05,414
Yeah. Uh-huh.

47
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:08,495
Uh-huh.
Ya don't say?

48
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,855
No! Not to my good friend
Mr. Finn here!

49
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,375
No!

50
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,816
Your old Pap got two spirits
hoverin' around him.

51
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:24,977
A sweet one with wings
and a mean one with horns.

52
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:28,897
Sometime he listen to the good one,
and sometime he listen to the bad one.

53
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:31,618
The good spirit tell 'im
to leave you alone,

54
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:34,538
but the bad one tells him
to come and get ya!

55
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:40,779
Now, the hair ball
don't know...

56
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,499
which spirit gonna be
the most convincin'.

57
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:46,980
It says that your future...

58
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,180
is driftin' like...

59
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,180
the river.

60
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:04,982
When your Pap's around...

61
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:08,102
he always beatin' on you, ain't he?

62
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:13,703
Yeah...

63
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,063
when he can catch me.

64
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,104
Well, the hair ball thinks that maybe
you ought to skedaddle for a while.

65
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:24,024
At least until after
your Pap goes away again.

66
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:30,265
Come tomorrow morning, they'll be
talkin' about me in the past tense.

67
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,546
Jim was owned
by Miss Watson, and about a year ago...

68
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,786
Miss Watson and her sister,
the Widow Douglas, took me in.

69
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:43,227
They wanted to civilize me, which most
people thought was a right nice idea.

70
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:47,707
But seein' as how I'm so ignorant
and kinda low-down and ornery...

71
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,707
- Huckleberry!
- You come in here!

72
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:53,948
- it wasn't workin' out real well.
- You missed dinner.

73
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:57,468
- You'll go to bed hungry.
- So if ya starve to death by mornin'...

74
00:07:57,588 --> 00:08:01,349
- we'll lay your carcass out for
the birds to eat. - Oh, my land!

75
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,309
- What happened to your eye?
- How'd ya get that shiner?

76
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,070
I saw a blind man
walkin' down the street...

77
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,590
when all of a sudden a gang
of thieves jumped out and grabbed him.

78
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,991
Well, I tried to stop 'em,
but bein' so little and all,

79
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,591
they just walloped me
in the eye and ran off.

80
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:19,231
That the same gang of thieves who stole
your school books last week?

81
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,111
Yep, same gang.

82
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:24,272
You told us you whopped 'em so bad
they was never comin' back!

83
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:27,872
I-I did. But this time
they brung reinforcements.

84
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:32,673
Hey, where is your fancy school clothes,
Huckleberry! What are these rags?

85
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:35,233
You played hooky, didn't ya?

86
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:38,394
No, ma'am.
I went to school.

87
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:42,074
And on my way home, I ran into a poor
mother with her ten poor children.

88
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,274
Last week that poor mother
only had eight children.

89
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:47,235
- Well, now she's got two more.
- Uh-huh.

90
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:50,475
- Anyways, I gave 'em my fancy clothes
to help 'em stay warm. - Hmm!

91
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:53,636
You sweet child!

92
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:56,636
I knew we could change him.
I just knew it.

93
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:59,876
- Why, he's downright chivalrous.
- Why, he's downright nauseous.

94
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:04,997
And for being so chivalrous, I'm going
to clean you up and dress you up...

95
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:08,637
and give you something to eat
before evening prayers.

96
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,800
Meow!

97
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,801
Meow.

98
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:41,202
- Shhh!
- Come on down, Huck.

99
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,122
Aw, hell.

100
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,362
I should've known better.

101
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:52,163
I should've finished packing and
ran away right then. But no,

102
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:56,123
I had to go sneak out and play
with my friends one last time.

103
00:09:56,203 --> 00:10:01,324
Little did I know... that that one
mistake was gonna change my life forever.

104
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:18,046
- Goin' somewhere?
- Maybe I am, and maybe I ain't.

105
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:22,247
Don't you give me none of your lip!

106
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,887
I don't wanna wake
anybody up just yet.

107
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:29,128
But you move, and
I'll wail ya good.

108
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:33,288
Well, looks like you put on considerable
many frills since I've been away.

109
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:37,489
I hear ya can read and write.

110
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,529
Who told you to meddle in such
highfalutin foolishness anyhow?

111
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,129
The widow told me.

112
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:46,170
- I'll wail you good for meddlin'
in something like that!

113
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,250
Pretty soon you'll be taking up
religion like your ma did.

114
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,570
Would you leave Ma out of this?
She's dead and you better...

115
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,091
Don't you sass me,
or you'll be joinin' her!

116
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:00,932
Well, ain't you
the sweet-scented dandy!

117
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:05,452
With your polished clothes
and your nice bed.

118
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:11,053
I never seen such a son as you!

119
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,533
Well, I'm not gonna stand for it.

120
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:18,854
Leave me alone! Let me go!
- You're comin' with me!

121
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:22,094
- Let me go!
- Oh!

122
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:25,975
No!

123
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:32,856
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Pap Finn, you devil in disguise!

124
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:36,376
Outta my way, you old maid! This here
is what's mine, and I'm takin' it!

125
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,777
- Put that sweet boy down! Ohh!
- Leave them alone! Leave them alone!

126
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,897
Say good-bye, boy,
'cause you ain't never gonna see...

127
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,577
these two old biddies again.

128
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,300
I knew I was in trouble, and
it were only gonna get worse...

129
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,700
once Pap started drinkin'.

130
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:16,901
I was up the river
with some acquaintances of mine,

131
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:21,702
and we were doin' some...
jobs, and I got the news.

132
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:26,062
So when I found out
your ma left you $600,

133
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:29,623
I figured I'd come and get my due.

134
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:33,103
I mean, don't I deserve it...

135
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:37,784
after all the trouble and expense
I went through to raise you proper?

136
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:47,385
But no.

137
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,494
judge Thatcher says
that money's gotta stay

138
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:57,186
in the bank 'til you get
yourself to legal age!

139
00:12:57,306 --> 00:13:01,787
Legal age.
I can't be waitin' that long!

140
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:09,428
What'd I do with that bottle?

141
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,469
But I'm...

142
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,271
I'm your next of kin.

143
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,631
And you're my little angel.

144
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:42,952
I-I ain't no angel, Pap.
You can ask Miss Watson.

145
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,713
Aaah!

146
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,633
Damn it!

147
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:58,954
No, Pap! No!

148
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:04,395
No! No!

149
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:07,075
No, Pap!

150
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,716
- Yes!
- Pap!

151
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,563
What're you doin' with my gun?

152
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:16,564
Uh... I thought I heard
somebody tryin' to break in,

153
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:19,844
- and I was waitin' for 'em, Pap!
- Well, why didn't ya rouse me?

154
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:22,325
I tried, but I couldn't.

155
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:25,045
Hey, what're you
doin' here anyway?

156
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,845
You brought me here, Pap.

157
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,926
Did I? Why?

158
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:34,606
- 'Cause you said you missed me so.
- Don't you lie to me.

159
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,727
That couldn't be the reason.

160
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:42,567
Oh, yeah, that money your ma left you.
Damned Judge Thatcher!

161
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:47,248
Have to think of another way.
Look at this place.

162
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:52,328
- What'd you do to my house?
- I didn't do anything, Pap.

163
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:00,769
I'm goin' to town.
You clean up around here.

164
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,930
Yes, Pap.

165
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,250
Mmmm. "Yes, Pap."

166
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,451
Little runt.

167
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:25,573
I knew if I stuck around I'd be dead.

168
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,653
But dead was the only way
Pap would ever leave me alone.

169
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:41,295
Wild boars are mighty good eatin'. And
this one were gonna save my life as well.

170
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:45,823
What the...

171
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:01,705
Now that I was dead,
I could do what I wanted...

172
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:06,425
and go where I wanted, and neither Pap nor
Miss Watson would ever try and follow me.

173
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,906
And right now, I figured
I'd go to Jackson's Island.

174
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:11,466
No one lives there
nor hardly visits,

175
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:13,826
and the fishin's
awful good too.

176
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:59,792
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

177
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:04,193
- Huck? - Hell's bells, Jim! I
almost puked up my livers.

178
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:06,313
- I thought you was dead.
- I ain't dead.

179
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,393
But your Pap came into town
this mornin'...

180
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:11,233
screamin' about how some robbers
had cut you into a million pieces.

181
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:15,114
Faked it all, Jim.
I'm as alive as you.

182
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:21,475
- Nope. You ain't dead.
- Funny, Jim!

183
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:27,355
- Your Pap look like he done seen the
devil himself. - Scared him, did I?

184
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:29,651
Scared him? You scared
the whole town. They's

185
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:31,636
out huntin' down your
murderer right now.

186
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:35,156
- That's mighty nice of 'em. - The widow
wants you to have a proper burial,

187
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:39,957
so she got all the womenfolk fleecin'
the woods lookin' for your carcass.

188
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:44,758
- Wish 'em luck, Jim. They ain't gonna
find my remainders. - No, they're not.

189
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:48,198
You know,
I kinda like bein' dead.

190
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,158
Come on!

191
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,599
Whoo!

192
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:59,760
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

193
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,641
Say, Jim! Shouldn't ya be gettin'
back before Miss Watson misses ya?

194
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:11,521
Well, Huck...

195
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,321
You promise not to tell on me
if I tell you somethin'?

196
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:17,402
Damned if I would, Jim.

197
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:20,202
Honest Injun.

198
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:24,043
Well, I believe you,
so I'm gonna tell you.

199
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:28,483
This mornin' in all the confusion
caused by your murder...

200
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,963
- I ran off!
-Jim!

201
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:33,724
- You promised not to tell!
- I know I did! I know.

202
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:36,124
And my word's my word,
and I'll keep my word.

203
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:39,245
But Jim...
you're a runaway slave!

204
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:43,165
I could get tarred
for not turnin' you in.

205
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,725
I could get lynched.

206
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,766
Why'd ya do it, Jim?

207
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:52,366
A slave trader come by the other day
and offered Miss Watson $800 for me.

208
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:55,167
Her and the widow felt
so bad they pert near cried.

209
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,967
But times is tough. It was
just too much money to resist.

210
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:00,727
I couldn't let myself get sold
all the way down New Orleans.

211
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:04,048
- I'd never see my wife and
my children again! - But Jim!

212
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:07,808
Now ya ain't never
gonna get to see 'em.

213
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:10,528
My only chance is
to go downriver to Cairo.

214
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:15,169
- Go south? A runaway slave go south?
- I know, I know!

215
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,449
But I got me a canoe,
Huck, and this.

216
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,450
A map to freedom.
Now, here's me.

217
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,090
If I can get myself
all the way down here to Cairo,

218
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,771
where the Ohio River
comes into the Mississippi,

219
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:32,451
I can take it all the way
up to the free states.

220
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:36,932
You know how hard that'd be, Jim?
It's a million miles to Cairo!

221
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:40,772
And a slave
on the river by himself?

222
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:43,653
- Ya won't get five miles.
- I know.

223
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:46,373
But if I could do it,
if I could...

224
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:50,614
I'd get the chance to earn
money to buy my family.

225
00:21:54,974 --> 00:21:57,534
Ah, hell!

226
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,495
We'll do it together.

227
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,816
I'll help you get to Cairo.

228
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:15,137
Aw, shut up, Jim!

229
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:19,497
- Now, don't be long, and don't forget
the eggs. - All right. All right.

230
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,417
- And the flour.
- All right.

231
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:23,378
And the candles,
matches, tobacco...

232
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:27,018
Hell's bells, Jim! Whatever ain't
nailed down is what I'll get!

233
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,498
And don't let nobody
recognize you.

234
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:38,820
- Well, hello, ma'am.
- Hello, child. My lands!

235
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,420
- What happened to your eye?
- A cow kicked me.

236
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,620
Gracious! Well,
what can I do for you?

237
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,301
Well, I was comin' from
Hookville to visit my cousin...

238
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:51,221
- when my horse went lame.
- Oh, dear me! Well, come in, come in.

239
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:54,062
My, that's a pretty bonnet!

240
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:57,422
- A little girl across the lane has one
just like it. - It's a popular style.

241
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,102
Well, it looks so much cuter on you.
So, what's your name?

242
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,663
Sarah.
Sarah Williams.

243
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,183
Well, she got
to talking about this and about that...

244
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,103
and blah-di-blah-di-blah until I wanted
to wring her scrawny little neck.

245
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:12,224
So I decided to take advantage
of the situation.

246
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:15,024
But by and by, she got to
talking about the murder.

247
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,104
That's where
my husband is right now,

248
00:23:17,224 --> 00:23:19,785
out with some of the other men
trying to hunt up the murderer.

249
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:21,865
And when they find him,
they's gonna shoot him.

250
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,425
That's good! 'Cause I heard
Huck Finn was such a sweet boy.

251
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:27,866
That ain't what I heard.

252
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:31,986
So who do they think
killed him?

253
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:35,187
At first, everyone figured that
old Pap Finn done it himself.

254
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:37,587
- Is that so?
- They almost lynched him, too.

255
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:41,027
But then he up and vanished with
some of his rapscallion friends.

256
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:43,381
It ain't no matter.
'Cause now everyone judges

257
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,508
that the man who
murdered poor Huck Finn...

258
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:47,668
were a runaway slave named Jim.

259
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:50,349
Jim!

260
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:51,909
Jim?

261
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:54,669
Missus, where's my jacket?

262
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,829
- Howdy, little one.
- Hello, good sir.

263
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:59,990
- What're you fetchin' off for? - I think
we found that murderin' runaway slave.

264
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,750
- Huh! - Now, we been lookin' everywhere,
and some old codger just now...

265
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,751
said that he saw smoke
out on Jackson Island.

266
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:09,511
Ain't nobody lives there and hardly
anyone visits, so it's gotta be him!

267
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,511
Hey, hey!

268
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:14,872
- Now, you watch yourself there, little
precious. - You be careful!

269
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:20,512
Oh, don't worry, I will. That slave
is worth $400, dead or alive.

270
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,393
I best be goin' now.

271
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:27,753
Oh, not until
you've had some vittles.

272
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,194
- What was your name again?
- Mary... Williams.

273
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:33,834
I thought you said it was Sarah.

274
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:36,674
Yessim, I did.
Sarah Mary Williams.

275
00:24:36,794 --> 00:24:39,195
Somes calls me Sarah;
somes calls me Mary.

276
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:43,515
My goodness!

277
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:48,916
- You think you could hit that rat for me?
- Be happy to.

278
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:58,397
- Got 'im!
- Good arm you got there.

279
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:02,198
Ohhh, I keep it in shape
with lots of knittin'.

280
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:05,598
- You is a boy!
- Oh, how you do tease a poor girl so.

281
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,518
You may fool some, but not me!

282
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:09,959
If you was a girl, you'd have missed
that rat by six or seven feet.

283
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,159
Now fess up!
Who is ya?

284
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,160
You fess up, you little thing! You tell
me, who is ya? You tell me, who is ya?

285
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,320
Oh! Oh!

286
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
Come back here!

287
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,921
-Jim! Jim, wake up! Wake up!
- Huh?

288
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:30,201
- Oh, man! - Look at you, Huck.
If you ain't the prettiest...

289
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,362
They's after us, Jim, and there ain't
a minute to lose. Come on!

290
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:40,923
- Come on.
- Hurry up!

291
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:45,563
- Come on, come on! Them dogs sound hungry!
- Then get a move on.

292
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:54,964
Hey!

293
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:58,045
We was off,
headin' down the mighty Mississippi...

294
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:01,765
on the journey to Cairo
to set Jim free.

295
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:05,326
'Course, first we had to stop
along the way and borrow a few things.

296
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:08,686
Say, Huck,
I been feelin'...

297
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:12,087
mighty guiltful 'bout all this
borrowin' we've been doin'.

298
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,087
- Ah, you'll get over it.
- That ain't the point.

299
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:19,767
That ain't who
I think it is, is it?

300
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:25,128
It's you, all right, Jim.

301
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:28,929
" Four hundred dollar reward.

302
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:31,609
- Runaway slave."
- And what's that say?

303
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:35,489
Uh... handsome
and well-mannered.

304
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:39,050
Oh... Now come on, Huck,
what's it really say?

305
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,210
Nothin'.
Just that you're wanted for murder.

306
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,011
Murder! I...

307
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:49,851
Ohhh, I see.

308
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:52,252
I'm wanted for your murder.

309
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:55,892
Well, we best travel only at night.

310
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:01,453
Is that what I really look like?

311
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:05,093
- 'Fraid so, Jim.
- Damn!

312
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,936
- Oh, did you see that?
- Let's go for it!

313
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:28,696
- What if there's people on it?
- No way!

314
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:32,657
A body'd have to be crazy to be on that
wreck! She's bound to break up any second.

315
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:36,097
Oh, fine! Then let's
just get right aboard!

316
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,379
Looks like she ain't
been here long.

317
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:58,220
Yeah. Might be some good loot around.
Let's split up and see what she's got.

318
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,580
Hold on, hold on! Dead bodies is
what she's got, so let's be careful.

319
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,461
Right!

320
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,621
- I'll go this way.
- I'll go below.

321
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,822
- Oh!
- Oh!

322
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:28,664
Please don't kill me, boys.
Please don't kill me!

323
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:32,984
You're a lyin' thief, Joe Turner, and now
you're gonna pay for it with your life!

324
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:36,185
Wait, listen! You can keep my share,
I won't tell nobody!

325
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:38,945
It's too late for that now!

326
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:41,265
Ohh! Ohh!

327
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,226
This thing's sinkin'
quicker than we figured!

328
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:52,747
Yeah, let's get the booty
and get outta here!

329
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:55,867
- You can't just leave me here. You can't
leave me! - You killed your own partner.

330
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:58,507
He deserved the bullet
I gave him!

331
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:00,628
Uhhh!

332
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:13,829
Aaah!

333
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:30,792
Damn! One more like that
and she's had it!

334
00:29:30,912 --> 00:29:34,232
You can't just leave me here, boys.
You can't just leave me!

335
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:36,752
- Ah, shut up!
- Uhh!

336
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:40,193
- Hey, get over here!
- Aaah!

337
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,553
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

338
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:46,073
- What're you doin' here?
- Nothin'.

339
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,594
Grab the silver!

340
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,235
Oh, my God!
We're goin' down!

341
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,636
Aaah!

342
00:30:11,197 --> 00:30:14,717
- We best be goin',Jim! There's pirates
on board! - I know, I know!

343
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:21,278
The canoe!

344
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:23,678
Damn!

345
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:28,159
- They must have a boat on the other
side! Come on! - Let's get it!

346
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,119
There it is!

347
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:32,799
Move it, move it!

348
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:52,482
- Come on! Help me, Jim!
- I'm comin', I'm comin'!

349
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:33,527
I feel sort of bad for them
murderers dyin' like that.

350
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,527
I might end up bein'
murderer myself someday,

351
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:40,328
and how would I like it,
drownin' on some barge?

352
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,688
- Huck?
- Yeah, Jim.

353
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:47,569
If you was to hear that your Pap wasn't
ever gonna return to St. Petersburg,

354
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:50,242
like, if he up and
died or some such, would

355
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,969
you still help me to
get to Cairo and be free?

356
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,570
Or would you go on back home?

357
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,450
I'd go back, most likely, just to see
the look on people's faces.

358
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,371
We'd both go back, Jim,
bein' the right thing and all.

359
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:07,051
Yeah. Sure, bein'
the right thing and all.

360
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:10,252
Don't you worry. I'll make sure
Miss Watson takes you back.

361
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:22,853
Smell that, Huck?
Smells like freedom.

362
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:27,534
If that's Cairo,
I'm a free man!

363
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,454
And when I'm free,
I'm gonna work hard...

364
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:34,495
and save every penny and buy
my wife and my children.

365
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:37,495
And if they won't sell 'em,
I'll steal 'em!

366
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:40,255
You wouldn't.

367
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,576
Only if they won't
sell 'em, Huck.

368
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:48,016
They're my wife and my children. It
ain't right that they be bought and sold.

369
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:50,857
Someone gonna do it.
Ought to be me.

370
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:54,417
Listen to yourself.
Ya hear what you're sayin'?

371
00:32:54,537 --> 00:33:00,138
Sellin' people and usin' 'em
for slaves ain't right, Huck.

372
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:04,098
- Somehow... - That's the way it is,
and that's the way it's always been.

373
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:07,219
But it ain't right, Huck.

374
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:10,259
Don't ya see that to be true?

375
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,780
Slavery ain't right.
All men should be free.

376
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,860
I've never heard
such talk in my life.

377
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:25,141
Right then I knew
what I was doin' was wicked.

378
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:28,382
And I could feel the hand of God
about to take a swing at me.

379
00:33:28,502 --> 00:33:33,022
Then suddenly I knew what I had to do.
I had to turn Jim in.

380
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:35,182
Say, uh...Jim?

381
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:39,463
- Yeah, Huck.
- All these towns lookin' the same,

382
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,823
how're we gonna know
which one's Cairo?

383
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:46,104
- We'll see the Ohio River comin' in,
won't we? - We might miss it.

384
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:51,584
I'll tell you what. Next time we
see someone I'll grab a log,

385
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:56,065
- paddle ashore and ask 'em. - Don't worry,
Huck. We'll see the Ohio River comin' in.

386
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:58,785
But we might miss it!

387
00:33:58,905 --> 00:34:01,946
Best make sure.

388
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:05,306
Yeah.

389
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,587
Sure, Huck.

390
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:16,068
- Find anything, boys?
-Nothin' over here!

391
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:19,348
I know we're close, Huck.
We're safe!

392
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:21,508
You really don't have to do this!

393
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:24,029
Cairo could be anywhere.

394
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:28,549
I'll be right back.

395
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:33,190
I'd come mighty close to helpin' set Jim
free and goin' to hell for it.

396
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,430
But now I was gonna
do what's right,

397
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,710
and I was startin'
to feel real good.

398
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:48,552
There he goes...
true blue Huck Finn.

399
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:52,712
The only white gentleman ever kept
his promise to old Jim.

400
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:55,272
Huck Finn, a man of his word.

401
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:59,433
A man who sticks by his friends
come hell or high water.

402
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:03,113
I'm mighty proud to know him.

403
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,474
Ah, shut up, Jim.

404
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:14,915
Never forget ya, Huck.

405
00:35:18,755 --> 00:35:21,476
Best friend I ever had.

406
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:38,158
I felt just sick,
but I says to myself,

407
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:43,399
"Self, you's got to tell on 'im.
It's the only right thing to do. "

408
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,759
- You boy! That a raft out there yonder?
- Yes, sir, it is.

409
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,159
- Is it yours?
- Yes, sir.

410
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:52,480
Any men on it?

411
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,480
just one, sir.

412
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,761
We're lookin' for five slaves
that ran away last night.

413
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:03,041
The man on the raft,
is he white or black?

414
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:10,642
He's white.

415
00:36:10,762 --> 00:36:14,723
And maybe you're one of them abolitionist
boys that likes to help runaway slaves?

416
00:36:14,803 --> 00:36:18,163
- I believe we'd better look for ourselves.
- Oh, I wish you would.

417
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:20,236
'Cause it's my Pap out
there, and he's awful

418
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:22,363
sick. And so is my mom,
my sister, my brother...

419
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,484
You said there was
one man on that raft.

420
00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:27,924
I saw your guns and just
got scared, I guess.

421
00:36:28,044 --> 00:36:31,125
Need a tow over,
if ya don't mind.

422
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,245
We do mind, boy.
We're in a hurry.

423
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:38,005
- Oh, come on, get on board.
- Thank ya.

424
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:41,406
People usually just run away when I tell
'em my whole family is sick as dogs.

425
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:43,366
- What's wrong with 'em?
- Well...

426
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:47,207
my sister's pukin' everywhere,
my ma's smellin' real bad,

427
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:51,087
- my brother's skin's kinda rottin'
off his body. - Oh!

428
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,167
Pa... Oh,
it's disgusting!

429
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:56,048
Your whole family's got the pox, boy!
You wanna spread it around?

430
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:58,008
But I've asked everybody,
and nobody'll help me.

431
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:01,208
Downstream about 20 miles is
another town. You go ask them!

432
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:03,529
- Would that be Cairo? - No, Cairo
ain't for another hundred miles.

433
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:05,809
Listen, boy!

434
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:09,689
Next time, don't tell people what ya got.
Just lie your little face off. Now, get!

435
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:13,010
Uhhh! I can't believe
you're not gonna help us.

436
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,090
The smell on that raft's
just killin' me.

437
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,464
You see any runaway
slaves, boy, you get some

438
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:20,571
help and nab 'em. You
can make some money.

439
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:23,891
You bet, sir. I won't let
no runaway slaves get by me.

440
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:30,892
True blue Huck Finn.

441
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:35,453
It's always so damn troublesome
doin' right and so damn easy doin' wrong.

442
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:39,773
But I decided from now on, I'm just
gonna do whatever come handiest.

443
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:58,736
- You mean French people don't talk
the same as us? - Why, no, Jim.

444
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:01,696
You couldn't understand
a single word they said.

445
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:04,856
- Oh, I suppose you could.
- You suppose right.

446
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:07,337
I was taught some of
their jabber out of books.

447
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:11,137
- Oooh, you know some of their jabber, huh?
- Yeah, I do.

448
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:15,298
What would you think if a man came up
to you and said, " Pallee-voo Franzee?"

449
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:19,658
- I wouldn't think nothin'.
I'd just bust him over the head.

450
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:23,099
He ain't sayin' nothin' bad!
He just asked you if you talk French.

451
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,739
- Well, why didn't he just say it?
- He did just say it.

452
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:29,540
No, he didn't!
He said, " Pallee-voo Francine!"

453
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,418
Well, that's a Frenchman's way
of askin' if you talk French.

454
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:32,340
It's a stupid way of askin' it!

455
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,020
- It ain't stupid!
- Well, it is! It's ridiculous!

456
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,821
- It ain't ridiculous.
We just talk different.

457
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:44,101
- Lookit here, Jim! Does a cat talk like
we do? - No, a cat don't.

458
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,182
- Does a cow?
- No, a cow don't neither.

459
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:48,302
Does a cat talk like a cow
or a cow like a cat?

460
00:38:48,422 --> 00:38:51,942
All right, all right. No, they don't.
They talk different.

461
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:55,743
Right! And French people talk
different than us! Ya see?

462
00:38:55,863 --> 00:38:59,303
I rest my case!

463
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,183
All right, Mr. Finn.

464
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:06,304
- Is a cow a cat?
- No.

465
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:11,265
- Is a cat a cow?
- No.

466
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:15,465
- Is a cow a man?
- No, Jim.

467
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:18,106
- Is a cat a man?
- No.

468
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:22,826
- Is a Frenchman a man?
- Yeah.

469
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,507
Then we don't he
talk like a man?

470
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:27,547
Poke.

471
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:32,227
You see?
I rest my case.

472
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:37,468
You know... you've got
a point there, Jim.

473
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:43,349
And the point is...

474
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:46,389
just because you're taught
somethin's right,

475
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,190
and everybody believes
it's right,

476
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,350
it don't make it right.

477
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,190
You get my meaning?

478
00:39:57,231 --> 00:40:01,271
Yeah, I do.

479
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:08,672
-Jim! Let's get!
- Huh!

480
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:11,472
Jump, Huck! Jump!

481
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,793
-Jump!
- Aaah!

482
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:48,357
-Jim! Jim!
- Jim! Jim!

483
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:51,917
-Jim!
-Jim!

484
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:57,558
Jim.

485
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,759
Make a move, and I'll
blast you in half!

486
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,840
That's far enough now.
See if there's anybody else out there.

487
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:20,761
Why, Pa!
He's no Shepherdson!

488
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,601
- Hush, Sophie.
- No, he isn't. Put those guns down!

489
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:27,282
There's nothin' Shepherdson
about him at all.

490
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,482
- Look at that face.
- Well, then, what is your name, son?

491
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:32,043
I-I-It's
George Jackson, sir.

492
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,723
- You see! - Put your hand
down. - Hey, what's goin' on?

493
00:41:34,843 --> 00:41:38,523
- Here, let me dry you off.
- Ain't there no Shepherdsons around?

494
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:41,324
You know, we might've been shot,
you bein' so slow in comin', Billy.

495
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:44,364
Where did you come from, George?

496
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:46,844
I fell off a steamboat, sir.

497
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:50,165
- Whoa, fell off a steamboat!
- Oh, you poor boy! Falls off a steamboat,

498
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:53,045
and then you go and
scare him to death!

499
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:56,446
They was real nice
once they decided not to kill me.

500
00:41:56,566 --> 00:42:00,526
They told me they was the Grangerfords,
and asked me a million questions.

501
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:04,727
I decided it'd be best to leave out
the truth, so I slung 'em a story.

502
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,847
And after my pa got killed
in that stampede,

503
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:11,287
my ma ran off
with a circus clown.

504
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:13,528
Never saw her again.

505
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:17,008
- Well, you can stay here with us.
- As long as you like.

506
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:19,448
Thanks.

507
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,491
You see what I'm talkin' about?

508
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:43,572
Hey, George! Here's
a present for bein' my new friend.

509
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:49,932
This is the nicest thing
anybody's ever given me.

510
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:52,533
- Thanks, Billy.
- Billy!

511
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:55,053
Everything's been real quiet between
the Shepherdsons and us lately,

512
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,173
so don't you go
stirring things up.

513
00:42:57,253 --> 00:43:00,774
Oh, Sophie, leave me alone.
Come on, George.

514
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:03,174
Say, Billy, let's
slide on down to the river.

515
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:06,534
I wanna see if any of my...
belongings washed up on shore.

516
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:08,895
Well, first we gotta
take care of something.

517
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:11,455
Seems a lot of things have been
washing up lately.

518
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:25,697
A steamer hit his raft last night
and killed his master.

519
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:28,137
So he's ours.
We had to chain him.

520
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:31,858
Hey! Get up!
Come on, get up!

521
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:35,818
Looks a little rough. Me and you
gotta break him in a little bit.

522
00:43:35,938 --> 00:43:40,779
- Huck! So good to see you.
- Huck? Who you callin' Huck?

523
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:44,939
Why, my name's...
Bet ya can't spell my name?

524
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:49,100
I'll bet ya that dare.
It's G-O-R-G J-X-O-N.

525
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,580
You done it, all right.
I'm George Jackson.

526
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,340
Pleased to meet ya, sir.

527
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:12,983
Say, Billy...

528
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:16,223
why is everybody carryin' all them guns
and lookin' so itchy to use 'em?

529
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:18,704
Well, we got us
a feud goin' on.

530
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:21,104
Feud!
What's a feud?

531
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:23,424
You don't know
what a feud is?

532
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:26,865
It's like this. A man has a fight
with another man and kills him.

533
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:30,305
Then his brother kills him. Goes
on and on with everybody's brother...

534
00:44:30,385 --> 00:44:34,546
tryin' to kill everybody else's brother,
until everybody's killed off.

535
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,946
Our feud's been goin' on
for 30 years.

536
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:40,746
30 years!
Well, how'd it start?

537
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:44,547
- I don't know. - You mean, you don't
know why y'all killin' each other?

538
00:44:44,627 --> 00:44:46,627
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

539
00:44:49,227 --> 00:44:53,868
Hey, Boggs! You know Pa don't want
you doin' that any more.

540
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:02,669
- Get to work now. Come on!
- Yes, master.

541
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,631
Your child got three days work
before he can move on.

542
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:18,351
- Hello, boys.
- Hey, Pop.

543
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:21,191
Huck!

544
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:23,592
On that river, I had
a taste of freedom.

545
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:27,432
And now bein' a slave again...
Well, it feels so...

546
00:45:27,512 --> 00:45:30,153
so very bad.

547
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:33,913
Let's get on to Cairo,
Huck. Please.

548
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:38,434
- Let's get on outta here.
- All you think about is yourself, Jim.

549
00:45:38,554 --> 00:45:43,114
Well, what about me?
Don't I deserve somethin'?

550
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:46,155
I ain't had it so good
in all my life.

551
00:45:46,235 --> 00:45:49,915
Come on, George,
we're goin' fishin'!

552
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:53,275
And I ain't
in no hurry to leave.

553
00:45:53,395 --> 00:45:56,436
Hey, Boggs,
this one's all yours.

554
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:10,918
All right, come on,
get down outta there.

555
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:13,958
Come on, over here.

556
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,930
Now, my daddy was fishin'
on that other bank,

557
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:36,641
not payin' any attention
to all the rain.

558
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:41,322
And all of a sudden the bank gave way,
and into the river he went.

559
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:47,162
Yeah, that's my boy.

560
00:46:49,923 --> 00:46:54,283
All you think about is
yourself, Jim. Well, what about me?

561
00:47:25,127 --> 00:47:27,207
Come on, George,
it's supper time!

562
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:29,208
I'll be right there.

563
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:31,608
Jim!

564
00:47:56,931 --> 00:47:59,171
Jim.

565
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:09,733
It weren't my fault.

566
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,973
If you think I feel bad,

567
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:15,693
well, you're wrong!

568
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:20,094
If you think I'm gonna
apologize to a slave,

569
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:24,455
a runaway slave at that,
well, hah.

570
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:32,496
I didn't mean for this
to happen, Jim.

571
00:48:32,616 --> 00:48:35,416
It were the worst thing
I ever done in my life.

572
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:39,296
I'm real sorry, Jim.

573
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:42,537
Honest, I am.

574
00:48:48,618 --> 00:48:52,498
You're still my best
and only friend.

575
00:48:52,618 --> 00:48:55,098
Huck Finn.

576
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:58,499
Okay, all right.
Enough of this slop.

577
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,101
-Jim?
- Hmm?

578
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:15,821
'Bout time for us
to be leavin'.

579
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,502
- Huck?
- Shut up, Jim.

580
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:27,662
Sorry I'm late.

581
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:47,705
Cyrus!
What's goin' on?

582
00:49:47,825 --> 00:49:51,546
Miss Sophie went off
to marry a Shepherdson.

583
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,906
- Well, where'd everybody go?
- The women went to raise the relations.

584
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,346
Billy and the menfolk, they gonna
try and kill that Shepherdson boy...

585
00:49:57,466 --> 00:50:01,187
before he crosses the river
with Miss Sophie.

586
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:03,347
Thanks.

587
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,187
Lots of people
gonna die today.

588
00:50:14,068 --> 00:50:16,589
They're right
up ahead, boy!

589
00:50:54,873 --> 00:50:56,874
Oh, let's go!

590
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,675
- Hey, Billy!
- Hey, Billy.

591
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:08,675
I-It's me, it's me! Huck...
I mean, George! What's goin' on?

592
00:51:08,795 --> 00:51:12,516
George, they ambushed us! They killed
my pa and all my brothers!

593
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,716
Hell, they pert near killed us all!

594
00:51:22,437 --> 00:51:24,677
Come on, come on!

595
00:51:24,797 --> 00:51:26,838
We should've waited
for the relations.

596
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:29,598
Them Shepherdsons
knew we were comin'!

597
00:51:32,998 --> 00:51:36,479
- What happened to Miss Sophie? - Her and
that Shepherdson made it across the river.

598
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,359
Them dirty scoundrels.
George, I'm gonna kill 'em.

599
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,561
Billy!

600
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:59,842
Shoot 'im, boys!

601
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:02,082
Don't let 'im get away!

602
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:45,767
- See anything?
- No.

603
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:48,248
Let's try this way!

604
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:20,892
Huck! Huckleberry!

605
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:27,413
You were mighty good
to me, Billy.

606
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:31,773
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you my real name.

607
00:53:33,814 --> 00:53:35,894
It's Huck.

608
00:53:36,014 --> 00:53:39,854
Huckleberry Finn.

609
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:45,895
I'm sorry, Billy.

610
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:56,616
Come on, Huck.
Gotta bring him home.

611
00:54:05,017 --> 00:54:09,058
Jim and me found the
raft and fixed it up as best we could.

612
00:54:09,178 --> 00:54:14,379
It felt good gettin' back on the river.
Other places feel so cramped and smothered.

613
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:19,179
But the river don't. You always feel
warm and safe and free on the river.

614
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,460
That wasn't my fault.

615
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,700
You are the sorriest
thing I've ever seen.

616
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:30,061
That Russian fell in the river,
that's what happened.

617
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:33,781
Hello there!
We're lookin' for Cairo!

618
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:36,221
Can you tell us
how close we are?

619
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:40,142
Chuckleheads, you already passed it!
It's about 40 miles back!

620
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:42,102
Talk about lost!

621
00:54:47,223 --> 00:54:49,943
Must've missed it
that night in the fog, Jim.

622
00:54:52,183 --> 00:54:55,544
I'll be caught
and sold for sure.

623
00:54:58,264 --> 00:55:01,145
How're we gonna
get back to Cairo, Jim?

624
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:04,305
Sure can't take this raft
back up the river.

625
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,785
And no how can we fight this current.

626
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:11,066
- No, but we could take a
steamboat upriver! - Yeah!

627
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:14,386
We'll find one that's goin' north,
and then you can buy us passage.

628
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:17,267
Yeah, we'll keep headin' south
'til we find us a steamboat.

629
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:20,227
- Take it all the way back up to Cairo.
- Right up the Ohio.

630
00:55:20,347 --> 00:55:22,427
All the way up
to the free states.

631
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:25,108
Good thinkin', Huck.

632
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,988
Why, thank you, Jim.

633
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:36,629
- Here's some more wood, Jim.
- Right there.

634
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:39,189
Tryin' to get this fire goin'.

635
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,190
Come on, Duke! Over here!

636
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:44,030
Why are you always
stealin' chickens?

637
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:47,430
I love chickens.
They're succulent.

638
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,671
- We're chicken thieves! That's as low
as it gets. - Shut up and keep runnin'!

639
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:55,391
It seems to me, Jim, whenever
anybody's after anybody,

640
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:57,392
it's usually me
they's after.

641
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:02,552
Hello there,
we's in need of assist!

642
00:56:02,632 --> 00:56:04,473
- Let's get!
- You bet!

643
00:56:04,553 --> 00:56:06,393
Grab the oars!

644
00:56:06,473 --> 00:56:10,393
- Hold up! I'm right behind you, Duke!
- Come on, push off!

645
00:56:10,473 --> 00:56:12,714
Huh?

646
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:15,034
What the...

647
00:56:15,114 --> 00:56:18,434
Hey!
Get your own raft!

648
00:56:18,554 --> 00:56:20,995
- Thank you, lads. We'd be obliged.
- Thanks, nothin'!

649
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:24,395
- You was gonna hightail out and just leave
us, wasn't ya? - No, I weren't. Honest.

650
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:28,316
- Please, sir. - If ya don't let the boy
go, how's he gonna save our hides?

651
00:56:30,756 --> 00:56:32,956
Sorry, boy.

652
00:56:33,036 --> 00:56:35,997
People tryin' to kill me and...
dogs tryin' to rip my face off,

653
00:56:36,077 --> 00:56:38,157
and it ain't even breakfast yet.

654
00:56:38,277 --> 00:56:42,797
They call me the King, the King
of Bilgewater, and this here's the Duke.

655
00:56:42,917 --> 00:56:44,278
Pleased to meet ya.

656
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:49,358
The King and
the Duke seemed like nice enough fellas,

657
00:56:49,478 --> 00:56:51,959
but something about 'em
made me feel mighty uneasy.

658
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:54,319
They asked us
a considerable many questions.

659
00:56:54,439 --> 00:56:56,799
- Yeow! - Bull's-eye.
- And once again...

660
00:56:56,879 --> 00:56:59,399
I decided it would be best
to leave out the truth.

661
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,040
So... my ma grabbed onto
the trapeze and swung one way.

662
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:08,241
My pa came a-swingin' on the other.
My ma let go, did a double flip...

663
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:10,921
and missed my pa
by a good six feet.

664
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:14,161
She made quite a mess
when she hit them bleachers.

665
00:57:14,281 --> 00:57:17,042
I think this boy's gonna fit right in.

666
00:57:17,162 --> 00:57:20,402
Thank you, Jim. So what is it
you two fellas do, exactly?

667
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:22,882
We do a fair bit
of doctorin'.

668
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:26,443
Yeah. We can cure cancer,
paralysis, baldness.

669
00:57:26,603 --> 00:57:29,283
This time we're sellin' a thing
that takes tartar off of teeth.

670
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,204
- And it does take it off too.
- But unfortunately the...

671
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:36,404
- enamel goes right along with it.
- Yeah, well!

672
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:39,605
We also do some theatre.
Tragedy, you know.

673
00:57:39,725 --> 00:57:42,805
Yeah, we got enough... Shakespearean
costumes here for the lot of us.

674
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:46,165
But what we do best
are the three Es.

675
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:48,086
Robbery, forgery...

676
00:57:48,206 --> 00:57:50,166
and burglary.

677
00:57:50,286 --> 00:57:54,086
Hell's bells!
I wish I knew a good trade.

678
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:57,047
Well, maybe we'll teach you one, huh?

679
00:57:57,167 --> 00:58:00,407
Yeow! Go...
You skinny little rat bag!

680
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:03,488
I'm gonna wring
your skinny little neck!

681
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:08,208
Hey, watch it!
Stop peckin' at me!

682
00:58:10,928 --> 00:58:14,129
- Oh, good morning, boys.
- Good morning.

683
00:58:15,609 --> 00:58:18,089
Aw, hello, Duke.

684
00:58:18,209 --> 00:58:21,090
- We gotta run, now, huh?
- Naw, naw, naw, naw.

685
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,730
- I just been borrowin' a few things.
- Ah, yeah.

686
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,650
Nobody saw me.

687
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,411
But lookee what I found.

688
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:36,092
- You were headin' for your Uncle Billy's
plantation, huh? - Now, wait a minute.

689
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,732
You're a runaway murderin' slave's
what you are.

690
00:58:38,812 --> 00:58:41,372
I think maybe I'll just
collect that reward.

691
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:44,093
- He only murdered me.
- Now, look, we ain't exactly the type...

692
00:58:44,213 --> 00:58:46,013
to turn others
into the law.

693
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:49,213
We stay as far away from the law
as is humanly possible.

694
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,094
So if you two just, uh...

695
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:53,374
Listen up and shut up
and do as you're told...

696
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:57,014
-and wait on us hand and foot...
- and be real nice to us,

697
00:58:57,094 --> 00:58:59,175
we won't say a word.

698
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:03,375
You step out of line,
try and run and...

699
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,297
Oh, ho ho!

700
00:59:16,377 --> 00:59:18,217
Easy prey.

701
00:59:18,297 --> 00:59:20,537
- I'm all right!
- Ya think? - I do.

702
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,938
- Shall we?
- Let's.

703
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:26,298
Hello, there!
Happy morn to ya!

704
00:59:26,418 --> 00:59:30,459
And a good mornin'
to you all too!

705
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:32,379
Say, you wouldn't
happen to be...

706
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:34,299
the Wilks brothers,
now, would ya?

707
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:36,219
- Yes.
- No!

708
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,420
- No. - My name is Blodgett,
Dr. Alexander Blodgett.

709
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,340
This here is Franciscus, uh,

710
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,580
Adolphus and Jim.

711
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,140
- Oh, shoot.
- Adolphus?

712
00:59:46,261 --> 00:59:50,781
- I reckon it don't matter. They already
missed it anyways. - Missed? What?

713
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:52,941
Was an, um,

714
00:59:53,021 --> 00:59:54,862
economic opportunity
they missed, huh?

715
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:57,222
Oh, ho ho!
No, no, no.

716
00:59:57,342 --> 01:00:00,262
They'll get the money
and the property all right, but...

717
01:00:00,382 --> 01:00:04,223
they missed the death
of their brother Peter Wilks...

718
01:00:04,343 --> 01:00:06,663
down at Phelps Landing.

719
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,583
He died.

720
01:00:08,703 --> 01:00:10,464
Last night.

721
01:00:10,544 --> 01:00:13,184
- Too bad.
- So sad.

722
01:00:13,264 --> 01:00:17,504
Yup. He said he ain't
seen his two brothers...

723
01:00:17,624 --> 01:00:19,425
in more than 20 years.

724
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:21,345
Yeah? So, uh,

725
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:23,265
why did you think
we was them?

726
01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:25,785
Well, one of the brothers,
the preacher?

727
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:28,226
He's a lot older.
And the one that's deaf and dumb...

728
01:00:28,346 --> 01:00:31,746
he's a lot younger, see.

729
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:35,027
So when I saw you two,
I just reckoned maybe...

730
01:00:35,107 --> 01:00:39,267
- Are you leaving the area for a while?
- I'm goin' to New Orleans.

731
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:43,188
Well, methinks this calls
for a small libation!

732
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:45,348
- Ha ha ha ha!
- I'll drink to that!

733
01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:48,548
Right this way,
my gold-toothed friend!

734
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:51,269
We in trouble, Huck.

735
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:53,869
The King
and the Duke found out...

736
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,789
that the dead guy's brothers
lived over in England.

737
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:57,710
They hadn't had much time
to get the letter...

738
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,630
and might not have
gotten it at all.

739
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,950
So those two rat bags
grilled that flathead...

740
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,430
about everything and
everybody in his village,

741
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,511
right down to the damn
dog next door.

742
01:01:07,591 --> 01:01:09,431
- Woof!
- Mighty smart of ya!

743
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:11,351
Mighty smart of ya.

744
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:13,351
Was Peter Wilks well off?

745
01:01:13,471 --> 01:01:15,272
Oh, he was, uh,

746
01:01:15,392 --> 01:01:19,592
he was as rich
as King Soromon himself.

747
01:01:19,672 --> 01:01:21,513
I tell you, Jim,

748
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:25,193
the hand of providence is bound
to take a swing at them two.

749
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:27,593
And knowin' them,
they'll duck.

750
01:01:27,673 --> 01:01:30,234
How are you at
playing a preacher?

751
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,874
- How are you at playin' deaf and dumb?
- Pardon?

752
01:01:32,994 --> 01:01:35,754
- Heh heh heh heh heh!
- Ha ha ha ha!

753
01:01:35,874 --> 01:01:37,755
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:40,675
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

755
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:43,355
Attention, passengers!

756
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:46,956
jubilee leaving for Phelps Landing
in 15 minutes!

757
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,996
Do I have to wear this?

758
01:01:49,116 --> 01:01:51,356
Wanted to learn
a trade, didn't ya?

759
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:54,157
- Why can't we just wait here?
- Because I don't trust ya.

760
01:01:54,237 --> 01:01:56,077
You'd hightail it for sure,

761
01:01:56,157 --> 01:01:58,957
and we need to leave this raft
here for our getaway.

762
01:01:59,037 --> 01:02:00,877
Besides, we'll be
more convincing...

763
01:02:00,957 --> 01:02:04,278
after we arrive with an innocent
young boy as our valet.

764
01:02:04,398 --> 01:02:06,358
Who you callin' innocent?

765
01:02:06,478 --> 01:02:09,639
Look, you wouldn't want us
to accidentally turn in...

766
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:13,279
your runaway slave friend,
now, would ya?

767
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:17,640
Come on. Play along with us
for a couple of days.

768
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,920
We'll give ya 10 percent.

769
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,080
20.

770
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,240
- 15.
- Deal.

771
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,761
- You never looked better!
- I have too looked better!

772
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:28,681
- You're beautiful!
- I feel ridiculous!

773
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:30,641
- Hey, King!
- Yeah?

774
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:32,521
- Let's go buy those tickets.
- All right.

775
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:36,962
- Be right back.
- Shoo! Shoo, fly!

776
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:39,322
Shoo!

777
01:02:42,563 --> 01:02:46,723
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

778
01:02:49,644 --> 01:02:51,484
Funny, Huck. Very funny.

779
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,324
What in hell's bells
are you supposed to be?

780
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,845
The King said I was
a Swahili warrior.

781
01:02:56,965 --> 01:02:59,805
Even taught me some Swahili,
or what he said was Swahili.

782
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:04,205
- Sounded like a pig in heat to me.
- Hee hee.

783
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:21,528
I'd poked around a little...

784
01:03:21,608 --> 01:03:24,048
and found out that
a steamboat was leavin'...

785
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:26,008
from Phelps Landing
the day after tomorrow...

786
01:03:26,088 --> 01:03:27,928
and headin' all the way
up to Cairo.

787
01:03:28,048 --> 01:03:31,969
So all we had to do was put up with
them rat bags for two more days,

788
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:34,889
then it was
off to freedom.

789
01:03:46,011 --> 01:03:48,251
Uh, begging your pardon
on this,

790
01:03:48,331 --> 01:03:50,571
can any of you
good people tell me...

791
01:03:50,651 --> 01:03:53,932
where Mr. Peter Wilks
lives?

792
01:03:54,012 --> 01:03:55,852
I'm looking for
Mr. Peter Wilks.

793
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,692
Get out of the way,
for heaven's sake.

794
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:06,493
Peter's brothers,
right?

795
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:08,614
Uh, heh-heh-heh.

796
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:11,774
- I can tell by your fancy accent.
- But we're sorry to say...

797
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:14,654
we can only tell you
where Peter did live...

798
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:17,055
up until yesterday.

799
01:04:17,135 --> 01:04:20,255
Oh. What you're
tellin' me, I think,

800
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:23,816
is that my dear,
sweet brother Peter...

801
01:04:23,936 --> 01:04:25,856
has gone to the Lord.

802
01:04:25,976 --> 01:04:29,896
He held on for you as long as he could,
but yesterday he passed.

803
01:04:33,777 --> 01:04:36,097
And we came all the way from England.

804
01:04:36,177 --> 01:04:39,698
Alas. Alas.

805
01:04:39,778 --> 01:04:43,578
And we never got to see him.

806
01:04:44,658 --> 01:04:46,498
Excuse me.

807
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:50,459
I must communicate
with me deaf brother.

808
01:05:09,941 --> 01:05:13,182
- I told you before, she's my woman!
- No, she's not!

809
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:28,704
Hey, don't I know you two?

810
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,344
Yeah, I do!
You're that...

811
01:05:31,464 --> 01:05:33,504
Stand aside!

812
01:05:38,905 --> 01:05:41,505
Welcome to America!

813
01:05:59,908 --> 01:06:03,588
My dear, sweet Mary Jane.

814
01:06:04,748 --> 01:06:06,788
- Uncle Harvey.
- Ho-ho-ho!

815
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:10,309
Mmm, mmm...

816
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:14,029
Enough. Heh-heh.

817
01:06:14,109 --> 01:06:18,590
Ah, you're as bloomin' beautiful
as Peter said you was.

818
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,910
- You sure are.
- Ha ha ha!

819
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:24,791
This is my,
uh, valet, Adolphus.

820
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:27,711
My English valet,
right?

821
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:29,871
Right, right. Heh.

822
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:34,312
- Isn't he the sweetest looking boy?
- Why, thank you, missus!

823
01:06:34,432 --> 01:06:36,992
Heh-heh.
Oh, and this is my Swahili warrior...

824
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:41,073
I picked up in Africa
on a safari with the Duke of York.

825
01:06:41,153 --> 01:06:43,313
He makes a great slave.

826
01:06:51,314 --> 01:06:54,394
Yeah. Yes, of course.

827
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:57,075
Er, might we, uh,

828
01:06:57,155 --> 01:07:00,755
pay our respects
to our brother's remainders?

829
01:07:22,598 --> 01:07:25,998
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Rather, William.

830
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:28,639
Uh, my brother says...

831
01:07:28,759 --> 01:07:31,959
he'd like to invite friends
of the family for supper,

832
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,040
people mentioned by our dear Peter
so often in his letters.

833
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,560
- No, I won't forget...
- You know, we might just prosper...

834
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,361
hanging around with them two.

835
01:07:42,481 --> 01:07:45,681
More than likely,
we'll get our necks stretched.

836
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:49,601
Well, that old King
juiced it plenty,

837
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:53,322
spittin' out word-for-word everything
that young flathead told him.

838
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:56,122
And how's that
damn dog next door?

839
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:58,403
Smelly as the dickens.

840
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:00,883
Oh, thank ya ever so.

841
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:02,843
So I says to the pope,

842
01:08:02,923 --> 01:08:05,563
" Pope, I'd like to
stay and help ya,

843
01:08:05,643 --> 01:08:07,564
but I've got a
blinkin' job to do...

844
01:08:07,644 --> 01:08:10,644
down in the bloomin' Indian Ocean
savin' the blinkin' pirates."

845
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:17,965
Watch yourself, Huck.

846
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:19,965
She's just a girl, Jim.

847
01:08:20,045 --> 01:08:22,966
Adolphus, have you
ever seen the king?

848
01:08:23,086 --> 01:08:26,966
- Him? Oh, yeah. William III.
- George IV.

849
01:08:27,086 --> 01:08:29,606
Oh, the King of England!

850
01:08:29,727 --> 01:08:33,207
Oh, why didn't you bloody say so?
Course I have.

851
01:08:33,327 --> 01:08:35,727
He goes to our church, regular.

852
01:08:35,807 --> 01:08:38,248
But I thought he lived in London.

853
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,888
- Well, he does.
- But you live in Sheffield.

854
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:44,248
That is to say...

855
01:08:44,368 --> 01:08:46,809
he goes to our church
when he's in Sheffield.

856
01:08:48,129 --> 01:08:50,169
Do you go to church?

857
01:08:50,289 --> 01:08:53,169
Of course I do.
We got our own pew right up front.

858
01:08:53,249 --> 01:08:57,450
- Whose pew? - Why, ours.
Your Uncle Harvey's, of course.

859
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:01,050
What would he need a pew for?
Isn't he preaching up in the pulpit?

860
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:07,371
My thoughts exactly.
Now, do you suppose...

861
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:10,812
there ain't but one bloody, blinkin'
preacher to a bloomin' church?

862
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:14,732
- What would they want more for?
- Style.

863
01:09:14,852 --> 01:09:16,652
If it's a priest before a king,

864
01:09:16,772 --> 01:09:18,653
you got to have
lots of style goin' on.

865
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:20,613
In our church,

866
01:09:20,733 --> 01:09:24,453
we've got 17 bloody, blinkin',
bloomin' preachers.

867
01:09:24,573 --> 01:09:27,654
- Where's Buckingham Palace?
- In Buckingham.

868
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:30,414
- Who's the King married to?
- His wife. - What's her name?

869
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:33,295
- Uh, the queen. - Queen
what? - Queen of England.

870
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:36,615
Ha! You don't know anything, do ya?
Well, I think...

871
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:38,535
-you're the biggest fibber...
-Susan!

872
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:41,296
How dare you
speak to him so,

873
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,656
him being a stranger
in a strange land,

874
01:09:43,736 --> 01:09:45,696
so far from his own people.

875
01:09:45,856 --> 01:09:49,697
He was telling a few stretchers,
and I wasn't swallowing them.

876
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:52,257
You apologize to him
this instant.

877
01:09:56,097 --> 01:10:00,298
I apologize, Adolphus.
You're a dear, sweet boy.

878
01:10:00,378 --> 01:10:03,018
I'm ashamed
I called you a fibber.

879
01:10:06,499 --> 01:10:09,659
- Women.
- Here, now, have some pie and milk,

880
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:14,820
- because you are so sweet.
- Why, thank you ever so.

881
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,261
And these are the girls
we're lettin' those reptiles...

882
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:23,181
rob of their money.

883
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:28,702
- A right good day, Mary Jane!
- Good day to you, Adolphus.

884
01:10:28,782 --> 01:10:30,622
Ah, we've just been...

885
01:10:30,702 --> 01:10:32,662
for a marvelous walk in the woods.

886
01:10:32,782 --> 01:10:35,022
What a lovely country!
Ha-ha-ha!

887
01:10:35,102 --> 01:10:36,983
A right good day, sirs!

888
01:10:37,103 --> 01:10:38,903
Would you happen to know where the...

889
01:10:39,023 --> 01:10:40,943
the great Swahili
warrior's sleepin'?

890
01:10:41,063 --> 01:10:45,264
We decided the Swahili bit was pushing
it and asked him to wait at the raft.

891
01:10:45,344 --> 01:10:47,304
Well, what about...

892
01:10:47,424 --> 01:10:49,264
- A good lad!
- Here it is, Uncle.

893
01:10:49,344 --> 01:10:51,304
Father said only you
should open it.

894
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:53,985
Oh. Bless him.

895
01:10:56,145 --> 01:11:00,506
" Last Will and Testament
of Peter J. Wilks.

896
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:03,386
I, Peter J. Wilks,
being of sound mind..."

897
01:11:03,506 --> 01:11:05,986
Well, the dead
geezer gave the girls his houses,

898
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:08,987
the slaves, and thousands
of dollars in gold.

899
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:10,907
Then he gave more gold...

900
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:15,507
"to my dear, beloved brothers
Harvey and William."

901
01:11:15,627 --> 01:11:20,188
Praise be to the Lord.

902
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:25,829
Er, "The gold is hidden in the barn
behind the vineyards."

903
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:29,589
Well, William, I guess we better
go and get it.

904
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,630
- Well?
- Well?

905
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:40,031
There, behind the grindstone.

906
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:00,713
Aah! Allow me.

907
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:07,074
Wow!

908
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:16,595
Begging your pardon!
Hmph!

909
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:19,155
If this ain't bully, nothing is.

910
01:12:19,275 --> 01:12:21,116
Like I told you this morning,

911
01:12:21,196 --> 01:12:23,356
we're goin' all the way
with this one.

912
01:12:23,436 --> 01:12:26,156
All for us and none for them.
Let's count it.

913
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:33,917
I don't think it's right, us stealin
from them nice girls.

914
01:12:36,558 --> 01:12:39,398
You're in it now,
you little stinkweed.

915
01:12:39,518 --> 01:12:42,838
- Right up to your sneaky little eyeballs.
-And if it goes wrong...

916
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,119
You'll take your punishment
right along with us.

917
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,879
Ya know what they'll
do if they catch us?

918
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:50,959
Ya know what happens to ya
when they tar and feather ya?

919
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:53,440
- Do ya?
- No, sirs!

920
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,800
No, I... I don't know!

921
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,361
The tar oozes into your pores.

922
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:03,201
Clogs 'em up real tight.

923
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:06,881
- Suffocates your skin.
- Ya get all green and sick.

924
01:13:07,001 --> 01:13:09,122
Then ya choke and ya cough.

925
01:13:09,202 --> 01:13:11,642
Until ya tear your own flesh
so's ya can breathe.

926
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,922
But ya can't breathe!

927
01:13:14,002 --> 01:13:16,923
And half the time,
ya die from it.

928
01:13:17,043 --> 01:13:18,923
And those
that don't die...

929
01:13:19,043 --> 01:13:20,843
feel so bad,
they wish that they had.

930
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:24,284
And that's just what'll happen to you
if ya open your mouth.

931
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:28,724
Hey.

932
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:32,325
Maybe young Adolphus here
has the right idea.

933
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:35,325
We should give the money
back to the girls.

934
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,846
That's a dazzling idea, King.

935
01:13:39,926 --> 01:13:42,846
- That'll knock over their suspicions.
- Shut 'em up for good.

936
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:45,526
- Until we steal it all back.
- Yeah, we give them the money...

937
01:13:45,606 --> 01:13:49,367
and that gives us the time
to steal everything else.

938
01:13:49,447 --> 01:13:52,007
Genius.

939
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,247
We're gonna be set for life!

940
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:58,088
I'd had enough,
and steamboat or no steamboat,

941
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:00,328
I figured it were time
to grab Jim...

942
01:14:00,448 --> 01:14:02,849
and hightail it to Cairo.

943
01:14:06,169 --> 01:14:10,009
Heh-heh. Friends,
our dear departed...

944
01:14:10,089 --> 01:14:13,130
has done generous
to his little lambs,

945
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,330
and as their uncles,

946
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:19,051
I think we'd
like to enhance...

947
01:14:19,131 --> 01:14:22,171
the generous spirit
of the day.

948
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:33,132
You see, I knew he'd
feel the same as me.

949
01:14:33,212 --> 01:14:37,133
Mary Jane, Julia, Susan,

950
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:39,053
take the money.

951
01:14:39,173 --> 01:14:41,973
Take it all.
A gift from your uncles.

952
01:14:42,093 --> 01:14:45,774
- Wonderful!
- Dear souls, how could you?

953
01:14:45,894 --> 01:14:48,774
Englishman, my butt!

954
01:14:48,894 --> 01:14:50,735
You're a couple of frauds.

955
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:53,255
I beg your pardon.
And who might you be?

956
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:56,495
Dr. Robinson, ain't you heard?
They're Peter's brothers.

957
01:14:56,575 --> 01:15:01,016
Doctor...
Dr. Robinson! Oh!

958
01:15:01,136 --> 01:15:04,336
My brother's, oh, good friend
and physician.

959
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:07,057
Take your hand away from me,
you impostor!

960
01:15:07,137 --> 01:15:09,457
They proved it 40 ways
that they're the brothers.

961
01:15:09,577 --> 01:15:12,777
- They even knew everything about
the village! - And everybody's name!

962
01:15:12,897 --> 01:15:15,738
- They even know about the damn
dog next door. - Enough!

963
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:17,818
They came here
with lots of names and facts...

964
01:15:17,938 --> 01:15:20,658
they must've picked up
somewhere, that's all.

965
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:23,099
Yup,
it was time to leave, all right.

966
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:26,259
I could smell the winds a-changin',
and they stunk.

967
01:15:26,339 --> 01:15:28,219
Turn these rascals out,
I beg you.

968
01:15:28,339 --> 01:15:30,780
They're liars.

969
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,780
Based on what evidence?

970
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:41,021
Here's my answer, doctor.

971
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:45,661
Uncle Harvey, Uncle William,

972
01:15:45,781 --> 01:15:48,502
take the gold back...

973
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:51,262
and invest it for me
and my sisters any way you want.

974
01:15:51,382 --> 01:15:54,263
That's my answer, doctor.

975
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,423
Whooo!

976
01:15:59,703 --> 01:16:01,543
Marvellous.

977
01:16:03,344 --> 01:16:06,224
I hated to run out
on them sweet girls,

978
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:08,184
but I figured
if I stuck around,

979
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:10,865
that dead geezer 'n'me
would be sharin' lodgin's.

980
01:16:12,665 --> 01:16:16,545
Hey, you seen a big slave around,
maybe hangin' on my raft?

981
01:16:16,665 --> 01:16:19,786
You bet I was. Two men catched him,
and now he's in jail.

982
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:22,106
- What?
- They had a handbill...

983
01:16:22,186 --> 01:16:24,506
that said he was a murderer
and a runaway...

984
01:16:24,586 --> 01:16:26,787
- and worth $400.
- So where is he now?

985
01:16:26,907 --> 01:16:29,227
Took him down
to the jail in Phelps Landing.

986
01:16:29,307 --> 01:16:32,107
- Phelps Landing.
- Yeah, we're gonna keep him there...

987
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:35,508
until we can take him up north
for the hangin'.

988
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:42,149
I'm gonna fix their wagons
but good.

989
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:45,189
I'd come all the way
down the Mississippi...

990
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,109
and hadn't gotten anywhere,

991
01:16:47,229 --> 01:16:50,670
and I realized right then that ya
can't run away from your problems,

992
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,750
ya gotta make a stand
and face 'em.

993
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:55,590
I didn't tell 'em nothin'.
I didn't want to get you in any trouble.

994
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:57,591
Good,
because my butt's hangin' way out,

995
01:16:57,711 --> 01:17:00,031
and I'd rather
not get it shot off.

996
01:17:00,151 --> 01:17:01,951
I got to tell 'em
you're not a murderer.

997
01:17:02,071 --> 01:17:03,871
That don't matter.

998
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:06,752
Me bein' a runaway's even worse
than me bein' a murderer.

999
01:17:06,832 --> 01:17:10,272
The steamboat leaves the wharf
at 10:00 tomorrow tonight.

1000
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:13,473
Don't you worry, Jim.
We'll both be on it.

1001
01:17:13,553 --> 01:17:17,153
There's something I got to tell ya
before you risking yourself for me.

1002
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:20,153
You know that night on the steamboat
with all them murderers?

1003
01:17:20,273 --> 01:17:23,154
Yeah.

1004
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:25,834
Your Pap was one of 'em.

1005
01:17:25,954 --> 01:17:29,115
I saw him, and he was dead.

1006
01:17:32,755 --> 01:17:35,155
Dead?

1007
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:37,196
Pap's dead?

1008
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:42,276
- You saw him and you didn't tell me?
- I'm sorry.

1009
01:17:43,556 --> 01:17:46,317
I'm dreadful sorry.
I was so selfish.

1010
01:17:46,437 --> 01:17:48,237
That was a lie, Jim.

1011
01:17:48,357 --> 01:17:50,797
That was a lie!

1012
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,638
And I thought we were friends.

1013
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:56,678
I did wrong.
Ain't no gettin' around it.

1014
01:17:58,718 --> 01:18:00,518
Now I'm gonna get
what I deserve.

1015
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:04,439
- Hey, boy!
- Take care of yourself, Mr. Finn.

1016
01:18:25,722 --> 01:18:28,042
Now, where have you been,
you little turd pie?

1017
01:18:28,122 --> 01:18:30,762
just playin' with
the damn dog next door.

1018
01:18:30,882 --> 01:18:33,403
Just playing with the little doggies?
I oughta...

1019
01:18:33,483 --> 01:18:35,883
Just stay right here today!
Understand? Hmm?

1020
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,803
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

1021
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:42,284
What's that
old fool up to now?

1022
01:18:42,404 --> 01:18:46,724
Me dear brother and I have a little
announcement we'd like to make.

1023
01:18:46,844 --> 01:18:49,365
It don't seem right...

1024
01:18:49,485 --> 01:18:54,925
for William and I to leave
these little lambs...

1025
01:18:55,005 --> 01:18:57,646
without any kinfolk around.

1026
01:18:57,726 --> 01:19:00,166
So we have decided,

1027
01:19:00,286 --> 01:19:04,247
er, Mary Jane,
Julia, Susan...

1028
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:08,647
We have decided...

1029
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:11,287
to take you back
with us to England!

1030
01:19:14,368 --> 01:19:16,888
We'll be havin' an auction
tomorrow mornin'...

1031
01:19:17,008 --> 01:19:18,888
after the funeral,

1032
01:19:19,008 --> 01:19:22,409
- so tell one and all!
- We will be selling everything!

1033
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:24,369
We're going to England!

1034
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:35,450
I figured that
before I took off,

1035
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,291
I'd grab that gold
away from them two frauds.

1036
01:19:38,411 --> 01:19:40,411
Then when I was long gone,

1037
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:43,051
I'd write Mary Jane
and tell her where I hid it.

1038
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:01,374
Well, what is it?
Make it quick.

1039
01:20:01,494 --> 01:20:04,814
I gotta tell ya, King,
I'm just not comfortable.

1040
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:07,575
That doctor's been layin'
on my mind all day.

1041
01:20:07,655 --> 01:20:11,255
We should just glide out
of here tonight with what we got.

1042
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:13,175
And not sell the rest
of the property?

1043
01:20:13,295 --> 01:20:15,696
I reckon these sacks of gold
are plenty for me.

1044
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:18,136
I figure we should just
knock off and light out.

1045
01:20:18,216 --> 01:20:21,136
We can't leave thousands of
dollars worth of property lying around.

1046
01:20:21,256 --> 01:20:23,777
What about
the damn doctor?

1047
01:20:23,897 --> 01:20:26,937
Forget about the doctor!
He's the only one that's suspicious.

1048
01:20:27,017 --> 01:20:28,817
Everyone else
is on our side!

1049
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:30,937
Now, look, Duke, old friend.

1050
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:33,338
My brains and your bullocks,

1051
01:20:33,418 --> 01:20:35,378
we ain't never
gonna get caught.

1052
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:38,298
Yeah, all right.

1053
01:20:38,378 --> 01:20:41,179
Well, just let me
take another peek at that gold...

1054
01:20:41,259 --> 01:20:43,379
before we head back down.

1055
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,741
Slice of heaven, King.
Feels like a slice of heaven.

1056
01:20:56,861 --> 01:20:59,061
Come on!

1057
01:21:27,905 --> 01:21:30,945
My Pap were a bad one,

1058
01:21:31,025 --> 01:21:32,825
but he were my Pap.

1059
01:21:35,906 --> 01:21:38,266
If you see him,

1060
01:21:38,386 --> 01:21:41,026
tell him Huck says hello.

1061
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,147
Good night!

1062
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:47,195
Where's the stiff?

1063
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:50,155
- What? Who?
- The coffin! Where's the coffin?

1064
01:22:50,235 --> 01:22:52,075
We buried him this morning.

1065
01:22:52,195 --> 01:22:55,476
And ever since, Uncle Harvey's
been having the auction.

1066
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,636
First thing he sold
were the slaves.

1067
01:22:58,756 --> 01:23:00,916
He separated the families.

1068
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:04,237
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

1069
01:23:04,357 --> 01:23:07,837
- Got any friends out in the country?
- Yes, the Lothrups. Why?

1070
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:11,118
If I tell you somethin', promise not to
come back here until 10:00 tonight.

1071
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,078
- Now, why would I do that?
-Just promise me, Mary Jane!

1072
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:16,278
All right, I...
I promise. Say...

1073
01:23:16,398 --> 01:23:18,599
what happened
to your accent?

1074
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,799
Those uncles of yours
ain't no uncles at all.

1075
01:23:22,919 --> 01:23:25,239
They ain't even English.

1076
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:29,720
Dr. Robinson was right.
Them two are liars and frauds.

1077
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,920
- What?
- Don't you worry! I got the gold.

1078
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,241
When this all blows over, I'll write
and tell ya where it's buried.

1079
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:39,441
Oh, no. I'm gonna get those two
right now and get 'em tarred...

1080
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:43,602
No, you're not, Mary Jane.
You promised me.

1081
01:23:43,682 --> 01:23:46,522
Why until 10:00?

1082
01:23:46,642 --> 01:23:49,963
'Cause there's a good-hearted fellow
I gotta save,

1083
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,803
and at 10:00, we'll be gone.
Come on.

1084
01:23:52,883 --> 01:23:54,803
Well, why do I have
to leave town?

1085
01:23:54,883 --> 01:23:57,323
Why can't I just pretend
I don't know?

1086
01:23:57,443 --> 01:24:00,164
Because there ain't an easier book
to read than your face.

1087
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:02,404
You'd give it away
for sure.

1088
01:24:07,525 --> 01:24:09,445
Even $225... $225...

1089
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:12,605
$225... $240... $275...

1090
01:24:12,725 --> 01:24:15,126
$300... now higher...

1091
01:24:15,246 --> 01:24:17,166
- $350.
- $375... $375...

1092
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:19,126
- Yeah.
- $375 and a $400.

1093
01:24:19,206 --> 01:24:22,927
Even $400. Sold, $400!
Let's sell the next lot.

1094
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:30,888
Mary Jane
was safe, the gold was safe,

1095
01:24:30,968 --> 01:24:33,688
them reptiles
would soon be in jail,

1096
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:37,048
and at 10.00 tonight, Jim and me
would be on a steamboat...

1097
01:24:37,129 --> 01:24:39,089
headin' for Cairo.

1098
01:24:39,209 --> 01:24:42,009
All I had to do
was find that deputy,

1099
01:24:42,089 --> 01:24:44,929
steal his keys,
and break Jim oouut!

1100
01:24:45,049 --> 01:24:46,850
- Oh, I told you...
- Let me go!

1101
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:49,810
- not to disappear! Didn't I?
- Let me go!

1102
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:54,491
Oh, now,
don't kill him...just yet.

1103
01:24:54,571 --> 01:24:56,731
Answer up, and quick.

1104
01:24:56,811 --> 01:25:00,331
- Were you in our room last night?
- No, your maj... Unh!

1105
01:25:00,411 --> 01:25:02,252
Where is our money?

1106
01:25:02,332 --> 01:25:05,252
I ain't seen it since
Mary Jane gave it to ya.

1107
01:25:05,372 --> 01:25:09,333
Honest, your majesties!
If I stole it, would I still be here?

1108
01:25:09,453 --> 01:25:11,693
No, I guess not,
unless you're a complete numskull.

1109
01:25:21,174 --> 01:25:23,094
Uh-oh.

1110
01:25:23,214 --> 01:25:26,495
Here's another
set of Wilks brothers!

1111
01:25:26,615 --> 01:25:29,695
Just got here on
the Mississippi Queen!

1112
01:25:29,775 --> 01:25:32,776
Ya pays your money
and ya takes your pick!

1113
01:25:32,896 --> 01:25:35,936
Now is the hour of
your demise, you impostors!

1114
01:25:37,976 --> 01:25:40,416
What's this all about,
my good sir?

1115
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:43,937
- Please let the man through!
- That's right!

1116
01:25:44,057 --> 01:25:46,457
I'm with you, Harvey.

1117
01:25:46,577 --> 01:25:49,898
I am Harvey Wilks,
and this is my brother William.

1118
01:25:50,018 --> 01:25:53,378
And you two gentlemen
are quite a surprise to us.

1119
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:55,298
And you to us, sir.

1120
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:57,219
But I must say,

1121
01:25:57,339 --> 01:26:01,059
you should have worked on your
English accent a wee bit more!

1122
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:03,459
For this town
has few fools,

1123
01:26:03,579 --> 01:26:07,460
and only a fool would be
fooled by that foolish accent.

1124
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:10,900
That's the worst
English accent I ever heard.

1125
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:14,381
- Ain't nothin' like yours, Harve.
- I'm not very well fixed...

1126
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:16,301
to show proof of
these frauds at the moment,

1127
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,901
for last night,
all our bags were put off by mistake.

1128
01:26:20,021 --> 01:26:23,102
- Convenient mistake, huh?
- Yeah, convenient.

1129
01:26:31,743 --> 01:26:34,543
What are you doing?
What's he doing?

1130
01:26:34,663 --> 01:26:37,544
Making deaf and dumb signs,
that's what he's doing.

1131
01:26:37,664 --> 01:26:40,584
- Don't your brother know how?
- Those are just nonsense!

1132
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:42,784
And of course William
can do real ones,

1133
01:26:42,904 --> 01:26:45,385
only he broke
his arm in a fall.

1134
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:48,425
Ah-ha-ha!
Broke his arm, very likely,

1135
01:26:48,545 --> 01:26:51,946
for a man who's got to make
deaf signs to prove himself.

1136
01:26:52,066 --> 01:26:55,186
Oh, wait,
wait, wait!

1137
01:26:55,306 --> 01:26:58,986
Now, I'm not sure these two
are the real Wilks brothers,

1138
01:26:59,066 --> 01:27:01,187
but by God, I know
them two sure ain't.

1139
01:27:02,587 --> 01:27:05,307
By the way, Adolphus,

1140
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:09,068
- are you from England?
- Why, yes, I am.

1141
01:27:09,148 --> 01:27:10,988
Speak the truth now,

1142
01:27:11,068 --> 01:27:14,028
or by God, there's gonna be
one less idiot around here.

1143
01:27:14,148 --> 01:27:16,589
That is to say, sir,

1144
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:18,509
I'm originally from Missouri,

1145
01:27:18,629 --> 01:27:20,909
but several years ago,
I was sent to England...

1146
01:27:21,029 --> 01:27:23,029
to live with
my great-grandfather,

1147
01:27:23,149 --> 01:27:26,350
- the Duke of Bilgewater.
- Bilgewater?

1148
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:28,630
But he died last year,

1149
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,110
and his good friend,

1150
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:34,191
Mr. Harvey Wilks here,
took me in.

1151
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:39,191
Personally, I think
you're just a damn good liar.

1152
01:27:39,311 --> 01:27:41,352
Why, thank you for
the compliment, sir.

1153
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:46,032
All right, enough.

1154
01:27:46,112 --> 01:27:48,953
We're gonna figure out
who's who right here and now,

1155
01:27:49,073 --> 01:27:53,273
and nobody's goin' nowhere
until we do.

1156
01:27:56,234 --> 01:27:59,314
Well, they sailed
into the investigation,

1157
01:27:59,434 --> 01:28:01,234
hour in and hour out,

1158
01:28:01,354 --> 01:28:03,395
the King tellin'
one story and Harvey Wilks another.

1159
01:28:03,475 --> 01:28:05,995
But no one knew nothin'
about England,

1160
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:08,435
so they couldn't
figure out who was lyin'.

1161
01:28:08,555 --> 01:28:10,635
Although most people were comin'
to believe they both was.

1162
01:28:10,755 --> 01:28:12,636
I got it! I got it!

1163
01:28:12,756 --> 01:28:15,476
I can prove I'm Harvey Wilks
and these men frauds!

1164
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,156
Why didn't I think
of it sooner?

1165
01:28:18,276 --> 01:28:20,637
Now, who here
helped lay out my brother...

1166
01:28:20,757 --> 01:28:25,237
- the late Peter Wilks... in his
coffin? Hmm? - They did!

1167
01:28:25,357 --> 01:28:28,518
Me and Abe here dressed him up
and layed him out ourselves.

1168
01:28:28,598 --> 01:28:30,438
All right, then.

1169
01:28:30,518 --> 01:28:35,639
Perhaps you can tell me what was
tattooed on Peter's breast.

1170
01:28:35,719 --> 01:28:38,239
Come on!

1171
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:40,799
Come on, out with it!

1172
01:28:40,919 --> 01:28:42,879
We want to hear it!

1173
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,080
- Out with it!
- Yeah!

1174
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,000
All right, all right.

1175
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,200
I can tell you what was tattooed
on his breast, all right.

1176
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:53,241
You'd have to look
real close to notice it.

1177
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,801
Just tell us
what the tattoo is about!

1178
01:28:55,921 --> 01:28:58,041
Come on, out with it!
Tell him!

1179
01:28:58,161 --> 01:29:00,762
- Come on!
- Get to it!

1180
01:29:00,842 --> 01:29:04,002
It was a small...

1181
01:29:04,122 --> 01:29:06,883
thin...

1182
01:29:07,003 --> 01:29:08,803
blue...

1183
01:29:13,323 --> 01:29:15,284
- arrow!
- Arrow?

1184
01:29:15,404 --> 01:29:19,644
- Yes! There! You all heard what he said?
- Yeah!

1185
01:29:19,764 --> 01:29:22,004
Did you see any such mark?

1186
01:29:25,845 --> 01:29:28,125
- Nope.
- Nope.

1187
01:29:28,245 --> 01:29:30,165
You fraud!

1188
01:29:34,446 --> 01:29:38,246
That's right, because
there isn't any blue arrow.

1189
01:29:38,366 --> 01:29:41,207
Peter had his initials
tattooed on his breast,

1190
01:29:41,327 --> 01:29:43,167
the letters " P" and "W".

1191
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:45,407
Well, come on, then!

1192
01:29:45,487 --> 01:29:48,328
Isn't that what you saw?

1193
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:50,248
I didn't see
any tattoo, did you?

1194
01:29:50,368 --> 01:29:53,408
I never noticed
no tattoo at all!

1195
01:29:53,528 --> 01:29:55,689
They're all frauds!

1196
01:29:57,249 --> 01:29:59,809
- I say we tar 'em!
- Yeah!

1197
01:29:59,929 --> 01:30:02,249
- I say we shoot 'em!
- Yeah!

1198
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:04,770
- I say we hang 'em!
- Yeah!

1199
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:06,770
Hang 'em!
Hang all of 'em!

1200
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:10,331
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

1201
01:30:10,451 --> 01:30:13,731
There is one way to see which pair
is the real Wilks brothers,

1202
01:30:13,811 --> 01:30:15,811
or if neither of them is!

1203
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:18,011
Let's dig up the corpse!

1204
01:30:18,132 --> 01:30:20,292
Yeah!

1205
01:30:23,652 --> 01:30:25,732
To the cemetery!

1206
01:30:43,135 --> 01:30:44,935
We've got the tar!

1207
01:31:33,021 --> 01:31:34,861
Well?

1208
01:31:34,941 --> 01:31:36,741
Dig it up!

1209
01:32:01,905 --> 01:32:05,105
- Hey, we found it, doc!
- They hit it!

1210
01:32:08,465 --> 01:32:11,386
All right, heave!

1211
01:32:16,866 --> 01:32:18,667
Won't be long now,
Deputy Hines!

1212
01:32:22,987 --> 01:32:26,028
- Push it! Push it!
- Got it?

1213
01:32:27,348 --> 01:32:30,228
- Almost got it!
Push!

1214
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:36,029
- Eeewwhh!
- Oh!

1215
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:46,550
My good God!
There's gold in there!

1216
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,510
Aah!

1217
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:53,231
It's the Wilks' gold!

1218
01:32:57,752 --> 01:32:59,552
We'd best be goin', Jim!

1219
01:32:59,672 --> 01:33:03,152
Huck? I thought you'd have
your neck stretched by now!

1220
01:33:03,272 --> 01:33:05,833
I'm a little quicker
than that.

1221
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:08,513
- Why, Huck?
- Why, what?

1222
01:33:08,633 --> 01:33:11,353
Why'd ya come and get me?

1223
01:33:11,473 --> 01:33:13,834
'Cause you're my friend, Jim.

1224
01:33:15,914 --> 01:33:18,514
Oh, come on.

1225
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:22,275
Now, let's get
to that steamboat!

1226
01:33:48,638 --> 01:33:52,559
- Come on!
- It's the boy with that runaway slave!

1227
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,679
- Hit the trail!
- Get 'em!

1228
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,520
Fire!

1229
01:34:12,281 --> 01:34:14,081
Aah! Unh!

1230
01:34:15,161 --> 01:34:16,962
You all right, Huck?

1231
01:34:17,082 --> 01:34:20,242
I just tripped. I'm all right.
Keep goin'!

1232
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:23,402
Unh! Unh!

1233
01:34:23,522 --> 01:34:26,363
Last call for Cairo
and all points north!

1234
01:34:26,483 --> 01:34:28,363
All aboard!

1235
01:34:28,483 --> 01:34:30,283
Almost there, Huck!

1236
01:34:36,084 --> 01:34:39,885
We made it, Huck!
Huck?

1237
01:34:40,005 --> 01:34:43,485
Oh! Oh, my little friend!

1238
01:34:43,605 --> 01:34:45,565
Oh. Oh.

1239
01:34:45,685 --> 01:34:48,606
- Go on, Jim. Go on.
- I ain't goin' nowhere without you.

1240
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:52,126
- What are ya doin',Jim?
They'll catch ya.

1241
01:34:52,246 --> 01:34:54,086
They won't find ya
in the dark.

1242
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:56,007
I got to get ya to a doctor.

1243
01:34:56,087 --> 01:34:58,287
I'll be okay.
Ya...

1244
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:02,167
Ya can't take me, Jim.
They'll catch ya.

1245
01:35:02,247 --> 01:35:04,088
They'll lynch ya.

1246
01:35:04,168 --> 01:35:08,128
- Don't go, Jim.
- Last call for Cairo! Last call for Cairo!

1247
01:35:08,248 --> 01:35:11,769
- All aboard!
- I don't care what happens to me, Huck.

1248
01:35:11,849 --> 01:35:14,169
I just want
to get you well.

1249
01:35:14,249 --> 01:35:16,849
Jim...Jim...

1250
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,730
We had us
a great adventure, didn't we, Jim?

1251
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:25,610
- We sure did, Huck.
- And I'd do it all over again.

1252
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:28,531
Yeah.

1253
01:35:28,651 --> 01:35:30,651
Get 'em!

1254
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:32,651
Oh!

1255
01:35:32,771 --> 01:35:35,772
You can't...
You can't kill him.

1256
01:35:35,852 --> 01:35:39,532
Don't you cry for me,
Mr. Finn.

1257
01:35:39,612 --> 01:35:42,452
You're the best friend
I ever had, Jim.

1258
01:35:42,572 --> 01:35:44,453
You're the only friend
I ever had.

1259
01:35:45,853 --> 01:35:47,973
Ya can't.

1260
01:35:51,173 --> 01:35:53,574
Aah! No!

1261
01:35:57,374 --> 01:35:59,014
Jim!

1262
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:04,655
No, ya can't take him.

1263
01:36:04,775 --> 01:36:07,656
He's all I got.

1264
01:36:07,776 --> 01:36:09,816
Ready?

1265
01:36:13,256 --> 01:36:15,857
- Tighten it up.
- Aah! Aah!

1266
01:36:15,977 --> 01:36:18,777
Leave the boy alone! He's innocent!

1267
01:36:18,897 --> 01:36:21,737
- Now, Mary Jane!
- And if he was trying to help that slave,

1268
01:36:21,857 --> 01:36:23,698
he had a good reason for it.

1269
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:26,378
Now you let them both go!

1270
01:36:30,258 --> 01:36:33,019
Now!

1271
01:36:35,779 --> 01:36:37,619
Aw, let him go.

1272
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:42,220
Lucky day, boy!

1273
01:37:18,505 --> 01:37:20,545
You're awake.

1274
01:37:20,665 --> 01:37:23,265
He's awake.
He's awake!

1275
01:37:23,385 --> 01:37:27,346
Sweetie, we were so worried about you
but you're going to be all right now.

1276
01:37:27,466 --> 01:37:29,906
My little Huckleberry!

1277
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:34,667
Widow Douglas.
Why, how'd you get here?

1278
01:37:34,747 --> 01:37:38,227
Lands, child.
You've been out cold for a week.

1279
01:37:38,347 --> 01:37:41,627
When I heard what happened,
I took the first steamer down.

1280
01:37:41,747 --> 01:37:45,948
Well, I'm sure ya think
I'm low-down and miserable...

1281
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:49,588
for tryin'
to set Jim free,

1282
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:53,469
- but do ya hate me?
- Not at all, child.

1283
01:37:53,589 --> 01:37:58,550
I'm right proud of you. Just because
an idea is popular, like slavery,

1284
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,950
don't make it right.

1285
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:03,030
That's what Jim told me.

1286
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:06,631
Your little heart
guided you quite well.

1287
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,151
Hey, Jim!

1288
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:15,832
You lie still,
and I'll bring you some soup.

1289
01:38:20,752 --> 01:38:22,713
Well, look at you.

1290
01:38:32,354 --> 01:38:34,394
What is it, Jim?

1291
01:38:34,514 --> 01:38:36,394
Did somebody
do something to you?

1292
01:38:36,514 --> 01:38:39,355
- 'Cause if they did, why...
- Miss Watson died.

1293
01:38:43,235 --> 01:38:45,075
A few weeks ago.

1294
01:38:45,155 --> 01:38:48,756
And, well, she was so ashamed...

1295
01:38:48,836 --> 01:38:53,476
that she was going to sell me away
from my wife and my children, that...

1296
01:38:53,597 --> 01:38:56,797
she set me free
in her will, Huck.

1297
01:39:00,357 --> 01:39:02,198
I'm a free man, Huck.

1298
01:39:06,198 --> 01:39:09,599
I'm a free man.

1299
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,521
Children, come here, please.

1300
01:39:25,641 --> 01:39:28,361
- Mr. Jenkins!
- Good-bye, Adolphus Huckleberry.

1301
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:30,161
Well, I healed up just fine.

1302
01:39:30,281 --> 01:39:33,402
Mary Jane and her sisters,
along with the Wilks brothers,

1303
01:39:33,482 --> 01:39:36,682
gave me $500 for my troubles
and my chivalrousness.

1304
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:40,162
But since I got no real use
for money, I gave it all to Jim...

1305
01:39:40,282 --> 01:39:43,043
for his family.

1306
01:39:47,683 --> 01:39:49,924
The Widow Douglas
said she'd adopt me...

1307
01:39:50,044 --> 01:39:53,164
and take me home
and try and civilize me...

1308
01:39:56,044 --> 01:39:59,245
but I don't know
if I could stand it...

1309
01:40:03,565 --> 01:40:06,366
'cause I've been there before.

1310
01:40:10,566 --> 01:40:13,527
Now, where did
Huckleberry go to?
