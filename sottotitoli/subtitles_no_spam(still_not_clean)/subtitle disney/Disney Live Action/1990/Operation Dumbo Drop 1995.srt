I'm Doyle. You're my ride.

00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,440
Let's go.

9
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,509
¶ Boom, boom, boom, boom, ¶

10
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,429

11
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,631
Straight approach
to the I.Z. Is out.

12
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,867
<i>Beaucoup</i> n.V.A.

13
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,403
We're gonna have to
take the scenic route.

14
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,510
¶ Hey ¶

Old grandpa Charlie's got a 51.

He's down there every
day, hopin' and waitin'.

Bye-bye, Charlie!

57
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,400
¶ Well, I feel so good ¶

00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,467

Bad rat? Rat here no good.

75
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,841
Make people sick.

76
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,811
Stick to snake.

77
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,653
No! No, thanks.

78
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,722
You captain Doyle? Yeah.

79
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,458
I'm jhon.

80
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,893
Where's captain Cahill?

81
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,463
Up trail,

82
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,897
but you rest.

83
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,467
We eat, then go.

84
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,469
I'll wait for you at the top.

85
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,489
Try it with a 60-pound pack.

86
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,684
Not your fault, huh?

87
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,187
Not used to air up high.

88
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,160
You know captain Sam?

89
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:11,797
Uh-uh. I know of him.

90
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,832
Where I'm from,
everybody knows of him.

91
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,202
He's a legend. So where is he?

92
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,826
Cahill.

93
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,160
Sam right there.

94
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,829
Where? Which hut? Where is he?

95
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:44,863
No, no. Sam right there.

96
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,902
Cahill?

97
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:56,608
Captain Samuel Cahill,
sog/op 39?

98
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,877
Hello?

99
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,212
Stop.

100
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,700
You're the guest of honor.

101
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,936
Um...

102
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,708
Took you longer than expected.

103
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,843
We're waiting for you.

104
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,211
Have a little trouble
on the hill?

105
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,948
Um...

106
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,850
They always
have a wine ceremony

107
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,586
to celebrate the arrival
of an important visitor.

108
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,788
Of course,
they'd have a wine ceremony

109
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,690
to celebrate
the arrival of Tuesday.

110
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,928
It's numpai... rice wine.

111
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,598
And it tastes like a combination
of sugar water and vomit.

112
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,234
It's a little early in the day
to be hammered, isn't it?

113
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,838
You have to drink it.
All of it.

114
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,208
And whatever you do,
don't spit it out.

115
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,710
It's an incredible
insult to the chief.

116
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,583
If that's it,
maybe we could go...

117
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,219
not quite. You have to meet po.

118
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,721
Po. Po. Po.

119
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,956
Po. Po. Po.

120
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,958
Po? Cahill: Yeah.

121
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,926
He's a village elder or what?

122
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,927
Kind of.

123
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,629
Here he comes.

124
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,631
Don't turn around,
and close your eyes.

125
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,699
Po will wanna touch your face.

126
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,233
Excuse me?

127
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,269
You don't want to insult po.

128
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,838
It's worse than
spitting out the wine.

129
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,707
Close your eyes.

130
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,309
Close my eyes.

131
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,397
This is serious
n.V.A. Territory, captain.

132
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,199
They know the montagnard
are helping us,

133
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,333
so they come around here
all the time

134
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,969
looking for any excuse
to give 'em hell.

135
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,639
Rule number one:
Don't give them one.

136
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,340
That's why you couldn't
fly here directly...

137
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,809
why I only come here
when it's safe.

138
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,745
And rule number 2?

139
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,147
Never forget rule number one.

140
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,851
I think I can remember that.

141
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,319
I leave here Saturday.

142
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,187
That gives me a week
to get you ready.

143
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:56,955
Oh, I'm prepared, captain.

144
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,791
I can do the job.

145
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,961
And how you gonna do it?
By the book?

146
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,329
There's a better way?

147
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:13,238
Huh. Look. I got
a few things to tie up.

148
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,740
Jhon'll show you around
and answer any questions.

149
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,176
Captain, I didn't come
here for a village tour.

150
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,412
My orders are
to go to the trail.

151
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,213
You don't start
movin' the big stuff

152
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,815
until after midnight.

153
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,817
Until then, captain Doyle,

154
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,420
I suggest you start
getting to know this village.

155
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,723
These people have been the difference
between life and death for me.

156
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,704
What's that?

157
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,939
The forest gave us so much,

158
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,942
we pay tribute for protection
of the good spirits.

159
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,854
So she's not just a big pet.

160
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,857
No, no. We use elephants.

161
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,760
My father, his father,
his father, forever.

162
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,929
War drives elephants South.

163
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,265
Dak nhe lucky to have one.
Dak nhe are blessed.

164
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,334
I'm happy for you.

165
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,403
Look, let's...

166
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,873
let's go see the trail.

167
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,742
Sam say we go later.

168
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,343
Yeah, I know, but you're
gonna be working for me now.

169
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,246
Forget Sam. Where's the trail?

170
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,415
I forget.

171
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,451
Candy you got?

172
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,987
No, no. Get... no.
No candy. Get away.

173
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,323
Please. Candy. I share.

174
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,891
Kids: Candy! Candy!

175
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,993
Candy! Candy! Candy!

176
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,995
All right.
All right. All right.

177
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,431
I only have one.

178
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,267
Understand? One.

179
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,369
One... hey!

180
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,547
Oh, this is great.

181
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,915
That's it?

182
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,284
Cahill: Ho chi minh trail.

183
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,887
Disappointed? I was.

184
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,557
I expected something a
little bit more established.

185
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,526
That's the beauty of it.

186
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,261
You call in an air strike,

187
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,529
blow the heck out of it,

188
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,863
and they move it.

189
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,900
They use it
to supply an entire army.

190
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,434
It never stops.

191
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,838
Oh, look at that.

192
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,008
Shoulder-fire
surface-to-air missiles.

193
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,343
Whoa.

194
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,579
Second set of s.A. Sevens we've
seen come South this week.

195
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,580
Really?

196
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,295
You bring bad spirit!

197
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,463
It wasn't my fault!

198
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,698
D-d-Doyle!

199
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,033
It wasn't my fault!

200
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,567
The kid took the candy.

201
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,038
He stole the candy,
and then he ran off.

202
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,572
It wasn't...

203
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:46,945
ok, it was my fault.
It was my fault.

204
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,013
I'm sorry about the elephant.

205
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,683
If I could bring him
back to life, I would.

206
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,385
We no want you. You go!

207
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,887
No, wait. Fine!

208
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,388
I never intended to work with
these people in the first place.

209
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,489
Maybe you can!

210
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,958
Maybe I can what?!

211
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,593
The tradition here is
that at high noon

212
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,695
on the last day of wapasat,

213
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,496
the new moon festival,

214
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:09,033
the king of fire enters on
top of the village elephant.

215
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,401
Now we have to do it by Friday.

216
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,669
That's pushin' it.

217
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,304
Wait. Do what by Friday?

218
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,041
Duan, I give you my word

219
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,044
that when the king of fire
enters the village this wapasat,

220
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,281
he will not do so
on his own feet.

221
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,583
He is going to get you
a new elephant.

222
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,690
I am not getting them
an elephant. No! No!

223
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,000
These people have risked
their lives helping us.

224
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,501
Well, then let's
get them a tractor.

225
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,502
A tractor would last
8 minutes in that big...

226
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,870
well, then don't
get them anything.

227
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,237
Oh, come on! What
are you talkin' about?!

228
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,823
You've been
in the jungle too long!

229
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:50,407
What about you?!
Will you both shut up?!

230
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:58,416
The village provides important support
for operations in the region.

231
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,419
If we don't get them an
elephant by Friday afternoon,

232
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,054
we lose the village.

233
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,756
We don't need the village.

234
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,657
It's as simple as that.

235
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,029
Well, maybe we don't
need the village,

236
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,764
but then again, maybe we do.

237
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:15,666
I think we err on the side of
caution this time, captain Doyle.

238
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,569
You two go out and
get them their elephant.

239
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,706
We'll need some men, sir.
5 should do it.

240
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,342
You get 2.

241
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:28,046
2 of the very best
and brightest I can borrow.

242
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,749
Now get outta here.

243
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,485
Whatever you do,
don't embarrass me.

244
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,787
Don't worry, sir.

245
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:40,358
Now, hold on a second.

246
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,493
Aren't we forgetting something?

247
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,063
Who's gonna lead this
delightful little operation?

248
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,664
I am. I am.

249
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,833
Well, I'm sure you both
have very good reasons.

250
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,701
The thing is,
I really don't care.

251
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,838
So odds or evens? One.

252
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,843
Evens. 2...3.

253
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,512
Marvin gaye:
¶ youse a son of a gun ¶

254
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,247
¶ oh, baby ¶

255
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,615
¶ youse a son of a gun ¶

256
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,317
spec-4 ashford?

257
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,819
No, sir. He's in the hooch.

258
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,423
Ashford!

259
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,425
Haul your butt out here!

260
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,361
Sir? He ain't comin' out.

261
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,767
Why is that, red?

262
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,802
Well, he's short 7 days.

263
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,704
Goes back to the world
next Monday.

264
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,707
This man is taking no chances.

265
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,609
He ain't even come out
of his hooch for 2 days.

266
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,482
Troop.

267
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,785
Grenade!

268
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,386
Oh, that's really funny.

269
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,548
Who's the hilarious son of a...

270
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,362
my mistake.

271
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,606
Pack your gear

272
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,708
and be ready to move out
at 1300 hours.

273
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,344
You've been reassigned.

274
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,546
This is
some kind of joke, right?

275
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,781
It's a joke, all right.

276
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,517
You can't reassign me.

277
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,387
Sir, I'm catching the
freedom bird in 7 days.

278
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,425
168 hours.

279
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,861
I'm so short.

280
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,864
I'm so short...
1300 hours, ashford.

281
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,837
¶ Dang me, dang me ¶

282
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,706
¶ they ought to take
a rope and hang me ¶

283
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,643
¶ high from the highest tree ¶

284
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,512
¶ would you weep for me? ¶

285
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:51,556
Dang it. Dang it!

286
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,327
Spec-5 farley?

287
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,862
Yes, sir!

288
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,363
So what's the mission, sir?

289
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,631
Unless you can't tell me,

290
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,333
like if we're operatin'
on a need-to-know basis.

291
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,734
We are, and you don't.

292
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,370
Yes, sir.

293
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,606
Where you from, farley?

294
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,641
Iowa, sir. Or as my Uncle
Fergus liked to put it,

295
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:14,312
I owe a hell of a lot of
money on them farm loans.

296
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,781
He doesn't say much about it
since the thresher accident.

297
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,800
Mama likes to say you can
hardly tell anything happened

298
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,818
unless you get up real
close, but I beg to differ.

299
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,420
You been on a farm?

300
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,621
Yes, sir. My daddy
owns a dairy farm,

301
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,823
seein' as I bein'
from the corn state.

302
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,325
So you've had
experience with animals.

303
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,659
Yes, sir.

304
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,328
Just none of 'em good.

305
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,395
I don't know what it is.

306
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,763
Animals just
don't seem to like me.

307
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,632
Never have,
probably never will.

308
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,700
And that didn't make life
easier growin' up on a farm.

309
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,401
Tell you that.

310
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,586
Shoot, one of the main reasons

311
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:39,770
why I joined the army
in the first place.

312
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,506
Get away from
all the dang animals.

313
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:53,517
Gilman, hey, I need
25 submariners at 300 per. Ok?

314
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,823
Gilman, may I remind you
I have friends

315
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,825
with absolutely no regard for
the sanctity of human life, ok?

316
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:04,395
I say the word, I have your head in
a bag on my desk tomorrow morning.

317
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,565
Hang on. General. It's done.

318
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,534
425 per.

319
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,470
Pleasure doing business
with you, sir.

320
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,472
Yes, sir, and give my regards

321
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,806
to your lovely wife
and daughter.

322
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:19,543
I didn't mean
anything by that, sir.

323
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:20,878
I gotta go. I got a call
on the other line.

324
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,280
All right, thank you.

325
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,547
Gilman, so where were we?

326
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,650
I think
I had your head in a bag,

327
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,552
350? Done.

328
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,656
All right. Send them to general
John Richardson in danang, please.

329
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,291
Thanks, pal.

330
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,525
And, oh, by the way, gilman?

331
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,661
I'd still let somebody
taste your food.

332
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,538
I thought you were dead.

333
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,307
You mean you hoped I was dead.

334
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,376
What can I do for you guys?

335
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,778
You're a requisitions officer.

336
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,449
Well, we require something.

337
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,356
Not even funny.

338
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,458
We need an elephant
by tomorrow.

339
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Or you don't you think
you could do it?

340
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,762
Please.

341
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,564
Spare me
the I-dare-you crap, Cahill.

342
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,535
Everybody knows I can get
anything anywhere anytime.

343
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,371
Just so happens I'm
startin' 5 days of r-and-r.

344
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:24,542
This time tomorrow I'll be sittin'
on a beach in Hawaii, my friend.

345
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,577
You're getting us the elephant.

346
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,980
Or what?

347
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,382
You gonna still try to hold that
business with the 64th over my head?

348
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,651
Come on. So the pork
was a little off.

349
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,453
A little off?

350
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,489
I know men who spent a week on the
latrine because of that pork.

351
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,624
It's old news, Cahill.

352
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,892
I got too many friends
in high places

353
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,761
to go down for something
small-time like that now.

354
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:47,565
Oh, I know other things
about you, poole.

355
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,667
Let me tell you
something, Cahill.

356
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,435
There isn't anything you know

357
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,805
that's gonna keep me from gettin'
on that plane to Honolulu.

358
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,585
Doyle: 180 Miles
in the middle of a war.

359
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,387
We can get a truck and drive
it up close to dak nhe.

360
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,455
That'll take about 3 days.

361
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:12,690
And another day to walk it in.

362
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,592
We'll get there by Friday.

363
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,927
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of air travel.

364
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,696
I lined up a cargo plane

365
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,765
to meet us at an airstrip
near ban don, ok?

366
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,100
We fly the elephant down
to this old CIA airstrip

367
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,902
about a 3-hour walk
from dak nhe,

368
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,771
then your montagnard friends
have their elephant

369
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,773
by 2:00 this afternoon, I'm
sitting on the beach in waikiki

370
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,174
in time to see the sunset.

371
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:34,412
And you wanted a week!
Good job, poole!

372
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,547
We're coming up on ban don now.

373
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,483
There's no place to land
in the rice paddies.

374
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,453
We'll have to go to an I.Z.
Behind the village.

375
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,854
It was real hot here
2 weeks ago.

376
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,424
Probably ok now.

377
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,426
Probably? We're gonna
land on a "probably"?

378
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,660
Lock and load!

379
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,150
Hey, this isn't that bad.

380
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,686
It's kind of peaceful, really.

381
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,556
All right, move out.

382
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,500
Well, Cahill,
you want elephants,

383
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,602
I give you elephants.

384
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,505
Beautiful elephants, I might
add, at no extra cost.

385
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,840
Knowing you, poole,

386
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,843
they're probably big
puppets with men inside.

387
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:41,479
Let's go.

388
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,162
Y b'ham?

389
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,701
Let me handle the negotiation.

390
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,803
I already talked to
this guy on the radio.

391
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:09,840
Thinks he's tough, but I'm
gonna crack him like a walnut.

392
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,167
Oh, you're killing me.

393
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,836
What's the problem?

394
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,271
I thought you could
negotiate anything.

395
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,939
I can with leverage. Problem
is we don't have any.

396
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,707
He doesn't care if he sells
the elephant or not.

397
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,276
We don't make his price,
he blows the deal.

398
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,245
What's his price?

399
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,213
Problem number 2.
He wants 60,000 piasters.

400
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,214
The requisition form
captain Doyle gave me

401
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,248
is only good for 50, so...

402
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,784
that's it?
Hell, 10,000 piasters...

403
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,852
that's only about 150 bucks.

404
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,787
We can raise that between us.

405
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,256
No. You tell him 50,000
is our final offer.

406
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,941
We can do it.

407
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,625
Private funds can't be used
for an official purchase

408
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,728
as per regulations.
It's also an order.

409
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,231
Understood? Tell him.

410
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:13,304
I get it. It's a perfect
way out for you.

411
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,939
You blow the deal,
and the mission is over.

412
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:18,609
It's what you wanted
from the beginning.

413
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,779
We're going back to the I.Z.
And call for a ride.

414
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,847
Let's go.

415
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,183
Poole, let's move it.

416
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,285
Ok, 50,000.

417
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,727
You're quite
a negotiator, Doyle.

418
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:43,334
Gracious sir, perhaps now
we could go to the river

419
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:44,735
and pick our elephant.

420
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:47,705
River? 50,000 don't
get elephant in river.

421
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,307
50,000 get you Bo-tat.

422
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,210
Bo-tat!

423
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,314
Uh-oh.

424
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,253
Beat it.

425
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,265
Bo-tat is she, not he.

426
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,935
Boy is linh.
Boy go with Bo-tat.

427
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:21,338
What? No, boy no go
with Bo-tat.

428
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,741
Boy go with Bo-tat.

429
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,275
We're going to a village
far away.

430
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,644
I'm sure linh's family...

431
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,647
boy has no family. All killed.

432
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,881
In the war?

433
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,283
No. Hit by falling star.

434
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,920
Yes, in war.

435
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,922
Which side?

436
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,391
It matter?

437
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:43,227
I think it's better
if the boy stays here.

438
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:47,331
He not belong here.
From north, not our people.

439
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,900
We might as well
take him with us.

440
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,236
N-no. We are not
taking a kid with us.

441
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,871
He'll be my responsibility.

442
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,239
No, captain. All right.

443
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,877
Anyone else here know
how to work an elephant?

444
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,445
I was in love with
a fat woman once,

445
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,946
but she never listened to me.

446
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,984
Oh. Mr. Y b'ham,
you must know how

447
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:08,452
to work an elephant,
right, sir?

448
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,854
I live with elephants
all my life.

449
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,423
I learn nothing?

450
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:16,860
Is this guy sarcastic,
or is it just me?

451
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,705
Great. Would you like
to come with us, sir?

452
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,740
20,000 piasters.

453
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,241
Deal.

454
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,494
Good job, Doyle.

455
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:35,746
I think Mr. Y b'ham
would be a wonderful choice.

456
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,214
Just one problem.

457
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,882
What?

458
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,418
He doesn't stare into space
because he's a wise old soul.

459
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,253
He does it because
he's blind as a bat.

460
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,256
Y b'ham not blind.
Y b'ham can...

461
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,359
y b'ham is blind.

462
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,230
10,000 piasters?

463
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:10,347
Farley: It's a nice view.

464
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,415
Ashford: What nice view?

465
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,918
All I can see
is an elephant's butt.

466
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,230
<i>Parlez-vous francais?</i>

467
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,466
Any luck?

468
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,369
I tried vietnamese,
Cambodian, French,

469
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,271
and 3 dialects of jeh.

470
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,343
Keep an eye on him.

471
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,979
He's on an elephant.
He's hard to miss.

472
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:44,281
You know what I mean.

473
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,350
We don't know which side
killed his family.

474
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,452
It could've been us.
He might hate Americans.

475
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,987
We don't know, and until we do,

476
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,321
he can't be trusted. Doyle...

477
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:54,291
he right. Linh
can't be trusted.

478
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:59,997
Linh no trust Americans.
Americans not trust linh.

479
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:03,367
Everything's number one, a-ok.

480
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,524
That elephant just came along
to say good-bye, right?

481
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,893
You're not actually thinking
of putting that on my plane?

482
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:30,894
What's the problem?

483
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,430
What's the problem?

484
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,464
It's an elephant.

485
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,966
Yeah, but, major...

486
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,568
no, no, no. You see,
you cannot put an elephant

487
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,336
on an airplane.

488
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,305
Suppose it starts to panic
and starts moving around?

489
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,473
I lose trim,
the plane goes down.

490
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,008
We all buy the farm.

491
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,577
That's important,
what he just said.

492
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,245
No, no, no.

493
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,847
It's not getting
aboard the plane

494
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,281
unless it's dead.

495
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:54,451
Now, I'd be happy to oblige...

496
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:56,486
If you've all grown
too attached to it.

497
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,588
No!

498
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,590
Linh, it's ok.

499
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:02,226
No one's gonna shoot Bo-tat.

500
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,996
Doyle.

501
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,870
Poole.

502
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,371
Do you have a package

503
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,373
for a Dr. David poole,
d.V.M., on board?

504
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,941
Yeah, I do.

505
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,918
Here we go, gentlemen.
Animal tranquilizer.

506
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,387
She won't move an inch.

507
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,289
Bo-tat's gonna take
a big nap-nap.

508
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,258
Hey, nice try,
but I don't care.

509
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,593
See, my orders say nothing
about lifting an elephant.

510
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:40,297
Gentlemen, you have a good war.

511
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:45,002
Ahem, major, maybe
you should read this.

512
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,239
Ok?

513
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,474
This operation's top-secret,

514
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:51,575
and that's why
you never heard anything

515
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,010
about our large mammal
friend over there.

516
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:54,544
As a matter of fact,
if anybody asks,

517
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,014
you're moving
a shipment of tuna.

518
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,448
Tuna?

519
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,284
Tuna.

520
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:03,687
Moving an elephant.

521
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,023
What elephant?

522
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,396
You got 10 minutes.

523
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,333
Gentlemen, I'm responsible
for anything

524
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:17,601
that goes onto that cargo hold.

525
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,304
Now, if that thing
even twitches,

526
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,472
you're gonna see
an elephant fly.

527
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,309
Hey, that's funny.

528
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,446
All right, yeah.
What's with the letter?

529
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,683
John westmoreland.
Top priority.

530
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:34,484
Got 8 left.

531
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,287
Now, couldn't get
elephant tranquilizer

532
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,588
'cause the only place
that has it is the London zoo.

533
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,724
It would take too long
to ship, so...

534
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,259
And what's that?

535
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,027
Water buffalo tranquilizer.

536
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,363
It's not as strong,
but my vet guy says

537
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:49,399
you just give her a little
more, it should work.

538
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,672
My word.

539
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,041
I guess we give her one now,
and then we give her...

540
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,609
One later if she needs it.

541
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,312
How are we supposed to get her
to swallow one of these?

542
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,748
Well... ahem... actually,
according to this,

543
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,384
she's not supposed
to swallow it.

544
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:12,456
Well, Dr. David poole...

545
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,491
oh, no, no, no, no.

546
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,293
I said I would
help you guys out,

547
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,028
but putting my hand
up an elephant's ass

548
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,297
was never part of the deal, no.

549
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,465
On 3?

550
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,668
Oh... No.

551
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,504
Please, please, please, please.
Ok, what do you have?

552
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,605
Evens. Ok.

553
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,606
1, 2, 3...

554
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:31,775
Oh.

555
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,610
Heh heh heh heh.

556
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,416
Doyle: Don't you move,
you big suitcase.

557
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,622
Oh, that's horrible.

558
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,593
You weird.

559
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,463
Good thinking, poole.

560
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,033
Well, come on, let's go.

561
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:59,770
Let's get her on the plane
before this stuff kicks in.

562
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:01,505
Come on, come on.

563
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,040
Linh thought you joking.

564
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,308
Bo-tat not get on plane.

565
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,479
Excuse me?

566
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,748
Bo-tat no like be on plane.

567
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,751
How often does she fly?

568
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,287
Bo-tat no like plane.

569
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,755
The kid's right.
Let's get a truck.

570
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,757
The plane is here.
We're taking the plane.

571
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,492
Bo-tat no like plane.

572
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,827
Kid... I'll handle it.

573
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,429
Well, then handle it.

574
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,264
Hurry up.
She goes down out here,

575
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,532
you'll never get her inside.

576
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,534
Linh... you nice American?

577
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,402
You think you number one?

578
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,572
You number 10.
You all number 10.

579
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,740
Cahill!

580
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,483
Bo-tat...

581
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,753
that's the way. Come on.

582
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,629
Heads up.

583
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,264
You number 10.

584
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,499
Tell her to lie down.

585
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,733
What'd you do to Bo-tat?

586
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,336
Tell her to lie down
so she doesn't hurt herself.

587
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,761
Tko. Heh heh heh.

588
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,365
What'd you do?

589
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,634
She's ok, linh. She's not dead.

590
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,270
You killed everything.
You killed everything.

591
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:41,705
You killed Bo-tat.

592
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,440
She's not dead.

593
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,342
You killed Bo-tat.
You killed Bo-tat.

594
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,811
You make it die.
You killed Bo-tat.

595
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,779
You killed Bo-tat.

596
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,450
Cahill: She's fine.

597
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,321
She's just sleeping.

598
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,360
¶ Your love ¶

599
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:06,363

h.A., what's the first thing
you're gonna do

609
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:29,653
when you get home?

610
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:30,787
First thing?

611
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,757
Hug my mom and
give her a big kiss.

612
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,358
Second thing.

613
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,628
Second thing?
Get her some kleenex.

614
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,430
She gonna be bawling
her eyes out.

615
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,581
So what about you, captain?

616
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:42,731
What's waiting for you
back in the world?

617
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,534
Uh...

618
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,604
A hammer.

619
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,607
My brother's
got a roofing company

620
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,875
in fort lauderdale.

621
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,778
Wants me to be a part
of that. Can't wait.

622
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,350
Been dressed in green too long.
Time to get a real life.

623
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,555
Ahh...

624
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,662
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what are you kissing?

625
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,364
What is that?

626
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,666
Oh, it's nothing.

627
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,501
Come on, what is it?

628
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,537
It's stupid. It's, uh...

629
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,639
When I first got to 'nam,

630
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,875
I was in the main administration
building in da nang,

631
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:30,447
feeling scared and...
Nervous like we all do

632
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,349
and thinking about home.

633
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,651
I was walking past
this coke machine,

634
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,519
a bottle of coke
just dropped down,

635
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,888
so...

636
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,759
Drank that bottle of coke
and kept the cap for luck.

637
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,362
So has it worked?

638
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,564
Well, I don't really
believe in that stuff,

639
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,633
but, you know...
2 years without a scratch.

640
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:50,900
Who knows?

641
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:51,901
I'll buy it.

642
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,304
Nah, man, I couldn't.

643
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,840
Come on, $20. I'll buy it.

644
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,575
Keep your money, man. I...

645
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,644
$40.

646
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,880
Well, hell, if it means
that much to you, I mean...

647
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:07,450
he just got it off the bottle
he's been drinking.

648
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,655
Captain,

649
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:13,890
major wants a word with you.

650
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,362
Hey, farley, look at this
great big beautiful beast.

651
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,364
How can you not like
something like that?

652
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,365
Well, sir, I tell you...

653
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,366
uhh... ow.

654
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,635
Yeah?

655
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,371
Yeah, we got a nasty headwind.

656
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:31,474
Give baby the other
dose, captain.

657
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,547
Poole,

658
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:40,750
we have to give
the elephant the second pill...

659
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:41,785
farley had a little run-in

660
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,653
with the second pill, captain.

661
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,728
Well, how much longer
will she stay out?

662
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,230
Well, one of these
things is supposed

663
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:54,731
to knock out a water
buffalo for 6 hours.

664
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,366
And Bo-tat's about the size
of 3 water buffaloes...

665
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,335
how much longer
do we have, poole?

666
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,670
We got another hour, easy.

667
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,673
Ok.

668
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:18,555
I, uh...

669
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,490
I was using the metric system.

670
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,101
Tell me you did that.

671
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,404
Uhh.

672
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,109
Doyle: Whoa!

673
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,687
It's awake!

674
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:51,654
What was your first clue?

675
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:52,889
Dump it.

676
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,694
All: Whoa!

677
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,500
Whoa!

678
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,902
Bo-tat!

679
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,871
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

680
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,182
All: Whoa!

681
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,187
Hey!

682
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,700
Ashford: Aah!

683
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:42,806
Doyle: Hey, hit the button!

684
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,442
Hit the button!

685
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,180
Get back there and shoot it!

686
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:52,582
Shut it! We're gonna die!

687
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,199
No!

688
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,901
Hey!

689
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:26,583
Uhh!

690
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,604
Back in the pit, pilot boy.

691
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,672
All right.

692
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,954
Linh: Bo-tat! Bo-tat!

693
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:42,592
Bo-tat! Bo-tat! Bo-tat!

694
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,932
Hey! Hey!

695
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,935
Hey! Hey!

696
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,937
Wait! Wait a minute!

697
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:55,305
You can't leave me here!

698
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:57,140
Hey! Hey!

699
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,809
I'm going to call lbj!

700
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,278
I knew it! Uhh!

701
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,951
Uhh!

702
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,823
Guys?

703
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,159
Guys? Wait up!

704
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,778
Stop!

705
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,146
No, no, no.

706
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,781
Bo-tat scared! Bo-tat need me!

707
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,717
Yeah, well, all I need is for
you to run off and get lost.

708
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,851
Let me go!

709
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,570
Cahill: Doyle, let him go.

710
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:45,288
If I let him go, we might never
see him or the elephant again.

711
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,623
Well, if you don't let him go,

712
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,957
you'll never see Bo-tat again.
That's for sure.

713
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,727
I'll go with him.

714
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,929
All right.

715
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:56,332
Farley: Come on.
Yep. There we go.

716
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,904
Bo-tat understand American.

717
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:36,339
Bo-tat,

718
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:37,874
we're going to take you
to a beautiful land

719
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:39,342
high in the mountains

720
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,943
where you'll be
loved and respected.

721
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:44,280
Where the air is cold and fresh

722
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,716
and the water
is cool and sweet.

723
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:48,918
It's the land where
you came from, Bo-tat.

724
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,420
It's where you belong.

725
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,990
Come with me.

726
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,423
Doyle: We're about here,

727
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,825
which means we're not
that far from tuy hoa,

728
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:05,228
maybe about 10 Miles.

729
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,232
We can get there tomorrow
and get ourselves a truck.

730
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:13,770
An elephant on a truck for 150
Miles in the middle of a war.

731
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,071
Piece of cake.

732
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,371
Poole: Gilman, you know
those solid gold dog tags?

733
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,074
They're yours.

734
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,775
All you got to do
is get me out of here.

735
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,476
Ah! Man, I just can't
spend the night in here.

736
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,179
Just send... poole!

737
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:24,447
Poole! Hang on a second...

738
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,349
poole! Give me that!
What are you doing?

739
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:27,550
Rustling up some
accommodations, captain.

740
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:29,252
I can have beer and steak

741
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,953
and... and padded cots here
in, like, half an hour.

742
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:31,988
Maybe even some ice cream.

743
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,356
And then, I figured,

744
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:34,891
since you guys don't
really need me anymore,

745
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:36,726
I could sort of head
back with the pilot.

746
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,560
If all the enemy within 5 Miles
doesn't already know we're here,

747
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,530
they sure as hell will
when a huey lands.

748
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,865
Come on, give me a break, will you?
I got you the elephant.

749
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:44,267
I'm supposed to be sitting in
the middle of a beach right now

750
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,568
worried about my tan line,

751
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,370
not out here in booneyville
worrying about snakes.

752
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,938
Snakes? Snakes?

753
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,907
You're right, poole.
You shouldn't be here.

754
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,275
Give me the radio.

755
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,876
I'll call general Richardson.

756
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,445
I'm sure he can
get you reassigned.

757
00:46:58,383 --> 00:47:02,318
Break out rations, gentlemen.
This is home tonight.

758
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:08,558
I'll bet you wish you had your lucky
bottle cap now, don't you, you smart ass?

759
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:26,375
Linh: What are you doing?

760
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,380
H.A. Is going home soon, linh.

761
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,883
He wants good luck to make
sure he gets there safe.

762
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,452
You want good luck?

763
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,920
Don't tell me,

764
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,488
you have an ancient
vietnamese bottle cap

765
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,357
you're willing to sell me.

766
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,260
Linh not sell anything.

767
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,996
Here, elephant is good luck.

768
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:52,468
You want good luck,
you touch Bo-tat.

769
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:56,339
Yeah, right.

770
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:00,977
So what's bad luck?

771
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:03,646
Um, don't whistle in dark.

772
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,548
Snake will come out
and bite you.

773
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,583
Snakes?

774
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,285
It get worse.

775
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:10,453
Yeah?

776
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:13,022
If you see owl at night,

777
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:15,324
someone in your family die.

778
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,460
Wow. So that's the worst?

779
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:19,295
No. No?

780
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,597
Owl nothing compared to crow.

781
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,499
You see crow any time,

782
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,935
that very, very bad luck.

783
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,570
So what happens
when you see a crow?

784
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:29,472
I tell you,

785
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:31,641
if you see a big black bird,

786
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:33,542
you run away.

787
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,016
You know what?

788
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,984
This country's
really beautiful.

789
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:44,287
I mean, I am shocked.

790
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:46,289
Yeah, it is great, isn't it?

791
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,223
Kind of reminds me of home.

792
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:48,357
Oh, yeah?

793
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,592
They got a lot of rice paddies

794
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,260
in cornpone, lowa,
do they, farley?

795
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,662
Oh, no, that's Arkansas.

796
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:54,363
I just meant... you meant what?

797
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,698
Tell me exactly what you meant.

798
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,032
Tell me exactly what
it is about this place

799
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:58,267
that reminds you of home, huh?

800
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,236
What is it?

801
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:01,504
The spirit-crushing humidity?

802
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:02,605
The disease-bearing insects?

803
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,407
Or is it the special feeling

804
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,242
that comes from the knowledge
that at any given moment,

805
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:08,511
a sniper's bullet could come
spiraling towards your forehead?

806
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,947
Is that it?

807
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,983
Poole, I'm getting this weird
feeling you don't like it here.

808
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:15,251
What's wrong with you?

809
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:18,487
I love it. Everybody loves it.

810
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,356
Bet you're the only
American in Vietnam

811
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,024
who would rather
be someplace else.

812
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,025
Enough.

813
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,735
Hey! Hey, come on!

814
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:34,603
Gimme... gi...

815
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,239
ohh.

816
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,041
Let's keep moving.

817
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:43,379
Where are you going? Hey!

818
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:45,414
They're going to help.

819
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:49,251
For the love of... Cahill,
don't get me wrong.

820
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:50,619
I would like nothing more

821
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,555
than to skip through the
countryside doing good deeds,

822
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:53,990
but we don't have the time.

823
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,725
We have to get
a truck, remember?

824
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,593
It won't take long.

825
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,996
Besides, we might even
get something out of it.

826
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,601
Maybe they'll
give you the stump.

827
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:08,671
You go play good samaritan,

828
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:12,675
I'm going to go to the
road and do our job, ok?

829
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:16,012
Go. Go play. Go play.

830
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:40,269
Bye, now.

831
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:41,838
Doyle: Where is everyone?

832
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,406
They'll be back in a minute.

833
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:46,308
Big stump.

834
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,411
America won something today,

835
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,613
and we didn't even
have to shoot anyone.

836
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:52,481
Oh, yeah?
Well, we lost 2 hours,

837
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,817
and we still don't
have ourselves a truck, so...

838
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:59,055
Yeah. How about an old diesel
with a 16-foot flatbed?

839
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,097
You think that ought to do?

840
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:11,333
One of our developing
agencies gave them a truck.

841
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:12,768
But they rarely can afford gas,

842
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,337
so they gave it to us for
pulling out the stump.

843
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:24,413
¶ Hang on, sloopy ¶

844
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,748
¶ sloopy, hang on ¶

845
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,849

848
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,323
so how long you had Bo-tat?

849
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,426
Forever. She belong father.

850
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,495
Huh. What happened
to your father?

851
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,832
He die.

852
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:45,434
Well, how'd that happen?

853
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:49,738
Do you think it was our side?

854
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,508
I don't know.

855
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,811
I hope not.

856
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:57,813
¶ Hang on, sloopy ¶

857
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,815

¶ sloopy, hang on... ¶

870
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:39,355
we got a leaky radiator.
I'll try to patch it.

871
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:52,635
Poole, I speak the language.

872
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,637
It's a joke.

873
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,340
Any more joking,
I'll call you know who.

874
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,284
Hey, stop!

875
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,652
Bo-tat need move.

876
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:11,420
Food.

877
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:12,888
Water.

878
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,790
She hungry.

879
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,359
She thirsty.

880
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,427
Now!

881
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:19,895
All right. All right.

882
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,533
All right, h.A., farley,

883
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,801
take her down to
that fountain there

884
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,403
and give her some water.

885
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:29,605
We'll give her food
when we get it.

886
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:37,746
Ah! Oh... Bo-tat!

887
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:40,816
Jeez, what you
been eating, baby?

888
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,356
One... one minute?

889
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:48,457
Ashford: Drink up, Bo-tat,

890
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:51,727
we don't want to
overstay our welcome.

891
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,896
One moment?

892
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:12,281
Hey, farley,
w-where's she goin'?

893
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:14,350
Oh, no.

894
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:15,351
Captain Doyle!

895
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:16,652
Captain Cahill!

896
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:17,753
Help.

897
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:30,766
Linh: Bo-tat! Bo-tat!

898
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,735
Bo-tat!

899
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:34,470
Linh, stop that elephant!

900
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:37,740
Ashford: Come back here!
Come back!

901
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,883
Stop!

902
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:51,654
Excuse me.
Watch out for the elephant!

903
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:54,390
Aah!

904
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,295
Whoa!

905
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,798
Ashford: Is he all right?

906
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,832
Farley: Oh, man!

907
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,535
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

908
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,674
Hey, um, sorry
about your chickens.

909
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:14,543
Linh, we got to turn the
elephant back this way.

910
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,546
We need to bring it back...

911
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,548
we need to bring the
elephant back this way.

912
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,318
Farley: Turn him around
and bring him...

913
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,887
hey. Hey...

914
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:26,455
whoa. Whoa... whoa!

915
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:28,657
Farley: H.A.!

916
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,859
Help!

917
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,461
We gotta go this way!

918
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:06,462
Let's go.

919
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,399
Wait, we haven't
even done the...

920
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,371
Oh, my God.

921
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:36,825
Cahill: Let's go.

922
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,128
¶ You better think ¶ ¶ think ¶

923
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,563

Come on!

942
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,202
Wait up!

943
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:21,870
Come on! Captain, slow down!

944
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,572
¶ Freedom ¶ ¶ freedom ¶

00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:25,707

hurry! Hurry! Come on, farley!

947
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,712
Aah!

948
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,682
Eww. Go. Go.

949
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,684
Whoa... unh!

950
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,231
That doesn't sound very good.

951
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:50,933
I know. We don't
have time to stop.

952
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:53,202
If they weren't after us
before, they will be now.

953
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:54,703
That guy at the feed depot

954
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:55,704
wasn't the only n.V.A.

955
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,573
They try to blend in.

956
00:57:57,575 --> 00:58:00,576
They all got
that same damn haircut.

957
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:19,261
Cahill: Ohhh.

958
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,164
Hey, w-where's he goin'?

959
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,265
Doyle: Poole, where you going?

960
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:24,500
Saigon.

961
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,502
Get back here.

962
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:28,170
Poole, do you want me to
call general Richardson?

963
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:30,839
Yeah, Cahill. Yeah, I do.

964
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,608
Ok? Call general Richardson.

965
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:33,775
Let me get him on the
line here for you, ok?

966
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:37,613
Because I am sick and tired...

967
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:39,715
I...

968
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,519
That's it. I've had it, ok?!

969
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,054
Ok, I was on a plane
that almost crashed,

970
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:46,588
I came this close to being
killed by an angry mob,

971
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,624
and now... Look at my uniform.

972
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:50,826
It's covered in elephant crap.

973
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:53,529
So, if you think
that I really give a damn

974
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:54,730
whether or not you call
general Richardson

975
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:56,198
and tell him that I
slept with his wife...

976
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,566
Doyle: Huh?

977
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:00,802
Oh!

978
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:02,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

979
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,573
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

980
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,392
You slept with the wife

981
00:59:06,393 --> 00:59:08,753
of general "kill 'em all and let
God sort it out" Richardson?

982
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,280
I thought it was his daughter.

983
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:13,215
Oh, yeah. He woulda
been fine with that.

984
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,886
First off, poole,

985
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,288
Saigon's the other way.

986
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:22,724
Second, the nearest
town in any direction

987
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,327
is hau bon, which is
30 Miles upstream.

988
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,729
And third, the only
hope in hell you have

989
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,898
of getting out of here
alive is to stay with us.

990
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:47,916
Doyle: It's cooked.

991
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,591
Ashford: What are we
gonna do, captain?

992
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,326
We wait.

993
00:59:57,328 --> 01:00:00,729
Things come along
when you need 'em.

994
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:02,731
My motto's
"have a little faith."

995
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:05,834
Yeah, well, my motto is
"explosives and plenty of 'em."

996
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,606
Load the truck with all the
claymores and grenades we've got.

997
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,708
String one of the
claymore's trigger wires

998
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,727
to the door.

999
01:00:14,728 --> 01:00:16,745
N.V.A. Comes along, goes
to open the door, kaboom.

1000
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,880
If we're lucky, it might
even take out the bridge.

1001
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:20,716
Lucky for who?

1002
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:21,883
The people around here
use this bridge every day.

1003
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,885
That's enough already.
We're in a war here,

1004
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,287
in case you don't remember.

1005
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,322
If you're right about the n.V.A.
Being after us,

1006
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,557
they're gonna be
coming down that road

1007
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:29,791
for one reason
and one reason only...

1008
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,727
to kill us.

1009
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:34,396
Their lives
are my responsibility,

1010
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:35,731
so excuse me if I don't
get all choked up

1011
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:36,732
at the thought of disrupting

1012
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:39,301
some local peasant's
daily commute.

1013
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,403
How do you know the n.V.A.'S
gonna be the first ones here?

1014
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:42,971
What if it's
a bunch of school kids

1015
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,406
who are goin' home?

1016
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,875
You ever think about that? No!

1017
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:49,277
Why? Because guys like you

1018
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,846
don't think things through!

1019
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,317
Me? What about you?!

1020
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,953
You've got 5 people and an
elephant risking their lives

1021
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:00,255
so you can go home
with a clear conscience.

1022
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,290
You're afraid when
you're up on the roof

1023
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,159
with your brother
in fort lauderdale

1024
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,728
and you're lookin' back over
your sparkling military career,

1025
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,397
you're not gonna like
what you see!

1026
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:10,232
You're afraid
Vietnam's gonna wipe out

1027
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:11,733
everything you did before,

1028
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:13,869
so you want to do one
good thing before you go.

1029
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,737
Which is great.

1030
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:18,407
But your one good thing isn't pulling
a kid out of a burning building

1031
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,909
or diving on a grenade.
It's<i> this!</i>

1032
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:24,413
And because it's this,
it means it involves<i> us!</i>

1033
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,982
But you didn't think
about that, did you?!

1034
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:28,350
No!

1035
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,952
Why? Because guys like you

1036
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:32,821
don't think things through!

1037
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,873
Hey, come on, sirs,
break it up.

1038
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,742
Break it up, sirs.

1039
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:54,976
Aah!

1040
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:56,244
Oh, God! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

1041
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:00,415
Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.

1042
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:03,251
Gimme your hand. Pull him in!

1043
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,757
You ok?

1044
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:09,891
Whew!

1045
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,861
Ok?

1046
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:22,270
Yep...

1047
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:23,939
I'm real happy
about my decision

1048
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,173
to stick with you guys.

1049
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:31,279
Uh, at the risk of
rekindling hostilities,

1050
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:34,883
what do we do now?

1051
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:37,986
Like I said,
have a little faith.

1052
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,419
¶ Ha ha ha ha ¶

1053
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,530
Is that my ears,
or has your singing

1054
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:22,931
actually gotten worse?

1055
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:24,332
Must be your ears.

1056
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,468
It was as bad
as it already could be!

1057
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,471
Doyle: Have
a little faith, my eye.

1058
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,373
You knew this boat was coming.

1059
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:33,909
My first tour, I was
stationed at hau bon.

1060
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,477
Every Wednesday afternoon,

1061
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:38,280
monsieur Goddard and the<i> Marie
antoinette</i> would drop in.

1062
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:40,448
He gave us
the best intelligence

1063
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:43,318
on the location of the v.C.
We ever got.

1064
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,920
What... what can I say?
I love America.

1065
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:46,988
Yeah. Hey.

1066
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,960
You gave the v.C.
Their best intelligence

1067
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:53,562
on our location, too.

1068
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:55,997
I can't help it, you know.

1069
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,365
I love everybody.

1070
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,533
Would anyone
like some wine here?

1071
01:03:58,535 --> 01:03:59,835
Yeah. Yeah.

1072
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,369
Wine?! No!

1073
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:03,271
What is this, the opening
of an art gallery?!

1074
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:04,873
No. This is a war.

1075
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,908
The green beret motto
is "free the oppressed,"

1076
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,376
not "eat, drink, and be merry."

1077
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:09,477
Yeah, now it is.

1078
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,379
Aww.

1079
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:14,382
What did I do? What did I do?!

1080
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:16,251
I should be on some
high-priority mission

1081
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:17,953
with a group
of crack commandos.

1082
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,921
Instead, I'm in an episode
of<i> mchale's Navy,</i>

1083
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,591
starring dumbo, Mr. French,
and the 3 stooges!

1084
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,902
<i>D'ng lai.</i>

1085
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:35,237
That mean stop.

1086
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:37,406
<i>D'ng lai?</i>

1087
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,574
<i>Dee.</i> That mean go.

1088
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,243
<i>Dee?</i>

1089
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,578
You try.

1090
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,447
<i>Dee!</i>

1091
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,917
Uh... d-d-d... uh... uh...

1092
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:49,885
<i>D'ng lai!</i>

1093
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,219
Good.

1094
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,921
You know 2 of 3
most important words

1095
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,289
for elephant.

1096
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,024
What's the third?

1097
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:58,360
Huh?

1098
01:04:58,362 --> 01:04:59,995
It means get off me.

1099
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:03,331
Poole.

1100
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,502
Can you get more of that
water buffalo tranquilizer?

1101
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:09,471
You really enjoyed that,
didn't you, Doyle?

1102
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:13,909
Linh was right.

1103
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:15,010
You are weird.

1104
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:16,478
Poole.

1105
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,013
Poole: Yeah, yeah.

1106
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:18,980
As much as you want.

1107
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:21,283
Ok.

1108
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:23,351
We get off past
hau bon tonight.

1109
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:25,387
Tomorrow we take
one of these trails

1110
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:26,454
which, God willing,

1111
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:27,923
isn't in enemy hands,

1112
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:28,957
over one of these ridges,

1113
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:30,692
down into pleiku.

1114
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,460
Friday morning we fly Bo-tat

1115
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,462
to the airstrip
near the village.

1116
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,932
By noon we walk her in.

1117
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:37,933
Piece of cake.

1118
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:43,305
Get down!

1119
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:53,014
Doyle: Stay down!
Everyone stay down!

1120
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,020
Farley. Hold your fire.

1121
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:01,289
They're out of range.

1122
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:06,294
They're gonna have us
in 5 rounds.

1123
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,696
I know this. I'm artillery.

1124
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:11,399
Give them a moving target.
Zigzag.

1125
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,409
Keep moving.

1126
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,693
Linh, what's wrong with Bo-tat?

1127
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,562
She hurt here.

1128
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:42,030
Oh, sh...

1129
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:43,698
oh, no, she's seasick.

1130
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:48,403
Look out... she's gonna blow!

1131
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:49,404
Eww!

1132
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,714
Years from now
my kid's gonna ask me,

1133
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,317
"daddy, what's the worst
thing you saw in the war?"

1134
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,752
After this, there's no contest.

1135
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:14,396
Doyle: Can't you get this
tub to go any faster?!

1136
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:18,333
You are going to sink my boat.

1137
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,603
Maybe not.

1138
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:28,476
Gilman, who would
I actually know

1139
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,611
that could get me
your head in a bag?

1140
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:30,745
It was a joke, pal.

1141
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:33,048
Yeah, I was kidding.

1142
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,050
I love you, man.
Like a brother.

1143
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,618
What are you, nuts?!

1144
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,470
Where am I gonna find
a triumph spitfire

1145
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,321
in the middle of Vietnam,
you rotten little rat?!

1146
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:42,323
Ok, ok, I'm sorry. I apologize.

1147
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:46,061
Ok. All right, you got it.

1148
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,695
Just patch me through to
firebase cheo reo now, ok?

1149
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:49,064
And direct to artillery.

1150
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,598
I don't have time
for channels or anything.

1151
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,634
Ok. He's puttin' me through.

1152
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:55,503
Son of a... heh heh.
Right here. Hang on.

1153
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,274
Uh... Yeah...

1154
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,775
We're on the song ba river

1155
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:03,344
being pursued
by n.V.A. In a boat.

1156
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:05,613
What? Yeah,
this is hotel Alpha.

1157
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:07,515
Who's this? Barney?

1158
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:08,850
Hey, Barney, what's up, man?
What you doin'...

1159
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:10,385
h.A.! H.A.! I'm sorry.

1160
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:13,321
Uh, cheo reo, we
need your help pronto.

1161
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,423
Request fire mission
and expedite.

1162
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,791
Call for battery fire
at grid coordinates

1163
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:20,428
bravo Romeo 354...1105 niner.

1164
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,830
Fire one marking round.

1165
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:33,641
Barney, that was perfect, man!

1166
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:35,510
No, it wasn't perfect.
It almost hit us!

1167
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:37,462
Give 'em other coordinates.

1168
01:08:37,463 --> 01:08:39,413
Captain, we're moving. Those
coordinates are gonna be perfect.

1169
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:40,648
Right about... Better be right.

1170
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:41,783
Fire for effect!

1171
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,718
Better be right. Now.

1172
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:58,633
Ha! Whoo! Whoa!

1173
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,834
Yeah!

1174
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:01,870
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
start callin' you

1175
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:03,638
the brown bomber!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1176
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,440
Brown bomber.

1177
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,367
You wanna try it on?

1178
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:52,287
I found a place where
we can spend the night.

1179
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,792
Farley: Hey, sir,
what is this place?

1180
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:33,661
An ancient temple.

1181
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:35,463
Buddhist?

1182
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:38,533
Actually, it's tam giao.

1183
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:42,904
A little buddhism, a little
confucianism, and a little tao.

1184
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,654
What's with all the elephants?

1185
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,425
The elephant
is the God in tam giao.

1186
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:06,894
Not a God.

1187
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:09,330
<i>Father</i> of God.

1188
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:14,535
In beginning,
elephant were white,

1189
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:17,805
and they fly in the air with
the clouds and the rain.

1190
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:25,413
One day, elephant fly down and
go into side of queen Maya...

1191
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:28,650
While she sleep and dream.

1192
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:31,386
She have baby.

1193
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:35,290
Prince siddhartha,
the gautama Buddha.

1194
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,459
Elephant, father of God.

1195
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,092
Linh, that story
you told was great.

1196
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,860
I... I loved the bit
about the flying elephants.

1197
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:15,730
Uh, just one thing, though.

1198
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,832
It might be better if you
started, "in the beginning,

1199
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,667
all elephants were black."

1200
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,670
All right, this
is our only option.

1201
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:26,541
We have to take this trail
over this pass into pleiku.

1202
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:28,576
Is the pass secure?

1203
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:30,845
Tch. I don't know.

1204
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,680
We could find out
at this village

1205
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,682
unless you think 5
Americans and an elephant

1206
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,818
waltzing into town might
arouse suspicion.

1207
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,586
Hmm. Not at all.

1208
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:39,921
We could send in linh.

1209
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:41,422
No one would suspect him.

1210
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:42,590
No, we can't do that.

1211
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:43,691
Why not?

1212
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:44,692
You know why.

1213
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,494
We can't take that chance.

1214
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:55,737
I got it. Wait.

1215
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,168
Doesn't matter to me
who killed your family.

1216
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,704
I imagine it doesn't
matter to you, either.

1217
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:35,476
V.C. Killed
mother and sister...

1218
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:39,414
But linh not know
who killed father.

1219
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,548
Linh and father going home...

1220
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:45,153
There was big light.

1221
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:47,588
Everything happened fast.

1222
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:52,693
People yell, shoot gun.
Father hold linh tight.

1223
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:54,128
Bo-tat run.

1224
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,930
They shoot Bo-tat.

1225
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,135
Father and linh land apart.

1226
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:04,705
Father get up, run
to linh, and fall down.

1227
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:07,909
He shot.

1228
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:09,877
Linh not move.

1229
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:11,913
Bo-tat save linh.

1230
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:14,582
Men shoot Bo-tat more times.

1231
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:18,486
Bo-tat no stop for many Miles.

1232
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:23,191
Bo-tat save me.

1233
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,916
Were you hurt?

1234
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,253
You said you couldn't move.

1235
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:55,790
No, I said I not move
because I too scared.

1236
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:58,226
Father die because I not help him.
I scared.

1237
01:14:58,228 --> 01:14:59,760
No, no, linh, that's not why.

1238
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,696
Yes, I scared!

1239
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:02,763
Of course you were scared.

1240
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:05,700
I'd be scared.
Anyone would be scared.

1241
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:07,902
Linh.

1242
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:08,836
It wasn't your fault.

1243
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,771
Who fault?

1244
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:11,939
People.

1245
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:17,211
People far away, linh.

1246
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:21,182
People who've never been here.

1247
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,218
Linh no understand.

1248
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:34,929
How did you get to ban don?

1249
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,797
American take linh.

1250
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:39,667
Said take linh back
to mountains someday.

1251
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,837
Never did. Lie to linh.

1252
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,208
I'm gonna take you
back to the mountains, linh.

1253
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:51,712
I promise you.

1254
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:08,629
Linh father was a good father.

1255
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:10,731
Number one father.

1256
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,867
I'm sure he was.

1257
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,581
I'm sure he was.

1258
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,398
Yeah.

1259
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:42,356
Oh, man, I just went
to go take a whiz.

1260
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,226
I didn't want to
desecrate the temple.

1261
01:17:45,228 --> 01:17:46,861
Forget about it. It's done.

1262
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:48,896
He probably went to get
some food or something.

1263
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:50,898
Whatever the reason, they're gonna
find out we're here pretty damn soon.

1264
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,199
He's just a kid.

1265
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:53,868
I know. I have to go get him.

1266
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,337
I'll get the elephant to pleiku
and we'll meet you there.

1267
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,972
Excuse me, guys, <i>una momento.</i>

1268
01:17:57,974 --> 01:17:59,974
But how are we gonna
move old Bo here, huh?

1269
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:01,976
Linh taught farley
the basic commands.

1270
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:03,878
No, he didn't.

1271
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:06,414
Ok, sir, he did, but...

1272
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:09,884
Take someone with you.

1273
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:11,719
I screwed up. I'll go.

1274
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:27,902
Th-that's funny. My... my
legs don't work.

1275
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,971
Poole: Ah, hell. I'll go.

1276
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:34,975
Kid's got my watch.

1277
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:18,986
Ok, do the foot. Get... get her
to do the foot and get up.

1278
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,287
Let's go.

1279
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:21,288
Come on.

1280
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,356
I don't... I don't know that one.

1281
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:23,808
All right, can you
guys give me hand?

1282
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:25,259
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here' take the gun.
Take the gun.

1283
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,461
Put your foot on my leg.

1284
01:19:27,463 --> 01:19:29,363
Ok. One... do you wanna jump in?

1285
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:32,933
On 3, h.A., 1...2...3.

1286
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,471
Ok, I'm up. I'm up.

1287
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:39,306
Good job. Good job.

1288
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:40,541
I don't know about this, sir.

1289
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:44,378
I guess that means she's ready.

1290
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,013
I think she's mad.
Doyle: Come on.

1291
01:19:51,354 --> 01:19:54,321
This way. Take us
around the village.

1292
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:57,191
Farley, this way!

1293
01:19:57,193 --> 01:19:58,359
He didn't teach me how to turn.

1294
01:19:58,361 --> 01:19:59,927
Then stop her!

1295
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:01,328
Ok, ok. Uh... Dee!

1296
01:20:03,348 --> 01:20:05,365
I mean... I mean,
Dee d'ng. D'ng. Dai!

1297
01:20:05,368 --> 01:20:06,433
Farley!

1298
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:07,868
Uh!

1299
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:08,969
Tell my mom I love her!

1300
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,479
Stop!

1301
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:54,014
Stop, darn it,
you crazy animal!

1302
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:04,225
Ohh!

1303
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,935
Whoa! Aah!

1304
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:16,337
Bo-tat?

1305
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:21,475
Farley, you wild a driver.

1306
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:22,543
Ha ha.

1307
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,585
Sam!

1308
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:32,653
You all right?

1309
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:34,021
Yeah. Huh?

1310
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:44,498
They worked him over
pretty good.

1311
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,967
He hit me this many.

1312
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:52,373
So, when I tell him you
in hau bon, he believe.

1313
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,341
You told him
we were in hau bon?

1314
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:05,319
Kid, why did you come here?

1315
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:08,289
You want to find out
if trail ok...

1316
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:11,325
But linh is the only one
who can ask.

1317
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:15,396
Before linh caught,
linh find out trail ok.

1318
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:17,031
You trust linh now?

1319
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:20,367
Yeah.

1320
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:25,472
I trust linh now.

1321
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:38,452
You guys do this hug a lot.

1322
01:22:41,324 --> 01:22:43,023
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1323
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:44,491
Bo-tat!

1324
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:46,293
No!

1325
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,594
Yee-hoo!

1326
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:16,690
¶ Aow! Walk that walk ¶

1327
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:19,560
¶ come on, talk that talk ¶

1328
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:23,597
¶ come on, tell me, baby ¶

1329
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:26,700
¶ come on, tell me
that you love me... ¶

1330
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:29,003
canceled?

1331
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:33,007
What do you mean
the mission is canceled?

1332
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:35,042
Turns out Doyle was right.

1333
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:36,410
We don't need the village.

1334
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:42,416
While you two
were off on safari,

1335
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:44,485
the ho chi minh trail
moved again,

1336
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:47,021
and intelligence estimates are
it's gonna stay where it is.

1337
01:23:47,023 --> 01:23:49,056
The village is of
no strategic interest.

1338
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:51,759
"No further
strategic interest"?

1339
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:56,630
Major pederson, sir,
we're so close.

1340
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:58,499
Let us finish what we started.

1341
01:23:58,501 --> 01:24:00,401
We just have to fly
the elephant to...

1342
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:01,568
to where, Cahill?!

1343
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,738
To that old CIA airstrip
near the village?

1344
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,474
The n.V.A. Blew the heck
out of it 3 days ago.

1345
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:09,410
You have no place to
land your elephant.

1346
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:11,045
The airstrip's gone.

1347
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:12,579
End of mission!

1348
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:14,415
What about linh and Bo-tat?

1349
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:17,384
Who?

1350
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,319
The boy and the elephant, sir.

1351
01:24:19,321 --> 01:24:21,622
Well, you ship them back to
where you picked them up.

1352
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:33,700
Where are you going?

1353
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:34,835
I can't tell you.

1354
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:36,336
Ashford: Why not?

1355
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:37,337
'Cause if I tell you,

1356
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:38,539
you'll try to stop me.

1357
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:39,807
If you don't try to stop me,

1358
01:24:39,809 --> 01:24:41,075
you'll be court-martialed.

1359
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:42,643
The mission's been canceled.

1360
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:44,745
I have a feeling the
captain's gonna ignore that.

1361
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:48,782
What are you gonna do, steal
a truck from the motor pool?

1362
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:49,716
If that's what it takes.

1363
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,618
Oh, hell!

1364
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:54,321
If we're gonna steal a truck,

1365
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:56,356
we might as well steal a plane.

1366
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,626
What?

1367
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:01,428
You worried because
there's no airstrip?

1368
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,530
We don't need one.

1369
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,599
Remember when
we first went to pederson

1370
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,434
and I said,
"let's get them a tractor"?

1371
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,769
What if we had?

1372
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,437
How would we have
gotten a tractor in?

1373
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,807
Tractors don't need airstrips.

1374
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,276
Poole.

1375
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,744
Yeah?

1376
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:20,414
Ok, we're gonna
need parachutes...

1377
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:21,882
we?

1378
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:23,784
Poole: Yeah, captain.

1379
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,853
We.

1380
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:28,689
H.A., farley, are you in?

1381
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,626
Yeah.

1382
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,395
Ok.

1383
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:38,265
You take one step toward dak
nhe with that elephant,

1384
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:41,435
you can kiss your sweet
military career good-bye.

1385
01:25:43,606 --> 01:25:46,640
Yeah, well,
maybe we all need to do

1386
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,442
one good thing before we go.

1387
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:22,776
E-easy now, easy.

1388
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:52,773
Hey!

1389
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:54,308
Shh!

1390
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:41,521
This is insane.
Bo-tat's not a tractor.

1391
01:27:41,523 --> 01:27:43,757
Poole, did we just hear
a heartfelt human emotion

1392
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:45,359
come out of you?

1393
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:48,462
Yeah, it was.
I feel bad for her.

1394
01:27:48,464 --> 01:27:49,664
Don't tell anybody I said that,

1395
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:51,365
ok, you guys?

1396
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:53,734
It's top secret, ok?

1397
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:55,435
So top secret, we're not
even getting clearance

1398
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:56,470
from the tower.
Radio's silenced

1399
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:58,505
and nobody knows anything.

1400
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:00,539
As a matter of fact,
this never happened.

1401
01:28:10,586 --> 01:28:11,885
Sir, they've stolen
a 123 out of pleiku.

1402
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:13,353
When?

1403
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:13,854
About 5 minutes ago, sir.

1404
01:28:13,856 --> 01:28:15,756
Damn it!

1405
01:28:15,758 --> 01:28:17,758
Get on the radio
and tell 'em to get back.

1406
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,726
That whole area is jammed
with n.V.A. Anti-aircraft.

1407
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:21,428
Yes, sir.

1408
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:42,382
Cahill: Don't
be nervous, poole.

1409
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:44,384
I just never
have jumped before.

1410
01:28:44,386 --> 01:28:46,820
Well, neither has she.
Does<i> she</i> look nervous?

1411
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,490
All right, listen up.

1412
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:54,094
Bo-tat and the crate
are on a static line.

1413
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,430
Now, the drogue will trigger
the parachute to open

1414
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:58,365
the second
she's out of the plane.

1415
01:28:58,367 --> 01:29:01,535
Now, you three are gonna
jump before Bo-tat.

1416
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:04,671
Free fall for a count
of 10, and then pull.

1417
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,107
Ok? Got it?

1418
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:09,810
We want to make sure
you don't get tangled

1419
01:29:09,812 --> 01:29:11,745
in Bo-tat's lines going down.

1420
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:12,913
And we want you to be clear

1421
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:15,682
of our large friend
before she lands.

1422
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,684
Now, captain Cahill and I
are gonna stay on board

1423
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,419
until Bo-tat gets off.

1424
01:29:19,421 --> 01:29:22,389
Once she's off,
we're gonna go, ok?

1425
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:23,423
Sam: Any questions?

1426
01:29:23,425 --> 01:29:24,791
Linh get one?

1427
01:29:24,793 --> 01:29:26,393
Well, no, linh.

1428
01:29:26,395 --> 01:29:27,694
You have to stay on the plane.

1429
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:30,364
Well, maybe he...
linh could take mine,

1430
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:32,132
and, uh, I could, um,
stay on the plane. I mean...

1431
01:29:32,134 --> 01:29:34,568
but linh go with Bo-tat.

1432
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:35,836
I'm sorry, linh.
It's too dangerous.

1433
01:29:35,838 --> 01:29:37,537
You can't.

1434
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:40,640
You promised you take linh
and Bo-tat home to Mountain.

1435
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,476
You will go home.

1436
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:44,544
You'll see Bo-tat
in a day or 2.

1437
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:45,912
But first you have to
go back to the base

1438
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:47,381
with the pilot. There's no...

1439
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:50,417
you lie! You lie!

1440
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:54,554
Hey.

1441
01:29:57,493 --> 01:29:59,159
Hey, you're right.

1442
01:30:00,496 --> 01:30:01,695
I did say I'll get you home,

1443
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:03,497
and I will.

1444
01:30:03,499 --> 01:30:06,166
I'll stay with you
on the plane.

1445
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:11,471
I'll get you to the mountains.

1446
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:13,407
I'll get you back to Bo-tat.

1447
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:16,943
You just can't go with her now.

1448
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:21,181
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

1449
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:28,789
Here comes another one!

1450
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,193
Oh!

1451
01:30:34,563 --> 01:30:35,929
Take us down below the radar.

1452
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:36,830
Pilot: This isn't a fighter.
This is a cargo plane.

1453
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:38,165
Do it!

1454
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:45,605
Aah! Aah!

1455
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:08,595
You can't drop
from this altitude.

1456
01:31:08,597 --> 01:31:11,131
We'll go back up when we
get closer to the village.

1457
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:12,799
Doyle: No, now.

1458
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,801
Do it now! Now!

1459
01:31:27,216 --> 01:31:28,715
Doyle: Ah, jeez!

1460
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:30,484
Looks like we're all
gonna be jumping.

1461
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:31,518
Can you get us in
over the village?

1462
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,854
One pass, then we bail.

1463
01:31:34,957 --> 01:31:36,256
We're going now!

1464
01:31:36,258 --> 01:31:37,724
Get ready.

1465
01:32:16,632 --> 01:32:18,231
Change of plans, linh.

1466
01:32:18,233 --> 01:32:19,866
Pilot: We're coming in
on the village!

1467
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:21,268
I'll be right down.

1468
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:30,310
Stand by!

1469
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:34,581
Ready?

1470
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:35,582
Yeah. Ok.

1471
01:32:35,584 --> 01:32:37,717
Go! Go! Go!

1472
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:39,853
I... I can't go, guys. I... I
left something back inside.

1473
01:32:39,855 --> 01:32:41,321
I gotta... I can't do this.

1474
01:32:41,323 --> 01:32:42,856
I'm an office guy, man.
I work in an office

1475
01:32:42,858 --> 01:32:45,225
behind a desk!

1476
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:51,731
Ashford: Isn't
this great, chief?

1477
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,733
It's moving!

1478
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,270
Farley: Isn't this fun, poole?

1479
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:21,595
No! Bo-tat!

1480
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:35,842
Hold on tight!

1481
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:40,981
Linh: Aah!

1482
01:33:52,628 --> 01:33:54,728
Sam: Hold on!

1483
01:33:57,633 --> 01:33:59,933
Aah! Aah!

1484
01:34:03,405 --> 01:34:05,739
Aah!

1485
01:34:07,342 --> 01:34:08,908
Get it! Go!

1486
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:23,323
Hold on, Bo-tat. Hold on.

1487
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:24,658
I'll get you.

1488
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,278
Oh!

1489
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:06,766
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1490
01:35:06,768 --> 01:35:07,767
Whoo!

1491
01:35:07,769 --> 01:35:08,768
Yeah!

1492
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:09,736
Thank God!

1493
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:28,848
Poole: Please, God,
get me through this.

1494
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:30,950
I'll never lie again.
Please. Uhh. Oh!

1495
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:33,920
Hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo.

1496
01:36:33,922 --> 01:36:35,355
Farley: Whoo!

1497
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,894
Farley, you're dead.
Swear to God.

1498
01:36:40,896 --> 01:36:43,296
I'm gonna kill you.

1499
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:44,931
Ashford: Oh, my God.

1500
01:36:44,933 --> 01:36:46,833
Oh, my God.

1501
01:36:46,835 --> 01:36:47,901
Whoa! Whoa!

1502
01:36:47,903 --> 01:36:49,936
Aah! Aah!

1503
01:36:51,273 --> 01:36:53,339
Linh like hug. Hug good.

1504
01:37:11,593 --> 01:37:13,560
Sam: Be careful. Be careful.

1505
01:37:13,562 --> 01:37:16,896
Keep everybody back.
All right. Very good.

1506
01:37:32,581 --> 01:37:34,380
Is she ok?

1507
01:37:34,382 --> 01:37:37,317
Everything number one a-ok!

1508
01:37:39,921 --> 01:37:42,488
Hey, where's h.A.?

1509
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:44,924
Get me a ladder!

1510
01:37:47,929 --> 01:37:49,596
Doyle: Back her up, linh!

1511
01:37:49,598 --> 01:37:51,865
Come on, sweetheart. We gotta
get you ready for the ceremony.

1512
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:53,399
Good girl.

1513
01:37:55,337 --> 01:37:56,369
Uh-oh.

1514
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:02,909
Unh!

1515
01:38:04,312 --> 01:38:05,578
Drop your weapons!

1516
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:18,458
You bring elephant very far.

1517
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:19,959
Very admirable.

1518
01:38:19,961 --> 01:38:21,494
I congratulate you.

1519
01:38:21,496 --> 01:38:25,598
Too bad you go
to all this trouble

1520
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,267
for nothing.

1521
01:38:29,938 --> 01:38:31,237
Bird, if I were you,

1522
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,572
I'd get the hell out of here.

1523
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:35,475
Elephant going to die.

1524
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,979
Drop your guns! Drop your guns!

1525
01:38:39,981 --> 01:38:41,347
Drop... drop 'em!

1526
01:39:35,003 --> 01:39:37,737
Roger, whiskey tango. Over.

1527
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:40,239
Crossbow 6 out.

1528
01:39:41,576 --> 01:39:43,576
What did he say?

1529
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:46,512
Well, the good news
is that capturing nguyen

1530
01:39:46,514 --> 01:39:48,381
and his men
has made you a hero.

1531
01:39:49,751 --> 01:39:51,317
And the bad?

1532
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:52,585
Recon photos are indicating

1533
01:39:52,587 --> 01:39:55,288
that the trail has moved
back this way again.

1534
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:58,324
Pederson wants you to stay.

1535
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:03,329
That is bad news.

1536
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:23,249
I have to go now, linh.

1537
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:25,351
You not like it here.

1538
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:28,421
I love it here.

1539
01:40:28,423 --> 01:40:33,593
I love this place more than
any place I've ever been.

1540
01:40:33,595 --> 01:40:35,728
You not like linh.

1541
01:40:37,432 --> 01:40:39,399
You know that's not true.

1542
01:40:39,401 --> 01:40:41,501
Then why you go?

1543
01:40:45,407 --> 01:40:49,742
Just like you had
to go where you belong,

1544
01:40:49,744 --> 01:40:52,378
I have to go where I belong.

1545
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:21,074
You forget linh?

1546
01:41:24,779 --> 01:41:27,380
When I forget how to breathe.

1547
01:41:43,832 --> 01:41:45,431
Take her easy, linh.

1548
01:41:46,534 --> 01:41:47,533
Safe trip home.

1549
01:41:47,535 --> 01:41:49,635
Oh, thank you. Good luck.

1550
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:52,338
Thank you.

1551
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,639
Hey, hope to be
in special forces, too,

1552
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:54,640
one day, sir.

1553
01:41:54,642 --> 01:41:55,775
Thanks. Good job, soldier.

1554
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:57,610
Thanks.

1555
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:59,378
Captain.

1556
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:00,646
Ever need anything...

1557
01:42:00,648 --> 01:42:01,781
Ok.

1558
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,652
Yeah.

1559
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:26,305
Doyle: Sam.

1560
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:27,607
When you're standing on a roof

1561
01:42:27,609 --> 01:42:29,542
with your brother
in fort lauderdale...

1562
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:33,446
I think you're
gonna like the view.

1563
01:43:02,443 --> 01:43:04,343
You watch Bo-tat?

1564
01:43:05,313 --> 01:43:07,880
Yeah. I'll watch Bo-tat.

1565
01:43:07,882 --> 01:43:09,348
Have fun.

1566
01:43:19,561 --> 01:43:21,627
Cliff Edwards: The horsefly.

1567
01:43:21,629 --> 01:43:24,730
I seen a dragonfly.
I seen a housefly.

1568
01:43:26,467 --> 01:43:28,734
Cliff Edwards: See,
I seen all that, too.

1569
01:43:28,736 --> 01:43:32,371
¶ I seen a peanut stand,
and heard a rubber band ¶

1570
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:35,508
¶ I seen a needle
that winked its eye ¶

1571
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:39,312
¶ but I be done seen
about everything ¶

1572
01:43:39,314 --> 01:43:43,316
¶ when I see
a elephant fly... ¶

1573
01:43:43,318 --> 01:43:44,550
Jim Carmichael: With the wind.

1574
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:53,659
¶ When I see an elephant fly ¶
