1
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:34,326
I still don't see why we just don't
eat the Cheetos?

2
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,028
Because this is like an annual thing
that we do every week

3
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:39,696
- once we get our allowance.
- But I'm hungry.

4
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:42,104
You ate breakfast.

5
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,639
OK, but I'm still hungry.

6
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,304
We'll get you something later.

7
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,445
Hit the dirt.

8
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,545
Do the honors.

9
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,290
All right, guys. Be still. And no
Cheeto fights this week, all right?

10
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:06,954
- Come on, just dump the bag!
- Just dump the bag, dodo brain.

11
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,134
- Beautiful!
- Save some for yourself.

12
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,434
OK, that's it.

13
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:20,307
Why are you guys always picking on me?

14
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,506
Everybody get Evan!

15
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:26,817
- All right. They're coming now.
- They won't come if you're not still.

16
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:28,877
Who farted?

17
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:36,861
Here they come!

18
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:49,865
Oh, one of 'em just pooped on me.

19
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,076
Oh, man!

20
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,380
Oh! Oh, man!

21
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:12,328
I mean, this could be bad for our health.
I think I'm getting a fever.

22
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,636
Oh, my God!

23
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,676
Aah!

24
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:33,376
Get 'em off!

25
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,294
What are you doing?

26
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,763
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were in trouble.

27
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:49,596
- So you hosed us?
- No, actually, I was trying to help.

28
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:51,033
Well, thanks.

29
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:54,334
I'm so sorry.
What on earth were you doing?

30
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:55,703
Feeding the birds.

31
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:58,834
- There's not much to do in Elma.
- Oh.

32
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:02,108
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm the new teacher.

33
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,872
No way!

34
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,544
I'm here from England for a semester
on a teaching exchange.

35
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,056
- I guess they didn't tell you.
- Nobody tells us anything.

36
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,020
- There's two classes. Little kids...
- And big kids.

37
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,423
- Oh, I'm teaching the big kids.
- No way!

38
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:22,298
My name is Anna Montgomery.
I'm from England

39
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:25,030
and I will be your teacher
for the first half of the school year.

40
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,765
Uh, before you get all sweaty, don't
waste your time with us. We're losers.

41
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:32,606
You're not losers.

42
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:35,875
Yeah, we are.
You just don't know us very good.

43
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,041
Didn't anybody tell you?

44
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:40,046
We had the worst test scores in the state.

45
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,310
So you all had a bad test day.

46
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:45,084
Four years in a row we had bad test days?

47
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:49,589
Let's all get to know each other, shall we?

48
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:52,927
Someone tell me something
that makes you feel special.

49
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:54,989
Why?

50
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,401
Right. I, uh...

51
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:05,409
I believe that you're all special
because you live here in America.

52
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:08,810
And America is a place where
you can be anything you want to be.

53
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:11,315
I think that was before Reaganomics,
ma'am.

54
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:14,978
I look out here today
and I see ten special faces.

55
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,182
That'll change once you get used to us.

56
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,554
Let's think of this a
different way, shall we?

57
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:26,496
What makes you different
from the kid sitting next to you?

58
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:30,763
- We have asthma!
- That's different.

59
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:44,539
All right.
All right, guys, um...

60
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:49,519
What about the rest of you, huh?
What makes you different?

61
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:50,782
Yes. Tak.

62
00:06:54,793 --> 00:07:00,390
- Well, I can burp the whole ABCs.
- Well, that's a skill, isn't it?

63
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:05,735
- OK, all right.
- Larry, your burps stink.

64
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,294
Larry, what makes you special?

65
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:12,309
- My dad has a job.
- Yeah, that's very special for this town.

66
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:15,278
Yes, I suppose so.

67
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:18,680
Kate... What about you?

68
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,685
My parents are divorced.
Thanks for bringing it up.

69
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:28,987
Shut up!

70
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:32,519
- What's that?
- First recess!

71
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,900
We've only just got here.
We have another hour.

72
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,671
Hello! Come back!

73
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:51,446
How many times do I have to tell you
to keep away from my car!

74
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,350
How many times have you told us today,
Deputy Dawg!

75
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,479
Go on, go on. Move it, move it, move it!
Move it, baby!

76
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:59,888
Come on, come on, off the car.
Out of my way, I got things to do.

77
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,984
Hey, you may think you know everything,
but here's a news flash.

78
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:05,458
Something radical
finally happened in this town.

79
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,362
Nothing radical ever happens in this town.

80
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:10,060
- Wrong!
- Yeah. We met our new teacher.

81
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:13,866
- You get a new teacher every year.
- But this one's different, Deputy Dawg.

82
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,600
Really different!

83
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:22,508
- Oh, guys, let's go.
- Bye, Deputy Dawg!

84
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:37,450
? Well. L"m hopin" and I"m prayin"
and I"m searchin" and I"m lookin"

85
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,191
? A nd I'm deatln' and I'm thlnmkln'

86
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,825
? That it"s just a matter of time
before you"re a pearl

87
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:46,632
? And I"m gonna getcha. My little old girl.

88
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:52,504
Bingo! That's a code red.

89
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:36,352
Excuse me, ma'am. Deputy Sheriff
Tom Palmer, Lane County.

90
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,652
We got an APB outta Austin.
Bank robbers headed this way.

91
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:41,693
Driving a Chevy. You seen 'em?

92
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,490
Only car I've seen is yours,
Sheriff Tom Palmer.

93
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,360
You can call me Tom.

94
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:48,729
You can call me Anna Montgomery,
Sheriff Tom.

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,863
- Oh, no, you can drop that sheriff part.
- Right. Sorry, can't help you.

96
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:59,039
- Where are you from?
- Surrey, England.

97
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,610
Oh, I'm planning a trip to England
real soon.

98
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,477
Been very interested in English things.

99
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:05,709
And I've always been very interested
in America.

100
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,445
Not a whole lot worth seeing around here.

101
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,350
Of course, there are a few
local points of interest.

102
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,753
Elma Armadillos was at one time
a football powerhouse,

103
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,951
- back in the days when I played.
- Like she cares!

104
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:17,495
Oh, the children are so cute, aren't they?

105
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:20,395
- See ya, Deputy Dawg!
- Anyways, as I was saying...

106
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,592
This town at one time was a football
dynasty.

107
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:25,068
There's a billboard off of Main Street,
documents some of the achievements.

108
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,431
You might want to take a look at it.
That's me on the left side.

109
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:29,770
Of course, big twister last year
took off the top of my head,

110
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:32,435
but you can still see the resemblance
if you're coming in on Route 49.

111
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:34,945
- Kind of like... But with... you know.
- Uh-huh.

112
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:38,210
Aren't you worried about
those bank robbers, Sheriff Tom?

113
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:41,377
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I gotta get on that.

114
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:44,650
Welcome to America.

115
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:50,020
"Welcome to America"?

116
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:53,929
The car kinda acts funny sometimes.
Bye.

117
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:04,405
Well, I think she likes me.

118
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,546
<i>OK.</i>

119
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:49,952
Stop it. You're supposed to read it.

120
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:55,483
Kate, tell her to turn this thing on.

121
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,064
- My dad wants gas.
- Sorry, Kate.

122
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:17,839
- Brenda, get this thing going!
- Yeah.

123
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,646
What is your problem?

124
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:24,553
My problem is you owe me too much
money for any more gas to go in this truck.

125
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:27,649
I'll pay.
I don't have the money now.

126
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:31,594
- What?
- I said, I just don't have it right now!

127
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:36,259
You won't have it tomorrow or the next day.

128
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:39,167
- I gotta draw the line, Ed.
- So I'm a little short on cash.

129
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:44,334
I mean, big deal. Maybe you
haven't heard, but the factory closed.

130
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:47,310
Yeah, and Darius hasn't worked
a day since.

131
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,439
How dare you act like I don't know
what the plant's closing means.

132
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:53,040
And how come you're willing
to turn against your own kind, huh?

133
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:55,484
- I mean, people who are hurting.
- Look...

134
00:12:55,554 --> 00:13:01,789
I got my own bills to pay, Ed.
I got my own mouths to feed.

135
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:31,012
Oh! All my beautiful stuff.
Days of collecting!

136
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,889
Aw, little kids' class
has show-and-tell again?

137
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,520
Right. Kate, would you like to
come and show the class

138
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:40,190
where Columbus first landed
in the New World?

139
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:43,200
- You mean get up?
- Yes.

140
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:45,930
I don't get up for anybody.

141
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:48,939
Right.

142
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:53,605
- Excuse me. May I come in?
- Of course. Please.

143
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:01,315
Miss Montgomery, class.

144
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,251
Class!

145
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:11,694
I said, class!

146
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,561
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

147
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:21,367
Um, this young man is Ju-an Morales.

148
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,931
And he's new in our town
and will be joining your class.

149
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,910
Howdy, Ju-an.

150
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:32,340
Welcome to Elma, Ju-an.

151
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:35,985
- Hello, Ju-an. Miss Montgomery.
- It's Juan.

152
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:40,821
Juan. You may take a seat.

153
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:45,295
- Don't trip.
- Hey, Ju-an.

154
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:50,993
Class, let's all make our new student
feel at home, shall we?

155
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:54,664
Pull up a cot and get a pillow.
We're in the middle of geology.

156
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:58,698
- That's geography, Larry.
- Whatever. Same thing.

157
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:01,405
Right. Can we all please focus
our attention up here.

158
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,379
Juan, we're learning world geography.

159
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:27,070
Can someone please tell me
what's wrong with this globe?

160
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:30,069
- You just broke it.
- Yes, that's true, but

161
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:34,074
since you all have absolutely no interest
in learning anything about anything

162
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:36,511
I'm talking about, such as this globe...

163
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:41,678
Well, why don't we just
try something else with it?

164
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:59,427
- Man, where'd you learn to do that?
- Prison!

165
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:02,563
- Ow!
- What?

166
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:05,804
Well, that's a joke, isn't it?

167
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,681
Um, I learned it in school in England,
which is another country far from Texas.

168
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:19,618
I have another idea.
Do you want to follow me?

169
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,364
Oops!

170
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,333
Whatever.

171
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,781
- Here we have it. A football.
- I don't think so.

172
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,383
I think it's Mrs. Curdley's old kickball,
ma'am.

173
00:16:56,461 --> 00:17:00,795
No, no, it's a ball. And if we use it
as a football, it becomes a football.

174
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:03,891
No, ma'am. Footballs aren't round.
They're more shaped like a lemon.

175
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:11,204
Oh. Well, that's right. What I call
football, you call soccer, so...

176
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,538
This is a soccer ball.

177
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,512
- We don't play soccer.
- Yeah, it's for foreigners.

178
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:18,981
- I'm a foreigner.
- Well, we're American.

179
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,247
- And we don't like soccer.
- Let's go outside.

180
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,982
- Isn't it time to go home?
- Whatever.

181
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:32,352
Right, that's the bell. What do you say
we all stay and have a practice?

182
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,265
- Let's just stay.
- Juan, where are you going?

183
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:40,532
We need you.
Don't you want to try?

184
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:42,937
We don't need him. Let him go.

185
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:46,272
So let's have a practice, shall we?

186
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:48,710
Give it a kick.

187
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,922
Hold up there, youngsters!

188
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:06,353
Good thing I happen to be in the area,
ma'am.

189
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,592
Cars come whizzing down this street
like there's no tomorrow.

190
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,726
I haven't seen a car pass all day,
Sheriff Tom, except for yours.

191
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:15,500
- Five times!
- Just doing my job, ma'am.

192
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:20,033
- Deputy Dawg's in love!
- Deputy Dawg's in love!

193
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:23,103
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

194
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:26,708
All right. Zip it, midgets!

195
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:29,652
I'm just fooling with you. I'm just
fooling, I never talk like that to you.

196
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:32,519
- Anyway, what you doing?
- We're playing football.

197
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,579
- Football?
- Yeah.

198
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:35,956
- This ain't football. I know football.
- This is what the world calls football.

199
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:39,929
All right, guys, let's all get in a circle.
Let's kick the ball backwards and forwards.

200
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:41,397
This is called passing.

201
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:44,299
Nuh, uh-uh. You should pass them
in the air for the pigskin.

202
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:45,734
You know, like,
"First and ten, do it again."

203
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:47,999
It's Troy Aikman right to Emmitt Smith.
Boom!

204
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:51,439
If you give me a hand, we'll discuss it.
Very good!

205
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,510
I got it! I got it!

206
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:05,213
Great! You guys are great.
This is so exciting.

207
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,258
Oh, you're showing such potential.

208
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,685
They are awful.

209
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,010
OK, you guys, I want to talk to you.
That's the end of the day.

210
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:18,964
- Whoa!
- Two points, Larry.

211
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:21,198
All right. You all tired? Good.

212
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:22,933
So listen, while you were all practicing,

213
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,771
I called the school board
and I got us in a league in Austin.

214
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:27,971
Unfortunately, their season
started last week,

215
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:30,446
so our first game's
gonna have to be tomorrow.

216
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:34,713
- Tomorrow? As in the day after today?
- That's what we call tomorrow.

217
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:39,485
- In Austin?
- That's, like, a million miles away.

218
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,787
Look, all you have to do
is believe in yourselves.

219
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,886
- Why?
- Well...

220
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,954
Because we believe in you.
Don't we, Sheriff Tom?

221
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,558
- Don't we believe in them?
- Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course we do.

222
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:54,002
Even if we did decide to go,
how we gonna get there? Walk?

223
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,336
That's a good question. Um...

224
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:59,672
Sheriff Tom, can you do me
a personal favor?

225
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:02,872
- Name it.
- Can you help me drive the kids to Austin?

226
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:05,040
Oh... Well...

227
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:08,779
Yeah, I'd love to.

228
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,912
Can you also do me
another small, personal favor?

229
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:13,514
- Anything, pretty much.
- All right, we're short a player.

230
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:16,492
- Uh... What do you think?
- I'd never pass for a 12-year-old.

231
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:19,997
I mean, what do you think
about getting us a kid to play?

232
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:23,864
Well, you know, I... I'm...
I got a lot of things to do, and I...

233
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,305
Well, what do you say, Deputy Dawg?
You gonna help us?

234
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,948
- Yes?
- Miss Morales?

235
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:40,007
What do you want?
My kid didn't do anything.

236
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:42,518
No, course not, course not.
I'm here as a coach.

237
00:20:42,587 --> 00:20:45,784
You see, Miss Montgomery's trying to put
together a soccer team over at the school.

238
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:48,382
- Juan doesn't play soccer.
- Well, none of the kids do.

239
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,427
But he doesn't like sports.

240
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:53,089
Well, maybe he'll learn.
It's an after-school thing.

241
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:55,595
I want him to come right home after school.

242
00:20:55,667 --> 00:21:01,367
- If you'd like to think about it.
- I don't need to think about it. Thank you.

243
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:03,770
Ma'am?

244
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:08,472
I don't think she likes me.

245
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:24,326
- Why?
- I explained why.

246
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:27,057
But if I don't play soccer,
I'll never make friends.

247
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:30,589
- I am your friend.
- You're my mother!

248
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:34,798
There's no reason to make friends.
We'll only be here a short time.

249
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:39,775
You'd just be sadder when we left.
Come on, let's eat.

250
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:42,506
I'm not hungry.

251
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,646
- Hey, Newt, what's up?
- Not much.

252
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:55,090
I found a part of a
tailpipe and an old shoe.

253
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:56,520
You seen anything good?

254
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:59,722
Nah. Look, I come here to ask you
to play soccer with the big kids.

255
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:02,197
See, they're fixing to start a team,
and we're down a player.

256
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:07,000
Wow! Nobody ever asks me
to do anything. Of course I'll play!

257
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:12,031
- Good. Thing is, we got a game right now.
- Wow! A soccer game?

258
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,342
- What's soccer anyway?
- Well, it's kinda like kickball

259
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:18,712
mixed with that there hockey.

260
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:24,346
Well, I don't know nothing about kickball
or hockey, but I'm your man.

261
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:47,070
- Oh, Sheriff Tom!
- Don't touch my hat, boy.

262
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:52,908
This is ground control.
Would you do me a personal favor?

263
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:56,442
Zip it! And I'm getting upset now!
I'll cut a switch and I'll tan your hides!

264
00:22:56,521 --> 00:23:00,457
- What did I do? Why are you hitting me?
- He's hitting me!

265
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:03,551
And you boys just relax now.
Come on, boys. Settle down!

266
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:05,926
I swear, I'll deny it.
I'll deny it all.

267
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,562
- Are we here to play soccer?
- No, sir!

268
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:11,795
- Why are we here?
- To win soccer, sir!

269
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:14,429
I can't hear you, let's do it a little louder.
Are we here to play soccer?

270
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,472
No, sir!

271
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,872
- Why are we here?
- To win soccer, sir!

272
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:19,910
All right, you're killing grass.
Let's move!

273
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:23,811
Let's go, let's go.
Here we go, now!

274
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:51,200
Pick it up, guys.
Come on! Come on!

275
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,711
- We're playing these guys?
- At least we practiced.

276
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:01,309
All right, bring it over here.
Let's go! Right here.

277
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,312
Hey, is that the team we're playing?

278
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:12,023
They don't even look like a team. Hey,
what do you turkeys call yourselves?

279
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:15,323
Hey, you guys, what's our name?

280
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:18,266
We don't have a name.

281
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:22,773
- We'll tell you later!
- They brought a goat!

282
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,243
Look, he just happened to be in the car,
OK? We didn't bring him on purpose.

283
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:33,375
- Yeah, right.
- I wanna smell sweat.

284
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,749
Wait a minute. I know him.

285
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:41,519
K-N-l-G...

286
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:44,254
- Hm. Looks rather tough.
- He was a real blockhead.

287
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:47,957
- Tom, long time no see.
- It's been a few years there, Jay.

288
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:54,596
Well, va-va-voom! I'm Jay Huffer.
Tom and I grew up together.

289
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:57,038
That was back when we were
both young and innocent.

290
00:24:57,108 --> 00:25:00,407
- Must 've been when he was a blockhead.
- Excuse me?

291
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:02,605
She's from England, Jay.
There's a language situation.

292
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,875
This is Anna Montgomery.
She's an exchange teacher in Elma.

293
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:11,821
I got out as soon as I graduated.
Only losers stick around.

294
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:17,524
Hey, my kid's the leading scorer.
How's your kid doing?

295
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:20,155
Don't have a kid.

296
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:24,327
Really? And you're coaching?
Why bother?

297
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:26,836
Love of the game.

298
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,440
Hey, come on.
I thought we were gonna play now.

299
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:34,569
Just a second, Newt. Go on back
and we'll be with you in a minute.

300
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:36,112
The little kid's playing?

301
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,479
That's right, we're mixing up
the sixth, seventh and eighth graders.

302
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,484
Yeah, enrollment's down
since we been there, Jay.

303
00:25:41,552 --> 00:25:44,316
Whoa, wait a minute.
You got girls on the team?

304
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:45,980
In our league, girls have their own teams.

305
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:47,922
Well, we don't have enough kids for that.

306
00:25:47,992 --> 00:25:52,486
So... you got little
kids and you got girls?

307
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:54,656
Yes, that's right.

308
00:25:54,732 --> 00:26:00,693
I guess they didn't tell you. We won
the league championships last year.

309
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:03,035
We, uh... We were undefeated.

310
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:08,871
It might be different this year, Jay-Jay.

311
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:11,107
Come on, Anna.

312
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:13,742
Well, good luck.

313
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:25,522
They got little kids and girls on the team.

314
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:33,028
This is not soccer.
Gentlemen, this is not soccer.

315
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,303
I hate that creep, and I
can't stand his kids,

316
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,400
even more than I can't stand our kids.

317
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:42,412
All right, you midgets.
You better win or you're walking home!

318
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,956
Hi. I'm Larry.

319
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,450
- Go on, get it!
- Concentrate!

320
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:30,120
- Get it!
- Watch where you're going!

321
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:43,138
Oh, no!

322
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,419
That's my boy. That's a Knight!

323
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:07,560
Flank to the right.

324
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,656
- Just suck it in. Suck it in.
- Stay with it. Stay with it.

325
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:12,669
The Knights! The Knights!

326
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:21,904
Ooh! Ow! Ow!

327
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,638
Pass it!

328
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:34,583
Don't lay on back, just go in there
and get aggressive with 'em!

329
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,625
Yes! Score!

330
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,924
Whoa!

331
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:14,761
- They're horrible.
- That's the spirit. Keep 'em down!

332
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:28,472
Knights, that's 8-0!

333
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:43,419
Men, we're up 10-nothing.

334
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:46,895
It's moments like these
that build character.

335
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:50,195
What do we do when we're
clearly superior to the enemy?

336
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:54,135
- Go for the throat?
- Exactly.

337
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,765
We show no mercy.

338
00:29:56,841 --> 00:30:00,038
We do not let up.

339
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:03,374
We go for the kill.

340
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:12,117
Now, let's take into consideration
that this is a learning experience.

341
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:14,453
Let's all get back out there
and concentrate,

342
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,993
and let's try and have a good time.

343
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:20,428
Hey, we may not be
the sharpest tools in the shed,

344
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:23,990
but we know the difference
between a good time and a bad time.

345
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:29,404
And this is not a good time.

346
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:44,082
That's the right place!

347
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:55,724
Oh, come on, Larry!

348
00:30:57,234 --> 00:30:58,826
And score!

349
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:07,070
16-nil! Let's keep it moving.

350
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:12,782
- Come on! Come on!
- Get in there! Tackle 'em!

351
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,977
Darlin', tackle 'em?
This ain't football!

352
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:18,886
- Tackle means get the ball off of him.
- Well, excuse me. Does she know that?

353
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:24,360
Penalty kick!

354
00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:28,331
Oh, man! Like a straight-arm!
Like old Bubba Smith!

355
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,924
Call me a stud, Jay, but I'll tell you
something, she got him.

356
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:34,368
Little ol' girl got your boy.
Sorry there, Jay! Whoo!

357
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:39,300
- Maybe I can get into this.
- Way to go, Kate.

358
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,783
Game! That's game!
Let's go, Knights.

359
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,227
Get off me!
You'll never take me alive! Aah!

360
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:09,328
Everybody in! Hands in. Let's sound off.
Let's tell them who we are.

361
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:13,740
Two, four, six, eight!
Who did we decimate?

362
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:14,937
What were their names again?

363
00:32:15,012 --> 00:32:17,276
They're not good enough
to have a name or even uniforms.

364
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:21,045
- They're nothings from nowhere.
- Knights.

365
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:25,517
Two, four, six, eight. Who did we
decimate? The Nothings! The Nothings!

366
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:27,921
The Nothings! Yeah!

367
00:32:27,992 --> 00:32:32,929
We're not the Nothings from Nowhere.
We're the Elma Nothings.

368
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:35,693
Is it over yet?

369
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,295
Do us a favor and learn the rules!

370
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:42,430
Well, Tom, we're a high-scoring team,
but 18-nil?

371
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:45,634
That's good, even for us.

372
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:50,408
Tommy, a suggestion:
Lose the girls. Even better...

373
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:55,612
Lose 'em all.
Find yourself some talent.

374
00:32:55,686 --> 00:32:59,986
Of course, I don't know
how you're gonna do that in Elma!

375
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:03,288
All right, victory lap!
Let's go, Knights!

376
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,561
Good game! That's a Knight.
There we go! There we go!

377
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:11,032
All right! All right! All right! Good game!
Come on, what are you waiting for?

378
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:14,332
Come on, let's go! Round the field!
Round the field! Round the field!

379
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:16,396
- What a jerk!
- Catch you later, loser!

380
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:18,998
- Come on, Kate. You tried.
- We're all proud of you.

381
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:21,101
Why? We tanked.

382
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:23,772
Well, technically speaking, yeah.

383
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:26,441
Yeah, but you all played,
and that's what's important.

384
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:29,213
What's important
is that we never play again.

385
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:32,312
Can we get out of here?
This is embarrassing.

386
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:37,417
- Yeah, come on, ya'II. Let's go.
- This stinks.

387
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:39,792
Do you know what I think?
I think after a good night's sleep,

388
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:42,798
they're all gonna feel
very differently about this.

389
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,763
I wouldn't count on it.

390
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,732
Give me a few minutes before you start.

391
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:52,742
- I speak their language.
- You got it.

392
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,109
OK, children.

393
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,641
Now you all have experienced
the agony of defeat. Big time.

394
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:07,157
Whoo! Now, I first started playing
organized sports... Hello.

395
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:10,591
...when I was about your age
right there at the Big Green.

396
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:15,530
Now, you see, we weren't very good,
but we never gave up.

397
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,726
- There was a day...
- I have a question.

398
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:21,532
Good, good! Exactly!
Participation, you see, it's a key.

399
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:23,072
Fire away, big guy.

400
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,267
- While you're here...
- Uh-huh.

401
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:28,834
Who's giving speeding tickets and picking
up dead animals off the highways?

402
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:33,407
I love the children.

403
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,918
First rule: No questions about anything.
Go ahead, Anna.

404
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:39,786
Come on, you don't fool us.
You don't know jack about soccer.

405
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:45,352
Now, I may not know all the rules, but I do
know a thing or two about kicking a ball.

406
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:48,057
Check this out, Miss Attitude.

407
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:51,461
- Whoa!
- What a kick!

408
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:55,062
- Good show!
- Ow. Right.

409
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:58,297
Wow!
Now I see why put you on the billboard.

410
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,400
Well, thank you kindly.

411
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:02,308
Listen, if you guys practice, you know,

412
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:04,643
maybe the town will give you
a billboard of your own.

413
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:07,946
Before we could ever be on a billboard,
we'd have to get a name.

414
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:11,886
Even bad teams have names.

415
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:16,654
How about the Big Green?
You know, the old sign. That's our field.

416
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:19,560
- That's pretty good.
- That's a good idea.

417
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,155
Hey, good idea, Newt.

418
00:35:22,232 --> 00:35:26,965
- So I guess we're the Big Green.
- Yeah, now if only we could play.

419
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:31,303
Look, nobody plays well without practice.
Now we've got to start with the basics.

420
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:34,003
Now in soccer training,
there are four different areas:

421
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,307
- Right.
- Fitness, technique,

422
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,847
- tactics...
- Uh-huh.

423
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:40,713
...and game psychology.
I knew that.

424
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,783
All right, let's all line up.
Boys and girls, right down here.

425
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:47,085
Everybody, come on.
Come on, Katie, Lou and Sue.

426
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:51,693
Pardon me, Lou. Sue and Lou.
Come on, go in there, Larry. Excellent.

427
00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:55,254
Ah... Sheriff Tom?
You might want to join them in line.

428
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:57,766
It looks to me like you've had
one nacho plate too many.

429
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:02,499
OK, if you wanna play soccer properly,

430
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:05,633
you've got to be able to run
for at least an hour.

431
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:09,236
- If I ran for an hour it'd kill me.
- Ditto.

432
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:11,645
That's right.
But we're gonna work up to that hour.

433
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:13,615
Now today we're gonna run for 12 minutes.

434
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:17,051
You ready? Let's go.

435
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:19,513
Come on, midgets, get your butts in gear!

436
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,579
Come on,
Miss Montgomery's talking to you.

437
00:36:20,657 --> 00:36:23,353
Deputy Dawg, you owe us.

438
00:36:23,427 --> 00:36:24,758
Come on, Katie, get up.
Come on,

439
00:36:24,828 --> 00:36:28,696
Evan, come on.
Tak, get on. Lou and Sue, everybody.

440
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:31,666
I wore boots today.

441
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:35,330
- Sheriff Tom's gonna pay for this one!
- Come on! Get going! Keep it up!

442
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:41,105
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Come on! Come on!

443
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:47,412
Come on, come on, come on!
Faster! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!

444
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:50,612
- My feet hurt.
- My shins hurt.

445
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:54,851
- So, what do you think?
- We'll never last.

446
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,862
I'll see you guys later.

447
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,262
Hey, you want to come over my house?

448
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:11,273
OK. One lesson apiece.
No telling anyone. Ever!

449
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:16,005
Hold on, everybody!

450
00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:23,812
? On the road again

451
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:28,381
? Just can"t wait to get on the road again

452
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:32,053
? The life I love
is making music with my friends

453
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:35,959
? And I can"t wait to get on the road again

454
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:43,371
? On the road again.
Going places that I"ve never been

455
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,274
? Seeing things that I may never see again

456
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:51,007
? And I can"t wait to get on the road again

457
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,946
? On the road again

458
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:56,008
? <i>Like</i> a band of gypsies
we go down the highway.

459
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:59,613
We love you, Deputy Dawg!

460
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:14,837
Kate, I know you can do this.

461
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:18,397
Come on, I'll probably just end up
being a checker at the Piggly Wiggly.

462
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:21,239
So what difference does it make?

463
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:24,644
You don't fool me, Kate.
I know how smart you are.

464
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:28,048
And even checkers at Piggly Wiggly
will need math too.

465
00:38:28,285 --> 00:38:31,085
No, they don't. They have those
little black stripes on all the things.

466
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:34,052
It adds it all automatic.

467
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:39,319
Look, giving up before you've ever really
started is a sad way to live your life.

468
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:43,264
You keep your talents hidden and
undiscovered, you'll only cheat yourself.

469
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:48,532
Why don't you all worry
about your own work?

470
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:50,630
Kate's right.
Everyone get back to work.

471
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,698
Whatever.

472
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,394
Hey, two points.

473
00:39:12,462 --> 00:39:16,956
- Maybe Juan's got some hidden talents.
- No way. Juan doesn't play.

474
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:19,002
Yeah, he doesn't look very athletic anyway.

475
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:21,363
Like you do?

476
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:25,404
- You gonna play goalie?
- I always play goalie.

477
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:27,534
Mind if I take a few shots against you?

478
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:31,809
- Oh, you're gonna play?
- Don't worry, I'm not very athletic.

479
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:36,683
- Get in the goal, Larry.
- What did I do?

480
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:39,051
As if he could get it past King Larry!

481
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:52,829
Yeah! Come on, big boy! Yeah!

482
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:03,278
Gosh, I'm not feeling so good about this.

483
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:10,446
Whoa, we don't look like that
when we get the ball.

484
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,353
Yeah, that's for sure.

485
00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:18,326
- You think he's done this before?
- I think he's done this a lot before.

486
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:32,637
- He's awesome!
- Too bad he doesn't have a twin.

487
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,109
He couldn't have a twin.
He isn't human.

488
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,316
- He's definitely the answer, you guys.
- What was the question?

489
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:43,352
- How are we gonna win?
- Juan!

490
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:46,513
- Hey, he's getting away.
- Wait up!

491
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,457
- We need to talk to you.
- Oh, yeah?

492
00:40:49,526 --> 00:40:54,054
- Where did you learn to play like that?
- In El Paso. Everybody plays there.

493
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:56,759
- Well, you gotta play with us here.
- No.

494
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,233
Come on, we need you.
You're so good.

495
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:03,466
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- It's all right, man.

496
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,174
So you were holding out on us.

497
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,879
- It's just a game.
- Not the way you play it.

498
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:21,356
Wait till we go to Austin, we're gonna
kick butt all the way to Pizza Hut.

499
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:23,358
Man, I wish we lived in a town
with a Pizza Hut!

500
00:41:23,426 --> 00:41:27,055
Um, look, I can play at recess,
but I can't play on the team.

501
00:41:27,297 --> 00:41:29,356
What do you mean?

502
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:32,265
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- I don't get it.

503
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:34,303
It's a family thing.

504
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:37,807
All right, excitement's over.
Everyone take their seats.

505
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:54,548
Please!

506
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:59,061
I don't want Juan
going into the city by himself.

507
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,393
He doesn't go by himself.
We all go.

508
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:02,556
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

509
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:06,466
He'd probably do better without us,
Mrs. Morales, but it's a team sport.

510
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:09,266
Austin's really not that far.

511
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:11,330
You could come.
My mom's gonna go this time.

512
00:42:11,408 --> 00:42:13,968
Oh, I can't.
I work during the day.

513
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:16,604
We can take care of him, ma'am.
We promise.

514
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,379
Yeah! Please! Please!

515
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:25,046
Control the ball now! Control!

516
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:34,761
You think they look athletic?

517
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:39,131
- No, I think you look athletic, Larry.
- Really? Cool.

518
00:42:39,202 --> 00:42:40,794
My Aunt Burr used to say,
"Anything you need in life

519
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:42,998
can probably be made
with masking tape and spit."

520
00:42:43,073 --> 00:42:45,098
- What are we making?
- Shin guards.

521
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:46,707
Oh!

522
00:42:46,776 --> 00:42:50,735
- Let's go, Terminators!
- OK, here we go, Terminators!

523
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:54,814
Ready, dude.

524
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,565
- Come on, shoot it, Tak!
- You're wide open!

525
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,833
Shoot it now!

526
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:23,385
God! What's wrong with you?
You were wide open!

527
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:26,679
Come on, now, let's hustle!
Come on!

528
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:37,354
- All right, we'll be back. Come on.
- Let's stay with it, guys!

529
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:54,936
Get the big one!
Get on the big one!

530
00:43:56,913 --> 00:43:58,938
Terminators!

531
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,910
Here we come!

532
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,822
Hey, Larry! Larry, Larry.

533
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:24,640
- Are you OK?
- Can I tell you a secret?

534
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,403
Well, sure.

535
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:31,937
When I get afraid...
I mean really afraid,

536
00:44:32,015 --> 00:44:37,715
the players on the other team,
they change into these bad guys.

537
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:43,191
I mean, they really
change into these bad guys.

538
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:50,664
You're a pretty complicated guy, Larry.
Um... catch you later, big guy.

539
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:55,933
Come on in! All right. Polly, you did
great. Good going, Polly. Come on.

540
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:02,470
- No one's passing to me.
- You'd just lose the ball.

541
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:05,309
Too many are passing it to me.

542
00:45:05,382 --> 00:45:08,909
All right, now quiet down.

543
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:11,681
Quiet down.
Quiet down and listen to me!

544
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:14,883
- Why should we listen to you?
- 'Cause I'm your coach.

545
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,222
No, you're just here
'cause you're after our coach.

546
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:19,557
Yeah!

547
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:21,389
I'm here, midgets,
and that should be enough.

548
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:22,864
- Well, it's not enough.
- Well, it is enough.

549
00:45:22,932 --> 00:45:24,524
I'll tell you what, 'cause
I'm an adult, all right!

550
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:28,332
All right, guys!
Hey, this is wrong, all right.

551
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:31,340
We're not to fight each other,
whether it's on the field or off.

552
00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:36,004
All right? This is not what we talked about
when we spoke of teamwork.

553
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,344
- Stop calling them midgets.
- Yeah!

554
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:44,852
Now, listen to me. Juan can't do
everything. You gotta pass to each other.

555
00:45:44,921 --> 00:45:46,081
Right?

556
00:45:46,322 --> 00:45:47,949
He's the only one who's any good.

557
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:50,584
But playing like a team right now
is more important than winning.

558
00:45:50,627 --> 00:45:53,596
And once we have more skills, that's
the only way you guys could ever win.

559
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:57,326
Exactly, right?
So you gotta support each other. OK?

560
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,664
Now look, look. Come over here.
Come here.

561
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:02,864
Let's say... gather around...
this is the field, right?

562
00:46:02,939 --> 00:46:07,308
And Juan is right here. Now, if
they've got three defenders on Juan,

563
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:10,403
- that means...
- Two of you guys are wide open.

564
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,041
Right. Take advantage of this, all right?
They're not expecting it.

565
00:46:14,284 --> 00:46:16,479
Let's make a go of it, a game of it.
You see what I'm saying?

566
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:17,144
- All right?
- Yeah.

567
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,154
- All right?
- Yes!

568
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,893
Kate! Kate!

569
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:11,469
Shoot it!

570
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,711
- You scored!
- I did it?

571
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:20,976
- You scored!
- I did it! I did it! I did it!

572
00:47:21,818 --> 00:47:25,481
I scored a goal! Yay!

573
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:27,855
- I knew you could do it! Whoo!
- Whoo!

574
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:29,983
- That's one.
- Ah, that was brilliant!

575
00:47:41,404 --> 00:47:43,235
You're late.

576
00:47:43,306 --> 00:47:47,037
We stopped at a Pizza Hut after the game.

577
00:47:48,411 --> 00:47:53,110
- I scored a goal.
- Did you win?

578
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,942
No.

579
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:05,390
Next time we'll win.

580
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:21,271
- Good. You guys are doing good!
- Looking good! Pass it!

581
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:24,279
- Hey, you know, they're getting better.
- Yeah.

582
00:48:29,652 --> 00:48:32,621
Hey, it's starting to rain.

583
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:35,214
Hey, Larry, come on in!

584
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:39,490
Hey, come on, kids. Come on in!

585
00:48:39,562 --> 00:48:43,999
- Come on! It's raining!
- Raining! That's it for today! Time-out.

586
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:45,932
It's not over for us!

587
00:48:46,002 --> 00:48:48,527
- Come on! Come on in!
- Come on, Larry. Give us the ball!

588
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:52,564
- No! You want it? Come and get it!
- Yeah!

589
00:48:52,642 --> 00:48:55,975
- Larry, give us the ball!
- Larry, gimme the ball, boy.

590
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:59,105
Let's make them work to get the ball!

591
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:03,619
We better help 'em out. Those kids
are never gonna give up the ball.

592
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:12,089
- I'm playing soccer!
- Let's play soccer!

593
00:49:13,796 --> 00:49:19,291
? When the rain comes pouring down
and it just don"t seem to stop

594
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:24,636
? Remember good things fall from
heaven. It ain"t no time for giving up.

595
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:27,471
Polly, come on, you crazy girl!

596
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:34,816
Come on!

597
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:42,820
Yeah!

598
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:45,622
- Lord have mercy!
- We're playing mud soccer!

599
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:38,411
Stop! I need help!

600
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,416
Thank you, God.

601
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:45,111
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Here and here and here.

602
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:46,815
- It sure is.
- Uh-huh.

603
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:48,373
- You see how that works?
- Yeah.

604
00:51:48,451 --> 00:51:49,851
You look nice.
Your hair looks nice.

605
00:51:49,919 --> 00:51:50,943
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

606
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,114
All right, you guys.
We gotta mow the Big Green.

607
00:51:54,357 --> 00:51:55,881
This is degrading.

608
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:59,985
Come on, guys. Am I the only one
doing anything here? Wimps.

609
00:52:01,364 --> 00:52:03,525
It's heavy!

610
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:13,900
- Count of three.
- One, two, three!

611
00:52:15,912 --> 00:52:19,541
It won't slow down!
It won't slow down at all!

612
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,932
Oh, no!

613
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,496
Oh, no! Runaway cows!

614
00:52:47,777 --> 00:52:51,770
- The low-tech solution.
- Cool. We don't have to do anything.

615
00:52:55,117 --> 00:52:58,450
It worked! This is awesome!
The cows actually worked.

616
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:03,015
- Hey, look. Here comes Larry.
- This is rad! You are awesome!

617
00:53:03,259 --> 00:53:05,318
Aah!

618
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:08,487
Gosh.

619
00:53:09,632 --> 00:53:12,465
- You're dead!
- Oh, no!

620
00:53:21,177 --> 00:53:26,012
- That's great. Is that for Sue or Lou?
- I don't know.

621
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:47,362
Thank you!

622
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:11,616
Keep your eyes open
and keep your mouth closed.

623
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:35,247
Come on there, Polly!
That's it, good, Katie.

624
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:37,309
Nice! Very nice. Go on, Juan.

625
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:58,396
Good. Good pace. Keep it up.

626
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:13,949
Gently, gently.

627
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:30,333
Ninjas!

628
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,274
Corner kick, Big Green.

629
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:50,008
Score!

630
00:56:50,986 --> 00:56:52,453
Juan!

631
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,786
Juan!

632
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:12,031
Good! Good! Good!
That's a hustle!

633
00:57:16,845 --> 00:57:19,370
The walking dead.

634
00:57:26,855 --> 00:57:29,380
Buccaneers!

635
00:57:48,109 --> 00:57:50,077
Take it, Sue!

636
00:57:58,553 --> 00:58:00,714
Vikings.

637
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:03,447
We're gonna come and get you,
little porker!

638
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:12,922
- Goal!
- Congratulations, Coach. That's one.

639
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:49,301
Here she comes!

640
00:58:56,511 --> 00:58:58,638
Surprise!

641
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:03,817
Hey, we figured out what makes us special.

642
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:10,085
- Well, I can see that.
- It's not all the stuff we put up, ma'am.

643
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:12,953
- It's you.
- Yeah.

644
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,016
Thank you.

645
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:46,520
- What's this? St. Patrick's Day?
- Nah. It's Big Green Day.

646
00:59:46,594 --> 00:59:49,961
- Every day is Big Green Day lately.
- You got that right.

647
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:53,831
- The championship game is Saturday.
- Oh, God.

648
00:59:54,903 --> 00:59:59,931
- Well, if it isn't Jay Huffer!
- In from the big city.

649
01:00:00,008 --> 01:00:05,310
A mini-mall's a big city compared
to this place. Double scotch, straight up.

650
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,713
- Things are that good, huh?
- One of those days.

651
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:13,277
Eh... What are you doing for a living
nowadays, Jay?

652
01:00:13,354 --> 01:00:16,482
Auditor. IRS.

653
01:00:16,558 --> 01:00:18,788
- Ugh!
- I love my work.

654
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,420
Ugh!

655
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:26,126
So I see you somehow managed to get
yourselves a good soccer team, huh?

656
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:28,995
- They're just a bunch of kids.
- Hey, they're winners.

657
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,471
We kinda got out of the habit of winning,
but it feels good.

658
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,735
It's hard to believe that
Mexican kid's a star.

659
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:39,712
Who, Juan? He's incredible.
Kate's damn good too.

660
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:44,548
- You oughta come out and watch her.
- I got better things to do.

661
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:47,588
Just my luck somebody'd move here
who knew how to play, huh?

662
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:51,523
Well, things would be a lot better
if people would just stay put.

663
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:53,083
Probably not even legal.

664
01:00:53,328 --> 01:00:56,297
- I doubt it. Most foreigners aren't.
- I hear you.

665
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,925
Say, Ed...

666
01:01:03,071 --> 01:01:06,666
Let me buy you that next drink, huh?

667
01:01:20,021 --> 01:01:23,650
- Judy said you wanted to see me, sir?
- Yeah, Tom.

668
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:27,320
I hope I'm not taking you away
from your soccer duties.

669
01:01:27,395 --> 01:01:33,459
I have some real sheriff work
for you to do. Got a call on some illegals.

670
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:41,331
- Morales? This kid's on my team.
- Good. Then you know where to find him.

671
01:01:43,378 --> 01:01:45,608
Mom, just tell him.

672
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:52,319
I've been in the United
States for 14 years.

673
01:01:52,387 --> 01:01:55,356
Juan was born in El Paso.
He's a citizen.

674
01:01:55,423 --> 01:01:57,891
They had amnesty about eight years ago,
but I did not apply.

675
01:01:57,959 --> 01:02:00,621
I'd gone back to El Salvador
to see my parents.

676
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:03,755
You were supposed to have
stayed in this country the whole time.

677
01:02:04,832 --> 01:02:07,096
Do the people you work for
know you're illegal?

678
01:02:10,605 --> 01:02:14,439
I bought a fake Social Security card
in San Antonio five years ago.

679
01:02:14,509 --> 01:02:19,071
I pay taxes and Social Security
under that name.

680
01:02:19,314 --> 01:02:25,378
I have an American son, but I can be
deported, sent back, just like that, OK?

681
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,408
What's he doing here?

682
01:03:10,732 --> 01:03:12,700
Hey, what's up?

683
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:16,532
Oh!

684
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:19,206
But are you sure?

685
01:03:19,273 --> 01:03:22,003
Yes, she was very upset.
Let's go over there.

686
01:03:22,076 --> 01:03:26,342
No, no. Look, school starts
in five minutes, all right?

687
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:28,405
When Juan gets here,
we'll make sure everything's OK.

688
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:30,684
Everything's not OK.
That's what I'm trying to tell you!

689
01:03:30,752 --> 01:03:33,778
Kate, you're overreacting.
Now, go and sit down.

690
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:38,652
You're wrong. You'll see.

691
01:03:50,738 --> 01:03:52,729
- I'm going to Juan's house.
- Wait!

692
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:54,502
We're not supposed to leave school.

693
01:03:54,575 --> 01:03:57,271
- Hey, wait up! I'm going too!
- Me too!

694
01:03:57,345 --> 01:03:58,835
Come on, guys, we're late for his house!

695
01:03:58,913 --> 01:04:02,178
- Wait for us!
- Come on, you guys, do we have to run?

696
01:04:03,584 --> 01:04:07,384
- They're gone!
- Darn! We just lost our center halfback!

697
01:04:07,455 --> 01:04:11,824
- Come on, Nick. He was our friend.
- Great. We're busted.

698
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:14,726
We shouldn't have left school.

699
01:04:14,796 --> 01:04:18,288
Why did you leave school?
What are you guys doing here?

700
01:04:18,366 --> 01:04:21,733
They're gone! We can see inside.
All their stuff is gone!

701
01:04:21,803 --> 01:04:26,035
- She panicked.
- I told you! It's all your fault.

702
01:04:26,107 --> 01:04:27,734
- I saw you here. You did it!
- Kate!

703
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:30,744
- Kate!
- Kate!

704
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:32,279
Kate, it'll be OK!

705
01:04:32,346 --> 01:04:33,973
Kate!

706
01:04:34,048 --> 01:04:36,516
Kate, come on! We need you!

707
01:04:42,724 --> 01:04:47,127
- What are you doing home?
- They're gone.

708
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:52,423
She left three years ago.
Or didn't you notice?

709
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,630
Not Mom. Juan.

710
01:04:56,704 --> 01:04:58,797
What? That Mexi kid?

711
01:04:58,873 --> 01:05:02,502
Don't call him that!
Don't you ever call him that!

712
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:07,071
- Honey, I didn't mean anything by that.
- Yeah, you do.

713
01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:09,806
What the hell's gotten into you?

714
01:05:09,884 --> 01:05:14,344
Soon as I'm old enough, I'm out of here.
Nobody in their right mind would stay here!

715
01:05:14,422 --> 01:05:16,185
Now you hold on just a damn minute.

716
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:19,226
Don't worry.
You won't know I'm gone.

717
01:05:19,293 --> 01:05:21,124
You don't even know I'm here right now!

718
01:05:21,195 --> 01:05:24,323
Honey, come back!

719
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,296
Come back here!

720
01:05:51,192 --> 01:05:56,630
- I've been looking for you.
- Small town. Not a lot of places to look.

721
01:05:56,697 --> 01:05:58,824
Well, I've found quite a few.

722
01:06:00,802 --> 01:06:02,827
You know, Tom had no idea
they were gonna leave.

723
01:06:02,904 --> 01:06:05,566
Actually, he was trying to help.

724
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,337
I think a lot of people would've tried
to help, but they got scared.

725
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,709
They didn't even say goodbye.

726
01:06:13,614 --> 01:06:17,345
I know. I'm sorry.

727
01:06:17,418 --> 01:06:19,750
That's how you know
they're not coming back.

728
01:06:19,821 --> 01:06:23,552
People only say goodbye
when they plan on saying hello again.

729
01:06:23,624 --> 01:06:26,855
It's a rule.

730
01:06:26,928 --> 01:06:29,294
The other kids don't know
if they want to play tomorrow.

731
01:06:29,363 --> 01:06:32,059
They're thinking maybe we should forfeit.

732
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:36,259
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

733
01:06:37,872 --> 01:06:43,640
I think that Juan would want you
to do well in school and in soccer.

734
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:48,444
He wouldn't want me to do well.
He'd want me to win.

735
01:07:31,692 --> 01:07:36,322
One, two. One, two. One, two.

736
01:07:40,635 --> 01:07:44,230
Victory. Yes.

737
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:51,172
Join, my fellow rabbit skins.
I need a victory.

738
01:07:52,346 --> 01:07:56,442
That's the way we say hello. Hello.

739
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:05,124
Go, Big Green!

740
01:08:05,192 --> 01:08:08,093
- What could it be?
- New uniforms!

741
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:13,290
We all pitched in.

742
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:16,996
These are good. There we go.

743
01:08:17,505 --> 01:08:19,700
It's got your name and everything.
Kate, look at that.

744
01:08:19,774 --> 01:08:21,765
Here, put it on.

745
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:28,167
What are you all staring at?
Come on, let's get going.

746
01:08:28,382 --> 01:08:29,781
We gotta have time to warm up.

747
01:09:10,024 --> 01:09:14,620
- I think I'll stay here a while.
- It's the same ball we use at home, son.

748
01:09:14,695 --> 01:09:19,098
I don't think so. Here they kick
a cannonball straight at my head.

749
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:21,267
Get out!

750
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:24,494
Whoo!

751
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:30,773
We look like a bunch of hicks.

752
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:35,339
Well, I hate to break it to you, babe.
We are a bunch of hicks.

753
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:41,816
Come on,
guys, keep it up. Let's go!

754
01:09:46,093 --> 01:09:48,721
- Mr. Huffer.
- Where's the coach?

755
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:51,526
- I'm the coach.
- I mean, uh, Palmer.

756
01:09:51,599 --> 01:09:54,033
Oh, him.
He'll be here in a minute.

757
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:56,467
And where is your star player?

758
01:09:56,537 --> 01:10:01,474
- Oh, now, now. They're all star players.
- We'll see about that.

759
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:03,510
Say, you know we have
a little tradition down here

760
01:10:03,577 --> 01:10:05,772
among the coaches.
Before the final game,

761
01:10:05,846 --> 01:10:08,576
- we always make a little wager.
- Really? What are we betting?

762
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:14,554
Well, now I couldn't take
your money from you, but...

763
01:10:14,622 --> 01:10:17,113
You know I'm divorced.

764
01:10:17,358 --> 01:10:19,292
I wouldn't say no to a kiss.

765
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:25,955
Deal. But if you lose,
you have to kiss our mascot, Ernie.

766
01:10:26,033 --> 01:10:29,628
He's that lovely little green goat
over there. Mm-hm.

767
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:38,107
- He's divorced too.
- Deal.

768
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:44,115
We better not lose.

769
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:50,450
You call this ready to play?
I don't call this ready to play!

770
01:10:51,692 --> 01:10:54,286
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

771
01:10:54,361 --> 01:10:57,853
- He should be here any minute.
- Coach, we need to begin.

772
01:10:58,732 --> 01:11:00,927
Can you give us another five minutes?
We're just sort of waiting for...

773
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:03,367
Now, Coach.
Or we have to call the game.

774
01:11:04,872 --> 01:11:08,501
Well, I guess we have no other choice.
All right.

775
01:11:08,576 --> 01:11:12,910
- OK, guys. Come in!
- Come on, let's go! Come on, Larry!

776
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:17,576
All right, listen, guys.
They won't let us wait any longer.

777
01:11:17,651 --> 01:11:19,175
So if you guys play together,

778
01:11:19,253 --> 01:11:23,314
and you all play as a real team,
we can beat them, all right?

779
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:28,987
- OK. Come on, you guys, let's go.
- One, two, three! Go, Big Green!

780
01:11:29,063 --> 01:11:32,726
Get on out there and kick some... butt!

781
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:43,972
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome
to the Junior Soccer Championships.

782
01:11:44,044 --> 01:11:49,505
Today"s match-up features the Knights
of Austin against Elma Big Green.

783
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:53,075
The Knights are coached by Jay Huffer
and the Elma Big Green

784
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,780
are co-coached by Anna Montgomery
and Tom Ralmer.

785
01:11:57,858 --> 01:12:02,659
The Austin Knights are undefeated. And
The Big Green have a season record of...

786
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:08,691
We can hear something after them now!
Let's see you on your feet for the Knights!

787
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:25,646
And here we go
for the start of the championship.

788
01:12:30,357 --> 01:12:35,488
The Big Green will <i>take</i> the kick-off.
<i>Nick</i> Anderssen kicks off to Rolly Nelson.

789
01:12:39,633 --> 01:12:42,534
Go, go! Take it all the way!

790
01:12:57,818 --> 01:12:59,877
Let's go. Show them!

791
01:12:59,954 --> 01:13:02,616
Oh, bad luck!
That's OK, that's all right.

792
01:13:10,798 --> 01:13:13,926
Ball collected
by Knights" goalie Chris Stoia.

793
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,187
- All right, come on! Let's go!
- Get in there and top them!

794
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:55,097
Yeah! Yeah!

795
01:13:55,175 --> 01:14:00,511
Excellent save
by Elma goalie Larry Musgrove.

796
01:14:12,459 --> 01:14:15,690
That's a goal! Score! Goal!

797
01:14:15,763 --> 01:14:20,860
It"s 2-0 in Austin. Another
put-in by number 2. Shannon Rinn.

798
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:25,462
It"s 2-0 in favor of the Knights.

799
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,750
All right, good. Pass it!

800
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:53,323
- Hey.
- Hey, look who showed up.

801
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,392
- Yeah, yeah! Go! Go!
- All right!

802
01:14:59,907 --> 01:15:04,901
- How are we doing?
- Down by two.

803
01:15:07,514 --> 01:15:10,608
It's good to see you, Ed.

804
01:15:10,684 --> 01:15:13,414
- I'm glad you made it.
- Thanks.

805
01:15:24,231 --> 01:15:26,631
Come on, Kate!

806
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:38,910
Let's go, Kate!
Come on, let's go, Big Green!

807
01:15:41,515 --> 01:15:45,975
And as we head to half, the score
is 2-0, in favor of the Knights.

808
01:15:46,053 --> 01:15:48,851
OK, gentlemen, half time.

809
01:15:48,922 --> 01:15:52,358
We're halfway through the game
we've been building for.

810
01:15:52,426 --> 01:15:55,884
We're halfway there.
We're not all the way there.

811
01:15:55,963 --> 01:15:58,796
The time to gloat
is soon upon the horizon.

812
01:15:58,866 --> 01:16:04,304
I look at the scoreboard and I see
a score that tells me 2-nothing.

813
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:11,036
We're not there yet. This may be the
most important game you'll ever play.

814
01:16:11,278 --> 01:16:14,270
It certainly is the most
important moment of your lives,

815
01:16:14,348 --> 01:16:18,910
and I want you all to remember
one important thing.

816
01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:21,614
Don't mess it up.

817
01:16:21,688 --> 01:16:23,622
- What've you got?
- Goat!

818
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:25,681
- What've you got?
- Goat!

819
01:16:25,759 --> 01:16:28,387
- What are we?
- Goats!

820
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:31,964
So what do you say to a goat?

821
01:16:32,032 --> 01:16:35,490
Barbecue! Barbecue!

822
01:16:35,569 --> 01:16:38,367
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

823
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:40,079
All right.
Tom's gonna be here any minute.

824
01:16:40,307 --> 01:16:43,765
- If he's not here in a minute, why bother?
- You guys are doing great. Trust me.

825
01:16:43,844 --> 01:16:46,335
- 2-0?
- Better than 17-0.

826
01:16:46,413 --> 01:16:49,211
- Hey, I'm having fun.
- That's all that matters.

827
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:51,080
All right, guys, half time's over.
Let's go.

828
01:16:51,318 --> 01:16:56,449
- Come on, let's go, Big Green!
- One, two, three, go Big Green!

829
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:05,989
And here we go
with the start of the second half.

830
01:17:07,468 --> 01:17:11,336
The Knights" Shannon Rinn
will <i>take</i> the kick-off.

831
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:42,502
Goal kick, Big Green.

832
01:17:50,344 --> 01:17:53,142
Watch out, Larry!
Watch him over there! Come on!

833
01:17:57,985 --> 01:17:59,111
Control that ball!

834
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,179
There we are! There we are!

835
01:18:02,256 --> 01:18:05,817
Come on, y'all.
Let's do it again!

836
01:18:18,372 --> 01:18:19,566
Call a foul!

837
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,803
Number 14. <i>Tak</i> Yamato.
Collides with number 8. Buddy Abbey.

838
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:25,367
This could be a foul.

839
01:18:27,014 --> 01:18:28,675
Ten minutes till curtains.

840
01:18:28,749 --> 01:18:32,480
Maybe, but you're a whole lifetime away
from having a brain.

841
01:18:32,553 --> 01:18:33,679
It <i>looks like</i> we have an
injury.

842
01:18:33,754 --> 01:18:35,949
All right, come on, clear, clear.

843
01:18:36,023 --> 01:18:39,322
Hey, give me some room here, come
on, come on. The boy needs to breathe.

844
01:18:39,393 --> 01:18:40,917
Which leg is it, huh?

845
01:18:40,994 --> 01:18:43,326
- Broken? Broken?
- No, I don't think so.

846
01:18:43,397 --> 01:18:44,694
No? No. All right.

847
01:18:44,765 --> 01:18:48,064
I hope he's all right.
I'm sure he's all right.

848
01:18:48,135 --> 01:18:50,968
- Cookie!
- Hey, hey. Look who's here!

849
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:54,132
He found him!

850
01:18:55,142 --> 01:18:57,440
- Oh, my gosh! Brenda, he's here!
- He's here!

851
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:05,410
Juan! Juan!

852
01:19:12,426 --> 01:19:13,654
And it seems we have a late arrival.

853
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:18,096
Number 10. listed on the roster
as Juan Morales.

854
01:19:18,332 --> 01:19:22,132
- Kate, I came back to beat these guys!
- You didn't say goodbye.

855
01:19:22,369 --> 01:19:27,807
- Don't be mad. I wanted to.
- Well, next time you go, say goodbye.

856
01:19:27,874 --> 01:19:30,570
Next time I go, I'll just take you with me.

857
01:19:30,644 --> 01:19:32,874
Juan!

858
01:19:39,019 --> 01:19:42,079
Hey, found 'em outside Garretville.

859
01:19:42,322 --> 01:19:43,812
It looked like a good place to hide,

860
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:47,724
- but he's already got a better plan...
- Already got them a lawyer.

861
01:19:47,794 --> 01:19:49,091
Tom's gonna be my sponsor.

862
01:19:49,329 --> 01:19:51,490
Well, I figure if I'm gonna be
living in a little town like Elma,

863
01:19:51,565 --> 01:19:52,896
I gotta get good people there with me.

864
01:19:52,966 --> 01:19:56,595
What's that, huh? What's that?
Come on, come on, delay of game!

865
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:58,310
- Come on, call it!
- Take it easy, Coach.

866
01:19:58,338 --> 01:20:00,067
Hey, listen, what am I?
Card 'em! Card 'em!

867
01:20:00,307 --> 01:20:02,332
They shouldn't be on the field like that!

868
01:20:02,409 --> 01:20:04,468
Coach, are those your assistants
back there?

869
01:20:04,544 --> 01:20:05,568
Yeah.

870
01:20:05,646 --> 01:20:09,844
You might wanna tell
one of them to start warming up.

871
01:20:10,017 --> 01:20:11,882
Am I the luckiest man in the world,
or what?

872
01:20:11,952 --> 01:20:14,079
Just when I need a decent ref,
I get a comedian.

873
01:20:14,321 --> 01:20:16,789
A comedian! Well, thank you.

874
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:18,757
Whoever did that for me, thank you.

875
01:20:18,825 --> 01:20:22,317
Oh, man, what a day.
What a day.

876
01:20:22,396 --> 01:20:25,422
Oh, so you made it, Coach.

877
01:20:25,499 --> 01:20:28,662
Yeah, I had to pick up
the last member of my team, Jay.

878
01:20:28,735 --> 01:20:32,102
I thought everybody qualified
to be here was already here.

879
01:20:32,339 --> 01:20:36,969
Everyone qualifies.
And so do their families.

880
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:41,737
Hey...
Now we got ourselves a real game.

881
01:20:49,956 --> 01:20:53,084
Ugh. Has anyone seen my mother?

882
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,423
The Knights" number 8.
Buddy Abbey. Is OK. Rlay will resume.

883
01:20:59,599 --> 01:21:02,625
And it looks like we have
a substitution for the Big Green.

884
01:21:02,703 --> 01:21:08,164
Replacing number 11. Jeffrey Luttrell.
Will be number 10. Juan Morales.

885
01:21:35,402 --> 01:21:38,462
Ball knocked out by
the Big Green. Knights" throw in.

886
01:21:42,642 --> 01:21:50,071
Kicked out by goalie Stoia. And
a magnificent header by Juan Morales.

887
01:22:00,393 --> 01:22:02,418
Control it!

888
01:22:02,496 --> 01:22:08,833
Rossession changes. Superb play
by Big Green number 85. Newt Shaw.

889
01:22:09,936 --> 01:22:12,063
Pick your man!

890
01:22:12,305 --> 01:22:17,766
Morales to Kate Douglas. She passes
<i>back.</i> They"re going in to the net.

891
01:22:18,845 --> 01:22:22,872
<i>Nick</i> Anderssen now has the ball.
He takes a shot. Goal!

892
01:22:22,949 --> 01:22:28,444
It"s now Knights 2. Big Green 1.
With only minutes left in the game.

893
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,496
Come on, where are my Knights?
Where's the defense?

894
01:22:42,903 --> 01:22:47,465
Knights <i>take</i> the kick-off.
We"re in the final minute of play.

895
01:22:52,412 --> 01:22:57,372
Big tackle from Juan Morales.
Big Green now has the ball.

896
01:23:01,388 --> 01:23:04,755
<i>We have just ten seconds left in this
game!</i>

897
01:23:04,825 --> 01:23:10,855
Juan Morales is going for the goal with
only five seconds remaining in the game!

898
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:14,833
He shoots. Goal! Goal!

899
01:23:14,901 --> 01:23:18,769
<i>With three seconds left on the clock.</i>
Juan Morales scored the tying shot!

900
01:23:18,839 --> 01:23:23,367
You guessed it! <i>We</i> have a tie!
The Big Green battles <i>back!</i>

901
01:23:23,443 --> 01:23:27,311
Ladies and gentlemen. Don"t go
anywhere. This game is not over!

902
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:31,441
The Big Green is going nuts!
The Knights are stunned!

903
01:23:31,518 --> 01:23:37,320
It is a tie!
Big Green 2. Knights 2.

904
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:49,131
You all rock! What a game!

905
01:23:59,045 --> 01:24:03,004
Regulation game has ended in a tie.
There's not gonna be any overtime.

906
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:05,074
We're gonna go straight to penalty kicks.

907
01:24:05,318 --> 01:24:07,616
OK, what we got here
is called a shoot-out, all right?

908
01:24:07,687 --> 01:24:09,780
Five members from each team
are gonna run on to the field,

909
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,414
each one's gonna take a shot
against the goalie.

910
01:24:11,491 --> 01:24:15,120
- So Juan'll kick five times?
- No, each player can only kick once.

911
01:24:15,195 --> 01:24:16,856
Right.
But Juan, you're going first.

912
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,522
- Mm-hm.
- Go get 'em.

913
01:24:18,598 --> 01:24:21,089
Then Kate.

914
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:25,168
- Then, uh... Nick.
- All right.

915
01:24:25,238 --> 01:24:27,706
- Then Sophia.
- Mm-hm.

916
01:24:27,774 --> 01:24:29,765
Uh-huh.

917
01:24:29,843 --> 01:24:31,777
OK, I need a volunteer
for the last position.

918
01:24:31,845 --> 01:24:33,574
I'll do it.

919
01:24:35,448 --> 01:24:40,852
- I don't think so, Newt.
- Why? I got a great kick.

920
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:44,049
And I'm not afraid.

921
01:24:45,358 --> 01:24:47,918
- What do you think?
- I'm little.

922
01:24:47,994 --> 01:24:52,590
I'm low to the ground.
I got power. I got the moves.

923
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:55,396
I'm your man.

924
01:24:59,706 --> 01:25:02,937
- You got the job, big guy.
- All right, you guys are the greatest!

925
01:25:03,009 --> 01:25:05,375
Time-out. Time-out.

926
01:25:05,445 --> 01:25:09,040
Now that we know who's kicking,
who's gonna play goalie? I'm not!

927
01:25:09,282 --> 01:25:12,649
You guys know about my problem.
They turn into monsters.

928
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,584
Larry, listen...

929
01:25:14,654 --> 01:25:18,090
If you see them
and they become monsters,

930
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:21,726
just become part of the nightmare
and join in.

931
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:24,389
Turn yourself into a monster and fight
back.

932
01:25:24,464 --> 01:25:27,797
- I'll try.
- All right. You can do it, son!

933
01:25:27,867 --> 01:25:31,030
Now you all played a great game.
If you do miss your shots,

934
01:25:31,104 --> 01:25:33,834
you run back to that center circle
with your heads held high, got it?

935
01:25:33,907 --> 01:25:36,000
Got it! Let's go!

936
01:25:36,076 --> 01:25:38,704
- Are you all proud of yourselves?
- Yeah!

937
01:25:38,778 --> 01:25:42,043
- Good! We're proud of you.
- All right!

938
01:25:42,282 --> 01:25:44,045
- Come on!
- Let's go.

939
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:50,552
One, two, three! Go, Big Green!

940
01:25:58,732 --> 01:26:02,259
Larry, want my goggles?
They get rid of fear.

941
01:26:02,335 --> 01:26:04,428
I'll try anything.

942
01:26:19,285 --> 01:26:20,775
Knights, OK.

943
01:26:20,854 --> 01:26:25,382
And the Knights
win the toss and elect to go first.

944
01:26:38,438 --> 01:26:44,172
First up for the Knights,
number 7, Robert Bishop.

945
01:26:49,449 --> 01:26:53,613
Come on, Larry, come on.
Buddy, hang in there! Hang in there!

946
01:27:00,326 --> 01:27:03,818
And it"s good. The score
is 1-0 in favor of the Knights!

947
01:27:03,897 --> 01:27:06,764
- What a shoot-out.
- It's all right, Larry.

948
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:11,668
Up next, number 10, Juan Morales.

949
01:27:13,473 --> 01:27:16,965
He scored the equalizer.
Can he do it again?

950
01:27:28,054 --> 01:27:34,357
He does! The score is tied.
One round. 1- 1!

951
01:27:38,832 --> 01:27:42,324
The second kicker for the Knights
is number 2. Shannon Rinn.

952
01:27:43,636 --> 01:27:47,072
It "s in. It" s in there!
The Knights now lead 2- 1.

953
01:27:47,307 --> 01:27:49,502
Darn!

954
01:27:49,576 --> 01:27:55,378
Up for the Big Green.
Number 13. Kate Douglas.

955
01:27:55,448 --> 01:27:59,282
Come on, let's go, Kate!
Let's go!

956
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:11,058
It "s good! It" s in! The score is now tied.
Knights 2. Big Green 2.

957
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:21,500
Up next for the Knights.
Anthony Atkinson.

958
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:31,176
That's it, it's in!
3-2 for the Knights!

959
01:28:40,393 --> 01:28:45,695
Up next for the Big Green.
Number 9. Sophia Convertino.

960
01:28:45,765 --> 01:28:48,791
Come on, Sophie.

961
01:28:54,407 --> 01:28:59,504
It"s good! What a crazy game!
<i>We"re still tied here in Austin!</i>

962
01:29:07,487 --> 01:29:10,854
There are only two kickers left for each
side.

963
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:15,992
She did it! That's it!
She scored!

964
01:29:16,062 --> 01:29:21,659
The fourth kicker is up for the Knights.
Number 8. Buddy Abbey.

965
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:27,064
Come on, Larry. Come on.

966
01:29:31,844 --> 01:29:34,836
He blocked it! No goal!

967
01:29:34,914 --> 01:29:39,510
Goalkeeper Larry Musgrove
sets up a huge opportunity for victory.

968
01:29:39,586 --> 01:29:43,682
You did it! You did it! Yeah!

969
01:29:47,827 --> 01:29:51,058
Yes! Yeah!

970
01:29:57,303 --> 01:29:59,601
Come on, Nick!
