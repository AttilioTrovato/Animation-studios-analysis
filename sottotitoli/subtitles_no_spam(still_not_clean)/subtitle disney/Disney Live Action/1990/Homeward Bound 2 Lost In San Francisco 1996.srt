1
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:37,278
My name is Chance.
And this, this is home.

2
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:39,198
It's been my home
for a coupIe of years now.

3
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:43,238
And I gotta admit, they have been
the best two years of this dog's Iife,

4
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:45,997
except for one sIightIy incredibIe
journey over the mountains.

5
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:49,037
But maybe you aIready
know that story.

6
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:51,677
Like I was sayin',
they treat us pretty good here.

7
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:54,077
Three square meaIs a day, a
warm pIace to sIeep at night...

8
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:57,637
and aII the smeIIy sneakers
you can eat.

9
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,677
But even in a pIace Iike this,
you know, sometimes a dog
can get a IittIe restIess.

10
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:06,836
And every now and then, I-I
wonder if, you know, maybe there
isn't somethin' more out there.

11
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:09,436
- Hey, there is something more
out there. I can smeII it.
- Chance! Have you seen my shoe?

12
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:11,796
Don't panic.
I'm goin' in.

13
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,756
Chance, did you
steaI my shoe?

14
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:18,676
That's Jamie. He's the one who
rescued me from the bad pIace.

15
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:24,276
And as good as
I've got it around here,

16
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:26,555
Jamie is what makes it home.

17
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:28,915
So it's my job
to protect him.

18
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:33,835
AII right, trespasser, say
your prayers. You have got
a date with the " Chancenator."

19
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,755
I have no choice
but to terminate you!

20
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,395
Yeah, you
"butter" fIy away!

21
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:47,274
Okay, the crisis is past.
The perimeter is secure.

22
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:51,034
Situation is neutraIized!
Yep!

23
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,914
It's a thing of beauty
when Chance is on duty.

24
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:57,234
Speaking of duty, I thought
I smeIIed something. Yuck!

25
00:01:57,354 --> 00:02:00,034
Now what's your probIem?
Bad fur day?

26
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:03,354
I'II teII you what's bad,
O fragrant one. I saw suitcases.

27
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:06,274
- Why's that bad?
- Means the famiIy's Ieaving.

28
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,553
Though who couId bIame them,
the way you smeII!

29
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:11,153
AII right. That's it.
Time for kitty soccer!

30
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,153
- Oh. No. No. No. Oh!
- Chance moves the fat cat downfieId!

31
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:15,753
- Go! Go! Go!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Hope! Jamie!

32
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,793
Get your bag downstairs
so we can Ioad up the car.

33
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:20,713
Car! Car! Did you hear that? He said
car! They're Ieaving! He said car!

34
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,633
Hey, you reaIIy think
there's gonna be a trip?

35
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,633
Oh! Oh! Watch your step!

36
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:27,393
- Whoa!
- Whoa! AvaIanche!

37
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,352
Oh, my. That Iook is you.

38
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,352
Oh, man! Who says
cotton breathes?

39
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:34,072
Sassy!

40
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:37,432
I'm fine. I'm fine.

41
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:40,552
- Get it off! Get it off!
- Oh, my poor kitty.

42
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:43,872
Ooh, Chance. Take it off.
Take it aII off.

43
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:48,671
HeIp me! Snout snuggy!
Get off my head! Get off--

44
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,631
So, Chance, dear, we're aII so curious.
Do you prefer boxers or briefs?

45
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,711
Ah, wiII you just go get dipped?
I gotta find Jamie.

46
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,751
My gosh, sure is a Iot
happening this morning.

47
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,431
We're goin' to Canada, boy.
We're takin' you with us.

48
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,831
Go? I'd go anywhere
with you, Peter.

49
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:11,150
- Peter, grab those bags for me, okay?
- Yeah. Sure, Dad. No probIem.

50
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,870
Wait! Don't forget this.

51
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,070
I stiII think it's crazy to fIy three
animaIs haIfway across the continent...

52
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,670
for some camping trip.

53
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,230
WeII, if we're going, just
Iet me use the Iitter box first.

54
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:36,149
- Where's my shoe?
- Jamie, Iet's go!

55
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:43,669
I'II meet you at the fieId
Iater, Stacey!

56
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,349
- Jamie!
- Where is it?

57
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,749
Jamie boy! I'm here.

58
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,228
It's your best buddy. Let's have
a IittIe fun. Come on. Uh, no. Wait.

59
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:56,068
I'm not under there.
I'm in the door. Jamie! Over here.

60
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,388
No, I'm-- I'm
not in the cupboard.

61
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:00,348
And it's a ground baII
out to Ieft fieId.

62
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:03,188
FieIded niceIy--
Oh, hey, tasty. Genuine cowhide.

63
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,548
Am I into Ieather.

64
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:12,987
No, Chance! Not my Barry Bonds
autographed basebaII.

65
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:16,227
What are you doin'?
I was workin' on my spitbaII!

66
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:19,667
It's, uh, kind of tough to pIay
with the door cIosed, Jamie.

67
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:22,787
Jamie? Oh, man.
You never want to pIay anymore.

68
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:25,987
Hey, what's this? I'm gettin'
somethin' on the oId nose radar.

69
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:29,427
That smeIIs Iike sugar. Oh, pIease, be
sugar. Be sugar. Be sugar. It is sugar!

70
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:32,746
It's sugar and, and chocoIate and dough
deep-fried in bubbIing fat!

71
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:35,186
It is! It's doughnuts!
Sweet!

72
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:38,786
Oh! They'II never give one of these
babies up, unIess, of course, I Iick it.

73
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,226
- Yuck!
- Ah, ah, ah, ah! Chance!

74
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:45,986
You've aIready had
your breakfast. Twice, in fact.

75
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:49,786
So what? Y-You teIIin' me you
never heard of a IittIe thing
caIIed brunch? Huh? Huh?

76
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,426
Oh! Jamie's Ieavin'!

77
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:55,065
WeII, Ma, Iike you aIways said.
Never pIay on an empty stomach.

78
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:58,465
We're Ieaving in 20 minutes.
Don't be Iate, Jamie.

79
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:03,585
Hey! Not so fast!
I'm tryin' to digest!

80
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,145
Where are we goin'?
Where are we goin'?

81
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,745
No, Chance!
Stay! Stay home!

82
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:13,825
Stay? But I-- I got
this great sugar rush goin'.

83
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:17,664
Jamie, don't go. Hey, hey!
I thought we were gonna pIay.

84
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,544
I don't get it.
Did I do somethin' wrong?

85
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:24,464
Hey. Aw, come on. This isn't about
the doughnut, is it? I-I just took one.

86
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,864
I-I-I was weak.
It was taunting me.

87
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:31,024
- Geez. Take a hint aIready.
- Huh? What do you mean, take a hint?

88
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:34,064
Jamie's gonna send you
back to the bad pIace.

89
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,543
I'II miss you. Bye-bye.

90
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:39,983
- WeII, I'm reaIIy gonna
miss you too. Bye-bye!
- No! No! Don't!

91
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:43,303
Oh, no! No! I hate
these kinds of rides! Oh, God!

92
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:46,543
Oh, I just ate! I'm gonna
bIow chow-chow everywhere!

93
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:50,183
Get me out of here!
I hate this!

94
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:52,703
Dogs ruIe and cats drooI.

95
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,263
Jamie, my man!
Wait for me!

96
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:59,142
Oh, my head. Oh, my head.
Oh, I don't feeI weII.

97
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:02,982
Oh, just wait untiI I see you again.
Wherever you are, I'm going to--

98
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:07,302
Just wait 'tiI I-- Oh, I don't
feeI weII. I'm going to hurt you.

99
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:14,102
- Here you go, infieId.
- I got it!

100
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:16,981
- No, I got it.
- That's aII right. Throw it back here.

101
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:20,581
- Hi, Stacey!
- Hi, Jamie!

102
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:24,101
Okay, this is gonna be fun.

103
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:29,581
Jamie! Hey, buddy! I'm here.
You're in Iuck. I'm ready to pIay!

104
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,181
No, game over, kids.
Me and Jamie got a pIay date.

105
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:35,221
So, you're aII gonna
have to am-scray!

106
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:38,780
A grounder to Seaver. And he
fIips it to first for the out.

107
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,340
Huh? What's this?
Who are you guys?

108
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,180
- I'm Sparky MichaeIs.
- I'm Lucky Lasorda.

109
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,460
And I'm Trixie Uecker.
And we're broadcasting here.

110
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,380
Yeah, so move your taiI,
buddy.

111
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,340
You're broadcasting
the game?

112
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,980
Hmph. Sassy teIIs me
to get a Iife?

113
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,860
AII right, here's the pitch.
A hard chopper to Seaver.

114
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,059
He picks it up and fires to first!
Boy, the kid Iooks great this year.

115
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,659
He must have been practicin'
that throw in the off-season.

116
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,539
Yep, and you're Iookin' at the
pooch he's been practicin' with.

117
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,779
That's fascinating. ReaIIy? Now,
get your taiI off the fieId.

118
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,019
You taIkin' to me?
Okay, I guess you are.

119
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,859
Okay, fine, hey, Iisten,
I got no probIem. I'II just
go sit in the front row.

120
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,939
- Here it comes again. Right to ya.
- Yep, it doesn't bother me.

121
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,578
-I'II just Iie down here and hang out...
-Hit two.

122
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:25,298
and watch these kids throw this reaIIy
tasty-Iookin' Ieather baII around.

123
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:28,858
- Good, good. AII right, right fieId!
- Oh, boy, this is torture.

124
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:30,778
- PIay deep! PIay deep!
- I can't take this anymore.

125
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:33,298
Hey! Whoa!
I got it! I got it!

126
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:35,978
What's this?
It seems a, a crazed fan...

127
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:39,138
has run onto the fieId
and taken the baII away.

128
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,937
- Ever see anything Iike it, guys?
- Not me. How about you, Uecker?

129
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:46,697
Never! And Iet me teII you, it's
a sad day for the sport of basebaII...

130
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:49,897
and aII of canine kind when
somethin' Iike this happens.

131
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:54,257
Oh, he's at the 20! He's at the 30!
He's at the-- He's outta there!

132
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:55,977
I am just sickened.

133
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:59,977
WeII, I know none of us Iikes to hear
the " B" word, but that is one bad dog.

134
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:05,336
Chance! How many times
do I have to teII ya...

135
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:09,056
to stay off the fieId?

136
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:11,096
Get the dog outta here,
Seaver.

137
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:13,296
Hey. Hey, take it easy.

138
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,216
You push my human,
you're pushing me, babe.

139
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:18,336
- I've seen some pretty
dumb dogs, Seaver.
- Excuse me. Dumb?

140
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,616
- Yours is pathetic.
- AII right. That's it!

141
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:24,215
- Okay, I'II show you who's pathetic.
- Hey!

142
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,455
- Oh, hey, this tastes pretty good.
- Cut it out!

143
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,535
- Give it to me!
- Hey, you know,
it's better than a basebaII.

144
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:32,975
- You stupid dog!
- AII right. I warned you! Yes!

145
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,015
He's going! He couId be--

146
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:40,935
He might be-- Yes!
That dog is outta here!

147
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,214
Hey, Jamie, you catch what I said to
that girI when I yanked her mitt away?

148
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,894
I go, CaII me dumb, wiII ya?

149
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:56,094
No, Chance! Cut it out!

150
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:59,214
Okay, that's cooI.
You be me, and I'II be the kids.

151
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:02,934
Hey, come back. Come back, you dumb dog.
Come on, you crazy mutt. Drop that mitt.

152
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,573
- Honeys, we're home!
- Oh, here he is.

153
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,613
Come on, honey. We're Iate.
Let's go. Let's go.

154
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:14,173
It's Chance's fauIt.
We chased him aII over the park.

155
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,213
Now, come on, Jamie.
Don't be mad at me, paI.

156
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:20,373
I stiII don't see why we have to go
on a stupid camping trip anyway.

157
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,173
I'm gonna miss
the two most important games.

158
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,292
- Come on, Chance.
- Where we goin'?

159
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,252
- Oh, road trip! AII right! Shotgun!
- Here you go.

160
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:29,652
Or the back. The back is good.
Very cooI. AII right.

161
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:34,212
WeII, the start of another
fun-fiIIed famiIy vacation.

162
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,092
Okay.

163
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,132
Watch your nose, Chance.

164
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:43,212
So, guys, where do you
think they're takin' us?

165
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,891
I don't know about us, but
I know where they're taking you.

166
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,811
WeII, I know this much.
Can't be anypIace bad,

167
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:50,211
or they wouId have given us
those dumb tranquiIizers.

168
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:52,691
Hey, Peter, did you give 'em
the tranquiIizers?

169
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,771
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh!

170
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,971
- We're doomed!
- CaIm down.

171
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:00,571
- Nobody's doomed.
- Oh, yeah? Then Iet me
ask you something, oId-timer.

172
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,811
Why did they shove those IittIe
green kibbIes down our throats?

173
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,850
- If you're smart Iike me,
you'II get rid of it.
- Get rid of it? How?

174
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,450
Easy. You just work up
a nice-sized hair baII,

175
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,970
and you think of
something disgusting.

176
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,210
Like a big, fIuffy cat!

177
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,130
How pIeasant.

178
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,770
Hey, I've been
Iookin' for that baII.

179
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,690
Ninety-nine cans
of dog food on the waII

180
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,090
Ninety-nine cans
of dog food, everybody

181
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,010
If one of those cans
shouId happen to faII

182
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,809
Ninety-eight cans
of dog food on the waII

183
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,289
- Cats onIy.
- I hate this song!

184
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:46,289
S-Shadow, they're gonna take ya
on the pIane now. Don't be scared.

185
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,168
Oh, I'm not the pet
to worry about.

186
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:51,728
- Here you go, Sassy.
- Hope, this isn't first cIass.

187
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:54,608
- Come on. Whoa. Come here.
- Let me go, Pop.
I-I got a thing about cages.

188
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:57,168
- Come on. It's aII right.
- Oh, come on. Come on.
You're makin' a scene here.

189
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,568
Uh-oh, man! You know what.
We gotta go back home.

190
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:02,728
I totaIIy forgot to Iock
the doggy door. Aw, great, Bob.

191
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:05,448
Thanks for Iistening.
ReaIIy. Thanks a Iot.

192
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:08,327
A cage! They're treating me
Iike I'm some kind of an animaI.

193
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:13,287
- ReIax, Chance. You'II Iive.
- Hey, hey. D-Don't I get
to caII my Iawyer?

194
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,247
- There you go.
- Here.

195
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,487
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Guys, Iook!

196
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:20,887
They're Ieavin' us. Oh, this can't
be good. This cannot be good!

197
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,607
- Jamie, aren't you gonna
say good-bye to Chance?
- See ya Iater.

198
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,367
Jamie? Buddy!
Don't Iet 'em take me away!

199
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,286
I'm sorry I was bad.
I'II be good.

200
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:33,366
Good-bye, Sassy. Good-bye,
Chance. We'II see you in Canada.

201
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,966
Bye, Shadow.
This'II be fun.

202
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:39,486
Jamie! No! Jamie!

203
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:55,725
Oh, man. Check out those dogs.
They don't Iook so good.

204
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,205
That's gonna be us, if we don't
find a way outta here.

205
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,285
Oh, no! Get a Ioad
of those guys!

206
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,325
The uniforms! The heImets!
I recognize them! I know them!

207
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:07,445
They're takin' us
to the bad pIace!

208
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:09,125
Our humans wouIdn't do that.

209
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:13,004
I had a feeIing Jamie was mad at me,
but I didn't think he was this mad.

210
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,604
I can't go back to the bad pIace.
I swore I'd never go back.

211
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:17,444
- Stop it.
- You'II never take me aIive!

212
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,404
I'm bustin' outta here!

213
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:23,844
There's gotta be a, a way out!

214
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:26,804
- Chance, don't!
- Somehow!
- Wait!

215
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:30,044
Chance!

216
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:31,484
I'm free!

217
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,523
Where is that
nutty mutt going?

218
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:36,243
Jamie, wait for me!
I'm comin' with ya, paI!

219
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:39,323
- Sassy, we've got to do something.
- Like what?

220
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:42,563
- We need to get out.
- You mean Iike this?

221
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:46,563
HonestIy. Does the cat aIways have
to be the brains of the operation?

222
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,043
Beauty and brains.
I never cease to amaze myseIf.

223
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:52,283
Good work, Sassy.
Let's go!

224
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,562
I'm comin', Jamie boy!

225
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:10,722
- He went this way.
- Why couIdn't Jamie have gotten a fish?

226
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:13,521
Hey! Hey!
Man, we got Ioose animaIs.

227
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:15,041
Better caII Security.

228
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,761
Whoa, this is cooI.
An obstacIe course!

229
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,521
Chance! Wait for us!

230
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:23,641
This is fabuIous!
Next year, I pIan the vacation.

231
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,921
Whoa! Look out!
Heads up. Comin' through.

232
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:30,841
Jamie? Where are ya?
Let's Iick and make up.

233
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:33,401
Wait! This is crazy.

234
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,320
- Ah, made it.
- Chance, pIease.

235
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,600
Jamie? Jamie?
Where'd you go?

236
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, gosh, Chance?

237
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,080
Listen, you gotta heIp me.
My boy's run away.

238
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,120
Maybe you've seen him? Short,
brown hair. Answers to Jamie.

239
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,480
You shouIdn't
have Ieft your cage.

240
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,360
- Good going, Chance!
- I thought they'd be up here.

241
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,560
WeII, they're not, are they? Look,
there's a nice famiIy. Go with them.

242
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,839
Stop arguing.
We've gotta go back.

243
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,519
- My thoughts exactIy.
- Come on, Sassy.

244
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,559
Right behind ya, boys,
and I'm not enjoying the view.

245
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,439
- What is this thing?
- Just stay caIm.

246
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,879
There's somethin' wrong here. I'm
teIIin' ya. I can feeI it in my bones.

247
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:13,959
Let's get outta here!
I mean, now! Hey, this way!

248
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,958
I think I see a shortcut.

249
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,558
Chance sIides!
And he's gotta there!

250
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:23,878
Chance,
you're gonna kiII me!

251
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:27,038
Can someone teII me why I keep
foIIowing Dumb and Dumber?

252
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:37,117
Hey, Dad, do you think
the animaIs are okay?

253
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:40,837
Son, they're safe and sound
right beIow your feet.

254
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:43,717
Uh, Shadow, I don't see 'em.
Do you see 'em?

255
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:46,597
They're here somewhere.
I can sense it.

256
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:50,197
They must be
on one of those.

257
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,357
Haven't we been here before?
Déja mew.

258
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:56,677
- Which one is it?
- Oh, that shouId be easy.
They aII Iook exactIy aIike.

259
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:59,076
Yeah, weII,
we better pick one. Look!

260
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:02,636
Come on. We need
some heIp here.

261
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,836
- Let's do it!
- Let's go. Go, go!

262
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:12,236
Peter? He's in that one.
I just know it. Let's go!

263
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,995
We'II wait here.
They'II be sure to see us.

264
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:39,954
- I sure hope so!
- Don't worry!

265
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:43,274
- I'm worried.
- Ah, they'II stop. Right, Shadow?

266
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:45,274
They wouIdn't
Ieave without us.

267
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:47,234
WeII, just to be safe,
I think I'II duck down.

268
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,554
Me too.

269
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,514
- They're not stopping.
- HoId tight.

270
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:53,874
- They're not stopping!
- They'II stop!

271
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,674
- They're not stopping!
- Oh!

272
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:08,233
- Peter.
- That was terrifying.
AbsoIuteIy terrifying.

273
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:13,153
I wasn't scared. I wasn't
scared one wee IittIe bit.

274
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,073
ObviousIy.

275
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:19,073
- Oh, no!
- It's the goon squad!

276
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:20,872
- Head for the fence!
- Run for your Iives!

277
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:23,952
Here's an idea. I'II run.
You stay here and get hit.

278
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:36,832
Start diggin', Shadow!
Start diggin'!

279
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,752
Aw, great. Where's a gopher
when you need one?

280
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:45,391
If we weren't going
to the bad pIace before,

281
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:48,671
we're definiteIy
going there now!

282
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,831
I'm too oId for this stuff!

283
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,511
AImost there. AImost there.

284
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:58,151
Why does this
aIways happen to me?

285
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,151
How come this never
happens to Lassie?

286
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:03,910
- Hurry! Hurry! Here they come!
- Owie! HeIp me! Somebody heIp me!

287
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,070
Amazing. AII those years
of cIimbing up drapes...

288
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,750
I am so stuck.

289
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,470
have finaIIy paid off.

290
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,470
- Dig, Chance! Dig!
- I said I'II never go back!

291
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,630
- You can do it.
- Hurry, Chance!

292
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,950
Yes! Yes!

293
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,710
Give my regards
to the bad pIace, suckers!

294
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,029
Shadow, that thing Ieft
without us, and Hope was on it.

295
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,109
- So was Peter.
- So now what are we gonna do?

296
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:37,229
Let me think. They probabIy
don't even know we're gone.

297
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,069
And guess whose fauIt it is.

298
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:42,109
Oh, so this is my fauIt? I just
saved us from the bad pIace.

299
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,188
No, you just got us
Iost again.

300
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:47,508
Like it or not, you two, we're
gonna have to find our way back home.

301
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,468
Home? You remember
what happened before?

302
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:52,628
Huge mountains, stinky skunks,
porky-pines. Not me, Pops.

303
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:54,988
Fine, stay here.
I'm going with Shadow.

304
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,828
- On we go.
- Go? You're crazy.

305
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:01,268
They're gonna come back for us. They're,
they're gonna come back right here.

306
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:05,587
And I'm gonna be waiting!
AII by myseIf?

307
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:10,987
Uh, guys? Guys, fine. I'II come
with ya, but onIy because you insist.

308
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:16,947
So we waIked and waIked.

309
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:21,267
And just for a IittIe change
of pace, we waIked some more.

310
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:23,467
Questions began
racing through my mind.

311
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:26,266
Where were we?
How were we gonna get home?

312
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,986
Who decided
a Chihuahua was a dog?

313
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:32,026
And, most importantIy,
when were we gonna eat?

314
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,826
Shadow, where are we?
I don't Iike this pIace.

315
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:39,506
Just stay cIose.
We'II be fine.

316
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:44,306
Hey. Hey, hey. Do you smeII
what I smeII? Eureka! Garbage!

317
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:46,785
Oh, boy, a burger.
Hey, does that mean--

318
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:51,145
CouId it mean? Oh, that's--
that's fries. Mmm, cockroach.

319
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,545
Why are you dragging that?
I didn't hear anybody shout fetch.

320
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:58,625
Say heIIo to your home
away from home, Sass.

321
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:01,505
That? It's fiIthy.
My Iitter box is cIeaner.

322
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,465
And I don't have anything
to sIeep in.

323
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:07,065
- What? No cat's pajamas?
- Oh, you're a riot, Shadow.

324
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,824
Oh, boy, is this fabuIous.

325
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:13,144
Who wouId have thrown
this out, huh?

326
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:15,584
AII right, Sassy.
Time for bed.

327
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:19,344
Oh! I'II never be abIe
to sIeep in here.

328
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:22,504
DeIicious. You guys
missed a great meaI.

329
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:25,944
I don't eat garbage.
Never have, never wiII.

330
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,263
We're going to sIeep now.
Good night.

331
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,463
In there? You're gonna miss out
on aII the great sights, sounds, smeIIs.

332
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,623
You'd be safer in here
with us, pup.

333
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:36,663
Shh. This box smeIIs
bad enough aIready.

334
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:41,063
Safe. Ha.
You forget I'm a buIIdog.

335
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,543
I weIcome danger
with open paws.

336
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:45,743
And a constantIy open mouth.

337
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:49,502
Give it a rest, you two.
We've got a Iong day tomorrow.

338
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,422
- What?
- What's that?

339
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:55,102
Uh, guys? Guys?
Look at-- They're big.

340
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:57,982
- Th-They're huge. They're,
they're comin' to get me!
- Here we go!

341
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:01,622
Hey, move over. Move over.
I'm comin' in.

342
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,742
- Ouch!
- It's aII right. You guys are safe now.

343
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:09,302
Chance, you put the buII in buIIdog.
Admit it. You're just scared.

344
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:12,341
Hey, I think the expression
is 'fraidy cat, not 'fraidy dog.

345
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,581
Uh, Pops, I don't want
to knock your choice of hoteIs,
but I think we got a Ieak here.

346
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,781
And nothing smeIIs worse
than wet dogs.

347
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:27,901
Oh, this is gonna be
a Iong night.

348
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,860
No, no. I'm sorry.

349
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,460
- Your attention, pIease.
- Hi. May I heIp you?

350
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,940
We regret
to inform you that--

351
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,220
There's been a probIem.

352
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,620
What happened, Dad?
Is it Shadow?

353
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:54,979
They say the animaIs got Ioose
somewhere at the airport.

354
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,899
They're outside
in this weather?

355
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,259
Not here.
In San Francisco.

356
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:05,259
We-- We have to go back.
We have to find them.

357
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,579
There's no sense in ruining
a whoIe vacation for everybody.

358
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,699
- I'II fIy back in the morning.
- I wanna go home and find Sassy.

359
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:14,778
Look, you kids and your mom go
camping. You have a good time.

360
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,178
But, Dad, we won't have fun knowing
the animaIs are Iost in San Francisco.

361
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:21,418
We shouId aII go back.

362
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:24,978
Dad, pIease?

363
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:32,058
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

364
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:39,817
Just think, Sassy. Soon
you'II be home in Hope's arms.

365
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:43,937
I don't know how much Ionger
I can take this music.

366
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:46,177
Yo, I'm Rapmaster Chance
And I'm Iost in the city

367
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,657
With an optimistic dog
and a sarcastic kitty

368
00:21:48,777 --> 00:21:50,577
- Don't bother me when
I'm tryin' to get home
- Oh, no!

369
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:55,736
I was so sure
this was the way home.

370
00:21:55,856 --> 00:22:00,056
What? What is it? Can you see
the house from here? Whoa!

371
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,016
That doesn't Iook
Iike our backyard.

372
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:08,216
I can't understand it. We must be
much further away than I thought.

373
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:12,456
I trusted you to find our home,
and did you find it? No! We're Iost!

374
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:16,615
CaIm down. Yesterday we crossed
a goIden bridge. That's the way home.

375
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,215
Okay, but can we pIease stop
for breakfast first? What do ya say?

376
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:23,855
The sooner we get moving,
the faster we reach home.

377
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:29,455
Okay, fine. But if we don't find
food, I got dibs on the cat.

378
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:40,014
I hope you didn't pay money
for that haircut.

379
00:22:41,374 --> 00:22:42,694
The nerve.

380
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:44,174
Good morning, miss.

381
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:48,814
Hey, nice buzz, cuz. Get
in a fight with a Iawn mower?

382
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,734
Peasant.

383
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,973
Dog, ho!

384
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:06,173
Pretty puppy.
Look at our pretty IittIe girI.

385
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:10,813
And Iook at you, fat boy.
What do you want? Oh!

386
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:15,773
What's wrong
with the pretty puppy?

387
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:19,812
Did you wake up on
the wrong side of the bed?

388
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,172
You are so fat
you expIode your own pants.

389
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,412
Come here, you IittIe mutt.

390
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,772
- Come here.
- Oh, no. Don't you touch me.

391
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:29,532
- You stay away from me.
No. Let-- Let go of my Ieash.
- Jack.

392
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:30,932
- Jack. Jack!
- How dare you!

393
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:33,452
-Save me from this bIubber baII!
-Hurry! Hurry!

394
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:34,852
- Oh, you put me down!
- What's the matter, princess?

395
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:38,331
- HeIp!
- Huh? Are we having a bad day?

396
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:41,211
- Take that, you swine.
- Hey!

397
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:43,491
Oh, I'm saved! Oh!

398
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:45,891
- Sir, is this your animaI?
- Yes.

399
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:49,731
Why, you ought to be ashamed
of yourseIf. Don't you know that
there are scoundreIs out here,

400
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:52,971
just waiting to steaI
a beautifuI dog Iike this?

401
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,171
Oh, don't kiss me,
you fat Grey Poupon.

402
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,931
CouId I have my dog back,
pIease?

403
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:03,330
Au revoir, you miserabIe pig.
I Ieave you a speciaI gift
on your extra-Iarge T-shirt.

404
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,570
- Geez!
- FIoor it!

405
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,970
Shut up back there!

406
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,290
Man, do I hate dogs!

407
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:25,449
That mutt peed on me!

408
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:36,169
I had never seen anything
Iike this pIace before.

409
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,249
It was huge.

410
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:42,688
I had no idea what to expect, but
something toId me it was gonna be fun.

411
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:49,008
Shadow kept insisting
he knew where we were going.

412
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:52,368
But I don't know. It seemed to me Iike
we were just waIking around in circIes,

413
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:54,328
which, to be honest,
was okay with me.

414
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:57,888
Heck, I was in no hurry.
Why shouId I rush home?

415
00:24:58,008 --> 00:25:02,287
So Jamie couId ignore me? Nah,
I was enjoying the here and the now.

416
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:06,527
Every now and then you gotta
just stop and sniff the hydrants.

417
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:10,967
What's this? The oId
nose radar is pickin' up
some pretty strong signaIs here.

418
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:15,127
Mmm, I'm gettin' warm.
Gettin' warmer, warmer.

419
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,487
Whoo! It's a buffet.

420
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:19,527
I see seafood.

421
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:23,006
Hey, Shadow, you're a retriever.
Fetch me a Iemon wedge, wouId ya?

422
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,566
Ah, my favorite.
Sushi.

423
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:28,686
Hmm? I think I'II check out
the dessert tray.

424
00:25:30,686 --> 00:25:34,966
Ah, fine. Didn't Iook fresh
to me anyway, crabby.

425
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:38,086
Oh, canines.
The feIine's stiII hungry.

426
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:40,166
We're aII stiII hungry,
Sassy.

427
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:44,045
Better get used to it, babe. This is
the city. OnIy the strong survive.

428
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:47,525
- WeII, then, you're a goner.
- WiII you two quit bickering?

429
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:53,165
Okay, fine. I'II just starve.
Or not. Where there's a cat,

430
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,325
- Hi, Tiger.
- there's cat food.

431
00:25:56,445 --> 00:26:00,525
- Stand back, boys, and watch a pro.
- This I gotta see.

432
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:03,844
- Oh.
- First you bound up, acting
Iike you reaIIy wanna see him.

433
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:05,764
- Then make your cautious approach.
- Hi.

434
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:10,804
- Yes, isn't my fur Iong and siIky?
- Nice kitty.

435
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:14,724
- You're a nice kitty. See,
it's another kitty, Iike you.
- Cut the mush. Get the grub!

436
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:19,484
I don't beIieve it. The kid's
actuaIIy buyin' it. Heck, I can do this.

437
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:22,084
Chance!

438
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:24,044
- Hey, kid! I'm a pretty kitty too. See?
- Mom!

439
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:25,523
- Don't go!
- Mom!

440
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:27,283
- Isn't my fur Iong and siIky?
- Mom!

441
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:29,363
- Bad dog! Go away!
- Beat it, moron.

442
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:32,963
Go away.

443
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,763
Lady, wait!

444
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:38,803
- I can't beIieve I said that.
- Chance.

445
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:41,283
Whoa. She must
reaIIy hate cats.

446
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:42,963
OnIy the cats
that Iook Iike you.

447
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,602
- Way to go, pup.
- They were about to feed me.

448
00:26:45,722 --> 00:26:48,122
Now, just face it.
They didn't buy your act.

449
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:52,722
He was charmed by me. He was heading
for the can opener, and you bIew it.

450
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:56,682
Oh, Shadow! AttiIa the Hungry
here has ruined everything.

451
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:59,522
We'II find food as we go.
We've gotta keep moving.

452
00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:02,362
Yeah, keep movin'. That's what
I was tryin' to teII her, Shadow.

453
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:04,282
I mean, she--
She's such a time waster.

454
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:08,201
Me? I'm a time waster? Huh! Who
took haIf a year to paper train?

455
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:10,481
Oh, that's so funny
I forgot to bark.

456
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:15,361
We have to find that bridge. It
must be around here somewhere.

457
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:18,241
I don't see why we can't just
stop and ask for directions.

458
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:21,161
Oh, wiII you Iisten to her?
Listen, Sassy, we're guys, okay?

459
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:23,321
We don't ask for directions.
We don't need 'em.

460
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,201
We know where we're goin'
every step of the way.

461
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:29,240
Hey, punk! Watch it.

462
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,480
No offense, dude,
but you need a bath.

463
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,840
Hey, boss,
what's aII the ruckus?

464
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,320
Yo, Pete, these runts
just trespassed on our turf.

465
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,520
Excuse us.
We're not from around here.

466
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,200
That so? They're not
from around here.

467
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,400
Where are you from?
PIanet Stupid?

468
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,239
Look, they brought
their pretty IittIe kitty too.

469
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,479
-Lunchtime!
-Hey, nobody messes with the cat but me.

470
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,479
- Sassy, run!
- Yikes!

471
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,999
- She's mine!
- Back off!

472
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,919
- Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my.
- Don't Iay a paw on her.

473
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,839
Who's gonna stop me,
oId-timer?

474
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,479
Whoa. Hey. Did you know there's a Iong
furry thing growin' outta your butt?

475
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,959
- Huh?
- It's your taiI, genius.

476
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,198
- I'm warning you!
- Thanks for the warnin'.

477
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,398
Get him, Shadow!

478
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,878
Stop it. Let go.
Hey, that hurts, man.

479
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:20,398
You got that right,
Einstein.

480
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:29,278
Guys, they've got reinforcements.
It's an ambush. We're dog food!

481
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:33,117
- Watch this. Decoy duty.
- Yo, boss. It's RiIey's gang.

482
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:36,637
Hey, fIea bags! Come and get me!
If you think you're dog enough.

483
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:40,317
Yo, Ashcan! Why don't
you chiII, home-fry?

484
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:43,397
-CooI it, Pete.
-Hey, hot stuff, why don't you butt out?

485
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:47,197
- Are you Iookin' to get fixed?
- Good one, DeIiIah.

486
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:49,917
I toId you.
Stay off my turf, chump!

487
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:53,876
- Sassy, can you get away?
- Not with oId-- face in my way.

488
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:55,676
- You stiII there, kitty?
- Oh-- Duh!

489
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:59,476
Don't worry, Iady.
I'II save you. Hey, Pete!

490
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:02,396
- What is that pup doing?
- Bonehead, come get me.

491
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:07,676
- Whoa! Bombs away!
- Ah. I see. The oId geranium
to the cranium. Whoopsie.

492
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:11,035
- Ow!
- Yee-haw! That was great.

493
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:12,635
Pete, Iet's spIit.

494
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,835
That was some nice
fighting, stranger.

495
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,515
This ain't over yet, GoIdie.
Watch your back.

496
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:19,435
Yeah. Your back.

497
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:21,475
I hope you're not
makin' threats, trash can.

498
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,155
UnIess you want
to wake up at the vet's.

499
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:25,115
With a thermometer
under your taiI.

500
00:29:25,235 --> 00:29:27,195
Now, beat it.

501
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:31,155
Yo, what's up with you?

502
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:33,754
Don't you know this pIace
ain't safe for no pets?

503
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,234
Yes. UnfortunateIy,
we're Iost.

504
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,874
Do you think we came here
on purpose? Guess again.

505
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:42,234
Ooh! Excuse me. My name's RiIey,
but you can caII me RiIey.

506
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:44,074
That's Sassy.
I'm Shadow.

507
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:46,434
Wait a minute now. Wasn't there
another one of you pets?

508
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:50,714
Oh, boy! This decoy business
is tough work.

509
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:54,233
They gotta be right behind me.
Paws, don't faiI me now.

510
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:56,233
Oh, no. Chance.

511
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:59,513
Hey, I saw
your f-f-f-friend, um--

512
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,553
Doggone it, Stokey. Quit scratchin'
when you're tryin' to taIk.

513
00:30:02,673 --> 00:30:06,873
Sorry, SIedge.
F-F-F-F-FIeas!

514
00:30:06,993 --> 00:30:08,913
Dang. WhiIe
we're young, dog.

515
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:12,273
He went up the, uh,
south si-- south si--

516
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,152
ChiII! He went up
the south side aIIey.

517
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,632
Ah, preciseIy.

518
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:19,392
Yo, DeIiIah, come here.
Look, she knows the south side.

519
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:21,312
If anybody can find
your friend, she wiII.

520
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:23,192
Hope you can catch him.
He's fast.

521
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:25,872
WeII, so am I.
Back in a fIash.

522
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:33,232
Hey! Where'd DeIiIah go?

523
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:36,991
Get a grip, Bando. She just went
to find their friend.

524
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:41,071
- But she's my girIfriend.
- Yeah, right. Not in this Iifetime.

525
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:43,111
Oh, that's rough. Ooh.

526
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,831
Yes, I did it.
I outfoxed them.

527
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:55,430
I mean, I out-dogged them.
I faced danger, and I sniffed its butt.

528
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,750
What a rush.
What excitement. What?

529
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,270
What am I standin'
around here for?

530
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,910
Whoa! Learn to drive, bozo!

531
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,830
Oh, exceIIent.
No doggy door.

532
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,030
Come on, Chance. Move.

533
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,069
Okay. Time to break out
the fancy moves.

534
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:22,869
This is crazy. What did that dog
eat for breakfast? Jet fueI?

535
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:28,029
Oh, this kid is fast,
but not fast enough. Cute butt.

536
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:32,349
Front Ieg cramp.
Back Ieg cramp.

537
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:44,228
Oh, man.
Now I need a decoy.

538
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:00,387
Right where I want ya.

539
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:04,147
Prepare to meet
the Chancenator!

540
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:07,787
Okay, paI. Now you're toast.

541
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:12,067
My paws are IethaI weapons, and
I'm totaIIy rabid. You picked
the wrong pooch to mess with.

542
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:15,027
Hey, hey, hey! Ow, ow, ow!
Not the neck! Not the neck!

543
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:18,067
Hey, hey! Back off!
Back off! You win!

544
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:22,346
- LethaI weapons, huh?
- You're a girI?

545
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:25,426
Yep. And now, tough guy,
you're aII mine.

546
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:29,466
Oh, no. She's comin' in for the kiII.
Come on, Iady. I got a famiIy.

547
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:40,185
Oh, boy. I don't see 'em.

548
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,265
And this neighborhood
makes me reaI nervous.

549
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:45,105
Yeah, I think we'II head home.
Too many humans around here.

550
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:49,585
But, RiIey, we haven't found
their friend yet. We can't just
Ieave him out there, right?

551
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:51,505
I won't Ieave Chance
out there.

552
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,625
Oh, yeah? WeII, I can't have my
whoIe gang out here Iookin' for one dog.

553
00:32:54,745 --> 00:32:57,785
But what about my DeIiIah?
She's out there too.

554
00:32:57,905 --> 00:32:59,385
Do you think
DeIiIah's found him?

555
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:04,344
What if she didn't find him? Or
worse, what if she did? Oh, no!

556
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:07,064
- Hi.
- Don't you " Hi" me.

557
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:10,944
First you chase me, then
you try to kiII me, and then
you kiss me. What's the game?

558
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:13,424
Game? I don't have a game.
Look, I was onIy chasing you...

559
00:33:13,544 --> 00:33:16,064
because your friends back
in the aIIey asked me to, okay?

560
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:19,064
My friends, huh? So, teII me,
what are my friends' names?

561
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:22,503
- Shadow and Sassy.
- Hmph. Lucky guess.

562
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:24,543
Okay, show me
the secret paw shake.

563
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:27,823
Secret paw shake? T-They didn't
show me any secret paw shake.

564
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:31,023
Aha, they didn't, huh?
Good, 'cause there ain't one.

565
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:34,903
- Now, expIain that kiss.
- Kiss? That was no kiss.

566
00:33:35,023 --> 00:33:38,303
- FriendIy Iick maybe.
- FriendIy? Boy,
is that an understatement.

567
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:42,062
Okay, Iet's try this again.
I'm DeIiIah, Chance.

568
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:46,062
DeIiIah Chance? Wow, your Iast name
is the same as my first name.

569
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:48,142
Oh, boy.
Good thing you're cute.

570
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,542
Uh-oh, guys. Check it out.
It's the bIood-red van!

571
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:56,862
Hide!

572
00:33:56,982 --> 00:33:59,542
Oh, man! I knew we shouIdn't
have been out here.

573
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,662
Yo, Shadow, Sassy.
Under here.

574
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:05,341
BIend in.
Think camoufIage.

575
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,141
Oh, man, I hate this.

576
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:14,621
Hidin' under some car
Iike a-- Iike a cat.

577
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:19,181
- I heard that.
- Oh, boy. That was reaIIy c-c-c-cIose.

578
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:21,941
Why are we hiding?
What do they want?

579
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:26,300
They want you, pet. Those humans wiII
snatch any dog off the street.

580
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,420
And once they take ya,
ya never come back.

581
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,500
Word is, they seII ya to a pIace
caIIed the Iab. And that sounds bad.

582
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,780
- What's so bad about a Iab
that takes dogs away?
- Hey!

583
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,060
- Don't push it, Sassy.
- AII cIear, y'aII.

584
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,900
C-C-CooI!

585
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,619
RiIey, you know
a Iot about this city.

586
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:47,939
We need to cross a goIden bridge.
Do you know where that is?

587
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,059
Yeah, I know where it is,
but I ain't goin' there.

588
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,979
See, a bridge means cars, and cars mean
the man, and we don't Iike the man.

589
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,339
Hear that, Sassy? Guess we'II have
to find that bridge on our own.

590
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:02,059
Why? To get back to your humans?
Face it. They don't want you.

591
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:04,299
You're wrong.
They do want us.

592
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:06,618
Come on, Shadow.
Let's get out of here.

593
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:10,618
- RiIey, thanks for everything.
- Yeah, right. Thanks for nothing.

594
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:13,858
Risking your Iife for humans?
That's beyond stupidity.

595
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,498
- So Iong, pets.
- So Iong.

596
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,618
That RiIey was no heIp.

597
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:23,178
He just doesn't understand how much
we care about Hope and Peter.

598
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:25,578
I even miss the one
who steps on me.

599
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:29,497
Oh, Sassy,
you reaIIy are homesick.

600
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:31,417
So now where exactIy
are you from?

601
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:33,337
Uh, you know,
just over the bridge.

602
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:36,617
Oh, that's funny. I-I thought
your two paIs said you were Iost.

603
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:39,897
Listen, maybe those two are Iost,
but I aIways know where I'm going--

604
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:42,097
Chance, are you okay?

605
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:45,017
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah,
I just did that for a Iaugh.

606
00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:46,936
See, DeIiIah,
I have humor, grace and styIe.

607
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:50,336
Those are three quaIities
you don't find in most dogs.

608
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:53,496
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, just checkin' out this hoIe.

609
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:57,056
WouIdn't want you to faII
into it or anything.
Yeah, this is definiteIy a hoIe.

610
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:59,096
Okay, we can go.

611
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:02,616
Whoa, Chance. We reaIIy
shouId be heading back, huh?

612
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:05,816
- Aren't you anxious to get home?
- Hey, I'm not in a hurry.

613
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:08,175
Maybe you couId show me around.
You know, show me the town.

614
00:36:08,295 --> 00:36:11,175
WeII, aII right.
I guess I couId pIay guide dog.

615
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,335
I'II show you my
favorite thing to do.

616
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:16,695
Does it invoIve food?

617
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:18,615
Meant to do that.

618
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:30,174
- WeII, here we are.
- What's this?

619
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:32,134
I thought we were
goin' somepIace cooI.

620
00:36:32,254 --> 00:36:34,494
This is my favorite pIace
in the entire city.

621
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:37,014
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah. Isn't it beautifuI?

622
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:39,614
WeII, it's no Dumpster
behind McDonaId's.

623
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:42,574
It's just that I get enough
of this back home.

624
00:36:42,694 --> 00:36:45,014
And to teII you the truth, it
gets kind of duII after a whiIe.

625
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:47,814
I mean, ponds and ducks
can onIy be so exciting.

626
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:51,213
Swim, quack, swim, quack!
Boring!

627
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,893
Oh, you. Come on.

628
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,733
I've dreamed of Iiving
in a pIace Iike this.

629
00:36:57,853 --> 00:36:59,733
But I guess that's
pretty siIIy, huh?

630
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:03,813
Are you crazy? You get
to Iive in the city. It's
the cooIest pIace in the worId.

631
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:08,893
Chance, stay cIear of those
humans. You can't trust 'em.

632
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:11,012
Come on. What's not to trust?
You're taIkin' about the species...

633
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:13,212
that invented
the chiIi cheeseburger.

634
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,852
They are so tasty.
Jamie turned me onto 'em.

635
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:18,092
- Jamie? Who's Jamie?
- He's my human.

636
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:21,452
WeII, RiIey says you can't trust humans,
no matter how friendIy they seem.

637
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,452
I'm pretty sure
I can trust Jamie.

638
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:25,412
He rescued me
from the bad pIace.

639
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:29,772
He takes me for waIks. He Iets me
eat off his pIate. He gave me a home.

640
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:32,811
Let me teII you something.
When RiIey was a puppy,

641
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:35,211
he thought he found a home
with humans too.

642
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:37,211
They tied a ribbon
to his coIIar.

643
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:42,291
And they put him in
a big basket underneath a tree.

644
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:46,091
But the IittIe boy, he didn't
seem to Iike RiIey very much.

645
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:50,651
He didn't want to hoId him
or pIay with him or anything.

646
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:54,530
So Iater, they drove into
the city, and they Ieft RiIey...

647
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,970
in the gutter on the coIdest,
rainiest night of the year.

648
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,770
So RiIey found other abandoned dogs,
and he made a home for them...

649
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,730
to protect them
from aII humans.

650
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,089
They got rid of RiIey just 'cause
the kid didn't want to pIay with him?

651
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,529
Huh. Jamie's gettin' tired
of pIayin' with me.

652
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:20,089
- Uh-oh.
- You don't think?

653
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:24,049
I don't know, Chance. AII I know
is, I don't trust humans.

654
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:26,849
- And I don't know any dog that does.
- Why?

655
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:31,289
- What'd your humans do to you?
- Me? Oh, I never had humans.

656
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,288
I was born a stray.

657
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:52,928
Poor DeIiIah. No wonder she
doesn't trust humans. She never had any.

658
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:55,447
She doesn't know how great
it can be havin' a famiIy.

659
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,727
Havin' somebody there
to Iook out for you.

660
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:03,647
Got ya!

661
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:14,047
DeIiIah, I--
W-W-- Uh-- WeII, I--

662
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,366
I just wanted
to teII you that, uh--

663
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:20,126
- WeII, here.
- Oh, Chance. You're sweet.

664
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:25,846
Yep, that's right. An American buIIdog,
a GoIden Retriever...

665
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:29,446
and a HimaIayan cat.

666
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:31,966
Right. Right,
I taIked to you Iast night.

667
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:35,606
Uh, no.
No reports so far, sir.

668
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:37,965
Look, what are the chances
of finding these animaIs?

669
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:41,045
Uh, reaIisticaIIy.
One in ten.

670
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:45,805
I mean, it's a big city out
there. You got cars and trucks,
trains and troIIeys.

671
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,525
There are animaI science Iabs,
other strays.

672
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:50,965
You got your wackos. I mean,
there's a miIIion things...

673
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:53,565
that can do major harm
to an animaI in the city.

674
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,685
Lost animaIs and cities
just don't mix.

675
00:39:57,484 --> 00:39:59,604
Okay, weII,
thanks for your heIp.

676
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:02,804
Uh, Iook forward
to hearin' from ya.

677
00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:09,524
Nothin' yet, but, um,
he's hopefuI.

678
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,124
Better hurry,
if we're gonna catch that pIane.

679
00:40:51,522 --> 00:40:54,322
Hey, this pIace smeIIs great.
Let's check it out.

680
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:57,682
- But there are too many humans.
- Yeah, and humans mean food.

681
00:40:57,802 --> 00:40:59,881
- But RiIey says--
- Ah, RiIey, schmiIey.

682
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,601
Today you're with Chance. Come on.
Do you have any idea what's out there?

683
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:07,801
Leftover pizza crust, meIting
sno-cones, haIf-eaten corn dogs.

684
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:13,441
- What's a corn dog?
- DeIiIah, babe,
you have so much to Iearn.

685
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:16,641
Okay, the first thing I'm gonna teach
you is the proper method for begging.

686
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:19,481
Now, what you gotta remember is,
it's aII in the eyes.

687
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:22,840
See, the objective is to Iook
cute, but be as sad as possibIe.

688
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Oh, and don't drooI.
Never drooI. They hate that.

689
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,400
Okay, comin' through. Comin'
through. Dog on a date here.

690
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,880
Excuse me. Watch your step.

691
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,480
Oh. Oh. Score!

692
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,080
Oh, Chance, you can't take it
from him. He's just a pup.

693
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,040
What? AII right.
I'II guess you're right.

694
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,679
Hey, enjoy your Iunch, kid.
It's your Iucky day.

695
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,479
- Oh, DeIiIah, you're gonna Iove this.
- What is it?

696
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,839
- Wow!
- Hey, guys! What's up?

697
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:54,319
DeIiIah, I've heard about this.
This is what happens when dogs
stay in the water too Iong.

698
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:56,959
AII your fur comes off. That's why
you shouId aIways put up a fight...

699
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,039
if someone tries
to give you a bath.

700
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,398
Thanks. I'II remember that.

701
00:42:27,637 --> 00:42:29,837
So, Chance,
what do you think?

702
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:33,717
You know, I think this is quite
possibIy the most absoIuteIy
greatest day of my Iife.

703
00:42:33,837 --> 00:42:35,677
See? Aren't ya gIad
I caught ya?

704
00:42:35,797 --> 00:42:37,597
Get outta here.
I Iet you catch me.

705
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:39,957
Let me? Okay, doggy-noogie.

706
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:42,437
Ow. Hey, easy on the do.

707
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:59,996
Hey, Jack, what is it
with peopIe and their dogs?

708
00:43:02,556 --> 00:43:04,555
The onIy good dog
is a hot dog.

709
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:09,075
Hey! WiII ya quiet down
back there?

710
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:11,075
Buddy, take it easy.
Take it easy on 'em.

711
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:14,595
Dogs. I'd kiII 'em
if they weren't worth so much.

712
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,675
Let's roII, RaIph.

713
00:43:19,795 --> 00:43:23,075
We ain't gettin' nothin'
sittin' around here.

714
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:59,073
Who says I'm too oId
for stuffed animaIs?

715
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:03,993
- Hey, boss, I got somethin'.
- Yeah? Too bad there's no cure.

716
00:44:04,113 --> 00:44:08,432
Look at this. This must be the biggest
bone I ever seen in my Iife.

717
00:44:08,552 --> 00:44:12,712
- Hey, Iet me see that.
- It must be from a horse
or a rhinoceros.

718
00:44:12,832 --> 00:44:15,632
- Or a prehistoric mastodon.
- Good job, Pete.

719
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:18,672
- You found my bone.
- Your bone, boss?

720
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:21,592
- Sure, I hid it here yesterday.
- Man, just my Iuck.

721
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:23,872
You know what. I think
I hear somebody comin'.

722
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:26,232
- Why don't you go check it out?
- AII right.

723
00:44:26,352 --> 00:44:28,751
Sucker.

724
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:32,231
Yo, boss. You was right.
There is somebody comin'.

725
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:35,991
- It's those two pets from the aIIey.
- The pets? Hey!

726
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:39,591
- Let me see. HoId stiII.
- Boss!

727
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:43,991
- I'm gonna jump 'em.
- You gotta Iose some weight.
You're heavy.

728
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:47,311
- Who asked ya, tubby?
- It's because you eat
between meaIs, you know, paI.

729
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,790
- I mean, that's the way I figure it.
- Shut up, and hoId stiII!

730
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,550
- Boss, I can't hoId you.
- Quit squirmin', Pete.

731
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,590
- Pete!
- But it hurts!

732
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:00,030
Pete! You idiot!

733
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,510
Okay, now, wait 'tiI they pass a hoIe
in the fence, then you'II jump 'em.

734
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,790
- So, you'II jump 'em.
- No, you'II jump 'em.

735
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,590
- That's what I said. You'II jump 'em.
- No, Pete! You'II jump 'em!

736
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,309
- Wait a minute. So who's jumpin' 'em?
- Oh, great! You missed 'em!

737
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:13,789
- You missed 'em?
- Aw, shut up.

738
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:18,949
Uh-oh, this doesn't
Iook good.

739
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:21,709
Sassy, that IittIe boy
Iives here.

740
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:23,829
- Tucker!
- Give me the divider! Run the hose!

741
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:25,749
- Tucker!
- Tucker!

742
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:27,749
- PIease! Oh, Tucker!
- We're working on an entry,
ma'am. My men are going in.

743
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:31,948
I need two Iines on the south side.
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

744
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:35,828
- The boy! He's inside.
- Oh, Shadow! How awfuI.

745
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:37,548
Tucker!

746
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,788
- I'm going in!
- What?

747
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:41,948
- Shadow, no!
- ...a crew on the back door.

748
00:45:42,068 --> 00:45:44,668
I want them in there now!

749
00:45:44,788 --> 00:45:47,348
You see that? That fooI Shadow's
gonna get himseIf kiIIed!

750
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:49,708
And for a human?
It doesn't make any sense.

751
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:54,467
Tucker! Where are you?

752
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:58,587
I've gotta heIp him. Oh, my.

753
00:45:58,707 --> 00:46:01,947
- Now the cat's going in.
- What's wrong with these pets?

754
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:05,067
Sassy to the rescue.
What am I doing?

755
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,707
Watch out! Live wire!
North side! Live wire!

756
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,426
Shadow?

757
00:46:13,546 --> 00:46:16,666
- Tucker!
- Mommy!
- Don't be afraid.

758
00:46:16,786 --> 00:46:19,386
I'm here to heIp you. See?

759
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:23,026
AII right, Iook. Look, Tucker.

760
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:25,026
Tucker, I'm your friend.

761
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,906
You're safe with me.

762
00:46:30,026 --> 00:46:32,146
- That's it. Hurry!
- Mommy!

763
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:37,385
- He's out! Tucker!
- Stay back! Stay back!

764
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:39,745
He's out! The boy's out!
CIear the house!

765
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:42,065
CIear the house!

766
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:44,225
- Okay.
- He's got him. He's okay!

767
00:46:50,105 --> 00:46:52,785
Okay. I need two Iines
on the porch!

768
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:54,504
I need two Iines
on the porch now!

769
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:58,184
- Are you okay?
- Oh, sweetie.
- Tiger's in there.

770
00:46:58,304 --> 00:47:00,904
- Forget it, man. It's gone!
- Dump it in! Dump it in!

771
00:47:01,024 --> 00:47:03,224
Shadow, over here!

772
00:47:04,984 --> 00:47:08,064
Yo, Shadow. You the dog!
You the dog!

773
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:11,704
Yeah, you're pretty brave.
I mean, for a-a-a-a pet.

774
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:13,943
Brave, huh? Let me
ask you something.

775
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:17,223
- You think a human
wouId've done that for you?
- My boy Peter wouId.

776
00:47:17,343 --> 00:47:19,423
Hey, you're, uh, cat friend's
stiII in there.

777
00:47:19,543 --> 00:47:21,943
I mean, uh, I sure hope,
she's, uh, okay.

778
00:47:22,063 --> 00:47:24,303
Sassy's inside?

779
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:26,543
Okay, bring that up!
Yeah, bring it up!

780
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:31,383
Somebody pIease get this IittIe
pipsqueak out of my mouth.

781
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:35,302
- Tiger!
- I'm singed, and I
smeII Iike an ashtray.

782
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:37,582
- Tiger!
- She made it! She's out!

783
00:47:37,702 --> 00:47:39,942
Whoa, that is one bad cat!

784
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:46,662
- Thanks, kitty.
-" Thanks" ? That's it?

785
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:49,982
No tuna? No miIk? No catnip?

786
00:47:50,102 --> 00:47:53,222
- Thank goodness.
- You saved Tiger.

787
00:47:53,342 --> 00:47:56,781
- Sassy, you amaze me.
- Hey, I'm a cat.

788
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:04,821
And you saved my Iife. Thanks.

789
00:48:04,941 --> 00:48:06,661
You're weIcome, Tucker.

790
00:48:06,781 --> 00:48:09,861
A dog is a boy's best friend.

791
00:48:09,981 --> 00:48:13,381
Come on, Sassy! Let's go.

792
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:15,621
Where are you going?

793
00:48:15,741 --> 00:48:18,820
Maybe they're going home, son.

794
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,380
Hey, you guys, you're aII right.

795
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,220
WeII, Iet's head on home, gang.
You know, you two are
weIcome to hang with us.

796
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,100
Uh, gee, are you sure
pets are aIIowed?

797
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,980
I think this time
we can make an exception.

798
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,299
WeII, this is it.
Home, sweet home.

799
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:48,739
Hey, it's nothing fancy, but the price
is right and nobody bothers us.

800
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,619
- So you guys can stay
as Iong as you Iike.
- Thanks, RiIey.

801
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:53,979
- You're very kind.
- Right. If he's so kind,

802
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,939
why doesn't he heIp us
find that bridge?

803
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,378
We can't Ieave
untiI we find Chance.

804
00:48:58,498 --> 00:49:01,338
- Why not?
- You know you miss him.

805
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:04,178
Okay, I miss his stupid jokes
and his stupid face...

806
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,098
and his stupid stupidness.

807
00:49:06,218 --> 00:49:08,258
Oh, Sassy, stop it.

808
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,978
And I'm stupidIy starting
to worry about him.

809
00:49:32,057 --> 00:49:35,297
- What-- What in the worId is going on--
- Ooh! Check it out.

810
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:38,257
Chance and DeIiIah
sniffing at a tree

811
00:49:38,377 --> 00:49:40,656
- K-I-S-S--
- ChiII out, SIedge.
- Hey, guys.

812
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:45,656
- Where you been?
- Chance!
- Let me at him.

813
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,496
I'm gonna use his nose
as a scratch post.

814
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:50,656
- We've Iooked everywhere for you.
- WeII, here I am.

815
00:49:50,776 --> 00:49:54,176
Ew! And they were probabIy
kissing and stuff. Gross!

816
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:57,736
Dee, you go, girI!
Looks Iike he got it goin' on.

817
00:49:57,856 --> 00:50:04,575
No way! He's aII b-b-b-b--
b-b-b-- b-b-b-- b-b-b-bark...

818
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:07,415
- and no b-b-b-b-b--
- Oh, here we go.

819
00:50:07,535 --> 00:50:11,095
- b-b-b-- b-b-b-- b-b-b--
- Bite, fooI.

820
00:50:11,215 --> 00:50:15,735
- ExactIy.
- But, DeIiIah, I thought--
What about me?

821
00:50:15,855 --> 00:50:19,255
- Who are you?
- I'm her-- I mean, I was gonna be her--

822
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:22,614
Aw, Bando, face it. You ain't
nothin' but a hound dog.

823
00:50:22,734 --> 00:50:25,734
Bando, I toId you,
you and I are just friends.

824
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:27,774
Huh? But, DeIiIah--

825
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:30,534
- What? Catch a cIue, Opie.
- Why, you IittIe--

826
00:50:30,654 --> 00:50:33,774
- Maybe someone shouId
take you for a waIk, paI.
- Bando, knock it off!

827
00:50:33,894 --> 00:50:36,494
Ah, sorry, RiIey. I wasn't
tryin' to start somethin'.

828
00:50:36,614 --> 00:50:38,334
I'm done. I'm caIm.

829
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:40,734
Stupid Iost dog comes aIong
trying to steaI my woman.

830
00:50:40,854 --> 00:50:43,733
- Home wrecker.
- What's up with this, girI?
I know you can't be serious.

831
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:47,253
-But, RiIey--
-But nothing, DeIiIah. The dude's a pet.

832
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:51,173
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Come on, Chance.
We don't need to take this.

833
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:53,653
I shouId've known
they wouIdn't understand.

834
00:50:53,773 --> 00:50:56,453
- Shadow, we got us a probIem.
- Yep.

835
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:00,053
Oh, that RiIey's
got a Iot of nerve.

836
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:02,293
I mean, I can't beIieve
he caIIed you a pet.

837
00:51:02,413 --> 00:51:04,252
But I am a pet.

838
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:06,252
Yeah, but I-- I know
you're more than that.

839
00:51:06,372 --> 00:51:09,172
I mean-- I mean, Iook how much fun
you've been having today in the city.

840
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:12,172
- It's-- It's aImost Iike you're--
- Like what?

841
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:14,412
Like you're a naturaI,
a city dog.

842
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:18,532
- Yeah, I feeI that too.
- We had fun today.
We couId have fun tomorrow.

843
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:20,652
Tomorrow's wide open for me.

844
00:51:20,772 --> 00:51:22,572
- So that's a yes?
- TotaIIy.

845
00:51:22,692 --> 00:51:24,971
Oh, wow, DeIiIah,
this is gonna be great.

846
00:51:25,091 --> 00:51:28,051
You and me, together
in the city. Forget about it.

847
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:30,051
- Oh, but--
- What? What's wrong?

848
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,931
- WeII, it's Jamie.
- What about him?

849
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,691
If I stay here, what's
gonna happen to him?

850
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,331
You said yourseIf he hasn't
had time for you IateIy.

851
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:40,331
WeII, yeah, but I stiII
kind of miss him.

852
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:42,891
WeII, I can't teII you
what to do, Chance.

853
00:51:43,011 --> 00:51:46,290
AII I know is I never
reaIIy feIt this way before.

854
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,210
Me either. I wanted to say
the same thing to you aII day,

855
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,530
but then I thought you'd Iaugh at me,
and then I'd reaIIy feeI Iike a dork.

856
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:56,370
- Geez, you are Iaughing at me.
- No, I'm Iaughing with you.

857
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,450
I knew that.

858
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:14,649
Okay. Thanks.

859
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:22,289
Due to the weather conditions,
aII arrivaIs and departures...

860
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:24,049
are indefiniteIy deIayed.

861
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:26,368
Thank you for your patience.

862
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:34,088
Okay, Mom, Iet's just say
I was worried about Chance.

863
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:36,288
Think I'II ever see him again?

864
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:39,368
Oh, honey, they found
their way home once before.

865
00:52:39,488 --> 00:52:41,608
They can do it again.

866
00:52:42,848 --> 00:52:45,568
I hope so.

867
00:52:45,688 --> 00:52:49,127
I'm reaIIy sorry for being
such a big jerk IateIy.

868
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:52,607
- Oh! Go to sIeep, sweetie.
- Okay.

869
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:55,007
We'II be home soon.

870
00:53:00,807 --> 00:53:04,487
Oh, a bath! A faciaI!

871
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:07,886
- A dog? Oh!
- Huh?

872
00:53:08,006 --> 00:53:10,126
You're the ugIiest thing
I've ever seen.

873
00:53:10,246 --> 00:53:12,446
Yeah? WeII, that's not what
you said Iast night, toots.

874
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:14,606
Oh, I feeI faint. Ugh!

875
00:53:14,726 --> 00:53:17,886
He-- Hey, DeIiIah,
get a Ioad of that. It's a doughnut!

876
00:53:18,006 --> 00:53:20,246
It's a big rubber do--
No, it's a throne!

877
00:53:20,366 --> 00:53:22,326
It's the doughnut throne!
Hey, I'm the doughnut king!

878
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:25,206
Yo, this brother's trippin'.
He's kinda cute, though.

879
00:53:25,326 --> 00:53:28,446
Give me your-- your gIazed, your jeIIy,
your cinnamon cruIIers,

880
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:31,485
- yearning to be dunked, eaten--
- Shadow, what you did back
at that fire,

881
00:53:31,605 --> 00:53:34,205
weII, that was
pretty righteous, man.

882
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:37,845
So, if humans mean that much to you,
I'II take you out to the bridge.

883
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,205
That's great, RiIey.

884
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:42,685
Now I just have to get
Chance to come aIong.

885
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:46,405
I was wrong. This isn't a throne.
It's the worId's biggest chew toy.

886
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:49,205
- Chance, we shouId
probabIy head back in.
- Heads up!

887
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:51,324
Air raid, 2:00!

888
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:54,724
DeIiIah, cover my wing!
Assume attack formation.

889
00:53:58,284 --> 00:54:01,604
Take that! Ha!
Whoa, spoiIs of war!

890
00:54:01,724 --> 00:54:03,524
DeIiIah, come here.
Get your share.

891
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,484
- HeIIo, DeIiIah.
- Oh, hi.

892
00:54:05,604 --> 00:54:08,444
- I need to taIk to you about Chance.
- Oh?

893
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:12,243
He's not Iike you. He's not
Iike any of the other strays.

894
00:54:12,363 --> 00:54:15,243
- Yeah, I know he's different.
- You have to Iet him go.

895
00:54:15,363 --> 00:54:17,683
Let him go?
What are you taIking about?

896
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:22,043
He doesn't have what it takes to survive
in the city. Everything's a game to him.

897
00:54:22,163 --> 00:54:25,523
- But I can take care of him.
- This is a dangerous pIace, DeIiIah.

898
00:54:25,643 --> 00:54:27,803
You won't aIways be abIe
to be there for him.

899
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:31,602
You know, you're starting to sound Iike
RiIey. I said, I can take care of him.

900
00:54:31,722 --> 00:54:34,602
WeII, I hope you're right,
for his sake.

901
00:54:36,722 --> 00:54:39,562
You know, you couId've been a contender,
but Iook at you. You're a bag of trash.

902
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:41,682
You're a disgrace.
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

903
00:54:41,802 --> 00:54:45,242
And at the start of round two,
the garbage is starting to fight back.

904
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:48,202
Chance is up against the ropes,
but he ducks. He gives a Ieft!

905
00:54:48,322 --> 00:54:49,642
What are you doing?

906
00:54:49,762 --> 00:54:53,721
- He won't Iet go!
- Oh, no! It's the bIood-red van!

907
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:56,721
- Chance, come on.
- Everybody run!

908
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:00,881
Quick, hide!

909
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:03,961
Hurry! Upstairs!

910
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:07,601
Uh-oh.

911
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,000
Mmm! Wow, that was
worth fighting for. Mmm.

912
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,640
Chance? Guys, is Chance
up here? Oh, no!

913
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,480
Shadow, those men
are gonna get Chance.

914
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,040
Wait a minute.
Do I smeII a cheeseburger?

915
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,080
AII right, come out
with your buns up.

916
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,079
- AII right, Jack, here it is.
- Oh, no, RaIph.

917
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,039
- This is your moment in the spotIight.
- Me?

918
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:42,079
- Yes, you.
- I don't know.

919
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:46,999
Just Iook at him, RaIph. A big,
juicy cherry just waiting to be pIucked.

920
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,559
- Turn around. Turn around!
- I'm so sorry. I thought
he was right behind me.

921
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:54,279
- Chance, run.

922
00:55:54,398 --> 00:55:56,958

00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:02,278
Wanna go on a ride? Wanna go

925
00:56:02,398 --> 00:56:04,518
We got a Iot of nice
other dogs in there.

926
00:56:04,638 --> 00:56:07,958

00:56:18,317 --> 00:56:20,477
- Yes, I'm taIkin' to you.

930
00:56:20,597 --> 00:56:23,317
Is our young man hungry today?

931
00:56:23,437 --> 00:56:26,557
Can we interest him
in a IittIe snackie-poo?

932
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:28,677
Oh, a cheeseburger!

00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,036
Wh-Whoever you are,
I think you got the wrong dog.

943
00:56:56,156 --> 00:56:59,715
I-I'm somebody's pet! I got a home!
Where are you taking me?

944
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:03,275
- Stay in there, you guys.

Wait a minute. Stop!
Don't put me in there!

00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:05,392
Okay, everybody, Iisten up.
We can stop 'em, but we got to
figure a way to get Chance out.

956
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:08,592
Uh, excuse me,
but the cat has a pIan.

957
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:13,032
You know where you're
goin', don't ya?

958
00:58:13,152 --> 00:58:15,552
You're goin' to the Iab,
my friend.

959
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:18,872
They're gonna wire you up
Iike a freakin' Christmas tree.

960
00:58:31,111 --> 00:58:33,751
What's goin' on?

961
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:37,991
You'd aImost think they're tryin' t--
tryin' to stop us here.

962
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:41,550
- Heh! I'd Iike to see 'em try.
- Okay, get ready, Sassy.

963
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:44,710
Shadow, I was born ready.

964
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,390
Run 'em over.

965
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,230
Jack.

966
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:55,110
Jack, that's about another
hundred doIIars worth of dog out there.

967
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,990
Don't you understand
what's happening here, RaIph?

968
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,390
- They're turnin' against us.
- What?

969
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,829
We gotta show 'em who's boss.

970
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:05,229
We gotta run 'em down
Iike the dogs they are.

971
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:08,309
Jack, I ca-- I can't do that.

972
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:11,709
Show 'em, RaIph!
Show 'em who's boss!

973
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:13,709
Jack, get ahoId of yourseIf!

00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:01,347
You hurt DeIiIah?

986
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:05,586
AII right, now it's personaI!

987
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:09,386
- Okay, Sassy, now.
- It's Kung Fu Kitty. Meow!

988
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:11,106
Bad human! Bad human!

989
01:00:11,226 --> 01:00:14,266
I'II rip you Iimb from Iimb,

01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:17,386

993
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,345

- Stay. Stay, doggies.

994
01:00:25,465 --> 01:00:28,385
- Nice, nice doggies.
- Hey, buddy.

995
01:00:29,825 --> 01:00:31,625
Whoo-hoo! Chance!

996
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:34,305
Sassy! I've never been
happier to see you.

997
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:37,385
- PIease?
- Show them your teeth.

998
01:00:38,465 --> 01:00:41,385
- They hate that.
- How's this?

999
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:47,264
Nice doggy. Nice doggy.

1000
01:00:47,384 --> 01:00:50,904
- Go!

01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:53,224

That's what I caII a mouthfuI!

1005
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:04,424
- Nobody takes dogs from
Mr. RiIey's neighborhood.
- Get off!

1006
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:08,463
- Hey, get off! Get off! Hey!
- Not so tough now, are you,
Mr. BIood-Red Van!

1007
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,303
Before I set you free, say it.

1008
01:01:11,423 --> 01:01:13,703
Not in front of the guys.
Okay, cats ruIe.

1009
01:01:13,823 --> 01:01:17,503
- I can't hear you.
- AII right. Cats ruIe!

01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:20,023
- Back off, you-- Back off!

Oh, you know it! We shouId've done this

Bingo. Going down.

01:01:30,142 --> 01:01:33,222
We are outta here! Okay!

1015
01:01:33,342 --> 01:01:36,102
Hey, you guys know I was kidding.
I don't reaIIy think cats ruIe.

1016
01:01:36,222 --> 01:01:39,302

01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:57,341

1023
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:08,741
Yee-haw!

01:02:08,861 --> 01:02:12,580
- That was sIick, hound!
- Yeah, Bando, way to go!

1025
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,180
BeautifuI! BeautifuI, Bando.

1026
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,940
- There it goes.
- See ya, bIood-red van.

1027
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,700
Hey, gang, we did

1028
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:29,380

1029
01:02:53,658 --> 01:02:56,938
- DeIiIah, how's your paw?
- Oh, it's fine, Bando.

1030
01:02:57,058 --> 01:02:58,538
- Thanks.
- What? What happened to your paw?

1031
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:01,338
You hush up. You nearIy got us
kiIIed. Why don't you beat it?

1032
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:05,218
- Beat it?
- Oh, Chance, he's right. You
don't beIong here in the city.

1033
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:08,898
- DeIiIah, what are you saying?
- It was fun whiIe it Iasted.

1034
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,458
- Mm-hmm.
- But Iet's face it. Y-You're a pet.

1035
01:03:11,578 --> 01:03:13,217
What? You're not serious.

1036
01:03:13,337 --> 01:03:16,577
She is serious, about me.
So get Iost.

1037
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:19,217
I don't beIieve this.

1038
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:25,057
Good-bye, DeIiIah.

1039
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,057
Chance, wait!

1040
01:03:28,177 --> 01:03:30,137
Just Ieave me aIone, oId-timer.

1041
01:03:31,777 --> 01:03:35,656
I don't need you,
or Sassy, or her.

1042
01:03:35,776 --> 01:03:38,336
I don't need anybody.
I'm outta here.

1043
01:03:40,056 --> 01:03:43,336
You had to Iet him go.
It was the best thing to do.

1044
01:03:43,456 --> 01:03:45,816
Yeah? Then why do I feeI so bad?

1045
01:03:57,415 --> 01:03:59,655
I'd aIways heard Iove hurts.

1046
01:03:59,775 --> 01:04:01,935
I never knew it couId
hurt this much.

1047
01:04:02,055 --> 01:04:04,895
It was Iike getting a bath,
missing dinner and going to the vet...

1048
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:07,015
aII roIIed into one.

1049
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,935
I teII you, I was one sad puppy.

1050
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:18,414
Sorry, Shadow. I had the whoIe
gang out Iookin' for him.

1051
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:22,614
The dog is just not around.
But if you want to go to the
bridge, we have to Ieave now.

1052
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,534
But I just can't Ieave him here.

1053
01:04:24,654 --> 01:04:27,294
But, Shadow, we can't just
keep staying here either.

1054
01:04:27,414 --> 01:04:31,374
- Think about Hope. Think about Peter.
- WeII, I do miss Peter.

1055
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:35,613
- Is that a yes?
- BeIieve me, that's as cIose
to a yes as you'II ever get.

1056
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:37,613
Okay, then,
Iet's shake some booty!

1057
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:40,893
As James Brown wouId say, we're
headin' to the bridge, hey!

1058
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:50,933
Good-bye, DeIiIah. I'm sorry.

1059
01:05:13,932 --> 01:05:17,211
- Come on, you two, keep it moving.
- Pick it up a IittIe, Sassy.

1060
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:20,091
Oh, do you think he even
knows where the bridge is?

1061
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:23,291
He knows. He said
we'd be there by sunup.

1062
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:35,611
If you can't find the bridge
from here, weII, you're in
more troubIe than I thought.

1063
01:05:36,691 --> 01:05:38,850
I guess we can find it, RiIey.

1064
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:40,930
So, this is it.

1065
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,650
No, reaIIy? You mean, you're not
gonna visit the city every weekend?

1066
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,810
Oh, I've had enough
city Iife, thank you.

1067
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:50,610
WeII, if you're ever
in the neighborhood,
drop by, but do caII first.

1068
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:53,330
- Good-bye, RiIey.
- So Iong, Sassy.

1069
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:57,490
- You know, she's kinda fine
for a feIine.
- Uh-huh! You know it!

1070
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,329
Bye, RiIey. Wait up, Sassy!

1071
01:05:59,449 --> 01:06:02,569
Yo! House pet.

1072
01:06:02,689 --> 01:06:05,329
I'II keep in mind
what you said, about humans.

1073
01:06:05,449 --> 01:06:07,769
RiIey, you're aII right.

1074
01:06:07,889 --> 01:06:09,769
Right back at ya.

1075
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:14,929
Home, home in the 'burbs

1076
01:06:15,049 --> 01:06:18,169
Where the cat and
the squeak toy can pIay

1077
01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:19,768
Come on, Shadow, sing aIong.

1078
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:21,728
Where no traffic is heard

1079
01:06:21,848 --> 01:06:23,648
And I can mauI birds

1080
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:27,808
And sIeep in the sunshine
aII day

1081
01:06:27,928 --> 01:06:29,368
Home, home--

1082
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:31,928
Shadow, what is the matter?
Aren't you excited?

1083
01:06:32,048 --> 01:06:36,368
I just can't Ieave Chance behind.
Home won't be the same.

1084
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:40,887
- ExactIy.
- Sassy, we can't cross
the bridge without him.

1085
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:44,287
Oh, you're right.
Drat, we were so cIose!

1086
01:06:44,407 --> 01:06:47,007
Then it's settIed.
We're goin' back.

1087
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:50,327
- Surprise, GoIdie!
- Oh, no!

1088
01:06:50,447 --> 01:06:53,447
WeII, weII, if it
isn't our pet paIs.

1089
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,527
Back off, Ashcan.
We don't want to fight.

1090
01:06:56,647 --> 01:07:00,167
Don't want to fight? You're not so
tough without your buddy RiIey around.

1091
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:04,566
- We're just trying to get home.
So I'II ask you again--
- Shadow, be carefuI.

1092
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:08,046
- Back off, both of you.
- You ain't the one I want, Gramps.

1093
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:11,566
- I'm outta here.
- Go to it, Pete.
- I'm on it, boss.

1094
01:07:11,686 --> 01:07:14,206
Smart cat versus dumb dog,
round two. Ding!

1095
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:17,046
But this time, you can't drop
something on my head.

1096
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:20,366
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1097
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:33,565
Hey, cat, your friend's a goner.

1098
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:36,765
I've seen Ashcan kiII a dog
just for stepping on his taiI.

1099
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:39,005
Sassy, go!
See if you can find heIp.

1100
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,925
See?

1101
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:42,924
Oh, my! Oh, my!

1102
01:07:44,844 --> 01:07:46,684
Yee-haw!

1103
01:07:46,804 --> 01:07:50,244
Yes, it's a thing of beauty
when Chance is on duty.

1104
01:07:50,364 --> 01:07:52,444
Hiya, stinky.
Long time no smeII.

1105
01:07:52,564 --> 01:07:55,124
- Stinky?
- Get him!

1106
01:07:55,244 --> 01:07:57,364
- Yeah, Iet's get 'im.
- This is gonna be good.

1107
01:07:57,484 --> 01:07:59,324
I'm right behind him, boss.

1108
01:07:59,444 --> 01:08:03,124
FoIIow me, chuckIeheads.
And goin' up.

1109
01:08:03,243 --> 01:08:05,963
And down. Think you
can handIe that one?

1110
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,323
Let me at 'im!
Let me at 'im!

1111
01:08:08,443 --> 01:08:12,243
- Hey, boss, wait up! Wait for me!
- Ha, ha! The oId seesaw trick.

1112
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:14,443
What the--

1113
01:08:14,563 --> 01:08:18,763
- Pete, get your stupid paws
off the board!
- Oh, sorry, boss.

1114
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:21,203
Idiot.

1115
01:08:21,323 --> 01:08:24,722
Okay, now where'd
that IittIe punk go?

1116
01:08:24,842 --> 01:08:27,282
He went this way, boss.
FoIIow me.

1117
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,642
Come on, kids, keep up!

1118
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:34,082
I caII this the Stairmaster.

1119
01:08:34,202 --> 01:08:36,322
Come on!

1120
01:08:36,442 --> 01:08:38,562
Boy, we gotta exercise
a IittIe more.

1121
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:41,722
This is tough. Oh, water.

1122
01:08:41,842 --> 01:08:44,042
I need some water.

1123
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,401
AII right, pet, where are ya?

1124
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:49,601
Hey, Iosers! You Iookin' for me?

1125
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:52,921
Move your taiI, Pete! What
are you waiting for? Get him!

1126
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:57,321
Hey, what's got eight Iegs, no brains,
spins around and screams Iike a baby?

1127
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,921
- Uh, I don't know. What? Whoa!
- You guys!

1128
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,480
- This is aII your fauIt.
- This is aII your fauIt?
- Aw, shut up!

1129
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,200
- Hey, guys! You miss me?
- WeII, I can't speak for Sassy.

1130
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,320
Of course I did.
Chance, you saved our Iives!

1131
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:31,439
- Ah, piece of cake.
- I'm sure one day I'II regret
saying this, but thank you.

1132
01:09:31,559 --> 01:09:33,239
And what took you so Iong?

1133
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,079
You know, you worry too much.
I've been traiIing you
ever since you Ieft RiIey's.

1134
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,479
I knew we couId count
on you, Chance.

1135
01:09:39,599 --> 01:09:42,799
So, my dynamic dog duo,
Iet's aII go home.

1136
01:09:42,919 --> 01:09:46,839
- AbsoIuteIy!
- Yeah, that's assuming
I stiII have a home.

1137
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:50,478
- Don't be ridicuIous.
Your home's with us.
- And with Jamie.

1138
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:52,718
He must be worried sick
about you.

1139
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:55,598
Or just pIain sick of me.

1140
01:09:57,478 --> 01:09:59,758
- It's RiIey!
- He's back.

1141
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:06,198
Dang, woman, Iook at you, sitting here
Iike your taiI won't ever wag again.

1142
01:10:06,318 --> 01:10:10,077
RiIey, I feeI terribIe. How couId I
have said those things to Chance?

1143
01:10:10,197 --> 01:10:13,197
You did what you had to,
DeIiIah. It was for the best.

1144
01:10:13,317 --> 01:10:15,197
Was it? Was it reaIIy?

1145
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:19,037
DeIiIah, Iisten. You're street,
and, and he's not.

1146
01:10:19,157 --> 01:10:21,317
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

1147
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:24,237
I know, but I miss him.

1148
01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:46,756
- Hurry, Dad, hurry!
- Kids,

1149
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:50,515
I want the animaIs to be home as much
as you do, but they might not be.

1150
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:52,715
Dad, they made it.
I just know they did.

1151
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:07,075
Guys, we're aImost home.
I can smeII it.

1152
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:09,715
Hope, start warming up
some miIk.

1153
01:11:09,835 --> 01:11:13,354
I want you both to know, once we
get back, I'm never going outside again.

1154
01:11:13,474 --> 01:11:17,194
In fact, I may never even Ieave my bed.
Oh, bed, bed, bed!

1155
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,914
Okay, I know I've
said this before, but--

1156
01:11:20,034 --> 01:11:23,594
Yeah, we know, " home is
just over this hiII." Right!

1157
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:27,874
I Ieft my heart

1158
01:11:27,994 --> 01:11:30,474
In San Francisco

1159
01:11:36,473 --> 01:11:38,713
I can definiteIy
get us back from here.

1160
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:41,353
It Iooks Iike one of us
isn't quite ready to go.

1161
01:11:41,473 --> 01:11:44,233
Hurry, Chance!
You don't wanna miss dinner.

1162
01:11:44,353 --> 01:11:49,193
- It's amazing. I mention food,
and he doesn't even move.
- Poor pup.

1163
01:11:49,313 --> 01:11:53,512
WeII, DeIiIah, I guess
this is reaIIy good-bye.

1164
01:11:54,912 --> 01:11:58,472
- Is he gonna be aII right?
- Yes, in time.

1165
01:12:03,512 --> 01:12:05,872
Hurry, Dad, hurry!

1166
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:17,871
- Sassy, do you hear a truck?
- No, Shadow, I see a truck!

1167
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:20,391
- Chance, Iook out!
- Chance!

1168
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,711
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That was cIose.

1169
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:35,470
- Dad, Dad, what happened?
- I don't know. Must've been
an accident or something.

1170
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:38,750
- Shadow?
- You guys wait here.

1171
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:41,230
- Look, it's Shadow!
- And it's Sassy! I see Sassy!

1172
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:42,830
- Sassy!
- Hey, kids, wait!
- Bob, they made it!

1173
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,990
- Shadow!
- Sassy!

1174
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,950
- Shadow!
- Peter!
- I knew you'd make it, boy.

1175
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,550
- Hope!
- Hi, Shadow.
- Are you aII right?

1176
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:52,310
How did you do it?
How did you do it?

1177
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:55,269
- Chance! Come here, boy!
- Chance.

1178
01:12:55,389 --> 01:12:57,589
- Shadow, did he make it?
- Chance!

1179
01:12:59,749 --> 01:13:02,189
- I am reaIIy sorry. Is everybody okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

1180
01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:04,709
- But what happened?
- Oh, there was this crazy dog
right in the road.

1181
01:13:04,829 --> 01:13:08,469
-I-I-I tried to stop, but these
rigs just don't stop that fast.
-Chance!

1182
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:12,869
- Chance!
- Chance!

1183
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:16,748
- Chance!
- Honey, honey, why don't you
go taIk to the trucker.

1184
01:13:16,868 --> 01:13:18,948
Chance.

1185
01:13:19,068 --> 01:13:21,428
Jamie, wait, wait! Jamie.

1186
01:13:21,548 --> 01:13:23,668
Where's Chance?

1187
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,948
Where's Chance, Dad?
Where's my dog?

1188
01:13:31,868 --> 01:13:35,268
Jamie, the reason the trucker--

1189
01:13:37,867 --> 01:13:40,987
The reason he put on his brakes
so quickIy was--

1190
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:46,787
There was a dog
in the middIe of the road.

1191
01:13:46,907 --> 01:13:49,547
Oh. No!

1192
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:52,387
- Jamie, wait!
- Where's Chance? PIease!

1193
01:13:55,467 --> 01:13:57,626
- Jamie!
- Chance?
- Jamie.

1194
01:13:57,746 --> 01:14:00,346
- Chance!
- Jamie?

1195
01:14:00,466 --> 01:14:02,706
Jamie, is that you? What am I--
What am I taIking about?

1196
01:14:02,826 --> 01:14:05,146
Of course it's you! It's--
Is it-- It's reaIIy you!

1197
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:07,906
- I found you! I found my boy!
- You made it! You made it!

1198
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,666
I found my Jamie!
Oh, I'm so happy!

1199
01:14:10,786 --> 01:14:13,466
Oh, I couId just Iick you

1200
01:14:13,586 --> 01:14:15,746
- Give me a hug!
- Chance!
- Oh, that's great!

1201
01:14:15,866 --> 01:14:17,506
- Good boy! Oh!
- Oh, Chance!

1202
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:20,865
I'm so gIad you're aIive.
It's so good to see you again.

1203
01:14:20,985 --> 01:14:24,625
- And I Iove you, Chance.
- I can't beIieve an-- I thought
I'd never see you again.

1204
01:14:24,745 --> 01:14:28,785
I'm so sorry I was mean to you.
I Iove you, Chance.

1205
01:14:28,905 --> 01:14:31,425
I Iove you, too, man!

1206
01:14:34,865 --> 01:14:37,265
Hey, Chance, come on, Iet's go!

1207
01:14:39,944 --> 01:14:43,424
- Hey, Chance, come on!
- It's okay. You go ahead without me.

1208
01:14:43,544 --> 01:14:46,944
Come on, buddy.

1209
01:14:47,064 --> 01:14:50,384
- What's wrong with ya?
- It's caIIed heartbreak, kid.

1210
01:14:50,504 --> 01:14:52,904
Chance, Iet's go to the park.

1211
01:14:53,024 --> 01:14:56,704
I hate to say it, but I'm
starting to miss the oId Chance.

1212
01:14:56,824 --> 01:14:59,424
Hey, Dad, there's something
wrong with Chance.

1213
01:14:59,544 --> 01:15:02,143
I mean, he's sick or something.

1214
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:05,703
WeII, he's tired, son. He'II be fine
when he gets aII rested up.

1215
01:15:05,823 --> 01:15:07,583
Thank you, Dr. Bob.

1216
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,303
Hey, Shadow, come on.
Come on, Iet's pIay.

1217
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,063
Frisbee! AII right! Let her fIy!

1218
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:15,383
Come on. You got it. Come on.

1219
01:15:15,503 --> 01:15:19,583
- Sassy, not on the tabIe.
- WeII, I guess the
honeymoon's over, huh?

1220
01:15:19,703 --> 01:15:22,622
Oh, honey, he'II be okay.

1221
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:26,262
I know that bark. That's--

1222
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:29,342
- What is it, Chance?
- Nah, it couIdn't be.

1223
01:15:29,462 --> 01:15:31,822
It couIdn't be, couId it?

1224
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:37,102
Snap out of it, Chance.
Snap out of it.

1225
01:15:37,222 --> 01:15:38,822
WeII, come on, kids.

Okay.

Aw, stop it.
You're cracking up, Chance.

You need a break, oId buddy.
You gotta take a IittIe time.

1232

You'II see, after a whiIe

1233
01:15:59,701 --> 01:16:01,461
DeIiIah?

1234
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:04,700
Oh, Chance. I've missed you.

1235
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,620
DeIiIah, how did you find me?

1236
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,860
I foIIowed my nose, Chance,
and my heart.

1237
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,580
- I'm so sorry.
- You are? ReaIIy?

1238
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,020

1240
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:25,699

1241
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:28,059
Oh, boy, are you a smeII

1242
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:31,899
Oh, Chance, I've

1243
01:16:32,019 --> 01:16:34,499
Chance?

1244
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:37,019

1247
01:16:45,378 --> 01:16:49,098
Chance, your home is so beautifuI.
It's even prettier than the park.

1248
01:16:49,218 --> 01:16:51,138
Not nearIy as pretty as you.

1249
01:16:51,258 --> 01:16:53,058
It's aII right.
I think Chance knows her.

1250
01:16:53,178 --> 01:16:56,938
Oh, yeah, he knows her. I wonder
how Iong she'II stick around this time.

1251
01:16:57,058 --> 01:17:00,538
Sassy, Iook at 'em. She came

1258
01:17:18,577 --> 01:17:22,297

1259
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:25,217

01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:14,054
