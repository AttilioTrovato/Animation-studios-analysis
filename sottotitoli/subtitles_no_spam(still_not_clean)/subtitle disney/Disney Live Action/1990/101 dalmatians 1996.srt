1
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,725
We're all familiar
with the illegal poaching

2
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:30,933
of endangered
animals in the wild.

3
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:36,099
But never before has an animal in
captivity been slaughtered for its pelt.

4
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,975
Animal protection groups that
monitor the international trade

5
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,766
in game contraband
have further told us

6
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:45,516
that a white Siberian tiger is
so rare that the offer of a pelt

7
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:49,099
will surely draw the attention
of law enforcement agencies.

8
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,141
Shortly before dawn
this morning,

9
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:55,266
security staff at London Zoo
discovered the excoriated carcass

10
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:59,141
of its prized three-year-old
female Siberian tiger, Su-Ling.

11
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,725
Police sources have suggested
that the killing was contracted

12
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,474
by a private collector.

13
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,182
Oh, isn't that horrible?

14
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:07,641
Who'd do a thing like that?

15
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:10,141
...moved into the urban
zoological park.

16
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:14,641
We must ask ourselves if any
animal in the world is safe.

17
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:17,517
This is Tim Ryan
reporting from London Zoo.

18
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:58,976
What a bad day
for the animal kingdom.

19
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:02,391
Oh.

20
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:05,809
One day, very soon, Pongo,
I'm going to make a sale.

21
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:09,307
'Cause we're fast
approaching the point where

22
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,017
I'm going to have to start
eating your table scraps.

23
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,559
Oh, I was exaggerating.

24
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,558
Well, shall we?

25
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,683
It's not that bad, it's just very
important this meeting goes well.

26
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:24,933
You know how I am about meetings,
I tend to get a little...

27
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:25,975
Well, nervous.

28
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:28,516
When I get nervous,
I say things, I do things

29
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,766
I shouldn't say, I shouldn't
do and next thing we know...

30
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,726
It's freelancing. Probably.

31
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:41,099
He's got the best
instincts in the industry.

32
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,267
Since he was six, he's picked the
top-selling game every year.

33
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:02,934
Well?

34
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,558
What do you think?

35
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:10,057
Potentially good graphics,
reasonably entertaining premise,

36
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:13,099
the dog's well-conceived and
the environments are engaging.

37
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,766
But I'm not interested in a game

38
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:18,474
that has a chubby little dog
catcher as the bad guy.

39
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:20,475
Even girls won't like this game.

40
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:23,307
Sorry, mate.

41
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:24,808
Yeah, but wait, wait, wait.
Herbert, wait!

42
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:26,016
What if there were
a better villain,

43
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:28,100
you know, someone
you could really hate?

44
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:30,975
It's not hatred
that's important.

45
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:32,559
It's the desire to annihilate.

46
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,434
Top of the morning
to you, ma'am.

47
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:18,308
Morning.

48
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,307
Good morning. Miss De Vil's office.
Could you hold, please?

49
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:23,599
Yes, I'll be with you
in a moment.

50
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,850
Could you hold, please?

51
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,766
Thank you. Good morning. Miss
De Vil's office. Could you...

52
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,809
Good morning, Miss De Vil.

53
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,851
Good morning,
Miss De Vil.

54
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:36,642
Good morning, ma'am.

55
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,017
Good morning.

56
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,141
Anita, darling.

57
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,517
Oh, good morning, Cruella.

58
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:13,142
What a charming dog.

59
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,641
Thank you. Spots.

60
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:17,224
Yes, she's a Dalmatian.

61
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:18,600
- Inspiration?
- Yes.

62
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,099
Long hair or short? Short.

63
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,016
Coarse or fine? ANITA:
I'm afraid it is a little coarse.

64
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:28,391
Pity! But it was very fine
when she was a puppy.

65
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:31,183
Redemption. We need
to have a little girl talk.

66
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,392
Come to my office.

67
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:35,434
Bring the drawing.

68
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,891
Now, darling. Tell me
more about these spots.

69
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,891
I did leopard spots in the '80s.

70
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,766
Well, Dalmatian spots are a
little different, aren't they?

71
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,182
Cozy. Cuddly.

72
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:46,349
Classic. Less trashy.

73
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,017
Exactly.

74
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:50,099
Do you like spots, Frederick?

75
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,558
Oh, I don't believe so, madam.

76
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,641
I thought we liked
stripes this year.

77
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:55,058
What kind of sycophant are you?

78
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,474
Um...

79
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,142
What kind of sycophant
would you like me to be?

80
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,100
Frederick.

81
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,641
I'm beginning to see spots.

82
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:09,766
What would it cost us to start
again on next year's line?

83
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,057
Millions.
Can we afford it?

84
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,641
Well, yes...

85
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,267
Thank you, darling. Now go away.
I have to talk to Anita.

86
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,141
Alonzo.

87
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:21,600
Did you ask Anita if she'd
like something to drink?

88
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,266
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

89
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:32,225
Sit down, please.

90
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,975
How long have you been
working for me?

91
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,307
Uh, two years, last August.

92
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:43,307
And you've done wonderful
work in that time.

93
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,307
Thank you.

94
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,182
I don't see you socially, do I?

95
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:48,474
No.

96
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:52,266
And you're not very well-known,
despite your obvious talent.

97
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:54,975
Well. Notoriety doesn't
mean very much to me.

98
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,433
Your work is fresh and clean.

99
00:08:57,434 --> 00:09:01,141
Unfettered, unpretentious...
It sells.

100
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:04,516
And one of these days, my competitors
are going to suss out who you are.

101
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,808
And they are going to
try to steal you away.

102
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,808
Oh, no. If I left, it
wouldn't be for another job.

103
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,142
Oh, really?
What would it be for?

104
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:16,307
Well, I don't know, um...
If I met someone...

105
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,349
If working here didn't
fit in with our plans.

106
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,392
Marriage.

107
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,141
Perhaps.

108
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:24,683
More good women have been
lost to marriage than to war,

109
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:26,933
famine, disease and disaster.

110
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,891
You have talent, darling.

111
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,016
Don't squander it.

112
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,517
Well, I don't think that
it's something we have to worry about.

113
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:35,933
I don't have any prospects.

114
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:38,057
Thank God.

115
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:39,225
Well, I should be
getting back to work.

116
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,891
Yes. Please do.

117
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:43,017
Alonzo.

118
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,350
The drawing.

119
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,349
Take the drawing from
Anita and hand it to me!

120
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,642
Is that difficult?

121
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:05,350
Thank you. Now go stand
somewhere until I need you.

122
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:11,850
I look wonderful in spots.

123
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:15,267
However, I would like
to make one small change.

124
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:16,851
Yes.

125
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,891
We could do this in linen.

126
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:24,057
It would be stunning in fur.

127
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,725
But you'll be wearing it to the
Chesterton Trials. That's in April.

128
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,558
Uh, fur would be inappropriate.

129
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,766
But it's my only
true love, darling.

130
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:33,808
I live for fur. I worship fur.

131
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,559
After all, is there a woman in all
this wretched world who doesn't?

132
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:39,559
Give it to Anita.

133
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,267
Oh.

134
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:50,434
It is rather amusing, isn't it?

135
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,016
What is?

136
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:55,599
Well, if we make this coat,

137
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,892
it would be as if
I were wearing your dog.

138
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:04,267
Woof! Woof!

139
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:44,475
Sorry, Pongo, I didn't mean
to take so long.

140
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:48,808
If I could just sell a game,
we might be able to get a car.

141
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,100
Come on.

142
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:58,517
Pongo!

143
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,516
Pongo!

144
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,559
Whoa!

145
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:10,809
Pongo!

146
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,308
Slow down!

147
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,558
Slow down!

148
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,516
Watch it! Watch it!

149
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:23,392
Oh.

150
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:26,225
Pongo!

151
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:29,183
Hey!

152
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,559
Pongo! Pongo! Pongo!

153
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,434
Ooh!

154
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:03,559
Pongo!

155
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,434
Turn!

156
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:12,600
No! Pongo!

157
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,392
Watch it!

158
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:22,100
Stop! Stop! Oh!

159
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,434
Pongo!

160
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
Pongo!

161
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,267
I don't think
he wanted to do that.

162
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,308
Here we go, Perdy.

163
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,976
Oh, now stop it. Okay, go!

164
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,141
Go fetch it.

165
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,349
Good girl.

166
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,850
Come on. Bring it back.

167
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,141
Come here. Come here.

168
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:25,308
Yeah. Good girl.

169
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:27,558
Okay.

170
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,684
Oh. Now, come on.
Let's go again.

171
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:30,767
Pongo!

172
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:37,851
Pongo!

173
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:45,600
Go on.

174
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:05,684
Hello. Who are you?

175
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,517
Oh, I got ya!

176
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,308
Very smart. Very funny.

177
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,225
Everybody had a good laugh.

178
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:35,182
Let go of that dog!

179
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,725
Stay out of it, lady.

180
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:38,725
Stop it, or, or... I'll hit you.

181
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,683
Today is not a good day
to threaten me, ma'am.

182
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:42,391
I don't care if it's a
good day or a bad day,

183
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:43,558
I'll hit you, nonetheless.

184
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,808
Whatever. Okay, I gave you
a good, proper warning.

185
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:46,600
Look, I've had...

186
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:49,224
Oh.

187
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:51,726
Now, release my dog
or I'll hit you again.

188
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:53,600
Oh.

189
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:56,766
Your dog? Yes.

190
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:57,892
That is my dog.
Will you let her go?

191
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:01,434
Excuse me.

192
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:07,934
He's a she.

193
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,559
Mm-hmm.

194
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,559
Hello, Pongo.

195
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,267
I beg your pardon, ma'am.
I'm sorry. My mistake.

196
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:28,808
What have you got in the
purse of yours? Rocks?

197
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,100
Oh, no. Bricks.

198
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:32,641
I've been paving my garden

199
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:35,599
and every time I see a discarded
brick, I just pick it up.

200
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,642
Yeah? How many did
you find today?

201
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,307
Uh, three. Three?

202
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:40,600
Oh, well. That's what I
would have guessed. Mmm.

203
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:42,642
Why are you all wet?

204
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:45,933
I went swimming in the pond.

205
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:47,933
Oh, you shouldn't have.
The water's filthy.

206
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,599
Mm-hmm. Yes
and it tastes like fish.

207
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,141
And, um, you've lost a
shoe, did you know that?

208
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,725
Yes, I do. As a matter
of fact, I did.

209
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,766
I noticed it running
down the gravel path.

210
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,891
Oh, I'm ever so sorry. I mean...

211
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,433
You know, I thought
if you were silly enough

212
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:01,641
to go swimming in a dirty pond

213
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:04,891
you'd be silly enough not to
realize you'd lost a shoe.

214
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:07,599
Actually, I crashed
my bicycle in the pond.

215
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,766
The only part of my body that
wasn't injured was my head.

216
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:14,182
But now, thanks to you. I got the
complete set of bodily injuries.

217
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,599
Well, it was nice being
assaulted by you, Miss...

218
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,307
Oh, my name is Anita.

219
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:20,975
Anita? And yours is Roger.

220
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,766
Um, I read it on your
dog's identification tag.

221
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,641
Oh. Oh! Yes. Well...

222
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:28,142
Nice meeting you.
I hope I didn't alarm you.

223
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:30,766
Oh, no. That's fine.

224
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,600
Since we both seem to have a
certain fondness for Dalmatians.

225
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:35,809
Yes.

226
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,683
Well, they certainly have a
certain fondness for each other.

227
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:44,183
Don't they? Yeah.

228
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,850
Well, Pongo...

229
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,182
Your roving eye's gotten me in
enough trouble for one day.

230
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:59,516
Why don't you come
with me? We'll go home.

231
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:01,474
Um, are you sure
you'll be all right?

232
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:03,016
Perhaps, you should
call your doctor.

233
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:05,266
I'll be fine. Fine.
Good luck with your bricks.

234
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:08,016
If you have a concussion, you
shouldn't be left alone, you know?

235
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:10,891
Pongo, you could
have gotten me killed.

236
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,307
You know that?

237
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:15,058
You risk losing your master for
a brief frolic with a female.

238
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,517
Come on.

239
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,392
Jolly nice human,
don't you think?

240
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,641
Fools aren't born, Pongo.

241
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:33,726
Pretty girls make them
in their spare time.

242
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,684
Shall we? Come on.

243
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,433
Excuse me.

244
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:48,559
Sorry. Thank you.

245
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:15,224
You have it all wrong, Pongo. I'm simply
trying to decide on a route home.

246
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,891
I has nothing whatsoever
to do with Anita.

247
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:18,767
If that's even what her name is.

248
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,516
Perdy.

249
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,142
What is it? Oh!

250
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,308
Pongo! Pongo! Easy! Easy! Easy!

251
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,434
Oh. Ah! Perdy.

252
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,851
Stop. Okay.

253
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:47,517
Perdy, stop!

254
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:49,976
Perdy!

255
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:54,891
Look out!

256
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:55,809
Ahhh!

257
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:00,934
Oh. Ah!

258
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:07,599
Oh, I've never
been rescued before.

259
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,391
It was very exciting.

260
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,725
And you were ever so sweet
to give me a kiss.

261
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,641
That wasn't a kiss. That
was mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

262
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:15,933
Oh.

263
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,683
Besides, it didn't
work very well.

264
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,975
You're supposed to lie flat on
your back and remain still.

265
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:23,433
I couldn't really do it properly
with your arms around my neck.

266
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,975
I'm ever so sorry. No, no.
That's...

267
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,559
Quite all right.

268
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:30,558
Well, you give
a very good rescue.

269
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,892
Thank you.

270
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:36,851
Oh.

271
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:45,851
I think we have a problem.

272
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:51,141
I think
my dog is in love.

273
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:56,183
I think mine is, too.

274
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,683
Why is that a problem?

275
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,350
They are going to be
broken-hearted when you leave.

276
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,850
Oh.

277
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:07,391
Oh, I don't think I could bear to
live with a broken-hearted Dalmatian.

278
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,433
Yes, they are miserable
when they're lonely.

279
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,891
Well, we'd better
think of something.

280
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:14,017
I agree.

281
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,808
Do you want another
cup of marriage?

282
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,391
Excuse me. Tea?

283
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:20,891
Another cup of tea.
You said marriage.

284
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:22,558
Uh, marriage?

285
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,182
Yes, that's what you said. I
mean, you meant to say tea,

286
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,141
but it came out "marriage."

287
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:29,474
Oh, I'm sorry, uh...

288
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,017
Do you want another cup of...

289
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,100
Tea?

290
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,392
I do.

291
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:41,267
You... You do?

292
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:44,767
I will.

293
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:46,851
You will?

294
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:49,767
If you ask me.

295
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,726
Would you?

296
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:57,434
Yes.

297
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,142
For as much
as Roger and Anita

298
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,726
have consented together
in holy wedlock,

299
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:26,391
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

300
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:31,141
and thereto have given and pledged
their troth either to other,

301
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,851
and declared the same by giving
and receiving of a ring,

302
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,183
by joining of hands.

303
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,934
I pronounce that they be
man and wife together,

304
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:45,099
in the name of
the Father, and of the Son,

305
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,474
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

306
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:48,308
Amen.

307
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:51,142
God the Father,
God the Son,

308
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:54,224
God the Holy Ghost,

309
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:57,099
bless, preserve, and keep you.

310
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,850
The Lord mercifully
with his favor look upon you.

311
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:03,809
And so fill you with all
spiritual benediction and grace,

312
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:08,975
that ye may so
live together in this life,

313
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:12,350
that in the world to come
you may have life everlasting.

314
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,891
Amen.

315
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,142
Amen.

316
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:17,224
All right.

317
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:20,558
Now, let me tell me tell you a bit about
this bloke, Skinner, before we meet him.

318
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,057
Now, supposedly,
when he was quite young,

319
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:25,266
his dog tore open his throat

320
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,766
and ripped out his vocal chords,

321
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,599
leaving him brutally scarred
and completely mute.

322
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,057
He cannot talk at all.

323
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,933
Now, pay... Look at me.

324
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,641
Pay attention,
this is very important.

325
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,266
There are two things you
must not do to Skinner.

326
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:44,392
All right. One. Do not look at
the horrendous scar on his neck.

327
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,225
Two. Don't talk to him.

328
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:49,267
Understand? Not a word.

329
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:51,767
Right.

330
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:57,641
Oh!

331
00:24:57,642 --> 00:25:01,141
Look at the size of that scar.

332
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:03,225
No bloody wonder
you can't talk, mate.

333
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:08,308
Excuse me, just a minute,
would you?

334
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:23,851
God, bloody gruesome line
of work you're in, Skinner.

335
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:29,142
Sight of all these deceased
creatures gives me a shrinky winky.

336
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,684
Much obliged, sunshine.

337
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,684
How could she do this to me?

338
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,851
Morning, ma'am. Sit.

339
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:22,684
Tea? Er, please.

340
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,642
Er, please.

341
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:36,183
Thank you. Thank you.

342
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,225
Oh, well.
What a beautiful day, ma'am.

343
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,558
Blue skies, birds singing.

344
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,349
Laughter of school children
riding on gentle...

345
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,267
Get on with it, you imbecile!

346
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:53,558
Well, I...

347
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,017
I have here a present
from Mr. Skinner.

348
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,392
Oh.

349
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:14,559
It's magnificent.
Hello, my beauty.

350
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:16,474
Oh, God.

351
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,183
Come. Come with me.

352
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:21,391
Come with me, my darling.

353
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:22,517
Let me see you.

354
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,267
Oh.

355
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:29,809
You were a big bad boy,
weren't you, darling?

356
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:32,433
Yes, yes, yes.

357
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,767
Siberian tiger suits
madam very well indeed.

358
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,099
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

359
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
Who's the fairest of them all?

360
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,225
You are.

361
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:54,266
I remember you were always very good
at drawing when you were a little girl.

362
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,558
And now to be with you again

363
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,516
as you start a family of your
own is like a dream come true.

364
00:27:58,517 --> 00:27:59,600
Oh, Nanny.

365
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:04,891
I don't think Roger and I are quite
ready to start a family yet.

366
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,725
Oh, that's a shame.

367
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,809
Ah, well. First, the puppies.

368
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:12,183
Then, the babies.

369
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:14,475
Puppies?

370
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:26,641
If I've done
my job right, Pongo,

371
00:28:26,642 --> 00:28:29,642
when this new villain comes up, you're
gonna run from the room in a panic.

372
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:51,726
Gotcha.

373
00:28:58,434 --> 00:28:59,892
It's unmistakable, dear.

374
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:02,725
It's the look
every woman gets

375
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:04,517
when she knows she's
going to be a mother.

376
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:07,350
Notice how tranquil she is.

377
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,684
Her eyes are soft and warm.

378
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,224
Though you might not see it,

379
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:18,225
you can certainly feel
that she's smiling.

380
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,850
It's the smile we wear when we're
guarding a precious secret.

381
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:27,891
And now that she's living
for others as well as herself,

382
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,600
she's eating more.

383
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:33,224
And every now and again,

384
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:36,392
for no reason other than
she's so happy with herself,

385
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:37,726
she sighs.

386
00:29:43,225 --> 00:29:45,391
I think you're right, Nanny.

387
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:46,392
I think she does look different.

388
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,684
Oh, my goodness.

389
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
What is it, Nanny?

390
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,267
Anita, I think you're
going to have a puppy.

391
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:01,559
Uh... Oh.

392
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:18,933
Thank you so much.

393
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:20,725
A month's time
for a check-up, yes?

394
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:22,267
All right. Bye-bye.
See you again soon.

395
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,933
So?

396
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,850
Well, he said that
it's all great.

397
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:34,599
Um, baby's nice and big.

398
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,559
It's right about...
That's wonderful.

399
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:47,475
Oh, no. What?

400
00:30:58,308 --> 00:30:59,434
Cruella?

401
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:01,475
Anita, darling.

402
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:06,976
Oh, Anita.

403
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:09,851
Those dazzling dogs.

404
00:31:12,183 --> 00:31:14,182
And you must be Rufus.

405
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:16,433
Uh, no. It's Roger. And it's
a pleasure, Miss De Vil.

406
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:17,808
What's a pleasure?

407
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,683
Uh, making your acquaintance.

408
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:21,349
Such a sweet thought.

409
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,474
I wish I could reciprocate.

410
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:26,307
Tell me, darling, you
married him for his dog.

411
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:32,141
Oh, darling. I've missed you so.

412
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,182
I hate that you've taken leave.

413
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,141
Uh, but I'm still working.
You've been getting my sketches.

414
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:38,975
Well, it's not the same thing.

415
00:31:38,976 --> 00:31:40,308
I miss the interaction.

416
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,224
And what is it that you do,

417
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:50,392
that allows you to support
Anita in such splendor.

418
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,517
I design video games.

419
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:56,307
Video games? Mm-hmm.

420
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:57,641
Is he having me on?

421
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:59,266
Oh, no. He's very good at it.

422
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:01,474
And it's a growing business.

423
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:03,224
Those horrible noisy things
that children play with

424
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,850
on their television,
someone designs them?

425
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:07,642
What a senseless thing
to do with your life.

426
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,892
Oh, did Anita tell you the news?

427
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:15,684
She's going to have a baby.

428
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:19,350
Is this true?

429
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,182
Yes.

430
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:25,182
Oh, you poor thing.
I'm so sorry.

431
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:27,683
We're very
excited about it, Cruella.

432
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,559
You can't be serious. She is.

433
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:33,224
Well, what can I say?

434
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:35,391
Accidents will happen.

435
00:32:35,392 --> 00:32:36,891
We're having puppies, too. Oh.

436
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:38,558
Puppies?

437
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,307
You have been a busy boy.

438
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:46,891
Well, I must say that's somewhat
better news. I adore puppies.

439
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:49,266
I'll expect a decline
in your work product.

440
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,057
Oh, I shouldn't think so.

441
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:54,016
Be sure to let me know
when the blessed event occurs.

442
00:32:54,017 --> 00:32:56,349
Oh, well, it won't be
for another eight months.

443
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,725
The puppies, darling.

444
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:06,267
I've no use for babies.

445
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,641
Cheerio. Cheerio, darling.

446
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,726
If I'm this nervous about your puppies, what
am I gonna be like when my baby arrives?

447
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:45,642
How can you be so calm?

448
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:51,349
Nanny!

449
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:57,642
Oh, my goodness!

450
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:00,808
Gangway!

451
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,433
Is there
something I can do?

452
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,224
Maybe... Maybe I can
be of some help.

453
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,266
Right. Get out,

454
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:18,600
peek in through the window and see
if those puppies have come yet.

455
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,350
Can I borrow your umbrella?

456
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:28,225
Be careful when you open it.

457
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:32,684
They're here!
The puppies are here.

458
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,684
You're a father, Pongo!

459
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,182
Two! Two!

460
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:42,391
You're a father twice!

461
00:34:42,392 --> 00:34:47,850
- Make that three.
- Three! Three, Pongo! Three puppies!

462
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,851
- Oh, my goodness! Four!
- Four!

463
00:35:17,726 --> 00:35:19,016
Fifteen!

464
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,225
Did you hear that, boy?
Fifteen puppies!

465
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:30,684
Fourteen.

466
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:34,225
We lost one.

467
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,934
I'm sorry, Pongo, I'm so sorry.

468
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,434
I wonder.

469
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:20,684
Fifteen! We have 15 puppies!

470
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:25,392
What... Oh!

471
00:37:26,726 --> 00:37:29,516
Goodness, gracious!
It's a miracle!

472
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,766
Anita, 15! Fifteen again.

473
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,851
We must
call this one Lucky.

474
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,016
Look. Look at him!

475
00:37:42,017 --> 00:37:43,808
Aww, hmm! Oh!

476
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,850
How's Perdy? She's tired.

477
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:48,516
Oh! Bringing 15 puppies into the
world, I guess she's got the right.

478
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,725
Yeah. They're so beautiful.

479
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:54,934
You can go in now, Pongo.

480
00:37:57,684 --> 00:38:01,057
Here we are, Perdy.
Yes, it's Lucky!

481
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:02,891
Now make room,
you others.

482
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:06,224
There we are,
and well done, Perdy.

483
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:07,726
There's a good girl.

484
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,017
I'll leave you two alone.

485
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:30,726
I'm glad I'm only having the one.
Hmm.

486
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Anita?

487
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:52,349
Anita?

488
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,100
There you are. Where are the puppies?
They should've arrived by now.

489
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:00,225
How marvelous.

490
00:39:02,434 --> 00:39:04,766
How marvelous!

491
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,100
How perfect...

492
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,641
Oh. The devil take it!

493
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,142
They're mongrels!
No spots. No spots at all.

494
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:17,141
What horrible little white rats!

495
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:19,808
But their spots
don't come till later.

496
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:20,933
You're sure?

497
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,599
Yes.

498
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,433
All right. Put them in a bag.
I'll take them with me now!

499
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,683
What? They were just born.

500
00:39:28,684 --> 00:39:30,850
I can see that!

501
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,808
But, Cruella, the puppies have to be
with their mother for several weeks.

502
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,307
They're not ready to leave.

503
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:36,933
Fine, put the little brutes on reserve
for me. How much would you like?

504
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:38,183
They're not for sale.

505
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,850
Oh! You've come into
some money, have you?

506
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:45,349
Did you design some silly game that
would drive the delinquent kiddies

507
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,683
into frenzies of video delight?

508
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,141
As a matter of fact, I have...
No, no. No!

509
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:50,141
What Roger means to say
is that we're not sure

510
00:39:50,142 --> 00:39:51,558
we're going to sell the puppies.

511
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,725
Anita, don't be ridiculous.

512
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,683
You can't possible afford
to keep them.

513
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,307
I'll pay twice what
they're worth.

514
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:58,850
Come now,
I'm being more than generous.

515
00:39:58,851 --> 00:40:01,516
£500 Oh!

516
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:05,017
£7,500, fair?

517
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,599
£2 per spot!

518
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,558
Cruella, what would
you do with 15 puppies?

519
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,725
Yeah, that is irrelevant, Anita. She can't
have any because they're not for sale.

520
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:16,016
I'm getting very tired
of you, Roland.

521
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:18,017
Roger! Whatever! Take it.

522
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:26,726
Take it.

523
00:40:30,684 --> 00:40:31,892
Take it!

524
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:38,892
Cruella,

525
00:40:40,058 --> 00:40:41,892
the puppies are not for sale.

526
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,726
You're quite sure?

527
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:49,434
Yes. Yes.

528
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,725
All right.

529
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:58,725
Keep the little beasts.
Do what you like with them.

530
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:00,683
Drown them, for all I care.

531
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:02,266
You're a fool, Anita.

532
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:04,683
I've no use for fools.
You're fired!

533
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:06,891
You're finished! You'll never
work in fashion again.

534
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:07,892
I'm through with all of you!

535
00:41:08,392 --> 00:41:09,891
I'll get even!

536
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:11,891
Just wait, you'll be sorry!

537
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:14,267
You fools! You idiots!

538
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,975
Good evening, madam.

539
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,058
Oh! Out of my way!

540
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,266
Hello, Pongo.

541
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:47,267
<i>♪ Oh, everybody wants ♪
♪ to be a cat ♪</i>

542
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:52,057
<i>♪ Everybody, everybody ♪</i>

543
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:56,016
<i>♪ Everybody wants to be a cat ♪</i>

544
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:58,725
Come on you two,
let's go home.

545
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:03,267
Thank you, Pongo.

546
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:09,182
They're here. I've got them.

547
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:13,307
Anita, Roger!
I'm in the living room.

548
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:14,891
Now, come on down
and have a look.

549
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:24,725
Oh, you as well.

550
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:26,725
You heard that, didn't you?

551
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:31,017
Wait till you see what I've
got for you in this bag. Ha!

552
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:35,307
Oh!

553
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:36,142
Jewel.

554
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,392
Aw!

555
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:44,684
Let me put this on you.

556
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:53,809
Dipstick.

557
00:42:54,726 --> 00:42:56,058
Come on.

558
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,809
That a boy. Oh, yeah.

559
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:05,308
Yeah, yeah. I know. Mmm-hmm.

560
00:43:06,308 --> 00:43:07,308
Fidget.

561
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:12,183
Here.

562
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:22,225
Two-Tone

563
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:30,434
I know, I know.
You all like to do that.

564
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:34,517
Here we go, here we go.

565
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:47,434
Wizzer. Wizzer.

566
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:21,726
Right, we're on.

567
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:29,267
Get...

568
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:32,934
Get your own.

569
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,434
Somebody didn't
finish their supper.

570
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:53,516
We're on a budget.

571
00:44:53,517 --> 00:44:56,142
"Waste not, want not,"
that's my motto.

572
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:03,016
Who on earth?

573
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:09,391
Coming, coming.

574
00:45:10,517 --> 00:45:11,517
Coming.

575
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:15,307
Good evening, madam.
Oh! My goodness.

576
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,142
It's all right, lady.
We're professionals.

577
00:45:20,976 --> 00:45:22,141
Come here.

578
00:45:22,142 --> 00:45:25,182
Let go of me.

579
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:27,016
Right, get her off!
I'm gonna...

580
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:31,349
Let go of me. Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

581
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,141
All right. Don't push!
Help! Police!

582
00:45:37,726 --> 00:45:40,683
In you go. No. Ow!

583
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:42,725
Fingers.

584
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:44,975
Let me out of here! Let me out!

585
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:47,182
Open the door! Open this door!
Oh, do shut up!

586
00:45:47,183 --> 00:45:50,349
Police, police!

587
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,057
I'll see you go to jail for this
if it's the last thing I do!

588
00:45:53,058 --> 00:45:55,433
Help! Police!

589
00:45:55,434 --> 00:45:58,725
Well, the old bird
put up a good fight.

590
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:01,182
I like that. I like a bit
of sprit in a woman.

591
00:46:01,183 --> 00:46:03,933
That's all right for you to say. You
didn't get smashed in the face.

592
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,100
Aww!

593
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:13,267
Give me the bag.

594
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:17,183
Come on, come on. Here.

595
00:46:31,475 --> 00:46:32,600
All right. Come here, you.

596
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,559
Spotty little dog.

597
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:53,141
Good evening, General.

598
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:55,600
Montgomery, heel, boy!

599
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:59,100
Heel, boy, heel!

600
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:00,434
Jasper?

601
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:04,142
Do you know what I think?
What's that?

602
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:07,559
I think that bulldog knows
what we've just done.

603
00:47:09,976 --> 00:47:11,891
It's a dog, Horace.

604
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:13,599
Dogs ain't got the brains
to figure things out.

605
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,100
Come on. At ease, boy.

606
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:16,892
Luckily.

607
00:47:26,183 --> 00:47:27,434
Come on home.

608
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:51,934
I mean, I think... Pongo!
Perdy!

609
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:59,100
Police! Where are they?

610
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:05,307
Oh, no!
They've taken the puppies.

611
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:09,600
Anita! Oh! Roger.
Thank God, they're home!

612
00:48:22,392 --> 00:48:23,850
Oh, thank goodness, you've come.

613
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:25,182
What happened? What is it?

614
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:28,391
The puppies. They were two men.
They've stolen the puppies.

615
00:48:28,392 --> 00:48:30,016
I tried to stop them.

616
00:48:30,017 --> 00:48:31,725
They locked me in the cupboard.

617
00:48:31,726 --> 00:48:34,017
I shouted and shouted
but nobody came.

618
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:29,725
Ah, good evening, madam.

619
00:49:29,726 --> 00:49:33,141
I sincerely hope I have not
disturbed your relaxation,

620
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:35,559
but I have some good news.
Did you get the puppies?

621
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:37,934
Affirmative.

622
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:39,767
All of them?

623
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,224
Every single one.

624
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:45,433
My faith in your
limited intelligence

625
00:49:45,434 --> 00:49:47,891
is momentarily restored.

626
00:49:47,892 --> 00:49:50,349
Oh!
You are too kind, madam.

627
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:55,641
We've got the 15!

628
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:59,016
Add them to the other puppies
we've already stolen.

629
00:49:59,017 --> 00:50:03,725
And I have my cozy,
puppy coat.

630
00:50:03,726 --> 00:50:06,766
I'll be wearing
Anita's dogs.

631
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:41,475
Right, well, I'm gonna fill my snoot
and go to bed. I'm dead tired.

632
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,142
I'm hearing dogs again, Jasper.

633
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:48,767
Oh! Shut up in there.

634
00:51:53,434 --> 00:51:54,558
Tango-Foxtrot-23,

635
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,516
report progress on
missing canines, over.

636
00:51:57,517 --> 00:52:00,391
You keep your
chin up. We'll do our best.

637
00:52:00,392 --> 00:52:01,599
Thank you, Inspector.

638
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Goodnight, ma'am. Goodnight.

639
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,891
He was most sympathetic.

640
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,391
He says they're going to do
the best they can.

641
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:11,934
For what that's worth.

642
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:14,599
Do you think they'll find them?

643
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,725
How're they gonna find 15
little puppies in a city this size.

644
00:52:18,726 --> 00:52:20,558
If they're even in the city.

645
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,141
What can the police do?

646
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,851
What can we do?
What can anyone do?

647
00:53:00,434 --> 00:53:03,142
Woof. Woof! Woof!

648
00:56:12,308 --> 00:56:13,142
Pongo!

649
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:16,017
Pongo!

650
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,976
Pongo!

651
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,599
Did you hear that? What?

652
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,975
That noise? What noise?

653
00:58:02,976 --> 00:58:04,267
That noise that I just heard!

654
00:58:05,308 --> 00:58:06,433
Did you hear it?

655
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:09,516
Oh, yeah, yeah.

656
00:58:09,517 --> 00:58:13,100
It sounded just like a complete berk
asking me irritating questions.

657
00:58:15,475 --> 00:58:16,642
Oh, good. It's stopped now.

658
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,182
I'll be honest with you, mate.

659
00:59:00,183 --> 00:59:01,934
This job is fast
losing its charm!

660
00:59:03,308 --> 00:59:06,766
The housing stinks,
food's lousy.

661
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:08,933
The lavatory facilities
are appalling.

662
00:59:08,934 --> 00:59:11,933
And so far, we haven't been
paid so much as one quid.

663
00:59:11,934 --> 00:59:14,599
Oh! Will you stop moaning?

664
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,808
Look, this time tomorrow
night, it's all over.

665
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:19,976
We get our boodle, we'll be out of here
before you can say, "Dead puppies."

666
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,225
Now, go to sleep.

667
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:08,808
Mr. Skinner,
suspicions are mounting,

668
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:10,766
police are everywhere.

669
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,433
I want the job done tonight.
Can you do it?

670
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:22,725
Any way you want. Poison them, drown them.
Bash them on the head.

671
01:01:22,726 --> 01:01:25,307
Got any chloroform? I don't care
how you kill the little beasts,

672
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:26,642
just do it and do it now!

673
01:01:56,642 --> 01:01:59,099
Pongo and Perdy
will turn up, won't they?

674
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,808
If you ask me, they will.

675
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:02,641
I think they just went
looking for the puppies.

676
01:02:02,642 --> 01:02:04,224
You know who did this,
don't you?

677
01:02:04,225 --> 01:02:07,307
I, for one, wouldn't be
the least bit surprised.

678
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:08,308
She has a terrible
temper on her.

679
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,183
The dogs never cared for her.

680
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:15,808
Dogs have a sixth sense
about things like that.

681
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:18,559
They can smell ill intentions.

682
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:22,516
Roger. What? What's wrong?

683
01:02:22,517 --> 01:02:24,599
Nanny, what did I do
with my portfolio?

684
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,516
Uh, it's in the nursery
closet, dear.

685
01:02:27,517 --> 01:02:28,517
Anita?

686
01:02:43,767 --> 01:02:46,517
She did steal the puppies
and this is why.

687
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,058
She's going
to kill the puppies.

688
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:46,017
Right, that's it. Time to let
the little yappers have it.

689
01:04:47,308 --> 01:04:48,641
We ain't supposed to do it.

690
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:50,141
That's Skinner's job.

691
01:04:50,142 --> 01:04:52,975
Well, Skinner isn't here, is he?

692
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:55,642
Besides, I don't see why that little
runt should have all the fun.

693
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:01,182
How'd you wanna do it?

694
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,141
Well, personally,

695
01:05:03,142 --> 01:05:04,726
I think I favor the fire iron.

696
01:05:20,642 --> 01:05:22,517
Right,
that'll be Miss De Vil.

697
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:25,851
Fix your shirt
and tart up your hair.

698
01:05:32,517 --> 01:05:34,183
Good evening...

699
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,100
Hello?

700
01:05:45,726 --> 01:05:46,684
Anybody there?

701
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,851
Maybe we was hearing things.

702
01:07:20,976 --> 01:07:22,017
Oi!

703
01:07:25,434 --> 01:07:26,933
Get out of my truck!

704
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:27,642
Yeah!

705
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:53,851
Go on, get out of here!
Clear out!

706
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:57,766
Yeah.

707
01:07:57,767 --> 01:07:59,683
There's plenty more
where that came from,

708
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:00,559
should you elect to come back.

709
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,392
I don't believe it.

710
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,808
I don't
care what you say,

711
01:09:19,809 --> 01:09:22,933
we bloody well
better be careful.

712
01:09:22,934 --> 01:09:25,433
Yeah, that's right,
what we better be careful of

713
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:30,141
is the huge, thundering, macroeconomic
bulk of your stupidity.

714
01:09:30,142 --> 01:09:32,349
I ain't taking
anymore lip from you, mate.

715
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:33,516
Oh, forget about that.

716
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:36,933
We have got 99 stinking
puppies to find and kill.

717
01:09:36,934 --> 01:09:37,892
Now get on with it.

718
01:09:54,684 --> 01:09:55,809
Here, puppies.

719
01:09:58,017 --> 01:09:59,017
Here, puppies.

720
01:10:02,183 --> 01:10:04,100
Pup, pup, pup, pup, puppies!

721
01:10:17,934 --> 01:10:20,434
Come here, you speckled lab rat.

722
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,642
Ahhh!

723
01:10:44,434 --> 01:10:45,475
Ugh!

724
01:11:26,434 --> 01:11:28,225
Stay!

725
01:11:41,934 --> 01:11:44,599
You...

726
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,559
Oh, come here I'm gonna
get you, you little...

727
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:47,934
Ahhh!

728
01:12:09,183 --> 01:12:09,934
Cold.

729
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:15,809
Good evening, madam.

730
01:13:17,892 --> 01:13:19,516
Good evening. Hello.

731
01:13:19,517 --> 01:13:21,349
What are you doing up there?

732
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:24,559
I am... I was just fetching
the puppies, ma'am.

733
01:13:26,058 --> 01:13:29,975
And where are the puppies?

734
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:32,516
Oh, there, you see, once again,

735
01:13:32,517 --> 01:13:35,349
Madam has, like a laser,

736
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,891
gone straight to
the heart of the issue.

737
01:13:37,892 --> 01:13:40,182
It's a quality
I've always admired.

738
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:41,516
"Where are the puppies?"

739
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:44,016
"Where are the puppies?"
It's brilliant.

740
01:13:44,017 --> 01:13:47,558
Well, let me just say,
um, right now, that I'm not

741
01:13:47,559 --> 01:13:51,683
absolutely 100% certain
where the puppies are,

742
01:13:51,684 --> 01:13:54,349
but if you'll just
give me a second,

743
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,182
I will check with my associate.

744
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:57,183
Uh, Horace!

745
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,766
Get down from there,

746
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:03,017
and catch those puppies!

747
01:14:05,934 --> 01:14:09,307
Hopelessly stupid,
pathetic fools.

748
01:14:09,308 --> 01:14:11,058
I'll find the bloody
mongrels myself.

749
01:14:25,475 --> 01:14:27,433
You just had to let those
puppies get away, didn't you?

750
01:14:27,434 --> 01:14:28,934
Never paying attention.

751
01:14:29,684 --> 01:14:31,558
Oh, where was you?

752
01:14:31,559 --> 01:14:34,266
Where... I was not splashing
around in the pond.

753
01:14:34,267 --> 01:14:36,391
You've infuriated the old bag,

754
01:14:36,392 --> 01:14:39,391
and if we don't get those puppies back
then it's quite literally our heads.

755
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:42,142
Oh, come on!

756
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:46,349
Right, you better get out
and check the tail pipe,

757
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,474
we've got
a condensation problem.

758
01:14:48,475 --> 01:14:49,642
One of these days,

759
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:54,058
I'm gonna be full up of you.

760
01:15:14,058 --> 01:15:15,933
Oh, do come on!

761
01:15:17,642 --> 01:15:18,767
There, you see?

762
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:46,766
Turn the heater on, will you?

763
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:48,558
No.

764
01:17:48,559 --> 01:17:50,307
Not with this thing
acting the way she is,

765
01:17:50,308 --> 01:17:52,100
I don't wanna risk losing power.

766
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:56,392
I can't stand the cold no more.

767
01:17:58,225 --> 01:17:59,308
I want heat.

768
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:02,767
Fire!

769
01:18:04,183 --> 01:18:06,058
Too hot! Too hot!

770
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:25,016
Your suspicions were justified.

771
01:18:25,017 --> 01:18:28,891
According to the staff, Miss De Vil left
earlier for a family property in Suffolk.

772
01:18:28,892 --> 01:18:31,141
I have informed
the local police.

773
01:18:31,142 --> 01:18:34,141
Officers there will be on the
lookout for your puppies.

774
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:34,934
And Miss De Vil.

775
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:39,267
I only hope we're not too late.

776
01:21:09,851 --> 01:21:10,851
Oh!

777
01:21:17,934 --> 01:21:19,475
This is extraordinary.

778
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:24,141
I'm reduced to tramping
through sewage,

779
01:21:24,142 --> 01:21:28,142
because my two imbeciles can't keep
track of a bunch of infant dogs.

780
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:39,016
I do not believe it.
We got no truck, no dogs.

781
01:22:39,017 --> 01:22:41,225
We are so dead. Number One
Dead Street, that's us.

782
01:22:42,934 --> 01:22:43,726
Look!

783
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:45,767
Tracks.

784
01:22:51,392 --> 01:22:52,392
I love you.

785
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,725
There you are, you see,

786
01:22:56,726 --> 01:22:59,224
if dogs are so smart
they wouldn't leave tracks,

787
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:01,891
- for wary predators such as us.
- Yeah.

788
01:23:01,892 --> 01:23:05,266
Now, I've always said, human
beings are essentially superior.

789
01:23:05,267 --> 01:23:07,433
You know, blessed with
faculties of speech,

790
01:23:07,434 --> 01:23:09,392
and thought and a couple
of other things.

791
01:23:44,767 --> 01:23:47,599
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
ruin your little puppy coat,

792
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,141
I'm just gonna make
a few button holes.

793
01:23:49,142 --> 01:23:51,016
Where are you, you filthy beast?

794
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:07,642
Oh, yes!

795
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,809
I love the smell
of near extinction.

796
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,392
Oh, oh, oh!

797
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:56,725
Stupidity, you see.

798
01:24:56,726 --> 01:24:57,975
That's your problem, that's
what has been holding you back.

799
01:24:57,976 --> 01:25:01,725
If it was up to you, you would
have taken hold of that wire,

800
01:25:01,726 --> 01:25:03,808
set fire to your undershorts,

801
01:25:03,809 --> 01:25:05,684
cooked your tongue before even
thinking it was electrified.

802
01:25:08,809 --> 01:25:09,767
Point taken.

803
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:13,434
But what are the logs for?

804
01:25:14,517 --> 01:25:15,517
You see,

805
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,725
we stand upon the logs
and hop over,

806
01:25:20,726 --> 01:25:22,892
thereby avoiding
painful electric shock.

807
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,058
Brilliant. Right.

808
01:25:28,892 --> 01:25:30,392
Mount the log.

809
01:25:35,225 --> 01:25:36,934
Extend leg.

810
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:43,892
All right, now when
I count to three, we jump.

811
01:25:44,684 --> 01:25:45,726
Ready?

812
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:47,434
Yes.

813
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:48,975
One.

814
01:26:24,267 --> 01:26:27,099
Useless, disgusting creatures.

815
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,767
I'm sick to think
we breathe the same air.

816
01:26:41,851 --> 01:26:43,976
Ah! Bingo!

817
01:26:45,809 --> 01:26:47,017
Poor little things.

818
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:52,641
I'm gonna cut you off,
then cut you up.

819
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,684
Darling, red isn't your color.

820
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:03,767
Give me the hat.

821
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:07,516
Give me the hat,

822
01:27:07,517 --> 01:27:09,600
or you'll become a hat.

823
01:27:11,475 --> 01:27:12,475
Give it to me!

824
01:27:35,058 --> 01:27:36,058
Oh!

825
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:53,058
Oh!

826
01:28:16,559 --> 01:28:17,892
Thank the Lord.

827
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,517
We're saved.

828
01:28:22,267 --> 01:28:23,558
- There you go.
- Thank you, again.

829
01:28:23,559 --> 01:28:24,766
- Much obliged.
- Nice and easy.

830
01:28:24,767 --> 01:28:26,517
Watch your heads. Thank you.

831
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:35,058
This is lovely. Isn't it?

832
01:28:36,434 --> 01:28:37,475
Nice and warm.

833
01:28:38,934 --> 01:28:40,392
No animals neither.

834
01:29:05,392 --> 01:29:06,100
You

835
01:29:07,225 --> 01:29:08,100
beasts!

836
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:13,099
But I'm not beaten yet.

837
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,391
You won the battle, but I'm
about to win the wardrobe.

838
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:19,850
My spotted puppy coat is in plain
sight, and leaving tracks.

839
01:29:19,851 --> 01:29:22,224
In a moment, I'll
have what I came for,

840
01:29:22,225 --> 01:29:24,683
while all of you will
end up as sausage meat.

841
01:29:24,684 --> 01:29:27,641
Alone on some sad,
plastic plate.

842
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:29,307
Dead and medium red.

843
01:29:29,308 --> 01:29:31,891
No friends, no family, no pulse.

844
01:29:31,892 --> 01:29:34,266
Just slapped between two buns,

845
01:29:34,267 --> 01:29:37,808
smothered in onions,
with fries on the side.

846
01:29:37,809 --> 01:29:40,766
Cruella De Vil
has the last laugh.

847
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:56,976
Oh!

848
01:30:20,851 --> 01:30:22,057
Miss De Vil.

849
01:30:22,058 --> 01:30:24,182
Yes.

850
01:30:24,183 --> 01:30:25,350
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

851
01:30:26,017 --> 01:30:27,017
Oh.

852
01:30:28,142 --> 01:30:29,517
Is there something wrong?

853
01:30:46,892 --> 01:30:47,892
Stop!

854
01:30:48,934 --> 01:30:50,225
What's that up ahead?

855
01:30:59,517 --> 01:31:01,600
Well, will you look at that.

856
01:31:41,308 --> 01:31:42,975
I've come up with 98 pups.

857
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,767
The two adults make it 100 even.

858
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,975
We've got 100 here, sir.

859
01:32:04,642 --> 01:32:09,142
Um, make that
101 Dalmatians, sir.

860
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:30,224
Congratulations.

861
01:32:30,225 --> 01:32:32,350
You've just won
gold, silver and bronze,

862
01:32:33,183 --> 01:32:35,100
in the morons' Olympics.

863
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:46,142
Who won the gold? Shut up!

864
01:32:48,183 --> 01:32:51,933
My business. My reputation.
My life,

865
01:32:51,934 --> 01:32:55,141
has been ruined because you
three incompetent twits,

866
01:32:55,142 --> 01:32:58,891
let yourselves be outsmarted
by a bunch of dumb animals,

867
01:32:58,892 --> 01:33:01,725
and you call
yourselves men, huh?

868
01:33:01,726 --> 01:33:03,976
I've seen more intelligent
pieces of carpet.

869
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:31,726
They're here. Anita, Roger.

870
01:33:38,684 --> 01:33:40,182
The puppies.

871
01:33:40,183 --> 01:33:41,892
Oh, my goodness, look at them.

872
01:33:44,183 --> 01:33:45,392
Oh!

873
01:33:49,017 --> 01:33:50,474
Good boy.

874
01:33:50,475 --> 01:33:52,058
They're happy to be home!

875
01:33:55,392 --> 01:33:57,559
Oh, thank you, Officer,
how can we ever repay you?

876
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:01,391
Well.

877
01:34:01,392 --> 01:34:04,391
Your dogs were the only ones
with identification tags,

878
01:34:04,392 --> 01:34:08,391
we have no idea
which puppy goes where.

879
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:12,559
Our records indicate that so far nobody
has called to claim the other puppies.

880
01:34:14,225 --> 01:34:17,642
Now, they need a home. Or,
well, they go to the pound.

881
01:34:26,809 --> 01:34:28,516
Oh, no, no!

882
01:34:28,517 --> 01:34:32,057
No, no, no. Roger we
can't, we don't have room.

883
01:34:32,058 --> 01:34:33,933
Well, we'll get a bigger place.

884
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:37,016
We have 17 as it is,
what's a few more?

885
01:34:37,017 --> 01:34:38,434
We'll work something out.

886
01:34:48,976 --> 01:34:51,142
You'll have dozens
of children, you know?

887
01:34:54,892 --> 01:34:57,307
Well, I won't have them
chewing up the carpets,

888
01:34:57,308 --> 01:34:58,475
barking at all hours
of the night.

889
01:35:03,976 --> 01:35:07,308
All right, everyone inside
before we all get cold.

890
01:35:08,183 --> 01:35:09,434
Unload the puppies.

891
01:36:11,392 --> 01:36:12,517
Get ready, get ready.

892
01:36:22,058 --> 01:36:23,183
Ahhh!

893
01:36:27,058 --> 01:36:28,058
Cool!

894
01:36:29,267 --> 01:36:30,684
Excellent villain, mate!

895
01:36:32,517 --> 01:36:34,224
Thanks, Herbert.
Congratulations.

896
01:36:34,225 --> 01:36:36,016
Huh, what, yeah, thank you.

897
01:36:36,017 --> 01:36:38,891
Thank you. See you in my office,
we've got terms to sort out.

898
01:36:38,892 --> 01:36:40,766
Okay, good.

899
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:42,057
Excellent villain, mate.

900
01:36:48,308 --> 01:36:51,766
I can barely believe
it, our baby is a year old,

901
01:36:51,767 --> 01:36:54,349
we have a new house, a new life.

902
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,766
And we have each other.

903
01:36:55,767 --> 01:36:57,808
We have Nanny.

904
01:36:57,809 --> 01:36:59,599
And I have the three of you.

905
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,766
We have two wonderful dogs.

906
01:37:01,767 --> 01:37:04,182
And they have their children.

907
01:37:04,183 --> 01:37:06,307
And their step-children.

908
01:37:06,308 --> 01:37:08,599
And they have their children.

909
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,933
Their step-children
have children.

910
01:37:10,934 --> 01:37:13,766
And their children
have children.

911
01:37:13,767 --> 01:37:17,266
And speaking of children.

912
01:37:17,267 --> 01:37:21,224
