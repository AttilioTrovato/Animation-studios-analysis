1
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,687
<i>The reason for calling
this conference at this moment</i>

2
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,769
<i>is that we are convinced</i>

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,567
<i>that we have overcome
the major financial crisis,</i>

4
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,731
<i>a crisis in severity
unparalleled in world history,</i>

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,562
<i>and that, with its relaxation,
confidence and hope have reappeared.</i>

6
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,525
<i>Happy days are here again</i>

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,166
<i>The skies above are clear again</i>

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,364
<i>All anybody talked about
was the Great Depression,</i>

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,361
<i>how bad things were and how
the good times were around the corner.</i>

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,690
<i>I must've worn out every corner
looking for those good times,</i>

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>before realising
my destiny lay somewhere else.</i>

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,767
<i>Anywhere else.</i>

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,601
<i>Happy days are here again</i>

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,804
<i>Your cares and troubles are gone</i>

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,721
<i>There'll be no more from now on</i>

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,284
<i>Happy days are here again</i>

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,927
<i>The skies above are clear again</i>

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,363
<i>Let us sing a song of cheer again</i>

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,051
<i>Happy days are here again</i>

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,881
Ready, Sonora?
You don't want to be late for school.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,650
Be right there.

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,845
- Where's your sister?
- She's coming, Aunt Helen.

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,407
Sonora, quit lolly-gagging!

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,525
Sonora, what are you doing?

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,091
<i>What have you done?
What am I gonna do with you?</i>

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,851
<i>No, Aunt Helen, don't, please!</i>

27
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,806
<i>You'll wear it and that's final.
No more back talk!</i>

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,766
<i>Get out!
I don't even want to look at you!</i>

29
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,568
Come here, Lightning, what's wrong?

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,249
Whoa, easy.

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,205
Hold still, let me get...

32
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,090
There. There you go.
That's better, huh, boy?

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,170
Isn't that sweet?
Nice haircut, Sonora.

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,604
Who cut it?
A blind man with a butcher knife?

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,522
- The ugliest haircut I've ever seen.
- Ugly? She should look in a mirror.

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,964
- Come on, Lightning.
- Where to? The glue factory?

37
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,323
- He's the best horse in the county.
- Yeah, sure!

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,366
He is. Lightning can out-jump
any horse around.

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,485
Can he jump that fence over there?

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,570
- He can jump twice that high.
- Prove it.

41
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,845
- I don't want to be late for school.
- Chicken!

42
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,403
You're just scared. Go on, do it.

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,887
I dare you.

44
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,128
I double-dare you.

45
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,727
OK. You just watch.

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,041
I think my big mouth
just got us into trouble.

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,325
Come on, Lightning. Come on.

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,525
- She's gonna do it!
- Go on, Lightning.

49
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,200
Come on.

50
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,245
Let's get out of here!

51
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,888
Wait! Get back!

52
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,925
Help!

53
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,408
The noun of the sentence is 'boy'.

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,968
The verb of the sentence is...

55
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,807
- You're late, Sonora.
- I'm very sorry, Miss Simpson.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,723
- You're getting detention for this.
- But it's not my fault. The cows...

57
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,845
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Take your seat.

58
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,850
- Yes, ma'am.
- Moo...

59
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,850
Class! Class, quiet! Quiet!

60
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,770
Clarabelle... Oh, my God.

61
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,566
Sonora, leave this room immediately.

62
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,207
Young lady, remove yourself.
You must leave!

63
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,047
Sonora Webster is officially
suspended from school for one week.

64
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,686
I'm informing your aunt.

65
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,850
No one talks to her.

66
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,290
She's not here!

67
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,602
Two red ones and... a green one.

68
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,167
No, ma'am, please, right here.

69
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,960
Sonora, tell your aunt that her blue
thread will be here in a few days.

70
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,927
- OK, I will.
- There you go, Arnette.

71
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,607
I'm going over to see Sarah.
I'll see you at the house.

72
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,328
"Young girl...

73
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,682
"...diving horses.

74
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,009
"Willing to travel."

75
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,688
Thank you, ma'am.

76
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,929
- You ready?
- Let's go!

77
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,486
What are you doing with Lightning?

78
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,650
- I sold him.
- No, you can't!

79
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,926
- Why? I didn't do anything wrong!
- You let the cows out this morning.

80
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,169
- That was an accident!
- And got suspended from school.

81
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,684
Ever since your mom and dad died,
you've been nothing but trouble.

82
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,769
Let me go!

83
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,081
Sonora? What are you doing?

84
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,248
Nothing.

85
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,608
I took you and Arnette in
because you're my sister's children.

86
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,966
But ever since you came here,
you've been nothing but a burden.

87
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,881
There's a depression going on,
there's extra mouths to feed...

88
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,041
So I've decided
I'm gonna turn you over to the state.

89
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,969
The state?

90
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,121
They'll feed you and take care of you
until you come of age.

91
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,051
You're just gonna kick us out?

92
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,449
No, Arnette'll stay here with me.

93
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,769
It's just gonna be you.

94
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,730
You're going tomorrow, you hear?

95
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,128
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,042
Come on, now... help me with supper.

97
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,728
Get off of there!

98
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,768
Everything you got!

99
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,368
Yes, sir!

100
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,727
- Fight! Fight!
- There's a fight over here!

101
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,890
They caught him cheating.

102
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,042
I thought this was a friendly game.

103
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,201
You're hiding an ace in your hat,
and we're gonna find it.

104
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,930
You better say your prayers.

105
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,446
Looks like I was wrong. Let him go.

106
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,768
I apologise.

107
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,691
You crumpled my hat.

108
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,885
But that's OK, I like it like this.
I'll see you, fellas.

109
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,608
- Got cold soda.
- Let me have one.

110
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,409
<i>Balloons on a stick! Right here!
A nickel a piece, any colour!</i>

111
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,721
Son of a monkey turned fire...
Damn!

112
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,888
Let me help.

113
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,366
- Never had a girl spit on me before.
- It'll take the sting right out.

114
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,484
Selling hot dogs can be
a dangerous job.

115
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,846
This? This isn't my job.
It's temporary until I get my act going.

116
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,601
- What kind of act?
- I'm still experimenting.

117
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,124
But it will be death-defying.
It will definitely defy death.

118
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,324
- There you go. Feel better?
- Uh-huh.

119
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,528
- It's a funny way of cooking hot dogs.
- It's my own invention. Want one?

120
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,727
- I don't have any money.
- It's on the house for fixing my finger.

121
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,888
I'm Clifford Henderson.

122
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,048
Sonora Webster.

123
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,684
Good to meet you.

124
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,969
- Where can I find a Dr W F Carver?
- Through there, across the fairgrounds.

125
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,128
Thank you.

126
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,802
- Thanks for the hot dog. Take care.
- Thanks for...

127
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,651
...spitting on me.

128
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,970
- That's the last thing I wanna do.
- I got a show to run!

129
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,209
- I missed a couple.
- You missed three!

130
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:28,170
- Is chasing women more important?
- No, but it's a lot more fun. Have that.

131
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,691
Get outta here, son. Load the truck.

132
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,445
Dr Carver?

133
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,881
This is your lucky day.

134
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,085
You don't need this any more.
I'm here to answer your ad.

135
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,285
- Who are you?
- Your new diving girl!

136
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,251
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

137
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,206
- One thing, I don't like you.
- You don't know me.

138
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,329
Secondly, you're interrupting my
business, and thirdly, you're too puny.

139
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,969
I don't know what a diving girl
does exactly, but I can do it.

140
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,361
- 'Cause I can do anything!
- Good! Then you can get outta here.

141
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,604
I am a very busy man.

142
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,570
I do not have time to play
with children. Now, get off that chair.

143
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,606
Give me a chance.
I only want a chance.

144
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,723
Let me explain.

145
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,969
A diving girl has to be strong.

146
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,927
A diving girl has to be brave, fearless.
A showman!

147
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,729
Now, there is a diving girl!

148
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,731
You gotta have more...

149
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,720
You gotta have more
than what you got.

150
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,922
Well, I'll get it.

151
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,971
What's your name?

152
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,049
Sonora Webster.

153
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,406
Let me tell you something.
You go out there, cross the fairgrounds,

154
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,766
turn left at the gate, and keep walking
until you get to the bus station.

155
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,171
I'm not gonna leave
until you give me a job.

156
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,328
Have a good trip!

157
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,610
Al?

158
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,367
- Dr Carver sent me to see you.
- He did?

159
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,010
Yeah. We just talked, and he thinks
I'd make a perfect diving girl.

160
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,202
- That's what he said?
- Uh-huh.

161
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,930
- He said you'd explain the show to me.
- Sure. Come on.

162
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,762
The show's real exciting.
And that's the tower.

163
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,011
OK. Fine. Thank you very much.

164
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,087
You dropped this.

165
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,725
So, now I'm a babysitter!

166
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,602
- You're not afraid of heights, are you?
- Me? No.

167
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,690
- How do the horses jump?
- We train them.

168
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,920
- Don't they get scared?
- If they do, we don't let them near.

169
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,125
- You push them off?
- No, they jump on their own.

170
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,561
We don't use any devices.

171
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,721
- Do the horses ever get hurt?
- No. Just the riders.

172
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,288
It's rough.
You travel around, barely getting by.

173
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,168
The old man, he's tough.
He'll push you till you break.

174
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,761
Go back to where you came from.
You don't want to be a diving girl.

175
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,487
I've a glorious idea for a new poster.
A falling shot of me.

176
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,720
And, in the corner in an oval frame,
a picture of my face, smiling.

177
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,970
- I'll think about it, Marie.
- It'll sell lots of tickets.

178
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,006
Maybe Movietone will come,
take a moving picture?

179
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,124
- I'll think about it, Marie.
- Hi.

180
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,166
- We're not buying pencils today.
- Miss your bus?

181
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,049
- I won't leave till you give me a job.
- She wants to be a diving girl.

182
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,885
That's a wonderful idea!
She could bring glamour to the act.

183
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,890
- What are you doing?
- This way, he gets used to my smell.

184
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,529
That's right.
Indians used to do that on the plains.

185
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,486
Really? I thought I just made that up.

186
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,322
- Can you handle a wheelbarrow?
- I was born handling a wheelbarrow!

187
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,809
- Can you shovel manure?
- Manure's my speciality.

188
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,243
I believe that.
Are your family looking for you?

189
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,082
- No.
- I'll not give you a job as a diving girl.

190
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,365
But we're leaving for Virginia
and I could use a stable-hand.

191
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,166
- You interested?
- Yeah!

192
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,523
- Let's go to Virginia.
- All right.

193
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,684
<i>Virginia! I couldn't believe my luck.</i>

194
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,690
<i>I'd never been to another state before.</i>

195
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,360
<i>I was really seeing the world now.</i>

196
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,522
<i>Even if my view was more of where
we'd been, I wasn't gonna complain.</i>

197
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,682
<i>I finally had a real job, helping
with the horses in the off-season.</i>

198
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,965
<i>And I was staying in the most
beautiful house I'd ever seen.</i>

199
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,162
<i>Things were definitely looking up.</i>

200
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,002
<i>From here on,
my life was gonna be just swell.</i>

201
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,171
You wouldn't mind giving me a hand,
would you?

202
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,049
<i>Get them horses ready.
Hurry up! We've a lot of work to do!</i>

203
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,642
Lord knows what shape the barn's in.

204
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,322
It's OK. I got everything under control.

205
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,569
Sonora! Come get this horse, please!

206
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,044
Wash him down and make sure he's dry.
Can you manage that?

207
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,924
Hi, Al! How're you doing?

208
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,602
- Red Lips, easy! Whoa!
- Hold him. Hold the horse!

209
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,044
Come here with this horse.
Get him in the stable.

210
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,926
You can't handle the animal,
don't go near him.

211
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,331
- Nice horse, huh?
- It's spooked. Where'd you get him?

212
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,967
I won him in a poker game.
Full house, queens over threes.

213
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,243
- Looks loco to me.
- He needs a little training.

214
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,321
Do what you want,
just keep him from hurting people.

215
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,529
Come on, just one little bite.

216
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,643
Come on.

217
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,208
I should know the horses
if I'm to be a diving girl.

218
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,769
- You think you can do it?
- If Dr Carver gives me a chance.

219
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,567
He's not gonna give you a chance,
unless...

220
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,966
if you rode up on this horse he might.
We could train him.

221
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,007
- What are we waiting for?
- Not now. First thing in the morning.

222
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,249
- All right.
- The old man can't know.

223
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,728
- It'll be our secret.
- OK.

224
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,004
Al, get up!

225
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,240
Come on, wake up.
We're supposed to start training.

226
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,568
Oh, right...

227
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,568
Easy, boy, easy.

228
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,008
- Easy, boy, whoa. Whoa.
- Attaboy.

229
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,371
- Whoa. What's this horse's name?
- I don't know.

230
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,929
- It's gotta have a name.
- All right. How about Clarence?

231
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,728
- That's no name for a horse.
- If you're so smart, you pick one.

232
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,490
Lightning.

233
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,488
Stay behind.
Keep your whip on the ground.

234
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Come on, go, go, go!
Let him see the whip.

235
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,250
Come on!

236
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,249
Easy, boy. Here, you take him.

237
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,481
- What's your secret wish?
- My secret wish?

238
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,241
- What did you always want to be?
- Well...

239
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,162
I wanted to be a showman
like my dad. Not any more.

240
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,931
What do you want to be now?

241
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,441
Anything but like him.

242
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,768
What's your secret wish?

243
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,522
To get to Atlantic City,
where all your dreams come true.

244
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,406
- You believe that?
- With all my heart.

245
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,570
It says so right here.

246
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,970
See?

247
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,603
It's the greatest show place in America.
And someday, I'm gonna be there.

248
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,968
- <i>What happened to your parents?</i>
- <i>Died. They got the fever.</i>

249
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,285
- <i>Where's your mom?</i>
- <i>She's gone.</i>

250
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,087
- <i>Where?</i>
- <i>I don't know. She left a long time ago.</i>

251
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,931
<i>She left because of my dad.</i>

252
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,286
- Now, just sit there. Don't rush it.
- You worry too much.

253
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,970
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

254
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,849
He's got ticklish flanks.
Never use your heels.

255
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,648
I figured that out
as I was flying through the air.

256
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,969
He's doing good, though.

257
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,568
So are you.

258
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,769
Come on, we got a lot of work to do
before the old man wakes up.

259
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,608
Nice and easy.

260
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,370
OK?

261
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,370
Good boy.

262
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,760
- You like the movies?
- Like them? I'll be in them some day.

263
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,443
- How are you gonna do that?
- Be discovered, of course.

264
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,167
Diving horses is great exposure.

265
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,921
You're pretty enough
to be in the movies.

266
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,169
- You sure look nice tonight.
- Thank you.

267
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,082
Al's taking me dancing
at the Silver Palm.

268
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,047
- Dancing?
- Oh, yes. Al's a terrific dancer.

269
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,007
- Smooth as hot honey.
- That's nice.

270
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,405
You poor thing.

271
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,925
- Who does your hair?
- I do.

272
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,521
You should take care
with your appearance.

273
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,284
Having no natural beauty of your own,
you really need to help yourself.

274
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,051
Have a good night.

275
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,683
- Don't tell me how to run my business.
- You should sell the show.

276
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,363
You're running all over the country
for 10 cents a ticket?

277
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,804
It's old and tired.
Times have changed, it's 1932.

278
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,962
We got the Empire State Building,
aeroplanes crossing the ocean.

279
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,767
This cowboy stuff is old-fashioned.
Like your fringe jacket.

280
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,205
- That's a gift from Buffalo Bill Cody.
- Exactly, it's from another century.

281
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:01,042
- Would you pass the peas, please?
- Sonora, I see you got your hair... done.

282
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,406
- Did you do it yourself?
- I went to the Clip 'N' Curl.

283
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,365
Would you pass the peas?

284
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,921
It's good pork chop, Marie.

285
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,289
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

286
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,248
- I like your dress.
- You scared me!

287
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,602
Sorry.

288
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,771
It's a hot night.
A good night to go swimming.

289
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,522
- Who? You and Marie?
- No. You and me.

290
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,601
- No, thank you.
- Come on, I know the perfect place.

291
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,770
I'm not going swimming.

292
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,330
Come here.

293
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,522
- I gotta go.
- Sonora, wait!

294
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,324
Sorry.

295
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,090
Good night.

296
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,201
<i>Roosevelt received one of the
largest demonstrations for a candidate.</i>

297
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,247
<i>Now let's resume
to the Skylark Ballroom Orchestra...</i>

298
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,410
Don't drink out of the bottle.

299
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,686
- You better watch yourself.
- What's that supposed to mean?

300
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,928
She's young.

301
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,169
She don't know any better.

302
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,241
- I don't want you messing up her life.
- I haven't done anything.

303
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,284
Keep it that way.

304
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,324
Hey!

305
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,730
What?

306
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,048
Put the milk away.

307
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,081
- Nice day, huh?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

308
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,050
My goodness, would you look at that?

309
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,481
- What are you doing?
- Riding.

310
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,164
- Do you know anything about this?
- I'm as surprised as you are.

311
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,249
So you can ride.

312
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,603
- I can dive, too, given a chance.
- Ridiculous!

313
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,962
She deserves a chance.

314
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,686
- You do, do you?
- Yeah.

315
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,362
- Can you make a moving mount?
- Never tried.

316
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,691
If you can mount him while he's moving,
I'll let you train to be a diving girl.

317
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,850
It beats shovelling manure. Come on!

318
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,003
Reach out, touch the harness.
Get used to the rhythm.

319
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,570
When he passes, grab the harness
and pull yourself on. Concentrate.

320
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,364
You ready?

321
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,962
Whoa! Stay there, don't move.

322
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,171
Does your nose feel broken?

323
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,410
No. But I don't know
what a broken nose feels like.

324
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,810
- All right, let's get you in the house.
- Ls that it?

325
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,651
You gonna quit?

326
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,640
Let me look at the nose.
The nose ain't broke.

327
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,731
- She can still ride. Do it again.
- She's hurt.

328
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,161
Shut your gate!

329
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,322
- Sonora, you don't have to do this.
- It's all right, Al, I can do it.

330
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,085
Nothing's handed to you in this world,
Sonora. You gotta earn it.

331
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,005
You gonna cry?

332
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,089
You gonna cry?

333
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,046
I never cry.

334
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,891
Good. Let's go.

335
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,848
Don't be in too big a hurry,
just sense the horse's rhythm.

336
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,569
- Attagirl!
- I did it, boy! We did it!

337
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,091
All right!

338
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,522
OK. Good!
Now you can train to be a diving girl.

339
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,724
Come on down. Go get cleaned up.

340
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,884
- What are you trying to prove?
- She did it, didn't she?

341
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,163
You push too hard.

342
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:10,322
- Well, she didn't quit.
- What? Like me? Like my mother?

343
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,528
No matter how hard anyone tries,
it's not good enough for you.

344
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,007
Stupid old man.

345
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,122
- No, Al!
- Come on!

346
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,163
Al!

347
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,520
Al, where are you going?

348
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,090
I should've left a long time ago.
I can't keep fighting him.

349
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,124
He doesn't care about me or anybody.

350
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,086
The only thing he cares about
is his stupid show.

351
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,124
Please don't go.

352
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,210
I'm sorry.

353
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,251
Write me.

354
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,408
I promise.

355
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,764
<i>Dear Sonora, I hope you understand
why I had to leave.</i>

356
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,201
<i>I keep thinking about you.</i>

357
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,802
<i>I miss you. Please write me.</i>

358
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,881
- ls that the mail?
- Yeah.

359
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,970
Did I get anything? Any letters?

360
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,730
Nope.

361
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,247
- I'll show you how.
- He's used to me.

362
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,240
- Don't tell me my business.
- She has a point.

363
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,681
Get down.

364
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,727
Just watch and you'll learn.

365
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,730
Don't use your heels.

366
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,488
She used her heels.

367
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,286
<i>I hate that horse!</i>

368
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,683
- ls it as bad as it sounds?
- She always wanted to be an actress.

369
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,645
Is she gonna be OK?

370
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,890
She's dislocated her shoulder.
The doctor's putting it in a sling.

371
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,644
I can't take any more of this.

372
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,410
Lord!

373
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,404
She'll be stove-up for six weeks.

374
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,568
Six weeks?

375
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,928
- We got a booking in three days.
- Where will you find a diving girl?

376
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,803
The tower's not as high as it looks.
Honest. I've been there.

377
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,721
- Hi. Remember me?
- Yeah. Hot dogs.

378
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,447
- Not any more. My stand burned down.
- Sorry.

379
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,122
Dr Carver gave me a job.
I'm your new groom.

380
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,641
That's great.

381
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,889
- I heard you're diving today.
- My first time.

382
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,608
- Nervous?
- Me? Nervous? Heck, no!

383
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,889
- Sonora?
- Come in!

384
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,970
- You all right?
- I feel great.

385
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,571
Good, good.

386
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,163
- My bathing suit doesn't fit.
- You'll grow into it.

387
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,331
- What if it falls off?
- We'll give refunds.

388
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,243
Do it just like we practised, right?
Keep your eye on the harness.

389
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,489
- Don't forget to...
- ...grip.

390
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,164
And don't forget to put your head
to the side. Right? All right.

391
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,807
- You'll do fine.
- There is one thing.

392
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,561
Do I have to bow? I'll feel stupid.

393
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,368
I don't care if you fall on your head,
you will smile and bow.

394
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,325
- But I just...
- Bow.

395
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,049
What if I can't do it?
What if I lose my nerve?

396
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,290
- You'll do it.
- But what if I can't?

397
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,323
Will you hate me?

398
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,608
If you feel nervous, look for me.
I'll be in front of the crowd.

399
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,369
Still don't want to bow.

400
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,761
Sonora and her brave horse, Lightning!

401
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:28,687
Sonora, ladies and gentlemen,
and her brave horse, Lightning!

402
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,010
Sonora, ladies and gentlemen!

403
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,644
Sonora!

404
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,771
We got a new diving girl!

405
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,486
And a new diving horse.

406
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,891
- Do we get to be on a poster?
- Yeah. "Marie and Sonora, diving girls!"

407
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,289
I refuse to share billing
with a stable-hand.

408
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,767
Marie, she made the dive.

409
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,249
She is not the star of the show. I am!

410
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,330
You are, but we got two diving girls.

411
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,641
Well, since I'm the star, I'd like more
money and a bigger dressing room.

412
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,481
- There's a depression!
- More money, a dressing room.

413
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,365
And a better poster, or I quit.

414
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,530
I can't do that, Marie.

415
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,810
- Well, then, I quit.
- Don't be stubborn. You can't quit!

416
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,368
I am an actress, not a circus performer!

417
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,610
The next time you see me,
I'm going to be a big star!

418
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,690
And you will still be shovelling manure!

419
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,440
<i>All spring, we travelled from one fair
to the next, doing three shows a day.</i>

420
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,564
<i>Lightning got better with each dive.</i>

421
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,888
<i>And I wasn't bad, either.</i>

422
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,608
<i>Everything was going great,
except for one thing.</i>

423
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,967
<i>Now and then it seems to me</i>

424
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,087
<i>It weren't so bad what used to be</i>

425
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,968
<i>Here and now it seems so true</i>

426
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,848
<i>This feeling blue, wishing</i>

427
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,523
<i>Wishing it just weren't true</i>

428
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,689
<i>My dreams are gone
yet I linger on</i>

429
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,169
<i>As hope drifts into despair</i>

430
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,245
<i>All around us
The blues surround us</i>

431
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,411
<i>Why, Lord, is life so unfair?</i>

432
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,964
<i>Now and then it seems to me</i>

433
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,927
<i>It weren't so bad what used to be</i>

434
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,042
<i>Here and now
Through and through</i>

435
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,768
<i>This sinking down
This feeling blue</i>

436
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,281
<i>And I'm wishing</i>

437
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,042
<i>Wishing it just weren't true</i>

438
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,242
What are you doing now?

439
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,410
Finishing that letter to Franklin County.

440
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,126
He promised he'd write me.
Why doesn't he?

441
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,244
Thanks for your time.

442
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,410
We'll see what we can do.

443
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,650
What if we can't book another show?

444
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,526
That's why I'm driving
to Franklin County to find work.

445
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,850
- What if there isn't?
- I'll keep the show open, I promise.

446
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,010
If he doesn't, I will.

447
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,805
Now, listen. Keep those horses
fed and watered.

448
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,889
It's very important.

449
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,527
- We won't be back till morning.
- Don't worry.

450
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,210
I know.

451
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,368
Hey, Red Lips.

452
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,090
Lightning!

453
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,243
Lightning, what's the matter?
Come on, get up.

454
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,049
What's wrong?

455
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,690
Al.

456
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,284
- What happened?
- I don't know. He's awful sick.

457
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,608
Easy, boy, easy.

458
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,161
What is it, Al?
What's wrong with him?

459
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,964
- Did Red Lips eat this hay?
- No.

460
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,845
It's mouldy, it's given him colic.

461
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,761
We gotta get water into him.
Where's the tactron?

462
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,088
In the barn.

463
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,363
It's gonna be OK, boy.

464
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:49,368
Hold this here, while I pump.
Hold it there. Good.

465
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,166
All right, come here.

466
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,246
Take this and, when I tell you to, pull.

467
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,968
All right, pull! Come on!

468
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,765
Pull! Come on, Lightning!

469
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,769
Come on, boy.

470
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,531
- Whoa!
- That's it!

471
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,008
Good boy, Lightning. Good boy.

472
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,648
- Come on, we gotta get him moving.
- Come on, Lightning.

473
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,091
- He'll be OK?
- Yeah, he'll be just fine.

474
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,042
Would somebody please say something?

475
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,646
I thought you could use a hand
with the show.

476
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,808
Ain't no show.

477
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,250
So, why didn't you answer my letters?

478
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,488
I didn't get any letters.

479
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,967
I wrote you just about every day.

480
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,448
What did you say?

481
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,289
- Stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

482
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,801
You know... stuff.

483
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,930
I got a telegram from a John Slater
from Atlantic City.

484
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:14,524
- Atlantic City?
- At Steel Pier. A six-month contract.

485
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,529
You did this?

486
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,566
Someone once told me
it's where all your dreams come true.

487
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,842
You didn't say anything.

488
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,204
- Slater just said he'd think about it.
- What did you tell him?

489
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,722
I told him the diving horse show
was very exciting,

490
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,686
and that my father
was mean and stubborn.

491
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,406
And that he was the greatest
showman on earth.

492
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,203
<i>On the boardwalk in Atlantic City
Life can be peaches and cream</i>

493
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,566
<i>Cinderella, you will find your fella
Someone that you've waited for</i>

494
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,970
<i>In romantic, enchantic, Atlantic City</i>

495
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,690
<i>Down by the old New Jersey shore</i>

496
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,210
Yep.

497
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,122
You know, Sonora,
sometimes people make mistakes.

498
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,291
It's hard to admit when you have.

499
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,520
- Are you OK? You look pale.
- I'm fine.

500
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:43,409
When Al was gone all those months
and you didn't hear from him,

501
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,204
I did...

502
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,165
I did something that...

503
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,762
- Are you sure you're OK?
- I'm fine. I'll pull over to take a breather.

504
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,206
- Why did we stop?
- I wanted a little breather.

505
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,008
- Good, I'm hungry.
- Rest, and we'll set up a picnic.

506
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,124
Dad, when we get to Atlantic City,

507
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,564
the first thing we gotta do
is buy you a new suit.

508
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,731
- Double-breasted?
- Yep. With pinstripes.

509
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,529
Yeah.

510
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,490
Yeah.

511
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,928
And now, as we've all read,
the book of God's word:

512
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,641
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

513
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:41,050
"we now return the spirit
of our departed brother..."

514
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,561
- Your dad wanted top billing or nothing.
- We get top billing?

515
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,411
- See for yourself.
- Al, that's me!

516
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,924
- It sure is.
- That's me and that's Lightning!

517
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,566
You know Frenchie?
He was gonna throw this away.

518
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,561
- That thing's a piece of junk.
- I'm gonna fix it all up.

519
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,606
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'll think of something.

520
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,963
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting...

521
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,411
Ladies and gentlemen, we now present

522
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,810
Carver's high-diving horse and girl rider!

523
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,608
I was rehearsing.

524
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,280
"Ladies and gentlemen..."

525
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,167
I never introduced a show before.
Should I wear this suit tomorrow?

526
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,126
- I don't think it'll help.
- Come here!

527
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,808
"Ladies and gentlemen..."

528
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,848
Stay here.

529
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,523
Introducing...

530
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,484
<i>There was a time I couldn't imagine
spending my life with just one person.</i>

531
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,366
<i>Now I can't imagine
spending it without you.</i>

532
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,325
<i>I love you, Sonora.</i>

533
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,688
I thought I lost you.

534
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,770
What?

535
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,846
What is it?

536
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,010
This is what you should wear.

537
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,681
Turn around. Let's see how it looks.

538
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,690
Shoulders back.

539
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,247
Now raise your arms a bit.

540
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,889
Higher.

541
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,048
Higher!

542
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,368
- Whoa!
- Easy, easy!

543
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,803
- He's jittery.
- He's not used to the noise.

544
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,006
- Maybe we should jump Lightning.
- He's not well enough yet.

545
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:41,691
<i>Sonora, Sonora Webster,
I want you for my wife.</i>

546
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,884
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

547
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,250
Take my hand in marriage
and make me a happy man.

548
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,729
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- About you.

549
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,605
I've never been so embarrassed!

550
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,168
All you have to do is say yes.

551
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,647
Yes! Yes! Yes!

552
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,808
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

553
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,126
It's just tinted glass. When things
get better, I'll get you a real one.

554
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,642
Are you gonna marry me, yes or no?

555
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,491
Yes! Yes! Yes!

556
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,528
Yes.

557
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,730
Go on, we got a show to do.

558
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,404
Take him.

559
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,841
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

560
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,721
- Is Red Lips hurt?
- I don't think so.

561
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,288
Come on.
Are you sure you're all right?

562
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,205
Just stunned. When I hit the water,
I had my eyes open.

563
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,849
- Clifford, is he OK?
- He seems OK. What about you?

564
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:34,843
- Let's get you to the doctor.
- I'm not bleeding, no broken bones.

565
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,008
Let's get him to the stables.

566
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,281
<i>Excuse me, but you must be still.</i>

567
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,289
Sorry.

568
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,524
- What about Slater?
- He was concerned...

569
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,647
- Tell him not to worry. I'll be fine.
- Why didn't you see a doctor sooner?

570
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,764
They stung a little, that's all.

571
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,884
- Your eyes were open?
- Yes.

572
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,881
It caused a slight haemorrhage,
which has continued for days.

573
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,324
The blood has clotted and detached
the retina in both eyes.

574
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,444
What does that mean?

575
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,849
Her condition is permanent.

576
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,008
No, it's not!

577
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,963
I'm sorry.

578
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,369
Why are you sorry?

579
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,487
I'm gonna rest and then get back
to work, it's only temporary.

580
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,047
I'm not blind.

581
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,805
It's a real tough break.
Now, about the show...

582
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,689
This may not be the best time to talk,
but business is business.

583
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,963
That diving tower wasn't cheap,
the publicity...

584
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,006
Publicity?
I don't care about your publicity!

585
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,043
Are you crazy?

586
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,249
I'll give you a break.
You can close the show for one week.

587
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,048
- But that's all.
- I can't train a new girl in a week.

588
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:57,407
You better come up with something,
or I'll sue you for breach of contract.

589
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,323
One, two, three, four,

590
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,761
five, six...

591
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,923
One, two, three...

592
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,806
The blues are here,
right next to the greens, all right?

593
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,607
- Blues... greens.
- Right.

594
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,168
Al, Sonora, I wanna show you
something. Come on!

595
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:18,803
Know what that is? Death.
Know what I just did? I defied it.

596
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,810
It's amazing, Clifford.

597
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,407
It's swell, isn't it?
My very own death-defying act.

598
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,171
I'm very proud of you, Clifford.

599
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,809
If you want something bad enough,
anything's possible.

600
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,723
- Seen my shoes?
- They're by the sofa. I'll get them.

601
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,402
- I'll do it.
- They're right here.

602
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,084
- Your lipstick's a little smeared.
- Thank you.

603
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,010
What?

604
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,524
- You got a problem with your socks.
- What's wrong?

605
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,611
One's red and one's green.
I like it though.

606
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,770
That's the latest fashion.

607
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,731
It's all right, it's all right.

608
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,164
It's gonna be rough for a while,
but I'll be here to help you.

609
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:37,571
It'll take time to adjust, if you want,
we can move the wedding back.

610
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,606
- There's not gonna be a wedding.
- What?

611
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,122
Don't marry me
because you feel sorry for me.

612
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,369
I'm marrying you because I love you.

613
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,404
I don't want that kind of love.

614
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,285
I don't want you cutting my food,

615
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,690
getting my socks,
cleaning up my messes.

616
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,123
- As soon as my eyes clear up...
- They won't.

617
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,041
- Yes, they will, it's temporary.
- It's not.

618
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,890
It is!

619
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,367
Let me go!

620
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,645
Sonora, you must accept this.
You're human with limitations.

621
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:21,405
You can't run away from it,
you can't hide from it or change it.

622
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,967
It's permanent.

623
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,328
I know.

624
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,605
I'm real sorry about what happened.

625
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,044
When Al told me you were hurt,
the movies had to wait.

626
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,882
- Marie, we're ready for you.
- Excuse me, honey.

627
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,884
- Here I am.
- Put her on the horse?

628
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,050
Have me stand next to it.

629
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,804
- That's great, great!
- Why did you decide to come back?

630
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,281
I love the audiences. When Al called
my mother, I was auditioning for a movie.

631
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,609
- How long will you be here?
- It's M-A-R-I-E.

632
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,124
Excuse me, sis, you're in the shot.
Could you move?

633
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:16,331
Sonora? What are you doing?

634
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,771
- I've been thinking.
- About what?

635
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,922
- I wanna dive again.
- Honey, you can't, it's impossible.

636
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,843
- I can do it, I know I can.
- Sonora, you've gotta be realistic.

637
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,247
With Lightning.

638
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,810
Al, he knows what I'm thinking,
and I know what he's thinking.

639
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:52,247
Absolutely not. It's too dangerous.

640
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,807
I have to do this.

641
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,010
Please, I need your help.

642
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,641
Here it comes.

643
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,326
Here it comes.

644
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,451
Here it comes again.

645
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,685
You OK?

646
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,170
Again.

647
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,281
Here, watch your step.

648
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,290
Again.

649
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,927
Are you nuts?
You have Marie to do the show.

650
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,966
This has nothing
to do with your show.

651
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,891
Do you think she can do this?

652
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,324
Look me in the eye
and tell me she can do this!

653
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,204
It's just what I thought.

654
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,966
Close out all other sounds
and listen to his hooves.

655
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,722
Don't go to the horse,
let the horse come to you.

656
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,045
Let your hand slide up his shoulder
to the harness.

657
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,925
When you feel the harness, grip.

658
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,730
Let the horse's momentum pull you up.

659
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,649
That's it!

660
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,208
Are you all right?

661
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,370
- This isn't working.
- Just a little more time.

662
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:21,646
No. I don't want you hurt.
We tried, it didn't work.

663
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,926
This can't be done, and it's going
to end right here. Understand?

664
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,645
Yes.

665
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,282
Hi. Are you OK?
I gotta introduce the show.

666
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,448
I'm OK.

667
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,243
Ladies and gentlemen,

668
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,331
we now present Carver's
high-diving horse and girl rider.

669
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,081
In a daring 40-foot plunge on horseback!

670
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,241
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- What's going on...? Clifford!

671
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:45,600
<i>Open up, Clifford!
Open up this door right now!</i>

672
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,770
It is the only act of its kind in the world.

673
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,842
<i>The safety of the rider depends on
the intelligence and skill of the horse.</i>

674
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:01,161
<i>It is an act with no electrical device,
no mechanical apparatus, no force,</i>

675
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,761
<i>and no cue of any sort...</i>

676
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,805
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
for safety, hold your applause...</i>

677
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:24,329
<i>I'm proud to present the most
popular act in Steel Pier's history...</i>

678
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:36,481
- Carver! What is going on here?
- I don't know. I'll find out.

679
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:40,810
- There's a girl climbing the tower!
- Oh, no. Sonora!

680
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,208
They don't want to see
a blind girl kill herself.

681
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,528
Sonora, don't!

682
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,643
Sonora, no!

683
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,765
- Carver!
- No, Sonora! No!

684
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,486
Did you see that?
She was wonderful!

685
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:17,446
<i>That last dive began 11 years of diving
blind. The audience never knew.</i>

686
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:22,567
<i>I'd found my destiny, not in faraway
places, but within myself.</i>

687
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,762
<i>I also found happiness with Al.</i>

688
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,760
<i>We were married that fall
and had a wonderful life together.</i>
