the fall like woods.

Now, let's go.

I had some milk.
I'm lactose intolerant--

What is that?

545

What, sir?
That!

I know, sir,
and I got it covered.

a question?

552

No, but you're gonna.

553
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,256
Is the agency
jealous of my style?

554
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,491
We are.

555
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,859
I'm serious! I mean,

556
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,226
why can't my clothes
fit my personality?

557
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:58,796
Bright, bold, colorful?
I'm a good agent.

558
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,498
I think it's time for
the agency to change, sir.

559
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,200
You're right.
Change into this.

560

your support, sir.

If you're not going
to protect him,

someone who will.

That's none of your
business, all right?

00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:49,313
And the kid asked
for some space.

683
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,182
Well, I suggest
you give him less space.

Don't tell me
how to do my job, ok?

685

And I won't tell you
how to teach

686
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,554
your little boring
science class.

687
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,257
Luke is in
a tough situation.

688
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,226
He's got a high profile,
he's in a new school,

I know how this kid
operates, you don't.

691
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,631
The last thing
he needs is support.

692

And what is it
he needs?

693
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,236
He just got it.

694
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,612

to learn how to box.

Why? That's what you're
supposed to be for.

696
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,184
Wrong. My job
is to protect you

697
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,653
from psychos,
wackos, kidnappers--

698
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:32,356
not 14-year-old boys wearing
blue blazers, all right?

699
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,324
But you know what?
That's unfortunate for you,

700
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,159
because as much trash
as you talk,

701
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,361
you need to learn how
to defend yourself.

702
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,229
I didn't ask you
for your advice,

703
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,597
so just take me home.

704
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:44,167
Know what?

705
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,236
All I got to do is
keep him out of trouble

to eagle. That's all.

...not counting the half
million we had in Bosnia.

708
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,613
Paul, hello.
I'm terribly sorry.

709
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:57,915
Ahem.
Oh.

710
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,150
Honey, uh...

711
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,152
You know the joint chiefs.

712
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:05,589
Hello, generals,
admirals.

713
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,958
Linda, I am in
the middle of a meeting

714
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,259
with the joint chiefs
of staff.

715

<i> Can't this wait?</i>

716
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:13,697
Yes, it can wait,

717
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:17,567
if you want to see it
on the news tonight.

718
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,969
He was in a fight, Paul.

719
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,604
<i> President:</i>
<i> Ah-ha. Um...</i>

720
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,940
Guys, could you give us
a few seconds?

721
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,575
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

722
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:30,647
I guess that nuclear treaty
can wait.

723
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,582
Hmm.

724
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,719
Sit down over there.

725
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,988
Sit.

726
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,124
All right,
what happened?

727
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,592
Well, that's what
I'd like to know.

728
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,594
We're looking
into it.

729
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,196
We may be making
some changes.

730
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:49,199
Well, now, let's
hold up on that.

731
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,202
I'm sure Simms would've
stopped it if he could have.

732
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,104
Now, how did
<i> this</i> incident begin?

733
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:56,340
Well, sir,
one of the boys--

734
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,742
Luke: It was just
something stupid.

735
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,979
Now, look, Luke,
your mother and I

736
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,014
are going to be out on
the campaign trail for a while,

737
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,366
and while we're gone,

738
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:06,717
I really need you to be
on your best behavior.

739
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,585
Now I hate to do this,

740
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,053
but while we're gone,
you're grounded.

741
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,755
How long are you
gonna be gone?

742
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,256
About a month.

743
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,726
What?! I have to stay
in the house

744
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:18,729
while you guys go
travel all over?

745
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,664
This sucks!
You guys have all the fun!

746
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,233
Watch your language.

747
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,337
<i> President: Linda?</i>

748
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,240
I think he just needs
some time to cool off.

749
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,747
Mmm.

750
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:39,416
Ahem.

751
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,019
Luke!

752
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,756
Brandy,
you seen Luke?

753
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,190
[Brandy whimpers]

754
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,692
I'm not in the mood
for games, Luke.

755
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:49,726
Where are you?

756
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,062
I heard about this.

757
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:54,398
They told me
this was closed off.

758
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,733
I can't believe this kid
got this thing open.

759
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,201
[Creaks]

760
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,192
[Luke crying]

761
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,600
Luke?

762
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,207
What is this place?

763
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,745
<i> Simms: You ok?</i>

764
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,717
What are you doing
down here?

765
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,788
What's the difference?
Nobody cares.

766
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,624
If you hadn't come, no one
would even known I was gone.

767
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,859
That's not true.

768
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:57,227
Now, your mother and
father would have.

769
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,361
Sooner or later
they would have known.

770
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,097
Trust me, it would
have been later.

771
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,632
I'm here. I care.

772
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:07,104
Yeah, so?
It's your job.

773
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,772
You don't even like it.

774
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,208
"I just gotta keep him
out of trouble

775

to eagle."

776
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,846
Did--did I get
that right?

777
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:17,881
I should've
never said that.

778
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,616
I was angry with you.

779
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,351
You make me look
stupid at my job.

780
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,619
You throw a snake on me,

781
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,688
you sneak out
the white house.

782
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,157
But I should never
have said it. I'm sorry.

783
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,693
Come on, Luke, you got
a pretty good life here.

784
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:30,861
You're the first kid.

785
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:31,828
Why would you
want to run away?

786
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,197
I can't go out.

787
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,234
I--I never see
my parents.

788
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:40,137
I don't have
any friends.

789
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,372
I've never
kissed a girl.

790
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,241
That would do it.
I understand.

791
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:45,775
That would make me
run away myself.

792
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,611
I'm sure you didn't
have to live like this

793
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,646
when you were a kid.

794
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,881
You were lucky.

795
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,216
Oh, I see.
You're the only one

796
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,784
that has some problems
in life.

797
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,219
Let me tell you
about myself.

798
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,889
When I was your age,
I lost my father in Vietnam.

799
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,390
My mother had
to work 2 or 3 jobs

800
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,691
just to take care of me,

801
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,160
so I was always
by myself.

802
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,662
You're the lucky one.
You got both your parents.

803
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,331
Yeah. I see them
every night on the news.

804
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,233
No. That's your Booty
you've been seeing

805
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,801
on the news.

806
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,437
Did you laugh?
Did--did I see a laugh?

807
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,438
There's hope, people.

808
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,407
There's hope
for this man. Ha!

809
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,442
See, it's not that bad.

810
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:22,245
Say we go upstairs,
go in the kitchen,

811
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,347
get something to eat
and talk like 2 men.

812
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,616
The kitchen's closed.

813
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,186
I'm double-o Simms.
I can get to any kitchen.

814
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,821
How come you had trouble with
those guys at your table today?

815
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,291
They only want to be friends
with me because of my dad.

816
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,193
How do you figure that?

817
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,928
'Cause everyone does.

818
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,964
So how do you know when
somebody likes you for you?

819
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,899
I guess I don't.

820
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,268
Simms?
Yeah?

821
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,204
You know that kid
that hit me today?

822
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,272
Yeah, vaguely
I remember that incident.

823
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,208
What took you so long
to get there?

824
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,444
Oh, man. You know, I usually
wear a size 36 underwear,

825
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,347
but somebody gave me
some 34s in the store,

826
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,249
so I had a little
wedgie thing going on,

827
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,252
so I'm standing
like this and...

828
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:05,388
I'm sorry, ok?
It'll never happen again.

829
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,857
I promise you that,
'cause I'm your partner--

830
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,626

The agency doesn't even
have this stuff yet.

I want you to know that.

I need you to check him out.

Ok, we're really
backed up down here.

884
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,154
Is this really
a priority?

885
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,957
No, man, but I really
need the help.

886
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,425
All right, I'll get
to it when I can.

No, no. Not that busy.

I guess I can't.

I'll see you Monday.

away is not the answer.

When I was 13, I didn't
want to hear that, either.

You know,
I'm gonna regret this.

I am. Simms, you're
gonna regret this.

promise 2 men can make.

You gotta get out

and protecting him.

recognizing me,

1393
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,746
and I'll go along
with the plan, ok?

1394
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:14,816
What?

1395
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,219
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1396
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,220

1397
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,856

Ow! Evan!

1398
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:22,057

Just great.

1401
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,830
I haven't been skating
since I was 12 years old.

1402
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,699
And back then
I had a pizza face.

1403
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:32,834
Now I got a big
giant pizza face.
