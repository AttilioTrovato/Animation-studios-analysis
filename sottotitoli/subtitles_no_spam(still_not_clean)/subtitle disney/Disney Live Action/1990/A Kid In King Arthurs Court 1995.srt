00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,998
<I>It's Round So You Gotta Look Everybody In The Eye.
No Favorites. Everybody's Equal.</I>

175
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:32,636
Everybody's Equal?
[Laughing] Fascinating Idea.

176
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:36,139
- Where Did You Say You Were From?
- Uh, Reseda.

177
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:39,009
Reseda.
What An Odd Name.

178
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,444
Hey, It's The Bowling
Capital Of The World.

179
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:44,179
May I Suggest For Our Honored
Visitor From Reseda...

180
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:46,482
A Fortnight Of Training
With Master Kane?

181
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:49,919
<I>Oh, A Splendid Idea, Daughter.
Tomorrow, My Master At Arms...</I>

182
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:52,488
Shall Instruct Thee In The Ways
Of The Knights Of Camelot.

183
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:55,057
Prepare His Quarters!
Come On!

184
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,028
[Belches, Slurps]

185
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:02,998
Welcome To
Camelot, Sir.

186
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:05,269
Thanks... I Think.

187
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,531
Okay, Where's The Bathroom?

188
00:15:58,553 --> 00:16:01,658
Lord Elastic!

189
00:15:58,553 --> 00:16:01,658
Belasco.

190
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:05,327
Right.

191
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,731
Listen.

192
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,731
[Whispering]
What?

193
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:11,234
I Don't Hear Anything.

194
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:11,234
Exactly!

195
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:17,173
I Could Choke The Life
Right Out Of You Right Now.

196
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,341
No One Would
Hear You Scream.

197
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,078
Hold That Thought.

198
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:34,390
[Creaking]

199
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:40,596
[Kiai]

200
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:50,240
Hyah!

201
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,509
Oh! Excuse Me, Good Sir.
Pardon My Intrusion.

202
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:57,580
My Father Asked That I Make Sure Thou
Art Comfortable In Thy New Quarters.

203
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:01,785
You Want Me Comfortable, How About Getting
Me A Road Map Out Of The Middle Ages?

204
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:05,087
If I Don't Get Home,
I'm Grounded.

205
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,057
You Resedians Wear
Very Strange Garments.

206
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,459
Oh! Excuse Me.

207
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,769
Okay.

208
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:23,807
<I>Wait. Your Father
Sent You Here?</I>

209
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,208
[Murmuring]

210
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:31,548
I Cannot Lie To Thee, Sir. My Father Knows
Nothing Of My Nocturnal Transgression.

211
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,084
Do Me A Favor.
Call Me "Calvin."

212
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,685
Calvin.

213
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:41,557
That Dance.
What Was It?

214
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,793
<I>Dance?</I>

215
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,793
You Know.

216
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:50,467
Oh. That's Not A Dance.
That's Karate.

217
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,471
You See, There Was This Big Kid Who Was Beating
Me Up Every Day And Stealing My Lunch Money,

218
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:59,209
So My Dad Signed Me Up
For Karate School.

219
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:01,677
I Really Miss Them.

220
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,547
My Sister Too.

221
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:08,750
You Have No Idea What I'm Talking About,
Do You?

222
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:13,656
I Fear I Know Nothing Of
Karate Or Lunch Money,

223
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:16,726
But I Do Know What It Is Like To Miss One's Parents.

224
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,530
My Father Has Never Been
The Same Since Mother Died.

225
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:24,800
I Miss My Mother Deeply.

226
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:28,571
I Miss My Father Even More.

227
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:35,911
I Really Need To Get Home, Katey.
Can You Help Me?

228
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:38,280
I Truly Cannot.

229
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,786
Perhaps There Is
Somebody Who Can!

230
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,522
- Who?
- Merlin.

231
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,526
- But You Said He Was Dead.
- Not Quite.

232
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:53,462
<I>[Rock Moving]</I>

233
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:02,873
<I>Cool.
A Secret Door.</I>

234
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:02,873
Come.

235
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,442
[Rumbling]

236
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,250
This Way.

237
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:18,353
<I>[Wind Whistling]</I>

238
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:20,789
We've Lost The Light!

239
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,160
[Chuckles]
No Problem.

240
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,428
It's Incredible!

241
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,701
<I>[Cal] Just Like The Temple Of Doom.</I>

242
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,707
This Is It.

243
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,707
<I>[Stones Creaking]</I>

244
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:50,787
These Were Once Merlin's Quarters.
'Tis Now My Father's Private Sanctuary.

245
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:03,599
<I>[Cal] Is That-- Aw, It Can't Be.</I>

246
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:07,237
Oh, That. That's Just
Father's Old Sword.

247
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:10,740
"Old Sword"?
That's Excalibur.

248
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:16,379
My, Thou Dost
Know A Lot.

249
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:16,379
I Watch A Lot Of Cnn.

250
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:19,950
No One's Touched It
In Years.

251
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,287
'Tis True.

252
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,992
Wow, You Even Have
A Hot Tub.

253
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,992
'Tis The Well Of Destiny.

254
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:32,894
Oh.

255
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:32,894
That Is All That
Remains Of Merlin.

256
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:36,733
If There Is A Way Home,
It Will Be In There.

257
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,567
Sweet.

258
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,740
Quick.
Someone Comes. Hurry!

259
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:00,390
Here Is Where
We Must Part.

260
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,830
There's Something Very Special About You,
Calvin Of Reseda.

261
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,800
Perhaps Your Arrival Here
Was No Accident.

262
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:19,641
Hey, How Do I Get Back?

263
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:19,641
Follow The Wall.
It Stops At Your Quarters.

264
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:21,478
Good Night, Sir.

265
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:53,742
<I>Ah, The Knight I Sent For.</I>

266
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:58,114
<I>Come To The Well So That I May
Gaze Upon The Face Of Greatness.</I>

267
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:01,083
Who Said That?

268
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:01,083
<I>Come.
Come.</I>

269
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:03,686
<I>We Haven't Much Time.</I>

270
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:03,686
Is Someone Down There?

271
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:11,827
What Are You Doing Here, Boy?
Stand Aside So I May See My Great Warrior.

272
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:15,064
<I>Where Is He? Come, Come.
Step Forward.</I>

273
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:19,769
Um, I Hate To Tell You This,
But I'm The Only One Here.

274
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,605
- You Must Be Joking.
- No.

275
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:26,541
You're Merlin, Right?

276
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:30,546
Something Has Gone Horribly Wrong.
What Was That Wretched Spell I Cast?

277
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:34,951
Half A Quart Of Pig Vomit
And The Two Monkey Bladders?

278
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:38,754
- Pig Vomit?
- Or Was It The Other Way Around?

279
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:42,024
Good Lord!

280
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:42,024
<I>Oh, I Get It.</I>

281
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:46,128
This Is All A Big Mistake. That's Okay.
Everybody Picks Me Last.

282
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:50,799
No, I Couldn't Have Got It Wrong.
But Look At You!

283
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:56,072
<I>What Manner Of Armor Is That?
And That Animal Sleeping On Your Head.</I>

284
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:58,941
Animal?
It's My Hair!

285
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:01,810
Look, Your Wetness,
I Don't Understand Any Of This.

286
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:05,615
- And What Am I Doing Here?
- I Brought You Here...

287
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:08,116
To Save Camelot.

288
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,454
<I>- Me? - Arthur Is In Trouble.
His Kingdom Has Been Shattered...</I>

289
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,523
By The Iron Fist
Of Lord Belasco.

290
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:16,125
Oh, The Dork In The Purple Dress.
We've Met.

291
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:20,163
And You Haven't Seen The Last Of Him.
He Is A Dangerous Man.

292
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:23,465
<I>He Means To Steal Camelot
From Arthur. And You...</I>

293
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:28,871
Are Going To Stop Him.

294
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:32,442
Look, You Definitely
Have The Wrong Guy.

295
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:35,076
Why Don't You Just Send Me Home?
I Mean, My Family Really Needs Me.

296
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:38,013
Camelot Needs You!

297
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:40,682
[Groaning]

298
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:44,085
Help Arthur
Find His Way Back,

299
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,855
And I Will Help You
Find Yours.

300
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:52,194
[Sighs]

301
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:55,498
[Battle Cry,
Shield Clanging]

302
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:18,954
Nicely Done.

303
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:18,954
Thank You.

304
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:21,958
Now, Would You Care To Show
Us How It Is Done In Reseda?

305
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,595
Uh, Actually I Was
Hoping For A Desk Job.

306
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:28,798
<I>As From Today,
You're A Knight In Training.</I>

307
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,067
Thanks, But I Won't
Be Here That Long.

308
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,067
<I>Don't Tell Me...</I>

309
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:36,072
A Brave Lad Like You,
Who Faced The Full Fury Of The Black Knight,

310
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:38,207
Is Afraid Of A Dummy.

311
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,609
Uh, No Way.
I Was Just Testing You.

312
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:45,081
[Clangs]

313
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:48,017
God, These Things Are A Lot
Heavier Than They Look On Tv.

314
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:52,821
"Tv"? One Of Your Knights Of Reseda,
No Doubt?

315
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:54,656
Uh, Something Like That.

316
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:01,630
Good Fit.
Can You See?

317
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:01,630
Perfectly.

318
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:06,635
Oh, It Smells Like
Something Died In Here.

319
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,508
Excuse Me.
[Grunting]

320
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:17,012
<I>- [Kane] This Way.
- [Cal] Yeah, I Knew That.</I>

321
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:22,117
There. Whoa!

322
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,153
Calvin?

323
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,153
Yeah?

324
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:31,826
Remember Three Things:

325
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,096
Lean In.
Protect Your Steed.

326
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:37,766
Fix A Point On Your Opponent's
Person And Have At Him.

327
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,036
That's Four Things.

328
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,036
What?

329
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:42,038
Never Mind.

330
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:46,576
Hit It.

331
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:53,649
Ah!

332
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,184
<I>[Splashing]</I>

333
00:25:56,218 --> 00:26:00,089
<I>Well, I'd Like To See
You Try That.</I>

334
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:11,600
I Thought All Knights Spent Their Time
Rescuing Damsels And Fighting Dragons.

335
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:13,803
What Are They All
Doing Here?

336
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:17,105
They're All Training Hard
For The Big Tournament.

337
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:20,609
You See,
The Prize Is Quite Appealing To All Men Of Royal Blood.

338
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:22,612
Really?
What's The Prize?

339
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:26,915
My Sister.
And Camelot.

340
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:29,250
What About Her?
Doesn't She Have A Choice?

341
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:32,221
She Has Refused All Suitors.

342
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:35,023
Therefore,
On Her 21st Birthday,

343
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:37,360
The Tournament
Must Decide For Her.

344
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:41,831
Bummer.

345
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:41,831
I Think I Agree.

346
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,766
Come. You Try.

347
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,284
<I>[Cat Screeching]</I>

348
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:34,382
You Are The Most Exquisite
Flower In This Garden, Princess.

349
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:38,253
There Is One Major Difference Between The
Garden Flowers And Myself, Lord Belasco.

350
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:41,289
Mmm?

351
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:41,289
A Rose Will Prick You,

352
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:43,426
But I Will Do Far Worse.

353
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:46,295
You Cut Me To The Quick.

354
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:51,133
All I Want Is What Is Best
For My King And His Kingdom.

355
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:55,171
Camelot Could Be Great.
We Could Make It Great Again.

356
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:58,039
"We"?

357
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:58,039
Yes, Of Course.

358
00:27:58,073 --> 00:28:01,811
The Two Of Us Together,
In Wedded Bliss.

359
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:04,681
I Will Marry The Man
Who Wins The Tournament.

360
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:08,150
Enter It...

361
00:28:08,182 --> 00:28:10,920
If You Have The Nerve.

362
00:28:10,952 --> 00:28:12,788
Good Day, Sir.

363
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,734
So, Master Kane,
Where's Your Castle?

364
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:27,503
Oh, I Have No Land
Of My Own.

365
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:29,505
Does That Mean You Can't Enter The Tournament?

366
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:33,241
Alas, The Tournament Is Reserved
For Far Better Men Than I.

367
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:35,377
No Way.
You're The Best.

368
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,247
If Thou Art Trying
To Get On My Good Side,

369
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,983
Thou Has Succeeded
With Royal Colors.

370
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:45,788
<I>Ah. Here Is Thy Opponent.</I>

371
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,856
Wait!
I Can't Fight The Princess.

372
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,059
You Are Right
About That, Sir.

373
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:53,796
Come.
I Wonder.

374
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:55,998
Do The Knights
Of Reseda Swim?

375
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,336
You Have Much To Learn
Before Supper.

376
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:04,906
I Hear The Kitchen Is Serving A Poached
Goat's Head In A Brown Grub Sauce.

377
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,443
Oh!

378
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,443
Or Perhaps We Could
Catch Yon Goose.

379
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:12,214
[Grunting]

380
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:12,214
Oh. Whoa!

381
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,786
<I>[Laughing]</I>

382
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,786
Oh, Geez.

383
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:21,056
I Cannot Believe I Fell For The Oldest Trick In The Book.

384
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,858
<I>Then Again,
Since I'm Here,</I>

385
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:27,363
<I>Maybe It's The Newest
Trick In The Book.</I>

386
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:43,546
Hey. How's It Goin'?

387
00:29:43,578 --> 00:29:48,017
Ah, Good Sir. My Shop
Is At Your Service.

388
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:52,187
Really? Well, Thanks. Uh,
I Hear You Can Make Anything.

389
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:54,155
Indeed, I Have
That Reputation.

390
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:56,459
What About This?

391
00:29:58,326 --> 00:30:00,962
By The Circle Builders
Themselves.

392
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:06,434
Well, I Need Another Pair, Like, Yesterday.

393
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,338
Ah.

394
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:20,449
- Who's There?
- I Trust You Slept Well?

395
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:25,488
<I>Yeah. We All Did-- Me And The Forest
Of Crawling Things Living In My Bed.</I>

396
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:33,461
<I>All Right.</I>

397
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:37,165
Come. Breakfast Is Served In The Great Hall.
We Must Hurry Or We'll Be Late.

398
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,969
Just A Minute.
I Have Somethin' To Show Ya.

399
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:50,111
What Is It For?

400
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,650
[Princess Gasping,
Both Laughing]

401
00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:56,451
Come On.
This Way.

402
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,591
Oh, Careful.

403
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,591
Come On.

404
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:10,499
So If It's "Bad,"
It's Good.

405
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:10,499
Right.

406
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:13,368
And If It's "Cool,"
It's Hot.

407
00:31:13,402 --> 00:31:17,340
Oh, I Fear I Will Never
Understand Your Valley Speak.

408
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:27,383
Well, Belasco. What Dost Thou
Wish To Speak About?

409
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:30,586
<I>Decisions, Your Highness.
It's Time You Made One.</I>

410
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:33,121
What Didst Thou
Have In Mind?

411
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:36,090
I've Been Loyal To You
For Years, Your Highness,

412
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:38,461
And All I Ask For In Return
Is Sarah's Hand In Marriage.

413
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:42,564
Thou Knowest
The Laws Of Camelot.

414
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:45,200
The Tournament
Shall Decide For Her.

415
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:50,172
The Fate Of Camelot Cannot Rest
Upon The Folly Of A Tournament.

416
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:53,074
Can It, Your Highness?

417
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:03,552
I-- I Shall Speak To My Daughter On Thy Behalf.

418
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:06,721
- I Thank Thee, Your Highness.
- Watch Out!

419
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:10,225
[Belasco
Gasping]

420
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:13,461
Hey, The Round Table.
History Books Are Gonna Love Ya.

421
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,299
<I>Not Staying For Breakfast,
Lord Belasco?</I>

422
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:19,335
I Do Not Eat With Children!

423
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,340
Well, Sit, Sit
Before It Gets Cold.

424
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:26,709
So What's
For Breakfast?

425
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:28,476
Leftovers!

426
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:31,613
Mmm.

427
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:37,252
Guard It
With Your Life.

428
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:40,623
Go For It.

429
00:32:53,335 --> 00:32:56,171
<I>For What Do We Owe This Unexpected Pleasure,
Lord Belasco?</I>

430
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:58,507
Out Of My Way, Teacher.

431
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:03,612
Well, If You've Had Enough
Of Fighting Wooden Men,

432
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:07,215
How Do You Fancy Taking On
A Real Man For A Change?

433
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:10,486
But, Sir--

434
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:10,486
This Has Nothing To Do
With You, Teacher.

435
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,056
Boy, You Guys Are Really Hung Up On This
Dominant Male Monkey Thing, Aren't You?

436
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:17,092
- I Take It Your Answer's No.
- Calvin!

00:33:30,137 --> 00:33:34,609
[Groaning]

438
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:38,547
I Could Be Wrong,
But I Think I Just Qualified For A Black Belt.

439
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:45,486
You'd Better Use It
To Hang Yourself With,

440
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,157
Because When I Come For You,
It'll Be Worse.

441
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,693
Far, Far Worse.

442
00:33:55,696 --> 00:33:58,433
[Groaning]

443
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:02,271
As A Reward,
Thou Hast Earned A Grand Supper.

444
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:04,640
On One Condition.

445
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:04,640
What Is That?

446
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:07,076
I Do The Cooking.

447
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:07,076
Oh.

448
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:11,246
Mmm, Smells Divine.
What Is It?

449
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:11,246
<I>A Surprise, Princess.</I>

450
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,521
- Oh, No! Those Are Poisonous Love Apples.
- Trust Me.

451

<I>And No Peeking.</I>

452
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,496
It Smells So Wonderful
I Can Hardly Wait.

453
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,568
Patience.

454
00:34:36,304 --> 00:34:38,106
Okay. You Can Look Now.

00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:46,514
'Tis Beautiful,
But What Is It?

456
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:50,118
It's A Meal Fit
For The Round Table:

457
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:52,588
Double Cheeseburger,
Lettuce And Tomato On A Whole Wheat Bun.

458
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,724
- What?
- Big Mac.

459
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:03,699
Mmm. It's Good!

460
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:07,168

For Me, Father?

00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:23,318
I Did? Oh, Yes, Yes, Yes.
Of Course I Did.

Best For My Kingdom.

I Mean, A Game To Settle
The Fate Of Camelot?

466
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:37,932
I Fear The Tournament
Is An Outdated Notion.

467
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:41,136
Thou Art Dancing, Father.
Get To The Point.

468
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:46,675
I Have Decided That Thou Shalt Marry Lord Belasco.

469
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:54,449
If I Cannot
Marry For Love,

470
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,286
Then The Law Of The Land
Will Prevail.

471
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,256
I Shall Let
The Tournament Decide.

472
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:08,797
Thou Art As Stubborn
As Thy Mother.

As I Thought.

Thou Was Not To See That.
Swear Your Silence To Me Now, Sir, Or Risk My Wrath.

Of My Business--

Can We Put This Off

Look What You've Done.
How Could You?

- But, Princess, It Was You Who Asked--
- How Dare You Contradict Me?

503
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:58,974
This Is Your Fault!

You Are A Clever Lad.

I Need Somethin' Bigger.

It's Gotta Be Light As A Feather
But Hard As Belasco's Head.

518
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,052
I Know Of
No Such Metal.

519
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:49,123
You Will.
Melt This And That Together,

520
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:52,094
Stir...
And Then Stand Back.

521
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:54,462
How Does A Boy
Know So Much?

522
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:57,432
Metal Shop,
Eighth Grade.

523
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,604
See, You Start
With The Frame.

524
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:08,042
<I>What Is It,
Sister?</I>

525
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:12,847
Distress.
Burning Of The Heart.

526
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,982
No, 'Tis Not
Heartburn.

527
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:17,818
'Tis Heartache.

528
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:20,688
You Are In Love,
Little One.

529
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:20,688
Don't Be Silly!

530
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,594
Can't Hide Anything
From You, Can I?

531
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:28,797
I Know It All
Too Well Myself.

532
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:33,601
Does It Always
Hurt This Much?

533
00:39:33,635 --> 00:39:37,606
Oh, Sometimes
It Hurts Much Worse.

534
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:44,445
Poor Father.

535
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:47,081
Every Day He Drifts
Further Away From Us.

536
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,987
What Is To Become
Of Our Family, Sarah?

537
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:54,655
I Know Not,

538
00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:57,091
But I Will Always
Look After Thee.

539
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,567
Farewell, My Beauties.

540
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,436
What Are Thou
Eating, Lad?

541
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,436
Oh, Mad Dog Bubble Gum.

542
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:10,504
What?

543
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:12,507
Here.

544
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:18,747
No! You're Not
Supposed To Swallow.

545
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,949
You're Not?

546
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,949
[Sighs]

547
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:24,686
Here. Just Put It
In Your Mouth And Chew.

548
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:24,686
Chew.

549
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:29,624
Never Swallow.

550
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:29,624
Never Swallow.

551
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:32,661
Then What Is
Its Purpose?

552
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:37,432
There Is No Purpose.

553
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:37,432
No Purpose?
Strange.

554
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,236
Why Do They Call It
"Mad Dog Bubble Gum"?

555
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:45,840
I Have No Idea,
Your Highness.

556
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:50,846
[Muffled]
Mmm. Lord Belasco.

557
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:53,114
Uh-- Mmm.
Take A Seat.

558
00:40:56,784 --> 00:41:01,021
Get Out.

559
00:40:56,784 --> 00:41:01,021
Affairs Of The Court, Lad.
You Understand.

560
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:03,558
It's Okay.
I Have A Date.

561
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,728
- "Date"?
- I'll Explain Later.

562
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:17,139
Have You Spoken
To Your Daughter?

563
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:17,139
Yes, Of Course, Of Course.

564
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:21,141
And?

565
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:23,644
Well, I Cannot Force Her
To Marry Thee.

566
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:29,116
But If She Means That Much To You,
I Mean,

567
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,985
There's Always
The Tournament.

568
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:52,840
She Will Be Mine.
No One Will Have Her.

569
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:55,243
Ah, So You Are Planning
To Enter The Tournament.

570
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,746
Are You
A Complete Idiot?

571
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,182
Do You Think
I Want To Die?

572
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:03,218
There's Another Way.

573
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:09,757
[Door Closing]

574
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:21,969
I Came Only Because My Music Lessons Were Cancelled.

575
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:25,307
You're Still
Impertinent.

576
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:25,307
I'll Take That As A Compliment.

577
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,644
State Your Business
And I Shall Be On My Way.

578
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,644
I Have A Surprise For You.

579
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,221
What Is It?

580
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,221
It's A Mountain Bike.

581
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:44,291
What Is It For?

582
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:44,291
In Reseda,
We Have A Custom.

583
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:46,561
It's Called A Picnic.

584
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:50,998
Hop On.
Watch Your Step.

585
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,338
Here We Go.

586
00:42:59,273 --> 00:43:01,242
Look At That.

587
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:10,384
Oh!

588
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:12,653
It's Not So Bad,
Is It?

589
00:43:12,686 --> 00:43:14,655
'Tis So Fast.

590
00:43:21,128 --> 00:43:24,231
You Know The Night You Took Me
To See Merlin's Book Of Spells?

591
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:26,967
Mm-Hmm.

592
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:26,967
Well, I Went Back,

593
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:31,239
And I Don't Know If I'm Goin' Crazy Or What,
But I Saw Merlin In The Well.

594
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:36,710
He Came To You?

595
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:36,710
Yeah, He Said That He
Brought Me Here To Save Camelot.

596
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:39,847
<I>Well, Actually,
He Didn't Bring Me Here.</I>

597
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,317
He-- He Meant
To Bring Someone Else.

598
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,317
He Chose Well.

599
00:43:45,152 --> 00:43:48,022
What Are The Girls Like
In Reseda?

600
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:50,991
I Don't Know.

601
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:53,028
Course You Do.

602
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:57,865
Well, They're
Nothing Like You.

603
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:03,872
<I>[Horse Nickering]</I>

604
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:09,677
<I>[Townspeople Chattering]</I>

605
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:16,284
<I>[Man] Now What Do You Make Of That?</I>

606
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:20,054
<I>[People Chattering]</I>

607
00:44:26,728 --> 00:44:30,097
<I>[Man] Hurry,
Before Belasco's Men Come!</I>

608
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,366
<I>[Cal] Boy,
They Sure Are Hungry.</I>

609
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,369
<I>[Woman] Better Save The Rest.
'Tis Lord Belasco I Fear.</I>

610
00:44:35,402 --> 00:44:38,439
Where Did It All
Come From?

611
00:44:35,402 --> 00:44:38,439
<I>[Man] Our Only Friend--</I>

612
00:44:38,472 --> 00:44:42,777
<I>- [Whinnying]
- [Child] God Bless The Black Knight!</I>

613
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:48,048
The Black Knight
Is One Of The Good Guys?

614
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:50,085
It Cannot Be True.

615
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,195
Are You Okay?

616
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:05,199
Confused.

617
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:05,199
About The Black Knight?

618
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:07,202
And Other Things.

619
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,746
I Shall Never Forget
This Moment.

620
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,317
Hey, Where You Going?

621
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:24,251
[Sighs]

622
00:45:28,422 --> 00:45:30,425
I'll Walk You
To Your Room.

623
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:34,762
Old Reseda Custom.

624
00:45:34,795 --> 00:45:38,365
The More I Hear Of Reseda,
The More I Want To See It.

625
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,402
I Wish I Could
Take You There.

626
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:45,874
Good Night.

627
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:57,384
Princess,

628
00:45:57,418 --> 00:46:00,288
I Haven't Had This Much Fun
In My Whole Life.

629
00:46:01,922 --> 00:46:04,224
I Know You're Worried
About Your Father.

630
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:07,127
<I>[Cal Continues]
Me Too.</I>

631
00:46:07,161 --> 00:46:11,331
<I>I Promise I'll Do Everything I Can To
Keep Belasco From Screwing Things Up.</I>

632
00:46:11,364 --> 00:46:13,467
I Guess That's All.

633
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:19,206
Oh, Yeah.
You're A Great Kisser.

634
00:46:23,577 --> 00:46:26,313
Wise Girl.
Come On!

635
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,953
One Sound And It
Would Have Been Your Last.

636
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:37,090
[Rumbling]

637
00:46:37,123 --> 00:46:39,960
Get In There!

638
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,166
Come With Me!

639
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,166
[Katey
Screaming]

640
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,407
[Katey]
Help Me!

641
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:58,413
Hah!

642
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:58,413
<I>[Whip Cracking]</I>

643
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:08,956
What Sorcery Is This, Merlin, That I'm No
Longer Able To Brandish The Sword Excalibur?

644
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:12,226
<I>I Thought With Thee,
I Would Reign Forever.</I>

645
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:16,064
<I>I Was Wrong.</I>

646
00:47:17,097 --> 00:47:19,067
Camelot Rots,

647
00:47:21,202 --> 00:47:23,972
And I Play At Being King.

648
00:47:25,206 --> 00:47:27,442
<I>I Want Her
Great Again.</I>

649
00:47:30,344 --> 00:47:33,114
But I Fear I'm Too Weak
To Bring Her Back.

650
00:47:35,115 --> 00:47:37,117
Oh, Guinevere.

651
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:41,122
My Guinevere.

652
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:48,630
<I>I'm Too Old.
I'm Too Tired.</I>

653
00:48:16,724 --> 00:48:19,193
<I>Go Ahead.
Take It.</I>

654
00:48:19,226 --> 00:48:21,528
<I>I Want You
To Have It.</I>

655
00:48:24,398 --> 00:48:26,968
We Need To Talk.

656
00:48:24,398 --> 00:48:26,968
<I>Oh.</I>

657
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:30,204
You're Not Trying To Dodge Your
Way Out Of Our Deal, Are You?

658
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:32,373
Oh, No, No,
Nothin' Like That.

659
00:48:32,405 --> 00:48:35,143
- Hmm?
- I'm Just Not So Sure I Wanna Go Home Yet.

660
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:37,511
Ohh.

661
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:40,916
Of Course.
The Princess Katherine.

662
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:44,952
Yeah. She's Incredible.

663
00:48:44,985 --> 00:48:50,090
True, But You Won't Have Much Of
A Honeymoon In Belasco's Dungeon.

664
00:48:50,123 --> 00:48:53,360
- Good Point.
- I Suggest You Take Excalibur.

665
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:58,298
<I>- What About Arthur?
- You Must Lead The Way.</I>

666
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:00,567
Now.

667
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:03,304
Wait!

668
00:49:03,336 --> 00:49:06,474
- Was There Something Else?
- Aren't You Gonna Wish Me Luck?

669
00:49:06,507 --> 00:49:09,210
Very Well.
Good Luck.

670
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,684
Are You Going To Need It.

671
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:25,092
<I>Ah! Princess.
So Good Of You To Come On Such Short Notice.</I>

672
00:49:25,126 --> 00:49:29,097
Your Servant Said I Would Be Supremely
Interested In What You Have To Say.

673
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,201
Well, He Did Not
Exaggerate.

674
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,201
Then Say It
And I Shall Be On My Way.

675
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:37,371
How Dare You!
When My Father Hears How You're Treating Me--

676
00:49:37,405 --> 00:49:41,576
Look, I Didn't Bring You Here To Listen
To Your Incessant Royal Prattle!

677
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:45,746
Now Shut Your Mouth And Your
Sister Will Remain Unharmed.

678
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,682
What Have You Done
With My Sister?

679
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,682
She's Safe.

680
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:52,320
For Now.

681
00:49:52,353 --> 00:49:55,088
But I'm Getting Tired Of Waiting
For You To Accept My Offer.

682
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:58,091
You Are Mad.

683
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,427
You Cannot Force Me
To Marry You.

684
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:06,233
Well, If You Do Not Consent,
Then Princess Katherine Will Die.

685
00:50:08,402 --> 00:50:12,173
This Pact Is Between You And Me.
You Utter One Word Of This To Anyone...

686
00:50:12,206 --> 00:50:14,509
And You'll Never See
Your Sister Again.

687
00:50:17,344 --> 00:50:19,646
I Await Your Answer.

688
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,315
You Have Until
The Tournament.

689
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:24,786
Sweet Dreams.
Night-Night.

690
00:50:37,797 --> 00:50:40,600
Huh?

691
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:43,505
- What Do You Want?
- You're Under Arrest...

692
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:48,743
For The Murder
Of Princess Katherine.

693
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:51,411
Seize Him.

694
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:53,381
[Yells]

695
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:53,381
[Grunts]

696
00:50:57,585 --> 00:51:01,255
Find Him
And Then Kill Him.

697
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:16,137
Calvin, I Must
Speak To You Of Katey.

698
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,773
I Didn't Do It. All We Did Was Go On A Picnic.
I Swear. I Didn't Kill Her.

699
00:51:19,806 --> 00:51:23,276
She's Been Kidnapped Under Belasco's Orders.
I Need Your Help.

700
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:26,179
My Help?

701
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:26,179
You Must Bring Her Back.

702
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:27,816
<I>Ahem. All Right,
This Way.</I>

703
00:51:32,853 --> 00:51:37,692
They're Looking For Me.
Belasco Tried To Arrest Me.

704
00:51:32,853 --> 00:51:37,692
Then You Only Have One Chance.

705
00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:41,596
Just One, Huh?

706
00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:41,596
My Father--

707
00:51:41,628 --> 00:51:44,298
Give Him This.
He Will Know You Speak The Truth.

708
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:50,505
<I>- Guards. He Went This Way.
- Come With Me.</I>

709
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:55,742
Calvin.
Calvin, Come.

710
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:55,742
Huh?

711
00:51:58,778 --> 00:52:01,215
[Panting]

712
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:03,251
[Snores]

713
00:52:07,387 --> 00:52:09,623
<I>[Crashing]</I>

714
00:52:09,657 --> 00:52:13,894
<I>By Merlin's Prophecies,
Dost Thou Come At Me In My Sleep?</I>

715
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:18,231
<I>[Grunts] Thou Shalt Not Take Me That Easily.</I>

716
00:52:18,264 --> 00:52:20,835
Come Into The Light,
You Cowards!

717
00:52:22,302 --> 00:52:24,271
Calvin, Which Way
Did They Flee?

718
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:26,640
How Many Were There?
Five? Ten?

719
00:52:26,673 --> 00:52:31,646
Oh, The Royal Blood Is Pumping Now.
Leave Us Ride After The Interlopers.

720
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:36,617
Sire, Stop! There Are No
Interlopers Or Outer-Lopers.

721
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:36,617
Don't Be Ridiculous, Boy.

722
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,421
Get Me My Royal Wardrobe.
The Hunt Is On.

723
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:43,791
Katey Has Been Kidnapped.

724
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:43,791
Kidnapped?

725
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:45,927
My Baby Is Sleeping
With The Goats?

726
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,329
She's Been
Taken Prisoner.

727
00:52:48,362 --> 00:52:51,264
That's Impossible.

728
00:52:48,362 --> 00:52:51,264
Belasco's Orders.

729
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:55,535
But I Would Trust Belasco
With My Life.

730
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:55,535
Bad Idea, Sire.

731
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:59,306
You've Been Faked Out, Played For A Sucker.
Your Chain Has Been Royally Pulled.

732
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,976
All Right, Boy,
I Get The Point.

733
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:05,213
Belasco Plans On Stealing
Camelot Just Like He Stole Katey.

734
00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:08,182
I Cannot Believe It.

735
00:53:14,922 --> 00:53:18,193
So, It's All True.

736
00:53:14,922 --> 00:53:18,193
<I>[Knocking]</I>

737
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:24,632
Yes? Who Is It?

738
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:24,632
<I>Lord Belasco, Your Highness.</I>

739
00:53:34,742 --> 00:53:39,313
Oh, Lord Belasco.
Why Art Thou Disturbing My Sleep?

740
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:42,416
I'm Sorry,
Your Highness.

741
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:46,487
I Have Some Terrible News.
Princess Katherine Is Dead.

742
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:52,227
Dead? Katey?

743
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:56,431
My Poor,
Poor Katey Dead!

744
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,302
Who Has Done This?

745
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:06,039
Calvin Of Reseda,
Your Highness.

746
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:06,039
Calvin Of Reseda!

747
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:10,478
<I>After I Fed Him And Clothed Him,
This Is The Thanks I Get!</I>

748
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:15,483
Why Art Thou Wasting My Time?
Find The Boy. Bring Me His Head On A Pike.

749
00:54:15,516 --> 00:54:18,586
Your Wish Is
My Command, Sire.

750
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:20,655
He'll Be Dead By Daybreak,
Your Highness.

751
00:54:26,693 --> 00:54:30,364
Calvin? Calvin?

752
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:35,036
Ah. My Artifice Was
Well Nigh Rewarded, Lad.

753
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:37,505
He Bought It?

754
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:37,505
He Bought It.

755
00:54:37,538 --> 00:54:40,641
You Know Where They
Might've Taken Her?

756
00:54:40,673 --> 00:54:42,677
I Do Indeed, Lad.

757
00:54:47,947 --> 00:54:49,683
[Driver] Hyah!
Come On! [Cracks Whip]

758
00:54:53,052 --> 00:54:55,522
What Are You Going
To Do With Me?

759
00:54:53,052 --> 00:54:55,522
Nothing...

760
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:59,059
If Your Sister Gives Herself
To Lord Belasco In Betrothal.

761
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:01,461
In You Go.

762
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:01,461
And If She Doesn't?

763
00:55:01,494 --> 00:55:03,498
Hmm.

764
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:10,804
<I>[Cal] Anyway,
We're Gonna Have To Go In Disguise.</I>

765
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:12,973
Disguise?

766
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:12,973
Yeah, I Figure
If We Look Like...

767
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:15,809
Miserable, Starving,
Pathetic Peasants, No One Will Notice.

768
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:19,413
Peasants? Hmph!
Don't Be Ridiculous, Boy.

769
00:55:19,445 --> 00:55:23,416
The Royal Pendragon Strikes Fear
Into The Hearts Of My Enemies.

770
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:25,419
Not Anymore It Doesn't.

771
00:55:32,425 --> 00:55:33,994
What Do You Know, Boy?

772
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:36,963
They Hate You.

773
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:41,435
Hate Me?

774
00:55:43,003 --> 00:55:46,574
Belasco's Been Stealing
From Your People For Years.

775
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:49,943
There's Nothing But Sickness
And Starvation In Camelot, And...

776
00:55:49,976 --> 00:55:52,480
They Think You Don't
Care About Them.

777
00:55:57,918 --> 00:55:59,686
They Hate Me.

778
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:04,425
You Do Care,
Don't You?

779
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:07,461
Of Course I Do, Lad.

780
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:10,698
Come. I Know
A Way Out.

781
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:14,869
[Arthur, Cal
Yelling]

782
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:19,539
<I>[Pigs Grunting,
Squealing]</I>

783
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:24,545
[Hiccups, Burps]

784
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:24,545
Yuck!
More Boar Snouts?

785
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:29,550
<I>[Cal] Come On.
This Is Where We Get Off. Jump.</I>

786
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:37,992
Oh! [Chuckling] I Rather Like This:
Out Among My Own People.

787
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:45,800
Watch Whom You Bathe,
O Washerwoman.

788
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:50,738
Washerwoman, Eh? And Who Do You Think You Are?
The Bloody King Of England?

789
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:54,208
<I>As A Matter Of Fact,
I Am Your King.</I>

790
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,811
<I>And I'm
Cleo-Bleedin'-Patra.</I>

791
00:56:56,844 --> 00:57:00,514
Come On. Let's Go.

792
00:56:56,844 --> 00:57:00,514
If Thou Were A Man,
I Would Call Thee Out!

793
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:02,916
If You Were A Man,
I'd Throw More Than A Bath Over Ya.

794
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:05,185
Let's Go.

795
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:05,185
Stop!

796
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:09,023
Look, Your Majesty,
I Don't Wanna Insult You, But Are You Nuts?

797
00:57:09,056 --> 00:57:12,793
This Isn't The Castle Where Everyone Kisses Your Butt.
This Is The Real, In-Your-Face,

798
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:16,730
Car-Jacking, Drive-By-Shooting,
Kill-You-For-Your-Reeboks Street Life.

799
00:57:16,762 --> 00:57:18,932
What Language
Art Thou Speaking, Boy?

800
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:22,670
Let Me Give It To You Straight.
They Find Out You're The King, You're Dead Meat.

801
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,139
The Murderer!

802
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:27,641
Come On, Men!

803
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:27,641
[Shouting, Yelling]

804
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:33,814

805
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:35,983

[Groaning]

807
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:43,757
Merlin,
Where Art Thou Now?

808
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:50,998
Sire!

809
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:54,235
Sire, Run!

<I>[Soldiers Groaning]</I>

811
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,844
We Are Lost.
The Royal Stables Is Under Heavy Guard.

812
00:58:03,876 --> 00:58:06,112
We Shall Never
Reach The Princess In Time.

813
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:09,484
Yeah, We Will.

814
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:09,484
Huh?

815
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:18,426
This Is Sorcery!
We Are Going To Die!

816
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:25,732
Your Highness,
Are You Okay?

817
00:58:25,766 --> 00:58:28,769
If "Okay" Means A Sore Bum,
Then Yes. [Groans]

818
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:33,874
- Great.
- The Black Knight!

819
00:58:33,907 --> 00:58:37,577
After Him!

820
00:58:33,907 --> 00:58:37,577
Chill Out.
He's On Our Side.

821
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:42,615
On Our Side?
I Don't Understand.

822
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:45,719
[Sighs]
Let's Boogie.

823
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:45,719
Boogie?

824
00:58:48,755 --> 00:58:50,525
Boogie?

825
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:01,601
I'm So Sorry About
The Princess Katey.

826
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:06,206
I Missed You
Desperately.

827
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:08,775
I Came Not For Comfort.
I Came To Say Good-Bye.

828
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:10,978
Good-Bye?

829
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:14,114
Oh, Dear Sweet Kane,

830
00:59:14,146 --> 00:59:18,251
I Have Lost Everyone I Have Ever Loved,
And Now I Have Lost You.

831
00:59:18,284 --> 00:59:21,788
No! You Have
Not Lost Me.

832
00:59:21,822 --> 00:59:27,294
No Matter What We Think, No Matter How We Feel,
Our Lives Are Not Our Own.

833
00:59:27,327 --> 00:59:29,830
Well, Then, We Will
Make Them Our Own.

834
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:32,766
It Is Too Late.
I Must Marry Lord Belasco.

835
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:40,942
Come On, Men!
We've Got Him!

836
00:59:47,813 --> 00:59:49,716
Go On.

837
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,585
Right.

838
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:14,975
You Know,
When I Was A Boy,

839
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:19,045
Much The Same As You,
I Could Not Face The Things I Feared.

840
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,717
It Was By Sheer Accident I Pulled
The Sword Excalibur From The Stone.

841
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:28,922
Oh, It's True Over The Years I
Grew Into A Strong King, But...

842
01:00:28,954 --> 01:00:33,994
Now, Alas,
I Fear I've Become That Cowering Boy Again.

843
01:00:34,027 --> 01:00:35,762
I've Lost All Faith
In Myself.

844
01:00:38,465 --> 01:00:41,168
And If I Cannot Believe
In Myself, Who Will?

845
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:44,971
You Know, Sire,

846
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:49,343
Where I Come From, There Are No Swords In
Stones That Turn Dweebs Like Me Into Heroes.

847
01:00:51,277 --> 01:00:54,180
I Used To Think
I Needed One.

848
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:56,817
But You Know What?
I Don't.

849
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:06,661
You're A Good Man,
Calvin Fuller.

850
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:26,146
This Is Impossible.
There's No Way Into This Place.

851
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:29,782
How Did You Say It?
"Chill Out."

852
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:31,418
[Sighs]

853
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:38,058
[Horses Neigh]

854
01:02:10,824 --> 01:02:13,126
Cool.
A Secret Passage.

855
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:16,329
Ahh. Merlin Showed It
To Me Long Ago...

856
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:19,799
When I Played Here
As A Boy.

857
01:02:21,101 --> 01:02:24,171
[Squeaking]

858
01:02:38,418 --> 01:02:41,855
- [Shrieks]
- Shh.

859
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:44,391
<I>Help!</I>

860
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:44,391
He's Got Her
In The Dungeon.

861
01:02:45,826 --> 01:02:47,894
<I>[Shrieking]</I>

862
01:02:55,235 --> 01:02:58,872
Hey, You.
