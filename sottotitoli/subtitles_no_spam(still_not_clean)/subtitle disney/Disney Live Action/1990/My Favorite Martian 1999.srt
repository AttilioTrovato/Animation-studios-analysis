1
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,322
[Man] Mars surface ops,
this is Houston. We're go for data.

2
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,693
[Man #2] Copy, Houston. Base pedal
temp good. Remote pedal actuator good.

3
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:32,264
Probe primary and auxiliary
transponders a-okay.

4
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,867
Shunt voltage three zero.

5
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:39,938
[Man #1]
D.S.N. uplink rate is now 61.101.

6
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,107
Copy. We'll see if we
can better that for you.

7
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,309
This is the probe's

8
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,645
We need all the data we can get.

9
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:51,750
Uh, standby.
We're getting a low current level here.

10
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,421
Voltage is down to, uh, 185.

11
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,224
[Man #2]
Here's our rock, fellas. One-one-niner.

12
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,493
- Beautiful.
- There it is again. There it is again.

13
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,797
Voltage down to 113.

14
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,965
- Can you repo the solar arrays?
- [Man #2] Uh, negative.

15
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,301
M.P.C. load is critical.

16
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,570
- [Beeping]
- Mars surface ops, we're losing the signal.

17
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,740
- We're losing the signal here!
- [Crackling]

18
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:19,812
Roger that.
Transmission terminated.

19
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,848
- Well, people, congratulations.
- [Smattering Of Applause]

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,285
We collected data
on over a dozen new rocks.

21
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:31,423
I'd say this was five years
and three trillion dollars well spent!

22
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:35,494

[Grunts]

28
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,339
Come on, gentlemen, keep up with me.
I want an exclusive...

29
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,508
with that policeman who was
in the Santa Barbara shootout.

30
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,576
- I'll take it.
- Glad you could make it, O'Hara.

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,212
Prescott, it's yours.
Take Harrison and camera car five.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,548
I want it for the 6:00.
It's no good at 10:00. You got that?

33
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,584
- It's no good at 10:00.
- What are you, a parrot? Get movin'.

34
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,188
I want footage of that 1st Monument Bank
that got knocked off down in Oxnard.

35
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,257
- I'm all over it.
- Van Gundy?

36
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,492
- Sir! - And get that security camera's videotape,
you got that?

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,728
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- No tape, no story.

38
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,497
You got it, boss.
Whatever you say, boss.

39
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,935
I like Van Gundy. I need something on
that shuttle launch tonight at Vandenberg.

40
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,437
- Well, that's me. I know Vandenberg, chief.
- Chief?

41
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,040
Who are you, Clark Kent?
FFelix, it's yours.

42
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,576
Get interviews
with all the top brass involved.

43
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,846
Oh, take Brace with you. It's a good
story for her to cut her teeth on.

44
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,750
Brace? Are you sure? Because I usually
produce Brace's on-camera segments.

45
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,587
We're a team. I mean, we're more
than a team. Brace and I are--

46
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,356
You and my daughter are what?

47
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:19,364
- Um, nothing.
- That's right.

48
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,267
I didn't send Brace to all those
fancy English boarding schools...

49
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,737
to wind up with the likes of you.

50
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,975
Oh, O'Hara, I've got something here
that's right up your alley.

51
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,312
A senior citizens' tanning contest
being held tomorrow at Sunset Pier.

52
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,415
The Hawaiian Tropic Senior
Cocoa Butter Classic.

53
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,984
- Huh?
- [Reporters Laughing]

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,220
I want footage
of all the old farts baking,

55
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,757
an interview with the doctor on
the dangers of sunbathing, yadda, yadda.

56
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:50,629
Something to fill time
if my idiot weatherman runs short.

57
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,934
Mr. Channing? Mr. Channing?
Excuse me. Sir?

58
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:01,006
You hired me because I had ten years'
experience as a newspaper reporter.

59
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,977
Now, I will go to the ends of the Earth
to bring you a great story.

60
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,180
But I need the chance.

61
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:13,252
You know, Tim, when I look at you,
I see myself at your age.

62
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,188
- Really?
- And I was a moron!

63
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,658
- Huh.
- But you got a lot of nerve, O'Hara, and I like that.

64
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,327
Sometimes.
Okay, it's yours.

65
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,796
- B-B-B-But you said--
- Shut up, Felix.

66
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,132
You won't-- You won't regret this, sir.
You really won't.

67
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,603
O'Hara! You screw up this Vandenberg
thing, you're fired. Is that clear?

68
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,940
Yeah.
Crystal.

69
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,009
[Man Over Loudspeaker]
Attention, all personnel.

70
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,311
We are T minus five minutes
and counting.

71
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,214
We're here at the Vandenberg Air Force
Base, where for the first time,

72
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,783
- Cut. Brace?
- The shuttle Atlantis will be launched...

73
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,686
- Sweetie, could we lose the gum?
- Billy!

74
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,788
Excuse me, Sergeant.

75
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,890
- [Spits]
- I love show business.

76
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,226
Yeah, okay. Everybody back
to one, please. Here we go.

77
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,331
Same thing.
In five, four, three, two--

78
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,400
We're here at Vandenberg Air Force Base.

79
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,802
- We're here at Vandenberg Air Force Base,
- Where just minutes from now,

80
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,806
where just minutes from now,
the shuttle Atlantis will be launching for the first time...

81
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,908
- on the west coast.
- I understand that Project Deadhead...

82
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,212
I understand that Project Deadhead
is carrying a sophisticated satellite...

83
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,983
- to study the Fiona comet.
- To study the Fiona comet.

84
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,053
Yes, the satellite has
a specialized guidance system...

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,523
which will allow it to pass
closer to the comet than ever before.

86
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,591
Yeah, yeah.
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

87
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,860
What?

88
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,164
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

89
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,867
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

90
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,171
- Well, yes, actually.
- Yes!

91
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,907
Project Deadhead
gets its name from the fact...

92
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,610
that its payload includes
the ashes of famous rocker...

93
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,746
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.

94
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,915
How in the world
did you know that?

95
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,784
- It's my job to know that.
- It's my job to know these things.

96
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,487
Well.

97
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:04,029
[Cheering, Applause]

98
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,409
- Okay, Lizzie, go to Brace.
- [Cheering Continues]

99
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,112
All right, Brace, here we go.
The big wrap-up.

100
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,382
- And so, on this the night of the Fiona Comet,
- And so, on this,

101
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,118
the night of the Fiona Comet,
our thoughts turn...

102
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,654
to that satellite's only passenger--
Jerry Garcia.

103
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,925
- I'm Brace Channing--
- I'm Brace Channing for KGSC.

104
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,261
- Thank you, Captain Dalton.
- Thank you.

105
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,799
- God, you're beautiful.
- God, you're beautiful.

106
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:45,437
- [Gasps]
- Thank you. So are you.

107
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,606
[Exhales]
And we're out.

108
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:51,877
- Tim, I'd like a word with you.
- And I'm dead.

109
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,648
- Colonel?
- Yes?

110
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,185
- You might want to take a look at this, sir.
- The Fiona Comet?

111
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,321
- So what?
- It's changing direction, sir.

112
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,491
That's impossible. Are you sure it's not
the trajectory of our own satellite?

113
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,162
Yes, sir. Uh, the comet's
just changed direction again, sir.

114
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,597
- It's gotta be the equipment.
- I've got down line confirmation.

115
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,767
No, sir. Our backup computers
verify all systems go.

116
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,670
It's-- It's coming down, sir.

117
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,674
- The satellite?
- No, sir. The comet.

118
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,843
Okay, let's go to general alert.

119
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,945
- Major, scramble the F-16s.
- Yes, sir!

120
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,114
- Sergeant, get SETI group on the line.
- Copy that.

121
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,284
Showtime, boys.
We got ourselves a U.F.O.

122
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,987
Excuse me.

123
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,458
- What's this?
- It's Capt. Dalton's telephone number.

124
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,561
Well, he's not really my type, but--

125
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,230
- You made me look such an idiot.
- Brace, come on.

126
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,400
- Let me explain.
- Just wait until I tell my daddy.

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,036
- No, Br-- Brace, come on!
- Billy!

128
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,138
- Wait a minute! Look, I--
- Nice knowin' ya.

129
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,841
Ooh-hoo.
Let us know where you end up.

130
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,510
- [Sighs]
- It wasn't a complete disaster.

131
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,846
Oh, compared to what?

132
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,914
- The Hindenburg?
- [Chuckles]

Thanks. Thanks a lot.

135
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,455
Sorry.

00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,243
We're goin' down!

You could have totalled my car!

00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,720
- Did you see it? Did you see it?
- See what?

149
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,889
[Stammering]
There was a crash. A plane or some--

150
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,958
It was like a stealth fighter!
I don't know!

151
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,828
- It happened so fast!
- Oh, my God, a plane crash!

Well, that's terrible!
We don't even have any video!

this light that--

00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,440
It was this huge thing!
It was this--

164
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,177
You know, it's really creepy out here.

165
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,580
[Grunting]
Ow!

166
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,318
Tim?

167
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,289
- You've got 30 seconds and I'm leaving!
- Hmm.

00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,299
- Look at this.
- [Screams] What's that?

171
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,002
I don't know.
I-I-- I don't know.

172
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,972
- Is this your idea of a joke? - No, I swear to
you-- look at-- I mean, this thing was huge.

173
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,976
Oh, really? And I thought
you were one of the normal ones!

174
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,079
- [Alien Breathing Heavily]
- I am one of the normal ones, normally.

175
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,515
[Scoffs]
Ha ha ha.

176
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,219
[Scoffs]
Nice try, Tim.

177
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,356
You and me, alone on the beach, on
the night of a lunar eclipse, no less.

178
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,393
- I didn't make this up!
- Keep this as a memento of our last date.

179
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,095
Last date?
We haven't even had our first date!

180
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,731
- [Engine Starting]
- Well, consider this both.

181
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,634
- Brace? Brace!

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,042
[Grunting]
Ahh.

[Inhales Deeply]
Humans.

187
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,967
- Come on, come on, come on.
- [Engine Sputtering]

188
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:51,476
- Savages!

[Car Sputtering, Backfiring]

191
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,419
- Tim!
- Aaah! Mrs. Brown.

192
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,255
- Too much lipstick?
- Uh, well,

193
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,858
no, no, no, no.

194
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,128
No, it's just that you, uh...

195
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,330
kind of appeared, that's all.

196
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,665
I saved you some
of my special brownies.

197
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,001
Mrs. Brown, brownies. Get it?
[Chuckles]

198
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,103
- Yes! That's good.
- There you go.

199
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,706
- Thank you very much.
- [Chuckles] Did you see the eclipse?

200
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,642
Wasn't it très magnifique?

201
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,011
- Those French tapes are really paying off, aren't they?
- Oh, you noticed.

202
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,380
- [Chuckles] Thanks for the brownies, Mrs. Brown.
- [Chuckles]

203
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,984
Oh, Tim.
I wanted to remind you...

204
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,686
about the charity rummage sale
this weekend.

205
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,556
If you have anything you want to donate,
leave it in the garage and I'll pick it up.

206
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,992
Well, trust me, this will be
right on top of the pile.

207
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,662
- Ahh.
- Good night, Mrs. Brown.

208
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,000
One more thing I wanted to tell you,
Tim! Oh, good night, Tim!

209
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,636
[Sighs]

210
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,651
I'm havin' a bad night.

211
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,520
I couldn't agree with ya
more completely.

212
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,990
- Shut up.
- How do you do it?

213
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,227
- [Answering Machine Beeps]
- O'Hara here. Please leave a message. Make it short.

- [Answering Machine Beeps]
- Channing here. You're fired.

215
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,367
- Short enough for ya?
- [Receiver Clicks]

[Groans]

222
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,221
[Gasps]
Stay where you are, little Earth man,

223
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,423
and no harm will come to you.

224
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,994
Say, I wish I'd thought of that!

225
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,797
- [Tim] Hello?
- What more can I say? When you're right, you're right!

226
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,433
- Be silent.
- How do you do it?

227
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,103
I thought I told you to shut up.

228
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,739
I couldn't agree with you more--
[Muffled]

229
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,341
You leave me no choice.

230
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,711
Who's there?
I got a gun!

231
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,828

00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,482
- Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,851
- Hey! [Grunts]
- That's it, Earthling!

234
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,556
- [Grunting]
- It's alive!

235
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,826
Hyah!

236
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,330
Okay, you wanna play games?

237
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,400
- Slide through.
- I must be going... [Grunts] nuts.

238
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,137
[Laughs]
One strike, no balls.

239
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,374
Over here, Tiger Woods.

- Ohh!

244
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,424
Mutilate you!

245
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,431
Come on!
Show your face... if you have one.

246
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,904
Where-- Where'd he go?

247
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:54,412
What the heck
was in those brownies?

248
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,081
When dealing with primitive life-forms,

249
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,051
sometimes one must
resort to primitive acts.

250
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,054
- Are you okay, Zoot?
- [Coughing]

251
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,457
If you don't mind my asking, where were you?
This alien was trying to kill me!

252
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,226
Don't be such a wet blanket.

253
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,396
Wait a minute.
Leave my mother out of this!

254
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,564
It's your fault we ended up
on this no-good, carbon-based,

255
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,701
- over-oxygenated, miserable excuse of a--
- [Knock On Door]

256
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,970
- [Woman] Tim?
- Oh, no. It's another one!

257
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,773
I know you're not asleep yet.

258
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,075
Tim, it's Lizzie!

259
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,444
[Gasps]
Blotz! It's Lizzie!

260
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,546
What's a Lizzie?

261
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,482
I would say a Model T Ford,
but this one has better tires.

262
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,119
- Ah-ooga! Ah-ooga!
- I know what a woman is, but what do I do with it?

263
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,756
Help, Mr. Lifeguard, I'm drowning.
I need mouth-to-mouth.

264
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,225
Ugh, saliva exchange.

265
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,961
I would never partake
in such an unsanitary interaction.

266
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,431
There must be some other way
to greet a female and then be rid of it.

267
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,499
- [Knock On Door]
- Tim! - [Gasps]

268
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,902
If it was me, I'd be he.

269
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,172
- Tim, please.
- Good thinking, Zoot.

270
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,993
Okay, Tim,
I'm picking up the hide-a-key.

271
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,933
- Gonna open the door.
- [Key Turning]

272
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,270
- Tim?
- Lizzie!

273
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,473
My dear friend or family member.

274
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,975
Uh, oh, my gosh.

275
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,978
Oh, inappropriate.

276
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:39,150
- Oh, boy.
- [Zoot] I told you they cover their flingdat here.

277
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,286
Lizzie, my dear friend
or family member.

278
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,555
You sound funny.
Are you catching a cold?

279
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,858
A cold, a virus?
[Deep Voice] Yes.

280
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,393
[Voice Changing] A contagious
bubonic plague. You better leave.

281
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,196
What? What in the world--

282
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,333
Are-- Are you a Trekkie?

283
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,469
Uh, yes, I am.

284
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,005
Okay, what's going on?

285
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,908
- What's going on?
- Tim, are you okay?

286
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,310
- You don't seem like yourself.
- Oh, I'm Tim, all right.

287
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,547
- Tim O'Hara, no reason to doubt it.
- Uh, what's going on?

288
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,083
Lots.

289
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,824
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

290
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,565
- Lizzie.
- Yeah?

291
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,668
If you're my sister,
an explanation is in order.

292
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,938
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

293
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,674
- Does this mean that you and I are--
- Indeed.

294
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,511
- Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do, and you...
- What?

295
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,747
- Need... to go.
- Huh?

296
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,983
Wha--

297
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,956
- Human emotions.
- Crazy monkeys.

298
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,296
[Humming]

299
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:03,100

00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:16,280
- [Beeping]
- [Chattering]

301
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,851
Welcome, sir.

302
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,589
Where's Coleye?

303
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,993
Examining mucus-type protoplasm.

304
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,731
Hmm. It's saline-based.

305
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,001
Good God, Coleye,
put that on a slide next time.

306
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,471
I want this stuff analyzed
and the cigarette dusted for prints.

307
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,709
- I want to know whose this was.
- There's more, sir.

308
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,780
[Coleye]
Quadroped becomes... biped?

309
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,783
It must have taken human form!

310
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,286
The footprints stop at the road.

311
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,421
We think someone
may have picked them up.

312
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,924
Evidence of a crash,

313
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,526
no spaceship and alien
in human form?

314
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,129
It's just like the incident of '64!

315
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,765
Keep your mouth shut, you idiot.

316
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,134
That incident is not only classified,

317
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,870
but it never happened, you got it?

318
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,774
- Yes, sir.
- Once again, we have no alien, no U.F.O.

319
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,143
If you can't get me either one,

320
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,279
then you'd better start
looking for another job.

321
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,048
Well, you heard him! Move it!
It's out there somewhere!

322
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,150
- So, move it! Go! Move!
- Yes, sir!

323
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,354
And God help the poor soul...

324
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,857
who picked him up.

325
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,835
[Screams]

326
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,904
Silence, subculturer!

327
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,175
- Let me down!
- Look what you did to me. Barbarian!

328
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,544
- Let me down!
- As you wish!

329
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,314
- [Electronic Buzz]
- [Screams, Crashes]

330
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,549
[Grunts]

331
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,754
For a thief,
you are extremely clumsy.

332
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,358
- Thief? I'm not a thief.
- So I see.

333
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,394
Tim O'Hara.
You are a reporter.

334
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,064
Reporter? No.
I'm a producer, pal!

335
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,434
- Let me tell ya, I-- Aaah!
- [Electronic Buzzing]

336
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,404
Look, I didn't steal anything, okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.

337
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,074
- All right, all right.
- [Electronic Buzzing]

338
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,210
No! No!
[Coughing]

339
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,380
Warning, Tim O'Hara. Any attempt
to expose me will be useless.

340
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,384
Martians use 100 % of their brain
capacity, humans less than 10.

341
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:38,255
- I think we use more than ten.
- Your astronauts pee in their space suits.

342
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,425
Case closed.

343
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,296
[Grunting]

344
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,798
Okay. Okay, just--

345
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,136
[Electronic Whirring]

346
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,642
Whoa!

347
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,285
Okay, it's just a dream.
It's a very bad dream.

348
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:13,391
[Panting] Just-- Come on.
Wake up. Wake up!

349
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,993
What's with that?

350
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:20,264
- I believe it's called a nervous breakdown.
- Last night did not happen.

351
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,567
- I don't believe in aliens.
- I heard that!

352
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:27,304
To us, you are the alien.

353
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,141
If you must know,
I am from the planet you call Mars.

354
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:34,278
- And what, I'm from Uranus? I never--
- I was getting to you!

355
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,514
Don't get a crease in your Sputnik.

356
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,783
[Zoot] Please,
just introduce me to monkey boy.

357
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,953
This is my Zoot.

358
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,657
- A polymorphous Zootenex 3,000.
- Just look, don't touch.

359
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,127
- Your suit talks?
- [Scoffs] Incessantly.

360
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,196
Corduroys talk,
nobody gives them grief.

361
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,298
- [Zoot] Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.
- Mars? Wait a minute.

362
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,269
[Stuttering] There's no life on Mars.
We've sent probes.

363
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,939
I'd try to explain it, but you people
still think "E" equals "MC" squared.

364
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:06,143
- You're still trying to analyze our rocks. Ha-ha!
- [Hydraulic Hissing]

365
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,847
Oh! Blasted sand particles.

366
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,117
They've completely crystallized
the vortex generator.

367
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,653
- Hey, do you mind? - [Knock On Door]
- [Mrs. Brown] Tim!

368
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,488
- [Gasps]
- Now what?

369
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,957
- Thank God, an eyewitness.
- Eyewitness? Negative.

370
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:24,195
- You must tell no one. - No offence,
but your ship is double-parked in my living room.

371
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,730
You're the biggest story
in the history of mankind!

372
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,500
There is intelligent life
out there in the universe!

373
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,335
I hope you're not including yourself
in that statement!

374
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,171
Tim, listen, I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning,

375
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,240
but I got a hold of your mail,
and I wanted--

376
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,910
Could you just-- please, come here.
Take a look at that!

377
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,913
[Tim]
Aaah!

378
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,918
Tim, you definitely need a maid!
Oh, hello!

379
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:54,992
- Greetings.
- Oh, I'm sorry to catch you in your... pyjamas.

380
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,762
- Pyjamas? [Muffled]
- [Stammering] Where's the spaceship?

381
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,398
- [Mrs. Brown] Spaceship?
- Right here.

382
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,435
Oh, for the rummage sale!
Does it come with an action figure?

383
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,438
- You're looking at him.
- [Chuckles] Oh. I don't believe we've met.

384
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,541
- No, don't touch him! He's a Martian.
- Tim, what's going on?

385
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,610
- [Stuttering]
- I beg your-- Mart-- Martin?

386
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,246
- Yes. Martin.
- No, no, no, no!

387
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,715
- He's a-- uh--
- Uncle!

388
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:21,051
- Martin.
- Oh.

389
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,221
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- He turns invisible, okay?

390
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,290
His suit talks--
he's got a talking suit.

391
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,392
He's got these things that
pop out of his head-- You just--

392
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,928
- Show her. Go ahead. Come on, give her the finger.
- Tim!

393
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:35,399
No, I didn't mean that.
I don't know what I mean. Forget it.

394
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,469
You'll have to forgive Tim, Mrs. Brown.
He lost his job last night,

395
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,571
and he's experiencing
a nervous breakdown.

396
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,806
Oh, poor dear.

397
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,909
- I hope it doesn't affect the rent.
- [Laughing Hysterically]

398
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,945
- Don't worry, I'm here to look after him.
- Ha!

399
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,882
He's very lucky to have
an uncle like you in his life, Martin.

400
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,753
And you, Mrs. Brown, are like a brilliant
quasar in the black hole of my day.

401
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,056
Oh! Call me Lorelei.

402
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,992
Lorelei.
The sound of...

403
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,096
pure mountain spring water
from the centre of the Earth.

404
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,899
Oh, my.
[Chuckles]

405
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,006
- [Slurping]
- [Stammering]

406
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,009
Oh!
[Chuckles]

407
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,680
I obviously misconstrued a custom.
I apologize.

408
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,116
I'm from... New York.

409
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,086
No, actually, it's--
[Stuttering] It's fine.

410
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,823
[Stuttering]
It's perfect. [Sighs]

411
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,759
- Oh, brother.
- Oh, Martin?

412
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,828
Yes, Lorelei?

413
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:43,801
Um, Mr. Brown... passed away
several years ago.

414
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,806
- I thought you might like to know that.
- Hmm.

415
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,610
Au revoir.
[Chuckles]

416
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,645
Hmm?

417
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,214
Just for the record,
a handshake will do for me.

418
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,316
[Scoffs]
You think that I actually enjoyed...

419
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,518
tasting that female's exoskeleton?

420
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:05,489
[Shudders] I merely used my data on
your primitive species to determine...

421
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,958
the optimum way
to avoid suspicion.

422
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,629
- Yeah, but what's the optimum way to get home?
- [Scoffs] Blotz!

423
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:16,133
I don't know, Zoot. Where on this
barbaric swamp of a planet...

424
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,470
can we find the makings
of an electron accelerator?

425
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,539
- [Zoot] Maybe your new girlfriend has one.
- Oh, that's very funny.

426
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,976
Excuse me. Fellas,
I don't mean to interrupt, but...

427
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:31,181
I-I, you know, I think I might be able
to help you find that electron thing.

428
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,983
We're toast.

429
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,819
I don't believe this.
You really think you can...

430
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,888
repair your ship
with all this junk?

431
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,257
Everything has been carefully chosen
for its potential to fashion...

432
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,893
a crude vortex electron accelerator.

433
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,929
Except for this.
A pooper scooper.

434
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,732
I have no idea what it does,
but it's fascinating.

435
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,337
Excuse me. Where are your
nuclear implosion couplers?

436
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,839
For a garden hose?

437
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,577
I'm never going to get off
this infernal planet.

438
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,846
[Zoot]
The I.Q. of a pancake.

439
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,948
You're right. Humans are truly
the amoebas of the universe!

440
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,618
Yeah, this from a guy
who talks to his tin foil suit.

441
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,788
- Hey, what was that for?
- It wasn't me, it was Zoot.

442
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,958
- [Zoot Laughing]
- Come here a sec.

443
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,761
Listen, you've been on Earth,
what, all of ten minutes?

444
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,264
- It's not so bad here.
- [Chuckles] That's what Neenurt said.

445
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:24,234
- Who?
- Exactly. One of my planet's most gifted scientists,

446
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,904
and now he's gone without a trace.

447
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,774
He arrived on Earth in 1964, and, I presume,
was abducted by your government.

448
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,976
I shudder to think what they did to him
in the name of science.

449
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:37,314
- What are they laughing at?
- [Laughing] Hey, space man!

450
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,451
- I've been discovered!
- [Electronic Buzz] - [Gasps]

451
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,053
- [Grunting]
- Sorry about that.

452
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,822
- Oh, my--
- What happened?

453
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,157
They don't know anything.
They were just making fun of your--

454
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,661
Making fun. I'm one of
the best-dressed beings on my planet.

455
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,763
[Man]
Yo, Elvis! Nice suit.

456
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:57,101
Well, Dorothy, I hate to tell you this,
but you're not in Kansas any more.

457
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,269
[Zoot] That's great.
The minute I turn my back,

458
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,772
you're getting into
someone else's pants!

459
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,908
[Martin] I need to blend in, and you stand
out like a putt stick at a blackbell convention.

460
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,977
[Zoot] I should have known
by the way you've been gawking...

461
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,113
at every T-shirt
and sweat pant we pass.

462
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,516
- Don't come apart at the seams!
- Why is Zoot always the last to know?

463
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,952
- All right, all right, all right!
- [Zoot Sobbing]

464
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,856
- Martian footage, take one.
- Zoot, this is tearing me apart too.

465
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,759
[Zoot]
I know I'm not what I used to be.

466
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,661
I mean, a stretch mark here,
a line stain there.

467
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,030
[Zoot Sobbing]

468
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,701
[Screams]

469
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,504
- Hey!
- Pervert!

470
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,607
It's not safe
for a woman around here!

471
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,742
I'm ready to blend in now.

472
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,617
- Outstanding.
- Martin, that outfit looks ridic--

473
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,386
- Stylin', bro!
- Thanks, bro.

474
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,488
[Chuckles]
Real cool.

475
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,557
I've got the touch on two planets.

476
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,959
I gotta get out more.
How did your Zoot take the--

477
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,328
Zoot, he's highly intelligent.
He understands.

478
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,865
Aaaah!
You used me, you buttonhole!

479
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:06,036
- Go and have your fling. Colours fade! You'll see!
- [Knock On Door]

480
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,472
- Hello?
- Huh? Oh, incoming.

481
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,275
Hello?
Man.

482
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,711
Oh, geez!

483
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,514
Talk about a tacky suit!

484
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,583
- [Chuckles]
- Tacky, huh?

485
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,454
Hey! Hey! What?

486
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,927
- Now turn the other cheek.

touch that stuff again.

00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,786
One scoop's too many,
and a million aren't enough!

656
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,156
So, how's it coming, anyway?

657
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,425
Oh, I converted a blow dryer,
two elastic bands...

658
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,594
and an Acme Bug-Away insect bomb...

659
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,663

- Not at all, but on the positive side,

Why not, indeed?

- ["I Feel Good"] - Move over, Zoot!
- Martin, I meant--

676
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:24,147
I meant out in the hot tub, out back.
It would be private, by yourself.

677
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,350
You mean spit out my Nurplex...

678
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,886
and revert to Martian form
right outside your domicile?

- Yeah?

It's just a hot tub, Martin.
No big deal.

positively identified...

by my team of experts
as your cigarette.

696
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,874
It was discovered
at the site of a U.F.O. crash!

00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,744
- What?
- And on it are trace elements...

of what we believe
to be alien DNA.

- Alien?
- Oh, don't play dumb with me!

Oh.
So sorry.

707
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:02,312

So, Miss Channing,

708

do you have any idea
how alien DNA...

let's talk about what's in this for me.

how you felt about somebody,

just suddenly changed your mind?

If I don't take off by 9:00 tonight,
you'll hear a lot more than that.

819
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,630
- Uh, how much more?
- [Makes Explosion Sound]

820
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,833
- Uh-huh.
- Lublick.

821
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:36,038
- Uh, you b--
- [Gulping]

822
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,747
[Belches]
Ahhh!

823
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:52,088
I know you've done your best
to help me, but it's no use.

824
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,591
[Gasps]
Oh, no.

825
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,562
I'm sinking into
a Martian depression.

826
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,098
Sinking? No, no sinking.
Come on, we gotta go fix this thing.

827
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,333
I'm falling apart, Tim.

828
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,402
Oh, no, you're not.

829
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,772
- [Sobbing]
- Come on.

830
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,175
- Yes you are.
- On Mars, when we get depressed,

831
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:17,546
we literally fall apart!

832
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,182
- [Screams]
- Okay, no problem.

833
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,752
Don't move, don't make it
any worse than it already is.

834
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,755
- What we're gonna do is we're gonna
put you back together. - [Screams]

835
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,891
Does it screw in?
It's not--

836
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:33,396
- Okay, just---aaah! No!
- I wanna go home!

837
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,965
- We're gonna put our heads together--
- [Gasps]

838
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,534
- Aaaah!
- [Knock On Door]

839
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,403
- Coming!
- Who's that?

840
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,705
- It's Lizzie!
- Lizzie? Oh, no.

841
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,108
You wait here.

842
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,444
- Where are you going with those?
- Just tidying up!

843
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,414
Give 'em back! Give me back my arms!
Give me back--

844
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,450
Why do I have to die here?
[Groaning]

845
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,453
Hello?

846
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,922
- Yoo-hoo!
- Don't move.

847
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,824
Tim!

848
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,293
Does anything in this room
strike you as odd?

849
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,395
- Tim?
- [Gasps]

850
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,564
[Martin]
Just a minute!

851
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,466
- Aaah!
- Would you just be quiet?

852
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,803
Coming! Lizzie!
Oh, Br-Br-Brace!

853
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,272
Tim!
Are you decent?

854
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:20,076
Oh, yeah! Yes, I am.
[Stuttering] What a surprise!

855
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,611
- Yes, now get lost!
- What did you say?

856
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,981
Uh, I'm lost.
I mean, [Chuckles]

857
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,150
I'm at a loss
for how beautiful you look.

858
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,555
Hey, hey, hey, hey--
[Screams]

859
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,259
Now, Tim, I hope you're gonna
let me make it up to you.

860
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,462
Oh, no, you don't have to do that.
I mean, that--

861
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:45,201
Well, you know, that's up to you.
I mean, if that's--

862
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,172
I brought a little peace offering.

863
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,374
- Where are your wine glasses?
- No, no, no--

864
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,377
That's the bedroom.
No glasses up there.

865
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,480
Oh, well,
maybe I'll get a little tour later.

866
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,849
- [Martin] Don't miss the bathroom!
- I'm sorry?

867
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,984
I have to go to the bathroom later.
Later.

868
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,820
Um, glasses are in the kitchen.

869
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,022
Why don't I go get them,
and you just...

870
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,225
kind of make yourself at home.

871
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,794
Okay.

872
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,832
- Fantastic apartment, Tim.
- Thank you very much.

873
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,135
- [Cork Pops]
- Ah, yeah, there we go.

874
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,872
Oh! What a slob!

875
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:28,043
[Humming]

876
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,014
[Martin Grunting]
Cut it out!

877
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:36,085
- Hey!
- Yes, let's fall in love

878
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,254
- Ooh!
- Why shouldn't we

879
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,657
- Fall in love
- Mmm, that's the spot.

880
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,527
Let's take a chance

881
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:48,664
- Ooh, yeah. Mmm.
- Why be afraid of it, ba-ba-doo-day

882
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,100
- Let's close our eyes
- [Moaning]

883
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,103
And make our own paradise

884
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:59,275
- Little we know
- Oh, oh, no, harder, like before.

885
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,444
- Ahhh.
- Oh, baby

886
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,214
- Where's the wine?
- Uh, uh--

887
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:09,118
Why shouldn't
we fall in love

888
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,787
- I'll get it.
- Now is the time for it While we are young

889
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,523
Let's fall in love

890
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,625
You know, I asked Daddy
about giving you another chance.

891
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,961
Oh, oh, good!

892
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:25,668
- Here we go.
- Oh, lovely. Thanks.

893
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,240
Hmm. You know, I thought
that crash of yours...

894
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,576
might make a kind of
cute little story.

895
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,745
- Oh, really? Good. That's--
- Mm-hmm.

896
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,881
[Grunts]
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

897
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,617
Cut it out!

898
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,919
- What was that?
- Uh, I didn't hear anything.

899
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:47,423
Tim, get rid of--
[Groaning]

900
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,825
Are you all right?

901
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,429
Yes, I just--
I really have to go to the bathroom.

902
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:58,100
- Well, hurry back.
- [Chuckles]

903
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:01,337
- Why shouldn't we fall in love
- Be a minute.

904
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,106
- Now's the time while we're young
- [Sighs]

905
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,910
Tim!
Get me outta here!

906
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,746
Stop making all that noise!

907
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,816
Tell her to stop punching me!
Besides, what are you doing...

908
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,918
letting that female
in your apartment?

909
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:19,188
I've been waiting a long time
to get Brace Channing into my apartment.

910
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,124
But you like Lizzie! I could tell
through your saliva exchange.

911
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,960
- Excuse me?
- Look, Tim, the other night,

912
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,096
when you were unconscious,
Lizzie came here.

913
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,798
- And you what, you kissed her?
- Yes-- No, no--

914
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,101
Well, you did.

915
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,203
I did a molecular
identiclone of your body.

916
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,805
- What? You what?
- You'd never understand.

917
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,874
You people think E-mail is amazing.

918
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,644
The point is, while I was you,

919
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,113
I tapped into your subconscious,
and trust me, you like Lizzie.

920
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,483
That's why I thought it was okay
for you to kiss her.

921
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,918
I-I-I didn't kiss her, you did!

922
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,562
[Gasps]
Bingo!

923
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,801
Tim? I let myself
in the back door.

924
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,704
Hello?

925
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:13,008
- Oh, isn't this nice?
- Lizzie, is that you?

926
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:16,745
Oh, you look, um, nice.

927
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,181
He's in the bathroom,

928
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,717
and he's all yours.

929
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,053
I got what I came for.

930
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:31,393
- Oh, this is great.
- Tim!

931
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,697
- We don't have a lot of time here!
- I'm confused, all right?

932
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,566
- Everything was going along fine until you came along.
- Don't kid yourself.

933
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,569
Even a substandard species
such as yours has feelings.

934
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:44,773
Just slow down for one millisecond
and look into your heart.

935
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,309
Whose face do you see?

936
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,019
Look, Brace, I think--
Lizzie!

937
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,290
Whoa!
Lizzie, no, wait, wait--

938
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,560
- No, please!
- This better be good.

939
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,328
Oh, it is. It is.

940
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,231
Uh, remember that guy
I was with at the pier yesterday?

941
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:12,468
- Your Uncle Martin.
- He's not my uncle.

942
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,570
He's a Martian!

943
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,505
- [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

944
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:20,242
- You are such a jerk!
- No, no, no. He's a Martian!

945
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,412
It's the truth. In fact,
he's the one who kissed you, not me.

946
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,280
- Really?
- Yeah.

947
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,850
His head's in my sink right now.

948
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,819
- [Grunts]
- Get some sleep. You look awful.

949
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,089
- Lizzie--
- And if there was anything kinky on that videotape,

950
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:37,693
you better get Brace to give it back.

951
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,934
[Zoot Grunts] Fine!
Since when did I become a mechanic?

952
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,671
- [Drill Whirring]
- Do I look like overalls?

953
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,977
Uncle Martin!

954
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,880
- [Scissors Snipping]
- [Zoot] Okay. Don't cut the red one.

955
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,549
- Or was it the blue one? [Mumbling]
- Ooh!

956
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,719
I can't see a thing down here!

957
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,888
Oh, thanks.

958
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,160
- [Electricity Zapping]
- Ow! Geez, that hurt!

959
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,395
- [Screams]
- No! - [Screams]

960
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,998
Lady, please!
Put a sock in it! Quiet!

961
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,066
The baby's sleeping!

962
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,536
Martin, I told you.
We gotta get to the...

963
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,638
TV station before Brace does.

964
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,973
- [Martin] Open the bag!
- Okay, okay.

965
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,342
- [Gasping] I can't breathe!
- I'm sorry.

966
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,245
- Where is that confounded Zoot?
- Zoot? Uh--

967
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:34,016
Zoot! Zoot! I think he's
in the middle of a spin cycle.

968
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,920
Leave him! Quick, Tim!
Get my arm out of the other bag!

969
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,522
- All right. Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay.

970
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,026
- Okay.
- Yes! Excellent! Toward the ship!

971
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,994
- Huh? What?
- Higher! Higher! Okay, here!

972
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,931
Here we go!
[Grunts] Yes!

973
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,600
- [Whimpering]
- [Martin] Easy. Oh, no!

974
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,337
- [Screaming]
- Oh, no! Don't send me to the shrink!

975
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,206
- [Whimpering]
- Ohh!

976
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,242
- What was that?
- Uh-oh.

977
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,279
Sweetie-pie,

978
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,415
this is the most amazing footage
I've ever seen.

979
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,851
Felix!
O'Hara's tapes are going on the 6:00.

980
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:11,053
- Van Gundy, call the network.
- Yeah?

981
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,956
Brace is going out live
with the story of the century!

982
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,627
[Martin]
I'm feeling a little carsick!

983
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,729
- Oh!
- Sorry.

984
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,432
[Martin Grunting]

985
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,069
I can't take it any more.
I can't take it any more!

986
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:31,206
- We're running out of time. Try and pull yourself
together. - Why? We're all doomed anyway.

987
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,810
Without my blasted electron accelerator,
the I.S.S. will blow!

988
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,112
I feel like a hacksaw murderer.

989
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,615
What the heck is
an electron accelerator anyway?

990
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,751
It's a simple low-amperage power source
that activates the main thrusters.

991
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:46,622
- Oh. Kind of like an alternator?
- What's an alternator?

992
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,725
- It, uh, turns over the engine in a car.
- [Gasps] A car?

993
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,461
That's it! That should work!
We're saved!

994
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,563
- Not quite.
- Yes, we are.

995
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,332
- Whoo-hoo! Ha, ha, ha.
- Listen, I've been--

996
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,269
I've been videotaping you.
I've got everything. I got the ship.

997
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:03,505
I got Zoot.
I even got you in your Martian form.

998
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,308
I was putting together a story,
and I was gonna get it on the air,

999
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,477
- but I couldn't do it.
- Why not?

1000
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,279
Because I like you, Martin.

1001
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,481
I like you. I--

1002
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,516
And I'm sorry.
I-I just-- I'm sorry.

1003
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:18,020
I I-- I apologize.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1004
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,923
- You're a good human, Tim O'Hara.
- Oh, oh, yeah. I'm a terrific--

1005
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,091
Martin!
You're back!

1006
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,360
And I like you too.

1007
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,096
- Oh-ho!
- I've never had feelings before!

1008
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,132
- Oh.
- [Chuckles]

1009
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,201
Now, let's go fix my ship.

1010
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,370
Yeah, okay-- No!
No, we got a problem-- the tapes.

1011
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,974
- Brace goes on with the Martian story in five minutes.
- Oh, blotz.

1012
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:42,778
Yeah, and I got to get these tapes and
get to Brace before she gets on the air.

1013
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:45,480
But there's not enough time.
You can't be in two places at once.

1014
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,984
Yeah. Wait a minute!
Come on!

1015
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,520
Is there an alien amongst us?

1016
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,490
Is there an alien amongst us?

1017
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,993
- Is there an alien among--
- [Knocking]

1018
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,663
Billy, now what?

1019
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,399
I want to be Brace Channing.

1020
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,902
Yeah, well, get in line.
I'm sorry.

1021
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,570
I really don't have time
to do any auto--

1022
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,408
- [Gasps]
- Quaint, aren't they?

1023
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,144
These days, most of our young
are born cable-ready.

1024
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,180
You're the--
[Gasps]

1025
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,450
[Gasps] Daddy!
[Screams]

1026
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,820
[Director]
Heads up. Four minutes to air.

1027
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,156
First positions, everyone.

1028
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:32,094
Tim! What are you doing here?
You look, uh, tired.

1029
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:35,364
Oh, yeah. I was up all night with Brace
working on the alien story.

1030
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:38,900
I made a couple of mistakes in tape number two,
but that's the corrected version.

1031
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:43,705
Now if I could just get through this
without having to look in a mirror.

1032
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:47,309
- Hmm.
- [Director] Coming up on three minutes to air.

1033
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,280
[Grunts]

1034
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,922
Tim!

1035
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,192
- Martin, is that you?
- Does a wild bear blotz in the woods?

1036
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,196
Good, good. Okay. Just--
Just read the copy as written. Go.

1037
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,100
- Hi, Brace.
- [Chuckling Nervously]

1038
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,203
- Congratulations, Brace.
- Yes, I'm Brace Channing.

1039
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,806
[Man]
Let's hear it for Brace!

1040
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:21,376
[Whistling, Applauding]

1041
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:25,414
- Dr Coleye, you're going to become a very famous man.
- Thirty I.D. and open.

1042
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,582
- [Announcer] KGSC.
- Ready camera one live.

1043
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,785
- The news for southern California...
- [Grunting]

1044
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:34,656
with anchor Howard Greenly and
on special assignment, Brace Channing.

1045
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,159
- What the hell is she wearing?
- You know Brace.

1046
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:41,229
- Yeah. Must be trendy.
- [Director] Fifteen seconds, people.

1047
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:46,268
[Mr. Channing]
Sweetie-pie, get rid of the gum.

1048
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,504
- Billy! - Come on, Brace!
- Leave the gum, Billy!

1049
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:53,075
- Get the gum, Billy!
- [Man] Brace, ten seconds. - No.

1050
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,277
Ready?
Camera two live in five--

1051
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,945
- Give me the gum, Brace!
- No! No! No!

1052
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,281
- Four-- - No!
- Leave it! Leave it!

1053
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,950
- Three--
- Get the damn gum!

1054
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,320
- [Roars]
- [Announcer] Are there aliens amongst us?

1055
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,823
This report is being broadcast live.

1056
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,592
- The gum is out.
- Oh, good. Thanks to you, Felix.

1057
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,529
[Announcer]
And now, Howard Greenly...

1058
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,865
- And cue Howard.
- And Brace Channing!

1059
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:19,267
- Good evening. I'm Howard Greenly.
- [Groaning]

1060
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,003
- What's up with her?
- I don't know.

1061
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:27,375
...a story developing throughout the day
right here in southern California.

1062
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:32,147
Our own Brace Channing has been
following the events as they take place.

1063
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,549
- Brace?
- [Groans]

1064
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:37,052
- What is she doing?
- Howard--

1065
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,187
- Camera two go.
- No!

1066
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,890
[Greenly]
Brace?

1067
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,159
- Brace!
- Just read the copy!

1068
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:47,162
[Groans]
Just get the nurplex.

1069
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,531
What's going on here?

1070
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,633
Is there an alien amongst us?

1071
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,636
- Oh. It's all right.
- According to Dr Elliot Coleye,

1072
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:58,173
chief biologist and head researcher
for the SETI group,

1073
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,575
the answer is--

1074
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,411
- [Gasping]
- Yes.

1075
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,982
- She's an alien!
- She's not an alien. She's my daughter!

1076
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,417
[Voice Tonality Wavering] What you're
about to see is that evidence...

1077
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:12,187
[Squawks]
of the actual footage of the alien.

1078
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,823
But I warn you--
it's appearance is unlike...

1079
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,526
[Gasps] anything you are
likely to have seen before.

1080
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,762
She's going under the table.
She's going under the table!

1081
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,665
- [Continues, Voice Wavering]
- And go.

1082
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:27,035
- Feelin' hot, hot, hot
- What the hell is this?

1083
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,505
- Somebody mislabelled the tapes!
- Come on. Got it!

1084
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,074
- I don't know. Let's go back live.
- Tim!

1085
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,510
What is O'Hara doing with my daughter?

1086
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,446
- I-I-I don't know. I--
- Get me out of here!

1087
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,949
- [Chattering]
- [Muffled Screaming]

1088
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,852
- [Shouting]
- Get me the network!

1089
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,388
- You're a dead man, O'Hara!
- Come on!

1090
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:50,058
I think that went pretty well,
don't you?

1091
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,761
- [Muffled Shouting]
- [Martin] All right. Calm down.

1092
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,297
Search everywhere!

1093
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,433
Boy, her head was dark and empty.

1094
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,936
- There they are! There they are!
- [Muffled Shouting]

1095
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,205
Wait!

1096
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,076
I think Miss Channing might have been
contaminated by the alien.

1097
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,112
- Hmm?
- I'm just going to give her a quick examination.

1098
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,381
[Muffled Shout]
No!

1099
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,584
I'll just be a moment.

1100
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,752
Ah.
There we go.

1101
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,888
Let's see.
Am I forgetting something?

1102
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,891
Oh.
[Humming]

1103
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,760
There it is.

1104
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,829
[Humming Resumes]

1105
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,898
- Mrs. Brown! Down here!
- [Martin] Lady, please.

1106
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:33,468
- [Both Shouting]
- Oh, this is darling.

1107
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,937
- I'm gonna hurl!
- [Shouting]

1108
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,507
This will make some child very happy...
if he's got a buck or two.

1109
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,583
- Hey, Mrs. B. How are you?
- Hello, fellows.

1110
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,688
Zoot!
Blotz!

1111
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,957
My ship! Where's my ship?

1112
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,627
- We only have two hours before it explodes!
- I'll check upstairs.

1113
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,762
Hurry!
Zoot!

1114
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:03,965
Zoot?
Where are you?

1115
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,202
Blotz! You're not Zoot.
Where could he be?

1116
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,138
I'm not leaving this planet
without Zoot. Tim!

1117
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,807
Not upstairs.

1118
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,644
- What's a "rummaggie" sale?
- "Rummaggie" sale?

1119
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:19,080
R-- Rummaggie--
Rummage. Mrs. Brown.

1120
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,288
- [Tires Squealing]
- [Siren Wailing]

1121
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,657
- Looks like we got company.
- Blotz!

1122
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:32,160
It's them!
After them!

1123
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:37,799
- [Sirens Wailing] - Hang on.
- [Horns Honking]

1124
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,068
- Ooh.
- I repeat, Gilford and Third.

1125
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:44,306
Give me that thing.
I want a roadblock!

1126
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:48,710
- We're never gonna lose 'em!
- Can't you drive any faster, you pinhead?

1127
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,250
- Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
- [Martin] Maximum thrust!

1128
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,752
- What?
- Stand on it, Stan!

1129
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,489
- We're gonna crash!
- [Triggers Cocking]

1130
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:03,992
- I think not!
- [Device Beeps]

1131
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,896
[Tires Squealing]

1132
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,098
- [Tires Squealing]
- Aah!

1133
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,768
- Oh!
- Shoot it! Come on!

1134
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,239
- They're shooting at us!
- Duck in that garage.

1135
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,842
- What garage?
- There! - Hang on!

1136
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,579
[Both Screaming]

1137
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,816
Oh. Tim, why are we stopping?

1138
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,721
- [Car Ignition Grinding]
- They're right there.

1139
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:36,458
God!

1140
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,861
- Get me that thing over there!
We're gonna flush 'em out! - Yes, sir.

1141
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,397
- I dropped it!
- What? Dropped what?

1142
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:45,133
- My molecular compressor!
- Here.

1143
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,369
Use this.

1144
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:51,439
- This won't work!
- No, use it to find it.

1145
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,244
That'll do very nicely.
Now, get it in there!

1146
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,313
Uh! Uh!
Nuts!

1147
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,415
Ahh! I found it!

[Coleye]
We've got you now!

1149
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,054

[Shouting]

1152
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,572
- Faster. Faster.
- It's getting closer!

1153
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,276
- I'm going as fast as I can!
- That's not fast enough!

[Screaming]

1155
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,723
Martin! Martin, up ahead!
We're trapped! Quick, make us smaller.

1156
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:49,030
We're not gonna make it!

1157
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,933
Hang on!

1158
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:59,441
- Are we clear?
- [Martin] Whoa-ho, I think we did it!

1159
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:02,310

[Both Screaming]

1161
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:19,994
- Where the heck are we?
- [Man] Hey, Elma, where's my new Field and Stream?

1162
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:23,131
[Woman] It's in the bathroom,
right where you left it.

1163
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,700
Oh, yeah.
I see it now.

1164
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,670
By the way,
where's my tuna sandwich?

1165
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,973
- You want it in there?
- Ha-ha. Ohh!

1166
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,410
Why'd I eat that fourth burrito?
[Grunting]

1167
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:38,580
- Uh-oh.

Uh! Uh, uh, uh--
[Screaming]

1171
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,839
- Sorry, buddy.
- I'll get you, you son of a b--

1172
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:08,743
- No!
- Sir, the police just had a crank call.

1173
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,846
- A '62 Plymouth just came out of a toilet on Woodlawn.
- Aah!

1174
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,552
[Martin]
Stop! Pull over! Pull over!

1175
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,621
We need to talk!
Pull over!

- Where? Oh.

1178
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,761
- Get the alternator. I'll get the ship!
- Okay.

1179
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:31,132
Oh, my goodness! Martin!
What's wrong?

1180
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,234
Forgive me, Lorelei,
but this is urgent.

1181
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,737
- You have something I need desperately.
- Oh, wow.

1182
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:39,240
- Martin, don't say that unless you mean it.
- You don't know the half of it.

1183
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:44,445
- I'm from another world.
- Oh, well, I could have told you that.

1184
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,621
- [Grunts]
- Oh! Mmm!

1185
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,491
Mar-- Martin?

Martin, come on!

1187
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,631
When you look at the stars,
think of me.

1188
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,401
- Oh. [Giggles]
- [Barks]

1189
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:10,805
[Gasps]
Oh! Whew!

1190
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,441
Feelings for an Earth woman--
I've gotta get off this planet.

1191
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,510
I've got it!

1192
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:18,012
I don't have the right tools,
so I'm having trouble getting--

1193
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,749
Oh!
Or we could do it your way.

1194
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:25,286
But wait! This means your vehicle
will cease to function.

1195
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,989
I know how much it means to you.

1196
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,492
Well, that's too bad.
Just had the darn thing washed too.

1197
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,835
That's good!
That's--

1198
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,004
Martin? Martin?

1199
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,243
- [Coleye] Direct hit!
- Uncle Martin?

1200
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,658
[Tim]
Hey! Hey, what--

1201
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:07,328
Hey, you don't know what you're doing!
Hey, hey!

1202
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:12,066
Don't mess with that spaceship!
It's gonna explode!

1203
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,235
- Narrow the beam.
- Intensify.

[Lizzie Groaning]

1205
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,841

We're in here!
Stop it!

1207
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,046
- [Sobbing]
- We're gonna die.

1208
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,183
- Die? And I'm still virgin wool!
- It's okay.

1209
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,819
I'm scared! Hold me!
[Sobbing]

1210
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,888
Oh, this is nice.

1211
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,257
[Beeping]

1212
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:43,531
[Coleye]
Easy does it.

1213
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:46,501
Great.

1214
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:50,872
- Wow. Fascinating.
- [Woman] Doctor.

1215
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:53,374
It appears to be some sort of...

1216
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,010
biomechanical transmitting device.

1217
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,413
Doctor, there's some chewing gum
wedged back in his molar.

1218
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,182
Leave it!
Pestering me with Juicy Fruit!

1219
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,886
This guy's got a radio station
inside of his skull! Here.

1220
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:08,523
We'll put this under the electron
microscope later. Whoa-ho!

1221
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:12,260
Excellent.
Armitan's gonna be eating his words!

1222
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,897
Perfect ending
to an already perfect day.

1223
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:19,867
- He's a little pale. - I think he's having
a negative reaction to the tranquilizers.

1224
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,270
Well, two CCs of adrenaline, stat!

1225
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,273
- Doctor, I think we're losing him.
- [Yelling, Pounding]

1226
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,942

01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,813
- Get ready to try it again. This time, full power.
- He's pointing to something.

1228
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,883
- He's pointing to the thing.
- Pick it up. Pick--

1229
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,119
Pick it-- Yeah.
No. No, no, no.

1230
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,555
No, that one. That one.

1231

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

- Tim!
- Oh!

1238
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:12,253
All right, back off, Gomer.
Hey.

Give me that, dipstick!

1240
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,357
You get Tim.
I'll scare the locals.

[Shouts]

1242
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,528

01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,030
- [All Shouting]
- Nobody will take on the suit!

1244
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,600
My zipper is stuck,
and I'm mad as hell!

1245
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,436
- Lizzie, what--
- Tim! Oh, are you okay?

1246
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,872
- Fine, fine. Are you okay?

- Yeah.

1248
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:38,179

Back off!
You heard me.

1250
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,818
You don't understand. That spaceship's
gonna explode in 20 minutes.

1251
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,587
- It is?
- On the floor. Now.

1252
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,324
Excuse me.
Arnold, Jean-Claude?

1253

[Shouts]
Not working. Oh.

1254
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:56,664
- It's an empty suit.
- Empty suit?

1255
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,901
Now you've done it, Grasshopper.
Whoo-aah!

Did you do something with your hair?

Glad you noticed.

- We're too late.
- [Zoot] No, hurry!

1301
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:15,329
- [Man] Would you like me to do the autopsy, Doctor?
- Are you insane?

1302
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,898
- You get out of here! Get out!
- All right. All right.

1303
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,534
All of you idiots, you get out.
You get out.

1304
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,237
- I'm goin'!
- You get right out. Clowns!

1305
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,406
Come on.

1306
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:30,511
Okay, my sorry little Martian.

1307
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,681
Have it your way.

1308
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,550
Let's open you up.

1309
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:40,955
- [Lizzie] Assistance, Doctor?
- What? No! You--

1310
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,524
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not--

1311
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:46,193
- She came with me.
- Oh. - Clear.

1312
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,929
[Electricity Zapping]

1313
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,766
[Moans]

1314
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:59,373
[Zoot's Voice]
Must... be together.

1315
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:21,062
Zoot!

1316
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,910
- [Gasps]
- Martin?

1317
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:42,349
- Martin!
- [Groans] Tim! Lizzie!

1318
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:45,252
- You're-- You're--
- [Zoot] Breathin', baby! I still got the touch.

1319
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,089
Oh, you beauteous bathrobe!
[Laughs]

1320
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,291
- Martin--
- Let's see cotton do that, huh? Easy.

1321
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:53,294
- I got an image!
- [Martin] Okay, okay.

1322
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,362
Martin! Martin!

1323
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,499
- We don't have much time.
- Blotz!

1324
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,268
- [Man, Over Loudspeaker] Shut down
and monitor all exits. - [Sirens Wailing]

1325
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,604
[Men Chattering, Indistinct]

1326
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,607
[Woman, Over Loudspeaker]
All units stand by for total lockup.

1327
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,611
- Martin, can you get the lock?
- I think so.

1328
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,415
- [Electricity Humming]
- Come on!

1329
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:19,286
- [Man, Over Loudspeaker] Biotech units on alert.
- [Siren Wailing]

1330
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:22,323
[Woman, Over Loudspeaker]
All non-security personnel...

1331
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:25,359
- are to report to their holding areas.
- Come on. Stay down!

1332
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:29,130
- Stay down.
- Here's a place!

1333
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:31,398
All right.
Stand back, you two.

1334
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,567
[Device Beeping]

1335
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:44,145
- [Siren Wailing]
- What's going on? Where's the alien?

1336
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:47,314
- There's been a slight problem.
- Open that gate. Let's find Dr Coleye.

1337
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,250
- Yes, sir, yes, sir. Right away.
- Come on!

1338
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,252
Let 'em through!

1339
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,655
Here.

1340
01:19:57,225 --> 01:20:00,094
There. [Grunts]
Contact.

1341
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,997
There.
I think that's going to work.

1342
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,667
I'm gonna miss you, Martin.

1343
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:10,871
- [Zoot Giggles] - You too, Zoot.
- You're so full of starch!

1344
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:13,574
Hey, let 'em know how you feel!
[Chuckles]

1345
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,676
You're the best pet I ever had!

1346
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:18,012
Stop being such a baby blanket!

1347
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,948
[Mutters]

1348
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:23,617
Lizzie, my dear friend.

1349
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,788
Take care, Uncle Martin.

1350
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:34,628
I've done that before. It's very nice.
I highly recommend it.

1351
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:40,467
Good luck, you two.

1352
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,908
Something tells me
you're gonna miss your flight!

1353
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:51,111
- Then in two minutes, we all die.
- You're lying.

1354
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,949
Are you certain about that, Coleye?

1355
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,985
- Because I'm not.
- What are you saying?

1356
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:01,288
- Release him.
- Release him?

1357
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:04,992
I have spent an entire career
trying to prove that aliens exist.

1358
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,395
Now he's my proof!

1359
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:10,564
Dead or alive,
he's staying with me!

1360
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,433
Oh. Ohh! Ohh!

1361
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,935
Whoa! Aah!

1362
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:18,439
- Martin?
- I don't understand! I-- I--

1363
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:22,142
Coleye, you always were a little blotz.

1364
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,646
- [Coleye] What?
- Neenurt!

1365
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:29,416
Ha ha ha! I haven't heard that name
in a long time.

1366
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:33,854
- Pronounced properly, anyway.
- You mean it was you all along?

1367
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:39,159
I can't believe this!
I should have known! You're a Martian?

1368
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,295
I was--
Uhh! Aah!

1369
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:44,164
[Screaming]

1370
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,675
Waaah!
[Grunting]

1371
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:58,545
- [Chuckling]
- Wait. You're the one I saw at the pier.

1372
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,281
I was trying to get to you
before they did.

1373
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:03,317
I've been trying
to hitch a ride home for 30 years!

1374
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,820
What a beauty!
Oh, by the way,

1375
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:09,223
I believe these belong to you.

1376
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,126
[Gasps]
My antennae.

1377
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:15,663
I can't go home without these. I have a
hard enough time getting dates as it is.

1378
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,700
Mine's always giving me trouble too.
And everything's in black and white.

1379
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:23,137
- [Groaning]
- And those commercials-- "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz"--

1380
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:26,740
That gum lost its flavour in '66.

1381
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:29,710
All right. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

1382
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,913
- Got to go. Farewell.
- Come back for a visit sometime.

1383
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:35,649
Maybe.

1384
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:38,719
I'm beginning to see a glimmer
of potential among you Earthlings.

1385
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,656
One word of advice: You'll never
completely advance as a culture...

1386
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:46,560
until you take care of your oceans
and do away with daytime talk shows.

1387
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:51,198
Goodbye, you crazy lovebirds!

1388
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:54,068
Ah, stop being such
a hysterical housecoat.

1389
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:59,573
- See ya, Zoot.
- Rollin', rollin', rollin' Keep them doggies rollin'

1390
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:04,611
[Growling]
Aliens!

1391
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,285
Wait! No!

1392
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:13,554
Please! No! You can't!

1393
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:16,457
Don't go! Come back!

1394
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:20,194
No-o-o!

1395
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,896
[Growls]

1396
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:24,264
Aah!

1397
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,633
What the--
Eeew!

1398
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:30,204
Gum. Gum!

1399
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:33,574
Wait, this is the alien gum!
Yes!

1400
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,876
Wait, wait.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1401
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:39,179
Well, you're not me, are ya?
[Laughs]

1402
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,983
I can learn more about them...

1403
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:45,285
from their leftover--

1404
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,488
Wha--
That's brilliant!

1405
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:50,124
I can feel every molecule of my body...

1406
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,292
starting to change!

1407
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,496
[Laughing]

1408
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,033
Aah!

1409
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,503
Oh, no.

1410
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:09,009
Hold it! Don't move!

1411
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:12,413
- No!
- Stop! Don't shoot! Get the tranquillizer gun.

1412
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,982
No, not that, you idiots!

1413
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,485
- I'm not a Martian.
- We got him, boys. Get the tranquillizer gun.

1414
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,788
We've got one--
a real live Martian!

1415
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:24,992
It's me. Coleye. No! No!

1416
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,361
Aah!

1417
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,197
[Man]
The truth is out there!

1418
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:33,834
We are not leaving until they
listen to us! We've got proof!

1419
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:37,104
I saw one!
He cloned my body!

1420
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:39,106
He could be anywhere by now!

1421
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,608
The truth is out there!

1422
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:43,677
The truth is out there!

1423
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,147
So that's the story here
from Santa Barbara City Hall.

1424
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:50,284
- I'm Bill Randall, KGSC.
- [Crowd Chanting] The truth, the truth,

1425
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:53,053
the truth, the truth, the truth!

1426
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,289
It's all I--

1427
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:03,730
- Hey, sleepy. Brought you some tea.
- [Chuckles]

1428
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:11,338
Listen, I've been thinking. Now that
I really know what happened between us,

1429
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:14,641
I think maybe we should just go back
to the way things used to be.

1430
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:18,312
- Mmm.
- Our friendship really does mean a lot to me.

1431
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:21,915
Yeah, well, I've been thinking too,
and, uh,

1432
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:24,318
I think I've got enough friends.

1433
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,792
[Whooshing Sound]

1434
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,744
[Rattling]

1435
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:55,616
- [Hissing] - One giant leap for man,
one step backward for Martians.

1436
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:59,019
- Zoot?
- Hey, Tim, Lizzie! We're back!

1437
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:02,856
- [Chuckles]
- Zoot-- [Grunts]

1438
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:06,126
Oh! Geez!
Call a skycap, for cryin' out loud.

1439
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,395
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1440
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:11,698
We've decided to stay here with you.

1441
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:15,636
- Y-You what?
- I kept thinking how lonely I was gonna be without you.

1442
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:17,871
And since you said
you were gonna miss me,

1443
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:21,441
I thought I'd save us both
the heartache of separation.

1444
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,610
Ya-hah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1445
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:28,482
B-B-B-But, Martin, I can't miss you
if you don't go!

1446
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:32,085
Exactly!
Isn't it wonderful?

1447
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:35,556
Farewell, Neenurt!

1448
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:38,125
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where's he going?

1449
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,894
To Mars, of course!

1450
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:44,364
[Whooshing]

1451
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,635
- Whoo! [Chuckling]
- Wh--

1452
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,338
Martin. Martin.
What are you doing?

1453
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:54,975
Tim, since we'll be living together,
let's do something about this furniture.

1454
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,678
- Living together? What do you mean--
- I say we get rid of this couch,

1455
01:26:57,745 --> 01:27:01,248
and buy a hyperbolic resting chamber
like normal beings have.

1456
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:04,017
- No! No! You're not staying here.
- Hey, who wants ice cream?

1457
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:07,087
- [Chuckles]
- Tonight I'm craving praline swirl.

1458
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:09,289
- Martin-- You think this is funny?
- [Chuckling]

1459
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,291
You haven't seen him eat ice cream.
It's not pretty!

1460
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,995
Rocky road! Rocky road! Rocky road!
[Shouts]

1461
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,197
- Martin, you can't-- He doesn't sleep.
