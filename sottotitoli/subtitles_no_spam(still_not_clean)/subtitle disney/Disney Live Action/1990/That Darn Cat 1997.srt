00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,991
<i>That darn cat</i>

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,831
<i>That darn cat</i>

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,511
<i>That darn cat</i>

00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,311
<i>That darn cat</i>

00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,991
<i>That darn cat</i>

00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,956
<i>That darn cat</i>

8
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,551
<i>Adios, amigo</i>

9
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,830
Oh, no.

10
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,229
Some of our investments
are plummeting.

11
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,555
Why can't your plastic surgeon
give the stock market a lift?

12
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,391
Oh, no.

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,278
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

14
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,750
Dear Lord, no, no, no, no, no.
That's--

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,671
Oh, my God!

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,355
- What?
- I think I found another line, is what!

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,353
I can't believe this.
This is horrible!

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,830
I'll tell you what's horrible.
Even pork bellies are sagging.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,751
Oh! Nope, nope, nope.

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,115
It's just a little eyelash
on the mirror!

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,077
Never mind.

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,276
Never mind, never mind.

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,559
Lizzy, bring me two aspirin
and some warm milk.

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,915
Anything you say, Mr Flint.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,355
- You want somethin'?
- I want...

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,228
four dozen Ding Dongs
and a giant Ho Ho.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,311
Bring Mrs Flint two carrot
sticks and a mushroom.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,912
What would they do
without me?

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,831
<i>Is that her?</i>

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,990
<i>Wow. she's an ugly old broad
isn't she?</i>

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,719
<i>You'd think with all her millions,
she could afford a plastic surgeon.</i>

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,631
<i>Rich people are nuts.</i>

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,188
<i>Let's be one of 'em.</i>

34
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,591
Who is it?

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,596
I know karate.

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,434
<i>Lizzy are you milking the cow?
Mulcer's doing a tango up here</i>

37
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,354
"Cheerful faces.
Smiling hellos.

38
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,113
"Neighbours who don't knock
when they come over!

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,158
"The kind of town that has
a really nice feed store.

40
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,151
"Everyone says,
'Have a nice day' still.

41
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,071
"Hot dogs.

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,197

48
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,151
What's a hoedown?

49
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,231
- Sounds like yard work.
- Seriously.

50
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,151
"It's as if this town
has the power!..

51

- "To suck the very brain right out of your head.
- Patti--

52
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,350
- And with some people, you wouldn't even notice."
- Patti!

53
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,955
The assignment was to give
a report on town pride.

54
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,838
There must be
something here you like.

55
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,756
"I like my cat.
The end."

56
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,236
Hey, DC.

57
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,869
Come to walk
me home? Huh?

58
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,279
Patti, honey.

59
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,273
DC, I told you to leave
the mother at home.

60
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,394
<i>- I see you</i>
- Don't look at her!

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,234
Maybe if we ignore her,
she'll go away.

62
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,629
I know it's not cool
to let your mommy pick you up...

63
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,315
but the town council meeting
let out early and-- Oh, Christmas.

64
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,551
Honey, why do you
always wear black?

65
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,110
Because it matches my soul.

66
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,192
Well, it doesn't do much
for your eye colour!

67
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,157
- So how was your day?
- Mind-numbing as usual.

68
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,390
Mom, can we please
move to Boston?

69
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,278
Now, sweetie, I think that you  just
don't take advantage...

70
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,238
of all the wonderful things
that this town has to offer you.

71
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,629
- Like what?
- Well, I don't know.

72
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,757
But when I was in high school,
we kids just had so much fun.

73
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,231
I was in glee club
and spirit association.

74
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,517
Why don’t you go out
for cheerleading?

75
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,718
Oh, my goodness, look.
Fish sticks for dinner!

76
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,710
DC!

77
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,789
That cat
is a delinquent!

78
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,748
Uh,just lemme get
these lug nuts off.

79
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,831
Ever wonder where the expression
"big lug" came from?

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,751
How long will
it take, Dusty?

81
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,798
Oh, about 15
or 20 minutes, Mrs Randall.

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,677
- Is that all?
- Twenty minutes?

83
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,320
My grandmother could do it
faster than that.

84
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,789
She's got replacement hips.
I'll do it in ten.

85
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,314
Oh,yeah? Well,
I'll do it in nine.

86
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,551
Eight and
a ten-percent discount!

87
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,154
- Twelve and a free battery charge!
- Seven...

88
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,438
Fifteen percent off, free oil
changes for a year and free gum!

89
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,715
- Now top that, doofus!
- Doofus, huh?

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,553
- Ooh.
- I'll doofus you, buddy boy.

91
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,200
So you heard nothing?

92
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,034
Oh, my wife keeps a tape of jungle
noises going in the bedroom at night.

93
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,873
It's like a Tarzan
movie in there.

94
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,918
Lizzy polished the pygmies' pot
so beautifully.

95
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,719
I'm so upset, I'd-I'd cry. But my tear ducts
haven’t worked since my last eye job.

96
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,758
We'll try to find Lizzy
as soon as we can, Mrs Flint.

97
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,876
Oh, it's so important.
You really have to f--

98
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,428
Do you know what it is
that baffles me? I-I-I--

99
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,318
How could anyone
mistake Lizzy for me?

100
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,868
You know, I mean, we're both
thin and hopefully pretty.

101
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,715
But I spent a quarter
of a million dollars to look like this.

102
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,279
Excuse me.

103
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,915
Captain? Captain!

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,831
Captain.

105
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,196
I been collectin' hair and lint samples
from the Flint's bedroom.

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,078
Uh-huh.

107
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,357
Uh, Kelso,you know that the--
the kidnapping happened...

108
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,431
- downstairs in the kitchen, right?
- Yes, I know this.

109
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,478
And the Flints were in the bedroom
at the time of the crime.

110
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,915
- Now you're with me here?
- Uh-huh, 100 percent.

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,912
Okay, don’t you think that
the really good clues...

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,152
would come from, oh, say, the place
where the crime was committed?

113
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,075
Unless, of course, the crime
did not happen in the alleged kitchen.

114
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,991
The kitchen is there.

115
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,959
It's not alleged.
It exists. We have proof.

116
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,838
Captain,
these people are liars.

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,797
Now, how
do we know that?

118
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,917
S-See that lady over there?

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,390
She told me she was 39.
I'm tellin' you, cover-up.

120
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,194
Okay, Zeke.

121
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,678
Here’s what I want you to do.

122
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,716
Walk into the kitchen...

123
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,635
grab some coffee
and bring it to me.

124
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,915
Good. Then what?

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,551
Then get some cream.

126
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,914
Y-You're not serious,
are you, s--

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,831
I like my cream.

128
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,791
I'm watchin' you.

129
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,235
Oh, thank you.

130
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,275
- Yoo-hoo, Mrs Randall!
- Hello there!

131
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,432
Hi, Patti!

132
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,670
The Candy Cane, where
young Edgefelders go...

133
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,751
to get a sugar buzz
and then go day-tripping.

134
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,310
Oh, Patti,you
are so dramatic.

135
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,550
- Streets look clear!
- Mm-hmm.

136
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,995
Quiet day.

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,231
Yeah. Quiet can be
misleading, Melvin.

138
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,949
- Quiet does not necessarily mean safe.
- Yep.

139
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,917
Yeah.

140
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,358
There! You see what I mean?
That's a 524 right there.

141
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,271
Girl in street chasing cat.

142
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,715
Drive, Melvin. Drive like
you've never driven before. Drive!

143
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,394
Don't hit the girl.
Don't hit the girl or the cat.

144
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,756
Oh, honey! Lord in heaven,
you could've been injured!

145
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,115
- Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?
- No.

146
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,031
How's DC?

147
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,032
Well, he's got fleas. But I think
he had those before you got here.

148
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,353
Well,you ladies
have a good day now.

149
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,715
We will, thank you.
Goodbye, boys. Patti!

150
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,030
- Bye.
- Those are such nice boys.

151
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,918
Sure wish we could do
somethin' about those fleas.

152
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,275
We're just men, Melvin.

153
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,839
Not gods.

154
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,797
- Let's go.
- Ow.

155
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,199
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

156
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,475
Mom, eyes forward,
head straight. Don't look up.

157
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,391
- Patti, where are your manners?
- Who's down there?

158
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,311
Hello, Mrs McCracken.

159
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,356
- Hi.
- Now I'll never get out of here.

160
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,591
- Who's that with ya?
- That's Patti.

161
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,830
Patti? Who's Patti?

162
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,751
I'm her daughter!

163
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,876
Um,you've only known me 16years.

164
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,872
It'd help if ya dressed in colour!

165
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,752
DC, it's not time for dinner!
Get over here.

166
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,400
What's that, Tweety?

167
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,075
Ah! Tweety says hello!

168
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,276
Look, Mom,
the bird talks.

169
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,511
Oh, Patti, sometimes I wonder who snuck in
in the middle of the night and raised you.

170
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,194
Mrs McCracken, could we get you
anything at the butcher's?

171
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,113
I could use half a pound
of ground chuck.

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,589
All right. Bye-bye.

173
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,113
Thank you very much!

174
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,398
Why is it so painfully hard
for you to be nice?

175
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,233
I think you wound up with all
the "nice" in the family, Mom.

176
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,869
I swear, Patti,you can be
such a pain in the--

177
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,188
- Say it.
- No.

178
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,670
- Oh, come on, Mom. Say it.
- You will not make me swear!

179
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,069
You will not make me swear!

180
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,108
Yeah, I know.

181
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,513
She's a hard one to crack.

182
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,477
Yoo-hoo, Lu!

183
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,630
Hello, Mrs Randall, Patti.

184
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,029
Hey, now,you've done something
new with your hair!

185
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,157
- Oh, it's a bun.
- Turn around.

186
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,276
Oh, I think that is nifty.

187
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,351
- Very becoming.
- Thanks.

188
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,398
Well, I need half a pound of
ground chuck and a watermelon rose.

189
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,234
- Okay, Mrs Randall.
- Did you do this?

190
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,309
Yes.

191
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,198
Lu, that’s wonderful.
You’re very talented.

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,874
Thanks. Yeah, I once built
a castle out of Spam.

193
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,748
- No.
- Yeah. Had a spiral staircase up to the turret.

194
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,671
Really? Oh, wow.

195
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,955
Hey,you know,
if you are free on Saturday...

196
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,794
you really should come
to our annual cat show.

197
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,996
There'll be a lot
of eligible men there.

198
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,469
Oh, I don't know.
Saturday's my big TV night.

199
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,313
Well, try, okay?
Because it is gonna be fun.

200
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,277
Our head judge this year!..

201
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,351
Has the cat food with
the dancing cats on the label.

202
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,590
You know-- Chow, chow, chow.

203
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,399
I am not exaggerating.
It is gonna be an extravaganza.

204
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,358
Ooh, an extravaganza
in Edgefeld.

205
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,159
Patti, shush.
Teenagers.

206
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,949
Just put that
on my tab, okay? Thanks, Lu.

207
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,792
Oh, DC!

208
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,629
I don't know what to do
with her, Peter!

209
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,632
She refuses to even
try to get along with people.

210
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,154
Well, I say we sell her,
get enough to cover that orthodontia.

211
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,236
- I am serious,you.
- Ow.

212
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,675
Honey, there are two...

213
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,638
very important things
lacking in your personality:

214
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,631
- tolerance and empathy.
- Hmm.

215
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,395
Now,you showed an awful lot
of disrespect for Lu today.

216
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,916
- I was just agreeing with her!
- She is a sweet gal.

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,151
And she takes her work
very seriously.

218
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,470
Mom, she moulds meat.

219
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,954
You push me,young lady. And you
enjoy it. Admit it. You enjoy it.

220
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,318
- Oh, no. I derive no joy from it.
- Um, ladies--

221
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,551
<i>Despite the maid's
net worth of$2388..</i>

222
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,677
<i>the kidnappers are demanding
one million in ransom.</i>

223
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,558
<i>Boston police
have brought in the FBI</i>

224
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,837
<i>- So far there've been no leads But Boston police--</i>
- Boston?

225
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,514
It's always Boston. Why can't
anything like that ever happen here?

226
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,556
<i>...quick apprehension
of the perpetrators</i>

227
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,758
<i>This is of course the same Chief
Fitzwilliams who expressed optimism...</i>

228
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,273
<i>for the quick apprehension
of the perpetrators..</i>

229
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,638
<i>of most of Boston's crimes
in the past year.</i>

230
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,757
There he goes,
just like clockwork.

231
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,513
Why do you think he leaves
here every night at 8.00?

232
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,511
- Because he can.
<i>- Fitzwilliams swears it will be different.</i>

233
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,319
And we at Channel 11
support him.

234
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,158
This will teach ya
to steal my customers.

235
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,310
Doofus!

236
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,273
<i>Quiet night.</i>

237
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,271
Whoa! Did you see that?

238
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,238
No, I didn't!
Don't get involved.Just drive!

239
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,470
That guy needs new tires.

240
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,600
- <i>Ooh</i>
- <i>What you want</i>

241
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,989
- <i>Baby I got it</i>
- <i>Ooh</i>

242
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,833
<i>What you need
Do you know I got it</i>

243
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,273
- <i>Ooh</i>
<i>- All--</i>

244
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,794
Yes.

245
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,792
Come here, kitty. Come here.

246
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,757
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

247
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,354
Come to Mama. Come on.

248
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,396
Come on!
Good boy.

249
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,078
Run along.

250
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,595
Oop, 7.20. Better get down
to the bookstore.

251
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,989
- A new Danielle Steel coming in today.
- Whoo.

252
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,071
- I wonder if it'll be a romance.
- Hmm.

253
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,469
I'd read it myself, but
the TV movie's always better!

254
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,710
- Bye-bye, honey.
- Bye.

255
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,598
Honey, would you pass me
the front page, please?

256
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,870
Thank you.

257
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,157
Hey, DC, what ya got there?
What is this?

258
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,599
- How weird.
- Hmm?

259
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,511
Mom, read this.

260
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,600
You will not make me swear,
young lady.

261
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,389
I was not trying to make you swear, Mom.
DC was wearing this.

262
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,393
That's ridiculous. Why would
anybody give a watch to a cat?

263
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,876
This looks
like the same Timex.

264
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,111
- Honey, would you pass me the margarine, please?
- Oh, my God.

265
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,714
- I know who gave DC the watch.
- Who?

266
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,631
Her.

267
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,031
Hillary Clinton?

268
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,951
No, Mom.
Below the fold.

269
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,636
See? That's the maid
that got snagged.

270
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,597
I'm telling you,
it's the same watch.

271
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,511
Yes, but honey,
it's a Timex.

272
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,909
Thousands of people
wear that watch.

273
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,959
DC, do you know
this person?

274
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,555
See?

275
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,118
DC, do you know
this person?

276
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,668
That's totally not fair!

277
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,830
Drink up your juice.
It's good for your skin.

278
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,719
As you can see, we've isolated
a partial fingerprint.

279
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,156
But it's not enough
to identify the kidnappers.

280
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,674
- Oh.
- Now, sir, before we proceed...

281
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,914
we need to be clear on one thing:
are you prepared to pay the ransom?

282
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,197
Um, look, I-I have to be
blunt right here.

283
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,511
You see, I-I love Lizzy
like a member of my family.

284
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,513
But there is a problem.
Now s-some-- Uh, I--

285
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,871
I'm fat broke.

286
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,031
You’re what?

287
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,270
I'm sorry, sweet cakes.
We're broke.

288
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,191
What?

289
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,717
We're broke. It was the stinkin' '80s.
The stock market was calling to me.

290
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,190
I-I made time like
a drunken sailor on leave.

291
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,716
I jumped in bed with
every leveraged buyout,junk bond...

292
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,631
rumoured corporate
takeover there was.

293
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,474
Right now
I'm $17 million in debt.

294
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,710
- Seven--
- I wouldn't be able to raise 50 bucks..

295
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,555
Even if they
had kidnapped my wife.

296
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,596
So much for Plan A.

297
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,718
The only thing I don't understand is why
her watch says "hell."

298
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,998
Oh, Patti, please. I can't
take any more of this.

299
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,039
<i>- Help me Rhonda, help me get her outta my heart</i>
- Okay, so I'm kidnapped.

300
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,395
I'm trying to get a message
to the outside world.

301
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,391
- And I write--
- <i>Help me Rhonda</i>

302
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,429
<i>Help, help me Rhonda Help me
Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda</i>

303
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,433
- Help. Duh, I write help.
- <i>Help me Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda</i>

304
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,239
- <i>Help me Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda</i>
- <i>God I'm really good</i>

305
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,676
Those <i>Charlie's Angels</i> reruns
are really starting to pay off.

306
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,558
Oh, Patricia, please.

307
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,757
- <i>Help me Rhonda,yeah Get her outta my heart</i>
- What?

308
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,310
You're trying to tell me that your cat
walked 60 miles to Boston...

309
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,790
bumped into the kidnappers, got
the watch and came all the way home...

310
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,711
on the same night?

311
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,439
- Isn't he amazing?
- And you are basing this entire theory...

312
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,318
on the fact that a part-time
alley cat came home...

313
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,391
with a watch that says
"hell" on the back.

314
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,675
<i>- Rhonda,you caught my eye</i>
- What did you say?

315
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,797
<i>And l can give you
lots of reasons why</i>

316
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,950
- <i>You've gotta help me Rhonda</i>
- Nothing.

317
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,235
- <i>Help me get her outta my heart</i>
- You said, "hell." I heard you.

318
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,108
- I did not. I did not.
- You did too. Oh, Mom, I'm so proud of you.

319
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,998
Listen,you just forget
about that watch, okay?

320
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,911
It is your job
to be a student.

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,639
Let's let the policemen
solve the crime, okay?

322
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,874
<i>Help, help me Rhonda Help me
Rhonda Help, help me Rhonda</i>

323
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,157
<i>Help me Rhonda
Help, help me Rhonda</i>

324
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,198
<i>Help me Rhonda
Help, help me Rhonda</i>

325
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,191
<i>Help me Rhonda
Yeah</i>

326
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,748
<i>Get her outta my heart</i>

327
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,233
My cat saw
something, okay?

328
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,151
Hey, I've got
proof!

329
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,357
Look, the kidnapping
took place in Boston. This is Edgefeld.

330
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,271
So obviously
their hideout is here.

331
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,828
That's absurd. Why
would the kidnappers do that?

332
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,435
Because they know
the local police are idiots!

333
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,670
- Teenagers. Come on.
- I know.

334
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,233
- Grandma, I feel sick.
- Ohh.

335
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,231
Can I have a Big Mac
on the way home?

336
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,151
Sure, honey.

337
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,839
Is anyone here?

338
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,878
Why aren't you at school
gettin' an education, Patti?

339
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,155
Because I'd rather
be getting cavities.

340
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,232
Could I have a chocolate soda, please? And
DC here will have a dish of whipped cream.

341
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,478
Nice outfit.
Going to a funeral?

342
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,790
Yeah. My youthful
enthusiasm just died.

343
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,075
Aww. Why so glum, chum?

344
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,958
Oh, I'm sick of being ignored.

345
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,430
Now, actually, it can be a blessing
not to be noticed, honey.

346
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,875
Not when you want
to be noticed.

347
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,997
And I'm tired of living
in a town that gets excited...

348
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,117
-when a new stoplight is installed.
- There's a new stoplight?

349
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,317
A couple of years,
you can leave old Edgefeld.

350
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,868
Yeah. I live for that day.

351
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,633
But unfortunately I'm stuck here
for the foreseeable future.

352
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,474
- Just like us.
- You guys feel stuck too?

353
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,630
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll be okay.

354
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,274
Yeah. So will I.

355
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,188
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

356
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,475
But I've got a little girl
outside who claims...

357
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,313
that her cat witnessed
the kidnapping.

358
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,520
I'd love to talk to her, but a couple of
dogs have already come forward on that one.

359
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,038
Yes, sir! Um, she would, uh,
like to file a report.

360
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,672
- So?
- I-I'm up to my neck. Please.

361
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,718
- You?
- Please, I've got--

362
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,792
- All right. Dismissed.
- Thank you.

363
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,478
- I'm Patti Randall.
- Hello, Miss Randall.

364
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,120
How are you? Nice to meet you.
Please, uh, have a seat.

365
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,999
- You can call me Zeke.
- That's some picture you got there.

366
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,915
Oh,yeah, that's my father! He was
an FBI agent under J Edgar Hoover!

367
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,592
He looks really serious.

368
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,638
He never laughed one time
in his entire life.

369
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,759
Unless, of course,
it was an order!

370
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,673
He must've been, um,
a real fun guy.

371
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,672
They used to call him
the 24-Hour Man because, uh...

372
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,274
there wasn’t a case that he
couldn't solve in less than 24 hours.

373
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,591
That's amazing.
How long does it take you?

374
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,478
So, Miss Randall, I understand
that you witnessed the Flint kidnapping?

375
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,269
Oh, well, uh, I didn't
witness it, actually.

376
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,114
Um, DC sort of
stumbled onto it.

377
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,478
- Where's DC?
- At home, uh, sleeping.

378
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,551
Well, how come
he didn't come with you?

379
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,791
Well, I wasn't sure
if you allowed pets in the building.

380
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,990
He's a cat.
It's-It's-- He's my cat.

381
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,355
As in--As in
Morris the--

382
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,271
Yeah.

383
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,636
- DC's actually a big fan.
- This is real funny.

384
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,110
Ha, ha, ha!
Joke's on me, boys! Ha, ha!

385
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,270
Send Zeke
the kid with the cat!

386
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,875
I bust my butt to be taken seriously
in this place. This is how you treat me?

387
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,428
And in front of my father,
no less!

388
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,590
Agent Kelso, my cat
did see something, okay?

389
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,319
I'd appreciate it if you'd
try to take this seriously.

390
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,516
You know,you-you send me
a-a-a-a witness...

391
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,239
that doesn't have four legs
and use a sandbox, and I'll go to work.

392
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,629
Look, this is what I got
off my cat, okay?

393
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,110
Look it, see, it says, "help"
on the back. I think it's from her!

394
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,031
Okay.

395
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,509
I-I-I know this looks
a little odd,you know--

396
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,398
Odd? It sounds like you’re 12 short
of a dozen, Kelso.

397
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,233
- It's not even a hunch.
- It's more than a hunch.

398
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,836
Look, I-- I checked this, uh-- this
sales record for this Model 705 Timex.

399
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,399
Now, this was
a promotional line...

400
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,710
meaning there were only a couple
sold in the Boston area.

401
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,712
I checked with the Flints. They
bought one for their maid for Christmas.

402
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,631
I mean, it's a genuine
gut instinct!

403
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,633
Well, far be it from me to
interfere with a gut instinct.

404
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,233
Zeke...

405
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,197
go tail the cat.

406
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,350
Good one. Good one, sir!
Good one.

407
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,069
Oh, oh, I'm gonna need
a team for this one. Mm-hmm.

408
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,119
- A team?
- Please?

409
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,875
- Pretty please?
- Okay.

410
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,996
Take four men,
one evening.

411
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,719
But you better come back
with more than a whisker!

412
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,837
Another good one, sir! Thank you, sir!
I could-- I could kiss you, sir!

413
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,311
You could.
But I wouldn't recommend it.

414
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,437
Kiss me.

415
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,715
Cats.

416
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,354
Hey.

417
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,754
Hey!

418
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,432
Now, this is going too far!

419
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,309
So every night at 8.00,
the cat goes out.

420
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,549
Yep.

421
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,758
- Hmm. Well, then, I'll be over at 7.00.
- Pretty nifty wheels.

422
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,276
Not every day you see a car with
shag carpeting and a bobbing dog head.

423
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,114
- Thanks. I did it myself.
- Never would have guessed.

424
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,435
- Two chocolate sodas.
- Thank you.

425
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,397
Don't drink'em too fast.
Your head'll freeze.

426
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,990
Uh, here we go, Pa.
The afternoon rush.

427
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,197
- Patti! What are you up to?
- Nothing. I'm not up to anything.

428
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,158
- I just came to see you.
- Okay, thank you.

429
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,518
I did. Can't I miss
my mom and dad?

430
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,670
- Mom, come on.
- Patti, what’s wrong?

431
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,910
Nothing.

432
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,309
She just came to say hi.

433
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,473
Actually, I came
to surprise you guys.

434
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,428
Two tickets to C-- <i>Cats.</i>

435
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,034
Oh, honey, look.

436
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,351
The Community College Road Company
at the Oaken Bucket Dinner Theater!

437
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,557
Oh!

438
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,757
Well, I know I've been kind of a pain
lately, so I wanted to make it up to you.

439
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,750
Ohh!

440
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,229
So this is for tonight.
There's dinner with the show.

441
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,312
All the prime rib
you can eat, so go.

442
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,311
- Ohh!
- Thank you, honey!

443
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,716
Ah, what a little gal.

444
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,711
She is gonna be okay.

445
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,996
First thing I have to do
is photograph the witness.

446
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,593
- Hey!
- Oh, be careful. He scratches.

447
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,115
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm allergic.

448
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,953
Could you just put him
on the table, please?

449
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,794
Okay, but usually we yell at him
when he gets on the table.

450
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,991
Hey, what's that?

451
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,276
A clue. It's a twig,
but it's a clue.

452
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,430
It's red, and it's sticky.

453
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,750
- Maybe blood.
- Blood.

454
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,549
I need to bag this, label this and catalogue this.
Do you have a bag and a label?

455
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,596
I have Saran Wrap
and masking tape.

456
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,514
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

457
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,794
Who's that?

458
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,429
- It's my team.
- You have a team?

459
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,590
Of course I have a team.

460
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,636
Every agent
has a team.

461
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,519
- What's the point?
- I’d just be happy to get home early tonight.

462
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,630
Gentlemen!

463
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,870
Tonight you’ll be tailing informant X. And
I hope that leads us to the kidnappers.

464
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,758
Now it's important that informant X
not be aware of your presence.

465
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,072
He’s very--very skittish.
Here are his stats.

466
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,990
Eyes: light brown.

467
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,833
Hair: grey.

468
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,674
- Weight: ten pounds.
- Ten pounds?

469
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,955
- He's a cat.
- Aw, come on, man. What's the joke?

470
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,554
- What?
- He's a cat?

471
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,234
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay!

472
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,836
I will coordinate all activities here at
command central. That's the cat's home.

473
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,036
Cat-quarters.

474
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,396
- Come on,y'all, this is serious.
- Zeke.

475
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,391
It's a cat.

476
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,429
Come on, come on!
This is serious!

477
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,311
This is Kelso.
Does everybody read?

478
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,439
- Blue team in position.
- Tabby patrol in position.

479
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,432
Red team in position.

480
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,397
<i>Sorry, man.
Just coughed up a hairball.</i>

481
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,189
They're good men, my team.
Excellent senses of humour!

482
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,748
I-It helps
to ease the tension.

483
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,990
How'd it get so cold
all of a sudden?

484
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,193
Stand by! Informant X
is leaving the house!

485
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,310
Weird.

486
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,074
What's the deal?

487
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,277
Why isn't he moving?
He's supposed to be moving.

488
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,757
Okay. Go!

489
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,429
Hit the road.

490
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,235
He's off.

491
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,869
He's movin'. He's movin'.
It's 8.00.

492
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,270
You're not a cat person,
are you?

493
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,350
Oh.

494
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,072
Okay, men.
Here he comes.

495
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,358
<i>He's on the move Here he comes.
Yeah. He just turned rght.</i>

496
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,476
I don't see anything.

497
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,429
No, wait. I got him.

498
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,952
- After you.
- You're taller!

499
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,951
- Go first.
- Uh, thanks a lot.

500
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,792
- Yeah.
- Great.

501
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,791
- Come on. Let's get this done.
- Okay.

502
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,632
Come on. Give me your foot.
Here we go.

503
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,314
- Ready?
- Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it!

504
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,869
- You forgot this.
- Fine.

505
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,791
Perfect.

506
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,669
What the hell's out there?

507
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,910
Oh, n-n-no! No!

508
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,230
Oh, get him off me!

509
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,477
Get him off me, please!

510
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,394
P-P-Pete, it's Kelso!
What's goin' on out there?

511
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,835
<i>- Swing him around and l'll shoot him!</i>
- The cat?

512
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,992
- <i>Get him off me!</i>
- No! Do not shoot the cat.

513
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,629
Do not shoot informant X.
I repeat, do not shoot informant X!

514
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,269
<i>We weren't gonna shoot informant X
It's a dog It's a rabid bulldog</i>

515
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,669
The bulldog's Smokey.
And he's not rabid.

516
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,309
He’s just senile. You have to sing
to him a little bit.

517
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,437
- He's a Motown fan.
- Do you know any Motown?

518
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,397
- Get him off me!
- Come on!

519
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,359
- He's got my butt! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
- Come on now! Ooh!

520
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,316
Big dog!

521
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,796
The cat just jumped
from a roof onto a terrace.

522
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,074
Proceed with caution.

523
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,352
Two down.

524
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,108
- A quiet target is an easy target.
- Using the siren was a good idea.

525
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,033
Okay. I got him now.

526
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,277
Okay, Dusty. Let's see
what you keep hidden in the trunk.

527
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,476
Holy smokes!

528
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,753
- Weird town, man.
- He's not talking about Edgefeld.

529
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,152
I believe he is, Miss Randall.
And these men have seen it all.

530
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,869
Darn cat!

531
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,315
Try driving that away, sucker!

532
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,994
Hee-hee-hee! Yes, siree!

533
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,674
Kelso, man, I cannot
make this place out.

534
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,348
- Looks like the coast is clear!
- Okay,you cover me. I cover you.

535
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,954
Okay, go! Go! Go!

536
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,274
- What a pretty pink bow.
- Don't touch it!

537
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,954
- Is it ticking?
- I'll see.

538
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,712
No.

539
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,119
Hey, meat!

540
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,954
Meat? That's a threat.
Like a dead fish on the doorstep.

541
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,349
Mob, or worse.

542
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,719
- Vegetarians?
- Get inside.

543
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,916
Oh! Don't step
on the meat. Oh!

544
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,594
<i>I just saw some vixen deliver
meat to a couple of guys.</i>

545
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,275
Ex-Excuse me-- Excuse me.
We have a young girl in the room here.

546
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,512
<i>No, Zeke I just saw some woman
deliver actual meat toa couple of guys.</i>

547
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,909
- Cat's on the move.
- I'll secure the door!

548
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,831
Melvin,you man the window
observation point.

549
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,239
Nobody there.

550
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,517
<i>Pete Pete man! Talk to me man!
What's goin 'on out there?</i>

551
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,549
<i>Talk to me!Be careful.
The suspect could be dangerous!</i>

552
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,632
Are your pizzas extra yummy?

553
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,154
And how old are you?

554
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,392
Oh, 16. Are you a pizza face?

555
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,951
- Just sounds like some sweet old lady.
- Oh, don't be so testy. I'm just funnin'.

556
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,589
- Mr Pepperoni Cheeks.
- I'm gonna get a little closer!

557
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,070
Hello, hello?
I can hang up on you too.

558
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,118
Who does he think he is?

559
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,954
- Whoa!
- Help! Help!

560
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,631
Who's out there?

561
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,631
The cat got
the drop on me.

562
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,633
It was sweet of Patti to give us
those tickets, wasn't it?

563
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,631
What a nice little girl
we have there.

564
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,711
- She is the best. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,631
Do you think
she's happy, honey?

566
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,837
She's a teenager!
She's not supposed to be happy.

567
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,638
True.

568
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,429
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

569
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,069
- You don't smoke cigars.
- Well, I don't buy cigars.

570
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,515
If a guy in a cat suit gives me
a free one, I'm gonna smoke it.

571
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,398
- Well, not in my car,you're not.
- Am I supposed to walk home?

572
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,472
Absolutely.

573
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,076
- I will leave the light on for you.
- See that you do.

574
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,594
- Really? Hmm.
- Mmm.

575
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,990
Kelso, this cat has been
sitting here for an hour!

576
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,200
- Now what do you want me to do?
- DC? DC?

577
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,991
Hi. What're you doin' here?
DC, it's me. Honey!

578
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,548
- DC!
- Kelso, an unidentified man's abducting the cat!

579
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,234
<i>Well, don't let him.
We need the cat!</i>

580
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,754
DC!

581
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,548
Hold it.
Don't move.

582
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,995
All right, cat man.
Up against the car!

583
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,911
Aw, the cat's gettin' away.

584
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,516
<i>Miller, detain the suspect.
Phil, Steve, stay with the cat.</i>

585
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,558
- Where's he goin' now?
- I don't know where he's going. I'm not a compass.

586
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,551
Oh, there he is. There he is.
All right, go, go, go!

587
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,756
No, he's goin' in the trees.
I hate trees.

588
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,272
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

589
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,999
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know. I'm all turned around.

590
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,996
There he is.
There he is.

591
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,555
Kelso, the cat
has entered a house.

592
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,315
<i>- I can see the shadows of two unidentifiable people</i>
- What are we gonna do?

593
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,197
<i>Awaiting orders, Zeke</i>

594
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,840
Are you scared?

595
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,275
N-Not scared, Patti.
Just cautious.

596
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,069
In life, it's important
to be prudent.

597
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,596
And besides, if these guys get killed,
I'm in big trouble.

598
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,274
- You're goin' in!
- One.

599
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,153
- Two.
- Three!

600
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,154
Don't-Don't-Don't move!
Uh-oh.

601
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,550
You know, we have a doorbell.

602
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,029
Huh?

603
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,789
Now, all we want
to know...

604
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,638
is what you wanted
with the cat.

605
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,280
I told you,
he's my cat.

606
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,669
But if he means that much to you,
you can have him.

607
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,671
You're in serious
trouble, mister!

608
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,230
This is an official
FBI investigation.

609
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,869
I just wanna know your name!

610
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,428
Don't lie to me!

611
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,069
'Cause I can tell when a man's lying.
I can see right through him.

612
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,312
Randall.
I'm Peter Randall.

613
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,516
Peter Randall.

614
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,591
You wouldn't happen to be related
to a Patti Randall, would you?

615
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,389
Hey, Mata Hari.
What's up with you?

616
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,756
- You on stake-out?
- How did you find out?

617
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,799
Well, when they arrested me for picking
up my own cat, that was a red fag.

618
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,270
I'm really sorry.
I meant to tell you too.

619
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,432
It's just that no one
would listen to me about the watch.

620
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,274
Yeah. Uh, let me
get this straight.

621
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,399
You mean to tell me that a kid like you
got a whole squad of FBI men...

622
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,870
down here to Edgefeld to follow
your cat around all night?

623
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,950
- I'm impressed.
- You think mom would feel that way?

624
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,398
- Not a chance.
- So you’re not gonna tell her?

625
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,270
Mmm, well, I guess it's all right if
a father and daughter have one secret.

626
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,636
<i>- Merci.</i>
- Yeah, I'm the best.

627
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,393
Just don't spread it around.
I got a reputation to maintain.

628
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,311
Now you go to sleep.

629
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,992
And, Patti...

630
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,273
try and make a human friend,
for your mother!

631
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,271
Hey.

632
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,717
Uh--

633
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,955
- Where have you been?
- Uh--

634
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,669
Go back to sleep.
This is a dream.

635
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,070
Peter, it is 6.30!

636
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,515
Re-- I got 6.24, honey.

637
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,798
I have been out of my mind with worry.
What happened to you?

638
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,310
Well,you know--

639
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,914
Well...

640
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,468
it was a very long cigar!

641
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,029
- And?
- And...

642
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,511
I had a wonderful time
with you last night.

643
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,511
- Excuse me?
- I had the prettiest date.

644
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,431
- I always do.
- Oh, I don't believe this.

645
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,593
This is the most inconsiderate
thing you’ve ever done.

646
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,592
I guess we can talk
about this in the morning then, huh?

647
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,716
Ooh.

648
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,953
If anybody needs me, uh,
I'll be down here, okay?

649
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,439
Boy,you sure had a big night,
didn’t you, Kelso?

650
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,670
- Look, Captain, I-I know it looks bad--
- Bad?

651
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,637
No, we passed "bad"
an hour ago.

652
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,756
Right now we’re on
major career bungle.

653
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:54,278
If it was up to me right now, I would
take your gun. I would take your badge.

654
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,990
But you’d let me keep my parking permit.
That must mean you like me, right?

655
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,278
I guess I'm off the case, right?

656
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,555
You're off the case.

657
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,114
- Hey, Captain, let me just say one thing--
- You're almost out of the Bureau.

658
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,031
Would you like
some coffee? Huh?

659
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,070
Oh, boy. I need to solve
this crime to keep my job.

660
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,991
- Randall.
- Hey, Kelso.

661
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,993
- I'm just doing a little research on some people.
- And what'd you find?

662
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,719
Absolutely nothing.
What are you doing here?

663
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,315
The thing is, I think that, though slightly
obnoxious, you actually are onto something.

664
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,755
Oh, really?
Because I think you...

665
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,435
although painfully inept, are my only
shot at finding this woman.

666
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,717
- Thanks.
- So, partners?

667
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,792
No. FBI agent and kid.

668
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,119
Where are you going?

669
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,873
I'm going out to the tool shed
to get a screwdriver!

670
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,115
Oh, honey, please don't cry.
It's just a screwdriver!

671
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,795
Oh, it's not the screwdriver,
Peter, and you know it.

672
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,519
In 20 wonderful years
of marriage...

673
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,068
you have never kept
anything from me.

674
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,958
You told me about
that Aunt Jemima thing.

675
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,917
It was Halloween.
I was 13years old--

676
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,309
You told me how they
called you Tubby in school.

677
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,550
Just until sixth grade.
I wish you hadn't brought that up.

678
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,156
Peter,you are keeping
something from me.

679
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,312
You know, that Tubby stuff is still
kinda painful after all these years.

680
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,871
Forget it.

681
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,591
This is supposed
to be blood?

682
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,478
That's how
it was labelled.

683
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,357
You'd better
get Boetticher!

684
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,192
Why do these street lights
keep on flickering?

685
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,191
Thanks for including me
in the investigation.

686
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,191
Hey, this is not
an investigation.

687
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,352
This is me and you walkin' around
so you can show me your town, okay?

688
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,960
- I've gotta get him. He's gonna get hurt.
- Stay back. I'll handle this.

689
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,112
- Hurry up.
- Don’t worry.

690
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,310
<i>Baby love
My baby love</i>

691
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,389
Wow. You can
really belt it out.

692
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,472
Thank you. Thursday night's
my karaoke night.

693
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,038
<i>- Party often?</i>
- Yeah.

694
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,076
I'd like to charter
a plane to Argentina.

695
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,991
No luggage, one way.

696
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,071
- And I'd like extra nuts.
- Who is that?

697
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,836
- That's old lady McCracken. But I thought she was a shut-in.
- I insist on it.

698
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,753
First class.
Spare no expense.

699
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,637
I'm loaded.

700
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,517
<i>I'm too sexy
for my shirt</i>

701
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,752
- Uh, Patti, about the butcher--
- Yes?

702
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,308
Yes, I got the order!

703
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,277
Well, I was afraid
it might go bad.

704
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,955
Well, it better be delivered
by tomorrow, or else it's dead meat.

705
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,395
Tomorrow? Tomorrow's the day
the ransom's due.

706
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,391
Oh, she's definitely
in on it.

707
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,313
It must be some kind of,
like, kidnappers' code.

708
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,437
- Kidnappers' code? Oh!
- <i>Too sexy for your body</i>

709
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,751
<i>The way I'm disco dancin'</i>

710
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,352
Oh, not again!

711
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,956
So Lu is a spy for McCracken who's,
like, the brains behind the whole thing.

712
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,713
So Melvin and Marvin
are, like, muscle guys?

713
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,076
- So why’s she hidin' in the alley?
- Hey! Lamb chops!

714
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,394
Whoever's stalking us
is probably watching us...

715
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,790
right now!

716
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,996
- Does my hair look okay?
- Hey, it looks like he's signalling somebody.

717
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,752
No!

718
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,469
What in the name of all that is good
still left in the world are you doing?

719
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,439
I was thanking
whoever left the meat.

720
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,078
- Than--
- Melvin!

721
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,317
You're a burger and a fries
short of a Happy Meal.

722
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,516
W-W-Wait! Hey, hey! Oh!

723
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,751
- Act Natural. - A full Happy Meal.
- Don't look suspicious.

724
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,910
Lamb chops down the drain.

725
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,512
All right, so I've got it.

726
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,593
Lu, Melvin, Marvin
and McCracken are all in on it.

727
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,750
And when Lu
drops off the meat...

728
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,753
they transport the maid
to a hiding place that McCracken picks.

729
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,108
This'll stick in your tank, Dusty.

730
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,753
Okay, Dusty,
you wanna play hardball?

731
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,150
All right. This'll teach you
to rip me off.

732
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,198
Take that! And this!

733
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,078
- This!
- Uh-oh!

734
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,390
Stay back!

735
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,792
You okay?

736
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,472
Why do people always ask somebody who's just had
their slammed into something hard if they're okay?

737
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,268
<i>You might wanna check that out
for evidence you know?</i>

738
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,478
<i>It's right by the donut shop there at Ballard
Can you bring me back a sprinkles?</i>

739
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,431
Oh, I wonder
how that happened.

740
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:36,629
Well, it's obviously a conspiracy. I mean, they're hiding
in ski masks, making plans to skip off to Argentina.

741
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,280
I can't believe
this whole town is full of criminals.

742
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,797
- Patti, would you stop jumpin' to conclusions?
- What? These people are nuts.

743
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,236
<i>Car 13. Car 13. We have a report
of two unidentified suspects--</i>

744
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,199
<i>one male, one female-- trespassing
Could be prowlers Over.</i>

745
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,793
Okay.

746
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,874
Ugh, what a mess. He's all covered
in stickers and twigs.

747
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,349
Stickers and twigs?

748
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,273
This is where DC
got the bloody twig.

749
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,157
Lizzy was dragged
through these leaves.

750
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,468
- Officers, no need for alarm.
- Freeze! - I'm a federal agent.

751
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,995
- Hold it!
- I'm-I'm gonna get my ID.

752
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,389
Forget about the ID.

753
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,234
If you're an FBI agent,
I'm Oprah Winfrey.

754
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,799
Oh, I love your show!

755
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,393
Get in the car!

756
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,109
- In the back, in the car!
- This is ridiculous. They can't do anything to us anyway.

757
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,998
All right, put your hands
on top of the car! Spread your legs.

758
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,356
Well, now. What do we have here?

759
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,829
<i>...and don't forget to call your wife</i>

760
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,512
Hmm?

761
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,752
Cat got your tongue?

762
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,274
Good one. Hmm.

763
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,357
Did I take you off this case?
Was that me?

764
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,398
Um, sir, I think you might
find this interesting.

765
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,950
Um, we found the source
of-of the bloody twig.

766
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,758
- The bloody twig?
- Mm-hmm.

767
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,033
- The bloody twig?
- Oh.

768
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,114
The bloody twig is a stem
from a maraschino cherry!

769
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,318
Oh. Never mind.

770
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,038
- Kelso...
- Mm-hmm?

771
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,680
Out of respect
to your father!..

772
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,311
I've tried to keep an open mind,
but I can't do it any more.

773
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,473
You're an incompetent agent and
an embarrassment to the department.

774
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,956
- Oh, Patti!
- Oops, uh, my turn.

775
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,271
You see? I was not lying to you.

776
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,035
There's no deep, dark secrets here.
I was just trying to be a good father!

777
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,078
- Believe me, it's the last time.
- This is how you help her!..

778
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,152
By letting her run around
until she ends up in prison?

779
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,754
I don't know
how to answer that.

780
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,549
I'm Captain Boetticher!
Mrs Randall, Mr Randall...

781
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,596
on behalf of the Bureau...

782
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,639
I just want to apologize for getting
your girl involved in all of this.

783
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,676
Well, I do have to say,
I find it surprising...

784
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,072
that you would listen
to a 16-year-old in the first place.

785
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,950
Well, ma'am, the watch with "help" on it
was a very convincing piece of evidence.

786
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,032
It didn't say "help." It said "hell."

787
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,112
- It said "help."
- No, it said "hell."

788
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,909
No, I believe it said "help."

789
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,950
No, it definitely said
"H-E-L-L."

790
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,711
Wow, Mom. You swore.

791
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,318
I'm sorry.

792
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,352
The Edgefeld investigation...

793
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,432
is closed.

794
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,352
You can't go to the movies.
You can’t watch TV.

795
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,989
You can't eat dessert. You can't go out
with your little friends.

796
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,038
She doesn't do those things anyway.

797
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,033
You have put me in a terrible position
in this town, Patti.

798
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,908
You have been hurling accusations. You
have gotten innocent people arrested.

799
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,596
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry is just not good enough, Patti.

800
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,989
Now, I don't know what kind of
a person you are choosing to be...

801
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,117
but it is not one
that I am very proud of right now.

802
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,270
While we are
at the cat show...

803
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,239
I would like you to think about all
the people that you have hurt...

804
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,515
by your jumping to conclusions,
all right?

805
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,398
- Peter!
- You go--

806
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,995
It's all your fault.

807
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,873
I don't belong here anyway.

808
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,871
One ticket to New York, please.

809
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,679
- One-way or round-trip?
- One-way.

810
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,951
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

811
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,595
Hey! What are you doing here?

812
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,275
- Waitin' for a train.
- Oh.

813
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,711
So where you goin'?

814
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,997
I don't know.
Anywhere that's not here.

815
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,991
This is kind of sudden,
isn't it?

816
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,596
I mean,you're not
in any kind of trouble, are you?

817
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,591
No. What are you
talking about?

818
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,071
Nothing.
What's in the bag?

819
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,516
Clothing, books,
pictures, a veal roast--

820
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,955
pieces of my nothing life.

821
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,679
Lu, I sense depression.

822
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,558
Oh, I just gotta
get outta here.

823
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,918
I'm tired of being in love with someone
who doesn't love me.

824
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,195
You're in love?
With who?

825
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,396
- Melvin Yazbo.
- Melvin?

826
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,393
Yes. I've secretly been in love
with him for years...

827
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:47,112
watching him patrol, knowing he'd lay
down his life for someone in need.

828
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,839
I left meat on his doorstep.

829
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,993
Lamb chops, veal chops,
pork chops. He likes chops.

830
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,878
I was always told a way to a man's
hear twas through his stomach...

831
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,793
that a nice steak
spelled "love."

832
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,711
That's why you left
the meat?

833
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,598
- I thought he'd figure it out.
- Oh.

834
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,511
I've been getting things
really wrong.

835
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,639
I mean, maybe he-he did figure it out
and he’s just not interested.

836
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,837
No. No. I think
you’re way off, Lu.

837
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,751
Melvin is totally getable.

838
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,957
- Not by me.
- Lu, he doesn't even know you.

839
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,235
You haven't even tried.

840
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,395
You can't go around staring at him
and leaving anonymous pieces of meat.

841
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,471
But they're the best cuts.
No visible fat.

842
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,471
Lu,you have to make an effort.

843
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,472
There's a right way and a wrong way
to get to know people.

844
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,199
- Maybe if I were more like you.
- Like me?

845
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,111
Yeah.

846
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,670
You know, sharp, funny, outgoing.
You dress so cool.

847
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,672
I bet you’re really popular!

848
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,591
I wouldn't bet a lot.

849
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,955
But you're so young.
How do you know all of this?

850
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,399
I guess I just figured it out,
like, two seconds ago.

851
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,950
<i>Express train to Boston
and New York...</i>

852
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,271
<i>now arriving from Bellows Falls
and Worcester.</i>

853
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,478
- The train's coming.
- Yeah.

854
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,117
Well, what do you say we cash in our tickets
and give this place another shot?

855
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,674
I'd say it sounds good.

856
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,668
I need a tune-up
and an oil change.

857
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,591
I’ll just leave you
my wallet.

858
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,830
It'll make it easier
for you to rob me blind.

859
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,229
No problem. The car will be ready
in 30 minutes.

860
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,835
- I'll do it in 28.
- You want a fat lip?

861
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,473
Well, remember!

862
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,155
- He's shy, so be bold.
- Thanks.

863
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,629
- See ya later, Patti.
- Bye.

864
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,633
Why can’t you ever just
torture mice or something?

865
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,280
Huh? Hey.

866
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,351
What's this?

867
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,953
Huh? DC!

868
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,911
DC!

869
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,999
Melvin!

870
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,759
Lu?

871
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,755
Wow! Ow!
I think you bit my lip.

872
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,399
- Oh.
- I liked it.

873
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,596
I sent you the meat!

874
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,595
I should've known.

875
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,070
Best cuts.
No visible fat.

876
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,151
You noticed.

877
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,551
How could I not?

878
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,631
- I-I need my inhaler!
- Oh, my goodness!

879
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,314
Norman! W-W-Wait.
Come with me.

880
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,039
- Norman, I think I'm engaged!
- Yeah!

881
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,354
I'm gonna
strangle you, DC!

882
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,397
What are you doing? DC!

883
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,551
<i>Kidnapping is a--
is a double tragedy..</i>

884
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,871
<i>for Elaine and me
first, because we love Lizzy..</i>

885
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,032
- <i>and uh, second because we're broke</i>
- Oh! - Oh!

886
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,191
Snack room.
And I'm out of decaf.

887
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,555
So if you want some,you go down
the block and get it yourself, okay?

888
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,916
Zeke, it's Patti.
I know where she is. DC found her!

889
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,709
- Say goodbye, Patti.
- <i>No, no,you don't understand I'm rght outside</i>

890
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,394
No, no,you don't understand.
You falsified evidence.

891
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,835
You manufactured a witness.
You made me look stupid.

892
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,753
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

893
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,353
<i>I'm cleanin' cups.</i>

894
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,193
My coffee's done.
I gotta go.

895
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,310
- Ow. That must've hurt.
- Oh, good. Am I glad to see you!

896
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,391
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm the one who found your watch.

897
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,994
Oh, thank God
somebody found it.

898
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,640
They almost caught me.
I didn't get to finish the "P."

899
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,711
Oh, don’t worry.
I did it for you.

900
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,234
I'll have you outta here in a sec.

901
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,074
Oh, my God!
It’s you!

902
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,111
The celebrity judge
should be here momentarily.

903
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,113
This is a disaster! He was supposed
to be here over 30 minutes ago.

904
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,149
Well, honey,you know these
Hollywood types-- fashionably late.

905
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,550
Maybe he left a message
on the machine at home.

906
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,870
<i>This is a most important mark
of this cat.</i>

907
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,919
<i>It has a thick, shaped head
a long lovely tail..</i>

908
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,197
<i>expressive ears, big eyes.</i>

909
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,750
<i>Hello. You've reached the Randall residence
If you're looking for Patti...</i>

910
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,593
<i>I've left town to go and depress
some other once-happy community</i>

911
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,591
<i>Don't worry,
I'm not coming back</i>

912
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,513
<i>If you're looking for my parents,
leave a message at the beep.</i>

913
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,031
Regular or decaf?

914
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,033
<i>Hello,Agent Kelso?
This is Mrs Randall, Patti's mother.</i>

915
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,999
Is Patti with you? We can't find her, and
we're afraid that she may be missing.

916
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,516
Uh, no, Ms Randall, but
wherever she is, I'm sure she's fine.

917
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,433
- She's wearing an overcoat.
- Oh, well...

918
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,796
uh, thank you very much.
Goodbye.

919
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,638
Anything else?

920
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,597
What to do?
What to do? What to do?

921
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,830
Well, if I go, then it's
an automatic suspension...

922
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,309
possible termination,
career as a coffee bean expert.

923
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,551
But, on the other hand,
you know, the kid's in trouble, so--

924
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,071
You would go, wouldn't you?

925
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,517
Okay, okay, okay. Where to start?
Where to start? Where to start?

926
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,713
Butcher!

927
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,398
Love meat!

928
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,636
Butcher!
Butcher, butcher, butcher!

929
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,235
Okay. McCracken.
Security guard.

930
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,629
Okay. Patti said the butcher signals
the security guards where the maid is.

931
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,915
All right,
when she's doing that...

932
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,991
what are the rest
of them doing?

933
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,712
FBI.

934
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,832
Mrs McCracken! Please, put your
teeth back in before you lose 'em again.

935
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,832
How could I lose 'em?
I never go anywhere.

936
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,956
Open your mouth.
Come on. Open it.

937
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,838
No, this is wrong.

938
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,751
She's the ringleader
of a conspiracy like--

939
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,957
like a butcher is a--
a messenger.

940
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,871
There's nothing here.

941
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,076
What am I gonna do?

942
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,711
Okay, okay. I need a--
I need a new strategy. No more manuals.

943
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,631
I gotta-- I gotta think like a cat.

944
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,793
A cat knows.
Yeah, I am a cat.

945
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,519
I am a cat. I am a cat.

946
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,398
Thinkin' like a cat.
I'm slinkin' like a cat.

947
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,756
I'm slinking, thinking like a cat.
Slinking-- Slinking and thinking like a cat.

948
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,831
Moving like a cat.
Movement.

949
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,990
I am movement.
I am instinct. I am motion.

950
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,674
I-I am-- I am cracking up.

951
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,630
Slinking, slinking,
slinking, slinking, slinking.

952
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,474
Okay. I like slinking.
It's more fun than walking.

953
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,710
Hey, fella,you need help?

954
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,711
Okay, okay. DC likes--

955
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,270
DC likes meat.

956
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,397
DC likes to use my head
as a launching pad. Oh, great.

957
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,391
DC likes--

958
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,750
Garbage!

959
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,035
DC likes garbage!

960
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,591
Come on. Bring her back.

961
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,472
That's good.
Take it.

962
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,510
Excuse me! Excuse me!

963
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,989
Um, have you--
have you seen--

964
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:05,119
- Ha-Have you seen a grey-and-white cat?
- Recently or in my lifetime?

965
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,152
Recently.

966
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,628
No. Wanna hear
about my lifetime?

967
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,598
Thank you very much
for your help, sir!

968
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,989
Okay, let's go!
Take her away!

969
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,993
Cherry stems!

970
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,953
Oh!

971
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,073
Lookin' for clues.
Lookin' for clues. Lookin' for clues.

972
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:53,312
Cabbage! Hey! I'm on the trail.
I'm on the trail. I'm on the trail.

973
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,192
Sorry, Patti. You know what they say--
curiosity killed the cat.

974
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,834
- Hello?
<i>- Have you got any rocky road?</i>

975
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,718
- Yes.
- <i>You better pave it.</i>

976
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,951
FBI! Hit the floor and drop the guns!
Drop the gun!

977
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,598
You okay, Patti?

978
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,990
What? Nobody says
"please" any more?

979
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,470
- Zeke! You smell really bad.
- Happy to see you too, Patti.

980
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,073
What happened?

981
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,948
- Got in a fight with a Dumpster and lost.
- Oh.

982
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,031
I'm watchin' you.
I'm watchin' you.

983
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,350
Ah. Thanks.
And who are you?

984
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,319
Zeke Kelso, FBI--
at your service, baby.

985
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,191
Oh, wait!
What about DC?

986
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,714
- The cat.
- Oh, my! Let's not forget him.

987
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,836
Okay, okay, DC. L-Let's go, let's go.

988
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,157
Hey, come on, man.
Don't even start with me. Okay?

989
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,275
- Grab the gun, Ma, or we're goners.
- Okay.

990
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,519
Who's in charge now?

991
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,513
- Why did you do this?
- We partied away all our cash in Monte Carlo.

992
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,477
Yeah. And the Riviera.

993
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,553
- Plus, we were bored out of our skulls.
- Oh, I can relate, but still--

994
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,713
Hey, hey! Don't sass your elders.
Let's do it, Pa.

995
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,396
- You're coming with me.
- Oh, here we go again. - I got her!

996
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,675
Shut her up, Ma.
So long, suckers.

997
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,912
You know, two can travel
faster than three. Okay!

998
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,348
- Where's the car?
- It's at Dusty's getting a lube job.

999
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,592
- Kick it in.
- I'd rather go through the window.

1000
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,114
- What?
- Keep the getaway car nearby, Pa?

1001
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,316
How should I know?
It's my first kidnapping.

1002
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,716
Excuse me, kidnapper?
I need to use the bathroom.

1003
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,156
- You should've thought of that
before we went on the lam. - Hey!

1004
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,953
Aha! Gotcha!
I knew it!

1005
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,951
You've been messin'
with my cars.

1006
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,952
- No, I wasn't. I was--
- How do you like this?

1007
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,076
Just like Monaco in '67.

1008
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,958
Except I don't have
my own teeth.

1009
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,196
- I said-- I said, get in the car!
- I'm not getting in there! - Get in the--

1010
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,510
- Let's take the truck!
- Great!

1011
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,591
They have a TransAm.
We have a beaten-up truck.

1012
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,195
Patti. It's not the size of the dog
in the fight.

1013
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,840
It's the size of the fight
in the dog.

1014
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,117
- Gun it, Pa!
- You got it, Ma!

1015
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,035
- Ma and Pa's Geritol must've just kicked in.
- Yeah!

1016
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,794
- Okay, we need to cut 'em off. Get in front of them.
- Then they'll be chasing us!

1017
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,917
This will teach you
to mess with me, buddy boy.

1018
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,918
- Someone's messed with the car! She won’t turn right.
- Then turn it left.

1019
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,839
Oh, my God, did you see that? That was,
like, a 360 twice. In fact, a 720.

1020
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,037
I hope you’re happy.
I don't need a bathroom any more.

1021
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,553
Into the skid. Into the skid.
Into the skid. Into the skid.

1022
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,788
<i>It's the moment we’ve been
waiting for</i>

1023
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,838
<i>We're cheek to cheek
on the ballroom floor</i>

1024
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,753
- Zeke, that smell is getting worse.
- Tell me something I don't know.

1025
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,038
- Try this. All the kids are doing it.
- All the kids are wearing air fresheners now?

1026
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,476
- Oh,yeah. It's real cool.
- Cool.

1027
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,993
We're gaining on 'em.

1028
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,278
You know,
he had the right of way.

1029
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,472
Who gave him a gun?

1030
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,279
- They're gaining on us, Ma.
- Oh!

1031
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,591
- It's a dead end.
- Watch the road.

1032
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,599
- It's not him!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1033
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,034
- Eh,you swing like a girl.
- Oh,yeah? -Yeah.

1034
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,635
Okay, that's it! I'm sick and tired
of you pushin' me, mister!

1035
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,631
- I've got something for you.
- Oh,yeah?

1036
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,870
- Yeah.
- Well, I've got something for you.

1037
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,349
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah!

1038
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,835
And don't drip on my sidewalk.

1039
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,956
I'll drip where I want.

1040
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,549
I noticed you didn't use
your turn signal.

1041
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,758
Oh, great. Smokey's out.

1042
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,071
- Everybody better practise their Motown.
- Hang on, DC!

1043
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,672
Don’t worry.
The FBI'll fix that. Huh?

1044
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,433
Go faster!
Stop hitting things!

1045
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,629
- Here.
- Aw,you're so sweet.

1046
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,836
We'll always have Paris.

1047
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,076
He's smashin' way more stuff
than me.

1048
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,677
- Stay down! Stay down!
- What a place to put a window.

1049
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,069
- Marvin, we're under attack!
- What’s your longitude and latitude?

1050
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,628
The butcher shop.
We're at the butcher shop.

1051
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,911
What is it with
these criminals and meat?

1052
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,673
Look, there! It says <i>"no</i> left turn."
Can’t you read?

1053
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,797
- Oh, shush.
- And your hands are supposed to be at 2.00 and 10.00.

1054
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,235
At this point, I'd take
a hundred bucks for her!

1055
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,436
This is my favourite jumpsuit.

1056
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,034
Hey, come on.
Not in the face.

1057
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,192
- Eat paint!
- Eat fuchsia, baldy!

1058
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,558
- I'll see you on the street.
- This town has gone totally insane.

1059
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,712
Sorry I'm late, folks.
The kitties needed new head shots.

1060
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,356
Look at the size
of that cat.

1061
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,958
- I hate to bring this up, but Pa's headed straight for--
- The gazebo!

1062
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,879
Sorry, ladies!
I like rock and roll!

1063
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,279
And so are we!

1064
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,152
Man, has Pa gone
post office or what?

1065
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,757
She still won't turn right.
We gotta go around again.

1066
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,833
- What are you doing?
- I brake for animals!

1067
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,115
Zeke! Stop!

1068
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,068
DC! That darn cat.

1069
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,751
What's happenin' out there?

1070
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:57,160
You and I finally found love,
and it could all be over!

1071
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,230
- What a kick in the butt.
- Oh.

1072
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,519
- I've come to rescue you!
- I knew you would.

1073
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,275
I had to. You're my brother!
Come here, little bro.

1074
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,430
- Thanks, Marv! Oh,you know Lu?
- Hello, Marvin.

1075
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,750
Yeah.

1076
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,195
Lu and you?

1077
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,156
You know, Marv!..

1078
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,631
Sometimes happiness is right
in your own backyard or butcher shop.

1079
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,110
Oh, man.
I threw away all those chops.

1080
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,077
Let's get the heck
out of this town.

1081
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,949
One, two, three, four, five.

1082
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,317
Oh, no!
Somebody call the fire department!

1083
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,994
- Holy mackerel!
- Oh, no!

1084
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,510
Just a sleepy little town.
I don't see how you stand it.

1085
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,150
Low bridge!

1086
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,079
Oh!

1087
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:34,239
- Gimme your air freshener!
- No! - Come on.

1088
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,914
Now I know
what a sardine feels like.

1089
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,115
- Things are gettin' hot around here.
- I think there’s something wrong with the engine.

1090
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,712
I was right.

1091
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,472
What do you know?
Lu and Marvin finally got it together!

1092
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,989
Watch the road, Pa!

1093
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,271
Melvin, Melvin! They've knocked
out the lights. Get my flashlight.

1094
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,310
One more push,
and this will sign them off!

1095
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,670
Don't move!

1096
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,399
Okay, okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1097
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,631
Yeah!

1098
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,119
Freeze!

1099
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,194
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again--</i>

1100
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,636
- I finally left my apartment.
- <i>If you need help, hangup and then dial your operat--</i>

1101
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,633
- Guess everything turned out all right, didn't it?
- Yeah, it was real good.

1102
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,636
Patti! Oh!

1103
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,909
- Miss me?
- H-E-L-L,yes.

1104
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,076
- Mmm, I want some ice cream.
- Is a maid worth all this?

1105
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,071
- Mr Randall?
- Oh, Officer Kelso. Hi.

1106
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,628
- You know--
- Mrs Randall.

1107
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,631
- There she is.
- Lizzy!

1108
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,871
- Lizzy! Oh, Lizzy!
- Hi.

1109
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,316
I-I hope you’re not
expecting to be paid for this week.

1110
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,790
Oh, we missed you
so much, so much. Have a Ho Ho.

1111
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,838
- Where's my Ding Dongs? Where are my Ding Dongs?
- Two butcher shop windows...

1112
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,277
a gazebo, a security office
and a flower stand. All totaled?

1113
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,352
Not to mention,
two blown-up gas stations?

1114
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,513
So you just had to do things
your own way, huh?

1115
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,750
Always alert
and thorough, sir!

1116
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,349
Not exactly 24 hours,
but the victim is safe and sound.

1117
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,398
And I think your father
would be proud of you.

1118
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,515
- W-What's that on your shirt?
- It's lettuce. - Oh.

1119
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,871
This is so cool, Patti.

1120
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,269
- Pretty scary picture, huh?
- Oh, I think it's good.

1121
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,351
- Really? - Mmm-hmm.
- DC looks good.

1122
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,238
Hey, listen, Patti. I'm having a party
at my house tonight.

1123
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,517
- Do you wanna come? - Yeah, sure.
- Okay. - Sounds like fun.

1124
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,836
Hey, FBI girl!

1125
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,673
- Who's that?
- My friend from the Bureau.

1126
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,910
- Whoa, a fed.
- Well, I'll see you later tonight.

1127
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,117
- Bye. - Bye.
- She's hanging outwith the FBI?

1128
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,873
- Man, I'm happy if I see a fire truck.
- No kidding.

1129
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,791
Hey, G-man.

1130
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,711
W-Wait a minute. Did I see you
talkin' to the locals?

1131
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,109
I-I mean,you're gonna lose your
"queen of the freaks" title.

1132
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,668
Yeah, well, being queen
is kind of overrated.

1133
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,399
So, how-how's it feel
to be popular?

1134
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,311
- Well, I'm not complaining.
- Oh.

1135
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,231
How's it feel
to be your own man?

1136
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,515
Well, at least none of my assignments
include cream and sugar!

1137
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,710
How come your name's first?

1138
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,631
Well, we've been over this
time and time again.

1139
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,872
- You see, it's alphabetical.
- Oh, right, right.

1140
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,995
So, uh, where's the fleabag?
He-He-He’s working on another case?

1141
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:33,198
No, his crime-fighting days are over!
He's got other things on his mind now.

1142
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,077
Aw!

1143
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,471
- <i>That darn cat
