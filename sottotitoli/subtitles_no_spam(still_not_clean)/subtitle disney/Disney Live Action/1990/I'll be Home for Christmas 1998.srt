1
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,640
Hey, James.

2
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,120
1 2-32-1 4!

3
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,080
Jake, thank God, let me out.

4
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,920
Did you get my mail?

5
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,800
Math test.

6
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,680
A minus.
You made it look just good enough.

7
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Did you score me
backstage passes to Dave Matthews?

8
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,160
That's my man. All right.

9
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,760
1 2-32...what was that last number
again? 1 68?

10
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,920
1 4, Jake.

11
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,000
All right, calm down, l got you.

12
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

13
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,200
lan, what is the deal with you being
sardined into your locker again?

14
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,400
Eddie Taffett
and his troglodyte trio.

15
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
They're bugged
about the phoney lDs we sold.

16
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,080
l'll take care of them later.
Get on the net.

17
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,240
Change that ticket my dad got me
to New York

18
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,320
and book two seats to Cabo San Lucas.

19
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,400
- Will you be taking Allie?
- Working on that now.

20
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
Morning, ladies.

21
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,920
- Do those things work?
- Yeah, wanna see?

22
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
No, it's OK.

23
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,960
Zone defence? Guess l'm not
going to be able to get in.

24
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,800
Unless... What's this?

25
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,560
- Cherry crunch?
- Would l bring you anything else?

26
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,320
l'm sure that tastes good here.
lt would taste better someplace else.

27
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,440
What are you doing here?

28
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,520
You said you wanted to see what it
would be like to wake up next to me.

29
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,880
Oh, good line.

30
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,960
Premeditated or spontaneous?

31
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,800
Totally off the cuff.

32
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,760
l was inspired by the lovely sight
of you drooling.

33
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,200
l wasn't drooling, l was sleeping.

34
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,640
Sleeping?
l can't sleep, l've got to study.

35
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,840
You were studying subliminally.

36
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,560
You were absorbing it off the page
through osmosis.

37
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
Give me that.

38
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,120
Look, my final is in three hours.

39
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,920
You're here, just distracting me,
so get out of here.

40
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
No problem. Suit yourself.

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,200
l just wanted to let you know
there's a freak storm. Snowing.

42
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
Snowing?

43
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,240
We're in southern California.
lt's not...

44
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,560
My God.

45
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,280
lt's snowing.

46
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Jake, you lunatic.
Where did you get a snow machine?

47
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,480
lt's a white Christmas,
just like home.

48
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
And here's a little Christmas cheer.

49
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,760
Egg nog?
My mother makes this from scratch.

50
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
And one more thing.

51
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,040
More? Do l detect
an overage of niceness going on here?

52
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,560
Just read it.

53
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,960
Two tickets to Cabo San Lucas,
Christmas on the beach.

54
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,640
- Amazing.
- l knew you'd be...

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
Pissed.

56
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,880
This is the most inconsiderate thing.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,800
l have plans
that are important to me.

58
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,480
lt's not like l'm asking you
to sleep in a Porta Potti.

59
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
A condo overlooking the ocean.

60
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,600
Forget it. You know l am driving home
to visit my family.

61
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
Tell them what l told my dad.

62
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,720
You're gonna be in the gym
for the next two weeks

63
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,400
in preparation for Ultimate Fighting.

64
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
- That's what you told him?
- Sure.

65
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,800
When he found out l wanted
to stay here, he was relieved.

66
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,640
But l want to go home.

67
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
l want a traditional Christmas
with snow and stockings

68
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,320
and egg nog and carollers.

69
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,840
l thought we could have fun
this Christmas.

70
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,560
You thought that you could have fun.

71
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
But what about everybody else?

72
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,080
Mom and Dad would be crushed
if l didn't come home.

73
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,440
What about your dad
and your sister and Carolyn?

74
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,960
Bringing up my dad's new wife
drains me of my Christmas spirit.

75
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,080
All l'm saying is, don't you think
it's time you went home?

76
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Hey, there. Looking good today.

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,880
Thanks, Eddie,
you're looking nice today, too.

78
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,640
l'm not talking to you, Wilkinson.

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,840
Allie, what perfume
are you wearing today?

80
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
Excuse me?

81
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,680
l got three words for you.
New. Car. Smell.

82
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,680
lt would smell so good on you.
Come here and check it out.

83
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,520
l got one word for you. Beemer.

84
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,600
S"tand away from the vehicle."

85
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
You got to be kidding me.

86
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,080
So it's Disco lnferno Night
at the Viper Room, right?

87
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,760
lt's me and the Murph Man
and the Ed Man and the Ken Man.

88
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,360
We were waiting in line
for half the night.

89
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,680
The bouncer finally gives us
the nod.

90
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,320
We go over there
and debut our brand-new lDs.

91
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,560
- The dude goes...
- Bye-bye.

92
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,480
No one says bye-bye
to the Brandt Man.

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Fellas.

94
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,200
What can l say? My subcontractor
has been slacking off.

95
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,800
l want to make this up to you.

96
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
l have a foolproof method

97
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
that will guarantee
you ace your History final.

98
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,000
But if you'd rather see
your grades crash and burn.

99
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,080
lt's up to you.

100
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,560
No cost?

101
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Of course there's no cost
for the answers.

102
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,880
l couldn't do that to you.
You guys are my buds.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
However, there is a nominal fee
for the beeper rental.

104
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
Wilkinson residence.

105
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
l'm sorry,
he can't come to the phone right now.

106
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,440
He's busy accessorising.

107
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,480
Jake, it's your dad.

108
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,880
See you.

109
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,320
- How are things at the office?
- We're all off for the holidays.

110
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,000
l sent everybody home at noon.

111
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,400
Great. Getting ready for ski season?

112
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,440
Yeah, l just got my bindings fixed.

113
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,720
Look, l'm calling to find out
about you.

114
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,440
Are you still planning
to come home for Christmas?

115
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,600
l'd like to but l gotta stay on
campus and finish up that lab work...

116
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,240
Cos l got a call from my
travel agent.

117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,080
He says the ticket l sent you was
cashed in for two to Cabo San Lucas.

118
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
He says somebody
sabotaged his computer file.

119
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,840
What kind of a world
are we living in?

120
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,040
ls the convenience of technology
worth the loss to our privacy?

121
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,840
Who would do such a thing?
Where will it end?

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,440
l agreed to let you go off
to school in California.

123
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
But you haven't been home
for the holidays since Mom died.

124
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,720
l think it's time
that we become a family again.

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,760
lf you were 1 8, where would you
rather be for Christmas?

126
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,240
At home with your family

127
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,720
or in Cabo
on the beach with a beautiful girl?

128
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,560
Allie's parents say she is coming
home like always.

129
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,640
l just really want you home, son.

130
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,920
- Me too.
- As does Carol.

131
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,200
- No.
- And Tracey, we all want you home.

132
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,800
Well, l just don't think
l can get there.

133
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,400
Not even if l...give you the Porsche?

134
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
Excuse me?

135
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,520
The Porsche?

136
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,520
The 1 95 Porsche?

137
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,800
The same one we rebuilt by hand
together

138
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,640
with the kid-glove interiors
and the original paint?

139
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,560
l tell you what, if you're home
when we sit down to dinner,

140
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,240
6:00, Christmas Eve, the car's yours.

141
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,400
6:00.
Not one minute past. Understand?

142
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,960
- Yes, sir.
- We'll see you then.

143
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,040
Great. Bye.

144
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
You are mine.

145
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,000
All mine.

146
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,720
He cashes in the tickets
and you offer him a bribe?

147
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,240
Do you see anything wrong
with this picture?

148
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,640
- Yeah, l do, but...
- But what?

149
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,120
Jake's coming home for Christmas.

150
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,160
OK, l got to go pack, you guys.
See you in an hour?

151
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,960
Nice try but no chance.

152
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,040
Must be defective.

153
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,880
l estimated it would be another five
hours till you tried to make up.

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,240
That's funny.

155
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,880
l estimate that it takes five hours
to fly to Larchmont, New York.

156
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,840
l thought you cashed your ticket in.

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,160
l cashed it back in
for tickets to New York.

158
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,040
Will you please accept my apology

159
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,080
and come home with me for Christmas?

160
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,800
You're unbelievable.

161
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,520
Tell me about it.
Ripley is doing a special on me.

162
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,120
So, why the sudden change of heart?

163
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,800
l guess you got to me with
all that sentimental family stuff.

164
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,680
l'm glad you're coming around.

165
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,440
lf you don't have family,
what do you have?

166
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,240
So, do you want to come over
and help me pack?

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,960
l can't. l gotta go tutor some jocks.

168
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,800
You're such a compassionate man!

169
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,640
l am a giver.

170
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,720
Pick you up tomorrow morning, 8:00.

171
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,360
This better work.

172
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,080
Run.

173
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,160
Look out.

174
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,120
What's taking so long?

175
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,720
- Sorry, Ms Peterson.
- Coach likes to stay in touch.

176
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,120
Driving a Porsche, it's like
you have a relationship with it.

177
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,920
lt knows you. lt's listening
and just responding.

178
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,200
So true.

179
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
Downshifting?

180
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,440
You don't know what it is
until you downshift a Porsche.

181
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,640
- You are a lucky man.
- So true.

182
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,040
So, Jake, are you feeling lucky?

183
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,600
lmmensely.

184
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,680
l think that's all about to change.

185
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,440
Something wrong, fellas?

186
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,280
You think you're a wiseguy?

187
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,920
lt's real funny to make us
look like morons?

188
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,920
- What are you talking about?
- The beepers, dipstick.

189
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,920
Where's lan?

190
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,880
1 2-32-1 4.

191
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,480
l'm sure there's some explanation.
Let me make a call.

192
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
We're done explaining.

193
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Boys.

194
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,480
All right, see you later.
Have a good break.

195
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,680
All right, Jake, where are you?

196
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,680
God, l wish l were dead.

197
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,720
l said l wished l were dead.

198
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,040
''Let's see you sweet-talk your way
out of this.''

199
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,360
''Eddie and the boys.''

200
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,080
The last time
l do business with those guys.

201
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,480
Go on, get out of here.

202
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,960
You glued it on, didn't you,
you jerks?

203
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,240
The hat too?

204
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,120
This is not acceptable.

205
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
Sit. Roll over.

206
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,240
Die.

207
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,760
H"ey, it"'s J"a"k"e, yo"u "fo"u"nd me."

208
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,080
- ldiot.
- Who's an idiot?

209
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,800
l am.

210
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,040
Jake flaked, huh?

211
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,440
What a surprise. Lucky for you,
the Ed Man is here to the rescue.

212
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,240
What do you say we blow
this Popsicle stand?

213
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,480
You're loving this, aren't you?

214
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,920
Pretty much, yeah.

215
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,280
- OK, let's go.
- All right.

216
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,480
No, allow me. l got it.

217
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,760
The ultimate in irony.

218
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,400
1  Academy kids
are driving back east this winter

219
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,160
and l get a ride with you.

220
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,120
Just the two of us, riding
the crest of destiny's rainbow.

221
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,320
Sharing. Caring. A pair for the ages.

222
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,880
OK, hold on, first the ground rules.

223
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,960
lf you say to me things like that,
l'll have to slug you.

224
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,880
lf you say anything nasty about Jake,
l'll have to slug you.

225
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,560
lf you try to feel me up,
l'll have to slug you.

226
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,920
lf you make me listen to any sexist,
racist or homophobic jokes,

227
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,560
l'm gonna have to slug you.

228
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,720
And finally, l might have to slug you
from time to time

229
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,920
simply because l find the prospect
of this incredibly stressful.

230
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,240
All right, sounds like a party to me.

231
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,280
So, what shall we listen to?

232
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,240
Jewel, Sarah, Fiona?
l'm in a sensitive mood, aren't you?

233
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,800
Cut the crap. l'm already in the car.

234
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,160
All right, let's burn this baby.
New York, yeah!

235
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,400
See you, lovebirds.

236
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
H"ey, it"'s A"llie." Y"o"u g"ot the machine."

237
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,240
Allie, it's me. Listen, l am so...

238
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Desert, Santa, buzzard, tumbleweed.

239
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,160
This totally sucks.

240
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,440
You got a mean disposition
for a Santa.

241
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,800
l need to make another phone call.

242
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,640
Long distance?

243
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,520
What from here is not long distance?

244
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,920
- lt's Jake.
- Where are you?

245
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,640
l'm in the middle of nowhere,
dressed like Santa,

246
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,280
being attacked by tumbleweed.

247
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,440
- Cool.
- G"et me" D"ad."

248
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,600
- When did l become your slave?
- The day you were born.

249
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,800
Right.

250
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,480
lt's the prodigal son.

251
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,800
Hello, Father.

252
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,520
Jake, you sound funny.
Are you at the airport?

253
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,800
l've had some setbacks but if you
wire me money, l'll make it home.

254
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Just what kind of a bind are you in?

255
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,320
He's in the middle of nowhere
dressed as Santa

256
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,080
being attacked by a bumblebee.

257
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
Tumbleweed!

258
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,320
Otherwise, like she said.

259
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,480
That is the worst alibi
in a long line of bad alibis.

260
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,200
- But it's all true.
- That's what you always say.

261
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,600
l know, but l really need your help
to make it home on time.

262
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,120
Look, we had a deal.

263
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,560
lt is up to you to get home
on Christmas Eve

264
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,400
or forget about the Porsche.

265
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
Excuse me.
l couldn't help overhearing.

266
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
You're trying to get home
for Christmas

267
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
and your father won't help you?

268
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,280
lt's not that, it's just...

269
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,600
He's so worried about the operation.

270
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,120
- He's not thinking clearly.
- Operation?

271
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,760
Yeah.

272
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,080
The whole family chipped in and got
him a triple bypass for Christmas.

273
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,920
l sent home every last dollar l
earned as a shopping mall Santa.

274
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,480
The operation's on Christmas Eve.

275
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Now l won't be home until after
the anaesthesia wears off.

276
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,880
Oh, dear.

277
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,120
You know, me and the girls are
driving to Vegas to see Tom Jones.

278
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,400
We're Tom Tom Girls.

279
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,080
You want to ride with us?

280
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,680
Do you have W"hat"'s N"ew", Puss"ycat"?

281
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,120
Do we have
W"hat"'s N"ew", Puss"ycat"?

282
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,200
~ W"hat"'s N"ew", Puss"ycat"?

283
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,600
Can we crack open a window?

284
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,040
Do you think it's funny

285
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,760
how easily old people
can catch pneumonia?

286
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,400
Do you think that's a joke?

287
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,040
No, it's just l had a hard night
and l'm not feeling so well.

288
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,680
Get out of there.

289
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,160
Mama's teeth have fallen
out of her mouth again.

290
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,480
Just wedge them back in, dear.

291
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,800
OK, Santa Claus.
Make yourself useful.

292
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,840
Put those right back in her mouth.

293
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,840
Gherkins, anyone?

294
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,280
For Pete's sake!

295
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
- Oh, well, that's lovely.
- What happened?

296
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,680
Santa just yammied in your handbag.

297
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
- There he goes again.
- Stop him.

298
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Get up.

299
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,960
Did l hurt you, Santa? Good.

300
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,320
All right, buster. Out you get.

301
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,560
Get out of here.

302
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,320
And take your beard with you.

303
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,920
l never heard of such a thing.
lmagine.

304
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,280
Yammying in my sister's handbag.

305
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
There you go, that's five.

306
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,080
Desert, Santa, buzzard, tumbleweed.

307
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,160
Oh, l love this game.
Which word is not like the others?

308
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,640
- Santa?
- No, idiot.

309
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,080
lt's a message Jake left
on my machine.

310
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,280
Bizarre, huh?

311
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,480
Oh, my God.

312
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,040
What's wrong with you?

313
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,840
We gotta go.
We're way behind schedule.

314
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,840
Wait!

315
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,920
This is the worst day of my life.

316
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,960
And it just got worse.

317
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,720
Ho-ho-ho, tubby.

318
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,920
Secret fat-man handshake. All right.

319
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,520
Confidentially speaking,
between us Santas,

320
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,360
don't you get tired of this suit?

321
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,320
Every year, it's the same suit.
Red, red, red.

322
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,280
Does any guy really look good in red?

323
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,360
l don't think so.

324
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,120
Got room in the sledge for two?

325
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,480
Thanks.

326
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
l really appreciate it. You're a pal.

327
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,600
You're not so cute in the morning.
l'm glad nothing happened.

328
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,040
- You just slugged me.
- As per our agreement.

329
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,600
Wake up, chief, time to feed
the reindeer.

330
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,440
All right, l'm going.

331
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,280
Merry Christmas to you too.

332
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,800
l went and killed Santa.

333
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,640
Thank God.

334
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,080
Hang on, Santa, l'm coming.

335
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,040
Hold on.

336
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,680
Am l alive?

337
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,480
l have never been happier
to answer that question.

338
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,080
Yes, you are alive.

339
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,120
- You've been asked that before?
- Maybe ten, 1 2 times.

340
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,120
- Allie, can l ask you something?
- Shoot.

341
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,800
Look, l'm a millennial type of guy.

342
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,520
l dig world music,
l think freons should be banned,

343
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,840
l'm all about yoga
and macrobiotic food.

344
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,080
l'm in touch with my inner child.

345
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,720
ls the question coming before Ohio?

346
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,320
What l'm getting at is...

347
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,640
what does Jake have
that l haven't got?

348
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,080
lt's the stuff he comes up with.

349
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
Funny things.

350
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,480
Amazing things.
Things that just give me the chills.

351
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,600
Give me an example
of one of these chills.

352
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,320
There was this one time
l was feeling really bad.

353
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,280
lt was really just a down day.

354
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,920
Jake took my hand in his
and being really sweet he said...

355
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,280
''Not even the rain
has such small hands.''

356
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,400
''Not even the rain
has such small hands?''

357
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,080
What a nerd.

358
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
lt's E.E. Cummings.

359
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,680
Poetry, Eddie.

360
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,440
That gave you chills?

361
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,080
You wouldn't understand.

362
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,440
What?

363
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,240
Not even the corn has such big ears.

364
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
That's beautiful. l'm really moved.

365
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,400
Cos if it's poetry you want,
l got it, baby.

366
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,400
There once was a man from
Nantucket...

367
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,920
Just drive the car, Eddie.

368
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,280
Man, oh, man.
l was sure you were a goner.

369
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,240
Nolan, it's been two hours. l can't
have this conversation any more.

370
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
What conversation?

371
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,120
The one where you go you were sure
l was a goner

372
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,840
and l go, that was a close one.

373
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,680
- A Pathfinder. Catch up with them.
- Who's them?

374
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,480
- My girlfriend.
- No kidding. All the way out here?

375
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,600
Wait a minute. Are you saying
that's Mrs Claus in that car?

376
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,000
With another guy?

377
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,960
Mrs Claus stepping out on Santa?

378
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,280
Letting some other guy
down the chimney?

379
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,680
Why, that two-timing ho!

380
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,920
Nolan, reality check.

381
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,600
Say no more, Santa. l'm after them.

382
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,000
Nolan, l said catch them,
try not to kill us.

383
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,920
There's a cop behind us. Slow down.

384
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,520
Cops make me nervous.
l'm gonna make a run for it.

385
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,840
Are you nuts?

386
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,920
Daddy always said, it's better
to go out in a blaze of glory

387
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,400
than to rot
in a state correctional facility.

388
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,640
You're about to tell me
the stuff in the back is stolen?

389
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
l won't if you don't want me to.

390
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,960
Stop the car, Nolan.

391
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,760
All right, come on, Jake. Think.

392
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,880
l know. Put this on. Act like my elf.

393
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,320
- How do elves act?
- l don't know.

394
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,720
- Happy.
- Happy?

395
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,520
Merry Christmas, officer. Problem?

396
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,360
ln a bit of a hurry, aren't you?

397
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,760
That's my fault.
Busy time of year for me.

398
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,000
- l'm an elf.
- So it seems.

399
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,040
Do you realise
you were going 9 in a 65 mph zone?

400
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
You should try catching me
in my sleigh.

401
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,040
You see, officer,
my elf Snow Puff and l

402
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,960
are heading to the children's
hospital in the next town.

403
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,560
- You mean Redcliff?
- Exactly.

404
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,480
To distribute toys to the youngsters.

405
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,360
Sorry if in my haste l sped up a bit,

406
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,160
but every second counts
to a bedridden child.

407
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,960
All right, l'll tell you what.

408
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,400
No more speeding, OK, Santa?

409
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,120
65 stay alive.

410
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,440
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, officer.

411
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,160
And that is how the big boys do it.

412
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,200
You know what?

413
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,280
My shift ends in a few minutes.

414
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,720
Follow me.
l'll get you there in no time.

415
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,720
That's how the big boys do it?

416
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,680
Shut up, Nolan.

417
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,960
So close yet so far.

418
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,200
Please stay in the car.

419
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,880
l guess he couldn't hear you.

420
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,800
Thank you, officer.

421
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,840
Do y'all mind if l go in there
with you?

422
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,080
l'd like to see the kids' faces
when you give them their gifts.

423
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,680
The more, the merrier.

424
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,160
l want a pony
and a Barbie dreamhouse...

425
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,640
That's all great stuff but Santa
will give you something better.

426
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,880
A KitchenAid Classic Plus toaster

427
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,760
with exclusive AcuToast sensor

428
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,040
for consistent toasting
time after time.

429
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,440
Sweetie, this toaster is extra wide

430
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,440
so you can get four bagels in there
instead of the usual two.

431
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,080
- Thank you, Santa.
- You're welcome.

432
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,960
Santa, this toaster was already
promised to a cowpoke named Nolan.

433
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,800
Hand it over to the kid, Snow Puff.

434
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,840
All right, let's get this line
moving. Who's next?

435
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,560
All-righty,
and what do you want for Christmas?

436
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,160
And finally... Ho-ho-ho.
Merry Christmas.

437
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,960
- What's your name, little boy?
- Esteban.

438
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,000
All right, let's see what we have
here today for Esteban.

439
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,320
Look at this.

440
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,280
A Eureka Boss cordless
rechargeable vacuum cleaner.

441
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,200
No, thank you.

442
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,360
Well...

443
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,960
l don't know what else
l have here for you, buddy.

444
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,920
What do you want for Christmas?

445
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,360
To go home.

446
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,360
l want to be with mi mama,
mi papa...

447
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,000
Grandmothers and grandfathers,

448
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,280
and my dog,
and have a Christmas tree,

449
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,840
and lights, and angels,
and Christmas cookies.

450
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,920
With little red and green sprinkles
on top,

451
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
and plum pudding,
and Christmas carols...

452
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,560
Aw, sugar doll, l miss you so much.

453
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,960
l don't want to fence stolen goods
no more.

454
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,840
l'd like you to come home.

455
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,560
Please,
you know l didn't mean to hurt you.

456
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,640
How will l get through the holidays?

457
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,440
l just needed to talk to my dad
or Tracey.

458
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,040
Are either of them there?

459
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,960
Gee, your dad and Tracey
went to the mall.

460
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,040
lt's just me, holding down the fort.

461
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,880
We are all so excited
you're coming home.

462
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,040
We've got the tree all set up.
lt looks great.

463
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,440
I'"ve" jus"t" b"een" s"ho"pp"in"g "and coo"k"in"g,
"coo"k"in"g "and" s"ho"pp"in"g.

464
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,720
Speaking of which, your sweater size,
you're a 38, right?

465
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,680
Yeah, l guess.

466
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,600
Where are you now?
Are you on your way home?

467
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,320
Yeah, look, l gotta run.

468
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,200
S"o yo"u "ta"k"e care, now." OK?

469
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,440
- OK.
- Bye.

470
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,520
Bye.

471
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,440
l gotta tell you, although l've only
been your elf for a short time,

472
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,520
l feel like a new man, changed.

473
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Do l look changed to you?

474
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,920
Maybe on the inside, where it counts.

475
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,520
That's it. l've changed
on the inside.

476
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,200
- l'm going home for Christmas.
- Home?

477
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,280
- l thought you were going east.
- Back the other way.

478
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,480
Nolan, l saved your butt back there.

479
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,400
Don't you owe me something?

480
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,640
Yes, l do.

481
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,960
Didn't mean to leave you hanging.

482
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,720
Merry Christmas.

483
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,800
- What?
- Can l have a word with you?

484
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,680
- What is it?
- lt's my wife, Marjorie.

485
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,480
She left me last month.

486
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,080
lf l got her back home for Christmas,
l know we could start again.

487
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,080
- Why are you telling me this?
- She won't listen to me.

488
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,400
l got a hunch
she might listen to Santa.

489
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,320
lf you walked into her restaurant

490
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,880
and asked her to forgive me,
she'd come home.

491
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,560
She left you, right?
So where's your dignity?

492
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,000
Don't go crawling back to her.
Let her come grovelling back.

493
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,880
Maybe you're right. Why drive to
Nebraska just to get slammed again?

494
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,280
Wait, Nebraska? As in east of here?

495
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,120
lt's about a six-hour trip.

496
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,880
What's the matter with you?

497
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,680
You married her
but you won't take a little drive?

498
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,680
Max, what did you do
that made your wife so mad

499
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,960
that she'd take a job 300 miles away?

500
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,760
l stayed at Smitty's
till 3:00 one morning.

501
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,560
That doesn't seem so bad.

502
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,640
With an old girlfriend.

503
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,120
Here's the deal.

504
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,880
lf l get Marjorie to come home,

505
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,920
you buy me a bus ticket to New York.

506
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,600
lf you can get Marjorie
to come home for Christmas,

507
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,680
l'll buy you a bus ticket
to the moon.

508
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,400
All right.

509
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,640
Looking good.

510
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,680
l got kind of a weird call
from Jake while you were out.

511
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,880
He didn't say where
he was calling from.

512
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,960
l'm pretty sure he's on the road.

513
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,600
l hope he's gonna make it.

514
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
There is not an obstacle
in this world

515
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,680
that will keep my son from this car.

516
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,120
My God, there's a scratch.

517
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,200
Where?

518
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,040
Get a life, Dad.

519
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,440
See you.

520
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,800
She's ready for you, son.

521
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,040
Wherever you are.

522
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,240
There she is, right there.

523
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,320
lsn't she the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

524
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,080
Yeah, no doubt.
What do you want me to tell her?

525
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,640
That if she doesn't come home,

526
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,120
l'll die.

527
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,480
Good. Die.

528
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,320
Now, don't you think
you're being a little bit harsh?

529
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,680
Harsh? He kissed that tramp
in front of everybody at Smitty's.

530
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,360
l'm sure it was a friendly kiss.
Brother-sister.

531
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,640
- There was tongue.
- T"here wa"s "not."

532
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,680
T"here wa"s "too, yo"u b"i"g p"i"g.

533
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,760
Everybody saw it.

534
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,480
I"t wa"s"n"'"t me" k"i"ss"in"g "her."

535
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,080
I"t wa"s "the" Jäg"ermei"s"ter."

536
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,400
We made a commitment, Max,

537
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,800
to honour and obey
for better or for worse.

538
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,880
OK, "thi"s "i"s "wor"s"e."

539
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,760
He really burns my biscuits.

540
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,640
Let me handle this one.

541
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,760
Don't you think you should give Max
another chance?

542
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,640
Maybe this is a misunderstanding.

543
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,120
He kissed her.
How do you misunderstand that?

544
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,880
l'm sure
he didn't mean to hurt you.

545
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,360
This other couple l know
were upset about a misunderstanding.

546
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,360
- What's wrong with them?
- They had a trip back east.

547
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,480
He cancelled last minute. He wanted
to take her to Cabo San Lucas.

548
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,680
She thought he was being selfish,
which was a misunderstanding.

549
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,160
No, he sounds like a jerk.

550
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,840
No, he's not.
lf she had understood,

551
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,120
she would have realised he has
a stepmother he doesn't like.

552
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,560
What's wrong with her?

553
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,440
The dad married her
ten months after his wife died.

554
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,520
She must be a babe.

555
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,240
Why is he mad at the stepmother?
lt's not her fault.

556
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,160
lsn't ten months a little soon?

557
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,080
Not if she's a babe.

558
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,960
What does this have to do
with me and Max?

559
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,520
Misunderstandings can be overcome
if both people just try.

560
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,120
Right now, Max has a broken heart.

561
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,480
All he's asking for
is a second chance.

562
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,720
Just give him another shot.

563
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,160
How's about a top-up on this coffee?

564
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,600
You know what, l've got a job to do.

565
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,520
- How did it go?
- You know what a swirly is?

566
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,720
You mean when somebody jabs your head
in a toilet bowl?

567
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,040
lt was pretty much like that.

568
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,400
Get in there
and say something romantic.

569
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,880
Something apologetic.

570
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,040
Something in English.

571
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,200
All right, already.

572
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,440
l got an idea.

573
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,960
~ Oh, Marjorie, oh, Marjorie

574
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,880
~ l need to have you home

575
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,600
~ Oh, Marjorie, oh, Marjorie

576
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,160
~ l need to have you home

577
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,200
~ l'm sorry l was just
an insensitive jerk that night

578
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:18,360
~ l hope that singing this song
will make everything all right

579
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,680
You're not the only one.

580
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,560
~ Oh, Marjorie, oh, baby

581
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,160
~ Oh, baby, oh, baby

582
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:41,520
~ l'll make it up to you on the
velvet skirt of the Christmas tree

583
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,080
~ See you're my wife
l'd give my life

584
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:04,520
~ lf you'd just come home

585
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,600
Now on your knees.

586
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,520
~ Now on your knees...

587
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,360
Do it, don't sing it!

588
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,360
l'm so sorry, baby.
Won't you please...

589
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,240
Here's your ticket.
Your bus will be here in ten minutes.

590
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,600
Well, see you.

591
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,160
- Hey, Santa.
- Yeah?

592
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,640
l hope that other couple you know

593
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,000
works through their
misunderstandings.

594
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,640
Me too.

595
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,560
What other couple?

596
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,040
lt doesn't matter.
lt's just you and me, baby.

597
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,160
You know what l've always wondered?

598
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,800
What?

599
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,040
Out of all the planets
in the universe,

600
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,640
how is it that this is the only one
that spawned intelligent life?

601
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,680
Yeah.

602
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,640
You know what l always wonder about?

603
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
What?

604
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,000
How come more breakfast joints
don't serve you food in the skillet.

605
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,760
Like Betty's.

606
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,560
They give you your meat,
eggs, spuds in the pan.

607
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,800
That rocks.

608
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,400
Like when a homeless guy
says he's the messiah.

609
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,920
Then he asks for money
and you want to walk away.

610
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,920
Then you think to yourself,
what if he is the messiah

611
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,920
and l'm just blowing the dude off?

612
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,040
Think about it.

613
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,440
l take back what l said
about intelligent life on earth.

614
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,880
Hey, look at that.

615
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,040
Velveeta! Come on, now.

616
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,360
That's why we have to stay there.

617
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,600
Come on, where would you rather go?
Another dumpy motel

618
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,400
or a fake Bavarian village
in the middle of nowhere?

619
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,840
l don't think it's Eddie.

620
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,040
l think it's totally Eddie.

621
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,640
lt's completely cheesy
and trying to be cool.

622
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,160
When will you stop
being mean to the Ed Man?

623
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,400
When you stop referring to yourself
in the third person.

624
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,680
Maybe l should just go with it.

625
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,400
Check this out.
Tell me what's better.

626
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,960
Merry Christmas.

627
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,800
Well, the first one's good
for really little kids,

628
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,760
like my sister, who's three.

629
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,640
The second one's good for big kids
like my friends and me.

630
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,400
The third one's good
if you want to scare people

631
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,480
and watch them run away screaming.

632
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,400
- OK, cool, thanks.
- Whatever.

633
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,480
".."N"ew" Y"or"k, N"ew" Y"or"k "d"u"e in..."

634
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,680
Look at that.

635
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,400
The clock man
is sexually harassing the clock lady.

636
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,000
How typical.

637
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,440
Don't witness it.
You might have to testify.

638
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,480
Wow, Eddie, that was actually clever.

639
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,600
l'm a witty guy.

640
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,040
You think this astonishing physique
is all the Ed Man has to offer?

641
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,400
Well, take this, Ed Man.

642
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,760
Oh, my God, you're so dead.
You're gonna get it so bad.

643
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,320

l think you just stopped being mean
to me.

651
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,800
- Excuse me. Conway?
- Get behind the yellow line.

652
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,920
- Just a second. l need a favour.
- Behind the yellow line!

653
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,760
l realise you're on a schedule,
it being the holidays.

654
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,760
Would you take a detour to Edelbrück?

655
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,960
l think everyone would enjoy it.

656
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,800
But l wouldn't.

657
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,880
- What if we...?
- No.

658
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,240
No, got it.

659
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,960
That is very good. Look at that.

660
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,840
Sorry we only had one room left
tonight, it being Christmas.

661
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,120
You'll find that it's very special.

662
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,320
Wilkommen to your honeymoon suite.

663
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,560
ls this yours?

664
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,280
No. Not yours either?

665
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,160
Then whose is it?

666
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,720
''Human liver?''

667
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,760
''Organ donation?''
My God, we've got a live liver here.

668
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,520
''Deliver to Allie Henderson in
Edelbrück ASAP.''

669
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,320
- Think it's real?
- Take a look.

670
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,680
We need to get to Edelbrück.

671
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,480
OK, everybody sit down.

672
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,600
What is wrong with you?

673
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,160
- Behind the yellow line.
- Don't give me your lip.

674
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,920
l don't believe you. A girl in
Edelbrück needs a liver transplant.

675
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,440
We got a schedule to keep.

676
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,480
- Schedule schmedule.
- Shame on you.

677
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,720
This isn't about schedules, man.

678
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,960
lt's the gift of life,
the greatest Christmas gift ever.

679
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,360
We even have Santa
to bring it to her.

680
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,240
This is a non-stop bus to New York.

681
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,880
This is happening for a reason.

682
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,160
We were put on this bus
to take this organ to Edelbrück.

683
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,040
You think l don't care
about that little girl? You're wrong.

684
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,840
We're going to Edelbrück
but because l say we are.

685
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,800
Everybody, behind the yellow line
and sit down.

686
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,160
lt's funny, Eddie.

687
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,080
l never thought l'd end up
in the same bed with you.

688
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,600
Yet, somehow with you here,
l feel safe.

689
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,280
Want me to put on any more clothes?

690
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,120
No, that should be fine.

691
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,280
l'm giving you ten minutes.

692
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,920
You find that girl, Santa!

693
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,000
Go, Santa!

694
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,440
Everybody, sit down.

695
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,040
Can you tell me
if there is an Allie Henderson here?

696
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,400
Sorry, Santa, l'm not allowed
to give out information on guests.

697
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,960
Listen, l have a full plate
of activities tonight,

698
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,600
not to mention a pesky grinch
who was kidnapped Mrs Claus.

699
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,160
l'm sorry, Santa, but that's policy.

700
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,120
Policy? Policy does not apply to me.
l override policy.

701
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,320
l want to know
where my girlfriend is.

702
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,520
Maintenance.

703
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,480
Where is he?

704
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,120
What are you doing here?

705
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,040
Why are you dressed like Santa Claus?

706
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,600
l had to hijack a bus.

707
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,600
Eddie and his buddies
left me in the desert like this.

708
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,400
Desert, Santa, buzzard, tumbleweed.

709
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,080
What gives with you
kissing that slimy moron?

710
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,040
- lt's not what you think.
- What are you doing here?

711
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,280
- This lovenest is full.
- Calm down, nothing happened.

712
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,200
Whoa, where's the trust, man?

713
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,880
l saw you kissing her on TV,
you dirtbag.

714
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,840
He got me under the mistletoe
for two seconds, big deal.

715
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,920
lt was more like five seconds.

716
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,160
And they were good.

717
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,160
Foul. Fighting foul.

718
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,880
How could you let that idiot
give you a ride?

719
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,680
l thought you left me high and dry.

720
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,360
What was l supposed to do?
Beam myself home.

721
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,840
l was stuck in the desert.
l couldn't get to you.

722
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,400
l had no choice.

723
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,880
OK, l forgive you.

724
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,000
So, are you still mad at me?

725
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,480
Yo, if anyone should be mad here,
it should be me.

726
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,640
l had to listen to Natalie Merchant
and Easy Cummings.

727
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,840
EE Cummings.

728
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,240
l've been stuck in a Santa suit
for two days

729
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,640
fighting off buzzards, dentures
and thugs in lederhosen.

730
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,480
l'm tired, l'm hungry, l stink.

731
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,200
Because of you, l'm not going
to be home by 6:00 tonight.

732
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,840
Why do you have to be home by 6:00?

733
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,320
What's that?

734
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,480
You heard.
Why do you have to be home by 6:00?

735
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,760
Because that's when dinner
will be ready?

736
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,720
lf you had even one decent chromosome
in your DNA,

737
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,400
you will not lie to me.

738
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,200
All right.

739
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,880
lt's just that, if l get home by then

740
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,520
my dad's gonna give me the Porsche.

741
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,920
Wait.

742
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,720
So you didn't trade Cabo for me,
you traded it for a car.

743
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,280
- lt's not like that.
- You deserve each other.

744
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,960
Allie, wait.

745
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,040
Will you stop and listen to me?

746
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,200
lf l had to do it all over again,
l probably wouldn't mention the car.

747
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,840
What? l was kidding.

748
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,720
You don't care about anybody.

749
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,600
You're a manipulator and a liar.

750
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,040
- l am not a liar.
- Wait a minute.

751
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,080
You're the transplant girl?

752
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,000
ls that what Santa told you?

753
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Right.

754
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,680
- l'm taking his place on the bus.
- Give me another chance.

755
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,240
- Why?
- Because l care about you.

756
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,640
You gotta believe me.

757
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,840
lf you showed up
in a one-horse open sleigh,

758
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,520
l wouldn't believe you.

759
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,400
l'm sorry.

760
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,120
l can't take fake remorse

761
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,920
from a fake Santa
making fake apologies.

762
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,800
You might be a fake boyfriend.

763
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,080
l tell you,
you're a genuine butthole.

764
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,400
~ l got rolled

765
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,200
~ The one l love is gone

766
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,880
~ l got rolled...

767
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,200
Man, l've seen guys get dumped
but that was nuclear.

768
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,560
She wasn't even aiming at me
and l'll be walking funny for a week.

769
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,360
How do girls do that?

770
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,720
lts like that whole chick
verbal skills thing. lt's deadly.

771
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,600
Man, l gotta tell you, bro,

772
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,880
l would never have thought
l'd help you out.

773
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,800
After that massacre,
l just wouldn't be human.

774
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,240
God, l never thought
l'd drive home with you.

775
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,200
- lt's pretty wild.
- Sure is.

776
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,600
All right, l get back in time
to get the Porsche.

777
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,040
l drive it back in January.

778
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,440
Figure out how to get Allie back.
Everything will be great.

779
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,600
Thanks, Ed Man.

780
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,800
Sure.

781
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,200
- Get out.
- What?

782
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,520
All that stuff.

783
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,640
Sorry, man, l just can't do that much
good stuff for another person.

784
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,760
lt'd be bad for my rep.

785
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,520
What are you talking about?

786
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,840
What about that stuff you said
about being human?

787
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,640
l just took you to Wisconsin.

788
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,320
Besides, what am l doing
helping you out

789
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,320
so you can get a Porsche
and be cooler than me?

790
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,080
Not very smart.

791
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,600
Not very Eddie.

792
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,760
You're gonna have to take that off.

793
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,840
Yeah, l know that.

794
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,520
Father Christmas, just tell me
what you want from me.

795
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,400
Better hurry.

796
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,920
lt's called carbo-loading.

797
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,440
Best thing you can do
before a race like this.

798
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,800
Hi, l'd like a number, please.

799
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,200
OK, that'll be a $1 0 entrance fee.

800
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,960
You know, l mailed that in.

801
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,240
Oh, OK, so we sent you a receipt.

802
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,160
Yes, you did, but, you see,
here's the dilly.

803
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,760
There was a house fire.
Everything got torched.

804
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,360
- Personal papers.
- Excuse me.

805
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,960
The clay handprint ashtray
l made at three.

806
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,320
Tragic tale. l'll cover the kid.

807
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,960
Thanks. Jake Wilkinson.

808
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,440
Jeff Wilson.

809
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,440
Your hat and beard.

810
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,520
You've got to have them on
when you cross the finish line.

811
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,880
Here we go again.

812
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,800
Can anyone in this race actually run?

813
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,160
Sparky Fanoloni won the state
marathon ten years ago.

814
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,440
That was before the two-pack-a-day
habit and the lung removal.

815
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,600
This guy will give us a run
for his money.

816
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,920
- Kenyan?
- Yes.

817
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,240
A"ll" S"anta"s "to the" s"ta"rt"in"g "line."

818
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,680
See you at the finish line.

819
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,800
Go, Santas, go!

820
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,400
S"anta"s, "to yo"u"r mar"ks.

821
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,520
O"n yo"u"r mar"ks.

822
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,520
G"et" s"et."

823
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,480
Hey, Jingleballs.

824
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,760
Move your candy canes.

825
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,000
Come on, guys, keep going.

826
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,880
Want a cookie?

827
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,080
That's the end of that.

828
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,960
Or not.

829
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,640
Looks like it's you and me now.

830
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,640
- Ready to run for it?
- l was born ready.

831
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,240
Your hat!

832
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,200
Congratulations.

833
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,800
Jake, thank God.
They're gonna try to arrest me.

834
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,000
Come down and meet me
at the station.

835
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,840
Taxi.

836
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,520
Santa says, take me to the airport.

837
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,040
Hey, there.

838
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,720
Hey, you're the kid who beat
Mayor Wilson in the Santa 5K.

839
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,120
Yep, that's me.

840
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,560
- Wait a minute. Mayor Wilson?
- You didn't know?

841
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,920
He wins every year. A lot of us folks
wish he'd won this year too.

842
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,480
He seemed a good guy.

843
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,400
Keeps the potholes filled?

844
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,880
He also donates his entire winnings
every year

845
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,920
to buy turkeys
for people who can't afford them.

846
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,880
He had to be the man.

847
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,720
Can you turn around, please?

848
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,920
l'll be right back.

849
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,760
When did Santa start
using the mailbox?

850
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,400
Didn't you hear
about the new exchange program?

851
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,880
The postman will come down
your chimney later.

852
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,000
You got someplace to go?

853
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,080
Yeah, it's Christmas Eve.
Who doesn't?

854
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,120
l could set a place for you.

855
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,480
No, thanks. l'll be fine.

856
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,240
- Merry Christmas.
- You too.

857
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,680
Yes, operator,
it's collect from Jake.

858
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,000
Tracey, accept the... Thank you.

859
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,200
My, dear brother,
you are sounding slightly stressed.

860
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,280
ls it the bumblebees again?

861
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,400
Tracey, l'm not going make it home.
l want you to tell Dad.

862
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,920
What do you mean
you're not going to make it home?

863
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,960
- ls this about Carolyn?
- No.

864
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,720
lt's about being stuck in the middle
of nowhere with no money.

865
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,040
At the rate l'm going,
l'll show up in January.

866
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,480
Merry Christmas,
Happy New Year, see you.

867
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,560
W"ait." W"hat a"b"o"u"t the" P"or"s"che"?

868
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,120
- What about it?
- You really must be in trouble.

869
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,960
Would you fly home now if you could?

870
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,680
Like, yeah.

871
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,600
l've got four years of birthday money
upstairs in my ballerina bag.

872
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,800
lf l went to a ticket agent now
and bought you a ticket home,

873
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,760
you'd make it in time for Christmas?

874
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,360
You'd do that for me?

875
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,760
No.

876
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,360
l'd do it for Dad.

877
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,280
Plus, think of the pleasure l'll have

878
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,040
holding this over your head
for the rest of our lives.

879
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,920
OK, whatever you want.

880
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,600
l'm near Madison, Wisconsin.
l'll hitch a ride to the airport.

881
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,280
Wait, l don't have lD.
How will l pick up the ticket?

882
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,440
l know. l'll make up a secret
password that only you would know.

883
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,160
Great, what?

884
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,800
l am a smelly and revolting jerk
who doesn't deserve to live.

885
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,360
Bingo. Wilkinson, Jake.

886
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,880
- lt's an unusual password.
- Unusual everything.

887
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,160
- What time's the flight leave?
- 20 minutes.

888
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,080
- l'll need a picture lD.
- l just gave you my password.

889
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,560
Right, but l can't let you on the
plane without proper lD.

890
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,480
What was the point of my password?

891
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,080
- l don't make the rules, it's...
- Policy, l know.

892
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,760
Thank you.

893
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,960
Next.

894
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,440
Good Ringo.
Merry Christmas to you, too.

895
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,200
Bad Ringo.

896
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,800
Hey, a dog.

897
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,680
Excuse me.

898
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,000
Merry Christmas, Santa. Got a ticket?

899
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,520
No.

900
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,520
T"hi"s "i"s P"elham."

901
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,600
N"e"x"t" s"to"p, N"ew" R"ochelle",
"followed" b"y" L"archmont..."

902
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,160
Even a bribe couldn't get him home.

903
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,400
He still has 1 5 minutes.

904
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,560
Lady, give me a ride? Please?

905
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,000
Give Santa a ride?

906
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,480
Will anybody take me to Larchmont?

907
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,680
Hi, Santa Claus.

908
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,680
Wait, don't turn left.

909
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,240
Don't turn. Go straight.

910
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,000
The package people,
do not unwrap yourselves.

911
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,000
l repeat, do not unwrap yourselves.

912
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,800
You unwrap yourself,
you are out of my parade.

913
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,880
Do l make myself clear?

914
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,280
- All right.
- What do you think you're doing?

915
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,760
Buddy.

916
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,760
l could have sworn
l parked that sleigh here.

917
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,760
~ All is calm

918
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,720
~ All is right

919
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:49,040
~ Round yon Virgin,
Mother and Child...

920
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,880
Sorry.

921
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,520
Come on, Jake. You can make it.

922
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,880
Nice ride.

923
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,680
Thanks.

924
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,760
Just got him back from the shop.

925
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,880
The elves upgraded his shoes
to the new Firestone radials.

926
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,840
Not bad.

927
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,560
Maybe you should have thought
about snow tyres.

928
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,720
You said even if Santa showed up
in a one-horse open sleigh,

929
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,480
you still wouldn't believe
that l cared about you.

930
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,880
So l don't expect this to work.

931
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,600
But l gotta give it a shot.

932
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,680
You know, l'm not the real Santa.

933
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,240
Contrary to all appearances,
this is not a real sleigh.

934
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,400
But, Allie, for all the times
l've been a genuine jerk...

935
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,480
this is a real apology.

936
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,720
lf you'll accept it.

937
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,920
l might.

938
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,800
And this...

939
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,240
is a real kiss.

940
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,040
Come with me to my house.
l have two minutes.

941
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,080
- This isn't about the Porsche?
- Come on.

942
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,560
- l don't want...
- Trust me.

943
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,840
~ Shepherds quake

944
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,480
~ At the...

945
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,720
Let's eat.

946
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,880
What time is it?

947
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,240
lt's 5:59.

948
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,280
You made it.

949
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,720
Yeah, l guess l did.

950
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,800
Tell me when it's after 6:00, OK?

951
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,600
What do you mean,
aren't you going in?

952
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,600
No, not yet.

953
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,400
But l thought...

954
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,440
- Just watch.
- Watch what?

955
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,760
My family.

956
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,080
l guess it's about time
l went home for Christmas.

957
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,760
Care to join me?

958
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,160
You bet.

959
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,800
Hey, everybody! Merry Christmas.

960
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,080
He made it.

961
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,240
You made it.

962
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,800
- l'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

963
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,600
- Hard time getting here?
- Piece of cake.

964
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,320
- What's with the Santa suit?
- Long story.

965
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,120
You stink.

966
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,400
Farting dog, cargo hold,
longer story.

967
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,320
Son...

968
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,120
She's yours.

969
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,080
But l didn't make it home on time.

970
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,600
You were seconds late.

971
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,600
A deal's a deal.
Besides, she isn't ready yet.

972
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,960
What do you mean?

973
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,720
We're not really finished fixing her
up yet, are we?

974
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,160
l'm sure it'll take a bunch more
Christmases to get the work done.

975
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,080
Don't you think?

976
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,400
30 or 40 at least.

977
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,760
36.

978
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,760
- Excuse me?
- My sweater size. l'm a 36.

979
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,640
Or a medium. Either will work.

980
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,760
What's yours?

981
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,480
- Mine?
- Yeah, for future information.

982
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,120
Eight.

983
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,520
l'll remember that.

984
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,560
What is that?

985
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,240
That would be my parade.

986
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,320
- Your parade?
- Excuse me?

987
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,960
Wait a minute, that's our sleigh.

988
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,200
That's the guy. Come on.

989
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,240
Let's get him.

990
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,760
Buddy, you stole our sleigh.

991
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,720
You're lucky you're wearing
that suit.

992
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,000
A few days ago,
l might not have agreed with you.

993
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,000
Nice wings.

994
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,240
Thanks.

995
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,280
- l took a sewing class.
- lt shows.

996
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,040
Peace.

997
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,520
Santa, give me a ride home.

998
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,000
Let's all go for a ride.

999
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,560
l love it. l've never been
in a sleigh before.

1000
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,760
Make this buggy rip, bro.
