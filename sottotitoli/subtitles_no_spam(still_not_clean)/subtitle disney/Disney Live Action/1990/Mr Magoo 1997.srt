1
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,308
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again.

2
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:33,908
Another day in the can.

3
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:36,708
Good night, Mrs Wonderbottom.

4
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:39,628
Ugliest hairdo I've ever seen.

5
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:49,268
Hold the elevator!
Aha!

6
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:50,828
Express elevator.

7
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:53,948
Elevator with a view!

8
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:58,668
Now that's what I call
an express.

9
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:01,428
Good Godfrey! Earthquake!

10
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:03,228
Don't panic, everyone.

11
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:06,828
We've got enough canned food here
to cover any emergency.

12
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:08,748
That's better.

13
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:12,908
Carry on, boys.

14
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:20,508
Parking lot. Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:24,108
Whoopsie.

16
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:26,628
By George, somebody fix the lights...

17
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:28,948
before anyone trips.

18
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:32,388
The escalator to the parking lot.

19
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:35,068
Such sophistication!

20
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:57,988
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.

21
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:01,748
Right turn only.

22
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:06,668
Road hog!

23
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:14,428
Blasted potholes!

24
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,468
The checkered flag?

25
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:20,668
Magoo, you, you speed demon, you!

26
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:23,228
You've still got it.

27
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:28,188
El Nino's back.

28
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:33,628
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again.

29
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,708
And tonight, Quincy Magoo,
the canned vegetable king...

30
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:40,268
will dedicate the new museum wing
he has donated to the city.

31
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:43,588
The Magoo Rotunda will house
a travelling exhibit...

32
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,268
of the treasures of Kuristan...

33
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:49,588
including the rarest of all rubies,
the Star of Kuristan.

34
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:54,748
Treat her gently, young fella.

35
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:57,628
Check underneath. I think
there's something rattling there.

36
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,068
Yes, you dropped the keys, my boy.

37
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,508
It's the most precious ruby
in the world.

38
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:11,348
- Lovely.
- It's just gorgeous.

39
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:14,348
- It's exquisite.
- Exquisite.

40
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:16,908
No. Actually it's corundum.

41
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,788
That's an aluminum oxide.

42
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:22,548
Okay, don't take my word for it.

43
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,788
Exquisite is an adjective,
not an element.

44
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:30,988
All right. If you're so smart,
how come Mr. Cloquet told me...

45
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,148
to watch you like a hawk?

46
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,908
Cloquet said that?

47
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,748
Why is it that someone always seems
to burn the rumaki?

48
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,748
Maybe you should see
another eye doctor.

49
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,468
Waldo, Hiram has been my optometrist
since I was a small boy in knee pants.

50
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:03,548
He's like 2,000 years old.
All his other patients are dead.

51
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:04,988
You can't hold that against him.

52
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,028
But he's still making appointments
with them.

53
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,508
Trust me, you need a second opinion.

54
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,988
Oh, my gosh!

55
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,308
- Would you, would you look at that!
- What?

56
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:18,268
Wait, don't look. Don't look.

57
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,188
- What?
- She's coming this way.

58
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:23,188
Mr. Magoo?

59
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:29,148
I am Stacey Sampanahoditra
of the Kuristani foreign office.

60
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,348
Oh. This is my nephew Waldo.

61
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:34,508
Waldo Magoo. It is an honor.

62
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:37,828
Oh.

63
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,468
Uh, you'll have to forgive him
sometimes.

64
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:43,628
He gets like that, lost in thought.
Quite a scholar, you know.

65
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,388
Graduated with a large class.

66
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:48,188
Isn't that right, Waldo?
Waldo?

67
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:49,628
Waldo!

68
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:57,954
Yeah. I-I, I w-went there to college.

69
00:04:58,126 --> 00:04:59,388
Oh.

70
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:05,988
Uh, Waldo, why don't you invite,
uh, Stacey to our opera tomorrow night?

71
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:07,988
I would be most honored, sir.

72
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:09,308
Stacey...

73
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:12,548
will you join us
for the opera tomorrow night?

74
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:14,988
It's a, uh, benefit performance.

75
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,348
Uh, we're doing excerpts
from the Norsemen saga.

76
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,988
I look forward to it.
Please excuse me.

77
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:22,988
I must greet diplomats.

78
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,708
That's a very attractive young lady.

79
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:30,828
But I'm, I'm such a fool.
I-I tried to offer her a snack.

80
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:35,068
Oh, Waldo, don't be so hard on yourself.
Cupid makes fools of us all.

81
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,708
And now, as curator of this museum...

82
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:41,548
it is my pleasure
to present our benefactor...

83
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:45,828
a man of great vision,
Quincy Magoo.

84
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:52,028
- Step right this way, sir.
- Ah, well, thank you, thank you.

85
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:56,268
Ah, well, may, uh, may all
of the exhibits in this hall...

86
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,068
chime with the light
of human knowledge.

87
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:02,339
My dear, thank you.
Thank you.

88
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:03,388
Hey!

89
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:05,988
Look out! Watch out!

90
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,668
Oh, yes.

91
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:16,588
Great Scott!

92
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,748
What is this, indoor fireworks?

93
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:22,188
What a wonderful touch.

94
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,148
Excuse me.

95
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:26,588
Or a blackout.

96
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:29,501
I should inform the power company here.

97
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:32,508
Get that fixed,
and get these lights back on.

98
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,868
Hello down here.
Public telephone.

99
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,948
Oh, what... Excuse me, sir.
We have an emergency...

100
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,428
Great Scott!

101
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:46,188
We have an injured man here.
Bandaged from head to foot.

102
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:48,268
Help. Some assistance, please.

103
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:51,348
And whoever did it
has stolen the telepho...

104
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:02,068
God! They gave me a bad mask.

105
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,748
Okay. Go.

106
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,900
I gotta watch her like a hawk.

107
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,100
Morgan!

108
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,860
You just, uh, you just hang on.
I'll get you some medical attention.

109
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,100
You stay right here.
No, you're in no condition...

110
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,700
Oh, well.
How many times must I tell you?

111
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,620
Stay back in the booth, man.

112
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,140
I'll take care of him.

113
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,620
I'll be back. I'll get some help
or maybe find a telephone.

114
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,060
Freeze! Drop the gun.

115
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,340
Turn around.

116
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,860
Yes, sure.
Must be a phone out there somewhere.

117
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,420
Morning, Angus.

118
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,220
Avast, Angus.
Are you ready to cast off?

119
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,860
Waldo? What are you doing here?

120
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,580
Oh, just cleaning your windshield.

121
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,340
Aha, my boy, you are a prince,
but I have a date with a flounder.

122
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,700
- Anchors aweigh.
- Anchors aweigh.

123
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,980
Oh, the windshield did need cleaning,
huh? Right, Angus?

124
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,900
I don't think I've seen it
this clear since 1956.

125
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,980
Well, now that you're here,
we'd better inform the police.

126
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,100
Orders, U.S. State Department.

127
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,820
This incident is to remain
completely under wraps.

128
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,260
Which includes the crazy 9-1-1 call
about a bandaged man in the museum.

129
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,380
We substitute a replica
of the jewel and...

130
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,660
And we open the exhibit
as if nothing has happened.

131
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,580
Hold it. Who the hell are you?
And who told the State Department?

132
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,020
I did. They said they would send two
of their very best operatives.

133
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,580
Gustave Anders, CIA.

134
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,660
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

135
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,260
Chuck Stupak, FBI, and
I'm in charge of this investigation.

136
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,260
The CIA has no jurisdiction
on American soil.

137
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,860
This could very well become
an international incident.

138
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,540
Not if you don't get in my way,
fancy pants.

139
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:19,660
Hmm?

140
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:23,020
Oh.

141
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,820
I don't get it.
There's nothing in the papers.

142
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,580
It's a trap.

143
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,300
They're trying to lull us
into a false sense of security...

144
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,060
and then bust us
when we make a careless move.

145
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,620
We'll never make it to Cloquet's.
They're onto us, Luanne.

146
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,820
- I can feel it in my...
- Morgan, that's yesterday's paper.

147
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,740
Oh.

148
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,460
Nothing like the old sea air
to clean out the pipes.

149
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,940
Huh? Right, Angus?

150
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,820
The sun is a little hot.
Time to apply the old Ban de Soleil.

151
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,020
There we go.

152
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,420
Oh. A very refreshing,
minty fragrance.

153
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,340
Ah, the French.
They think of everything.

154
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,860
What's that? The old fog
rolling in, thick as pea soup?

155
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,340
Not my pea soup, mind you,
but maybe one of those other brands.

156
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,220
Bob, why steal the Star for your boss,
Cloquet, and get peanuts for it...

157
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,580
when he can turn around
and auction it off for millions?

158
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,140
Why not auction it off ourselves?

159
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,860
That way we get millions
and each other.

160
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,900
Me and you?

161
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,260
I could take you to places
you've never been before.

162
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,420
I've never been to Toronto.

163
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,180
I know a little cosy
bed-and-breakfast place in Toronto...

164
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,620
but we could skip the breakfast part.

165
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,780
Come on, Angus. We won't let
a little fog stop us, huh?

166
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,820
You rotten seagulls!

167
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,260
You con-sarned buzzards, you!

168
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,580
Uncivilized behaviour.
I'd never do anything like that to you.

169
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
I'm gonna have to get this
dry-cleaned now.

170
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,580
Blast your...

171
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,020
Ho-ho-ho. I've got a strike.

172
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,100
Well, shiver my timbers!
It's a lunker!

173
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,180
Just call me Ishmael.

174
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,300
It's Moby Dick!

175
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,300
Why, look at that... Look at...

176
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,060
Look at that, Angus.
It's huge.

177
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,100
He was a big one, Angus.

178
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Just look at the size
of those, uh, uh, pants.

179
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,580
Well, I'd say we were in
the Bermuda Triangle...

180
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,260
but we're nowhere near Bermuda.

181
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,220
I'll just play it safe
and head for shore.

182
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,780
Well, Angus, here we are in safe harbor
once again.

183
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,420
Well, an escalator to the top.

184
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,660
How swank.

185
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,740
Must be a yacht club.

186
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,420
Angus?

187
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,860
Angus, where are you, boy?

188
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,140
Well, hello, Angus.
Come on there, fella.

189
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,100
We believe Magoo created a diversion
while his accomplices stole the jewel.

190
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,620
But why? Mr. Magoo
is a very wealthy man.

191
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,980
Are you sure about that? People do eat
a lot more fresh food these days.

192
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,540
Okay, we don't collar Magoo.
We put him under surveillance.

193
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,820
But this is absurdity. I'm to be
his guest at the opera tonight.

194
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,700
Great! You can be our inside person.

195
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,980
That is, if it's all right
with the FBI.

196
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,300
So, Magoo has the Star of Kuristan.

197
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
But it was Luanne's fault!

198
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,220
She double-crossed us.

199
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,300
I shouldn't have hired her.

200
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,220
But she's the only one capable
of stealing the Star.

201
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,180
How could someone with such beauty...

202
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,580
be so treacherous?

203
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,140
I worship all that is beautiful,
Morgan.

204
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,820
The greatest sin is to destroy
a thing of beauty.

205
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,820
I fear now we must destroy
the beautiful Miss Le Seur.

206
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,780
Kill her.

207
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,620
But first, get the stone, all right?

208
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,300
Tomorrow buyers are arriving from
all over the world to bid on the ruby.

209
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,820
Schmidt. Gosher. Havzinski.

210
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,380
I hear there's a rumor
Ortega Peru might even show.

211
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,100
The Piranha?
The king of the underworld?

212
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,420
I'm coming. On my way!

213
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,940
- Hello, sir.
- Um, oh, Stacey!

214
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,740
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

215
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,300
I thought that Waldo was going to pick
you up, uh, on the way to the opera.

216
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,660
Well, in my country, the invitee
always picks up the inviter.

217
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,180
I'm sure that Waldo
would not have it any other way.

218
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,740
Unc, I need to borrow a tie.

219
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,180
- Oh, hi, Stacey.
- Hello, Waldo.

220
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Uh, why don't you, uh, show Stacey
the garden before you leave?

221
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,780
It's quiet and, uh, and peaceful...

222
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,580
and, uh, intimate.

223
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,180
I, I, I don't think
she'd want to see the...

224
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,500
I'd love to see more
of your charming home.

225
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,340
All right. It's, uh...
It's right back here.

226
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,180
The smell of rice is in the air.

227
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,660
Love in bloom,
if ever I've seen it before.

228
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,260
Angus? Come on, now.
How many times...

229
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,500
have I told you
to stay out of that closet?

230
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,380
Come on in here, boy.
Help me with my scales.

231
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,660
It's my uncle's work.

232
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,300
Oh.

233
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,140
Never have I seen
such a plant sculpture.

234
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,380
Topiary's kind of a hobby of his.

235
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,980
And he specializes in the abstract.

236
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,420
Oh, no.
That's a bunny rabbit.

237
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,500
Hey, well. What...
What is... What is that?

238
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,020
Oh. So you want to play fetch again?
Is that it?

239
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,420
Ah, well, it's a dog's life.

240
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,740
Here we go.
There it goes.

241
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,620
Your uncle, do you think
he needs glasses?

242
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,660
Oh, and how!
Just don't try and tell him that.

243
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,780
He will not spend the money?
I notice he drives a very old car.

244
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
Is his business not healthy?

245
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,060
Oh, no. No.
He just loves that old car.

246
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,620
And if Unc loves something,
he won't let it go.

247
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,060
Angus! Stop terrorizing the squirrels.

248
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,900
- Stupak!
- Where are you?

249
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,140
Right behind you.
Don't turn around.

250
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,060
Just spotted a conspicuous white male.

251
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,420
Dirty clothes, needs a haircut.

252
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
- Sticks out like a sore thumb.
- Where is he? Can't see him. Over.

253
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,580
Right behind you.
Turn around. Don't turn around.

254
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,327
- Walk backwards.
- What?

255
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:21,472
Walk backwards.

256
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,580
More! More.

257
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,500
More. Stop.

258
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,220
- Where?
- Look to your left.

Uh, uh, may I help you?

263
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,300
Oh, that voice.

264
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,620
The timbre! The tone!

265
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,660
It belongs to the world,
but for the moment it's mine alone.

266
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,540
And I tremble.

267
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,860
Prunella.

268
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,620

- Uh, yes.

269
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,860
And, uh, you are, um...

270
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,260
Prunella. Prunella Pagliacci,
reporter for "The Opera News."

271
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,460
Prunella. I knew a young lady once
named Prunella.

272
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,380
Mr. Magoo, w-will you consent
to an interview?

273
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,860
Well, why not? Uh, back here,
uh, tonight, after the show.

274
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,100
Oh. No, I, I wouldn't want to share you
with all of your well-wishers.

275
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,300
Oh, well, uh, uh, uh,
a private, uh, rendezvous.

276
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,100
Uh, a walk on the beach
at, uh, Sandy Cove...

277
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,820
uh, shall we say, noon tomorrow?

278
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,960
I'll be there early.

279
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,037
Be wonderful tonight.

280
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,940
Well, uh...

281
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,100
Great Scott!
Uh, did you hear that, Angus?

282
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,300
She doesn't want to share me
with anyone.

283
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,180
Is it possible after all these years,
another duet at last?

284
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,220
"O Solo Mio" no more.

285
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,100

302
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,380

the Van Cliburn award was mine.

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,220
Oh, me, too. It's just,
just been such a thrill...

312
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,980
to hear the story of your life in song,
Mr. Magoo, I mean real...

313
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,580
Oh, please, please, please, dear.
Call me Quincy.

314
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,620
Quincy, I'm really happy
I got this chance to know you.

315
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,060
I'd like to get to know you better.

316
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,820
Ah, Prunella, could this be
a new beginning?

317
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,060
- Yes, of the end.
- Of the end?

318
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,900
Uh, the end of loneliness.

319
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,260
The beginning of discovery.

320
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,460
How nice.

321
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,340
- This is a very special day, Prunella.
- Oh, for me, too, Quincy.

322
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,820
Ah, then you know that this is
the opening of the carp fishing season?

323
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,740
- Of course!
- Oh, Great Scott!

324
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,860
And I'm so happy
we're experiencing it together.

325
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,900
As am I. Eh, together, yes.
I learned that the hard way.

326
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,340
When you have something precious,
you must keep it in sight all the time.

327
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,940
Something precious,
such as, say, a jewel?

328
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,540
Yes, indeed.
The most precious jewel of all.

329
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,740
What does this jewel look like?

330
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,780
My jewel is luminous, sparkling.
A flaming red...

331
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,340
- Ruby?
- Ruby, yes!

332
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,060
- Where do you keep this ruby?
- Close to my heart.

333
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,980
Oh, Quincy.

334
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,300
Oh, I'm sorry, Quincy,
but I, I want you to kiss me.

335
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,460
Oh, well, it's, uh...

336
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,480
No, b-but not here. Someplace.
Someplace private, like a, like a boat.

337
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,100
Do you happen to have a boat?

338
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,980
Well, in two words:
"Anchors aweigh."

339
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,060
Prunella. Uh...

340
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,642
Well, my boat is just down here.

341
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:25,580
Oh.

342
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,700
Bingo!

343
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,060
Oh, no.
It's Luanne Le Seur.

344
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,020
The Black Widow.

345
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,961
She kills all of her male accomplices.
No one has ever been able to finger her.

346
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:46,420
Wow. Whoever brings her in
will get a big promotion.

347
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,940
- Maybe a book deal.
- Hey, where're you going?

348
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,900
Nothing like the warm sea air.

349
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,940
Huh? Lo... Look at that.

350
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,500
The, the fish are jumping and...

351
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,580
Look at that.
Isn't that wonderful?

352
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,620
- Dear me.
- Now, Quincy, there's an idea.

353
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,340
Why don't we do some fishing?
Where do you keep your tackle box?

354
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,940
Oh, my tackle box
is back at the house.

355
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,740
Ah, but this is wonderful.
The open sea, it's magnificent.

356
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,540
And so inspirational.
Isn't it wonderful?

357
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,980
Oh! Oh!

358
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,180
- What? What? What is it?
- I think I sprained my ankle.

359
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Oh, I'll call the emergency sea rescue.

360
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,900
Oh, no, no, no, no. I-It'll be okay.
I just need to rest it.

361
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,340
Oh, well, you, you come on up front now.
Be careful.

362
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,500
- Okay.
- We'll take care of you, and...

363
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,100
Just sit down, and I'll head
for the shore.

364
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,260
- Oh, could we go to your house?
- Ah!

365
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,220
Well, I'll put the wheel to the keel
and the gas to the mast!

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,060
Waldo, we mustn't.

371
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,820
Well, w-why not?
I-Is there someone else?

372
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,140
- It's Mr. Magoo.
- What?

373
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Your government thinks Mr. Magoo
stole the Star of Kuristan.

Well...

375
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,020

Waldo, I need your help.

Hey, we don't have a warrant...

378
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,739
so be quick about it,
or we've both had it.

379

00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,060

Ah. Well...

391
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,940
with a little more practice,
I, uh, could pop the question.

392
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,340
Quincy.

393
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,140
Oh, your house is beautiful.
Do you mind if I look around?

394
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,460
Look away. Look away.

395
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,780
I'll just put my hat
in the closet here, and...

396
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,660
May I make you a cocktail?

397
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,100
Ah, I'm famished. Do you think
you could cook us something?

398
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,020
Something hot?

399
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,900
Can I cook?

400
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,140
You may call me "Cordon Bleu" Magoo.

401
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,860
Uh, which way
to the little girls' room?

402
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,340
Ah, atop the stairs.
Let me light your way.

403
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,700
Ah, ah, your repast awaits you
down here, my dove.

404
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,700
<i>Next I want you to put some water
on to boil.</i>

405
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,355
<i>And while we're waiting for that,
let's clean about, oh...</i>

406
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,340
<i>two or three sprigs of parsley.</i>

407
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,500
Water on to boil.

408
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,420
<i>Next, pat the chicken dry.</i>

409
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,060
<i>Now, take some lemon
and rub it on the chicken.</i>

410
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,780
<i>Now, make sure you get the whole
chicken. Lift the leg if you have to.</i>

411
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,180
<i>Now, I hope you're not cheating
and using bottled lemon juice.</i>

412
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,075
<i>If you are,
it just won't taste as good.</i>

413
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,220
<i>Why? Well, no peel appeal.</i>

414
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,660
Angus, there you are, old friend.

415
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,820
Well, I can't play right now.

416
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,540
I don't have any time.

417
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,938
<i>And now, lift both legs
high into the air. Left and right.</i>

418
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,299
All right, then. Just one last time,
then you take it upstairs.

419
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,100
All right.

420
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,355
<i>Come on, don't be a slacker.
You can do it.</i>

421
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,180
<i>Lift those legs!</i>

422
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,540
<i>Left and right.
Back and forth.</i>

423
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,180
<i>One, and two, and three, and four.</i>

424
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,900
<i>Come on, you can do it.
Lift both legs high into the air.</i>

425
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,540
<i>Lift them left and right.
And left and right.</i>

426
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,980
<i>Come on, you can do it.
Lift those legs high into the air.</i>

427
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
<i>And dance!</i>

428
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,060
<i>Come on.
Get your rear into gear.</i>

429
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,260
<i>Now, don't stop
until you're ready to drop.</i>

430
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,020
<i>Now you're cookin'!</i>

431
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,580
<i>Go get some sandpaper,
and sand that sucker smooth.</i>

432
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,620
<i>You don't want any bumps
on the surface.</i>

433
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,020
<i>I recommend a medium grade paper
because...</i>

434
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,140
<i>if you use a sandpaper that's too fine,
you're gonna be at it all day.</i>

435
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,020
<i>Now, whatever you do,
do not use a metal file...</i>

436
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,380
<i>because that will shred the surface
to a pulp.</i>

437
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,460
Must be a Chinese recipe
to make the chicken tender.

438
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,260
Either that, or it's German.

439
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,260
<i>Use short, light strokes,
and watch out for surface abrasions.</i>

440
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,900
<i>Don't rush it.
These things take time.</i>

441
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,620
Unc?

442
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,740
I want him.
Magoo is goin' down!

443
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,380
- You hear me?
- What?

444
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,980
Come on!

445
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,460
<i>Now...</i>

446
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,327
after you finish drilling,
you want to make sure that
you squirt some caulk into those holes.

447
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:42,415
Unc.

448
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,500
There's something very important
we need to talk about.

449
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,900
Waldo, Waldo. How did you know?
I thought this was my little secret.

450
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,420
Then it's true!

451
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,060
Yes, and a lot of people
are in for a big surprise.

452
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,180
- Have you gone insane?
- Yes! Yes, I...

453
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,380
- You have gone insane.
- Insane. Insane with passion.

454
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,580
Their names are even the same:
Prunella.

455
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,100
- Prunella?
- Prunella.

456
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,820
Oh, oh, oh, you're talk...
You're talking... That's wonderful, Unc.

457
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,340
It's time that you met
this glorious thief...

458
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,300
who has stolen my heart.

459
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,500
Uh, I'll be right back.
Prunella!

460
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,700
Prunella!

461
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,340
Oh, my gosh!
He did do it.

462
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:32,944
Aha! There you are,
my Viking princess.

463
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,900
Come. I want you to meet someone.

464
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,420
Not now.

465
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,460
I can't wait any longer, Quincy.
I'm gonna ask you once, and only once.

466
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,020
Ah, you're going to propose!

467
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,540
Oh, my precious bonbon.

468
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,020
You read my mind.

469
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,260
You know what I came here for.
You know what I want. Give it to me.

470
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,780
Ah, you modern women.
You're so direct.

471
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,580
Angus.

472
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,700
Now what is this? Oh, we've been
playing fetch all day with this.

473
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,780
All right, boy, go ahead.

474
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,420
Hold it!

475
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,060
Unc, who is this?

476
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,340
Uh, Waldo Magoo, this is, uh,
Prunella Pagliacci.

477
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,380
I'm FBI. That man just stole
the Star of Kuristan.

478
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,980
Stole? In this house?

479
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,940
- He's heading for the driveway.
- Get up.

480
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,660
- He stole the Studebaker.
- What?

481
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
The eggplant mobile.

482
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,140
What? Watch your head.
This way.

483
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,780
Hold it! Stop or I'll shoot.

484
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,660
- Stop or I'll shoot!
- Don't worry. He's not gonna get away.

485
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,060
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

486
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,740
- Unc, there he is.
- Ah, yeah, all right.

487
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,340
- No, over there, over there.
- I see him. I see him.

488
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,420
- He's turning left.
- Left it is.

489
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,180
He's turning right.
Big truck! Big truck!

490
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,820
Hold on!

491
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,740
He's a crafty fella.
Taking evasive action. That won't work!

492
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,380
- You're not getting away.
- That's the wrong car.

493
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,980
He's back there.

494
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,660
Don't worry, my boy.
We'll catch him on the turnaround.

495
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,100
Hold on, Angus!

496
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,380
Hey, look out!

497
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,220
- Stop!
- Look out!
- Stop!

498
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,500
Don't panic, now.
We're only in some kind of tunnel.

499
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,660
Brakes! Brakes, Unc!

500
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,500
Unc, hit the brake!

501
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,860
Great Scott!
Those speed bumps. I tell ya.

502
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,900
I'll sue this city.

503
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,460
Uh, Prunella, uh, about the FBI.
You were saying?

504
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,020
Yeah, uh, uh, FBI.
I, I'm... I'm an undercover agent...

505
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,580
for the government.

506
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,500
Does this mean no story
in "The Opera News"?

507
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,420
I'm sorry I had to deceive you.

508
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,300
They think you stole
the Star of Kuristan.

509
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,540
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

510
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,180
What? They, they what?

511
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,660
That burglar in your house was really
a notorious jewel thief...

512
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,820
who works for a man
named Austin Cloquet.

513
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,300
The bureau has learned that Cloquet
plans to sell the jewel...

514
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,420
tomorrow at a secret auction
up at a ski lodge.

515
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,940
Every billionaire gangster
in the world is coming...

516
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,140
except the most powerful of them all:
Ortega Peru, The Piranha.

517
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,660
No one's ever seen him.
He never goes anywhere.

518
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,580
So if we could get someone
to impersonate Peru...

519
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,793
we could get close to the gem
and recover it.

520
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:16,898
But who?

521
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,900
We lost him right here,
and Magoo didn't return home all night.

522
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,420
Why is he always
one step ahead of me?

523
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,140
Kenyawa Tambe just charged some tickets
to a ski resort.

524
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,500
Yeah, so what?

525
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,060
Kenyawa Tambe is one
of Luanne's aliases.

526
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,020
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I just found out.

527
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,060
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

528
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,740
You know, we're supposed to be working
as a team here.

529
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,620
- You're going around behind my back.
- If the pressure's too much for you...

530
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,900
- You'll take over! You'll take over!
- Sirs!

531
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,620
I shall go with you.

532
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:57,660
No. Young lady, this is strictly a job
for professionals.

533
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,900
Then why are the two of you going?

534
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,860
Welcome to the Rockies, gentlemen.

535
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,860
If you'll follow me to the limo,
I'll take you to Austin Cloquet.

536
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,100
Who the hell are you?

537
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,580
Ortega Peru.
What's it to you?

538
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,780
Mr. Peru never goes anywhere.

539
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,900
That's right.
I never go anywhere.

540
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,380
So when I go somewhere,
everyone thinks I am nowhere...

541
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,220
when I'm really there.

542
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,420
Now, let's put this show on the road.

543
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,500
Uh, sorry.
Mr. Peru, uh, this way.

544
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,380
There are no signs.

545
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,060
So you've been staking out my uncle
all this time.

546
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,700
Is that right?

547
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,060
That's my job.

548
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,820
And the way you say you feel about him,
is, is that part of your job, too?

549
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,820
You all right, boy?

550
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,460
You saw this man?

551
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,300
Yeah. He just went up the mountain.
Said his name was Ortega Peru.

552
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,540
Magoo is Peru?

553
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,340
Magoo, The Piranha.

554
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,420
This is big.

555
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,420
We're gonna need some backup.

556
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,180
Don't you know how to open a door?

557
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,220
Gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

558
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,060
We're especially honored today
to have with us Mr. Ortega Peru.

559
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,740
I was going to kill someone
this morning...

560
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,180
but I did it last night
so that I could be here.

561
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,220
Well, you're too kind.

562
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,620
Well, when you've changed
your clothes, these lovely ladies...

563
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,820
are waiting to serve you
with chilled champagne in the solarium.

564
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,980
Thank you.

565
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,660
Not bad. What do they mean?

566
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,060
Every time I kill a man...

567
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,220
I tattoo his portrait
on my body.

568
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,846
What do you do when you run out of room?
Stop killing people?

569
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,260
Hey, I bet Peru's got
some pretty nice tattoos.

570
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,060
You hombres, uh, go on ahead.

571
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,940
I have got to use
the, uh, powder room.

572
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,220
Come on!

573
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,580
Let's go!

574
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,180
- Champagne?
- Oh, yes.

575
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,940
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

576
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,060
Thank you.

577
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,700
Well, now that we're all here,
may I have your attention, please.

578
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,460
This is where
our little adventure began.

579
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,420
Gentlemen, may I present...

580
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,980
the Star of Kuristan.

581
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,020
The auction will commence
when you write down your opening bids.

582
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,060
Uh, I do not pass my cash...

583
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,980
until I get a close look
at the dingus.

584
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,540
Give it to me in my hand.

585
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,260
Mr. Peru?

586
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,340
Your frog is leaking.

587
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,340
Oh. Well.

588
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,660
Gentlemen.

589
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:02,340
We have an impostor.
Mr. Peru is Mr. Magoo.

590
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,220
Why would Peru disguise himself
as Magoo?

591
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,100
Shut up, you idiot, and get him!

592
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,740
Keep your distance!
This hepcat has a black belt in mayhem.

593
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,780
Hold it!

594
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,140
Give me the Star of Kuristan.

595
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,660
The Star is mine!

596
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,060
Prunella!

597
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,620
The auction is off. Get out.

598
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,540
Come on, go!

599
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,540
My dear! My gum,
you almost had me fooled.

600
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,860
Unc, watch out.
She's got a gun.

601
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,500
Of course she has, Waldo!
She's a federal agent.

602
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,900
She's not what you think!

603
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,660
Now, Waldo, you're talking about
the woman who saved my life.

604
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,620
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

605
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,340
Oh, you can't tell me that yesterday
meant nothing to you.

606
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,060
♪ I am a Viking ♪
♪ A lusty, trusty Viking ♪

607
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,780
Yesterday sucked.

608
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,700
And you kissed a carp.

609
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,260
Prunella.

610
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,460
- Give me the jewel!
- This is all you ever wanted?

611
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,460
You're a true gentleman,
and there aren't many of those left.

612
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,860
Too bad you had to go
and get in my way.

613
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,700
All right, I got the gun now.
Halt or I'll fire!

614
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,500
Don't shoot!
It's me! Waldo!

615
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,180
Great Scott!
Waldo, she's bamboozled me!

616
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,300
She, she, she, she, she's a, a sneak.
Uh, after her!

617
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,460
W-Wait. That'll be easier
with your clothes on.

618
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,020
Oh, yeah, clothes.
Oh, yes, yes, clothes.

619
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,980
This way.

620
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,980
- Police!
- Let's beat it!

621
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,020
Hold it!

622
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,620
Come on, let's go!

623
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,420
Look out! Freeze!

624
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,220
- Hold it!
- Keep your hands up!

625
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,300
- There!
- Come with me.

626
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,100
Get that man!

627
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,575
Hold it!

628
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,540
You'll just have to wait your turn.

629
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,580
- She's over there!
- Where?

630
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,540
There!

631
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,180
- It's too late. It's all over.
- Balderdash, Waldo!

632
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,580
It ain't over
until we've cleared our good name.

633
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,700
Aha-ha! A snowboard.

634
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,540
After her, my boy!

635
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,368
- Wait, Unc, no!
- It's as easy as pie!

636
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:22,339
That's the wrong kind of board!

637
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,860
Hold it!

638
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,180
- Hold on, Angus!
- Stupak, go after them!

639
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,100
<i>The women's boarder cross final
is about to begin.</i>

640
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:51,540
Ready, set, go!

641
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,900
Get back here, you Jezebel!

642
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,340
I'll catch you, Prunella!

643
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,060
<i>And the winner of the women's
boarder cross final is a man!</i>

644
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,980
A man? On an ironing board.

645
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,540
Hey!

646
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,380
- Excuse me.
- Up there.

647
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:02,060
Halt!
Hold it right there!

648
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,700
Ah, a detour.
I'll get you, Prunella!

649
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,540
Freeze!

650
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,940
Watch out!

651
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,700
What?

652
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,940
Unc?

653
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,700
Unc! Unc!

654
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,620
Are you all right?

655
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,700
Don't take that detour, Waldo!

656
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,260
Stay right there.
We'll be right down.

657
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,660
Come on, buddy.

658
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,860
Look! There's
some footprints down there!

659
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,700
They went that way!
Come on!

660
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,820
This is a good idea, Waldo.
You're the real McCoy.

661
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,700
A true Magoo.

662
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,660
I want Magoo.

663
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,580
Who can imagine?
Luanne Le Seur and Mr. Magoo.

664
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,260
Yes, we're talking best-seller.

665
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,140
- I can't believe they did it.
- That's it! That's the title!

666
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,860
Now, we just have to check the airports
and search all the hotels...

667
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,620
and make sure
they don't get away.

668
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,580
Senor Peru.

669
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,620
One moment, my darling.
Yes?

670
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,260
The Star of Kuristan is ready
for delivery. You have 15 million?

671
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,660
Of course. It will make
a fitting gift for my fiancee.

672
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,020
- We are to be married this weekend.
- I'll be there tomorrow.

673
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,540
Good.

674
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,660
The Star of Kuristan.

675
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,780
Uh, excuse me.

676
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,380
Do you have a Luanne Le Seur
registered here?

677
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,260
I'll be with you in a moment.

678
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,380
If you'd just sign here.

679
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:28,500
- Now, who did you want?
- Luanne Le Seur. Is she registered here?

680
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,060
See, we got an airline
late-luggage delivery...

681
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,260
but the party's not staying
at our hotel, so we're checking.

682
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,740
I see.

683
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,620
What hotel are you with?

684
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,300
The St. Paul.

685
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,900
I see.

686
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,460
It says "Fantasy World Costume Rental."

687
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,940
Haven't they let you out
a little before Halloween?

688
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,260
- Madam.
- Oh, thank you, young man.

689
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,100
Have a good afternoon, madam.

690
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,260
Angus. Angus.
Now, stop that.

691
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,220
Unc, let's get out of here.
He's onto us.

692
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,060
- Let go.
- Angus, no!

693
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,860
- He's attacking that old lady!
- Great Scott!

694
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,915
Unhand that woman, Angus.

695
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,260
Let me see.

696
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,980
Wow!

697
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:43,140
Hey, lady,
you forgot your stuff.

698
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,620
What's that?

699
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,340
It's an airline receipt
made out to "Prunella Pagliacci."

700
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,860
Prunella Pagliacci?
That woman is an impostor.

701
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,420
- Unc, that was Luanne Le Seur.
- Well, there, you see?

702
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,260
That's why Angus went after her.

703
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,460
Great Scott!

704
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,700
We had her within our grasp,
and she slipped through our fingers.

705
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,900
Balls of fire!
Oh, good dog, Angus. Good dog.

706
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:11,220
This receipt is for Brazil.
Why would she go to Brazil?

707
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,940
- She's going to Peru.
- She'd go to Brazil to go to Peru?

708
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,300
- Exactly.
- But why?

709
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,340
To get more for the ruby.

710
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,180
- Peru?
- Exactly.

711
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,860
- But then why go to Brazil?
- Peru is in Brazil.

712
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,140
- Peru is in Brazil?
- Ortega Peru is in Brazil.

713
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,180
Ortega Peru! Of course.

714
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,540
And that's why we're going to Brazil.

715
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,260
Come on, Waldo.

716
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,460
Unc, I, I think this is the place.

717
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:13,660
Attaboy, Waldo.
Ease up there, Angus.

718
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,380
I like your badge.

719
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,620
Angus.

720
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,220
I'm going on ahead.
You stay here.

721
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,626
I'm gonna eyeball the situation.

722
01:03:26,651 --> 01:03:29,780
Unc, um, m-maybe I should do
the eyeballing.

723
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,780
Father.

724
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,260
Maybe we should leave out the bit
about "till death do us part."

725
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,460
- She's nervous enough already.
- Jefe.

726
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,740
Luanne Le Seur is here, Jefe.

727
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,860
Javier, after Rosita and I go
to EuroDisney...

728
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,660
have the Le Seur woman killed,
but quietly.

729
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,580
If you disturb my guests,
I will be very disappointed.

730
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,740
Monkey bars. Must be
a children's playground.

731
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:35,140
Oh! Hello, little girl.

732
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,500
Did I interrupt you
in your afternoon nappy?

733
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,700
Now, now, we mustn't let
the grown-ups know that we're here.

734
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,220
Now here's something sweet,
a chocolate.

735
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,260
You go ahead. That's it.

736
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,100
Now, you go on back to sleep.

737
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,420
There you are, honey.

738
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:59,020
You're the ugliest child
I've ever seen.

739
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,220
And needs a change of diaper, too.

740
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,700
Oh, oh, Waldo.
Hold on.

741
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,460
The little angel is trying to sleep.
So, you know...

742
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,820
Well, where did she go?
Kids. Can't sit still for a second.

743
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,260
Ah, well, I think
she's run off there...

744
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,820
where she can have
her chocolate in private.

745
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,580
Now, Waldo, this is the plan.

746
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:26,500
I will gain entry to the house
through a window.

747
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,380
You keep an eye on the lawn party
and spot Luanne Le Seur if you can.

748
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,140
Waldo, you need to take some Tic-Tacs.

749
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,060
- Unc, it's not me.
- Please, please. I, I...

750
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,900
I am talking to someone here, Waldo.
Now, please.

751
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,100
Now, what you have to do is...

752
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,340
Great Scott!

753
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,260
Step on it, Unc!

754
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,420
Stop! Stop! Go back!

755
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,900
Come on, Angus! Come on!

756
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,780
Good boy.

757
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,060
Unc, there's Luanne.

758
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,740
All right.
Now, I'll nab him.

759
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,940
You keep your eye on Le Suer,
but don't forget:

760
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:40,380
She's smart, dangerous, ruthless,
soft, beautiful, a good kisser...

761
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,780
- Unc!
- Huh? Yeah, all right, all right.

762
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,540
Keep your eye open for pitfalls.

763
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,340
How are you?

764
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,900
Senorita Le Seur,
at last we meet.

765
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,540
- You have the Star?
- Do you have the 15 million?

766
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,060
It may take them time to count.

767
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,180
Please stay for the wedding. Afterwards,
I will have Javier take care of you.

768
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,700
Thank you.

769
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,580
Do it quietly
and don't disturb the guests...

770
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,420
or I'll be very disappointed.

771
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,740
Kid, are you lost?

772
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,340
I was looking for the pool.

773
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:16,180
- Wow! Oh, it's beautiful.
- Ooh, pretty, yes?

774
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,940
- I'll go get the bridesmaids.
- Okay.

775
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,700
Hello?

776
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,020
Oh!

777
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,580
Time for a little Red Cross here,
Magoo.

778
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,180
Let me see.

779
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:03,620
Oh, my dear child!

780
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,580
You should have your dentist
file down those teeth.

781
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,100
Rosita? Darling?

782
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,780
Are you with no clothes on?

783
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,220
Is everything all right?

784
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,140
I'm crazy with the love, mi amor.

785
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:29,540
I will see you soon,
my precious flower.

786
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:19,220
Before we take our sacred vows,
precious one, I have a surprise.

787
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:29,660
So do I!
Adios, amor. Nuevo nacho.

788
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,460
It wouldn't last.
I've never loved you.

789
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:41,140
- Get him!
- Out of the way!

790
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,740
Waldo?

791
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,540
Unc, help! Over here!

792
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:50,780
- This is no time for a rope exercise.
- Unc, that thing's down here.

793
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,540
- Good Lord!
- The rope, Unc, get the rope.

794
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,260
- The rope?
- Magoo!

795
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,220
This is the rope
that can save the boy.

796
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,260
All right, let's have at it.

797
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,340
I will exchange the ruby
for the rope.

798
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:12,740
Of course, take it. Take it.
But help me with the boy.

799
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:17,340
You know, I should have you killed,
but I admire a family man.

800
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,820
- You'll be safe in a minute, Waldo.
- Ready?

801
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,580
- Ready.
- Good luck.

802
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,820
Hold on there, Waldo.

803
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,820
Helicopter!
Magoo has brought police!

804
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,100
It's that way!

805
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:51,060
- Attaboy, Angus. Good boy.
- Whoa! Whoa!

806
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:54,740
- Higher! Pull!
- Good, Angus.

807
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,020
Here we are. Police! Don't move
Stay there!

808
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:06,140
Ortega Peru!
He's escaping that way!

809
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:12,140
No one escapes Magoo.

810
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,660
There goes the bride.

811
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,780
Oh, man! You'd think Peru
could've done better than that.

812
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,180
Magoo's dog!
Let's get him!

813
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,020
You weren't leaving without me,
were you?

814
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:57,220
There's the getaway limo.
Hold your horses!

815
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,300
- Unc!
- Arrest him!

816
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,060
Call the chopper!
We have to stop him!

817
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:17,260
Show me the ruby.

818
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,940
Big nasty woman!
Get back!

819
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:36,940
Thank you. Crime never pays, my boy.
Could you pull over?

820
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,500
I'd like to get off.

821
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:17,580
<i>Ortega Peru, you are under arrest!
Land your helicopter now!</i>

822
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,540
<i>Don't panic.
We're dropping down a raft.</i>

823
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:30,100
<i>Swim toward the raft.</i>

824
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,380
<i>Hurry up.
Swim toward the raft.</i>

825
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:38,260
<i>We are dropping you a line.</i>

826
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:41,820
<i>You'll have to hook it up
to the raft.</i>

827
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:45,540
- <i>Then we will pull you to safety.</i>
- Got you now, missy.

828
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,140
<i>Stay calm.</i>

829
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,180
<i>Hook it to the raft.</i>

830
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:56,860
Quincy, please, give me the jewel.
You and me together...

831
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:00,460
Luanne Le Seur, you have
the heart of an artichoke.

832
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:04,740
<i>Stop wasting time!
You're headed for a waterfall.</i>

833
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,220
Great Scott!

834
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,780
We're safe now.

835
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,140
It's hooked to the raft.
Pull us up.

836
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:37,220
Well, look at that rainbow, Magoo.
You just might be a leprechaun.

837
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,180
La Cascada de Muerte,
the Falls of Death...

838
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,660
where many a bride
left stranded at the alter...

839
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,780
has jumped to her final...

840
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:48,940
Oh, my goodness!
Another one! Aye!

841
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,340
- Are you all right, dear?
- W-Well, I'm, I'm all right.

842
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,780
I'm, I'm fine.

843
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:00,260
Oh, that's the spirit, dear.
You'll find someone else.

844
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,500
It's inner beauty that counts.

845
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,340
Words of wisdom, my dear.

846
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,078
Words of wisdom.

847
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:11,340
Magoo, you've done it again.
Have a good day.

848
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,580
Whoa!

849
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,060
Who are you?
What are you doing?

850
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,300
I am Simone Deculaat,
the wedding caterer.

851
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:32,700
Oh, you'll love prison, Simone.
They make great "loaf de meat."

852
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,500
Hey, hey, hey, come here.
Get a picture.

853
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,220
How's my hair look?

854
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,546
- Well done.
- Very nice.

855
01:17:47,595 --> 01:17:48,595
Thank you.

856
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,260
Waldo, thank you.

857
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,860
Oh, you're welcome.

858
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,820
What will you do now?

859
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,780
Well, Uncle Quincy just created
a new position for me in his company.

860
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,180
You're looking at
the head of security.

861
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,660
And now that you have found
your path in life...

862
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,980
I suppose you would not be willing
to return to Kuristan with me.

863
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,500
In a heartbeat.

864
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,260
Well, you don't have to.

865
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,260
I like it here much better.

866
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,940
- Wow!
- Oh, Waldo!

867
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:33,380
Mr. Magoo. Um, sorry we, uh,
put you through all that.

868
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,060
Would you autograph this for us?

869
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,140
By Jove! A-And a very good likeness
of me, too, I must say.

870
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:43,340
You boys certainly move fast.

871
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,300
The TV movie airs Friday.

872
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:48,060
Quite right. Quite right.
Always keep moving.

873
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,580
Come on, Angus.

874
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,820
Have a good day.

875
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:58,100
Well, Angus, it looks like
it's just you and me now.

876
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:00,940
Don't take this wrong, but I feel
that there's someone out there...

877
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,580
the perfect somebody just for me...

878
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,820
and someday Cupid is gonna fire
into the heart of the bull's-eye.

879
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:11,460
And this is one steep staircase.

880
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:15,060
Good exercise
for an old dinosaur like me.

881
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:19,860
Indeed! Oh, by Jupiter!

882
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:24,580
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again!

883
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,100
Oh. Pardon me, madam.

884
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:34,100
Oh, Magoo, you dog!

885
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,500
B-mark.

886
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:01,660
Come on, now. One and two. One and two.

887
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:04,660
Higher! One and two. One and two.

888
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,780
Don't stop until you're ready to drop.

889
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,980
Come on, left leg. Keep going.
One and two. One and two.

890
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,700
Unc.

891
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,220
Yes?

892
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,300
Stick 'em up.

893
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,340
Gimme that!

894
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,180
No. You give it to me.

895
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,300
Cut!

896
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,740
Angus, it's a struggle
against the beast.

897
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,780
- Oh, I really got him. Oh, no.
- Cut!

898
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,700
Remember, I hire people to kill people.

899
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:11,220
- Cut.
- Let me help you.

900
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,020
Get up there, Billy.
Come on, Billy. Come on, boy.

901
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:27,060
Pee. Go ahead, pee.
Come on, pee, boy.

902
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,180
That's it. Pee. Pee.
Good boy! Good boy!

903
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,260
Cut.

904
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,140
Cut.

905
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,260
Quiet. Action!

906
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,340
Damn!
