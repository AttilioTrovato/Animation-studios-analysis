1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,679
The computer
wore tennis shoes

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:17,599
And a twinkle in his eye

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:22,771
Never met a groovier dude,
an electric kind of guy

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,356
A socket shock

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,944
And suddenly socked him
into a real cerebral high

6
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,740
Growing his mind
into the kind

7
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:37,536
That leaves old Einstein
wigging out behind

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,833
The computer
wore tennis shoes

9
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,837
And a smile upon his face

10
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,675
Turnin' on every chick in town
at a cosmothropic pace

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,470
A guy that crazed and amazed
and otherwise dazed

12
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,140
The whole darn human race

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,810
Makin' the news,
payin' his dues

14
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,813
That turned-on, uptight,
flat out-of-sight

15
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,358
Totally together
computer in tennis shoes

16
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,544
A guy that crazed and amazed
and otherwise dazed

17
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,298
The whole darn human race

18
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,010
Makin' the news,
payin' his dues

19
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,846
That turned-on, uptight,
flat out-of-sight

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,850
Totally together
computer in tennis shoes

21
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,602
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

22
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,355
Baa, baa, baa, baa

23
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,689
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

24
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,818
Baa, ba-ba-ba-ba, baa, baa

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,861
Professor Quigley,
I'm sure that

26
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,531
we all appreciate
your interest in progress,

27
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,157
but a computer.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,577
Well, that is a luxury
that we just cannot afford.

29
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,954
Dean Higgins, today,

30
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,164
a computer can hardly
be considered a luxury.

31
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,249
Oh, very well.

32
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,418
Then it is a necessity
that we just cannot afford.

33
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,920
Now, unfortunately,

34
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,548
Medfield has quite
a long list of necessities,

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,716
and a computer
just does not have

36
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,386
a very high priority
on that list.

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,222
Now, it's not
that I'm old-fashioned.

38
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,100
You all know that I have
an open ear for progress,

39
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,477
and we do all that we can.

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,187
Why, when Mrs. Ferguson

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,023
wanted live frogs
for her biology lab,

42
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,776
we went to the expense
of live frogs.

43
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,530
Just last month, we
purchased brand-new Bunsen burners

44
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,240
for our chemistry class.

45
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,034
We're not dragging
our feet, Quigley.

46
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,745
Why, I just put an order
in today

47
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,624
for two garbage disposals
and an electric dishwasher...

48
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,168
- Anything yet, Bradley?
- For our cafeteria.

49
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,878
- Not on us.
- Talk about modernization.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,379
Quig's still fighting
the battle of the computer.

51
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,422
And it's expensive, too.

52
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,590
How's he doing?

53
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,175
Yeah, that figures.

54
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,135
Aw, Higgins is
weaseling out again.

55
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,511
What's he pulling
this time?

56
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,013
- Ah, he's got a new one.
- Hi, Dex.

57
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,556
He says he's spending
too much money

58
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,767
for frogs and Bunsen burners
and garbage disposals.

59
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,269
Thanks.

60
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,271
Quigley, you talk
about $10,000

61
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,064
as though it were 10 cents.

62
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,108
You just don't understand
the problem.

63
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,651
Do you know what the
telephone bill alone

64
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,903
is here every month?

65
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,112
Take State.

66
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,656
I don't want to hear
about State.

67
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,116
Yeah, but do you realize

68
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,367
that they give
an entire course in

69
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,702
computer technology?

70
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,121
Now, I don't like to draw
comparisons, gentlemen,

71
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,290
but if we want to keep
abreast of the times

72
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,875
and raise
our academic average...

73
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,003
We have got to modernize.

74
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,177
Modernization isn't everything.

75
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,014
Yes, uh, Regent Dietes.
Thank you very much.

76
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,807
That's, that's well-put.

77
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,268
Gentlemen, I, uh,
I wouldn't like this

78
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,811
to get any further
than this room,

79
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,146
but frankly,

80
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,024
we are down to the nitty-gritty
on our budget.

81
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,236
The building program
is bogged down.

82
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,279
The bankers in this town
won't even answer

83
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,656
my phone calls.

84
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,825
Why, we raffled off
everything on the campus

85
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,993
but the women's gym.

86
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,663
I tell you, gentlemen,

87
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,332
it is tough to be the dean
of a college today.

88
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,251
It's tough, tough, tough.

89
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,003
Unrest.

90
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,589
Everywhere you look, unrest.

91
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,926
Now, I wonder
who's behind that.

92
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,596
Hmm.

93
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,725
Oh, uh, that part
about the unrest,

94
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,686
that's, uh, that's off
the record, Mrs. Winifrid.

95
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,855
So, Quigley, I'm sorry,

96
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,358
but I'm certain that you
understand our problem.

97
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,986
That's it.
They killed him.

98
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,946
Now, for the next item
on the agenda...

99
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,864
- Us?
- Deadwood.

100
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,074
Us.

101
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,200
Well-put, Dean.

102
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,452
An apt title for
the ne'er-do-wells

103
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,996
who ought to be expunged
from this...

104
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,247
Leonard...

105
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,541
The not-so-gifted students'
needs are just as great

106
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,001
as those
of the gifted ones.

107
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,171
Quigley, this is a competitive
educational institution.

108
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,132
All right, gentlemen,
all right.

109
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,051
Now, um, Quigley, we do have
certain ne'er-do-wells

110
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,177
that must be seen to.

111
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,595
Therefore, I'm suggesting

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,098
that the following students
be placed on probation...

113
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,933
Probation
is no substitute

114
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,936
for catching the interest
of the student,

115
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,855
for firing
his imagination.

116
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,481
- Yeah.
- Come on, Quig.

117
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,649
Thataboy.

118
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,817
Timothy Balsen,

119
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,070
John Colligan, Roger Demney,

120
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,280
Henry Fathington,

121
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,157
Myles Harris,

122
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,950
Adam Jervins,

123
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,745
Keith Richards,
Dexter Reilly...

124
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,246
Ugh! They got me!

125
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,290
Dexter, it's not funny.

126
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,583
Robert Ross,

127
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,792
Sliver Roth.

128
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,419
Sliver?

129
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,381
A man with a name like that
has no business in a college.

130
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,717
Arnold Sandy,
Stanley Tyler...

131
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,677
He missed me.
He went through all the S's.

132
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,220
- Hey, that's right.
- Nice going.

133
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,764
What about Schuyler?

134
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,223
Hmm?

135
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,100
Oh, yes, of course.
Richard Schuyler.

136
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,935
Put him on there.
Richard Schuyler.

137
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,313
Thanks a lot.

138
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,439
He's sick.

139
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,983
No, it's just plain hate.
That man's all hate.

140
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,653
You know, Quig really cares,
but the guy can't even reason with him.

141
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,988
Well, how can you
reason with a guy

142
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,615
who lives in the Dark Ages?

143
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,410
Hey, wouldn't it be terrific
if we swing it for old Quig?

144
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,870
Well, swing what?

145
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,122
- The computer.
- Hey, yeah.

146
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,458
It'd drive Higgins
right over the edge.

147
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,460
You guys
must be dreaming.

148
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,004
The guy who's selling it
wants 10 grand.

149
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,381
Who is that, Bradley?

150
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,049
AJ Arno.

151
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,052
That big shot, uh, who runs the AJ Arno
Investment Company, huh?

152
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,970
Well, he's not such a big shot.

153
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,597
I mean, I think
if we went down there

154
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,681
and talked to him,

155
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,809
we could get him to
donate it to the college.

156
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,769
Aw, man, listen, I'll lay
you any kind of bet

157
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,771
we couldn't even get
in there to see AJ Arno.

158
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,981
Well, I don't know about that.
I used to work for him.

159
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,900
Dexter, you just cleaned up at night.

160
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,735
Arno wouldn't even remember you.

161
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,987
What do you mean
he wouldn't remember me?

162
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,781
Well, I always used to bump into him

163
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,366
in the elevator and halls and stuff.

164
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,952
And he always said hello, kind of.

165
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,121
You know, that's not too bad an idea.

166
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,705
You know, big firms,

167
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,666
they're always donating
things to universities.

168
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,001
No. No trouble at all, Wexler.

169
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,962
I'm glad you boys dropped by.

170
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,505
Now, don't get me wrong.

171
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,007
I, uh, I'd love to donate
the computer to Medfield.

172
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,342
I mean, I love that school.

173
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,095
I love the football team,
the track team, the golf team.

174
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,472
It's a wonderful place, but, uh,

175
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,642
well, uh, I already give them
$20,000 a year.

176
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,270
Gee, Mr. Arno, we didn't realize

177
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,063
that you'd already donated.

178
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,023
Well, believe me, if I didn't
give them all that money,

179
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,359
I'd be glad to donate the computer.

180
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,111
But honestly, uh,

181
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,156
nobody could expect me
to do both, now, could they?

182
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,032
No.

183
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,702
Wait a minute.

184
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,329
Maybe I can work something out.

185
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,748
Look, just give me a little time, huh?

186
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,916
Sure.

187
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,293
You know, I like you kids.

188
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,962
I like your spunk.
I like your get-up-and-go.

189
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,715
I like the idea of a student
delegation coming to see me.

190
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,592
Makes me feel good, up here.

191
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,302
- Bye.
- Thanks.

192
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,554
Goodbye. Goodbye, boys.
Good to see you.

193
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,222
Thanks a lot for giving us
your time, Mr. Arno.

194
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,766
Well, AJ Arno never forgets
an old employee.

195
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,102
You just come back
any time, Lester.

196
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,729
Um, it's, it's Dexter.

197
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,398
Ah, yes, Dexter.

198
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,091
O'Brien.

199
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,765
Ready with yesterday's stuff?

200
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,807
Yeah, just about, sir.

201
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,185
- Well, run it.
- All right.

202
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,284
Hey, they did pretty good
with the horses.

203
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,787
750 isn't bad.

204
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,460
That crap table figure okay?

205
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,171
525. That's real good
for The Palace.

206
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,757
Looks like a real good day
for Applejack.

207
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,717
Yeah, real good.

208
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,762
Incidentally, don't send
that 20 grand to Medfield.

209
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,889
Don't? But you made that pledge.

210
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,474
Don't you think...

211
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,476
Don't worry about it.
It's all taken care of.

212
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,605
Now, 102 goes right over there.

213
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,985
And, uh, 149 also over there.

214
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,946
146, right.

215
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,449
Okay. Right this way now, Baxter.

216
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,743
Easy through the door, you guys. Easy.

217
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,328
That's it. Right in there.

218
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,207
Now, what do we have here?
Number 125.

219
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,500
Okay, boys, right over there.

220
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,085
- Right.
- Let's go.

221
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,878
Easy now. Take it easy.

222
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,088
What a slave driver.

223
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,507
Yeah, if he'd been in charge
of that Russian five year plan,

224
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,925
they'd have made it.

225
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,010
You know, it's a great idea doing

226
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,219
something for the school,

227
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,013
but next time
let's do something easy,

228
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,472
like hijacking a Cuban airliner.

229
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,724
Yeah.

230
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,851
Okay, boys,
now we need number 126.

231
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,312
Professor, can we just
take a few seconds off?

232
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,563
My back's killing me.

233
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,024
Oh, sure.
Take as much time as you want.

234
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,693
Uh, Dexter, there's a box of
tools in the back of my car.

235
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,194
Would you get that for me, please?

236
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,696
Sure. Right away, Professor.

237
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,448
Good.

238
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,074
- Dean Higgins.
- Good morning, Dean.

239
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,659
Hi, Deano.

240
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,329
Oh, hello, there, Dean Higgins.

241
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,705
Nice of you to visit us.

242
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,290
Of course, we're not
really set up here yet,

243
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,000
but very soon.

244
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,960
"Dear Dean Higgins, first of all,

245
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,420
"I would like
to congratulate you

246
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,880
"on your splendid
student delegation."

247
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,340
Well, that's wonderful.

248
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,300
I see.

249
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,426
Uh...

250
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,762
"And you will understand

251
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,972
"that since we have made
such a valuable donation,

252
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,725
"we must withhold our yearly
cash contribution.

253
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,894
"Yours in the interest
of higher education,

254
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,103
"AJ Arno."

255
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,397
Well, this, this is
a dreadful mistake, sir.

256
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,899
You can say that again.

257
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,817
And I'm gonna tell you
this much, Quigley,

258
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,903
in the future, I'm gonna be
watching them.

259
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,364
But you can't blame the boys, sir.

260
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,783
Why, it's Mr. Arno
who's acted in bad faith.

261
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,077
Oh, good faith, bad faith, who cares?

262
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,704
They've cost this school $20,000.

263
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,331
Well, not altogether, Dean.

264
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,624
We still have the computer.

265
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,835
Oh, shut up! Higher education.

266
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,462
Hey, pretty great
about the computer, huh?

267
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,172
You know, I don't like to brag,

268
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,925
but if it hadn't been for the fact that I
used to work there...

269
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,261
Him I'm gonna watch most of all.

270
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,849
Well, what's he gonna be
watching me for?

271
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,689
The elements of a computer
are input, memory, control,

272
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,941
arithmetic and logic, and output.

273
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,402
And I think we can see,
demonstrated from these charts,

274
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,445
that man has done
a rather admirable job

275
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,905
of imitating the human brain.

276
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,950
And, uh, even though
it's an imitation,

277
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,785
in many ways,
the machine we've developed

278
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,788
can operate more efficiently
than we can ourselves.

279
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,998
Now, in the past couple of weeks,

280
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,584
I've been, uh, working
on a small experiment,

281
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,628
uh, which is intended to show

282
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,797
how we can be replaced by a computer.

283
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,634
Hey, this may be a way
of getting rid of Dean Higgins.

284
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,138
We live in hope, Dexter.

285
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,766
Now, let's suppose

286
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,935
that your parents are going away
for the weekend,

287
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,604
and they leave you
the following instructions,

288
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,566
"If it's raining tomorrow
morning when you wake up,

289
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,317
"you are to close the windows,

290
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,194
"open the door
and let the cat in,

291
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,320
"phone the grocer

292
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,282
"and have him send
over the following list."

293
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,658
All right?

294
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,660
Well, you wake up in the
morning, and it is raining.

295
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,954
And being the conscientious
and reliable young people

296
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,832
I know you to be,
you promptly forget to do it.

297
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,711
Now, well, actually,
I'm sure you would do it,

298
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,964
but let's see if a computer
could also do it.

299
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,177
Now, this is a rain gauge,

300
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,180
and it's, uh, sitting on a roof
of a building.

301
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,016
Now, when the water falls
into this gauge,

302
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,894
it sends a signal to the logic
unit of the computer,

303
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,355
which immediately notifies
the memory bank of the computer

304
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,107
to seek out its instructions
for a rainy day.

305
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,109
The memory bank, in turn,

306
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,153
activates the electronic circuits,

307
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,156
the window closes, the door opens,

308
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,992
hopefully the cat comes in,

309
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,829
and the automatic telephone
goes into action, right?

310
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,873
Well, let's see.

311
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,506
The rain falls.

312
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,227
This is a recording.

313
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,231
Please deliver the following groceries
to 445 Annex Street.

314
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,983
One pound of bacon,
two dozen eggs,

315
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,360
four quarts of milk.

316
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,404
Hmm. Well, I, that's enough of that.

317
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,327
Uh, thank you. Thank you.

318
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,955
Well, so much for the speed
of the computer.

319
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,915
Now, another very important feature

320
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,334
is its infallible memory.

321
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,295
Before this computer was owned
by the AJ Arno Company,

322
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,090
it used to be employed
by the Space Research Center

323
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,551
at the Pacific Institute of Technology.

324
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,095
And they were kind enough
to send us this magnetic tape,

325
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,681
which will call forth from the computer

326
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,809
solutions to a series
of problems that would occur

327
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,687
on a simulated flight
to the planet Saturn.

328
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,231
Now, mind you, it was 20 years ago

329
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,567
that this program was operational.

330
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,985
Twenty years.

331
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,571
Well,

332
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,574
if you'll watch
the center panel, please.

333
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,296
Hey, Quig.

334
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,006
Hey.

335
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,803
Well, it seems like
our flight to Saturn

336
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,305
will be a little delayed.

337
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,973
Your attention, please.

338
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,391
This is Dean Higgins.

339
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:57,437
Now, the State General
Collegiate Classification tests

340
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,814
will be held tomorrow at 11:00.

341
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:05,278
Now, as many of you know,
we came in 36th last year.

342
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,405
And, now, I think
we could get out there

343
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,073
and improve upon that position.

344
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,658
Thank you.

345
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,913
Thirty-sixth?

346
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,456
Gee.

347
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,625
You know, Dexter,

348
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,420
there are only 37 colleges
in the state.

349
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,130
Gee, I wonder who we beat.

350
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,298
I don't know.

351
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,008
What happened, Professor?

352
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,469
Oh, it's a part in the logic
activator unit.

353
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,970
It, uh, should be replaced,

354
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,514
but I can't get over to
Capital Electronics today.

355
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,350
Well, listen, I'll get it for you.

356
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,435
Oh, I wouldn't expect you to go all the
way over there, Dexter.

357
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,519
That's 70 miles away.

358
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,188
Oh, that's okay.
I've got nothing to do.

359
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,023
You have nothing to do?

360
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,191
Didn't you just hear?

361
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,193
That classification test
is coming up tomorrow.

362
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,153
Oh, yeah, but I know all that stuff.

363
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,364
Cars and buses going
from place to place.

364
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,075
Car "A" goes 70 miles an hour.
Car "B" goes 60.

365
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,493
One guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes.

366
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,619
And who gets to Chicago first?

367
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,870
I got it all, prof.

368
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,997
Yes, I'm sure you do have it all, Dexter,

369
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,749
but if I were you,
I would look it over again

370
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,125
this afternoon.

371
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,419
Aw, honest, Professor.
It wouldn't do any good.

372
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm up to here with it.
Let me go to Marshfield.

373
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,174
Believe me, the drive
and fresh air will do me good.

374
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,550
It'll give my brain
a chance to ventilate.

375
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,386
It couldn't be "A."

376
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,221
The answer to the last
two questions was "A."

377
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,515
Would never have three A's in a row.

378
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,557
It's gotta be "B" or "C."

379
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,310
I haven't seen a "C" for a long time.

380
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,020
It's gotta be "C" then.

381
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,023
Got to be "C."

382
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:30,071
"A?" That's three As in a row.
That's impossible.

383
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,033
How do they ever expect anybody
to figure this out?

384
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:18,513
Three at 8-02-30.

385
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,352
Applejack Rainbow Lodge 4378,

386
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,856
animals 750, tables 480,

387
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,526
amusements 624.

388
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,738
Applejack Pompey Palace...

389
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,658
- Dexter? Dexter!
- 4379...

390
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,119
- Huh?
- Dexter, are you okay?

391
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,411
Yeah.

392
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,373
Did you wake me up
to ask me if I was okay?

393
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,208
Nah, you were beeping.

394
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,377
- Burping?
- No, beeping.

395
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,045
Oh, that's good.

396
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,096
- Hey, Dexter...
- Uh...

397
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,140
What'd you do
to the computer anyway?

398
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,517
Nothing. I just tried
to put in that part,

399
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,894
and I got this terrific shock.

400
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,729
Well, there must be
a short in it somewhere.

401
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,856
Yeah, there sure is.

402
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,399
I had to call in these computer people.

403
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,942
They can't get a spark out of it.

404
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,237
Well, I'm sorry, professor.

405
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,697
Well...

406
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,240
Sorry I'm late, Prof.

407
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,951
Yeah. Well, move along,
boys. Move along.

408
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,583
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a speed test.

409
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,626
And that means if you have
trouble with any question,

410
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,628
skip it and move on to the next one

411
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,547
because you'll be graded
on the total number of questions

412
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,798
you answer correctly.

413
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,425
Is that clear?

414
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,718
All right.

415
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,428
You may begin.

416
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,946
Dexter, come on. Start the test.

417
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,835
Shh.

418
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,077
Shh.

419
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,041
Funny guy.

420
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,226
Shh.

421
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,415
Dexter, cut it out.

422
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,615
Shh!

423
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,313
I tell you, Quigley, he cheated.

424
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,148
It's just as simple as that.

425
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,276
Spending $20 for a doctor.
That's ridiculous.

426
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,195
He didn't cheat, Dean Higgins.

427
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,947
Something has happened to Dexter.

428
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,950
Now, we usually allow an hour
and a half for that test.

429
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,326
And since I've been at this school,

430
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,828
nobody's ever finished it.

431
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,414
Dexter finished it in
four and a half minutes,

432
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,624
and he didn't make a mistake.

433
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,792
Professor Quigley?

434
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,127
Yes.

435
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,763
I can't go on TV!
I don't even want to go on TV!

436
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,264
Listen, at this rate, you're gonna faint

437
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,474
in front of all those people.

438
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,685
Dexter, it isn't that easy.
Things aren't the same.

439
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,646
You have a responsibility now.

440
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,481
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

441
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,274
Listen, Dexter, it's almost
like playing a game.

442
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,901
Now, I know the first few
minutes are gonna be tough.

443
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,736
But, listen, after you
answer a few questions,

444
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,738
you're gonna get your confidence.
Don't worry about it, man.

445
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,282
And the thing to remember is that you're
smarter than all those people.

446
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,408
- That's right.
- That's right.

447
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,535
I am?

448
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,122
That doesn't make any sense.

449
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,626
There are going to be
37 million viewers, Quigley.

450
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,127
I tell you, he'd better come through.

451
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,254
No question.

452
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,214
Oh, Mayor Collins.
Nice to see you, Mayor.

453
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,632
Take a seat right down front, Mayor.

454
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,300
Ha! It's the mayor.

455
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,094
I tell you, Quigley,

456
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,264
Medfield has really brought out
the fat cats tonight. Ha!

457
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,392
Mayor Collins and there's
Councilman Cooper over there

458
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,686
and Supervisor Straight and there's, uh,

459
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,104
oh, he's not anything.

460
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,439
Oh, there's Dean Collingsgood
in the booth.

461
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,024
Hello, Dean! Ha, ha!

462
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,318
Dean Coll... What's he doing here?

463
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,488
Well, it's perfectly natural for the dean of
the state university to be here.

464
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,656
Well, I don't like it.

465
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,825
Every time I see him, I have to hear
about his building program.

466
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,285
Building, building, building.

467
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,245
It's enough to make you sick.

468
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,538
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

469
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,790
- Hello, Eugene. Hello.
- Nice of you to come.

470
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,792
Say, what about that
boy wonder of yours?

471
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,335
I've been hearing great things.

472
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,379
Well, you know, at Medfield,
the scholastic...

473
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,547
Nice to see you.

474
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,881
I would have gotten over here sooner,

475
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,384
but I've been tied up planning
our new science building.

476
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,344
Building, building, build...

477
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,014
You know, Quigley, sometimes I think I
should have taken up contracting

478
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,682
instead of education.

479
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,185
Say, Eugene, I was talking
to some of our faculty today,

480
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,479
and we thought it might be a good idea

481
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,774
if we had a sort of a
Dexter Reilly rally at State.

482
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,818
So many of our teachers
want to meet him...

483
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,737
No. I... I mean, he's all booked up.

484
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,656
Uh-huh. Well,
we can work something out.

485
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,450
Thirty seconds,
ladies and gentlemen.

486
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,118
Oh, I'd better take my seat.

487
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,537
I've been invited to sit in
the control room.

488
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,289
In the control room.

489
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,750
I tell you, he's trying to steal
that boy away from us.

490
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,836
Oh, you're exaggerating a little,
Dean Higgins, I'm sure of it.

491
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,880
You don't understand him, Quigley.
The man is greedy.

492
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,299
He's up to his throat in state money
and still he's greedy.

493
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,231
On behalf of the major networks,

494
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,526
I would like to extend thanks
to our learned panel

495
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,820
who has come here tonight
from all parts of our land

496
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,073
in the interests of science
and education.

497
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,911
And, of course, special thanks

498
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,914
to the one who is the reason
we are gathered here,

499
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,583
the wizard of Medfield College,
Dexter Reilly.

500
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,085
- Yay!
- Yay!

501
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,924
Each of our learned guests
will be allowed three questions.

502
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,094
Our first questions will be
from Dr. Rufus Schmidt,

503
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,472
head of the Department of Higher
Mathematics at Purdue University.

504
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,598
Dr. Schmidt.

505
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,433
Thank you.

506
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,979
Mr. Reilly, you're acquainted with the
mathematic subject of calculus?

507
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,940
Well, I...

508
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,446
I, uh, I guess I am.

509
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,949
I kind of looked at the text this morning.

510
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,617
I see.

511
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:28,414
Mr. Reilly, using the fundamental
theorem of advanced calculus,

512
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,623
and applying the formula

513
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,583
that the square of a distance
from the origin to "P"

514
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,753
is equal to "X" squared plus "Y" squared
plus "Z" squared.

515
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,631
Now, could you tell us the
point of the plane

516
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,135
where X+4, Y-1,

517
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,721
Z=26?

518
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,848
Point is where "X" is equal to 3,

519
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,391
"Y" is equal to 4,

520
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,393
and "Z" is equal to -1.

521
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,603
The answer's quite right.

522
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,857
You see?
He's getting his confidence.

523
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,358
I told you.

524
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,949
Your next question, Dr. Schmidt.

525
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,368
Mr. Reilly, my next question

526
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,328
is an exercise in mental gymnastics.

527
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,039
Could you please tell us

528
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,959
what 13 to the ninth power would be

529
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,128
and then give us the square root
of that product?

530
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,881
Thirteen to the ninth power would be

531
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,760
10,604,499,373.

532
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,679
The square root of that
product would be...

533
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,474
102,978 decimal point

534
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,226
14997852.

535
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,395
I'm afraid that's quite correct.

536
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,147
Hey.

537
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,530
Congratulations, Mr. Reilly.

538
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,532
I must say, that was really something.

539
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,700
Yes, I suppose it was,

540
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,869
but wouldn't it speed things up a bit

541
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,871
if we could save the applause
till the end?

542
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,706
We've wasted 38 seconds on it already.

543
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,711
Yes, uh, I'm sure the audience
would be glad to comply.

544
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,129
Good.

545
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,715
Your third question, Dr. Schmidt.

546
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,051
Mr. Reilly,

547
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,678
assuming that the population
of the United States

548
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,388
increases on a geometric progression...

549
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,681
Gentlemen, please.

550
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,850
This is our third question
in mathematics.

551
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,393
I hope you're aware

552
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,562
that I'm perfectly equipped
to go into other fields.

553
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,232
Of course.

554
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,902
Uh, perhaps now we could hear
from, uh, Dr. Seigel,

555
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,238
professor of foreign languages
at Lansing University.

556
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,199
Getting his confidence is one thing,

557
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,034
but this is ridiculous.

558
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,036
I liked him better the way he was.

559
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,420
We're awaiting the arrival
of the phenomenal Dexter Reilly.

560
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,589
It promises to be exciting,
so stay with us

561
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,301
as our cameras follow Dexter Reilly
on his journey through Gotham.

562
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,553
There's been a buzz of excitement

563
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,763
around the big city this past
week, ladies and gentlemen.

564
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,765
Everywhere you go, you hear
the same question,

565
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,517
is Dexter Reilly for real?

566
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,353
Now the landing platform is
in position, the door is open.

567
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,063
Should be any second now.

568
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,482
And there he is!

569
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,735
- Wow.
- Whoo-hoo.

570
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,612
- He's out of sight.
- He sure is.

571
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,116
Well...

572
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,701
Now, uh...

573
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,161
Uh, Mr. Reilly's being
greeted by two young ladies

574
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,455
who came all the way from
Yonkers just to greet him.

575
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,624
This is Priscilla Cummings...

576
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,835
Queen of the
Yonkers Botanical Society,

577
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,337
- and her lady-in-waiting...
- That dirty rat!

578
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,257
I always knew if he had any
brains, he'd be dangerous.

579
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,385
Hey, Annie, wait a second.
Just a second.

580
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,512
Look, I know Dexter's
acting kind of weird,

581
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,139
but it's kind of understandable.

582
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,307
I mean, all of a sudden, like,

583
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,641
he's the smartest guy in the whole world,

584
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,476
and everybody's catering to him.

585
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,478
Well, you're telling me.

586
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,586
Look at that crowd, Quigley.

587
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,338
What a boon for the college.

588
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,382
But, you know, we weren't thinking,
Quigley.

589
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,719
Why couldn't the boy
have been carrying a Medfield pennant?

590
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,681
Don't you think that would have
been pushing it a little, sir?

591
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,101
Yes?

592
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,353
Mr. Clodshoe is here.

593
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,314
- Clodshoe?
- From Universal Encyclopedia.

594
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,192
Oh, tell him we already have a set.

595
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,611
Salesmen. That's all we need.

596
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,446
We can't pay for what we have now.

597
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,074
He's no salesman, sir.

598
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,534
He's the president
of Universal Encyclopedia.

599
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,161
I don't... The president?

600
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,246
Sure. You know, they're
the people who sponsor

601
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,123
the "College Knowledge" program.

602
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,919
The quiz program where they ask the
questions from the encyclopedia,

603
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,963
and they give away $100,000?

604
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,006
What have I done, Quigley?

605
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,052
Oh.

606
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,012
Mr. Clodshoe,
it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

607
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,097
It's a real pleasure.

608
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,723
Thank you. Who are you?

609
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,850
Who am... Ha, ha, ha! That's good.

610
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,560
I like that. Who am I?

611
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,521
And I like that set of
encyclopedias of yours.

612
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,731
I like it, remarkable set. Remarkable.

613
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,859
Displaying again his
remarkable intellectual prowess,

614
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,779
Dexter Reilly was able to
converse with each delegate

615
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,447
to the U.N. in his own tongue.

616
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,159
Speaking in French,
the official language of the U.N.,

617
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,996
Dexter Reilly has informed
the international group

618
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,539
that he must now go inside.

619
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,791
They're waiting for him
in the Security Council.

620
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,294
Earlier today, Dr. Suzuki of the
International School of Languages

621
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,756
stated that with a computer type brain,
such as Dexter Reilly has,

622
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,300
he'll soon be able to master
every language

623
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,094
the world has ever known.

624
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,264
I think he's given a good
indication of that today.

625
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,766
Professor Mertins, we need that boy.

626
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,853
He can wrap up that
"College Knowledge" program for us.

627
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,440
Should be a simple matter to get him
transferred to State.

628
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,191
We have so much more to offer.

629
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,361
Of course, but we can't
take any chances.

630
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,363
See if you can get Coach Parsons
in here.

631
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,992
Then we'll send off a wire to
Dexter Reilly.

632
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,369
Parsons? The football coach?

633
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,747
This is a problem of recruitment.

634
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,125
I need the best advice I can get.

635
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,587
Ladies and gentlemen,

636
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,590
Dexter Reilly is now at the
Long Street Jewelry Salon,

637
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,716
where he's been invited

638
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,968
to observe the cutting
of the Calcutta Blue.

639
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,721
I, uh, I hate to disturb you, sir.

640
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,348
Uh, just a minute, Quigley.
This is exciting.

641
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,101
And I wish that announcer
would raise his voice.

642
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,312
You'd think Arnold Palmer was putting.

643
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,982
Now, Sigmund Van Dyke, the world's
foremost diamond cutter,

644
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,776
is in charge of the operation.

645
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,652
Tremendous.

646
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,988
Well, this is rather important, sir.

647
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,074
It's about the
"College Knowledge" program.

648
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,241
That's no problem.

649
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,202
Dexter will chew up
those encyclopedias.

650
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,120
We'll beat every team in the state.

651
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,206
It seems that Mr. Van Dyke

652
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,875
is explaining the operation
to the boy wonder.

653
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,879
Only maybe we don't have Dexter.

654
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,963
What?

655
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,175
He hasn't registered
for the spring semester.

656
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,136
We've gotta do something!
We need that boy!

657
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,764
Winifred, get out Dexter's itinerary!

658
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,307
Find out when his plane arrives!

659
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,184
Quigley, how could you let this happen?

660
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,187
The first operation

661
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,231
of cutting the diamond
in two exact halves

662
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,108
is the most important.

663
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,695
I think Mr. Van Dyke
has now made a decision.

664
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,988
Wait a minute!

665
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,242
I beg you... I beg your pardon.

666
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,494
It seems there's an area
of disagreement

667
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,871
as to where the diamond should be cut.

668
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,084
Keep that kid away from me.

669
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,739
Yeah, Mr. Arno, but I'm kind
of busy right now.

670
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,117
Well, I hate to interrupt you
but I've got some good news.

671
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,326
Oh?

672
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,037
I think I've found a spot
for you in my organization.

673
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,914
- 13... 12...
- Gee, I haven't given much thought

674
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,166
to what I'm going to do...

675
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,709
- 11... 10...
- I'll tell you what.

676
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,086
- 9... 8...
- I'll pick you up at the airport.

677
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,714
We'll have a nice, relaxing afternoon.

678
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,923
- 4... 3...
- Then maybe talk a little business.

679
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,049
How's that? Hmm?

680
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,593
- 2... 1...
- That sounds fine, just a minute.

681
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,596
Zero.

682
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,543
Pardon us, boys. Pardon us.

683
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,463
- What's happening, please?
- Come on, you guys.

684
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,472
Hello, professor, how are you?

685
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,849
- Welcome home, boy.
- Dean Higgins. How are you?

686
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,975
Let me get this.

687
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,436
I know you've been very busy, son,
and it's probably just an oversight,

688
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,772
but you haven't registered
for the second quarter.

689
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,983
Now, if you can stop by the school
I'm sure we could take care of that.

690
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,318
Well, you see, Dean, there is a problem.

691
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,986
- A problem?
- Yes, I don't know whether

692
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,113
I want to enroll at Medfield
for the second quarter.

693
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,449
Well, where else would you possibly go?

694
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,369
Well, don't get me wrong.
It's not that I don't like Medfield.

695
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,288
I like it. I like the guys and the teachers
and I even like you.

696
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,457
There's Mr. Arno. Excuse me.

697
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,877
He likes me. Isn't that wonderful?

698
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,837
Dexter! Hi!

699
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,715
What's happening? What's happening?

700
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Whoo!

701
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,510
Dexter?

702
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,429
- Where are you going in such a hurry?
- Yeah.

703
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,014
Mr. Arno wants to see me this afternoon.

704
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,892
- Well, so do we.
- Yeah, man.

705
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,560
Everybody's been waiting
for you to come home.

706
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,104
We're going to the lake this afternoon.

707
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,188
Annie, are you kidding?

708
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,148
Mr. Arno's a very important
man in this town.

709
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,693
I just can't turn my back on him.

710
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,945
Well, Dexter, he'll understand.

711
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,154
Yeah, come on, Dex.

712
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,865
And look, I'd like you to come, too.

713
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,325
I'm sorry, Annie.

714
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,328
Mr. Arno arranged for this
meeting yesterday.

715
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,206
I'll see you later, guys. I gotta go.

716
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,304
What's with him?

717
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,431
I don't know, Pete.

718
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,058
But I think if we're going to have
anything to do with Dexter anymore,

719
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,393
we'll have to make an appointment.

720
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,519
Yeah.

721
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,490
Little champagne, Dexter?

722
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,367
Best there is. $34 a bottle.

723
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,161
No, thanks. Uh, not right now.

724
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,998
Ah, healthy. Ha, ha, ha! I like that.

725
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,625
Well, who do you like
in the first race, kid?

726
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,085
Well, according to all the information,

727
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,212
it should be the number eight horse,
Market Doodle.

728
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,424
Market Doodle? Ha!
Boss, that horse is a pig.

729
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,967
It ain't got a chance in this race.

730
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,470
Well, it's just a matter of analyzing
all the information,

731
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,597
the weight, distance, past performance.

732
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,475
And Market Doodle does figure
out to be the best horse.

733
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,352
Bet $200 on Market Doodle.

734
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,729
Boss, how can you listen to this kid?

735
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,938
He don't know nothin' about horses.

736
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,523
I have been listening to you for years.

737
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,275
Do as I tell you.

738
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,194
Okay. Sweetheart...

739
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,905
I don't know. I think you're flipping.

740
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,368
$200, Market Doodle,
the number eight horse.

741
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,415
Flag is up.

742
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,711
And there they go.
Market Doodle comes slowly.

743
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,297
French Suzie is going
to beat First Orbit,

744
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,548
second, Cottontop,

745
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,634
third on the outside, Maladjusted,

746
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,470
fourth, Nobody's Baby,
Clean Clem, Rare Addition,

747
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,223
then Snoopy's Pal and Market Doodle.

748
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,101
Down the backstretch, it's First Orbit

749
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,936
in front, between horses, by a head.

750
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,771
Cottontop is second on the rail,
by a neck,

751
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,439
French Suzie, third, by a length,

752
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,984
Nobody's Baby is fourth,
and Market Doodle is far back.

753
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,820
Around the far turn,

754
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,614
it's Maladjusted in front
on the inside by a head.

755
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,324
French Suzie is second by a neck.

756
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,785
First Orbit, third. Cottontop is fourth.

757
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,871
Nobody's Baby and Clean Clem
turning for home.

758
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,374
It's First Orbit in front
on the inside by a head.

759
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,126
Cottontop is second by two lengths.

760
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,503
French Suzie, third,
Maladjusted, fourth,

761
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,256
and Market Doodle is closing
much ground on the outside.

762
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,590
Come on, boy!

763
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,009
It's French Suzie in front
on the outside by a head.

764
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,178
First Orbit is second by a half-length.

765
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,973
Cottontop, third by a length.
Maladjusted is fourth.

766
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,475
And here comes Market Doodle
in the middle of the track.

767
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,686
- French Suzie in front.
- Come on! Come on!

768
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,396
First Orbit is second, Cottontop, third.

769
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,690
And Market Doodle flying
on the outside.

770
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,233
- French Suzie...
- Come! Come on!

771
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,568
Market Doodle moving up
on the outside.

772
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,694
Here comes Market Doodle.

773
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,736
Come on, boy! Come on!

774
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,113
French Suzie and Market Doodle...

775
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,239
And Market Doodle
is the winner by a nose.

776
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,824
Hey! Ha, ha, ha!

777
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,124
Hey, honey, cash 'em in. Cash 'em in.

778
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,375
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

779
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,377
Uh, you bum.

780
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,382
16... 18... 20...

781
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,177
22... 24... 26...

782
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,721
$28,000.

783
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,891
I never seen anyone win that much
money all at once, straight.

784
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,726
Yeah, not a bad afternoon.

785
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,478
Well, I gotta split.

786
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,229
I got a chamber meeting tonight.

787
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,564
Chillie will take you to dinner.

788
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,773
Take him down to Garibaldis.

789
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,900
They got good pizza there.

790
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,030
- Hi, there.
- Hey, Tom.

791
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,073
Here, you drive, kid. I'm right over here.

792
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,116
Hey, thanks.

793
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,086
Oh, Dexter, can I have a word with you?

794
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,380
Uh, we are in a hurry, Dean.

795
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,007
It's very important.
It's about your enrollment.

796
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,761
I brought the short form. I think this
will be an ideal time to discuss it.

797
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,012
I'm sorry, Dean, but I'm afraid

798
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,472
we'll have to talk about it
some other time, okay?

799
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,432
Well, I really think
we should talk about it tonight.

800
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,558
Sorry.

801
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,268
Is that all right with you?

802
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,728
Impossible.

803
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,772
You haven't been talking
to Dean Collingsgood, have you?

804
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,440
- Not yet.
- Wh...

805
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,486
Not yet?

806
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,018
What are you doing here?

807
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,854
Well, uh, I, I'm absolutely f... I'm fl...

808
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,480
Isn't this Professor Stanley's house?

809
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,357
There was supposed to be
a dinner party in my honor

810
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,442
at Professor Stanley's.

811
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,985
You're not fooling me, Collingsgood.

812
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,528
I know what you're doing here.

813
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,075
It's a raid!

814
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,202
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're police officers.

815
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,579
All the exits are guarded.

816
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,748
We urge everybody to remain calm.

817
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,543
It is my duty to inform you
of your Constitutional rights.

818
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,963
You have the right to remain silent.

819
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,840
You have the right to have an attorney

820
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,301
present before and during
all questioning.

821
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,762
If you wish an attorney and
cannot afford one,

822
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,097
the state will refer an attorney.

823
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,516
For those of you...

824
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,893
Where do you think
you're going, buster?

825
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,770
Buster? My name is not Buster.

826
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,063
This is just what I thought it was.

827
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,981
- This is a case of mistaken identity.
- Ha!

828
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:17,278
How I ever let you lead me
into such a mess!

829
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,822
Lead you?

830
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,532
You're the one that tried to steal the boy.

831
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,701
You ought to be in jail, not me.

832
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,995
Collingsgood, you're acting like this

833
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,373
is the first time a thing like this
has ever happened.

834
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,041
- Hey, you okay, kid?
- I can remember the time

835
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,043
you stole "Breakaway" Jones from me.

836
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,420
Hey, come on.
Don't be depressed, will you?

837
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,255
Spending the night in jail ain't so bad.

838
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,424
Look at me.
I've been in and out 100 times.

839
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,968
It's not that.

840
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,971
It's not the alumni
that's trying to steal Dexter.

841
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,098
It's you.

842
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,224
You know, I don't understand you.

843
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,351
You should be the happiest
guy in the world.

844
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,811
I've been going to the track all my life.

845
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,937
I never once met a guy

846
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,690
who could pick eight races
in a row, never.

847
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,235
Dexter, you and me could have
the world at our feet here.

848
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,781
I'm just trying
to be fair to the boy.

849
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,491
I mean, with his capabilities,

850
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:07,412
why should he stay at
an academic fleabag like Medfield?

851
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,081
Well, it was that academic fleabag

852
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,959
that taught Dexter Reilly
everything he knows.

853
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,628
You just want him for that
"College Knowledge" program,

854
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,130
and you know it.

855
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:23,344
You know,
everyone's just out for himself.

856
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,055
It was like that everywhere I went.

857
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,349
Everyone's just out for himself.

858
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,687
Oh, you mean those guys?

859
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:33,771
Don't let them bother you, man.

860
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,022
You stick with me.

861
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,652
Who are you thinking of, Mr. Walski?

862
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,072
Oh, come on, will you, kid?

863
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,242
You're supposed to be smart,
some sort of genius.

864
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,662
Don't you think everybody
thinks about themself?

865
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,164
Huh?

866
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,169
Okay, kid, you've been bailed out.

867
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,922
There, you see I told you
Mr. Arno would come through.

868
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,424
- Just the boy.
- Huh?

869
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,054
Oh, uh, Dexter, tell the boss, uh,
not to forget I'm in here, huh?

870
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,517
Uh, Dexter...

871
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,856
Uh, Dexter, do you suppose
that you could, uh...

872
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,984
Dean Higgins,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

873
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,989
92... 93... 94... 95... 96...

874
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,367
Will you all shut up for just one minute?

875
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,747
92... 93... 94... 95...

876
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,832
Quiet!

877
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,211
96... $97.50.

878
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,546
Well, the bail for Dexter Reilly's $100.

879
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,716
You've only got $97.50 here.
You owe $2.50 more.

880
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,719
Wait a minute.

881
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,846
Wait a minute!

882
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,140
Now, if you'll all promise
to get out of here,

883
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,184
I'll pay the $2.50 myself.

884
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:01,150
Dean Higgins, I'll come by tomorrow
and fill out that application.

885
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,985
Oh, that'll be wonderful.

886
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,241
Hey!

887
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,327
What's happening?

888
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,537
The jailbird.

889
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,705
Thanks for bailing me out, guys.

890
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,915
- Sure, man.
- Yeah, sure.

891
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,292
A lot of things have been
happening to me lately.

892
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,797
Yeah, I...

893
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,799
I guess I've been acting kind of weird.

894
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,469
But I guess the worst thing I did

895
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,971
was to forget who my friends really were.

896
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,139
- Aw, come on.
- What are friends for?

897
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,642
I'd just like to say that I'm sorry.

898
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,227
- Come on.
- What are friends for, man?

899
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,770
Come on, man.

900
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,777
Annie...

901
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,114
Annie, I, uh...

902
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,240
What?

903
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,118
Heck, I don't know what I was doing.

904
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,788
That's okay. Come on, let's go.

905
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,827
That's fantastic.

906
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,831
You did the S's in
eight minutes and 18 seconds.

907
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,334
That beat the R's
by nine-and-a-half seconds.

908
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,210
And there were 1,200 pages in the S's

909
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,378
and only 1,000 in the R's.

910
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,088
I picked up 22.68%.

911
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,176
I'll get it.

912
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,847
Oh, hi, Professor Quigley.

913
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,182
Hello, Bradley.
Is Dexter here?

914
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,350
Yeah, he's just boning up

915
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,393
- for the "College Knowledge" program.
- Time. Mark.

916
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,814
Page four, paragraph 16,
line 398, word 4,001.

917
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,066
Hi, Professor.

918
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,152
Hello, Dexter. Boys.

919
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,695
Well, I'm, I'm sorry.

920
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,905
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.

921
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,657
Oh, don't worry.
Heck, these are a cinch.

922
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,117
Ah, you can't believe this guy.

923
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,703
Yes. Yes. I know. Hmm.

924
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,373
Well, it's just, uh, a little thing, Dexter.

925
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,250
It, uh, seems that we need,
uh, three more members

926
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,377
for the panel.

927
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,753
I see.

928
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:29,215
And, uh, Dean Higgins sent
over a list of suggestions.

929
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,134
Oh.  For you.

930
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,722
These guys are smart, all right.

931
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,142
Well, you know me, Quigley,
I'm not a proud man.

932
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,645
If, uh, Dexter doesn't
like my suggestions,

933
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,271
then he can have anybody he wants.

934
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,356
Good.

935
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,482
Who does he want?

936
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,567
Schuyler, Henry and Myles.

937
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,944
Hmm. Schuyler, Henry and Myles.

938
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,446
That seems like a perfectly logical s...

939
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,117
Schuyler, Henry, and Myles? Oh, no.

940
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,577
Eh, well, they're very
good friends of his, sir.

941
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,121
Well, I don't care.

942
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,247
And I'm afraid

943
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,749
that if we tried to force
anyone else on him,

944
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:04,875
he might...

945
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,669
He might. You're right. He might.

946
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,753
He would, too.

947
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,797
I mean, we want to keep that boy happy.

948
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,885
But Schuyler, Henry, and Myles.

949
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,847
Well, I'm not sure about
the answer to the third part.

950
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,099
But the answer to part one
is "The Battle of Thermopylae,"

951
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,144
and the answer to part two
is "The Naval Battle of Salamis."

952
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,272
Well, Lockhurst has answered two parts
out of three correctly.

953
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,982
And that's good for 20 points.

954
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,150
Now we have a question

955
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,445
concerning Greek art directed
to our Medfield panel.

956
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,071
For 10 points each,

957
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,781
please name the three greatest sculptors

958
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,700
of the Golden Age of Greece.

959
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,080
- Okay, Schuyler, you answer this one.
- What?

960
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,957
It doesn't look good
if I answer all the questions.

961
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Now, there were three sculptors.

962
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,543
Phidias, who did a statue of Athena,

963
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,253
and Praxiteles, who specialized
in human figures,

964
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,422
then there was Myron, who sculpted
the figure of a discus-thrower,

965
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,215
kind of like the best thing he ever done.
Okay. You got it?

966
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,300
Got what?

967
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,843
Gentlemen, you have 20 seconds.

968
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,470
Well, tell him.

969
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,931
I think I misunderstood the question, sir.

970
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,475
You tell him, Henry.

971
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,977
Who's that guy, Merlin?

972
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,395
Not Merlin, Myron.

973
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,814
Is he the guy who threw the shot put?

974
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,024
It wasn't a shot put. It was a discus.

975
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,859
And he didn't throw it.
He was a sculptor.

976
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,694
Gentlemen, your time is almost up.

977
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,322
I think I misunderstood the answer, sir.

978
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,782
You did?

979
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,912
That's the last time I'll do that.

980
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,628
We have time for one more question

981
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,671
directed to our Medfield panel.

982
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,426
Gentlemen, these are the works
of the famous Marcel Duchamp

983
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,679
as found in the collection of
the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

984
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,640
Thank you, Miss Ackerman.

985
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,309
For 10 points each, please identify.

986
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,354
Number one is called
Portrait of Chess Players.

987
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,688
It was painted in 1911.

988
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,357
Number two is called The Bride,

989
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,942
and it was painted in 1912.

990
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,486
And number three is called

991
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,072
A Nude Descending a Staircase.

992
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,157
It was also painted in 1912.

993
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,575
That's right on the button.

994
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,203
Very good.
That answer is absolutely correct.

995
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,833
Next week, Medfield will meet
Franklin in the semifinals.

996
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,419
So until then, good night to you
from Universal Encyclopedia,

997
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,046
your passport to knowledge.

998
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,761
You guys were great. We're gonna win.

999
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,555
Thanks. Hey.

1000
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,646
A Nude Descending a Staircase.

1001
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,858
- Boy, that'd never make Playboy.
- Ha.

1002
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,777
Oh, Dean Collingsgood, nice to see you.

1003
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,320
You're scouting, I imagine.

1004
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,405
Can hardly blame you.

1005
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,074
It should be Medfield
and State in the finals.

1006
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,618
Oh, what an exciting match that'll be.

1007
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,620
And I would like to say
right at the beginning,

1008
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,455
I hope that the better team may win.

1009
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,000
- Withdraw him, Eugene.
- I beg your pardon.

1010
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,586
If you had an ounce of integrity,
you'd withdraw him.

1011
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,338
- Withdraw whom?
- That boy. It's unfair.

1012
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,673
He's an intellectual freak!

1013
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,758
Now, Dean Collingsgood,
control yourself.

1014
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,927
I know how you feel,
but you can't win them all.

1015
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,680
Unfortunately, this year,
Medfield has the horses.

1016
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,433
Hmm. Are those the horses?

1017
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,893
Well, actually, Collingsgood,

1018
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,103
they're just, uh, part of the team.

1019
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,695
For 10 points each, could you give us

1020
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,656
the highest and lowest points
in South America?

1021
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,535
The highest point is Mount Aconcagua,
which is 22,934 feet.

1022
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,037
The lowest point is Salinas Grandes,

1023
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,164
which is 131 feet below sea level.

1024
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,665
Both locations are in Argentina.

1025
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,626
That is absolutely correct.

1026
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,127
20 points for Medfield.

1027
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,131
How do you like that?

1028
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,133
I could have had that kid
in my organization.

1029
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,552
Hey, I didn't try to get him
arrested, you know.

1030
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,180
He won't even answer
the phone when I call.

1031
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,140
But, boss, how did I know
there was gonna be a raid?

1032
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,684
- I mean, I didn't think that...
- Will you shut up? I want to hear this.

1033
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,895
However, we have time
for one more question,

1034
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,730
and I will direct it to our Medfield panel.

1035
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,983
The Department of Agriculture
stated last year

1036
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,151
the people of the United States

1037
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,654
consume more apples
than any other country.

1038
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,989
Some of that consumption
was in the liquid form.

1039
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,950
Can you give the phrase in slang

1040
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:11,038
for the central unfrozen portion
in a container of frozen cider?

1041
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,164
Applejack.

1042
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,333
- That's absolutely right.
- Applejack.

1043
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,878
Applejack, Chissum City Social Club

1044
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,839
137, Feb. 29,

1045
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,342
animals 740, tables 600...

1046
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,011
Hey, boss, I had nothin' to do with this,
I swear. Nothin'.

1047
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,473
Applejack, Pompey Palace,

1048
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,268
138, Feb. 29.

1049
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,228
Animals 740.

1050
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,440
Applejack, Charlie Place.

1051
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,235
Are you all right, Mr. Reilly?

1052
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,655
Yeah, sure.

1053
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,532
What was I talking about?

1054
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,119
Mr. Arno, if you could please
relax for just a little...

1055
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,705
All right. Out, out. Just get out of here.

1056
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,916
But what do
I do with this?

1057
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,877
Chissum City Social Club.

1058
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,170
Hello. This is Applejack.

1059
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,213
Oh, yes, sir.

1060
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,715
Shut down right now.

1061
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,550
Everybody and everything out of there.

1062
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,385
I don't want a trace of that operation left.

1063
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,554
Shut down? Why? What's the matter?
Somethin' wrong?

1064
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,056
Just do as you're told. I'll keep in touch.

1065
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,224
Whatever you say.

1066
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,435
Boys, out!

1067
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,151
We gotta put that kid on ice.

1068
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,697
Look, we need time to figure this out.

1069
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,202
Hello? Long distance?

1070
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:36,415
I want the Pompey Palace
on Franklin Road in Charlottesville.

1071
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,875
Yeah.

1072
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,543
You know, if that kid
hadn't been stopped,

1073
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,463
he'd have mentioned every joint
I own in this state.

1074
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,756
Pick him up.

1075
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,174
Take him out to the Hancock place.

1076
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,258
Right.

1077
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,509
What?

1078
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,262
No, I don't know the area code.

1079
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,937
Hello, Dexter.

1080
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,107
What are you doing here?

1081
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,944
Well, Mr. Arno figured you might be
overworking yourself.

1082
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,238
He thought you could use
a little vacation in the country.

1083
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,698
Go ahead. Start the car.

1084
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,783
You know, fresh air and stuff.

1085
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,951
Look, Mr. Arno's not my boss,

1086
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,495
and I don't need any vacation.

1087
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,164
Dexter, start the car.

1088
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,675
Well, drive.

1089
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,806
I just don't know what could
have happened, Lieutenant.

1090
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,809
He was supposed to be at my house
about 8:30 last night,

1091
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,143
and he never showed up.

1092
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,978
And nobody's seen him since.

1093
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,230
Well, we've checked all over.

1094
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,857
He hasn't been in an accident
nor has he been arrested.

1095
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,401
Lieutenant, I wonder

1096
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,444
if he could have had
an attack of amnesia.

1097
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,071
With that peculiar brain of his,

1098
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,281
he might just have wandered
off somewhere.

1099
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,825
Could be miles away by now.

1100
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,201
Mmm-hmm. I've alerted the state patrol

1101
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,494
to be on the lookout for his car.

1102
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,121
And if they don't
pick him up pretty soon,

1103
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,206
then I'm afraid we'll have
to suspect foul play.

1104
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,958
Hmm. Foul play, huh?

1105
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,168
Well, that's it! He's been kidnapped.

1106
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,129
Collingsgood has kidnapped him.

1107
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,171
Collingsgood?

1108
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,173
You don't mean Dean Collingsgood
over at State?

1109
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,466
Well, yes, of course.

1110
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,009
Oh, don't you see it, Quigley?

1111
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,178
I mean, if Dexter isn't back tomorrow

1112
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,847
for that "College Knowledge" program,

1113
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,641
then Springfield State will
get the $100,000 grant.

1114
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,560
We don't stand a chance without him.

1115
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,936
- Uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Hmm?

1116
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,397
The dean of a college, a kidnapper?

1117
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,691
Well, you don't know him.
You don't know him at all.

1118
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,775
The man is ruthless.

1119
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,070
He gets all that taxpayers'
money and still he's ruthless.

1120
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,198
Yeah. Uh-huh.
I see.

1121
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,993
Well, we'll, uh, we'll check it out.

1122
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,786
I guess that'll be all for now.

1123
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,455
If any of you hear anything,

1124
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,707
uh, be sure to let me know.

1125
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,125
Thank you.

1126
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:51,425
Pete... I just don't think

1127
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,887
Dexter would go wandering off
without telling anyone.

1128
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,140
I don't think the lieutenant does either.

1129
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,558
Let's stop by my place for a second.

1130
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,768
I just thought of something.

1131
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,689
Applejack, Chissum City Social Club

1132
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,150
137, Feb. 29.

1133
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,737
Animals 740, tables 600,

1134
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,906
amusements 500.

1135
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,745
Applejack, Pompey Palace 138,
Feb. 29.

1136
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,080
Animals 740.

1137
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,000
Applejack, Charlie...

1138
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:31,465
Gee, all those places
and always "Applejack."

1139
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,758
That's weird.

1140
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,510
When I played the tapes to Dexter,

1141
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,636
he didn't remember.

1142
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,429
He didn't have the foggiest
idea what they were.

1143
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,432
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

1144
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,017
Nah, they got to.

1145
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,269
Look, he was on TV for 15 weeks,

1146
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,771
and nothing happens to him.

1147
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,774
Then all of a sudden,
he mentions "Applejack," and wham!

1148
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,275
Just like that, he's missing.

1149
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,777
Pete, I just don't get it.

1150
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,986
What?

1151
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,448
Look, Dexter glances through
an encyclopedia,

1152
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,034
he remembers every single word.

1153
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,703
He browses through a book
on an oriental language,

1154
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,288
and then speaks it fluently,

1155
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,748
remembering every accent.

1156
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,500
He remembers everything

1157
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,545
he's ever seen, touched, heard, or read

1158
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,255
in his whole life.

1159
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,091
How come he doesn't remember this?

1160
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,926
Pete, it doesn't make sense.

1161
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,638
Unless, unless he'd never read it

1162
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,431
or seen it or heard it before.

1163
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,308
It was in the computer.

1164
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,810
Of course.

1165
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,770
When he got that big, giant shock,

1166
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,523
he was not only able to remember
and think like a computer,

1167
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,402
but all the information that was
in the computer was zapped into him,

1168
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,820
and he didn't even know it.

1169
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,364
And now he blurts it all over the TV.

1170
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,075
That's why
he's missing.

1171
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,162
A.J., Applejack. AJ Arno.

1172
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,247
A code name...

1173
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,541
- Applejack.
- For something,

1174
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,668
something he doesn't want
anybody to know about.

1175
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,003
Hi.

1176
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,589
Tables, animals, amusements.

1177
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,132
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1178
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,843
Pete, nobody would believe
this but you and me.

1179
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,011
Hi.

1180
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,346
I don't care who believes it,
just as long as we find Dexter.

1181
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,390
Hey, Schuyler, will you
do a favor for me?

1182
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,516
Sure.

1183
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,351
All right. Take these tapes
down to the police station.

1184
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,936
Tell them if they look up these places,

1185
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,938
they're gonna find out
what Applejack is up to.

1186
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,399
Applejack is Arno,
and he's probably a crook.

1187
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,109
And the reason why we know
Applejack is Arno

1188
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,695
is 'cause it came from the
computer into Dexter's head.

1189
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,530
And that's why Dexter
doesn't remember it.

1190
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,906
Come on.

1191
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:27,789
138, Feb. 29, animals 740.

1192
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,877
Applejack, Charlie Place...

1193
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,880
That's why Pete remembered
that Applejack was Arno.

1194
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,006
Arno?

1195
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,133
Yeah, because it was the only
thing he couldn't remember.

1196
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,093
Pete couldn't remember?

1197
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,470
No, no, no. Dexter.

1198
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,055
And that's how he remembered.

1199
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,306
Because he couldn't?

1200
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,308
Exactly.

1201
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,643
Yeah.

1202
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,020
Well, uh, thank you, Mr. Schuyler.

1203
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,396
Sure.

1204
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,319
Oh. Incidentally,
if I go out of town or anything,

1205
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,904
I'll be sure to notify you.

1206
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,989
Meantime, I'll be on
the "College Knowledge" program

1207
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,616
if either of you want me.

1208
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,580
Tell me straight, Lieutenant.

1209
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,582
Ever seen anything like that before?

1210
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,751
Never.

1211
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,420
Let's hit this tape. I want to hear it again.

1212
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,289
What do we do now, Pete?

1213
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,958
Well, if there's any
dirty work to be done,

1214
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,418
Arno wouldn't be involved.

1215
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,961
Come on. Let's follow his stooge.

1216
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,171
I hope you're right.

1217
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,931
Licorice Skull.

1218
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:34,142
$50 on Licorice Skull in the fifth.

1219
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,191
And John Aloicious in the sixth, $50.

1220
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,030
Miss Press. Yeah, that's right.

1221
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,491
Miss Press in the seventh, $50.

1222
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:57,415
In the eighth, Forever Anger. $50.

1223
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,750
Yeah, that's it. Thanks.

1224
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,253
Angie, uh, a word, if you please.

1225
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,172
Sure. Get your mind
on Sataquoi Downs.

1226
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:09,427
Hey, how'd you ever get the kid
to pick the horses?

1227
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,512
It's easy.

1228
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,264
If he don't pick the winners,
he don't eat.

1229
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,141
Hey, hey. That's good thinking.
Good thinking.

1230
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,810
But it don't make no difference.

1231
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,311
I just got the word... We get rid of him.

1232
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,771
Oh, gee.

1233
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:22,148
I was just gettin' a good streak goin'.

1234
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:26,903
The boss says he cannot live,
not with that memory of his.

1235
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,447
Yeah. Well, I figured it'd come to that.

1236
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,782
That's too bad,

1237
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,285
but we gotta figure out now
how to get rid of the body

1238
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,453
so nobody but nobody finds it.

1239
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,496
That's understandable.

1240
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,665
Hey, how 'bout Navajo Lake?

1241
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,292
It's about 240 feet deep in the center.

1242
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,835
We weight the kid down, throw him in.

1243
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,879
He goes down and down and down.

1244
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,463
Nobody'd ever find him.

1245
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,173
Nothin' the matter with that.

1246
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,258
I like it.

1247
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,552
Maybe we could get some fishing
in afterwards, huh?

1248
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,970
The season don't open
for a couple weeks yet.

1249
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,638
Well, gamble. We'll take a chance.

1250
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,473
Well, whatever.

1251
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,808
Good. Then it's all settled.

1252
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,810
First thing in the morning,
kid takes a dip in the lake, huh?

1253
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,187
Beautiful. But let me get
a couple more winners.

1254
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,065
Yeah, sure, calling the police
would be the easy way.

1255
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,150
What about Dexter?

1256
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,068
He ends up in jail with the rest of 'em.

1257
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,404
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get Dexter out of the house

1258
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,156
without the help of the police?

1259
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,492
We gotta realize that
this could be dangerous.

1260
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,412
Okay. So it's dangerous.
We owe it to Dexter.

1261
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,664
And what's a couple of bullets
in the old gut anyway?

1262
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:20,790
Yeah.

1263
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:21,833
You aren't going.

1264
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,543
You guys and Schuyler
gotta stick around here

1265
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,086
for the "College Knowledge"
program tomorrow.

1266
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,755
Us?

1267
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:27,881
Without Dexter?

1268
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:31,092
Oh. I've rather have
a couple of bullets in the old gut.

1269
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,886
Listen, what if we get hung up

1270
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,512
and we don't get back in time?

1271
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,348
You guys gotta represent the school.

1272
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,516
What's your idea, Pete?

1273
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,270
Okay. We gotta have the run of the place

1274
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,521
without anybody catching on.

1275
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,079
Somebody's coming!

1276
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,506
Hey, where's the paint
for the trim?

1277
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,218
Chillie, there's a whole bunch
of painters outside.

1278
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,260
- Painters?
- Yeah.

1279
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,179
Get him upstairs.
Come on, come on.

1280
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,931
- Upstairs, kid.
- I hate painters.

1281
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,476
See? They're swarmin' all over.

1282
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,727
Good morning.

1283
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,521
What are you people doing
out here, what is this?

1284
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:27,732
- We're painting the house.
- I can see that! What am I, blind? Why?

1285
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,484
Well, this is the Hancock house,
isn't it?

1286
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,736
- 22 Forest View Road?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

1287
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,905
Boy, you had me worried
there for a second.

1288
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,408
Terrible thing if we were
painting the wrong house.

1289
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,701
What is this?

1290
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,161
That's an order.
No, it's all correct.

1291
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,621
An order to paint the house.

1292
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,248
- An order, huh?
- Yeah.

1293
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,917
Well, look, look, why don't you people
come back tomorrow, huh?

1294
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,836
We can't do that.
We gotta do it today.

1295
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,295
Man,
it says so right here.

1296
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,297
Give me this!
Angie, nobody moves here, nobody.

1297
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,424
Whatever.

1298
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,758
Just hold up the work here!

1299
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,927
Hold it, kid!
Hold, hold it!

1300
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,970
One second.

1301
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,898
Good morning.
Medfield Paint Company.

1302
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,942
We cover the county.

1303
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,445
Oh, they got there. Fine. Fine.

1304
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,572
You mean they really
are painters?

1305
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:17,407
They look like a bunch
of punks to me.

1306
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,451
Well, sir, they're part
of our youth program.

1307
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,703
Don't worry, you'll find
they do excellent work.

1308
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,460
I guess it's okay.
They check out.

1309
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,634
This could be murder!

1310
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,969
Not if we don't panic.

1311
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,971
Just keep on painting
the house

1312
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,347
like we know
what we're doing,

1313
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:44,309
and keep your eyes on those
windows and be ready, okay?

1314
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,192
You have any luck up there?

1315
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,651
Nothing yet.

1316
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,488
That's where I thought
they'd be keeping him.

1317
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,782
Yeah, well, some of
the shades are drawn.

1318
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,701
He could be in one of those
rooms without us knowing it.

1319
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,120
Yeah. We'll watch real close.

1320
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,163
Hey! Look out!

1321
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,795
Beautiful.

1322
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,463
Really beautiful.

1323
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:17,425
Oh, come on, you guys!
Be careful, will ya?

1324
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,469
You know, we've been here
almost an hour

1325
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,221
and nobody's
seen anything of him.

1326
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,972
Do you think he's up there, Pete?

1327
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,599
Yeah, he's in there. I'll guarantee it.

1328
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,017
He's in there somewhere, man.

1329
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,770
Just keep your eyes peeled, okay?

1330
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,526
The big guy's gone through
a couple times,

1331
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,486
but so far, no Dexter.

1332
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,948
Bradley!

1333
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,284
Bradley, what...

1334
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,163
Oh, Bradley!

1335
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,667
You mean I was supposed to paint the
house orange and the trim green?

1336
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,086
That's exactly what I mean
to tell you, Bradley!

1337
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,297
Gosh, Pete, I don't know how I could
make a mistake like that.

1338
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,882
Pete!

1339
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,761
Pete, those guys!
I just heard them talking,

1340
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,222
and they're going to do
something to Dexter, I know it!

1341
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,765
All right. What'd they say, Annie?

1342
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,268
Well, they said to get him
ready, and the longer they wait,

1343
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,228
the more chance they have
of getting caught.

1344
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,398
And then a couple of them went upstairs.

1345
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,316
Okay. We gotta make our move.

1346
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,943
Come on, let's go.

1347
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,863
I don't understand
why you don't understand.

1348
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,489
The police understood perfectly.

1349
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,658
Ohh. Oh, Quigley,
thank heavens you're here.

1350
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,702
- Did you find Dexter?
- No luck. I'm sorry.

1351
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:28,496
What, do you realize we might
be stuck with these things?

1352
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,249
Oh, now, really, Dean, we don't like this
any more than you do.

1353
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,876
Oh, shut up. I'm talking to him.

1354
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,336
Don't we at least have
an alternate for Dexter?

1355
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:38,047
Well, yes.
We, uh, we have Peter Oatzel.

1356
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,425
Oh, thank heavens.
At least he's intelligent.

1357
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,760
Only, uh, he's not there, either.

1358
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:43,928
Where is he? Where?

1359
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,972
Well, uh, as near as I can find out,

1360
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:48,016
he's off painting a house somewhere.

1361
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,226
- Painting a house?
- Good morning, Eugene.

1362
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,644
I see we're all here early.

1363
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,230
Well, it's the early bird
that catches the worm.

1364
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,274
Don't you worm me, you worm!

1365
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,525
Eugene.

1366
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,110
Now, what have you done with that boy?

1367
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,445
You've done something with him!

1368
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,779
I'm gonna see you in jail for this!

1369
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,531
Dean Higgins, perhaps we'd
better go sit down.

1370
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,866
I don't want to sit down.

1371
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,577
Eugene, you mustn't get yourself
so excited.

1372
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,996
After all, you have your health
to think about.

1373
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,540
So you don't win the contest.

1374
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,959
It's only money.

1375
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,469
A car!

1376
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:43,655
Oh, hi, boss.

1377
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:45,240
What's with all those kids out there?

1378
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,991
- Oh, you mean the painters?
- Painters?

1379
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,035
This place looks like
a Halloween joke!

1380
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:51,162
Oh, no. I called their shop, boss.

1381
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,998
They're painters.
I tell ya, they're okay.

1382
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,959
They'd better be.

1383
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,794
They are. You'll see. I checked.

1384
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,633
Sherwood Forest.
Robin Hood speaking.

1385
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,679
This 247-8824?

1386
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,223
Congratulations. You win the prize.

1387
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,141
How would you like
your sheep dog wrapped?

1388
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,275
So, they're okay?

1389
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,943
You checked 'em out, did ya?

1390
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,611
They're not painters, you numskull!

1391
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,405
They're a bunch
of his school buddies!

1392
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,408
- School buddies! I knew it all the time!
- Yeah, I'll bet!

1393
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,160
How are you gonna get him
outta here?

1394
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,787
Oh, boss, I am way ahead
of you on that.

1395
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,914
The boys are upstairs getting
him ready right now.

1396
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,041
Oh, you pea brain.

1397
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:38,918
Did you find him?

1398
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,378
No. Didn't you guys?

1399
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,671
- No.
- No.

1400
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,548
I looked everywhere, even in the closets.

1401
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,216
Arno's guys, what are they doing?

1402
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,135
Well, they're back there packing a trunk.

1403
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,387
They must be getting ready
to leave or something.

1404
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,055
I mean, they, they wouldn't leave

1405
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,766
without taking Dexter
along with them.

1406
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,061
What kind of a trunk was it, Bradley?

1407
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,731
Um, about that long,
and about that high.

1408
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,482
You know, a regular trunk.

1409
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,900
It was Dexter.

1410
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,736
They're packing Dexter!

1411
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,115
- Man, this kid's heavy!
- They're comin'!

1412
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,869
Take it easy goin' around the corner.

1413
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,083
How come I always get
the heavy end?

1414
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,585
Quit complainin', will ya?

1415
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,463
Oh!

1416
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:26,924
Ugh!

1417
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,101
Here, here, here!

1418
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,144
Well, break it down!

1419
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:39,228
Yeah, yeah.

1420
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,612
The door!

1421
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,119
- Hey!
- Ohh!

1422
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:57,914
Grab it! Grab it!

1423
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,761
Dexter? Dexter!

1424
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,643
Come on! Let's get outta here!

1425
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,412
Whoa!

1426
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,663
Ahhh!

1427
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,039
Ohhh!

1428
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:55,012
Aw, you're probably outta gas, you idiot!

1429
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,143
What's goin' on here?

1430
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,561
They put paint in everything.

1431
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:02,895
Well, what do we do now?

1432
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,356
- The kid's car!
- Well, come on! Let's go!

1433
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,905
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1434
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,625
This is the only truck I've ever been in
that didn't have any tools in it.

1435
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,377
Dexter, are you all right?

1436
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,504
Hey, it's hot! Get me outta here!

1437
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,381
He, he needs ventilation!

1438
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,930
Dexter's car! I forgot all about it!

1439
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,098
Give it all you got!

1440
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,267
I can't! I've got it floored now!

1441
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,395
What are we going to do?

1442
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:45,563
Hey, what's going on?

1443
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,772
Hey, get me outta here!

1444
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,734
Come on, help me with this paint.

1445
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,322
Not them!

1446
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,907
Their tires.

1447
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,074
Get closer.

1448
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:13,382
Whoo-hoo! Ha ha!

1449
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,766
Oh, no! Here he comes again, Pete!

1450
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,687
- What are we going to do?
- Let's get the other one! The other one!

1451
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,277
Look out! They're gonna dump
some more paint!

1452
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,362
No problem.

1453
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,367
Aaaahh!

1454
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,747
Get me in, you dummies!

1455
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,168
Get me in!

1456
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:50,419
Fall!

1457
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,507
What are you tryin' to do, kill me?

1458
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,392
Now what, Pete?

1459
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:06,227
Start dumping everything.

1460
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,436
Throw everything!

1461
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,000
Duck!

1462
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,479
Whoo-hoo!

1463
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:59,113
Aw, you blithering idiot!

1464
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,075
Aw, shut up!

1465
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,290
We will now direct our
fourth historical question

1466
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:11,125
to Medfield College.

1467
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,960
The word "paleolithic"
is used to describe

1468
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,213
a stage of human culture lasting
probably over a million years

1469
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,050
and ending about 8,000 B.C.

1470
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:22,053
Now, for 10 points each, describe and
date the following cultures.

1471
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,265
The mesolithic culture, the neolithic
culture, and the chalcolithic culture.

1472
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,976
Do you know what he's talking about?

1473
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,062
No. Do you know what he's
talking about?

1474
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,104
Unh-unh.

1475
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,357
Gentlemen, you have about
15 seconds.

1476
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,109
He could give me 15 months.

1477
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,737
Medfield, your time is about up.
I will need an answer.

1478
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:41,906
We pass on that one, your honor.

1479
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:45,493
"Your honor?"

1480
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,413
We have the reports about
that stuff on the tape.

1481
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,581
Yeah?

1482
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,791
That kid really had something.

1483
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,834
Riverdale and Scottsfield
card room,

1484
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,879
and Emmitt Junction, a horse
parlor behind a barbershop.

1485
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,591
And the guy in Emmitt Junction
mentioned a Mr. AJ Arno.

1486
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,759
Well.

1487
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,387
That's the end of an era.

1488
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:05,429
Mm-hmm.

1489
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,972
Let's pick him up.

1490
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:18,609
Bradley, go tell Dean Higgins
we've got Dexter here.

1491
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:19,652
Right!

1492
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,949
Dexter, are you all right?

1493
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,450
Oh, I don't know.

1494
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,660
What's the matter?

1495
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,495
It's my head.
There's this ringing in my head.

1496
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:32,081
Come on, let's get him outta this box.
Maybe he'll feel better.

1497
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,419
Now, take it easy with him!

1498
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,796
Hey, Dexter,
straighten out your legs.

1499
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:39,839
I can't!

1500
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,757
And they were bringing him
down the hall,

1501
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,050
and then we fought with them,

1502
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,177
and we took him in the room
and put him on the windowsill.

1503
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,555
- Put who on the windowsill?
- I think it's "whom," sir.

1504
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,306
Oh, is it? I don't care about that!

1505
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:50,474
What about, go on with the story!

1506
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,644
And then the trunk fell out
of a second-story window.

1507
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,812
On top of him?

1508
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:55,980
No, he was in it.

1509
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:57,982
- Hi, Dean Higgins.
- Hi, Dean.

1510
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,109
What happened to him?

1511
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,819
Ah, it's a long story,
Dean Higgins.

1512
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,029
It was really a terrible experience.

1513
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,698
Bradley, I'm not asking you.

1514
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,325
Look, Dean Higgins, Dexter's
been through quite a bit,

1515
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,327
but that really doesn't matter now.

1516
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,662
The main thing
is that we got him back.

1517
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:13,664
So you don't have to worry
about him.

1518
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,541
He's gonna be all right...

1519
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,293
I think.

1520
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:22,131
And so we arrive at the halfway
portion of our show

1521
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,426
with the score Springfield, 115,
Medfield, 20.

1522
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,472
Hey, that's Dexter.

1523
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,975
It looks like the missing panelist from
Medfield has finally shown up.

1524
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,102
There, ladies and gentlemen,

1525
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,647
we'll see now whether the old adage
"better late than never" can hold up.

1526
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,566
Medfield has quite a bit of
ground to make up,

1527
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,861
and, uh, we'll see whether the
man with the computerlike mind

1528
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,488
can, uh, can pull it off.

1529
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,823
It should be
an exciting second half.

1530
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:49,867
And we will begin,
peculiarly enough,

1531
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,369
by asking this 20-pointer
of Medfield.

1532
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:53,537
He's here.

1533
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,706
Would you please give us
the common name

1534
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,583
of the following species of birds.

1535
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,543
The Lagopus Scoticus,

1536
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,420
the Amazona Farinosa,

1537
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,047
and the Pica Pica?

1538
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:07,551
The Lagopus Scoticus
is the red grouse,

1539
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:11,472
the Amazona Farinosa
is the mag...

1540
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,893
Parrot, and the Pica Pica
is the magpie.

1541
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:19,063
That is absolutely correct!
20 points for Medfield.

1542
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,818
I tell you, Quigley,
it's in the bag.

1543
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,237
For 10 points each,

1544
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:28,364
could you tell us the capitals
of these countries.

1545
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:30,533
Pakistan, Mongolia, and Jordan?

1546
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:35,955
The capital of Pakistan
is Rawalpindi,

1547
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,916
Mongolia...

1548
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,047
Ulaanbaatar...

1549
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:48,592
Jordan is A...

1550
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,470
Amman.

1551
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:56,308
That's absolutely correct
for 30 points.

1552
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,981
Quigley, what's the matter with him?

1553
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:03,440
I think
he's falling apart.

1554
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,234
Now, Springfield State,

1555
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,028
please give us the victorious
army and generals

1556
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,406
in the following
Revolutionary War battles.

1557
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,950
The first battle of
Freeman Farm,

1558
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,827
Bennington,
and the Battle of Quebec.

1559
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,330
Bennington.

1560
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,500
Freeman Farm was under Stark,

1561
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,419
Bennington under Cornwallis,

1562
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:25,588
- and Quebec under Carleton.
- Sorry.

1563
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:29,174
The information is correct, but
the correlation is incorrect.

1564
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,594
Medfield, Freeman Farm,

1565
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,929
Bennington,
and the Battle of Quebec.

1566
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,808
Freeman Farm...

1567
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,185
The English...

1568
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:44,315
Under Corn-wallis.

1569
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:48,235
Benning-ton...

1570
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,698
Bennington...

1571
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:56,327
The Ameri-cans...

1572
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:58,996
Un-der...

1573
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,123
S...

1574
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:04,126
S... Stark.

1575
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,586
Quebec, Dexter.

1576
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,837
What about Quebec?

1577
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,341
The... En-glish...

1578
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:14,011
Un-der...

1579
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:18,223
Carle-ton.

1580
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,853
That's correct.

1581
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,610
We're getting there,

1582
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:31,528
but I don't know how much
more of this I can stand.

1583
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:35,824
Would you, Springfield State,
give us, in the proper order,

1584
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:38,369
the six largest bodies of water
in the world?

1585
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,792
The, uh, Pacific, Atlantic,
Indian, Arctic,

1586
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:47,378
Mediterranean, and Caribbean.

1587
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:50,255
Sorry, again.
The order is not quite correct.

1588
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,883
Medfield, you now have
an opportunity to go ahead.

1589
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:58,055
The Pacific,
At-lan-t-tic...

1590
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,850
In-di-an...

1591
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,895
A-ar-ctic...

1592
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:10,067
Car-i-bbe-an...

1593
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:14,571
And Med-i...

1594
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:17,116
Ttt-ttt...

1595
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,285
Ttt-tt...

1596
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,954
Terranean.

1597
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:26,125
That is absolutely correct.

1598
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:28,252
20 more points for Medfield.

1599
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:31,755
And with two minutes left,

1600
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,134
Medfield now has
a 15-point advantage.

1601
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,760
Maybe we can make it now.

1602
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,220
We live in hope.

1603
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,724
Now, a 10-pointer
for Springfield State.

1604
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,976
In the Congress
of the United States,

1605
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,936
there are 435 representatives.

1606
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,772
Please tell us
how many representatives

1607
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:51,108
come from states
west of the Mississippi.

1608
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:53,569
140?

1609
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,112
148.

1610
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,614
Out of 435 representatives,

1611
01:23:57,657 --> 01:24:00,617
148 come from states
west of the Mississippi.

1612
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,786
That is correct for 10 points,

1613
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:06,040
and Medfield's lead
is now cut to five points!

1614
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,127
Medfield...

1615
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,463
New York City was the first
capital of the United States.

1616
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:16,383
For 10 points, can you name the second
capital of the United States

1617
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,678
and what year it was moved
to Washington?

1618
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,598
Ph...

1619
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:25,726
Come on, Dexter.
Hang on for another minute.

1620
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:29,396
Ph...

1621
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,819
Phil-a-dee...

1622
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,655
El-phi-a...

1623
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:41,742
M-m-moved...

1624
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,703
I-i-i-i-in...

1625
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:49,124
Eight-t-t-t-t-teen...

1626
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:55,297
Eight-teeee-yump.

1627
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:58,634
"Yump?"

1628
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,972
Oh, he's gone, Quigley.
He's completely gone.

1629
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,186
Springfield...

1630
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,563
For 10 points and the lead,

1631
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:13,190
can you answer the question?

1632
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,609
The national capital moved

1633
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:19,822
from Philadelphia to
Washington, D.C., in 1800.

1634
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,032
That is absolutely correct!

1635
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,247
We have time now for one last question,

1636
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:30,374
a 10-pointer for Medfield.

1637
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,626
And this will determine the winner.

1638
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:35,212
A small, midwest city is located
exactly on an area

1639
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:38,423
designated as the geographic
center of the United States.

1640
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,844
For 10 points and $100,000,

1641
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:45,430
can you tell us the name of that city?

1642
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,433
Come on, Dexter. Think.

1643
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,602
I can't.

1644
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:52,396
I've had it!

1645
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:54,731
I'm just like I used to be!

1646
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:57,276
But you know this one.

1647
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,694
We talked about it before.

1648
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:00,070
Remember? It's that place

1649
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,114
where my uncle owns
the dry-cleaning store.

1650
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:04,491
I've told you about it
a thousand times.

1651
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:08,245
You know, they have those signs
at the edge of town that...

1652
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,167
I know.

1653
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,545
For the first time in 15 weeks,
I know an answer.

1654
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:19,631
I know!

1655
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,091
He knows?

1656
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:22,342
I know!

1657
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,678
Yes, well, sit down
and give us an answer.

1658
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:27,264
I know. I know, I know,
I know, I know!

1659
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:28,849
You have three seconds left.

1660
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,269
Lebanon. Lebanon, Kansas.

1661
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,479
That is absolutely correct,

1662
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:37,691
and Medfield wins
the $100,000 prize!

1663
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:08,055
We've gotta get outta here.

1664
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:30,202
Not here, stupid! Come on!

1665
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:31,703
- Yes!
- Now, take it easy!

1666
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:33,497
You almost killed me before!

1667
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,873
Don't worry, boss. Don't worry.

1668
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,505
Do you hear a siren?

1669
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,006
What siren?

1670
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,429
Why, you stupid...

1671
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,601
Don't worry about it, gentlemen.
We got insurance.

1672
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,195
But, Dean Higgins, it's new equipment

1673
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,030
like this electroheliospectrograph

1674
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,032
that's going to put Medfield on the map.

1675
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,576
Oh, really, Quigley,
an electroheliospectrogram?

1676
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:12,661
Graph, sir.

1677
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:13,996
Well, graph. Whatever.

1678
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:16,290
Everybody knows that I am
all for progress,

1679
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:17,791
but there are limits.

1680
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,877
You wanted a computer,
we got you a computer.

1681
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:24,548
Now, I'll admit, I was a little
bit reluctant at first,

1682
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,300
but we've got to remember,

1683
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:29,428
we can't do everything
that a state school can do.

1684
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,888
Now, there's Collingsgood,
sitting over there

1685
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:35,142
in the lap of luxury
with all that tax money,

1686
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:37,352
building, building, building.

1687
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,771
It's disgusting, all that building!

1688
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,523
I tell you, the trials

1689
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,567
and tribulations of administration

1690
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:46,236
weigh heavily on one today.

1691
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:52,826
It's not easy to be a dean
in a private school today.

1692
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,578
It's tough, tough, tough.

1693
01:28:57,623 --> 01:28:59,750
There they are again.

1694
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:02,794
Every time we meet, they meet.

1695
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:06,256
Maybe I can find out from
the gardener what's going on.

1696
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,633
Oh, uh, strike that, Winifred.

1697
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,261
No, I'm, I'm sorry, Quigley.

1698
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,638
The helioelectrospectrograph
is out.

1699
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:14,973
Electroheliospectrograph.

1700
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,475
Well, whatever it is, it's out.

1701
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,726
- It's, uh, gram?
- Graph.

1702
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,019
Graph. Out.

1703
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:20,771
Gentlemen,
I've made a decision

1704
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:22,939
on what we're going to do
with our award money.

1705
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:25,317
As you know, the building
and loan associations

1706
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:27,819
are paying an excellent rate
of interest.

1707
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:31,323
Now, if we were to put our funds
in one of these institutions,

1708
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:33,283
at the end of, say, uh, five years,

1709
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:36,036
the equivalent of interest would
obviously be considerable.

1710
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:39,664
And at that time I think it
would behoove us

1711
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,751
to look into the long-neglected
plumbing situation.

1712
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,461
- Plumbing?
- Plumbing, are you kidding?

1713
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:45,545
How do you like that?

1714
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,881
We kill ourselves
on that program,

1715
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:50,926
and Higgins wants to spend
the dough on plumbing.

1716
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,387
Poor Quig. You know,
we ought to figure a way

1717
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:55,013
to get him one of those things.

1718
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,181
Yeah, that's for sure.

1719
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:57,349
See you later.

1720
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:58,892
Oh, yeah. See you later.

1721
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:03,438
Hey, Dexter, what's an
electroheliospectrogram?

1722
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,815
Heck, I don't know.

1723
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:07,818
I don't know either,
but if we ever get one,

1724
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:10,153
don't fool around with it, okay?

1725
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,988
Okay.
