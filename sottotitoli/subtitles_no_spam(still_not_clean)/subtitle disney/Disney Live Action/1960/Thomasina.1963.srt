00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,677
<i>Who is the most
self-reliant animal</i>

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,847
<i>made since the world began?</i>

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,983
<i>Who can be the most
defiant animal</i>

4
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:21,453
<i>known to the world of man?</i>

5
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,956
<i>born with emerald eyes</i>

6
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,359
<i>so cold, so warm, so wise</i>

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,928
<i>within her kingdom lies</i>

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,499
<i>the world's arena</i>

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,969
<i>do we need to ask
more than that?</i>

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,105
<i>you must know now
it's a cat</i>

11
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:43,275
<i>but a very important cat
at that</i>

12
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,445
<i>who's called...</i>

13
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,679
<i>Thomasina!</i>

14
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,184
<i>Thomasina</i>

15
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,555
<i>what are you thinking now?</i>

16
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,258
<i>Thomasina</i>

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,529
<i>what makes you so highbrow?</i>

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,832
<i>for I do think it very odd</i>

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,335
<i>if you are an Egyptian God</i>

20
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,171
<i>that the wee, little mouse</i>

21
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,039
<i>runs in and out his house</i>

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,076
<i>each time you blink or nod</i>

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,678
<i>Thomasina</i>

24
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,415
<i>though you may love to roam</i>

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,151
<i>Thomasina</i>

26
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:30,456
<i>don't go too far from home</i>

27
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,359
<i>there are beasties
in the garden</i>

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,763
<i>who would never accept
your pardon</i>

29
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,833
<i>if you left
the jungle yard in</i>

30
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,136
<i>which we play</i>

31
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,605
<i>Thomasina</i>

32
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:51,210
<i>don't ever run away</i>

33
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,665
<i>Thomasina</i>

34
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,067

35
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,669
<i>Thomasina</i>

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,438
<i>though you've seen a</i>

<i>little bird leave the bough</i>

<i>Thomasina</i>

39
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,646
<i>even if it's
a lark or dove, you</i>

40
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,383
<i>let them all
fly away above you</i>

41
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,786
<i>but I guess I'll always
love you</i>

42
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,656
<i>anyhow</i>

43
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,624
<i>Thomasina</i>

44
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:18,397
<i>come along with me now</i>

45
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,159
<i>Thomasina</i>

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,729
<i>I love you anyhow</i>

47
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,233
<i>Thomasi...</i>

48
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,569
<i>Yes, I am Thomasina.</i>

49
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,405
<i>This story's all about me.</i>

50
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,841
<i>I'm a self-made cat,</i>

51
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,244
<i>And here's the house
I live in</i>

52
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,479
<i>With the Macdhui family,</i>

53
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,382
<i>Whom I'd adopted
when they first came here.</i>

54
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,786
<i>They started off
by calling me Thomas,</i>

55
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,323
<i>But when they, well,
got to know me better,</i>

56
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,859
<i>They changed that
to Thomasina.</i>

57
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,295
<i>Humans are funny that way.</i>

58
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,797
<i>That the Macdhuis
are a happy family</i>

59
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,066
<i>Is entirely due to me.</i>

60
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,836
<i>I made them
what they are today...</i>

61
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,739
<i>Although I had to be
murdered first.</i>

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,209
<i>Here's the scene
of the crime -</i>

63
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,512
<i>Inveranoch, in Scotland,</i>

64
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,782
<i>In 1912.</i>

65
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:52,190
<i>And this is Mr. Andrew Macdhui.</i>

66
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,527
<i>From a cat's point of view,
even before my murder,</i>

67
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,230
<i>He was a most difficult man,</i>

68
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,265
<i>Believe me.</i>

69
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,804
<i>His wife had died sometime
before he came here,</i>

70
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,472
<i>So there was just himself</i>

71
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,575
<i>And Mrs. Mackenzie,
his housekeeper,</i>

72
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,377
<i>And Mary, his daughter.</i>

73
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,380
<i>I'd moved in on them a few days
after they'd arrived,</i>

74
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,383
<i>And on the whole,
I got on with them very well,</i>

75
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,520
<i>Though mostly
because of Mary Macdhui.</i>

76
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,990
<i>She appreciated
my rather special qualities</i>

77
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,692
<i>From the start.</i>

78
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,928
Thomasina, there you are.

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,333
<i>Of course I had
this sort of thing</i>

80
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,834
<i>To put up with every day -</i>

81
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,403
<i>Fussed over,
treated like a doll,</i>

82
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,505
<i>Being dressed up...</i>

83
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,141
<i>And over a fur coat, too!</i>

84
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,615
<i>Everything that happened
to me from here on</i>

85
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,451
<i>Was due, in a way,</i>

86
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,153
<i>To a blind man and his dog.</i>

87
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:59,224
<i>Here they are now -
Tammas and Bruce.</i>

88
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,592
Good morning,
Tammas.

89
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,960
Good morning, Mary.

90
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,529
Say good morning to Tammas
and Bruce, Thomasina.

91
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,699
Good morning, Thomasina.

92
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,369
She's not in a very
talkative mood today.

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,405
I have the same trouble
with Bruce here.

94
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,807
He can be very reserved
at times.

95
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,643
Isn't that right, laddie?

96
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,380
But what would we do
without them, you and me?

97
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,115
Where are you going?

98
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,418
Oh, just to get some tobacco
for my pipe.

99
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,420
Mind how you go, Tammas.

100
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,722
Och, Bruce is my eyes,
lassie.

101
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,658
Come on, say goodbye
to Thomasina.

102
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,196
Be good now, Mary.

103
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,967
Thomasina, it's rude
not to answer

104
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,535
When you're spoken to.

105
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,740
Aah!

106
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,913
Hello, Geordie.

107
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,416
Oh, what have you
got there?

108
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,418
I found him
down by the loch.

109
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,353
I think his leg's broken.

110
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,355
He can't hop or swim
or anything.

111
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,792
Oh, he looks fair sick.

112
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,460
Doesn't he, Thomasina?

113
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,330
Ah! Don't touch.

114
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,669
Why don't you go and
ask my daddy to cure him?

115
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,306
Och, I don't know.
Do you think he would?

116
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,442
My daddy
can cure anything -

117
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,645
Dogs and cows and cats
and lions and pigs and...

118
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,447
Aye, but frogs?

119
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,915
And frogs.

120
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,516
Everything.

121
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,151
You take him in, then.

122
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,455
Och, I'm not allowed
in the surgery.

123
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,023
You go, Geordie.

124
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,525
Well, if you say so.

125
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,733
I'm only saying I'm here against my
better judgment, minister, that's all.

126
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,403
You'll be glad
you listened to me, Dobbie.

127
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,338
Mr. Macdhui's a clever man.

128
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,340
Maybe so, but up till now,

129
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,843
I've never found much wrong
with dosing Jock here

130
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,611
With Watson’s
patent powders.

131
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,180
Ah, you must move
with the times, man.

132
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,015
Macdhui's
a man of science.

133
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,518
Aye. I Haven't heard tell
much good of that.

134
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,153
Ha! Book learnin'.

135
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,893
Up at Kinkairale's farm,
they're grateful enough to him.

136
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,262
Two hundred sheep cured
of the foot rot

137
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,663
And not one lost.

138
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,166
Aye, you're a good persuader,
Mr. Peddie,

139
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,168
But farm beasts
are one thing.

140
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,903
A man's pet is another.

141
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,239
You wait and see.

142
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,241
Och, I'll give him a try.

143
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,210
No one can say
I'm not a fair man,

144
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,013
<i>But it's for him
to convince me.</i>

145
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,918
How old is this dog,
Mrs. Laggan?

146
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,586
Fifteen years and a bit.

147
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,755
I've had him
since he was a puppy,

148
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,423
The year my husband died.

149
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,926
He's been ailing
a wee bit this past year

150
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,928
But not so sick as this.

151
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,429
Well, he's very old.

152
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,099
The kindest thing would be
to have him put to sleep.

153
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,068
Oh, no. You see how bad
he is with the asthma.

154
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,870
The poor dog
can hardly breathe.

155
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,438
He's in pain, Mrs. Laggan.

156
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,808
But you can't put Rabbie
to sleep, Mr. Macdhui,

157
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,911
Or I wouldn't have come.

158
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,213
He's all I have in the world.

159
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,916
Couldn't you give him
a wee bit of medicine

160
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,251
To tide him over
till he's well again?

161
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,587
There is no medicine
that can make him well.

162
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,589
He's very old,
he's in great pain,

163
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,058
And his life is a misery
to him, can't you see?

164
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,394
But I can't lose him.

165
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,130
What would I do without him?

166
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,732
<i>Poor Rabbie.</i>

167
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,969
Be fair now. It's yourself
you're pitying, not the dog.

168
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,671
Oh, dear.

169
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,240
I don't know what to do.

170
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,909
I've told you what I think
is for the best.

171
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,911
Now I've told you
it's up to you

172
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,846
To make up your mind.

173
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,350
Very well.

174
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:50,055
I suppose
if he is suffering...

175
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,090
You'll be gentle with him?

176
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,927
He won't feel a thing.
He'll just go to sleep.

177
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,095
Willie?

178
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,065
Fifteen years.

179
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,501
Poor Rabbie.
Poor Rabbie.

180
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,004
You're doing the right thing.
It's for his sake.

181
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,173
Oh, no,
there'll be no charge.

182
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,141
Just leave him here
with me.

183
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,624
You're leaving Rabbie
to be cured, then, Annie?

184
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,293
Mr. Macdhui says
there's no cure.

185
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,328
He's to be put away.

186
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,430
<i>now, Mrs. Laggan,
that's a shame.</i>

187
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,232
No cure for him?

188
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,968
If it was my dog, I'd want a
second opinion, I'm thinkin'.

189
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,637
I'll go with you, Annie.

190
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,639
Good day to you,
Mr. Macdhui.

191
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,074
Good day, sir.

192
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,209
Good day.

193
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,444
Who's next, please?

194
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,446
Please, sir, Mr. Macdhui?

195
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,981
Uh-oh. Who are you?

196
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,083
Geordie Macnab,
please, sir.

197
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,419
I'm a bit of a friend
of Mary's.

198
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,122
I found him
down by the loch.

199
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,790
He's hurt his leg.

200
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,092
Can you make him better,
please, sir?

201
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,395
No one can cure
a hurt frog, Geordie.

202
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,664
You put him back
where you found him.

203
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,365
But he might die.

204
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,934
Could you not mend
his leg, please, sir?

205
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,370
No, nature's the only doctor
can do that, laddie.

206
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,572
Come on, now.
Come on, off you go.

207
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,707
I'm busy.

208
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,411
You've lost another
customer, Andrew.

209
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,413
Is there really nothing
you can do

210
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,914
About old Mrs. Laggan's dog?

211
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,517
No, not a thing, just put it
out of its misery.

212
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,354
Well, whoever's next,
Will you come in, please?

213
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,923
Oh, it's all right,
Mrs. Campbell.

214
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,060
You go in ahead of me.
I'm in no hurry.

215
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,297
<i>hey, there's Geordie.</i>

216
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,101
What have you been
doing in there?

217
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,537
I took my sick frog
to Mr. Macdhui.

218
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,105
Oh, aye.
What did he say, then?

219
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,107
He wouldn't even
look at him,

220
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,409
And he's going to kill
Mrs. Laggan's Rabbie.

221
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,144
Kill him? Rabbie?

222
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,213
Aye, I heard him say so.

223
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,716
It's just like grandfather
says about him -

224
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,718
He's only good
with farm beasts.

225
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,953
He's not interested
in people's pets.

226
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,956
A frog Will die
if he can't hop or swim.

227
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,791
I'm not going to
let him die.

228
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,727
What are you
gonna do, then,

229
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,662
Cure him by magic
or something?

230
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,996
Come on, Jamie.

231
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,732
Why don't you take your frog

232
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,734
To the witch woman
livin' in the Glen?

233
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,235
She's supposed to do magic.

234
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,304
Well, why don't you?

235
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,306
Our mother says
the witch woman's crazy

236
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,341
And we're not
to go up there.

237
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,343
Och, you're just afraid,
the pair of you.

238
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,912
I'm not afraid of anything,
and neither is Geordie.

239
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,848
Are you, Geordie?

240
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,185
Right. Let's take the frog
to her, all three of us.

241
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,520
I dare you.

242
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,156
Very well.

243
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,525
Geordie, we'll all go.

244
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:44,262
You want to get your frog
cured, don't you?

245
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,664
We don't have to
tell mother we went.

246
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,166
I was only joking.

247
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,703
No, you weren't.
You dared us.

248
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,805
<i>I think
you're afraid to go.</i>

249
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,907
Me, afraid?

250
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,442
Let's go now.

251
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,285
Come on.
Keep up with us.

252
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,019
You'd think they were
all telling on us.

253
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,222
Aye. Are you afraid
to go on, then?

254
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,590
No.

255
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,192
Well, come on.

256
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,378
Whisht! Listen.

257
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,848
It's the witch singing
and banging a drum.

258
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,251
She is crazy.

259
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,687
I want to go home.

260
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,223
When you've got this far?
What about your frog?

261
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,559
Put your box under the tree
and ring the bell.

262
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,561
Aye, go on, Geordie.
We'll wait for you here.

263
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,496
No, no! Go on, Geordie. Go on.

264
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,910
Come on, Geordie.

265
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,559
Go away. Go away.

266
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,327
Go away. Go away.

267
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,265
Larry, come back here.

268
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,174
Oh, your leg is broken.

269
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,111
You poor wee thing.

270
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,548
Has somebody brought you
up here to be cured

271
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,617
By the mad witch
in the Glen?

272
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,889
Eye of newt and hair of dog,

273
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,659
Give me the power
to cure the frog.

274
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,595
<i>listen. Magic.</i>

275
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,497
Off to my cauldron.

276
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,966
Where is my broom?

277
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,593
Och, you poor wee thing.

278
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,133
I don't know why
I bother

279
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,135
To dose that dog
of yours.

280
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,338
The worst thing that's
wrong with him is his owner.

281
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,839
Don't give him sugar.

282
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,175
Aw, but he has
a sweet tooth, Andrew.

283
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,477
Poor old Finn.
Look how pleased he is.

284
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,313
You think more of his
affection and gratitude for you

285
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,148
Than you do of his health.

286
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,150
All you people with pets
are the same.

287
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,152
That's why he's too fat,
poor brute.

288
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,887
"brute,"
he calls you, Finn.

289
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,889
Oh! That's part of the reason

290
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,392
Why folks here are slow
to accept your doctoring.

291
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,395
You show no feeling
for the sick animals you treat,

292
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,097
The animals they love.

293
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,933
Are sentimental about, you
mean, to the point of not knowing

294
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,869
What's best for them, like you and
Mrs. Laggan who was here just now.

295
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,604
Poor old Annie.

296
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,439
Poor old Annie.

297
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,608
Poor old brute of a dog,
you should say.

298
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,444
You thought I was hard on her
just now, didn't you?

299
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,280
My job is to relieve suffering
in animals.

300
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,083
The tribulations of the soul
I leave to you.

301
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,752
She'll get over it, angus.

302
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,087
Aye, but when someone
you love dies,

303
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,555
Something of yourself
dies, too.

304
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,458
<i>You think you have to
tell me that?</i>

305
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,029
Oh, I'm sorry, Andrew.

306
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,897
Forgive me.

307
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,200
That dog of hers was all old
Annie Laggan had left to love.

308
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,236
At least you're not alone.

309
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,670
No.

310
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,441
Look at her now.

311
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:32,183
Thomasina, where are you?

312
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,923
Thomasina?

313
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,826
Be careful.

314
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,896
It's the jungle.

315
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,000
It's a million Miles thick.

316
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,502
It's full of lions
and tigers.

317
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,409
Thomasina!
Thomasina, come back!

318
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,677
Have you lost
something, Mary?

319
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:04,415
Shh! We're hunting lions.

320
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,251
Lions? Here?

321
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,921
Geordie, where's your frog?
Did daddy cure him?

322
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,522
No, he wouldn't try.

323
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,624
We took it to the witch in the Glen.

324
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,993
<i>You didn't. I did. We all did.</i>

325
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,097
You saw her?
Is she a real witch?

326
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,265
Aye, we saw her
chant magic over the frog

327
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,267
And take it into her house.

328
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,036
Did you speak to her?

329
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,038
Och, no. She's queer
in the head.

330
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,040
She's got a big drum
in the house.

331
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,209
She bangs on it
and sings awful weird.

332
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,777
There's all kinds
of animals there.

333
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,179
Did she fly
on a broomstick?

334
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,015
Well, not exactly fly.

335
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,550
But she had one, though.

336
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,352
Weren't you afraid?

337
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,022
Well, I wouldn't recommend
just anybody goin' up there.

338
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,357
You were afraid.

339
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,026
You made Geordie take
the frog to the tree.

340
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,229
<i>That was you.
I wasn't afraid.</i>

341
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,798
You must be awful brave.

342
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,835
I am... A bit.

343
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,310
Uh... Remember, angus,

344
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,312
Just keep him
off the sugar.

345
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,649
Well, I can try.
Hello, Mary.

346
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,818
Geordie Macnab took his
frog you wouldn't cure

347
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,320
To a witch who does magic
and flies on a broomstick.

348
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,489
She could have turned him
into a frog,

349
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,725
And it would have been
all your fault.

350
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,827
Mary, Mr. Andrew,
I'm waiting for you.

351
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,264
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.

352
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,499
Thomasina!
Never mind Thomasina.

353
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,236
Dinnertime!

354
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,238
Come on, now, inside.
Wash your hands.

355
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,740
There's a good girl.

356
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,241
That's enough
about witches.

357
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,510
Mrs. Mackenzie Will
tell you the same as me -

358
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,512
There aren't any
outside of storybooks.

359
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,813
Oh, yes, there are.

360
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,049
She been making up more
of her fairy tales?

361
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,119
I didn't make it up. There
is a witch in the Glen.

362
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Och, the Glen.

363
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,722
She bangs a big drum
in her house.

364
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,959
And lives with wild animals
and rides a broomstick.

365
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,294
Jamie Macnab told me.

366
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,863
He and Hughie
and Geordie saw her.

367
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,865
They're filling your head
with nonsense.

368
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,501
And for the hundredth time, Will
you not feed that cat at the table?

369
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,502
Especially with meat.

370
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,538
She likes meat,
and there is a witch.

371
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,873
Now, Mary...

372
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,510
It's a poor wee soul
called Lori Macgregor

373
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,313
That's rented a croft
in the Glen from Mr. Peddie.

374
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,683
She spends most of her time
weaving on a handloom.

375
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,918
That's the "drums"
your friends heard.

376
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,720
Now what do you say?

377
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,122
She's a witch.

378
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,261
She's a wee bit weird,
that's true enough.

379
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,263
It seems she's a lassie

380
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,298
That doesn't mix
with other folk,

381
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,834
But, mind, she's not
been there long.

382
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,170
Some of the shepherds
in the Glen say

383
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,006
She has a rare way with
beasts and birds and that.

384
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,008
Now, mind Thomasina
doesn't spill her cream.

385
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,510
Cream?

386
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,980
Oh, just a wee drop,
Mr. Andrew.

387
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,649
It helps her
to see in the dark.

388
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,319
She told me so.
Didn't you, Thomasina?

389
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,121
There, you hear?

390
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,591
Ask her if she'd like me to go out
and get my rod and catch her a salmon.

391
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,860
<i>Thomasina...</i>

392
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,631
She says, no,

393
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,966
She'd rather go to
the store on market day

394
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,968
And choose
her own fish.

395
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,337
Aye.

396
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,213
Come on, now, no more talk
about witches or magic.

397
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,049
Just say your prayers,
get into bed.

398
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,252
And look after mummy in Heaven
and us down here,

399
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,288
Especially daddy
and Mrs. Mackenzie

400
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,958
And Willie and Geordie and Jamie
and Hughie and Tammas and Bruce

401
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,327
And Geordie's frog
and Thomasina and me.

402
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,164
That's all till tomorrow.
Yours truly, Mary. Amen.

403
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,534
Good night,
yours truly Mary.

404
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,269
Slippers?

405
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,971
Up. In you get.

406
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,142
There we are.

407
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,643
Good night.

408
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,111
Good night, daddy.

409
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,053
<i>Thomasina.</i>

410
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,723
I've told you about that
before, my bonny.

411
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,826
You mustn't keep that cat
on the bed at night.

412
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,860
There.

413
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,529
Oh, please let me
have her.

414
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,531
No, you can have your doll
if you like.

415
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,766
I don't want my doll.
Please.

416
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,269
She must go out
and you must go to sleep.

417
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,271
Go on, lie down.
There's a good girl.

418
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,339
Good night.
Good night.

419
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,873
Good night, Thomasina.

420
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,610
You know.

421
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,514
<i>Yes, I knew,</i>

422
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,383
<i>And Macdhui didn't.</i>

423
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,418
<i>This being put out
for the night</i>

424
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,254
<i>Was just nonsense.</i>

425
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,825
<i>I could get in again
anytime I wanted to.</i>

426
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,461
<i>Mary and I
had it all worked out.</i>

427
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,630
<i>It was as easy as that.</i>

428
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,468
Thomasina.

429
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,938
Thomasina, come on up.

430
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,574
<i>But not tonight.</i>

431
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,843
<i>I'd remembered
it was Wednesday,</i>

432
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,112
<i>The night before market day.</i>

433
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,547
<i>They set up the stalls at dawn,</i>

434
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,117
<i>So Wednesday's
always my night out.</i>

435
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,757
<i>And just when I was beginning
to feel like breakfast,</i>

436
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,693
<i>The market was getting ready
to provide it.</i>

437
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,743
<i>Fish, fresh fish,</i>

438
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,779
<i>And the best sauce for it -</i>

439
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,515
<i>The danger of helping myself...</i>

440
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,957
<i>...Which needed cunning
and caution,</i>

441
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,428
<i>A lot of caution...</i>

442
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,363
<i>And speed!</i>

443
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,207
You, get out of the way!
Get out!

444
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,608
Mary?

445
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,547
Mary, come and have
your breakfast.

446
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,382
What's the child
doing?

447
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,583
Mary!

448
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,388
I can't find Thomasina.
I've looked everywhere.

449
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,224
She can't be far away.
Come on, now, sit down.

450
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,792
She didn't come home
last night.

451
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,794
For what we're
about to receive,

452
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,196
May the lord make us
truly thankful.

453
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,731
Amen.
I'm not hungry.

454
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,967
Daddy, she must be lost.

455
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,735
Of course not.

456
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,538
Cats don't get lost once they've
decided to move in on people.

457
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,374
She's just had a night out and
hasn't come back yet, that's all.

458
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,376
She's been out
all night before,

459
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,245
But she's always come back.

460
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,582
She climbs up the tree
and gets in my window.

461
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,250
What?
She always has.

462
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,918
It's our secret.

463
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,322
Aye, it certainly is.

464
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,324
Well, I'm off
to the surgery now.

465
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,459
Be a good girl.
Eat your breakfast.

466
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,662
Don't worry about
the pussy, child.

467
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,564
But she's lost.

468
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,067
Thomasina's too clever
to get lost.

469
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,537
You do like her, don't you?

470
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,372
Aye, of course.

471
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:12,743
Would you do anything for her
if I asked you to?

472
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,545
Promise?

473
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,413
Aye.

474
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,850
Well, let me go and look
for her now, please.

475
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,652
You promised.

476
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:25,489
You're even craftier than
Thomasina, you wee monkey.

477
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,467
We'll split up.
Mary, you come with me.

478
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,877
Hey, what are you
lookin' for, son?

479
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,213
A lost cat.
Have you seen one?

480
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,216
Not at my stall. Away
you go. Go on. I'm busy.

481
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,985
She's a big... Mrs.
Macfarland, what would you like?

482
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,121
Nice cabbage.

483
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,724
Have you seen
a lost cat?

484
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,633
Thank you very much.

485
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,237
Drat the cat!

486
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,944
Och, it's not Thomasina.

487
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,313
But never mind.
We'll find her.

488
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,015
Hughie, Mary,
I've found her!

489
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,451
She's here, Mary!

490
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,755
Oh, Thomasina.
Give her to me.

491
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,857
I don't think
anything's broken,

492
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,494
But she's
terribly stiff.

493
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,431
Oh, poor Thomasina.

494
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,035
I couldn't help it,
constable.

495
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,471
He walked
right in front of me.

496
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,109
<i>it looks
like Bruce.</i>

497
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,979
Bruce? My Bruce?

498
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,315
What's all this about?

499
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,017
Och, Mr. Macdhui.

500
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,285
You're just here
in time.

501
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,853
It's Tammas' Bruce.

502
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:03,854
Where is he?

503
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,356
Steady now, Tammas.
Steady.

504
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,891
He's fair crushed, sir.

505
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,461
I couldn't help it,
Mr. Macdhui.

506
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,463
Better get him back
to the surgery - quick.

507
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,965
Bruce is my eyes,
Mr. Macdhui.

508
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,235
Can you save him? I'll do what
I can. Stay with him, angus.

509
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,739
He's in good hands now, Tammas.
Now, come on, you come with me.

510
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,241
This is going to take
a long time.

511
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,243
I hope his heart
Will stand it.

512
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,178
Are you ready?

513
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,627
The Spencer wells, Willie.

514
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,840
How is he, Willie?

515
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,543
He's doin' fine.

516
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,754
What are you children doing?

517
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,091
Mary, go away from here.

518
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,260
Daddy, it's Thomasina.
She's hurt.

519
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,428
Go away, child.

520
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,730
Please look at her.
She's awful sick.

521
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,765
Here, Willie,
take this cat.

522
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,702
Daddy, daddy, please look
at her. Please make her well.

523
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,370
Mary, you mustn't
stay here.

524
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,905
Now, listen to me.

525
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,541
I've got blind Tammas'
dog here. He's badly hurt.

526
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,243
Well, so is Thomasina.
If you only look at her!

527
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,913
All right, I'll look at
her, but go away, all of you.

528
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,981
You'll make her well?
You promise?

529
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,616
Yes, I promise,
but go on out.

530
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,585
Come on.
Out, all of you.

531
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,389
I think you better
look at her, sir.

532
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,391
Not now, man.
We got work to do.

533
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,259
Mr. Macdhui, sir, look.

534
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,935
Quick, get her out of here,
and that cloth she's laying on.

535
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,504
That cat has tetanus.
Get her out of here.

536
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,107
Deal with her, disinfect
your hands and hurry back.

537
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,643
But, sir... Mr. Macdhui,
you promised the child.

538
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:10,247
The cat is beyond help.
Will you do as I tell you?

539
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,683
Hurry up, man.
We've the dog to seal.

540
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,953
Aye, I Will.

541
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,654
I Will.

542
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,698
Nearly an hour
already.

543
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,167
How much longer
can it be?

544
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,302
Aye, the waiting
is hard.

545
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,306
Well, Bruce Will live, Tammas.

546
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,641
He'll even walk again.

547
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,377
Thank God.

548
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,478
Take me to him.

549
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,980
Not now.
He's still unconscious.

550
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,482
But I'll send Willie round
to fetch you this evening.

551
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,017
Bruce Will know you then.

552
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,352
And he'll get better?

553
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,820
Aye, be as good as new.

554
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,322
It's a great skill
you have, Mr. Macdhui,

555
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,158
And no one can deny it.

556
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,893
There now,
what did I tell you?

557
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,428
Come on, Tammas,
I'll take you home.

558
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,331
God bless you,
Mr. Macdhui.

559
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,167
God bless you.

560
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,040
His pulse rate's fine.

561
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,843
I'll stay with him
till he wakes.

562
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,279
Aye, he'll do.

563
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:21,385
I never thought to see
such a surgery as that.

564
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,720
Aye, and what
you have to do now

565
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,722
Will be just as hard,
I'm thinking.

566
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,025
You have to tell the child
about her cat.

567
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,199
"the shoeblack tries
his bread to earn

568
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,268
"and would
an honest penny turn.

569
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,171
"when mud upon our boots
leave stains,

570
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,074
"his ready help
good payment gains.

571
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,844
The beefeater
we see today... "

572
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,047
Daddy, Thomasina -
is she better?

573
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,549
She's out of pain, Mary.

574
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,618
What was wrong with her?

575
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,154
Let me go to her.

576
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,656
She is better, isn't she?

577
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,794
Mary, uh, now,
Will you listen?

578
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,796
Listen to me
just a minute.

579
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,798
You see,
there are some things

580
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,868
That you have to learn
to face,

581
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,337
Even if at first
they seem a bit unfair.

582
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,538
Where is she?

583
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,741
Thomasina's wound
was poisoned,

584
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,611
And she might have made other
people's pets ill, even die.

585
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,479
But you did save her?

586
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,384
I- I couldn't, Mary.
I couldn't.

587
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,654
See, there are some things your
daddy can do and some things he can't.

588
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,523
What did you do to her?

589
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:37,494
I, uh, had her put to sleep.

590
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,197
There was nothing else
I could do.

591
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,499
Now, try to understand, Mary.

592
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,535
No! No! You said
you'd make her better.

593
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,804
You promised! You
promised! Come on, Mary...

594
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,174
I'll never speak to you
again! Mary, please...

595
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,877
He promised,
and he's killed Thomasina!

596
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,946
She's dead!

597
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,216
I'll go up to her.

598
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,352
Aye.

599
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,389
And take everything she was
wearing when she found the cat.

600
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,391
Everything, do you hear?

601
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,393
And burn what you can't boil.

602
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,929
I didn't realize she was
going to take it so hard.

603
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,032
Could you not
have saved the cat?

604
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,034
It was wounded,
infected with tetanus.

605
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,836
I did what was right.

606
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,105
I'll get her another cat.

607
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,641
Can't I?

608
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,044
Well? Can't I?

609
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,615
Well, I'll buy her
anything she wants.

610
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,852
Why did she take it so hard?

611
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,387
For a clever man,

612
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,690
You've an awful lot
to learn.

613
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,199
Don't be so sad.
You'll do yourself harm.

614
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,368
Look, I tell you
what we'll do.

615
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,371
We'll give Thomasina the best
funeral any cat ever had, won't we?

616
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,673
Aye, with a full service
and everything.

617
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,675
My mother's got
just the right box

618
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,510
That'd do fine
for a casket.

619
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,946
We could pick some flowers
and have a procession,

620
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,948
Like when Old Dougal
was buried.

621
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,950
Everyone in the village
would see us.

622
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,785
Aye, you'll wear
widow's mournings

623
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,654
And walk behind
the casket, weeping.

624
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,323
And Annie here,
she can be chief mourner.

625
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,359
I can cry awful loud, Mary.

626
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,927
<i>not now.</i>

627
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,998
Will I wear a hat
and a black coat?

628
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,666
Mrs. Mackenzie
has one.

629
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,502
Aye, we'll all dress up
and get everyone to come.

630
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,504
I know! Jamie's
just learning the pipes.

631
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,840
He's not very good... I can
play Macktintosh's lament!

632
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,743
I'll wear my dress kilt with
my skean dhu and sporran,

633
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,013
And everyone in the street Will say,
"there goes the poor widow Macdhui,

634
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,315
"a-burying
of her dear Thomasina,

635
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,784
Foully done to death,
God rest her soul. "

636
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,520
Will they? Really?

637
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,522
Aye. It'll be a great,
great procession.

638
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,890
You'll see.

639
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,892
We'll go
and get Thomasina now!

640
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,527
Aye, come on.

641
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:55,332
<i>I opened my eyes,</i>

642
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,901
<i>And where was I?</i>

643
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,903
<i>They say that to die</i>

644
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,706
<i>Is a Journey from light
into darkness,</i>

645
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,042
<i>But here was light again.</i>

646
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:10,280
<i>This was no quiet
endless sleep.</i>

647
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,783
<i>I was flying,</i>

648
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,985
<i>Flying wildly,</i>

649
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,454
<i>Without weight or effort,</i>

650
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,257
<i>Diving, spinning,</i>

651
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,926
<i>Falling backward
and downward</i>

652
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,796
<i>Into the mists of time,</i>

653
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,898
<i>Where my ancestors
were worshipped</i>

654
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,734
<i>In the temples to bast</i>

655
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,703
<i>Thousands of years ago.</i>

656
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,531
<i>Bast, the cat goddess,</i>

657
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:38,335
<i>The goddess
with the golden eyes</i>

658
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,905
<i>Staring and staring,</i>

659
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,175
<i>Drawing me upward and upward</i>

660
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:49,579
<i>And upward and upward.</i>

661
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,649
<i>Then there were flowers,</i>

662
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,352
<i>Flowers everywhere,</i>

663
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:59,022
<i>All around me,
touching me,</i>

664
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,591
<i>And the sound of music</i>

665
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:04,594
<i>Wild enough
to wake the dead.</i>

666
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,564
<i>playing
"mackintosh's lament")</i>

667
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,283
Lord sakes,

668
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,819
What are the children
a- burying today?

669
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,355
Mary Macdhui's cat
Thomasina.

670
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,457
My grandson Hughie
told me

671
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,527
Her father couldna be
bothered to cure its sickness.

672
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,229
His own daughter's pet.

673
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,898
Ah, well, maybe
he was busy at the time,

674
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,300
You know,
what wi' Tammas' dog,

675
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,203
And after all,
it's a blind man's eyes.

676
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,872
His own daughter's pet.

677
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,375
It's hard to understand.

678
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,579
Right.
This is far enough.

679
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,514
Put it here.

680
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,584
Now get some stones and
build a cairn for the grave.

681
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,656
Now get
the coffin off

682
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,125
And put it down
just there, you two.

683
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,259
Come on, hurry.

684
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,366
Now get
some stones.

685
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,435
Come on,
get some stones.

686
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,540
That'll do fine.

687
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,911
Now, let's get on
with the service.

688
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,748
I'm going to take
the service.

689
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,750
It was my idea.
No, you're not.

690
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,752
I'm the oldest,
and I've come prepared.

691
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,121
Brethren, friends,
and fellow mourners...

692
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,756
<i>och! Go on, then.</i>

693
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,758
We have come here
today

694
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,760
To bury Thomasina
and to praise her.

695
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,797
She was the friend of Mary
Macdhui here, who you all know.

696
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,566
Uh, eh, well, anyway,
there she is.

697
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,203
Shh! Not yet.
Hold your noise.

698
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,872
Thomasina was one of the best
cats in all Argyllshire,

699
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,208
And we all feel for her
best friend and owner.

700
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,544
Whisht!
Not yet, not yet.

701
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,413
There is no doubt that Thomasina
was a terrific mouser, too.

702
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,382
She had a few faults, aye,

703
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,185
But I won't mention
them here.

704
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,388
Uh, and her mortal remains
Will now be laid to rest.

705
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,657
Now!

706
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:28,031
<i>playing "the Bonny Banks
O' Loch Lomond")</i>

707
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:33,002
<i>by yon bonny banks
and by yon bonny braes</i>

708
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:38,308
<i>where the sun shines bright
on Loch Lomond</i>

709
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:43,546
<i>where me and my true love
Will never meet again</i>

710
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:49,119
<i>on the bonny, bonny banks
of Loch Lomond</i>

711
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,490
<i>oh, ye'll tak' the high road
and I'll tak' the...</i>

712
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,758
It's mad Lori.

713
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,594
<i>and I'll be
in Scotland afore...</i>

714
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,928
It's the witch!

715
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,097
She's coming for us.
Run for it!

716
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,098
Run quickly!

717
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,099
She's a witch!

718
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
Run for it!

719
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,336
The witch!
The witch!

720
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,696
What were they doing?

721
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,332
Your heart's still beating.

722
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,869
Oh, poor thing.

723
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,972
Didn't they know?

724
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,974
You come with me.

725
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,647
Mary, come on in
and get your supper.

726
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,317
Hello, Mary.

727
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,190
What have you been doing
all afternoon?

728
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,459
Mary, your father's
speaking to you.

729
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,294
Mrs. Mackenzie,
I've seen the witch

730
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,129
That lives
up in the Glen.

731
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,297
What?

732
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,299
We all ran away
from her...

733
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,068
Hughie and Geordie and
Jamie and Jock and Annie.

734
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,636
What's this
nonsense now?

735
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,972
And what were you doing
in the Glen?

736
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,208
And she is a witch.

737
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,910
I've seen her.
So there.

738
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,914
Mary, the... The kittens that
Mr. Peddie's cat Amanda had

739
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,916
Are now ready
to leave their mother.

740
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,752
Would you like to come and
choose one for yourself?

741
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:30,820
Mary!

742
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,522
Would you like to come

743
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,290
To Mr. Peddie's
with me tomorrow

744
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,892
And choose a kitten?

745
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,895
Jamie Macnab can play
"mackintosh's lament" on the pipes

746
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,098
With only nine mistakes.

747
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,734
Answer me, Mary.

748
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,336
Answer your father,
child.

749
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,272
But he's not very good
at "Loch Lomond. "

750
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,507
This is ridiculous.

751
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,009
If this is her way
of sulking just because...

752
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,544
Don't you want
your supper?

753
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,546
No, I do not.
Now who's sulking?

754
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:59,382
Tell miss Macdhui if she does want a
kitten, she'll have to come and ask me.

755
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:03,286
Everybody was real scared when
they saw the witch, except me.

756
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,754
I wasn't.

757
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:08,458
I just looked at her and said,
"I'm not afraid of you. "

758
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,894
Oh, give me strength.

759
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,596
Oh, you and your stories.

760
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,131
Eat your supper.

761
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,133
Now you've made
your father angry.

762
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,603
No, I Haven't.
My father's dead.

763
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,244
<i>by yon bonny banks</i>

764
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:34,217
<i>and by yon bonny braes</i>

765
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,288
<i>when the Moon...</i>

766
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:43,626
<i>bright on Loch Lomond</i>

767
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,941
Don't cry, child.

768
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:02,245
I Haven't seen you cry
for a long, long time.

769
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,148
Look, Mary, I'm sorry
about Thomasina.

770
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,050
I've told you.

771
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,052
I'll get you another cat,

772
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,955
Or maybe a wee dog
to be all your very own.

773
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,957
Wouldn't you like that?

774
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,461
Now, look, child, I can't
bring Thomasina back to life.

775
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,430
What's done is done!

776
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,235
Oh, very well.

777
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,705
Good night, then.

778
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,246
Oh, granddad,
don't keep on about it so.

779
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,083
That cat's funeral was
nothing but a children's game.

780
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,485
Not to some of us.
I'm tellin' you...

781
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,188
I've said it before
and I'm saying it now -

782
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,458
That Mr. Macdhui
is doing no good here.

783
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,427
Now, don't interrupt me,
woman.

784
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,930
He's a townsman,
not a highlander.

785
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,898
He has no feeling
for animals at all.

786
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,868
Oh, come now, granddad.
Some of the farmers round...

787
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,069
The farmers?

788
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,405
Did you not hear
that he made an order

789
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,408
To destroy the whole herd
of Ian Macclennen's cattle

790
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,011
Because one cow was sick?

791
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:11,147
That's the law. They had
foot-and-mouth disease.

792
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,149
It wasna the law in my day,

793
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,985
And it was only Macdhui's
opinion that they had it.

794
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,321
<i>and look at his record.</i>

795
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,889
Never mind the cattle.

796
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,259
Annie Laggan's old dog Rabbie
- he had him killed.

797
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,461
He saved blind Tammas'
Bruce, though.

798
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,998
Oh, aye, that was because
everybody was there watching.

799
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,200
That was
just showin' off.

800
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,137
Now, granddad,
you shouldn't say that.

801
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,305
Well, the man
that did what he did...

802
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,641
And he wouldna
even take the trouble

803
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,010
To treat his own daughter's
cat when it was sick...

804
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,012
Is no better
than a murderer.

805
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,348
It'd be a good thing
if he went away.

806
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,517
I'd make it too hot
for him here,

807
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,519
I'm telling you,
if I was younger.

808
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,887
So would others.

809
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:54,023
Him and his
newfangled science.

810
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,231
Mary!

811
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,333
Mary Macdhui!

812
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,703
Are you coming out
to play?

813
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,304
Mary!

814
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,707
She won't be comin' out
today. She's in mourning.

815
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,975
And anyway,
we've got work to do.

816
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,211
What work?

817
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,213
Forming
an anti-Macdhui society

818
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,215
To drive him
out of Inveranoch.

819
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,550
Och, listen to him.

820
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,219
My grandpa said he's no
better than a murderer.

821
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,754
Your grandpa?

822
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,322
And he told me Mr. Macdhui

823
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,324
Had two whole herds of cows
slaughtered

824
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,992
Because he thought
one beast was sick.

825
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,296
People are saying he ought to go,
and I think we ought to join them.

826
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,298
And what does blind Tammas
say about him?

827
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,266
Och, he's only one.

828
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,935
Now, here's what we'll do.

829
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,104
Me and you, Geordie...

830
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,572
Morning,
Mrs. Macleod.

831
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,073
Morning.

832
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,176
You're not thinking of taking
your cat to Mr. Macdhui, are you?

833
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,479
Why not? Och, he won't bother with it.

834
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,714
He doesn't care
for anybody's pets.

835
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:52,882
What?

836
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,884
He'll just say,
"can't be cured,"

837
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,886
And then kill it.
Get away wi' you.

838
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,689
It's true. He even did it
to his own daughter's cat.

839
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,492
And Mrs. Laggan's dog.
He killed them.

840
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,394
I did hear about Rabbie,
but he was awful old.

841
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,231
That cat of yours is younger
than Mary's Thomasina.

842
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,999
You take him in there,

843
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,835
And he'll just get his
bottle of chloroform and...

844
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,837
Just a minute, Harry.
Listen.

845
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,607
We were just telling Mrs. Macleod,
Mr. Wallis, about Mr. Macdhui.

846
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,543
You'd be well advised not
to take your dog in there.

847
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,647
I'm thinkin' of
rebuilding my pigsties.

848
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:28,618
You know, I've had two outbreaks
of swine fever up to now.

849
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,187
Have you spoken to this
new vet here... Uh, Macdhui?

850
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,189
Not yet.
Is he any good?

851
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,125
One of Mr. Macclennen's cows
had foot-and-mouth disease,

852
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,928
And Mr. Macdhui
had two whole herds killed.

853
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,233
That young Annie of mine

854
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,969
Took my best black shawl
from my closet yesterday

855
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,739
And tore it into ribbons
in some game.

856
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,609
Aye, I saw them
playing at funerals,

857
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,445
Burying young
Mary Macdhui's cat.

858
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,447
<i>Mr. Macdhui
killed it.</i>

859
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,715
Killed it?

860
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,685
Aye, the same as he did
Mrs. Laggan's dog.

861
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,353
He kills things.

862
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,556
He saved Tammas' Bruce,
laddie.

863
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,192
Aye, because everybody
was there watching.

864
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,927
That was showin' off.

865
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,929
He's an animal murderer.

866
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,364
You tell me he killed
his daughter's cat?

867
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,699
He didn't like it,

868
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,701
So he took his gun
and killed it.

869
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,137
His gun? Well!

870
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,140
Och! Isn't that awful?

871
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,887
Well, now, Andrew.

872
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,222
Glad I saw you.

873
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,224
I wanted a word with you
about Mary.

874
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,226
I did what you said,
asked her to come round

875
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,760
And choose
one of your kittens,

876
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,762
But she'd have none of it,
or me, either.

877
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,764
It's like speaking
with a blank wall.

878
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:51,434
To a child of her age, feeling
is stronger than reason.

879
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,969
You know that, Andrew.

880
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,304
Aye, and grief is usually
forgotten quickly, too,

881
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,307
But the death of this cat,
it's like an obsession with her.

882
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,843
Well, she's something
of a loner child.

883
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,445
Forgive me.

884
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,114
She has no mother, and
she needs someone to love.

885
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,450
She has me.
I'd do anything for her.

886
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,819
No child's ever been
loved so much. Unselfishly?

887
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,221
What do you mean?

888
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,223
Tell me the truth, Andrew.

889
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,859
Were you maybe
a wee bit jealous

890
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,861
Of that cat of hers?

891
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,396
The truth, now.

892
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,398
The animal had to be destroyed.

893
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,067
It would have died anyway.
You can take my word for that.

894
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,104
Angus, would you do me a favor? Do you
think you could have a talk with her?

895
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,172
You might be able
to reason with her.

896
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,441
Well, I can try.

897
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,076
I wish you would.

898
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,078
She's at home now.

899
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,085
You ought to be out playing
in the sunshine

900
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,321
And not moping here indoors.

901
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,990
Geordie Macnab and Hughie
came asking for you.

902
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,326
Why don't you go
and look for them?

903
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,499
Oh, Mr. Peddie,
Mr. Andrew's not in.

904
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,602
I was just passing by,
Mrs. Mackenzie,

905
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,538
And I thought
I'd pay a call on Mary.

906
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,108
Would she be at home,
do you think?

907
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,210
I'm here, Mr. Peddie.

908
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:12,982
Well, now,
there you are.

909
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:16,585
You were so quiet,
I didn't see you.

910
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,654
It's fair warm outdoors.

911
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,656
You're wise
to stay inside.

912
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,761
Would you mind if I sit down
and rest a while?

913
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:26,862
Here?

914
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,865
Ooh, I think the stairs
are a grand place

915
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,168
When you want to have
a good think.

916
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:36,305
You know, I was thinking
just now about your Thomasina.

917
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,974
What with my own cats,

918
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,343
I get all mixed up remembering
what yours was like.

919
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,411
Thomasina, now,
he was about...

920
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,080
She.

921
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,316
Oh, aye, she, yes.
Thomasina.

922
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,952
She was about, what...

923
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,388
So long?

924
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:56,892
And did she not have a wee
square blaze on her chest?

925
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,661
No, it was round.

926
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,663
Round? Aye!
Now you remind me.

927
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,198
It was round, aye.

928
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,201
But she did have three
little white feet, didn't she?

929
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,804
No white feet at all.
No? Oh.

930
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,806
But she had a pink nose

931
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,274
With two black specks
on it.

932
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:13,709
I remember that well.

933
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,277
No specks.

934
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,080
No specks?

935
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,116
Do you remember

936
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,884
How she'd sit and look
at you sometimes

937
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,954
With just the tip
of her tongue showing?

938
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,156
When she was waiting
to be fed.

939
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,759
Yes, when she was waiting
to be fed.

940
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,595
You see, Mary,
Thomasina isn't dead at all,

941
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,263
Not really dead,

942
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,365
Not when we can remember her
together like this,

943
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,934
Because she's alive in our minds. No!

944
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:43,272
And as long as you can remember
her like this, she'll never die.

945
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,540
Just call her to your mind,
and she'll come,

946
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,310
Even if you were to have
another wee cat to love.

947
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,313
You know, I was saying to
your daddy just this morning...

948
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,082
My daddy's dead.

949
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,884
I killed him.

950
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,020
Did you, Mary?

951
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,221
How?

952
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,723
I killed him.

953
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,794
I put him in a box
with flowers in it.

954
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:09,165
We all took him out into
the Glen and had a funeral,

955
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,567
And now I Haven't
anybody at all.

956
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,601
Mary...

957
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,504
No! I like being alone!

958
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,794
Good day to you, Birnie.
I'm here to look at the bull.

959
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,163
I've let him out.
He's in the paddock.

960
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,199
Oh, right. I'll find him.

961
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,201
No need to, Mr. Macdhui.

962
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,203
He'll do very well.

963
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,505
Just tell me how much
your fees are.

964
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,774
What's all this about?

965
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,776
I'll be no more needing
a veterinary.

966
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,778
If there's anything wrong
with my beasts,

967
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,947
I'll take them
to the woman in the Glen.

968
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,616
She's a rare way with them
and charges nothing, I'm told.

969
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,785
Is that where
you're takin' the cow?

970
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,487
Aye, my man is.

971
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,355
What's wrong with her?

972
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,690
She's dried.

973
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,959
You have as much chance of
getting pints of beer as milk

974
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,293
Listening to that rubbish.

975
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,295
I thought you were becoming
enlightened, Birnie.

976
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,732
What I do with my beasts is no
concern of yourself, Mr. Macdhui.

977
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,969
This cow has no disease reportable
under the acts of the county.

978
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,804
Your bull didn't, either.

979
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,407
Aye, I didn't know then
what sort of a vet you were -

980
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,877
Putting beasts to death
whenever it suits you.

981
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,345
What?

982
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:32,681
Aye, my stockman heard it from
his son at school in Inveranoch -

983
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,683
The dogs and cats
you've no use for,

984
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,585
Even your own child's pet.

985
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,854
I see.
So you believe that,

986
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,857
And you're going back to the
witchcraft and the superstition.

987
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,627
You said times change.

988
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:48,731
Well, maybe they're changing
back again, Mr. Macdhui.

989
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,901
The old remedies are as good
as book learning, sir.

990
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,869
Good day to you.

991
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,745
Apart from Mary,
I've another headache now.

992
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,748
The whole village seems to be
boycotting me and spreading tales

993
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,083
About what a heartless
monster I am.

994
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,585
Och, a few children.

995
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,086
It's having its effect.

996
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,088
In a few days,
the people have forgotten

997
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,090
That the blind man's dog
is alive because of me,

998
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:18,060
But they remember the few creatures
that I had to have destroyed.

999
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,563
Be patient with them, Andrew. Patient?

1000
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,897
Tell me something.

1001
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:25,434
What do you know about a
half-witted woman named, uh...

1002
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:33,209
...Named Lori
who pretends to be a witch?

1003
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,212
Well, I rented her
the croft she's living in.

1004
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,914
I know that.
That's why I'm asking you.

1005
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,151
And she's not half-witted, nor
does she pretend to be a witch.

1006
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:45,154
She's been labeled that, just as you
say you've been labeled a monster,

1007
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:48,157
Only she doesn't mind, because
she wants to be left alone.

1008
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,725
Well, she's not succeeding.

1009
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,928
At least two farmers that I'd
won round to scientific treatment

1010
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,930
Are taking their beasts
to her.

1011
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,333
Aye, I hear she has a
remarkable skill with animals.

1012
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,500
What skill?

1013
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,669
Without real knowledge,
you can do great harm.

1014
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,105
Would you take a sick child
to a quack doctor?

1015
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,641
Some people have
natural gifts, Andrew,

1016
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,944
And Lori Macgregor has
the rare quality of mercy.

1017
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,080
Since you know her so well,
perhaps you'd tell her

1018
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,083
To stop undermining the progress that
I'm trying to bring to these people here.

1019
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,585
<i>Why don't you tell her,
Andrew,</i>

1020
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,022
And tell me afterwards
what you make of her.

1021
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,024
Aye. Aye, I Will,
one day,

1022
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,893
And put a stop to her
interference with my work.

1023
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,897
<i>Time passed,</i>

1024
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,067
<i>And I began to see
and feel again.</i>

1025
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,771
<i>I couldn't remember any part
of my first life,</i>

1026
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,341
<i>Although something told me
I'd lived before,</i>

1027
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,011
<i>That I was still me.</i>

1028
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,713
<i>I'd heard that a cat
has nine lives.</i>

1029
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,783
<i>I accepted the fact, so...</i>

1030
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,352
<i>This was my second life,</i>

1031
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,389
<i>My life with a girl
named Lori.</i>

1032
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:04,233
<i>She was gentle and kind,
I'll give her that,</i>

1033
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,669
<i>But she didn't seem
to realize -</i>

1034
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,506
<i>And neither did the other creatures around me
- how important I was.</i>

1035
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,840
There we are.

1036
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,175
All of you -

1037
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:15,344
Dorcas, Mack,

1038
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,379
Molly,

1039
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,215
Whisker - be nice
to Thomasina now.

1040
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,821
<i>"be nice," she said,</i>

1041
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,858
<i>But none of the others paid
any attention to me at all.</i>

1042
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,928
<i>They weren't really
my kind anyway.</i>

1043
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,730
Thomasina, dear,

1044
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,399
Go and walk in the sun
now you're able.

1045
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,835
There are others here
who are not.

1046
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,506
<i>I wasn't important anymore,</i>

1047
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,809
<i>Treated just like
everybody else.</i>

1048
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:53,215
<i>Now I knew
how a king feels in exile.</i>

1049
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,255
Hughie, Jamie, quick!

1050
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,791
<i>what is it?
Come and see quick.</i>

1051
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,430
A badger.

1052
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,933
He's been in the trap
a long time,

1053
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,601
And he's badly hurt.

1054
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,437
What'll we do with him?

1055
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,440
If we try and take the
trap off, he'll only bite.

1056
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:21,110
We could wrap him up
in a sack, trap and all,

1057
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,345
And take him to the village, to the vet.

1058
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,347
To Mr. Macdhui?
We can't do that.

1059
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,349
We're trying
to get rid of him.

1060
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,617
What else, then?

1061
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,286
Couldn't we take the badger
to the witch?

1062
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,621
She's nearer.

1063
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,089
Aye, that's true.

1064
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,092
She couldn't cure a mess
like that with magic.

1065
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,660
I bet she could.

1066
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,896
Mr. Macdhui would
only kill it,

1067
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,599
So let's wrap him up
and take him to the witch.

1068
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,868
Jamie, get the things.
I'll get the sack.

1069
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,616
Careful now.

1070
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,389
You've got him?
Aye, got him.

1071
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,428
<i>Seeing and hearing these boys
gave me that</i>

1072
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,164
<i>"I've been here before"
feeling.</i>

1073
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,232
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1074
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:21,136
<i>I knew them,
and yet I didn't.</i>

1075
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:26,041
<i>They made me feel
uneasy somehow,</i>

1076
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,477
<i>So I kept an eye on them.</i>

1077
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,224
Well, who's gonna
take him to her, then?

1078
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:45,494
You. You're the eldest,
you're always telling us.

1079
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,464
Aye, but -
but it was Geordie's idea.

1080
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,099
He's too big
for Geordie to carry,

1081
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,968
But if you're afraid...

1082
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,503
I'm not afraid of anything.

1083
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,505
Well, go on, then.

1084
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,074
Put him by the tree
and ring that bell.

1085
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:33,542
Oh, poor thing.

1086
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,377
Poor thing.

1087
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,951
Oh, God, please, God,
help me.

1088
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,290
Wait!

1089
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,228
Don't touch it.

1090
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,264
But it's hurt,
from that.

1091
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:02,738
Cursed gin traps.

1092
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,240
Look what it's done to...
Mind yourself.

1093
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,278
Drop it. It'll tear
your throat out.

1094
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,281
It'll not harm me. No creature
harms me. They're not afraid.

1095
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,350
Put it down. You're mad. Aye, so I hear.

1096
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,061
Get away from it.
Let me go. Let me go!

1097
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,730
I'm sorry, but a wounded
badger could half kill you.

1098
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,899
No creature ever harms
me. Don't touch him!

1099
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,301
Leave him to me.

1100
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,835
To you?

1101
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,404
Why, who are you?

1102
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,040
My name is Macdhui. I'm the
veterinary from Inveranoch.

1103
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,341
You are?

1104
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,143
Now I see.

1105
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,312
What do you mean?

1106
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,314
You have the skill
that I Haven't,

1107
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:49,251
The skill that I prayed for
when I found the badger.

1108
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,354
Don't you see? You're meant
to help him, and you must.

1109
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:59,194
It's no use, I tell you.
It's too late.

1110
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,496
Be kinder to put him
out of his pain.

1111
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:04,366
And wonderful
to give him his life.

1112
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,768
You have the skill for it.

1113
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,004
Please, for pity's sake.

1114
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,839
Don't go!

1115
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,976
I've got to get my instruments.
They're in my car.

1116
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,713
God, you sent him.

1117
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,848
Please make him hurry back.

1118
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,557
Well, that's it.

1119
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,592
We'll have to see
how it takes.

1120
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,595
Still, they're hardy creatures
with great vitality.

1121
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,097
He has a chance.

1122
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,432
Bless you and thank you
for giving it the hance.

1123
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:39,768
He'll have to stay quiet
until the wounds heal.

1124
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,004
Have you got a place
where you can keep him?

1125
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,939
Yes.
All right.

1126
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,186
Are all these wild things
in your care?

1127
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,188
Yes, they come here
to me.

1128
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,858
Some instinct or guardian
Angel brings them.

1129
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,861
And what kind of treatment
do you give them?

1130
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:09,364
Food, warmth,
comfort and love.

1131
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,667
And let nature
take its course,

1132
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,402
And that mends them.

1133
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,505
And what about the other
beasts that are brought to you?

1134
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,507
Farmer Birnie's cow,
for instance.

1135
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,742
I know all about that.
What did you do for her?

1136
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:23,879
I sent her back to him with a
message for him to be kinder to her.

1137
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,682
Ha. Like to seen his face.

1138
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,183
And this?

1139
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,186
I found him one morning by
the tree outside in a box.

1140
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,355
He had a broken leg,
but he's better now.

1141
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,857
Well, I can describe
his guardian Angel to you.

1142
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:39,661
He's about six years old, red hair,
and his name is Geordie Macnab.

1143
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,273
Well, keep your eye
on the badger, Miss Macgregor,

1144
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,775
And see that he doesn't
tear off the dressing.

1145
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,277
Aye, I'll watch him.

1146
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,946
You know, um,
in Inveranoch,

1147
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,749
They, uh,
they call you "witch,"

1148
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,919
And if you can get all these creatures
here to live together in peace,

1149
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,487
Perhaps there's
some truth in it.

1150
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,223
The truth is
that they have security

1151
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,225
Because they've no fear.

1152
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,360
Animals are not like people.

1153
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:16,131
They only fight and kill
when they're hungry or afraid,

1154
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:19,534
Not for gain or to prove
how strong they are.

1155
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:22,804
You don't have to be a witch
to understand that.

1156
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:27,342
What made you come here,
Mr. Macdhui?

1157
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,445
Well, I-I thought that, uh...
It's no matter now.

1158
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,447
I must go.
I've work to do.

1159
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,883
Wait. I must pay you
for the work you've done.

1160
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,185
Um, there's no need.

1161
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,788
Will you take this,
then, from me?

1162
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,423
I made it here.

1163
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,425
Then I'm glad to have it.

1164
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,193
Thank you.

1165
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,369
<i>I knew the man...
And yet I didn't know him.</i>

1166
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,606
<i>He reminded me of someone,</i>

1167
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:01,376
<i>Something that was missing
in my present life.</i>

1168
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,712
What do you think
he's done?

1169
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,980
Killed it.

1170
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,015
But the witch
wouldn't let him.

1171
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,718
He wouldn't be likely to help
her with magic, now, would he?

1172
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,420
Suppose we had a look
through the window.

1173
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,992
It's our badger.
We're responsible for him.

1174
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:20,929
Aye. Maybe if
we were careful...

1175
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,403
Come on, Geordie.

1176
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,273
If she catches us,

1177
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,775
You can say you came to see
how your frog was getting on.

1178
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:35,610
You want to know,
don't you?

1179
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,513
Come on, then.

1180
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:52,561
Psst!

1181
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,334
<i>the badger's in here.
I think he's dead.</i>

1182
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,436
I told you Mr. Macdhui
would kill him.

1183
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,438
Here, Geordie,
you're the smallest.

1184
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,407
Climb up
and have a look.

1185
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:17,085
He's not dead.
I can see him breathing.

1186
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,020
<i>are you sure?</i>

1187
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,992
Look out!

1188
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,066
<i>ow!</i>

1189
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,304
Let me go!

1190
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,772
Let me go!

1191
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,407
Och! It's all right.

1192
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,977
What's the matter?

1193
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,812
What are you afraid of?

1194
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,080
Let me go!

1195
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,751
You're the one who
brought the frog to me.

1196
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:53,655
He's better now.
His leg has mended.

1197
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,457
Do you want him back?

1198
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,827
Then come and see him.

1199
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,862
He's not very strong
at hopping yet,

1200
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,797
But he can swim
all right.

1201
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,407
He's going in with her.

1202
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,277
She must have put
a spell on him.

1203
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,319
Here's your wee frog.

1204
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,520
Look.

1205
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,189
Oh, he's better.

1206
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,191
Did you do it with magic?

1207
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,294
With a powerful magic,
Geordie.

1208
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,195
You know my name.

1209
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,697
Cor!

1210
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,667
Was it you who brought
the wounded badger, too?

1211
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,471
Is he going to be
all right, please?

1212
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,507
Did you do magic
with him?

1213
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:49,277
No, that was Mr. Macdhui.
What he did was magic.

1214
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,680
Mr. Macdhui -
does he do magic?

1215
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,416
He has a wonderful skill
that's almost magic.

1216
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,584
He saved the badger's life.

1217
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,286
Can I go now?

1218
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,221
Don't you want
to take your frog?

1219
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,294
Thank you
for curing my frog.

1220
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,130
I'm not afraid anymore.

1221
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,199
Well, not much, that is,

1222
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,168
But I have to go now.

1223
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,513
<i>are you all right?</i>

1224
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,349
Yes. Look,
she cured the frog.

1225
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,851
But what about the
badger? She cured him, too.

1226
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:33,722
She put a spell on Mr. Macdhui
and made him help her.

1227
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,224
She's an awful good witch.

1228
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,870
Hello, Mary.

1229
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,913
Do you know
what I did today?

1230
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,183
Went up to the Glen
to see your witch.

1231
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,753
You know, she's not
a witch at all.

1232
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:10,492
She, uh... Isn't even what Mrs.
Mack calls, uh, "something weird. "

1233
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,527
She's a bit like yourself -

1234
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,529
Wants to be left alone.

1235
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,331
Except that she's, uh,

1236
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,833
She's got all kinds of
creatures up there with her -

1237
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:23,238
Squirrels and rabbits,
stray dogs, cats,

1238
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,174
Uh, wild birds

1239
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,076
And a -

1240
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,278
And a badger.

1241
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,280
If I go up there again,

1242
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:35,083
Would you like to
come with me and see him?

1243
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:42,057
Look, Mary,
I brought you a present.

1244
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,225
<i>look.</i>

1245
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,695
Something
of your very own.

1246
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,480
Och, I couldn't get
nowhere with her.

1247
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:09,551
She shows no signs of wearying of this
game she's playing, that I'm not there.

1248
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,553
<i>And how do you play it,
Andrew?</i>

1249
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,456
Talk to her, behave as if
everything was normal between us,

1250
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,825
Read stories to her,
but she pays no heed.

1251
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,827
And that wee dog
you got for her?

1252
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,830
She'd have none of it.
I had to take it away again.

1253
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,165
No, she won't forgive me,
because I failed her.

1254
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,167
At least, that's the way
she sees it.

1255
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:29,370
I think the trouble lies
deeper than that.

1256
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,173
You were the only human focus
for her love.

1257
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,543
That's why her shock of
disappointment in you was so great.

1258
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:40,448
Andrew, have you ever thought
of getting married again?

1259
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,117
No.

1260
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,519
You need another focus
for your love

1261
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,021
Besides the child,
and Mary needs a mother.

1262
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,724
It's too late for me
to fall in love again.

1263
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:53,795
Oh... So you've seen
Lori Macgregor.

1264
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,165
Aye, I've seen her.

1265
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,334
What do you make of her?

1266
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,735
Don't know.

1267
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,771
She, uh, she has a-a
strange way with her,

1268
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:06,774
A strange skill
that's instinctive.

1269
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:09,978
I don't understand how she
lives out there, cut off, alone,

1270
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,747
And yet doesn't seem
to be alone.

1271
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,782
You should see her
again, Andrew.

1272
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,552
Maybe she could teach you
that rare virtue.

1273
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:20,655
You're in need of it,
my friend, great need of it.

1274
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,592
Good night, angus.

1275
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,338
Hello, Miss Macgregor.

1276
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,340
<i>So he came to see Lori,</i>

1277
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,010
<i>But putting a stop
to what she was doing</i>

1278
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,312
<i>Soon went out of his mind,</i>

1279
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,948
<i>And he kept on
coming to see her.</i>

1280
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:27,589
I've learned a great deal
watching you.

1281
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,591
If only I had
the skill you have.

1282
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,594
But you've a way of taking the
fear out of these wild creatures,

1283
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,129
Making them trust you,
that I wish I had.

1284
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,965
But I'm a witch, remember?

1285
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,466
Aye, you must be.

1286
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,969
You cast some kind
of a spell on them.

1287
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,637
I love them all.

1288
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,139
When they're lost
or strayed or alone in pain,

1289
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,774
That's what they need.

1290
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,210
I feel for them.

1291
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,746
And you, with all
your skill - do you?

1292
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:55,750
I give them what I have,
my knowledge of what to do.

1293
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,818
I do my job.

1294
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,520
Is that all it is to you?

1295
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,956
You must have chosen
to become a veterinary.

1296
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,459
No, my-my father
was one himself.

1297
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,294
He chose it for me,

1298
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,963
And he was a man
that you didn't cross.

1299
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,633
No, all my life,
I wanted to be a doctor,

1300
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:14,335
Dreamed of it
and worked for it.

1301
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:20,708
You must have put a spell on me
to make me tell you that.

1302
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,244
Except for my wife,
I've never told another soul.

1303
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,679
Only she knew.

1304
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,147
"knew"?

1305
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:29,017
Aye, she's dead now,
about five years ago.

1306
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:34,455
You say you believe in
providence and in God's mercy,

1307
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,457
And you wonder
why I don't?

1308
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,959
How can you not?

1309
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,962
I loved my wife.
She did nothing but good.

1310
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,965
She went out nursing the sick
in an epidemic,

1311
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,501
Caught the sickness herself,
and died.

1312
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:49,504
"the Will of God is
inscrutable," they told me.

1313
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,539
"God is love," they told me.

1314
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,541
Which is true.
That's what she believed,

1315
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,377
Yet the God who's supposed
to be love allowed her to die.

1316
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,379
And therefore
you reject him?

1317
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,182
Because your love died,
his love has no truth?

1318
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,051
Is that what you mean?

1319
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:06,621
Ask yourself that
when you've known pain.

1320
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:10,191
I saw both my parents drown,
Andrew, in a storm at sea,

1321
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,527
But my Faith
didn't die with them,

1322
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:15,196
And they wouldn't have
wished it. I know that.

1323
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,538
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1324
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,573
Forgive?

1325
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,942
I'm glad you told me
of yourself

1326
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,211
And I told you.

1327
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,449
Aye.

1328
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,584
I'm glad, too.

1329
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,453
I must go now.

1330
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:41,789
<i>The man's coming back gave me
that feeling once again</i>

1331
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,026
<i>Of there having been
some other time,</i>

1332
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,862
<i>Some other place...</i>

1333
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,698
<i>And one night
it came to a head.</i>

1334
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,534
<i>It was as if something
was pulling me,</i>

1335
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,703
<i>Drawing me on</i>

1336
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:58,639
<i>And on and on.</i>

1337
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,877
<i>I knew the way somehow,</i>

1338
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:06,547
<i>Although I didn't know why
or where I was going.</i>

1339
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:00,435
<i>Thomasina.</i>

1340
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,303
Thomasina!

1341
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,876
Thomasina! Thomasina!

1342
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,411
Come back!

1343
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:15,917
Thomasina!

1344
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:20,822
Thomasina!

1345
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,724
Thomasina!

1346
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:41,909
Thomasina!

1347
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,652
Mary!

1348
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,122
Mary!

1349
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:08,269
<i>Thomasina!</i>

1350
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,639
Thomasina.

1351
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,076
Thomasina.

1352
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,277
No, no!

1353
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:17,778
Let me go! I saw her!

1354
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,515
I saw her! Let me go!

1355
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,517
You were right
to call me.

1356
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,686
She's in bad shock.
Could turn to pneumonia.

1357
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,722
I see signs of it now.

1358
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,824
I've done all I can
for the moment.

1359
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:31,926
I'll be around
first thing in the morning.

1360
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,895
Thank you, Strathsay.

1361
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,563
What should I do?

1362
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,632
Keep taking her temperature
every hour or so.

1363
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,400
It's just
over 100 now.

1364
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:42,069
If it gets any higher,
let me know at once.

1365
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,572
I won't leave her. Show
the doctor out, Mrs. Mack.

1366
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,508
You better get out of those
wet things. You'll catch cold.

1367
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,847
I heard the shouting,
saw the doctor arrive.

1368
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:55,349
Glad you came, angus.
I'm worried sick.

1369
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,351
If she should catch
pneumonia...

1370
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,353
Aye, that's a great battle

1371
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,522
For a wee bairn
to fight alone.

1372
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:03,524
Pray for her, Andrew.

1373
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:06,327
Pray for God's help
and mercy.

1374
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,563
Pray.

1375
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,832
Yes, pray, because if ever
there was a man

1376
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,502
In need of mercy,
it is you.

1377
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,938
You know I'm not a one
for praying,

1378
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,940
For goin' down on my knees.

1379
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,075
Well, pray
on your feet, man.

1380
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,844
It's what's in your heart
and mind that matters,

1381
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,846
Not whether
you kneel or not,

1382
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:28,182
Though that would be good
for your soul.

1383
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,184
It's this stubborn pride
of yours

1384
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:33,688
That has made you live
inside yourself so long.

1385
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:36,057
I've forgotten how to pray.

1386
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,992
I can't do it.

1387
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:40,861
I can't feel
the need for it.

1388
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:43,531
Humble yourself, Andrew.

1389
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,334
Humble yourself.

1390
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,936
If you love the child,

1391
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,905
Pray for her.

1392
01:17:56,738 --> 01:18:00,307
Oh, Thomasina,
where have you been?

1393
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,750
<i>I didn't know.</i>

1394
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:12,586
<i>From the present
back into the past,</i>

1395
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,889
<i>To the present again,</i>

1396
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,024
<i>Where I was safe,</i>

1397
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,193
<i>Protected,</i>

1398
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,128
<i>And loved.</i>

1399
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,178
Where are you boys
going?

1400
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,680
Further up the Glen,
granny. Well, you're not to.

1401
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:42,683
They say in the village
there's a witch up here.

1402
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,685
She'll put
the evil eye on you.

1403
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:50,825
<i>make way!</i>

1404
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,527
<i>yah!
Hah! Hah!</i>

1405
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,959
Right, you devil.
You'll pay for this.

1406
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,927
Come on!

1407
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,263
What's he gonna do
to the horse?

1408
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:32,466
Let's go and see.
Aye.

1409
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,802
Darvas, put the bear
to his paces

1410
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,638
And wake him up.

1411
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:43,043
<i>come on, get out.
Get out. Go on. Go!</i>

1412
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:45,980
<i>all right, get him out.
Get him out!</i>

1413
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,314
Down you come.
Down!

1414
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,183
Come on.
Now this way. Up.

1415
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,185
Up now.
Come on, up and dance.

1416
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:53,320
Come on, up! Up!
Up and dance.

1417
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:56,690
Come on, you blackguard.
Get up and dance now!

1418
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,692
This one's worse
than the other.

1419
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:01,862
The bear can hardly walk,
let alone dance.

1420
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:04,565
What are you doing under there? Get 'em!

1421
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:06,867
Come on, boys, get 'em!

1422
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,677
One gettin' away.
The other one's...

1423
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,713
Got him down.

1424
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:22,483
All right!
Let him go!

1425
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:26,520
Come back here, you.
Get back to work!

1426
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,356
Mr. Macquarrie, sir, there's
some gypsies in the Glen,

1427
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,692
And you've got to do
something about them.

1428
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:34,028
They're beating horses, and
there's half-starved dogs

1429
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,363
And a poor bear with
a sore foot. It's true!

1430
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,365
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1431
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,000
One at a time. Now.

1432
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,903
We were up there watching them.
They're beating their animals.

1433
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,572
Oh, they're awful people, sir.

1434
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,607
You've got to arrest them,
Mr. Macquarrie.

1435
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:49,743
I've already told them to
leave the district and move on.

1436
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,847
I gave them until tomorrow
while they rest their horses.

1437
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,683
<i>rest them? You should
see what they're doing.</i>

1438
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,853
You bring me a complaint from the
proper person, and I'll act on it.

1439
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,855
I don't take orders
from a lot of children.

1440
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,356
What proper person?

1441
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,191
The county officer
concerned

1442
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,361
With cruelty to beasts -
Mr. Macdhui.

1443
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,865
Mr. Macdhui?

1444
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,238
Uh-oh, what's this?

1445
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:20,274
How's Mary, please, sir?
We're sorry that she's sick.

1446
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:22,276
Aye, she's very sick.

1447
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,278
We hope she'll
get better soon.

1448
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,914
We Haven't seen
much of her sin...

1449
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,782
Since the funeral
of Thomasina.

1450
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:31,886
But we really came to see
you about another matter, sir.

1451
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,454
<i>what's that?</i>

1452
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,456
To report
cruelty to animals.

1453
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:37,458
There's some gypsies
up in the Glen

1454
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,959
With performing animals.

1455
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,461
They're awful cruel.

1456
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,463
They've got a bear
with a sore foot,

1457
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:44,064
And they make him dance!

1458
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,567
Constable Macquarrie said that
if you were to examine them

1459
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,503
And report them to him, he
could put a stop to it, sir.

1460
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:52,506
But I thought that my opinion
as an animal doctor

1461
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,275
Was no good.

1462
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:57,578
Somebody called Hughie Stirling
has been saying so.

1463
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,014
Would he be
a friend of yours?

1464
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:04,184
He's no friend of mine, sir.

1465
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:07,021
Hughie Stirling's
a bit of a fool, sir.

1466
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,089
Everybody knows that.

1467
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:14,862
<i>would you do something
about the circus animals?</i>

1468
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,898
Aye, I, uh,
I Will when I can.

1469
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:20,634
Well, uh, run along now,
all of you.

1470
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:26,941
He won't do anything.
He wasn't even listening.

1471
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,142
Yes, he was.

1472
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:29,977
He said he'd go when he can.

1473
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,779
He doesn't care
about those animals.

1474
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,114
Well, we can't do
any more, can we?

1475
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:36,884
Yes, we can. We've got to. Hey, Geordie.

1476
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,219
We could tell the witch
about it - Lori.

1477
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,322
The witch?
Aye, why not?

1478
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,390
You say you're not
afraid of her.

1479
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:46,226
You could tell her.
Me?

1480
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,228
She'd maybe put a spell
on those gypsies,

1481
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:51,365
Turn that big one into a horse
or a bear and learn for himself

1482
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,767
What it's like
to be badly treated.

1483
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,803
I bet she'd do it.

1484
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,638
Go and tell her, Geordie.

1485
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:00,674
Go on. I dare you.

1486
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,365
Why, Geordie,
hello there.

1487
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,335
I came to ask you
something, please.

1488
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,337
Will you come in, then?

1489
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,373
It's better if I do.

1490
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:39,680
I brought you a present
if you'd like it.

1491
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,682
It's because
you cured my frog.

1492
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:45,119
Oh, Geordie, you didn't
have to do that.

1493
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,620
How is your frog?

1494
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,555
Och, he's fine.

1495
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,161
This is my present.

1496
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:56,597
I made it myself.

1497
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:59,199
What a beautiful
pipe rack.

1498
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,001
Thank you, Geordie.

1499
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,736
It's just what I need.

1500
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,838
I thought you might.

1501
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:08,242
I was -
we were wondering

1502
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:10,310
If you'd do something else
with magic.

1503
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:11,478
Another frog?

1504
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,147
Och, no.

1505
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,482
There's a gypsy circus
down in the Glen

1506
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:17,818
With all kinds of animals
and a bear,

1507
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,154
And the people are
awful cruel to them,

1508
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:22,489
Beating them and that,
and they're half starved.

1509
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,391
Have you told the police?

1510
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,126
Aye, and Mr. Macdhui,

1511
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,462
But they won't do
anything about it.

1512
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:30,497
Mr. Macdhui won't?

1513
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:33,133
No, we asked him,
and he said so.

1514
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,636
We thought maybe
you could put some magic

1515
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,638
On the gypsies to stop them.

1516
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:38,972
Would you, please?

1517
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,974
The bear's got
an awful sore foot.

1518
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:44,244
I'll go and see what I can
do, anyway, I promise you that.

1519
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,314
I knew you would.

1520
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:50,451
Oh, thank you.
I have to go now.

1521
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:56,523
She's going to do it!

1522
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:59,693
She's going to put a spell
on the gypsies!

1523
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:06,667
You cannot stay in here
all day and night

1524
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:08,335
Torturing yourself, man.

1525
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:11,105
You've had no rest,
no food.

1526
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,407
Rest? What rest can I have?

1527
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,709
Strathsay says
she's no longer fighting.

1528
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:19,213
It's as if she's lost
the Will to live.

1529
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:20,781
Where is Strathsay?

1530
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,784
He said he'd be back by now.

1531
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,753
He said the fever
must run its course.

1532
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:29,523
There's no crisis yet.

1533
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,359
He's done what he can
for Mary.

1534
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,628
We're all of us
praying for her.

1535
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,029
Praying?

1536
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:38,298
I humbled myself
and prayed, too.

1537
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:41,969
I'd crawl on my hands and knees if
begging for her life would save it.

1538
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,806
She's lost and hurt, angus.

1539
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,375
I can make no contact
with her.

1540
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,785
I wonder...

1541
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,021
Perhaps someone
who has the gift

1542
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,757
For hurt and lost creatures

1543
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,926
Could unlock the child's mind.

1544
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,828
You mean Lori Macgregor?

1545
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:08,862
I do.

1546
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:11,031
Then ask her.
Bring her here.

1547
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:13,700
She's unlocked your mind
enough to make you realize

1548
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,235
You're not sufficient
yourself.

1549
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,204
Stay here
with the child, Angus.

1550
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:34,021
Lori?

1551
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,691
Lori!

1552
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:40,727
<i>So one night
the man came again...</i>

1553
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,135
Lori!

1554
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,145
<i>...But this time
he looked helpless</i>

1555
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:00,614
<i>And lost</i>

1556
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:02,583
<i>And frightened.</i>

1557
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:11,592
<i>music playing)</i>

1558
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,602
Now let's get the bear out.

1559
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,904
We'll have him on next.

1560
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,339
Wait a minute.

1561
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,615
What are you doing
in there?

1562
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,350
She's the witch
the women speak of.

1563
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:13,186
Come on out, you!

1564
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:20,127
If you're in charge here,
you should be ashamed.

1565
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,363
Your dogs are sick,
these horses past work.

1566
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:25,599
The bear is... You're breaking my heart.

1567
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,136
All right, then,
you dance, witch.

1568
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,506
<i>you do
the bear's act for him.</i>

1569
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:35,342
<i>Come on.</i>

1570
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:38,912
<i>it's the witch.</i>

1571
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:41,248
<i>no! Aah!
Let -</i>

1572
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:43,050
Let me go!

1573
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:44,885
Let me go!

1574
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:46,486
Andrew!

1575
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,588
<i>you dance
for the bear.</i>

1576
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:52,859
Look at him!
Look at Mr. Macdhui!

1577
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,195
Who's in charge here?
I am. King Targu.

1578
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:57,731
What right have you
to knock about my people?

1579
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,533
<i>What exactly
were you doing?</i>

1580
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:02,369
Driving out the witch who
set the evil eye upon us.

1581
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:06,540
Evil eye? I've heard about the evil
you do with these wretched beasts.

1582
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,241
What do you want here?

1583
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,911
I have the power to close down
your show for cruelty to animals.

1584
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,612
That's what I'm going to do.

1585
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,715
You'll pay for this.
Get him, and the witch!

1586
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,394
Behind your back,
Mr. Macdhui!

1587
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,932
I'm not standing
for this. Come on!

1588
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:35,469
Get the boys out of here.
Keep clear of this.

1589
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:45,345
<i>ooh.</i>

1590
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:00,460
Form a water chain! Quick!

1591
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:14,474
Lori, get those children
out of here. Quick!

1592
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,843
Macquarrie, take that man in
charge for cruelty to animals.

1593
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:18,779
Here, give a hand here!

1594
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:25,685
Try to hold still.

1595
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:28,789
The bleeding has stopped, but it's
an awful deep cut you have there.

1596
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,524
Lori, Will you listen
to me?

1597
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:33,226
I've told you I'll not till
I finish dressing this wound.

1598
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:36,563
You should have gone down to
Inveranoch with the others,

1599
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:37,798
To a doctor, and not come up here to me.

1600
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,466
Stop! Listen to me, m...

1601
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:43,870
I am listening, Andrew.

1602
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:47,340
I'm a wee bit scared not to
when you're so fierce.

1603
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:50,343
I was afraid of you
down there in the fightin',

1604
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:51,945
<i>And afraid for you.</i>

1605
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,947
I came up here
looking for you,

1606
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:57,117
Just like the other strays
and the lost that come to you.

1607
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,151
Why?

1608
01:30:58,152 --> 01:31:00,153
My daughter is sick
with pneumonia,

1609
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:02,489
And I need your help.

1610
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:04,491
I want you
to come to her with me.

1611
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:07,661
To your house?
Please come.

1612
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,062
Why me?

1613
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:12,399
Well, you have a
- a kind of a magic for the hurt and the sick.

1614
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,502
I've hurt the child so much that
her sickness is the worse for it.

1615
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:18,171
You have? How?

1616
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:21,174
Well, she had a pet that
she loved more than anything.

1617
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:23,009
I had to have it destroyed.

1618
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,679
I didn't realize how much
it meant to the child,

1619
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,681
But in-in doing
what I did, I...

1620
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:29,683
I betrayed her trust in me.

1621
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,618
I killed something in her.

1622
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,620
Lori, you prayed yourself
once, didn't you?

1623
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,622
And you said
that my coming here

1624
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:38,124
Could be the answer to
the prayer. Aye, it was.

1625
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:42,195
Well, I prayed, too, and your coming
with me now could be the answer to that...

1626
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:45,966
For me, for Mary.

1627
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:50,804
Will you come, please?

1628
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:04,150
So... He brought you.

1629
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:07,954
What have you
been doing, man,

1630
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:10,290
To get in that state -
brawling somewhere?

1631
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:12,993
How is she?
The same.

1632
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:15,161
What is this?

1633
01:32:15,162 --> 01:32:16,897
Mary?

1634
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:19,266
Mary Macdhui.

1635
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:23,803
Do you hear me?

1636
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:29,809
Andrew,
may I take her?

1637
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:31,311
Do what you Will.

1638
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:34,247
What does this woman think
she's doing? Let her be.

1639
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:42,589
Andrew, there's
so little of her left.

1640
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:50,430
<i>When the man took Lori away
and they left me alone,</i>

1641
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:51,665
<i>I was frightened.</i>

1642
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:55,068
<i>I had to be with somebody.</i>

1643
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:56,903
<i>The feeling grew stronger</i>

1644
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:59,906
<i>And stronger.</i>

1645
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:03,677
<i>Suddenly, like the lightning
flash that split the tree,</i>

1646
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:05,478
<i>Everything -</i>

1647
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:08,748
<i>My other lost life -
came back to me.</i>

1648
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,985
<i>I knew where I belonged.</i>

1649
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:14,187
<i>I had to go home.</i>

1650
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:16,356
<i>Home.</i>

1651
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:18,258
<i>Home.</i>

1652
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:19,859
<i>Home!</i>

1653
01:33:26,133 --> 01:33:29,836
<i>Thomasina!</i>

1654
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:32,973
Can't be.

1655
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:40,614
It's my Thomasina.

1656
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,949
Yours?

1657
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,085
I found her sick
and nursed her.

1658
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:49,255
Is she hers?

1659
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,424
Is that the pet?

1660
01:33:56,998 --> 01:33:59,566
Thomasina! Thomasina!

1661
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:01,701
Lori, call her!
Make her come in.

1662
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:03,536
No, you must.
She must come to you.

1663
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:05,338
Thomasina.

1664
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,340
Don't you see
that if Thomasina

1665
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:09,342
Is the love
your child has lost,

1666
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:12,078
Only you can give it
back to her.

1667
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,581
Call her. Make her come.

1668
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:26,860
<i>Thomasina.</i>

1669
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:30,296
Come to me.

1670
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:32,098
For the love of God,
come to me.

1671
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:34,567
<i>I knew him now...</i>

1672
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:38,038
<i>Macdhui, my murderer...</i>

1673
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,840
<i>And he needed me.</i>

1674
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:44,077
<i>Without me, he was lost.</i>

1675
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:47,013
<i>So this was my Chance,</i>

1676
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:50,383
<i>The moment of truth
for both of us.</i>

1677
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:53,219
Thomasina.

1678
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:56,056
Come to me.

1679
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:03,797
<i>Yet, because of my
second life with Lori...</i>

1680
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:05,131
Thomasina...

1681
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:07,133
<i>...Because of what
I'd learned from her,</i>

1682
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:09,436
<i>I didn't want revenge.</i>

1683
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:12,572
<i>I wanted to come home.</i>

1684
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,388
Mary.

1685
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:32,358
Mary...

1686
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:34,394
I brought Thomasina
to you.

1687
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:37,430
She's come back
to life again.

1688
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:41,568
No, it's not a ghost,

1689
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,436
Not a dream.

1690
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:47,373
It's Thomasina.

1691
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:48,942
She's come back.

1692
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:51,745
It's Thomasina.

1693
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,747
She's alive again.

1694
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:54,848
Aye.

1695
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,883
She's alive again.

1696
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:00,987
And you're alive again, too.

1697
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:05,024
I'm alive again, too.

1698
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:29,649
<i>So, my third life began,</i>

1699
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:33,553
<i>With all of us together.</i>

1700
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:36,523
Not now.

1701
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:39,559
<i>goodbye!</i>

1702
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:51,971
<i>And, to coin a phrase,</i>

1703
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:55,275
<i>We all lived
happily ever after.</i>

1704
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,275
{{{the end}}}
