Okay for next Sunday?

00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,270
No, Jim. It ain't okay.

- No, you look.

You're liable to get hurt in there.

00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,033
You used to be a big track driver.

Ain't you got no pride?

11
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,705
I ran out of pride when I ran out of cars.

12
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,541
Jim, you gotta look at yourself.

13
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,876
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks,

Okay.

- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.

- So?
- One of these days,

31

you're gonna get wiped out entirely.

33
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,927
Maybe that's not your thing, racing.

34
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,473
How about all those car agencies
down on Van Ness?

35
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,642
I bet that a top mechanic there
gets a lot of good bread laid on him.

36
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,935
What is the matter with everybody?

37
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,645
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic!

I'm a driver!

I know just how you feel, Jim.

40
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,402
Hey, I used to think that I was happy
paintin' flower seeds.

41
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,448
Then one day, inside me,
there was this little voice, says,

42
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,784
"Tennessee Steinmetz."

43
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,160
I said, "What?"

44
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,329
It said, "You ain't happy." Well, I...

45
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:50,663
Tennessee, would you
tell me something?

46
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,291
Why is it the only thing we ever
have in this house is parrot food?

47
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,293
I mean, we don't have a parrot.

48

Hey, eat that. That's good.

49

That's pressed kelp.

That aerates your liver.

continued as follows...

with swamis and monks.

00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,861
It was wonderful.

00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,198
I don't have to go to Tibet.

59
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,367

Jim, it's happening
right under our noses,

386
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:33,827
and we can't see it.

387
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,788
We take machines,
and we stuff them with information,

it is somebody.

I'm not saying that a mechanical thing,
it can't be a friend.

395
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,562
Like, when I was broke one summer,

396
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:05,067
there was this giant claw machine
in the Sutro Amusement Park.

397
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,779
And it would grab cameras and watches,
and drop them down a hole to me.

398
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,572
And I would hawk them and buy lunch.

399
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,823
- You follow me?
- Yeah, yeah.

400
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:15,160
I think you were up on
that mountaintop too long.

401
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:20,624
Contrariwise, the traffic light
down the street hates my guts.

402
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,377
I don't know why,
but in the last six weeks,

403
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,837
I haven't caught anything
but a stop signal.

404
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,466
And it makes me wait six seconds
longer than anybody else. I timed it.

405
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:33,887
There's things like that
happen to lots of other people, too.

406
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,139
But the other people,
they don't tell no other people,

407
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,142
because the other people
would say, "Ahhh..."

409
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,440

in terms of short circuits,

an extra turn of speed,

turn out to be something special.

the car with the driver.

I should welcome the opportunity.

529
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,903
Mr. Thorndyke, I think that's
a very good idea of yours.

530
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,946
What is?

531
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,157
You're racing in the Libra Open
at Riverside the end of the month, right?

Yes.

00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:53,702
I'm sure that Mr. Douglas
would like to get

534
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,704
the remainder of
his payments off his back.

535

No doubt.

536
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,540
But why should I think
that's such a good idea?

537
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:02,377
Well, if Mr. Douglas entered the race,
he could bet his share of the little car

538
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,045
against the remaining payment.

What do you say, Douglas?

540
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,300
Winner to become
the sole owner of the car.

541
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,933
A moment ago you mentioned
teaching me a lesson.

542

I'm not a mechanic,
but I think it's suffering.

877
00:52:18,092 --> 00:52:19,134
Suffering?

878
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,427
Please.

879
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,556
Mind if I use those coveralls?

880
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,766
Right.

881
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:30,646
Oh, uh, look, I want to tell you
so you don't have to worry.

882
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,481
I'm not with Peter Thorndyke anymore.

883
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:34,524
I don't think his way.

884
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,235
Oh, I know that.

885
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,319
How do you know?

886
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,365
Well, Herbie wouldn't like you,
otherwise.

887
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,159
Herbie wouldn't like me?

888
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,328
Miss Bennett...

889
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,497
I gotta level with somebody.

890
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,581
I can't talk to Jim.

891
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,833
Oh, it would destroy him.

892
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,212
You don't know what it was like
before the little car came along.

893
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:57,714
Jim was defeated. It was murder.

894
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,091
He couldn't get a job.

895
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,217
He got into trouble.

896
00:53:00,301 --> 00:53:02,678
Everybody was on his back.

897
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,180
Then Herbie came into his life.

898
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,223
You remember that day?

899
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,725
I remember.

900
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,396
Well, Jim started winning races again,

901
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,190
he got his self-respect back.

902
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,067
What am I gonna do?

903
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:19,945
Tell him that it was Herbie
winning those races, not him?

904
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,865
Uh, was it Herbie?

905
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,410
Well, I...

906
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,620
You fix the little car.

907
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,914
I'll tell you what's going on.

908
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,292
I didn't know nothing.

909
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,502
Then I went to Tibet.

910
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,338
I plugged into this contemplation thing...

912
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,886
How's that sound?

913
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,222
Like the song of a bluebird.

914
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,562
Well, the fuel lines are clean,
plugs are clean, wiring checks out.

915
00:53:53,604 --> 00:53:55,689
Looks like we're in pretty good shape.

916
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,025
Herbie and I sure appreciate it.

917
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:04,531
You don't believe a word I said
about this little car, do you?

918
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:07,993
Well, there's always a first time.

919
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:13,040
I imagine Adam thought woman
was a pretty funny piece of equipment

920
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,750
when he met Eve.

921
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,460
Well, that's a start.

922
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,045
You can't believe it all right away.

923
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:19,755

00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,330
You ever see anything so beautiful?

928
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:54,414
Very nice.

929
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,249
What's the big idea?
You already got a car.

930
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,793
Not after what happened today I don't.

931
00:54:57,835 --> 00:54:59,878
Ah, shut up. You want
Herbie to hear you?

932
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:02,381
Now don't start that again, Tennessee.

933
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,175
Look, the El Dorado is coming up.

934
00:55:05,259 --> 00:55:08,678
There are real cars lined up in there.
I need something that can cut it.

935
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,806
- Herbie's cut it so far, hasn't he?
- Of course he has!

936
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,391
Now, hold it, you two.

937
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,602
I've done great with this little car so far,
thanks to a few changes I made

938
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,480
and, if you don't mind,
some pretty fair country driving.

But I gotta stop kidding myself.

940
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,860
I need a big, strong car.

941
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,529
Now I got it.

942
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,158
Don't pay any attention.
Don't even look at it.

Peter Thorndyke here.

Well, well.

948
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:43,004
Yeah, yeah, Thorndyke,
I know what you did to my car.

949
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,506
You need your brains kicked out.

950
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,633
Well, you can imagine how I must feel.

951
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,261
You see, I'm simply not responsible
when I've been drinking.

952
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,512
You know how it is.

953
00:55:50,596 --> 00:55:51,805
Forget it. And good-bye.

954
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,515
Wait, wait, wait.

955
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,600
I understand from a friend of mine

956
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,019
that you purchased
a new Lamborghini today.

957
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,146
So?

958
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,566
I'm also informed that you owe
a great deal of money on it.

959
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,111
Now, myself, for sentimental reasons,
I like the little car,

960
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:09,364
and I'm perfectly willing
to increase my previous offer

961
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,867
and give you $1,500 for it.

962
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,035
Now, immediately.

963
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,787
I'm in the vicinity.

964
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,956
Thorndyke, I don't like you.

965
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,125
But I can use your money.

966
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:21,877
You got yourself a deal. Come and get it.

967
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,129
What do you mean
you got yourself a deal?

968
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:25,714
- I'm selling the little car.
- You're what?

969
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:28,758
Don't make a fuss. I need the money.

970
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,761
You crumb! You can't do that to Herbie!

971
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,182
Carole, will you tell him how it is?

972
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:37,100

00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:39,853

00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,773
Well, near as I can figure it,
I'm not too smart either.

976
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,280
Well, now, what happened to you?
I thought you'd be on my side.

977
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,741
Not when you do something
like this to Herbie.

978
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,163
Has everybody gone nuts around here?

979
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:00,123
I can understand how Tennessee feels.

980

He's just in off a flying saucer.
But you... I thought you made sense.

981
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:08,632
Something tells me
it's very, very wrong to sell that little car.

982
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:11,218
Well, thank you for your opinion,
but what am I supposed to do?

983
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,677
Now, I need the money.

984
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,845
Tennessee, if I don't sell...

985
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,305
Don't talk to me.

986
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,102
I'm... I'm sorry.

987
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,771
I shouldn't have butted in.

988
00:57:23,272 --> 00:57:24,731
You're absolutely right.

989
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,650
As a matter of fact, I don't know...

990
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,693
What are you doing here?

991
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,071

00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:33,532

994
00:57:35,576 --> 00:57:38,453
If I weren't so young and innocent,
a certain thought might enter my mind.

995
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:41,122
Such as?

996
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:42,874
Such as you went out with me last night

997
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,960
so that Thorndyke could get
a shot at the little car.

998
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,295
Is that what you think?

999
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,922
You gotta admit it's tempting.

1000
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,968
Okay. Okay, you want to know
what I was doing here?

1001
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,136
Well, I felt sorry about
what happened today.

1002
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:58,431
So I quit Thorndyke and came over here
like a full-grown idiot

1003
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,642
to find out if I could make up
for it in some way.

1004
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:02,602
Well, isn't that a beautiful
thought for the day?

Very touching. Makes me glow.

someone told you what the score is.

You see, Tennessee's
too tenderhearted.

1008
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,282
You really think it was you
winning those races?

1009
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,242
Yes, I think it was me winning...

1010
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:19,077
What do you mean
it wasn't me winning...

1011
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:20,245
Pardon me.

1012
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:21,538
All right. Do you want me
to tell you something,

1014
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,333
I admit, I didn't believe it
when Tennessee told me before,

1015
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,586
but now I see it makes all kinds of sense.

1016
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,004
What?

1017
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:30,839
That thimble head of yours
has gotten all swelled up.

1018

out there, Tennessee?

1030
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,541
Of course it's jealous.
It's always been jealous

1031

for winning those races.
