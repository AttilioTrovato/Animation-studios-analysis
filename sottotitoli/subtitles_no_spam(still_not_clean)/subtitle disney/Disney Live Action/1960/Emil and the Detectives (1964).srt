a private detective on the case.

172
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,706
I hope that Emil
has some interesting news.

173
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,614
Something I can use in my column.

174
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:36,485
It's not so easy writing a column for
every single issue of the school paper.

175
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,819
You just run out of things to say.

176
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,756
Then, when you don't
have anything much to say,

177
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:43,556
you have to say it in a different way,
or real funny.

178
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,619
And that isn't too easy either.

179
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,624
Is this the bus from Neustadt?

180
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,828
- What? The bus from where?
- Neustadt.

181
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:53,667
- Berlin Tourist Express...
- Yes, I know the name.

182
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,731
If that's the Berlin Tourist Express,
it's the bus from Neustadt.

183
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:59,710
- There must be some mistake.
- Mistake?

184
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,680
- What mistake?
- Where is my grandson?

185
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,046
I don't know anything about grandsons.

186
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:08,245
- Just buses.
- Well, there you have it.

187
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,616
Call your father.

188
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,748
[girl] Just a second, Nana.
That won't help any.

189
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,657
- The boy is too young.
- What good will it do?

190
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,753
I knew something would happen.

191
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,526
What's happened?
We don't know anything happened.

192
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:25,366
Emil is not on the bus, there's the bus,
and Emil is not on it.

193
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:26,932
I've got a schedule.

194
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:30,635
- There's an 8:00 bus...
- I told Eva he was too young.

195
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,941
- Maybe you read the letter wrong.
- I warned her.

196
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,879
An eight can look like a three,
and your eyes aren't too good.

197
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:39,076
Your eyes wouldn't be so good either
if you were my age.

198
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,813
Look, we can go back to your apartment,
I'll stay for dinner,

199
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,582
and then we'll come back
to meet the 8:00 bus.

200
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,885
- Well...
- It's raining anyway, Nana.

201
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,448
Let's go home, OK?

202
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:50,757
And I can use your typewriter
to do my column. Come on, Nana.

203
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:52,126
Please?

204
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,589
[horn honking]

205
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,752
[horn honking]

206
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,689
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Hey, get out of the way!

207
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,127
[horn honking]

208
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:45,741
[horn honking]

209
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,345
Oh. Master Reinhardt,
where are you going?

210
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,550
- [bike bell ringing]
- Wait.

211
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,157
Bring your suitcase.

212
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,461
Where are we going now?

213
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:08,264
- Headquarters.
- Oh.

214
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,824
- [Gustav] Here, let me carry that.
- Thanks.

215
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,763
- Is this headquarters?
- Of course not.

216
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,626
If headquarters is in this building,

217
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:12,891
- why did we go up and around, and...?
- Secrecy.

218
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:14,726
What?

219
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,064
We prefer to keep
our headquarters a secret.

220
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,125
Shh.

221
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,169
Hi, Gustav. What's up?

222
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,503
Something big. All clear?

223
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,159
Sit down.

224
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,297
All right, let's get started.
Has everyone got their badges?

225
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,770
- Good. Now then...
- Wait a minute.

226
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,101
Where's your badge?

227
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:58,405
I know it was there this morning
when I was dressing.

228
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,378
Hey, this isn't my sweater, it's yours.

229
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:03,972
Well, maybe I'm wearing your sweater,
but this is my badge.

230
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,314
[boy] What are you talking about?
That's where I always pin...

231
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:08,444
All right, fellas. All right, all right!

232
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,490
Don't worry about it. Now this is
our client, Emil Tischbein.

233
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,456
Fresh from Neustadt.

234
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,118
- My name's Hermann.
- Hi.

235
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,992
I'm Hans and this is
my younger brother, Rudolf.

236
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,190
- I'm only ten minutes younger.
- Eleven.

237
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:22,825
I'm Reinhardt Bertram Hohenfeld.

238
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,268
- Nice to meet you.
- We call him the Professor.

239
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:26,861
Because he talks a lot.

240
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:29,498
Because I try to give careful
consideration in matters,

241
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,373
- instead of acting in an impulsive...
- [both] See what I mean?

242
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:35,073
- Dienstag's my name.
- Hi.

243
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,576
- What happened to your leg?
- Fell over a trash can on our last job.

244
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,486
Now, Emil here, is in a tough spot,
and it's up to us to get him out of it.

245
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,319
- He's been robbed.
- [boys] Robbed?!

246
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,824
Four hundred marks!

247
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,019
- Whoa! That's a lot of dough!
- Wow.

248
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,687
[Reinhardt] That's a considerable
sum of money.

249
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:53,891
- Now here's what we do. I'm going...
- [girl laughing]

250
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,299
Come on, tell me something.

251
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:02,101
- I thought you said it was all clear.
- It's only my skrinky sister.

252
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:05,041
Talking on the telephone, as usual.

253
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,442
[girl] I can't even make...

254
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,037
Now look, if this is
gonna be headquarters...

255
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:11,082
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

256
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,880
Anyway, we know the skrunk
that pulled the job.

257
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,081
Great, all we gotta do
is grab the money back.

258
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:18,418
That would make us thieves too.

259
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,722
Look, if somebody takes something
from me and I take it back,

260
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:23,557
- I'm not any thief.
- Yes, you are.

261
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,291
- It's really a moral issue.
- [both] Moral issue?

262
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:28,355
[all arguing indistinctly]

263
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,026
Forget it, Prof.

264
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,264
Sir, I'm not a thief and you know it.
What're you trying to do to me?

265
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,466
- Knock it off.
- What do you...

266
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:39,311
Do you want to hear
about the case or not?

267
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,775
Now, first of all,
we have to find this crook.

268
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:47,979
You know, I wonder at the
advisability of taking this case at all.

269
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,145
This is a serious situation.

270
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,190
We're not gonna
shoot it out with this crook.

271
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:55,352
All we have to do is find him and then
turn him over to the brass buttons.

272
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,521
Yes, but there are extenuating circum...

273
00:26:57,584 --> 00:26:59,655
You don't have to come along,
Professor, you know?

274
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,065
Professor, why don't you
just extenuate your circumstances

275
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,433
long enough to hear
the whole story, huh?

276
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:09,173
Emil, you describe old Sticky Fingers
and Hermann can draw him up for us.

277
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:11,903
- Hermann's very good with a pencil.
- You got any paper, Dienstag?

278
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,376
- Sure.
- Come on, Emil.

279
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:15,380
[Emil] He's pretty hard to describe.

280
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,274
- Where can I put these?
- I'll take them for you.

281
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:27,157
OK, men, take a look at this.
Now, we've already got one clue.

282
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,558
He tried to destroy it,
but I was right on the job.

283
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:32,654
You missed the most important part,
the name of the hotel.

284
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,427
Sure, that's what makes
the case interesting.

285
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:36,797
Now, unless I miss my guess,

286
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:40,634
this means our man's gonna be at some
hotel at 6:00 for some kind of meeting.

287
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:42,435
It's 4:30 right now, so...

288
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,498
I haven't finished my conversation yet,

289
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:48,138
so don't touch the telephone,
or I'll break your arm.

290
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:55,987
When last seen, the crook was
walking near the Memorial Church.

291
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,886
So we'll start
with the hotels in that area.

292
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:00,551
I figured if he was going far,
he'd have hopped a taxi.

293
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,423
- Dienstag, you stand by the phone.
- Right.

294
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:04,689
Professor, make me a list
of the downtown hotels.

295
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,662
Emil will stay here, and if you think...

296
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,233
If you think you've spotted
the crook, call in.

297
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:19,402
- Crook? What crook?
- [Dienstag whistling]

298
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,147
Little boys.

299
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:28,081
- You'll have to do something about her.
- I'll handle it.

300
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,417
Hey, Gustav, I better
call my grandmother...

301
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,790
Send her a note, then you won't have
to tell her any more than you want to.

302
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,294
She won't worry so much.

303
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,729
- Hermann, you take a note for Emil.
- Aw, heck!

304
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:43,530
Every job's important. And don't let
anybody know where it came from.

305
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,730
Professor, you get some rations
together. Sausage, cheese, crackers.

306
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:48,273
Hermann, how's the picture coming?

307
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:51,900
- Good job.
- That's extremely thorough.

308
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,239
He resembles a rodent!

309
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,712
- That's him all right.
- He wears a checkered suit,

310
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,840
with a big silver chain
across the front.

311
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:00,146
- And he wiggles his ears.
- He does?

312
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,619
- Extraordinary.
- Keep that in mind, men. Now, let's go.

313
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,183
[Emil] Just a second, Hermann,
I'm almost done.

314
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,919
Hey, Gustav, wait a second.
Can I be one of the detectives?

315
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:10,393
Of course not, you're the client.

316
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:12,124
OK, men, let's go.

317
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:14,462
- Hans you go with...
- I'm Rudolf.

318
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:16,762
Hans, you go to the Hilton
on Budapester Strasse.

319
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,735
- Rudolf, you go to the Metro.
- Right.

320
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,703
- Professor, you go to the...
- I put the address on the back.

321
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:21,865
Right.

322
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,341
Be careful.

323
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:28,880
- This must be your biggest case yet.
- Right.

324
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,940
- I'm almost glad you got robbed.
- [up-tempo music plays]

325
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:39,456
Sometimes they play records in there
to each other for hours.

326
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,188
I think we'd better
take care of her... right now.

327
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:55,498
[record stops]

328
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,743
Yeah, that's the one. Sure.

329
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,839
Just a minute. What do you want?

330
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:04,143
Heinrich is here.

331
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:07,048
- Heinrich? Where?
- At the front door.

332
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,082
Gunther?

333
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:14,856
It's my mother, I have to run.

334
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,827
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

Heinrich's her new boyfriend.
Gunthe's her old one.

337

They don't know about each other yet.

- Dienstag! You little brat!

339
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,252
Cigarette?

340
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,818
Go ahead, take one.

341
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:50,919
[girl] Come on, Dienstag, please.
Just the telephone, huh?

342
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:54,022
- [continues knocking]
- Nothing to do now but wait.

343
00:30:57,591 --> 00:31:00,572
[girl] Boy, wait till I get
my hands on you!

344

[jiggling door handle]

345
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,043
I'm giving you one more chance,
then I'm gonna do something terrible!

346

Come on, Dienstag,

I'm looking for Frau Heimbold.

370
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,986
- What do you want with her?
- I've got a message.

371
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,600
What sort of a message?

372
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,838
It's a personal message.

373
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,711
- Is this Number 15 Rosenheimer Strasse?
- You came to the right mail chute,

374

but Frau Heimbold happens to be
busy right now. Who's it from?

375
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,912
It's from... It's important.

376
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:05,320
Oh, well I'm her granddaughter,
I can take the message for her.

377
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:08,387
- Do you want me to scream?
- Stop saying that.

378
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,254
Why can't I give a message
to my own grandmother?

379
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,693
Because... because I don't think
my friend would like it.

380
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:20,171
And just why is your friend sending
mysterious messages to my grandmother?

381
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:23,265
- Your grandmother?
- Yes, my grandmother.

382
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,833
She could be somebody else's
grandmother, too.

383
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,176
- So he is in Berlin!
- No! I mean... Who?

384
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,182
- [chuckles]
- Emil.

385

I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean?

386
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:35,476
And he is in
some kind of trouble, isn't he?

387
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:38,955
- I didn't say anything about Emil.
- Who are you anyway?

388
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:42,789
Why did he send you with a note?
Why didn't he come himself?

389

Be... Because he can't.

390
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:48,298
You've kidnapped him!
That's a ransom note!

- Poor Emil!

00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:00,406
- He has to see a man about some money.
- Money?

396
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:05,282
Never mind, just give this note
to Frau Heimbold. I've gotta go!

00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,736
- Right.
- Who is it? Did they find him?

413
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,839
Check. Right.

414
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:26,680
- What happened?
- Gustav, Hotel Kreid.

415
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,185
- He wants you to come over.
- Right.

It's on Enge Strasse.
Turn right outside for about a block.

you're going? Oh, it's you.

I delivered your message.
Anything happen?

00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:20,599
Hotel Kreid. Gustav's waiting.

Climb on.

00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:05,374
- That's him all right.
- Shall we call the police?

430
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:07,316
- Not yet.
- [both] But I thought you said...

431
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:11,186
I think we're onto something big.
Something bigger than just 400 marks.

432
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,387
Thank you.

433
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,522
It's a great honor
to be working with the Baron.

00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,588
I never thought I'd have the chance.

435

How long will the job take?

436
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:25,393
It's hard to say.

437
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,769
What do you mean "hard to say"?

438
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,001
Muller, please, Muller.

439
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:33,204
Have a little respect for
Herr Grundeis' professional integrity.

440
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:35,941
I presume there are many variables?

441
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,914
Soil conditions, shoring problems?

442
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:39,973
Especially under that street.

443
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:41,910
It takes study.

444
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:45,723
What do you propose?

445
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:26,128
The average weight of vehicles
passing over that street?

446
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,198
- The average weight?
- Trucks, busses,

447
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:32,863
- American cars, and street cars.
- There are some street cars

448
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:35,770
and a few trucks from the furniture
warehouse on the next corner.

449
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,173
Actually, it's a very
short distance if we start here,

450
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:40,234
where I have it marked, at the old ruin.

451
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,008
There's the basement,
and this underground passage

452
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,243
- takes us within 20 yards.
- [August] Yes, but...

453
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:48,286
I understand your tunnel under
the Wall was over 100 yards.

454
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,721
- One hundred and three.
- How long did it take you?

455
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:55,988
- Forty-three days.
- Forty-three days?!

456
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,326
What did you use, a teaspoon?!

457
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:01,966
No, a soup spoon, about so big.

458
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:05,194
A beautiful piece of work.

459
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,398
- Thank you.
- What about this job?

460
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:09,600
We've got only two days.

461
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:13,475
The holiday, you know. We don't
want to pop into that bank vault

462
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,014
on the day the place is open
for business, do we?

463
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,811
You can get started right now.

464
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:21,710
You must forgive Muller,
he's very impatient.

465
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:24,312
But, you see,
there is this time pressure.

466
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:26,324
Muller, cigar.

467
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:32,289
Please.

468
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:35,995
If you could see your way clear
to start tonight.

469
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,229
- Well, uh...
- Ah, there's a good fellow.

470
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,999
Muller, light.

471
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,870
I believe you'll find everything
you need is already there.

472
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,103
Just awaiting your master touch.

473

What're you doing up here?

475
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:10,998
- There's your man.
- Where?

476
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:12,230
Right...

477
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,702
- He was there.
- Look!

478
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:18,368
- Where?
- Right here.

479
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:20,241
- What?
- My badge!

480
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:22,976
- It was in my pocket the...
- There he is!

481
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:27,083
Let's go.

482
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:50,841
[whispering] Stay back and stay quiet.
We don't want him to make a run for it.

483
00:44:06,547 --> 00:44:08,686
- [bike bell sounds]
- [Reinhardt] Gustav! Emil!

484
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:13,931
- Headquarters told me where you were.
- Got the rations?

485
00:44:13,988 --> 00:44:15,899
- [Rudolf] I'll take them.
- [Hans] You'll eat 'em.

486
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:17,697
- [Rudolf] No, I won't.
- Shh!

487
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,548
- [Rudolf hiccups]
- Shh!

488
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:13,854
- Quiet.
- I can't help it, I swallowed my gum.

491
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:43,448
Wow, look at that place.

492
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,579
- [Emil] Where's he going?
- [Gustav] I don't know.

493
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:20,785
- What's he doing in this place?
- Highly irregular.

494
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:23,021
You bet your skrunky buttons it is.

495
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,994
I knew we were on to something big.

496
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:26,793
- I just want my money.
- [hiccups]

497
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:28,162
All right.

498
00:46:29,056 --> 00:46:31,093
- Now here's what we do...
- Look!

499
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:40,439
Emil Tischbein, what are you up to?

500
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:41,946
Pony!

501
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:44,949
- How'd you find me?
- I followed your messenger.

502
00:46:45,706 --> 00:46:48,619
Good job.
Who is she, Emil?

503
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:52,818
Oh, Gustav Fleischmann,
may I present my cousin,

504
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,827
- Brunhilde Heimbold.
- Hi. My friends call me Pony.

505
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:56,987
Get rid of her.

506
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,933
- Pony, what'd Nana say about the note?
- Nothing, she never saw it.

507
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,493
[Emil] Wasn't she worried
when I wasn't on the bus?

508
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:07,766
I told her she probably
read the letter wrong.

509
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:10,206
And you'll be coming in on the 8:00 bus.

510
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:14,639
- What's going on around here?
- It's got nothing to do with you.

511
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,079
If there's a good story in it, it does.

512
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:18,582
Writing a book?

513
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,918
- No, I'm a reporter.
- A reporter?!

514
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:25,817
- Emil, I'm telling ya...
- Look, Pony,

515
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:29,190
you go on back to Nana's and I'll be
there and explain everything then.

516
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:30,853
Not on your life.

517
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:32,929
Do you want me to get rid of her?

518
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:37,162
Just try it and I'll go straight to Nana
and tell her all about the money.

519
00:47:40,427 --> 00:47:41,701
[mouthing silently]

520
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:47,871
She's your problem, Emil.
Come on, men.

521
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:50,973
All right, Pony, but you have to promise
you won't get in the way.

522
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:56,613
Excuse me for saying so,
but I don't have to promise anything.

523
00:47:57,745 --> 00:47:59,349
[Gustav] All right, men,
listen carefully.

524
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:02,394
Hermann, you take
the corner on the back.

525
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,395
Hans, you take the corner
on the other side.

526
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:06,863
Rudolf, you take the front corner,
I'll be at the front door.

527
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,491
Stay in sight of each other
and keep quiet.

528
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,861
But if the crook runs for it, yell your
heads off. Professor, get the police.

529
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,029
Good luck.

530
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,739
[Emil] You'd better go home before
Nana starts worrying about you, too.

531
00:48:21,802 --> 00:48:23,839
And give up a chance
to interview the criminal?

532
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:26,077
- [chuckles] No, thanks.
- Hey, wait a minute.

533
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,347
- You can't stick around here.
- Remind him

534
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,447
I could ruin the
whole thing if I wanted to.

535
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:39,029
Well, she is my cousin,
and I am the client.

536
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,622
All right, all right.

537
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:42,691
Just keep her out of sight.

538
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:14,689
[hiccups]

539
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:29,645
- [Rudolf hiccups]
- [Hans] Shh!

540
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:33,579
[Rudolf hiccups] I can't help it.

541
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,881
- [Hans] Gustav.
- [Hermann] Keep him quiet!

542
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:38,446
- [Rudolf] I'm trying.
- [Gustav] Cut that out.

543
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:40,856
Stop that noise.

544
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:44,057
[bell tolling]

545
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:47,424
It's that partially
demolished building over there.

546
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:58,907
- You've got proof of all this?
- Incontrovertible.

547
00:49:58,966 --> 00:50:01,003
- What?
- Foolproof proof.

548
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:04,811
- Is he still in there?
- Sure. I've got the place surrounded.

549
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,251
Which one had his money stolen?

550
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:12,655
[Emil] Me, sir.

551
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,870
- [man] What would he be doing here?
- That's what we'd like to know.

552
00:50:35,936 --> 00:50:38,917
It's very peculiar, very suspicious.

553
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:55,390
[water running]

554
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:10,410
There's lots of places he could hide...

555
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:20,890
- ...if he wanted to.
- Where did you come from?

556
00:51:20,948 --> 00:51:23,394
Number one guard
between Hans and Gustav.

557
00:51:41,668 --> 00:51:42,669
All right.

558
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:49,220
It's a holiday,
and on holidays boys play games.

559
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:51,313
- I know that.
- That's not fair.

560
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:54,655
Just because you can't find a crook,
that doesn't mean there isn't one.

561
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:58,922
Every holiday it's the same thing.

562
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:02,092
Let's pull a prank on Officer Stucke.

563
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:06,400
It's easy to trick Officer Stucke
if you've only got the nerve.

564
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,135
[imitating child's voice] "I dare you.
I double dare you."

565
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:17,747
Now I tell you something.
Officer Stucke's

566
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:20,342
- up to here with pranks.
- Yes, sir.

567
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:28,192
Now I think you'd better
all go home to bed.

568
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:33,122
It's late... and these
old ruins are dangerous.

569
00:52:41,095 --> 00:52:44,406
Next time I won't be so patient.

570
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,620
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

571
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:00,214
Glad we don't eat early at my house.

572
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:04,554
Having veal stew tonight, that's one
of the best things my mother makes.

573
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,229
[Reinhardt] I really should be going.

574
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:13,328
The butler will undoubtedly be waiting
up for me to finish our chess game.

575
00:53:13,394 --> 00:53:16,466
[Pony] We'd better go too, if we're
gonna be at the bus terminal by 8:00.

576
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,307
No, I can't go. What would I say?

577
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:24,509
Hello, Nana. I'm sorry, but I lost
the 400 marks I was bringing ya.

578
00:53:24,572 --> 00:53:26,609
You'll have to get along without it.

579
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:28,449
But you didn't lose it, you got robbed.

580
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:30,011
What difference does that make?

581
00:53:30,077 --> 00:53:32,079
Nobody can blame you for getting robbed.

582
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,921
So what? I still don't have the money,

583
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:36,325
and I'm not gonna meet Nana
till I get it back!

584
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,728
- But, Emil, it won't work out.
- All right, I'll stay here with Emil.

585
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:43,496
The rest of you men can go home now,
but be back in the morning, 8:00 sharp.

586
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:46,663
You mean you're gonna
stay here all night?

587
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:48,400
How else are we gonna find this crook?

588
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,874
What makes you so certain
he'll turn up here again?

589
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:54,037
Because a criminal always returns
to the scene of the crime.

590
00:53:54,101 --> 00:53:56,240
- Right.
- But that's fallacious reasoning.

591
00:53:56,303 --> 00:54:00,217
- The crime wasn't committed here...
- Look, have you got any better ideas?

592
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:03,483
If he doesn't show up
then we've lost him, that's all.

593
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:06,320
[Pony] Well, I don't know.
If you ask me...

594
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,155
Nobody's asking you,
but since you've butted in,

595
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:10,456
- you'll take care of Emil's family.
- What?

596
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:11,587
First, go to your old man,

597
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:14,098
tell him it was your grandmother
that got a call from Neustadt.

598
00:54:14,154 --> 00:54:16,430
- And Emil's not coming till tomorrow.
- Why not?

599
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,461
He got sick or the bus was full, can't
you think up anything for yourself?!

600
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:22,439
- I can think of something...
- Then go to your grandmother,

601
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:25,500
tell her it was your old man
that got the call.

602
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:28,274
- Women.
- If this plan doesn't work...

603
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:31,714
Never mind about that.
We're not giving up this case.

604
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:34,583
Now we have to do what we have to do.

605
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:35,813
Now move out.

606
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:38,988
- Good luck, Emil.
- Good luck, Gustav.

607
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:40,582
- See ya, Emil.
- Eight o'clock.

608
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:43,287
- Bye, Gustav. Good luck.
- Bye, Gustav.

609
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:47,556
Gustav, if you could
give me your address,

610
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,259
I could stop by and tell your father.

611
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:52,998
[Gustav] It's payday,
he won't be home till late.

612
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,971
Besides, he doesn't care what I do.

613
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:57,536
Well, good night.

614
00:55:04,038 --> 00:55:06,644
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

615
00:55:08,108 --> 00:55:09,917
Nothing at all.

616
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:13,116
- Good luck, Emil.
- [Emil] Thanks.

617
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,956
[Emil] Gustav?

618
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:22,927
Gustav, I'm glad you didn't
want to give up the case.

619
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:27,864
I mean... thanks.

620
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:31,668
- [thundering]
- Ten marks'll be enough thanks for me.

621
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,748
Come on, we'll take turns on guard.

622
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:46,620
[thundering loudly]

623
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:57,934
[rain falling]

624
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,877
Looks like we're in for a rough night.

625
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,320
[birds chirping]

626
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,626
[car backfiring]

627
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,340
[backfiring continues]

628
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:53,584
[car door closes]

629
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:03,831
Thank you.

630
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,704
[whispering] Lay low.

631
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,034
I've seen those two before.

632
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:13,544
Of course you have, in the hotel room.

633
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:16,241
Take it easy.

634
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:19,409
I'd forgotten how fresh the air is
so early in the morning.

635
00:57:19,473 --> 00:57:22,420
- And how quiet.
- The little rat is probably asleep.

636
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:25,082
It's a splendid time
for our sort of business.

637
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:27,091
Everyone is inside his house,

638
00:57:27,147 --> 00:57:29,457
no meddling questions, no prying eyes.

639
00:57:31,652 --> 00:57:34,326
Crimes are only committed at night,
by tradition.

640
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:36,459
We ought to shake off the old ideas.

641
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:38,833
Hurry up, before they get away.

642
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:40,668
You go on, I'll go around back.

643
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,467
Ah!

644
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,335
What are you doing?

645
00:58:46,393 --> 00:58:49,670
Taking my morning exercise,
what do you think? Get going.

646
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,897
[water running]

647
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:27,895
[muffled, indistinct voices]

648
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:47,153
[Muller] If he's supposed to be so good
what's taking him so long?

649
01:00:47,214 --> 01:00:49,888
[voices continue, indistinct]

650
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:54,864
[Muller] What's he been
doing all night, anyway?

651
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:59,434
He's probably just sitting down
laughing at us.

652
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:04,071
I don't see why we can't
just walk in the bank,

653
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:08,511
stick a gun in their faces and
take the money, like we always do.

654
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:11,607
[Baron] Muller, if you don't stop
grumbling, I make you wait in the car.

655
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,576
This caviar's superb.

656
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:16,213
[speaks French]

657
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:18,715
Lemon wedge, please.

658
01:01:27,388 --> 01:01:29,197
Thank you.

659
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:36,570
The wine, Muller, the wine.

660
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,043
The taste of caviar should never be
allowed to linger for very long.

661
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,101
It goes stale.

662
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:49,215
- What vintage is this?
- Fifty-nine, like you said.

663
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:52,220
- It's gone sour.
- [gasping]

664
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:54,850
- It's the stuff.
- [Baron] The what?

665
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:57,589
The powder, the nitro powder.

666
01:01:57,651 --> 01:01:59,824
- Don't shake it.
- Do be more careful, Muller.

667
01:02:00,654 --> 01:02:01,826
[gasps]

668
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:12,407
The wine, the wine.

669
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:19,607
Delightful bouquet.

670
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:23,045
[Gustav's horn honks]

671
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,851
[horn continues honking]

672
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:35,593
- Did you hear something?
- An automobile horn from the street.

673
01:02:35,656 --> 01:02:37,465
Have we heard street noises before?

674
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:41,370
Well, I don't think there's any cars
going through this building.

675
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,409
- [chuckles]
- Very amusing.

676
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:46,734
Huh.

677
01:02:49,002 --> 01:02:51,278
Emil!

678
01:02:52,673 --> 01:02:54,118
I heard a voice, too.

679
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,520
Cover my caviar.

680
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:35,054
Well, did you find something?

681
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,124
Not yet.

682
01:03:50,764 --> 01:03:52,573
We're just wasting time.

683
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,507
I'm going back and see
what's taking Grundeis so long.

684
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,447
Always impatient, aren't you, Muller?

685
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,814
Your impatience will put you
back in prison if you're not careful.

686
01:04:02,877 --> 01:04:03,912
[sneezes]

687
01:04:10,284 --> 01:04:11,922
Emil!

688
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:14,996
Emil!

689
01:04:16,557 --> 01:04:19,731
[Rudolf and Hans]
Emil! Emil, where are you?!

690
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:26,110
I bet Gustav's just trying
to get himself some breakfast.

691
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,770
[Reinhardt] Then where's Emil?

692
01:04:27,835 --> 01:04:30,782
- I don't know.
- Hey! There he is, up there!

693
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:34,479
- [boys shouting at once]
- [Reinhardt] What did you say?!

694
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:37,021
I don't know where he is.

695
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:44,121
- [Reinhardt] You don't know?!
- That's what I said.

696
01:05:01,068 --> 01:05:04,982
We split up to search this place,
and I haven't seen him since.

697
01:05:05,773 --> 01:05:08,583
Those two characters from the hotel
showed up and disappeared.

698
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:11,754
Then Emil disappeared.

699
01:05:12,613 --> 01:05:14,456
And that's the whole story.

700
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:17,217
Fine bunch of detectives.

701
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:19,890
We don't only lose our man,
we lose our client.

702
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:36,877
I don't wanna play anymore.

703
01:05:37,704 --> 01:05:39,012
Yes, Muller.

704
01:05:42,176 --> 01:05:44,122
This whole thing is beginning
to make me nervous.

705
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:47,318
- [Baron] I can see that, Muller.
- What are we gonna do about him?!

706
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:49,452
[Baron] You needn't
concern yourself with that.

707
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:52,554
I'm taking full responsibility
for our young guest.

708
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:55,032
I didn't mean any harm.

709
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:58,901
- I was just doing some exploring.
- A victim of circumstance.

710
01:05:59,393 --> 01:06:00,929
Alas, so are all of us...

711
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,471
...victims of circumstance.

712
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:08,343
Well, it won't do us any good
to sit around, shaking our heads

713
01:06:08,402 --> 01:06:11,212
- like a bunch of skrinky old women.
- [bike bell rings]

714
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,115
This is all I need.

715
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:20,284
Good morning.
What happened last night?

716
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:22,953
I thought about you two
when it started to rain last night.

717
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:26,589
And your story worked perfectly
on the family. Where's Emil?

718
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:34,769
We don't know where he is,
we've lost him.

719
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:39,709
- Lost him? Is this a joke?
- Do you see anybody laughing?

720
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:46,141
Four persons have disappeared in
this building within the last 14 hours.

721
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:52,548
All right, let's get moving.
Rudolf and Hans, spread out

722
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:56,459
and go through this junk pile from
front to back. Look under every brick.

723
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:57,928
[Rudolf] OK.

724
01:06:58,552 --> 01:07:01,965
- Hermann and Professor, come with me.
- I'm going to the police.

725
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:05,367
They won't listen, haven't you
got that through your big brain yet?

726
01:07:05,426 --> 01:07:07,201
There's no alternative.

727
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:12,410
All right. Go ahead, I'm tired
of arguing. You do what you want to.

728
01:07:12,466 --> 01:07:15,072
You two get moving.
Hermann, you come with me.

729
01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:18,014
You're still playing detective?

730
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:20,574
Emil might be hurt,
or in some kind of danger.

731
01:07:21,308 --> 01:07:23,618
And you're still pretending
like you're on television

732
01:07:23,677 --> 01:07:26,180
- or in the movies or something?
- Who asked your opinion?

733
01:07:26,246 --> 01:07:30,285
You never ask for anybody's opinion,
because you think you're so smart.

734
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,888
But this is one time
you aren't so smart at all!

735
01:07:32,953 --> 01:07:35,593
Come on, Professor,
the police will listen to my father.

736
01:07:35,656 --> 01:07:38,899
Great, just great.
You know, that's just what Emil wants.

737
01:07:38,959 --> 01:07:40,734
That's why he hired us
in the first place.

738
01:07:40,794 --> 01:07:43,502
So we'd run and squeal to his family
about the money he lost.

739
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:47,011
I don't know what Emil wants,
and neither do you.

740
01:07:47,468 --> 01:07:48,913
Not anymore.

741
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:53,645
Fine, go ahead. And good luck, you'll
need it. Since you're more to blame

742
01:07:53,707 --> 01:07:55,744
- than anybody else.
- What?

743
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:57,584
If you hadn't told that big lie
to your family,

744
01:07:57,644 --> 01:07:59,715
Emil wouldn't have
been here today to get lost.

745
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,192
- It was your lie.
- I didn't tell it.

746
01:08:02,716 --> 01:08:05,287
But I... I was only trying to help.

747
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:07,559
Well, I guess you can
explain that to your old man.

748
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:09,525
Don't let him scare you.

749
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,093
How would you like a fist
right in your big mouth?!

750
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,264
That would prove one thing for sure.

751
01:08:14,328 --> 01:08:17,468
That you know you're wrong,
and can't think what to do about it.

752
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:26,977
It won't be easy to go to the police
and tell them what we've been doing,

753
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,317
and how we've lost Emil.

754
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:31,515
But what if we don't go?

755
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,756
What if tonight comes and
we still don't know where Emil is?

756
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:38,422
Do we still keep it to ourselves?

757
01:08:39,086 --> 01:08:41,566
Sooner or later we'll have to tell.

758
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:43,932
And what will people
think about us then?

759
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:47,798
And, in the meantime,
what's happening to Emil?

760
01:08:50,064 --> 01:08:52,738
I don't want things
to get any worse than they are.

761
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:55,514
I'm going to the police right now.

762
01:08:55,569 --> 01:08:59,449
And the rest of you
can come along if you want to.

763
01:08:59,506 --> 01:09:03,545
Or stay here.
It doesn't make any difference.

764
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:47,688
When are you going
to be through down there?!

765
01:09:47,755 --> 01:09:49,496
In 43 days?!

766
01:09:49,556 --> 01:09:52,594
Yell just a little louder, Muller,
and they'll be able to hear

767
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,606
- at police headquarters.
- [growls]

768
01:09:58,365 --> 01:09:59,639
Did you say something?

769
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,910
So there you are!
Where's my 400 marks?!

770
01:10:06,107 --> 01:10:07,279
Grundeis?

771
01:10:10,945 --> 01:10:12,822
What's the boy talking about?

772
01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:16,523
On the bus from Neustadt
he picked my pocket!

773
01:10:18,419 --> 01:10:21,923
You risked a million mark project
for pocket change?

774
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,301
There was a time, a much happier time,

775
01:10:30,364 --> 01:10:33,208
when I didn't have to
associate with pickpockets.

776
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:37,681
I told you we were making a big mistake.

777
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:38,842
Or hoodlums.

778
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:46,685
Stupid little sneak, thief! [groaning]

779
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:50,058
- You... you. I break you in two!
- Muller!

780
01:10:50,117 --> 01:10:52,256
- [Muller] Come back, you little rat!
- Pull him out! Let me at him!

781
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,196
I'll teach you to mess up
a big job like this.

782
01:10:54,255 --> 01:10:57,395
- Muller! Control yourself, I mean it.
- [grunts]

783
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,267
Just leave things to me, please.

784
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:01,306
What's he doing down there anyway?

785
01:11:01,362 --> 01:11:05,708
Little boy...
you should never have come here.

786
01:11:07,835 --> 01:11:11,578
In case anybody's interested,
I've reached the vault.

787
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:13,312
Why didn't you say so, you idiot?

788
01:11:13,374 --> 01:11:15,581
[August] You didn't give me a chance.

789
01:11:16,243 --> 01:11:18,189
- Let's go.
- What about the boy?

790
01:11:18,245 --> 01:11:19,656
[Baron] You bring the boy.

791
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,286
Come on.

792
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:29,691
[both grunting]

793
01:11:33,494 --> 01:11:36,304
- [Muller] Why you... I...
- [Baron] Muller.

794
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:40,574
Take my ankles.

795
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,573
Easy now. Pull.

796
01:11:45,306 --> 01:11:46,649
[grunts]

797
01:11:46,707 --> 01:11:48,380
Ooh! You're pulling my legs off.

798
01:11:48,442 --> 01:11:50,786
[all straining]

799
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:54,954
[Baron grunts]

800
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:57,856
[snarling]

801
01:11:59,019 --> 01:12:03,297
I'm reminded of a summer
in Monte Carlo, '37, I believe.

802
01:12:03,357 --> 01:12:04,358
Help me up.

803
01:12:05,559 --> 01:12:08,438
- [grunting]
- There was a Countess,

804
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:12,466
I can't recall her name right now,
but she was very important that year.

805
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:14,240
Grundeis, flashlight.

806
01:12:14,301 --> 01:12:16,372
She had splendid entertainment.

807
01:12:16,437 --> 01:12:21,284
I will never forget a costume ball
she gave in the cellars of her villa.

808
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:26,091
That's my boy. Get in there.

809
01:12:32,353 --> 01:12:35,197
Everyone was asked to dress
as a famous criminal.

810
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:38,702
I went as Leon Duval, the jewel thief.

811
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:42,570
My pockets stuffed to overflowing
with imitation jewelry.

812
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,507
Simple, but imaginative.

813
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,676
Everyone thought it a charming idea.

814
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:51,615
It was the height of the Riviera season.

815
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:53,879
Servants were hard to come by.

816
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:57,320
Three of my men were
on the Countess' staff that night.

817
01:12:58,612 --> 01:13:03,322
Before the evening was over, my pockets
were stuffed with very real jewels.

818
01:13:03,384 --> 01:13:06,957
The imitations had been given
in exchange.

819
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:11,870
was a night to remember.

820
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,570
[Muller grunting]
Him and his charming ideas!

821
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:21,338
I'll give him a few charming ideas.

822
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,582
[grunts, screams]

823
01:13:46,393 --> 01:13:50,535
[Baron] You know, the one party
paid my way that entire season.

824
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:53,737
And the way I lived in those days,
that's saying something.

825
01:13:54,668 --> 01:13:56,944
One day, I'm going to write my memoirs.

826
01:13:59,206 --> 01:14:01,812
All right, Muller, hurry up. Hurry up.

827
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:05,255
[Muller] I'm coming as fast as I can.

828
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:21,299
[screams]

829
01:14:21,896 --> 01:14:23,398
- Hey!
- Look out, Muller.

830
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,738
Yes, it's been a beautiful life.

831
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:33,650
Muller, light, please.

832
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:38,850
Light your own cigar
if it's such a beautiful life!

833
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:40,688
You know I never carry matches.

834
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:42,819
[grumbles]

835
01:14:49,023 --> 01:14:51,128
Emil! [echoes]

836
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:58,642
- Who's missing?
- Emil Tischbein.

837
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:01,339
- Our client.
- Your client.

838
01:15:01,402 --> 01:15:04,645
- [all talking at once]
- We're not getting anywhere this way.

839
01:15:04,705 --> 01:15:06,685
Let one person tell it. Now...

840
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,981
Well, well, so it's our
group of detectives.

841
01:15:09,043 --> 01:15:10,545
[man] Do you know these boys, Stucke?

842
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:14,582
Oh, yes, last night they had me busy
searching in an old bomb ruin,

843
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:16,321
over on Lindenstrasse.

844
01:15:16,384 --> 01:15:18,762
They trapped a dangerous
criminal in there.

845
01:15:18,819 --> 01:15:22,130
I never said he was a dangerous
criminal. I said he was a thief.

846
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:25,261
Well, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll go through the rogue's gallery

847
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:28,466
and see if you can spot this criminal
you've been after.

848
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:33,171
It would be a great help to us
if you knew just who we are looking for.

849
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:35,441
- We'll split up and save time.
- Right.

850
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,041
[tapping]

851
01:15:49,683 --> 01:15:50,684
It's thick.

852
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:55,726
Eighteen inches or more.
There isn't much reinforcement.

853
01:15:56,290 --> 01:16:00,534
- It's probably steel mesh.
- [creaking]

854
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:10,043
- That looks dangerous to me.
- It is.

855
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:13,377
- But I was so rushed, that of course...
- Yes, yes, I understand.

856
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,445
Be as fast as you can, Muller.
I'm not eager to be buried alive.

857
01:16:17,511 --> 01:16:19,252
[Muller continues tapping]

858
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:24,391
Wow, this is enough
to give you nightmares.

859
01:16:24,451 --> 01:16:26,089
[Rudolf] That's what I was thinking.

860
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:29,566
[Hermann] Gosh, I didn't know there were
this many crooks in the whole world.

861
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:35,407
I guess I'd better do it.

862
01:16:36,664 --> 01:16:37,665
Call my father.

863
01:16:49,243 --> 01:16:50,813
How much longer?

864
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:53,156
One minute.

865
01:16:59,586 --> 01:17:01,896
- Emil!
- [bell tolling]

866
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,712
[horn honks]

867
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:23,883
- [bell tolls]
- [explosion]

868
01:17:30,117 --> 01:17:31,960
[grunting]

869
01:17:47,935 --> 01:17:49,278
[coughs]

870
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:51,344
[Baron] Muller?

871
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:03,586
[August] It's too narrow, isn't it?

872
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,964
- I misjudged.
- [Baron] So I see.

873
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:12,235
Seems I'm surrounded by incompetence.

874
01:18:12,293 --> 01:18:15,604
Some dynamite will finish it up.
Over here.

875
01:18:16,297 --> 01:18:19,676
Never mind. We'd have to wait
another hour for the clock to strike.

876
01:18:19,733 --> 01:18:22,339
None of us can squeeze through
a hole that size.

877
01:18:23,337 --> 01:18:24,338
None of us?

878
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:29,214
- Hey... the boy.
- [Baron] Of course.

879
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:34,225
And now, my young friend,
I want you to do something for me.

880
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:39,330
I want you to crawl into that hole,
and hand out all the money you can find.

881
01:18:39,386 --> 01:18:41,559
There'll be quite a lot.

882
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:46,330
What if I... say no?

883
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,134
I wouldn't if I were you.

884
01:18:48,963 --> 01:18:51,705
I don't wanna look like a crook.

885
01:18:51,765 --> 01:18:54,575
Crooks, as you will find out someday,
look like anybody else.

886
01:18:54,635 --> 01:18:56,774
And usually are. Untie him, Muller.

887
01:18:56,837 --> 01:18:59,477
Ah. Wow.

888
01:19:01,675 --> 01:19:06,146
Something tells me...
we're making another big mistake.

889
01:19:06,213 --> 01:19:09,092
Ouch! [groans] My leg!

890
01:19:11,085 --> 01:19:12,689
That'll do, boy.

891
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:15,791
- Grundeis, give the boy a boost.
- [Muller groaning]

892
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:17,961
He can't reach the opening by himself.

893
01:19:30,537 --> 01:19:31,447
Ouch!

894
01:19:58,565 --> 01:20:00,806
[Baron] All right, boy, get on with it.

895
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:02,814
I'm becoming very bored with you.

896
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:06,645
I won't do it.

897
01:20:20,321 --> 01:20:23,859
Now then, let's start
with those sacks over there.

898
01:20:24,725 --> 01:20:26,227
The ones hanging up.

899
01:20:38,305 --> 01:20:40,808
There. Now drag it over here to me.

900
01:20:47,915 --> 01:20:49,121
Here.

901
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:01,472
[ripping sounds]

902
01:21:04,999 --> 01:21:06,706
[panting]

903
01:21:07,735 --> 01:21:10,306
- Get your hands out of that!
- [shouts]

904
01:21:10,371 --> 01:21:13,375
- [Hermann] There he is right there!
- [Reinhardt] Where? Let me see!

905
01:21:13,441 --> 01:21:17,912
- [all shouting]
- He stole Emil's money, that's the one.

906
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:20,322
- [man] Grundeis?
- [Stucke] The Mole?

907
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:22,224
I thought he left Berlin.

908
01:21:22,283 --> 01:21:24,729
He did. He was seen
in Munich a month ago.

909
01:21:24,785 --> 01:21:26,890
- [all chattering]
- I found another one.

910
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:30,027
Hey! There's that tall guy!

911
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:31,934
The one at Hotel Kreid.

912
01:21:31,992 --> 01:21:36,407
- [Stucke] Bruno Muller.
- Bruno and Grundeis working together?

913
01:21:36,464 --> 01:21:39,604
- Here's the last one!
- Hey, there's that other guy!

914
01:21:41,202 --> 01:21:43,648
- Werner von Breugel.
- [man] The Baron!

915
01:21:43,704 --> 01:21:45,741
- [Stucke] This time you went too far.
- [all shouting]

916
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:48,616
- [man] It's impossible.
- [shouting continues]

917
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:50,984
Wait. Wait a minute.

918
01:21:51,846 --> 01:21:53,450
Von Breugel is dead.

919
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:55,392
Dead?

920
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:01,123
All right, you kids
had better run along now.

921
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:05,064
We might as well go back.

922
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:08,130
[Hermann] Well, at least we tried
to do the correct thing.

923
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:10,232
[Hans] Maybe Gustav already found him.

924
01:22:10,297 --> 01:22:12,470
[Rudolf] Yeah,
maybe he already found him.

925
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:17,145
If von Breugel's dead,
why is he still in the books?

926
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:21,448
We are not sure he is dead.
He vanished nearly 20 years ago.

927
01:22:21,509 --> 01:22:25,047
If the Baron was alive, he wouldn't
be associating with small time crooks

928
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:26,648
like Grundeis and Muller.

929
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:28,660
[Emil] I can't find any more.

930
01:22:28,716 --> 01:22:31,287
Look in every corner,
everywhere, there must be more!

931
01:22:31,352 --> 01:22:36,802
Never mind, that's enough.
Come on, Muller, let's get out of here.

932
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:41,600
- It's getting stuffy in here.
- [Muller] Give me that basket!

933
01:22:44,165 --> 01:22:46,475
[Baron] All right, Grundeis,
you stay and help the boy out.

934
01:22:51,572 --> 01:22:52,778
[snarls]

935
01:22:53,407 --> 01:22:56,911
Excuse me, I'd like to call my father.

936
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:58,479
No more games.

937
01:23:02,416 --> 01:23:03,724
[telephone rings]

938
01:23:05,452 --> 01:23:07,625
Hello, Sergeant Schiller speaking.

939
01:23:08,622 --> 01:23:10,101
What's that?

940
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:13,570
Please try to calm yourself,
I can hardly understand you.

941
01:23:14,628 --> 01:23:16,266
Who is this?

942
01:23:17,298 --> 01:23:20,074
Heimbold. How do you spell it?

943
01:23:20,134 --> 01:23:24,981
- H-I-M...
- H-E-I-M-B-O-L-D.

944
01:23:25,673 --> 01:23:27,949
[stammers] Yes, I've got that.

945
01:23:28,742 --> 01:23:31,245
Now what is this about a missing boy?

946
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,989
Your nephew?
And what's his name, <i>Herr</i> Heimbold?

947
01:23:35,049 --> 01:23:37,689
- What?
- Emil Tischbein.

948
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:41,731
That's right.

949
01:23:42,156 --> 01:23:44,363
- That's what he said.
- It's my father.

950
01:23:44,425 --> 01:23:46,336
What's that, <i>Herr</i> Heimbold?

951
01:23:46,761 --> 01:23:47,831
An explosion?

952
01:23:48,696 --> 01:23:51,336
- On Lindenstrasse?
- That's the old building!

953
01:23:51,398 --> 01:23:54,174
As a matter of fact, <i>Herr</i> Heimbold,
we are on the job already!

954
01:23:54,235 --> 01:23:57,808
Get the patrol car, Stucke!
One of my men is on his way.

955
01:23:57,872 --> 01:24:00,682
Your daughter and some
of her friends were here, and...

956
01:24:00,741 --> 01:24:02,345
Just a moment, <i>Herr</i> Heimbold.

957
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:07,085
Try to calm him down. It isn't
good for a man to be so excited.

958
01:24:10,618 --> 01:24:12,291
Hello, Papa?

959
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,722
<i>Papa, you there?</i>

960
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:18,668
<i>- [car horn honking]
- Hello, Papa? Can't you hear me?</i>

961
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:22,068
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

962
01:24:22,129 --> 01:24:23,437
[line clicks off]

963
01:24:24,498 --> 01:24:26,375
- Fill in the hole.
- What?

964
01:24:28,035 --> 01:24:31,448
So that's why you weren't
worried about the Mole.

965
01:24:31,505 --> 01:24:32,813
[chuckling]

966
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,453
Muller?

967
01:25:18,018 --> 01:25:21,522
If my calculations are correct,
when that clock strikes again,

968
01:25:21,589 --> 01:25:24,035
the world will be
rid of the Mole once and for all.

969
01:25:25,392 --> 01:25:27,633
[August] Hey! What're you doing?

970
01:25:30,831 --> 01:25:32,401
Let me out of here!

971
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,330
[chuckling]

972
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,420
Dig! If you don't want to spend the rest
of your life down here, you better dig!

973
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,421
[Baron] I must say,
it's been a delightful morning.

974
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:22,961
I've enjoyed it immensely.

975
01:26:28,956 --> 01:26:32,563
The trouble with modern criminals
is that they have no imagination.

976
01:26:34,528 --> 01:26:37,407
I think, perhaps,
I shall winter in Rome this year.

977
01:26:37,464 --> 01:26:38,875
Hold my cane.

978
01:26:54,948 --> 01:26:57,861
I'm going down that ladder
to find out what's happened to Emil.

979
01:26:57,918 --> 01:26:59,898
Don't let those two get away.

980
01:27:04,825 --> 01:27:05,895
Muller?

981
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,732
Cigar.

982
01:27:16,237 --> 01:27:17,910
- [honking horn]
- Emil?

983
01:27:23,244 --> 01:27:24,587
Those crooks!

984
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:27,550
Those double-crossing, murdering crooks!

985
01:27:27,614 --> 01:27:30,094
Look who's talking.

986
01:27:30,151 --> 01:27:32,757
We have to prevent them
from reaching their car.

987
01:28:03,884 --> 01:28:05,693
You forgot to set the brakes again.

988
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:24,210
- Where are the twins?
- Don't know. Come on.

989
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:34,188
Emil, where are you?

990
01:28:38,886 --> 01:28:40,695
Faster, faster!

991
01:28:49,596 --> 01:28:51,371
- [Emil] Help!
- [Gustav] Emil!

992
01:28:51,432 --> 01:28:53,810
- [Emil] Is that you, Gustav?
- Just a minute, Emil.

993
01:28:53,867 --> 01:28:55,710
- [August] It's dynamite!
- I can't budge it.

994
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:56,942
[Emil] Hurry up, get us out!

995
01:28:57,004 --> 01:28:58,711
[August] Put it out!
Hey, you, put it out!

996
01:28:58,773 --> 01:29:02,152
OK, OK, I'm hurrying. It's just that
I have a little problem here.

997
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:04,815
- [August] Help! Hey!
- [Emil] Hurry up!

998
01:29:04,879 --> 01:29:07,450
[both grunting]

999
01:29:08,816 --> 01:29:10,955
- [Emil] Help!
- [grunting]

1000
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,429
[both whimpering]

1001
01:29:14,922 --> 01:29:16,401

Hey, what's going on?

1036

Those men have a basket of money,

1037
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,787
and every few blocks
they stop and give some of it away.

1038

Hey, come on, you guys,
they're giving away money! Come on!

Hurry! Come on, quick!

What are they doing?
What... What do they want?

Pay no attention.
It's obviously some game.

Let's have one more now.
Would you mind doing that again?

1057
01:35:57,992 --> 01:36:01,804
I know of a lovely little prison in
Bavaria with a good view of the Alps.

All right, let's go.

A perfect place to write my memoirs.

1060
01:36:05,466 --> 01:36:08,242
I'll have to see the commissioner
about arrangements right away.

Let's see those badges.

1065
01:36:24,185 --> 01:36:26,256
- Hold it.
- All right, men, show your badges.

1066
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,129
- No smiles
- [man] Look at me.

1067
01:36:28,956 --> 01:36:31,869
When you get the reward, you'll have so
much you won't know what to do with it.

1068
01:36:31,926 --> 01:36:34,406
- Yeah.
- [man] Good.

1069

What are you gonna do with it all?

1070
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:40,207
Well, I think you and the detectives
deserve some of the reward money.

1071
01:36:40,267 --> 01:36:42,838
- Oh, well...
- We agreed to do this for a set fee.

1072
01:36:42,903 --> 01:36:44,780
- That amount is...
- Didn't you ever hear of a bonus?

- More than once I told you.
- Yes, you did, Muller.

1074
01:36:48,075 --> 01:36:50,180
May I trouble you for a light, Captain?

1075

that I get the byline.

- [Rudolf] Hey, scoot over.
- Hey, where's Gustav?

1087
01:37:25,179 --> 01:37:26,988

1093
01:37:47,334 --> 01:37:50,474
The Berlin they don't put
in travel folders. Beautiful? You bet!

Exciting? Yes, sir!

1095

Right this way, please.
