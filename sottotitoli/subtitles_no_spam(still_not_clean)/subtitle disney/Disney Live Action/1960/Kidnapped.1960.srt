00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:11,545
*

2
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,849
He was a good man, davie.

3
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,719
Yes, sir.

4
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:03,691
Here's the key
to the schoolhouse, sir.

5
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,259
Thank you.

6
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,561
I'll go with you
as far as the ford.

7
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:08,829
Yes, sir.

8
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:20,174
Well, davie, are you sorry
to leave this place?

9
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,542
I could answer that,
mr. Campbell,

10
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,344
If i knew where i was going
or what was likely

11
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,446
To become of me.

12
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,348
'Tis a good place indeed.

13
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,583
But then i've never been
anywhere else.

14
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,486
And now that
my father's dead, i'm-

15
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,787
I'm no nearer to him here

16
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,823
Than i would be
in the kingdom of hungary.

17
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,760
To tell you the truth, sir,
if i knew i was going

18
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,529
Where i could better myself,

19
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,663
I should be leaving
with a good heart.

20
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,332
Very well, davie.

21
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,967
Then it behooves me
to tell you your fortune.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,203
Or so far as i may.

23
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,804
You see, davie,
when your father,

24
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,507
That worthy christian man,
began to sicken for his end,

25
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,677
He gave me this letter, which
he said was your inheritance.

26
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,313
"So soon as i am gone,"
said he,

27
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,482
"Give my boy this letter
in his hand

28
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,918
"And start him off for the house
of shaws near cramond.

29
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,787
It was there i came from,"
he said.

30
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,224
"And it's there it befits
my boy should return."

31
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,525
The house of shaws?

32
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,494
What did my father to do
with the house of shaws?

33
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,229
Who can say?

34
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,598
But the name of the family
is the name you bear-

35
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,667
Balfour of shaws.

36
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,570
"To the hand of ebenezer
balfour, esquire, of shaws,

37
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,971
"In his house of shaws,

38
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,207
This will be delivered
by my son, david balfour."

39
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,647
Mr. Campbell,
if you were in my shoes,

40
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,983
Would you go?
Indeed i would.

41
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,586
A lad like you should get there
in but two days of walk.

42
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,357
Good-Bye, mr. Campbell.

43
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,427
May god be with ye.

44
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,362
And, davie!
Yes, sir?

45
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,331
Mind you do not shame us

46
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,500
In yon great house
with all those domestics,

47
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,467
Upper and under.

48
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,670
Show yourself as nice
and circumspect as any.

49
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,372
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,308
And as for the laird.

51
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,376
Remember, he's the laird.

52
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,577
I'll say no more.

53
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,713
It's a pleasure
to obey a laird

54
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,947
Or should be
to the young.

55
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,015
Of course, sir.

56
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,250
Good-Bye, sir.

57
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,556
Good-Bye, davie.

58
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,511
Which way is cramond?

59
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,347
Down the road, mannie.

60
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,614
Have you heard
of a house by there

61
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,616
That they call
the house of shaws?

62
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,684
Aye.

63
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:44,652
'Tis a great house?

64
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,819
Aye.

65
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,821
But the folk
that are in it?

66
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,458
Folk?
Are you daft?

67
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,992
There's no folk there

68
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,527
To be called folk.

69
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,763
Not mr. Ebenezer balfour?

70
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:01,369
Ou, ay, there's the laird,
to be sure,

71
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,372
If it's him you're wanting.

72
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,073
It's none of my affairs,

73
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,842
But you seem
a decent-Spoken lad.

74
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,711
And if you'll take
a word from me,

75
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,714
You'll steer clear
of the shaws.

76
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,370
Mother.

77
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,672
Which way
is the house of shaws?

78
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,007
The house of shaws?

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,110
- Aye.
- That is the house of shaws.

80
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,812
Blood built it,

81
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,514
Blood stopped the building
of it,

82
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,115
And blood will bring it down.

83
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,117
And if you see
the laird,

84
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,719
Tell him what you hear-

85
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,722
That this makes
the 1, 219th time

86
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,757
That jennet clouston
has called down her curse

87
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,593
On his house, byre,
and stable,

88
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,829
Man, guest,
or master,

89
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,864
Wife, miss,
or bairn!

90
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,667
Black be their fall.

91
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,139
Is anybody there?

92
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,809
Is anybody there?

93
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,880
Is mr. Balfour there?

94
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:05,986
Open this door.

95
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,889
You can hear me!

96
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,791
Open this door!

97
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,727
It's loaded.

98
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,832
I'm here with a letter
to mr. Ebenezer balfour.

99
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,835
Then put it down on the
doorstep, and be off with ye.

100
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,037
I will not.

101
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,739
'Tis a letter
of introduction.

102
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,808
And i will deliver it
to mr. Balfour's own hands.

103
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,810
And who are yourself?

104
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,279
A balfour just as he is-

105
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,914
David balfour.

106
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,119
Is your father dead?

107
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,288
Aye, he'll be dead
no doubt,

108
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,057
And that'll be what
brings you to my door.

109
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,788
Enter the kitchen,
will ye?

110
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,226
And touch nothing!

111
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,904
Are you sharp-Set?

112
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,907
Can you eat that drop
of porridge?

113
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,876
But no doubt
that's your own supper.

114
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,344
Oh, i can do fine wanting it.

115
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,947
I'll take that bit
of small beer.

116
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,181
It slockens my cough.

117
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,816
Now give me
alexander's letter.

118
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,755
How did you know
my father's name?

119
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,922
It'd be strange
if i didn't,

120
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,824
For he was my born brother.

121
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:53,126
And little as you seem
to like me

122
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,962
Or my house
or my good porridge,

123
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,898
I'm your born uncle
and you, davie,

124
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,733
My born nephew.

125
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,802
So the letter's for me and
for nobody else in the world.

126
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,939
Now sit down
and fill your belly.

127
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,957
Do you ken what's in this?

128
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,225
The seal wasn't broken.

129
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,794
You saw that yourself.

130
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,963
Aye, but what
brought you here?

131
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,899
You'll have had some hopes,
no doubt.

132
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,003
Aye, sir.

133
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,171
When i heard that i had
kinfolk well-To-Do,

134
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,407
I did think they might
help me in life.

135
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,876
But i want no favors
that are not freely given.

136
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,847
Hoot-Toot, do not fly up
in the snuff at me.

137
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,249
If you're done with
that bit of porridge,

138
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:53,020
I could just take
a sup of it myself.

139
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,123
Has your father been long dead?

140
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,692
Three weeks, sir.

141
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,128
He was a secret man,
alexander-

142
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,431
A secret, silent man.

143
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,999
He'll never have spoken
much of me?

144
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,702
I never knew
he had a brother

145
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,003
Till you told me so yourself.

146
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:13,140
Dear me.

147
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,142
And the house of shaws?

148
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,878
He never spoke of that either,
i dare say.

149
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,112
Not so much
as the name.

150
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,882
To think of that.

151
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,885
Strange nature of a man.

152
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,288
And now come away
to your bed.

153
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,958
Yes, sir.

154
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,498
We'll agree fine yet,
davie, my man.

155
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,067
I'm just as glad
i let you in.

156
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,072
Good night, dear davie.

157
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,139
Will you leave me no candle?

158
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:50,077
Did nobody ever tell you
that a candle costs money?

159
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:03,156
Ebenezer balfour, esquire...

160
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,293
of shaws...

161
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,995
in his house of shaws.

162
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,467
Your breakfast's ready!

163
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,213
Bond, wholesome food porridge.

164
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,081
And cheap.

165
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,283
Aye, and cheap.

166
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,019
I don't imagine
that you'd take small beer

167
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,286
To your breakfast.

168
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,922
I do, but don't
put yourself out.

169
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,157
No, no,
i'll deny you nothing

170
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,192
In reason.

171
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,227
You see, davie,

172
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,394
You came to the right place

173
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,562
When you came
to your uncle ebenezer

174
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,265
For i have a great notion
of the family,

175
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,269
And i mean
to do right by ye.

176
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,938
But i'm a poor man.

177
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,172
Never forget that.

178
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,207
For my father sinfully
wasted the estate

179
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,309
When he began
to rebuild this house.

180
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,346
Mind ye, i sent the workmen
packing ten minutes

181
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,215
After he was dead,
but it was too late, davie.

182
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,417
It was too late.

183
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,286
That's not how
jennet clouston tells it.

184
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,122
Jennet clouston?

185
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,323
And what
did jennet clouston say?

186
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,159
That blood built it,

187
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,226
Blood stopped
the building of it,

188
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,162
And blood will bring it down.

189
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,329
And she told me to tell you

190
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,531
That this makes the 1,219th time

191
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,333
That she called down
a curse on your house.

192
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,936
A witch. A proclaimed witch.

193
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,139
1,219?

194
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,844
That's every day
since i had her sold up.

195
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,046
I'm off to see
the session clerk.

196
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,984
I'll have her roasted
in red peats

197
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,886
Before i'm by with her.

198
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,992
There's too much here.

199
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,294
I can't leave you by yourself
in the house.

200
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,528
I'll have to lock you out.

201
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,530
If you lock me out,

202
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,365
It'll be the last you see
of me in friendship.

203
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,174
David, this is not the way
to win my favor.

204
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,245
Sir, with a proper reverence
for our common blood,

205
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,182
I do not value your favor
at the penny's purchase.

206
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,350
And if you are all the uncle

207
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,886
And all the family
i have in the world,

208
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,554
I wouldn't buy your liking
at those prices.

209
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:23,396
Well-Ell, we must bear
and forbear.

210
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,197
I'll not go.

211
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,599
That's all
that's to be said of it.

212
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,326
When my father was little,

213
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,394
Was he quick at his book?

214
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,396
Alexander?

215
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,597
Not him.

216
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,167
I was far quicker myself.

217
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,935
I was a clever chappie
when i was young.

218
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,973
I found this on the shelf.

219
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:09,409
"To my brother ebenezer

220
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,279
On his fifth birthday."

221
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,082
In my father's own hand.

222
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,717
Yet you are the laird of shaws.

223
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,386
So wasn't he younger
than you?

224
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,422
What made you ask that?

225
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,324
Because if he wrote this
when he was only four,

226
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,293
He must have been very quick
indeed at his book.

227
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,261
And take your hands
from my jacket.

228
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,262
This is no way to behave.

229
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:34,101
You shouldn't speak to me
of your father, davie.

230
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,269
That's where the mistake is.

231
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,605
He was all the brother
that ever i had.

232
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,211
Nevertheless, there are things
that i don't understand.

233
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,479
And whether you like me
to speak of my father

234
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,480
Or whether you do not,

235
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,249
I intend to find them out.

236
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,321
So be it, davie.

237
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,056
So be it.

238
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,457
Go on up there.

239
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,392
At the top of the tower,
there's a wee room

240
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,327
With a chest in it.

241
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,695
Bring the chest
down to me.

242
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,065
There are papers in it
that'll tell you everything.

243
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,166
Very well.

244
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,535
Uh, do not take the light.

245
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,237
I'm not well, davie.

246
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,173
I'm an old man,
and i'm not well.

247
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,317
Get along, lad.
Get along.

248
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,591
Are you alive?

249
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,360
Oh, man, are you alive?

250
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,429
That i am,
and small thanks to you.

251
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,602
The wee bottle
on the mantelpiece.

252
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,681
It's the trouble.

253
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,150
The trouble, davie.

254
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,389
It's the heart.

255
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,358
You're quite well enough
to speak now.

256
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,228
So follow on
with your explanation.

257
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,364
And now you have
one more thing to explain-

258
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,366
Why you tried
to kill me.

259
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,238
For pity's sake,
let me go to my bed, davie.

260
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,241
I'll tell you everything
the morning.

261
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,875
As sure as death i will.

262
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:08,548
Very well.

263
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,222
But this is where you'll sleep.

264
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,597
- Good night to ye.
- Good night, uncle ebenezer.

265
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,916
What cheer, mate?
Here's a letter for your master.

266
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,654
From captain hoseason himself.

267
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,723
And who might
captain hoseason be?

268
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,292
Never heard of hoseason,

269
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,427
Captain of the brig covenant?

270
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,795
And a man what minds
for nothing

271
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,497
In heaven nor on earth.

272
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,600
Why, he'd crack on all sail into
the day of judgment, he would.

273
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,736
And i'm his cabin boy
and proud of it.

274
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,777
You see, davie,

275
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,413
I have a trading venture
with this man hoseason.

276
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,515
And now he writes that he's
ashore at queensferry

277
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,749
And ready to sail.

278
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,818
Look for yourself.

279
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,487
He wants to meet me
at the inn

280
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,455
For we have business
to settle.

281
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,491
So have we.
And ours comes first.

282
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:28,428
No, no, davie man,
do not be hasty.

283
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,896
For after all
that's come and gone,

284
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,299
I doubt if you would believe me
upon my naked word.

285
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,733
Your doubt is right.

286
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:34,901
But, you see,
there he writes

287
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,270
Of mr. Rankeillor,
the lawyer.

288
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,473
Now after we're done at the inn,
we'll jog on to mr. Rankeillor,

289
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,809
And there's a man
you will believe.

290
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,812
For he's lawyer to half
the gentry in these parts-

291
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,449
An old man, forby,
highly respected,

292
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,950
And he knew your father.

293
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,558
Very well.

294
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,826
We'll go to the inn

295
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,495
And directly afterwards
to mr. Rankeillor.

296
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,575
What do they think
of mr. Ebenezer here abouts?

297
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,776
That he's a wicked old man.

298
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,346
Many would like to see him
dancing at the end of a rope.

299
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,980
Jennet clouston,
all the other folks

300
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,049
He's hurried out
of hearth and home.

301
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,717
He was a fine
young fellow once,

302
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,420
But that was before the report
went out about mr. Alexander.

303
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,855
Mr. Alexander?

304
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,358
What was the report
about mr. Alexander?

305
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,360
Only that ebenezer killed him.

306
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,761
You never hear that, man?

307
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,062
What would he kill him for?

308
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,064
Just to get the place.

309
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,332
The house of shaws?

310
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:40,333
No other place
that i ken.

311
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,404
Then my--Then alexander
was the eldest son.

312
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,038
Indeed he was.

313
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,774
What else would he
have killed him for?

314
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:55,415
Master davie, your uncle
tells me great things of you.

315
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,816
I wish i was for longer here

316
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,585
That we might make
the better friends.

317
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,720
But you must come aboard
my brig for half an hour

318
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,755
Till the ebb sets
and drink a bowl with me.

319
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,724
Well, i'm on my way
to mr. Rankeillor, the lawyer.

320
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:05,892
And so is my uncle.

321
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,927
Aye, he passed me
word of that.

322
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,896
But the boat'll set you ashore
at the town pier.

323
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:10,930
Rankeillor's...

324
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,902
take care of that old fox.
He means mischief.

325
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,738
Come on board till
i can get a word with ye.

326
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,786
We must be fast on board.

327
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,961
Welcome to my ship,
mr. Balfour.

328
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,763
And now let me show you
the lie of her.

329
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,933
Mind ye, she's only
a small, trading boat,

330
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,502
Sailing for the most part
from here to the carolinas.

331
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,439
But she's home to me,
mr. Balfour.

332
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,407
That's my berth.

333
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,443
Now since the mates
are never off duty together.

334
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,678
They use the other- Turn
and turnabout.

335
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,747
Here i keep all the valuable
of the ship stores-

336
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,948
Brandy, for instance.

337
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:02,815
But to tell the truth,

338
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,484
My first mate's
only too fond of that.

339
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,919
In here,
pistols, powder, and shot.

340
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,421
You never know
what sort of ruffian

341
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:09,956
You may ship up
on your crew.

342
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,524
- Over here--
- Wasn't there something

343
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:12,925
You were going to tell me?

344
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,093
Something about my uncle?

345
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,429
Was there, young man?

346
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,898
Was something about
my old friend mr. Ebenezer?

347
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,399
Where is my uncle?

348
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,805
That's the point,
young man.

349
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,879
Come back!
Come back!

350
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,482
Bring back that boat!

351
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,551
Take the boy
out of this hole

352
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,919
And put him
in the forecastle.

353
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,053
Why should he not bide here?

354
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,655
After what you did to him

355
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,223
And the fever he has
in consequence,

356
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,191
It wouldn't be beyond him
to die in a place like this.

357
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,894
Well, you was paid to
get rid of him, wasn't you?

358
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:25,164
Mr. Shaun, you've been
with me three cruises,

359
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,232
And if you'd spent less time
at the bottle,

360
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,767
You might have got to know me.

361
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,168
I'm a stiff man,
and i'm a dour man,

362
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,837
But i'm a man of principle.

363
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,904
And i'll have no part
in murder.

364
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,541
Very noble of you.

365
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,743
Besides, if he's dead
when we reach the carolinas,

366
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:37,710
He'll not be worth
a scotch shilling.

367
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,046
Mr. Shaun, take the boy
to the forecastle.

368
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,950
Drunk or sober,
you'll obey my orders.

369
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,058
Take him
to the forecastle,

370
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,259
And be quick about it.

371
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,628
Told you that's where
he should have been

372
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,064
In the first place.

373
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,873
One day, he'll go too far.

374
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:10,042
Look. I'm sick and tired
of being knocked about.

375
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,945
And, one day,
i'm gonna use it.

376
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,948
Well, who got you
into this?

377
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,249
My uncle.

378
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,118
Gah, i'm lucky.

379
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,587
Don't have no relations
at all.

380
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,555
I had a father once, though.

381
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:25,024
I remember he kept
a jackdaw in the parlor

382
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,993
What could whistle
rule, brittania!

383
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,061
But i ain't heard
tell of him or the jackdaw

384
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,297
Since i went to sea
when i was nine.

385
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,100
I'd tell you how
long ago that was,

386
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,068
But i lost count.

387
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,203
Come on.

388
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,806
Can you walk, matey?

389
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,973
I think so.

390
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,141
Lean on me.

391
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:46,078
I'm little,
but i'm strong.

392
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,014
What did your uncle want
to get rid of you for?

393
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,249
I don't know
the whole fact of it yet.

394
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,252
But he's a crafty, old miser
who's stolen an estate

395
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,253
That doesn't belong to him.

396
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,088
Who do it belong to?

397
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,657
Me.

398
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,258
And when i get out of here,
i'll be rich.

399
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,960
Well, ain't that lucky.

400
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,263
But you know something, matey,
it may be a longish time.

401
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,133
Didn't you hear what they said
about the carolinas?

402
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,769
It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

403
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,238
The captain's planning
to sell you off as a 20-Pounder.

404
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,774
A 20-Pounder?

405
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,109
You know what they is.

406
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:20,079
Indentured servants
on the plantations.

407
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,113
Yes, matey,

408
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,982
You may be rich,

409
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,052
But you'll be hoeing tobacco
in the carolinas

410
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,987
For the next seven years.

411
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,199
Mr. Balfour, you mustn't think
i hold anything

412
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,034
Against you personally.

413
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,203
An uncle must be judge
of what's best for his nephew,

414
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,073
For the ways of providence
are inscrutable.

415
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,875
Very well.
If you wish-

416
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,613
Mr. Shaun!
Mr. Shaun!

417
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,855
I knew it would come.

418
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,257
Mr. Shaun has done
for him at last.

419
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,111
Mr. Balfour...

420
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,113
mr. Balfour,
move your berth aft.

421
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,649
You'll serve in
the deckhouse in his place.

422
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,131
You were not here before.

423
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,265
There was another boy.

424
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,100
Yes, sir.

425
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:51,103
I thought so.

426
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,940
The boy is dead,
mr. Shaun.

427
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,275
The boy is dead?

428
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,143
That was the other boy.

429
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,812
The other boy's dead.

430
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,122
You sot and you swine,

431
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,123
Do you know what you've done?

432
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:14,326
You've murdered the boy.

433
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,396
Balfour, put him
in his bunk.

434
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,998
Go on.
Do as i say.

435
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,447
He made me throw away
a bottle of brandy,

436
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,316
And there's no
sense in that.

437
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:41,053
Here, get me another one
from the locker over there.

438
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:44,857
Balfour, this night's work
must never be known.

439
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,893
The lad went overboard,
that's it.

440
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,161
That's what the story is.

441
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,433
And i'd give five pounds
out of my pocket

442
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,136
If it were true.

443
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,369
Listening for the breakers.

444
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,204
We're not past the hebrides,

445
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,372
And weather like this
you don't see in ireland,

446
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,306
You hear it.

447
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:04,136
Look out!

448
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,938
Starboard!
Hard to starboard.

449
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,073
Hard to starboard, sir.

450
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,289
A fishing boat
from the shore.

451
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,256
We must have
cut her in two.

452
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,392
What were they about
on a night like this?

453
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,593
It's no use
lowering a boat.

454
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,961
There's a man here
on the bowsprit.

455
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:35,301
When we struck,
her stern went in the air.

456
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,202
He must have jumped
for the bowsprit.

457
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:37,970
There's something strange
about this.

458
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,338
That's no ordinary fisherman.

459
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,242
Good evening to you,
captain.

460
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,444
It seems to me you keep
a poor lookout on this ship.

461
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,246
I could say the same
about the crew of your boat.

462
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,280
You have nothing
against them, sir.

463
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,616
They were my friends,

464
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,519
And now they're
at the bottom of the sea.

465
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,160
You have a scottish tongue
in your head,

466
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,130
But the french king's
uniform on your back.

467
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,497
You see ill in that, sir?

468
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,333
Now there's no need
to do a mischief

469
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,467
Before you see the need of it.

470
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,269
There's many
a highland gentleman

471
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,271
Who fought for prince
charlie in the year '45

472
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,106
And, when he was beaten,
followed him to france.

473
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,943
Are you one of us,
captain?

474
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,477
No, sir.

475
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,312
I'm for king george,
i'm a true-Blue whig,

476
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,348
And i thank god for it.

477
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,450
But for all that,
i can be sorry to see a man

478
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,584
With his back to the wall.

479
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,454
David.

480
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,356
Very well,
i'll be plain with you.

481
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,323
I was on my way back to france,

482
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:33,192
And there was a french ship

483
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,326
Cruising here to pick me up,

484
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,527
But we missed
in the fog.

485
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,230
And if i get into the hands

486
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,698
Of any of the red-Coated gentry,

487
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,333
Very likely it'll
go hard with me.

488
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:44,136
So if you can take me
to where i was going,

489
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,604
I'll reward you highly
for your trouble.

490
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,239
To france?

491
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,475
No, sir,
that i cannot do.

492
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:53,345
But to set you ashore
where you came up from...

493
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,082
Now we might talk about that.

494
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,386
Half of what's here,
and i'm your man.

495
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,188
The money's not mine.

496
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,323
It belongs to my chief.

497
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:07,193
And i wouldn't use it to buy
my carcass any too dearly.

498
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:10,729
30 guineas if you set me
on shore at the linnhe loch.

499
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,633
You can take it if you like,
or do your worst.

500
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,569
And if i hand you
over to the red coats?

501
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:21,107
You'll be making
a fool's bargain.

502
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,176
My chief has forfeited,
and his estates are in the hands

503
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,113
Of the man from hanover
that they call king george.

504
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:30,016
And his officers collect
the rents or try to,

505
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,583
Because,
for the honor of scotland,

506
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,286
The tenants have not forgotten
their chief in exile,

507
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,258
And they send their rents to him
under the nose of king george.

508
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,128
And this is it--The money
king george is looking for.

509
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,595
So, you see, sir,

510
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,464
You could bring it
within reach of the government-

511
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,266
How much of it
will come to you?

512
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,368
Little enough to be sure,

513
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,105
If they knew
whose money it was.

514
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,441
But i think,
if i was to try,

515
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,509
I could hold my tongue
about that.

516
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:00,779
And i'll have you there too.

517
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,282
Play me false,
and i play you cunning.

518
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,251
If a hand is laid upon me,

519
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:08,554
They'll know what money
this is.

520
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,728
Very well.
What must be must.

521
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,597
30 guineas and done.

522
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,068
Here's my hand on it.
And mine.

523
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:27,506
Well, boy, doubtless
this is the first time

524
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,275
You've seen a wicked rebel.

525
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:30,442
Aye, sir.

526
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,479
By your long face,
you should be a whig.

527
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,581
I am for king george,
my lawful king.

528
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:39,118
He's not the--Well, we won't
quarrel about that just now.

529
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,620
Your bottle's dry.

530
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,456
It's hard if i'm to pay
30 guineas to be denied a dram

531
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,293
On the back of it.

532
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,095
I'll fetch the key, sir.

533
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:52,764
It's not an easy thing
with no pistols with us,

534
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,300
Only our cutlasses.

535
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,502
And the man has a look
of a fighting man.

536
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,337
I take your meaning,
mr. Shaun,

537
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,738
But i'll give you my word.

538
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,308
You'll get your finger on half
the guineas in his purse.

539
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:03,675
Does that satisfy you?

540
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,411
Aye.

541
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,148
Better where he is.

542
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,816
He hasn't room
to use his sword.

543
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,584
We'll keep the man in talk.

544
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:13,752
Well, what is it?

545
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,454
The gentleman's seeking
a dram,

546
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,589
And the bottle's out.

547
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,292
Very well.

548
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,328
- David.
- Yes, sir?

549
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:25,531
Do you know
where the pistols are?

550
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,299
In the locker
by the other door.

551
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:31,337
You see, david,
that wild highlander

552
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,239
Is a danger to my ship,

553
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:36,508
Besides being a foe
to king george, god bless him.

554
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,677
Now the trouble is
that all our firelocks

555
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,646
Are in the deckhouse
under this man's nose,

556
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,714
Likewise the powder.

557
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,251
Now, if we were to go in
and take them,

558
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,652
He might fall to thinking.

559
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,421
But a lad like you might snap up

560
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,323
A powder horn
and a pistol or two

561
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:53,159
Without remark.

562
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,161
If you can do it cleverly,

563
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,595
I'll bear it in mind

564
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,664
When it'll be good
for you to have friends-

565
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,367
And that's when we come
to the carolinas.

566
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,236
Aye, sir.

567
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,212
One of our good
captain's pipes

568
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,746
And his excellent
carolina tobacco.

569
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,418
There's no other way, sir.

570
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,320
I have to tell you.
Tell me what?

571
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,723
That they're planning
to kill you.

572
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:25,724
But it's true, sir.

573
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,893
They're all murderers here.

574
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,595
They've murdered a boy already,

575
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,829
And now it's to be you.

576
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,601
Would you stand with me?

577
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,338
I will.

578
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,572
It'll be the two of us
against the whole ship.

579
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,743
I'll stand with you, sir.

580
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:48,347
Well, then.
What's your name?

581
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,749
David balfour...
of shaws.

582
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,518
And mine's stewart.

583
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,786
Alan breck stewart.

584
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,955
Now, mr. Balfour,
let's look to our defenses.

585
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,458
I have my sword
and my dirk.

586
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,726
You'll have to make do
with a sailor's cutlass.

587
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,294
I have the key
to the pistols, sir.

588
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,630
Good. Then you can fight
like a gentleman.

589
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,666
Now there are two doors,
four windows,

590
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,301
All weather-Boarded.

591
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:10,669
You bolt your door...

592
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,339
yes, sir.
And i'll open mine.

593
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,840
Why open it?

594
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:19,545
Now don't argue with me
so soon, mr. Balfour.

595
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,947
That door is the best part
of my defenses.

596
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,215
I only have one face,

597
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,816
And if the door is open

598
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,884
And my face towards it,

599
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,786
The best part of my enemies
will be in front of me,

600
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,488
Where i would always
wish them to be.

601
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,223
Your post is at the window.

602
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:33,859
And don't fire to this side
unless they get me down.

603
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,827
I'd sooner have ten foes
in front of me

604
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,830
Than one friend
cracking pistols at my back.

605
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:47,473
This is a strange return
of a hospitality.

606
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,575
Sir, i am come of kings.

607
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:51,477
And i bear the king's name,

608
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,712
And this sword has slashed
the heads off more whigs

609
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,714
Than you have toes to your feet.

610
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,418
So call your vermin
to your back...

611
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,354
and fall on.

612
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,756
I'll mind this, balfour.

613
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:09,261
Now let your hand
rule your head,

614
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,896
For the grip is coming.

615
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,339
Mr. Shaun, you will attack
to the open door

616
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:21,773
Where no doubt
they expect the main battle.

617
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:22,941
While you engage them there,

618
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,976
My men will break through
the door on the other side.

619
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,944
As you will.

620
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,915
Ye afraid, mr. Balfour?

621
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:33,985
Yes, sir.

622
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,587
Yes, sir, i am.

623
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,891
Bravely said.

624
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,527
There's many a fine,
handsome gentleman

625
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,397
That wouldn't a-Dared
to say it.

626
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,769
Very well, mr. Shaun.

627
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:51,770
Come on.

628
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,314
That's him
that killed the boy.

629
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:05,351
Look through your window.

630
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,800
Right, break it down.

631
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,039
Hey, come back!

632
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:29,841
Come back!

633
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,996
I've settled two.
How about you, mr. Balfour?

634
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,998
- I think i winged the captain.
- Good.

635
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,466
That makes three.

636
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,534
There's not enough blood let.

637
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,803
They'll be back again.

638
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,671
I can hear them.

639
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,106
I think
they're planning something.

640
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,943
That's just what we want.

641
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,378
Unless we can give them
a distaste of us

642
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:07,679
And be done with it,

643
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,047
There'll be neither sleep
for you nor me.

644
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,094
They're all around us.

645
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,397
Aye, mr. Balfour.

646
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,065
And this time,
they'll be in earnest.

647
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,998
Mr. Balfour,
mr. Balfour!

648
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,066
Mr. Balfour!

649
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,621
Get below,
you scurvy rats.

650
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,462
Man, am i not
a bonny fighter?

651
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,931
David balfour, i love you
like a brother.

652
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,940
Oh, is it because
you've killed a man?

653
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,545
I ken what you're feeling.

654
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,114
I remember it myself.

655
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,082
When i was an age to you.

656
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,619
It's rest you're needing.

657
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,254
I'll take the first watch

658
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,056
And clean up this filth.

659
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:22,147
There's one thing i mislike
about your tale

660
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,282
Than the villainy of your uncle,

661
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,618
And that is that your minister
has the name of campbell.

662
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,119
Mr. Campbell.

663
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,021
But he's a man you'd be proud
to give your hand to.

664
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:30,956
I'd give nothing
to a campbell,

665
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,525
Unless it were a leaden bullet.

666
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,994
If i was dying,
i'd crawl on my knees

667
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,996
To a window
to get a shot at one.

668
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,998
What ails you
at the campbells?

669
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,133
I'm an appine stewart.

670
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,969
And the campbells
have long harried and wasted

671
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:44,870
The people of my name.

672
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:47,305
Aye, and taken lands of us
out of treachery

673
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,107
And never with a sword.

674
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,976
Heh. What happened

675
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,712
When the clans were broken
at culloden,

676
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,314
And the good cause came down,
and the horses ran up

677
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,550
To their fetlocks
in the best blood of the north,

678
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,686
And my chieftain had to flee
like a deer in the mountain

679
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,987
And his lady
and his bairn?

680
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,690
And the campbells
stripped him of his land

681
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:07,158
And plucked the weapons
out of the hands of the clansmen

682
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,027
That held arms
for 30 centuries.

683
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,030
Aye, and the very clothes
from their backs,

684
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:15,133
For now it is a crime
to wear a plaid tartan.

685
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,135
And a man may be cast into jail

686
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,105
That he has a kilt
about his legs.

687
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:21,306
But the one thing
they couldn't kill

688
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,174
Was the love
they bore their chieftain.

689
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,344
These guineas
are proof of that.

690
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,715
Then there steps in a campbell-

691
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:33,118
Red-Headed colin roy
that men call the red fox.

692
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,186
He gets a paper
from king george

693
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,655
That he's an agent
in the lands of appin.

694
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:37,856
And when he finds out

695
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,691
The tenants are sending
their rents overseas

696
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:43,128
To their chieftain, the black
campbell blood in him runs wild.

697
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,330
Oh, will a stewart
get a piece of bread

698
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,699
That i cannot prevent it.

699
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:50,301
So he's sending for lawyers
and papers and red coats

700
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,103
To stand at his back.

701
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,208
And soon the kindly folk
of the country

702
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,211
Will have to pack
and tramp,

703
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,180
Each father's son
from his father's home

704
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,249
And from the lands
where he was fed and bred

705
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:06,818
And played as a lad.

706
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:12,223
The red fox-- If ever
i get you at gun's end,

707
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,359
The lord have pity on you.

708
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,227
I mean that, david.

709
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,196
If a day comes when
i have time and leisure

710
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,666
For a bit of hunting,
there's not enough heather grows

711
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,368
In scotland that can hide him
from my vengeance.

712
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,303
It seems to me,
mr. Stewart,

713
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,138
That you're neither very wise
nor very christian

714
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,140
To blow off so many words
in anger.

715
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:31,810
For they will do the man
you call the red fox no harm

716
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,211
And yourself no good.

717
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:35,313
That's a good observe,

718
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,382
Barring that
about christianity,

719
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:39,284
Of which my opinion
is quite otherwise,

720
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,986
But i'm much of your mind.

721
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,288
Opinion here
or opinion there,

722
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:46,124
It's a known fact that
christianity forbids revenge.

723
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:48,126
Aye?

724
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,829
It's easily seen
that a campbell taught you.

725
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:53,865
It'd be a very convenient world
for them and their sort

726
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:55,100
If there was no such thing

727
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,869
As a lad with a gun
behind a heather bush.

728
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,273
But you're a grand man
in a fight, david,

729
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,009
Even though you have
whig blood in you.

730
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,944
These i had from my father.

731
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,746
And he from his father
before him.

732
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,820
Here, a keepsake
for the fight we made together.

733
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,454
And wherever you go,
if you show that button,

734
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,224
The friends of alan breck
will come around you.

735
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:25,897
Balfour, tell your friend
i'm here for a parlay.

736
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:28,199
Will you give me your word
you'll try no treachery?

737
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:29,167
I do.

738
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,368
I give my word.

739
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,078
Put those things up.

740
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,247
Have i not passed my word?

741
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,883
I doubt not your word
is breakable.

742
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,352
Last night, you haggled
and argle-Bargled

743
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:49,454
Like an apple-Wife,
then gave me your word

744
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:50,288
And your hand to back it,

745
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:53,191
And you ken well
what was the upshot.

746
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,492
Be damned to your word.

747
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,195
You'll get little good
by swearing.

748
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,065
And there are other things
to speak of.

749
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:02,333
You've made a sore hash
of my brig.

750
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,236
I've not men enough
to work her.

751
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,404
There's nothing left
but to run south to glasgow

752
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,039
For fresh hands.

753
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:11,409
And you'll have a bonny tale
to tell there.

754
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,879
A dozen tarry sailors
on the one side,

755
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,047
A man and a halfling boy
up on the other.

756
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,216
Oh, it's pitiful.

757
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,051
Tell 'em what you like.

758
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:22,253
But first set me ashore
as we agreed,

759
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:23,288
And my friend too,

760
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:25,523
For i intend to see him
on his way to his estate.

761
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,359
How can i put you ashore?

762
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,327
My first officer's dead.

763
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,763
You know best how.

764
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:34,065
There's none of us
acquainted with this coast.

765
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,901
And it's one very
dangerous to ships.

766
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,369
You want the 30 guineas
or do you not?

767
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:42,273
If you do, set me on dry land
at appine,

768
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:45,210
Morven, or ardgour-

769
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,312
Anywhere within 20 miles
of my own country,

770
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:50,248
Excepting the country
of the campbells.

771
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,383
That's a broad target.

772
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,053
If you miss it,
you must be as feckless

773
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,288
At sailoring as i found you
at fighting.

774
00:45:57,322 --> 00:46:01,960
It's to risk my brig
and your lives along with her.

775
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:05,931
Take it or want it.

776
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,536
As you will.

777
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:15,440
But if i'd lost less money
on this unchancy cruise,

778
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,276
I'd see you with a rope's end
before i risked my ship.

779
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,948
Are you acquainted
with this coast?

780
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,384
I've been picked up and set
down in it often enough.

781
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,186
Then come and
help me pilot my ship.

782
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:03,354
Is this one of your tricks?
Do i look like tricks?

783
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,256
My brig's in danger.

784
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,267
What do you call that?

785
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,374
The sea breaking
on the reef.

786
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:27,178
So you know where the reef is.
What better do you want?

787
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:28,546
Aye, if it was the only one.

788
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,220
If i'd known about these reefs,
it's not 30 guineas,

789
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:38,356
No, nor yet 300 would have
made me risk my brig

790
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,424
In such a stone yard.

791
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,663
I'm thinking that's what
they call the torran rocks.

792
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,465
Are there many of them?

793
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,535
I'm no pilot,
but it sticks in my mind

794
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:52,003
That there's ten miles of them.

795
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:54,072
Is there a way
through them?

796
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,041
Doubtless,
but where?

797
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:58,576
It also runs through my mind

798
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,379
It's clearer in under the land.

799
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,548
Very well, sir.
We'll try your way of it.

800
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:06,117
But i may as well trust
to a blind fiddler.

801
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:07,518
Pray god you're right.

802
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,287
Pray god i am.

803
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,548
Hard to port!
Hard to port.

804
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,184
Hard to port, sir.

805
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,923
This is not the kind
of death i fancy.

806
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,693
You're not afraid, are you?

807
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:52,163
No, but i'm more of a fighting
man than a sailor man,

808
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,433
And you'll allow
it's a very cold ending.

809
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,607
Clear water ahead, sir!

810
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,575
You were right, sir.

811
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,244
You've saved my brig.

812
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:10,015
And i'll mind that when we
come to clear accounts.

813
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:11,482
Bring her up a point.

814
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:13,351
One more reef to leeward.

815
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,619
A point to port.

816
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:17,122
A point to port, sir.

817
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,328
Easy now.
Easy.

818
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,215
Look out, forward!

819
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,732
Hold on.
Hold on!

820
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,578
You're wasting your breath.

821
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,547
I'm no highlander,
and i have no gaelic.

822
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,792
You mean you're going to steal
from that stinking tub.

823
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,595
Don't fuss yourself, for
i'll not interfere with you.

824
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:08,233
Och, no.

825
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:10,268
I was swept ashore
last night

826
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:11,402
On the other side
of the island.

827
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:14,272
And all i want is someone
to guide me to the mainland.

828
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:16,574
Well, that'll cost you
two shillings.

829
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,643
So you do have english.

830
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:21,412
Only when it's needful.

831
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:22,713
Did you see anyone
from the ship?

832
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,715
- Aye.
- Did any get ashore?

833
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,418
Aye, they went away
to the mainland.

834
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,654
A man dressed like a gentleman

835
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,622
With a uniform
under his coat?

836
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,491
Aye, there was a
great gout like that.

837
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:39,197
Oh, no two shillings
to guide you,

838
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,599
But then you'll be hungry,
and i'll have to give you food.

839
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:43,734
And when i'm gone,
maybe someone else will come

840
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,370
And find this wreck of mine

841
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,272
And take what
doesn't belong to him.

842
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,774
All together it'll cost
you five shillings.

843
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,542
You said two shillings!

844
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:55,313
Oh, well, find your
own way then, manny.

845
00:51:58,383 --> 00:51:59,917
Very well.

846
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,686
Five shillings.

847
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,624
Come then.

848
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:39,390
There's where you go, manny.

849
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:41,392
Over the hills and far away.

850
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:42,860
And where you go too.

851
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,695
I paid you good silver
to guide me.

852
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:52,437
I know what will bring
your english back.

853
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,340
Aye, another five shillings,

854
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:56,574
And i'll lead you
to the ferry.

855
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,543
You're a cheat,
and you're a liar.

856
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,211
And i'd starve to my
death in the mountains

857
00:53:00,245 --> 00:53:02,447
Before i gave you
one penny more.

858
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,383
Give me five shillings
in my hand.

859
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:09,980
Is it you that keeps a ferry?

860
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:12,617
Everybody knows that.

861
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,784
I'm seeking somebody,

862
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,053
And it comes in my mind
that you may have news of him.

863
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,989
His name is alan breck stewart.

864
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,431
I am very much affronted.

865
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:27,798
This is not the way

866
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:30,335
The clan gentleman
should behave to another.

867
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:31,836
The man you ask
for is in france,

868
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:34,071
But if he were in my sporran and
your belly full of shillings,

869
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,873
I would not hurt
a hair of his head.

870
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:40,978
Now pick up your dirty
money and be off with you.

871
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,847
Yes, sir.

872
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,351
Just a minute.

873
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:50,455
Are you, by any chance,
a shipwrecked man?

874
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:51,556
Aye.

875
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:52,890
And have you,
by any other chance,

876
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:53,858
A silver button?

877
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,926
Yes, sir.

878
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,828
Well, i think
you might have started

879
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:01,031
With that end of
the stick, whatever.

880
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:02,967
Now come you with
me to my boat,

881
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,769
For i've the word
to see you come safe.

882
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,675
Two things i tell you plain,
young man.

883
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,843
There is a name you must
never take in your mouth,

884
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,645
And that's the name
of alan breck.

885
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,414
And there's a thing
you must never do,

886
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:18,483
And that is to offer your money
to a highland gentleman.

887
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:21,018
Well, i've just left one
over on the other side

888
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,119
Who wouldn't do anything
without it.

889
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,390
There are highland gentlemen
and highland gentlemen.

890
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,991
And as you are only a lowlander,

891
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:29,360
You have not the sense
to tell the one from the other.

892
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,871
It's the land of appin-

893
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:43,408
And a hard country for men
to care as much about

894
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,776
As the appine stewarts do.

895
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,413
Yonder is duror of appin,

896
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:50,748
And there you must ask
for james of the glens,

897
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:54,018
Who is brother to the chief.

898
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,586
Your friend is on his way there

899
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,422
And will join you when he can.

900
00:55:57,455 --> 00:55:58,623
When he can?

901
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:01,025
The noise is
that colin roy campbell,

902
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:02,927
The man they call the red fox,

903
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,729
Is coming with his soldiers
to turn the stewarts

904
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:06,564
Out of hearth and home.

905
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:09,033
It's a chancy day in appin,

906
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:11,402
And you must take care
to walk softly.

907
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:13,170
But i'm no jacobite
or no rebel,

908
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,407
For i was born
a true-Blue whig.

909
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:20,411
We can none of us help
what we were born.

910
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:49,840
Well, boy,
where are you off to?

911
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:51,442
To duror of appin, sir.

912
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:52,943
And if you know it,
i'd be obliged

913
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:55,012
If you'll tell me where i will
find james of the glens.

914
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,982
James of the glens.

915
00:56:58,015 --> 00:57:01,051
There's many a man who would
think this is an omen.

916
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,921
Here am i on
my road to duror

917
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:05,756
For the job that you ken,

918
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,658
And a young lad
waits in a wood

919
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:10,060
And asks me
for james of the glens.

920
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:12,597
This is an ill subject
for jest, mr. Campbell.

921
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,231
Very well.

922
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,968
What does it mean?

923
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:20,137
Does it mean that james is
gathering his people against us?

924
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,539
If you're thinking of me, sir,

925
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:23,073
I am neither of his people
nor of yours,

926
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,175
But an honest subject
of king george,

927
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,011
Owing no man and fearing no man.

928
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:31,882
Very well said, sir.

929
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:33,183
But if i may make so bold,

930
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:37,021
What does an honest man
so far from his country?

931
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:40,124
And why does he seek
james of the glens,

932
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:43,127
Brother to the chief
of appin?

933
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,863
I have power here, sir,
i must tell you.

934
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,031
I am the king's agent

935
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,233
With 12 files
of soldiers at my back.

936
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,103
If you'd asked me
for james of the glens

937
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,740
On any other day but this,

938
00:57:55,773 --> 00:58:00,077
I should have set you right
and bidden you godspeed.

939
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:05,182
But today
when you ask me this,

940
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,917
Today-

941
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:09,153
Take care, sir.

942
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,059
Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Campbell.

943
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,096
There he is!

944
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,869
Stop that boy!

945
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:28,072
He's an accomplice,
posted here to keep us in talk.

946
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,240
Ten pounds if you take him.

947
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:33,010
Follow them!

948
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:43,253
- In here.
- Alan.

949
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:44,655
Come on.

950
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:11,148
Spread out!
Spread out!

951
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,303
There they go.

952
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,079
In here.

953
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,932
Come on.

954
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,208
Well, yon was a hot burst.

955
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:48,345
Are you still wearied?

956
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,347
No, i'm not wearied now,

957
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,216
And i can speak.

958
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,218
I liked you very well,
alan breck,

959
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,220
But now a campbell man
lies dead on the road,

960
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,255
And your ways are not my ways,

961
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:00,925
And they're not god's ways.

962
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:03,761
And the long and the short
of it is that we must part.

963
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,229
Oh, so that's it.

964
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:08,098
Well, let me tell you,
mr. Balfour of shaws,

965
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,399
If i was gonna kill a man,
i wouldn't do it

966
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,301
In my own country
and bring trouble on my clan,

967
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:14,271
Nor would i set out to shoot him
without any gun in my hand.

968
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:18,108
You mean you had nothing
to do with it?

969
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,312
I swear by the holy iron

970
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:27,084
That i had neither art nor part,
thought nor act in it.

971
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:30,387
Such a fuss
about a campbell.

972
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,388
They're not so scarce.

973
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,423
That i ken.

974
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:37,127
Still, you do know
who did do it.

975
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:40,430
Well, i wouldn't
conscientiously swear to it.

976
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:41,899
But he must have run
close past you.

977
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:43,768
Aye, to be sure.

978
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:46,436
But it's a strange thing that,
just at that moment,

979
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,372
I was tying my shoe.

980
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:50,274
Further more,
if i had seen him,

981
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,475
I have a grand memory
for forgetting.

982
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:54,311
And another thing,

983
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,446
It seemed to me that,
once or twice,

984
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,117
You exposed yourself
to draw the soldiers after us.

985
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,252
That's very likely.

986
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:04,955
And if you were in the shoes of
the lad that fired the bullet,

987
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:07,257
You'd be a deal obliged for it.

988
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:09,827
You see, mr. Balfour, them that
haven't dipped their hands

989
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,396
In any little difficulty
should be very mindful

990
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,464
Of the case of them that have.

991
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:17,134
And that's
the good christianity.

992
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:21,105
Well, i'll not say
it's the good christianity

993
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:23,307
As i understand it,

994
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,275
But it's good enough.

995
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,150
Tomorrow there'll be
a fine to-Do in appin.

996
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,452
You and i must be far away.

997
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,055
You and i?

998
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,958
You may have reason
to run from the red coats,

999
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,326
But it seems to me
that i'm running away

1000
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:43,427
From plain, common sense.

1001
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,296
Alan, this is no
quarrel of mine.

1002
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,298
My quarrel is with my uncle,

1003
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:50,901
And eager i am to
get back to settle it.

1004
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:53,337
So let me go my way
as an honest traveler.

1005
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,538
And if they take me,

1006
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,974
I've done nothing wrong.

1007
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,909
And i'll trust to the
justice of my country.

1008
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:00,878
Justice!

1009
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,548
Man, sometimes i wonder
about you.

1010
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:08,352
That was a campbell
that was killed.

1011
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,387
If you're taken,
you'll be tried at inverara,

1012
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,822
The head place
of the campbells,

1013
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:13,557
With campbells swarming
all over the jury box

1014
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,460
And the biggest campbell of them
all lording it on the bench.

1015
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:20,264
No, david,
we're in the highlands,

1016
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,431
And if i tell you to run,

1017
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,334
Take my word and run.

1018
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:26,837
Mind you,
i'll be no small thing.

1019
01:03:26,871 --> 01:03:30,174
You'll have to lie bare and hard
and brook many an empty belly.

1020
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,276
Your bed'll be the moorcocks,

1021
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,310
And your life will be
like a hunted deer's,

1022
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:36,346
And you'll drag many
a weary foot ere we get clear.

1023
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,017
But if you ask me
if you have another choice,

1024
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,086
I'll answer, "none."

1025
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:45,289
Either you take to the
heather with me, or--Ssk!

1026
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,257
You'll hang.

1027
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,361
Well, that's a choice
very easily made.

1028
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:59,103
I'll prove myself
a gomerel.

1029
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:01,471
The day has found us
where we never ought to be-

1030
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:05,109
Glencoe, and a pass
they're bound to watch.

1031
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:08,012
Well, now it's no worse
to go forward than back.

1032
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:22,426
Spread out on the right!

1033
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:47,051
Down there.

1034
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:58,295
Come on.

1035
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:03,500
Come on. Jump!

1036
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:08,472
Jump!

1037
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,454
I'm me, alan breck stewart.

1038
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,290
Alan breck stewart.

1039
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:14,798
We couldn't have fallen
better. These are cluny's men.

1040
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:16,433
We're to bide with them
until they get word

1041
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:17,767
To their chief
that i'm here.

1042
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,336
Well, i do not ken
who cluny is,

1043
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,306
And i do not care
for his men,

1044
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:24,208
But i would like finally
to get some sleep.

1045
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,788
Well, mr. Stewart,
come awa', sir,

1046
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:41,358
And bring in your friend that as
yet i do not ken the name of.

1047
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,726
And how's yourself, cluny?

1048
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:44,461
You do brawly, i hope, sir.
I'm proud to see you.

1049
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:48,565
And to present my friend, the
laird of shaws, david balfour.

1050
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,567
I'm glad to make the both
of you welcome to my house.

1051
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,702
It's a queer, rude place
for certain,

1052
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:56,340
But since my estates are forfeit
and there's a price on my head,

1053
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:58,808
This is one of the burrows
that serves me well.

1054
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,845
And now we'll
take a dram for luck.

1055
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:04,481
And as soon as these rascals
of mine have the venison ready,

1056
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:05,882
We'll dine.

1057
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,517
And then we'll take
a hand at the cards

1058
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,819
As every gentleman should.

1059
01:08:09,853 --> 01:08:12,356
My life is very dry.

1060
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:15,192
I see little company.

1061
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:16,826
Just sit and twiddle my thumbs

1062
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:19,596
And think of a great
day gone by,

1063
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,865
And weary for another great day

1064
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,833
That we all hope
is upon the road.

1065
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:26,670
And so here's a toast to it-

1066
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:30,807
To the restoration
of our own true king.

1067
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:38,748
Mr. Balfour was born a whig.

1068
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:42,419
But i believe he's learning.

1069
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:54,764
And now, gentlemen, let's
stick a hand at the cards, eh?

1070
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,433
- Good.
- Come, mr. Balfour.

1071
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,735
Sit you down.

1072
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,204
I don't play
at cards, sir.

1073
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:02,739
You--You--You do not play?
Why not?

1074
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:05,309
Well, i've no call
to judge others,

1075
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,411
But i was taught
that it was wrong to gamble.

1076
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:10,414
In the devil's name, what kind
of whiggish, canting talk

1077
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,316
Is this for the house
of cluny macpherson?

1078
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:16,920
Sir, i'll put my hand
in the fire for mr. Balfour.

1079
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:17,954
I bear a king's name,

1080
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,457
And any man i call friend
is company for the best.

1081
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,792
But now mr. Balfour
is tired and must sleep.

1082
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,429
In this poor house of mine,
i'll have you to ken

1083
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:27,231
That any gentleman
may follow his pleasure.

1084
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:29,299
If your friend would like
to stand on his head,

1085
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:32,336
He's welcome, but if he or you
or any other gentleman

1086
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,738
Is not precisely satisfied,

1087
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:35,639
I'll be proud
to step outside with him.

1088
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,942
Sir, i am very wearied,
as alan says.

1089
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:42,312
And what's more, as you're a man
who likely has sons of your own,

1090
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:44,748
I may tell you that it was
a promise to my father.

1091
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,284
Well...

1092
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:48,652
say no more.
Say no more.

1093
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:49,786
There's good heather
to lie on,

1094
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,488
And you may sleep
if you must.

1095
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,490
Yes, sir.

1096
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,972
Have you got any money?

1097
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,807
- A little.
- Well, give it to me.

1098
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,842
- What for?
- For the loan, man.

1099
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:13,943
Just for a loan.

1100
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:15,979
But why?
We'll need the money.

1101
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:19,215
David, would you begrudge me
a loan?

1102
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:29,859
For five guineas...

1103
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:33,297
for five guineas, aye.

1104
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:45,375
Well, have you rested
quite enough, mr. Balfour?

1105
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,844
For the news is that the road
is clear in the south.

1106
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,880
The sooner we start,
the better.

1107
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,517
The little money we have has
a long way to carry us.

1108
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:59,523
I've lost it, and
that's the naked truth.

1109
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:01,825
My money too?

1110
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:04,928
You shouldn't have
given it to me.

1111
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:07,030
I'm daft when i
get at the cards.

1112
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:10,033
Toots-Toots, man,
you'll have your money back.

1113
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:12,336
It's not to be supposed
that i'd be a hindrance

1114
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:14,037
To gentlemen
in your situation.

1115
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,939
But can i take it, sir?

1116
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:17,941
For my friend fairly
lost my money,

1117
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,909
And it puts me
in a painful position.

1118
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,678
You attack my conduct, sir?

1119
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:24,681
No, but i ask your advice,

1120
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:28,051
For whatever i do, it must be
hard on a man with any pride.

1121
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:30,587
Aye, and it's hard
on me too,

1122
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,021
For you give me
the look of a man

1123
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:33,790
Who has cheated poor people
to their hurt.

1124
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:35,859
I wouldn't have my friends
come to my house

1125
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,927
To accept affronts,
no, nor yet to give them

1126
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:38,995
As it seems that you're doing.

1127
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,765
You see, sir,
there is something

1128
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:42,866
To be said on my side-

1129
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,469
That gambling is a very poor
employ for gentlemen.

1130
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:48,004
Mr. Balfour,

1131
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:50,774
You're too nice
and covenanting,

1132
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,477
But, i must confess,
you're a gentleman of spirit.

1133
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:58,448
On my honest word,
you may take this money.

1134
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:02,486
It's what i would say
to my own son.

1135
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:04,921
And there's my hand on it.

1136
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,472
Uh, this is no way
for two friends

1137
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,508
To take a small accident.

1138
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:27,511
I-I have to say i'm sorry,

1139
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:28,645
So it's said.

1140
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,447
If you have anything,
you better say it.

1141
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,482
- No, i have nothing.
- Nothing?

1142
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,150
After i said i'm to blame?

1143
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,420
Why, of course
you're to blame,

1144
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:38,522
And you must bear me out
that i never reproached you.

1145
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,457
No, you've done worse.

1146
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,458
I've long owed you my life,

1147
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:43,092
And now i owe you money too.

1148
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:45,662
You must try to make
that burden easy for me.

1149
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:48,798
You ask me to speak.

1150
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:50,434
Well, then i will.

1151
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,502
You own that you have done
me a disservice.

1152
01:12:52,536 --> 01:12:54,438
And now you blame me
because i cannot laugh or sing

1153
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,005
As if i was glad of it.

1154
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,474
And the next thing will be
that i'm to go down on my knees

1155
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:58,808
And thank you for it.

1156
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:01,077
You should think more
of others, alan breck,

1157
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,113
And then perhaps you might
speak less about yourself.

1158
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:06,650
And when a friend has passed
over an offense

1159
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:08,518
Without so much as one word,

1160
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:10,053
You would be glad
to let it lie

1161
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:12,088
Instead of making it a stick
to break his back with.

1162
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:18,127
Oh, well,
we'll say no more.

1163
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:08,011
Seems to me that you're ill
and can stand no more.

1164
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,246
I am ill.
I know i'm ill.

1165
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,147
But as to the other,

1166
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,182
I can stand anything
you can, mr. Stewart.

1167
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,485
Further down the burren,
there's bound to be a croft

1168
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:16,820
Where i can find you shelter.

1169
01:14:16,853 --> 01:14:18,988
And the red coats too?
What silly talk is that?

1170
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,090
David, i'm not a patient man.

1171
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,192
I never said you were.

1172
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:25,094
Mr. Balfour of shaws,

1173
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,831
You're a stiff-Necked,
ignorant whig.

1174
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:32,001
And you, sir, are old enough
to know your manners.

1175
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:34,203
And from now on, i'll thank you
to speak civilly of my king

1176
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:36,940
And of the campbells too,
who have never done me any harm.

1177
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,174
Have a care, sir.

1178
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,643
Do not forget i'm a stewart.

1179
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:41,978
Oh, i know you bear
a king's name.

1180
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:43,212
But since i've been
in the highlands,

1181
01:14:43,246 --> 01:14:44,648
I've seen many of those
that do,

1182
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,516
And the best i can say
of them is this-

1183
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,285
That they'd be none the worse
for a good washing.

1184
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,121
There are some things said
that cannot be passed over.

1185
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,691
I never asked you to, for i am
as ready as yourself.

1186
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:58,294
And i am no blowhard and boaster
like some that i could name,

1187
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,163
So come on!

1188
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:02,165
David, don't be daft.

1189
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:03,166
I cannot draw on you.

1190
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,301
That was your lookout
when you insulted me.

1191
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,269
David, i cannot,
i cannot.

1192
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:08,972
Defend yourself,
mr. Stewart.

1193
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,974
Defend yourself!

1194
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,043
Defend yourself.
Defend-

1195
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:16,646
David!

1196
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:42,171
"Described as 5'10" in height,

1197
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,340
"Brown, bushy hair,

1198
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,076
"Round-Shouldered,
and a little knock-Kneed.

1199
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:49,613
Shabby with an inclination
to be genteel."

1200
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:05,261
So you've finished
your sleep at last.

1201
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,230
I told you we'd find
a croft along the burren.

1202
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:12,769
And by good fortune, donald dhu
maclaren is of the right party.

1203
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,337
- Alan.
- Hmm?

1204
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,839
Can you forgive me
for what i've said?

1205
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:18,107
Hoot-Toot,
you were so taken with fever,

1206
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:19,776
You didn't know a thing you did.

1207
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:22,178
Besides, that's precisely what
i thought i liked about you,

1208
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:23,613
Is the fact
that you never quarreled.

1209
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:26,049
Now i find i like you better.

1210
01:16:30,887 --> 01:16:33,322
When i heard
there was a stranger here,

1211
01:16:33,356 --> 01:16:35,625
I did not think i would be
so unchancy

1212
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:37,761
As to find an appine stewart.

1213
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:39,262
And when yon door opened,

1214
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,130
The last kind of man
i hoped to see

1215
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:43,867
Was the son
of rob roy macgregor.

1216
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,102
Oh, indeed, sir.

1217
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:48,371
Then i must console myself

1218
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:50,106
With the bill i found
on the way,

1219
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:53,109
Which tells me that this
painful meeting may be turned

1220
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:56,312
To the profit
of 100 pounds.

1221
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:59,215
By a macgregor, no doubt.

1222
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,985
For your tribe have long held
money above honor.

1223
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:05,922
There are words
that i could say to that, sir,

1224
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,090
But i think i will have heard

1225
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,992
That you are a man
of your sword.

1226
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:10,359
Unless you were born deaf,

1227
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:12,061
You'd have heard
a great deal more than that.

1228
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:14,964
Now when my chief drew steel
on a gentleman of your name,

1229
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:16,365
I never heard
that it was a macgregor

1230
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:17,834
That got the best of it.

1231
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:19,302
You mean my father, sir,
rob roy macgregor?

1232
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:20,303
I wouldn't wonder at it.

1233
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:21,971
My father was an old man,

1234
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:25,008
And the match was unequal.

1235
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,410
You and i would make
a better pair.

1236
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:29,679
I was thinking of that.

1237
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,182
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

1238
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:35,318
I've been thinking
of a different matter, whatever.

1239
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,286
Here are my pipes.

1240
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,288
And here are you two gentlemen,

1241
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,424
Both acclaimed pipers.

1242
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:44,360
It is an old dispute
which one of you is the best.

1243
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:48,297
Here is a broad chance

1244
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:49,833
To settle it.

1245
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:53,036
Well, sir,
have you music?

1246
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,872
I can play
like a macrimmon.

1247
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:58,041
That is a very bold word, sir.

1248
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,710
I've used bolder words
before this...

1249
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:02,245
and against
better adversaries.

1250
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,323
*

1251
01:18:57,867 --> 01:19:00,336
That's not very bad,
mr. Stewart,

1252
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:02,505
But you show poor device
in your warblers.

1253
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,240
Me! I'll give you the lie.

1254
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:06,242
Do you own yourself
beaten at the pipes

1255
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:08,177
That you seek
to change them for the sword?

1256
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:10,013
Well said, mr. Macgregor.

1257
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:11,514
So i'll appeal to donald.

1258
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:13,783
You need appeal
to no one, sir,

1259
01:19:13,817 --> 01:19:16,085
For it's the god's truth
you're a creditable piper.

1260
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:18,221
For a stewart.

1261
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:23,827
*

1262
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,445
Enough.
You can play the pipes.

1263
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:43,913
Make the most of that.

1264
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:46,349
*

1265
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:12,441
You're a great piper,
robin macgregor.

1266
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:16,445
I'm not fit to play
in the same kingdom with you.

1267
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,516
A while ago, i could have given
you a lesson with my sword,

1268
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:21,617
But no more.

1269
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,286
It'd go against my heart

1270
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,588
To slice a man up that can play
the pipes like you can.

1271
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,433
There it is,
the old bridge of stirling.

1272
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:40,336
When we get across that, we can
throw our bonnets in the air.

1273
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,371
We're away from the highlands.

1274
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:49,478
Ah, to have come this far

1275
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:51,480
And be bocked
at the last step.

1276
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:52,648
We could set about him.

1277
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,886
And have the whole garrison
after us at his first cry.

1278
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,621
Could we swim across?

1279
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:01,124
I swim like a stone.

1280
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:02,992
But there are boats.

1281
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,660
If i set my mind to it,
doubtless i could steal one.

1282
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,164
No. If you pass the bridge,
you can tell no tales,

1283
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:09,532
But if you leave a boat
on the other side,

1284
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:11,034
Somebody must have brought it.

1285
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:14,303
And the whole countryside's
in an uproar.

1286
01:21:14,337 --> 01:21:16,405
Well, there's nothing
else for it.

1287
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:17,640
We'll have to go back
the way we came

1288
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:20,009
And creep around
the head of the river.

1289
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,110
Look.

1290
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:28,017
Well?
Did you not observe?

1291
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:29,485
He didn't even turn
his head to see

1292
01:21:29,518 --> 01:21:30,586
Whether it was a man
or a woman,

1293
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,322
Which means they're not
on the lookout for us here.

1294
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:35,491
They didn't think
we'd be such gulks as to cross

1295
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:37,260
Under the noses
of the garrison.

1296
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:40,229
David, it's a chief
military principle

1297
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:42,999
To go where you're
least expected.

1298
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:46,469
So this is where we cross.

1299
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,542
Your very humble
and obedient servant, madam.

1300
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,678
Have you got a twist
of tobacco?

1301
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:57,480
For which i'll give
you sixpence.

1302
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:04,487
I'll need something
to light it with,

1303
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,555
So if you've got a tinderbox,

1304
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:07,623
I'll give you a shilling.

1305
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:14,597
But, madam, i'll need something
to smoke it in.

1306
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:18,367
So make it two shillings
for your pipe.

1307
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,644
May god bless you, madam.

1308
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:34,283
What are those for?

1309
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:36,185
I'll tell you, since
you seem so inexperienced

1310
01:22:36,219 --> 01:22:37,486
In such matters.

1311
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,754
Hunted men are always
on the run.

1312
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,523
- You'll grant that?
- Aye.

1313
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:42,992
So we must seem to be
in no hurry at all.

1314
01:22:43,026 --> 01:22:44,460
That's what i want this for.

1315
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:46,695
I'll wander up there,
and then light it

1316
01:22:46,729 --> 01:22:48,031
As slowly as can be.

1317
01:22:48,064 --> 01:22:49,498
You saunter by,

1318
01:22:49,532 --> 01:22:52,368
And after a while,
i follow.

1319
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:55,638
Look at that.

1320
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:59,642
At least it's not raining.

1321
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:03,112
Hoot-Toot, twice the redcoats,
half the risk.

1322
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,613
Now he's got someone
to talk to,

1323
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:07,350
Why should he
fuss himself over us?

1324
01:23:07,383 --> 01:23:09,652
Now, david,
keep a cool head.

1325
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:13,522
If you lose your courage
and take to your heels,

1326
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:15,358
We're both dead men.

1327
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:26,735
And what a time i had.

1328
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:28,371
Didn't we just?

1329
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:29,805
Five weeks
in the punishing mountains

1330
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:33,209
And not a thing
to show at the end of it.

1331
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:35,044
Fellow by the name
of campbell, wasn't it?

1332
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:36,345
I don't know.

1333
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:38,147
One scotsman's
just like another to me.

1334
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:40,216
But we were supposed
to be there

1335
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:43,519
To guard him,
so when he got done in, well,

1336
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:45,554
We had to chase off after
the two blokes what done it.

1337
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:47,490
You never nabbed
either of 'em, eh?

1338
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:50,226
Nah, and couldn't they run?

1339
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:51,694
Like a pair
of blooming rabbits.

1340
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:53,762
Took us over half of scotland
they did.

1341
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:57,066
I heard they got a reward
out for 'em now.

1342
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,234
Yeah, yeah, they have.

1343
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:00,369
100 quid for the big one,

1344
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:04,540
And 50 for the little one.
Bloody hell.

1345
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:06,709
Blimey, what i could do
with 150 quid.

1346
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:08,777
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what i'd do?

1347
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:10,079
Yeah, what?

1348
01:24:10,113 --> 01:24:12,581
I'd buy myself
a nice, little pub

1349
01:24:12,615 --> 01:24:14,583
Right in front
of the barracks.

1350
01:24:14,617 --> 01:24:16,685
I would.

1351
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,521
And i'd sit there
out in the sun,

1352
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:22,458
Drinking me own beer
from noon onward...

1353
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,402
Mr. Rankeillor?

1354
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:35,404
Are you mr. Rankeillor,
the lawyer?

1355
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:38,841
I am, but i do not know
your name nor yet your face.

1356
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,876
My name is david balfour, sir.

1357
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,878
And i believe i have some rights
on the estate of shaws.

1358
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:45,414
David balfour.

1359
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:48,584
And where did you come from,
mr. David balfour?

1360
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:51,620
From many strange
places, sir.

1361
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:54,223
'Tis six weeks since
i started for that door,

1362
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:55,391
But i was kidnapped
on the way

1363
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,827
By someone who did not
want me to reach it.

1364
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:02,131
And who was this villainous person,
mr. Balfour?

1365
01:25:02,165 --> 01:25:04,567
Someone whom i think
you know, sir-

1366
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,603
My uncle ebenezer.

1367
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:09,538
Pray come inside.

1368
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:16,779
No, mr. David,
your uncle did not steal

1369
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:18,181
The house of shaws.

1370
01:25:18,214 --> 01:25:20,416
It came to him
in a much more singular way

1371
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,318
As the result
of a love affair.

1372
01:25:22,351 --> 01:25:23,886
- A love affair?
- Yes, mr. David.

1373
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:25,521
Your uncle was not always old,

1374
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:28,591
And, what may surprise you
more, not always ugly.

1375
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:30,493
So when he and your father
fell in love

1376
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:31,827
With the same young lady,

1377
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,597
Oh, he made mighty certain
of the victory.

1378
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,832
But when instead the young lady
chose your father,

1379
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,502
He screeched like a peacock.

1380
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:41,904
Well, mr. David,
the end of it was

1381
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:44,340
That they came
to a sort of bargain.

1382
01:25:44,373 --> 01:25:47,376
Your father took the lady,
who became your mother,

1383
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:50,546
But he left your uncle ebenezer
with the estate.

1384
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:53,949
They talk a lot
about generosity,

1385
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,852
But i often think
the happiest consequences flow

1386
01:25:56,885 --> 01:26:00,223
When a gentleman consults
his lawyer.

1387
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:04,693
Certainly, your father's hasty
decision brought no joy at all

1388
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:07,830
To your uncle ebenezer,
as you've seen for yourself.

1389
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:09,365
I have indeed, sir.

1390
01:26:09,398 --> 01:26:12,368
Money was all he got
out of his bargain.

1391
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:13,736
And he came to think
the more of money.

1392
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:16,705
He was selfish
when he was young.

1393
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:17,973
He's selfish
now he's old.

1394
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:23,312
And the latter end to all this
selfishness you know yourself.

1395
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:27,650
Yes, sir, but in all this,
what is my position?

1396
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,518
Oh, the estate's yours.

1397
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:31,820
Beyond a doubt, your father
might give up his own rights.

1398
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:34,223
He couldn't sign away yours.

1399
01:26:34,257 --> 01:26:36,225
So the day he died,

1400
01:26:36,259 --> 01:26:39,228
You became the laird of shaws.

1401
01:26:39,262 --> 01:26:44,867
However, getting possession-
Quite another question.

1402
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,570
A lawsuit is expensive,

1403
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:51,374
And a family lawsuit
is always scandalous.

1404
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:53,609
But what possible answer
could my uncle have?

1405
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:56,912
Well, he would begin,
no doubt,

1406
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:59,282
By denying you were
his nephew.

1407
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:00,549
How could he?

1408
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:02,585
He as much as admitted it
by having me kidnapped.

1409
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:03,919
Very true.

1410
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,754
How are we to prove
that he had you kidnapped?

1411
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:08,924
Mr. Rankeillor,
i do not intend

1412
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:10,793
To haul down my colors
and leave my uncle

1413
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:12,395
A fortune that isn't his.

1414
01:27:12,428 --> 01:27:13,529
Quite so.

1415
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,597
So the only thing to do

1416
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:15,964
Is to make him admit
the kidnapping

1417
01:27:15,998 --> 01:27:16,865
In front of witnesses.

1418
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:19,902
And just how
are you gonna manage that?

1419
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:22,471
Oh, i could not manage it,

1420
01:27:22,505 --> 01:27:23,739
And i do not think
that even you could,

1421
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:27,543
For it needs a violent man
without too much concern

1422
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,378
For what is proper
and correct.

1423
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:32,581
And for that, sir, i think
i know just the man we need.

1424
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:41,890
Well?

1425
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,560
Have a care
with that blunderbuss.

1426
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,429
They're nasty things to burst.

1427
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:48,030
Who are ye,
and what brings you here?

1428
01:27:48,063 --> 01:27:51,967
What brings me here
is more your affair than mine.

1429
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,569
And if you're sure
it's what you'd like,

1430
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,638
I'll set it to a tune
and sing it to you.

1431
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,039
Well, what is it?

1432
01:27:57,072 --> 01:27:59,875
David.

1433
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,746
I'm thinking
i had better let ye in.

1434
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,015
I dare say that,
but the point is, would i go in?

1435
01:28:07,049 --> 01:28:08,517
And i'll tell you
what i'm thinking.

1436
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:09,918
I'm thinking it's here
upon this doorstep

1437
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:11,354
That we must confer
upon this business.

1438
01:28:11,387 --> 01:28:13,021
And it shall be here
or nowhere at all,

1439
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:14,590
For i'll have you to understand
that i'm as stiff-Necked

1440
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,759
As yourself, and a gentleman
of better family.

1441
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,994
Oh, well,

1442
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:22,365
What must be must be.

1443
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:36,545
One step nearer,
and you're as good as dead.

1444
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:39,682
A very civil greeting,
to be sure.

1445
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:42,651
This is a very chancy kind
of a proceeding,

1446
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:44,019
And i'm bound
to be prepared.

1447
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,355
And now that we understand
one another,

1448
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:47,656
You can name your business.

1449
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,992
Well, you that are
a man of understanding

1450
01:28:50,025 --> 01:28:53,028
Will doubtless have perceived
that i am a highland gentleman.

1451
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,364
My name has no business
in my story.

1452
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:57,032
But the country of my friends

1453
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,702
Is not very far
from the torran rocks.

1454
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:05,007
Well, it seems that there was
a ship that went aground there.

1455
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,044
A gentleman of my family
came upon a lad

1456
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,414
That was half-Drowned.

1457
01:29:11,447 --> 01:29:14,149
He brought him to,
and he and some other gentlemen

1458
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,419
Clapped him
in an old, ruined castle where,

1459
01:29:16,452 --> 01:29:20,856
From that day to this, he's been
a great expense to my friends.

1460
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:24,393
Now they, not being
so particular about the law

1461
01:29:24,427 --> 01:29:25,428
As some i could name,

1462
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:27,830
In finding out the lad owns
some decent folk,

1463
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,566
Asked me to give you a call
and confer upon the matter.

1464
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:34,036
And i can tell you this
from the start-

1465
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:35,904
That unless we can agree
on some terms,

1466
01:29:35,938 --> 01:29:38,874
You're not likely
to set eyes on the lad again.

1467
01:29:38,907 --> 01:29:41,944
For my friends
are not very well off.

1468
01:29:41,977 --> 01:29:44,413
I'm not very caring.

1469
01:29:44,447 --> 01:29:46,181
He was never a good lad
at the best of it,

1470
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,050
And i have no call
to interfere.

1471
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,787
Oh, come on, you wouldn't
desert your brother's son.

1472
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,489
It wouldn't make you
very popular in the countryside.

1473
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:56,659
I'm not just very popular
the way it is,

1474
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:58,761
So that's idle talk,
my buckie.

1475
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:02,498
Mr. Balfour,
we thought you liked david,

1476
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:04,166
Would pay to get him back.

1477
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:05,668
But it seems
that's not the case.

1478
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:07,603
And i'm thinking
you've very good reasons

1479
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:09,137
For not wanting him back,

1480
01:30:09,171 --> 01:30:10,939
And, instead,
you'll pay us to keep him.

1481
01:30:10,973 --> 01:30:14,477
That'll put as pretty a penny
in our pocket as the other.

1482
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:15,644
I do not follow you there.

1483
01:30:15,678 --> 01:30:17,580
Now see here,

1484
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:18,781
You don't want the lad back,

1485
01:30:18,814 --> 01:30:20,115
What do you want
done with him

1486
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:21,750
And how much will you pay?

1487
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:23,952
Come, sir.
I'm a highland gentleman,

1488
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:26,455
Not a sniveling beggar to kick
my heels at your hall door.

1489
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:28,223
Either give me an answer
in civility,

1490
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,958
Or i'll run three feet of steel
in your vitals!

1491
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:32,127
Hey, sir, give me a minute.

1492
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:35,498
I'm trying to be as civil
as it's morally possible.

1493
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:37,032
Just tell me
what you'll be wanting,

1494
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:38,066
And we'll agree fine.

1495
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,470
In two words--Do you want
the lad killed or kept?

1496
01:30:41,504 --> 01:30:43,472
Oh, kept, kept.

1497
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:45,207
Have no bloodshed,
if you please.

1498
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,509
That'll be the dearer.

1499
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:48,644
The dearer?
What for the dearer?

1500
01:30:48,677 --> 01:30:51,547
Killing is easier
and quicker.

1501
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:54,216
To keep the lad
will be a troublesome business.

1502
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:57,653
I'll have him kept, though.
I'm a man of principle.

1503
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:59,522
And if i have to pay for it,
i'll pay for it.

1504
01:30:59,555 --> 01:31:00,523
Ah.

1505
01:31:00,556 --> 01:31:02,491
What about the price?

1506
01:31:02,525 --> 01:31:03,559
Of course,
i'll have to ken first

1507
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:04,893
What you paid captain hoseason.

1508
01:31:04,927 --> 01:31:06,662
Captain hoseason?
What for?

1509
01:31:06,695 --> 01:31:08,531
- For kidnapping the boy.
- It's a lie!

1510
01:31:08,564 --> 01:31:10,633
It's a black lie.
He never was kidnapped.

1511
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:12,134
He lied in his throat
that told you that.

1512
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:14,069
Hoseason wouldn't like
to hear you say so.

1513
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:15,838
What do you mean?
Was it hoseason that told ye?

1514
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:18,040
How else you think i ken,
you stupid, old runt?

1515
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:20,509
Oh, hoseason and i
are partners.

1516
01:31:20,543 --> 01:31:22,511
We gang shares.

1517
01:31:22,545 --> 01:31:24,680
But i'm bound to say
you struck a fool's bargain

1518
01:31:24,713 --> 01:31:27,182
When you let a man like that
sail a man so far forward

1519
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,217
In your private affairs.

1520
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:30,519
The point in hand is this-

1521
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:32,254
How much did you pay him?

1522
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:33,522
How much does he say
i paid him?

1523
01:31:33,556 --> 01:31:34,557
That's my concern.

1524
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,091
Well, i do not doubt
that he lied.

1525
01:31:36,124 --> 01:31:38,527
I don't care what he said.
I tell you that he lied.

1526
01:31:38,561 --> 01:31:39,895
And the solemn
god's truth is this-

1527
01:31:39,928 --> 01:31:41,730
I paid him no more
than 20 pounds.

1528
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:43,566
- You paid him 20 pounds?
- Aye.

1529
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:44,567
- To kidnap the lad?
- I swear it.

1530
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,500
20 pounds.

1531
01:31:45,534 --> 01:31:46,535
Mind ye, i'll be perfectly frank
with you.

1532
01:31:46,569 --> 01:31:49,271
He was to have the selling
of the lad in carolina,

1533
01:31:49,304 --> 01:31:50,906
Which would be 20 pounds more,

1534
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:52,608
But not out of my
pocket, you see.

1535
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:54,242
Thank you, mr. Stewart.

1536
01:31:54,276 --> 01:31:55,544
I think we have
just what we need.

1537
01:31:55,578 --> 01:31:56,945
Good evening, uncle.

1538
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:58,213
It's a fine night,
isn't it?

1539
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:01,216
David, is that you, man?

1540
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,552
Yes, it's me, uncle.

1541
01:32:03,586 --> 01:32:07,222
Then i have wasted
my 20 pounds.

1542
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:16,732
It's a braw new suit,
mr. Balfour of shaws.

1543
01:32:16,765 --> 01:32:18,934
I don't have
just the hang of it yet.

1544
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:20,636
You're none
too early, davie.

1545
01:32:20,669 --> 01:32:22,070
The tide's on the turn.

1546
01:32:22,104 --> 01:32:25,240
I'm waiting for a signal
to go aboard.

1547
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:26,775
So you have a ship.

1548
01:32:26,809 --> 01:32:28,611
There she is.

1549
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:30,245
The captain's the right party.

1550
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:32,214
I'll be in france
within the week.

1551
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:37,219
How about you?

1552
01:32:37,252 --> 01:32:38,621
It's all settled and sealed.

1553
01:32:38,654 --> 01:32:41,890
To think of it, davie,

1554
01:32:41,924 --> 01:32:45,628
Only a week ago, you lay under
heaven with an empty belly

1555
01:32:45,661 --> 01:32:47,996
And in fear of death.

1556
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:49,932
And now you're
the laird of shaws.

1557
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:52,968
I suppose so.

1558
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:55,037
You don't seem very joyful
about it.

1559
01:32:57,706 --> 01:32:58,907
I'll get used to it.

1560
01:33:02,945 --> 01:33:05,614
There's the signal.

1561
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:15,924
When will you be back?

1562
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:17,760
The highlands
will be no safe place

1563
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:19,662
For alan breck for a while.

1564
01:33:19,695 --> 01:33:21,630
But, later on,
when the noise dies down,

1565
01:33:21,664 --> 01:33:25,100
You'll come away one day
behind a heather bush

1566
01:33:25,133 --> 01:33:27,736
Or watching you
from the wood about you.

1567
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:36,378
Well, good-Bye.

1568
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:43,618
Good-Bye, alan breck.
