1
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,879
- Goodnight, John.
- Goodnight, milord. Goodnight, milady.
- Goodnight.

2
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,072
Excuse me, sir. Is that
Lord Glenarvan's yacht?

3
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,674
- It is.
- Well, we'd like to see him, please.

4
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,479
Oh, would you, now?
He'll be horribly hurt to know...

5
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,710
you didn't arrive
for the start of the party.

6
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,711
We didn't even know about it.

7
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,678
I bring news of one of his ships,
disappeared at sea.

8
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,672
A message from Captain Grant
of the <i>Britannia.</i>

9
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,070
Captain Grant?
Why, he's dead, isn't he?

10
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,550
And just how would he get
a bottle where he's at?

11
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,634
- Go on. Get on with you.
- Captain Grant's our father,
and he's not dead.

12
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,870
I'm Mary Grant,
and this is my brother, Robert.

13
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,475
Oh, no offence intended, miss.

14
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,677
He was a good man, he was.
The best this line ever had.

15
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,914
It's just that it's, uh, hard to take
serious. The note in the bottle, I mean.

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,275
Still, l-I suppose
it could happen.

17
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,670
And that's why we just have to
see his lordship before he sails.

18
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,274
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I've had my orders.

19
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,874
Nobody aboard
except invited guests.

20
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,999
But we've come all the way from Plymouth
today. It has cost me my last franc.

21
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,036
And we haven't
had a thing to eat.

22
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,476
So that's it.
Another trick, is it?

23
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,155
Get out of here with your wild tales,
your hard-luck stories.

24
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,518
You almost had me taken in for a minute.
Go on. Stand clear of the gate there.

25
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,068
Come on, Robert.

26
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,994
- Lovely.
- Goodnight to you.

27
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,719
You two, come back here!

28
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,075
Come back, I said.

29
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,993
You children,
come here at once.

30
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,958
- Did you hear me?
- Good evening.

31
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,793
- Come back, I said! Come back at once!
- Good evening.

32
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,435
Come out now, matey,
wherever you are.

33
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,353
You wouldn't want me to lose
my bloomin' job now, would you?

34
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,630
- How do we get past this one?
- Goodnight, sir.

35
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,716
Oh, very simple.
Just walk nonchalantly...

36
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,519
up the plank backwards.

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,398
Yes, with all the confusion...

38
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,790
he won't be able to tell you
from the departing guests.

39
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,633
Go on, now. Go on.

40
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,039
Goodnight, sir, madam.

41
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,790
Goodnight, sir.

42
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,675
Goodnight, sir, madam.

43
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,750
- Come on.
- You now.

44
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,559
Go on. Go on, go on!

45
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,551
Goodnight, sir.

46
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,473
Goodnight.

47
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,553
Little boy, would you be so kind
as to get my wrap for me?

48
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,234
- I think I left it in the salon.
- You children, what are you
doing there?

49
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,158
- Stop those children!
- Evening.

50
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,391
- Come back, you two!
- Good evening. Good evening, sir.

51
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,871
Come back. Stop, you two!
Come on. Stop!

52
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,872
Come back, you two.
Come back!

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,309
- May I give you some more turkey?
- Thank you.

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,153
Not too much.
The salmon is delicious.

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,955
I hear Lord Glenarvan is going
to Venezuela again this year.

56
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,315
Yes. He so much
enjoys the seasons.

57
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,868
How long does he plan
to be away this time?

58
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,272
He seems very proud
of this new, uh, steamer.

59
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,836
Good evening.

60
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,238
Uh-Uh, cloves from Madagascar.

61
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,880
It is not bad for English ham.

62
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,355
Oh, excuse me, madam.

63
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,839
There's someone
under the table! Look!

64
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,270
There they are!
Head them off the other way.

65
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,592
Steward! Steward!
Up there on the deck!

66
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,275
- Oh, let me go!
- Why?

67
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,635
Come back, you two! Come back!

68
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,790
Oh, come here.
Come here now, then. I got you!

69
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,189
- I got you!
- Oh, let me go!

70
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,156
- You leave him alone!
- Oh!

71
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,233
Oh. It's you, your lordship.

72
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,118
- Isn't it?
- I daresay, but who are you?

73
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,192
- Oh, please, your lordship,
we must speak to you.
- We've come all the way from Plymouth.

74
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,477
- I'm Mary Grant, and this is my
brother. Our father's Captain Grant.
- On the <i>Britannia.</i>

75
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,313
- And he's alive. And you must send
a ship to bring them back.
- With two of his men.

76
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,392
- As quick as you can.
- Now, just a minute.

77
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,436
Come along.
We'll talk it over.

78
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,080
Now, then, how do you know
your father's still alive?

79
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,230
- He put a note in a bottle.
- And a French professor...

80
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,754
- Monsieur Paganel, he found it.
- Oh-Oh, that again.

81
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,910
- What do you mean?
- My dear children, ever since...

82
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,719
I posted the reward
for news of your father's ship...

83
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,110
people have been turning up with notes
they claim to have found in bottles.

84
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,475
- How many is this, John?
- Uh, 22, Father.

85
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,553
If I had my way,
every last one of the culprits
would be hanged from the yardarms!

86
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,710
Exploiting human misery,
that's what it is.

87
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,836
Nothing more vicious,
more treacherous.

88
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,036
But it is from my father.
I can tell.

89
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,078
Monsieur Paganel, show them
the note you found in the bottle.

90
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,831
<i>Voilà.</i> Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
Wr-Wrong bottle.

91
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,390
Ah, this is the one.

92
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,391
First question always,
where'd you find the bottle?

93
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,948
Well, y-you see, milord,
l-I went fishing with some students.

94
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,474
And I suppose you cut open a fish
and found the bottle inside.

95
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,472
<i>Oui, oui,</i> milord,
a 220-pound shark!

96
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,393
Osborne, throw this man off the ship
before I turn him over to the police.

97
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,631
- No, your lordship.
- But it is the truth, what I tell you.

98
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,711
Ridiculous. Why should a shark
want to swallow a bottle?

99
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,519
Oh, what was in his mind,
l-l-I don't know.

100
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,512
l-I tell you only what
was in his stomach.

101
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,831
You make a career of this,
do you, exploiting children?

102
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,438
I am Jacques Eliacin
Francois Paganel.

103
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,672
Professor of geography,
Université of Paris.

104
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,751
My credentials, milord. Oh!

105
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,071
Forged, I imagine, like the note
in the bottle. All right, Steward.

106
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,798
Come along.

107
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,676
- Oh, no, your lordship, you can't!
- Monsieur Paganel's our friend.

108
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,228
Just a minute, children.
I have something to say to you.

109
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,232
If we could be
alone for a moment.

110
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,996
Take your hands off me, messieurs.
Never have I been thrown
from anyplace in my life.

111
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,878
Let's not set a precedent.

112
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,193
My dear children, don't you think
I'd be the first to respond...

113
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,350
if I thought there was the slightest
chance of finding your father...

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,556
or any of his crew alive?

115
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,313
I'd go to the ends of the earth,
and that's no idle boast.

116
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,470
The Glenarvan motto:
<i>"Persevero".</i>

117
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,551
It's been the family creed
for 800 years.

118
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,156
But it's not a hoax. I saw the note
myself, and I know my father wrote it.

119
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,151
The way he makes his letters.
I can tell.

120
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,151
Just a little more clever
than the rest, that's all.

121
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,835
When you consider the odds, it would be
fantastic just finding the bottle.

122
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,832
But this business about it
being swallowed by a shark...

123
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,639
Well, what would my father have to do?
Come back here himself and say...

124
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,314
"Yes, I wrote the note.
Now come and find me."

125
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,119
Did I understand you to say
you came all the way from Plymouth?

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,714
Tell Osborne to get cabins ready
for 'em. We'll drop them
off there on the way.

127
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,711
- Very well.
- But what about Monsieur Paganel?

128
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,839
- We can't go off here and leave him.
- Now, my dear, I'm only doing
what's best for you.

129
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,835
Now, then, how'd he get past you
in the first place?

130
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,956
Well, how did he get past you,
if it comes to that?

131
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,749
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, here's his lordship's wine.

132
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,071
- And about time too.
- A bit late, aren't you, Charlie?

133
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,470
It'll be a pretty rough trip
if his lordship doesn't get his wine.

134
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,476
Uh, follow me, please.

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,595
This way, miss. Cabin number five
on the starboard side.

136
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,230
Of course, Richard's
a lot older than you.

137
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,313
Maybe not actually in years, but...
Oh, he's been around more.

138
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,789
I don't know what
you mean by that.

139
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,440
After all, there's probably
nobody else in the world my age...

140
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,636
who's made as many trips
to the Mediterranean as I have.

141
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,757
Well, that's just it! I mean...

142
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,675
have you ever been to, oh,
South America, for instance?

143
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,228
As a matter of fact, no.

144
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,757
- Pacific Ocean. Ever seen that?
- It's only an ocean.

145
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,354
Perhaps you should have waited
and had breakfast with my father.

146
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,035
He's the one
who'd have to give the order
to change course for South America.

147
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,315
Oh, he would go.
Nothing could stop him...

148
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,516
if it were for something
you could really believe in...

149
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,114
and not this note in a bottle.

150
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,957
Let me ask you something. If you were
a castaway and you had a bottle...

151
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,270
wouldn't you put a note in it
and throw it into the sea?

152
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,638
Oh, I don't think so. After all,
it's such a small chance, isn't it?

153
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,078
Well, what would you do, then?
Just sit there with the empty bottle
until you died or something?

154
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,151
All right. I suppose I would try it.

155
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,152
But I wouldn't expect someone
to find it inside a shark.

156
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,435
Well, if that's where
they did find it...

157
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,435
you wouldn't expect them
to just forget about you, would you?

158
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,431
You never saw that Frenchman before
in your life...

159
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,511
did you, until he showed up
with the bottle?

160
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,670
And yet, you believe
every word he says.

161
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,914
And no matter what he says, you
and your father refuse to believe him.

162
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,798
Suppose I told you that I'd found
a bottle with a note in it.

163
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,155
- Would you believe me?
- Well, did you?

164
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,958
- Yes.
- And what did it say?

165
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,951
It said:

166
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,794
"Disregard first message."

167
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,590
Oh, I suppose you think
that's funny, don't you?

168
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,638
You've got your father,
so to you this is just a big joke.

169
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,915
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not making a joke of it.

170
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,639
- I'm just trying to show you.
- Please, do you mind?

171
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,280
- I'll make you an offer.
- What kind of an offer?

172
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,478
I don't necessarily believe this story
about the shark swallowing the bottle.

173
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,348
But I am getting a little fed up
with these infernal trips
to the Mediterranean.

174
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,316
Down, boy. Good old boy. I'll bring
you a bone or something later.

175
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,516
That's a good boy.

176
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,436
Oh, uh, <i>bonjour.</i>

177
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,435
In case you've emptied
your own pockets.

178
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,229
And just don't let any shark
get this away from you.

179
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,754
Thank you.

180
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,913
I assure you, mademoiselle,
your case shall be properly presented.

181
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,997
After all, Father,
suppose it was you cast away.

182
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,231
Do you think I would give up
if I had even the slightest clue?

183
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,279
I'd live up to all the legends
of Glenarvan. Persevere,
if I had to move heaven and earth.

184
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,113
- Why don't we try Corsica for a change?
- Father, will you listen to me?

185
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,749
- Haven't been there for years.
- Suppose you were a castaway
and you had a bottle.

186
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,991
You wouldn't just sit there
staring at it until you died
or something, would you?

187
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,116
You'd at least try
putting a note into it.

188
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,634
And suppose for some strange reason
it did get swallowed by a shark.

189
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,792
- Most unlikely, I'd say.
- Very well, then.

190
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,953
If you won't listen, I shall be getting
off at Plymouth with Mary and Robert.

191
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,713
- Oh, come, come, come, come.
- I feel very strongly about this,
Father.

192
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,598
My dear boy,
if that's the way you feel about it,
let's have a look at the blasted note.

193
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,478
- Where is it?
- In the bottle.
- Well, where's the bottle?

194
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,109
- The Frenchman has it.
- Confound it, where's the Frenchman?

195
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,239
- You had him thrown off
the ship in Glasgow.
- That's a fine thing.

196
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,311
When I really want something,
no one takes the slightest notice.

197
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,630
- If I happen to drop a casual remark...
- Casual remark?

198
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,950
"Throw him off the ship
before I call the police!

199
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,951
We ought to hang him
from the yardarm."

200
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,952
Now we're in a deuce of a fix.
That Frenchman might be anywhere by now.

201
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,749
Where's Captain Mangles?
Tell Captain Mangles to... Oh!

202
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,673
- <i>Oui,</i> milord?
- Good gracious, the Frenchman!

203
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,389
- I thought...
- Oh, but I give you my word,
I was put off the ship.

204
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,074
Fortunately, I do not let
such things upset me.

205
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,594
The note, milord.

206
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,069
Well, this is useless. There's
practically nothing of it left.

207
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,709
Ah, but with a little study,
a little intelligence...

208
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,109
it is possible
to make out what is said.

209
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,475
You will see one thing
w-without question.

210
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,348
Their location is given
as 37 degrees...

211
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,318
11 minutes, southern latitude.

212
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,836
That's no good
without the longitude.

213
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,152
Consider first, milord,
on the 37th parallel...

214
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,518
there are only a few places
they could be.

215
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,910
That's what I've always said.
If Captain Grant's anywhere at all,
he's in Australia.

216
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,037
It's only logical if you know
anything about shipping and commerce.

217
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,156
Use the head, milord.

218
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,152
The note makes reference
to being captured, no?

219
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,277
And you can make out the word
"Indian" or "Indians".

220
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,388
So where on the 37th parallel
would they be captured by Indians?

221
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,393
- Australia, of course!
- Aboriginals, yes. Indians, no.

222
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,392
By George! I've got it. South America.
Couldn't be anywhere else.

223
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,869
And if he was captured by Indians,
he'd be on the West Coast.

224
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,871
It's a matter
of simple logic, monsieur.

225
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,476
We'll go there and follow
the 37th parallel over the Andes...

226
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,471
until we find Captain Grant.

227
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,915
Osborne, find Captain Mangles!
Tell him I'm going to change course.

228
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,195
- Thank you, milord! Thank you!
- Oh!
- Now, just a minute.

229
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,510
Don't forget that
it was me who arranged...

230
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,114
- Thank you!
- Thank you, milord!
- Thank you, milord!

231
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,510
Oh, please!
I'm an Englishman, you know.

232
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,191
There, milord, is where we must go.
The pass of Antuco.

233
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,989
Then follow the parallel
until we find Captain Grant.

234
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,039
Ha, jolly good trick to throw
a bottle into the ocean
from up there, I must say.

235
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,556
Ah, but could he not put
the bottle into a river?

236
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,598
And would it not flow
down to the sea, eh?

237
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,430
No, no. <i>Grimpons.</i>

238
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,354
<i>- Grimpons.</i>
- That means "let's climb".

239
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,715
It is the French recipe
for the good life.

240
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,316
Whatever you want to do, don't be
afraid to do it for fear of failure.

241
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,349
<i>Don't be afraid</i>
<i>of the beautiful and high mountain</i>

242
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,116
<i>- Let's climb, let's climb</i>
<i>let's climb, let's climb, let's climb</i>
<i>- Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb</i>

243
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,149
<i>Don't be afraid of</i>
<i>the beautiful and high mountain</i>

244
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,233
<i>Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb</i>
<i>Let's climb, let's climb</i>

245
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,073
<i>And if we fall, crash, bang</i>

246
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,469
<i>And die a terrible death</i>

247
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,236
<i>Never mind, we've had thejoy</i>
<i>thejoy of the climb</i>

248
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,031
<i>Oh, don't be afraid of</i>
<i>the beautiful and high mountain</i>

249
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,829
<i>Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb</i>
<i>let's climb, let's climb</i>

250
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,709
<i>Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb</i>
<i>let's climb, let's climb</i>

251
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,755
<i>Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb</i>
<i>Let's climb, let's climb</i>

252
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,914
Oh, look! Look!
Straight down that valley there.

253
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,879
- Where?
- Do you see it, milord?

254
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,713
A river into which
one might throw a bottle.

255
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,031
- By Jove, yes!
- And an Indian village.

256
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,078
I'd say, this could be just the place,
couldn't it? Have a look, my dear.

257
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,835
Better make camp here tonight
and get an early start in the morning.

258
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,672
Hey, you, make camp.
Stay here tonight.

259
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,991
- No stay.
- Huh?

260
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,477
- What's the fellow talking about?
- Ah, it is not Spanish.

261
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,199
It must be a local Indian term.

262
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,875
Hey, hey, hey.
What means <i>trango peeray?</i>

263
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,075
Oh, l-l-l-l-I think
he-he wants to tell us...

264
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,038
it gets, uh,
terribly cold up here.

265
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,554
Oh, we build a fire,
no matter how cold.

266
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,350
No matter how <i>trango peeray,</i>
we stay in hut.

267
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,113
- No stay.
- Listen to me.

268
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,760
I tell you when to go
and when to stay.

269
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,879
- No stay.
- We stay here tonight!

270
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,919
- You stay. We go.
- Don't you dare to try and tell me!

271
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,149
I think the fellow
really means it.

272
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,912
Well, that's done it.
Without the horses, we're helpless.

273
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,709
- We'll never make it.
- Well, can't we still go on on foot?

274
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,360
But of course, mademoiselle.
The Araucanians have...

275
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,432
crossed these mountains on foot
for hundreds of years.

276
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,636
- Even drive their sheep.
- Oh, good!

277
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,632
- When do we start?
- We're not gonna start.

278
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,915
I'm not gonna go
leaping about like a...

279
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,275
like a confounded
mountain sheep, thank you.

280
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,638
- Oh, please, your lordship, please!
- No, no, mademoiselle. Uh, he's right.

281
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,349
Uh-Uh-Uh, we-we'll, uh, return
to the ship with the Indians...

282
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,750
and get some crewmen
who are younger.

283
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,913
- Age has got nothing
whatever to do with it.
- I'll take over
and lead the-the expedition.

284
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,037
You-You-You can remain
in your deck chair.

285
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,557
You lead the way? Ridiculous! Have
the whole lot of you lost in no time.

286
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,269
On the other hand,
with me in command...

287
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,718
it would take a great deal more than,
ha, <i>trango peeray</i> to turn us back.

288
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,436
- That's right, isn't it?
- Right, your lordship.

289
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,510
Monsieur Paganel, do you think
we might have one tonight?

290
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,072
When you are in the poultry yard, it is
a good time to wish you catch the egg.

291
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,152
See? Look at this. See?

292
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,791
Any slight tremor of the earth,
and it starts to swing.

293
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,519
But if you're asleep,
how could you tell?

294
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,354
Oh, maybe all night I sleep,
uh, with one eye open.

295
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,392
Perhaps his lordship
will sleep better...

296
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,233
if we do not tell him
before tomorrow...

297
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,199
what <i>trango peeray</i> means, eh?

298
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,515
Your pleasure, mademoiselle.

299
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,232
<i>Castaway, castaway</i>

300
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,995
<i>Trust in your star</i>

301
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,517
<i>You know I will find you</i>

302
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,798
<i>Wherever you are</i>

303
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,395
<i>Though all your dreams</i>

304
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,031
<i>May be tossed by the tide</i>

305
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,510
<i>Cling to your hopes</i>

306
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,559
<i>Never cast them aside</i>

307
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,912
<i>Castaway, castaway</i>

308
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,754
<i>Though you may be</i>

309
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,038
<i>Lost in the wilderness</i>

310
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,511
<i>Over the sea</i>

311
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,070
<i>I will discover</i>

312
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,278
<i>Your castaway shore</i>

313
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,555
<i>Then you'll</i>

314
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,758
<i>Be a castaway</i>

315
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,513
<i>No more</i>

316
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,511
<i>You'll be</i>

317
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,116
<i>A castaway</i>

318
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,159
<i>No more</i>

319
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,270
It's my father's favourite.

320
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,158
E-Ever since I was a little girl,
I've always thought it sad.

321
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,038
Not the way you sang it.

322
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,954
Oh, it's just the way I feel
tonight, I suppose.

323
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,237
Oh, it's all so exciting.

324
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,118
We're up here.

325
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,794
Father's down there.

326
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,031
The stars pointing the way.

327
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,078
It's almost like
being in heaven.

328
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,674
- I know.
- Ah, there you are, my boy.

329
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,910
Better get some sleep, you know.
Got an early start.

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,434
- We're too excited to sleep.
- Mm, so I see.

331
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,351
You'd better come along with me,
just the same.

332
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,358
Wait. I want to make a wish
on that star.

333
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,795
What could you wish for
that you haven't got?

334
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,838
That my father would go
somewhere and get lost.

335
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,514
Just for a little while,
you understand.

336
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,351
- What on earth are you doing?
- This is to wake me up.

337
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,273
- Wake you up?
- Yes, in case...

338
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,512
- In case what?
- Oh, nothing.

339
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,275
- And what is this, may I ask?
- My watch, milord.

340
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,272
Perhaps I want to look at it
during the night.

341
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,075
How very peculiar.

342
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,515
Oh, Robert, really.
Do put those things away.

343
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,797
But if there's an earthquake,
I want to be sure and see it.

344
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,996
Earthquake? Who said anything
about an earthquake?

345
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,834
Oh, I'm so stupid, milord.

346
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,798
I didn't realize it until later.

347
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,431
The Indian, when he did,
uh-uh-uh, that, you see?

348
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,750
He did not mean
it was cold. No.

349
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,197
He meant <i>trango peeray...</i>
earthquake!

350
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,593
- This is the land of many earthquakes.
- Gracious me.

351
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,638
In the whole world,
no place has such big...

352
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,475
such beautiful, such magnificent
earthquakes as right here.

353
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,475
But it is one chance in a million
we should be so fortunate.

354
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,238
Yes. Yes. Yes, of course.
Quite right.

355
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,278
Besides, this place looks as if
it's been here for hundreds of years.

356
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,750
Doesn't it?
I mean, uh, it's safe to assume...

357
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,229
that it will last
one more night, eh?

358
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,271
- <i>Oui,</i> monsieur?
- <i>Oui,</i> milord.

359
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,670
And I'll wake you up
if one comes, your lordship.

360
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,439
- It worked!
- Oh, Robert, do be quiet.

361
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,830
An earthquake
of the first magnitude.

362
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,629
I say, do you have
to shake the whole place?

363
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,917
By Jove, it's an earthquake!
Outside, everybody!

364
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,237
Oh! Oh, magnificent!

365
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,469
This is an experience that makes
our entire expedition worthwhile.

366
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,110
By Jove, that was
a narrow squeak! Oh!

367
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,070
I say, this is
getting rather dangerous.

368
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,312
Then we attempt to change course.
Everybody to port.

369
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,351
- It worked!
- That's better. Much obliged.

370
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,189
- Look out! Look out!
- This way, everybody, quick!

371
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,635
To the port, quick!

372
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,315
- What the... Port, quickly!
- No, starboard!

373
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,470
- Port, I say!
- Starboard!

374
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,913
Where are we going now?

375
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,670
- Perfect timing.
- Oh!

376
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,232
- Abandon ship!
- No! Wait!

377
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,039
- There's a hole in the ice!
- But we don't know where it goes.

378
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,350
We'll soon find out.

379
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,636
Alpine-type glacier.
Drift minimum.

380
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,951
We'll never get
out of here alive.

381
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,237
The ice melts and gets out.
Why can't we?

382
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,950
- Isn't it beautiful!
- Oh!

383
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,272
They'll never believe us
when we get home. If we get home.

384
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,158
Look out, everybody! Duck!

385
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,356
Where...
Where're we going now? Ooh.

386
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,391
Try starboard, I tell you!

387
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,236
- This is most peculiar.
- Look out!

388
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,675
- That was close.
- Oh!

389
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,991
Come on!

390
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,074
- Where's Robert?
- Here's his hat.

391
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,793
Robert! Robert,
can you hear me?

392
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,555
Not down there.
I'm up here.

393
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,555
Oh, a giant condor.
A <i>Sarcohamphus gryphus.</i>

394
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,393
Robert, hold on!

395
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,439
I don't have to.
She won't let go.

396
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,593
This is true. She will not let go
until she reaches her nest.

397
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,673
- Reaches her nest?
- Yes, high in the mountains.

398
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,354
No doubt she has
little ones that must...

399
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,874
Hang on, Robert.
We're coming!

400
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,879
- Robert!
- I got dizzy coming down...

401
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,474
but it was a jolly good view
from up there.

402
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,552
- Oh, thank goodness you're all right.
- I wonder who fired the shot.

403
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,393
Perhaps he did.

404
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,197
A Patagonian. Magnificent!

405
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,750
It's like turning back
the history book hundreds of years.

406
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,434
Hope he's not dangerous.

407
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,790
Permit me. l-I've learned
a few primitive words.

408
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,677
Anyway, even if you
don't understand...

409
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,150
l-I want to thank you for
saving my brother's life.

410
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,077
- Happy could do.
- Heavens, he speaks English.

411
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,948
First-class shooting, sir.
First time, right through the heart.

412
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,270
No. Shoot through heart...

413
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,239
bird go limp, drop small boy.

414
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,517
But shoot back of head...

415
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,515
bird go stiff, wings go up.

416
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,879
He circle down, land boy safe.

417
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,871
Y-You mean, you-you purposely...

418
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,635
i-induced motor paralysis
through damage on the medulla?

419
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,553
- Not understand.
- Neither do I.
- Can you tell us where our father is?

420
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,835
- He was captured by Indians.
- On the 37th parallel.

421
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,309
They were kidnapped,
washed up on the shore, captured.

422
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,433
Three white men.

423
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,114
Indians hold them
for ransom money.

424
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,351
- You very slow to come.
- Are they all right?

425
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,150
Last time I hear, they are well,
but very tired of being prisoners.

426
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,358
Just a minute. What do you mean,
"last time you hear"? Don't you come
from the village where they're held?

427
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,671
No. I'm an Araucanian chief,
Thalcave.

428
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,912
My people do not rob, do not steal,
do not hold prisoners for ransom.

429
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,755
- Well, where are they?
- Far away, at the foot of the mountain.

430
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,070
Great plain reaches
far as you can see.

431
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,312
- Many days to cross.
- The pampas.

432
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,597
Well, couldn't you take us there?

433
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,517
First we stop at my village
for horses and supplies...

434
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,637
then Thalcave will try
help you find them.

435
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,269
Much rain there.
You sleep in tree. May come flood.

436
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,557
Flood? By George,
that's a good one.

437
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,236
A giant ombu tree,
<i>Phytolacca dioica.</i>

438
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,279
- Magnificent specimen.
- Oh, please, may we sleep in it?

439
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,555
You can sleep where you like,
but I certainly don't intend to roost...

440
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,393
in a tree
like a confounded sparrow.

441
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,993
Pitch my tent just here.

442
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,072
You in tree, listen!

443
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,914
Flood come. Much water.
You stay in tree. I bring help.

444
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,151
- My father?
- I wake him.

445
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,233
To be safe, we tie things
so they do not fall.

446
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,596
Flood come. You go quick to tree.
I ride for help.

447
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,556
Not even raining.

448
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,550
Just like on a ship.
Make ready for the storm.

449
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,915
Look! The flood!

450
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,235
- Father! Father!
- John, be careful!

451
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,913
- Father, hurry up! Come with me!
- Now what's going on?

452
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,037
Can't a fellow get
a decent night's rest in this place?

453
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,873
- Come on, Father!
- Oh!

454
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,870
Come on.

455
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,434
They've got it!

456
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,870
Hold on!

457
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,349
Highly irregular, flood like this...
and not even raining.

458
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,555
With some food in your stomach, milord,
the world will feel a lot brighter.

459
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,314
- Oh! Look out below!
- Oh!

460
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,469
Sorry, milord.

461
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,075
<i>Why cry about bad weather</i>

462
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,469
<i>Enjoy it</i>

463
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,429
<i>Each moment is a treasure</i>
<i>enjoy it</i>

464
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,829
<i>We're travellers</i>
<i>on life's highway</i>

465
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,229
<i>Enjoy the trip</i>

466
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,880
<i>Each lovely twist and byway</i>

467
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,235
<i>Each bump and dip</i>

468
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,950
<i>If there's a complication</i>
<i>enjoy it</i>

469
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,830
<i>You've got imagination</i>
<i>employ it</i>

470
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,275
<i>Then you'll see roses</i>
<i>in the snow</i>

471
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,635
Joie de vivre
<i>will make them grow</i>

472
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,713
Voilà, <i>that's life</i>
<i>Enjoy it</i>

473
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,517
<i>Since I must do the cooking</i>
<i>I'll enjoy it</i>

474
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,592
<i>This ombu tree smells gorgeous</i>
<i>You'll enjoy it</i>

475
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,310
<i>A hurricane comes your way</i>
<i>enjoy the breeze</i>

476
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,110
<i>You're stranded in thejungle</i>
<i>enjoy the trees</i>

477
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,830
<i>If there's a complication</i>
<i>enjoy it</i>

478
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,755
<i>You've got imagination</i>
<i>employ it</i>

479
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,118
<i>This tree's a cornucopia</i>
<i>Why, it could be...</i>

480
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,399
<i>- Utopia</i>
- Voilà, <i>that's right, enjoy it</i>

481
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,829
<i>Why cry about bad weather</i>

482
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,388
<i>- Enjoy it</i>
<i>- No, enjoy</i>

483
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,109
<i>Oh, each moment is a treasure</i>
<i>Enjoy it</i>

484
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,318
- That's better. Enjoy it.
<i>- We're travellers on life's highway</i>

485
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,834
<i>Enjoy the trip</i>

486
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,152
<i>Each lovely twist and byway</i>
<i>each bump and dip</i>

487
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,993
- Good.
<i>- If there's a complication</i>

488
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,878
<i>- Enjoy it</i>
<i>- Enjoy it</i>

489
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,236
<i>You've got imagination,</i>
<i>employ it</i>

490
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,677
<i>Employ it</i>
<i>From eggs and herbs au naturel</i>

491
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,672
<i>Omelette ombu a la Paganel</i>

492
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,470
Pour vous, <i>milord</i>
<i>Enjoy it</i>

493
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,396
<i>Voilà!</i>

494
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,113
Robert, can you
see anything...

495
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,716
that looks like an Indian
on horseback coming to our rescue?

496
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,837
- Only some birds.
- Only some...

497
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,149
Only gone down
half an inch in two days.

498
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,710
We'll be here for ten years
at this rate.

499
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,439
Cheer up, milord.
We pay no rent.

500
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,875
Mother Nature
sets the table for us.

501
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,272
And, fortunately,
we have plenty of water.

502
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,635
That's very fortunate,
I must say.

503
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,353
- Very fortunate.
- My father will never
trust another Indian.

504
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,637
But Thalcave's different.
He said, "I bring help".

505
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,280
- And he will.
- If he got through.

506
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,476
Don't even think such things.

507
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,028
All right.
But if I may paraphrase...

508
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,556
what a wise young girl
once said to me many years ago:

509
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,551
"If you were marooned
in an ombu tree...

510
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,108
and you had some logs
and something to tie them into a raft...

511
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,670
you wouldn't just sit there
until you died or something, would you?"

512
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,149
That's very good.
For a girl, I mean.

513
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,590
I suppose most girls are taught
embroidery and things.

514
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,958
But Mother died after Robert was born.
And Father, being a sea captain...

515
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,998
When we first met,
I had a different impression.

516
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,595
Most girls can be rather silly.
Do you know what I mean?

517
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,912
- No, I don't.
- Well, you're different.

518
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,312
- How different?
- I don't know how to say it.

519
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,916
I had it all worked out last night.
Sounds rather silly now, though.

520
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,312
- What does?
- Well, you don't expect things
of a girl, certain things...

521
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,190
like climbing mountains, going
through floods, making the most of it.

522
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,510
You know what I mean?

523
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,711
Don't think I do.

524
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,917
Well, I want to say that...

525
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,949
I think you've been just fine,
for a girl.

526
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,511
Oh, what I really mean is that
if we get out of here alive...

527
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,319
and when we're old enough...

528
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,233
- John!
- Mary!

529
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,910
There's the log
you've needed for your raft.

530
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,629
That's it, just what we need.
Perfect!

531
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,991
Got it.

532
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,472
- Oh!
- Keep out of the way!

533
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,268
- It's a tiger!
- No, no, it's a jaguar. <i>Felis onca.</i>

534
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,351
Get that beast out of here!

535
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,837
It's probably as frightened
of us as we are of it.

536
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,798
- Just a big cat, milord.
- Well, get rid of it. Get rid of it.

537
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,553
Can't stand cats
at the best of times.

538
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,949
Confounded things
always make me sneeze.

539
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,270
Go on! Get out of here!

540
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,229
- Go on! Get out!
- Don't, John! The poor thing.

541
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,870
Do not move, not an eyelash.

542
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,671
"Marooned in ombu tree.
Latitude, 37 degrees south.

543
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,073
Longitude, 66 degrees west.
Send help immediately."

544
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,913
One, two...

545
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,596
three, four, five...

546
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,591
six, seven.

547
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,313
More than two kilometers away.

548
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,712
My father always told me,
never go near a tree in a thunderstorm.

549
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,315
One, two, three...

550
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,233
four, five.

551
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,311
I think it's getting closer.

552
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,391
Yes. At 35 degrees centigrade...

553
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,758
sound travels
at approximately... one...

554
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,838
Great heavens,
the tree's on fire. Look!

555
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,911
We'll beat it out.

556
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,554
No time for that sort of thing.
Get out of the way!

557
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,233
You see? It's too late now.

558
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,235
The oil in the ombu tree, milord,
it has a remarkably low flashpoint.

559
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,793
- Onto the raft. It's our only chance.
- Look out!

560
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,635
Oh, no!

561
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,632
- I'll get it.
- No, don't!

562
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,074
Apparently, we have our choice:
eaten raw down there...

563
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,038
or roasted alive up here.

564
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,838
Hold on, everybody. Mother Nature
comes to our rescue. A waterspout!

565
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,872
Ahoy!

566
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,994
Ahoy!

567
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,634
We're still several degrees
off course, you know.

568
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,598
Hurry up with the canvas.
There's a breeze coming up.

569
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,592
Aye, aye, Captain!

570
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,793
You're strangely quiet,
aren't you?

571
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,270
- Sorry, milord. I was thinking.
- I don't know which is worse, by George:

572
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,557
having you so happy you sing all the
time, or so glum you won't even talk.

573
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,076
"The ombu tree is gorgeous.
Enjoy it." Huh.

574
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,559
I am stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!

575
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,916
I know, but that hasn't
worried you till now.

576
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,675
- It is better they do not hear.
- Better they don't hear?
What are you talking about?

577
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,309
It is something
I remembered in the night.

578
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,598
- How could I be so stupid?
I don't know, but the shark I caught...
- Land ho!

579
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,319
with the bottle,
it was a mako shark.

580
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,311
- It...
- Ahoy!

581
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,554
And as well as I know anything
in the world, I should know that
the mako shark lives only in...

582
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,713
Be quiet! Ahoy there!

583
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,873
Ahoy. Ahoy there!

584
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,190
I think I see it. There.

585
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,552
- A canoe!
- Ahoy there! Aho...

586
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,629
Good heavens. It's an Indian war canoe.
This is a fine fix.
We're completely unarmed.

587
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,393
- It's Thalcave! He did come back!
- What? Thalca...

588
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,189
Ho-ho. Thalcave, my good man.
Delighted to see you.

589
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,829
- I bring news.
- News? What kind of news?

590
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,878
You come in canoe.
We go fast to village...

591
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,316
where they hold prisoners,
three sailor men.

592
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,076
Three sailor me...
Oh, monsieur, we've found them!

593
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,197
It's like a miracle.
Thank you, my lordship! Thank you!

594
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,831
Oh, I say, I say. Careful. Come along.
Let's get aboard. Careful, now. Careful.

595
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,833
You're a welcome sight, sir,
believe me. Is this thing safe?

596
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,115
Forty-six, forty-seven,
forty-eight...

597
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,350
forty-nine, fifty.

598
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,158
Oh, now it's come,
I can hardly believe it.

599
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,719
- We're saved!
- We're saved!

600
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,711
Stop it! Stop it! Who the devil
are these people? Where's Captain Grant?

601
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,519
These not right men?

602
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,310
It's all my fault.
How could I be so stupid?

603
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,393
It's what I started to tell you,
milord, about the mako shark.

604
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,350
- What about the blasted thing?
- It lives only in and
around the Indian Ocean.

605
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,955
That's what the-the word "Indian"
means in the note...

606
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,429
not that they were captured
by Indians.

607
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,718
If you knew this, why didn't you tell me
before I paid out all that money?

608
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,749
I kept hoping, milord,
that maybe somehow I could be wrong.

609
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,195
This can mean only one thing:

610
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,158
Captain Grant is in Australia.

611
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,231
Australia? That's where
I wanted to go in the first place...

612
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,039
only, I was stupid enough
to let you talk me out of it.

613
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,159
Oh, my dear children, I'm so sorry
it all had to end like this.

614
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,550
Listen! Thalcave speak.

615
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,632
For many years,
my people hunt...

616
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,393
trail game many miles.

617
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,237
Sometimes sneak up,
but game not there.

618
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,030
But Indian knows
if game not there...

619
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,874
it somewhere else.

620
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,318
Keep looking; otherwise,
Indian die out many years ago.

621
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,915
"Keep looking."
He's right, you know.

622
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,309
Now we know
where Captain Grant really is.

623
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,597
And by Jove,
we'll go and find him.

624
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,433
Oh, thank you, Thalcave.

625
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,511
Thank you.

626
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,230
- How does she look to you?
- Just what we need.

627
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,710
- Ain't a ship hereabouts
could overhaul her.
- What about the steam?

628
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,078
- We can learn.
- The old man wants to know
what happened to the <i>Britannia.</i>

629
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,038
- Maybe I should tell him.
- You're not serious, now, are ya?

630
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,156
Maybe I should tell him.

631
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,153
The very spot, your lordship,
where she sank beneath the waves.

632
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,356
Now, it's me own dear brother
who lost his life...

633
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,193
tryin' to put out in a small boat
to save some of the crew.

634
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,669
- It was shockin'.
- All right, Osborne. Pay 'em off.

635
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,149
- Very good, milord.
- Thank you, lordship.
Much... Much obliged.

636
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,993
- I don't wanna see any more.
- Very good, milord.

637
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,799
Look at that!
Ridiculous! Preposterous!

638
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,034
How can the same ship go down
in a dozen different places, sometimes
500 miles apart? Answer me that.

639
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,796
Ah, confounded wharf rats! Lie to you,
take your money, cut your throat
if you give 'em half a chance.

640
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,952
How the dickens can I tell
where to start, eh? What do you want?

641
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,237
- Mr Frederick Ayrton
to see you, milord.
- I told you I didn't want
to see anybody else.

642
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,029
- This is a gentleman, your lordship.
- I do hope I haven't arrived
at an awkward moment.

643
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,078
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
I would've warned you not
to offer a reward.

644
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,549
- Well, as a matter of...
- I'm afraid you'll find very little
integrity...

645
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,835
among some of the men
who frequent our waterfront.

646
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,674
And it so happens that
I have the very information you require.

647
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,799
- About my father?
- Ah, so this is the daughter
of Captain Grant.

648
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,555
Well, if I can reunite this delightful
child and her gallant father...

649
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,676
that is the reward I'm interested in.

650
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,830
Were you ever in Plymouth?

651
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,117
Plymouth, England?
No, I haven't had that pleasure.

652
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,668
May I inquire, sir, as to the nature
of your information?

653
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,276
Oh, well, two years ago,
I was caught in a violent storm
in the Tasman Sea.

654
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,750
We picked up a poor fellow,
badly battered and half drowned...

655
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,037
- just off the coast of New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

656
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,998
He said he was from the <i>Britannia,</i>
and that she'd gone down with all hands.

657
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,038
He died during the night, and our ship
combed the area the following day.

658
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,350
You know, until I read that piece
in the paper about the message...

659
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,000
in the bottle, I had no idea that
there were any survivors.

660
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,992
But why wasn't the sinking reported
when you reached your destination?

661
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,436
Well, I assumed that it was. I was only
a passenger on the ship, you know.

662
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,308
Heavens. If he landed in New Zealand,
he must've been captured by the Maoris.

663
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,755
I'll report this to the authorities
at once. Osborne!

664
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,673
- I'm afraid it isn't as easy as that.
- Why ever not?

665
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,036
You haven't had my experience
in dealing with our colonial government.

666
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,429
Eventually, you learn to get along
in spite of them.

667
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,399
They talk endlessly,
and they need authorization from London.

668
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,552
You'll be lucky
if they're ready in a year.

669
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,838
But anything could happen
to him in a year. What do you suggest?

670
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,992
Oh, l-I can't afford
to get mixed up in this.

671
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,119
I've told you all that I know, and...
and I've got my own estates to run.

672
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,317
Sir, the lives of three men
are at stake.

673
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,312
I'd like to speak
to this gentleman alone, please.

674
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,793
The trouble is,
New Zealand is not in the Indian Ocean.

675
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,314
There is something strange,
very strange.

676
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,789
I don't care what it is.
I've seen that man before.

677
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,678
- Oh, you're just imagining it.
- No, I'm not.

678
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,796
Anyway, I can't stand people
who look at me like that.

679
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,519
"Delightful child,
gallant father."

680
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,114
Perhaps it's a good sign that neither
of you take to him...

681
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,237
because it seems that everything else
that you've welcomed with open arms...

682
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,835
has turned out dead wrong.

683
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,394
Please understand I don't wish
to do anything against the law.

684
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,391
- Oh, certainly not.
- But at the same time, I don't intend...

685
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,313
to leave Captain Grant in the hands
of those bloodthirsty cannibals.

686
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,994
So, uh, I appeal
to you as a man with experience...

687
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,437
and knowledge of local conditions
to help us before it's too late.

688
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,750
All right. I'll gather up some men
who know the Maoris...

689
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,274
and who can
handle any kind of situation.

690
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,397
By Jove, you mean we just, uh, go in
and have it out with them?

691
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,278
Oh, good heavens, no. We'll
take along some supplies to barter...

692
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,352
and then if Captain Grant and his men
are still alive, we'll buy them back.

693
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,318
Capital idea. I can't tell you
how grateful I am to you.

694
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,518
- I need hardly remind you that we must
be discreet about what we plan to do.
- Ooh, of course, of course.

695
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,114
- Don't want to be tied down
by a lot of confounded red tape, do we?
- No.

696
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,512
Just my son John and Captain Mangles.
Otherwise, not a word to a soul.

697
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,511
Yes, just as it should be.

698
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,430
Get this crate down
in the hull, would ya, lads?

699
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,710
Motley looking lot of fellows
you've got together.

700
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,870
Well, when you look for men
to go into Maori country...

701
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,758
you don't choose them
from among the socially elite.

702
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,550
Jolly well put.
But I must say, I didn't realize
you'd require quite so much merchandise.

703
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:04,111
Ooh, I'm afraid the days are gone
when one could impress the natives
with a handful of coloured beads.

704
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,111
And if they choose
to sell their prisoners dearly...

705
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,555
we'd better be prepared.

706
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,677
I see.

707
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,668
John, you've got to tell me.
What's going on out there?

708
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,035
Ah, mademoiselle,
you are far too beautiful...

709
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,793
in the new gown to worry your
pretty little head about such things.

710
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,791
But what's in all those boxes?

711
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,509
I would've thought if my father wanted
you to know, he would've told you.

712
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,195
Every man out there looks like
a fugitive from the penal colony.

713
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,637
John, you've got to do something. Don't
let this man make a fool of your father.

714
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,877
Just because he calls you "a delightful
child" and you don't like it...

715
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,599
you think he's trying
to make a fool of my father.

716
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,958
It is better that we think it, monsieur,
than to give him the opportunity
to prove it.

717
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,349
All right. Let me tell you something,
both of you.

718
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,752
Maybe my father
huffs and puffs a little bit,
and we've all smiled at him just in fun.

719
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,196
But I don't think anybody's going to
make a fool of him quite as easily as...

720
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,750
well, certain people I could name.

721
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,149
And now, if you'll excuse me.

722
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,269
Patience, dear.

723
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,798
We shall see what we shall see.

724
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,717
I'll wager she's faster than any ship
in the Royal Navy.

725
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,268
Good. You know,
I'd say that...

726
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,272
steam was the coming thing if it
weren't all so complicated to handle.

727
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,430
Well, you don't have to complicate it.
Actually, it's quite simple.

728
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,795
- Yes?
- Pardon, milord. Uh-Uh, Could I talk...

729
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,553
to you sometime before too long?

730
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,156
- Certainly. What about?
- No matter how much I think about it,
it is always the same.

731
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,276
Captain Grant is in Australia.

732
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,033
There is no possible way the note
could mean he's in New Zealand.

733
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,509
Oh, my dear fellow,
don't worry about that beastly note.

734
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,353
Mr Ayrton knows precisely where
the <i>Britannia</i> went down, don't you?

735
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,238
- Of course.
- Milord, I'd be the happiest man...

736
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,029
in the world if it turns out
that once again, I'm wrong.

737
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,556
- I've no doubt you will be.
- If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to see the engine room.

738
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,790
Oh, my dear fellow, delighted.
Take you around myself.

739
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,111
I think you'll find
there's nothing complicated about steam.

740
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,794
It's a beautiful day. Why not enjoy it,
let bygones be bygones?

741
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,835
Now that we're at sea, I can let you in
on our secret, if you're interested.

742
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,674
Those boxes you were wondering about.
Would you like to know what's in them?

743
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,671
Trinkets. Trade goods.

744
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,911
They're for barter with the Maoris so
that we can buy your father's freedom.

745
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,355
- Who told you this?
- Mr Ayrton.

746
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,274
- And you believed him?
- All right, Miss Suspicious.

747
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,751
If it'll make you more companionable,
I'll take you below and show you.

748
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,554
Well, here you are.

749
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,676
All right, Pandora.
Which box do you want me to open?

750
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,753
- That one.
- You sure you don't
have a guilty feeling?

751
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,308
After all, it is rather
like spying on someone...

752
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,358
especially when they've gone
out of their way to be so nice to you.

753
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,318
- Open it.
- I will.

754
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,394
Nothing is too much trouble
if it satisfies your curiosity.

755
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,431
Voilà, mademoiselle.

756
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,631
"Trade goods. Trinkets", he said.

757
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,315
So that's his game. He's using
my father's ship as a gunrunner.

758
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,431
Pity you did that.

759
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,309
Wilcox, down here!

760
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,792
We've got to warn the others. I'll lead
them off, then you make for the door.

761
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,672
- There he is!
- I see him!

762
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,952
- Ooh! Oh!
- Now, is that a nice way to behave...

763
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,349
when we're taking you
to meet your father?

764
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,438
Come on.

765
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,354
Make no noise. Just stop the paddles.
Anything else, and I'll shoot.

766
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,235
Ever been to New Zealand before?

767
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,390
Yes. Twice.

768
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,631
Do as I tell you, and perhaps
you'll live to make it three times.

769
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,354
- We're stopping.
- That is most strange.

770
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,955
- Raise the hands quietly.
- Do as he says, Robert.

771
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,878
Help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan, help!

772
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,633
Come quickly!

773
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:55,317
Lord Glenarvan, help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan!

774
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,311
I thought
I heard the boy call for help.

775
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,791
You did. Now, give me that gun,
and no harm will come to him.

776
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,032
Wait.

777
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,312
I say, you can't put us out there
without oars. It's not human.

778
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,188
Oh, the current will carry you to
the shore, if that's any consolation...

779
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,078
but I'm afraid we'll have
to keep your crew on board...

780
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,958
until they've taught us the fine points
of using steam.

781
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,237
We're unaccustomed to such luxuries
in the South Pacific.

782
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,756
- You'll pay for this.
- You've got it backwards, old man.

783
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,709
We have been paid for it, and
quite handsomely. Cheer up, Frenchie.

784
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,995
You promised you would
be the happiest man in the world...

785
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,674
if you were wrong about Captain Grant
being in Australia.

786
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:49,357
And you were. Brown and Riley,
lay aloft and stand by to make sail.

787
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,193
- Aye, aye, sir.
- You were in Plymouth!

788
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,590
My father signed you
on the day he sailed.

789
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,035
As third mate. What a memory.

790
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,998
You'll hang for this, you know.
I'll see to it personally.

791
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,719
I'll make a full report
to the admiralty.

792
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,031
You do that.
And here's a bottle to put it in.

793
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,237
Let's hope it isn't swallowed
by a shark. Lower away!

794
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,675
You'll never get away with this.

795
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,149
That's what Captain Grant said
when we put him over the side...

796
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,995
at this very spot with
his two rather foolishly loyal mates.

797
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,834
If you're lucky, you might all end up
in the same stewpot.

798
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,914
If anyone is interested,
I might explain.

799
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,595
It is the influence
of the west wind drift...

800
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,878
playing against
the east Australian current...

801
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,509
that might drive us
right up onto the shore.

802
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,160
Yes, yes, yes.

803
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,636
That's the second
of my ships he's got.

804
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,474
First the <i>Britannia,</i>
and now my beautiful new steam yacht.

805
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,475
It's all clear now.
It was a mutiny.

806
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,192
There's no reason why I should lie about
it. My father was set adrift here...

807
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,396
Then he must be a prisoner
of the Maoris.

808
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,790
What did he mean, we might all end up
in the same stewpot?

809
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,156
Not to change the subject, but our
reception committee seems to be waiting.

810
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,759
Maoris, hundreds of'em.
Deuce of a fix.

811
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:41,436
No trinkets to bargain with.
What have we got to offer, huh?

812
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,114
Just us, I suppose.

813
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,997
- Good gracious!
- You come as a stranger,
and I take ye in.

814
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,675
I have prepared a place for thee
in the presence of thine enemy.

815
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,309
- It's all right, my dear.
I'm sure he's harmless.
- What think ye now?

816
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,995
I be crazy, eh?
Not a bit of it.

817
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:55,598
I be smart. Mark ye well
the words of old Bill Gaye.

818
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,152
Bill Gaye! Weren't you the mate
on my father's ship?

819
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,992
Depends entirely
who your father was.

820
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,119
What was his ship?
And who you be, for that matter?

821
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,272
You see, I be smart.

822
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,079
Makes a difference who she is.

823
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,709
I'm Mary Grant. My father's
Captain Grant of the <i>Britannia.</i>

824
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,712
Well, why didn't you say so before?

825
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,189
Fine ship, she was.

826
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,717
I walked her decks
across the seven seas.

827
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,873
Woe be onto thee, oh, Moab,
for thy sons are taken captive.

828
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,032
- Who is he?
- Fantastic, he seems to be the mate
from the <i>Britannia.</i>

829
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,271
Do you know where he is?
Can you tell me?

830
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,432
Where is Captain Grant?

831
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,671
Have you no eyes?
Can you not see?

832
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,877
- He's gone.
- Where?

833
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,918
Same as before. Diane's Inlet.

834
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,118
- Did the Maoris take him?
- He be smart too.

835
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:03,069
He learns the way to keep alive, for
they need him when they get more guns.

836
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,913
Guns? Then it must be Ayrton.

837
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,835
Aye, that's who it be.
Somehow the devil has got another ship.

838
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,754
- Were there three of you?
- Aye, three of us there were.

839
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,549
Captain Grant, McNabb
and old Bill Gaye...

840
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,518
against Ayrton
and all of his mutinous crew.

841
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,160
- The scoundrel!
- <i>Bonjour,</i> Monsieur.

842
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,552
My father, Captain Grant... Did he and
McNabb go together to Diane's Inlet?

843
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,598
Nay, my child.
I say unto you:

844
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,797
McNabb, he was not smart.

845
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,429
He was caught
when he tried to escape.

846
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,317
Odd devil.

847
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,036
- What's he laughing at?
- For this, child, I have prayed.

848
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,874
And the Lord has granted my petition,
which I asked of Him.

849
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,954
This is the night
the Lord hath given us our salvation.

850
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,510
What think ye? Could a man
force himself through there...

851
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,752
even a man who has gone without food
to make himself as thin as a man can be?

852
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,628
Nay. I say unto you,
it is impossible.

853
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,871
It is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle.

854
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,633
Robert, do you think you
could crawl through there?

855
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,280
Maybe if I tried very hard.

856
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,432
- You be smart too.
- Even if he could,
what good would it do?

857
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,514
I'll show ye now. The Lord helps them
that helps themselves.

858
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,913
Two years we took to make it,
from the hairs of our heads...

859
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,629
from the garments we wore,
from a thousand things we gathered.

860
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,030
Absolutely preposterous. What could
the boy possibly do all by himself?

861
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:53,115
There be more to it than that,
for this be the night of the haka.

862
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,796
Bide ye your time
till the night be well begun...

863
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:01,509
and the horns sound
and the flames leap upward...

864
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,549
and the devil hath
seized the souls of our captors.

865
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,076
Then I will show the way.

866
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,908
- Nobody's looking. Now's your chance.
- Right. Up you go. Up.

867
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,152
- It looks awfully small.
- Go on. Go on!

868
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,314
I'm stuck.

869
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,516
Let out all the air.

870
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,995
Pardon my soul, I don't know
which is worse: a crazy man...

871
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,913
who thinks he's smart
or a Frenchman who admits he's stupid.

872
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,192
- Hold that.
- Oh! Ooh-ooh!

873
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,192
Now, to get the pendulum swinging.

874
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,874
Oh, do be careful!

875
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,673
Lower away.

876
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:46,355
I have the unhappy feeling we're going
out of the frying pan into the fire.

877
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,749
He can't get over!
The rope's not long enough!

878
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,956
Lower away!

879
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,997
- He still can't do it.
- Go on! Lower away!

880
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,594
That's all there is!

881
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,477
Then let her go!

882
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,234
He did it!

883
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,716
Tie that down there.

884
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,509
Go down it.

885
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,312
Go. Bye.

886
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,317
- Deuce of a fix this is.
- Off we go to the mountain.

887
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,073
We'll never outrun these fellas.

888
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,549
By Jove, I never
saw a rope burn like that.

889
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,871
Gunpowder. It's woven in
like a fuse.

890
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:02,070
Aye, what say ye?
Who be'st smart now?

891
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,110
"Vengeance is mine.
I will repay", said the Lord.

892
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,119
Father, come on!

893
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:17,800
If this is the sacred volcano
of the taboo, they dare not follow.

894
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,474
You know of such things,
even though you be a stranger?

895
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,597
Aye. I be smart too.

896
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,798
Aye. We be two of a kind.

897
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,476
- By Jove, they've stopped.
- What think ye now of old Bill Gaye?

898
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,279
Be he crazy or be he smart?

899
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,148
They dare not set foot here,
for all this is taboo.

900
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,356
I say, that's splendid,
isn't it?

901
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,995
- But they're moving on again!
- A slight miscalculation, milord.

902
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,514
- I'm afraid we're on the wrong volcano.
- Just as I thought.

903
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,831
- Out of the frying pan, into the fire.
- Don't worry, milord.

904
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,709
Come help, please!

905
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,156
- What are you planning to do?
- Uncork the bottle
and let the genie free.

906
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,599
Oh, I've got it!
Everybody, push!

907
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,951
- Lucky shot, that. Chance in a million.
- At the university, milord...

908
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,316
I'm considered the wizard
of the croquet court.

909
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,518
Come ye, where we'll be safe.

910
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,557
- Oh, it's horrible!
- Have no fear, mademoiselle.

911
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,235
The Maoris can run faster
than the lava. Enjoy it!

912
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,596
And now, Mr Gaye,
to Captain Grant.

913
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,796
Aye, to Captain Grant!

914
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,355
Follow Bill Gaye!

915
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,193
He's got it all planned out!

916
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,035
All right, Grant.
Tell them there are six more boxes...

917
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,076
nearly 200 rifles
still in the hold.

918
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:52,277
I'll send the whole lot ashore
as soon as they hand over the money.

919
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,158
And how do I know the rest
are as good as this one?

920
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,516
- I give you my word.
- That's what you offered last time...

921
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,591
when you unloaded a pile of junk.

922
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,752
Now, really, Grant.
Every time I do something charitable,
I live to regret it.

923
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,354
Like putting you ashore alive.

924
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:14,991
And I intend to stay alive by not
recommending rifles I haven't examined.

925
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,752
My beautiful, beautiful yacht.

926
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,876
If they've done anything
to damage her...

927
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,669
I'll have them strung up
by their thumbs.

928
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,991
How did you know
where she was going to be?

929
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,878
This be where
they always unload:

930
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,713
in Diane's Inlet.

931
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,031
In Diane's Inlet? Oh!

932
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,357
In the note, what I thought said
"Indian" was really...

933
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,596
Oh!

934
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:57,310
I'm stupid, stupid, stupid!

935
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:02,679
Cheer up, my friend. Your stupidity may
turn out to be of divine inspiration.

936
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,835
Mr Gaye, I thought
we were going to find Father?

937
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,993
We be. We be. Look ye now.

938
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,431
It's Father!

939
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,557
He looks well, thank goodness.

940
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,189
- They're all getting into boats.
- They're comin' here.

941
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,192
We have but little time
to prepare our reception.

942
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,155
- I come to see thy ship.
- No one can come aboard.

943
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,119
Surely ye be not afraid
of old Bill Gaye?

944
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:12,479
- Bill Gaye?
- "The hoary head is a crown of glory."

945
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,199
Know ye not that?

946
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,238
- How many do you want, Lucky?
- That'll do.

947
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,357
How many cards do you want?

948
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,069
- So where's mine?
- I gave you them.

949
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,355
What a hand here. Right.

950
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:43,511
How do we get past him?

951
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,117
Excuse me, sir,
but is this Lord Glenarvan's yacht?

952
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,760
Well, sonny, I guess...

953
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,594
Here. Wait a minute. Ain't you the boy
that's with that lot? Come back here!

954
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,272
- Your lordship.
- We haven't got the keys, Captain.
We'll have to break the door down
best we can.

955
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,555
- Put out your decks, gentlemen.
- I'm busted.

956
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,676
- See if Thompson'll play.
He's got money.
- Yeah. All right.

957
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,671
- Your deal, Bob.
- Right. Here you are.

958
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,069
Riley, come here quick!

959
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,232
- The brig!
- The brig!

960
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,151
Know ye not what the Good Book says? "He
that diggeth a pit shall fall into it"?

961
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,112
Send him over to me.

962
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,238
Ooh, got him! Quick.

963
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,791
I suppose we'll have to open every box.
Put the best ones on top.

964
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,792
Ayrton, you scoundrel!

965
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,668
Don't move. You may
live long enough to hang.

966
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,675
Hello, Glenarvan.
Welcome aboard.

967
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:12,036
Well, here we are.
This makes us even, doesn't it, uh?

968
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,588
You've got your ship back,
and I'm bringing you Captain Grant...

969
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,591
so, uh, why don't we, uh...

970
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,911
Captain, take him below
with the rest of the scoundrels.

971
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,199
Aye, ye've sown the wind...

972
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,192
and I say to you,
you shall reap the whirlwind.

973
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,994
Back, you dogs! Back, I say!

974
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,916
Bill Gaye! What on earth...

975
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,039
- Father!
- Mary! Robert!

976
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,795
You think I be crazy, don't ye?

977
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,917
See now,
how are the mighty fallen.

978
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,595
- How on earth did you find me out here?
- Monsieur Paganel.

979
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,797
- He's a French professor.
- He found a note in a bottle.
- Lord Glenarvan took us on his yacht.

980
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,996
- And we've been all around the world
looking for you.
- South America.

981
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,674
- And we were captured by Maoris.
- Maoris!

982
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,600
My dear children.

983
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,150
Oh, how I've prayed
for this day.

984
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:34,630
- I was beginning to give up hope
that I'd ever see you again.
- I must be catching a cold.

985
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:39,999
And now you're suddenly here, and I'm
able to hold you both close in my arms.

986
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,877
I can't find words to
express my gratitude to all of you.

987
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,953
We would've been here months earlier if
I hadn't been so stupid about the note.

988
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,838
- The note?
- Yes. The-The note in-in the bottle.

989
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,036
The note in the bottle?

990
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,948
What think ye now? It was I
put that note in the bottle.

991
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,709
And put the bottle in the sea.
"Cast thy bread on the waters...

992
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,109
for thou shall find it
after many days."

993
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,636
But they seemed so sure
it was their father's handwriting.

994
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:19,508
- It was, wasn't it?
- Now you know my secret...

995
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,273
why I ran away to sea.

996
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,636
The voice is the voice
of a God-fearing man...

997
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,554
but the hands
are the hands of a forger.

998
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:42,030
- Oh, my word!
- Bill, you scoundrel!

999
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,908
Just think. If he hadn't
put the note in the bottle...

1000
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,956
and if Monsieur Paganel
hadn't caught that shark...

1001
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,476
And if you hadn't tried to slap my face
that morning on the way to Plymouth...

1002
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,074
I wouldn't have talked my father
into making this trip.

1003
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:00,631
- Funny how things work out, isn't it?
- Isn't it?

1004
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,270
Here we are, all of us together.

1005
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,555
All of us.

1006
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,719
Did you ever see so many stars?

1007
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,917
Once, on top of a mountain.

1008
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,312
Did you know that down there, out of the
light, you can see the Southern Cross?

1009
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,550
Southern Cross?

1010
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:31,319
So, that's my little girl.

1011
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,516
By george, they do grow up.

1012
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,672
Uh-Uh, I was just thinking
to myself.

1013
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,399
No matter
where you are in the world...

1014
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:46,075
it is always different,
but it is always the same.

1015
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,674
In English, you would say...

1016
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,878
"All climates
are the same for love."

1017
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,957
There it is.
The Southern Cross.
