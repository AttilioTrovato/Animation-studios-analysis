1
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,420
Liftoff!

2
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,390
Go, man.

3
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,192
Go, man... go.

4
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,384
You're doing fine, Charlie...

5
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,285
just fine.

6
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,724
That's it.

7
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,327
Just hang on up there, Charlie.
Keep up the good work.

8
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,115
Heart's still strong,

9
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,583
pulse rather fast,

10
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,585
respiration rapid...

11
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:00,853
otherwise, normal.

12
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,495
Slowed up a bit
mentally, general.

13
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,131
Probably a little swacked.

14
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,599
I wish<i> I</i> were.

15
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,524
Joe, give me an alert when
the wire radar picks him up.

16
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,192
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,860
Gulou, this is mcchord.

18
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,530
Give me an e.T. On acquisition.

19
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,231
Thank you, major.

20
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,401
Congratulations, general,
congratulations.

21
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,503
Thank you.

22
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,272
Mr. Secretary,

23
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,541
this is a great day
for your air force...

24
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:56,875
a great day.

25
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,810
Where is he? Still on the moon?

26
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,547
Not<i> on</i> the moon, senator...
<i>around</i> the moon.

27
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,814
What's the difference?

28
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,349
It's a space-race victory.

29
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,884
Not yet.

30
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,953
Orbiting the moon is one thing.

31
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,721
Getting him back alive
is another.

32
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,390
Of course, of course.

33
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,358
But he's all right, isn't he?

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,194
Sure.

35
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,863
He's a little bit
hypoxied, that's all.

36
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:18,664
What?

37
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,599
Stoned...

38
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,602
drunk as a skunk.

39
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,673
Did he say "drunk"?

40
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,274
He means "space drunk"...

41
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,677
a combination of isolation,
oxygen, and fear.

42
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,214
Haven't you read our booklet...
"simple science for senators"?

43
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,283
I didn't have time.

44
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,885
Besides, my kid said
it was juvenile.

45
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,956
Hawaii has acquired him, sir.

46
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,390
Get me hickum.

47
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,758
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:53,799
Any time you're set, Joe.

49
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,268
W-why's everybody so nervous?

50
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,370
Starfire just completed
the third moon orbit.

51
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,805
Oh.

52
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,940
They're about
to shoot him down.

53
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,408
<i>Shoot</i> him?

54
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,943
Space jargon, senator.

55
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,279
I wish you fellas
would be more careful

56
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,281
with that kind of language.

57
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,950
Words like "drunk"...
can't you see the headlines...

58
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,952
"billion-dollar space bender"?

59
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,420
And in an election year.

60
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,256
Ready, general.

61
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,658
Bring him in.

62
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,427
Start re-entry procedure.

63
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,698
Man: On my mark, it will be
"t" minus five seconds.

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,634
Go.

65
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,646
What happened?

66
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:44,283
Engine restart successful.

67
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,817
I'll tell the press.

68
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,920
He's not home yet...
just rounding third,

69
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,491
and home plate is a few
hundred thousand Miles away.

70
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,692
Hickum, sir.

71
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,560
Vanneman speaking.

72
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,829
Charlie's on his way home.

73
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,967
Turn it over
to the recovery group.

74
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,305
From here on in,
it's up to them.

75
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,908
Good luck, Charlie.

76
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,088
It's coming in fast now,
fellas...

77
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,823
any second now.

78
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,998
Man: There he is... 12:00 high!

79
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,050
Careful, sir!

80
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,785
Give me that leash!

81
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,025
We lose a lot of
visiting firemen that way.

82
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,426
Are you all right?

83
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,894
Yeah. Thanks.

84
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,436
Pilot to crew chief...
get ready, fellas.

85
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,976
Here she comes!

86
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,650
We got it!

87
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,456
Recovery, sir.

88
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,858
Yee-haw!

89
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,693
Ha ha ho!

90
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,462
Well, reel him in
as soon as you can!

91
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,530
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,099
Pull her in!

93
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,070
Hickum control,
this is recovery five.

94
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,105
Starfire picked up.

95
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,409
Air recovery successful.
They're bringing him in now.

96
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,981
What about Charlie?
Is he still alive?

97
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,949
They'll know soon.

98
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,818
Man: Bring it straight back.

99
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,987
Straight back! Straight back!

100
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,957
Easy... easy, now!

101
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,060
That's enough!

102
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,971
Easy.

103
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,808
Crew chief to pilot...
the hatch is off, sir.

104
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,509
Soon as you find out,
let me know.

105
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,777
How is he?

106
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,546
He's alive!

107
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,648
Yeah hoo hoo hoo!

108
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,950
Hurry up... bring him out.

109
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,853
Hey, Charlie boy, how are you?!

110
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,189
Oh, man, it's good to see you.

111
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,634
Gentlemen...

112
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,141
Gentlemen,
we're gathered here tonight

113
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,109
for a double purpose...

114
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:02,113
to honor our friend and mascot,
airman Charlie...

115
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,150
first chimpanzee
to orbit the moon.

116
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,723
Charlie, you put us
on the threshold.

117
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,725
On the threshold of what?

118
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,095
A man around the moon.

119
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,597
Now, just a minute.

120
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,866
We were under the impression...

121
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,268
if a chimpanzee can survive,
so can a man.

122
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,605
After all, there's practically
no difference between them.

123
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,673
Oh, no?

124
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,177
Do chimpanzees have the vote
in<i> your</i> state, general?

125
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,248
Senator, sometimes I wonder.

126
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,753
As I was saying, gentlemen,

127
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,689
we stand ready
for the big jump.

128
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,691
The only question is...

129
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,528
Who's going to be
the lucky man?

130
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,732
Now, I know you're all
fully qualified,

131
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,967
but I can't make a choice

132
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,738
without letting myself open
for a charge of favoritism.

133
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,873
Therefore,
I'll ask for a volunteer.

134
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,544
General...

135
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,746
A point of information, sir...

136
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,081
is this shot still scheduled
for next march?

137
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,683
Changed...

138
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,885
we have
till the end of this week

139
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,154
to catch the moon in its
present proximity to earth.

140
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,123
Otherwise, we have to wait
three months.

141
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,291
This week, sir?

142
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:20,992
Right.

143
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,628
Now, that's a tough decision
on short notice.

144
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,697
But Washington...

145
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,666
Washington wants
its answer tonight.

146
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,201
We're not the only nation
shooting for the moon.

147
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,603
Now, then...

148
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,639
Who's it gonna be?

149
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,113
You have any doubts,

150
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,583
just take heart from
our friend Charlie here.

151
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,885
How is it up there,
Charlie boy... fun, huh?

152
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:47,852
Pbbbt!

153
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,154
Pbbbt!

154
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,359
Sorry, sir.

155
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,961
What's the matter with you?

156
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,862
Gentlemen...

157
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,966
I'd welcome a show of hands.

158
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,024
As I said before,
we're not pressuring anyone.

159
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,195
Take your time!

160
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,900
Hah!

161
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,735
There's my man.

162
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,071
That's him, senator.

163
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,445
Congratulations, boy.

164
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,913
Congratulations.

165
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,048
Very nice.

166
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,386
Frankly, gentlemen,

167
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,722
captain Talbot
was my personal choice

168
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,023
right from the beginning.

169
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,892
Excuse me... thank you, sir.

170
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,695
He's young, unmarried,
physically fit,

171
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,164
specially trained
in bioastronautics,

172
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,899
with a fine future.

173
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,902
In short, gentlemen...
perfect for the mission.

174
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,705
Captain, what state
are you from?

175
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,772
Yours, sir.

176
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,974
That's what I was afraid of.

177
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,110
Well, we best get going.

178
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,714
We got a great deal to do,
and only a couple of days.

179
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,049
That won't give me
much of a leave.

180
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,317
No, I suggest that...

181
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,419
what was that?

182
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,922
I said, that won't give me
much of a leave, will it, sir?

183
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,290
Leave for you is out.

184
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,292
But...

185
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,761
no one sets foot off this base
until you're in that bird

186
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,396
and on your way to the moon.

187
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,764
But, general...

188
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,165
even I have to stay here.

189
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,034
But, sir, you see...

190
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,403
no one outside this base knows
except the president.

191
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,171
But, sir, the only...

192
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,440
there's no time for
personal interest, captain.

193
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,142
We can't risk a failure.

194
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,977
Secretary: Not a public one,
at any rate.

195
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,313
Not in an election year.

196
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,015
We're not going to yell
for the whole world to watch

197
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,184
and then fall
flat on our faces.

198
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,319
No.

199
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,989
General,
I wouldn't tell anyone.

200
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,190
Gentlemen.

201
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,332
Try to understand, captain,
leave for you is out.

202
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,400
All I want to do is go home!

203
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,040
Do you have a mother, captain?

204
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,843
Well, yes, of course
I've got a mother.

205
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,879
That's why I want to go home.

206
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,414
Now, uh,
you wouldn't want to worry

207
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,316
your mother, would you?

208
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,786
Oh, I wouldn't tell her
a thing.

209
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,320
You wouldn't confide

210
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,790
in your own dear, sweet mother?

211
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,191
Not in a case like this.

212
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,560
You think I want
to scare her to death?

213
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,028
She'd worm it out of you.

214
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,830
I know mothers. I had one.

215
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,466
They're all psychic.

216
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,901
Oh, not mine.

217
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,903
She believes
anything I tell her.

218
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,905
You're not going to be
difficult, are you?

219
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,074
Yes, sir.

220
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,343
Is this an ultimatum?

221
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,512
Yes, sir.

222
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:38,049
You won't ride in the bird
unless we let you go home?

223
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,118
That's about the size
of it, sir.

224
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,989
I guess maybe now you'll be
wanting somebody else?

225
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,927
I've already informed
the white house.

226
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,529
Senator: John,
you've got to let him go.

227
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,331
If it ever got out

228
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,334
that we shot this fine
American boy around the moon

229
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,337
without letting him
say goodbye to his mom...

230
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,471
Oh...

231
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,207
If I can, sir,

232
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,609
I'd like to get started
first thing in the morning.

233
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,945
It will take me
a day each way by bus...

234
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,479
bus!!

235
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,416
Did you say "bus"?

236
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:15,053
Well, actually, sir...

237
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,156
I don't really care
that much about flying.

238
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,261
You don't care much abou...

239
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,397
and you're going to take
a trip around the<i> moon?</i>

240
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,066
Never mind!

241
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,069
He volunteered, senator!

242
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,304
You<i> did</i> volunteer,

243
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,440
didn't you?

244
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,343
Well, you see, sir...

245
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,012
Yeah. Yes, sir.

246
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,621
All right, Talbot, you can go.

247
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,957
You mean I'm... Replaced, sir?

248
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,293
No... you have
three days' leave!!

249
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,628
Oh.

250
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,429
Oh! Well, thank you, sir.

251
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,331
Senator, thank you.

252
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,268
Mr. Secretary,
I knew you'd understand.

253
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,369
Ha!

254
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,290
Hey, Charlie.

255
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,058
Hey, listen...

256
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,360
how did it feel up there, huh?

257
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:33,097
What was the worst part...
the blastoff, the going up,

258
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,966
or the coming down?

259
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,101
Oh, boy, Charlie,
I sure would give more

260
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,203
than a penny for
<i>your</i> thoughts right now.

261
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,078
If you could only give me
some idea, some sign.

262
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,279
Aw, charli...

263
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,716
Charlie!

264
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,551
What did you do that for?

265
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,525
Ch...

266
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,328
Charlie!

267
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,595
Now, Charlie.

268
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,097
Come on, now, Charlie.

269
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,565
Charlie, put that down.

270
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,135
Hey! Charlie!

271
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,768
Crazy?! How can you tell
when a chimp's crazy?

272
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,236
Aren't they all?

273
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,305
Oh, no, sir. He's changed.

274
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,508
Charlie was friendly,
and now he's mean and wild.

275
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,110
Wild!

276
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,246
I tell you, sir,
he got moonstruck up there.

277
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,615
You know...
luna... moon... lunatic.

278
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,350
Ha!

279
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,053
Frankly, sir, I wouldn't
want that to happen to me.

280
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,723
W-would you, sir?

281
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,026
Will you sit down, captain?

282
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,428
I can understand
your natural anxieties,

283
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,497
but I can be
a lot more objective.

284
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,500
You've supervised all
of Charlie's flight reactions.

285
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,036
Now, what was his conduct
at that time?

286
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,438
He was right out
of the jungle then, sir.

287
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,573
And wild...
like he is now, hmm?

288
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,376
Then you put him through
the old air force basic...

289
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,245
discipline,
regular habits, huh?

290
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,747
Turned him into
an a-number-one astro chimp?

291
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,749
You might say, sir...
that's it.

292
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,118
Charlie's not loony.
He's overtrained.

293
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,521
That flight to the moon
brought him back normal.

294
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,656
The same thing's
gonna happen to you.

295
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,458
You've been working too hard.

296
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,060
You need to get away,

297
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,163
rid yourself of these
anxieties, tensions.

298
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,099
I envy you, boy, you know that?

299
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,069
Sir?

300
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:55,473
If they'd let me do it,
I'd fly in that bird myself.

301
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,375
Now...

302
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,178
I've got your round-trip
air routing in San Francisco.

303
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,646
There you are.

304
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,515
I'll give you a few orders
and instructions

305
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,250
before you leave, however.

306
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,226
When you climb in that capsule,

307
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,462
you're going to be
in tiptop shape.

308
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,464
From this minute on,
you're not to touch

309
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,599
tobacco, alcohol,
or stimulants of any kind.

310
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,134
Questions, captain?

311
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,669
No, sir. Major.

312
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,238
You will eat
nothing else than this.

313
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,242
It is a highly concentrated,
nourishing paste...

314
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,879
the same thing that will
sustain you in outer space.

315
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,481
Couldn't this have waited?

316
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,382
After all,
my mother's a good cook.

317
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,618
Your stomach must be
pre-shrunk, captain.

318
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,254
Your system must have time
to get adjusted.

319
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,857
Mind, now...
no food of any kind...

320
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,792
not even a teeny-weeny bite.

321
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,194
Gen. Vanneman:
Any more questions?

322
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,329
No, sir.

323
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,597
Captain.

324
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,866
You body and brain, sir,

325
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:58,336
need absolute calm
for the ordeal ahead.

326
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,204
So there must be no...

327
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,273
pardon me, captain.

328
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,542
Major... Would you mind?

329
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,650
Thank you.

330
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,354
As I was saying...

331
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,327
You need absolute calm
for the ordeal ahead,

332
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,663
so there must be no emotional
upsets or involvements.

333
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,899
I'm not sure I follow you.

334
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,934
What he means is no dames.

335
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,404
Oh... That.

336
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,805
Exactly.

337
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,208
Well, you don't have to worry.

338
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,810
I don't have a real
steady girlfriend anyway.

339
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,280
Don't have
an<i> unsteady</i> one either.

340
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,648
Understand?

341
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,249
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,285
Good. One thing more,
and remember it...

343
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,920
don't talk to strangers.

344
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,789
Types like Uncle Willy
and aunt bessie can be spies.

345
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,925
The enemy never sleeps!

346
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:54,926
Yes, sir.

347
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,265
Good luck, rich.

348
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,668
Enjoy yourself.

349
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,803
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir...

350
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,205
But how?

351
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,349
Sandwich?

352
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,886
Coffee, tea, or milk, sir?

353
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,489
No... Thanks.

354
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,529
Sir, would you care
for a sandwich?

355
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,932
My stomach
just isn't air-minded.

356
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,248
Would you care to try
one of these?

357
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,350
It will make you feel better.

358
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,386
Please... you look to me pale.

359
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:59,023
It won't help. It never does.

360
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,892
This will.
It's never been known to fail.

361
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:05,896
An infallible cure?

362
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,665
That'll be the day.

363
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,935
You must not be
so professionally cynical.

364
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,671
Professionally?

365
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,548
Thank you.

366
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,485
Oh, please, keep them.

367
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,321
You may need them again.

368
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,557
Gen. Vanneman:
<i>Don't talk to strangers.</i>

369
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,492
<i>They might be foreign spies.</i>

370
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,707
No... uh... What's her name?

371
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,974
Her?

372
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,444
Yeah... the girl in the seat
across from me.

373
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,978
Against regulations.

374
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,413
This is urgent.

375
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:30,915
I think I've been poi...

376
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,116
I'd rather not say.

377
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,851
4-a...

378
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,087
Name's lyrae.

379
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,788
Lyrae?

380
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,890
L-y-r-a-e.

381
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,560
Lyrae what?

382
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,829
Just lyrae. That's all.

383
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,364
Oh?

384
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,032
Does it say where she's from?

385
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,367
No.

386
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,835
Is she alone?

387
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,838
Not anymore, she isn't,
apparently.

388
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,439
Oh, no, no, no, no.

389
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,708
This isn't what you think,
believe me.

390
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,710
I wouldn't have
the slightest interest.

391
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,947
Huh. Well, give me
your honest opinion...

392
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,915
how does she strike you?

393
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,985
Does she seem
a little, uh... Unusual?

394
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:11,389
Well, frankly,
she looks like a beat.

395
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,990
Beat?

396
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:16,127
A beatnik... oddball...
unsquare... you know.

397
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:20,731
Oh... A beatnik.

398
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,770
Sir, are you sure

399
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:28,973
you couldn't use
a cup of coffee?

400
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:31,842
Oh, no, thanks. I feel fine.

401
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,444
Hey, I do.

402
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,845
I really do!

403
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,181
That pill must have worked!

404
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,049
Pill?

405
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:42,787
Yeah. I feel just fine now,
and, uh, thanks.

406
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,131
<i>Hmm...</i>

407
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:58,169
<i>I wonder where she is from.</i>

408
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,537
Why?

409
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,705
Why, becau...

410
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,073
huh?

411
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,209
Why do you wish to know
where I am from?

412
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,711
I didn't say a word.

413
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,847
Oh, excuse me.
I thought you did.

414
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,982
I must talk to you, captain.

415
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,784
Fasten your seatbelt, sir.

416
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,553
Return to your seat.

417
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:18,189
We'll be landing
in just a few minutes.

418
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:26,063
<i>Captain? How did she know?</i>

419
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:41,579
Gen. Vanneman:
<i>Remember, Talbot...</i>

420
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,647
<i>the enemy never sleeps...</i>

421
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,115
<i>Sleeps... Sleeps.</i>

422
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,230
Woman:<i> All incoming passengers,</i>

423
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,867
<i>please claim your baggage</i>
<i>at the street entrance.</i>

424
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,075
Hey, Walt!

425
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,520
Hiya, rich.

426
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,154
How are you?

427
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,897
Hello!

428
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:38,736
Come on. Let's get out of here.

429
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:42,273
Please, captain,
you must listen to me!

430
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,608
Keep on going.

431
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,744
Ohh!

432
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,279
Hey, what's this?

433
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:50,614
You trying to shake
a little sky-side romance?

434
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,283
You just drive.

435
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:55,553
Is that<i> all</i> you air force guys
have on your minds?

436
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,222
Never mind, little brother.
Hey, what's new with you?

437
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,158
You are addressing the new
assistant second foreman

438
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,960
of Daisy fresh frozen foods.

439
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:06,196
Ha ha! Still the same old
go-getter, huh?

440
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,999
I'm gonna<i> own</i> that company
in 30 years.

441
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,735
I should live so long...
I hope.

442
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,605
Hey... If I work a few angles,

443
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,674
maybe I can get you
a place at Daisy fresh.

444
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:20,144
Thanks, but I think
the offer's a little late.

445
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:22,813
Not to change the subject,
Walt, but, uh...

446
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,882
Hey, what are you doing
tonight?

447
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:27,084
I got a date.
Want me to fix you up?

448
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:30,988
Forget it.

449
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,357
I'll spend the evening
with mom.

450
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,877
Mom! Richie!

451
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,746
Hi, mom! How are you?

452
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:59,083
Richie, darling, why didn't
you let me know earlier?

453
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,884
It was all kind of sudden.

454
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,853
I could've delayed dinner.

455
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,722
Well, don't worry about it.

456
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,023
I'm on a diet, anyway.

457
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,625
A diet?

458
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,860
Oh, and you're so thin
and peaked.

459
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,095
Same old mom.

460
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,964
I'm so glad you're back,
Richie.

461
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,100
I've been waiting for you.

462
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,770
Oh, Richie.

463
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,041
Hey, how about my best girl

464
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,276
taking in a show
with me tonight?

465
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,713
Oh, I'd love to, Richie.
That's a wonderful idea.

466
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,148
Oh...

467
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,950
Oh, I forgot...

468
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:35,085
it's Wednesday,
and my bridge club

469
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,154
always meets
on Wednesday night.

470
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,023
Oh.

471
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:42,259
So it does.

472
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,028
I am sorry,

473
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,764
but when you surprise
people like this...

474
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:49,133
your stuff's upstairs, rich.

475
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:52,236
Look, I've got to hurry.
I'm gonna be late, okay?

476
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,437
Hey, Walt...

477
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,305
see you tomorrow morning!

478
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,317
Psst!

479
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,086
Mom!

480
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,421
Oh!

481
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,890
Oh, Richie, darling, come in!

482
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,096
You... you girls all know
my son Richmond, don't you?

483
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,998
Hello.

484
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,433
Yes, dear?

485
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:25,903
Mom, I think I'll stroll
around the old neighborhood

486
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,971
and take a LA... take a look.

487
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,040
Go right ahead,
but don't be too late.

488
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:36,046
See you later, mom.

489
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,749
Woman: Celia, please.

490
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,284
All right.

491
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,119
Uh, 2, spades.

492
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,051
Whew...

493
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,954
oh, boy, that's
a long, long way from home.

494
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,381
Woman: Captain!

495
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,451
How did you...

496
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,453
what are you doing here?

497
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,054
I came to warn you.

498
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,157
To warn me? About what?

499
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,793
About what your air force
is planning to do with you.

500
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,928
Air force? E... pi...

501
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,899
Oh, you must have me
mixed up with somebody else.

502
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,801
No, captain Talbot.

503
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:07,070
They intend to send you
around the moon in a rocket.

504
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:10,007
How do you know th...
I mean, no, they're not!

505
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,476
There is no reason
to be alarmed.

506
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,911
Now, see here.

507
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,980
I don't know
what you're talking about.

508
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,583
Your people have left out
a very important element.

509
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,585
If you ever expect
to get back...

510
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:24,454
I don't even know you!
And this about rockets...

511
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,323
now, get this straight...

512
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,059
my name's not Talbot,
and you got the wrong sucker,

513
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,594
so stop following me, see?

514
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,896
Please, captain,
you must listen to me!

515
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,064
Go away.

516
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,200
Go away,
or I'll call the police.

517
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:38,435
I have it right here
if you only want to see.

518
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,471
Please!

519
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,476
Please, captain!

520
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:54,151
Hey, watch where you're going!

521
00:30:56,288 --> 00:31:00,457
On, uh, second thought,
where<i> are</i> you going?

522
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:04,094
Would you, uh, like a lift?

523
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,199
I checked.

524
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,901
$10.

525
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:47,471
$10...And $20.

526
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,340
I'll get it, captain.

527
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,909
General.

528
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,211
This I gotta see.

529
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:58,081
General vanneman's quarters.

530
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,350
It's for you, John.

531
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,952
I'm out.

532
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,488
Three Jacks...

533
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,691
Three kings, senator.

534
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:10,494
...and two aces.

535
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,367
What?

536
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,404
Yes. Put him on.

537
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,571
Oh.

538
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,207
It's Talbot.

539
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,176
Talbot?

540
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,478
Sir, I'm sorry.
I've got to talk to you.

541
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,614
What's up? You're not
supposed to check in till...

542
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,316
sir, I'm being followed.

543
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,951
You what?!

544
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,687
A spy... everywhere I go.
I can't seem to shake her.

545
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:37,487
Her?!

546
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,356
Yes, sir. She's a woman.

547
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,959
Describe her.

548
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,561
Well, she's... she's young...
early 20s, maybe.

549
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:47,030
Dresses kinda funny,
like one of those...

550
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,565
like one of those beatniks.

551
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:49,599
She's got an accent.

552
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,201
What kind?

553
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,970
I couldn't tell, sir.

554
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,105
We can pretty well guess,
though, can't we?

555
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:56,506
Oh.

556
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,208
You know her name?

557
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,609
Yes, sir...

558
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,212
lyrae... l-y-r-a-e.

559
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,014
A-e.

560
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:08,018
Hmph. Naturally,
that's not a real name.

561
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,454
They're too smart for that.

562
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,756
How can they know?

563
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:16,593
How can they possibly know?!

564
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,096
She was on my plane, sir.

565
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,765
Then the leak must be
right here on this base.

566
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:25,435
Well, no doubt about it, sir.

567
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,509
I knew it from the start!

568
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,644
I never should have
let you go, Talbot!

569
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,446
Oh, no, no, no, sir.

570
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,583
I'm all right.
My only problem is this girl.

571
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,185
What'll I do, sir?

572
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,054
Do?!

573
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:46,023
Get out of there,
that's what you do.

574
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,191
Take the first bus
to San Francisco.

575
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,359
Does your family know?

576
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,594
No, sir.

577
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,162
Good. Don't let them.

578
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,097
Don't tell them anything.

579
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,167
Don't you talk to anybody...
not even federal security!

580
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,502
Federal security?

581
00:33:58,504 --> 00:33:59,770
Are<i> they</i> here?

582
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:01,238
They will be.

583
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,507
All you have to do
is take that bus.

584
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,775
You understand?

585
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,743
No, sir, but I'll do it.

586
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,512
Good.

587
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,514
This woman's not alone,
you know.

588
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,249
But, sir, if she knows...

589
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,517
touch in the dark...

590
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,218
war of nerves.

591
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,621
We can play
that little game ourselves.

592
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,389
Now, all you have to do

593
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,391
is pack up
and get out of there...

594
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,726
alive!

595
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,428
Believe me, general...

596
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,765
I'll sure try.

597
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,682
Captain Talbot?

598
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,524
Fed...

599
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,659
federal security.

600
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,161
Mcclosky.

601
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,932
Well, we missed her.

602
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,501
We flung a net over the town,
but she got through.

603
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,936
Either that,

604
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:15,939
or she's still holed up
there somewhere.

605
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,375
We're gonna need
some more details.

606
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,809
Like what?

607
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,512
Now, what happened
on that aeroplane?

608
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,780
Nothing much.

609
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,649
She gave me some pills.

610
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,484
I still got the bottle.

611
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,787
You didn't take any?

612
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,255
One.

613
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,791
Oh? Any after-effects?

614
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,259
Yeah. I felt better.

615
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,662
Could be a delayed reaction...

616
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,363
like a time bomb.

617
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,265
Why is she tailing you?

618
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,202
I haven't the faintest idea.

619
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:48,271
You big with the air force?

620
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:52,242
No, Mr. Mcclosky...
small, very small.

621
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,743
Secret mission?

622
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,246
No. I was just home on leave
visiting my family.

623
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,748
You don't have to clam up
with me, captain.

624
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,517
We're on different teams,

625
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,752
but we both work
for the same coach.

626
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,688
What the opposition
wants from you

627
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,656
is part of the same game.

628
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,259
I can get blown out of
the stadium as high as you.

629
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,861
I rather doubt that.

630
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,497
Come on, captain.

631
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:18,235
This isn't marbles.
This is the big game.

632
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,804
Well...

633
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,273
When you come right down to it,

634
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:24,808
all I saw was one girl,

635
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,777
and all she wanted to do
was tell me something.

636
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,913
Tell you what?

637
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,882
Well, she knew
that I was going to...

638
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:36,419
gen. Vanneman:<i> Don't tell them</i>
<i>anything... Anything...</i>

639
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,821
<i>Anything!</i>

640
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,889
Go on! Go on.
What did she know?

641
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:43,026
I'm not talking.

642
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,635
Hey, Mr. Mcclosky!

643
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,704
Mr. Mcclosky!

644
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,905
What's the...

645
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,507
let's go. Come on.

646
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,650
Any word?

647
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,553
One man says he saw a woman
answering her description...

648
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,055
almost ran her down.

649
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,690
Did he talk to her?

650
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:48,091
Tried to give her a lift.

651
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,693
What happened?

652
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,795
That's what the fella
can't remember.

653
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,763
When he came to,
it was 3:00 A.M.,

654
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,566
and he was 4 Miles outside
of town walking in circles.

655
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,101
Does this info check out?

656
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,904
All except the last part...
I don't know about that.

657
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:04,107
But you see what I mean?
They're clever.

658
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,910
Here...

659
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:09,079
Send this to the lab.
Tell them to rush it.

660
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:11,114
Soon as you got a report,
send it to me.

661
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,717
If there's any antidote,
bring it to me pronto.

662
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,051
Right.

663
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,585
You made sure
we won't be bothered?

664
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:50,987
Yes, sir.
You're in the bridal suite.

665
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,694
Now, everything's secure,
brown?

666
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,696
Buttoned up tight.

667
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:02,932
Relax, captain.
Those spies of yours

668
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:06,569
couldn't have the remotest
idea where you are.

669
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,171
I don't doubt it.

670
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,974
I don't know where I am myself.

671
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,521
Hey, who are you calling?

672
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,190
Mcchord air force base...

673
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,459
on orders. Any objection?

674
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,594
Okay. Okay.

675
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,197
Don't get touchy.

676
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,865
Oh, sorry.

677
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,468
I want to place a call
to general vanneman,

678
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,969
mcchord air force base.

679
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,071
That's right.

680
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,474
Make it collect.

681
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:18,908
Who, me?

682
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,711
I'm captain Talbot.

683
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:24,781
You and your detail spell
each other standing guard.

684
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,583
I want a man here at all times,

685
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,117
at every entrance.

686
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,720
I mean every delivery
entrance and mousehole.

687
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:31,988
Gotcha.

688
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,695
¶ Hmm da-doo-doo
hmm-hmm hmm hmm hmm ¶

689
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,930
this is a private call.

690
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,131
Do you mind?!

691
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,867
Sorry.

692
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,804
I'm under orders, too,
you know.

693
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:49,239
I'd know anyway.

694
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:50,807
It's bugged.

695
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:56,145
¶ Hmm-hmm hmm hmm ¶

696
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:59,749
¶ hmm-hmm hmm hmm-hmm ¶

697
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:02,218
I don't care
whose toes we step on!

698
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,588
I want another security check
brought on everybody!

699
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,190
And this time, include me!

700
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:12,262
Does that make it
clear enough, colonel?

701
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:13,263
Yes, sir.

702
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:14,264
General.

703
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:15,565
Vanneman!

704
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,133
That's all.

705
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,134
Yes.

706
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,269
Talbot?

707
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:21,004
Yes, sir.

708
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:23,139
Where are you?

709
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:24,541
Uh...

710
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,875
Park Lane hotel.

711
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,944
Gen. Vanneman:
What about the spy?

712
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,013
Well, we've finally
shaken her, sir...

713
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,015
at least, I think we have.

714
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,284
I've turned the base inside out,
I'm having checks rerun...

715
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:36,553
be careful, sir,
this line's tapped...

716
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:37,887
federal security.

717
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,956
Tapped?!
How dare they do that?!

718
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,091
This is official
air force business!

719
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:44,327
Would you like
to tell them, sir?

720
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,329
One of them's
standing right here.

721
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:47,797
Yes. Put him on!

722
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,834
General vanneman.

723
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,870
Mcclosky speaking.

724
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,972
Mcclosky, as of right now,

725
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:58,741
captain Talbot is the most
important man in this country.

726
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,610
You understand?

727
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,613
No, general, I don't.
I'd appreciate it if...

728
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,848
I don't got time to chat.
Get this straight...

729
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,717
if you'd give me an idea...

730
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,152
guard him with your life...

731
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:10,753
with your life, sir!

732
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,722
See that he's not disturbed.

733
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,158
Yes, sir, but I feel
that I have the right...

734
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,694
keep him quiet
and perfectly relaxed.

735
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,762
I'll let you know later about
getting him back to the base.

736
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,699
Whatever you say, general.

737
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,867
But just between...

738
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,804
right! Put Talbot back on.

739
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:31,274
Uh, say, general,
what about my leave?

740
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,375
Canceled!

741
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,210
But, sir, you promised.

742
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,679
You've gotten us into
enough trouble, Talbot.

743
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,081
There'll be no more.

744
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,617
But, general, sir,
you promised me...

745
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,086
you have 6 hours and
23 minutes of leave time left.

746
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:44,153
Use it wisely.

747
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,855
Wisely?

748
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,857
Go to bed and stay there.
That's an order!!

749
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,793
Yes, sir.

750
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,902
The general didn't take time
to elaborate,

751
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:03,172
but I get the impression
he's leaving it up to you.

752
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,707
Hmm?

753
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,242
Leaving what?

754
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,277
Filling me in.

755
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,813
What is this all about?

756
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,286
I may be bushed, Mr. Mcclosky,

757
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,088
but I'm not<i> that</i> bushed.

758
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,758
We're entrusted
with the security

759
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,093
of the entire United States,

760
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:27,230
and they don't tell me a thing!

761
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:08,471
Oh.

762
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,225
Talbot!

763
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,493
Yeah?

764
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,128
Come and get it.

765
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,329
Okay.

766
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,775
Oh.

767
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:47,376
Excuse me.

768
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,954
It's good. Dig in.

769
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:07,330
Major:<i> Mind, now...</i>
<i>no food of any kind...</i>

770
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:10,833
<i>not even a teeny-weeny bite.</i>

771
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:13,369
Gen. Vanneman:<i> Talbot!</i>

772
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,304
<i>Remember the rules.</i>

773
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,314
What's the matter...
yours tough?

774
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,950
I got my own food.

775
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:47,303
What's that stuff?

776
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,338
Lunch!

777
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,041
No, that's dinner.

778
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,976
Oh... ulcers?

779
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,311
Mnh-mnh.

780
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,480
Ohh...

781
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:03,920
Medical experiment...

782
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,923
like survival food, maybe?

783
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,457
Maybe.

784
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:11,394
All right, don't tell me!

785
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:23,606
I'm sorry if I can't talk,
Mr. Mcclosky.

786
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:26,843
It's nothing personal,
you know.

787
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:43,159
Listen to this...

788
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:47,530
"captain Talbot,
please do not avoid me again.

789
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,466
"Your very life is at stake.

790
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,602
The girl on the plane."

791
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:54,871
The girl on the plane?

792
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,339
She's here!

793
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:59,442
She can't be.

794
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:00,877
She can't be!

795
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,545
Stay put and lock the door!

796
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,081
And don't leave
until I get back!

797
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,315
Hey!

798
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,351
I thought you said
she'd never find us!

799
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:11,120
How's that for luck?
Walked right into our trap!

800
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,269
The girl on the plane.

801
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,165
Captain Talbot...

802
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:01,304
Captain Talbot!

803
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:03,406
Captain Talbot!

804
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:04,941
Ooh-hoo!

805
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:13,082
Ooh-hoo!

806
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:16,085
Captain Talbot,
I must talk to you.

807
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,055
Captain Talbot...

808
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,122
Whoo-hoo!

809
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:24,493
I do not always mean
to startle you,

810
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,462
but there is so little time.

811
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,966
Where did you...
how long have you been here?

812
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:31,334
Not long.

813
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,735
How did you get in?

814
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,571
From the next room.

815
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:38,140
It is not occupied.

816
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,209
That door was locked.
I checked it myself.

817
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,411
Yes. I know.

818
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,721
Okay.

819
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:54,290
We've got you now.
You're all washed up.

820
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:55,491
Washed up?

821
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,159
Yeah... finished.

822
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,428
Federal security's
tearing this hotel apart

823
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,763
looking for you.

824
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:02,465
Your spying tricks
won't work with us,

825
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:03,632
you understand?

826
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,234
You speak too fast...

827
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:07,770
don't play
sweet and dumb with me.

828
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:10,773
Where are you from?
How'd you find us here?

829
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,441
It does not matter.

830
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,709
The only thing is...

831
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,111
no, you don't.

832
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:17,313
I am only trying to help!

833
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:26,756
Well...

834
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:30,159
All right.

835
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,228
Maybe you're one spy
who doesn't carry a gun.

836
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,096
A spy?

837
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,765
Yes... an enemy spy!

838
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,500
But no!

839
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,101
What do you mean, "but no"?

840
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:41,470
I am no enemy.

841
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:44,774
You're a friendly spy?

842
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:47,443
A spy is someone
who seeks information.

843
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,778
Is that not so?

844
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,480
Well, that's one way
of putting it.

845
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:52,782
Then I am no spy.

846
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:55,518
I am here to<i> give</i> you
information,

847
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,652
not to<i> seek</i> it.

848
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,388
Well, that's a switch.

849
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,656
A switch?

850
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,224
Yeah. A switch...

851
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,492
yes?

852
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:07,463
Oh, never mind.

853
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:09,198
Captain Talbot...

854
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,234
I wish only to save your life.

855
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,236
Now, look...

856
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:17,573
How did you find out
I'm going to the moon?

857
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,775
I did not say you were going.

858
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:22,211
I said you would<i> try.</i>

859
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,647
And you will fail unless
you follow our instructions.

860
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,115
Our?

861
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,653
Mcclosky:
Open up, Talbot, it's me.

862
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:32,388
Believe me, captain,

863
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,657
what happened to Charlie
will happen to you!

864
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,525
The poor little thing is...

865
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,727
how do you say it?

866
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:40,496
Out of his head?

867
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:42,098
Yes.

868
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,200
You did not protect him.

869
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:46,502
It is not your fault...
you are not as advanced.

870
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:49,772
Talbot, you all right?

871
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,173
Just a second!

872
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,645
How could you possibly know?

873
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:59,482
You will come with me, yes?

874
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,217
Yes.

875
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,718
Where?

876
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,753
How about the park
right out there?

877
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:05,888
When?

878
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,257
Who's in there with you?
Open up!

879
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:09,391
Soon as I can.

880
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,260
Oh, that is good.

881
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:14,396
Talbot, you let me in,
or I'll break the door down!

882
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:16,132
Get in here... quick!

883
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,733
Open up!

884
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:27,243
Talbot, you let me in,
or I'll break the door down!

885
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:28,844
Break it down!

886
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:54,870
What's going on?

887
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:15,791
Ow!

888
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,193
Where is she?

889
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,394
She?

890
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:19,695
Ohh.

891
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,632
Come on. Come on.

892
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,801
Woman:<i> I'll tell you</i>
<i>how you can get it...</i>

893
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,407
Where did she go?

894
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,275
Where did who go?

895
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:35,678
Don't you give me that!

896
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,913
I heard a woman's voice
in this room!

897
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,348
Uh, you...

898
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,350
You must have heard that.

899
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:44,520
Woman:<i> ...Frankie, don't look</i>
<i>at me like that.</i>

900
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:47,623
<i>Baby, I love you. No... oh, no!</i>

901
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,392
<i>Please, Frankie!</i>

902
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:56,632
Why did you take so long
to open the door?

903
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:58,267
Uh, t-to open the door?

904
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,535
Yes.

905
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:02,905
We got the whole staff
rounded up in the kitchen.

906
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,807
I'll be right with you.

907
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,743
Why don't you get dressed
and come on along

908
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,512
and see if
you can identify her?!

909
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:11,580
I will. I will.

910
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,015
Tuxedo 5-0711, and be quick.

911
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:57,693
Drake! Send this to the lab.

912
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,561
Tell them to rush it.

913
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:01,830
Tell those men in the lobby
to get up here fast.

914
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,932
We don't want any slip-ups.
Hurry up, will you?!

915
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,969
Hello, Harris? Mack.

916
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,971
Say, uh, I think
we've got that girl

917
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,040
trapped right here
in the hotel.

918
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,941
Right.

919
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,877
Well...

920
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:18,414
Break out files
on all female spy suspects

921
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,916
and stand by for action, sir.

922
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:21,950
Thank you.

923
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:22,452
Oh...

924
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:28,657
Ready?

925
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,426
With that convention...

926
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:33,062
with that convention crowd
in the lobby,

927
00:55:33,064 --> 00:55:35,898
we'll have to keep
close tabs on our boy.

928
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,733
There will be no slip-ups.

929
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:51,513
Uh, Mr. Mcclosky,

930
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,615
what if we don't find the spy?

931
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:56,652
Well, if we don't find her,
what do we do then?

932
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:59,555
Captain, we never quit
until the file is closed.

933
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:00,689
Don't worry...

934
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,891
this one's closing with a bang.

935
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:06,829
Say, uh, Mr. Mcclosky...

936
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,964
uh, Mr. Mcclosky, uh...

937
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,433
When this is over,
if you don't need me,

938
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,102
I was wondering

939
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:15,637
if I could get away
for about a half an hour?

940
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,843
Uh...

941
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,879
Not even to look up
an old friend?

942
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:30,519
Absolutely<i> not.</i>

943
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:39,495
Excuse me.

944
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,498
Hey.

945
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,587
Hey, don't I know you?

946
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,722
No.

947
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:08,457
Ted Jones! Of all the...

948
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:10,426
you got the wrong fella.
I'll see you.

949
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:11,960
No, come here!

950
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:14,196
You're the spit and image
of your dad.

951
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:16,965
Hey, fellas, look who's here!
Come and meet my family.

952
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:21,103
Now...
When we get in there, we...

953
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,838
who...

954
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,174
Talbot!

955
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:27,810
Where is he?! Get him!

956
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:29,578
Cover the exits!

957
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,979
You... you...

958
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:18,727
Gen. Vanneman:<i> Talbot!</i>

959
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,796
<i>Don't talk to anyone.</i>

960
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,866
<i>They're rough. They're clever.</i>

961
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:28,036
<i>Talbot, you've gotten us</i>
<i>into enough trouble.</i>

962
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,123
Captain Talbot.

963
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,658
Don't do that!

964
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,594
I am happy
that you could get away.

965
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:54,863
Yeah. H-how did you...

966
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:58,734
how in the world
do you always manage to...

967
00:58:58,736 --> 00:58:59,735
oh, boy.

968
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,603
Now, are you alone?

969
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:02,871
Oh, yes.

970
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,007
Where shall we go?

971
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:07,943
Nowhere. We'll...

972
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:14,583
Come on. We'll sit over there.

973
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:16,084
Come on.

974
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:21,123
Listen, I'll give you
exactly one minute

975
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,725
to explain how you know
about Charlie and me,

976
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,327
or I'm gonna turn you in.

977
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:32,735
Tsk.

978
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,136
"Coat the rocket
with beryllium and cesium

979
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:36,004
"and proportion
3 to 5 respectively.

980
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,574
"This to be infused
with aniline and talvadine

981
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,609
at a temp... "
what's this supposed to do?

982
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,844
Protect you
from the proton rays.

983
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:44,346
What happened to Charlie...

984
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:46,815
will happen to me.
You said that before.

985
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:49,117
Your air force must give
you this protection.

986
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,720
Beryllium and cesium
infused with aniline...

987
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:52,955
aniline?

988
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:55,624
Chemistry is not
my special field,

989
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:57,159
but I know a little.

990
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:59,895
We've been using vanadium
in combination with...

991
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:01,977
that is not good enough...
not where you'll be going.

992
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:06,602
The way Charlie was acting up,

993
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,103
you may have a point.

994
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,339
You think this is the answer?

995
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:11,940
I know it is, captain.

996
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,610
You must not lose
another moment.

997
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,112
It will take time
to coat the rocket.

998
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:19,147
All this time
I've been running away

999
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:20,749
thinking you were an enemy.

1000
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,752
Oh, yeah, that is funny...

1001
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:25,621
a big, strong man like you

1002
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:27,623
and a weak little girl like me.

1003
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:32,127
I can just see vanneman's
face when I tell him...

1004
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,896
By the way,
what am I going to tell him?

1005
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:36,965
Where did you get this formula?

1006
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:41,003
It is a confidence.
It's better I do not say.

1007
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:43,372
But if I'm gonna make sense
with the general,

1008
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:46,008
I'm gonna have to answer
some questions, like...

1009
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,143
by the way, where are you from?

1010
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,112
Please, do not ask me that,
captain Talbot.

1011
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:51,980
Why not?

1012
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,249
It has nothing to do
with the formula.

1013
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,984
Nothing?

1014
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,820
Oh... tell your general
you thought of it yourself!

1015
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,156
He knows I'm not that smart...

1016
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,158
not in chemistry, anyway.

1017
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,993
Then tell him nothing.

1018
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,895
Only make him test it,
and he will see for himself.

1019
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,897
We have been using it
for years.

1020
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:11,166
We? Who's we?

1021
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,369
Promise me you will insist
on the protection, hmm?

1022
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,038
Now, look...

1023
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,174
You tell me who you are
and where you're from.

1024
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,009
You would not believe me.

1025
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,077
Why wouldn't I?

1026
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:26,014
All right...

1027
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,283
If there is no other way.

1028
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:30,218
I am from betalyrae.

1029
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,353
Beta what?

1030
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,354
Lyrae.

1031
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,156
Where's that?

1032
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:35,223
Up there.

1033
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:36,892
Which hotel?

1034
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:39,361
Not a hotel, captain...
a planet.

1035
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,296
Oh, a planet.

1036
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,098
A planet?

1037
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,436
You cannot see it now.

1038
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:50,439
Even at night it's difficult.

1039
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:54,009
You mean you think
you're from...

1040
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:56,178
It is beyond the star
that you call Andromeda.

1041
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,779
Oh, boy.

1042
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:59,915
It was bad enough when
I thought you were a spy.

1043
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,750
Now<i> you</i> think you're...

1044
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:03,985
I knew
you would not believe me.

1045
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:05,420
What did you expect?

1046
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:07,856
Then why did you
make me tell you?

1047
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:09,758
That was not very bright.

1048
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,993
And I am not a space-age kook.

1049
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:14,296
How did you know
I was thinking that?

1050
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:16,431
You earth people
are so conceited.

1051
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,400
You think you know everything!

1052
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,835
You can read minds.

1053
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,436
When it is necessary, yes.

1054
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,371
Can you tell fortunes, too?

1055
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:24,973
Captain...

1056
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:28,977
If I prove to you
I am what I say,

1057
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:30,912
would it help?

1058
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:35,183
Look, don't you think
this has gone far enough?

1059
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:39,187
I will try to show you
something of your future.

1060
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:42,858
Sometimes the vision
is not very nice.

1061
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,961
I never know
what will materialize.

1062
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,533
You are not afraid?

1063
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,535
No, go right ahead.

1064
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:56,204
My future couldn't look
any worse than it does now.

1065
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:07,149
Look, I've given you
just about every chance I can,

1066
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:09,918
but spy, astronaut,
or just plain kook,

1067
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,921
it's time I had you
checked out with security.

1068
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:14,022
Hello.

1069
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,123
Hello.

1070
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,392
Are you lost, fella?

1071
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:18,894
Unh-unh?

1072
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:21,062
What's your name?

1073
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:22,330
Richmond.

1074
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:23,965
Richmond?

1075
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,536
Richmond... Richmond?

1076
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:30,272
He's got the same name as me.

1077
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:31,907
Huh?

1078
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:34,176
You better run along, fella.

1079
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,044
Wait.

1080
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:49,057
Whose little boy are you?

1081
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,392
Yours.

1082
01:03:50,394 --> 01:03:52,828
Mine?

1083
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:03,138
I told you, I never know
what will materialize.

1084
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:06,608
Ours?

1085
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:16,117
Ours?

1086
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:24,259
Huh?

1087
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:27,062
Did I do it all wrong?

1088
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,266
It's unbelievable.

1089
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:33,935
Oh, you do not believe me?

1090
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:39,074
Come on.

1091
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:42,143
We better go call the general.

1092
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:46,948
Every highway and bridge...

1093
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,017
every airport,
railroad station,

1094
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,919
bus depot, and taxi stand.

1095
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,421
I want complete coverage,
a list of all suspects,

1096
01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:55,590
instant reports
on the slightest rumble.

1097
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:57,259
Right? Right.

1098
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:58,193
Mac.

1099
01:04:58,195 --> 01:04:59,661
Oh, denis.

1100
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,930
Chief says I'm to be
your good right arm.

1101
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:03,465
What'll you have?

1102
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:05,934
Plenty of police cars,
both standby and cruising,

1103
01:05:05,936 --> 01:05:08,036
and I want
every man you can spare.

1104
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:10,672
They tell me this is
top-security stuff.

1105
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:13,608
My orders are coming
straight from Washington.

1106
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,577
For an air force captain?

1107
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:18,046
The guy must be hot.
What's he do?

1108
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:20,582
Sorry...
I'm not at liberty to say.

1109
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,318
A man as important as that
should have been guarded.

1110
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,619
He was.

1111
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:27,022
Oh, no! What rookie
handled that goof-off?

1112
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:41,603
The bird flies
at 1000 sharp on schedule.

1113
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,104
Keep the countdown going.

1114
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:46,942
We'll do our best, sir.

1115
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,110
You'll do better than that.

1116
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:53,715
We have no control
over technical bugs, sir.

1117
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:55,216
We have them every time.

1118
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,218
Then make this a first!

1119
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:01,089
No scrubs, no bugs,
no red lights, and no excuses!

1120
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,091
I'll have Talbot
back here in time

1121
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:05,160
for final briefing
and blastoff.

1122
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:06,628
He goes up on schedule,

1123
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,964
or we'll go down in history
as failures.

1124
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,966
And I'll write the book myself!

1125
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:40,328
Did he like it?

1126
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,496
He wasn't there.

1127
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,098
He left the base,

1128
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,767
and he's on his way
here to get me.

1129
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,602
Oh, that is good!

1130
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:49,637
You will tell him then.

1131
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:53,508
It's in the meanwhile
that I'm worried about.

1132
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,511
There is nothing to do
but wait.

1133
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,179
So, will we wait?

1134
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:04,152
Oh, thank you.

1135
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,091
Why, uh...

1136
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:12,193
well, how come you went
to all this trouble?

1137
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,029
Hmm?

1138
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:16,464
Why should you care whether
our moon shot works or not?

1139
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:18,233
We want to be friends.

1140
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:19,734
With us?

1141
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,469
But of course.

1142
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,171
Yeah?

1143
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:30,245
We've been watching you
for centuries.

1144
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,647
No fooling?

1145
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:35,517
It has taken you
a long time to...

1146
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,520
how do you say it...
to advance to us?

1147
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:41,489
Um, catch up with you?

1148
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:43,725
Yes, catch up...

1149
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,361
So that you could hear us
and talk to us,

1150
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,629
and it will come.

1151
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,564
Now you are in space with us.

1152
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,765
We would like to help.

1153
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,501
Oh...

1154
01:07:53,503 --> 01:07:57,105
You laugh at me.

1155
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:58,506
No.

1156
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:01,342
It struck me funny, that's all.

1157
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:03,111
Funny?

1158
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:06,381
Yeah. Well, no,
not funny exactly.

1159
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,083
It's more like...

1160
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:10,518
it's more like wonderful...

1161
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,388
crazy, mixed-up... Wonderful.

1162
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,389
What is?

1163
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:17,792
Well, you, me...

1164
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:19,594
just the thought that

1165
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,297
there are people like you
up there.

1166
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,866
I mean... oh, man,
that's something!

1167
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:27,235
Wait till I tell
those other guys.

1168
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:31,706
They'll never believe it...
never in a thousand years.

1169
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:41,649
What is wrong?

1170
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,119
Well, how do you expect
the general

1171
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,521
to ever believe
a thing like this?

1172
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:48,256
But you believed me.

1173
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:51,226
Well, sure I did,
but look what you had to do.

1174
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:53,895
I mean, well...
You can't just go around

1175
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:56,397
materializing children
out of thin air

1176
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,733
for guys like
the general or mcclosky

1177
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:01,202
or anybody else
who happens to come along

1178
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,470
and want some proof.

1179
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,905
It wouldn't be decent.

1180
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:06,908
But I could not materialize
for them...

1181
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:14,849
...only for you.

1182
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,650
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1183
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:50,919
I want the entire
neighborhood fine-combed!

1184
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:52,387
Right!

1185
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,255
Excuse me.

1186
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:56,724
Say, whatever happened
to that couple that was...

1187
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,261
general vanneman.

1188
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:02,197
Where is he?

1189
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:04,933
I'm glad to meet you, sir.
My name's mcclosky.

1190
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:06,935
Trot him out, mcclosky.

1191
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:09,537
He'll be here directly, sir.
Won't you have a seat?

1192
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:10,905
Thank you.

1193
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:12,640
I don't have much time.

1194
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,542
What do you mean, "directly"?!

1195
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,877
In a minute, sir.

1196
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,512
You mean he's not here?

1197
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:18,947
Oh, of course he is.

1198
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:20,548
Can't I order you a drink?

1199
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:21,950
No, thank you.

1200
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:25,386
Room service!
Wouldn't you like a sandwich?

1201
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,488
Say, what's going on
around here?!

1202
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,990
"On," general?

1203
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:30,458
Yes!

1204
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,993
Who are all these people?!

1205
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:33,928
It looks like
a field headquarters!

1206
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,464
Oh, this... this is just
ordinary routine,

1207
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:37,599
that's all... yes.

1208
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:39,334
Routine for what?

1209
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:41,669
Well, when we do a job, sir,
we do it thoroughly...

1210
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:43,271
yes, sirree!

1211
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:44,939
Where is captain Talbot?

1212
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:47,742
He'll be back
within the hour, sir.

1213
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,278
You, uh... you have my word.

1214
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,813
He's gone.

1215
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:53,881
Don't you concern yourself,
general...

1216
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:55,383
you lost him!!

1217
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,685
Just temporarily,
that's all, sir.

1218
01:10:57,687 --> 01:11:00,688
There was a bit of a mix-up,
wasn't there?

1219
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,957
But we're hot
on the scent, sir...

1220
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,392
hot on the... Scent.

1221
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:05,960
I thought...

1222
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,296
I talked to him!
You had him right here!

1223
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:10,798
Yes, sir...
right here in this very room.

1224
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,401
You let them grab him
out from under your noses.

1225
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:15,937
Shows what kind of experts
we're up against, huh?

1226
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,505
Experts?!

1227
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:18,906
Of course they're experts!

1228
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,942
What's so difficult
about being expert

1229
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,011
when you're dealing
with amateurs?!

1230
01:11:23,013 --> 01:11:25,480
Let's be careful
about the language, huh?

1231
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:28,283
Don't tell<i> me</i> to be careful!
<i>You</i> should have been!

1232
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,418
Hold on! We're only human.

1233
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,288
Anybody can make a mistake.
Even<i> we</i> can.

1234
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:36,291
Don't give me platitudes,
just get me back my officer!

1235
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:39,294
And talking of mistakes...
if he's so important to you,

1236
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:41,429
why did you let him out
in the first place?

1237
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:43,765
That has nothing
to do with you.

1238
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:46,834
I have a right to know!
Why is he so important?!

1239
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:48,770
Sorry... top security.

1240
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:52,073
General, I<i> am</i> security!!

1241
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:55,943
Oh, yes.

1242
01:11:58,415 --> 01:11:59,947
Mr. Mcclosky...

1243
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:02,083
Captain Talbot
happens to be the pilot

1244
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:04,419
who is going around the moon.

1245
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:05,486
Around the moon!

1246
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,621
Shh!

1247
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:14,062
Like Charlie the chimp?

1248
01:12:14,064 --> 01:12:16,064
Yes.

1249
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:18,700
Well, what do you know!

1250
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:21,636
I'd never have guessed it...

1251
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:23,905
not the captain.

1252
01:12:23,907 --> 01:12:27,442
The captain happens to be
our lucky volunteer.

1253
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:29,043
Just think...

1254
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:30,978
All this time,

1255
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,015
we had a man
right here in our midst...

1256
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:37,085
a man who'll go down
in history,

1257
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:38,553
like Columbus,

1258
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,555
and we didn't even know.

1259
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,490
We didn't...

1260
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:44,625
why wasn't I told?!

1261
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:46,394
Does that imply, sir,

1262
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:48,429
that your efforts left
something to be desired?

1263
01:12:48,431 --> 01:12:50,965
My job is just as important
to me as yours is to you.

1264
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,934
I'm in charge of this search,

1265
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:55,103
and right now you're in my way!

1266
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:56,804
Is that clear?

1267
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:57,972
Ha!

1268
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:59,374
Mac.

1269
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:00,842
Yeah.

1270
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:02,577
What?

1271
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:04,812
Search all of those joints.

1272
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:08,716
I want every female beatnik
in the town brought in.

1273
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,419
I want to see
that spy dame behind bars!

1274
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:12,887
Right.

1275
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:20,094
Mcclosky, I've changed my mind.

1276
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:21,963
I'll have that drink.

1277
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:26,768
What if he just plain refuses?

1278
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,437
Then you must make him do it.

1279
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:34,709
With generals, you don't
<i>make</i> them do anything.

1280
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:36,644
He's not a reasonable man?

1281
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,679
Well, it all depends upon

1282
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,449
what he calls
a "reasonable" request.

1283
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:42,850
Then refuse to go.

1284
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:45,119
Oh, sure, I can see
the headlines now...

1285
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,921
"moon pilot chickens out."

1286
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,724
I'd rather be dead
the easy way, like a hero.

1287
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:51,125
If the moon shot fails,

1288
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:53,561
your president would be
very angry with him.

1289
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:55,797
You don't realize he has to
go through with it,

1290
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:57,832
and so do I, protection or not.

1291
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,700
Oh, you are so stubborn.

1292
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:01,436
Nope.

1293
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,971
I'm just a guy who does
what he has to do.

1294
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,676
Right now, I'm more worried

1295
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,678
about what's gonna happen
to you.

1296
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,580
What<i> is</i> gonna happen
when I'm up there?

1297
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:14,849
Please, don't worry.

1298
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:18,453
Will you be going back to...

1299
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,121
I don't know.

1300
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,557
If the general turns me down,
is that gonna mean trouble?

1301
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,859
Do not even think of that.

1302
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:26,661
I have to.

1303
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:31,132
Maybe I'll decide
I won't even call him.

1304
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,667
You must.

1305
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:34,602
It is your duty
to your country...

1306
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:35,837
I know.

1307
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:38,239
...to the whole universe...

1308
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,575
To me...

1309
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,844
our future together.

1310
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:44,846
Yeah...

1311
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:47,582
Our future.

1312
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:50,251
Richmond...

1313
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:54,555
I wish always to be
where you will be.

1314
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:58,059
For me there is
no one else but you.

1315
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:05,132
It's like I've been
lonesome all my life,

1316
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:07,735
and now, all of a sudden...

1317
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:09,904
lyrae...

1318
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,011
What was that?

1319
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,713
Hmm?

1320
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:20,548
What did you do?

1321
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,550
I kissed you.

1322
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:24,118
So that's a kiss?

1323
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,587
You mean to say
you didn't know about it?

1324
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:28,122
I have heard about it,

1325
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,558
and I have tried to understand,

1326
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,060
but it is not the same
as doing, is it?

1327
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:36,531
I guess not.

1328
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:40,134
Would you do it again?

1329
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:52,113
Mmm. That is nice. Oh, yes.

1330
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:56,250
I don't think you quite
got the hang of it.

1331
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:59,887
I cannot become skillful
with one lesson.

1332
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,992
I must have time

1333
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:07,995
to consider
what I have learned.

1334
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,803
Hey, uh...

1335
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:18,606
What do they do on betalyrae?

1336
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:20,141
Do?

1337
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:22,877
Yeah. I mean, if they don't...

1338
01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:24,679
What<i> do</i> they do?

1339
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,017
Yike!

1340
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:31,686
You don't like?

1341
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:34,021
Well, no. It's just
a little unexpected,

1342
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:35,690
that's all.

1343
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:38,292
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
I<i> do</i> like.

1344
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:39,860
Are you expert?

1345
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:41,262
Hmm? Expert?

1346
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,730
With kissing.

1347
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:44,265
Oh...

1348
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:46,834
Yeah, maybe.

1349
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,236
With you,
I will become expert, yes?

1350
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:50,838
With me?

1351
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,206
Yeah.

1352
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:02,350
I believe I am getting it.

1353
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:14,161
Now, will you call him?

1354
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,296
Hmm?

1355
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:16,864
Your general.

1356
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:18,866
The general.

1357
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,167
Yes.

1358
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:22,770
Oh, the general?

1359
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:24,705
Yeah, you bet I'll call him,

1360
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:26,407
and I'll convince him, too.

1361
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:40,388
Brown speaking.

1362
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:43,357
It's for the general.

1363
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:44,925
Washington?

1364
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,031
Hello.

1365
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:52,233
Hello, general,
this is captain Talbot.

1366
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:54,435
It's Talbot... it's Talbot.

1367
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,270
Talbot...

1368
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,872
Talbot!

1369
01:17:57,874 --> 01:18:00,041
Trace this call.

1370
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:01,308
Trace this call.

1371
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,877
Hook me in.

1372
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:04,412
Talbot, where are you?

1373
01:18:04,414 --> 01:18:06,280
I'm in town, sir.

1374
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:07,848
Where?! Where?!

1375
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,117
Where? Where... where in town?!

1376
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:12,019
I'm at a pay phone, sir.

1377
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,989
What's the matter,
can't you talk?

1378
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:17,124
Oh, yes, sir.
That's why I'm calling.

1379
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:19,126
Gen. Vanneman:
Where did they get you?

1380
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:20,761
They?

1381
01:18:20,763 --> 01:18:22,029
The spies. The spies!

1382
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,231
What's the matter
with you, Talbot?!

1383
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,766
It's from the dock area.

1384
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:27,168
I'm going after him.

1385
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,703
Keep him talking.

1386
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:29,970
Don't let him hang up.

1387
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,775
Captain...

1388
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:37,111
Have you been brainwashed?

1389
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:38,946
Brainwashed?

1390
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:47,955
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid I don't follow you.

1391
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:50,858
Tell... tell me one thing...

1392
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,894
are you free to come and go?

1393
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,763
Oh, yes, sir... free as a bird.

1394
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:57,765
Then what are you doing
on the phone?!

1395
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:59,900
If you're such a free bird,
get your tail up here!

1396
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,102
Uh...

1397
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:02,770
Yes, I will, sir...

1398
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:04,905
As soon as I have your promise.

1399
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,173
Promise?!

1400
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,275
About something
very important, sir.

1401
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:09,777
Listen to me, Talbot...

1402
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:10,878
no, you listen to me!

1403
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,378
What?!

1404
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,447
Sir...

1405
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:16,984
I'm sorry, sir,
but this is important.

1406
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:22,323
Have you got a pencil, sir?

1407
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:23,424
Yes, I've...

1408
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,025
blast you, Talbot,

1409
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:27,328
I'm gonna have you
up for court-martial!

1410
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:30,030
No, you won't, sir,
because I gotta go to...

1411
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,767
I've gotta go to the moon,
and I would like this shot

1412
01:19:32,769 --> 01:19:34,935
to be a success, sir,
wouldn't you?

1413
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,773
Ahh.

1414
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:41,408
Uh, wouldn't you, sir?

1415
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,177
I've...

1416
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:45,913
Wouldn't you, sir?

1417
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:49,116
You're doing fine.
We've almost got it traced.

1418
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:53,287
Captain Talbot?

1419
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,022
I'm still here, sir.

1420
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:57,291
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1421
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,895
Are you trying to make
another little deal?

1422
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:02,062
Yes, sir, I am.

1423
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:03,197
That's mutiny!

1424
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,032
He's coming around.

1425
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:07,168
Captain, are you familiar
with the articles of war?

1426
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,269
Ye...

1427
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,906
you realize this is treason.

1428
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,041
I'm gonna run you up
in the morning...

1429
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:17,978
Talbot?

1430
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,314
Talbot,
are you listening to me?!

1431
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,982
I beg pardon, sir?

1432
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,417
You heard me.

1433
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:26,053
Humor him. Keep him on.

1434
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,591
All right, talk.

1435
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:32,126
I'm listening.

1436
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:39,066
Brown, you got him
pinpointed yet?

1437
01:20:39,068 --> 01:20:40,334
Great.

1438
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,303
Fisherman's wharf.

1439
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:43,938
Beryllium and cesium?

1440
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,439
Talbot: Yes, sir.

1441
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:48,576
You see, cesium's
a soft silvery substance...

1442
01:20:48,578 --> 01:20:50,144
I know what it is.

1443
01:20:50,146 --> 01:20:52,179
I also know
we've been using vanadium.

1444
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:54,148
What makes you think
your formula's better?

1445
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,150
W... uh, uh...

1446
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:59,320
Well, let me ask you one
first, sir.

1447
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:01,288
Uh, how's Charlie?

1448
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,157
Charlie?

1449
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:05,025
Well, uh, let's see, now.

1450
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,327
At last check...

1451
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:07,928
he's worse.

1452
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,331
His mind's been affected, sir.

1453
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:13,934
Look, all I'm asking
is that you make these tests.

1454
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:16,904
After all, it's my brain
and my life.

1455
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:19,073
Is that too much to ask, sir?

1456
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:20,908
No, I suppose not.

1457
01:21:22,345 --> 01:21:25,212
Well, then, will you write
this down, sir?

1458
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,882
All right, talk.

1459
01:21:33,022 --> 01:21:34,922
Cut your siren.

1460
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:38,225
Cut sirens.
Converge on middle wharf.

1461
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:46,066
That's right, sir...

1462
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,035
at a temperature
of 845 degrees centigrade.

1463
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,303
You got that?

1464
01:21:49,305 --> 01:21:52,473
Got it.

1465
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:54,208
Is there anything else

1466
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:57,344
you'd like me to do
for you, captain?

1467
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,680
I would like your promise
to test this formula, sir.

1468
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:01,148
Of course!

1469
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,917
Anything to keep you happy.

1470
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:04,451
Well, thank you, sir.

1471
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,954
We're in, sweetheart. We're in.

1472
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:09,556
Thank you very much, sir,
and I'll be right Al...

1473
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:11,425
let's go, sweetheart.

1474
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,594
Search the area.

1475
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:16,030
Pick up witnesses.

1476
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,200
Hey! Now, wait a minute.

1477
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:21,468
Where are you taking me?

1478
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,170
To police headquarters.

1479
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:25,506
You can't do that.
I gotta see the general.

1480
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:30,344
You'll see him.

1481
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:43,624
Well, well, captain...

1482
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:46,093
Awfully nice to see you again.

1483
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:48,963
Yes, sir. It's, uh,
good to see you, sir.

1484
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:51,231
Your little escapade
all over now?

1485
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:52,733
Yes, sir.

1486
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:54,635
No more deals and conditions?

1487
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,003
No, sir.

1488
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:58,038
Let's get out of here! Out!

1489
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,606
Not so fast, general.

1490
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:01,208
I'm not through with him.

1491
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:03,444
I can't help that, sir.
I'm running out of time.

1492
01:23:03,446 --> 01:23:05,079
Sorry.

1493
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:08,482
We're shooting him
to the moon, remember?

1494
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:12,086
He stays until
he tells me about the spy.

1495
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:15,222
Here's a witness for you, Mac.

1496
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:17,091
Witness for what?!

1497
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:19,093
What's your name?

1498
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:21,729
Cristoforo battaglia.

1499
01:23:21,731 --> 01:23:24,365
Sit right down here,
Mr. Battaglia.

1500
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:26,233
Now, tell me...

1501
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:28,535
Have you ever seen
that man before?

1502
01:23:30,373 --> 01:23:32,373
Oh, sure.

1503
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,774
Mcclosky: Where?

1504
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:36,110
At... on the Fisherman's wharf.

1505
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:37,544
When? This evening.

1506
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:39,613
What was he doing?

1507
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:43,417
Well, uh, he was talking
a long time on the telephone.

1508
01:23:43,419 --> 01:23:45,452
Uh-huh.

1509
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:46,754
Was he alone?

1510
01:23:46,756 --> 01:23:49,356
Oh, no... with a lady friend.

1511
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,225
Describe her.

1512
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:53,360
A good-looking lady...

1513
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,029
very pretty.

1514
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:03,037
Ah, it's nice to be young
and make love, eh?

1515
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:06,707
Would you care to tell us

1516
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:09,176
exactly what they were doing?

1517
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:13,180
What would<i> you</i> be doing
with a pretty girl?

1518
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,118
Uh, just answer the question.

1519
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,488
Well, uh, he kiss her,
and she kiss him.

1520
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:25,159
Are you sure of this, sir?

1521
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:26,727
<i>Senza dubbio.</i>

1522
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,496
They kiss not one time,
not two time, but many time.

1523
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:32,833
Mcclosky: Thank you,
Mr. Battaglia.

1524
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:34,368
You ready for the lineup?

1525
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,203
Yeah, run them in.

1526
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:37,738
Mr. Mcclosky, look, um,

1527
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,107
if it were this girl,
and you found her,

1528
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:41,442
what would you do to her?

1529
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:42,843
Well, this is a spy.

1530
01:24:42,845 --> 01:24:45,379
Most nations shoot them.
We pamper them.

1531
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:47,648
Come on... quit stalling
and tell the truth.

1532
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:50,117
Are you protecting her?
Did you sell out, huh?

1533
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:51,718
You handed over
some rocket secrets?

1534
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,320
What do you think I am?

1535
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:54,521
I don't know!

1536
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:55,656
Will you tell me?

1537
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:58,225
You think I'd betray
my country?!

1538
01:24:58,227 --> 01:24:59,526
Benedict Arnold did.

1539
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:01,161
Easy!!

1540
01:25:01,163 --> 01:25:02,863
No excitement, captain.

1541
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,598
No excitement.

1542
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,500
No excitement.

1543
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:10,204
Mr. Battaglia, when they
line these people up,

1544
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:12,306
I want you to try to identify

1545
01:25:12,308 --> 01:25:14,341
this girl you told us about.

1546
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:17,377
And, captain, I hold you
honor-bound as an officer

1547
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:20,314
in the United States
air force to do the same.

1548
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:39,733
I am following an old gray cat,

1549
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:42,603
who is following
a little gray mouse.

1550
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:45,239
We all live together happily

1551
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:47,441
on the shores of the catatonic.

1552
01:25:47,443 --> 01:25:50,244
Knock it off.

1553
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:52,379
I am a waterlily on dry land...

1554
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:55,249
What in heaven's name do
you see in weirdos like that?

1555
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:57,784
Believe me, sir, I'm not
as bad as I'm painted...

1556
01:25:57,786 --> 01:25:59,586
mcclosky: Pay attention.

1557
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:01,321
Any of them look like her?

1558
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,790
Woman: ...Faded society.

1559
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:06,493
We are all symbols
searching for a status.

1560
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,528
We are all known...

1561
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,796
all right, next bunch.

1562
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,398
...and silent trees...

1563
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,733
Take them out.

1564
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:14,635
All right, down the steps.

1565
01:26:14,637 --> 01:26:17,337
...we are all symbols
searching for status.

1566
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,406
Yeah.

1567
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:21,408
We are all known only...

1568
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:23,544
woman: Hey, wait a minute.

1569
01:26:23,546 --> 01:26:26,213
Only to the darkened silence.

1570
01:26:26,215 --> 01:26:27,481
Get in here.

1571
01:26:27,483 --> 01:26:29,183
Knock it off!

1572
01:26:29,185 --> 01:26:32,252
Get... Up... There!

1573
01:26:32,254 --> 01:26:35,322
All the way over there...
and you, too!

1574
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:36,657
All right... on over.

1575
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:38,458
Come on... all the way up.

1576
01:26:40,329 --> 01:26:41,461
Yeah?

1577
01:26:41,463 --> 01:26:42,529
No, no, no, no.

1578
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,931
The other was, uh...

1579
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:46,867
Affectionate...
<i>che paradiso di Fiore.</i>

1580
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:50,871
Darkness!

1581
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,473
Like, way out there!

1582
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:56,276
The crazy quiet!

1583
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,681
Quiet, man!

1584
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:02,816
Nothing but gone peace,

1585
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:06,520
but I mean out-on-a-limb quiet!

1586
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:08,889
Dig that bottomless pit!

1587
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:10,924
Fallen!

1588
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:12,993
Fallen!

1589
01:27:12,995 --> 01:27:14,628
Fallen!

1590
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,763
Nothing but gone peace!

1591
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:18,865
Mac, here's the lab reports.

1592
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:22,402
Woman: Go up there...
all the way across.

1593
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:24,404
I hate machines...

1594
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:25,772
all machines...

1595
01:27:25,774 --> 01:27:28,375
tape machines,
the wish machines,

1596
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:29,810
and the washing machines...

1597
01:27:29,812 --> 01:27:31,545
all machines.

1598
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:33,780
I hate 'em, I hate 'em,
I hate 'em!

1599
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:35,282
Blah!

1600
01:27:35,284 --> 01:27:36,783
Woman: ¶ ...A-hangin' ¶

1601
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:38,418
¶ a-hangin' from a tree... ¶

1602
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,786
cowards of conformity!

1603
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:42,556
Protectors
of the organization man!

1604
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:49,896
Away with the dollar bills
that chain men to managers!

1605
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:51,932
And away with blue uniforms

1606
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:54,668
and grey flannel suits!
And keep your hands off of me!

1607
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,536
Away with conformity!

1608
01:27:56,538 --> 01:27:57,804
Look at you all!

1609
01:27:57,806 --> 01:28:00,874
You think I don't see you
out there?

1610
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:04,344
I see you!
What does it all mean?

1611
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:07,281
Is it something we can take home
and discuss later?

1612
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:09,416
With your blue suits!
Why does it have to be blue?

1613
01:28:09,418 --> 01:28:10,751
Man: Mac?

1614
01:28:10,753 --> 01:28:11,952
Yeah?

1615
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:14,655
Oh... uh, is there
any more back there?

1616
01:28:14,657 --> 01:28:16,056
Uh, two or three, maybe.

1617
01:28:16,058 --> 01:28:17,624
All right, run them in.

1618
01:28:19,895 --> 01:28:24,831
¶ Nobody can avoid the void ¶

1619
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:29,503
¶ nobody can avoid the void ¶

1620
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:31,505
¶ you can't ¶

1621

1622
01:28:34,076 --> 01:28:35,909
dig!

1626
01:28:45,387 --> 01:28:47,654
that does it, Mac.
You want them held?

1627
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,956
No. Send them back
to their coffee cups.

1628
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:51,925
All right.
That'll be all. Thanks.

1629
01:28:51,927 --> 01:28:53,093
Thank you.

1630
01:28:53,095 --> 01:28:55,529
A very nice show... oh, yes.

1631
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:58,532
Yes. Well, if you don't mind,
mcclosky, we'll...

1632
01:28:58,534 --> 01:29:00,033
just a minute, general.

1633
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:02,669
I have here a lab report
on those pills

1634
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,838
the girl gave you on the plane.

1635
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,674
They analyzed them with
every test known in the book.

1636
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,042
You know what they found?

1637
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:15,949
"They contained no elements
known on earth."

1638
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:18,885
And the same goes
for the bottle.

1639
01:29:18,887 --> 01:29:22,055
It wasn't made
of plastic or glass

1640
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:25,025
or anything that
had ever been seen before.

1641
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,094
That's very interesting.
Isn't it, sir?

1642
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:29,563
Very interesting.

1643
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:31,098
Just a minute, captain.

1644
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:34,968
We also analyzed the note
she sent you this morning.

1645
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:37,771
The composition
of the paper and the ink

1646
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:39,673
was totally unfamiliar.

1647
01:29:39,675 --> 01:29:41,441
And take my word for it...

1648
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:43,643
when we can't break down
a piece of paper,

1649
01:29:43,645 --> 01:29:45,078
nobody can!

1650
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,780
Your point, sir?

1651
01:29:46,782 --> 01:29:48,882
The point is that...

1652
01:29:52,421 --> 01:29:55,856
I don't have any.

1653
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,760
Do you?

1654
01:29:59,762 --> 01:30:01,094
No.

1655
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:06,767
You're free to go, captain.
Thank you.

1656
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:08,502
Thank you.

1657
01:30:08,504 --> 01:30:10,570
Oh, Talbot...

1658
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:12,439
Sir?

1659
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:15,075
I want a straight answer
from you...

1660
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,710
yes or no.

1661
01:30:16,712 --> 01:30:19,513
Did you break any of the rules?

1662
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,114
With a beatnik, sir?

1663
01:30:21,116 --> 01:30:22,449
Yes or no.

1664
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:23,884
Oh, no, sir.

1665
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:31,425
Oh, uh, captain.

1666
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:32,959
Hey, uh...

1667
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:35,695
Where did you say
that girl was from?

1668
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:37,964
I didn't say.

1669
01:30:37,966 --> 01:30:39,433
Uh-huh.

1670
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:43,570
Bye, Mr. Mcclosky.

1671
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:48,041
No element known on earth...

1672
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:57,651
No, no... Couldn't be.

1702
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:32,739
Good to hear you, rich.

1703
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:34,274
Oh, boy...

1704
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:37,277
don't think it isn't good
to hear you, sir.

1705
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:39,112
Are you all right?

1706
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:40,814
Yes, sir.

1707
01:33:40,816 --> 01:33:43,617
But that first stage
was sure a Lulu.

1708
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:46,152
Take over anytime you're ready.

1709
01:33:46,154 --> 01:33:47,387
Yes, sir.

1710
01:33:49,024 --> 01:33:51,992
The prettiest countdown
we ever had.

1711
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:53,627
It's a beautiful day!

1712
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:14,414
Oh, boy, I wish
you could see this, sir.

1713
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:16,249
What a sight!

1714
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:18,151
Any abnormal sensations?

1715
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:31,731
I do feel
a little... Lonesome, sir.

1716
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:33,867
I shouldn't wonder.

1717
01:34:33,869 --> 01:34:35,902

great, rich.

I need you now.

We have ways
of doing things, darling...

1733
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:30,156

01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:12,652
¶ seven moons above ¶

1802
01:38:12,654 --> 01:38:14,654
what's going on up there?!

¶ Seven times the love ¶

1804
01:38:16,324 --> 01:38:18,057
