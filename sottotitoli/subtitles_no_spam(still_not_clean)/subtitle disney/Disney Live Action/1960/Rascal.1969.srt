1
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:12,765
<i>It was a long time ago...</i>

2
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,098
<i>here in the Wisconsin
of my boyhood...</i>

3
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:17,465
<i>that a new friend
came into my life...</i>

4
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:19,393
<i>and stole my heart away.</i>

5
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:22,808
<i>I often think of him now,
a half a century later...</i>

6
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:26,914
<i>and I relive in memory
the good times we had together.</i>

7
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,740
<i>He was a member
of our family almost...</i>

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,247
<i>for a while anyway...</i>

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>and I shall never forget him.</i>

10
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,172
<i>I wonder if I can
make it as real for you...</i>

11
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,045
<i>as it is for me still.</i>

12
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,448
<i>I wonder if you
can remember the excitement...</i>

13
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,578
<i>of that last day of school...</i>

14
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,350
<i>when everybody could
hardly wait to get out...</i>

15
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:55,359
<i>and enjoy
the long, lazy summer ahead.</i>

16
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,860
<i>And also this summer...</i>

17
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:59,692
my mother's going to teach me
how to use the sewing machine...

18
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,220
and to make upside-down cake.

19
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,826
That sounds like a very
interesting summer, Sarah.

20
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,133
<i>Now, let me see...</i>

21
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,368
<i>whom have I overlooked?</i>

22
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,976
<i>Of course, Lucy.</i>

23
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:18,096
For my vacation,
we're going to New York City.

24
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,710
Well...

25
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:21,872
<i>And my Aunt Elizabeth is
going to take us to the top...</i>

26
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,276
<i>of the Wool worth Building,
sixty stories high!</i>

27
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:27,372
And then we're going to
Central Park and Grant's Tomb...

28
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,058
and the Metropolitan Museum!

29
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,831
That's very exciting, Lucy.
Now--

30
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,271
And then we're going
to Boston and Bunker Hill...

31
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:35,706
and Paul Revere's house.

32
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,641
Lucy, if you tell us
everything now...

33
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,072
there won't be anything left
to tell us next fall.

34
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:42,689
Yes, Miss Whalen.

35
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:45,583
And how about you, Sterling?

36
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey...come to the party.

37
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,615
Sorry, Miss Whalen.

38
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,785
And what kind of excitement...

39
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,437
are you going to stir up
this summer, Sterling?

40
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,488
Well, mostly I'm going
to be working on my canoe.

41
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,363
Canoe? Is that what this is?

42
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:04,198
Yes, ma'am.
It's a design my Pa worked out.

43
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:06,466
From the kind the Indians used.

44
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,972
I'm very impressed.

45
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:11,059
Well, we have only
a few moments more...

46
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:13,243
so I'd like to wish you all
a very pleasant summer.

47
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,390
Be sure that you don't
have any books with you...

48
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:17,905
that should be left behind.

49
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,592
Bye! I'll send you a postcard!

50
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:25,852
Sterling, what else will you
be doing this summer...

51
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,311
besides working on your canoe?

52
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:31,228
Will you be going with your
father on one of his trips?

53
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,730
Well, he goes by himself.

54
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,666
You see, he sells real estate
all over the place.

55
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,411
Well, you don't want
a kid hanging around...

56
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:39,233
when you're doing that.

57
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,898
I see.

58
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,237
Well, you won't be alone.

59
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:44,742
Your sister Theo has been
taking care of things...

60
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:46,438
since your mother
passed away, hasn't she?

61
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:47,844
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,745
But she has to go back
to Chicago tomorrow.

63
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:01,118
Bye, Miss Whalen.
Have a nice summer.

64
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,797
Sterling, I'll be working
at the library this summer...

65
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,232
and you can stop by.

66
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:12,168
Wowser, how are you, boy?
Huh? Ha ha!

67
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,263
Come on, get in there.

68
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:16,536
Pa! Hi, Pa!

69
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:18,202
Sterling!

70
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:20,269
How are you, boy? Ha ha ha!

71
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:23,406
Fine. Theo was afraid
you wouldn't get home in time.

72
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,159
Well, now, she ought
to know better than that.

73
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,947
I always get home, don't it?

74
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:29,420
- Come on, jump in!
- How about my bike?

75
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,685
We'll pick it up later.
I've got something to show you.

76
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:33,988
- Hmm?
- Out at Lake Koshkonong.

77
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,273
Well, what do you think it is?

78
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:41,995
A bobcat?

79
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,601
You're getting warm.

80
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:47,086
You got a rough idea,
haven't you, boy?

81
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:48,943
A panther?

82
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:51,680
A lynx.

83
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,816
They live in Canada.

84
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:56,420
This one lives right here.
At the moment, anyway.

85
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,244
Hasn't been four hours since
he put those tracks there...

86
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,518
<i>and a good size cat it is
from the looks of them.</i>

87
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,366
There he is.

88
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:07,377
Well, you want
to remember that, son.

89
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,707
He's probably the first lynx
in these woods in forty years.

90
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,314
What's he doing
so far from home?

91
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,486
Oh, he's a rambler, I guess.
Like me.

92
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:20,795
Wowser!

93
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,234
Mmm.

94
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,152
Who made it?

95
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:35,022
<i>Farmer's wife in Minnesota.</i>

96
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:38,561
I told her I had a boy
who liked apple pie.

97
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:40,153
Good, isn't it?

98
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:41,859
Mmm.

99
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:47,084
<i>Nighthawks.</i>

100
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,799
Mmm. They're awful busy.

101
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,367
Whippoorwill?

102
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:09,541
Yes. Special kind of bird.

103
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:11,605
To me, anyway.

104
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,373
Your mother and I used to
sit here and listen...

105
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:16,351
to the whippoorwills
a long time ago.

106
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,647
I thought we had all the time
in the world then.

107
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:23,455
If I'd only known
how short it would be...

108
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,202
I might have listened
to her more.

109
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,874
She always wished
I'd settle down...

110
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:30,642
and stop chasing
after farm auctions...

111
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,631
all over the country and...

112
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:35,941
rent that little office
over Pringle's store...

113
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,578
<i>come home for supper
every night...</i>

114
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:40,756
<i>instead of every other week.</i>

115
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:45,287
I always figured I would...
someday.

116
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:48,611
You know, Sterling...

117
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:50,629
it's awfully hard for
the female of the species...

118
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,350
to understand how some men are.

119
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:56,060
I'll bet that lynx has a wife...

120
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:57,956
up in the Canadian woods
somewhere...

121
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,469
with supper
on the table right now...

122
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,295
wondering why he can't come
home every night at 6:00...

123
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,955
like the other lynxes.

124
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,795
Pa?

125
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,136
<i>Yeah?</i>

126
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,008
Don't you ever get lonesome?

127
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,188
No. I got a million things
on my mind.

128
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,804
Miles of country to look at,
people to talk to.

129
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,912
A little fishing on
Sunday afternoon now and then.

130
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,417
<i>The only man
who gets lonesome...</i>

131
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:27,511
<i>is a man who can't live
with himself.</i>

132
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,863
It's a big, wonderful world,
Sterling.

133
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:33,256
You only walk through it once.

134
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:35,746
Wouldn't it be
a terrible mistake...

135
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,150
to come to the end
of the line...

136
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,274
and realize you haven't stopped
along the way...

137
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,922
to smell the flowers?

138
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,916
The lynx!

139
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:16,433
What's he after?

140
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:18,374
A woodchuck or something.

141
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,639
Wowser!

142
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:28,799
Wowser!

143
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,819
Wowser, get off him!

144
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,224
Wowser!

145
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:37,647
Now, I said quit
and I mean quit!

146
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:03,888
Now you know
what she was fighting for.

147
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,658
Serves you right, you big bully.

148
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,684
I don't know why he's got
such a thing about raccoons.

149
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,746
He gets along
with a skunk even...

150
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,913
but there's something
about a raccoon.

151
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,847
Well, it's time
we got on home anyway.

152
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:23,436
Come on, Wowser.

153
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:29,151
Wowser, it's all over.
There's nothing we can do.

154
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,237
Wowser, what's eating you?

155
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:46,915
Well...
look what got left behind.

156
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:59,581
Ha ha ha!

157
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:05,220
Ah! Ha ha!

158
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:12,580
Why did the mother leave him?

159
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:14,989
She probably
doesn't know she has.

160
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,809
She won't find out till she
gets a chance to stop and count.

161
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,564
Well, then this one's sort of lost.

162
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:24,077
Yeah. Looks like it.

163
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,370
<i>Almost
without needing to say it...</i>

164
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,862
<i>Pa and I agreed we couldn't
leave the little fellow...</i>

165
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,767
<i>to fend for himself,
not at his age...</i>

166
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:42,159
<i>and not with the lynx
in the neighborhood.</i>

167
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,743
<i>Besides, we kind of
felt responsible for him.</i>

168
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,108
<i>After all, it was my dog that
had chased his mother away.</i>

169
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,077
<i>I guess Wowser
didn't realize it...</i>

170
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:57,502
<i>but from then on he was going
to have to share my affections.</i>

171
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:02,081
<i>So, that's how it happened...</i>

172
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,180
<i>on that special day in June...</i>

173
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,430
<i>a helpless little orphan
came into my life.</i>

174
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:12,138
<i>I didn't know then how much
he'd come to mean to me...</i>

175
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,151
<i>or the troubles he'd bring.</i>

176
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:19,584
<i>As it turned out,
I had met a character...</i>

177
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:23,491
<i>a personality,
and a ring-tailed wonder.</i>

178
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,030
<i>I called him...</i>

179
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:28,614
Rascal.

180
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:47,114
<i>That day
we came home with Rascal...</i>

181
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:49,520
<i>I remember Walt Dabbett
went sailing by...</i>

182
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:51,563
<i>in his Stanley Steamer.</i>

183
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,796
<i>Pa said he was
a bit of a blowhard...</i>

184
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,765
<i>but not a bad fellow at heart.</i>

185
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:14,456
<i>Cy Jenkins was
our neighbor on the back...</i>

186
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,660
<i>and I swear he spent
more time in his corn patch...</i>

187
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:20,081
<i>than in his drugstore downtown.</i>

188
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:23,224
Anybody home?

189
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:26,781
<i>This was my sister
Theo as she looked then.</i>

190
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,886
<i>She'd come home on her vacation
to take care of us...</i>

191
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:32,457
<i>and for some reason,
she seemed to feel...</i>

192
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,119
<i>one of her duties
was worrying about me--</i>

193
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:38,099
<i>more than I thought necessary.</i>

194
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,513
<i>Our other neighbor,
Garth Shadwick...</i>

195
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,071
<i>was a horse lover.</i>

196
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:47,498
<i>I guess it went with his owning
the town's harness shop.</i>

197
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,144
Afternoon, Garth.

198
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:52,672
Afternoon!

199
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:54,411
Settle down, blast you!

200
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:56,352
Come on, boy! Come on!

201
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:58,812
<i>He had a trotting
horse named Donnybrook--</i>

202
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,902
<i>a nervous, fractious animal.</i>

203
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:04,447
<i>Pa al ways said
it might someday win a race...</i>

204
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:08,522
<i>if it'd ever put all four feet
on the ground at once.</i>

205
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,227
How was the trip, Will?

206
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,894
Oh, never better.

207
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:13,631
Got a new member of the family.

208
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,947
Sterling,
bring him around here...

209
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:17,202
and introduce him
to Mr. Jenkins.

210
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:19,994
- He's a raccoon.
- So I see.

211
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:23,158
Garth! You best come here!

212
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,892
Go! Ah, you show-off!

213
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,982
Bah.

214
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,716
Is something wrong, Mr. Jenkins?

215
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:33,031
Raccoons are varmints, son,
and varmints are trouble.

216
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,518
I'm gonna educate him.

217
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:36,048
<i>Train the varmint out of him.</i>

218
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:37,253
Ooh-hoo.

219
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:39,159
Good to see you back again,
Willard.

220
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:40,891
What's all the hollerin' about?

221
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,091
Look.

222
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,529
That's a raccoon!

223
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,901
Yes, sir. His name's Rascal.

224
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:49,906
Well, what about my chickens?

225
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,066
And my corn patch?

226
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,269
I'm gonna train the varmint
out of him.

227
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,801
- Oh ho.
- Just what I said.

228
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:02,191
And there's another problem.

229
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:03,646
Hambone's a coon hound.

230
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,299
I suppose you know that,
Sterling.

231
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:08,291
Yes, sir, but, well,
I think he'll be reasonable...

232
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,580
as long as Wowser's around.

233
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:11,859
Uh, excuse me.

234
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,802
We don't want
to be unreasonable, Sterling...

235
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:15,362
but facts are facts, now.

236
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:17,499
And the facts are this
just isn't going to work out!

237
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,408
<i>Varmints are varmints,
Sterling.</i>

238
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,833
<i>You can't train it out of them.</i>

239
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,569
<i>Not in a thousand years!</i>

240
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,209
Hey! Grab him, Sterling!

241
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,302
That horse spooks
at a butterfly.

242
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,604
I'm a son of a gun.

243
00:16:57,072 --> 00:17:00,244
Well, he was supposed
to be a coon hound.

244
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,016
Heh heh.

245
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,691
Hi. I had a wonderful trip
this time out.

246
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,480
Springtime up north
is really something.

247
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,159
That smells good.

248
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:30,072
All right.

249
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,811
You may fire
when ready, Gridley.

250
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,381
Papa...

251
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,423
my leave is up.

252
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,189
I'm due back at work on Monday.

253
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,593
That means the morning train
to Chicago.

254
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,595
Is that a problem?

255
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:51,363
Papa, what are we going to do
about Sterling?

256
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,158
Do about him?

257
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:55,466
Do about him!
What's to happen to him...

258
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:58,169
with me gone
and you off who knows where?

259
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,086
Oh, Sterling
can take care of himself.

260
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,398
Papa, he's only a boy.

261
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,920
You can't leave him alone
to fend for himself.

262
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:08,383
Why not? I did.

263
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:12,996
You'd think after all these
years I'd be used to you.

264
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:18,449
I've written it all down.

265
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,792
The laundry boy'll
pick up on Wednesday...

266
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:23,960
Mr. Pringle will deliver
groceries twice a week...

267
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,833
newspaper's paid
through the first--

268
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,609
You should have been
born a top sergeant.

269
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,315
Which brings us
to the housekeeper.

270
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:30,807
Housekeeper? What for?

271
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,245
To keep house. I ran an ad.
And I got these replies.

272
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,243
I wanted to interview
them myself...

273
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:41,554
but there just isn't time now,
so I've got to leave it to you.

274
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:45,014
That's my first choice.
Spoke to her on the telephone.

275
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,487
Mrs. Satterfield.

276
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,542
"Purest gold."

277
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,360
She's a widow,
she lives in Brailsford...

278
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:52,693
knows all the merchants.

279
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,096
She raised a big family
in the Dakotas somewhere.

280
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,355
Well, I've got a better idea.

281
00:18:57,532 --> 00:18:59,209
Why don't you give up
that job in Chicago...

282
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,862
and come home to stay?

283
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,497
This is where you belong.

284
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:06,798
Oh, Papa...

285
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,532
you know I can't do that.

286
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:13,545
You really stuck
on that guy Norman up there?

287
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:16,470
Yes, Papa, I am.

288
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:17,709
Serious?

289
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:20,355
About as serious as you can get.

290
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:23,189
He wants me to go up to
Appleton and meet his family.

291
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,788
A nervy kind of a fella,
swiping my favorite daughter...

292
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,533
without so much
as a by-your-leave.

293
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,628
How are we gonna get along
without you?

294
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:35,999
Papa, I'm trying,
in my own clumsy way...

295
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,530
to take care of that.

296
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,976
Now, I want you to talk to these
applicants and make a decision.

297
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:43,037
Right. Don't you think
it's about time...

298
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,605
we got a look at him?

299
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:46,879
Maybe. First thing Monday?

300
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,852
- First thing Monday.
- OK.

301
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,216
I tell you what...

302
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,079
why don't you bring him home
for Thanksgiving?

303
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,354
I've got the biggest turkey
you ever saw in your life...

304
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:57,785
all staked out down in Illinois.

305
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,589
Guy owes me some money
down there.

306
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,893
Fella named McQuade.

307
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,559
Gave me the pick of the flock.

308
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,262
Just said, "Go out and pick
your Thanksgiving bird...

309
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:06,736
"and I'll put your name on it."

310
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,695
How about it?

311
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:10,382
I don't know.

312
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,735
Don't know what?

313
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,053
Norman comes
from a...different world.

314
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:16,376
He might have
a little trouble...

315
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,109
understanding
about Mr. McQuade...

316
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:20,174
and taking out
real estate commissions...

317
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,776
in turkeys and apple pies...

318
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:23,663
and about your other
comings and goings.

319
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:26,716
Now, don't you worry
about that, Theodora North.

320
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:29,653
You just bring that boy
home for Thanksgiving.

321
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:31,182
You sure you'll be here?

322
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:32,994
You can bet your hat on it.

323
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:35,194
I haven't missed
a Thanksgiving at home since--

324
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:37,023
Since last year.

325
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:41,999
I didn't miss it.
I was just a little late is all.

326
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:43,809
I know.

327
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,832
So we sat down without you,
and we had our dinner...

328
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:51,421
and it was the last ever with
Mama, and you weren't there.

329
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:53,243
I won't miss this one.

330
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,286
How about it?

331
00:20:57,618 --> 00:20:58,898
I'll see.

332
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:01,989
Now, remember, this one.

333
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,390
Miss Satterly.

334
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:06,837
Satterfield, and it's "Mrs."

335
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,387
Don't forget now.

336
00:21:08,624 --> 00:21:10,194
OK, Sarge.

337
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:27,051
You must understand,
Mr. North...

338
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:30,459
your daughter made
no mention of a menagerie...

339
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,520
no mention whatsoever.

340
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:33,895
Well, Mrs. Satterfield...

341
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,442
I'm sure she wasn't
trying to conceal--

342
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,627
Naturally, naturally...

343
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,227
but we must be honest
with each other, Mr. North.

344
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,762
Utterly and completely honest.

345
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:42,966
<i>Of course.</i>

346
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,908
Right from the beginning.

347
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,209
I couldn't agree
with you more, but--

348
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,725
<i>We must face facts.</i>

349
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:52,687
Some people have a feeling
for animals, others do not.

350
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:54,631
I do not.

351
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,751
Well, that's too bad.

352
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:59,222
<i>I have managed to live
my life without them...</i>

353
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,734
<i>and they without me.</i>

354
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,259
I'm afraid it's too late
to change.

355
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:07,013
<i>Houses are for people...</i>

356
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:09,257
and the woods are for animals.

357
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:11,735
But you're an animal,
Mrs. Satterfield.

358
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:12,930
Beg pardon? What?

359
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:16,236
People are animals.
It's a zoological fact.

360
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,494
Animals are not people.

361
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:20,940
You have me there.

362
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:23,641
I'm not even sure
they want to be.

363
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,149
I'll be happy
to report immediately...

364
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:31,379
but the raccoon--out.

365
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:37,309
Any other livestock,
fur, fins, or feathers--out.

366
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:42,329
- Out.
- Out?!

367
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:43,561
Out!

368
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,331
But, Pa--

369
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,804
Sterling, why don't you
take Rascal and Wowser...

370
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:50,171
into the kitchen
and give them their supper?

371
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:51,436
Yes, sir, but--

372
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:53,535
Go ahead, son.

373
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:56,043
Yes, sir.

374
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:58,041
Good night, Mrs. Satterfield.

375
00:22:58,215 --> 00:22:59,979
Come on, Wowser.

376
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:08,793
Oh, I'll be happy to take over
if those conditions are met.

377
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,588
Thank you, Miss Satterly.

378
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:14,037
Satterfield, and it's "Mrs."

379
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,331
Ah, yes, "Mrs."

380
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:24,584
A pleasure, Mr. North.
A genuine pleasure.

381
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:30,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

382
00:24:11,587 --> 00:24:14,691
Well, Sarah,
I've got a decision to make.

383
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:16,713
Who will it be?

384
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,803
Mrs. Satterfield?

385
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:32,055
She'd break your son's heart.

386
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,393
How about Mrs. Delaney?

387
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,679
The sad one?

388
00:24:44,277 --> 00:24:45,836
Or Miss Endicott?

389
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:51,147
Abigail. Good influence.

390
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:55,554
Or Mrs. Mc-what's-her-name?

391
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,004
Trouble is, you've left
footsteps that nobody can fill--

392
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:12,406
light and quick and tiny--

393
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:15,333
but nobody can fill them.

394
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:35,319
<i>So we decided
to keep house for ourselves.</i>

395
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:37,930
<i>Not the way Theo
would have wanted, maybe...</i>

396
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:40,746
<i>but the arrangement suited us.</i>

397
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,305
<i>And, for the moment,
we agreed that, uh...</i>

398
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,777
<i>what she didn't know
wouldn't hurt her.</i>

399
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,236
<i>There's a pot of stew...</i>

400
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:49,469
cooking on the back of
the stove for tonight's supper.

401
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:52,162
Cy said for you to come over and
have Sunday dinner with them.

402
00:25:52,187 --> 00:25:53,519
Yes, sir, I know.

403
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:56,674
Oh, you're off to a good start
on that canoe, son.

404
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,943
I still haven't figured out
a way to bend the ribs.

405
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,353
Well, best way would be
to soak 'em, I guess.

406
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:04,018
I've got to get started.

407
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,913
I've got one hundred miles
to make before dark.

408
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:12,191
Garth!

409
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:14,213
- Pa?
- Huh?

410
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:16,176
What's it like
up where you're going?

411
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:21,219
Lake Superior?
Oh, big as an ocean.

412
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:23,772
<i>Deep blue color...</i>

413
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:27,338
dark green pines
along the shore...

414
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,646
<i>gulls hollering overhead...</i>

415
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:33,744
the Apostle Islands
off in the distance.

416
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:36,989
<i>A pretty wonderful place.</i>

417
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:40,082
When you grow up,
it's a place for you to see.

418
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:42,270
Yes, sir. When I grow up.

419
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:45,122
Set the spark, will you, son?

420
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:46,673
<i>Garth!</i>

421
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,902
You leavin' already, Willard?

422
00:26:51,938 --> 00:26:54,340
Yeah. I got a long way to go.

423
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:57,405
Remember, Sterling,
if anything comes up...

424
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,410
you hustle right over to Garth.

425
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,424
Yes, sir.

426
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,476
Be gone a week,
ten days at the most.

427
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,498
- So long, partner.
- So long, Pa.

428
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,607
You want to stay over
at my place tonight, Sterling?

429
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,955
I'll be OK.

430
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:38,256
You know, Sterling,
one of these days...

431
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,444
he's gonna take you
along with him.

432
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,670
Yes, sir.

433
00:27:57,621 --> 00:27:59,295
<i>At suppertime that evening...</i>

434
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:01,773
<i>I thought about Pa
and his Apostle Islands...</i>

435
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:04,277
<i>and Lake Superior,
big as an ocean...</i>

436
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:08,077
<i>and I wished I was there
riding along with him.</i>

437
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:20,015
<i>Remembering
it all now, I realize...</i>

438
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,223
<i>it was the first time
I'd ever been left alone.</i>

439
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:26,232
<i>And I must say,
that big, rambling house...</i>

440
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:28,234
<i>felt kind of empty.</i>

441
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,640
<i>"Sterling, dear...</i>

442
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,149
<i>"I'll bet you're having
the time of your life now...</i>

443
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:38,211
<i>"with summer vacation
in full swing...</i>

444
00:28:38,244 --> 00:28:40,042
<i>"and all the things
that Brailsford offers...</i>

445
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,275
<i>"a boy your age.</i>

446
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:44,784
<i>"Papa wrote you've solved
the housekeeper problem...</i>

447
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,843
<i>"but he didn't say how.</i>

448
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,140
<i>"I'm assuming
it's Mrs. Satterfield.</i>

449
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:52,338
<i>"I do feel she's right for you.</i>

450
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,659
<i>"Busy as you are, you still
need someone around...</i>

451
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:56,228
<i>"to sit down to meals with...</i>

452
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:59,555
<i>"someone to talk
to and confide in.</i>

453
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:03,334
<i>"Papa's probably somewhere
over the horizon by now...</i>

454
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:04,980
<i>"and since I don't know
where to reach him...</i>

455
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:06,199
<i>"I'll ask you.</i>

456
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:09,652
<i>"How's Mrs. Satterfield
working out?"</i>

457
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,348
<i>"Dear Theo.
Nice to get your letter.</i>

458
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:14,141
<i>"Pa's off on one
of his trips again...</i>

459
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,264
<i>"and Rascal 's
growing like a weed.</i>

460
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:18,580
<i>"Did you know a raccoon
could ride a bicycle?</i>

461
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:20,131
<i>"Well, not really.</i>

462
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:21,826
<i>"I do the steering
and the pumping...</i>

463
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:23,288
<i>"and all the hard work...</i>

464
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:25,314
<i>"and Rascal sits up front
and gives orders.</i>

465
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:28,580
<i>"You should see him.
He's a real speed demon.</i>

466
00:29:28,618 --> 00:29:31,281
<i>"Keeps telling me
to go faster and faster."</i>

467
00:29:37,797 --> 00:29:40,369
<i>"Dear Theo.
I suppose you knew...</i>

468
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:43,070
<i>"that raccoons can swim.
It comes kind of natural.</i>

469
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,241
<i>"I had Rascal
down to the creek today...</i>

470
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:46,918
<i>"and first time in
he took to the water...</i>

471
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:48,380
<i>"as though he had webbed feet.</i>

472
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:50,849
<i>"I think he could swim rings
around even Wowser...</i>

473

<i>"if he wanted to.</i>

474
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,820
<i>"Wowser sends his regards,

475
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:56,152

476
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:58,817
<i>"Your loving brother,
Sterling North."</i>

477
00:29:59,154 --> 00:30:01,859
<i>"Sterling, dear,
do you read my letters?</i>

478
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:03,927

<i>"that you still haven't
answered the question...</i>

00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:07,318

481
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:09,861

getting along?"</i>

482
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,842

<i>"You wouldn't believe it.</i>

485

<i>"at least I thought I had
until they disqualified me...</i>

489

<i>"It was his idea, not mine.
What a gyp!</i>

a--a special prize...</i>

493

how is Mrs. Satterfield?!"</i>

How are you, Mrs. Satterfield?

509
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,500
Fine. Just fine.

<i>I couldn't seem
to make Theo understand...</i>

515

<i>that everything
was fine at home...</i>

516
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:43,595

517
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:47,338

had so many adventures...</i>

518

520
00:31:52,948 --> 00:31:55,645
<i>exploring the back roads,
wandering the woods...</i>

521
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:58,549
<i>and learning new things
every day.</i>

522
00:31:58,821 --> 00:32:02,314
<i>I'll bet we knew every
bird nest and fox's den...</i>

523
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,917
<i>and rabbit burrow
for miles around.</i>

524
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:09,523
<i>Looking back now, I realize
that people worried about us.</i>

525
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:12,125
<i>But we didn't worry.
We were too busy.</i>

526
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,227
<i>The fact of the matter was...</i>

527
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:18,206
<i>it was turning into the most
wonderful summer of my life.</i>

528
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:25,395
<i>♪ Summer sweet was green,

00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:31,020

<i>♪ Don't you be late,

546
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,260
<i>Lots of things
happened that summer.</i>

547
00:34:57,299 --> 00:34:59,734
<i>I remember one morning
Garth gave Rascal and me...</i>

548
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:01,236
<i>a ride in his sulky.</i>

549
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:04,068
<i>You should have seen
Donnybrook go.</i>

550
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:07,133
<i>Garth said he was showing off
for his little friend.</i>

551
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:21,056
<i>Suddenly
Walt Dabbett came along...</i>

552
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:22,990
<i>in that noisy contraption
of his...</i>

553
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:25,358
<i>and it threw Donnybrook
all off stride.</i>

554
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:35,936
Whoa! Whoa, boy! Whoa!

555
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:39,335
Whoa, Donnybrook!
Easy, easy, easy!

556
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:42,293
Dang fool!

557
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:45,143
<i>And so that summer sped by...</i>

558
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:48,014
<i>Rascal getting fatter
and lazier...</i>

559
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,246
<i>I getting on with my canoe.</i>

560
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:53,778
<i>I had finally come up with
a great idea for the ribs--</i>

561
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:57,020
<i>the hoops from Mr. Pringle's
cheese boxes.</i>

562
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,618
<i>That summer, I might add...</i>

563
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,459
<i>I cornered the market
on empty cheese boxes...</i>

564
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:04,364
<i>and the canoe
was coming along nicely.</i>

565
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:09,708
<i>Meanwhile, it seemed...</i>

566
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:12,075
<i>Rascal had some schemes
of his own.</i>

567
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:19,942
<i>I don't know when
it came to his attention...</i>

568
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,578
<i>but somewhere along the line...</i>

569
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,317
<i>he had made a little note
for future reference--</i>

570
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:27,137
<i>there was corn
growing next door.</i>

571
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:51,077
Hey!

572
00:36:51,116 --> 00:36:53,551
My cornfield! Go on!
Get out of there!

573
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,748
Get him, get him, get him, Ham!

574
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:58,257
<i>Get out of here!
Get out of my cornfield!</i>

575
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,589
You miserable varmint!
Get him, Ham!

576
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,527
Go on, get him!
Get him! Get him!

577
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,827
If I get my hands on you--
gotcha now!

578
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:08,299
I gotcha, you miserable varmint!

579
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,570
<i>Sorry, Mr. Jenkins.</i>

580
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,939
I don't know what got into him.

581
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,513
My corn!
That's what got into him!

582
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,440
- Ohh!
- Yes, sir.

583
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:26,577
Anybody else, they'd shoot him!

584
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,929
<i>And that's just
what's gonna happen...</i>

585
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:29,649
<i>if you don't
do something about it!</i>

586
00:37:29,688 --> 00:37:31,054
Shoot him?

587
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,924
Mine ain't the only
corn patch in this town.

588
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:36,690
Now, you better just
straighten out that varmint.

589
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:38,527
Or get rid of him!

590
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:40,430
<i>I didn't
realize it just then...</i>

591
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,026
<i>but my troubles
were only beginning.</i>

592
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,470
<i>Making Cy Jenkins mad at me
was bad enough...</i>

593
00:37:46,505 --> 00:37:49,839
<i>but that afternoon a new
problem arrived in my life.</i>

594
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:53,971
<i>It was my teacher and the new
minister coming to call.</i>

595
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:57,843
This is the house,
is it not, Miss Whalen?

596
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:59,749
Uh, yes. Yes, it is.

597
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,686
I hope I made myself clear,
Miss Whalen.

598
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:11,050
Of course.

599
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:13,656
There's a difference between
unwarranted interference...

600
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,099
and Christian concern.

601
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:16,762
Yes, but--the thing is...

602
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,828
the boy's doing fine work
in school.

603
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:20,533
He's healthy and--

604
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:23,406
- And happy?
- Well, I've always thought so.

605
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:24,671
Oh, come now, Miss Whalen.

606
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,202
You aren't suggesting
this is a suitable existence?

607
00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:29,875
A boy his age living alone
without parental guidance?

608
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:31,508
Well, it does seem unusual,
but--

609
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,746
Indeed it does, Miss Whalen.
Indeed it does.

610
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,954
- Miss Whalen.
- Good afternoon, Sterling.

611
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:40,721
Sterling,
I'd like you to meet...

612
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:42,455
our new minister,
Reverend Thurman.

613
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:43,860
How do you do?

614
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:45,194
Hello, Sterling.

615
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:49,058
This is Rascal, my raccoon.

616
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:50,865
Yes.

617
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:56,884
Uh...we were just passing by,
and we thought we would drop in.

618
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:59,276
Oh, well, I'm glad you did.
Come on in.

619
00:38:59,311 --> 00:39:01,141
There's something
I'd like to show you.

620
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:02,838
Well, thank you, Sterling.

621
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:04,587
We won't stay
more than a minute.

622
00:39:07,473 --> 00:39:09,339
Uh-oh.
I've gotta clean these.

623
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:12,644
I've been kind of busy.
Come on in the kitchen.

624
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:25,563
Is that a canoe?

625
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,370
His project for the summer.

626
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:31,673
Yes.

627
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,852
I'll just be a second.

628
00:39:41,053 --> 00:39:43,318
Now, you see,
I've got a problem.

629
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,689
Rascal's been getting in
a little bit of trouble lately.

630
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:49,559
So I've got to, uh,
de-raccoonify him.

631
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,858
I beg your pardon?

632
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,728
Well, I've got to get Rascal...

633
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,757
<i>to stop thinking
like a raccoon...</i>

634
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,564
and start thinking
like a person.

635
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,400
I've been working on him.

636
00:39:58,631 --> 00:39:59,803
Watch.

637
00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:05,438
Rascal...stay.

638
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,948
<i>Rascal, come.</i>

639
00:40:13,018 --> 00:40:14,281
<i>No!</i>

640
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:18,983
<i>Ah! That's better.</i>

641
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:22,752
<i>Ah! No!</i>

642
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:26,220
The flesh is weak,
but the spirit's willing.

643
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:29,094
<i>That's it.</i>

644
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:32,059
<i>Ah! That's it.</i>

645
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:34,297
<i>Ah!</i>

646
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:36,133
That's it!

647
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:38,218
Good boy. See?

648
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:42,071
- How very interesting.
- A giant step.

649
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:43,412
When I get through with him...

650
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:45,212
he's gonna be
the world's greatest raccoon.

651
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,742
Aren't you, Rascal?
Here, let's get a marshmallow.

652
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:49,846
Have a marshmallow. There.

653
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:52,489
- Sterling...
- Hmm?

654
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:55,394
Don't get too fond of him.

655
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,269
What do you mean?

656
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,029
Well, he won't always be young.

657
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:03,695
There'll come a day
when old Mother Nature...

658
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:07,059
will reach across your shoulder
and tap his ear.

659
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:10,022
And he'll tell you
that it's time to go.

660
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:11,276
Ah, no.

661
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:12,938
Yes.

662
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,379
That's the way things are,
Sterling.

663
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,974
Rascal wouldn't leave me.

664
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:20,303
He--he's part of the family.

665
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:22,577
Yes, which brings us to why--

666
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,410
It's Pa!

667
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:31,104
Hi, Pa!

668
00:41:31,147 --> 00:41:33,378
Hello there, son.
How'd things go?

669
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,816
Fine. Oh, we got company.

670
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:37,218
Great. Well, we had
a big harvest up north.

671
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:40,712
Not much money, but the crops
were comin' out their ears.

672
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:43,163
- Who's the company?
- Uh, the Reverend.

673
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:45,428
Oh, great. Reverend who?

674
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:48,090
Thurman. Gabriel Thurman.

675
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:51,366
Oh, heh heh. Willard North.

676
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:53,836
- How do you do, Reverend?
- Real pleasure, Mr. Nor--

677
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:56,681
Real pleasure, Mr. North.

678
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:59,169
I'm taking over
at the Methodist church...

679
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:01,681
and I thought
I'd look in on Sterling.

680
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:04,162
Well, you couldn't have come
at a better time.

681
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:07,012
And Miss Whalen!
Well, this is a double pleasure.

682
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:12,916
Yes, sir, you couldn't
have come at a better time.

683
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:14,423
You'll both stay to dinner.

684
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:16,537
- No, really--
- No, no, we couldn't.

685
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:18,104
Oh, you have to, Reverend.

686
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:19,859
We've got so much food here...

687
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,689
it'd be against
the Scriptures to waste.

688
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,460
You leave me without a defense.

689
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,729
Now, you can see
that I'm sort of...

690
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:30,296
on the barter system these days.

691
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,308
The only way to operate
in the farm country.

692
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,207
There's a farmer up north
owes me commission.

693
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:37,680
He had no money, so I'm taking
it out in geese and apple pie.

694
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:39,705
Miss Whalen, would you just
put a pot on to boil?

695
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:42,462
Get us a mess of turnips
and potatoes, will you?

696
00:42:42,785 --> 00:42:44,754
How are you
at plucking a goose, Reverend?

697
00:42:44,787 --> 00:42:45,948
Well, I don't know.

698
00:42:45,988 --> 00:42:47,650
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

699
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:49,517
There's a clothes basket
there on the back porch.

700
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:50,597
I beg your pardon?

701
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:52,822
For the feathers.
Sterling, get it, will you?

702
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:53,888
<i>Sure, Pa.</i>

703
00:42:53,913 --> 00:42:55,825
<i>Rascal, I better get you
out of the way.</i>

704
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:59,233
We were just a little concerned
over Sterling being alone...

705
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:01,601
for prolonged periods
while you're off--

706
00:43:01,637 --> 00:43:03,367
The little old lady
who makes that cider...

707
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:05,637
has an apple orchard
up out of Duluth.

708
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:07,268
McGreevy Marvels.

709
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,717
While you're off
on your business trips--

710
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:11,070
Nothing else,
just McGreevy Marvels.

711
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:12,582
I always make it a practice...

712
00:43:12,615 --> 00:43:14,277
to sort of stop by
and help her out.

713
00:43:14,317 --> 00:43:15,478
It occurred to me...

714
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,096
that the church might be
of some assistance to--

715
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:18,351
McWho?

716
00:43:18,419 --> 00:43:20,322
McGreevy. McGreevy Marvels.

717
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:21,984
100%.

718
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,732
Well, the point that
I'm trying to make is--

719
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:25,257
Thank you--the point
I'm trying to make--

720
00:43:25,294 --> 00:43:27,287
I'll take
your bag upstairs, Pa.

721
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:28,609
Thank you, Sterling.

722
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:30,300
The point is
we have this committee--

723
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,632
You don't run into cider
like that every day.

724
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,534
Whose duty it is is to act--

725
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,334
Look at that color.

726
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:39,399
You put the right kind of
squeeze on a McGreevy Marvel...

727
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,503
bottle it with loving care,
set it in a stone cellar...

728
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:45,310
for just
the right number of weeks...

729
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:46,877
there you are.

730
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:50,681
You sure this isn't...

731
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,154
Sneaky?

732
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:55,647
Oh, Parson, if you only knew
the dear old soul who makes it.

733
00:43:55,691 --> 00:43:57,523
To the dear old soul.

734
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,767
Hear, hear.

735
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,703
Mmm.

736
00:44:21,694 --> 00:44:25,222
The finest canoe water
in the whole world out there.

737
00:44:25,264 --> 00:44:26,926
Unbelievable.

738
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:31,211
A man can travel a hundred
miles without a portage.

739
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,402
Sterling, how you coming
with that pie?

740
00:44:33,441 --> 00:44:35,130
OK, Pa.

741
00:44:35,623 --> 00:44:37,182
Rascal, that's not for you.

742
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,534
<i>How about some more cider?</i>

743
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:42,865
- I couldn't.
- Oh, please.

744
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:44,513
A little bit.

745
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,950
Whoo.

746
00:44:46,137 --> 00:44:47,247
Ha ha ha!

747
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:49,380
Remarkable. Remarkable.

748
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:51,908
Isn't it? Ahh.

749
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:55,639
Garvey Meevals. Oh!

750
00:44:59,516 --> 00:45:02,860
What would there be about this
particular breed of apple...

751
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:05,463
that makes its juice so...

752
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,154
- Crisp?
- Very good. Crisp it is.

753
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:11,967
Very crisp. Very, very crisp.

754
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:14,525
You know, it was a seedling.

755
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:17,099
It came up in the orchard
of a man named McGreevy.

756
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:19,243
The tree's still there,
still bearing fruit...

757
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:21,567
<i>seventy, eighty years later.</i>

758
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:23,424
Eighty years.

759
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,486
And still going strong.

760
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:30,854
To the very
first McGreevy Marvel.

761
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:33,412
Hear, hear.

762
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:35,096
Very crisp.

763
00:45:35,138 --> 00:45:37,004
Now, I want you to pay
particular attention...

764
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,303
to this pie.

765
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:40,619
Sterling, there's a wedge of
sharp cheddar in the icebox.

766
00:45:40,644 --> 00:45:41,873
Get it, will you, son?

767
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:47,289
Wisconsin cheddar
makes apple pie something else.

768
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:51,086
There we are, Miss Whalen.

769
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:54,339
<i>This is
very special apple pie...</i>

770
00:45:54,414 --> 00:45:56,246
<i>Very special, indeed.</i>

771
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,881
<i>Farmer's wife in
northern Minnesota makes it.</i>

772
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,602
<i>It's like nothing
you ever tasted before.</i>

773
00:46:01,732 --> 00:46:03,998
<i>There we are, Sterling.</i>

774
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:07,355
<i>Bite yourself off a piece
of that cheese, Reverend.</i>

775
00:46:19,702 --> 00:46:23,639
You're 100% right
about that pie, Mr. North.

776
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:27,553
Make it Willard, Pars.

777
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:31,195
Willard. Perfectly marvelous!

778
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:34,281
You missed quite
a demonstration tonight.

779
00:46:34,385 --> 00:46:36,445
- Oh?
- Sterling and his raccoon.

780
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:37,899
Oh, you should see him, Pa!

781
00:46:37,935 --> 00:46:40,131
I've got him so he won't
even look at an ear of corn.

782
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,270
Well, I certainly hope so, son.

783
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:45,536
It's true.
He's 100% de-raccoonified.

784
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:47,729
De-raccoonified?

785
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,361
I must say, there's a word
I'm not familiar with either.

786
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:54,675
Perhaps it should be
un-varmint-ized.

787
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:56,653
Well, it's all new to me.

788
00:46:56,908 --> 00:46:59,282
They don't use the term
down in Indianapolis.

789
00:46:59,506 --> 00:47:03,256
Well, it opens up a fruitful
field of speculation.

790
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,823
You are right.

791
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:09,691
Who among us are to be marked
for un-varmint-ization?

792
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,436
Raccoons are varmints
to people...

793
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:16,434
but people are varmints
to raccoons.

794
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:20,604
If raccoons were running things,
would they go running around...

795
00:47:20,644 --> 00:47:22,510
hollering people out
of their corn patches?

796
00:47:22,546 --> 00:47:24,399
And wear people-skin caps?

797
00:47:24,557 --> 00:47:25,694
<i>You're right.</i>

798
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:28,909
Where, in short,
does justice lie?

799
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,017
<i>Wowser, cut it out!</i>

800
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,221
<i>- What's going on?
- I don't know!</i>

801
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,049
<i>Things seemed
to be going from bad to worse.</i>

802
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:13,371
<i>First corn, now eggs.</i>

803
00:48:13,498 --> 00:48:16,696
<i>Where would
Rascal 's appetite stop?</i>

804
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,821
<i>The young minister
had meant well, I'm sure.</i>

805
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:22,231
<i>I suppose he had hoped
he could reform Pa...</i>

806
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,859
<i>and maybe me, too...</i>

807
00:48:24,036 --> 00:48:26,883
<i>but I don't think he knew
what kind of a sinner...</i>

808
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,338
<i>he was up against in Rascal.</i>

809
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:39,981
<i>Night after night...</i>

810
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:42,487
<i>that sneak went out
on his expeditions...</i>

811
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,321
<i>picking locks, outguessing us
every step of the way.</i>

812
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,926
<i>There was a night Mrs. Folger
caught a burglar...</i>

813
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,624
<i>in her jam cupboard--</i>

814
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:55,190
<i>a burglar
in a little black mask.</i>

815
00:48:57,121 --> 00:49:01,102
<i>Next day I made sure that exit
was permanently closed.</i>

816
00:49:01,174 --> 00:49:04,132
<i>He wouldn't go out that way
again--and he didn't.</i>

817
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:08,791
<i>He went out the attic--
the super second-story worker.</i>

818
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:11,340
<i>His next job
was the molasses caper...</i>

819
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:13,684
<i>in Mrs. Krause's kitchen.</i>

820
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,444
<i>The only clue
she had were fingerprints--</i>

821
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:19,082
<i>raccoon fingerprints
leading away...</i>

822
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,213
<i>from the scene of the crime.</i>

823
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:25,705
<i>It was like locking the barn
after the horse was gone.</i>

824
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:29,708
<i>Rascal simply found
another escape hatch.</i>

825
00:49:30,588 --> 00:49:32,359
<i>And another...</i>

826
00:49:33,157 --> 00:49:34,904
<i>and still another...</i>

827
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:39,193
<i>and yet another.
There was no holding him.</i>

828
00:49:42,628 --> 00:49:45,223
<i>And so it really
came as no surprise...</i>

829
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:48,645
<i>when the long arm of the law
reached for me.</i>

830
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:50,100
Sterling.

831
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:51,848
Hi, Mr. Stacey.

832
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,358
I've been lookin' for you.

833
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:56,047
I'm afraid you and I are gonna
have to have a little talk.

834
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,862
Yes, sir?

835
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:00,420
Now, I've had complaints.

836
00:50:01,614 --> 00:50:03,503
I don't know
if you're aware of it...

837
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:06,174
but what we're facing here
is a misdemeanor.

838
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:07,341
A misde-what?

839
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,873
Meanor. A misdemeanor.

840
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:12,115
That's a violation, Sterling.
A violation of the law.

841
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,884
Has that animal got a license?

842
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:18,127
No, sir, but I've got him tied.
He's on a leash.

843
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:20,945
I don't write the laws, son.
I just enforce them.

844
00:50:21,044 --> 00:50:24,173
- But, Mr. Stacey--
- As they are set down.

845
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,633
Now, here.

846
00:50:28,049 --> 00:50:30,267
Municipal code,
section fourteen.

847
00:50:30,308 --> 00:50:32,571
"Public nuisance."

848
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,342
Paragraph five--
"Keeping of animals."

849
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:38,557
"Keeping of animals
other than farm stock...

850
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:41,023
"and household pets
shall be forbidden...

851
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:43,154
"unless strictly confined."

852
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,588
That means kept in a cage.

853
00:50:45,934 --> 00:50:48,460
"Violation shall be
punishable by--"

854
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:08,435
Hey! Look out!

855
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:15,486
Walt Dabbett,
you're a four-alarm lunatic!

856
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,886
- Take it easy, Cy.
- What do you mean, take it easy?

857
00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:19,481
Why take it easy?
I nearly got killed!

858
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:21,253
What seems to be
the trouble here?

859
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:23,056
Seems to be?
Well, you seen it!

860
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:25,063
Practically run me down
with that steam kettle!

861
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:27,190
Minor navigational error.

862
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,723
<i>Law-abiding citizen
ain't safe in this town...</i>

863
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:30,928
<i>with nuts like you!</i>

864
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:32,368
What's going on?

865
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:37,740
My hitchin' posts!
Look at my hitchin' posts!

866
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:41,143
Hand-carved, both of 'em!

867
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:42,356
If they hadn't
been standing there...

868
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,557
I wouldn't have
knocked them over.

869
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:45,015
They don't even belong there.

870
00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:46,745
They belong in
some old-fogey museum.

871
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:47,911
What do you mean museum?

872
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:49,263
<i>Are you afraid of the truth?</i>

873
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:52,219
<i>Why don't you face it?
The age of the horse is over.</i>

874
00:51:52,323 --> 00:51:54,758
- Over?!
- Finished.

875
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:56,869
<i>- Is that so?
- That is most certainly so.</i>

876
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,438
Listen, I got a horse
that can outrun...

877
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:00,727
that puffin' billy
of yours sorefoot...

878
00:52:00,765 --> 00:52:02,825
and pulling a flatbed wagon
with square wheels.

879
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:04,244
Are you trying to tell me
you got a horse...

880
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:06,828
can stand up to a steam car?
You're not that crazy.

881
00:52:06,871 --> 00:52:10,103
I'll stand up to you any day
in the week, Barney Oldfield!

882
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:11,473
Now, hold back.

883
00:52:11,509 --> 00:52:14,001
A race might be violatin'
the municipal code.

884
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:15,673
<i>A race? Garth!</i>

885
00:52:15,713 --> 00:52:18,080
<i>Put up or shut up,
unless you ain't got the spunk!</i>

886
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:19,359
<i>I got the spunk all right...</i>

887
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:21,045
<i>and I got the money
to back it up with.</i>

888
00:52:21,085 --> 00:52:23,111
Name it! Ten? Twenty?

889
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:25,020
Five...hundred.

890
00:52:25,056 --> 00:52:26,957
Five hundred?

891
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,262
And I'll even give you two to
one to spark your convictions.

892
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,410
- We'll take it!
- Garth!

893
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,823
<i>Tomorrow, 2:00,
Miller's picnic grove.</i>

894
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:38,460
Afternoon, Mr. Pringle.

895
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:40,494
Afternoon, Mrs. Beck.
Be with you in a minute.

896
00:52:40,538 --> 00:52:42,871
- No hurry.
- Anything else, Mrs. Folger?

897
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:44,718
<i>No.
That's everything on the list.</i>

898
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:46,074
<i>Afternoon, Mrs. Beck.</i>

899
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,669
<i>Lovely day.</i>

900
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,255
You're sure that's all,
Mrs. Folger?

901
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,909
<i>- Oh, yes.
- That'll be $ 1. 65.</i>

902
00:52:56,387 --> 00:53:00,154
<i>Oh, we're having a special
on kitchen tinware, Mrs. Beck.</i>

903
00:53:00,191 --> 00:53:02,524
<i>No, thank you.
I've got plenty.</i>

904
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,257
<i>Well, I wouldn't
want to sell you anything...</i>

905
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:07,561
<i>you don't really want,
but I think you ought...</i>

906
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:08,798
<i>to take advantage of this sale.</i>

907
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,665
<i>Prices are going up,
sure as shootin'.</i>

908
00:53:14,684 --> 00:53:18,156
<i>Thank you,
Mrs. Folger. Now, Mrs. Beck?</i>

909
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:20,610
<i>Did the yard goods
I ordered come in, Mr. Pringle?</i>

910
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,522
<i>Indeed it did,
and so did the patterns.</i>

911
00:53:22,546 --> 00:53:23,741
<i>Good.</i>

912
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:25,192
<i>Mrs. Folger,
I think you ought to look...</i>

913
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:27,082
<i>at that kitchenware.
Every item's on sale.</i>

914
00:53:27,118 --> 00:53:28,313
<i>Here we are, Mrs. Beck.</i>

915
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:29,843
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

916
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,152
<i>That'll be $ 1.46.</i>

917
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,037
<i>Mrs. Folger, I think you ought
to look at that kitchenware.</i>

918
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:39,087
Mr. Pringle,
are those cabbages fresh?

919
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,741
<i>Came in this morning,
Mrs. Folger.</i>

920
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:42,242
<i>And the
cauliflower, Mr. Pringle...</i>

921
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,064
<i>is that fresh, too?</i>

922
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:45,746
<i>Came in with
the cabbages, Mrs. Folger.</i>

923
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,432
<i>And the yams?</i>

924
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:50,441
<i>Fresh, Mrs. Folger.
Everything's fresh.</i>

925
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:53,034
<i>That's al ways been our policy,
you know.</i>

926
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:04,255
Aah! Aah! Aah! Mr. Pringle!

927
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:06,223
Aah!

928
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:12,287
Aah! Aah!

929
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,625
Oh! Oh!

930
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:37,116
Rascal!

931
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:40,248
Rascal, come back!

932
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:42,089
Mr. Pringle!

933
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:49,764
Catch that thing!

934
00:55:30,415 --> 00:55:33,385
Well, that's not bad
for a hurry-up job, huh?

935
00:55:36,054 --> 00:55:38,785
Tomorrow we'll move in
a few of the comforts of home.

936
00:55:49,874 --> 00:55:53,684
Well, I think we ought to be
moving along to bed, Sterling.

937
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,571
<i>Son?</i>

938
00:56:04,192 --> 00:56:05,717
Yes, sir.

939
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:23,828
He'll be just fine, son.

940
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:25,837
Come along to bed.

941
00:57:13,064 --> 00:57:15,659
- You ready to go, Pa?
- Yep.

942
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:19,836
Aren't you gonna
take him over...

943
00:57:19,861 --> 00:57:22,353
to say good-bye to Cy
and Garth and Donnybrook?

944
00:57:22,378 --> 00:57:24,870
They already left for the race.

945
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:26,722
Oh, that's right, the race.

946
00:57:26,764 --> 00:57:29,131
Say, why don't
we stop by Miller's Grove...

947
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,726
and turn him loose afterward?

948
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:32,293
No, Pa.

949
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:38,339
Son, are you sure
you want to do this?

950
00:57:38,648 --> 00:57:40,879
He's not really full-grown.

951
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,842
There's an awful lot
about taking care of himself...

952
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,106
in the woods
that he doesn't know yet.

953
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:48,239
He'll learn.

954
00:57:52,328 --> 00:57:54,387
Tell you what...

955
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:56,781
since we're going
right by Miller's Grove...

956
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:59,916
why don't we just stop by
for a minute?

957
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:01,016
<i>All right!</i>

958
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:02,650
<i>Step right up, gentlemen!
Who else?</i>

959
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:05,628
Who else has got the courage
to back poor Garth Shadwick...

960
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:08,131
and his one-horse shay
with some hard cash?

961
00:58:08,164 --> 00:58:09,632
Two to one.

962
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,498
How about you, Mr. Pringle?

963
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:14,993
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

964
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:17,132
Whoa, whoa.

965
00:58:17,173 --> 00:58:18,368
What's ailing him?

966
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:20,900
Don't he know he has half
the loose money in town...

967
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:22,435
bet on his nose?

968
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:24,209
It's that darn varmint.

969
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:25,408
Whoa! Whoa!

970
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:31,582
Calm down! Where's Willard
and that boy anyway?

971
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:35,153
All right, gentlemen,
it's time to start the race.

972
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:38,093
<i>Official starting time--2:00.</i>

973
00:58:38,128 --> 00:58:40,495
Last chance to bet.
Any more sucker money?

974
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:42,847
Both of you know the course.

975
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:47,401
You go down to the crossroads,
swing past Miller's farm...

976
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:52,609
turn right, across the creek,
past Otto Wagner's feed pens...

977
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:55,635
and come back down
the county road...

978
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:58,080
across the covered bridge...

979
00:58:58,313 --> 00:59:00,276
and back to the starting line!

980
00:59:00,317 --> 00:59:01,615
OK, let's go.

981
00:59:01,907 --> 00:59:05,281
Steamer, four laps.
Donnybrook, two laps.

982
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:07,120
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

983
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:10,321
Donnybrook, if you ever ran,
you'd better do it today.

984
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,762
Stand back.
Don't want nobody getting hurt.

985
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,517
<i>Ready, gents?</i>

986
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:19,651
Ready...

987
00:59:20,437 --> 00:59:23,202
get set...go!

988
00:59:26,976 --> 00:59:29,605
I said "Go," didn't I? Well, go!

989
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:43,759
Come on, Donnybrook! Go! Go!

990
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:49,394
Donnybrook, go, boy!

991
00:59:56,172 --> 00:59:57,504
Ha ha ha!

992
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:57,922
Easy, boy. Easy.

993
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:00,636
Stop blowing that whistle!

994
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,161
Ha ha ha!

995
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:05,504
Now, easy, boy, easy!

996
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,379
Careful!

997
01:01:16,604 --> 01:01:19,438
Down, Donnybrook!
Down, boy, down!

998
01:01:25,484 --> 01:01:27,578
Any more Donnybrook money
at two to one?

999
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:29,094
Three to one? Five to one?

1000
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,815
The race ain't over yet,
Walt Dabbett!

1001
01:01:30,913 --> 01:01:32,347
Aw, the heck it ain't! Ha ha!

1002
01:01:36,105 --> 01:01:37,573
Hey, look!

1003
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:43,345
Hey, what's going on?

1004
01:01:43,379 --> 01:01:45,610
Never mind what's going on!
Where you been? Come on!

1005
01:01:45,648 --> 01:01:46,946
What are we gonna do?

1006
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:49,885
Try to make a race out of
it, that's what we're gonna do!

1007
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:53,784
<i>Garth! Garth, stop! Stop!</i>

1008
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:56,088
Stop! Garth--

1009
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,269
I'm pulling him
out of the race.

1010
01:01:57,293 --> 01:01:58,727
But, Garth, he showed up!

1011
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:02,324
Oh--Sterling,
bring him here!

1012
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,206
There we go! All right!

1013
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:06,617
Let's go!

1014
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:26,281
- What's going on?
- Looks like you're in trouble.

1015
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:28,791
<i>Yeah.
Donnybrook's on his last lap.</i>

1016
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:51,480
Donnybrook, let's go!

1017
01:02:55,618 --> 01:02:57,450
Come on, Donnybrook,
you can do it!

1018
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:51,508
- Congratulations, Garth!
- Rascal, you did it!

1019
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,032
You're my fuzzy darling!

1020
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:55,409
You can have anything
your darn heart desires!

1021
01:03:55,445 --> 01:03:56,936
Corn till it
comes out your ears!

1022
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,381
Eggs anytime, day or night!

1023
01:03:59,562 --> 01:04:02,122
The lid'll never be
on the marshmallow jar.

1024
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:07,321
And as for municipal code,
section fourteen...

1025
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:18,129
<i>And so Rascal
was the hero of the hour...</i>

1026
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,466
<i>and back in everybody's
good graces.</i>

1027
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:23,029
<i>Everyone's
but Walt Dabbett's maybe.</i>

1028
01:04:23,072 --> 01:04:25,837
<i>That most wonderful summer
of my life...</i>

1029
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,200
<i>was about to come to a close.</i>

1030
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:31,108
<i>And before we knew it,
it was Thanksgiving...</i>

1031
01:04:31,273 --> 01:04:33,866
<i>and time for Theo's homecoming.</i>

1032
01:04:36,694 --> 01:04:39,535
Um, Norman, about Papa...

1033
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:41,620
I want you to be forewarned.

1034
01:04:42,293 --> 01:04:45,463
Honey, don't be nervous.
You've explained all about him.

1035
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:46,990
I couldn't have.

1036
01:04:47,034 --> 01:04:50,300
Nobody can explain my father,
you've got to meet him.

1037
01:04:50,337 --> 01:04:51,703
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

1038
01:04:53,968 --> 01:04:57,837
Thing is,
I--I want you to like him.

1039
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,538
All right, I'll do that.
I'm glad you told me.

1040
01:05:00,581 --> 01:05:03,380
I mean, I want him to like you.

1041
01:05:04,305 --> 01:05:06,546
Ah, now that may be harder.

1042
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,887
Norman, you are hopeless.

1043
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:12,257
Just remember, I warned you.

1044
01:05:12,771 --> 01:05:16,649
OK, I'm warned. Now relax.

1045
01:05:20,234 --> 01:05:23,398
Oh, I've got to drop those
figures off back to my office.

1046
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:25,015
Do you suppose
there's a place in town...

1047
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,405
I could send a telegram?

1048
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:46,849
- Be right back.
- OK.

1049
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,884
<i>Mrs. Satterfield!</i>

1050
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:54,140
<i>Hello.</i>

1051
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:56,597
I'm Theo North.
We talked last spring.

1052
01:05:56,637 --> 01:05:58,299
Oh, to be sure.

1053
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:01,036
You caught me
at a disadvantage.

1054
01:06:01,075 --> 01:06:02,168
How are things going?

1055
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:04,144
I'm been meaning
to write to you...

1056
01:06:04,178 --> 01:06:06,613
but Sterling's
been filling me in, so...

1057
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:08,673
Very satisfactorily,
I would say.

1058
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:10,548
A touch of arthritis.

1059
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:13,577
Oh, well, I meant
with Sterling and Papa.

1060
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:15,214
Seems to be fine.

1061
01:06:15,256 --> 01:06:17,623
Of course, they march
to a different drum...

1062
01:06:17,658 --> 01:06:19,820
as the saying goes.

1063
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,329
Well, I really must be going.
A lot to do today.

1064
01:06:22,363 --> 01:06:23,888
Thanksgiving and all, you know.

1065
01:06:23,931 --> 01:06:26,196
Wait a minute,
we can take you home.

1066
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:28,759
It's only a two-seater, but
I'm sure we can manage somehow.

1067
01:06:28,803 --> 01:06:29,964
Here, let me help.

1068
01:06:30,004 --> 01:06:32,303
I wouldn't want to take you
so far out of your way.

1069
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:35,400
Nonsense--out of our way?

1070
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:37,843
I'm clear over
on the other side of town...

1071
01:06:37,878 --> 01:06:39,369
on Menomene Avenue.

1072
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:43,282
Mrs. Satterfield...

1073
01:06:43,922 --> 01:06:46,255
who is minding the store?

1074
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,665
Store?

1075
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:52,668
Yes. Who's keeping house
for my father and Sterling?

1076
01:06:53,216 --> 01:06:55,453
So far as I know, nobody.

1077
01:06:55,524 --> 01:06:58,537
As I said, they march
to a different drum.

1078
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,707
A tom-tom, if you want
to be honest about it.

1079
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,186
Well, happy Thanksgiving.

1080
01:07:11,345 --> 01:07:13,075
<i>Well, Theo!</i>

1081
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:16,242
Nice to have you home.
Where's your young man?

1082
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,548
Later, Mr. Jenkins.

1083
01:07:19,174 --> 01:07:21,317
Theo!
Theo, where are you going?

1084
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:24,997
Theo!

1085
01:07:25,037 --> 01:07:28,496
Ahh, you must be
Theo's young man.

1086
01:07:28,869 --> 01:07:30,497
Well, I thought I was.

1087
01:07:33,502 --> 01:07:34,800
Holy cow.

1088
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:41,015
Holy cow. She wasn't
supposed to be here until--

1089
01:08:11,098 --> 01:08:13,260
Papa!

1090
01:08:14,061 --> 01:08:15,775
Sterl--

1091
01:08:38,028 --> 01:08:42,350
Oh, hi, Theo. You're early.
You remember Rascal, don't you?

1092
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,633
Bet you're surprised
to see how much he's grown.

1093
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:47,873
Sterling North,
how could you do it?

1094
01:08:47,912 --> 01:08:51,110
Do what?
Oh, you mean my canoe.

1095
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:52,617
Well, it's all finished now...

1096
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:55,106
and me and Pa were going
to haul it out to the garage.

1097
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,735
I'm not talking
about your canoe!

1098
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:03,300
How could you hoodwink me like
this about Mrs. Satterfield?

1099
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:06,056
It wasn't a lie, exactly.

1100
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:08,123
Not a black one anyway.

1101
01:09:08,543 --> 01:09:11,087
Gray. Dark gray, Pa says.

1102
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:12,430
Where is he?

1103
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,632
At the butcher's getting
the turkey for tomorrow.

1104
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:16,402
Oh, Theo, you've got to see it.

1105
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:18,433
Thirty pounds! The biggest
turkey in the whole--

1106
01:09:18,476 --> 01:09:19,687
Sterling, stop trying
to change the subject.

1107
01:09:19,711 --> 01:09:21,577
A fellow
owed Pa some money, see?

1108
01:09:21,613 --> 01:09:23,878
Sterling North, answer me!

1109
01:09:23,932 --> 01:09:25,670
...McQuade.

1110
01:09:27,232 --> 01:09:29,018
It was my fault.

1111
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,734
I should have told you.

1112
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:34,635
We just couldn't do it.

1113
01:09:36,012 --> 01:09:37,604
Why not?

1114
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:42,100
What is so difficult
about hiring a housekeeper?

1115
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:46,424
Sterling, I'm talking to you.

1116
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:49,874
What's so awful
about Mrs. Satterfield?

1117
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:53,292
She's a perfectly nice,
clean, respectable lady.

1118
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:56,504
What is so wrong with
having your meals on time?

1119
01:09:56,548 --> 01:09:58,039
And your socks darned.

1120
01:09:58,082 --> 01:10:00,152
Maybe the furniture
polished once in awhile.

1121
01:10:00,222 --> 01:10:03,920
- Tell me!
- OK. OK, I'll tell you.

1122
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:06,265
Because she wouldn't
be anything like Mom.

1123
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:09,354
Or you, even.
That's what's wrong.

1124
01:10:10,949 --> 01:10:15,934
Well, Sterling, Mama's gone,
and I've got a job.

1125
01:10:16,354 --> 01:10:18,629
OK, so you've got a job.

1126
01:10:19,024 --> 01:10:21,391
It's easy for you
to sit in Chicago...

1127
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,088
and write your letters.

1128
01:10:23,128 --> 01:10:25,359
But what about Pa and me?

1129
01:10:25,758 --> 01:10:28,595
Pa's gone half the time.

1130
01:10:28,633 --> 01:10:32,070
Mrs.--Mrs. Satter--
Mrs. Satterfield--

1131
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,820
Do you know the first thing
that she wanted to do?

1132
01:10:34,924 --> 01:10:37,792
She wanted to kick out
Wowser and Rascal, too.

1133
01:10:37,925 --> 01:10:41,089
That's right.
Just--just--she hates animals.

1134
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,348
She wanted to kick them out
like they were nothing.

1135
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:46,672
Like--
like they didn't even matter.

1136
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:48,344
I see.

1137
01:10:49,049 --> 01:10:51,322
Soon as she came in here,
she was walking in...

1138
01:10:51,356 --> 01:10:53,552
putting her finger
all over mother's furniture...

1139
01:10:53,592 --> 01:10:56,892
saying, "Kick 'em out.
Animals aren't people."

1140
01:10:56,928 --> 01:10:58,089
Well, maybe they're not...

1141
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:01,156
but they're not just animals
to me, Theo.

1142
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,895
They're--they're--

1143
01:11:02,934 --> 01:11:04,459
Yeah.

1144
01:11:04,503 --> 01:11:07,735
I'm not gonna let anyone
kick them out.

1145
01:11:07,906 --> 01:11:09,704
Not anyone.

1146
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:12,993
Hey, Sterling...

1147
01:11:13,928 --> 01:11:15,658
I'm sorry.

1148
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:19,448
Gotta finish cleaning up.

1149
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:21,146
Wait a minute.

1150
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:30,520
Theo?

1151
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:39,539
<i>♪ Over the river
and through the wood ♪</i>

1152
01:11:39,572 --> 01:11:40,972
Theo?

1153
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:47,839
Hello, Papa.

1154
01:11:48,289 --> 01:11:50,986
Look, I know
just what you're going to say.

1155
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:52,631
<i>Mea culpa.</i>

1156
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:55,280
That's Latin for
"I know the house is a mess...

1157
01:11:55,321 --> 01:11:57,032
"daughter, but you got here
three hours early."

1158
01:11:57,056 --> 01:11:58,251
Papa--

1159
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:00,202
I know. Just give Sterling
and me some working room...

1160
01:12:00,226 --> 01:12:01,870
and we'll have
the whole thing shipshape...

1161
01:12:01,894 --> 01:12:03,138
before you can say
Jack Robinson.

1162
01:12:03,162 --> 01:12:05,791
- What do you think of that?
- Just fine.

1163
01:12:05,832 --> 01:12:07,266
I pulled off a real transaction.

1164
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,777
You know, there's a fella
down in Illinois--

1165
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:11,202
Named McQuade. He owes you
real estate commission.

1166
01:12:11,237 --> 01:12:12,637
Gave you
the pick of the flock...

1167
01:12:12,672 --> 01:12:14,249
and that just happens
to be the biggest turkey...

1168
01:12:14,273 --> 01:12:16,469
in the state of Illinois.
Right?

1169
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:18,501
I forgot I told you that.

1170
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:20,240
So where's your young fella?

1171
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:22,510
Down at the telegraph office.

1172
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:27,111
Why don't you be a love,
go down and pick him up...

1173
01:12:27,153 --> 01:12:28,951
take him out to Koshkonong...

1174
01:12:28,988 --> 01:12:31,514
and watch the ice boats
or something?

1175
01:12:31,557 --> 01:12:35,187
Ice boats? The water won't
freeze over for a month.

1176
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:38,115
Fine.
Take him out there and wait.

1177
01:12:42,635 --> 01:12:44,729
Now, what was that?

1178
01:12:44,771 --> 01:12:46,364
Nothing.

1179
01:12:46,406 --> 01:12:48,637
Why don't you just
come right out and say it?

1180
01:12:48,674 --> 01:12:50,540
Do your heart good.

1181
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:53,842
I have said it all, Papa.
I'm out of words.

1182
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,577
Just go down and fetch Norman,
tell him I'm sorry...

1183
01:12:56,616 --> 01:12:58,778
and that I wasn't
thinking too clearly.

1184
01:12:58,818 --> 01:13:00,582
Look, don't you think
you're making...

1185
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,317
an awful lot out of nothing?

1186
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:05,348
Nothing?!

1187
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:07,087
We're just living the way
we want to live.

1188
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:08,617
Is that so bad?

1189
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:12,192
Papa, you've always lived
the way you wanted to live.

1190
01:13:12,765 --> 01:13:14,529
Well, what's wrong with that?

1191
01:13:14,567 --> 01:13:16,627
What is wrong with it, Papa...

1192
01:13:16,669 --> 01:13:19,605
is that somebody else
has to pay the price.

1193
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,435
Now, see here, young lady.

1194
01:13:24,477 --> 01:13:26,571
You just hold on.

1195
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:30,112
What is most particularly wrong
at this moment, Willard North...

1196
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:34,182
is that I've just made up
my mind I can't marry Norman.

1197
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,046
Theo!

1198
01:13:36,088 --> 01:13:37,556
Because I haven't the heart...

1199
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:40,082
to let Sterling
grow up in a vacuum...

1200
01:13:40,126 --> 01:13:42,994
while you're off
chasing rainbows.

1201
01:13:43,029 --> 01:13:45,055
Because you are
too eternally selfish...

1202
01:13:45,097 --> 01:13:47,657
to act like an adult
responsible human being...

1203
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,169
and give that boy
the father he deserves.

1204
01:13:50,203 --> 01:13:51,637
Now, you just wait a minute--

1205
01:13:51,671 --> 01:13:53,401
Papa, I won't wait!

1206
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:55,567
This has got
to get said for once.

1207
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:59,511
Look, Papa,
for every fun-loving...

1208
01:13:59,545 --> 01:14:02,105
happy-go-lucky free spirit...

1209
01:14:02,148 --> 01:14:05,016
for every charming,
rollicking pixie...

1210
01:14:05,051 --> 01:14:07,077
somebody has got
to pay the price.

1211
01:14:09,288 --> 01:14:12,156
Somebody is seeing
that the bills are paid...

1212
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:14,558
and the checkbook balances...

1213
01:14:14,594 --> 01:14:17,291
and the kids are dressed
and homework's done...

1214
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:20,221
and that there's soup
on the back of the stove.

1215
01:14:20,551 --> 01:14:24,613
<i>Somebody, Papa,
has got to do the worrying.</i>

1216
01:14:25,073 --> 01:14:27,173
And it's a father's job mostly.

1217
01:14:27,206 --> 01:14:30,233
And if a father
wants to chase dreams--

1218
01:14:30,276 --> 01:14:32,302
Theo, there's no point
in going into all that.

1219
01:14:32,345 --> 01:14:33,836
Papa, I'm afraid there is.

1220
01:14:34,055 --> 01:14:36,870
Because I'm going
to have to do your job.

1221
01:14:37,283 --> 01:14:40,412
Because I know
what'll happen to Sterling.

1222
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:42,820
What is happening
to him right now.

1223
01:14:42,855 --> 01:14:45,154
I can feel
the loneliness in him.

1224
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:48,170
Why, he never said a word.

1225
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:51,095
No, Papa, he wouldn't.

1226
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,894
He's too proud to tell you...

1227
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:56,314
that he needs
something in his life...

1228
01:14:56,339 --> 01:14:59,741
besides a yellow dog
and a pet raccoon.

1229
01:15:02,393 --> 01:15:06,023
Papa...face up to it.

1230
01:15:06,929 --> 01:15:09,906
Be honest with yourself.

1231
01:15:10,649 --> 01:15:13,612
Don't go running off
to Wentworth Woods...

1232
01:15:14,038 --> 01:15:16,011
or out to Minnesota.

1233
01:15:16,556 --> 01:15:19,185
Don't go chasing after
the biggest turkey...

1234
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:21,558
in the state of Illinois.

1235
01:15:21,968 --> 01:15:27,134
Just stop and ask yourself if
you're being fair to that boy.

1236
01:16:13,553 --> 01:16:14,714
Theo?

1237
01:16:15,775 --> 01:16:16,664
Oh.

1238
01:16:16,756 --> 01:16:18,208
Well, Norman.

1239
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:20,454
I saw the lights.

1240
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:21,984
Thought it might have been Theo.

1241
01:16:22,028 --> 01:16:23,963
You couldn't sleep either, huh?

1242
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:26,831
Well, join the club.
Cup of coffee?

1243
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:28,470
Thank you.

1244
01:16:35,151 --> 01:16:37,780
Mr. North, could you tell me
what's going on?

1245
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:40,933
I mean, first Theo drops me off
in the middle of town...

1246
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:44,122
and now she's hardly
even speaking to me.

1247
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,802
Am I engaged or aren't I?
And if so, why?

1248
01:16:49,389 --> 01:16:52,086
Norman, sit down.

1249
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:59,936
Norman, the longer I live,
the more I'm convinced...

1250
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,452
no, the less I'm convinced...

1251
01:17:03,569 --> 01:17:07,690
that I know the answer
to anything.

1252
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:06,772
<i>Norman! Norman!
Papa! Sterling!</i>

1253
01:18:06,966 --> 01:18:09,367
- Theo!
- Norman, oh!

1254
01:18:09,402 --> 01:18:10,563
Honey, what's wrong?

1255
01:18:12,472 --> 01:18:14,031
That is what's wrong!

1256
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:16,167
I reached out in my sleep,
and it--

1257
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:18,235
What happened?
Where's Rascal?

1258
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,609
- Downstairs.
- Rascal!

1259
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:24,113
What's going on?

1260
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:25,914
Rascal's trying
to get out again.

1261
01:18:27,653 --> 01:18:30,851
Rascal! Now, how many times
do I have to tell you--

1262
01:18:35,646 --> 01:18:37,143
He bit me.

1263
01:18:39,332 --> 01:18:41,096
I'll get the iodine.

1264
01:18:46,403 --> 01:18:49,497
<i>Sterling,
don't get too fond of him.</i>

1265
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:52,002
<i>He won't al ways be young.</i>

1266
01:18:52,044 --> 01:18:53,876
<i>There'll come a day
when old Mother Nature...</i>

1267
01:18:53,913 --> 01:18:57,261
<i>will reach across your shoulder
and tap his ear...</i>

1268
01:18:57,783 --> 01:19:00,719
<i>and he'll tell you
that it's time to go.</i>

1269
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:17,080
Come here, son.

1270
01:19:21,849 --> 01:19:23,977
Take care of these bites.

1271
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:30,406
He didn't mean it, Pa.
He just wants to ramble.

1272
01:19:32,585 --> 01:19:33,951
Hurt?

1273
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,955
It just stings a little.

1274
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:37,388
Hmm.

1275
01:19:41,013 --> 01:19:42,514
Pa?

1276
01:19:42,886 --> 01:19:45,009
Hmm?

1277
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:48,496
I'm gonna have to let him go.

1278
01:19:54,307 --> 01:19:56,742
Well, that's the way it is,
Sterling.

1279
01:19:57,221 --> 01:19:58,901
Things change.

1280
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:03,716
We can't always keep them
the way we'd like them to be.

1281
01:20:04,704 --> 01:20:07,037
We all have to grow up sometime.

1282
01:20:08,485 --> 01:20:10,716
Raccoons and boys, too.

1283
01:20:14,294 --> 01:20:16,320
Even fathers, I guess.

1284
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,427
He'll ramble for a while.

1285
01:20:22,738 --> 01:20:25,190
That's just
some people's nature.

1286
01:20:25,943 --> 01:20:29,262
But he'll get over it.
He'll get over it.

1287
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:35,112
He'll get smart, settle down.

1288
01:20:36,971 --> 01:20:40,567
Might even rent that little
office over Pringle's store.

1289
01:20:55,532 --> 01:20:57,728
<i>Just as Miss Whalen
had said it would...</i>

1290
01:20:57,763 --> 01:20:59,391
<i>the time had come.</i>

1291
01:20:59,456 --> 01:21:02,953
<i>Old Mother Nature had whispered
her mysterious message.</i>

1292
01:21:03,231 --> 01:21:05,632
<i>Rascal had heard and heeded...</i>

1293
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:08,193
<i>and now I knew
I had to take him back...</i>

1294
01:21:08,236 --> 01:21:10,501
<i>to the world
where he really belonged.</i>

1295
01:21:18,447 --> 01:21:20,075
<i>As we came near the shore...</i>

1296
01:21:20,115 --> 01:21:21,549
<i>I heard a little call...</i>

1297
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:24,712
<i>a trilling sound,
almost bird-like.</i>

1298
01:21:26,254 --> 01:21:28,723
<i>It was another raccoon,
a little female...</i>

1299
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:29,918
<i>chittering at us.</i>

1300
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,803
<i>Not so much at me as at Rascal.</i>

1301
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:38,393
<i>I wondered if he'd heard her,
half hoping he hadn't.</i>

1302
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:40,559
<i>But it was soon clear
that he had.</i>

1303
01:21:40,602 --> 01:21:43,697
<i>He could hardly wait to land.</i>

1304
01:21:56,585 --> 01:21:59,145
<i>Though I was sorry
to see him go...</i>

1305
01:21:59,273 --> 01:22:03,734
<i>it helped to know he wouldn't
be alone in the world.</i>

1306
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:09,597
<i>Just once he looked back
to see if I was still there...</i>

1307
01:22:11,178 --> 01:22:15,582
<i>I think he was sort of
saying good-bye.</i>

1308
01:23:26,152 --> 01:23:28,212
<i>Well, now I knew
my little raccoon...</i>

1309
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:32,299
<i>could take care of himself,
no doubt about that.</i>

1310
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:37,945
<i>And so I left him.</i>

1311
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,667
<i>Our wonderful summer was over.</i>

1312
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:49,576
<i>In his way,
he seemed to know it, too...</i>

1313
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:52,969
<i>for he came back to give me
one final farewell.</i>

1314
01:24:12,045 --> 01:24:14,488
<i>A character, a personality...</i>

1315
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:17,608
<i>and a ring-tailed wonder.</i>

1316
01:24:20,286 --> 01:24:23,011
<i>It was all
a long, long time ago...</i>

1317
01:24:23,152 --> 01:24:25,451
<i>a different time,
a mellow time...</i>

1318
01:24:25,748 --> 01:24:28,948
<i>and as I think of it now,
the happiest of times.</i>
