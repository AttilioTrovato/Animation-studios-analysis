1
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,488
- Want gas, Mister?
- Yeah, fill it up.

2
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,442
Help yourself, will you please?
I've gotta close up.

3
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,655
Do you know how to get to
Blackbeard's Inn at Godolphin?

4
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,449
I'm going there myself.
I'll show you the way if you give me a lift.

5
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,951
- You're on.
- Thanks.

6
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,245
- Staying at the inn?
- Yep.

7
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,038
Mostly, old ladies live there.

8
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,047
Salesmen going through like to stay at
Ye Jolly Roger down in town.

9
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,803
Got more of a chance
to kick up their heels.

10
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,307
Oh, I'm not a salesman. I'm the new
track coach at Godolphin College.

11
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,472
Coach! I'm glad to know you.

12
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,474
My name's Gudger Larkin.
I'm on your track squad.

13
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,683
I'm captain.

14
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,056
Well, well.

15
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,148
Small world, isn't it?

16
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,152
Let's see now, Captain.
I'd guess you were a sprinter, huh?

17
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,359
Golly, no, sir.
I'm as slow as molasses in January.

18
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,660
Can you give me a hand, coach?

19
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,037
Yeah.

20
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,960
What is your event, Larkin?

21
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,622
- Oh, I'm the shot putter, sir.
- Shot putter?

22
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,088
The weight man is usually
the strongest man on the team.

23
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,510
Yes, sir.

24
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,350
That's the inn, coach.
That's Blackbeard's Inn.

25
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,806
Did the old pirate really build it?

26
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,191
Sure, he got killed in a battle
right out there in the bay.

27
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,151
I'll have to brush up on local history.

28
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,153
Wait till you meet the little old ladies
who run the inn.

29
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,064
They're all descendants of
Blackbeard's bloody crew,

30
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,945
and they're proud of it.

31
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,710
"Buccaneer bazaar tonight.
Help save Blackbeard's Inn."

32
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,129
What does that mean?

33
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,919
Some guy is trying to have
the inn torn down,

34
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,342
but the old ladies are putting up
a pretty good fight.

35
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,050
Are you sure they haven't
started to tear it down already?

36
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,511
It's built mostly of odds and ends,

37
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,930
timbers of ships that got
wrecked in the bay.

38
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,357
- You can park over there.
- All right.

39
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,655
What's that all about?

40
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,455
Hey, buddy...

41
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,753
That's Silky Seymour.
He runs the gambling around here.

42
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,255
I wouldn't fool with him.

43
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,291
What's he doing
at the old ladies' bazaar?

44
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,459
He bought up their mortgage
from the bank.

45
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,093
If the old ladies don't come
up with the loot, out they go.

46
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,720
This fella Seymour gets everything
he wants around here, huh?

47
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,013
Just about.

48
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,919
Ms. Jeffrey, have you seen
Ms. Stowecroft?

49
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,458
This gentleman has a room reservation.

50
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,920
She's outside in a tent, telling fortunes.

51
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,472
- Dean Wheaton.
- What is it?

52
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,845
Sir, I'd like you to meet
our new track coach.

53
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,015
Steve Walker, sir. Just arrived. I believe
I'm to report to you in the morning.

54
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,139
- Oh, welcome to Godolphin, Mr. Walker.
- Thank you very much, sir.

55
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,224
I don't want to seem negative,
but I want to be frank.

56
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,027
I was not in favor
of replacing our former track coach

57
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,025
- when he left so informally.
- Oh.

58
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,275
For some years now, the track team has
done little to add precious luster

59
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,909
to the name of Godolphin College,

60
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,078
so there didn't seem any point
in going on, you see.

61
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,321
Well, I'm sorry to hear that...

62
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,833
Howsoever, we have competed in the
Broxton Relays for 63 years,

63
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,041
so the alumni insisted on one more try.

64
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,999
Of course, there's not
much time before the relay,

65
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,010
but I hope I can restore
your confidence in the boys.

66
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,671
Mr. Walker, I never had any.

67
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,474
Well, hmm...

68
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,889
Before the warmth of the dean's
reception goes to my head,

69
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,187
I think I'll find Ms. Stowecroft
and get a room.

70
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,973
I've been on the road since 5:00
this morning.

71
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,770
Okay, coach. I'll see you tomorrow.

72
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,396
Gudger...

73
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,989
What did happen
to the other track coach?

74
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,827
I don't know. He got to acting real weird.

75
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,455
Talking to himself,
real down in the chops.

76
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,157
One day, he just disappeared.

77
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,622
Just... And he was gone.

78
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,874
Good night, Gudger.

79
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,216
Good night, Coach.

80
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,893
Mr. Walker.

81
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,097
This is Mr. Purvis, our football coach,

82
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,806
whom you undoubtedly
know by reputation.

83
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,857
Well, I certainly do. Who doesn't?

84
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,979
We're fortunate in having
the services of Mr. Purvis.

85
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,822
He produces winning football teams,

86
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:05,744
which in turn produce large grants
and endowments from proud alumni.

87
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,082
Mr. Walker is the new coach
of what we refer to as the track team.

88
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,915
"The track team."

89
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,625
Walker, you won't last three weeks.
Take my word for it.

90
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,878
If you don't mind, Mr. Purvis,
I'd like to find out for myself.

91
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,637
A word of advice, friend.

92
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,842
At Godolphin, the name
of the game is football.

93
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,263
That's what makes the mare
go round, so...

94
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,426
Football.

95
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,935
Don't get any big ideas.

96
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,437
Wouldn't dream of it.

97
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,524
Come along, Mr. Purvis. I'm sure
Mr. Walker will acclimatize very quickly.

98
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,990
Track team!

99
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,958
Ms. Stowecroft?

100
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,453
Sit down, Ishmael.

101
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,459
No, my name's Steve Walker,
Ms. Stowecroft.

102
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,124
I believe a room was arranged for me
here through the college.

103
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,343
You know, living accommodations?

104
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,387
We accommodate the living,

105
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,720
but who shall accommodate the dead?

106
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,262
Give me your hand, Ishmael.

107
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,315
Oh, no, no. I don't want my fortune told.

108
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,771
Just a room, Ms. Stowecroft.

109
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,941
There's a revelation here.
Dark deeds and violence.

110
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,076
Things roused up that were
better left to rot.

111
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,828
If you'll tell me where the keys are,
Ms. Stowecroft, I'd be happy to...

112
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,659
Oh, there's more to the revelation.

113
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,746
We see good here, too.

114
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,000
That's good.

115
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,755
Happiness and content for the people
of Godolphin,

116
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,052
delivered from an ancient evil

117
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,013
and gratitude to you, Ishmael,

118
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,518
who have sacrificed your
own life in their delivery.

119
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,940
Now the light fades.

120
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,352
That is all.

121
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,196
About the room, Ms. Stowe...

122
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,823
- That's all.
- Yes, but I...

123
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,486
You may leave an honorarium
for the care and welfare of the spirits

124
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,121
in the bowl on your way out.

125
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,585
Thank you. Come again.

126
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,050
Hi.

127
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,520
Hey! What's the big idea?

128
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,188
Kisses $1, right?

129
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,558
I don't work here.

130
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,019
Can't you read?
I'm executive committee.

131
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,233
I work here.

132
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,157
Well now, so you do.

133
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,997
That is what I call a real good dollar kiss!
Plenty of value for the money.

134
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,252
Would you hold this a minute, please?

135
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,002
How would you like to try the $5 special?

136
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,926
Five-dollar special.

137
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,150
May I have my badge? Thank you.

138
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,606
Oh, no, no. I'm terribly sorry.
Only one to a customer.

139
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,316
Excuse me.

140
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,873
Ms. Stowecroft.
If I could get that room, please?

141
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,669
Oh, Ishmael, come along, please.
The auction is about to begin.

142
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,419
Ladies and gentlemen
of Godolphin

143
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,588
and neighboring communities,

144
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,132
you all know the purpose of this bazaar.

145
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,723
Our good friends,
the Daughters of the Buccaneers,

146
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,394
took over this old ruin many years ago
and turned it into a cultural landmark.

147
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,353
They served tea,
cooked chicken dinners,

148
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,529
even turned part of it
into a boarding house.

149
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,654
Anything to keep it going,
but that's not enough.

150
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,657
Unless enough money is raised tonight,

151
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,365
this place, that has been
their home for so many years,

152
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,743
will pass into the hands of strangers.

153
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,543
When Ms. Stowecroft begins
to auction off

154
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:31,092
the treasured mementoes,
the fine antiques,

155
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,169
and the family heirlooms
that these good ladies

156
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,010
have so generously donated
to the cause,

157
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:41,470
I beg you to search your
hearts and to bid cheerfully,

158
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,766
boldly, and very, very generously.
Thank you.

159
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,150
Ms. Stowecroft.

160
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,028
Thank you, Professor Baker.

161
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,612
Lot number one.

162
00:12:55,692 --> 00:13:00,368
A fine antique pistol,
which has been in the immediate family

163
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,540
of Ms. Emily Jeffrey,

164
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,163
past president of the
Daughters of the Buccaneers,

165
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,670
for many, many years.

166
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,456
- Now...
- One dollar.

167
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,921
Oh, can't we do better than that?

168
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,220
Who'll give me $20?

169
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,429
Do I hear $20?

170
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,970
Oh, the gentleman
in the back just waved.

171
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,145
The gentleman in the back says, "$20."

172
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,938
Who'll give me $30?

173
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,269
Thirty dollars.

174
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,274
- Thirty-five dollars.
- Forty.

175
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,646
Fifty dollars.

176
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,403
- Sixty dollars.
- Seventy.

177
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,576
Do I hear $80?

178
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,654
- Eighty dollars!
- One hundred dollars!

179
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:47,544
One hundred dollars bid.
Do I hear $110?

180
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:52,416
Professor Baker, how about your
nice young man in the back?

181
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,254
I don't think so.
He just backed into his shell.

182
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,181
Very well. One hundred dollars, once.

183
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,431
One hundred dollars, twice.

184
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,558
Sold!

185
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,352
All right, move in.

186
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,234
One hundred dollars.

187
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,361
- Thank you.
- Lot number two.

188
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,985
You got taken, buddy. This is a fake.

189
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,530
Take my advice,
don't bid on anything else.

190
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,948
You mean the warming pan is fake, too?

191
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,787
That's tourist junk.

192
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,712
And Mr. Seymour don't like to
see you throw your money away.

193
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,468
This bed warmer is believed to have
been the property of Aldetha Teach,

194
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:42,471
tenth wife of our dear
Captain Blackbeard.

195
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,596
If you want to bid, go ahead, but
I don't think Mr. Seymour would like it.

196
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:51,437
Mrs. Starkey,
how about starting the bidding for us?

197
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,861
No, thanks. I... I don't think so.

198
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,364
How about you, Mr. Finch?

199
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,492
Oh... No, no, thank you.

200
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:06,368
Mr. Harrison,
you'll open the bidding for us, I know.

201
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,621
This pistol is enough for me.

202
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:16,167
Will no one open the bidding
on this magnificent item?

203
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,762
- Five dollars!
- Well, thank you.

204
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,552
Ten dollars.

205
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:29,934
Mr. Virgil Purvis,
our football coach, bids $10.

206
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,186
Fifteen!

207
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,142
- Twenty dollars.
- Twenty-five.

208
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,398
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty-five.

209
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,981
Fifty dollars.

210
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,694
- Fifty-five.
- Sixty.

211
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,778
- Sixty-five.
- Seventy.

212
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,859
Five.

213
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,366
One hundred dollars!

214
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,869
As we all know, Mr. Virgil Purvis,
our football coach, doesn't like to lose.

215
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,547
He very generously bid $100.

216
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,423
Just an opinion,
but I wouldn't bid anymore if I were you.

217
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,051
Now, why is that?

218
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,267
No reason.
I just don't want you to, that's all.

219
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,347
Oh.

220
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,895
One hundred
dollars twice.

221
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,975
Two hundred dollars!

222
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,439
Two hundred dollars, once!
Two hundred dollars, twice!

223
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,318
Sold! To the nice
young gentleman in back.

224
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,941
Now we're really rolling!

225
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,027
- Excuse me.
- Lot number 3.

226
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,455
Here, we have a fascinating piece
from colonial times.

227
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,661
The clock in the gentleman's stomach
keeps perfect time.

228
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,837
New here, aren't you?

229
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,957
Yeah.

230
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,924
Just passing through?

231
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,376
Nope.

232
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,337
Might stick around a while, huh?

233
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,796
Might.

234
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,427
Thank you.

235
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,555
We'll see each other again.

236
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,761
Good night.

237
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,524
- Hi.
- Hi.

238
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,864
How'd you make out?

239
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,195
Fine. Much better than we'd expected.
Thank you.

240
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,776
Good. No problem, then?

241
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,327
I wish that were true.

242
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,951
We still have another $38,000
to give Mr. Seymour

243
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,410
before the first of the month.

244
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,957
Why is Seymour so anxious
to get this property, anyway?

245
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,297
I'll show you on the map.

246
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,795
This is the island we're on.

247
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,380
In Blackbeard's time,
the river flowed this way.

248
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,965
The inn was part of the mainland.

249
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,303
Then, about 80 years ago,
we had this terrible flood and storm

250
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:38,563
and the river changed its course,
isolating the inn from the mainland.

251
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:43,488
As a result, nobody's ever
been able to clarify legal jurisdiction.

252
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,614
That's where Mr. Seymour comes in?

253
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,361
Sure. He can tear down the inn,
put up a casino,

254
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,491
and the law can't bother him.

255
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,286
Oh, uh...

256
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,294
Well, I'd like to thank you
for what you did tonight.

257
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,955
Without you we wouldn't
have had much of an auction.

258
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,751
I just kept bidding
because it made you smile.

259
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,253
I like that smile.

260
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,256
Jo Anne, aren't you...

261
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,261
I've been waiting to drive you home.

262
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,719
Excuse me. Good night.

263
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,929
Good night.

264
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,072
I'm going to put you in his room.
I'm sure he won't mind.

265
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,067
- He?
- Captain Blackbeard.

266
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,242
Oh.

267
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:35,449
This looks out to the river
and the upper bay.

268
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,418
The captain used to stand here
for hours with his spyglass,

269
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,501
studying the ships moving in and out.

270
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,170
He'd pick out the one he liked,

271
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,376
then he'd come here,

272
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,509
to this very table,

273
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,675
and with his men,
he'd plan how to seize it.

274
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,935
Thank you, Ms. Stowecroft.

275
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,308
I know how anxious you
must be to get to bed, so...

276
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,057
Sometimes, when he's in a bad mood,

277
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,226
or feeling lonely,

278
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,482
we hear him thumping around,

279
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,280
breaking glasses and bottles,

280
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,576
trying so hard to communicate with us.

281
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:18,124
I suppose we should be
very angry with him for all that noise,

282
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,119
but it isn't his fault, poor man.

283
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,873
Whose fault is it?

284
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,958
Aldetha's, of course.

285
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,084
Who?

286
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,961
Number 10.

287
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,172
The captain's last wife, but one.

288
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,009
Oh, the one your warming pan
belonged to.

289
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,227
Well, good...

290
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,723
Aldetha was a witch, you know.

291
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,561
She never forgave the captain
for denouncing her to the authorities.

292
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,945
When they were burning Aldetha
at the stake,

293
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,906
she put a terrible curse on him.

294
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,994
As the flames crept higher and higher...

295
00:19:55,486 --> 00:20:00,117
She screeched her dying words,
"Edward Teach,

296
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,326
"sometimes known as
Captain Blackbeard,

297
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,210
"when you come to die,
may your body and soul

298
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,461
"be racked between this world
and the next,

299
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,801
"always to be alone.

300
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,339
"May this curse hold fast and true.

301
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,642
"May you dwell forevermore in limbo

302
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,939
"or until such time as there be
found in you,

303
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,600
"most wicked of all villains..."

304
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,940
"Some spark of human goodness."

305
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,783
Well, good night, Mr. Walker.
Sleep well.

306
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,117
The dining room will be open
for breakfast at 7:30 a.m.

307
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,003
Please be prompt.

308
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,511
Oh, no.

309
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,730
Two hundred bucks.

310
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,367
"Aldetha Teach."

311
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,500
So the thing did belong to her.

312
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,967
"Her book of spells and conjurations."

313
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,711
Well, now...

314
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,933
"A spell to turn your enemy
into a spotted toad.

315
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,932
"A spell to turn mercury into gold."

316
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,642
I wonder if there's a spell to
make a track team out of a pig's ear?

317
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,362
"A spell to bring to your eyes and ears

318
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,948
"one who is bound in limbo."

319
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,651
How about that? Limbo.

320
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:05,621
"Kree kruh vergo gebba kalto kree!"

321
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,436
Curses. Pirates. Malarky.

322
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,397
Blackbeard, himself, was a phony.

323
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:36,109
He was probably some
chicken-livered little pipsqueak

324
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,776
that built up a reputation scaring
old women and children.

325
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,615
Chicken-livered pipsqueak, is it?

326
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,206
A remark spoke slighting like that

327
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,123
could raise a man's blood, now.
Could it not?

328
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,300
I've been on the road since 5:00
this morning. I'm just tired.

329
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,548
Nothing to eat.

330
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,472
Ms. Stowecroft gassed me up
with pirate stories.

331
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,257
I'm all right, I'm just tired.

332
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,135
Boy, am I tired!

333
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,478
I don't think you're real.
I don't think that sword is real.

334
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,313
I'm going to walk right through it
and go to bed!

335
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,362
Try it, mate.

336
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,113
Ow.

337
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,991
It's real.

338
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,827
Who called me out?

339
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,991
- What?
- Who invoked me?

340
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,336
Aldetha's writing.

341
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,676
No! Aldetha...

342
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,761
Aldetha done it.
"Beware," cried me shipmates.

343
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,844
"Sheer off.

344
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,355
"That girl, she be a true witch."

345
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,267
And I paid no heed. Oh, Aldetha.

346
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,486
To do that to your legal spoke husband.

347
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,862
Oh!

348
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,238
The story is Blackbeard had her burned.

349
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,743
Burned? I never put a taper to her.
Never!

350
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,869
Down in the horse latitudes,
on a dull day,

351
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,293
I might have keel-hauled a wife or two,

352
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,541
or else walked one off
the end of a plank, yes.

353
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,544
But I never did it for spite.

354
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,751
Funny thing about me,
never did it for spite.

355
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:24,179
I might have done it out of jest
to keep the spirits of me shipmates up.

356
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,883
Now, to real business.

357
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,934
- Where'd you stow it?
- What?

358
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,978
Your rum.

359
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,394
I don't drink.

360
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,684
Don't drink?

361
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,407
Ship's stores.
Have to seek succor there. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

362
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,254
Mistress Stowecroft,
your humble servant.

363
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,264
Servant...

364
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,686
<i>A bottle of rum, no glasses are left</i>

365
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,268
<i>To drink from the bottle with you, sir</i>

366
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,948
<i>Me dee, fiddle de dee</i>

367
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,785
You don't know what
you're missing, son.

368
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,736
She didn't see you.

369
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,327
- Eh?
- She didn't even hear you.

370
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,621
Oh, why should she?

371
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,623
I'm a kind of a ghost, you know.

372
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,255
In limbo, caught twixt this world
and the next,

373
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,669
beholden to that spell which
brings me to your eyes only.

374
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,553
You mean...

375
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,302
No one can see you except me?

376
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,850
That's about the shape of it, son.

377
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,809
That's why I'll be sailing
alongside of you. See?

378
00:25:55,846 --> 00:26:00,147
Wheresoever thou goest,
there also will I go.

379
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,653
So, let's drink to that.

380
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,405
Are you sure you don't want
to freshen your spleen?

381
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,487
Let's get one thing straight!

382
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,618
I want nothing to do with you!

383
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,903
I'm...

384
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,454
I'm going to bed.

385
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:16,038
You can go back into the woodwork,
or wherever it is you came from.

386
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,413
Belay that tongue!

387
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:21,373
One thing old Blackbeard don't take
kindly to, it's them sort of insenuendos.

388
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,833
Come to think of it, I don't care for
the cut of your jib, neither.

389
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,128
If I were to lay this course,
I'd choose a companion,

390
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,298
a hearty companion,
with a little blood on his sleeve.

391
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:37,060
And a predilection for rum, song,
and for the occasional wench.

392
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,399
But what have I got? Hmm?

393
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,772
I've got a shindly little beanrake...

394
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,151
- Now, wait!
- With the shakes and the whimpers!

395
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,314
What do you mean?

396
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,859
Doesn't even want to join me in a drink!

397
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,824
We're stuck with one another, you and I.

398
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,948
The cruise may well be a long one.

399
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,701
You'd better make the best of it.

400
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:04,465
And I take this opportunity of
bidding you a very good night.

401
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,380
Hey!

402
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,091
Hey, wait a minute! Get off of my bed!

403
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,053
- Your bed?
- My bed!

404
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,217
My bed?

405
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:19,434
I captured it from a Portugee
trader at the sack of Cartagena!

406
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,390
I spitted him, clean and sweet,

407
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,274
against the headboard!

408
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,186
Don't rush me.

409
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,520
There it is.

410
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,532
There's your Portugee,
what's left of him.

411
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,239
If you think I'm going to
sleep on the floor...

412
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,199
You've got another thing coming!

413
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,659
Oh, well then, welcome aboard,

414
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,657
and drop your hook.

415
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,120
Devil is the man whoever said that
old Teach was inhospitable.

416
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,457
All I ask is to be able to get to sleep,

417
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,463
because I know...

418
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,467
Because I know when I wake up
tomorrow morning,

419
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,140
none of this will have ever happened.

420
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,339
Up! The Jolly Roger!

421
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,292
Wind freshening, aye, Mr. Bellamy.

422
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,961
- Oh!
- Hoist it again!

423
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,801
El Portugee, it's your daughter I'm after,

424
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,133
<i>senhor,</i> not your bed.

425
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,471
Oh!

426
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,355
Don Mendoza, we meet again.

427
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,357
Pick up your weapon, sir.

428
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,825
Ahhh!

429
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,488
Take my regards to the King of Spain!

430
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,496
Ahhh!

431
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,326
Ha, ha, ha.

432
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,750
Bellamy, oh!

433
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,668
That's it!

434
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,880
That is absolutely it!

435
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,387
Figment of my imagination
or not, he can have his room,

436
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,686
he can have his bed! I don't need it!

437
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,517
I'm going to "Ye Jolly Roger Motel"

438
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,477
where the salesmen go!

439
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,739
Well...

440
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:46,418
Nothing like a little
fresh air to straighten you out.

441
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:50,373
For a while there, I almost
believed there was a pirate.

442
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,883
Oh, no. You're back!

443
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,219
Right?

444
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,393
That be about the measure of it, lad.

445
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:07,223
I fear there's no way of being
rid of dear old Blackbeard.

446
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,315
Well, that's great.

447
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,519
That is just great!

448
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,564
I couldn't have an ordinary ghost
on my hands, I got a rummy!

449
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,694
A big, ugly, booze-soaked rummy!

450
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,234
Hold on there!

451
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,536
There be no call to put
the fuddler's name

452
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,413
on your new-found shipmate.

453
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,203
Look, lad...

454
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,874
I've been very lonely, see?

455
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:35,089
I'm just an old hulk
wrecked on a lee shore.

456
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,502
All my shipmates gone.

457
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,590
No one to listen to me no more.

458
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,643
You don't care for me,
that's plain as print.

459
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,345
Shut up, will ya? Shut up.

460
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,396
Aye, aye, sir.

461
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,065
You wouldn't have such a
thing as a handkerchief

462
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,275
- on your person, would you?
- I don't.

463
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,815
Oh, you must.

464
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,115
Keep your hands to yourself!

465
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,954
No.

466
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,454
What manner of craft be this
we're cruisin' in?

467
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,083
What?

468
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,964
This craft.

469
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,587
- It's an automobile.
- Hey?

470
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,672
An automobile!

471
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,674
Oh, is it? Yes. Automonees.

472
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,427
Yes, autosomees.

473
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,140
Hey, sit down!

474
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,222
It's propelled by some animal
under the hatch, is it?

475
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,393
No, sit down!

476
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,388
What do you think you're doing?

477
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,098
I've a mind to have a hand at the helm.

478
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,686
Well, you've got another mind coming!

479
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,110
You're going to kill us, you idiot!

480
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,645
Take your hands off!

481
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,857
Or I'll bend a marlinspike
around your loaf!

482
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,325
I'll take the wheel.

483
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,244
I haven't finished my turn yet.

484
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,992
Wait!

485
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,282
- It's my turn!
- Get your hands off the wheel.

486
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,997
Feels like a weather helm.

487
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,332
I'll show her who's master!

488
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,506
No, no, no!

489
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,008
We're in the breakers, boy.

490
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,972
Back the main braces.
Stand by to wear ship, now!

491
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,636
Get your foot off of my dash.

492
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,770
Look out!

493
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,519
Ready about. Hard alee.

494
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,023
Avast, ya lubber!

495
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,363
A policeman!

496
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,111
Let go!

497
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,078
I'll give you the wheel later.

498
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,789
You've done it now, you dumb ox!

499
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,920
Steer outta the whirlpool.

500
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,510
Man overboard!

501
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,560
Your driver's license, please.

502
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,814
Who's the popinjay?

503
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,488
Will you stay out of this?

504
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,655
Well, Mr. Walker, I see we've been out

505
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,408
getting our nose wet
somewhere tonight.

506
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,113
It so happens, I don't drink.

507
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,083
What is that on the seat beside you?

508
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,333
It looks like a bottle of rum.

509
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,173
May I have it, please?

510
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,551
I believe you're right.
It is a bottle of rum.

511
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,888
Let the swab find his own rum, I say!

512
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:38,435
Will you give me this bottle and stop
making a nuisance out of yourself?

513
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,940
I'll take charge of that bottle,
if you don't mind.

514
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,272
You let go of the bottle, you idiot!

515
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,823
No need for epithets.

516
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,276
I'm only trying to do my job.

517
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,872
I'm afraid destruction of evidence
isn't going to help you.

518
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,874
Now this be the foulest crime of all,

519
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,497
wasting good spirits!

520
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,287
By thunder, this raises me blood!

521
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,293
No, don't do it!

522
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,085
There's no need for you
to get emotional about this.

523
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,050
You've had the fun.
Now take the consequences.

524
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,349
All right, I shan't harm him.

525
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,179
But this gentleman
needs a lesson in manners.

526
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,190
You're starting to come apart
at the seams.

527
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,650
All itchy, twitchy, talking to yourself.

528
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,945
<i>Dee dum dee, diddily dydee dum</i>

529
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:35,742
<i>Diddily dee aye dee diddily dum</i>

530
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,542
Cut it out, will ya, Blackbeard?

531
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,335
All right! Get out of the car!

532
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,663
Watch that thing!

533
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,332
Hey, look out!

534
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,136
Five balls in one load, matey!

535
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,299
Five!

536
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,218
Many's the time off the Maracaibos...

537
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,142
I could have done with
a prime darlin' like that.

538
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,384
Give way, you land lubber!

539
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,719
Whoo hoo!

540
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,509
The key, you idiot!

541
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,604
Turn off the key!

542
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,148
Think you can get away
from me, do you?

543
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,613
Ha, ha!

544
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,588
Hey, lad! That be better sport

545
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,554
than riding a humpback whale
in a hurricane!

546
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,931
Ha, ha, ha!

547
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,285
Care for a drench, son?

548
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,207
It'll brighten your scan.

549
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,747
You're still here, huh?

550
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,959
Aldetha's testament, I see.

551
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,508
Studying some way to get rid
of poor old Blackbeard?

552
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,385
How'd you guess?

553
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,133
I have been observing thee,

554
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,550
and I note that you have a bent

555
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,135
for getting yourself into trouble.

556
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,055
I get into trouble?

557
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,852
That is really rich! Ha, ha, ha!

558
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,151
Who do you suppose put me here?

559
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,403
Do you think I like this
mortal life of yours?

560
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,358
There doesn't seem to be
any honest joy anymore.

561
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,194
Your modern life seems to
have got small.

562
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,870
Everything's puckered up.

563
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,164
You call this a four poster bed?

564
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,874
Oh!

565
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,496
I'm down.

566
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,589
You won't get no comfort out of that.

567
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,838
If Aldetha laid that spell,
you can mark it a good one,

568
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,594
without no loopholes.

569
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,765
Now wait a minute,
Mrs. Stowecroft told me that curse.

570
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,303
Something about you having
to dwell forever in limbo.

571
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,846
- Limbo.
- Something, something...

572
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,432
Until there be found in you
some spark of human goodness.

573
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,525
Ha, ha!

574
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,945
Aldetha was bright as brass.

575
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,488
She knew me like a book.

576
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,821
You must have done something good.

577
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,486
Did you ever pat a dog?

578
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,530
Dog? Pet it?

579
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,823
Yes.

580
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,241
No, I never did pet it.

581
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,874
Did you ever help an
old lady across the street?

582
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,338
- That's silly.
- Anything?

583
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,042
No.

584
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,721
No, we're sunk, you and me.

585
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,260
Dead as pork.

586
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,139
Might as well...

587
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,220
Face up to it.

588
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,484
The little old ladies,

589
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,685
the Daughters of the Buccaneers.

590
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,238
Your own kith and kin,
give them your treasure.

591
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,905
- My treasure?
- Yeah.

592
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,241
The one people have been
talking about for so long.

593
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,277
It's hidden somewhere around here,
isn't it?

594
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,079
Never mind.

595
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,997
Why should I give them my treasure?

596
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,245
Why, you great ape!

597
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,455
Because you can do some good,
help them.

598
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,503
In helping them,
you might help yourself.

599
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,000
You might break the curse.

600
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,417
- You thinks this, does ye?
- Yes.

601
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,798
If you help those ladies save their home,

602
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,926
they'll name schools, bridges,
and highways after you.

603
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,763
Can't you see it?

604
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,178
"Teach Park."

605
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,435
"Teach Highway." See?

606
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:13,610
"The Edward Teach Memorial
Free Day Nursery."

607
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,944
Free?

608
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,901
- For babies.
- Oh, for babies.

609
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,815
Named for me, a wicked old pirate?

610
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,866
For nothing more than a
few chests of doubloons

611
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,694
and a few strands of jewels?

612
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,903
You bet they will.

613
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,490
In spite of the fact that I've got the blood

614
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,291
of a thousand gallant lads

615
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,826
still on my hands?

616
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,003
Forget the blood! I'm trying to!

617
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,000
Look, crack loose
with the treasure, huh?

618
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,676
It's the only way.

619
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,254
It don't sound right to me.

620
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,639
Of course it doesn't!

621
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,761
How would a creep like you

622
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,800
know the difference
between right and wrong?

623
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,477
That's why the curse held on so long.

624
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,055
Come on.

625
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,974
Where's the treasure?

626
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,269
- I s'pose I must trust you.
- Where is it?

627
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,607
The treasure?

628
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,318
- Want to know the treasure?
- Yeah.

629
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,780
Where is it?

630
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,783
Where's the treasure?

631
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,290
There ain't no treasure.

632
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,545
There ain't... What?

633
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,876
No! Not a penny!

634
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,504
There's not a doubloon,
not a bent peseta.

635
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,671
That is one of the most outrageous...

636
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,681
People have been searching

637
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,263
for that treasure for over two centuries!

638
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,725
Poor, unfortunate souls
grubbing and digging in the dirt.

639
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,353
I'm not good for nothing, I'm not!

640
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,277
Don't start crying again.

641
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,166
Look, you must have saved a few coins.

642
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,248
Something?

643
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,336
- I did have a treasure.
- Yeah?

644
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,208
- I had a big treasure.
- Yeah?

645
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,794
Lovely, I did.

646
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,214
I spent it all in one week...

647
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,723
Among the flesh pots and
gambling halls of Port Royal.

648
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,145
It was a glorious week.

649
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,191
You are a 100 percent total loss.

650
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,103
You're not even a respectable ghost!

651
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,399
You're a phony.

652
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,729
Aye?

653
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,732
A phony!

654
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,407
Oh, I've run aground.

655
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,922
If you ask me, the guy was stoned.

656
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,378
I say get rid of him!

657
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,091
The police report said they released
him for lack of evidence!

658
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,972
It says, "although the atmosphere
at the station

659
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:52,136
"reeked of cheap rum,
the test showed no trace of alcohol."

660
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,936
He probably figured some
way to neutralize the booze.

661
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,688
Science is doing stuff
like that these days.

662
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,236
Well, there's a corollary.

663
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,489
It says that Mr. Walker spoke loudly

664
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,238
to someone in his cell all night long.

665
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,493
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.

666
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,947
There was no one in the cell with him.

667
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,245
He's either stoned or nuts.

668
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,784
Either way, who needs it?

669
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,203
Professor, I left before the auction.

670
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,415
Did you notice any unusual behavior
in Mr. Walker?

671
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,340
Yes, I did.

672
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,211
When Silky Seymour
and his cheap hoodlums

673
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,296
scared everyone else,

674
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,806
he is the only one that
stood up like a man.

675
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,638
That's not fair.

676
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,519
If I may remind you, the Broxton relays
take place next month,

677
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,644
and our team needs its coach,
Mr. Walker.

678
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,651
I still say we ought to saw him off!

679
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,561
Just a minute, Mr. Purvis.

680
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:50,160
We have fielded a team
in the relays for 63 years.

681
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,989
We'll carry on the tradition
as best we can with Mr. Walker.

682
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,034
I'm sure you won't regret it.

683
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,502
Oh, Professor?

684
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,168
- Yes?
- I realize your field is child psychology,

685
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:07,343
however I'd appreciate it if
you'd keep an eye on Mr. Walker.

686
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,011
Oh, certainly.

687
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,047
It's the least I can do.

688
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,513
Does it strike you as odd,

689
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,937
that sooner or later all our
track coaches crack up?

690
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,059
I can understand the others,

691
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,641
but this one hasn't even seen the team.

692
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,191
Why has Fellspahr got
his fingers in his ears?

693
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,113
It's on account of the starter.

694
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,697
- You mean...
- Fellspahr's afraid of guns.

695
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,388
The way I figure it, we need more time

696
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,549
to whip these boys into shape.

697
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,515
You don't suppose
they'd postpone the meet?

698
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,638
No.

699
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,270
Okay, fellas. That's it for today.

700
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,692
Hit the showers.

701
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,237
Let's go, fellas! Lots of spirit!

702
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,074
How fares
your day today, eh?

703
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,535
As if I don't have enough troubles.

704
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,751
For a short, wonderful while,
I thought I'd lost you.

705
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,582
You know where I've been?

706
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:32,762
In Godolphin town, roaming the streets
of my young manhood,

707
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,966
soaking myself in nostalgia.

708
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,096
I know, I can smell it!

709
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,102
As fate would have it,

710
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,273
I went down to a
gambling establishment,

711
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,608
by name, "Silky's Place."

712
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,393
Take off, will you? I've got a lot to do.

713
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,279
I overheard some natives
on this subject of gambling.

714
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,943
Go away! I mean it.

715
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,200
If there's been one passion of my life,

716
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,948
it's been the placing of
a gold or silver coin

717
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,112
upon a wager.

718
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,699
So, when I heard... Listen to this!

719
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,206
Fifty to one on the forthcoming
enterprise of your rabbits,

720
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,416
oh, with all that...

721
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,879
What?

722
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,423
You want to win, don't you?

723
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,629
I can teach you how.

724
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,794
- Forget it!
- Why should I?

725
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,008
I was a good hand at
teaching young crews.

726
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,550
It was no accident
that I was the finest pirate

727
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,853
ever to sail the Spanish main.

728
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,807
Or the Portuguese main,
either, for that matter.

729
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,187
Now, you'll ask with some impatience,

730
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,483
"Why was this?"

731
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,319
I'll tell you why.

732
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,531
I trained my men to win!

733
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,282
Win!

734
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,318
Always win!

735
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,746
By fair means or foul,
by soft words and hard deeds,

736
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:44,326
by treachery, by cunning,
by malpractice,

737
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,252
but always... Win.

738
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,999
You have the brass to ask me
to let you train my team?

739
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,210
I'm not doing this for myself, believe me.

740
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:58,632
I'm doing this for those
dear, sweet, old ladies.

741
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,471
Yes, I am.

742
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,853
The little lavender-scented ladies,
I like to call them,

743
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,932
that stagger up their
rickety staircases at night,

744
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,391
their lanterns held aloft,

745
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,522
when the light got bad for knitting,

746
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,689
and say to one another,
"Ellen, where is our ship?

747
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:20,241
"Of which Blackbeard is captain, and
which may never come to port at all."

748
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,367
Never mind the snow job!

749
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,749
I feel as sorry for them as you do.

750
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,201
Yes, I do!

751
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,753
That doesn't give you leave to
put your bloody paws on my team.

752
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,081
Stay away from those boys!

753
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,463
If we win, which I doubt,
we'll do it without cheating.

754
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,885
Without cheating? Ha, ha!

755
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,462
You've never lived, boy.

756
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,592
Go away!

757
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,139
Go maroon yourself somewhere!

758
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,140
You don't know what life is made of!

759
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,309
You see?

760
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,362
There he goes again.

761
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,110
I don't know what his problem is,

762
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,070
but whatever it is, it's a beaut.

763
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,582
Your observations so far
have been inconclusive.

764
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,001
I can't tell if he's all keyed up
over the track meet,

765
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,125
or if there are outside pressures
we don't know about.

766
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:15,842
I just haven't been able
to get a close-range view.

767
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,294
Pity.

768
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,754
I am having dinner with him tonight.

769
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,386
He asked you to have dinner?

770
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,469
Not exactly. I asked him.

771
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,721
Do you think that's wise?

772
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,312
It's entirely within
my discretionary powers

773
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,984
as head of the committee
to welcome new faculty

774
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,313
and students to Godolphin college.

775
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,443
We don't have any such committee.

776
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,532
We do now.

777
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,985
Oh.

778
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,324
Oh, yes.

779
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,180
Hello, Professor. Nice to see you.

780
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,353
Mr. Walker, we meet again.

781
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,809
Looks that way.

782
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,016
Tell you what. Let me buy you
a good lobster dinner.

783
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,400
Afterwards we'll drop into the back
and have a whirl at lady luck.

784
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,484
Thank you,

785
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,237
but that's not likely.

786
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,703
There's no harm in asking, is there?

787
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,158
Leon, see that my friends
get a nice table.

788
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,951
This way, please.

789
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,709
Enjoy your dinner.

790
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,837
- What's he doing here?
- Mr. Seymour owns this place.

791
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,169
I'm sorry but it's the best
restaurant in town.

792
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,348
Mmm.

793
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,314
How's the action?

794
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,214
- I can't tell you how I appreciate this.
- Appreciate what?

795
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,722
- Your suggesting dinner tonight.
- That's all right.

796
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,258
The committee stands
ready to advise, counsel,

797
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,436
and extend a helping hand
to the newcomer, at all times.

798
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,397
Actually, I do need
someone I can talk to.

799
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,559
I've had a problem
for a couple of weeks,

800
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,485
and I've been afraid
to talk to somebody,

801
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,280
because they might think I was silly.

802
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,909
- Please, go on.
- Thank you.

803
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,820
It started the night of the auction.

804
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,324
I sat down on the bed
to remove my shoes,

805
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,751
I wasn't paying much attention
to what I was doing,

806
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,414
and I sat right down on
that antique bed warmer.

807
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,753
I broke the handle right off.

808
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,881
- Don't let that bother you.
- No, it wasn't that.

809
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,047
I think I have the address

810
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,306
of a shop down on Main Street.

811
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,596
Professor, wait a minute.

812
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,017
- Wow!
- What's the matter?

813
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:19,316
Aren't you afraid to carry all that
around with you?

814
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:23,862
I'm taking it to the bank in the morning.

815
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,940
It belongs to the Daughters
of the Buccaneers.

816
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:29,201
The little old ladies and their mortgage.

817
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,952
I hope they're gonna make it.

818
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,366
Mr. Walker, this is only $900.

819
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,286
Unless $37,000, or a miracle,

820
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,337
turns up by tomorrow night,

821
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,585
those ladies will lose their home.

822
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:46,048
Sorry to hear that.

823
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,094
Can't you borrow from the bank?

824
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,423
Not at the moment,

825
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,809
but we were talking about your problem.

826
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,311
Yeah, my problem.

827
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,309
- Mr. Walker?
- Yeah?

828
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,818
Are we looking for somebody?

829
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,946
Yes, my problem.

830
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,609
Your first inclination is gonna be...

831
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,995
Is gonna be not to believe this.

832
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,580
Hear me out, please.

833
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,702
- Certainly.
- It was the night of the auction.

834
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,709
That's when he first appeared.

835
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,882
Because of him,
I spent the first night in jail,

836
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,801
and I haven't been able
to get him off my back.

837
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,846
Is he here now?

838
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,382
No, I don't see him around now.

839
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,560
- But I smell him.
- Smell him?

840
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,309
He's got breath that would stun a horse.

841
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,183
He's a booze-guzzling old cutthroat,

842
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,815
and he's latched onto me
as his buddy-buddy.

843
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,572
Does he have a name?

844
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,366
Who does he claim to be?

845
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,697
Uh...

846
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,369
Blackbeard's ghost.

847
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,827
- Blackbeard's ghost?
- Yeah.

848
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,206
How can you be sure he's
the real Blackbeard's ghost?

849
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,087
He's got whiskers...

850
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,964
He's got a cutlass.
He's got the whole bit!

851
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,846
That must be who
I saw you talking to today.

852
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,508
That's what I've been
afraid to tell anybody.

853
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,052
I mean, they'd think I was nuts.

854
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,354
Well,

855
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,732
I don't think anybody would think that.

856
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,359
You certainly do have a problem.

857
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,565
- I've got a problem.
- Oh, yes.

858
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,864
- Will you order now, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

859
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,078
- Madame.
- Thank you.

860
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,586
Our shore dinners are
very good this evening.

861
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,592
That sounds good to me,
how about you, Professor?

862
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,720
The shore dinners
are excellent.

863
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,131
Fine. Two shore dinners.

864
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:59,094
Very good, sir. Would you like
our special dressing on your salad?

865
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,933
That's fine.

866
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,475
Please, go on.

867
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,313
I don't want to bug somebody
else with my problems.

868
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,774
- I want to hear.
- Okay.

869
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,735
You were telling me how
you met captain Blackbeard.

870
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:20,077
Right. Where was I?

871
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,829
You were sitting
on your antique bed warmer.

872
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,003
Right.
The handle broke right off.

873
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,839
It turned out to be hollow.

874
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,300
I thought nothing of it for a moment,

875
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,963
then I noticed that there was
something rolled up inside.

876
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,597
Dusty old paper.

877
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,304
I thought it was gonna fall apart

878
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,431
right in my hands.

879
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,812
It gave me a funny feeling.

880
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,145
Oh, you poor man.

881
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,321
Did you hurt yourself?

882
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,981
I'm so sorry.

883
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,320
It's just a little water.

884
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,326
No harm done.

885
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,869
- Will madame please forgive me?
- Certainly.

886
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,664
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.

887
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,797
You just missed the first race
at Green Meadows.

888
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,091
"Godolphin...

889
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,801
"To...

890
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,220
"Win."

891
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:31,353
Nine hundred dollars.

892
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,034
<i>They're in the starting gate now.</i>

893
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,911
<i>There's the rabbit, and they're off.</i>

894
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,870
<i>Coming past the grandstand is Pilsen,
leading the field.</i>

895
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,707
<i>Hello Baby is second,
Rainy Weather is third,</i>

896
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,712
<i>and Daddy Dumpling is fourth.</i>

897
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,589
<i>At the first turn,
it's Pilsen by two lengths,</i>

898
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,465
<i>Rainy Weather moving into second,</i>

899
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,888
<i>Hello Baby and Daddy Dumpling.</i>

900
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,844
This your bet, Danny?

901
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,013
Why do you think I'm standing here?

902
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,643
I hope you know what you're doing.

903
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,694
Let me worry about that.

904
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,365
Be right back.

905
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,948
<i>It's Hello Baby.</i>

906
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,029
Mr. Seymour,

907
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,449
take a look at this.

908
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,036
- Godolphin to win? Who's the patsy?
- Danny Oley.

909
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,171
His money's as good as anybody else's.

910
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,749
What price are you making?

911
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:38,427
For an old customer,
let's make it interesting.

912
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,221
Say, 50 to one.

913
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,142
<i>It's Daddy Dumpling.</i>
<i>Aunt Pavla is second,</i>

914
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:48,312
<i>Pilsen is third, Dandy Andy is fourth.</i>

915
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,852
Okay, Danny.

916
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,688
<i>It's Dandy Andy,</i>

917
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,775
<i>Aunt Pavla, Daddy Dumpling,
and Snow Queen.</i>

918
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,778
<i>At the finish, it's Snow Queen!</i>

919
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,454
Winsome Lass to win in the second.

920
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,794
What's the matter?

921
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,964
You just made a bet.

922
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,461
Something closing in on you?

923
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,968
This is my bet.

924
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,137
Don't you remember?

925
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,595
You bet Godolphin $900
to win the Broxton Relay.

926
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,476
I bet? Come on.

927
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,810
I wouldn't bet on Godolphin
to start with the letter "G."

928
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,986
Skipping all the technical language

929
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,318
and getting down to the point,

930
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,107
I would say,

931
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,653
if you'll ignore him, he'll go away.

932
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,698
He's not so easy to ignore.

933
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,742
Please, try. I know you can do it.

934
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,709
Sitting here with you like this,

935
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,457
I almost believe you're right.

936
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,590
I will try.

937
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,384
Bravo!

938
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,009
Just say, "Farewell, Blackbeard,

939
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:07,016
"bother me no more."

940
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,140
I like the sound of that,
but just in case it doesn't work,

941
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,180
may I call on you at any time?

942
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,225
Somehow, you give me
a feeling of security.

943
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,692
Oh, certainly.

944
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,695
Why be the head
of a committee

945
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,197
unless you intend to do your job?

946
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,788
Oh, no.

947
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,492
Sorry about the ice cream.

948
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,082
It's quite all right,

949
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,297
but I think I'll skip dessert.

950
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,463
Just the check, please.

951
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,974
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

952
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,057
Shall we?

953
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:00,061
Oh, excuse me.

954
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,441
Good night, ma'am.

955
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,493
- Good night.
- Good night.

956
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,596
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?

957
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:31,767
Mel Willis here, and welcome
to <i>Sports Spectacular,</i>

958
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,766
coming to you this week
from Broxton Field,

959
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,769
<i>home of the famous national
track and field event,</i>

960
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,692
<i>the Broxton Invitational Relays.</i>

961
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,769
<i>As you sports fans know,</i>

962
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,403
<i>there are four college teams
represented here tonight.</i>

963
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,659
<i>Three of these squads
are numbered among</i>

964
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,907
<i>the outstanding teams in the nation.</i>

965
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,912
<i>As for the fourth,</i>

966
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,540
<i>little Godolphin College
from across the river...</i>

967
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,583
<i>In the old days,</i>

968
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,837
<i>the Godolphin track squad
took a backseat to no one.</i>

969
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,630
<i>They had a great tradition,</i>

970
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:06,464
<i>but those good old days
seem to be gone forever.</i>

971
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,470
Look at this event not as
an ordinary track meet,

972
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,383
but as a preparation for life.

973
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,389
Some of you are graduating soon.

974
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,311
You're gonna find the world out there

975
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:20,732
full of nothing but trouble,
frustration, and strife.

976
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,901
I tell you right now
that nowhere will you find

977
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,445
a better preparation
for that world outside,

978
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,403
than to be a member
of this particular track team.

979
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,985
All right, it's time to go,

980
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,992
but I want you to know,

981
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,699
no matter what happens
out there tonight,

982
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,581
in my heart,
each one of you is a champion.

983
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,753
Let's go!

984
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,379
Pardon me, Professor.

985
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,516
Oh, Jo Anne.

986
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,936
We can use all the good
wishes we can get.

987
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,890
I certainly do wish your team good luck.

988
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,940
However, that is not why I'm here.

989
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,815
- Oh.
- You may recall

990
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,948
that last night I placed
the sum of $900 in my bag,

991
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,196
and when I opened it this morning,

992
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,490
I found this in its place.

993
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,039
"$900 on Godolphin."

994
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,828
I appreciate the gesture of confidence,
but you shouldn't have done it.

995
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,372
Mr. Walker,
in the first place I do not bet,

996
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:29,176
and if I did, I would not embezzle funds

997
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,052
that have been placed
in my trust to do it.

998
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:35,178
- Well then, how did it happen?
- You were the only person

999
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,343
to know that I had
that money in my purse.

1000
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,807
It's that rotten pirate.

1001
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,060
He took the money meant
for those little old ladies.

1002
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,600
Someone took it.

1003
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,562
Now I remember. Your purse went off...

1004
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,071
You don't think I did it, do you?

1005
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,824
You can't expect me to credit that story.

1006
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,652
That's exactly what happened!

1007
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,578
Didn't you say you
believed in the pirate?

1008
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,706
Not $900 worth.

1009
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,741
Besides, I believe in him

1010
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:04,078
as a metaphysical image,

1011
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:07,589
not some stupid, sticky-fingered goop.

1012
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,841
That's exactly what he is.

1013
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,420
- Coach, it's beginning.
- I'll be right there.

1014
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,806
I shan't bother you anymore.

1015
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,850
I want you to know
that I understand perfectly.

1016
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,177
Your motives were good,

1017
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,265
even though your reasoning
was perfectly idiotic!

1018
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,654
<i>Oy-de-di-de-do</i>

1019
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,286
You regard me strangely, son.

1020
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,415
Something amiss?

1021
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,423
- You took that money.
- Money?

1022
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,961
Money. Oh, the odd flimsy

1023
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:58,049
I removed from the purse of
your bookish wench.

1024
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,634
Why should that stir your ire?

1025
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,311
Because it belongs
to the little old ladies!

1026
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,766
You know that I replaced that
money with a piece of paper

1027
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,356
what will bring great wealth
to them small old ladies,

1028
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,858
money in fifty-fold.

1029
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,360
I can't trust no one.

1030
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,612
I'll deal with this matter personally.

1031
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,744
How do you figure to do that?

1032
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,742
By bringing a victory in this sport event,

1033
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,324
which is taking place out there
this moment.

1034
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,996
Ah ha! I told you once to keep...
Give me that rubbing alcohol!

1035
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:31,548
- Dangerous move, me hearty.
- That's not to drink!

1036
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,000
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1037
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,336
A little late to think about that, isn't it?

1038
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,056
Let's get one thing straight.

1039
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,009
Keep your grubby paws off of my boys.

1040
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:45,179
I don't know what you're
trying to do out there,

1041
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:49,187
but you're not gonna do it.
My team may not win,

1042
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,569
but whatever they do,
they're gonna do it honestly.

1043
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,021
Come on, Coach!

1044
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:57,612
We've come in last
in two events already.

1045
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,865
Hands off. You got that?

1046
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,294
"Come on, Coach, will ya?

1047
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,294
"We've come in last
in two events already."

1048
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,046
You've never been right.

1049
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,049
All right, play it whatever way you like,

1050
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,301
you puppy.

1051
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,304
You'll get no help from me.

1052
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,683
You'll come crawlin' back here, you will.

1053
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,564
I'll bring my boot to you,

1054
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:36,071
and I'll grind your mealymouthed jib
into the dirt!

1055
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,066
I will.

1056
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,164
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's going just as I predicted.

1057
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,287
Broxton has won the first three events,

1058
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,869
followed by Tidewater Tech and State,

1059
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,504
and lastly, little Godolphin College,

1060
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,924
which has not scored a single point,

1061
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,461
nor, in my humble opinion,
seems likely to.

1062
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,761
<i>The discus throw.</i>

1063
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,432
<i>L.J. Sewell of Broxton College,
the first contestant.</i>

1064
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,443
It looks like a new meet record!

1065
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:18,230
<i>Sewell of
Broxton College,</i>

1066
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,740
<i>210 feet, 11 inches.</i>

1067
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:24,529
Bagwell, just remember
to let go on the second turn.

1068
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,034
Let go second turn. Right, Coach.

1069
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,619
<i>Bagwell
of Godolphin College</i>

1070
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,037
<i>ready on the discus throw.</i>

1071
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,293
How I dread this.

1072
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,672
Let go!

1073
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,055
<i>Bagwell
of Godolphin...</i>

1074
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,140
You know, Dean,
this whole thing bugs me.

1075
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,935
You take the profits
made by my football boys,

1076
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,148
then go right out and blow it

1077
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,481
on sweat socks and stuff
for this crummy team.

1078
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,816
Excuse me.

1079
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,487
Would you spare me
your usual soliloquy?

1080
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,781
May I speak with you?

1081
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,824
Certainly. Anytime.

1082
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,663
Run along, fellas.

1083
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,621
Professor, what can I do for you?

1084
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,630
Well, yesterday,

1085
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,292
I shan't explain how,

1086
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:23,883
but $900 belonging to the
Daughters of the Buccaneers

1087
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:26,590
was bet on Godolphin.

1088
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,016
Say now,

1089
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:31,061
so the bet was all your doing, huh?

1090
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,309
Well, I...

1091
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,145
I was wondering if you
would be kind enough

1092
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,355
to cancel the bet and give us back
the money?

1093
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:41,363
Professor, I'm a man of principle.

1094
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:45,784
My guardian principle has always been,
a bet's a bet.

1095
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,738
But look at those poor old ladies.

1096
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,664
You know they have nowhere to go.

1097
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:55,544
I've been thinking about
those dear old girls,

1098
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:59,627
living in that drafty inn,
working their fingers to the bone,

1099
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,549
living from hand to mouth,

1100
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,049
cluttering up that valuable
piece of real estate.

1101
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,256
Do they know about this?

1102
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,676
Of couse not.
I wouldn't dare raise false hopes.

1103
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:16,144
- Then you won't give it back?
- Sweetness, what do you take me for?

1104
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,851
Professor, you'd better hold onto this.

1105
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,817
That may become very
valuable someday.

1106
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,739
I know your sort.

1107
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,862
<i>Ready for the start
of the mile run.</i>

1108
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,574
<i>Contestants will take their positions.</i>

1109
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:38,294
My great-great
granddaughters.

1110
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,543
Oh.

1111
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,759
By thunder!

1112
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,639
There be a time for action!

1113
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,515
Oh, ladies, Blackbeard's coming.

1114
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,891
Up the Jolly Roger!

1115
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,987
- Ahh!
- Oof!

1116
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,908
Let's see where we stand now.

1117
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,115
The mile run is in its second lap.

1118
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,822
Leading at the moment is Broxton.

1119
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:18,460
Over at the high jump,
Shockley of Godolphin.

1120
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,799
What was that?

1121
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,880
Unusual jumping style.

1122
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,303
Ow!

1123
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,595
Hey, Coach,
Shockley just cleared 6'11"!

1124
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,178
- Our Shockley?
- And they're trying for seven feet!

1125
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:44,604
<i>Shockley
of Godolphin jumping.</i>

1126
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,492
<i>He clears the bar
at seven feet.</i>

1127
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,491
Great stuff!

1128
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,530
We never know, do we?

1129
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:58,492
It only proves that nothing is certain.

1130
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:02,663
Just a moment.
Here's the final lap of the mile run.

1131
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,665
Excuse me.

1132
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,760
You idiot!

1133
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,598
Come back here!

1134
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,605
I don't need these, of course,

1135
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,688
but just for a moment it looked like
they were running backward.

1136
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,569
They are.

1137
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:35,328
Keep going!

1138
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,600
Come join the Morris dance, lad!

1139
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,727
'Twill raise your reedy spirits.

1140
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,396
I'm telling you to get off this field,

1141
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,278
right now!

1142
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:20,912
If you ask me, he makes a better
pom-pom girl than a coach.

1143
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:26,337
<i>It's Chulay of Godolphin,
ready with the javelin throw.</i>

1144
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,762
Stop!

1145
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,390
Where do you think you're going?

1146
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:49,440
<i>270 feet, four inches
for Chulay of Godolphin.</i>

1147
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,120
<i>The shot put event,</i>

1148
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,158
<i>Wilkins of Broxton College
the first contestant.</i>

1149
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,749
Why do you want to enter a protest?

1150
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,792
You just won the last three events.

1151
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,711
It wasn't us, it was...

1152
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:21,096
- Look. He's at it again.
- I'm looking.

1153
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,811
Wilkins is a little off form tonight.

1154
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,942
That comes to five feet, 11 inches.

1155
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,362
- Did you see that?
- Okay, he flubbed.

1156
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,994
What's the big problem?

1157
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,042
<i>And now,</i>

1158
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:50,213
<i>Gudger Larkin of Godolphin
is ready with his effort.</i>

1159
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,969
<i>It's not much...</i>

1160
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,397
<i>It's coming this way.</i>

1161
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,363
<i>72 feet,
three inches,</i>

1162
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,281
<i>a new shot put record for Larkin.</i>

1163
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,538
I have to see some sweet
old ladies about a bet.

1164
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,335
Godolphin to win? Are you crazy?

1165
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:36,501
Not yet, but the evening's still young.

1166
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,630
Mr. Seymour!

1167
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,518
Ooh!

1168
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,989
Stop your babbling.

1169
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:02,239
- Listen...
- We're under pressure, too!

1170
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,570
Pressure.

1171
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,872
<i>The bar is set at
17 feet, five inches.</i>

1172
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,579
<i>First contestant, Carson of Broxton.</i>

1173
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,452
He's gone too far!

1174
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:11,878
Nail him!

1175
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:22,756
One more disturbance,
you'll be ruled off the field entirely.

1176
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,765
Is that clear?

1177
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,742
<i>Neilson

1179
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,294
Go, Godolphin!

1180
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:58,504
- You're never excited at a football game.
- Yeah, Godolphin!

1181
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,085
May I tell you something?

1182
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:04,222
Yeah, Godolphin! I hate football.

1183
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,299
Yeah, Godolphin!

1184
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,342
I've always hated football!

1185
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,019
Go, go!

1186
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:15,601
What do you think
of your old matey now?

1187
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:20,818
They could hang me
for what I think of you now!

1188
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,618
You are the lowest, most underhanded

1189
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,449
miserable excuse for what
used to be a human being

1190
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,989
that I've ever been connected with!

1191
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,992
I thought I was helping you.

1192
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,295
Helping? That's a yock for you.

1193
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,173
You said yourself that if
I helped them old ladies,

1194
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,172
that that would contribute
towards me own salvation.

1195
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,346
You haven't helped anybody.

1196
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,802
Haven't helped anybody?

1197
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,020
I perceive now how difficult it is

1198
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,347
to do a good deed in this...

1199
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,979
...dirty world.

1200
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,400
I can see now why the very
mention of your name

1201
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:03,322
used to give everybody the creeps.

1202
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,405
I'm gonna find a comfortable place

1203
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,862
and rest there, somewhere,

1204
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,869
and I'm going to stay out of your affairs.

1205
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:15,543
That's the best news I've had in years.

1206
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:19,206
I'm gonna disappear myself,
that's what I'm gonna do.

1207
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:23,422
Mr. Sanctimonious Scupperlout,

1208
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,721
sink me if I raise so much as a finger
to help you again.

1209
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:32,393
I'd rather spend a winter of eternities
in limbo

1210
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,018
than knock knees a tick longer

1211
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,729
with a nit like you.

1212
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,769
There, I've said it.

1213
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,605
<i>The relay races
are about to begin.</i>

1214
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,613
Don't you see what he's trying to do?

1215
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:51,162
He wants to make me
as crooked as he is,

1216
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,615
but I've got my principles.

1217
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,747
Where would any of us be
without our principles?

1218
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,749
You betcha.

1219
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,455
Godolphin,

1220
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,711
perennial underdog for two decades,

1221
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,796
has come back with a big bang.

1222
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:08,049
Coach Walker of Godolphin,
the man of the hour.

1223
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,057
Throwing in an attack
of dazzling new techniques,

1224
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,809
his inspired team of star performers

1225
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:16,854
is in a tie with Broxton.

1226
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,148
Victory hangs in the balance

1227
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,359
as we come to the final event.

1228
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:25,029
The question,
what happens as Godolphin faces

1229
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,402
Broxton's mighty relay team?

1230
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,740
Gentlemen, take your marks.

1231
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,409
Set.

1232
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,550
Come on, Broxton! Run, you punk!

1233
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,968
Go, Godolphin! Come on!

1234
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,016
At the end of the first lap,

1235
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,769
the first three runners
are closely bunched.

1236
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,934
They pass the baton for
the start of the second lap.

1237
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,819
It's Broxton first, Tidewater second,

1238
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,480
State third,

1239
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,907
and there's the Godolphin man,

1240
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,859
laboring along in the rear.

1241
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,663
Easy now, Coach. You're tensing up.

1242
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,832
Maybe I shouldn't have yelled at him.

1243
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,457
How's a dumb pirate supposed
to know what principles are?

1244
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:25,840
- But I do. I shave every...
- I shave, too.

1245
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,843
You've gotta live with yourself.

1246
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,420
I gotta go with my principles.

1247
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,380
- You do that.
- I will.

1248
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,639
It's just about all over.

1249
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,550
Middle of the second lap,

1250
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:40,480
Broxton is already
half a lap ahead of Godolphin.

1251
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:45,022
Do we win something for fourth place?

1252
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,025
I'm afraid not.

1253
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,698
You see those little old ladies up there?

1254
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,359
I'm gonna let those little old ladies

1255
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,370
get tossed right out on their ear.

1256
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:59,498
- How's that for a principle?
- Well...

1257
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,460
<i>Beginning
the third lap,</i>

1258
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:09,543
<i>Broxton is first, followed by
Tidewater, State and Godolphin.</i>

1259
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:12,336
Who says you can't win 'em all?

1260
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,972
Let's get out of this folk festival.

1261
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,219
Look at Silky and his boys.

1262
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,051
All they wanna do is squeeze
every loose nickel out of this county.

1263
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:21,187
Just because I have a chance
to cut their water off

1264
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,893
doesn't mean I have to get mixed up in it.

1265
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,116
Don't sit there now,
you coldhearted creep!

1266
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,321
Do something!

1267
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,372
What are you going to do about them?

1268
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:48,916
You gonna let them get pushed around
because of my principles?

1269
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,672
You started it, finish it!

1270
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:04,934
Move it!

1271
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,325
Some day I'm going to strangle him.
Come on, hurry!

1272
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,954
As we approach the last lap,

1273
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,868
Broxton is leading.

1274
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,045
He passes the baton to...

1275
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,463
He didn't.

1276
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:34,673
The Broxton anchor man
is running the last lap

1277
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:37,676
with... A hot dog?

1278
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,634
Ttidewater makes their pass.

1279
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,981
State makes their pass, and...

1280
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:48,482
I believe, yes,

1281
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:52,061
the State anchor man has a bottle.

1282
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,405
The Godolphin man who was behind

1283
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,328
approaches the passing zone.

1284
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,905
Go, Godolphin!

1285
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:11,457
A perfect change! Larkin of Godolphin
is the only one of the four anchor men

1286
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:14,000
to have completed a clean pass.

1287
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,006
He streaks past the other contestants,

1288
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,679
who are on their way back
to retrieve their batons!

1289
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:26,187
We have a slight hang up
in the passing zone.

1290
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,643
Dewey, of State, has got
ahold of Broxton's baton,

1291
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,687
it's the hot dog.

1292
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:39,863
Carver of Broxton has got
ahold of two batons.

1293
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:43,200
No, one is snatched away
by Wilson of Tidewater!

1294
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,247
Stop foolin' around!

1295
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:51,454
Gudger Larkin has taken advantage
of the rhubarb,

1296
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:54,586
and has forged almost
a third of a lap ahead.

1297
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:57,293
Catch 'em!

1298
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,213
Go!

1299
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:07,179
Larkin is still in front,
but the others are hot on his heels!

1300
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,221
Stop him!

1301
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:12,016
Not that, you meathead.

1302
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,269
Go, Godolphin!

1303
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,739
Get up. Get up!

1304
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:37,584
<i>The final event
is won by Godolphin.</i>

1305
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:56,026
Ahh!

1306
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:05,027
Get away from me, you old bats!

1307
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,530
We won! We won!

1308
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:10,457
All 45,000 smackeroos!

1309
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:13,461
Technically maybe we won,
but actually...

1310
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:16,964
- Brilliant work!
- When you hear what I have to say...

1311
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,088
What is there to say?
The scoreboard says it all!

1312
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,757
Thank you, thank you!

1313
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,051
Whoa!

1314
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:31,520
Ha-ha-ha!

1315
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,236
No rough stuff, old ladies.

1316
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,489
You be nice to him.

1317
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,907
We're so happy, Mr. Ainsworth
from the bank is coming over,

1318
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,579
and you can give him the money.

1319
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:54,752
And on the stroke of midnight, we'd like
Mr. Walker to burn the mortgage.

1320
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,170
He's done so much for us.

1321
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:59,173
Where is Mr. Walker,
who's done so much for us?

1322
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,129
I believe he's up in his room.

1323
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,589
- Is anything wrong?
- Excuse me.

1324
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,009
But why go now?

1325
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,349
The lads have triumphed,
the wager is won.

1326
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,052
Your wench is happy.

1327
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,604
There's enough money set aside
for the old ladies.

1328
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,432
I fail to define your reason for leaving.

1329
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,020
Well, don't strain your brain.

1330
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:22,359
When the mortgage is consigned
to the flames tonight,

1331
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,985
there's a very good chance

1332
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,525
the horrible curse may be
lifted off my good self,

1333
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,824
in which case you may be able
to settle down to a serene,

1334
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:33,332
albeit somewhat dull life, without me.

1335
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,793
Look, frizzface,

1336
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:40,043
you think I can stay around
here after what happened tonight?

1337
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,380
What am I supposed to do
for an encore?

1338
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,720
I'm bailing out.

1339
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:51,384
I'm going somewhere where I can make
a fresh start, honestly, this time.

1340
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,853
Very well. It be no concern of mine.

1341
01:22:55,512 --> 01:23:00,109
I just think it may be a little early
for you to be striking your colors!

1342
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,645
Strike... Come in!

1343
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:05,864
Oh. Hi.

1344
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,275
Where are you going?

1345
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,571
I'm leaving.

1346
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:12,784
After taking my money and stirring
everything up, you're running off

1347
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:15,161
and leaving us in the lurch?
No, you don't!

1348
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,250
What are you talking about?
You got it back, didn't you?

1349
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,911
No, I didn't.

1350
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,954
Silky welshed on the bet.

1351
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,210
He what?

1352
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:26,882
He laughed and said
he wasn't gonna pay off.

1353
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,713
He's throwing Miss Stowecroft and the
others out first thing in the morning.

1354
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,476
Under normal conditions,
if I can remember such a time,

1355
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:37,430
I have a sweet and a loveable nature.

1356
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:38,726
You know what I think?

1357
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,391
If I may proffer a suggestion...

1358
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:41,684
Shut up!

1359
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,317
Both of you.

1360
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,151
Both of who?

1361
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:50,776
I am tired of people thinking and
suggesting and giving me cheap advice.

1362
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:54,121
What I am gonna do,
I am gonna find that happy hoodlum,

1363
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:56,119
and I am gonna ring that money

1364
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,075
out of his crooked little neck!

1365
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,832
You can't, not in your condition.

1366
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,003
What condition?

1367
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:04,423
Anyone can see you're
hallucinating again.

1368
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,963
You can't fight Silky and his men.

1369
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,216
She's right.
This be a job what takes innards.

1370
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,421
Innards?

1371
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,512
Well, you just sit here
and contemplate yours.

1372
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,968
I've got a job to do.

1373
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,682
Permission to come with you, sir?

1374
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,685
No, buddy boy.

1375
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,734
No more of your big ideas.
I'm calling the shots.

1376
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:26,028
Proud to serve under you, sir.

1377
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,782
You mean that?

1378
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,660
My word, sir, is the ultimate warranty.

1379
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:38,490
All right, let's go!

1380
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:39,829
Ah ha!

1381
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:43,541
- Make ready the boarding party.
- Thank ye, admiral.

1382
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,503
Cutlass. You might need that.

1383
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,093
Uh-huh. What?

1384
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,340
It's on the bed.

1385
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,176
Oh, Steve,

1386
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,259
you really have flipped.

1387
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:59,220
Beat to quarters, drummer boy.

1388
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,020
<i>Come cheer up my lads</i>

1389
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,318
<i>'Tis to glory we steer</i>

1390
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,978
<i>With heads bearing high</i>

1391
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,818
<i>We will banish all fear</i>

1392
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,528
<i>To honor we call</i>

1393
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,026
<i>- You are free men, not slaves
- Free men</i>

1394
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,204
<i>For who are so free
as the sons of the waves</i>

1395
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,202
<i>Hearts of oak are our ships</i>

1396
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:21,079
<i>Jolly tars are our men</i>

1397
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,626
<i>We'll always be ready</i>

1398
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,500
<i>Steady, boys</i>

1399
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,164
<i>We'll fight and we'll conquer</i>

1400
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,082
<i>Again and again</i>

1401
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,510
<i>Hearts of oak</i>

1402
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,758
Steve!

1403
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:37,471
<i>We'll always be ready
steady, boys, steady</i>

1404
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,769
I'm not letting you go to that place alone.

1405
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,773
<i>Jolly tars are our men</i>

1406
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:52,732
<i>We'll always be ready
steady, boys, steady</i>

1407
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:56,409
<i>We'll fight and we'll
conquer again and again</i>

1408
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,283
Once more, lad. Sing out.

1409
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,831
Don't mumble!

1410
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,579
<i>Come cheer up, my lads</i>

1411
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,493
<i>'Tis to glory we steer</i>

01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:07,997
<i>With heads bearing high
we will banish all fear</i>

1413
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,174
Steve, wait!

1414
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:15,921
<i>For who are so free
as the sons of the waves</i>

1415
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:17,760
<i>Hearts of oak are our ships</i>

1416
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,092
<i>Jolly tars are our men</i>

1417
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:24,931
<i>We'll always be ready

1418
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:28,688
<i>We'll fight and we'll conquer
again and again</i>

1419
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,157
Oh, you again?

1420
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,958
We'd like to see Mr. Seymour.

1421
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:48,128
Look, sister.
I'm telling you once and for all,

1422
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:51,840
Mr. Seymour don't wanna see... Ugh!

1423
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,682
Come on.

1424
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,646
<i>Ouch!</i>

1425
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,069
I'll be with you in a minute.

1426
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,958
Now, what can I do for you?

1427
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,585
We're here to collect the money
you owe Professor Baker.

1428
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,380
The money I owe her?

1429
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:35,505
You've gotta be kidding.

1430
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,004
You're gonna pay her
that money, or I'll...

1431
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:45,139
Or what, Mr. Walker?

1432
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,191
Or we might have to get tough.

1433
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,192
Do I get some action, or don't I?

1434
01:27:56,730 --> 01:28:00,200
Mr. Walker, I have got
to admire your style.

1435
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,826
I'll tell you what.

1436
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:06,165
There's no use beating up
a guy who's the town hero tonight.

1437
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,496
It's bad for my image.

1438
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:10,870
Professor,

1439
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:14,085
here's the $900
you put down on the bet.

1440
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,632
Go ahead, take it.

1441
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:19,962
Oh, no! You know very well we need the
full amount you rightfully owe us.

1442
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:21,262
Professor,

1443
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,892
if I pay you back all that loot,

1444
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:28,179
then you'll give it to the old ladies,

1445
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,564
who'll pay back the bank, right?

1446
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,816
And bingo, there goes
my childhood dream

1447
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:36,612
of running a class gambling joint
like they have out west.

1448
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:39,190
I'm sorry, no dice,

1449
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:44,203
but we have a very nice
roulette wheel here.

1450
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:46,989
Forget this phony bet. Take the $900,

1451
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,996
go out there and win
some money honestly.

1452
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:52,999
I'll guarantee you,
you'll sleep better tonight.

1453
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,546
Mr. Seymour.

1454
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:57,708
Come up with the money,
or I'm gonna take this place apart.

1455
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,251
Yeah?

1456
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,507
You have exactly 15 seconds.

1457
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,427
- What?
- Take the money, lad.

1458
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:07,592
Let the wench try her luck.

1459
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,811
Let her what?

1460
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:16,106
Suppose she loses.

1461
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:20,188
Sure it'll work?

1462
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,403
Okay, we'll take it.

1463
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,159
What! We most certainly will not take it!

1464
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:27,112
Mr. Seymour has made a very
meritorious suggestion.

1465
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,247
You know, Mr. Walker,
I don't understand you.

1466
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,626
One minute you're a knight
in shining armor,

1467
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:35,037
- and the next minute, you are a...
- Well, we all make mistakes, right?

1468
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,121
Mr. Seymour?

1469
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:38,999
Mr. Walker, it's a smart man
who knows when to crawfish.

1470
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,960
Come along, I'll show you to a nice room

1471
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,011
reserved for our more
valued-type customers.

1472
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,930
But I don't know how to gamble.

1473
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,466
This is a good place to learn.

1474
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:54,014
These are friends of mine,
take good care of them.

1475
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:56,141
Okay, Mr. Seymour.

1476
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:57,559
Good luck, folks.

1477
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,649
$900 worth, please.

1478
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:01,776
Yes, sir.

1479
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,866
Don't worry about a thing.
Just let me handle this.

1480
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:09,072
Ha-ha. I'll take the chips, please.

1481
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,164
Yellows are $1,

1482
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,835
the reds are $5,

1483
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,997
the blues are $25, the whites, $100.

1484
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,540
Don't you have any 50-cent chips?

1485
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:22,126
Not in this room.

1486
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:25,671
It's 28 minutes till midnight.

1487
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:32,724
29 is a good number. Bet 'em all.
We don't have time to fool around.

1488
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:36,147
Are you trying to lose my $900 again?

1489
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,854
No more bets, please.

1490
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,451
The number is 31.

1491
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,488
That's not my numb...

1492
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:55,876
- Oh, how nice.
- Make your bets, please.

1493
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:57,627
Let it ride.

1494
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:02,086
No, no, you can't win that way.
Put it on one number.

1495
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,042
Would you please just
let me do it my way.

1496
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:09,089
No more bets.

1497
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:24,771
Number 32. And we have...

1498
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:31,991
And we have $36 on number 32!

1499
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:35,498
I won! I won!
I told you I had a talent for this.

1500
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,830
Pay me! Pay me!

1501
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,252
Good evening, folks.

1502
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:43,590
- What goes on?
- You tell me.

1503
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:46,756
We're doing just great. Now, let's see.

1504
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:50,260
- Put 'em all on...
- Let me do it!

1505
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,807
Have you ever played
this game before?

1506
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:55,385
Then leave my chips alone
because I have a system.

1507
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,596
What system?

1508
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,681
Woman's intuition.

1509
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,768
Put 'em all on one number.

1510
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:05,775
Don't you understand?
Time's running out.

1511
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:08,030
Spin the wheel, please.

1512
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,614
Watch the board.

1513
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:18,625
Whatever happens,
watch those chips on the board.

1514
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:39,555
Ha-ha!

1515
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:41,856
One more like that, and we're home.

1516
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,441
Yeah!

1517
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,353
Thirty-five times 36 is...

1518
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:53,535
Now, we let it ride.

1519
01:32:56,571 --> 01:33:00,496
- Don't fool with it. Go to the gaff.
- Gotcha.

1520
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,002
Spin the wheel, please.

1521
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:04,796
Yes, ma'am.

1522
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,339
Everything rides on number 20.

1523
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:19,060
Oh, we did it!

1524
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,691
Number 15.

1525
01:33:26,059 --> 01:33:28,107
So very sorry, ma'am.

1526
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:37,950
Ah ha!

1527
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,952
Oh, thee...

1528
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,162
You know what I think?

1529
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:45,128
I think this is a stupid game.

1530
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,213
I don't understand,
something must have gone wrong.

1531
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:50,251
I'll say. We lost almost everything.

1532
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,676
Don't panic.

1533
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,338
We've still got half of the chips.

1534
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,520
Scurvy cheat.

1535
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,193
Put all the chips down.

1536
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:21,786
We put all the chips we've
got left onto one number,

1537
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:26,078
and it comes up, we're still in business.

1538
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,837
Make your bets.

1539
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,622
The only question is...

1540
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,925
What if it doesn't come up?

1541
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:36,595
Don't worry.

1542
01:34:36,963 --> 01:34:40,058
Everything is go, all on 11.

1543
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:42,727
- That's all we have.
- No more bets.

1544
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:45,605
Everything goes on 11.

1545
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:46,810
Relax.

1546
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,024
We did it!

1547
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:59,285
Ahh!

1548
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:04,120
Ooh-whoo-whoo!

1549
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,164
Come on. We got enough.

1550
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:14,380
What? We're on a winning streak!

1551
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,177
Think of those dear old ladies!

1552
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:20,223
We could buy them warm coats,
and cars, and polo ponies.

1553
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,349
We've gotta get out of here.

1554
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:24,098
Pay up, will you?

1555
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,308
We're in a very big hurry.

1556
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,806
Hey, fella.

1557
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:31,734
Yes, sir.

1558
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:35,613
$36,000, $37,000,

1559
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:37,903
- $38,000...
- That's enough.

1560
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:40,618
We thank you, the Daughters of the
Buccaneers thank you and good night.

1561
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:43,201
There's still more.
Maybe we should take it for good luck!

1562
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:51,542
Not yet. I just put down a new carpet.

1563
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,794
I hear you've done very well.

1564
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,671
Not bad.

1565
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,880
May I see?

1566
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:58,669
Please.

1567
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:05,810
My, my. That's very nice indeed.

1568
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:07,854
I'm very happy for you.

1569
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,190
So, you made out alright,
you took Silky's advice, right?

1570
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:14,357
Why don't you take my advice again,

1571
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:16,321
and let me keep this for you.

1572
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:17,526
No, you don't.

1573
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:21,401
This is a lot of bread for
you to be carrying around.

1574
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:24,537
This is a very dangerous neighborhood.

1575
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:27,240
Okay, Professor, give me the bag.

1576
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:35,966
I've been very patient with both of you,
and very civilized.

1577
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,376
Okay, boys.

1578
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:41,383
Go on over there, Jo Anne. Go on.

1579
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,386
Make with the muscle.

1580
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:48,599
All right, boys, make your play.

1581
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,015
Oof!

1582
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,525
P-chung.

1583
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:01,740
Psh!

1584
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,068
Missed me.

1585
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,246
What's the matter with you?
Get up and get him!

1586
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:10,329
And now for Mr. Seymour.

1587
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,628
Steve!

1588
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:16,748
Get his guns!

1589
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,762
Get the gun!

1590
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,467
- Steve!
- Shoot him!

1591
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,269
- Shoot him!
- P-chung!

1592
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:32,980
I shot him.

1593
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,974
Don't point that thing over here!

1594
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:40,568
All ashore what's going ashore!

1595
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:41,777
Come on!

1596
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:49,789
Steve!

1597
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,626
Quite nice, lad.

1598
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,631
There's a boat down here.

1599
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:00,962
Proceed, lad. I'll tidy up a bit.

1600
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:02,043
Have fun.

1601
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,132
- Oof!
- Oof!

1602
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:15,814
Help! Help!

1603
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:23,485
Come on,

1604
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,321
stop fooling around!

1605
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,448
Get him any way you can!

1606
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:36,828
Got any idea who we're fighting?

1607
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:39,797
It ain't "who" I'm worried
about, it's "what."

1608
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,382
Are we winning, Mr. Seymour?

1609
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:52,010
- Who's that?
- It's me, stupid.

1610
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:56,098
- It's around here someplace.
- If you think that thing scares me...

1611
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:03,438
Stop 'em!

1612
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,724
Can't you give us just a little more time?

1613
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:33,100
I'm sorry, ladies,

1614
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:35,053
but I'm always precise in these matters.

1615
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,563
According to the terms of this document,

1616
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:40,892
unless you produce
the payment at midnight,

1617
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:44,779
which is just 11 seconds from now.

1618
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:47,406
Eight.

1619
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,909
Seven. Six.

1620
01:39:57,575 --> 01:39:59,077
Thank you, Mr. Ainsworth.

1621
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,458
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

1622
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,300
Mr. Walker,

1623
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:10,550
this is the moment that most
of us have been waiting for

1624
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:12,431
all our lives.

1625
01:40:12,924 --> 01:40:15,723
Will you burn the mortgage?

1626
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:19,184
Thank you very much,
but that honor's not for me.

1627
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:27,280
Here comes the fella you should thank.

1628
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,800
Hello, buddy, I'm glad to see you.

1629
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:59,512
Ladies, all of you repeat after me.

1630
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:01,685
You, too.

1631
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:04,392
Uh... Kree kruh.

1632
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,694
Kree kruh.

1633
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:10,899
- Vergo gebba.
- Vergo gebba.

1634
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:14,653
- Kalto kree.
- Kalto kree.

1635
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,623
Allow me to present
your real benefactor.

1636
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:30,506
Captain Blackbeard!

1637
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:35,340
My respects, ma'am.

1638
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:42,855
Good ladies, your welcome
has touched me deeply.

1639
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,937
Loathe as I am to play the gallant,

1640
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,530
I am bound to say

1641
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:55,702
that I've never beheld
a concourse of fair creatures

1642
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:59,080
which has stirred me more.

1643
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,619
Oh, yes.

1644
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,451
Thank ye for your esteem.

1645
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:07,755
You cannot know what it has been
like for a person of my disposition

1646
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:12,131
to have been still of tongue,
to have no one to talk to

1647
01:42:12,585 --> 01:42:17,091
for two hundred accursed
and dusty years.

1648
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:23,642
Yet now, my voice is heard once again.

1649
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:25,853
I do thank you.

1650
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:31,354
Yet stay, it is not my wish,

1651
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:34,281
as a person

1652
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:36,985
as generous as my good self,

1653
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:41,831
to seek to take the
lion's share of the glory.

1654
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:44,079
Oh, no.

1655
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,915
This young

1656
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:49,088
rooster,

1657
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,757
my good friend,

1658
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:53,509
he played a modest part

1659
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:57,262
in your delivery from disaster.

1660
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:02,932
- Well, I...
- Not now, son.

1661
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:06,348
Our heart is too full to hear more.

1662
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:12,069
Now, if I might have that vile document.

1663
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:24,619
Aldetha,

1664
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:28,707
the time is here.

1665
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,334
I go now.

1666
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:33,211
To a distant,

1667
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:37,216
and I hope, hospitable shore.

1668
01:43:39,088 --> 01:43:40,715
I beg of you,

1669
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:44,351
take notice of this.

1670
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:48,185
I, Edward Teach,

1671
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:49,891
Captain,

1672
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,476
affectionately known

1673
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,984
as Blackbeard,

1674
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,819
was not all bad.

1675
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:15,000
Look after this boy. He needs help.

1676
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:22,840
- Fare thee well, lad.
- Goodbye, captain.

1677
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,013
We will not meet again.

1678
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:27,144
Oh, uh,

1679
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:32,108
beware all wenches.

1680
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:36,020
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1681
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,484
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1682
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:42,027
<i>He's a jolly good fellow</i>

1683
01:44:42,485 --> 01:44:44,704
<i>And so say all of us</i>

1684
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:49,125
Share this one amongst you,
me beauties.

1685
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:02,801
You know, I think I'm gonna
miss the old scoundrel.

1686
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,883
You know something?

1687
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:09,395
I loved you even when
I thought you were nuts.

1688
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,230
Look!

1689
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,289
Captain, proud
to see you again, sir.

1690
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:33,995
Where have you been?

1691
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:35,796
You're a sight for
sore eyes, you are.

1692
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:42,591
Now, you lazy swabs,
stir yourselves!

1693
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:45,927
Lift anchor. Shake out the main.

1694
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:50,433
Lively now or I'll carve your gizzard

1695
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:53,810
and fry it for me supper!

1696
01:45:54,139 --> 01:45:55,732
Ha-ha-ha!

1697
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:11,448
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
