1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,563
Ladies and gentlemen,
in the center ring,

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,401
Mr. Blake is now judging
best in show.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,763
Mesdames et messieurs, aucentre,

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,885
Monsieur Blake judge

5
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,562
- Fine dog, Monsieur.
- Yes. Buy him.

6
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,006
- How high can I go?
- Up to five.

7
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,885
- $500. I don't think...
- $5,000.

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,930
Oui, Monsieur.

9
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,449
Shh.

10
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,287
Attends, attends.
Ne bouge pas.

11
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,324
Ne bouge pas.
Je veuxte prendre.

12
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,764
Ne bouge pas.

13
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,161
Attends.

14
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,762
Ce n'est pas grave.

15
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,807
Reviens!

16
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,087
Hey, arrete!
Hey, reviens!

17
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,803
Hey. Hey!

18
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,801
Red?
How did he get out?

19
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,483
- Get him.
- Monsieur.

20
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,926
Matt! Patsy!
Come back here!

21
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,923
Le chien! Le chien!

22
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,724
- Ou est le chien, Monsieur?
- What?

23
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,411
Le chien rouge qui courait,
s'il vous plait.

24
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,488
Come on, mechant chien.

25
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,682
Pourquoi tu t'es sauve?

26
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,447
On t'attend dans ta cage.

27
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
Son.

28
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,645
Just where do you think
you're going with that dog?

29
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,808
Le chien s'est sauve
de la cage. Je l'emmene.

30
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,082
- Just a minute, laddie.
- S'il vous plait, Monsieur.

31
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,487
Emile, this boy
doesn't speak English.

32
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,489
Find out what he's doing
with Red.

33
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,204
Oh, I speak English, Monsieur.

34
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,527
- But... But...
- But?

35
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,324
Quand ca va vite,
je cherche mes mots.

36
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,524
He says he does speak English,

37
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,167
but when events move rapidly,
he cannot find the right words.

38
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,965
Events are moving
much too rapidly.

39
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,811
You weren't trying
to steal this dog, were you?

40
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,810
- Quoi?
- Steal. Voler.

41
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,164
Oh, no, Monsieur.
I was looking for le boss to ask for work.

42
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,170
Ahem. C'est...

43
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,408
C'est Monsieur qui est le boss.

44
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,365
Oh.

45
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,969
Monsieur, I am
Rene Jean-Paul Dumond.

46
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,321
I am a strong worker.
I do not get tired.

47
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,171
I have lived with my uncle
who trap the fox.

48
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,045
But now my uncle is dead,
so I must work.

49
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,049
I am learning to speak English
from a book.

50
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,851
And I like animals very much!

51
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,441
I see. And that's why you let the dog
out of his run?

52
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,688
I did not
let him out, Monsieur.

53
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,323
J'ai ouvert la cage parce que le chien
avait la patte prise dans la broche.

54
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,408
- La patte? Excuse me.
- Oui, .

55
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,931
What did he say?

56
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,088
Red's pawwas caught
in the cage wire.

57
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,326
Which one?

58
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,771
- Laquelle?
- La patte gauche.

59
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,121
The left one, Monsieur. Stay.

60
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,967
- It is nothing, Monsieur.
- Good.

61
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,650
So, you want
a job? Work.

62
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,448
Oui, Monsieur.
I am a strong worker. I do not get tired.

63
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,767
- I have lived with...
- My uncle who trap the fox.

64
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,928
And you're learning English
from a book.

65
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,045
Oui, Monsieur.

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,209
Okay, son.
You've got a job.

67
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,729
- Merci, Monsieur le boss.
- Show him what to do, Emile.

68
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,730
- Monsieur.
- Come on, Red. Come on, boy.

69
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,524
Well, first thing
you must do...

70
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,811
..is put on your belt
so your trousers do not descend.

71
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,164
Oui, Monsieur.

72
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,842
"Sleep, slept, slept."

73
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,043
"I sleep, I slept,

74
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,891
I have slept."

75
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,849
This is the new bed
where I sleep.

76
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,690
This is the window
in the new room

77
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,564
where I sleep.

78
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,087
This is a chair.
This is a desk.

79
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,202
This is a floor.

80
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,888
This is a table.

81
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,887
Good morning, Mr Jones.

82
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,401
Good afternoon, Mrs Brown.

83
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,881
Good evening, Mr Smith.

84
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,683
"Did you walk
to the railroad station?"

85
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,088
"Did he walk
to the railroad station?"

86
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,563
"Did we walk
to the railroad station?"

87
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,082
"Did you walk
to the railroad station?"

88
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,767
Merci.

89
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,169
"I am, you are, he is,
we are, you are, they are."

90
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,920
I am, you are, they are...
sleepy.

91
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,681
- N'est-ce pas?
- Good evening, Mr Emile.

92
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,131
- Therese has fed you?
- Oui, Monsieur.

93
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,687
Your wife... Madame...
is a very fine cook.

94
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,771
Good.
Are you comfortable?

95
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,609
- Oh, oui, Monsieur.
- Good.

96
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,451
Because tomorrow,
you start working.

97
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,085
Come here.

98
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,771
All these here
will be in your care.

99
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,885
To keep clean, to feed,
to tend when they are sick.

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,490
Oui, Monsieur.

101
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,762
But especially this one.

102
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,200
Do you know how much
this dog is worth?

103
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,731
Worth?

104
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,403
Combine vaut le chien?

105
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,769
- Oh, how much is cost.
- Oui, ,.

106
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,603
That "how much" is $5,000.

107
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,881
Vous voulez rire?

108
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,367
I do not make a joke.

109
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,007
$5,000?
One dog?

110
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,923
Come here.

111
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,206
- Do you know what a dog show is?
- Non, Monsieur.

112
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,005
Well, no matter.
I'll show you pictures in the morning.

113
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,281
Anyway, there is such a show
in New York City next month.

114
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,361
Now, if he wins this show,
he'll be the best dog in North America.

115
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,529
Perhaps in the whole world.

116
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,770
And that is what Monsieur Haggin
wants more than any one thing.

117
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,766
- Tu comprends?
- Oui, Monsieur.

118
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,170
Be sure that you do,
because this is very important.

119
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,882
Well, you go to bed now.
Our day begins at 6:00.

120
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,124
Bonsoir, Monsieur.

121
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,970
Dors bien.

122
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,082
Good night, Mr. Jones.
Good night, Mrs. Brown.

123
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,408
$5,000.

124
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,525
It is an honor to sleep
in the same room with such a dog.

125
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,689
Good night, Mr Smith.

126
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,608
Gently.
Voila.

127
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,484
- Emile!
- Oui, Monsieur?

128
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,610
- Bring out Red, will you, please?
- Coming, Monsieur.

129
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,964
Monsieur wishes Big Red.
Outside.

130
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,368
Here you are.
Go! Go outside.

131
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,650
- Quickly! Outside.
- Oui, Monsieur.

132
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,888
No, no!
Not that way!

133
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
I am sorry, Monsieur.
The boy did not know.

134
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,165
It's all right.

135
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,806
Well, let's get to work?

136
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,971
Come on.

137
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,362
Thanks, Emile.
Now be tough on him.

138
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,926
That Westminster show
isn't so far off.

139
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,249
Yes, Monsieur, I will be
all the tough judges rolled into one.

140
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,725
Red, stay.

141
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,363
Ready, Monsieur?
Begin, Monsieur.

142
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,244
Red, heel.

143
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,807
Monsieur.

144
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,925
The head.

145
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,210
Head up.

146
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,565
Heel.

147
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,845
Head up.

148
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,201
Non! Parlez-lui avec douceur
et il va faire...

149
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,482
tout ce que vous voudrez.

150
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,161
What?
What did he say?

151
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,250
Nothing, Monsieur. The boy does not
understand these things.

152
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,443
- Go back inside and work.
- Just a minute, son.

153
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,324
Come here.

154
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,248
- Pas de baisers.
- Think you can handle the dog better?

155
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,364
- Non, non, Monsieur.
- Then what did you say?

156
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,527
I said, Monsieur, perhaps if...

157
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,291
if Monsieur would speak
to the dog...

158
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,001
avec douceur.

159
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,482
With gentleness, Monsieur.

160
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,720
With gentleness, Monsieur.
That is all I said.

161
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,128
I see.
Love conquers all?

162
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,843
Look, son, a dog is an animal.

163
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,440
He's governed by
conditioned reflexes.

164
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,131
Dogs are not people.
They don't have human reactions,

165
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,404
and the only way to handle them
is with a firm voice and a tight lead.

166
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,529
We'll try again tomorrow.

167
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,085
Thank you.

168
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,367
One does not
speak out to Monsieur?

169
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,689
Unless one wishes
to join the ranks of the unemployed.

170
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,564
Well. Here.

171
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,124
Take him for a run
in the fields.

172
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,285
but do not, under
any circumstances, let him off the lead.

173
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,402
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Go.

174
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,761
- Oh, Rene.
- Oui, Monsieur?

175
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,883
The next time Monsieur calls,

176
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,169
the front door, if you please.

177
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,206
Oui, Monsieur.

178
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,042
Whoa! Hey!
Pas trop vite, pas trop vite.

179
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,009
$5,000

180
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,363
and yet you cannot even walk
as Monsieur Le Boss wishes.

181
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,961
Bien sur. It should not be
difficult for a dog like you

182
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,526
a dog of such worth.

183
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,003
Come. We will try.

184
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,161
Come.

185
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,611
Droit. Heel.

186
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,411
Come here.

187
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,766
You want to be
a hunting dog?

188
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,363
To be useful and work
with Monsieur Le Boss, no?

189
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,170
In that case,
there is much to learn.

190
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,647
One does not become
a hunting dog overnight.

191
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,326
No, Red!

192
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,970
Red!

193
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,366
Come back.

194
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,567
Come on.
Now... stay!

195
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,727
The rabbit, no.

196
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,241
The pheasant, yes.

197
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,525
Tu comprends?

198
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,611
There. Thank you
for the feathers, Therese.

199
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,010
Taste.

200
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,328
It is... It is,
magnificent, Therese.

201
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,168
I agree. Sit.

202
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,442
- You will have a bowl of soup.
- No, thank you.

203
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,483
How can one put flesh
on your bones

204
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,365
when all the time you are running,
running with that big red dog?

205
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,687
- It is the red dog, no?
- Oui, ,.

206
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,724
And this, I suppose,
has to do with him somehow?

207
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,571
Oui, ,. This is called
the lure.

208
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,491
I will not ask
what that means. I'm too busy.

209
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,251
It is for hunting,
you see? To teach him.

210
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,442
And he is waiting
for me to begin.

211
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,450
It will take only five minutes
to eat a bowl of soup.

212
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,007
There is nothing
I would like better, Therese, but...

213
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,363
Oh, go.

214
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,403
As La Rochefoucauld has said,

215
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,242
when a man has something on his mind,
he wants nothing in his stomach.

216
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,489
It is very fine soup, Therese.

217
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,126
Go and run
with the big red dog.

218
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,607
I will save the soup
'til you come back.

219
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,409
All right, all right.
Enough running for today.

220
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,651
Sit.

221
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,406
Now, I have something
to show you.

222
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,562
This is a bird.

223
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,842
All right, this is not a bird.

224
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,247
But for you, it is a bird.

225
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,486
Now, the bird will always
be hidden in a bush.

226
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,605
Comme ca.

227
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,166
But you will not know in which bush.

228
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,806
So, you smell the air.

229
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,126
Voila.

230
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,924
You have it.

231
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,726
Now, you advance slowly.

232
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,765
And point. So.

233
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,971
Compris?

234
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,367
I give up with you.

235
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,651
You will never be
a hunting dog.

236
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,163
Go. Go walk around in dog shows
for the rest of your life.

237
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,961
But don't come to me for help.

238
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,482
All right.
I accept your apology.

239
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,960
We will try again tomorrow.
Now, we go home.

Yes. But now,

It is the spoons
that is the music.

258
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,846
You hear that, boy?
My husband of many talents speaks.

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,644
Well, without the spoons,

Woman!

266
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,725
Oh, no, no. Please, go right ahead, Rene.
It sounded fine.

267
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,923
- It was nothing, Monsieur.
- We were disturbing Monsieur.

268
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,566
No, of course not.
I was just taking a little walk.

269
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,251
- Red isn't in his kennel.
- He is here, Monsieur.

270
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,806
Oh.
Oh, yes, yes.

271
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,321
- Well, you see...
- It was my idea. I suggested...

272
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,602
No, no, no, wait.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

273
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,405
It's perfectly all right.
I was just wondering where he was.

274
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,811
It is my fault to bring the dog, Monsieur.
He was... s'ennuyait.

275
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,287
He was lonely, Monsieur.

276
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,210
- Yes.
- Oui, ,. He was lonely.

277
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,680
I asked to bring him up here, Monsieur.
I will take him back.

278
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,965
Come on, Red.

279
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,641
Come on, Red. Therese,
perhaps Monsieur would like a cup of...

280
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,081
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

281
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,010
- No, don't bother, Therese.
- Oh, no bother, Monsieur.

282
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,361
I was just thinking of
having one for myself.

283
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,609
Well, thank you very much.
You're very kind.

284
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,005
So, 
the dog was lonely?

285
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,846
Oui, Monsieur.

286
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
I think the music
was good for Big Red.

287
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,646
- Oh. Improved his coat?
- Perhaps.

288
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,922
Has not Montaigne said,

289
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,364
the happiness inside
cannot help but show on the outside?

290
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,721
I guarantee Montaigne
never said anything as foolish as that.

291
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,411
It is never foolish,
Monsieur, to speak of happiness.

292
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,081
I think it is a good thing
that the boy and the dog have each other.

293
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,570
One should never be alone,

294
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,682
even when one has...

295
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,041
great wealth, big house...

296
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,686
- Now, Therese...
- I was just about to say, Monsieur,

297
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,724
that one must forget
that which has passed.

298
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,765
- One must go forward.
- You know, this is awfully good coffee.

299
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,089
Oui, Monsieur.
What good are all the riches of the world?

300
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,851
- Therese.
- Oui, Monsieur?

301
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,883
You know something?

302
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,881
I should have gotten rid of you
five years ago, before you learned to cook.

303
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,930
Slow down. Red! Slow down!

304
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,127
Red, wait!
I have lost my boot.

305
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,531
Red!

306
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,490
Red! Come back here. Red!

307
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,845
Red!

308
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,010
Red!

309
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,324
Red!

310
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,530
Red!

311
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,726
Red, qu'est-ce que c'est?

312
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,446
Red!

313
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,165
Red!

314
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,404
Red, you...

315
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,763
It was my fault, Monsieur.
I am sorry.

316
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,682
If Monsieur wishes,
I will quit le job.

317
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,885
I will not ask the full week of pay.
This would not be fair.

318
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,321
Never quit le job, son.

319
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,762
Just tell 'em you're unhappy
and ask for twice the money.

320
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,611
- You take the front. I'll take the rear.
- Oui, Monsieur.

321
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,367
- This is no good for his coat?
- That's right.

322
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,969
- It will spoil the showing?
- The show?

323
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,606
No, no, he'll be
all right by showtime.

324
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,930
But, from now on,
let's be careful?

325
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,362
You see, son, he's not like
our other dogs.

326
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,921
This dog
is what is called a bench dog.

327
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,284
Well, that means that,

328
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,166
that his kind aren't used for
any practical purposes any more.

329
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,448
Yeah. Well, now,
once, his kind were great hunters.

330
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,088
But they’re so good to look at
that the hunting points were bred out.

331
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,091
I guess you might say that they've
lost their most important point:

332
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,248
the sense of responsibility.

333
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,523
And yet Red is still
of such great value?

334
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,210
$5,000?

335
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,490
Yeah. And if he wins
best in show next month,

336
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,762
he'll be worth $10,000.

337
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,131
Got something here
I want you to see.

338
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,890
Look at that.

339
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,170
How do you like her?

340
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,171
- She is beautiful, Monsieur.
- She's for him.

341
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,763
To start the Wintapi Kennels
when he wins best in show at Westminster.

342
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,244
Not too bad?

343
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,642
Where is this cabin
of your uncle where you used to live?

344
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,809
North. Twenty,
twenty-five miles.

345
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,241
- Oh, up in the big pines.
- Yes.

346
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,001
I used to hunt up there.
That's pretty rough country.

347
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,527
Where did you go to school?

348
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,208
You never went to school?
But you can read and write.

349
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,808
Oui, Monsieur.
My uncle taught me.

350
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,321
Also, we had several books.

351
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,887
There was geography,
the arithmetic...

352
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,924
Well, that's all very fine,
but it's not school.

353
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,725
You know that school
is very important, don't you?

354
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,764
Oui, Monsieur.
School is most important.

355
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,487
But for me now,
it is necessary to work...

356
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,602
and make my way in the world.

357
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,451
Well, you won't get very far
without an education.

358
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,450
- If you want to be a success...
- A success?

359
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,371
Yes... Well...

360
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,326
- You know, make a lot of money.
- Oh, money.

361
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,688
That's what you want, isn't it?

362
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,725
Oui, Monsieur,
but most of all,

363
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,002
I want to be useful.

364
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,726
That, I think,
is the first thing.

365
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,125
Yeah.

366
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,124
Yeah, I guess
that is the first thing.

367
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,530
'Morning, Spence.

368
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,211
- Mr Haggin.
- It's good of you to come up.

369
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,766
Emile, you know Mr Blake,
Montreal Kennel Club.

370
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,245
My handler, Emile Fornet.

371
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,486
- Emile.
- Monsieur.

372
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,204
Emile, bring out Red, will you?

373
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,448
- We're going to get an expert opinion.
- Monsieur.

374
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,487
Spence, I've got
a real problem.

375
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,331
You know I plan to show Red
at the Westminster next month.

376
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,723
Well, I don't know, but, 
he seems uncontrollable.

377
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,207
Just doesn’t want
to perform any more.

378
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,482
That's funny,
an old trooper like Red.

379
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,171
Yeah. Well, you'll
see for yourself.

380
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,410
Thank you, Emile.

381
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,210
Red, heel.

382
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,010
Head up.

383
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,844
Red, heel.

384
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,648
Come here, Red.

385
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,201
- The boy takes care of him, doesn't he?
- Yes.

386
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,845
- You know what I think?
- I'm beginning to think the same thing.

387
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,290
Rene.

388
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,921
- Oui, Monsieur?
- Walk him.

389
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,170
Oui, Monsieur.

390
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,204
Faster, Rene.

391
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,885
That's it, all right.

392
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,970
Yeah, I should have known.
All right, Rene.

393
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,766
Emile.

394
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,727
Red is coming up to
the main house to stay with me

395
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,683
'til we leave for the dog show.

396
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,845
I don't want Rene to see him
for any reason whatsoever. Understand?

397
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,610
Oui, Monsieur.

398
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,088
- Do you understand?
- Oui, Monsieur.

399
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,285
- You'll stay for lunch, Spence?
- Thank you.

400
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,802
It happens that way sometimes.
They get attached to one person.

401
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,482
Well, we'll have
our lunch too?

402
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,280
Therese's good onion soup.
Come on.

403
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,086
Rene.

404
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,328
Pourquoi, Emile?

405
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,168
Why does Red go to the house?

406
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,568
Because Monsieur wishes.
Come on.

407
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,167
But... pourquoi?

408
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,084
A quoi bon?

409
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,041
Because that big, foolish dog
likes you too much.

410
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,969
He does not obey Monsieur.

411
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,401
And if he does not obey Monsieur,
he cannot win the show.

412
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,205
And if he does not win the show,
Monsieur will sell him.

413
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,084
That is pourquoi.

414
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,927
Sell him?
Oh, no!

415
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,083
Oh, no?
Oh, yes.

416
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,089
Just...
like that.

417
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,600
Well, come on.
Therese has blueberries too. Come on.

418
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,967
Fini, Monsieur?

419
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,084
Oh, yes. Yes, thank you, Therese.
It was delicious.

420
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,690
Rene!

421
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,089
There you are, Mademoiselle.

422
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,847
You are now in your own home.

423
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,850
Chez vous.

424
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,646
If you wish for service,
you have only to ring.

425
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,967
Rene!

426
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,731
- Here.
- Regarde.

427
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,801
Mademoiselle...
soon to be Madame, we hope...

428
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,844
Mollie O'Day, permettez-moi
de vous presenter

429
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,362
Monsieur Rene Jean-Paul Dumond.

430
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,571
Monsieur Dumond,
Mademoiselle Mollie O'Day.

431
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,004
She's quite a dog?

432
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,801
Oui, ,.

433
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,048
With this one for Big Red,

434
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,528
the Wintapi Kennel will be
the best in the world?

435
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,971
Oui, ,.

436
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,328
Qu'est-ce que tu as?

437
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,164
What is the good
of all this talk of kennel?

438
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,285
You said yourself if Big Red loses
the showing, Monsieur will sell him.

439
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,848
Then where's the kennel?

440
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,726
Yes. But Monsieur Haggin
is not a man who loses, Rene.

441
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,206
They are not judging
Monsieur Haggin.

442
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,603
Big Red will win.
I have confidence.

443
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,363
Emile?

444
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,084
It is tomorrow they go
to New York, no?

445
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,165
Oui, ,.

446
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,363
Would it be permitted
to see him tonight?

447
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,528
Just to say goodbye?

448
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,205
No.

449
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,649
For two minutes, perhaps?

450
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,923
For no minutes.
Red is now content,

451
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,042
and he will remain so.

452
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,642
Mademoiselle,
when you have rested,

453
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,446
there will be something to eat.

454
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,770
Hello, Big Red.
Comment ca va?

455
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,287
No, I cannot come in, Red.

456
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,568
It is not permitted.

457
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,446
Red, you will be
good in the show

458
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,849
for Monsieur
and... pour moi?

459
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,764
S'il vous plait, Red.

460
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,171
S'il vous plait.

461
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,930
Au revoir.

462
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,051
Red!

463
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,324
What is it?

464
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,206
It's Red.
Red, come here. Red!

465
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,847
Red!

466
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,168
- Put him to sleep.
- No! No, Monsieur!

467
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,527
Rene, I don’t want
to hear any more.

468
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,730
Do not kill him, Monsieur.
It was all simply...

469
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,481
Emile.
Je vais prendre soin.

470
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,922
You knew this dog's value, and you
were told not to come to the house.

471
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,089
Oui, Monsieur. It is my fault.
I have already said so.

472
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,886
But please, let me
take care of him, Monsieur.

473
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,170
Go ahead, Emile.

474
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,082
No, you cannot do this!

475
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,129
- You don’t want him to suffer, do you?
- Non, Monsieur.

476
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,208
Neither do I.

477
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,083
I think it is better
if you go to the kitchen?

478
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,802
Was it so bad, a boy who wanted
to say goodbye to a dog?

479
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,771
Oh, but I have forgotten.

480
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,441
He disobeyed Monsieur.
And this is terrible.

481
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,007
In all of history, no boy
has ever disobeyed a man.

482
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,323
Even one he respect and admire.

483
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,489
He didn't respect and admire
anybody except the dog.

484
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Oh, but, Monsieur...

485
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,048
- I don't want to talk about it, Therese.
- Very well, Monsieur.

486
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,448
I know Monsieur does not like
to show what he feel.

487
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,843
For as Descartes has said, to
wear the heart on the sleeve...

488
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,248
Therese, it's over and
done with. Understand?

489
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,005
Oui, Monsieur.

490
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,770
Have Emile varnish over those claw marks.
I'd like it done this morning.

491
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,529
Good morning.

492
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,330
Comment ca va?

493
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,729
Not too good?

494
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,128
Well, breakfast will
make you feel better.

495
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,440
This is the cabin of my uncle.

496
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,086
You will stay here
'til you get well.

497
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,806
We have everything here.
Everything we need.

498
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,044
Even this.

499
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,690
Well, the appetite
has returned?

500
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,087
Now, we will try something.

501
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,970
C'est ca.

502
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,009
C'est ca.

503
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,725
Good.

504
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,123
Do not feel badly.

505
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,766
Your muscles
are stiff and sore.

506
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,408
We will fix that.

507
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,890
That's it.

508
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,371
Come on, Red.
Come.

509
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,364
One more step.

510
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,484
It is all right.
It is all right!

511
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,202
In no time, you will be
running like the wind!

512
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,448
Come on.
Come on, Red.

513
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,564
That's a boy.
Come on. Give me that stick.

514
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,124
Hey, stop that!

515
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,168
Hello, Molly, old girl.

516
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,964
Who let you out?

517
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,005
They think you needed
a little exercise?

518
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,929
Okay, when I finish here,

519
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,202
we'll take a little turn
around the fie...

520
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,043
Wait a minute.
You're not Molly.

521
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,808
Red, for the love of Mike,
where did you come from?

522
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,002
He was staying with me,
Monsieur.

523
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,801
At the cabin of my uncle.

524
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,803
Well, Rene,
I'm glad to see you back.

525
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,971
You did a fine job
with this dog.

526
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,321
He was practically dead.
What did you do?

527
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,449
I took care of him, Monsieur.

528
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,528
Now, I return him to you.

529
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,602
Well, I guess I can't thank you
with a lot of idle talk.

530
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,485
Tell you what.
You take him down to the kennel.

531
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,410
Tell Emile you're back,
and I'll tell Therese you're hungry.

532
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,807
No, thank you, Monsieur.
I am not hungry.

533
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,930
Then we'll both go down.

534
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,566
Let Emile see this.
He'll never believe it.

535
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,970
You're as good as new, old boy.
He'll take that New York show next year.

536
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,601
No, Monsieur.

537
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,765
Well, he's still valuable
for stud.

538
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,121
Guess we can't have
everything, can we?

539
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,531
Rene.

540
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,770
Never quit le job.

541
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,129
Sometime it is necessary,
Monsieur.

542
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,170
Not necessary at all.

543
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,523
- Emile needs help, and you want work.
- Monsieur.

544
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,809
I think it would be better
if I find other work.

545
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,044
Well, I can't force you
to work here.

546
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,648
However, I feel
I owe you something.

547
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,808
You owe me nothing, Monsieur.

548
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,724
Okay.

549
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,004
Okay.

550
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,285
Go back, Red. You must stay
with Monsieur. Go back.

551
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,688
Go back!

552
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,765
Come on, Red.

553
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,888
Yes, that's right, Jim.
I'm shipping both dogs this morning.

554
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,764
Just sell them for me.

555
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,040
Oh, Jim, Molly's having
Red's pups in a couple of weeks.

556
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,367
So keep one if you like
and sell the rest.

557
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,441
No, no.
I don't think so.

558
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,764
Yeah. All right. See what you can do
and call me. Thank you.

559
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,363
No comments, Therese.

560
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,926
What is to comment?
Monsieur sells the dogs.

561
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,010
- Thank you.
- A dog, a goat, a cat.

562
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,202
What is the difference?

563
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,290
- After all, a dog is only an animal.
- Therese.

564
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,768
And if the dogs remind one
of a certain person,

565
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,564
that is unfortunate.

566
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,331
The dog is a closed subject.

567
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,689
Oui, Monsieur.

568
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,922
There are many closed subjects
in this house. I know that.

569
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,802
I'm coming. I'm coming.

570
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,649
There.

571
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,762
That is better, no?

572
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,931
Oh, my.

573
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,964
What good is the water here
if you are there?

574
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,964
I'll fix it.

575
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,563
What kind of a lock is this?

576
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,127
Is made to close,
but not to open. Oh, I'll get it.

577
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,481
Ha, it's coming.

578
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,769
Qu'est-ce qui arrive?

579
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,564
Wait for me. I'll be back.

580
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,284
Oh, no, not again.

581
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,850
Monsieur Le Moose,
Madame La Moose. Allez.

582
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,849
No, this is not the same one.

583
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,928
Try the whistle
once more, Victor.

584
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,044
She is the same one,
and I have made my last whistle.

585
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,889
It is up to you.
Vas-y.

586
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,249
This is a thing without dignity.
You should not ask me to do it.

587
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,045
She's holding up
the entire schedule of the railroad.

588
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,607
- What if our passengers should see?
- Edouard.

589
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,611
Should one be ashamed
of a most remarkable talent?

590
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,645
When a moose is a moose,
that is one thing.

591
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,127
But when a man is a moose...

592
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,361
..voila.

593
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,689
Especially a man of your age.

594
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,570
- Louis, please.
- Edouard, the railroad waits.

595
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,603
En avant. Marche.

596
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,687
All right. I will do it.

597
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,528
Ha-ha!

598
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,245
I should have known
I'd find you here.

599
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,770
So, the grass
is more green in this place?

600
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,451
Alors. We go home now, Madame.

601
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,890
Regardez!

602
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,085
Madame, you are trespassing on
the private property of Monsieur Le Boss.

603
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,929
This is not permitted.

604
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,044
That's all right, Rene.

605
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,561
- Good morning, Monsieur.
- Good morning.

606
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,449
- Your cow, Rene?
- No, Monsieur.

607
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,325
She belongs to the farm
of Monsieur Mereau,

608
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,930
where I am working.

609
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,170
- I will bring her home.
- Oh, Rene, how's it been going?

610
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,123
It goes well enough, Monsieur.

611
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,163
Shh. Come.
Come.

612
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,965
- Go on, get! Come on.
- Thank you.

613
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,725
- Monsieur?
- Yes.

614
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,686
How is he, Monsieur?
Is he well, Big Red?

615
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,131
Red, ran away, Rene.

616
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,686
Over a week ago.
With Molly.

617
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,520
They were being shipped
to Montreal for sale

618
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,563
and got out of the baggage car.

619
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,887
Up in the Laurentians,
near Mount Tule de Leau.

620
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,123
Who went to look
for them, Monsieur?

621
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,083
I notified the forest rangers,

622
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,931
but I don't think
there's much of a chance...

623
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,849
Someone must look for them.

624
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,962
Rene, two kennel-bred dogs
wouldn't last a week in that wild country.

625
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,764
Red is different, Monsieur.

626
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,010
Believe me,
I'm as sorry as you are.

627
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,048
I can understand, Monsieur.

628
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,045
It is too bad
to lose all that money.

629
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,688
Impossible.

630
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:26,167
One could lose a thousand elephants
in those woods and not find them again.

631
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,969
Two thousand elephants.

632
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,323
My uncle has taught me

633
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,091
how to follow the tracks
of the fox and the wolf.

634
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,124
- A dog is no difference.
- Impossible.

635
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,881
- It has rained since.
- There will still be signs.

636
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,765
Sometimes a piece of fur
on a twig.

637
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,441
Or the grass will lie down on the field
where they have gone through.

638
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,683
Impossible!

639
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,400
Of course, when I was your age,

640
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,922
I never heard
of that word either.

641
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,884
We arrive at the place.

642
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,531
Bonne chance.

643
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,847
I hope you find the red dog
and his lady.

644
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,086
Merci, Monsieur.

645
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,043
But do not be too hopeful.

646
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,810
[harmonica grows louder

647
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,531
Red!

648
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,288
Red, I thought you were a wolf!

649
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,368
You old wolf-o!

650
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,450
I go to find you,
and it is you who finds me!

651
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,806
Sit.

652
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,241
Now, let me take a look at you.

653
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,725
Ce n'est pas bien.

654
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,649
You are nothing but bones!

655
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,967
But I have something for you.

656
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,204
Here, eat.

657
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,449
Well, eat. It is for you.

658
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,006
Smoked meat from the farm
of Monsieur Mereau.

659
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,807
Red, come! Red!

660
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,886
Red!

661
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,720
Red.

662
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,685
So, this is
a better place to eat?

663
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,480
Molly! So that is why
you took the meat.

664
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,126
For her.

665
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,968
Qu'est-ce qu'on a ici?

666
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:14,124
Madame.
Ca c'esttres bien.

667
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,521
Monsieur Papa, congratulations.
Your first-born!

668
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,565
But I do not think
it will be the last.

669
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,802
Stand back, Red.
A father is only in the way.

670
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,563
Good morning, Madame.

671
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,288
So you are awake?

672
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,161
The family is well, I hope.

673
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,327
I went for this.
Now we have everything we need.

674
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,610
Bonjour, P'tit Rouge.
Comment ca va?

675
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,769
But breakfast is over here.

676
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,682
With your permission, Madame,

677
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,691
I have named this one,
P'tit Rouge.

678
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,762
Little Red.

679
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,804
Bon appetit.

680
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,926
And when you are
big enough to travel,

681
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,042
we will all go home.

682
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,402
But that will be a while.

683
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,091
You and I will hunt,
Big Red,

684
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,124
and bring them
good things to eat.

685
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,002
He is tired, that one.

686
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,691
You would think
he had the family.

687
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,806
My mother used to say
about my father,

688
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,051
I can only remember her
a little,

689
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,164
but she used to say always

690
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,410
that the man rests after
the woman has done the work.

691
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,768
Good morning, Madame.

692
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,487
How are you? I wish you'd eat
your breakfast elsewhere.

693
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,045
Come on here.
Come on.

694
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,048
Over here, Monsieur Mereau.

695
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,645
You found her, that daughter of
a thousand devils.

696
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,451
So, that's how she got in.

697
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,682
This is not
a very strong gate, Mr. Haggin.

698
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,131
I'm terribly sorry,
Monsieur Mereau.

699
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,082
You were lucky to catch her.

700
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,686
She was eating my bush.

701
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,643
- Your bush?
- Yeah.

702
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,165
I don't like the look
of that bush.

703
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,284
Tu peuxt' empoisonner.

704
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,362
Might poison her.

705
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,051
To say nothing
of spoiling her milk.

706
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,242
I'd say that she's
in better shape than my bush.

707
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,241
Well, if she is poisoned,
it's possible I'll have to take steps.

708
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,087
In our province,
both the rich and the poor

709
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,929
are equal before the law.

710
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,840
Well, I'm very glad
to hear that, Monsieur Mereau.

711
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,328
- Monsieur Mereau?
- Yeah.

712
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,762
I thought the young boy Rene
was tending the cow for you.

713
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,049
That young
Rene Jean-Paul Dumond.

714
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,767
He is no longer in my employ,
Monsieur Haggin.

715
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,881
But, Monsieur...

716
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,890
He's no longer in my employ
for the simple reason

717
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,765
that he has not come
to work for two weeks now.

718
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,486
Perhaps he has gone to
that cabin of his uncle

719
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,523
to sit all day
and play the harmonica.

720
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,449
It's not impossible, you know.

721
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,688
You haven't seen him
for two weeks?

722
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,370
I have my work to do,
Mr. Haggin. Goodbye.

723
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,210
Whoa.

724
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,804
Whoa!

725
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,170
And if this cow
gets away again,

726
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,888
I'll have a good idea
where to place full responsibility, sir.

727
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,525
Good day, sir.

728
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,164
Up with the birds
this morning?

729
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,601
And preparing to fly away.

730
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,848
But before you
leave me forever,

731
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,689
can I have my breakfast, please?

732
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,643
You should travel to Paris.

733
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,207
La Comedie-Francaise
is missing a great talent.

734
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,448
What's this? For Monsieur?

735
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,891
Who else?

736
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,924
Monsieur's going
into the woods to hunt at this hour?

737
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,882
Oui, ,.

738
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,890
What would he find to hunt?
Deer season is not open.

739
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,810
One medium-size boy,
if he's lucky.

740
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,881
Quoi?

741
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,367
One medium-size boy.

742
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,891
Rene?

743
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,004
Do we know some other
medium-size boy?

744
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,602
But yesterday Monsieur said he was
closing Wintapi to travel to Europe.

745
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,370
That was yesterday.

746
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,883
When I came down, Monsieur stands
there where you are standing...

747
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,163
- I am sitting.
- You are sitting.

748
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,090
So, he stands there
where you are sitting.

749
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,929
Please, don't spoil the story.

750
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,566
He stands there,
and then out of nowhere,

751
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,049
he says, "The boy has left the farm
of Mereau. No one knows where he is."

752
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,051
"I am going to the cabin of the boy
to see what has happened."

753
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,571
To the boy's cabin?

754
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,763
Did I not say just that?
To the boy's cabin.

755
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,247
- So I said, "Monsieur..."
- I do not understand people.

756
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,840
- So I said...
- Yesterday he was closing Wintapi...

757
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,610
So I said, "Monsieur..."

758
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,929
I said, "Monsieur,
I am very worried"

759
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,407
that no one knows
where Rene has gone."

760
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,682
"Perhaps he lies helpless
in the forest

761
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,643
with a terrible sickness."

762
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,525
- You didn't say that?
- In French.

763
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,730
Well, I will get my things
and I will go with Monsieur.

764
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,444
You will go nowhere.

765
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,847
But it is many miles
to the boy's cabin.

766
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,042
This is a journey of the emotions.

767
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,288
There is no room for two.

768
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,124
Take this to Monsieur.

769
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,890
Vite! Vite!

770
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,521
All right. Don't make so much noise.
We will soon be there.

771
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,928
It is a good thing too, Molly.

772
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,568
I think your family is increasing
one pound with each step I make.

773
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,371
Hey!

774
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,131
Hey, hey.
Take it easy, Mike. Take it easy.

775
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,844
What's the matter?

776
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,247
Just your imagination, as I thought.
Come on. Let's go.

777
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,885
Come on, boy.

778
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,202
Mike! Steady, boy!
Steady, Mike, steady!

779
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,051
Mike!

780
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,451
Shh.
Red has seen something.

781
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,087
Well, he is going hunting again.

782
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,728
It is too bad.
Red likes so much to hunt,

783
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,241
but he never catches anything.

784
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,091
Red!
Come here, boy.

785
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,287
Come on, boy.
Good old Red.

786
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,882
Red, fetch the rifle.
Fetch it, Red.

787
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,245
No, Red. Let him alone.

788
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,321
Red!

789
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,130
Red, don't push him!

790
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,765
Red!

791
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,323
Watch out! Red!

792
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,003
Pretty good shot, Rene.

793
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,524
Monsieur's all right?

794
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,890
Monsieur may be all right
if you can get this rock off his foot.

795
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,411
Oui, Monsieur.

796
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,882
Say, that's quite a family.

797
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,129
Molly did herself proud?

798
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,050
Oh, oui.

799
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,764
I will try to be careful, Monsieur.

800
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,287
Monsieur will appreciate that.

801
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,769
Thank you.

802
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,810
You know, Rene,

803
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,321
I was wrong about him,
about Red.

804
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,129
I said he was irresponsible,

805
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,881
but he was ready to get himself
killed for me. Ouch!

806
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,525
Pardon, Monsieur.

807
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,007
Now, we'll try this.

808
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,650
Monsieur, there is something
I wish to say.

809
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,886
Save it.

810
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,570
Monsieur, I have been thinking.

811
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,251
I have made
many mistakes, Monsieur,

812
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,330
and those mistakes
were by my own foolishness.

813
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,011
I have caused Monsieur
much trouble.

814
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,681
Forget it, son. It's all
over and done with. Fini.

815
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,886
- Fini?
- Yes, fini.

816
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,011
Does...

817
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,722
Does Monsieur...

818
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,169
Would Monsieur want me
in his employ again, perhaps?

819
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,328
No, Monsieur would not want you
in his employ again, perhaps.

820
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,451
Rene.

821
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,210
- Oui, Monsieur?
- You're going to school.

822
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,926
You'll live with me at Wintapi,
and then you'll go to school.

823
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,281
- Oh, no, Monsieur.
- Don't you "oh, no" me.

824
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,085
L figured the whole thing out
while I was riding up here.

825
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,249
I'll probably have to help you
with your lessons until you catch up.

826
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,762
Monsieur, I could not accept
such a generous offer.

827
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,245
Why?

828
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,883
Look, son, let's cut
this horsing around.

829
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,243
I came up here because
I was worried about you.

830
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,488
- About me?
- Yes, you.

831
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,564
Now, you don't have
to accept this deal,

832
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,126
but at least let's talk
about it sensibly.

833
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,960
"Deal"?

834
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,128
What is a "deal, " Monsieur?

835
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,211
Well, a deal is a...

836
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,931
A deal's an arrangement
where both parties benefit.

837
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,004
Both parties?

838
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,043
Both parties.

839
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,722
- You need an education, and I... What?
- Monsieur.

840
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,042
You are right about this,
"horsing around."

841
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,006
There is nothing
I would like better in the whole world

842
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,681
than to stay with you at Wintapi

843
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,609
and go to school.

844
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,125
Okay?

845
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,204
Okay.

846
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,880
Get our pups and let's go home.

847
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,129
You tell me
if I lean too heavily.
