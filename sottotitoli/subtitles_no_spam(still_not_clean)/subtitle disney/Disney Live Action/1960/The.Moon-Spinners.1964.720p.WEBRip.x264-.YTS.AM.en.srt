Fran, I think
I'm going to be...

21
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,442
No, hold on.

22
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,951
We're bound to be there
in a minute.

23
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,317
Here.

24
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,818
Concentrate madly
on something else.

25
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:49,053
It's all mental.

26
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,528
That fish isn't.

27
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:54,088
Change places with me.

28
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:56,326
There's a bit of air
from the window.

29
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,941
I say...

30
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:17,008
I wonder if
you'd be so kind...

31
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:19,646
as to put that
somewhere else?

32
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:24,654
The fish... could you
put it somewhere?

33
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:27,593
It's a bit strong.

34
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:30,357
Girl: Could you put it
somewhere else?

35
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,388
I don't knowwhy
one always thinks...

36
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,457
foreigners will suddenly
understand English...

37
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:37,493
if one shouts.

38
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,436
Fran, I don't think
I can manage.

39
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:42,668
I'm sure it's just
around the next corner.

40
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,007
Try reciting
The Jabberwocky.

41
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:48,069
Think of it
on the printed page...

42
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:51,707
and force yourself to
remember the illustrations.

43
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,717
"'Twas brillig..."

44
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:58,585
BOTH: "And the slithy toves
did gyre and gimble."

45
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:01,455
Quick.
The smelling salts.

46
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:08,521
Aghios Georgios!

47
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:11,692
Thank heaven.
That's us.

48
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,300
Excuse me. Come on.

49
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,671
I'm... I'm terribly sorry.

50
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,766
Please forgive me.

51
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,400
Aghios Georgios!

52
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,274
We're coming!
Nikky!

53
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:27,371
Excuse me!

54
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,408
Ooh.

55
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:33,886
FRAN:
Nikky, come on!

56
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,046
I'm coming!

57
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,554
Now, have we got
everything?

58
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:43,220
Suitcases, knapsacks,
tape recorder...

59
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:46,058
Oh. Aghios Georgios?

60
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:49,123
Aghios Georgios.

61
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:31,434
Cousin Orestes,
visitors from England!

62
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:37,771
ORESTES: You are welcome
to my wedding.

63
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,307
Hey, missis,
my hotel!

64
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,391
Stratos, they're here.

65
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,829
Will you come down?

66
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:41,832
I'm busy.

67
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:43,026
But I need your help.

68
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,035
I said I was busy.

69
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,559
Will you leave this
for once?

70
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:49,300
Orestes is our cousin.
They're all expecting you.

71
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,433
I came back because
I had work to do.

72
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:55,536
All I want is
some peace and quiet.

73
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,342
You didn't come back
for love of your family...

74
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,075
or your village.

75
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,606
That much is certain.

76
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:04,113
What do you mean
by that?

77
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,912
You suddenly appear
from London.

78
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:08,684
You don't want
to see anyone.

79
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,816
You don't want me
to take any visitors.

80
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:13,919
You and this Englishman watch
each other like cat and mouse.

81
00:08:13,962 --> 00:08:17,761
You're very observant,
aren't you, little sister?

82
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,561
You fill your head
with this...

83
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,693
stars, fortunes,
astrology.

84
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,760
I warn you again.

85
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,930
Stay out
of my business.

86
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,736
If you do, you'll have
all the money you need.

87
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,741
If you don't...

88
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,969
This make money?

89
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,808
More than you
ever dreamed of.

90
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,277
How? w?

91
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,405
By keeping one step
ahead of chance.

92
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,939
Always one step ahead.

93
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,145
Chance or the law? w?

94
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,380
Go and see to your guests.

95
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:45,686
Out, you hear?

96
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:48,283
You better go
to the church sometimes.

97
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:49,485
Those are works
of the devil.

98
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:50,857
Out!

99
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:11,678
Thank you.

100
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,806
Look, the Moon-Spinners.

101
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:17,248
What does that mean,
Alexis?

102
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:20,617
Is old song... very old song.

103
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:24,423
Mama, visitors from England.

104
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:25,821
2 nice old ladies.

105
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,629
How do you do?
I'm Frances Ferris.

106
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,160
Did you get
our telegram?

107
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,297
Telegram?

108
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,431
I sent it yesterday
from Heraklion.

109
00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:48,133
There was no telegram.

110
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:51,078
But that's incredible.
Nikky, you didn't...

111
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:52,375
I sent it myself.

112
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:54,406
The man at the post office
translated it.

113
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,747
Well, I'm sorry.

114
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:59,346
Well, I asked you to reserve us
2 rooms for a few days.

115
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:00,911
This is my niece.

116
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,333
This hotel is
not open for visitors.

117
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,086
Mama!

118
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,456
Please! I can see
we've arrived at a bad moment...

119
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:11,055
but you've simply
got to put us up somewhere.

120
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:13,760
I was not
expecting you.

121
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,462
Will you excuse me,
please?

122
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:22,102
Well, I'm not going
to be beaten.

123
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:35,178
Look here.
Could you at least...

124
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,982
find us a room
in the village?

125
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,615
I'm sorry, but I have
a great many guests.

126
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:41,818
Mama, why don't you
give them...

127
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:43,951
one of the empty rooms?

128
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:45,621
Have you got empty rooms?

129
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:47,027
We're absolutely
exhausted.

130
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,325
We can't possibly go back...

131
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:50,026
all the way
to Heraklion tonight.

132
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,795
If you don't give us
one of those rooms...

133
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,096
wedding or no wedding...

134
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:55,399
I shall sleep right here
on the floor.

135
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,630
Please.

136
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:03,274
Well, take the ladies
upstairs.

137
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,471
They can have number 3.

138
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:08,411
Jolly good show!
Come, I show you.

139
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,416
As for dinner,
I will see.

140
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,917
Anything.
Even a sandwich.

141
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:15,115
I shall require
2 normal 3-course dinners.

142
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:16,122
Thank you.

143
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,156
Aunt, really.

144
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,057
Is very best room.

145
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:29,464
Nice beds, nice table,
nice chairs.

146
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,830
Hey, missis.

147
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,971
Nice expansion.

148
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,498
Yes, it is.

149
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:42,341
It's a very nice
expansion, indeed.

150
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,079
Well, at least it's clean.

151
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:46,513
Hmm.

152
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:49,313
Why was your mother
so set against us staying here?

153
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:50,944
It's Uncle Stratos.

154
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:52,614
Since he come back
from London...

155
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:54,417
he don't like
no one...

156
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:57,050
but I like you both,
so everything OK.

157
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:03,093
Wait a minute.

158
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:05,522
Thank you very much.

159
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:06,533
No.

160
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,762
You crazy or something?

161
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:10,099
Thank you, missis.

162
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:11,347
If there's anything
that you want,

163
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,464
you just ask Alexis.

164
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,906
Uncle Stratos,
visitors from England.

165
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:18,103
Good afternoon.

166
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,474
What are you doing here?

167
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:20,655
FRANCES:
We've come to stay...

168
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,078
if you have
no objection.

169
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:23,547
She has let you
the room?

170
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:25,482
This is a hotel,
isn't it?

171
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,484
I mean, it is
the custom in Crete...

172
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,715
to let room to visitors,
or am I mistaken?

173
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,723
How did you hear
of Aghios Georgios?

174
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:35,123
FRANCES: Someone told us
at the hotel in Heraklion.

175
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,719
I'm a musicologist.
I collect folk songs.

176
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:41,128
What kind of songs
do you expect to find here?

177
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:46,100
Um, the song that this hotel
is called after, for one.

178
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,865
Now, do you mind?
We'd like to rest.

179
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:52,935
All right.
You can spend the night here.

180
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:55,204
FRANCES: That's
extremely kind of you.

181
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:57,234
Couldn't we at least
have a bath?

182
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,905
There is no bath here.

183
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:01,211
Alexis will give you water
to wash in if you wish...

184
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:03,614
or else there is the sea.

185
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,983
There is a bus leaving
for Isle Mykonos tomorrow.

186
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:11,550
Swell.

187
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,922
Really.

188
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,654
My Uncle Stratos
is much lousy man.

189
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,321
I bring you water.

190
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,626
Lousy is the word!

191
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,995
Well, if that's
an example...

192
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:24,229
of Cretan
hospitality, l...

193
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,330
Oh, it's so awful.
It's hilarious.

194
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,467
Oh, well, at least
it couldn't be any worse.

195
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,205
Oh, darling,
I am sorry.

196
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,872
I promise that
we'll spend a week...

197
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,209
in Cannes
on the way home...

198
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:38,509
and we'll dress up...

199
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:42,279
and go to all the galas
and be madly gay.

200
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:44,843
But you knowwhat's going
to be the final blow? w?

201
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:46,445
The one available Englishman...

202
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:48,581
will be some... some
moth-eaten old professor...

203
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,819
about 75 who's only
interested in ruins.

204
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,986
Well, he'll have
one here ready-made.

205
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,039
Thanks, Lambis.

206
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,618
You went to
the Bay of Dolphins?

207
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,593
Huh? Yes.

208
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:31,787
Skin diving?

209
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,095
Yes. The water's so clear
you could see everything.

210
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,827
And how much did you see?

211
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,062
Hmm?

212
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,502
It was you, wasn't it,
out in that boat watching me?

213
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:45,735
Don't be so shy next time.
I'll give you a diving lesson.

214
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,763
Aunt Fran, don't you think
we ought to dress for dinner...

215
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:01,186
to sort of honor
the bride?

216
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:15,456
Yes.

217
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:27,869
There he is.
There he is!

218
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:29,570
Who?

219
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:31,308
The old Englishman.

220
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:35,580
♪ La la la-la-la
la la la ♪

221
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,109
Oh, he's charming.

222
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,950
You go in.
I don't want to be first.

223
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,321
Good evening.

224
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:48,920
Good evening.

225
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:49,974
You must be
the two old English...

226
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,056
Hmm?

227
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,964
You must be
the two old English ladies...

228
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,366
Alexis told me about.

229
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:57,996
Have you been here long?

230
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,198
Um...

231
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,982
Whew!
I'm Mark Camford.

232
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:11,984
Frances Ferris.

233
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,144
How do you do?

234
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:14,151
My niece Nikky.

235
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:15,152
- Hello.
- Good evening.

236
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:17,484
I thought, perhaps,
since everyone was celebrating,

237
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:18,566
we might have dinner
together.

238
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,251
- We'd love to.
- Yes!

239
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,486
What a pleasant
surprise.

240
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,254
I had Alexis
keep us a table outside.

241
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:24,852
- All right?
- Yes.

242
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,578
I bring you dinner.
Same as them.

243
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,548
Oh, thank you,
Alexis.

244
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,843
Sweet.

245
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,362
Is this the first time
you've been to Greece?

246
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,131
We spent a week in Athens
before coming here.

247
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:55,645
Uh-huh.

248
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,020
Have you been
to Athens?

249
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,024
Mmm.

250
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,323
It's fabulous, isn't it,
the Acropolis and everything?

251
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:04,660
I mean, it's so exactly
like the Acropolis.

252
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,141
I wish they could stick
it all together again...

253
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:07,530
don't you?

254
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:09,363
Have you been here long?

255
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,198
Hmm?
No, no. Not very, no.

256
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:14,034
It's a quaint little place.
Dead quiet as a rule.

257
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:15,903
I'm surprised Uncle Stratos
let you stay.

258
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,339
He practically threw us out.

259
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,275
I mean, I can't
understand why he has...

260
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,575
such a very odd attitude
to visitors, can you?

261
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:24,376
He's a very odd one,
Uncle Stratos.

262
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:26,814
Do you know he devours books
on astrology?

263
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,318
Strong with charms and fetishes
like a witch doctor.

264
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:32,048
It'd take a witch doctor
to improve his manners.

265
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,484
V ery good olives.
I make myself.

266
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:36,491
Ah, let's see.

267
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:38,425
- Have some octopus.
- Aah!

268
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,580
These English women...
what are they doing here?

269
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,275
They're friends of Camford?

270
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,283
I don't know.

271
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,580
I told them
they must leave tomorrow.

272
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,384
He was skin diving
very, very near.

273
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,083
I know, I know.

274
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,117
Stratos, why are you
playing this game?

275
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,128
You knowwho he is,
what he came for.

276
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,790
Why you do not
send him away?

277
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:23,356
I don't want to
send him away, Lambis.

278
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,163
What are you going to do?

279
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:31,533
There will be decisive
developments tonight.

280
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,900
Look at Alexis.
Isn't he wonderful?

281
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:37,411
Do you like to dance?

282
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:39,243
Oh, I love it.

283
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:40,805
I'm like the girl
in the red shoes.

284
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:43,749
Once I start, I can go
on and on and on until I drop.

285
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,984
Are there any dances that
women can join in, too?

286
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:51,991
Oh, yes.

287
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,583
FRANCES: I do wish
you'd tell us...

288
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,652
why this hotel is called
the Moon-Spinners.

289
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,789
It's such
an unusual name.

290
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:58,922
It is a legend.

291
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:00,226
Who are
the Moon-Spinners?

292
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,996
Three sisters who spin
the full moon.

293
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:05,333
Doesn't the legend have to do
with the Bay of Dolphins?

294
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:07,361
Alexis told me
there was supposed to be...

295
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,236
a sunken ship
laden with treasure.

296
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,241
Really?

297
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,573
In Crete, there are
many old tales.

298
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,050
I understand
when the moon is full...

299
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,222
you're supposed
to be able to see...

300
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:17,179
the treasure at
the bottom of the bay.

301
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:18,977
Do you think
there's any treasure...

302
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,415
in the Bay of Dolphins?

303
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,112
There are sharks...

304
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:24,676
and many dangerous octopus
among the rocks.

305
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,086
Sharks!

306
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:29,922
Yes. I warned you before
not to go swimming there.

307
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:33,189
I see you quite often
out there in your boat.

308
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:35,628
Let us hope I do not
fish you out one day...

309
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:37,222
without an arm or a leg.

310
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,332
My cousin Orestes.

311
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:42,446
My very good friends
from London.

312
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,437
How do you do?

313
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:44,870
You like to meet
Ariadne please?

314
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:45,872
Oh, we'd love to.

315
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:46,906
Yes!

316
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,778
Oh, you look so pretty.

317
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,006
Tell her how pretty
she looks.

318
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,514
How do you do?

319
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:56,981
Would you mind
if I gave her...

320
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,847
that scarf
you bought me in Athens?

321
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,112
What a good idea!

322
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:01,346
I'll be back
in a minute.

323
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,616
Be a dear and bring me
my tape recorder.

324
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:04,655
OK!

325
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,850
Oh, thank you very much.

326
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:20,363
What are you doing?

327
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,530
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:26,234
I... I came up here
to get some of my books.

329
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,300
This used to be my room,
you know.

330
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,743
Well, there were
no books in here.

331
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,146
Well,
I said I was sorry.

332
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,009
Oh, by the way,
it's quite a coincidence...

333
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,713
your meeting
an old friend here.

334
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:41,051
What old friend?

335
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,851
Mr. Camford.

336
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,154
We never saw him before
until tonight.

337
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:50,630
Oh, well, have a very pleasant
evening, gðice Ferris.

338
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:07,837
I'm sorry, Alexis.

339
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,539
I haven't the dimmest idea
what I'm doing.

340
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,140
Hey, you're pretty good.
I think you do this before.

341
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:19,755
Ha ha! It's a wonderful rhythm.
If only I knew the steps.

342
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:20,847
Who cares
about the steps?

343
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,168
We're inventing
a dance all our own.

344
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,216
Opa!

345
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:24,351
Opa!

346
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,091
He's watching again.

347
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,234
Oh, he's always on the lookout
for something.

348
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,601
There's something sinister
about the whole family...

349
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,506
except little Alexis.

350
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:44,009
And who's
that sullen young man...

351
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,238
who's always hanging about?

352
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:47,123
Oh, that's cousin Lambis.
He helps around the inn.

353
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:48,614
Well, l...

354
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:51,742
Ha ha! Well, I think
they're all up to something.

355
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:52,994
How'd you like to go
swimming tomorrow? w?

356
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:54,645
Oh, I'd love to.
Where?

357
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,621
MARK: We'll go
to the Bay of Dolphins.

358
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:57,713
What about the sharks?

359
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:58,723
Oh, that's all nonsense.

360
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:00,281
We'll take lunch
and make a day of it.

361
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:01,815
Wonderful.

362
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
What do you say?

363
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,605
Shall we shatter tradition
and really let go?

364
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:06,324
Yes.

365
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,904
Good night,
Mr. Camford.

366
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:05,438
Good night,
Miss Ferris.

367
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,280
Where are they all going?

368
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:09,650
Hmm? They're singing
the bride and groom to bed.

369
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,653
It's a local custom.

370
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:11,711
Can we go?

371
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:13,723
Look, you must have had
an awfully long day.

372
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:14,934
Don't you think
you ought to turn in?

373
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,653
Then we can get
an early start tomorrow? w?

374
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,888
I am quite tired, actually.

375
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:23,090
Ahh. It turned into
a lovely evening.

376
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:24,190
Good.

377
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,200
That's the nicest way
for things to happen...

378
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:26,701
when they come
as a surprise.

379
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:27,928
- Good night.
- Good night.

380
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,647
Shall I meet you about
half past 9:00 tomorrow? w?

381
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:30,968
Uh-huh.

382
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:32,734
Look at the moon.

383
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:36,672
I don't think at home
it ever seems...

384
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,541
so huge and so close.

385
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:42,036
The Moon-Spinners must be
working full-time tonight.

386
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,107
I think that's
what I shall become.

387
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,311
I can't think of
a lovelier way...

388
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:47,319
of spending my life...

389
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:49,082
than spinning
that silver light.

390
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:52,415
You're quite a romantic,
aren't you?

391
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:55,657
No, it's unusual nowadays.

392
00:23:57,195 --> 00:23:58,162
Good night.

393
00:23:58,196 --> 00:23:59,196
Good night, Mark.

394
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:09,738
Mr. Camford!

395
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:12,900
You're so fond
of the Bay of Dolphins.

396
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:15,775
Would you care to come
night-fishing with me?

397
00:24:15,812 --> 00:24:18,280
That's very good of you,
Stratos.

398
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:20,281
No, thanks.

399
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,909
It's great fun,
you know.

400
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:24,179
Oh, I'm sure.

401
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:32,887
Some other time,
perhaps?

402
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,656
Some other time,
perhaps.

403
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:36,489
Happy harpooning.

404
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,759
Oh, Fran, honestly.

405
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,199
Tell me honestly.

406
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:21,675
Do think I'll ever have...

407
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:24,171
what the magazines call
"allure"?

408
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,696
You've got the best
of all qualities.

409
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,606
You're completely yourself.

410
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,770
Oh, I don't think
that's such an advantage.

411
00:25:33,414 --> 00:25:34,813
Oh, look at me.

412
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:37,442
I wish I could do something
to my face.

413
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:42,283
How about this?

414
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,016
Too old.

415
00:25:44,057 --> 00:25:45,524
Yeah.

416
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:47,989
This?

417
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,960
Too young.

418
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:54,291
It's... it's... you see,
it's this being...

419
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:55,628
so terribly in between...

420
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,566
that makes it
so difficult.

421
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:00,867
He said
I was a romantic.

422
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:03,731
Nowadays,
that's one step...

423
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:05,900
from being told
you're a drip.

424
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,739
Don't rush it,
darling.

425
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:09,677
You've only
met the man once.

426
00:26:11,114 --> 00:26:12,842
Oh, I know...

427
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:14,405
but I said
all the wrong things...

428
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,712
talked a blue streak,
as usual.

429
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:17,218
NIKKY: You know,
I hear myself.

430
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:19,345
Yakkity-yakkity-yak.
I can't stop.

431
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,987
Oh, well.

432
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:24,753
Well, he must have
liked you.

433
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,918
NIKKY: Why?

434
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,791
He wouldn't have asked you
to go swimming.

435
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:29,626
He is nice, isn't he?

436
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:31,096
V ery.

437
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,099
You sound undecided.

438
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,760
He's charming.

439
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,598
I think he's
a little mysterious.

440
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,933
Why?

441
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,268
I don't know.
Just an impression.

442
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:43,366
Oh, turn out the light,
will you?

443
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:55,786
I do love you, Aunt Fran.

444
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,787
Thank you for always
being there.

445
00:26:57,821 --> 00:26:59,220
FRANCES: Good night,
my darling.

446
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:54,748
Aah!

447
00:29:37,229 --> 00:29:38,287
Good morning.

448
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,558
Good morning, Nikky.

449
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:42,225
Oh, Alexis, could I have
some of that...

450
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:43,564
to take with me
this morning?

451
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,131
Lovely day, isn't it?

452
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:50,731
You must be tired
after such a big wedding.

453
00:29:50,774 --> 00:29:52,935
It was a wonderful dinner,
too... really wonderful.

454
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:53,976
Thank you.

455
00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,191
Oh, I hate
to bother you...

456
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,705
but could I have
some tea or coffee?

457
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,741
I don't have tea.
I'll make you coffee.

458
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:04,150
My aunt's still sleeping.

459
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:07,151
Is Mr. Camford down yet?

460
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,621
Mr. Camford?

461
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:11,251
Yes. We're going
swimming this morning.

462
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:12,885
Um...

463
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,521
I wondered if
he was anywhere about.

464
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,654
SOPHIA: He's gone.

465
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:19,097
Gone? Where?

466
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:22,102
To Heraklion.
He left by the early bus.

467
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,234
But he can't have.

468
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:30,640
Didn't he leave a message
or a note or anything?

469
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:31,735
No, nothing.

470
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:33,177
Oh, but l...

471
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Thank you.

472
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:46,835
Aah!

473
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,173
Mark.

474
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,109
Mark?

475
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,081
Mark, it's Nikky.

476
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,154
Oh, uh...

477
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,559
Hello.

478
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:17,129
What are you doing here?

479
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:18,630
They said you'd gone.

480
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:20,898
I, um...

481
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,735
I'm...

482
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,397
I must have
fallen asleep.

483
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:27,996
Your arm.
What's happened?

484
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,563
I'm sorry I stood you up.

485
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:30,607
Ohh!

486
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,342
Wait a minute.

487
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:40,079
What time is it?

488
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:42,818
About half past 10:00.

489
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Thank you.

490
00:35:46,255 --> 00:35:48,553
They said you'd gone
to Heraklion...

491
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:51,025
but I felt
something was wrong.

492
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,857
How did you get in here?

493
00:35:52,895 --> 00:35:57,729
I remember crawling in
just... just before dawn.

494
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:03,703
Sorry.

495
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:04,704
I'll go get some help.

496
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:05,982
No, Nikky, listen.
Please listen.

497
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:07,837
Did you have a fight
with someone?

498
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,206
Look, if you want
to help me...

499
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:12,938
go back to the inn
and bring me some clothes.

500
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,970
Anything. And... and, uh...

501
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:17,005
something to eat.
I've got to get out of here.

502
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,414
You must see
a doctor first.

503
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,561
- I'll get Aunt Fran.
- Nikky...

504
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:20,552
And then we'll
find some people...

505
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:21,552
to carry you back.

506
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:22,644
Will you please listen?

507
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:25,019
I don't want anyone
to know you found me here.

508
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:26,546
Not anyone.
Not even your aunt.

509
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:27,683
Do you understand?

510
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,353
But Mark,
someone's tried to kill you.

511
00:36:30,394 --> 00:36:32,419
We must get the police.

512
00:36:32,463 --> 00:36:35,159
The last thing I want
at the moment is the police.

513
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,666
Please...

514
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,227
tell me what happened.

515
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:46,902
You'll find some clothes
in my room.

516
00:36:46,942 --> 00:36:48,000
And if you can...

517
00:36:48,043 --> 00:36:49,487
swipe a bottle
of brandy from the bar.

518
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:51,206
I'm cold all over.

519
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:55,149
Here.

520
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,150
Oh...

521
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:02,948
I... I always fancied
myself in pink.

522
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:05,218
Mark?

523
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:08,590
You've got to tell me.

524
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:10,220
Was it Stratos?

525
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,124
Look...

526
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:15,531
either do as I ask
or beat it...

527
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,592
'cause I haven't got
the strength to explain.

528
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,069
All right.

529
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,197
I'll... I'll be back
as soon as I can.

530
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,798
OK. Good girl.

531
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:26,147
Mr. Stratos,
may I speak to you?

532
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:29,325
Go ahead.

533
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,621
Please don't
misunderstand me...

534
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,560
but I've just been
up to my room.

535
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:35,222
My travelling rug
appears to have vanished.

536
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,231
Oh?

537
00:41:36,265 --> 00:41:38,096
It was folded
across the bed.

538
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:39,896
I wonder if
you've any idea...

539
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:41,402
what might have
become of it.

540
00:41:41,436 --> 00:41:44,700
Travelling rug?
Ask my sister.

541
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:47,333
Also my first aid kit.

542
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:52,342
First aid kit?

543
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,347
FRANCES: In a box
which was so big...

544
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:56,178
with iodine and bandages.

545
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:57,240
One never uses it...

546
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:58,251
but I always
take it with me...

547
00:41:58,285 --> 00:41:59,717
in case of emergencies.

548
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:02,581
Emergencies?

549
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,682
Perhaps your niece
took these things...

550
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:06,691
with her this morning.

551
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,658
It's hardly likely
that she'd take...

552
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,093
a travelling rug
on a day like this.

553
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,563
And I doubt whether she's
in any need of bandages.

554
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:15,725
Do you know
where she went?

555
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,961
Mr. Camfordpromised
to take her swimming.

556
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,902
I suppose she must have
gone off somewhere alone.

557
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,235
Mr. Camford.

558
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,202
Yes. He always went
to the Bay of Dolphins.

559
00:42:27,243 --> 00:42:29,905
I will look into
this matter at once.

560
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:32,414
If she has not your things,
I will ask in the village.

561
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:34,312
Don't worry.
They will be returned.

562
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:53,665
Mark?

563
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:55,867
Mark?

564
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:56,902
Hmm?

565
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:01,702
What on earth
are you doing in there?

566
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,402
Well, at least it's not
so drafty as that floor.

567
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,907
Here.

568
00:43:06,945 --> 00:43:09,276
Oh, brandy.
Nikky, you are marvelous.

569
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:13,847
Oh, Mark,
I've had an awful time.

570
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:15,613
All your things
have vanished.

571
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:18,086
Your room
was completely bare.

572
00:43:18,121 --> 00:43:19,884
Oh, I should've
guessed that.

573
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,854
Mark, will you please
get out of that thing?

574
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,416
It gives me
the absolute creeps.

575
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:34,766
- Mind your head.
- Yeah.

576
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,207
It's all right.

577
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:42,004
All right. Sit here.

578
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,203
Come here. Come.

579
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:45,711
Sit down there.

580
00:43:49,282 --> 00:43:51,773
Oh, found your shoe
on the beach.

581
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:53,250
Oh, marvelous.

582
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:56,514
Now let's see.

583
00:43:56,555 --> 00:43:57,555
Ow.

584
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:00,959
Oh.

585
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:05,792
- Careful.
- Yes, yes, all right.

586
00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:08,059
There. See?

587
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:10,593
It's all right.

588
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:19,734
Crikey. Hope I can
remember what to do.

589
00:44:19,776 --> 00:44:22,074
I was always bottom
at first aid at school.

590
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:23,578
That's encouraging.

591
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:27,076
Um...

592
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:30,107
it was
the reverse spiral...

593
00:44:30,152 --> 00:44:31,949
and repeat figure 8.

594
00:44:31,987 --> 00:44:33,750
In cases of
multiple fracture...

595
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:35,814
I'm not multiply
fractured yet.

596
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:38,484
All right.
Now keep calm.

597
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:39,720
I am calm.

598
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,727
You better have
some more brandy.

599
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,729
This is bound to hurt.

600
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,525
Mmm!

601
00:44:44,564 --> 00:44:46,896
Oh, don't do that!

602
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:52,101
I wonder if there's
anything in there...

603
00:44:52,138 --> 00:44:53,105
I ought to dig out.

604
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:55,504
Look, whatever's
in there, leave it.

605
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:07,081
Now hold that.
That's right.

606
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:08,551
Don't move it.

607
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:17,655
Did Stratos actually
try to kill you?

608
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:19,684
Don't ask questions.

609
00:45:19,728 --> 00:45:22,196
He almost caught me
at the inn just now.

610
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,630
I nearly fainted.

611
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,963
Are you sure
he didn't see you?

612
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,298
No. No.
I'm sure he didn't.

613
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:28,734
All right.

614
00:45:30,371 --> 00:45:32,202
Please tell me
what happened.

615
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,333
I don't want you
to become involved.

616
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,434
You've got to go
to the police.

617
00:45:36,478 --> 00:45:38,468
If he finds you,
he might try it again.

618
00:45:38,512 --> 00:45:39,877
Well, look,
that's my affair.

619
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:43,144
Now... now what
you've gotta do, uh...

620
00:45:43,183 --> 00:45:46,413
is... is clear out
of Aghios Georgios.

621
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,249
You see? You take
the afternoon bus...

622
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,982
with your aunt
to Aghios Nikolaos.

623
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:51,633
Do you understand? Now put
that down... put that down.

624
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:52,624
But why us?

625
00:45:52,658 --> 00:45:54,090
You're the one
who's in trouble.

626
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,650
If he knew
you've been helping me...

627
00:45:55,694 --> 00:45:57,628
he might take
a potshot at you.

628
00:45:57,662 --> 00:45:59,527
Mark, whatever
is going on?

629
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:00,826
You've got
to get out of here.

630
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:02,610
Well, I'm not gonna
leave you here like this.

631
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,359
You need help. -You've
given me all the help I need.

632
00:46:05,402 --> 00:46:07,302
Just stop
ordering me about!

633
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:08,862
Up the steps. March!

634
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:10,806
- Hurry up. Come on.
- Mark!

635
00:46:10,841 --> 00:46:13,001
Will you please
be reasonable?

636
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:14,407
You look wretched
and white.

637
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:16,122
You'll only faint in the sun
or fall off a cliff.

638
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:17,443
I'm perfectly OK, Nikky.

639
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,539
Thank you for
everything you've done.

640
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:21,173
See you at Aunt Agatha's
next Tuesday.

641
00:46:21,216 --> 00:46:22,183
Mark!

642
00:46:22,217 --> 00:46:23,217
Scram!

643
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:28,480
You deserve to die
a horrible, lingering death...

644
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:29,615
and I hope you do!

645
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:30,715
MARK: Beat it!

646
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:47,799
Ah, gðice Ferris.

647
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,274
Your aunt has been
worried about you.

648
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:52,743
Oh, I'm on my way
back to the inn now.

649
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:54,803
Where have you been
all morning?

650
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:58,373
Looking for rocks.
I collect rocks.

651
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,281
You carry them in that?

652
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:01,478
Sometimes.

653
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,749
If I happen to find a lot.
Rocks can be very heavy.

654
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:07,256
How many did you find
this morning?

655
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,948
Not many.

656
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,426
In fact, none.

657
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,928
Well, I mustn't be late
for lunch, must I?

658
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:25,166
Who needed this,
Miss Ferris?

659
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:27,402
Well...

660
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,840
As a matter of fact...

661
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:32,072
I wasn't actually
looking for rocks.

662
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:35,013
Well, that is,
I was at first.

663
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:37,017
But then I went up there
into the hills...

664
00:47:37,051 --> 00:47:39,075
and I came across
this shepherd...

665
00:47:39,118 --> 00:47:40,483
who'd broken his leg.

666
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,454
He'd slipped
and broken his leg.

667
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:44,115
Ah...

668
00:47:44,157 --> 00:47:46,921
Oh, the poor man was lying
out there with nothing...

669
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:49,257
so of coursse
I had to do something.

670
00:47:49,294 --> 00:47:50,420
Up... up in the hills?

671
00:47:50,462 --> 00:47:53,363
Uh-huh. Uh, look.

672
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:59,130
Up there.

673
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,364
He was awfully grateful.

674
00:48:00,404 --> 00:48:01,648
He was an awfully
nice shepherd...

675
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:03,105
very old...

676
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,300
Well, you show me
where you left him.

677
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:06,639
I will make arrangements...

678
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,644
to have him carried
back to the village.

679
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:09,855
Oh, he could walk.
He walked away.

680
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:10,846
He's quite
all right now.

681
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,780
He walked?
With a broken leg?

682
00:48:12,816 --> 00:48:14,373
Yes.

683
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,111
Well, good-bye.

684
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:24,718
Mr. Stratos,
uh...

685
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:26,750
really,
he's all right.

686
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:28,853
Perhaps it wasn't
completely broken.

687
00:48:28,896 --> 00:48:30,954
I think we should
make sure, don't you?

688
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:33,023
No. He's gone home
with his sheep.

689
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:34,397
When a shepherd
breaks his leg...

690
00:48:34,434 --> 00:48:36,732
he always goes into
this church to pray.

691
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,602
It's an old tradition
in Aghios Georgios.

692
00:48:42,908 --> 00:48:44,239
Oh...

693
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:47,075
Mr. Stratos,
I promise you.

694
00:48:47,113 --> 00:48:48,841
He went over
the mountains to...

695
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,905
You are
a very bad liar!

696
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:53,383
You're also
a very stupid girl.

697
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:55,249
You've come to see
the beauties of Crete?

698
00:48:55,287 --> 00:48:56,480
Let me show you one.

699
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,920
Let me go!
Leave me alone!

700
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:00,446
Let me go!

701
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:29,108
You see?
There's no one here.

702
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:46,262
Mark! Mark, look out!

703
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:22,292
How much did
he tell you, huh?

704
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:30,302
Answer me.

705
00:50:30,337 --> 00:50:32,998
How much do you know? w?

706
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,607
Did you see her?

707
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:45,514
Well, she was not
on the beach.

708
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,678
She must have gone
up into the hills.

709
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,550
It's a beautiful day.

710
00:50:50,588 --> 00:50:53,216
It's so unlike her
not to have let me know.

711
00:50:53,257 --> 00:50:56,658
I'm, uh, going shooting
in those hills with Lambis.

712
00:50:56,694 --> 00:50:58,957
If we see her there,
we'll tell her...

713
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:00,519
that you were worried.

714
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:01,621
Oh, I don't mind...

715
00:51:01,664 --> 00:51:03,291
so long as
she's all right.

716
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:08,267
Hey, bon appetit,
Mrs. Ferris.

717
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:10,134
Tonight, if we are lucky...

718
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:12,265
you will have quail
for dinner.

719
00:51:12,307 --> 00:51:13,274
Quail?

720
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:14,434
It is a local dish...

721
00:51:14,476 --> 00:51:17,273
stuffed with
mushrooms and thyme.

722
00:51:17,311 --> 00:51:19,142
Extremely tasty.

723
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,442
It sounds delicious.

724
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:21,481
Yes.

725
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,225
So? These are guns.

726
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:38,423
You've seen guns before.
I'm going shooting.

727
00:51:38,464 --> 00:51:39,658
Something has happened.

728
00:51:39,698 --> 00:51:40,698
Eh?

729
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:45,728
Did you tell me
the truth this morning?

730
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,896
The truth?

731
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,405
About Mr. Camford.

732
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,073
I must know.

733
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,943
I must know
what is going on.

734
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,537
You know
what I tell you.

735
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,877
That is enough.

736
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,007
No, it's not enough.

737
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:01,277
You tell me
Mr. Camford left...

738
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:03,581
with the early bus.
Why? Why?

739
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:05,177
Why should I know? w?
He's a visitor.

740
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:06,916
He comes and goes
as he chooses.

741
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:09,253
I did not hear him leave.

742
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,020
Why should you hear?

743
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:13,254
He left quietly so as
not to disturb anyone.

744
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:14,295
And now these guns.

745
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:18,759
I don't understand.

746
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:20,198
I'm afraid.

747
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:22,099
Please, Stratos,
whatever happened...

748
00:52:22,136 --> 00:52:23,262
tell me the truth.

749
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:25,863
Mr. Camford went to Heraklion.

750
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:28,339
Miss Ferris lost her way.

751
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:31,070
I am going to shoot quail.

752
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,078
What is the matter
with you?

753
00:52:33,112 --> 00:52:34,908
Someone must have
taken these things.

754
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:36,346
Yes, the children
in the village...

755
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:38,872
the devil himself.
What do I care?

756
00:52:54,397 --> 00:52:55,625
I think after lunch...

757
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:57,826
I'll walk along the beach
and look for her.

758
00:52:57,868 --> 00:52:59,468
I suppose you didn't
find out anything...

759
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:00,992
about my things.

760
00:53:43,107 --> 00:53:45,871
STRATOS: I'll watch the bay.
You take the high country.

761
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,502
Search. Find him.

762
00:53:47,545 --> 00:53:50,343
This time, when you shoot,
shoot to kill.

763
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:24,001
Alexis!

764
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:28,341
Over here!

765
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:31,914
Camford!

766
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:33,612
For crying out loud!

767
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:35,977
What are you doing
up here?

768
00:54:37,221 --> 00:54:38,984
They said
you'd gone to Heraklion.

769
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:40,490
Listen, Alexis...

770
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:42,584
are you my friend?

771
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:45,493
Nay, nay, but what are
you doing up here?

772
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:47,928
Can you keep a secret?

773
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:52,701
Go back to the inn and
see if Nikky and her aunt...

774
00:54:52,735 --> 00:54:54,760
have caught the afternoon bus
to Aghios Nikolaos.

775
00:54:54,804 --> 00:54:56,704
I want to be sure
they've caught that bus...

776
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:59,003
you understand?

777
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:00,736
But what's up?

778
00:55:00,776 --> 00:55:03,039
You and uncle Stratos
make pretty big stink, eh?

779
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:04,807
You bring me news
about Nikky.

780
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:05,846
Quick, like a mouse.

781
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,508
Then you're still
my friend?

782
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,778
I think
pretty lousy thing...

783
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:10,827
when you go
and no good-bye.

784
00:55:10,851 --> 00:55:12,512
Of course we're friends...
the best.

785
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:13,747
Now off you go.

786
00:55:13,787 --> 00:55:15,516
I bring you word.

787
00:55:45,915 --> 00:55:46,915
Aah!

788
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:53,080
NIKKY: Aah!

789
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:04,321
Hello!

790
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:05,442
ALEXIS:
Did somebody scream?

791
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:06,592
Alexis?!

792
00:56:08,836 --> 00:56:10,962
It's Nikky!

793
00:56:11,004 --> 00:56:12,130
Help!

794
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:14,800
For crying out loud,
what you doing in there?

795
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:17,401
Get me out of here,
Alexis!

796
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:20,810
I'll get Mr. Camford!
We get you out all right!

797
00:56:25,651 --> 00:56:27,118
Has my niece come back?

798
00:56:27,153 --> 00:56:28,517
- No.
- Then it's true.

799
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:30,077
She must've
had an accident.

800
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:31,532
Perhaps she went
walking in the hills.

801
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:32,716
She's been gone all day!

802
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:34,725
Don't you understand?

803
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:35,919
Anything
may have happened.

804
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,895
She may be lying
out there somewhere hurt.

805
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,234
Did you find her?

806
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,702
She has not returned?

807
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,863
I'm terribly worried.

808
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,635
I want you please
to call the police at once.

809
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:52,902
The police?

810
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,774
My niece may be lost,
kidnapped, anything.

811
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:58,109
Calm down.
Calm down, gðo Ferris.

812
00:56:58,146 --> 00:56:59,909
We will look for her.

813
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:02,075
The best thing for you
to do is go upstairs...

814
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:03,174
and get some rest.

815
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:05,117
Rest? I can't rest!

816
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:07,120
I've walked
up and down that beach...

817
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:08,678
until I thought I'd go mad.

818
00:57:08,722 --> 00:57:10,519
Just a minute.

819
00:57:21,867 --> 00:57:22,891
There. You see?

820
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:24,402
We will search
for her...

821
00:57:24,436 --> 00:57:25,664
all of us.

822
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:28,571
Along the shore,
in the hills.

823
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:29,732
I am quite sure...

824
00:57:29,774 --> 00:57:32,106
that we will find her
before long.

825
00:57:32,143 --> 00:57:33,201
Thank you.

826
00:57:34,212 --> 00:57:36,009
I will go get my coat.

827
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:39,871
I'm going back
along the beach...

828
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,383
to look for her.

829
00:57:41,418 --> 00:57:42,646
If she's found...

830
00:57:42,686 --> 00:57:45,018
please send someone
after me.

831
00:58:04,705 --> 00:58:05,763
Stratos.

832
00:58:07,808 --> 00:58:09,867
I want to know
where that girl is...

833
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,138
and I want to know now.

834
00:58:11,178 --> 00:58:12,542
How should I know
where she is?

835
00:58:12,578 --> 00:58:14,205
I'm not her nurse.

836
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:15,680
I warn you, Stratos.

837
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:17,114
I will stand no more
from you.

838
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:19,243
No more threats,
no more lies.

839
00:58:19,285 --> 00:58:20,309
After tomorrow night...

840
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:21,683
you'll never
see me again.

841
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,188
If you have harmed that girl
or Mr. Camford...

842
00:58:24,222 --> 00:58:26,156
I won't rest until
you have paid for it.

843
00:58:26,191 --> 00:58:29,490
We've been poor people,
simple people...

844
00:58:29,528 --> 00:58:30,926
but we have been decent.

845
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:33,259
I want my son
to grow up decent.

846
00:58:33,297 --> 00:58:35,197
How long would your
decency have kept you

847
00:58:35,232 --> 00:58:36,343
if I hadn't sent you
money from England...

848
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:37,391
all these years?

849
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:38,866
Enough to buy
this house...

850
00:58:38,902 --> 00:58:40,335
enough to start
this inn.

851
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,598
Better to have nothing...

852
00:58:41,638 --> 00:58:44,300
better to starve
and have some self-respect.

853
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:51,475
It was my money,
not your self-respect...

854
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:53,378
that kept
you and your brat...

855
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:56,645
and the whole family
15 years.

856
00:58:56,684 --> 00:58:59,209
You send us money
you worked for honestly?

857
00:58:59,253 --> 00:59:02,450
What do you know about me?

858
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,788
What I've worked for,
planned for, fought for?

859
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:06,985
Nothing.

860
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:08,995
Tell me where she is,
Stratos.

861
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:11,827
In God's name, tell me.

862
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:17,096
Get out of my way, Sophia.

863
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,604
Either you tell me,
or I'll go to the priest.

864
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:21,572
I'll tell the whole village.

865
00:59:21,607 --> 00:59:23,267
I'll tell them
that my brother Stratos...

866
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:24,741
is a criminal.

867
00:59:24,776 --> 00:59:28,007
No, you won't, Sophia.
You won't say a word.

868
00:59:28,046 --> 00:59:30,605
You knowwhy?

869
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:32,444
You love your son.

870
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:34,746
You wouldn't want anything
to happen to him, would you?

871
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:41,486
Even you... would not do that.

872
00:59:41,524 --> 00:59:43,651
Oh, yes, Sophia.

873
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:45,718
Even I would do just that.

874
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:49,693
Now get out of the way.

875
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,509
Door locked!

876
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:12,711
Never been locked before.

877
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:13,810
All right, all right!

878
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:22,350
That looks like
the only way in.

879
01:00:22,374 --> 01:00:23,613
That looks like
the only way in.

880
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:28,389
MARK:
What are you doing?

881
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,790
It's game we play.

882
01:00:33,803 --> 01:00:34,803
Be careful!

883
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,507
I do many times.

884
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:41,168
I best on
Aghios Georgios.

885
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:02,060
Alexis!

886
01:01:03,563 --> 01:01:05,758
I get too old to play
this lousy game.

887
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:06,991
Alexis!

888
01:01:07,032 --> 01:01:09,000
Alexis!

889
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:10,126
Is she all right?

890
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,929
Nikky all right!

891
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,073
How'd you get in here?

892
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:19,303
Quickly.
Please, quickly...

893
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,004
before that horrible man
gets back.

894
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22,239
What man?

895
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,543
Stratos... he's coming back.
Hurry!

896
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:27,277
Don't worry.
We get you free.

897
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,476
Break, will you?

898
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:33,779
There.

899
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:34,822
Oh.

900
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:38,419
Uhh. Oh.

901
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,087
Oh, Alexis.

902
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:41,595
No time make love.

903
01:01:41,629 --> 01:01:43,290
You get out. Quick.

904
01:01:48,636 --> 01:01:51,627
Not to steps.
This way. Quick!

905
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:55,770
Steady!

906
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:01,269
I can't look down.

907
01:02:07,052 --> 01:02:10,021
I can't!
I can't do it!

908
01:02:10,055 --> 01:02:11,079
Listen to me.

909
01:02:11,122 --> 01:02:12,953
You not fall
if you don't be stupid girl.

910
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,425
Watch me.
I show you how.

911
01:02:32,775 --> 01:02:33,774
You OK?

912
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:34,833
V ery good show.

913
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,876
Come on.

914
01:02:39,748 --> 01:02:41,215
She too much afraid.

915
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:42,272
I don't know.

916
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,446
Don't look down!

917
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:48,781
Watch the sails!

918
01:02:54,294 --> 01:02:56,854
Jump when the next one
reaches you!

919
01:03:05,938 --> 01:03:07,700
Aah!

920
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,676
I watch for Uncle Stratos.

921
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,092
Stay there.

922
01:03:33,129 --> 01:03:34,128
I'm coming up.

923
01:03:39,868 --> 01:03:41,062
Unh.

924
01:03:50,711 --> 01:03:52,610
No!

925
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:55,478
Mark, stay there!
I'll jump!

926
01:04:36,217 --> 01:04:37,616
Slide now!

927
01:04:41,422 --> 01:04:43,219
Aah!

928
01:04:45,725 --> 01:04:47,989
Aah!

929
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:50,521
Aah!

930
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:00,303
That's it.

931
01:05:00,339 --> 01:05:01,338
Come on,
you're all right.

932
01:05:01,372 --> 01:05:03,067
Go! No time make love!

933
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,302
Now Uncle Stratos coming!

934
01:05:04,342 --> 01:05:05,468
No!

935
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,587
Take her other hand,
Alexis.

936
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:07,805
No. I go back to village.

937
01:05:07,846 --> 01:05:09,190
You must come with us.
If your uncle finds out...

938
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:10,457
He won't find me.
I hide so good...

939
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:12,039
even devil
don't find me. Go!

940
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:13,413
We'll be
in Aghios Nikolaos.

941
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:01,953
Oh, come on.

942
01:06:01,993 --> 01:06:03,119
Oh!

943
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:04,219
Just let me
rest a minute.

944
01:06:04,262 --> 01:06:05,388
Not here!

945
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:06,396
Just let me
get my breath.

946
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,727
You're right out
in the open.

947
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:08,976
Aunt Fran will be
looking for me.

948
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
She'll be hysterical.

949
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:11,310
You'll be safe
in Aghios Nikolaos...

950
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,345
and that's where
you're going.

951
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:14,098
Don't you tell me
where I'm going!

952
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,105
I've been through enough
today because of you.

953
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,766
I want my aunt,
and I want the police...

954
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,351
and I want that monster
Stratos arrested!

955
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,206
This is no time
to start making a scene.

956
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,403
You're coming with me.

957
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,171
Oh! Oh, Mark, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

958
01:06:28,216 --> 01:06:31,379
All right,
you've had your say.

959
01:06:31,419 --> 01:06:32,613
Nowwill you
come with me?

960
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:34,121
I'm sorry.
Honestly, I didn't...

961
01:06:34,155 --> 01:06:35,299
It's all right.
It's all right.

962
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:36,619
I know, I know...

963
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:38,090
but we can't stay here.

964
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:39,752
All right?

965
01:06:40,861 --> 01:06:41,861
Mm-hmm.

966
01:06:43,197 --> 01:06:44,197
Now come on.

967
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,501
Mark, at least
you could tell me why...

968
01:06:50,536 --> 01:06:52,231
Stratos tried to kill you.

969
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:53,760
Why is he
trying to kill me?

970
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:54,805
I'll tell you later.

971
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:57,501
You keep saying
you'll tell me later.

972
01:06:57,542 --> 01:06:59,510
I've been shut up
in that horrible windmill...

973
01:06:59,544 --> 01:07:00,909
almost murdered...

974
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:02,412
and now
we're running away.

975
01:07:02,446 --> 01:07:03,606
Well, I don't knowwhere

976
01:07:03,647 --> 01:07:05,205
or why or what's happening
or anything.

977
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:06,773
If you waste any more
time jabbering...

978
01:07:06,817 --> 01:07:08,614
you won't live
long enough to find out.

979
01:07:08,652 --> 01:07:09,619
Oh, I'm going back!

980
01:07:09,653 --> 01:07:11,279
Listen! Don't you understand?

981
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:12,948
Stratos is a desperate man.

982
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:14,923
He's got everything
at stake.

983
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:16,516
Now, you've stumbled
into this mess...

984
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,239
and I'm doing my best
to get you out of it.

985
01:07:19,495 --> 01:07:21,485
Well, l...

986
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:23,327
I don't see why...

987
01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:25,009
I should go running
all over Crete with you.

988
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:26,466
I don't even know
who you are!

989
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,979
I'm a master criminal
wanted all over Europe.

990
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,128
V ery funny.

991
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,865
I will tell you
in Aghios Nikolaos.

992
01:07:30,905 --> 01:07:32,395
One thing I do know...

993
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,169
your manners
are as bad as Stratos'.

994
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:35,300
V ery well, gðice Ferris.

995
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,003
Stay here.
Call a policeman.

996
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:39,773
I'm sure he'll offer you
better protection than I can.

997
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:53,781
Turn around!

998
01:07:53,826 --> 01:07:54,951
Mark, wait!

999
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:18,112
I think I've killed him.

1000
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:26,520
No, he's all...
he's all right.

1001
01:08:26,554 --> 01:08:28,784
He's, uh,
he's all right.

1002
01:08:28,823 --> 01:08:30,449
He's just out cold.

1003
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:32,823
But I heard
his head crack.

1004
01:08:33,827 --> 01:08:35,988
Yeah. Good one, Nikky.

1005
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:38,888
Oh, Mark.

1006
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:40,922
Ooh. Aah.

1007
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:48,163
Your shoulder...
it's bleeding again.

1008
01:08:48,206 --> 01:08:50,436
Nikky.

1009
01:08:50,475 --> 01:08:51,533
Do you...

1010
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:55,869
do you think you can
possibly go on alone?

1011
01:08:57,281 --> 01:08:59,749
No! Don't be silly!

1012
01:08:59,784 --> 01:09:01,775
We must stay together.

1013
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:03,377
I honestly don't...

1014
01:09:03,421 --> 01:09:05,581
I honestly don't think
I can make it.

1015
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:10,822
Yes, of course you can.

1016
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,690
Come on.

1017
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:13,728
We must go.

1018
01:09:13,762 --> 01:09:15,423
OK.

1019
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:17,193
I'll take that.

1020
01:09:17,232 --> 01:09:19,462
Unh. We'll find
somewhere along the way...

1021
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:21,331
and then you can rest,
all right?

1022
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:22,427
OK.

1023
01:09:32,112 --> 01:09:34,580
What is this place?

1024
01:09:34,614 --> 01:09:36,343
The temple of Apollo.

1025
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,146
The locals say it's haunted.

1026
01:09:39,118 --> 01:09:40,949
Well, we can rest here.

1027
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:43,955
Over there.

1028
01:09:43,989 --> 01:09:44,989
Yeah.

1029
01:09:58,969 --> 01:10:00,732
Mark, it is creepy.

1030
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:03,137
That's all the better.
We can hide and rest.

1031
01:10:09,245 --> 01:10:10,974
It's all right.
It's only cats.

1032
01:10:13,615 --> 01:10:15,310
That's the most
bloodcurdling sound.

1033
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,079
Cats are bad luck on Crete.

1034
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:34,760
Wonder who she is.

1035
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:38,300
The young lady that
ran back to Stratos...

1036
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:39,736
and lost her head.

1037
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:46,744
Mark?

1038
01:10:48,913 --> 01:10:50,039
Mmm.

1039
01:10:55,787 --> 01:10:58,482
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've caused you.

1040
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,752
No, no, no.

1041
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,723
I think in view of all
the trouble you've caused...

1042
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,694
it's about time I told you
the whole story.

1043
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,226
No, not now.
Tell me tomorrow.

1044
01:11:17,305 --> 01:11:19,466
I want to tell you now.

1045
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:25,440
Um...

1046
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:26,969
well, it's...

1047
01:11:27,014 --> 01:11:29,209
have you ever heard of
the Countess of Fleet?

1048
01:11:30,317 --> 01:11:31,409
Yes.

1049
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,814
Wasn't she the woman...

1050
01:11:34,854 --> 01:11:37,482
who lost those fabulous
jewels in a robbery?

1051
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:39,286
Some man
who worked in the bank...

1052
01:11:39,325 --> 01:11:40,791
was accused...
he was accused...

1053
01:11:40,826 --> 01:11:42,157
Yes, that was me.

1054
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:44,419
Mark, did you steal...

1055
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:46,363
No, of course I didn't.

1056
01:11:46,398 --> 01:11:47,365
Who did?

1057
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:49,093
Stratos, I think.

1058
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:52,692
How... how on earth
did you get mixed up in that?

1059
01:11:52,736 --> 01:11:54,567
Oh, it's all so...

1060
01:11:56,307 --> 01:11:58,171
the Countess kept all
her jewels at the bank...

1061
01:11:58,208 --> 01:11:59,300
where I occupied...

1062
01:11:59,342 --> 01:12:02,505
what is known as
a position of trust.

1063
01:12:02,545 --> 01:12:04,356
Sometimes, she'd ask me
to bring them to her...

1064
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,711
when she wanted
to wear them.

1065
01:12:05,748 --> 01:12:08,079
Well, on this
particular occasion...

1066
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:10,983
instead of waiting
for the guard...

1067
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:12,418
you know,
the security man...

1068
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,046
Mm-hmm.

1069
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:15,953
I took the jewels
from the safe...

1070
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,753
and jumped into a taxi...

1071
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,727
and took them straight
around to Fleet House.

1072
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:21,989
What happened?

1073
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:23,087
Well, one moment...

1074
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,154
I was standing on the doorstep
with the jewels...

1075
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:27,632
the next moment,
I came to without the jewels...

1076
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,498
and a lump the size
of a golf ball...

1077
01:12:29,536 --> 01:12:30,730
on the back of my head.

1078
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:32,566
Stratos?

1079
01:12:32,605 --> 01:12:34,402
I never got a chance
to see his face.

1080
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,634
I was hit from behind.

1081
01:12:37,109 --> 01:12:38,576
Oh, I see.

1082
01:12:41,045 --> 01:12:43,104
How awful.

1083
01:12:43,147 --> 01:12:45,479
Oh, how awful.

1084
01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:54,813
But why didn't you take
the guard with you?

1085
01:12:54,858 --> 01:12:56,485
I was in a rush
that night.

1086
01:12:56,527 --> 01:12:58,858
Why?

1087
01:12:58,895 --> 01:13:00,760
Oh, it's...

1088
01:13:00,796 --> 01:13:02,821
oh, the most idiotic
of all reasons.

1089
01:13:02,865 --> 01:13:04,856
I had a date.

1090
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:05,901
Oh.

1091
01:13:09,905 --> 01:13:11,998
But...

1092
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,270
but how did Stratos
know you were coming?

1093
01:13:14,309 --> 01:13:16,173
Well, that's what everybody
wanted to know...

1094
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:19,145
the police,
the bank, the papers...

1095
01:13:19,179 --> 01:13:21,113
even my doting family.

1096
01:13:21,148 --> 01:13:23,639
I think one of the Fleet
servants tipped him off.

1097
01:13:23,684 --> 01:13:25,617
But I suppose
they thought you did.

1098
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:29,918
I was dismissed, disbarred,
and generally disgraced.

1099
01:13:29,956 --> 01:13:32,447
Oh, Mark,
how dreadful for you...

1100
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,118
and how unfair.

1101
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,525
Oh, yes. Well...

1102
01:13:51,141 --> 01:13:53,336
We'd better find somewhere
with some more cover.

1103
01:14:13,094 --> 01:14:16,461
But how on earth did you
trace Stratos here?

1104
01:14:16,497 --> 01:14:19,761
Well, a fence
was arrested in London.

1105
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,564
Just a routine affair.

1106
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:24,280
The police found one
of the Fleet earrings...

1107
01:14:24,304 --> 01:14:25,463
among his loot.

1108
01:14:26,839 --> 01:14:28,670
Now, this man lived
over a Greek restaurant...

1109
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,539
in Soho called
the Moon-Spinners.

1110
01:14:30,576 --> 01:14:31,543
The Moon-Spinners?

1111
01:14:31,577 --> 01:14:32,544
Now, wait a minute.

1112
01:14:32,578 --> 01:14:34,977
By hanging around,
I discovered that the owner...

1113
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:36,605
had lately sold off
and vanished.

1114
01:14:36,648 --> 01:14:39,242
He was a Cretan,
a man called Stratos.

1115
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:42,382
That was a pretty
long shot, wasn't it?

1116
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,477
Well, it paid off.

1117
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,487
I found Aghios Georgios...

1118
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,455
another inn called
the Moon-Spinners...

1119
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,321
and another Cretan
called Stratos.

1120
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:51,294
But you don't even know
if he's got the jewels, do you?

1121
01:14:51,327 --> 01:14:52,838
Well, I'm pretty certain
after last night...

1122
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:53,829
aren't you?

1123
01:14:53,863 --> 01:14:56,491
He might've left them
in London.

1124
01:14:56,532 --> 01:14:57,999
Not a chance.

1125
01:14:58,034 --> 01:14:59,558
At the inn?

1126
01:14:59,602 --> 01:15:00,727
Warm.

1127
01:15:00,769 --> 01:15:01,861
The church.

1128
01:15:01,903 --> 01:15:03,131
Warmer.

1129
01:15:04,306 --> 01:15:06,240
I know!
The Bay of Dolphins!

1130
01:15:07,476 --> 01:15:08,752
That's why he was
so determined...

1131
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:09,936
you weren't to go there!

1132
01:15:09,977 --> 01:15:11,740
It's got to be.
It's the only place.

1133
01:15:12,546 --> 01:15:14,673
You mean he's
buried them in the sea?

1134
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:16,945
Well, he's always out there
scouting around in his boat.

1135
01:15:16,984 --> 01:15:19,474
Mark, if you're sure,
why don't you...

1136
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:20,884
- Call the police?
- Yes!

1137
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,650
Because I have no proof,
no proof of anything!

1138
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,556
No way of connecting him
with the robbery at all...

1139
01:15:26,592 --> 01:15:29,152
except that he tried
to kill me last night.

1140
01:15:29,194 --> 01:15:30,905
And I suppose he locked you
up in the windmill...

1141
01:15:30,929 --> 01:15:32,073
because he thought
I might've told you...

1142
01:15:32,097 --> 01:15:33,530
the whole story.

1143
01:15:36,334 --> 01:15:37,460
Was she pretty?

1144
01:15:37,502 --> 01:15:38,469
Hmm?

1145
01:15:38,503 --> 01:15:39,663
Who?

1146
01:15:39,704 --> 01:15:42,537
The girl you had a date with.

1147
01:15:42,573 --> 01:15:44,506
The girl...

1148
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:47,009
The girl that night.

1149
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:48,705
Oh, her.

1150
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:50,610
I don't remember.

1151
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:51,739
That blow on the head...

1152
01:15:51,782 --> 01:15:54,113
must've knocked her
clean out of my mind.

1153
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,845
You believe me,
don't you?

1154
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,443
About the girl?

1155
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,886
No. About me.

1156
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:03,379
I'll tell you
in Aghios Nikolaos.

1157
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:05,821
Now, try to sleep.

1158
01:16:07,495 --> 01:16:08,894
I'll get the gun.

1159
01:16:23,476 --> 01:16:26,240
Here, you can use
my shoulder if you like.

1160
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:27,588
I think it's a bit
more comfortable...

1161
01:16:27,612 --> 01:16:29,375
than the ruins
of ancient Crete.

1162
01:16:36,253 --> 01:16:37,185
Better?

1163
01:16:37,221 --> 01:16:39,212
Mmm.

1164
01:16:39,256 --> 01:16:40,467
It's the most
comfortable shoulder...

1165
01:16:40,491 --> 01:16:42,083
I've ever slept on.

1166
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,545
It's all right.

1167
01:18:22,014 --> 01:18:24,209
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

1168
01:18:24,249 --> 01:18:25,511
Hansel and Gretel?

1169
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:26,643
Who are you?

1170
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:28,743
N-now, don't wave
that firearm at me...

1171
01:18:28,786 --> 01:18:29,786
young lady.

1172
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:31,846
I'm the British Consul
at Heraklion.

1173
01:18:33,324 --> 01:18:34,291
Good morning.

1174
01:18:34,325 --> 01:18:35,292
May I ask...

1175
01:18:35,326 --> 01:18:36,384
what you're
doing out here?

1176
01:18:36,427 --> 01:18:38,451
You're hikers,
I suppose.

1177
01:18:39,763 --> 01:18:41,390
No. Well, not exactly.

1178
01:18:41,431 --> 01:18:44,161
Yes, but why the rifle?
Are you in trouble?

1179
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:45,201
Yes, we are.

1180
01:18:45,235 --> 01:18:47,327
There's this terrible
man... this criminal.

1181
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:49,837
Actually... actually,
there was, um...

1182
01:18:49,872 --> 01:18:53,535
a wedding at the village,
and, uh...

1183
01:18:53,576 --> 01:18:55,236
uh, some of the locals
got a bit drunk...

1184
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:57,369
and, uh, started a fight.

1185
01:18:57,412 --> 01:18:58,879
But, Mark...

1186
01:18:58,913 --> 01:19:00,124
Things began
to look dangerous...

1187
01:19:00,148 --> 01:19:02,378
so we thought
we'd better clear out.

1188
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:04,384
V ery wise, but what
are you going to do?

1189
01:19:04,418 --> 01:19:05,995
I mean to say you're
miles from anywhere.

1190
01:19:06,019 --> 01:19:07,680
Mmm.

1191
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:11,623
I wanted to get Miss Ferris
to Aghios Nikolaos.

1192
01:19:11,658 --> 01:19:12,768
Well, why don't I drive you?

1193
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,384
I've got
my summer villa there.

1194
01:19:14,427 --> 01:19:17,794
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Mark, that's lucky.

1195
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:19,798
My name's Anthony
Charles Scott Gamble.

1196
01:19:19,832 --> 01:19:20,957
It's always a pleasure...

1197
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:22,899
to help her majesty's
subjects in distress.

1198
01:19:22,934 --> 01:19:24,458
How do you do?

1199
01:19:24,502 --> 01:19:25,935
Look...

1200
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:27,666
why don't you go along
with Mr. Gamble...

1201
01:19:27,706 --> 01:19:28,832
and I'll see if I can...

1202
01:19:28,874 --> 01:19:30,306
get in touch
with your aunt?

1203
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:32,138
I'm not going
with anyone...

1204
01:19:32,176 --> 01:19:33,320
and you've got
to get a doctor...

1205
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:35,073
- to see to your shoulder.
- Shh.

1206
01:19:35,112 --> 01:19:37,239
He was shot
in the shoulder.

1207
01:19:37,281 --> 01:19:38,247
Shot?

1208
01:19:38,281 --> 01:19:39,339
My goodness.

1209
01:19:39,382 --> 01:19:41,247
Yes, you have been
having adventures.

1210
01:19:41,284 --> 01:19:42,251
Well, it so happens...

1211
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:43,809
my wife's
a qualified nurse.

1212
01:19:43,853 --> 01:19:45,252
She'll be happy
to attend to you.

1213
01:19:45,288 --> 01:19:47,050
Oh, that's marvelous!

1214
01:19:48,156 --> 01:19:50,886
Please, Mark.
Otherwise, I won't go.

1215
01:19:50,926 --> 01:19:52,223
All right.

1216
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:55,796
Mr. Gamble?

1217
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:56,797
Hmm?

1218
01:19:56,831 --> 01:19:57,798
What are you doing
out here...

1219
01:19:57,832 --> 01:19:59,094
so early in the morning?

1220
01:19:59,133 --> 01:20:01,101
Well, I'm an amateur
archaeologist.

1221
01:20:01,135 --> 01:20:03,433
I often come out here
to putter among the ruins.

1222
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:06,462
I have a nose for making
singular discoveries.

1223
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:10,209
What?

1224
01:20:10,243 --> 01:20:11,972
Why don't you tell him
about Stratos?

1225
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:12,978
No!

1226
01:20:13,012 --> 01:20:14,377
But he's the Consul.

1227
01:20:14,413 --> 01:20:15,880
Not yet.

1228
01:20:20,886 --> 01:20:23,353
Don't you think we might
dispense with the rifle?

1229
01:20:23,388 --> 01:20:25,515
Guns before breakfast
are so uncivilized...

1230
01:20:25,556 --> 01:20:27,046
don't you think?

1231
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:46,299
Come on in and
make yourselves at home.

1232
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,639
My wife should be
around somewhere.

1233
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,167
Whew. Hot out there.

1234
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:51,303
Cynthia!

1235
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:52,813
Cynthia... oh.

1236
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:54,974
My dear, I came across
two compatriots...

1237
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,277
down at the ruins.

1238
01:20:56,317 --> 01:20:58,251
Miss Ferris
and, uh, mister...

1239
01:20:58,285 --> 01:20:59,285
Camford.
Mr. Camford.

1240
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,287
How do you do?

1241
01:21:00,321 --> 01:21:01,998
They ran into some trouble
with the natives.

1242
01:21:02,022 --> 01:21:03,649
Mr. Camford's
hurt his shoulder.

1243
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:05,157
Oh, my dear, how dreadful.

1244
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:06,385
You both look worn out.

1245
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:07,825
I hope we can
take care of them...

1246
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,171
until their affairs
are set in order.

1247
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:10,662
Yes, of course.
I'd be delighted.

1248
01:21:10,697 --> 01:21:12,041
If I could look
at your shoulder...

1249
01:21:12,065 --> 01:21:13,327
perhaps I can
be of help.

1250
01:21:13,366 --> 01:21:14,662
- Oh...
- Oh, well...

1251
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,167
It's all right.

1252
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:17,498
You need have no fear...

1253
01:21:17,536 --> 01:21:19,197
at handing yourself
over to cynthia.

1254
01:21:19,237 --> 01:21:21,364
She was known as
the Angel of Eastbourne...

1255
01:21:21,406 --> 01:21:22,667
during the war.

1256
01:21:22,707 --> 01:21:23,674
Oh, Tony, don't be absurd.

1257
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,005
Would you like
to go along up?

1258
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:26,009
Thank you very much.

1259
01:21:26,043 --> 01:21:27,010
I'll send the car...

1260
01:21:27,044 --> 01:21:28,841
to Aghios Georgios
for your aunt.

1261
01:21:28,879 --> 01:21:30,039
I'll see you later.

1262
01:21:48,663 --> 01:21:50,290
Why are you still here?

1263
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:51,798
I told you to go home.

1264
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:53,460
Where did you find them?

1265
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:55,765
Peacefully sleeping
at the ruins.

1266
01:21:58,338 --> 01:22:00,636
A fine mess
you've made of things.

1267
01:22:00,674 --> 01:22:01,800
If you'd had your way...

1268
01:22:01,842 --> 01:22:03,319
this entire enterprise
would have ended...

1269
01:22:03,343 --> 01:22:04,821
with bodies strewn
all over the island...

1270
01:22:04,845 --> 01:22:06,744
like the last act
of King Lear.

1271
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:08,804
Was it my fault...

1272
01:22:08,848 --> 01:22:11,146
he turned up
at Aghios Georgios?

1273
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:13,310
I did everything I could
to get rid of him.

1274
01:22:13,352 --> 01:22:14,978
As for that girl
and her aunt...

1275
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,146
Did you seriously imagine...

1276
01:22:16,187 --> 01:22:17,665
you could dispose
of two british subjects...

1277
01:22:17,689 --> 01:22:19,000
as though they were
sacks of potatoes...

1278
01:22:19,024 --> 01:22:20,821
without anybody
starting an inquiry?

1279
01:22:20,859 --> 01:22:24,259
You've endangered us all
by your senseless bungling.

1280
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:28,658
Now that you've
got them here...

1281
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:30,496
what are you going
to do with them?

1282
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:33,331
I shall take care of them
with efficiency and dispatch...

1283
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:35,496
two qualities which you seem
to be sadly lacking.

1284
01:22:35,538 --> 01:22:37,768
You listen to me,
you chattering old maid.

1285
01:22:37,807 --> 01:22:40,105
I want to know
what you're going to do.

1286
01:22:40,143 --> 01:22:42,110
It's not your concern anymore.

1287
01:22:42,144 --> 01:22:44,288
Go back to your village and
concentrate on carrying out...

1288
01:22:44,312 --> 01:22:46,280
your part of the bargain
tonight.

1289
01:22:46,314 --> 01:22:48,942
If it hadn't been
for your grotesque addiction...

1290
01:22:48,984 --> 01:22:50,109
to astrology...

1291
01:22:50,151 --> 01:22:52,029
I could have handled
the whole deal from here...

1292
01:22:52,053 --> 01:22:53,350
without involving
anyone else.

1293
01:22:53,387 --> 01:22:55,617
My chart has not lied.

1294
01:22:55,656 --> 01:22:57,782
From the beginning,
it has not lied.

1295
01:22:57,824 --> 01:22:59,792
You sit here
reading your letters...

1296
01:22:59,826 --> 01:23:01,293
making contacts...

1297
01:23:01,327 --> 01:23:03,192
collecting
your fat commissions.

1298
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:06,127
I did the whole thing...

1299
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:08,633
from the beginning,
I alone.

1300
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:10,635
It was your chart,
I suppose...

1301
01:23:10,669 --> 01:23:12,136
that produced Madame Habib.

1302
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:15,768
Well, you just
remember this...

1303
01:23:15,807 --> 01:23:17,468
if either of those two
get away...

1304
01:23:17,508 --> 01:23:19,135
it means
the finish of you...

1305
01:23:19,177 --> 01:23:20,974
and your whole
cozy setup.

1306
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:23,674
You'll be sorry
you did not stay at home...

1307
01:23:23,714 --> 01:23:25,704
and stick to your knitting.

1308
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:27,979
I don't knit.

1309
01:23:28,018 --> 01:23:30,953
It so happens I do
extremely fine petit point.

1310
01:23:33,022 --> 01:23:35,320
Not that way.

1311
01:23:36,025 --> 01:23:37,253
Through the garden.

1312
01:23:42,363 --> 01:23:43,921
Savage.

1313
01:23:48,303 --> 01:23:50,793
Mmm. Come in.

1314
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:56,939
Hello.
Are you feeling better?

1315
01:23:56,977 --> 01:23:58,205
Mmm.

1316
01:23:58,245 --> 01:24:00,735
Are you enjoying
your breakfast?

1317
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:03,772
I never thought raspberry jam
could taste so good.

1318
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:07,952
Well, I brought you
something fresh to put on...

1319
01:24:07,986 --> 01:24:10,284
until your aunt arrives
with your things.

1320
01:24:10,322 --> 01:24:11,550
NIKKY:
Oh, thank you.

1321
01:24:13,892 --> 01:24:16,792
My dear, I wanted
to talk to you.

1322
01:24:16,827 --> 01:24:19,489
I'm worried
about Mr. Camford.

1323
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,794
Oh, why? What happened?

1324
01:24:21,832 --> 01:24:23,800
Well, I've given him
penicillin...

1325
01:24:23,834 --> 01:24:26,199
but he really needs
professional care.

1326
01:24:26,236 --> 01:24:27,965
How bad is he?

1327
01:24:28,004 --> 01:24:30,472
I don't want
to alarm you, my dear...

1328
01:24:30,507 --> 01:24:32,975
but I think his arm
may become infected.

1329
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:35,169
I don't know
if I caught it in time.

1330
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,337
Oh, no.

1331
01:24:38,514 --> 01:24:42,074
How awful. We must
get him to a hospital.

1332
01:24:42,116 --> 01:24:45,244
Well, there is a wonderful
British hospital...

1333
01:24:45,286 --> 01:24:46,753
in Athens.

1334
01:24:46,787 --> 01:24:50,245
Athens? But could we
get him there in time?

1335
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:52,258
I mean, if his arm's
really bad, it might...

1336
01:24:52,292 --> 01:24:55,853
Now, don't let's
anticipate disaster.

1337
01:24:56,997 --> 01:24:59,329
Why don't I
talk to Anthony?

1338
01:24:59,365 --> 01:25:00,764
He's so wise...

1339
01:25:00,799 --> 01:25:03,734
and he has such influence
with the local authorities.

1340
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:05,760
Well, if you think so.

1341
01:25:05,804 --> 01:25:06,930
But l...

1342
01:25:06,972 --> 01:25:08,438
Oh, you poor dear.

1343
01:25:08,473 --> 01:25:11,340
You have had
the most dreadful time.

1344
01:25:11,376 --> 01:25:12,775
But don't worry.

1345
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,607
Anthony will take charge.

1346
01:25:14,646 --> 01:25:16,943
Anthony always takes charge.

1347
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,210
You can trust him completely.

1348
01:25:19,249 --> 01:25:21,615
Now, you're not
to worry about a thing.

1349
01:25:21,652 --> 01:25:22,949
Everything
will be all right.

1350
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:26,283
Can I go and see Mark
now, then?

1351
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:27,949
Oh, I wouldn't
if I were you.

1352
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:28,957
He's sleeping.

1353
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:30,083
Oh.

1354
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:35,054
Are you, by any chance,
related to Lady Ferris...

1355
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,688
of Pentwithwith Castle?

1356
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,631
Not that I know of.

1357
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,635
Such a dear person.

1358
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:43,296
Her daughter married
a second cousin of mine.

1359
01:25:43,337 --> 01:25:45,703
Reginald Busby-Pelham.

1360
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:47,070
Really?

1361
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:48,938
Yes.

1362
01:25:48,976 --> 01:25:50,967
I'm so frightfully
out of touch...

1363
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:52,807
with everyone here.

1364
01:25:52,845 --> 01:25:55,245
There isn't even
an English club.

1365
01:25:55,281 --> 01:25:56,475
Tch. Ohh.

1366
01:25:59,085 --> 01:26:01,814
Reginald Busby-Pelham?

1367
01:26:03,188 --> 01:26:06,316
Of Pentwithwithwith... with.

1368
01:26:06,358 --> 01:26:07,985
Oh, crikey.

1369
01:26:16,033 --> 01:26:18,330
Ah, there you are, my dear.

1370
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,494
How's Mr. Camford?

1371
01:26:19,536 --> 01:26:22,004
I just looked in.
He's still sleeping.

1372
01:26:22,038 --> 01:26:23,164
Oh, dear. Poor chap.

1373
01:26:23,206 --> 01:26:26,004
Oh, what a beautiful yacht.

1374
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:27,338
Yes, isn't it?

1375
01:26:27,376 --> 01:26:29,241
Um, shall we go in?

1376
01:26:30,212 --> 01:26:31,179
Yeah.

1377
01:26:31,213 --> 01:26:32,942
Lunch ought to be ready
by now.

1378
01:26:32,982 --> 01:26:34,244
Now, this way.

1379
01:26:34,283 --> 01:26:37,843
I'm sure it was a wise
decision to go to Athens.

1380
01:26:37,885 --> 01:26:40,615
I've arranged for a plane
to pick you up at Heraklia.

1381
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:42,782
Mr. Camford should be safe
in the British hospital...

1382
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:44,290
in not more than three hours.

1383
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,791
Oh, that is a relief.

1384
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,794
I'll wire them
to reserve a room.

1385
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,295
There we are.

1386
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:50,796
Unfortunately, you've chosen...

1387
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,297
the worst day
of the whole year...

1388
01:26:52,331 --> 01:26:53,457
to leave here.

1389
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:55,296
Tonight is the feast
of King Minos...

1390
01:26:55,334 --> 01:26:56,631
our local carnival...

1391
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:58,296
and the whole place
goes mad.

1392
01:26:58,337 --> 01:26:59,815
So the sooner you leave
for the airport...

1393
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:00,965
the better.

1394
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:02,940
How can I ever thank you
and your wife enough?

1395
01:27:02,974 --> 01:27:04,635
Well, it was
a stroke of luck...

1396
01:27:04,676 --> 01:27:07,144
that Cynthia was able
to look Mr. Camford over.

1397
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:09,476
You can always trust
Cynthia completely.

1398
01:27:14,218 --> 01:27:17,881
Hello, my dear.
We just sat down.

1399
01:27:19,856 --> 01:27:22,324
I'm sorry to be late.

1400
01:27:22,358 --> 01:27:26,317
I was finishing a letter
to Maud Devises.

1401
01:27:26,362 --> 01:27:28,659
Do you know Maud Devises?

1402
01:27:28,697 --> 01:27:30,358
No, I'm afraid I don't.

1403
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:33,334
She's the daughter
of the Earl of Leigh.

1404
01:27:33,368 --> 01:27:36,165
We're old, old friends.

1405
01:27:36,203 --> 01:27:38,364
Ohh.

1406
01:27:39,473 --> 01:27:41,100
Would you...

1407
01:27:41,142 --> 01:27:43,406
would you care for
some bread?

1408
01:27:43,444 --> 01:27:45,274
It's so close.

1409
01:27:45,312 --> 01:27:47,678
There's thunder in the air.

1410
01:27:47,714 --> 01:27:50,205
Well, take a pill,
dear, and go to bed.

1411
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:52,946
I wish I could go to Athens.

1412
01:27:52,986 --> 01:27:56,284
Anything to get away
from here.

1413
01:27:56,322 --> 01:28:00,418
The Acropolis is really
quite pretty by moonlight.

1414
01:28:00,459 --> 01:28:02,619
I'm afraid my wife
fails to respond...

1415
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,525
to the glories
of classic art.

1416
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:07,963
I'm tired of classic art.

1417
01:28:07,999 --> 01:28:09,967
All those broken columns...

1418
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:12,662
and statues
without arms and legs.

1419
01:28:12,703 --> 01:28:14,330
Oh, Greece isn't so bad.

1420
01:28:14,371 --> 01:28:16,339
Think of Blackpool in November.

1421
01:28:17,774 --> 01:28:21,800
One can't make friends
with people here.

1422
01:28:21,844 --> 01:28:25,041
Even those shipping
magnates... who are they?

1423
01:28:25,081 --> 01:28:26,810
For all their yachts
and their villas...

1424
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:27,974
nouveau riche.

1425
01:28:28,016 --> 01:28:29,313
Take Madame Habib.

1426
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:32,946
Imagine a woman like that
being received.

1427
01:28:32,987 --> 01:28:34,011
Cynthia.

1428
01:28:34,055 --> 01:28:36,579
A scrubwoman's daughter
from Alexandria.

1429
01:28:36,623 --> 01:28:37,851
That's what she was.

1430
01:28:37,891 --> 01:28:40,052
Married five or six times.

1431
01:28:40,094 --> 01:28:41,721
Cynthia, I hardly think...

1432
01:28:41,762 --> 01:28:44,925
Sailing around the world
in that enormous yacht...

1433
01:28:44,965 --> 01:28:46,693
entertaining royalty.

1434
01:28:46,733 --> 01:28:48,257
Who's Madame Habib?

1435
01:28:48,301 --> 01:28:49,781
C YNTHIA: Why,
she's the woman that...

1436
01:28:51,137 --> 01:28:52,627
Eat your curried eggs, dear.

1437
01:28:52,672 --> 01:28:55,799
I'm tired of curried eggs.

1438
01:28:56,942 --> 01:28:59,604
Maud Devises
wouldn't have allowed her...

1439
01:28:59,644 --> 01:29:01,271
inside the house.

1440
01:29:01,313 --> 01:29:03,780
Neither would Lady Ferris...

1441
01:29:03,814 --> 01:29:06,612
or Millicent Coatesworth.

1442
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:09,619
Maud Devises
is a galloping old bore.

1443
01:29:09,653 --> 01:29:13,281
Don't speak of my friends
like that.

1444
01:29:13,323 --> 01:29:16,622
My friends mean
everything to me.

1445
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:21,629
That's what comes
of living in an outpost.

1446
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:23,756
It ruins your manners.

1447
01:29:30,705 --> 01:29:33,765
I think I should go
up to my room.

1448
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:39,738
I did ask you, didn't I?

1449
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,044
You don't come
from Pentwithwith?

1450
01:29:42,082 --> 01:29:44,073
No, I don't.

1451
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:45,141
Oh.

1452
01:29:46,352 --> 01:29:49,014
I should like some sherry
sent up to my room.

1453
01:29:50,356 --> 01:29:52,916
I think I shall lie down.

1454
01:29:54,393 --> 01:29:57,486
Take her up a cup of cocoa,
would you, please?

1455
01:30:12,809 --> 01:30:14,367
Mark.

1456
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:29,283
Mark.

1457
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,820
Mm.

1458
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:37,225
Oh, hello.

1459
01:30:38,264 --> 01:30:40,232
How are you feeling?

1460
01:30:40,266 --> 01:30:42,734
Peculiar.

1461
01:30:43,937 --> 01:30:46,235
Must be the color
of these pajamas.

1462
01:30:46,272 --> 01:30:48,068
How are you?

1463
01:30:48,106 --> 01:30:49,403
All right.

1464
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:51,568
How's your shoulder?
Does it still hurt?

1465
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:53,077
No, not much.

1466
01:30:53,111 --> 01:30:55,738
Lady Cynthia gave me
a couple of shots.

1467
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:58,078
Well, I hope she knows
what she's doing.

1468
01:30:58,115 --> 01:30:59,412
She tipples.

1469
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,077
I thought as much.

1470
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:03,245
Oh, and there was
a scene at lunch.

1471
01:31:03,287 --> 01:31:04,651
What about?

1472
01:31:04,688 --> 01:31:06,986
Oh, how awful
everyone is in Greece.

1473
01:31:07,023 --> 01:31:08,581
Simply too unrefined...

1474
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,889
especially some woman
who has a yacht...

1475
01:31:10,927 --> 01:31:13,258
called Madame Habib.
Too ghastly.

1476
01:31:13,295 --> 01:31:14,489
Who?

1477
01:31:14,530 --> 01:31:16,930
Madame Habib. Too ghastly.

1478
01:31:16,966 --> 01:31:18,263
Married five or six times.

1479
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,767
Nobody who is anybody...

1480
01:31:19,802 --> 01:31:22,599
would even have her
inside the house.

1481
01:31:22,637 --> 01:31:24,229
Madame Habib?

1482
01:31:24,272 --> 01:31:26,740
Mm.
Her yacht's in harbor.

1483
01:31:26,774 --> 01:31:28,765
The Minotaur?
Are you sure?

1484
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:30,107
Mark, lie down.

1485
01:31:30,144 --> 01:31:31,167
Is she here?

1486
01:31:31,211 --> 01:31:32,255
Oh, I don't know. I asked...

1487
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:34,941
Madame Habib?
That would explain everything.

1488
01:31:34,982 --> 01:31:36,210
What would?

1489
01:31:36,316 --> 01:31:38,546
Why he was so desperate
to get rid of us.

1490
01:31:38,585 --> 01:31:40,552
Why he's been hiding
in Aghios Georgios.

1491
01:31:40,586 --> 01:31:42,019
What he's been waiting for.

1492
01:31:42,054 --> 01:31:43,054
Stratos?

1493
01:31:43,089 --> 01:31:44,556
The deal. The big deal.

1494
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:46,558
I must get out
of this house.

1495
01:31:46,592 --> 01:31:48,388
You're not going anywhere.

1496
01:31:48,426 --> 01:31:50,394
Now, Mark, just lie still.

1497
01:31:50,428 --> 01:31:52,225
I've got to go back
to the village.

1498
01:31:52,264 --> 01:31:53,561
You're doing no such thing.

1499
01:31:53,598 --> 01:31:54,909
You're coming with us
to Athens...

1500
01:31:54,933 --> 01:31:57,059
because Mr. Gamble
has already ordered the plane.

1501
01:31:57,101 --> 01:31:58,728
Well, he can unorder it.

1502
01:31:58,769 --> 01:32:01,237
I can't let Stratos
slip through my fingers now.

1503
01:32:01,272 --> 01:32:03,240
Mark, please, be sensible.

1504
01:32:03,274 --> 01:32:05,571
Help me, Nikky.
I've got to get dressed.

1505
01:32:05,608 --> 01:32:06,752
Just tell me
why this woman...

1506
01:32:06,776 --> 01:32:08,744
is suddenly
so important to you.

1507
01:32:08,778 --> 01:32:10,575
She's
a multi-millionairess...

1508
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:11,910
of doubtful repute...

1509
01:32:11,948 --> 01:32:14,245
with one of the finest
collections of jewels...

1510
01:32:14,283 --> 01:32:15,409
in the world.

1511
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:16,576
So what?

1512
01:32:16,618 --> 01:32:18,415
She'd be the perfect
customer, don't you see?

1513
01:32:18,453 --> 01:32:19,931
Stratos can't sell
the Fleet emeralds...

1514
01:32:19,955 --> 01:32:22,082
on the open Market.
They're too well known.

1515
01:32:22,124 --> 01:32:24,421
I don't know what
the Angel of Eastbourne gave me.

1516
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,755
I feel half-crocked.

1517
01:32:25,793 --> 01:32:27,260
Now, look...

1518
01:32:27,295 --> 01:32:29,092
if you lie down...

1519
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,927
and promise not to move...

1520
01:32:30,965 --> 01:32:32,591
I'll go and see
if that yacht...

1521
01:32:32,632 --> 01:32:34,099
really is the Minotaur...

1522
01:32:34,134 --> 01:32:36,694
because there's a telescope
on the terrace. All right?

1523
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,998
I'll be right back.

1524
01:32:39,239 --> 01:32:41,331
And don't move.

1525
01:33:03,927 --> 01:33:05,394
Oh...

1526
01:33:05,429 --> 01:33:07,428
If you're interested
in the sights, gðice Ferris...

1527
01:33:07,463 --> 01:33:08,760
you ought to look
at the Fort.

1528
01:33:09,765 --> 01:33:10,789
Now, where are we?

1529
01:33:12,101 --> 01:33:13,830
There it is.

1530
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:17,394
It's a famous V enetian Fort.

1531
01:33:19,207 --> 01:33:21,505
NIKKY: Hmm.

1532
01:33:21,543 --> 01:33:23,908
The heads of malefactors
were stuck on spikes...

1533
01:33:23,944 --> 01:33:25,411
over the gate...

1534
01:33:25,446 --> 01:33:27,414
and left there
to blister in the sun.

1535
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:29,075
Oh, how awful.

1536
01:33:30,284 --> 01:33:31,910
Well, um,
if you'll excuse me...

1537
01:33:31,951 --> 01:33:32,918
I'm just going to...

1538
01:33:32,952 --> 01:33:33,976
Yes, of course.

1539
01:33:39,892 --> 01:33:41,290
Nikky!

1540
01:33:41,326 --> 01:33:42,691
Auntie!

1541
01:33:42,728 --> 01:33:43,786
Ohh!

1542
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:45,196
Ohh!

1543
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:46,356
Oh, auntie!

1544
01:33:46,398 --> 01:33:49,264
I don't think I've ever
been so furious...

1545
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,530
with anyone
in my whole life.

1546
01:33:51,569 --> 01:33:52,695
Oh, hello.

1547
01:33:52,737 --> 01:33:54,705
I've given the driver
full instructions.

1548
01:33:54,739 --> 01:33:55,865
You've been wonderful.

1549
01:33:55,906 --> 01:33:57,533
I don't know how
to ever thank you.

1550
01:33:57,575 --> 01:33:58,541
It's my job.

1551
01:33:58,575 --> 01:34:00,042
As your passport has it...

1552
01:34:00,076 --> 01:34:01,543
"To afford
Her Majesty's subjects...

1553
01:34:01,578 --> 01:34:03,045
"every help and protection."

1554
01:34:03,079 --> 01:34:05,445
Oh! Do be careful.

1555
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,380
Oh, he's unconscious.

1556
01:34:09,418 --> 01:34:10,885
Do you think
we'll get there in time?

1557
01:34:10,919 --> 01:34:11,886
Poor boy.

1558
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,547
Everything
will be all right.

1559
01:34:13,589 --> 01:34:15,284
Just try to keep calm.

1560
01:34:21,062 --> 01:34:23,030
NIKKY: It's a hearsse!

1561
01:34:23,064 --> 01:34:24,553
How very bizarre.

1562
01:34:24,598 --> 01:34:27,226
I don't think
that's very funny.

1563
01:34:27,267 --> 01:34:29,735
Well, it wasn't intended
to be, my dear.

1564
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:32,238
It so happens it's
the only available vehicle...

1565
01:34:32,272 --> 01:34:34,739
in which anybody
can stretch out flat.

1566
01:34:34,774 --> 01:34:37,174
As long as it gets us
to the airport...

1567
01:34:37,209 --> 01:34:38,574
that's all that matters.

1568
01:34:38,611 --> 01:34:41,136
Yes, well, I think I'm going
to get in the back with Mark.

1569
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,690
Thank you so much,
Mr. Gamble. Good-bye.

1570
01:34:42,714 --> 01:34:45,012
Good-bye.
Have a good journey.

1571
01:34:46,718 --> 01:34:49,312
Thank you.

1572
01:34:52,389 --> 01:34:55,187
Now, you will do
all you possibly can...

1573
01:34:55,225 --> 01:34:57,523
to see that that horror
Stratos is arrested?

1574
01:34:57,561 --> 01:34:59,357
Yes, of course. Absolutely.

1575
01:34:59,395 --> 01:35:00,862
We'll be happy to testify.

1576
01:35:00,897 --> 01:35:04,697
Well, uh... I sincerely hope
that won't be necessary.

1577
01:35:04,734 --> 01:35:05,701
Good-bye.

1578
01:35:05,735 --> 01:35:07,202
Good-bye.

1579
01:35:08,737 --> 01:35:10,728
And happy landings in Athens.

1580
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:03,250
Shh!

1581
01:36:03,285 --> 01:36:05,753
Please, quiet!

1582
01:36:05,788 --> 01:36:07,688
Shh!

1583
01:36:13,795 --> 01:36:15,763
We must get off this street.

1584
01:36:17,464 --> 01:36:19,728
Go down there. Oh!

1585
01:36:43,888 --> 01:36:46,584
It's all right.
Just lie still.

1586
01:36:47,258 --> 01:36:48,384
Mark!

1587
01:36:48,425 --> 01:36:49,903
I don't know what
Lady Cynthia was up to...

1588
01:36:49,927 --> 01:36:51,951
but I'm convinced she's
drugged me to the gills.

1589
01:36:51,995 --> 01:36:53,053
What?

1590
01:36:53,096 --> 01:36:54,736
I found some tablets
in Gamble's bathroom.

1591
01:36:54,764 --> 01:36:56,288
I feel quite astonishingly
wide awake.

1592
01:36:56,332 --> 01:36:59,597
What... you're insane!
Mr. Gamble's the British Consul.

1593
01:36:59,636 --> 01:37:00,779
I don't know
what the devil he is.

1594
01:37:00,803 --> 01:37:01,913
There's something fishy
about them both.

1595
01:37:01,937 --> 01:37:03,581
Now, you get on that plane
and go to Athens.

1596
01:37:03,605 --> 01:37:04,605
Do you hear me?

1597
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,108
If you try to get out
of this hearse...

1598
01:37:07,142 --> 01:37:08,609
I'll do something desperate.

1599
01:37:08,644 --> 01:37:09,787
I've got to get back
to the inn.

1600
01:37:09,811 --> 01:37:11,244
I've the strongest
possible hunch...

1601
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:12,473
that tonight's the night.

1602
01:37:12,513 --> 01:37:14,242
Stratos will kill you.

1603
01:37:14,282 --> 01:37:16,079
And if he doesn't, I will.

1604
01:37:16,117 --> 01:37:17,084
Now, lie down!

1605
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:18,744
Don't you get rough with me.

1606
01:37:18,785 --> 01:37:19,877
I'm an invalid.

1607
01:37:20,787 --> 01:37:22,414
Mark, you're not going
without me.

1608
01:37:22,455 --> 01:37:24,252
You'll only get into
some awful scrape...

1609
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:25,758
and I won't be there
to help you.

1610
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:26,917
Dear Nikky...

1611
01:37:26,959 --> 01:37:28,436
you've gone through
quite enough for me.

1612
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:31,327
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

1613
01:37:37,402 --> 01:37:38,733
Take care.

1614
01:37:44,408 --> 01:37:45,408
Mark!

1615
01:37:49,046 --> 01:37:51,037
Will you explain to them?

1616
01:37:51,081 --> 01:37:55,278
We have a sick man
who must go to hospital!

1617
01:38:08,296 --> 01:38:11,093
Hoo hoo ha ha ho!

1618
01:38:36,587 --> 01:38:37,884
Mark!

1619
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:51,198
Mark!

1620
01:38:51,234 --> 01:38:52,201
Mark!

1621
01:38:52,235 --> 01:38:53,394
Mark...

1622
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:06,236
Mark!

1623
01:39:07,982 --> 01:39:10,314
Mark, stop!

1624
01:40:34,993 --> 01:40:36,153
NIKKY: stop!

1625
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:38,727
Stop!

1626
01:40:38,762 --> 01:40:40,252
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1627
01:40:41,398 --> 01:40:43,025
Stop the boat, will you?

1628
01:40:43,066 --> 01:40:45,364
I want to get on!

1629
01:40:45,402 --> 01:40:46,766
Stop!

1630
01:40:50,072 --> 01:40:51,505
Stop it!

1631
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,666
Will you stop?

1632
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:55,335
I want to get on!
It's very important!

1633
01:41:24,736 --> 01:41:25,736
MADAME HABIB: Come.

1634
01:41:33,411 --> 01:41:35,038
Madame,
there's a young woman...

1635
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:36,307
in a motorboat alongside.

1636
01:41:36,347 --> 01:41:37,974
She's signaling
to come aboard.

1637
01:41:38,015 --> 01:41:39,538
What sort of
a young woman?

1638
01:41:39,582 --> 01:41:41,413
CAPTAIN:
A young woman.

1639
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,152
I don't recall
any mention of a young woman...

1640
01:41:47,189 --> 01:41:48,986
in the arrangements.

1641
01:41:49,024 --> 01:41:51,891
Bring her on board,
and we'll see.

1642
01:41:51,927 --> 01:41:53,622
Yes, madame.

1643
01:42:03,704 --> 01:42:04,795
Thank you.

1644
01:42:08,742 --> 01:42:10,642
What are you doing...

1645
01:42:10,677 --> 01:42:13,110
out in the middle of nowhere
following my yacht?

1646
01:42:17,716 --> 01:42:19,183
Are you Madame Habib?

1647
01:42:19,218 --> 01:42:20,446
Yes, I am.

1648
01:42:20,486 --> 01:42:23,454
And who, may I ask,
are you?

1649
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:25,683
I'm Nikky Ferris.
Please, I must talk to you.

1650
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,088
It's terribly important.

1651
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:29,252
What do you have
to say to me?

1652
01:42:29,294 --> 01:42:31,693
I never heard of you
in my life.

1653
01:42:31,728 --> 01:42:33,423
You're dripping
all over my carpet.

1654
01:42:33,464 --> 01:42:34,863
Oh, I'm sorry.

1655
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:37,799
Don't think because you have
managed to get on board...

1656
01:42:37,835 --> 01:42:39,324
that I'm going
to give you money.

1657
01:42:39,368 --> 01:42:40,460
Oh, I don't want any money.

1658
01:42:40,503 --> 01:42:41,561
Really, I don't.

1659
01:42:41,604 --> 01:42:44,129
What do you want?

1660
01:42:44,173 --> 01:42:46,664
Hurry. You are
holding up my ship.

1661
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:49,233
Are you going
to Aghios Georgios...

1662
01:42:49,277 --> 01:42:50,277
to buy those emeralds?

1663
01:42:51,346 --> 01:42:52,870
What did you say?

1664
01:42:52,914 --> 01:42:54,541
The emeralds
that were stolen...

1665
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:56,244
from Lady what's-her-name
in London.

1666
01:42:56,284 --> 01:42:57,648
She kept them at the bank.

1667
01:42:57,685 --> 01:42:59,062
And Mark was asked
to take them to her...

1668
01:42:59,086 --> 01:43:00,086
and he was held up.

1669
01:43:00,121 --> 01:43:01,331
And he never saw
the man's face.

1670
01:43:01,355 --> 01:43:02,652
It was a terrible scandal...

1671
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:05,317
and Mark had lost his job
and was disgraced...

1672
01:43:05,358 --> 01:43:06,655
and he was in...

1673
01:43:06,693 --> 01:43:09,628
ah-ah-choo!

1674
01:43:12,665 --> 01:43:14,154
Thank you.

1675
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:17,168
Now please explain,
what emeralds?

1676
01:43:17,202 --> 01:43:18,169
Please, may I sit down?

1677
01:43:18,203 --> 01:43:19,227
Sit.

1678
01:43:22,207 --> 01:43:24,834
Aunt Frances and I
were on a holiday...

1679
01:43:24,876 --> 01:43:26,343
and we went
to Aghios Georgios...

1680
01:43:26,377 --> 01:43:28,174
to record some songs
for the BBC.

1681
01:43:28,212 --> 01:43:30,180
And Mark was there.
There was a wedding...

1682
01:43:30,214 --> 01:43:32,010
and the next day
I found him in the crypt.

1683
01:43:32,048 --> 01:43:33,015
He'd been attacked by Stratos.

1684
01:43:33,049 --> 01:43:34,346
Stratos?

1685
01:43:34,384 --> 01:43:35,461
He's the man
with the emeralds.

1686
01:43:35,485 --> 01:43:36,782
- So I helped him.
- Who?

1687
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:38,947
Mark. I had to.

1688
01:43:38,989 --> 01:43:40,132
But then Stratos found out...

1689
01:43:40,156 --> 01:43:41,967
shut me in the windmill.
He was gonna kill me...

1690
01:43:41,991 --> 01:43:43,368
I think, but Mark
and Alexis got me out.

1691
01:43:43,392 --> 01:43:44,620
Who is Alexis?

1692
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,854
He's a boy
from the village.

1693
01:43:45,895 --> 01:43:47,123
He's got a donkey.

1694
01:43:47,163 --> 01:43:48,629
Oh, I see.

1695
01:43:48,663 --> 01:43:50,130
What happened then?

1696
01:43:50,165 --> 01:43:52,360
Well, then... we ran away...

1697
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,958
and spent the night
in these ruins.

1698
01:43:54,002 --> 01:43:55,629
Oh, there were
so many cats.

1699
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:57,194
And then Mark
told me who he is.

1700
01:43:57,238 --> 01:43:58,568
Who is he?

1701
01:43:58,605 --> 01:43:59,799
He's the man
who was held up.

1702
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,398
Not the man whose
face he didn't see.

1703
01:44:01,441 --> 01:44:02,908
Whose face did you see?

1704
01:44:02,943 --> 01:44:03,910
Mark's.

1705
01:44:03,944 --> 01:44:07,037
But he's in... in...

1706
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:08,046
ah-choo!

1707
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,638
I think I need a drink.

1708
01:44:09,682 --> 01:44:11,479
Oh, I know it all
must sound...

1709
01:44:11,517 --> 01:44:13,314
absolutely crazy to you...

1710
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:15,979
but I'm so afraid that
Stratos will kill him.

1711
01:44:16,021 --> 01:44:18,819
And now Mark's gone back
to try and stop him.

1712
01:44:18,857 --> 01:44:20,654
Please help me.

1713
01:44:20,692 --> 01:44:22,956
Please, Madame Habib.

1714
01:44:26,463 --> 01:44:28,328
Stratos will stop at nothing.

1715
01:44:28,365 --> 01:44:30,026
And Mark is sick and weak...

1716
01:44:30,067 --> 01:44:32,296
because he was
shot in the...

1717
01:44:32,335 --> 01:44:34,462
Ah-ah-choo!

1718
01:44:35,872 --> 01:44:38,705
Who else knows
about these emeralds?

1719
01:44:38,741 --> 01:44:42,107
Uh, my... my Aunt Frances.

1720
01:44:43,645 --> 01:44:45,613
Well, I had to tell her.

1721
01:44:45,647 --> 01:44:47,444
And where is she?

1722
01:44:47,482 --> 01:44:50,314
Well, she's in a hearse
at the airport.

1723
01:44:54,689 --> 01:44:56,452
Drink.

1724
01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:57,787
What is it?

1725
01:44:57,825 --> 01:44:59,451
It may clear your brain.

1726
01:44:59,492 --> 01:45:01,460
Oh, my brain's
perfectly clear.

1727
01:45:01,494 --> 01:45:03,621
It's just I'm so cold.

1728
01:45:03,663 --> 01:45:05,255
That will warm you.

1729
01:45:05,298 --> 01:45:07,424
Tell me, do you often...

1730
01:45:07,466 --> 01:45:09,627
have adventures
of this kind?

1731
01:45:09,668 --> 01:45:11,966
Never.

1732
01:45:12,004 --> 01:45:14,302
This is the first one
I've ever had in my life.

1733
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,465
Something tells me...

1734
01:45:15,506 --> 01:45:17,770
it is not likely
to be the last.

1735
01:45:19,344 --> 01:45:21,141
So, your aunt knows...

1736
01:45:21,179 --> 01:45:24,148
and she is in a hearse
at the airport.

1737
01:45:24,181 --> 01:45:25,478
Dead or alive?

1738
01:45:25,515 --> 01:45:28,313
Oh, alive.
At least, I hope so.

1739
01:45:28,352 --> 01:45:29,979
Anyone else?

1740
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:33,216
Um, well, Sophia knows.

1741
01:45:33,256 --> 01:45:35,315
And Lambis, I suppose.

1742
01:45:35,358 --> 01:45:37,656
And I wanted to tell
Mr. Consul...

1743
01:45:37,693 --> 01:45:38,819
the British Gamble...

1744
01:45:38,861 --> 01:45:40,260
Mr. Gamble,
the British Consul.

1745
01:45:40,296 --> 01:45:42,786
Mr. Gamble, the Consul?

1746
01:45:42,831 --> 01:45:44,389
Yes. Do you know him?

1747
01:45:44,432 --> 01:45:48,163
When I knew Mr. Gamble,
he was not the Consul.

1748
01:45:48,203 --> 01:45:50,670
He was a dealer
in antiquities.

1749
01:45:52,006 --> 01:45:55,339
And you know what you are?
You are an imposter!

1750
01:45:55,376 --> 01:45:56,673
Me?

1751
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:58,007
You are the girl...

1752
01:45:58,045 --> 01:45:59,511
from that English
children's book...

1753
01:45:59,545 --> 01:46:00,842
who walked through the glass...

1754
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,178
into a world
full of crazy people.

1755
01:46:03,216 --> 01:46:07,175
And do you knowwho I am?
I am the March Hare.

1756
01:46:11,723 --> 01:46:13,623
Madame, may we get underway?

1757
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:15,354
At once.

1758
01:46:15,394 --> 01:46:19,352
So, what is it precisely
you want me to do?

1759
01:46:19,397 --> 01:46:21,194
Don't buy the emeralds.

1760
01:46:21,232 --> 01:46:22,859
Please!
Give them to Mark...

1761
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,611
and then he'll take them
back to the bank...

1762
01:46:24,635 --> 01:46:26,431
and then he'll get
his job back...

1763
01:46:26,469 --> 01:46:29,029
and everyone will know
that he's in...

1764
01:46:29,072 --> 01:46:30,369
innocent.

1765
01:46:30,407 --> 01:46:31,874
Hmm.

1766
01:46:31,908 --> 01:46:33,875
I have known
many strange people...

1767
01:46:33,909 --> 01:46:35,536
in my life...

1768
01:46:35,577 --> 01:46:39,104
but you are
the most incredible.

1769
01:49:06,812 --> 01:49:08,074
Uhh!

1770
01:51:04,215 --> 01:51:06,513
For crying loud out.

1771
01:51:12,489 --> 01:51:14,855
Hey, my Uncle Stratos
kill Mr. Camford.

1772
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:15,891
What?

1773
01:51:17,093 --> 01:51:19,061
We go now to the Bay
of Dolphins. Quick!

1774
01:51:19,095 --> 01:51:20,255
Where's Nikky?

1775
01:51:20,296 --> 01:51:21,786
Don't know. No time now.

1776
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:23,161
Alexis, wait.
She's with him.

1777
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:25,029
She's with Mr. Camford.

1778
01:51:25,067 --> 01:51:26,762
Come, then.
Boats go now. Quick!

1779
01:51:33,741 --> 01:51:35,766
You are lucky I don't
throw you overboard...

1780
01:51:35,810 --> 01:51:37,437
for the sharks!

1781
01:51:37,478 --> 01:51:40,935
Ohh. What was it
you gave me to drink?

1782
01:51:40,981 --> 01:51:45,281
I feel all sort of
far off and lofty.

1783
01:51:45,319 --> 01:51:48,344
You know, sort of
rather lofty-softy.

1784
01:51:48,387 --> 01:51:49,945
Come!

1785
01:51:53,693 --> 01:51:55,751
We've dropped anchor,
Madame...

1786
01:51:55,794 --> 01:51:56,920
off the Bay of Dolphins.

1787
01:51:56,962 --> 01:51:58,486
Is there anyone?

1788
01:51:58,530 --> 01:52:00,623
CAPTAIN:
He's coming aboard.

1789
01:52:01,633 --> 01:52:03,328
Come here.

1790
01:52:03,368 --> 01:52:05,835
No, wait a minute. Maybe
you'll like this one better.

1791
01:52:05,869 --> 01:52:07,393
"It was
the schooner Hesperus

1792
01:52:07,438 --> 01:52:10,032
"that sailed
the wintry sea...

1793
01:52:10,074 --> 01:52:12,803
uh..."and the skipper would
take this little daughter..."

1794
01:52:12,842 --> 01:52:14,275
In there!

1795
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:15,777
And don't make a sound!

1796
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,507
Above all, don't sneeze.

1797
01:52:17,547 --> 01:52:19,014
But what are you going
to do to me?

1798
01:52:19,048 --> 01:52:20,743
I have not decided.

1799
01:52:22,517 --> 01:52:25,111
You know something? You're
rather a dear little thing.

1800
01:52:25,153 --> 01:52:26,677
I mean it!

1801
01:52:30,257 --> 01:52:31,281
MADAME HABIB: Come.

1802
01:52:38,199 --> 01:52:40,393
Be quiet, Charlemagne.

1803
01:52:40,433 --> 01:52:41,900
Come here.

1804
01:52:45,805 --> 01:52:48,500
Are you the man
from Mr. Gamble?

1805
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:50,030
I am.

1806
01:52:50,075 --> 01:52:52,339
Have you brought
his jewels?

1807
01:52:53,946 --> 01:52:55,072
Yes.

1808
01:52:56,781 --> 01:52:57,748
Well?

1809
01:52:57,782 --> 01:53:00,683
Show them to me.

1810
01:53:00,718 --> 01:53:01,844
STRATOS:
You have the money?

1811
01:53:01,886 --> 01:53:04,514
I must see
the jewels firsst.

1812
01:53:07,324 --> 01:53:09,815
Oh!

1813
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,100
These are the emeralds...

1814
01:53:20,136 --> 01:53:21,647
Orlov brought
to Catherine the Great...

1815
01:53:21,671 --> 01:53:23,001
from the Crimea.

1816
01:53:23,038 --> 01:53:25,871
Part of the Turkish ransom.

1817
01:53:27,175 --> 01:53:28,767
MADAME HABIB:
What magnificence.

1818
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:31,209
Quick,
I want the money now.

1819
01:53:31,245 --> 01:53:32,542
Wait.

1820
01:53:32,579 --> 01:53:34,911
No. I want the money now.

1821
01:53:34,948 --> 01:53:36,609
I want to get off this ship.

1822
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:38,174
MADAME HABIB:
Will you come with me?

1823
01:53:38,218 --> 01:53:39,582
It's in my stateroom safe.

1824
01:53:39,619 --> 01:53:42,679
No. I want
the money here... now.

1825
01:53:42,722 --> 01:53:45,748
You don't even realize
what you're holding, do you?

1826
01:53:45,792 --> 01:53:50,319
A thousand years of passion,
pride, and blood...

1827
01:53:50,362 --> 01:53:53,092
crystallized into
those perfect stones.

1828
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,728
V ery well.

1829
01:54:42,808 --> 01:54:44,298
You!

1830
01:54:44,343 --> 01:54:45,537
Aah!

1831
01:54:45,578 --> 01:54:47,341
What are you doing here?

1832
01:54:51,082 --> 01:54:52,310
Let me go!

1833
01:55:09,265 --> 01:55:10,596
Let him go!

1834
01:55:10,633 --> 01:55:11,827
Let him go!

1835
01:55:11,868 --> 01:55:13,597
Nikky, keep away!

1836
01:55:16,071 --> 01:55:18,767
Stop! Stop this fight!

1837
01:55:18,807 --> 01:55:20,900
You'll smash everything.

1838
01:55:20,942 --> 01:55:22,068
Oh!

1839
01:55:23,245 --> 01:55:26,111
Captain. Captain! Stop them!

1840
01:55:26,147 --> 01:55:28,342
Captain!

1841
01:55:28,382 --> 01:55:31,180
Oh, Captain! Captain!

1842
01:55:31,218 --> 01:55:32,775
Stop them!

1843
01:55:35,121 --> 01:55:36,121
Mark.

1844
01:55:42,127 --> 01:55:44,152
Stop. Stop!

1845
01:55:50,301 --> 01:55:51,393
Unh!

1846
01:55:55,206 --> 01:55:56,298
Stratos!

1847
01:56:01,678 --> 01:56:03,646
There. There is your man.

1848
01:56:05,182 --> 01:56:06,809
Not the young one,
you fool!

1849
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:08,441
The other one.

1850
01:56:10,786 --> 01:56:13,118
You're under arrest.

1851
01:56:13,155 --> 01:56:16,248
The police are insisting
that we turn back to Heraklion.

1852
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:18,885
You must do
as they say, of course.

1853
01:56:18,927 --> 01:56:21,191
But, Madame...

1854
01:56:21,229 --> 01:56:23,356
You should know by now
I always cooperate...

1855
01:56:23,398 --> 01:56:24,591
with the police.

1856
01:56:25,933 --> 01:56:27,798
Nobody is to leave
this ship.

1857
01:56:29,469 --> 01:56:31,130
They cannot have lied.

1858
01:56:31,171 --> 01:56:33,002
The stars cannot lie.

1859
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:35,701
Everybody lies when
it serves their purpose...

1860
01:56:35,741 --> 01:56:37,299
even the stars.

1861
01:56:42,614 --> 01:56:46,141
I lived through two wars,
four revolutions...

1862
01:56:46,184 --> 01:56:48,175
and five marriages...

1863
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:51,188
but nothing...
nothing like this.

1864
01:56:51,222 --> 01:56:53,850
I thought I told you
to go back to Athens.

1865
01:56:53,891 --> 01:56:55,415
Yeah.

1866
01:56:56,827 --> 01:57:02,059
Of all the pig-headed,
persistent pests...

1867
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:03,065
AUNTFRANCES:
Nikky!

1868
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:07,762
Nikky, you dreadful girl!

1869
01:57:07,803 --> 01:57:09,270
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1870
01:57:09,304 --> 01:57:11,204
Don't you ever, ever, ever...

1871
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,674
Madame Habib,
this is my Aunt Frances.

1872
01:57:13,709 --> 01:57:16,575
Well, since this
seems to have...

1873
01:57:16,611 --> 01:57:18,545
turned into
a family reunion...

1874
01:57:18,579 --> 01:57:21,343
we might as well
make the best of it.

1875
01:57:21,382 --> 01:57:24,442
I will have dinner served
on the rear deck.

1876
01:57:24,485 --> 01:57:28,079
I'm so upset...
I shall have mine in bed.

1877
01:57:30,190 --> 01:57:31,190
Madame...

1878
01:57:32,225 --> 01:57:34,351
I'm sorry to
inconvenience you...

1879
01:57:34,393 --> 01:57:35,937
but don't you think
the Countess of Fleet...

1880
01:57:35,961 --> 01:57:37,053
would like her pendant?

1881
01:57:37,096 --> 01:57:39,656
You and I have not even
been introduced.

1882
01:57:43,234 --> 01:57:47,933
You didn't think I was
going to keep it, did you?

1883
01:57:47,972 --> 01:57:50,873
The Countess happens
to be one of my oldest...

1884
01:57:50,909 --> 01:57:52,273
and dearest friends.

1885
01:57:53,443 --> 01:57:54,933
Thank you.

1886
01:57:58,415 --> 01:57:59,415
MADAME HABIB:
Charlemagne!

1887
01:58:02,718 --> 01:58:06,051
Nikky! Nikky!

1888
01:58:06,088 --> 01:58:07,248
Will someone please...

1889
01:58:07,290 --> 01:58:08,416
Oh, Alexis!

1890
01:58:09,591 --> 01:58:12,958
Will someone please
tell me what's happening?

1891
01:58:16,264 --> 01:58:17,423
Good-bye, Alexis!

1892
01:58:17,464 --> 01:58:18,692
Thanks for everything!

1893
01:58:18,732 --> 01:58:21,257
You come back
to Aghios Georgios.

1894
01:58:21,302 --> 01:58:23,236
We make good hotel now.

1895
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:25,670
We'll come back soon,
Alexis. Good-bye.

1896
01:58:25,706 --> 01:58:27,070
Good-bye. We'll be back.

1897
01:58:27,106 --> 01:58:28,334
You come back.

1898
01:58:28,374 --> 01:58:30,239
We have nice
big wedding, maybe.

1899
01:58:30,276 --> 01:58:32,244
Maybe. Ha ha ha.

1900
01:58:32,278 --> 01:58:33,973
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Alexis.

1901
01:58:34,013 --> 01:58:35,570
- Be careful.
- Bye-bye.

1902
01:58:35,614 --> 01:58:36,876
Good-bye, Alexis.

1903
01:58:36,915 --> 01:58:37,915
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
