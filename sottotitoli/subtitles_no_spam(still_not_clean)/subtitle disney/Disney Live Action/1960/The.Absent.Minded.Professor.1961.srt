1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,674
Energy takes on many forms.

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,328
Example, what do we know
of acoustical energy?

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,998
It was discovered by a famous
scientist, right? Wrong.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,125
We must give full credit
to an Italian tenor who,

5
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:20,545
one night, was singing an aria
in a Milano pizza parlor.

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,714
You all know the story,
how he hit a high note,

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,760
and the sound waves shattered a
wine glass on the other side of the room.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,153
Watch me, and I will show you
acoustical energy at work.

9
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,614
Proud are we of mighty Medfield

10
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,742
Alma mater dear

11
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,886
All your sons and daughters hail to thee

12
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,748
Medfield College of Technology

13
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,751
And while we hold your banner high
Rah, rah

14
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,838
We shout your praises to the sky
Rah, rah

15
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,216
For proud are we of mighty Medfield

16
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,261
Loyally we cheer

17
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,196
Medfield, Medfield
Rah, rah, rah

18
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,434
Our Alma mater dear

19
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,333
Now...

20
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:26,061
Your next assignment will be, uh...

21
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,440
Oh, I forgot.

22
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,110
There'll be no assignment.
See you next week.

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,406
Here we are. The beginning of the end.

24
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,409
Point of no return. The last mile.

25
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,286
Now, Shelby.

26
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,511
All right.

27
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,959
"Of all sad words of tongue and pen,

28
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,837
"the saddest are these,
'It might have been'."

29
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,090
Shelby, you promised. Now, stop.

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,800
Did I promise to stop loving you?

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,511
Just open the door, and let me out.

32
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,846
- Suppose he doesn't show up this time.
- He will.

33
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,697
Oh, Reverend. How nice to see you.

34
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,434
You must be getting
awfully tired of my wedding.

35
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,978
Third time's the charm, they say.

36
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:28,149
But I am glad that this time
you brought the bridegroom with you.

37
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,276
At last we meet, Professor Brainard.

38
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,738
Uh, no. This is Professor Ashton.
He's romance languages.

39
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,199
Professor Brainard is physical chemistry.

40
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,410
Oh, dear me.
I seem to have made a mistake.

41
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,539
Not you, sir.
It's Miss Carlisle's mistake.

42
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,182
In fact, I've just been trying to
talk her out of this hideous blunder.

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,294
Shelby, you are speaking
of the man I love.

44
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,214
Love, darling,
is a bouquet of fragrant hyacinths,

45
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,007
not a beaker of heavy hydrogen.

46
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,426
- Am I right, sir?
- I merely perform the service.

47
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,527
I don't take sides.

48
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,141
- Betsy!
- Well, well. Here comes the bride.

49
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,017
- Reverend.
- Good evening, Professor.

50
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,812
And Professor Ashton,
all the way from Rutland University.

51
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,148
Aren't you on the wrong campus, Professor?

52
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,873
Miss Carlisle was kind enough
to invite me.

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,277
Yes, yes, I remember. Seems there was talk

54
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,154
that you, too, were
a contender for Betsy's hand.

55
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,838
Well, Rutland can't win them all,
eh, Professor?

56
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,076
Oh, it was so sweet of you
to go to all this trouble.

57
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,870
And for the third time too.

58
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,080
Well, you know the old saying,
third time's the charm.

59
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,915
That's exactly what I just said.

60
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,918
Well, I'm sick and tired of having
a spinster for a secretary. That's all.

61
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,186
I better go upstairs and change.
The guests will be coming soon.

62
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,730
The bridegroom too, I hope.

63
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,884
Don't worry. I've alerted his housekeeper.

64
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,734
She'll see that he gets here.

65
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,894
The ring is in

66
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,503
Your right side pocket

67
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,459
Professor!

68
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,461
Professor Brainard!

69
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,890
Square root of E minus C, alpha G

70
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,735
No. No, don't stop.

71
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,680
Don't stop. Keep going.

72
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,115
Keep going. Please don't stop.

73
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,047
- Not again.
- Professor!

74
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,200
Bum-bum-ba-bum

75
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,785
Time for you to get dressed!

76
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,578
Just five more minutes, Mrs. Chatsworth.

77
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,913
Just five more minutes.

78
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,930
Merciful heavens, what are you doing?

79
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,543
I'm trying to solve the secrets
of the universe, Mrs. Chatsworth,

80
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,003
and failing...

81
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,088
Failing miserably.

82
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,507
Yes, well, you're stopping right now.
Do you know what time it is?

83
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,676
You've been working here all afternoon.

84
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,512
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I've been working for three long months.

85
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,554
Pardon me.

86
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,139
I've been working
on something important...

87
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,474
Very important.

88
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,184
More important, I suppose,
than getting married?

89
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,284
Hmm?

90
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,913
Oh! Oh!

91
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,166
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I don't know what I'd ever do without you.

92
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,236
Oh, go on!
You're getting a wonderful girl.

93
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,696
If you ask me, she's too good for you.

94
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,672
Thanks, Mrs. Chatsworth. I love you too.

95
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,867
Don't you worry about a thing.

96
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,676
I'll be in the first thing
in the morning to feed the dog.

97
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,971
- Oh, what's the matter with me?
- Is anything wrong?

98
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,683
What a lunkhead I am.
Instead of minus, it should be plus.

99
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,020
So, the molecular configuration of A...

100
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,388
...is almost the same as that of B.

101
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,350
Therefore, if I just don't worry about A
throwing off a little free hydrogen,

102
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,269
it could stand
a few degrees more centigrade.

103
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,854
Any child knows that.

104
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,896
Yes, but remember,

105
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,498
I promised that dear,
sweet girl I'd have you there on time.

106
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,917
- Yes, Mrs. Chatsworth.
- And Professor,

107
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,323
- may I say, "Happy honeymoon."
- You certainly may, Mrs. Chatsworth.

108
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,840
And the same to you.

109
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,204
Miscalculation's been staring me
in the face for weeks.

110
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,332
Sometimes you can't see
the forest for the trees.

111
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,099
Right, Charlie?

112
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,398
All right, Charlie, cross your fingers.

113
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,831
Now. Good.

114
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,460
Good. Very good.

115
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,504
That's good.

116
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,798
Yes.

117
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,761
Yes.

118
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,059
Minus.

119
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,907
Now.

120
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,327
Now we're cooking, Charlie!

121
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,416
We may be in business yet.

122
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,791
It's just awful. Poor darling.

123
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,155
What ails the man?
Missing his own wedding three times?

124
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,614
Well, he might still show up.

125
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,840
You know the old saying,
third time's the charm.

126
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,302
I say three strikes, and you're out!

127
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,708
Thank you all for coming. I...
I'll return your presents in the morning.

128
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,043
I hope you can get your money back.

129
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,812
I'm sorry,
after all the trouble you've gone to.

130
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,216
I'll be at the office
at the usual time in the morning.

131
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,651
- Now, my dear...
- I want to go on as if nothing has happened.

132
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,904
Shelby, I don't seem to have an escort.

133
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,824
- Would you mind waiting?
- I'm yours to command.

134
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,366
Oh, Betsy.

135
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,744
Oh, hello, Charlie.

136
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,412
Go back to bed now.

137
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,680
Let's go back to sleep, hmm?

138
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,394
What...

139
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,606
What happened?

140
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,823
What happened?

141
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,887
Well, that's the end of that.

142
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,279
Get away, Charlie. Get away, Charlie.
Get away, Charlie.

143
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm not sure what we've got here, Charlie.

144
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,587
But if we've got what I think we've got,
we've got something.

145
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,188
There's one way to find out.

146
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,817
Ready?

147
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,156
Yes. Yes, Charlie. We've got it.

148
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,226
You see what's happening?
It's not going lower and lower.

149
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,452
It's going higher and higher.

150
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,038
You know what that means, Charlie?

151
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:33,209
It means just one thing,
it's generating its own energy.

152
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,546
You know what that means, Charlie?

153
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,800
It means we've discovered
a new kind of energy.

154
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,261
A new kind of energy, Charlie.

155
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,849
It's a breakthrough.
A breakthrough, Charlie.

156
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,860
Discovered substance X.

157
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,515
In appearance, subscribes
to classical requirements...

158
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,225
Of metastable compound,

159
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,327
but whose behavior
is distinctly nonclassical.

160
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,081
Hypothesis, the application
of external force

161
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,360
triggers a molecular change,

162
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,713
liberating energy of a type
previously unknown.

163
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,910
Well, Charlie, I suppose
you think these are just rubber balls,

164
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,996
or maybe a flying rubber ball?

165
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,223
But do you know what this really is?

166
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,211
Of course you don't. How could you?
We've just discovered it.

167
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,130
We've got to give it a name, Charlie.

168
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,689
Let's see... Flying rubber.

169
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,067
Flying rubber. Flubber?

170
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,654
All right.

171
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,365
Substance X...

172
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,455
We dub thee... Flubber!

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,069
Well, if our flubber's
going to be of any use to anyone,

174
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,821
we've got to control it, right?

175
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,591
So, we take an ordinary
radioactive isotope.

176
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,205
Now, a sliding shutter to let just the
right amount of gamma rays through

177
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,931
to bombard the flubber.

178
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,836
Now, we put it under here, so that we can

179
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,630
bombard the flubber with gamma rays

180
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,940
to trigger the molecular change,

181
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,344
which is certainly more scientific
than kicking it

182
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,112
or bouncing it around the room.

183
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,284
All right. Here we go.

184
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,423
Eureka! It works!

185
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,973
Perfect control.

186
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,559
Now we ease off on the gamma rays.

187
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,113
And back to Earth.

188
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,074
Light as a daisy.

189
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,025
Just as I thought.

190
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,111
Just as I thought, Charlie.

191
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,198
Weight makes absolutely no difference.

192
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,951
Just shoot up a few extra gamma rays.

193
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,411
Isn't that wonderful, Charlie?

194
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,319
- Professor!
- Are you still here, Mrs. Chatsworth?

195
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,530
What are you doing?
What about the wedding?

196
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,324
Oh, I can still make it, Mrs. Chatsworth.
It's only five minutes to 8:00.

197
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,243
Yes, five minutes to 8:00

198
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,426
in the morning.

199
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,887
In the morning?

200
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,334
No! No, I didn't do it again.

201
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,979
I, I gotta go see Betsy
and tell her what happened.

202
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,465
I, I know what you're thinking,
Mrs. Chatsworth.

203
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,900
But don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

204
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,196
When I tell Betsy what I've got, she's
gonna be the happiest girl in the world.

205
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,811
Mrs. Chatsworth, don't you tell a soul,

206
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,954
but I've discovered flubber.

207
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,458
That poor, poor girl.

208
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,864
My dear, are you sure
it was wise to come in today?

209
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,297
Oh, I'm perfectly all right.

210
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,913
Mr. Alonzo Hawk, President of
the Auld Lang Syne loan company,

211
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,513
et cetera, et cetera.

212
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,750
My dear Mr. Hawk,

213
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,544
during the past few days,
I have been disturbed by rumors

214
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,671
that you plan to take
possession of our campus

215
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,064
and construct a housing tract thereon.

216
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,345
Oh, surely, he wouldn't.
Not even Mr. Hawk.

217
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,281
Let's hope not, my dear, but
the situation requires delicate handling.

218
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,741
But he's an alumnus!

219
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,979
My dear girl, our esteemed alumnus

220
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,398
made an extremely large loan
to the college.

221
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,759
That loan is overdue,
and Mr. Hawk has us...

222
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,412
If you forgive a pertinent expression,
over a barrel.

223
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:01,438
However, my dear Mr. Hawk,
I am quite confident

224
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,315
that I can, uh, demonstrate

225
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:08,112
how an extension of your loan
would be in the best interest to all of us.

226
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,198
I should like to suggest
a meeting at the earliest opportunity

227
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,908
that would be convenient to you.

228
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,160
Naturally, I shall
make myself available...

229
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,346
- Psst!
- However...

230
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:21,583
Don't be angry.
I'm sorry I missed the wedding again.

231
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,017
Look, I couldn't help it.

232
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,228
Don't be angry.

233
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,799
Go. Get out of here.

234
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,525
I don't want to see you.

235
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,928
I was working in the laboratory
and an explosion...

236
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,529
The whole thing blew up. Boom.

237
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,099
Go. Get out of here.

238
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,950
I do not wanna see you.

239
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,186
I hit my head and fell on the floor.

240
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,330
I, I was knocked out. Knocked out.

241
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,876
Go. Get out.

242
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,755
The most wonderful thing happened.
Wait till you hear.

243
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,159
Look. Flubber.

244
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,512
I shall make myself available at
any time you should care to name.

245
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,931
Fuh-lubber. Flubber.

246
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,812
No. Uh, make that,
of the most supreme importance.

247
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,314
Flubber. It's called fuh-lubber.

248
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,067
Fuh-lubber. Flubber.

249
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,946
Flubber. Flubber.

250
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,620
Flubber. Watch.

251
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,875
Oh, uh, good morning, sir.

252
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,586
I'd like to speak to Miss Carlisle, if I may.
It's quite important.

253
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,822
Betsy, I...

254
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,159
Sir, I just want to tell her
I'm sorry I missed the wedding.

255
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,203
Betsy, I have the most
wonderful thing to tell you.

256
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,830
The most wonderful thing
you can tell me is good-bye.

257
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,832
- In which I heartily concur.
- This way, please.

258
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,292
Oh, now, just a minute, President Daggett.

259
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,710
If you'd just give me a chance
to explain to her,

260
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,836
I'm sure she'd forgive me for everything.

261
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,130
Anything you would have to say
will be entirely superfluous.

262
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,856
Kindly take your ball and go.

263
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,013
Daggett!

264
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,390
Why, Mr. Hawk, what a pleasant surprise.

265
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,017
I want a word with you, Daggett.

266
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,853
Splendid! I, too, have been wanting
to have a chat about our little loan.

267
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,038
- That'll be all, Professor Brainard.
- Brainard.

268
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,483
Is this the one you call "Neddie the nut"?

269
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,860
That's right, Pop, and I wish
you wouldn't make a federal case out...

270
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,128
Do you know this man flunked my boy?

271
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,255
No, Mr. Hawk.

272
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,050
Mr. Hawk, I welcome this opportunity.

273
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,829
Sometimes if the teacher and
the parent of the backward student

274
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,413
- can get together...
- "Backward"?

275
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,084
May I remind you, sir, that it was
Hawk brains that founded this town?

276
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,129
Hawk brains that built it?
And you have the gall to say

277
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,882
that my boy, who proudly
bears the name of Hawk, is backward?

278
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,384
Pop, I'd just as soon
forget the whole thing.

279
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,261
Will you shut up when I'm talking?

280
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,737
I wish I could show you
his examination paper, Mr. Hawk.

281
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,824
Not only did he miss every answer, he
even misspelled the name of the college.

282
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,644
Professor, do you mind?

283
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,828
I'd like to discuss
the matter alone with Mr. Hawk.

284
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,315
Well, this means my boy can't play

285
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,208
in the big game tonight
against Rutland, doesn't it?

286
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,711
Where's your school spirit,
flunking your star player?

287
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,781
I don't think this is the kind of a place

288
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,507
a man would wanna lend
a half a million dollars to.

289
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,911
Mr. Hawk, we happen to have
principles here at Medfield.

290
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,998
I offered to help Biff, give him a make-up
exam, but he couldn't be bothered.

291
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,749
All right, so he's ineligible.

292
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,586
And none of your vague promises
about lending the school money

293
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,686
is going to change that.

294
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,022
Mr. Hawk has already loaned the money.
The school is very grateful.

295
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,552
Professor, I rejoice
in your sense of ethics.

296
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,763
But do you mind terribly
if I speak for myself?

297
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,239
- Mr. Hawk...
- Hold it!

298
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,658
I came here to have my say,
and I've said it.

299
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,936
But, Mr. Hawk, a moment of your time.

300
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,664
- I'd like to discuss our loan.
- Oh, you'd like to discuss our loan?

301
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,193
Well, I have an office downtown for that!

302
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,378
And you might bring along some of
those high-flown principles of yours...

303
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,047
And see how much
they're worth in cold cash!

304
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,966
Come on, Biffer!

305
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,539
Get me the file on wealthy alumni,
the one marked "Double-A emergency."

306
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,125
- We have some letters to write!
- Yes, sir.

307
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,960
Betsy, you've got to let me
explain what happened.

308
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,087
Then you'll understand
why I missed the wedding.

309
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,896
Please, listen to me, Betsy.

310
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,176
All right, go ahead. I'd like that.

311
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,861
For once,
I would really like to understand.

312
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,640
Well, darling, like most things
that seem complicated,

313
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,308
it was actually quite simple.

314
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,311
You see, all along, I was thinking
in terms of magnetic energy,

315
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,370
when what I was after all the time
was repulsive energy.

316
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,524
Silly, but you know how you
get carried away with an idea.

317
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,750
Yes, I know.

318
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,695
Now, if it hadn't been for this lucky
explosion, I might never have found it.

319
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,822
See, the application
of external thermal energy

320
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,700
to two previously incompatible
metastable compounds

321
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,369
brought about fusion
at high temperature, combustion,

322
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,845
the release of explosive gases
and an accompanying residue.

323
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,831
And do you know
what that residue was, Betsy?

324
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,931
No.

325
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,376
Flubber.

326
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,545
Flubber. Well, it's been thrilling.

327
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,964
Now, if you'll excuse me.

328
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,549
You know, Betsy, never
in my wildest dreams

329
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,344
did I hope to find a metastable compound
whose molecular configuration

330
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,846
is such that the delivery
of minute particles of energy

331
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,641
to its surface would trigger
a change in the configuration.

332
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,601
You see, this change in
molecular configuration

333
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,603
liberates enormous quantities of energy.

334
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,356
But they act only in a direction
opposite that of the force

335
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,024
which triggered the molecular change.

336
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,151
That's why we call it "Repulsive energy."

337
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,861
That's the way I feel about it.

338
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,698
Strangely enough, Betsy,
the total effect is transient.

339
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,200
And upon the shutting off of
the externally applied energy,

340
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,328
the elemental particles
return to a state of pseudo-equilibrium.

341
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,804
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes.

342
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,208
And now that I clearly understand
what happened to my wedding,

343
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,960
will you excuse me, please?

344
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,963
President Daggett and I have
some very important work to do,

345
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,590
such as, I hope, saving the college.

346
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,136
But Betsy, don't you see?
This can save the college.

347
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,223
- It could be worth millions.
- Do me a personal favor?

348
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,891
Go bounce your ball

349
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,018
somewhere else.

350
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,787
Well, we'll talk it out tonight, Betsy.
I'll pick you up for the game.

351
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,340
Well, I guess we shook them up
a little, huh?

352
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,828
- Nobody's gonna push us around.
- You're kidding, aren't you, Pop?

353
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,621
I mean, about closing down the college

354
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,666
and turning the grounds
into a housing tract?

355
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,725
Son, I'm gonna teach you
some of the facts of life.

356
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,729
The small college, like the small country
store and the little drug store,

357
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,508
they're all in the same boat.
Well, they're sinking.

358
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,928
Today is the day
of the supermarkets, the super colleges.

359
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,155
The little man is gonna get squashed.

360
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,685
But you graduated from Medfield.
It's your college.

361
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,270
All right, so what do you want?

362
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,731
Some total stranger to close it down?

363
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:22,402
Or some loyal, friendly alumnus
to take care of things?

364
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,945
But isn't there something you could do?

365
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,990
I mean, give 'em some more time
on the loan or something?

366
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,826
Now, look, son, I'm sentimental
about Medfield just like you,

367
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:33,888
but it's like shooting a horse
that has a broken leg.

368
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,584
I want to do it to put it
out of its misery.

369
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,795
Now, if I happen to make
a few extra bucks on the side,

370
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,648
well, that's just something
you're going to have to learn to accept.

371
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,094
Yes, sir.

372
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,512
Oh, about the game tonight.

373
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,806
Has the word gotten around
that you're not playing?

374
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,433
Not that I know of. Not yet.

375
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,603
Say, Lenny, see what the point spread is

376
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,772
on the Medfield Rutland game tonight,
will you?

377
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,148
How much you wanna go for?

378
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,944
Oh, whatever the traffic will bear.
8,000 or 10,000 bucks.

379
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,987
Pop, you're not betting on Medfield?

380
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,281
Without me on the team,
we'll get murdered.

381
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,758
Who said I'm betting on Medfield?

382
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,454
You're not betting against us?

383
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,666
Now, son, we have access
to some very valuable information

384
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,835
about that game tonight.

385
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,336
There's an old saying,

386
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,506
"It's an ill wind that doesn't blow
a few extra bucks into the coffers

387
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,300
"of the Auld Lang Syne loan company."

388
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,177
Get the point?

389
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,263
Now, Charlie, when we pull down
the spark lever,

390
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,890
this shutter opens and releases
the gamma rays.

391
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,184
And up goes the flubber,
and up goes the car.

392
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,270
Then, we pull down on the gas lever,
and this shutter opens

393
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,521
and the car goes forward.

394
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,273
Now, when we press on the brake pedal,

395
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,817
this shutter opens and
the gamma rays bring the car to a stop.

396
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,336
Or, if we open the shutter
a little farther, the car goes in reverse.

397
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,950
Now, Charlie, suppose we get a little
tired of just going straight ahead.

398
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,536
So, we turn the wheel to the right,

399
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,622
and we bank to the right.

400
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,641
Turn the wheel to the left,
and we bank to the left.

401
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,504
Well, that's about it, Charlie.

402
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,840
The important thing is that
nobody finds out about this,

403
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,857
except Betsy, of course.

404
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,386
Now, just so people
don't ask too many questions,

405
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,847
we'll put this under the hood
so it'll sound like a regular old Model T.

406
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,576
That ought to do it, eh, Charlie?

407
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,483
Now all they'll say is,
"Well, Professor. Ha, ha.

408
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,586
"See you finally got that old collector's
item of yours in running order."

409
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,339
All right, Charlie, we're all set.

410
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,101
All clear, Charlie.

411
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,428
Now, I'll get your safety belt.

412
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,431
Now this side. Good dog.

413
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,518
Now, sound on.

414
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,770
Lights on.

415
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,038
And gas lever down.

416
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,710
Hang on to your hat, Charlie.

417
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,011
Ah, it handles beautifully, Charlie.

418
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,514
We don't need these up here, do we?

419
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,599
There, that's better, huh?

420
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,910
Now. Now, watch this, Charlie.

421
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,945
Not bad, eh, Charlie?

422
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,922
Let's open her up and
see what she'll really do.

423
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,683
Yahoo!

424
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,565
Well, look what we've got down there.

425
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,860
Look out, girls. Here we come.

426
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,800
Look out, Charlie!

427
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,349
I'll have to watch
where I'm going, huh? Yeah.

428
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,090
Charlie, I've got an idea.

429
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,526
Why don't we fly over and drop in
on that certain someone, huh?

430
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,852
That lovely, adorable Betsy of mine

431
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,482
Oh, won't she be happy Sweet Betsy of mine

432
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,027
When we take her flyin' That Betsy of mine

433
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,981
She'll hug me and tell me
She's not really sore

434
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:22,627
That lovely, adorable Betsy of mine

435
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:46,366
Can you imagine what she'll say
when she sees this, Charlie?

436
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,283
Was there something you wanted?

437
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,954
Yes. I'd like to speak
to Miss Carlisle, if you don't mind.

438
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,455
I'm afraid I do, old man.

439
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,458
Miss Carlisle and I are just leaving
for the game. Ready, dear?

440
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,127
- Yes, Shelby.
- Betsy, before you go...

441
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,545
Excuse us, please.

442
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,047
Betsy, please come over here with me,
if you don't mind.

443
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,966
I have the most wonderful
thing to show you.

444
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,177
Ned, I am trying not to be angry.
Now, please, don't make a scene.

445
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,429
- I'm not making...
- Yes, old man.

446
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,013
Haven't you caused
Miss Carlisle enough embarrassment?

447
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,598
- Come on, Betsy.
- Now look, you stay out of this!

448
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,393
Betsy, it's a surprise.
It's a sort of wedding present.

449
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,202
Just what every girl dreams about.

450
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,149
It's not the car, Betsy.
It's what's inside the car.

451
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:38,168
And I can't show it to you with him
around. Now, would you excuse us?

452
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,323
Betsy! Betsy, wait!

453
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,034
Betsy, you know what I was telling you
about this morning in the office?

454
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,703
I mean, about my discovery?

455
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,205
I want to show you what
I've done with it. It's terrific.

456
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,833
All I want you to do is take one ride
around the block with me.

457
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,268
Just one little ride, Betsy.

458
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,904
Hey, how'd it go?

459
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,698
Was a cinch. All the loot's down,
but I had to give 'em six to one.

460
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,909
Cheap at the price. Get back on the phone.

461
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,802
See if you can find any more
of that kind of money.

462
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,343
I'm afraid it isn't Medfield's night.

463
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,720
My dear, victory isn't everything.

464
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,806
"To love the game beyond the prize,

465
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:52,852
"to honor, while you strike him down,
the foe that comes with fearless eyes."

466
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,104
- Excuse me.
- Ah, Professor.

467
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,233
Pardon me, please.

468
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,542
Late as usual, I see.

469
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,339
Come on, Medfield!

470
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,878
Sure hate to see you betting
against our own team.

471
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:23,023
Betting? Why, this isn't betting.
This is like making it in the cellar.

472
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,075
Oh, if Biff Hawk
were only playing tonight.

473
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,302
Ah, yes, yes. I heard he was ineligible.

474
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,666
Now, I wonder who could've
flunked your star player?

475
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,419
We're much more realistic
about things like that at Rutland.

476
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,519
So I hear.

477
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,463
I understand you pay
your basketball players

478
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,132
more than you do your English teachers.

479
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,109
That's ridiculous!
I get twice as much as...

480
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,447
I really don't care to discuss it.

481
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,988
Our poor boys. They try so hard.

482
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,199
Yes. I feel sorry for people who
don't know when they're beaten.

483
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,160
Don't you, Professor?

484
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,829
Now, Shelby, please don't start anything.

485
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,083
Why doesn't he go down and sit in the
Rutland section where he belongs?

486
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,851
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,760
It's not fair.
Our team can't even reach the ball.

488
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,748
Yeah!

489
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,877
Yes, poor little chaps.
I'd say they need some kind of a lift.

490
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,879
Why don't they try elevator heels?

491
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,688
Very funny.

492
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,984
Elevator heels.

493
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,863
Pardon me. Pardon me, please.

494
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,602
There's more than one way
to skin a cat, Charlie.

495
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,082
She won't ride in my car with me. Okay.

496
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,877
She won't listen to me. Okay.

497
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:08,047
So, we're gonna surprise her, Charlie.

498
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,757
More than that, we're gonna
flubbergast her.

499
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,145
Boys, what can I say?

500
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,440
I'm proud of you.

501
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,943
They're murdering us,
but I'm proud of you.

502
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:33,281
Remember, you're like sons to me,
all of you.

503
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,324
How do you think I feel?

504
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,243
Do you think it's easy,
sitting on that bench

505
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,039
watching you guys out there
gettin' your ears pinned back?

506
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,416
Well, let me tell you this.

507
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,668
I've coached a lot of teams in my day,

508
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,881
but I've never seen a harder
fighting bunch than you boys right here.

509
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,633
You got heart. I mean, real heart.

510
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,636
Coach, do we really
have to go back out there?

511
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,724
Look, I know how you feel, son.

512
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,034
But remember this,
a team that won't be beaten...

513
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,745
Well, Professor!

514
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,983
- Oh, hello, Coach.
- Something the matter?

515
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,360
Or maybe something on your conscience?

516
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,947
No, no, no. I just dropped by
to see if there was anything I could do.

517
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,591
Oh, I am sorry that I had to flunk
Biff Hawk, if that's what you mean.

518
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,927
Well, it's a little late for apologies,
don't you think?

519
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,622
One minute, Coach.

520
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,832
Okay. All right, boys, get ready.

521
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,460
Starting lineup same as the first half.

522
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,255
Fellas, it's too bad Biff didn't keep his
grades up, but that's one of those things.

523
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,925
Just remember,
one man doesn't make a team.

524
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,303
And I tell you, you can go out
in this second half and beat Rutland.

525
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,846
You can win this game.

526
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,114
- Oh, sure, we can.
- Yes, you can!

527
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,602
Because I know something
about you that you don't know.

528
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,522
They're twice as big as we are, but that
doesn't make any difference now.

529
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,859
No difference at all. They could be
10 feet tall, and we could still beat them.

530
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,861
Yes, we could!

531
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,696
You can beat Rutland if you go
out there and give it

532
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,949
all the drive and the bounce you've got.

533
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,785
Remember that word, bounce. Bounce.

534
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,705
And when you bounce, remember this,
no matter how much you put into it,

535
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,431
you're going to get twice
as much out of it.

536
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,393
Now, get out there, fellas, and hop to it.

537
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,694
Come on, Rutland. Mow them down!

538
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,887
Say, what's goin' on out there?

539
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,602
- What got into them?
- I don't know!

540
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,062
Maybe it was that pep talk
Professor Brainard gave them.

541
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,790
- Well, what did he say?
- I wish I could remember!

542
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,183
- Go, Medfield!
- Go!

543
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,716
Will you listen to me?

544
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,010
I tell you, there's something fishy
going on out there!

545
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,596
All right, what? You tell me!

546
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,140
Well, how do I know! Something!

547
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,600
Well, what am I supposed to do?

548
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,978
There's nothing in the rule book that says
one team can't jump higher than the other.

549
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,412
Now get back to your bench.

550
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,788
Gosh, Pop, look at 'em go! Look it!

551
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,097
I'm looking!

552
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,325
Come on, Medfield! Come on, team!

553
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,935
Come on, Medfield!

554
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:31,829
Come on, team!
Oh, look at 'em go. Aren't they terrific?

555
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,348
Sorry, Pop, I forgot. Come on, team!

556
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,632
Hey, chief, what do you know?

557
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,301
Lenny just laid off another five Gs
against Medfield.

558
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,180
Against Medfield?
Thank you so much. You meathead!

559
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,156
Don't you know what's going on out there?

560
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,858
Shoot, Humphrey! Shoot!

561
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,665
Go, go!

562
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,339
- We did it!
- Sure, we did it.

563
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,717
The reason I did it, Betsy,
is because you wouldn't listen to me.

564
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,635
What do you mean you did it?

565
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,721
Well, you saw the way
the boys played tonight.

566
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,056
The only reason they could play
like that is because of my discovery.

567
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,266
You see, I took their shoes...

568
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,727
Surely, you're not taking credit
for Medfield winning tonight?

569
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,313
- Well, in a way, yes.
- Now, I've heard everything.

570
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:06,692
To watch those boys out there tonight,
fighting, playing their hearts out to win,

571
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,487
and now to hear you
standing here taking the bows for it.

572
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,905
Well, I didn't mean it that way exactly.

573
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,907
Pretty small, Brainard.
That's all I can say.

574
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,283
Pretty small.

575
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,910
- Well...
- Come on, let's go.

576
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,220
No, Betsy! Betsy, wait a minute. Let me...

577
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:54,573
Shelby, please give me time to think.

578
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,824
Of course, darling.

579
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,786
You can give me your answer
tomorrow night after the dance.

580
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:03,082
And I think I know what it'll be.

581
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,792
Good night, my love.

582
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,893
Good night, Shelby.

583
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,326
You've probably always thought of me
as a kindly levelheaded professor,

584
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,453
haven't you, Charlie?

585
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,123
Well, now you see
what a woman can do to you.

586
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:48,335
I'm a desperate man, Charlie,
and desperate men do desperate things.

587
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:52,605
Lights off, sound off and up we go.

588
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,531
Officer! Officer!

589
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,257
Officer, help me! It's after me! Help me!

590
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,287
I do hope that you will
excuse my appearance,

591
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:50,499
but I was just having
a cup of boiling hot coffee.

592
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,767
- But it's after me!
- What's after you?

593
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,520
I don't know. Some kind of a thing!

594
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,799
A thing? Can you describe it?

595
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,192
No, I didn't see it. But it flies!

596
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,345
And it, and it, and it made a noise.

597
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,973
Like, uh, "Aaoogah, ahoogah."

598
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,435
And then it banged down on the top
of my car, "Voom! Voom! Voom!"

599
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,744
And when I looked,
there wasn't anything there.

600
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,733
Ohh! That kind of a thing.

601
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,943
Well, suppose you blow
into this little thing,

602
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,112
and we'll see if we can't
find out where it came from, all right?

603
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,240
Well, do something. It's probably
lurking up there in the dark right now,

604
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,451
ready to spring! Go on!

605
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,786
Don't, don't worry.
We won't let it get you.

606
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,163
Now, come on, blow, okay?

607
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,790
This is outrageous.
You're behaving like savages!

608
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,626
I happen to be Professor Ashton,
head of the English department

609
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,003
at Rutland college,

610
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,770
and a very important person there.

611
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,926
Well, now, in that case, this ought to be
easy for an English teacher.

612
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,764
Can you say, "Peter piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers"?

613
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,015
Have you gone mad?

614
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,975
Or, perhaps you'd prefer,

615
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:53,353
"Round the rugged rock,
the ragged rascal ran."

616
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,355
I'll say no such idiotic thing.

617
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,817
We are not being
very cooperative, now, are we?

618
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,779
Come on. Blow into this.
We'd appreciate it very much.

619
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,964
I'll do no such thing. I'll... I'll...

620
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,674
Blow!

621
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,043
Having a little trouble, Officer Hanson?

622
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,603
No, just the usual.

623
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,757
We always have a few 502s
after the Rutland game.

624
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,483
Uh-huh. I didn't know
they were such bad losers.

625
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,778
Brainard! Tell these idiots...

626
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:32,851
Well, Professor, I see you finally got
the old Model T in working order.

627
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,162
Yeah. Yeah, it took a little
fixing, but, ah, here she is.

628
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:41,068
Say, sounds like you could use
a little valve job in there.

629
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,903
Oh, you know Model Ts.

630
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,697
Sometimes you could swear
they could run without valves.

631
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,980
- Or even without a motor.
- That's right. So long, Officer.

632
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,909
So long, Professor.

633
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,972
Brainard! Tell them who I am!

634
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,584
Now, you told us who you are.

635
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,645
Suppose we all go confide
in the sergeant, hmm?

636
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,524
You know, you boys
are a big comfort to me.

637
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,944
I take a bath for 15,000 bucks, and
you two can't find out what happened.

638
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,697
Maybe they slipped them
some new kind of vitamin pill.

639
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,700
If we could grab one of the boys,
we could give him a saliva test.

640
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,342
Oh, forget it, would you?

641
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,718
Hi, Pop.

642
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,122
Well, did you find out anything?

643
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,582
- I sure did.
- What?

644
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,791
It was Neddie the Nut.

645
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,294
The professor? Well, what did he do?

646
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,712
He was in the locker room
between halves...

647
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,062
And then?

648
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,564
- He gave the boys a pep talk.
- What else?

649
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,968
That's all. He just talked to them.

650
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,845
Talked to them? Is that the...

651
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:54,073
Will you give me that?
Is that the big news you had for me?

652
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,644
- Well, is it?
- That's about the size of it, Pop.

653
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,022
Oh, well, three cheers for you, sonny.

654
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,416
That's an Earth-shattering bit
of information you got there.

655
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,466
Biff! Come here! Come here!

656
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,927
You see anything?

657
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,582
Just Neddie the Nut
flying his old Model T.

658
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,307
Say that again.

659
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,520
Neddie the Nut flying his old Model... T.

660
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:28,691
Yeah! And that's the genius
you were callin' a nut.

661
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:34,181
Oh, yeah, in class he's been beatin'
our ears about some new kind of energy.

662
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,308
Says he's lookin' for a breakthrough.
Some kinda jazz like that.

663
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,658
Breakthrough?

664
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,104
Have you any idea

665
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,040
what that kind of jazz is worth?

666
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,787
Someone to see you, Professor.

667
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,498
Oh, I can't see anybody now,
Mrs. Chatsworth. What does he want?

668
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,209
Your kind indulgence, Professor.

669
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,712
Can you find it in your heart
to forgive this hotblooded businessman?

670
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:09,424
Uh, hotblooded businessman who
plans to tear down Medfield College?

671
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,550
What do you want, Mr. Hawk?

672
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,903
Wonderful things.
Wonderful things for all of us.

673
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,933
Visualize, if you will,
a whole new Medfield College.

674
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,117
Ten new buildings, 10 stories high.

675
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,995
One building devoted entirely to science.

676
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,501
Two, if you will? Three?

677
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,963
- How does it sound?
- It sounds great.

678
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,927
But, uh, just where is all this
money coming from, Mr. Hawk?

679
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,181
From a certain revolutionary discovery.

680
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,169
What's so revolutionary
about an old Tin Lizzie?

681
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,005
Nothing,

682
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,982
unless, of course, it happens to fly.

683
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,822
- Fly?
- Like I happened to see it do last night.

684
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,408
Oh. You saw it, huh?

685
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,369
Uh-huh.

686
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,273
Prof, I gotta hand it to you.
You sure know...

687
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,109
Hold it. Hold it.

688
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,944
Now, why don't we trust
each other, Professor?

689
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,321
After all, you're
a man of science, head in the clouds.

690
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,741
I'm a down-to-Earth, dollar-and-cents man.

691
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,160
That's right. My pop always says
he can smell a buck 10 miles...

692
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,261
I'll do the talking, son!

693
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,414
That's a good boy.

694
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,959
There's a million angles to this.
The government! The space age!

695
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:30,254
What they wouldn't give
to get their sticky hands on this little tin.

696
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,481
That's where I come in.

697
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,968
When I get through talking with them,

698
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,471
they'll come crawling to us on
their knees with bags of money,

699
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,946
barrels of money!

700
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,809
Mr. Hawk, let me get this straight.

701
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,537
You want me to turn my discovery over to you
so you can blackmail our government?

702
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,149
All right then, look at it this way.

703
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,818
Medfield College can grow and prosper,

704
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,546
or it can wither and die on the vine.

705
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,158
That's entirely up to you.

706
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,466
I see.

707
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,662
Mr. Hawk,
I want to thank you for dropping by.

708
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,764
- You've made up my mind for me.
- Now you're talking.

709
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,001
I'm going to call the President.

710
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,561
Daggett? He don't cut any ice.

711
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,189
The President of the United States.

712
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,467
Is that enough ice for you?

713
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,178
Now, see here.
Let's not go flying off in all directions.

714
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,055
Just one direction, Mr. Hawk. Out!

715
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,724
Don't get me wrong.
I heartily endorse our government.

716
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,559
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- I approve of our government.

717
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,229
All right. You're lowering
the boom on poor old Medfield College,

718
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,773
but don't you try to come back afterwards.

719
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,624
The iron door is shut!

720
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,784
Well, there goes the ball game.

721
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,786
He'll telephone Washington,
and by tomorrow,

722
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,497
this place will be swarming with sharpies.

723
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,208
Supposing you did get
the professor's discovery?

724
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,142
Did you mean what you said about
not closing down Medfield?

725
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,546
If they get a hold of that flying jalopy
before I do,

726
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,256
there's millions right down the drain.

727
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,174
Because if you did, I've got an idea.

728
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,052
- Quiet, son. I'm tryin' to think.
- Switch cars on him.

729
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,695
That idiot Brainard! If he could have...

730
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,352
What did you say, son?

731
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,079
Switch cars on him.
There are other Model Ts around.

732
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,859
Yeah. There are, aren't there, Biffer?

733
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:17,571
- There's a fellow in Appleton that's...
- Hold it. I'm way ahead of ya.

734
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,733
Lenny, take the Appleton turnoff.

735
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,702
Hey, you know something?

736
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,719
You're all right, son.

737
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,123
Of course, you got a little
of your mother in you,

738
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,933
but actually, well,
you're just me all over again.

739
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,770
Yes, sir. You're all right.

740
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,097
I can assure you, sir,
the President is keenly interested

741
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:47,767
in any development which might
have to do with our national welfare.

742
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,537
But may I inquire as to
the nature of your discovery?

743
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,374
Flubber?

744
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:59,112
Yes, that does sound significant.

745
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,948
Now, if I only knew which
branch of the government

746
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,451
might best be served by your discovery.

747
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,246
Why, any branch. You name it.
Transportation, industry, agriculture.

748
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,499
Agriculture. Good.

749
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,350
Oh, don't cut me off.

750
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,353
Agriculture department.
Sam Wheeler speaking.

751
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,731
Splendid.

752
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,983
Mmm-hmm, I see.

753
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,720
Just how do you figure
this can help the farmer?

754
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,973
I don't want to help the farmer.
I want to help everybody.

755
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,115
Don't you understand?

756
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,770
Well, now, what possibilities do you
think this might have as a fertilizer?

757
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,772
Fertilizer?

758
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:37,067
Don't any of you people down there
understand how vital this thing is?

759
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,086
It's not only agricultural,
it's industry, it's national defense.

760
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,757
Oh, national defense. National defense.

761
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,416
Before we go any further,
I just want you to know

762
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,962
that I am proud of the new
spirit of cooperation

763
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,006
between the Army,
the Navy and the Air Force.

764
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,175
Even the newspaper columnists
are talking about it.

765
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,635
There never was any real
difference between us.

766
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,678
Of course not.

767
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,805
Just a lot of newspaper
guff in the first place.

768
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,449
Excuse me, sir. There's a Professor
Brainard on the phone from Medfield.

769
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,978
Brainard? I don't know
any Professor Brainard.

770
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,437
Tell him to write me a letter.

771
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,856
He might have some connection with
Congressman Brainard.

772
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,525
On the Appropriations Committee.

773
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,443
Congressman Brainard swings a lot of lead.

774
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,127
He's always been friendly to us.

775
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,630
Oh, very well.

776
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,536
Hello. Well, how are you, Professor?

777
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,303
What can we do for you?

778
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,642
Oh, you have, eh? Why, that's amazing.

779
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,144
It's sort of antigravity.

780
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,464
Well, well.

781
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,316
And you think it's a breakthrough?

782
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,388
Looks like you fellas don't need
all that appropriation money after all.

783
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,683
I got a fella right here said he cracked
the antigravity problem

784
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,117
right in his own garage.

785
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,495
- Ridiculous.
- Another crackpot.

786
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,816
The Army's been doing
antigravity research for years.

787
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,167
Hasn't come up with
anything significant yet.

788
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,905
Oh, yes, Professor. I'm listening.

789
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:09,576
Yes, Professor.
Yes. Yes, I realize it's urgent.

790
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,911
So many things are these days.

791
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,972
Oh? You want to come
down here to Washington?

792
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,500
Well, now, I don't know
about that, Professor.

793
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,419
We'd love to see you, of course.

794
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,254
Alert my pilot to stand by.

795
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,674
Yes, but we are all busy
as bird dogs around here.

796
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,092
I tell you what, Professor.

797
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:30,347
Why don't you write us
a nice short letter?

798
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,474
Tell us all about it.

799
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,960
Right, and keep up
the good work, Professor.

800
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,496
Call us any time.
Or better still, we'll call you.

801
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,457
Good-bye.

802
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,443
Good-bye.

803
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,279
They won't listen. Betsy won't listen.

804
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,806
That crook, Hawk, is the only
one that'll believe me.

805
00:57:48,906 --> 00:57:51,933
- Professor?
- Come in, Mrs. Chatsworth.

806
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,954
There you are. All sponged and pressed
for the dance tonight.

807
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,999
Oh, thank you,
but I won't be going to the dance.

808
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,685
Oh, no. You're not letting that dear,
sweet girl go with someone else?

809
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,798
That dear, sweet girl has
kicked me out of her life.

810
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,967
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
Stay home and talk to the dog?

811
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,402
Mrs. Chatsworth,
don't you turn against me too.

812
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,806
Professor, may I say something?

813
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,433
I'd rather you wouldn't,
Mrs. Chatsworth. Not just now.

814
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,144
All right. Do as you please.

815
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,854
Go on with your head in the clouds

816
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,941
and your nose poked places
that it doesn't belong.

817
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,418
Go ahead, like I said.
Unlock the secrets of the universe.

818
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,987
But remember this,

819
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,840
the universe is millions and
millions and millions of years old.

820
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,219
It can wait a little,
but girls can't wait.

821
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,039
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I've told you I'm not going...

822
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,475
One day, a girl simply says to herself,

823
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:46,271
"That's enough. I'll just marry the next
man that comes along."

824
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,981
And she does.

825
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,968
Mrs. Chatsworth...

826
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:53,513
If I were in your shoes, I'd stop that
smashing or mashing the atom,

827
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,282
or whatever it is you're doing out there,
and I'd go to that dance.

828
00:58:57,825 --> 00:59:00,186
Why? Betsy won't even look at me.

829
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,688
Don't they have those numbers

830
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,107
where you walk up to the dancers
and tap 'em on the shoulders?

831
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,817
- Yes. I suppose.
- Well, then.

832
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,627
You walk up to Shelby,
tap him on the shoulder,

833
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,322
- then when he turns around...
- I'll punch him in the nose.

834
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,589
Good.

835
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,160
No, that wouldn't be civilized.

836
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,703
Well, for goodness' sake.

837
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:21,458
Grab the girl in your arms, hold her tight
and dance her off into the night.

838
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,558
Show him up.

839
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,186
Show up Shelby Ashton, the ballroom beast?

840
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,506
He's the best dancer around here.

841
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:31,134
I dance like a sleepwalking chimpanzee.

842
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,319
Well, even a chimpanzee
will fight for its mate.

843
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,519
I told you he'd turn up here tonight.

844
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,365
And sink the Army
Sink the Army gray

845
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,465
Taxi!

846
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,475
You boys get right in.
I'm the only taxi. I'm pulling right out.

847
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,238
Where to?

848
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,158
Professor Brainard's... House.

849
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,594
What are you doing?

850
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,945
Even a chimpanzee fights for its mate.

851
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,537
Oh!

852
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,542
Let me go. People are looking.

853
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,945
Good. Let's not disappoint them.

854
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,922
The professor must have
given himself a pep talk.

855
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,766
Watch. Maybe you can learn something.

856
01:03:30,189 --> 01:03:31,389
Go, prof. Go!

857
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,418
We ought to do this more often.

858
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,353
Will you let... Oh! Oh!

859
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,067
Oh! Oh! Oh.

860
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,529
Oh, Ned!

861
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,885
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

862
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,778
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze...

863
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,394
I wonder what's going on inside.

864
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,955
- Let's go in and see what's buzzing.
- Enough fun for one night.

865
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,959
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease...

866
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,795
On second thought,
maybe the fun's just beginning.

867
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,870
I beg your pardon. Are you the
gentlemen from Washington?

868
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,114
- We are.
- Are you looking for a Professor...

869
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,432
- Brainard?
- Oh, I'm afraid that's not me.

870
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,727
There's your man.

871
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,106
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze...

872
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:10,389
The man on the flying trapeze

873
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:13,226
Oh

874
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,244
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

875
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:20,441
It certainly is a surprise, your coming
all the way from Washington to see me.

876
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,501
Here we are. Get right in, gentlemen.

877
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:27,672
Get right in the car, please.
Admiral, General.

878
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:39,001
Now, of course, gentlemen,
I realize that military technology

879
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,045
has progressed far beyond
the Model T, right?

880
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:43,089
- Of course.
- I want you to understand

881
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,174
I'm using it as a security measure.

882
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:48,760
What better place to hide
my discovery than in a Model T?

883
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,638
And I want you to keep
in mind also, gentlemen,

884
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:53,474
that this is only a primitive
application of my discovery.

885
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:57,019
Now, we use this
spark lever here to levitate,

886
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,813
the gas lever to move forward,

887
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,065
and the brake pedal to stop
or to go in reverse.

888
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:04,193
Absolute control at all times,
as you will see.

889
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,697
All right, gentlemen,
get a good, tight grip on your emotions,

890
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,547
and prepare for takeoff.

891
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:19,474
A cool head, a steady hand, and up we go!

892
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,924
Well, if at first you don't succeed...

893
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,441
Then what?

894
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,652
You try again.

895
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:41,522
Well, surely you gentlemen
understand this sort of thing.

896
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:44,916
I imagine the first time
you tried to launch a rocket, it didn't...

897
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,586
Go up.

898
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,173
It's probably just a short
in the control mechanism.

899
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,036
I'm sorry about this
little delay, gentlemen.

900
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,288
We'll have the show
in the air in a minute.

901
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:06,146
This is some kind of a joke.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

902
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,352
I tell you, gentlemen, somebody is just
playing a practical joke.

903
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,618
I'm not laughing.

904
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,662
Just a minute, gentlemen. Please.

905
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,415
Gentlemen, wait. Please.

906
01:07:34,966 --> 01:07:37,536
Nice going.
That was rich about the squirrel.

907
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,596
A real Hawk touch.

908
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,249
Kind of a mean trick
to play on the professor.

909
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,976
Well, now, son,
we're doing him a favor. You'll see.

910
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,466
Well, I think we've
cleared the air on one important point.

911
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,717
What's that?

912
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,095
With what's happened, I'm sure
there's no longer any doubt

913
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,695
about you and Ned Brainard.

914
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,558
No. None whatsoever.

915
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,228
As the Bard says,
"That he is mad, 'tis true,

916
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,996
"'tis true, 'tis pity,
and pity 'tis 'tis true."

917
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,499
Oh, shut up.

918
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,004
Well, if that's what
she thinks of Shakespeare.

919
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,054
Ned?

920
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,584
If you've come out here to gloat,
Betsy, I can do without that.

921
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:28,629
- Oh, I'm not gloating.
- But I know what you're thinking.

922
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:32,383
That I'm a fraud,
that I'm really losing my marbles.

923
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,593
Are you sure you're all right?

924
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:37,430
Betsy, I solemnly swear to you
I have flown this car.

925
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,682
Oh, don't, darling.

926
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,268
I'll take you home.
You get a good night's rest.

927
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,978
Betsy, how can I...

928
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:47,398
Wait a minute.
Why didn't I think to show this to them?

929
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,125
I got so upset when the car wouldn't fly.
Here.

930
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,629
Take this. Now, hold it out.

931
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,464
Now, drop it.

932
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:04,373
Flubber! That's how I was
able to bounce around in there.

933
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,890
That's how we won the basketball game.

934
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,961
This is what makes the car fly.

935
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,672
Are you sure you actually
made that car fly?

936
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:13,231
This very car.

937
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,179
No. No, I take that back.

938
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,930
Well did you or didn't you?

939
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,476
This isn't my car, Betsy.
My car had a radio in it.

940
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,312
Somebody switched cars on me.

941
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,605
- Hawk!
- Hawk?

942
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,649
Alonzo Hawk. He saw me
flying the car last night,

943
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,027
and he came to me to make
a deal, and I turned him down.

944
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,029
- He stole my car.
- Are you sure?

945
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,782
Will you stop saying that, Betsy?
Of course I'm sure.

946
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,408
Please believe me.

947
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,036
Now, we've got to get that car back.
In the hands of a man like Hawk...

948
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,329
Ned, I believe you.

949
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,763
Now, if we can only
figure out some way to...

950
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:48,933
You what?

951
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,436
I believe you.

952
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:55,190
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

953
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,400
Oh, Betsy.

954
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,679
Well, I'm glad to see you came around
to my way of thinking, Professor.

955
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,473
I'm with you one 100%, Mr. Hawk.

956
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:06,034
Yes, I know, but we were discussing
the Model T. What's with these shoes?

957
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,686
Flubber, Mr. Hawk.

958
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:10,856
When you wear these flubberized
shoes, you'll have a spring in your step.

959
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,525
You'll walk with your head
above the crowd.

960
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,360
You'll live life to the fullest.

961
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,780
And when the time comes, as the poet
says, to shuffle off this mortal coil,

962
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,115
you won't shuffle, Mr. Hawk.

963
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,300
You'll go out with a hop,
a skip, a jump and a song in your heart.

964
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,287
I still don't get it.
What about the Model T?

965
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,541
Oh, Mr. Hawk.
Surely you can see the point.

966
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,935
Why, shoes are 10 times
more valuable than a flying car.

967
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,687
- How come?
- Well, figure it out.

968
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:39,051
Only 8% of the world's
population buy cars.

969
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,818
Practically everybody buys shoes!

970
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,781
- You know, she's right.
- Sure she's right.

971
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:49,895
- Now take it easy, Mr. Hawk.
- Huh?

972
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,981
- I'll show you how the flubber works.
- Hmm?

973
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,541
Now, just tap your heel on the floor.

974
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:01,339
- You see?
- Yeah.

975
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,368
Well, I don't know if
I can hold my balance.

976
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:07,246
Well, it just takes
a little getting used to, Mr. Hawk.

977
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,623
Why, Ned's crazy about his.
Aren't you, dear?

978
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,000
Oh yes, I certainly am.

979
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,252
I can't tell you the lift
I have gotten from them.

980
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,187
Now, just jump up and down, Mr. Hawk.

981
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,189
- Up and down?
- Uh-huh.

982
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,304
There we go!

983
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:28,157
Mr. Hawk, I think
that's high enough for right now.

984
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,352
- Hold him down.
- That's fantastic.

985
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,704
Hold him down. Hold him down, Betsy.

986
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:35,357
There we are.
Now, wasn't that wonderful, Mr. Hawk?

987
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,902
- Wonderful. Why did you stop me?
- We want to talk to you.

988
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,487
You see, we know that you're interested
in more than just money.

989
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,531
- Surely, you are.
- I am? What?

990
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,659
Humanity, Mr. Hawk.
You can save lives with these shoes.

991
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:46,785
Of course you can.

992
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:51,123
Now, suppose, just suppose,
there's a fire, a raging fire.

993
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:54,251
The stairs are a blazing inferno,
the smoke is billowing under the door.

994
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,795
We're trapped! Help! Help! Help!

995
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:59,548
The flames are creeping closer and closer.

996
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,065
Oh, no, no, no.

997
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,276
I can't stand it any longer.

998
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:06,070
- Geronimo!
- My boy!

999
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,072
Nothing to it, Mr. Hawk.

1000
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,580
- Why, that's amazing!
- Okay, your turn, Mr. Hawk.

1001
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,358
Oh, well, now. Just a minute.

1002
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,984
Oh, it's fun, Mr. Hawk!

1003
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,335
Go ahead.

1004
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,920
You'll land light as a thistle, Mr. Hawk.
I promise you.

1005
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,507
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, let me put it this way.

1006
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,160
I certainly wouldn't want
to have a partner

1007
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,886
who doesn't have faith in his own product.

1008
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:34,041
Oh, you better do it.
He's very fussy about things like that.

1009
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,168
Well, nobody's
ever been able to call me a coward.

1010
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,436
Oh, I should say not, Mr. Hawk.

1011
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,485
Come on down, Mr. Hawk. One, two...

1012
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,180
- Well, I've changed my mind.
- Three!

1013
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:57,080
Whee! Hey, look!

1014
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,123
Look! I'm doing it!

1015
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,318
Sure you are, Mr. Hawk.

1016
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,987
Put a little more spring into it.

1017
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,505
See how simple it is? Flex your knees.

1018
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:08,701
That's right. Look at Mr. Hawk, dear.

1019
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:11,844
- Isn't he doing well?
- This is marvelous!

1020
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:14,206
Brainard, we've got something here.

1021
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,890
Sure we have, Mr. Hawk.

1022
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,977
Okay, I'm sold. Now, how do I stop?

1023
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,881
- What did he say, dear?
- I can't quite catch it.

1024
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:26,192
- I can't either.
- I said tell me how to stop.

1025
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:29,805
You can tell me something, Mr. Hawk.
What have you done with my car?

1026
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,933
- You tricked me!
- That's right, Mr. Hawk.

1027
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:35,368
Now, where is it? Where did you hide it?

1028
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,730
In my warehouse.

1029
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,190
- In his warehouse!
- Thanks, Mr. Hawk.

1030
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,793
- Hey! How do I stop?
- Happy landing, Mr. Hawk.

1031
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,671
Wait! Don't go!

1032
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:51,076
Professor Brainard, come back!
Don't leave me!

1033
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:54,429
Wait! Don't go! Uh, Biff!

1034
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,958
Biff, where are you?
It's your father calling.

1035
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:00,919
- Huh?
- Biff! Son, wake up!

1036
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,297
Get outta bed! Help your father!

1037
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,941
Hey! That's pretty neat, Pop.
How do you do that?

1038
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,527
Well, don't just lie there, you nitwit!

1039
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,638
Get somebody! Get the fire department!

1040
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:16,701
- Okay. All right. Don't blow a gasket.
- Stop me! Help!

1041
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,232
I don't get it.

1042
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,501
Why we gotta sit around
watchin' that crummy car?

1043
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,546
'Cause Hawk says so, that's why.

1044
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,325
You figure he knows what he's doing?

1045
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,760
Old fish eye didn't pile up all that loot by
being stupid, ya know what I mean?

1046
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,902
Here I go.

1047
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,725
No. I gotta go up higher.

1048
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,451
There we are.

1049
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,918
Looks like a lot of people
got behind in their payments.

1050
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,810
Dear, sweet Mr. Hawk.

1051
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,605
Shh.

1052
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,177
- Lenny?
- Yeah, what?

1053
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:33,569
You hear noises?

1054
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,489
Like what kind of noises?

1055
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:39,617
Sorta like a...

1056
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,246
A harp?

1057
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:48,986
Now, let's see.

1058
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,613
Oh, no, no, no, now, Betsy.
Put it down, down.

1059
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,757
- Down.
- Easy. Easy.

1060
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,097
There.

1061
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,478
No. You better take my shoe off.

1062
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,385
I, I can't get the knot undone.

1063
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,987
- Oh! My nail.
- Shh-shh.

1064
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,322
Maybe I can help you.

1065
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,911
There it goes again.

1066
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,498
You remember feisty McKenna?

1067
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:32,670
Only with him, it wasn't harp noises.
He kept hearing bird calls.

1068
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,720
Easy, easy, easy.

1069
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,266
Now, easy.

1070
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:52,440
Okay.

1071
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:55,969
Well... Ooh!

1072
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:21,052
Mr. Hawk! This is the fire chief speaking!

1073
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:24,805
We'll have everything under
control in just a moment.

1074
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:27,475
And, Mr. Hawk? Try to relax.

1075
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:30,561
Relax? How can I relax, you fathead!

1076
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,965
All the same, Mary Lou,
I wish you'd come over.

1077
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,274
Pop's putting on a great show.

1078
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,568
Oh, hold it. They're bringing in a net!

1079
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:39,570
Make way. Come on.

1080
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,140
Come down sitting. Not feet first!

1081
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:48,554
The net didn't work so well, Mary Lou.

1082
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:51,191
I told you we needed a new one.

1083
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:55,153
You told me? What do you think
I've been telling the town council?

1084
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:58,156
How am I supposed to buy a new net
without an appropriation?

1085
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,367
Well, don't get hot. I only mentioned it.

1086
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:03,036
Well, you just keep the kinks
out of the fire hose.

1087
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:05,080
That's all I want from you!

1088
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,323
I'm the chief.

1089
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,043
Sure! Come on over, Millie!

1090
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:12,129
You should see it!
Everybody's getting into the act.

1091
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,647
Don't worry, Mr. Hawk.
We'll take care of ya.

1092
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:16,774
No, don't do it! No!

1093
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:22,822
- Ow!
- Personally, I'm a dry fly man, myself.

1094
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,032
Royal coachman.

1095
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,618
- Oh, take it easy.
- I got him.

1096
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,919
Biff, help me!
Do something before they kill me.

1097
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,531
I know, Coach. I know you're
right in the middle of spring practice,

1098
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:41,173
but it's a matter of life and death.

1099
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,048
That ain't no bird call.

1100
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:01,928
Well, look who's here. It's the professor.

1101
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:04,238
Wasn't too smart
breakin' in like that, Professor.

1102
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,975
Well, I, I didn't exactly break in.

1103
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,285
Of course, as you can see,
I'm trying to break out.

1104
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:12,747
Careful, boys.

1105
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,878
Look!

1106
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,574
What happened, boys? You missed me.

1107
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,175
Here. Here I am.

1108
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:28,413
Now, take it easy, boys. Take it easy.

1109
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:32,475
Don't crowd me. I don't want to
have to get tough with you again.

1110
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,386
They're all fresh hot doggies!

1111
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:45,222
They're a foot long! Hot doggies!
Get your hot doggies!

1112
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:48,240
Right this way. Here you are, folks.
Hot dogs.

1113
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,486
And you were the lady
that called the police?

1114
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:02,280
Certainly.
I was getting ready to take a bath,

1115
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,174
and I saw this face
flashing past the window.

1116
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,245
Well, how did I know
the poor man was in trouble?

1117
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,971
Hey! Stand back!

1118
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:16,018
Well, sir, I calculate he gains
about 18 inches to bounce.

1119
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,187
And your opinion is?

1120
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:23,567
About 7:00 tonight,
he's going to be in serious trouble.

1121
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,806
Gosh!
My father never does anything like that.

1122
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,675
For a parent, he's way out.

1123
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,493
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1124
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,125
This way, fellas!

1125
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,842
Son, what are you going to do to me?

1126
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:55,333
One, two...

1127
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:57,685
Biff, I'm your father! Please!

1128
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,019
Hike!

1129
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,204
Pop! Are you all right, Pop?

1130
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:20,207
And why wouldn't I be?

1131
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:21,834
The warehouse!

1132
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,720
Oh, no.
Once more, and we'd have had it open.

1133
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,665
Come on. You're not
going to give up this easily, are you?

1134
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,667
Come on.
It's just a little old bump on the head.

1135
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:41,046
Here. That's it. Come on.
What would Mr. Hawk say?

1136
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:44,007
Come on. Let's get on our feet.
On with the fight. Come on.

1137
01:21:44,907 --> 01:21:47,693
- Here. Try this.
- Oh. Thank you, dear.

1138
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,225
That did it.
Better get back in the car, Betsy.

1139
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:56,702
All right. Come on, you cut-rate gorillas.

1140
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:00,789
- Aim high this time.
- Got ya.

1141
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,377
Okay, Mr. Jumping Jack.

1142
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:24,688
Ned!

1143
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:29,860
Corners beautifully, doesn't it?

1144
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:31,429
Ned, look.

1145
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,031
Here they come.

1146
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:42,373
Come on, you guys. Get in the car!
Hurry up!

1147
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:53,592
To think I always thought of you
as a nice, easygoing college professor.

1148
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,637
- Betsy?
- Hmm?

1149
01:22:57,013 --> 01:23:00,375
No. This is hardly the time or the place
to say what I was going to say.

1150
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,810
Oh, never mind. Go ahead. Say it.

1151
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,979
Well...

1152
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,066
Well, what do you know?
They want to play rough.

1153
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:12,903
- Here. Gimme that thing.
- You can't do that, Pop!

1154
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:15,906
We gotta show this nut we mean business.

1155
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,709
Well, looky there.

1156
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:31,255
A police car. Well, well, well.

1157
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:42,834
- Well, they've been asking for it.
- Asking for what?

1158
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,601
The Shelby stomp.

1159
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,272
It's Brainard.

1160
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,285
- Faster, son!
- I've got it down to the floor now.

1161
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,911
Hold it! All right. All right, you birds.

1162
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,288
Get your hands up on the top of that car.

1163
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:21,957
Now, see here, Officer.
This is ridiculous.

1164
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,640
Do you realize who I am?

1165
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:27,936
Yeah. You're the guy
who had this hot pistol in his mitt.

1166
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:32,441
I am Alonzo P. Hawk, President of
the Auld Lang Syne finance company.

1167
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,278
Isn't it a small world?

1168
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:38,723
Why, of course I remember you.

1169
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,016
Well, now, that's better.

1170
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:41,142
Sure.

1171
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:45,037
You're the outfit that repossessed
my electric icebox last year.

1172
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,191
Well, Officer Hanson, sorry to interrupt,

1173
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:51,001
but can you tell me
the shortest way to Washington, DC?

1174
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,989
Sure, Professor.
Down the block to the intersection.

1175
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,589
Left, Highway 9.

1176
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,010
- No, no. I mean as the crow flies.
- Oh! That way. Due east.

1177
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:01,845
Thanks.

1178
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,082
Officer, stop that man!

1179
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,585
He's flying off with millions of dollars
that rightfully belong to me!

1180
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:12,523
Mr. Hawk. Surely you're not
accusing dear old Professor...

1181
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:29,315
Sir, I have an unknown approaching
Washington prohibited zone.

1182
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:32,444
Heading, 068, angels, 1.5.

1183
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,613
- Speed, 45 knots.
- Forty-five knots. Are you sure?

1184
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:36,964
Yes, sir.

1185
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:45,290
Hello, Bird Form. This is Flag Down.
Scramble the five-minute birds.

1186
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:51,755
Attention. Attention.

1187
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:55,274
Scramble Bird Dog flight.
Scramble Bird Dog flight.

1188
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:59,695
Vector 270. Vector 270.

1189
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:04,241
Locate to angels 1.5. Angels 1.5.

1190
01:26:51,647 --> 01:26:54,442
It's so lovely and peaceful up here,

1191
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,460
as though we were
the only two people in the world.

1192
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,670
Well, aren't we?

1193
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,163
Ned.

1194
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:08,555
Ned!

1195
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,715
- Did you see what I saw?
- I hope not.

1196
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:19,316
- Let's run that again.
- Roger.

1197
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:23,111
Here they come again!

1198
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:26,406
Let's get out of here!

1199
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:34,566
Hello, Flag Down. This is Bird Dog leader.

1200
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,541
I have a visual on that bogey.

1201
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,460
Well, speak up. What is it?

1202
01:27:38,836 --> 01:27:41,338
I don't think
you're going to like this, sir.

1203
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,341
What's the matter with you?
Give me that bogey report.

1204
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,843
It's a Model T, sir.

1205
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:50,305
- A what?
- A Model T touring car.

1206
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:51,807
Only it's flying!

1207
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:56,812
Bird Dog leader, I suggest for your own
sake that you take another look.

1208
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:03,344
Well, I can't, sir.
It's gone into a cloud...

1209
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,987
And it won't come out.

1210
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:08,782
What's the procedure, sir?

1211
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,619
I think I'll let the colonel
handle this one.

1212
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,538
Yes, Flag Down?

1213
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:17,374
Well, go on, Captain. Go on.

1214
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,627
A flying what?

1215
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:23,880
Cut the clowning, Flag Down.
The CO's here.

1216
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:26,117
- What's going on, Colonel?
- Nothing, sir.

1217
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,744
What do you mean, "Nothing"?

1218
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:30,205
It's Flag Down, sir.
Just a little question of procedure.

1219
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,305
Give me that.

1220
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:35,335
What's all this about procedure?
Don't you know your job, man?

1221
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:36,893
Don't interrupt me.

1222
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:41,466
It might interest you to know
the general's staff

1223
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:44,886
has worked out exact procedure
for every possible situation.

1224
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,903
There's nothing could happen that...

1225
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:50,407
A flying what?

1226
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,422
- Looks like they've gone.
- Good.

1227
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,826
Can we get out of here now?
This is ruining my hair set.

1228
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:10,552
Darling, you never looked more beautiful.

1229
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,834
Gentlemen, it's quite simple, really.

1230
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:19,212
Obviously, a Model T cannot fly.

1231
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,881
Therefore, it must be
something disguised as a Model T.

1232
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:25,734
I am declaring a condition yellow.
Let's move, Colonel.

1233
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,957
How lovely it is.

1234
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:44,028
It makes you feel proud, doesn't it?

1235
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:46,406
Washington's a great city.

1236
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:47,631
There's something there for everyone.

1237
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,602
Look at all those people down there.

1238
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:04,882
- I think they're staring at us.
- I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1239
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:06,718
I can't hear what
they're yelling, can you?

1240
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,944
Hi, down there!

1241
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:11,154
Oh, Ned! Look out!

1242
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,162
Kind of hits you between the eyes,
doesn't it?

1243
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:25,236
Look! There's Grant's Tomb.

1244
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,363
I, uh, think Grant's Tomb
is in New York, dear.

1245
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:29,073
I believe that's the Jefferson Memorial.

1246
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:31,091
Oh, you mean Monticello.

1247
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,917
Betsy, I think there's a touring map
in the side pocket.

1248
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:42,477
Will you see
if you can find the Pentagon building?

1249
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:49,693
It has five sides and a big parking lot.

1250
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,096
I doubt if it's on here, dear.

1251
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:54,766
This map is from the year 1917!

1252
01:31:02,081 --> 01:31:04,875
Oh, there's the Capitol. Won't that do?

1253
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:06,877
The Capitol.

1254
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,198
Gosh, Betsy, when you think of
all the history that was made there.

1255
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:13,493
Now, don't forget.
You're making history right now.

1256
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:17,038
Oh, you think so?
I hope they don't make a fuss over me.

1257
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:20,249
We interrupt this program
to bring you an emergency bulletin.

1258
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:21,766
This is the commanding officer,

1259
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:26,563
sector air defense, speaking on
all commercial and military wavelengths.

1260
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:31,943
Attention, an unidentified
flying object is over the city.

1261
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,515
- I don't see anything. Do you?
- No!

1262
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,365
Nothing up here but us.

1263
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:40,436
- Every defensive missile in the area...
- Us!

1264
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:43,038
...is trained on the flying object.

1265
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:48,293
If it does not identify itself,
it will be shot down immediately.

1266
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,197
- They wouldn't dare!
- Oh, yes. They'd, they'd dare.

1267
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,616
This is your last warning.

1268
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:56,760
Identify yourself, or we will open fire.

1269
01:31:57,470 --> 01:32:01,389
- Ready at Fort Meade?
- Missile battery's locked on target, sir.

1270
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:07,145
Repeat. Are you listening,
unidentified flying object?

1271
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:10,607
We are waiting for your response.

1272
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:14,152
I am responding! I'm Professor Brainard!

1273
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,948
At the count of 10, we open fire.

1274
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:21,144
Don't bother to count, General.
I'm an American.

1275
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:23,161
- Two...
- See? My credit cards.

1276
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,663
Three,

1277
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:27,624
four,

1278
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:30,862
- Wait, General!
- You're not gonna stand for that, are you?

1279
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,171
- Five...
- Yes.

1280
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:35,924
Six,

1281
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:38,510
seven...

1282
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:42,180
Sir, Fort Meade reports
he's gone behind the Capitol dome.

1283
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:45,710
- Eight...
- Sir, Congress is in session.

1284
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:49,062
If you fire, we might
lose every senator and congressman.

1285
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:53,191
Nine...

1286
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:57,821
And they've just put a new front
on the building.

1287
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:05,745
Hold your fire.

1288
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:09,484
Well, why try to pass the buck to me?

1289
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,360
Just because it looks like a...

1290
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,460
What?

1291
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:14,838
Well, I don't care if it is a Model T.

1292
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:18,493
Shoot it down! Right. Right.

1293
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:23,372
And if you happen to see a Stutz Bearcat
or a Pope Toledo flying over the Capitol,

1294
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:25,265
shoot them down too.

1295
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:37,011
As a personal favor,
won't you please identify yourself?

1296
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,681
Professor, this is the admiral speaking.

1297
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,934
Proceed directly to
Anacostia Naval Air Station...

1298
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,435
This is your old friend General Singer.

1299
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:46,354
Now, you fly right over
to Bolling Air Force Base...

1300
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:47,438
This is the Army.

1301
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:51,175
- Report to Fort Myer.
- Anacostia naval air station.

1302
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:57,881
Now, hear this!

1303
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:00,750
Anacostia.

1304
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:05,122
They had their chance.
I'm not gonna fool around any longer.

1305
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:07,291
- Ned, what are you doing?
- We're going to land

1306
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,460
on that big patch of green lawn.

1307
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,712
- Oh, Ned. Not there, please!
- Why not?

1308
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,564
My hair, it's a mess,
and I haven't a thing to wear.

1309
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:20,596
Anybody home?

1310
01:34:20,696 --> 01:34:21,696
Ned!

1311
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:32,024
This way, Professor. Please.
Explain what the President said.

1312
01:34:34,418 --> 01:34:36,862
Professor, what did
the President have to say?

1313
01:34:36,962 --> 01:34:37,947
Well...

1314
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:40,700
The President, devoted
as always, to the advance of science,

1315
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,370
has embraced the discovery of flubber
with tremendous enthusiasm.

1316
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,539
Uh, Professor, what branch
of the armed services

1317
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,015
will be given control
of your new discovery?

1318
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:51,919
- Well...
- All will share alike.

1319
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:55,881
In our opinion, flubber will only
cement the great, traditional ties

1320
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:57,732
of inter-service cooperation.

1321
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,845
Professor, with this great
breakthrough in science,

1322
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:03,279
do you feel you still have
other worlds to conquer?

1323
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,057
I do.

1324
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:09,077
Just so there's no doubt about it,
would you mind repeating that?

1325
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,606
I do.

1326
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:15,860
With pleasure, and a deep sense
of accomplishment,

1327
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:19,838
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1328
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:27,303
Oh!

1329
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:31,125
Brickabracker, soda cracker,

1330
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,377
sis-boom-bah!

1331
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:36,855
Married, married, rah-rah-rah!

1332
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:46,122
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Good luck!
